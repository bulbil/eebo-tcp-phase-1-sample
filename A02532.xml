            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).

               My dread Soueraigne Lord and Maſter.
               May it pleaſe your Maieſty:
            
            
               NOw at laſt (thankes be to my good God) I haue finiſhed the long-taske of my Meditations vpon the hiſtoricall part of the Old Teſtament: A Worke that I foreſaw muſt be the iſſue both of time, and thoughts; It

preſumed to intitle it ſelfe at firſt, to your Gracious name, in ſucceſsion to your immortall Brothers; and now, it brings to your Royall hands, a due account of an happy diſpatch.
            Beſides my owne publique ingagement, the incouragements of many worthy Diuines, both at home, and abroad, drew me on, in this pleaſing, though buſie, labour; and made mee beleeue the ſeruice would not be of more paine, then vſe.
            I humbly preſent it to your Maieſtie; not fearing to ſay, that in regard of the ſubiect, it is not ſo fit for any eies as Princely; For what doth it elſe but comment vpon that, which God hath thought good to ſay of Kings; what they haue done, what they ſhould haue done; how they ſped in good, in euill? Certainly there can be none ſuch miroir

of Princes vnder heauen, as this, which God hath made for the faces of his Deputies on earth. Neither can the eyes of Soueraigne Greatneſſe be better taken vp then with this ſacred reflection. If my defects haue not been notorious, the matter ſhall enough commend the worke; which together with the vnworthy Author, humbly caſts it ſelfe at the feet of your Maieſty; with the beſt vowes of fidelity and obſeruance, from him, that prides himſelfe in nothing more, then in the ſtyle of
            
               Your Maieſties moſt faithfully deuoted ſeruant,

                        The SHVNAMITE ſuing to IEHORAM; ELISHA conferring with HAZAEL.
                     
                        HOw royally hath Eliſha 
                        2 Kings 8. paid the Shunamite for his lodging! To him already ſhe owes the life of her ſonne, both giuen, and reſtored; and now againe (after ſo many yeares, as might well haue worne out the memory of

ſo ſmall a courteſie) her ſelfe, her ſonne, her family owe their liues to ſo thankfull a gueſt. That table, and bed, and ſtoole, and candleſticke was well beſtowed: That candleſticke repaid her the light of her future life and condition, that table the meanes of maintenance, that ſtoole a ſeat of ſafe abode, that bed a quiet reſt from the common calamities of her nation: Hee is a niggard to himſelfe, that ſcants his beneficence to a Prophet, whoſe very cold water ſhall not go vnrewarded. Elijah preſerued the Sareptan from famine; Eliſha the Shunamite; he, by prouiſion of oyle and meale; this, by premonition: Ariſe, and goe, thou and thine houſhold, and ſoiourne whereſoeuer thou canſt
                        
                        ſoiourne. The Sareptan was poore, and driuen to extremes, therefore the Prophet prouides for her, from hand to mouth: The Shunamite was wealthy, and therfore the Prophet ſends her to prouide for her ſelfe: The ſame goodnes that relieues our neceſsity, leaues our competency to the hand of our owne counſell; in the one, he will make vſe of his owne power, in the other, of our prouidence.
                     The very Prophet aduiſes this holy Client to leaue the bounds of the Church: and to ſeeke life, where ſhe ſhould not finde religion: Extremity is for the time a iuſt diſpenſation with ſome common rules of our outward demeanure, and motions, euen from

better to worſe. All Iſrael and Iudah ſhall be affamiſhed; The body can be preſerued no where, but where the ſoule ſhall want; Somtimes the conueniences of the ſoule muſt yeeld to bodily neceſſities. Wantonneſſe and curioſity can finde no aduantage from that which is done out of the power of need.
                     It is a long famine that ſhall afflict Iſrael; Hee vpon whom the ſpirit of Elijah was doubled, doubled the iudgement inflicted by his Maſter; Three yeares and an halfe did Iſrael gaſpe vnder the drought of Elijah; ſeauen yeares dearth ſhall it ſuffer vnder Eliſha: The tryals of God are many times not more grieuous for their ſharpneſſe, then for their continuance.
                     
                        
This ſcarcity ſhall not come alone; God ſhall call for it: what euer be the ſecond cauſe, he is the firſt. The executioners of the Almighty (ſuch are his iudgments) ſtand ready waiting vpon his iuſt Throne; and doe no ſooner receiue the watch-word, then they flye vpon the world, and plague it for ſinne; Onely the cry of our ſinnes moues God to call for vengeance: And if God once call, it muſt come; How oft, how earneſtly are we called to repentance, and ſtir not? the meſſengers of Gods wrath flye forth at the leaſt becke; and fulfill the will of his reuenge vpon thoſe, whoſe obedience would not fulfill the will of his command.
                     After ſo many proofes of fidelitie

the Shunamite cannot diſtruſt the Prophet; not ſtaying therfore to be conuicted by the euent, ſhe remoues her family into the Land of the Philiſtims: No nation was more oppoſite to Iſrael, none more worthily odious; yet, there doth the Shunamite ſeeke, &amp; finde ſhelter; Euen the ſhade of thoſe trees that are vnwholſome, may keepe vs from a ſtorme; Euery where will God finde roome for his owne. The fields of Philiſtins flouriſh, whiles the ſoyle of Iſrael yeelds nothing but weeds and barrenneſſe: Not that Iſrael was more ſinfull, but that the ſin of Iſrael is more intolerable. The offers of grace are ſo many aggrauations of wickedneſſe: In equall offences thoſe doe iuſtly ſmart

more, who are more obliged. No peſtilence is ſo contagious as that which hath taken the pureſt ayre.
                     Theſe Philiſtine neighbours would neuer haue endured themſelues to be peſtered with forrainers; eſpecially Iſraelites, whom they hated (beſides religion) for their vſurpation: neyther were they in all likelihood preſſed with multitude: The reſt of Iſrael were led on with hopes; preſuming vpon the amends of the next harueſt, till their want grew deſperate, and irremediable; onely the forwarned Shunamite preuents the miſchiefe; now ſhe findes what it is to haue a Prophet her friend: Happy are thoſe ſoules that vpon all occaſions conſult with Gods Seers; they ſhall be freed from the

plagues, wherein the ſecure blindneſſe of others is heedleſly ouertaken.
                     Seauen yeares had this Shunamite ſoiourned in Paleſtine, now ſhe returnes to her owne; and is excluded: She that found harbour among Philiſtines, findes oppreſſion and violence among Iſraelites: Thoſe of her kinred, taking aduantage of her abſence, had ſhared her poſſeſsions. How oft doth it fall out that the worſt enemies of a man are thoſe of his owne, houſe? All went by contraries with this Shunamite; In the famine ſhe had enough, in the common plenty ſhe was ſcanted; Philiſtines were kinde to her, Iſraelites cruell: Both our feares, and our hopes doe not ſeldome diſappoint

vs; It is ſafe truſting to that ſtay which can neuer faile vs; who can eaſily prouide vs both of friendſhip in Paleſtine, and of iuſtice in Iſrael. Wee may not iudge of the religion by particular actions; A very Philiſtine may be mercifull, when an Iſraelite is vniuſt; The perſon may be faulty, when the profeſsion is holy.
                     It was not long ſince the Prophet made that friendly offer to the Shunamite, out of the deſire of a thankfull requitall; VVhat is to be done for thee? wouldeſt thou be ſpoken for to the King, or to the Captaine of the Hoſt? and ſhe anſwered; I dwell among my brethren. Little did ſhe then thinke of this iniurious meaſure; elſe ſhe might haue ſaid; I dwell amongſt mine enemies, I

dwell amongſt robbers. It is like they were then friendly, who were now cruell, and oppreſsiue; There is no truſt to be repoſed in fleſh and blood: How ſhould their fauors be conſtant, who are in their nature, and diſpoſition, variable? It is the fureſt way to relye on him, who is euer like himſelfe; the meaſure of whoſe loue is eternitie.
                     Whither ſhould the Shunamite goe to complaine of her wrong, but to the Court? There is no other refuge of the oppreſſed, but publike authoritie: All Iuſtice is deriued from Soueraignty: Kings are not called Gods for nothing; They doe both ſentence and execute for the Almighty.
                     Doubtleſſe, now the poore

                        Shunamite thought of the courteous profer of Eliſha; and miſsing a friend at the Court, is glad to be the preſenter of her owne petition.
                     How happily doth God contriue all euents for the good of his! This ſuppliant ſhall fall vpon that inſtant for her ſuit, when the King ſhall bee talking with Gehezi; when Gehezi ſhall bee talking of her, to the King; The words of Gehezi, the thoughts of the King, the deſires of the Shunamite ſhall be all drawne together by the wiſe prouidence of God into the center of one moment, that his oppreſſed ſeruant might receiue a ſpeedy iuſtice. Oh the infinite wiſedome, power, mercy of our God, that inſenſibly

orders all our wayes, as to his owne holy purpoſes, ſo to our beſt aduantage.
                     What doth Iehoram the King talking with Gehezi the Leper? That very preſence was an eyeſore.
                     But if the cohabitation with the infectious were forbidden, yet not the conference. Certainly, I begin to thinke of ſome goodneſſe in both theſe: Had there not beene ſome goodneſſe in Iehoram, he had not taken pleaſure to heare, euen from a leprous mouth, the miraculous acts and praiſes of Gods Prophet; Had there not beene ſome goodneſſe in Gehezi, he had not after ſo fearfull an infliction of iudgment, thus ingenuouſly recounted the

praiſes of his ſeuere Maſter; Hee that told that deare-bought lye to the Prophet, tells now all truths of the Prophet, to the King: Perhaps his leproſie had made him cleane; If ſo: Happy was it for him that his forhead was white with the diſeaſe, if his ſoule became hereupon white with repentance. But wee may well know that the deſire, or report of hiſtoricall Truths, doth not alwayes argue grace. Still Iehoram, after the inquiry of the Prophets miracles, continues his Idolatry. He that was curious to harken after the wonders of Eliſha, is not carefull to follow his doctrine; Therefore are Gehezi and the Shunamite met before him, that hee may be conuicted, who will not

be reformed: Why was it els that the preſence of the perſons ſhould thus inexpectedly make good the relation, if God had not meant the inexcuſableneſſe of Iehoram; whiles he muſt needs ſay within himſelfe; Thus potent is the Prophet of that God, whom I obey not; Were not Eliſhaes, the true God, how could hee worke ſuch wonders? And if he be the true God, why is he not mine? But what? Shall I change Ahabs God for Iehoſaphats? No; I cannot deny the miracles, I will not admit of the author: Let Eliſha be powerfull, I will be conſtant. O wretched Iehoram; how much better had it been for thee neuer to haue ſeene the face of Gehezi, and the ſon of the Shunamite; then to goe

away vnmoued with the vengeance of leproſie in the one, with the mercifull reſuſcitation of the other? Therfore is thy iudgment fearfully aggrauated, becauſe thou wouldſt not yeeld to what thou couldſt not oppoſe. Had not Ahabs obdurateneſſe beene propagated to his ſonne, ſo powerfull demonſtrations of diuine power could not haue been vneffectuall. Wicked hearts are ſo much worſe by how much God is better; This anvile is the harder by being continually beaten vpon, whether with iudgments, or mercy.
                     Yet this good vſe will God haue made of this report, and this preſence, that the poore Shunamite ſhall haue iuſtice; That ſonne, whoſe life was reſtored, ſhall

haue his inheritance reuiued; His eſtate ſhall fare the better for Eliſhaes miracle: How much more will our mercifull God ſecond his owne bleſsings, when the fauors of vniuſt men are therefore drawne to vs, becauſe wee haue beene the ſubiects of diuine beneficence.
                     It was a large, and full award, that this occurrence drew from the King; Reſtore all that was hers, and all the fruits of the field, ſince the day that ſhe left the land, euen vntill now. Not the preſent poſſeſsion onely is giuen her, but the arerages.
                     Nothing hinders, but that outward iuſtice may ſtand with groſſe Idolatry. The Widow may thanke Eliſha for this; His miracle

wrought ſtill; and put this new life into her dead eſtate; His abſence did that for the preſeruation of life, which his preſence did for the reſtoring it from death. Shee that was ſo ready to expoſtulate with the man of God, vpon the loſſe of her ſonne, might perhaps haue beene as ready to impute the loſſe of her eſtate to his aduice; Now, that for his ſake ſhee is enriched with her owne; how doth ſhee bleſſe God for ſo happy a gueſt? When we haue forgotten our owne good turnes, God remembers and crownes them: Let vs do good to all whiles we haue time, but eſpecially to the houſhold of faith.
                     Could Iſrael haue beene ſenſible of their owne condition, it

was no ſmall vnhappineſſe to loſe the preſence of Eliſha: Whether, for the Idolatries, or for the famine of Iſrael, the Prophet is gone into Syria; No doubt Naaman welcomd him thither; and now would force vpon him thoſe thankes for his cure, which the man of God would not receiue at home.
                     How famous is he now grown that was taken from the Teame? His name is not confined to his owne Nation; Forraine countries take notice of it; and Kings are glad to liſten after him, and wooe him vvith preſents: Benhadad the King of Syria, whoſe counſells he had detected, reioyeeth to heare of his preſence; and now, as hauing forgotten that he had ſent a

vvhole hoſt, to beſiege the Prophet in Dothan, ſends an honorable meſſenger to him, laden with the burden of fourty Camels, to conſult with this Oracle, concerning his ſickneſſe, and recouery.
                     This Syrian belike in his diſtreſſe dares not truſt to his owne gods; but hauing had good proofe of the power of the God of Iſrael, both in Naamans cure, and in the miraculous defeats of his greateſt forces, is glad to ſend to that ſeruant of God, whom he had perſecuted. Wicked men are not the ſame in health and in ſickneſſe: their affliction is worthy of the thankes, if they be well-minded; not themſelues.
                     Doubtleſſe the errand of Benhadad was not onely to inquire of

the iſſue of his diſeaſe, but to require the prayers of the Prophet for a good iſſue: Euen the worſt man doth ſo loue himſelfe, that hee can be content to make a beneficiall vſe of thoſe inſtruments, whoſe goodneſſe he hateth.
                     
                        Hazael, the chiefe Peere of Syria is deſigned to this meſſage; The wealth of his preſent ſtriues with the humility of his cariage, and ſpeech: Thy ſonne Benhadad King of Syria hath ſent me to thee, ſaying, Shall I recouer of this diſeaſe? Not long ſince, Iehoram King of Iſrael had ſaid to Eliſha, My father, ſhall I ſmite them; and now Benhadad King of Syria, ſayes, My father, ſhall I recouer: Lo how this poore Meholathite hath Kings to his ſons: How great is the honor of Gods

Prophets with Pagans, with Princes? Who can bee but confounded to ſee Euangelicall Prophets deſpiſed by the meaneſt Chriſtians?
                     It is more then a ſingle anſwer that the Prophet returnes to this meſſage: One anſwer he giues to Benhadad, that ſent it; another hee giues to Hazael, that brings it: That to Benhadad, is, Thou maieſt ſurely recouer; That to Hazael, The Lord hath ſhewed me that he ſhall ſurely dye: What ſhall we ſay then? Is there a lye, or an equiuocation in the holy mouth of the Prophet? God forbid: It is one thing what ſhall be the nature, and iſſue of the diſeaſe; Another thing what may outwardly befall the perſon of Benhadad: The queſtion

is moued of the former; wherto the anſwer is direct; The diſeaſe is not mortall; But withall an intimation is giuen to the bearer, of an euent beyond the reach of his demand; which hee may know, but eyther needs not, or may not returne: The Lord hath ſhewed me that he ſhall ſurely dye; by another meanes, though not by the diſeaſe.
                     The Seer of God deſcries more in Hazael, then hee could ſee in himſelfe; hee fixes his eyes therefore ſtedfaſtly in the Syrians face, as one that in thoſe lines read the bloody ſtory of his life.
                     
                        Hazael bluſhes, Eliſha weepes; The intention of thoſe eyes did not ſo much amaze Hazael, as the teares; As yet he vvas not guilty to

himſelfe of any wrong that might ſtraine out this iuyce of ſorrow: Why weepeth my Lord?
                     
                     The Prophet feares not to foretell Hazael all the villanies which he ſhould once do to Iſrael; How he ſhould fire their forts, and kill their yong men, and rip the mothers, and daſh the children. I maruell not now at the teares of thoſe eies which foreſaw this miſerable vaſtation of the inheritance of God; The very mention whereof is abhorred of the future author: What is thy ſeruant a dog, that I ſhould doe this great thing? They are ſauage cruelties whereof thou ſpeakeſt; It were more fit for mee to weepe that thou ſhouldeſt repute mee ſo brutiſh; I ſhould no leſſe condemne my

ſelfe for a beaſt, if I could ſuſpect my owne degeneration ſo farre. Wicked men are caryed into thoſe heights of impiety, which they could not in their good mood haue poſsibly beleeued; Nature is ſubiect to fauourable opinions of it ſelfe; and will rather miſtruſt a Prophet of God, then her owne good diſpoſition: How many from honeſt beginnings, haue riſen to incredible licentiouſneſſe, whoſe liues are now ſuch, that it were as hard for a man to beleeue they had euer beene good, as to haue perſwaded them once they ſhould proue ſo deſperately ill.
                     To giue ſome ouerture vnto Hazael of the oportunitie of this enſuing miſchiefe; the Prophet

foretells him from God, that hee ſhall be the King of Syria.
                     
                     He that ſhewes the euent, doth not appoint the meanes; Far was it from the ſpirit of Gods Prophet to ſet, or encourage a treaſon: whiles hee ſaid therefore, Thou ſhalt be King of Syria; he ſaid not, Goe home, and kill thy maſter: The wicked ambition of Hazael drawes this damnable concluſion out of holy premiſes; and now hauing fed the hopes of his Soueraigne with the expectation of recouery; the next day he ſmothers his Maſter. The impotent deſire of rule brookes no delay: Had not Hazael been graceleſly cruell, after hee had receiued this prediction of the Seer, hee ſhould haue patiently awaited for

the crowne of Syria, till lawfull meanes had ſet it vpon his head; now, he will by a cloſe execution make way to the throne; A wet cloth hath ſtopt the mouth of his ſicke Soueraigne; No noyſe is heard; the carcaſſe is faire; Who can complaine of any thing but the diſeaſe?
                     O Hazael, thou ſhalt not thus eaſily ſtop the mouth of thine owne conſcience; that ſhall call thee Traytor, euen in thy chaire of ſtate; and ſhall checke all thy royall triumphs, with, Thou haſt founded thy throne in blood. I am deceiued if this wet cloth ſhall not wipe thy lips in thy iollyeſt feaſts, and make thy beſt morſells vnſavory: Soueraignty is painfull vpon the faireſt termes; but vpon

trechery, and murder, tormenting: Wofull is the caſe of that man whoſe publike cares are aggrauated with priuate guiltineſſe; and happy is he, that can inioy a little with the peace of an honeſt heart.
                  
                  
                     
                     IEHV with IEHORAM and IEZEBEL.
                     
                        YEt Hazael began his 2 Kings 9. cruelty with loſſe: Ramoth Gilead is won from him; Iehoram the ſon hath recouered that, which Ahab his father attempted in vaine; That City was dear-bought of Iſrael; it coſt the life of Ahab, the blood of Iehoram; Thoſe wounds were healed with victory; The King tends his health at Iezreel, whiles the Captaines were enioying, and ſeconding their ſucceſſe at Ramoth.
                     
                     
                        
Old Eliſha hath neither cotage, nor foot of land, yet ſitting in an obſcure corner, he giues order for Kingdomes; Not by way of authority (this vſurpation had been no leſſe proud, then vniuſt) but by way of meſſage, from the God of kings; Euen a meane Herald may goe on a great errand: The Prophets of the Goſpell haue nothing to doe but with ſpirituall Kingdoms; To beate downe the kingdomes of ſinne and Satan; to tranſlate ſoules to the Kingdome of heauen.
                     Hee that renued the life of the Shunamites ſonne, muſt ſtoope to age; That blocke lies in his way to Iehu; The aged Prophet imployes a ſpeedier meſſenger, who muſt alſo gird vp his loynes, for

haſt: No common pace will ſerue vs when we goe on Gods meſſage; The very loſſe of minutes may be vnrecouerable. This great Seer of God wel ſaw a preſent concurrence of all oportunities: The Captaines of the Hoſt were then readily combined for this exploit: the Army was on foot; Iehoram abſent; a ſmall delay might haue troubled the work; the diſperſion of the Captaines, and Hoſt, or the preſence of the King, might eyther haue defeated, or ſlacked the diſpatch: He is prodigall of his ſucceſſe, that is ſlow in his execution.
                     The directions of Eliſha to the young Prophet, are full, and punctuall: whither to goe; what to cary; what to doe; where to doe

it; what to ſay, what ſpeed to make, in his act, in his returne: In the buſineſſes of God it matters not how little is left to our diſcretion; There is no important buſineſſe of the Almighty, wherin his precepts are not ſtrict, and expreſſe; Looke how much more ſpecialty there is in the charge of God, ſo much more danger is in the violation.
                     The young Prophet is curiouſly obedient; in his haſte; in his obſeruation and cariage: and finding Iehu, according to Eliſhaes prediction, ſet amongſt the Captaines of the Hoſt, he ſingles him forth, by a reuerent compellation; I haue an errand to thee, O Captaine; Might not the Prophet haue ſtayed till the table had riſen, and then

haue followed Iehu to his lodging? Surely, the wiſdome of God hath purpoſely pitcht vpon this ſeaſon, that the publike view of a ſacred meſſenger, and the haſty euocation of ſo noted a perſon, to ſuch a ſecrecy, might prepare the hearts of thoſe Commanders of Iſrael, to the expectation of ſome great deſigne.
                     The inmoſt roome is but cloſe enough for this act; Ere many houres, all Iſrael ſhall know that, which yet may not bee truſted with one eye; The goodneſſe of God makes wiſe prouiſion for the ſafety of his meſſengers, and whiles he imployes their ſeruice, preuents their dangers.
                     But how is it that of all the Kings of the Ten tribes, none

was euer anointed but Iehu? Is it for that the God, who would not countenance the erection of that vſurped throne, would countenance the alteration? Or is it, that by this viſible teſtimony of diuine ordination, the courage of the Iſraelitiſh Captaines might be raiſed vp to ſecond the high and bold attempt of him, whom they ſaw deſtin'd from heauen to rule?
                     Together with the oyle of this vnction, here was a charge of reuenge; A reuenge of the blood of the Prophets, vpon Iezebel; of wickedneſſe and Idolatry, vpon Ahab: neither was the extirpation of this leud family fore-propheſied onely to Iehu, but inioyned.
                     
                        Elijah foretold, and the world

expected ſome fearfull account of the abhominable cruelty, and impiety of that accurſed houſe; Now it is called for, when it ſeemed forgotten: Ahab ſhall haue no poſterity, Iezebel ſhall haue no toomb, but the doggs. This woful doome is committed to Iehues execution.
                     Oh the ſure, though patient, iuſtice of the Almighty: Not only Ahab and Iezebel had beene bloody, and idolatrous, but Iſrael was drawne into the partnerſhip of their crimes; All theſe ſhall ſhare in the iudgment: Elijahs complaint in the caue now receiues this late anſwer; Hazael ſhall plague Iſrael; Iehu ſhall plague the houſe of Ahab and Iezebel; Eliſhaes ſeruant thus ſeconds Eliſhaes maſter:

When wickednes is ripe in the field, God will not let it ſheed to grow againe, but cuts it vp by a iuſt, and ſeaſonable vengeance: Ahabs drouping vnder the threat hath put off the iudgment from his owne dayes; now it comes, and ſweepes away his wife, his iſſue; and falls heauy vpon his ſubiects. Pleaſe your ſelues, ô ye vaine ſinners, in the ſlow pace of vengeance; it will be neither leſſe certaine, nor more eaſie for the delay; rather it will pay for that leaſure in the extremitie.
                     The Prophet hath done his errand, and is gone. Iehu returnes to his fellowes, with his head not more wet with oyle, then buſied with thoughts: no doubt, his face bewrayed ſome inward tumults,

and diſtractions of imagination; neyther ſeem'd hee to returne the ſame he went out. They aske therefore, Is all well? Wherefore came this mad fellow to thee? The Prophets of God were to theſe idolatrous Iſraelites, like comets; who were neuer ſeene without the portendement of a miſchiefe: When the prieſts of their Baal were quietly ſacrificing, all was well; but now when a Prophet of God comes in ſight, their guiltineſſe askes, Is all well? All would be well but for their ſinnes; they feare not theſe, they feare their reprouer.
                     
                        Iſrael was comne to a good paſſe, when the Prophets of God went with them for mad men: Oh ye Baalitiſh Ruffians, whither

hath your impiety and profaneneſſe caryed you, that ye ſhould thus blaſpheme the ſeruants of the liuing God? Ye that run on madding after vaine Idols, taxe the ſober guides of true worſhip, for madneſſe. Thus it becomes the godleſſe enemies of truth, the heralds of our patience, to miſ-call our innocence, to reuile our moſt holy profeſſion: What wonder is it that Gods meſſengers are mad men vnto thoſe, to whom the wiſedome of God is fooliſhnes?
                     The meſſage was not deliuered to Iehu for a concealment, but for publication: Silence could not effect the word that was told him; common notice muſt; Yee know the man, and his communication: The habit ſhowes you the man;

the calling ſhowes you his errād: Euen Prophets were diſtinguiſhed by their clothes; Their mantle was not the common weare; why ſhould not this ſacred vocation be knowne by a peculiar attyre? Theſe Captaines had not calld him a mad-man, if they had not knowne him a Prophet: By the man therefore they might gueſſe at his meſſage; Prophets doe not vſe to appeare, but vpon ſerious errands; whether of reproofe, or of prediction.
                     Nice ciuilities of denialls were not then knowne to the world; They ſaid, It is falſe, tell vs now: Amongſt theſe Captains no combat, no vnkindneſſe followes vpon a word ſo rudely familiar.
                     
                        Iehu needs not tell them, that

the man was a Prophet; hee tels them the propheſie of the man; what he had ſaid, what hee had done.
                     Their eies had no ſooner ſeene the oyle; their eares had no ſooner heard, Thus ſaith the Lord, I haue anointed thee King ouer Iſrael, then they riſe from their ſeates, as rapt with a tempeſt, and are hurled into armes; So doe they haſt to proclaime Iehu, that they ſcarce ſtay to ſnatch vp their garments, which they had perhaps left behind them for ſpeed, had they not meant with theſe rich abiliments to garniſh a ſtate for their new Soueraigne; To whom hauing now erected an extemporall Throne, they doe by the ſound of Trumpets giue the ſtyle of

Royalty, Iehu is King.
                     
                     So much credit hath that mad fellow with theſe gallants of Iſrael, that vpon his word they will preſently aduenture their liues, &amp; change the Crowne. God giues a ſecret authority to his deſpiſed ſeruants; ſo as they which hate their perſon, yet reuerence their truth: Euen very ſcorners cannot but beleeue them; If when the Prophets of the Goſpell tell vs of a ſpirituall Kingdome, they be diſtruſted of thoſe which profeſſe to obſerue them, how ſhamefull is the diſproportion? how iuſt ſhall their iudgment be?
                     Yet I cannot ſay whether meer obedience to the Prophet, or perſonall diſlikes of Iehoram, or partiall reſpects to Iehu, drew the Captaines

of Iſrael; The will of God may be done thankleſly, when fulfilling the ſubſtance, we faile of the intention, and erre in circumſtance.
                     Onely Ramoth is conſcious of this ſudden Inauguration; This new prince-dome yet reaches no further then the ſound of the trumpet: Iehu is no leſſe ſubtile, then valiant; he knew that the notice of this inexpected change might worke a buſie, and dangerous reſiſtance; he therfore giues order that no meſſenger of the newes may preuent his perſonall execution, that ſo he might ſurpriſe Iehoram in his palace of Izreel, whether tending his late wounds, or ſecurely feaſting his friends, and dreaming of nothing

leſſe then danger; and might be ſeene, and felt at once. Secreſie is the ſafeſt gard of any deſigne; diſcloſed proiects are either fruſtrated, or made needleſly difficult.
                     Neither is Iehu more cloſe, then ſwift; That very trumpet with the ſame wind ſounds his march; from the toppe of the ſtaires, he ſteps downe into his charet; That man meanes to ſpeed, who can bee at once reſerued in his counſels, and reſolute and quicke in his performances.
                     Who could but pity the vnhappy and vnſeaſonable viſitation of the grand-childe of Iehoſaphat, were it not that hee was degenerate into the family of Abab? Ahaziah King of Iudah is comne to viſit Iehoram King of Iſrael; the

knowledge of his late receiued wounds hath drawn thither this kind ill-matched allie: He who was partner of the warre, cannot but be a viſitor of the wounds.
                     The two Kings are in the height of their complement, and entertainments, when the watchman of the Tower of Izreel eſpies a troupe, a farre off. For ought was knowne, there was nothing but peace in all the Land of Iſrael; and Iudah was now ſo combined with it, that both their Kings were feaſting vnder one roofe; yet, in the midſt of this ſuppoſed ſafety, the watch-tower is not vnfurniſhed with heedy eyes: No ſecuritie of peace can free wiſe Gouernors from a carefull ſuſpition of what may come, and a

prouidence againſt the worſt. Euen whiles we know of no enemies, the watch-tower of due intelligence may not be empty.
                     In vaine are dangers fore-ſeen, if they be not premoniſhed; It is all one to haue a blind and a mute watch-man; This ſpeakes what he ſees; I ſee a company.
                     
                     Doubtleſſe Iehorams head was now full of thoughts; neither knew hee what conſtruction to put vpon this approching troupe; Perhaps, the Syrians (hee thinkes) may haue recouered Ramoth; and chaſed the gariſon of Iſrael; neither can hee imagine whether theſe ſhould be hoſtile victors, or vanquiſhed ſubiects, or conſpiring rebells. Euery way this rout was dreadfull. Oh Iehoram, thou

beginſt thy feares too late; Hadſt thou beene afraid to prouoke the God of Iſrael, thine innocency had yeelded no roome to theſe terrors.
                     An horſeman is diſpatcht to diſcouer the meaning of this deſcryed concourſe: Hee meets them, and inquires of peace; but receiues a ſhort anſwer, What haſt thou to doe with peace? turne thee behind mee? A ſecond is addreſſed; with the ſame ſucceſſe: Both attend the traine of Iehu in ſtead of returning; Indeed, it is not for priuate perſons to hope to rectifie the publike affaires, when they are growne to an height of diſorder, and from thence to a ripeneſſe of miſ-cariage: Sooner may a well-meaning man hurt

himſelfe, then redreſſe the common danger.
                     Theſe meſſengers were now within the mercy of a multitude, had they but indeuored to retire, they had periſhed as wilfully, as vainly: Whoſoeuer will be ſtriuing againſt the torrent of a iuſt iudgment, muſt needs bee caried downe in the ſtreame: Sometimes there is as much wiſdome in yeelding, as courage in reſiſtance.
                     Had this troupe beene farre off, the watchman could not haue deſcryed the arriuall of the meſſengers, their turning behind, the manner of the march; Iehu was a noted Captaine, his cariage and motion was obſerued more full of fire, then his fellowes; The
                        
                        driuing is like Iehues, for hee driueth furiouſly: God makes choyce of fit inſtruments, as of mercy, ſo of reuenge; Theſe ſpirits were needfull for ſo tragicall a ſcene, as was now preparing in Iſrael.
                     
                     
                        Iehoram and Abaziah, as netled with this forced patience of expectation, can no longer keepe their ſeates; but will needs haſten their charets; and fetch that coſtly ſatisfaction, which would not be ſent, but giuen.
                     They are infatuated, which ſhall periſh; otherwiſe Iehoram had beene warned enough by the forceable retention of his meſſengers, to expect none but an enemy. A friend, or a ſubiect could not haue beene vnwilling to bee knowne, to be lookt for; Now;

forgetting his wounds, he will go to fetch death.
                     Yet when he ſees Iehu, whom he left a ſubiect, hopes ſtriue with his doubts, Is it peace, Iehu? what may be the reaſon of this ſudden iourney? Is the army foyled by the Syrians? Is Ramoth recouered? or hath the flight of the enemy left thee no further worke? or is ſome other ill newes guilty of thy haſt? What meanes this vnwiſhed preſence, and returne?
                     There needs no ſtay for an anſwer; The very face of Iehu, and thoſe ſparkling eyes of his ſpake fury, and death to Iehoram; which yet his tongue angerly ſeconds: What peace, ſo long as the whordomes of thy mother Iezebel, and her witchcrafts are ſo many?
                     
                     
                        
Wicked Tyran, what ſpeak'ſt thou of peace with men, when thou haſt thus long waged warre with the Almightie? That curſed mother of thine hath nurſed thee with blood, and trained thee vp in abominable Idolatries.
                     Thou art not more hers, then her ſinne is thine; thou art polluted with her ſpirituall whoredomes, and inchanted with her helliſh witchcrafts: Now that iuſt God whom thou, and thy parents haue ſo hainouſly deſpited, ſends thee by me this laſt meſſage of his vengeance; which whiles hee ſpake, his hand is drawing vp that deadly arrow, which ſhall cure the former wounds with a worſe.
                     Too late now doth wretched

                        Iehoram turne his charet, and flee; and cry Treaſon, ô Ahaziah; There was treaſon before, ô Iehoram; thy treaſon againſt the Maieſty of God, is now reuenged by the treaſon of Iehu againſt thee.
                     That fatall ſhaft, notwithſtanding the ſwift pace of both the charets, is directed to the heart of Iehoram; there is no erring of thoſe feathers which are guided by the hand of deſtinie.
                     How iuſt are the iudgments of God! It was in the field of Naboth, wherein Iehoram met with Iehu; That very ground called to him for blood; And now this new auenger remembers that propheſie which he heard from the mouth of Elijah, in that very place, following the heeles of Ahab;
                        
and is carefull to performe it. Little did Iehu thinke, when he heard that meſſage of Elijah, that his hands ſhould act it; now, as zealous of accompliſhing the word of a Prophet; hee giues charge to Bidkar his Captaine, that the bleeding carkaſſe of Iehoram ſhould be caſt vpon that very platt of Naboth: Oh Naboths blood well paid for! Ahabs blood is licked by dogs, in the very place where thoſe dogs lickt Naboths; Iehorams blood ſhall manure that ground, which was wrung from Naboth; and Iezebel ſhall adde to this compoſt. Oh garden of hearbes dearly bought, royally dunged.
                     What a reſemblance there is betwixt the death of the father,

and the ſonne; Ahab and Iehoram? Both are ſlaine in their charet; Both with an arrow; Both repay their blood to Naboth; and how perfit is this retaliation? Not only Naboth miſcaried in that cruell iniuſtice, but his ſonnes alſo; elſe the inheritance of the vineyard had deſcended to his heires, notwithſtanding his pretended offence; and now not onely Ahab forfaits his blood to this field; but his ſonne Iehoram alſo: Face doth not more anſwer to face, then puniſhment to ſinne.
                     It was time for Ahaziah King of Iuda, to flee: Nay it had beene time long before to haue fled from the ſins, yea from the houſe of Ahab; That brand is fearfull which God ſets vpon him; Hee
                        
                        did euill in the ſight of the Lord as did the houſe of Ahab; for he was the 2 Kings 27 ſonne in law of the houſe of Ahab; Affinity is too often guilty of corruption; The ſon of good Iehoſaphat is loſt in Ahabs daughter.
                     Now hee payes for his kinde alliance; accompanying the ſon of Ahab in his death, whom hee conſorted with in his Idolatry: Yong Ahaziah was ſcarce warme in his throne, when the miſ-matched blood of Athaliah is required from him; Nothing is more dangerous then to be imped in a wicked family; this relation too often drawes in a ſhare both of ſin, and puniſhment.
                     Who would not haue lookt that Iezebel hearing of this bloody

end of her ſon; and purſuit of her allye; and the fearfull proceedings of this proſperous conſpiracy, ſhould haue put her ſelfe into ſack-cloth and aſhes; and now finding no meanes either of defence, or eſcape, ſhould haue caſt her ſelfe into ſuch a poſture of humiliation, as might haue moued the compaſſion of Iehu; Her proud heart could not ſuddenly learne to ſtoope: rather ſhe recollects her high ſpirits; and in ſtead of humbling her ſoule by repentance, and addreſſing her ſelfe for an imminent death; ſhe pranks vp her old carkaſſe, and paints her wrinkled face, and as one that vainly hopes to daunt the courage of an vſurper, by the ſudden beames of Maieſty; ſhe

lookes out, and thinks to fright him with the challenge of a traitor, whoſe either mercy, or iuſtice could not be auoided: Extremitie findes vs ſuch as our peace leaues vs; Our laſt thoughts are ſpent vpon that wee care moſt for; thoſe that haue regarded their face more then their ſoule, in their latter end are more taken vp with deſire of ſeeming faire, then being happy: It is no maruell if an heart obdured with the cuſtome of ſinne ſhut vp graceleſly. Counterfait beauty agrees well with inward vncleanneſſe.
                     
                        Iebues reſolution was too ſtrongly ſetled to bee remoued with a painted face, or an opprobrious tongue; He lookes vp to the window, and ſayes, Who is on
                        
                        my ſide, who? There want not thoſe euery where, which will be ready to obſerue preuailing greatneſſe: Two or three Eunuchs looke out; He bids them, Throw her downe: They inſtantly lay hold on their lately adored Miſtris, and notwithſtanding all her ſhrieks and prayers, caſt her downe headlong into the ſtreet.
                     What heed is to be taken of the deepe profeſſed ſeruices of hollow harted followers; All this while they haue with humble ſmiles, and officious deuotions fawned vpon their great Queene; now vpon the call of a proſperous enemy, they forget their reſpects, her royalty; and caſt her downe, as willing executioners, into the iawes of a fearfull death:

It is hard for greatneſſe to know them whom it may truſt: Perhaps the faireſt ſemblance is from the falſeſt heart; It was a iuſt plague of God vpon wicked Iezebel, that ſhee was inwardly hated of her owne; He whoſe ſeruants ſhe perſecuted, raiſed vp enemies to her from her owne elbow.
                     Thus muſt pride fall; Inſolent, idolatrous, cruell Iezebel beſprinkles the walls, and pauement with her blood; and now thoſe braines that deuiſed miſchiefe againſt the ſeruants of God, are ſtrawed vpon the ſtones; and ſhe that inſulted vpon the Prophets, is trampled vpon by the horſes heeles: The wicked is kept 
                        Iob 21. 
                        for the day of deſtruction, and ſhall be
                        
                        brought forth to the day of wrath.
                     
                     Death puts an end commonly to the hyeſt diſpleaſure. He that was ſeuere in the execution of the liuing, is mercifull in the ſepulture of the dead; Goe ſee now this curſed woman, and bury her, for ſhe is a Kings daughter; She that vpbrayded Iehu with the name of Zimri, ſhall be interred by Iehu as Omries daughter in law, as a Sydonian Princeſſe; Somewhat muſt bee yeelded to humanity; ſomewhat to State.
                     The dogs haue preuented Iehu in this purpoſe, and haue giuen her a liuing toomb more ignoble, then the worſt of the earth; Onely the ſcull, hands, and feet of that vaniſhed carkaſſe yet remaine; The ſcull which was the roofe of

all her wicked deuices, the hands and feet which were the executioners; theſe ſhall remaine as the monuments of thoſe ſhamefull exequies: that future times ſeeing theſe fragments of a body, might ſay, The dogges were worthy of the reſt; Thus Iezebel is turned to dung, and dogs-meat; Elijah is verified, Naboth is reuenged; Izreel is purged, Iehu is zealous, and in all, God is iuſt.
                  
                  
                     
                     IEHV killing the ſonnes of AHAB, and the Prieſts of BAAL.
                     
                        THere were two 2 Kings 10. prime Cities of the Ten Tribes, which were the ſet Courts of the Kingdome of Iſrael; Samaria and Iezreel; The chiefe palace of the King was Iezreel, the mother City of the Kingdome, was Samaria; Iehu is poſſeſſed of the one, without any ſword drawne againſt him; Iezreel willingly changes the maſter, yeelding it ſelfe to the

victor of two Kings, to the auenger of Iezebel; the next care is Samaria; Either policy, or force ſhall fetch in that head of the Tribes.
                     The plentifull iſſue of Princes is no ſmall aſſurance to the people; Ahab had ſonnes enough to furniſh the Thrones of all the neighbour nations, to maintaine the hopes of ſucceſſion, to all times; How ſecure did he think the perpetuation of his poſterity, when he ſaw ſeuenty ſons from his owne loynes? Neither was this Royall iſſue truſted, either to weake walls, or to one roofe; but to the ſtrong bulwarkes of Samaria, and therein to the ſeuerall guards of the chiefe Peeres; It was the wiſe care of their parents

not to haue them obnoxious to the danger of a common miſ-cariage, or, of thoſe emulations which wait vpon the cloyedneſſe of an vndiuided conuerſation; but, to order their ſeparation ſo, as one may reſcue other from the perill of aſſault, as one may reſpect other out of a familiar ſtrangeneſſe. Had Ahab and Iezebel beene as wiſe for their ſoules, as they were for their ſeed, both had proſpered.
                     
                        Iehu is yet but in his firſt act; If all the ſonnes of Ahab bleed not, the propheſie is vnanſwered; There ſhall be no need of his ſword, his penne ſhall worke all this ſlaughter. He writes a Challenge to Samaria, and therein to the guardians of the ſons of Ahab;
                        
daring them, out of the confidence in their defenced City, in their charets, and horſes, in their aſſociats and armes, to ſet vp the beſt of their maſters ſonnes, on his fathers throne, and to fight for his ſucceſſion.
                     All the Gouernours of Ahabs children conſpire in one common feare; no doubt there wanted not in that numerous brood of Kings, ſome great ſpirits that if, at leaſt they attained to the notice of this deſigne, longed for a reuenge, and ſuggeſted counſels of reſolution to their cowardly guardians; Shall an audacious vſurper runne thus away with the Crowne of Iſrael? Shall the blood of Iezebel be thus traiterouſly ſpilt, thus wilfully forgotten? O Iſraelites,
                        
can ye be ſo baſe, as to be ruled by my fathers ſeruant? Where are the merits of Ahab, and Iehoram? What is becomne of the loyall courage of Iſrael? Doubtleſſe, ye ſhal not wāt able ſeconds to your valour; Do ye thinke the royall and potent alliances of our mother Iezebel; and the remayning heyres of Iudah, can draw back their hands from your aide? will they indure to ſwallow ſo cruell an indignity? Stir vp your aſtoniſhed fortitude, ô ye Nobles of Iſrael; redeeme your bleeding honour, reuenge this trecherous conſpirator, and eſtabliſh the right of the vndoubted heires of your Soueraignes; But as warm clothes to a dead man, ſo are the motions of valour to a fearfull

heart: Behold two Kings ſtood not before him, how then ſhall we ſtand?
                     
                     Feare affrights it ſelfe rather then it will want bugs of terror: It is true: Two Kings fell before Iehu; but, two Kings vnarmed, vnguarded; Had not the ſurprizall of Iehu taken aduantage of the vnſuſpitious nakedneſſe of theſe two Princes, his victory had not beene thus ſucceſsfull, thus eaſie. Halfe one of thoſe two Kings, vpon aduertiſement and preparation, had abated the fury of that hot Leader. It is the faſhion of feare to repreſent vnto vs alwaies the vvorſt, in euery euent: not looking at the inequality of the aduantages, but the miſery of the ſucceſſe: as contrarily, it is the guiſe of faith, and valour, by the

good iſſue of one enterpriſe to raiſe vp the heart to an expectation and aſſurance of more.
                     Theſe mens hearts are dead with their Kings, neither dare entertaine the hope of a ſafe and proſperous reſiſtance, but baſely returne, We are thy ſeruants, and will doe all that thou ſhalt bid vs, we will not make any King; doe thou that which is good in thine eyes.
                     
                     Well may Iehu think, theſe men which are thus diſloyall to their charge, cannot be faithfull to me; It is their feare that drawes them to this obſeruation: Were they not cowards, they would not be traitors to their Princes, ſubiects to me: I may vſe their hands, but I will not truſt them: It is a thankleſſe obedience that is grounded

vpon feare; there can be no true fidelity without loue, &amp; reuerēce. Neyther is it other betwixt God and vs; if out of a dread of hel we be officious, who ſhall thanke vs for theſe reſpects to our ſelues?
                     As one that had taſted already the ſweetneſſe of a reſolute expedition, Iehu writes backe inſtantly, If ye be mine, and if ye will harken vnto my voyce; take ye the heads of the men your Maſters ſonnes, and come to me to Iezreel by to morrow this time. Valiant Iehu was ſo well acquainted with the nature of feare, that he well knew this paſſion once growne deſperate, would be ready to ſwallow all conditions: ſo far therefore doth his wiſedome improue it, as to make theſe Peers his executioners; who preſently

vpon the receit of his charge turne cruell, &amp; by a ioynt conſent fetch off the ſeauenty heads of thoſe Princes, whom they vndertooke to guard, vvhom they had flattered vvith the hopes of greater honour.
                     No doubt, but amongſt ſo many ſonnes of Ahab, ſome had ſo demeaned themſelues, that they had wonne zealous profeſſions of loue from their guardians: Except perhaps death ſtole vpon them in ſleepe, what teares, what intreaties, what cōiurations muſt here needs haue beene?
                     What haue wee done, ô yee Peeres of Iſrael, that might deſerue this bloody meaſure? We are the ſonnes of Ahab, therefore haue ye hitherto profeſſed to obſerue vs;

what change is this? vvhy ſhould that which hath hitherto kept you loyall, now make you cruell? Is this the reward of the long peaceable gouernment of our father? are theſe the Trophees of Ahabs victories againſt Benhadad, Iehorams againſt Hazael? If wee may not raigne, yet at leaſt, let vs liue: Or if vve muſt dye; why will your hands bee imbrued in that blood, vvhich ye had vvont to terme royall, and ſacred? vvhy will ye of Tutors turne murtherers? All pleas are in vaine to them that are deafned with their owne feares. Perhaps theſe expoſtulations might haue fetched ſome dewes of pity from the eyes, and kiſſes from the lips of theſe vnfaithfull Tutors, but cannot preuent

the ſtroke of death; Theſe Crocodiles vveepe vpon thoſe, vvhom they muſt kill: &amp; if their owne ſonnes had beene in the place of Ahabs, doubtleſſe they had beene ſacrificed to the vvill of an vſurper, to the paients ſafety: It is ill relying vpon timerous natures; vpon euery occaſion thoſe crazie reeds vvill breake, and runne into our hands. How vvorthy were Ahab and Iezebel of ſuch friends? They had been euer falſe to God, how ſhould men be true to thē? They had ſold themſelues to vvorke wickednes, and now they are requited with a mercenary fidelity: for a few lines haue theſe men ſold all the heads of Ahabs poſterity: Could euer the policy of Iezebel haue reacht ſo farre, as

to ſuſpect the poſſibility of the extirpation of ſo ample an iſſue in one night, by the hands of her truſtieſt ſubiects?
                     Now ſhe that by her letter ſent to the Elders of Iezreel, ſhed the blood of Naboth and his ſonnes, hath the blood of all her ſonnes ſhed by a letter ſent from Iezreel, to the Elders of Samaria. At laſt, God will be ſure to come out of the debt of vvicked ſinners, and will pay them with that coyne, which is both moſt proper, and leaſt lookt for.
                     Early in the morning, in that gate of Iezreel where Ahab had paſſed many an vniuſt ſentence, is preſented vnto Iehu, the fearfull pledge of his ſoueraignty, ſeuenty gaſtly heads of the ſons of Ahab.
                     
                     
                        
Some carnall eye that had ſeene ſo many young and ſmooth faces beſmeared vvith blood, would haue melted into compaſſion, bemoning their harmleſſe age, their vntimely end: It is not for the iuſtice of God to ſtand at the barre of our corrupted iudgment. Except we include ſome grandchildren of Ahab within this number, none of theſe dyed before they vvere ſeaſoned vvith horrible Idolatry; or if they had; they were in the loynes of Ahab when hee ſold himſelfe to worke wickedneſſe; &amp; now it is iuſt vvith God to puniſh Ahabs vvickedneſſe in this fruit of his loynes. The holy ſeuerity of God in the reuenge of ſinne ſometimes goes ſo farre that our ignorance is ready to miſtake

it for cruelty.
                     The vvonder and horror of thoſe two heapes hath eaſily drawne together the people of Iezreel: Iehu meets them in that ſeat of publique iudgment; and finding much amazednes &amp; paſſionate confuſion in their faces; he cleares them, and ſends them to the true originall of theſe ſudden and aſtoniſhing maſſacres.
                     Howeuer his owne conſpiracy, and the cowardly trechery of the Princes of Iſrael had been (not vvithout their hainous ſinne) the viſible meanes of this iudgment, yet he directs their eyes to an hyer authoritie; the iuſt decree of the Almighty, manifeſted by his ſeruant Elijah; vvho euen by the vvilling ſinnes of men can moſt

wiſely, moſt hoſtilely fetch about his moſt righteous and bleſſed purpoſes.
                     If the Peers of Samaria out of a baſe feare, if Iehu out of an ambition of raigning ſhed the foule blood of Ahabs poſterity; the ſin is their owne, but in the meane time the act is no other then what the infinite iuſtice of God would iuſtly worke by their miſ-intentions. Let theſe Iſraelites but looke vp from earth to heauen, theſe tragicall changes cannot trouble thē; thither Iehu ſends them; wiping off the enuy of all this blood, by the warrant of the diuine preordination: In obedience whereunto he ſends after theſe heyres of Ahab, all his kinsfolkes, fauourites, prieſts that remained in Iezreel:
                        
and now hauing cleared theſe coaſts, he haſts to Samaria: whom ſhould he meet with, in the way, but the brethren of Ahaziah King of Iudah; they are going to viſit their cozens the ſonnes of Ahab: This young troupe was thinking of nothing but iollity, and courtly intertainment, when they meet with death: So ſuddenly, ſo ſecretly had Iehu diſpatched theſe bold executions, that theſe Princes could imagine no cauſe of ſuſpition: How could they thinke it might be dāgerous to be knowne for the brethren of Ahaziah, or friends to the brethren of Iehoram? The iuſt prouidence of the Almightie hath brought all this covie vnder one net; Iehu thinkes it not ſafe to let goe ſo many auengers

of Ahaziahs blood; ſo many corriuals of his Soueraignty. The vnhappy affinitie of Iehoſaphat with Ahab is no leſſe guilty of this ſlaughter, then Iehues ambition; This match by the inoculation of one bud, hath tainted all the ſap of the houſe of Iudah. The two &amp; fourtie brethren of Ahaziah are therefore ſent after the ſeuentie ſonnes of Ahab; that they may ouertake them in death, whom they came to viſit; God will much leſſe brooke Idolatry from the loines of a Iehoſaphat: Our intireneſſe with wicked men feoffs vs both in their ſinnes and iudgments.
                     Doubtleſſe, many Iſraelites that were deuoted to the family and allies of Ahab, lookt (what they

durſt) awry at this cōmon effuſion of royal blood; yet in the worſt of the deprauednes of Iſrael, there were ſome which both drouped vnder the deplored Idolatry of the times, and congratulated to Iehu this ſeuere vindication of Gods inheritance: Amongſt the reſt, Ionadab the ſon of Rechab was moſt eminent. That man was by deſcent deriued from Iethro; a Midianite by nation, but incorporated into Iſrael; a man, whoſe piety, and ſtrict conuerſation did both teach, and ſhame thoſe twelue Tribes to which he was ioyned; He was the author of an auſtere rule of ciuility to his poſterity; to whom he debarred the vſe of wine, cities, poſſeſſions: This old and rough friend of Iehu, (out of

his mouing habitations) meets him, and applauds his ſucceſſe; He that allowed not wine to his ſeed, allowes the blood of Ahabs ſeed poured out, by the hand of Iehu; He that ſhun'd the city, is caryed in Iehues charet, to the palace of Samaria.
                     
                     How eaſily might Iehu haue beene deceiued? Many a one profeſſes vprightneſſe, who yet is all guile: Ionadabs cariage hath been ſuch, that his word merits truſt: It is a bleſſing vpon the plainehearted, that they can be beleeued: Honeſt Ionadab is admitted to the honor of Iehues ſeat; and called (in ſtead of many) to witneſſe the zeale of the new-anointed King of Iſrael.
                     
                     Whiles Iehu had to doe with

Kings, his cunning and his courage held equal pace together; but now that he is to deale with idolatrous prieſts, his wile goes alone, and preuailes: He calls the people together, and diſſembling his intentions, ſayes, Ahad ſerued Baal a little, but Iehu ſhall ſerue him much: Now therefore call vnto me all the Prophets of Baal, all his ſeruants, and all his prieſts, let none be wanting: for I haue a great ſacrifice to doe to Baal: whoſoeuer ſhall be wanting, he ſhall not liue.
                     
                     What a dead paleneſſe was there now in the faces of thoſe few true-harted Iſraelites, that looked for an happy reſtauration of the religion of God? How could they chooſe but think; Alas, how are we fallen from our hopes? Is

this the change we lookt for? was it only ambition that hath ſet this edge vpon the ſword of Iehu? It was not the perſon of Ahab that we diſliked but the ſins: If thoſe muſt ſtill ſucceed, what haue we gained? Woe be to vs, if onely the author of our miſery be changed, not the condition, not the cauſe of our miſery.
                     On the other ſide, what inſultations and triumphs ſounded euery where of the ioyfull Baalites? What glorying of the truth of their profeſſion, becauſe of the ſucceſſe? what ſcornes of their deiected oppoſites? what exprobrations of the diſappointed hopes, and predictions of their aduerſe Prophets? what promiſes to thē
                        ſelues of a perpetuity of Baaliſme?
                        
How did the diſperſed prieſts of Baal now flock together, and applaud each others happineſſe, and magnifie the deuotions of their new Soueraigne? Neuer had that Idoll ſo glorious a day as this for the pompe of his ſeruice; Before, he was adored ſinglely in corners, now ſolemne ſacrifices ſhall bee offered to him by all his clients, in the great Temple of the mother Citie of Iſrael. I can commend the zeale of Iehu, I cannot commend the fraud of Iehu; We may come to our end euen by crooked wayes: He that bad him to ſmite for him, did not bid him to lie for him: Falſhood, though it be but tentatiue, is neither needed, nor approued by the God of truth: If policy haue allowed officious

vntruths, Religion neuer.
                     By this deuice, the houſe of Baal is well furniſhed, well filled; not one of his Chemarim eyther might, or would be abſent: not one of thoſe which were preſent, might be vnrobed: Falſe Gods haue euer affected to imitate the true. Euen Baal hath Temples, Altars, Prieſts, veſtments: All religions haue allotted peculiar habits to their hyeſt deuotions. Thoſe Veſtments which they miſ-called ſacred are brought forth, and put on for the glory of this ſeruice.
                     
                        Iehu and Ionadab are firſt carefull that this ſeparation be exact; they ſearch, and ſee that no ſeruant of the Lord be crept into that thrōg: What ſhould a religious Iſraelite
                        
doe in the Temple of Baal? Were any ſuch there, hee had deſerued their ſmart, who would partake with their worſhip; but if curioſity ſhould haue drawne any thither, the mercy of Iehu ſeekes his reſcue: How much more fauourable is the God of mercies in not taking aduantage of our infirmities.
                     Well might this ſearch haue bred ſuſpition, were it not that in all thoſe Idolatrous ſacrifices, the firſt care was to auoid the profane: Euen Baal would admit no mixture, how ſhould the true God abide it?
                     Nothing wanted now, but the ſacrifice: No doubt whole heards and flockes were ready for a pretence of ſome royall hecatombs;

whereof ſome had now already ſmoked on their Altars. O Iehu what meanes this dilation? If thou abhorreſt Baal, why didſt thou giue way to this laſt ſacrifice? why didſt thou not cut off theſe Idolaters before this vpſhot of their wickedneſſe? Was it that thou mightſt be ſure of their guiltineſſe? was it that their number, together with their ſinne, might be complete? What acclamations were here to Baal, what ioy in the freedome of their reuiued worſhip: when all on the ſudden, thoſe that had ſacrificed, are ſacrificed; The Souldiers of Iehu by his appointment ruſh in with their ſwords drawne, and turne the temple into a ſlaughter-houſe. How is the tune now changed?

What ſhrieking was here? what out-cries? what running from one ſword, to the edge of another? what ſcrambling vp the walls and pillars? what climbing into the windowes? what vaine endeuors to eſcape that death which would not be ſhunned? whether running, or kneeling, or proſtrate, they muſt dye.
                     The firſt part of the ſacrifice was Baals, the latter is Gods: The blood of beaſts was offered in the one, of men in the other; the ſhedding of this was ſo much more acceptable to God, by how much theſe men were more beaſts, then thoſe they ſacrificed. Oh happy obedience; God was pleaſed with a ſacrifice from the houſe of Baal; The Idolaters are

ſlaine, the Idols burnt, the houſe of Baal turn'd to a draught (tho euen thus leſſe vncleane, leſſe noyſome, then in the former perfumes;) and in one word, Baal is deſtroyed out of Iſrael.
                     
                     Who that had ſeene all this zeale for God, would not haue ſaid; Iehu is a true Iſraelite. Yet, he that rooted out Ahab, would not be rid of Ieroboam: He that deſtroyed Baal, maintained the two Calues of Dan and Bethel. That Idolatry was of a lower ranke; as being a miſ-worſhip of the true God, whereas the other was a worſhip of the falſe: Euen the eaſier of both is haynous; and ſhall robb Iehu of the praiſe of his vprightneſſe.
                     A falſe heart may laudably quit

it ſelfe of ſome one groſs ſin, &amp; in the meane time hugg ſome leſſer euill that may condemne it: As a man recouered of a Feuer, may dye of a Iaundis, or a Dropſie. We loſe the thanke of all, if wee wilfully fault in one.
                     It is an intire goodnes that God cares for: Perhaps (ſuch is the bounty of our God) a partiall obedience may be rewarded with a temporall bleſſing; (as Iehues ſeuerity to Ahab ſhal cary the crown to his ſeed for foure generations) but we can neuer haue any comfortable aſſurance of an eternall retribution, if our hearts &amp; wayes be not perfit with God. Woe be to vs, ô God, if wee bee not all thine: wee cannot but euerlaſtingly depart from thee, if wee

depart not from euery ſinne: Thou haſt purged our hearts from the Baal of our groſſe Idolatries, oh cleare vs from the golden Calues of our pety-corruptions alſo; that thou maiſt take pleaſure in our vprightneſſe; and wee may reape the ſweet comforts of thy gracious remuneration.
                  
                  
                     
                     ATHALIAH and IOASH.
                     
                        OH the wofull ruines 2 Kings 11, &amp; 12. And 2 Chron. 23. &amp; 24. of the houſe of good Iehoſaphat: Iehu hath ſlain two and fourty of his iſſue; Athaliah hopes to root out the reſt: This daughter of Ahab was not like to be other then fatall to that holy Line; One drop of that wicked blood was enough both to impure, and ſpill all the reſt which affinity had mixed with it.
                     It is not vnlike that Ahaziah betaking himſelfe to the ſociety of

                        Iehorams warres, committed the ſway of his Scepter to his mother Athaliah. The daughter of Iezebel cannot but be plotting: when ſhe heares of the death of Ahaziah, and his brethren, inflicted by the heauy hand of Iehu, ſhee ſtraight caſts for the Kingdome of Iudah: The true heires are infants, their minority giues her both colour of rule, and oportunity of an eaſie extirpation. Perhaps, her ambition was not more guilty then her zeale of Baaliſme: ſhe ſaw Iehu out of a deteſtation of Idolatry, trampling on the blood of Iehoram, Iezebel, Ahaziah, the ſonnes of Ahab, the brethren of Ahaziah, the prieſts and prophets of Baal; and in one word, triumphing in the deſtruction both of Ahab, and his Gods

out of Iſrael: and now ſhe thinks, Why ſhould not I deſtroy Iehoſaphat, and his God out of Iudah?
                     
                     Who euer ſaw an Idolater that was not cruell? Athaliah muſt needs let out ſome of her owne blood, out of the throat of Ahaziahs ſonnes; yet ſhe ſpares not to ſhed it out of a thirſt of ſoueraignty. O God how worthy of wonder are thy iuſt and mercifull diſpenſations? In that thou ſuffereſt the ſeed of good Iehoſaphat to bee deſtroyed by her hand, in whoſe affinity he offended, and yet ſaueſt one branch of this ſtock of Iehoſaphat, for the ſake of ſo faithfull a progenitor.
                     Wicked Athaliah, couldſt thou thinke God would ſo farre forget his Seruant Dauid (though no

other of thoſe loynes had ſeconded his vertues) as to ſuffer all his ſeed to be rooted out of the earth? This vengeance was for thy father Ahab; The man according to Gods owne heart ſhall haue a lineall heyre to ſucceed in his Throne, when thou and thy fathers houſe ſhall haue vaniſhed into forgetfulneſſe.
                     For this purpoſe hath the wiſe prouidence of God ordained a Iehoſheba, and matcht her in the prieſtly Tribe: Such reuerence did Iehoram, King of Iudah (though degenerated into the Idolatry of his father in law Ahab) beare to this ſacred function, that he marries his daughter to Iehoiada the Prieſt. Euen Princeſſes did not then ſcorne the bed of thoſe that

ſerued at Gods Altar: Why ſhould the Goſpel poure contempt vpon that which the Law honoured?
                     That good Lady had too much of Iehoſaphat in her, to ſuffer the vtter extirpation of that royall ſeed; She could not doubtleſſe, without the extreme danger of her owne life, ſaue the life of her nephew Ioaſh; With what a louing boldneſſe doth ſhe aduenture to ſteale him from amongſt thoſe bleeding carkaſſes, in the chamber of death? Her match gaue her oportunity to effect that, which both nature, and religion moued her to attempt: neyther know I, whether more to wonder at the cunning of the deuice, or the courage of the enterpriſe, or the ſecreſie of the concealment, or

the happineſſe of the ſucceſſe: Certainly, Athaliah was too cruelly-carefull to forget this ſo late borne ſonne of Ahaziah; of all the reſt, his age would not ſuffer him to be out of her eye: In all likelihood therefore, ſhee muſt needs haue miſſed ſo noted a corps, had there not beene a ſubſtitution of ſome other dead chyld in his roome: In that age, the fauour is not ſo diſtinguiſhable; eſpecially of a dead face. Without ſome pious deceit this worke could neuer haue beene effected; Elſe, had the chyld beene ſecretly ſubduced, and miſſed by his bloody grandmother, her perpetuall iealouſie had both expected a ſuruiuing heyre, and continued a curious, and vnauoydable ſearch: both

which were now ſhunned at once, whilſt Athaliah reckons him for dead, whom Iehoſheba hath preſerued. Miſchiefe ſometimes failes of thoſe appointments, wherein it thinkes to haue made the ſureſt worke; God laughes in heauen at the plots of Tyrans; and befooles them in their deepeſt proiects. He had ſaid to Dauid, Of the fruit of thy body will I ſet vpon thy ſeate; In vaine ſhall earth and hell conſpire to fruſtrate it.
                     Sixe yeares hath Ioaſh, and his nurſe beene hid in a cloſe cell of the Temple: Thoſe roomes were deſtin'd onely to the holy Tribe; yet now reioyce to harbour ſuch a gueſt; The rigour of the ordinary Law muſt yeeld to caſes of ſo important neceſſity.
                     
                        
All this could not poſſibly be done and continued without the priuity of many faithfull Prieſts &amp; Leuites; who were as carefull to keepe this counſell, as hopefull of the iſſue of it: It is not hard for many honeſt hearts to agree in a religious ſecreſie; Needs muſt thoſe lips bee ſhut, which God hath ſealed vp.
                     
                        Iudah had not been vſed to ſuch a yoke; long had it groned vnder the tyranny not of a woman onely, but an Idolatrous Sydonian: If any of that ſexe might haue claimed that Scepter, none had ſo much right to it, as Iehoſheba her ſelfe; But good Iehoiada the Prieſt, who had rather to bee a loyall guardian to the King, then an huſband to a Queene, now findes

time to ſet on foot the iuſt title of Ioaſh; and to put him into the miſvſurped throne of his father Ahaziah.
                     
                     In the ſeuenth yeare, therefore, he ſends for the Captaines, and the Gard; and hauing ſworne them ſecrecy; by vndoubted witneſſes makes faith vnto them of the truth of their natiue Prince, thus happily reſcued from the bloody knife of his mercileſſe Grandmother; marſhals the great buſineſſe of his Inauguration; giues euery one his charge; ſets euery one his ſtation; and ſo diſpoſes of his holy forces, as was moſt needfull for the ſafety of the King, the reuenge of the Vſurper, the preuention of tumults, the eſtabliſhment of the Crowne

vpon the owners head in Peace and Ioy.
                     There was none of all theſe agents who did not hold the buſineſſe to bee his owne; Euery true ſubiect of Iudah was feelingly intereſſed in this ſeruice; neither was there any of them, who was not ſecretly heart-burned all this while, with the hatefull gouernment of this Idolatrous Tyranneſſe: And now this inward fire is glad to find a vent; How gladly do they addreſs themſelues to this welcome imployment? The greateſt part of this ſecret band were Leuites, who might therefore both meet together with leaſt ſuſpition, and be more ſecurely truſted by Iehoiada, vnder whom they ſerued; Euen that

holy Prieſt of God in ſtead of teaching the Law, ſets the gard, orders the Captaines, ranges the troupes of Iudah; and in ſtead of a Cenſer, brings forth the Speares and Shields of Dauid; the Temple is for the preſent, a Field, or an Artillery-yard; and the Ephods are turned into harneſſe. That houſe, in the rearing whereof not the noyſe of an hammer might be heard, now admits of the claſhing of armour, and the ſecret murmurs of ſome military atchieuement: No circumſtances either of place, or calling, are ſo punctuall, as that publique neceſſity may not diſpenſe with their alteration.
                     All things are now ready for this ſolemnity: Each man reioyces

to fixe vpon his owne footing; and longs to ſee the face of their long-concealed Soueraigne; and vowes his blood to the vindication of the common liberty, to the puniſhment of a cruell intruder: Now Iehoiada brings forth vnto them the Kings Son, and preſents him to the Peeres, and people; Hardly can the multitude containe it ſelfe from ſhouting out too ſoone: One ſees in his countenance the features of his Father, Ahaziah; another of his Grandfather, Iehoram; a third profeſſes to diſcerne in him ſome lines, and faſhion of his greatgrandfather Iehoſaphat; all find in his face the naturall impreſſions of Maieſty; and reade in it the hopes, yea the propheſies of their

future happineſſe. Not with more ioy, then ſpeed, doth Iehoiada accompliſh all the rites of the Coronation. Before that young King could know what was done to him, hee is anointed, crowned, preſented with the booke of the Law: Thoſe ceremonies were inſtructiue; and, no doubt, Iehoiada failed not to comment vpon them in due time, to that royall Pupill.
                     The Oyle, wherewith he was anointed, ſignified his deſignation to that high ſeruice; and thoſe indowments from heauen that might inable him to ſo great a function.
                     The Crowne, wherewith he was adorned, ſignified that glorie and maieſty which ſhould

both incourage, and attend his Princely cares.
                     The booke of the Teſtimony ſignified the diuine rules and directions, whereto he muſt frame his heart and actions, in the weilding of that Crowne, in the improuement of that oile.
                     Theſe three, the oile, the Crown the Teſtimonie, that is, inward powers, outward magnificence, true pietie and iuſtice make vp a perfect Prince; None of theſe may be wanting; If there be not a due calling of God, and abilities meet for that greatneſſe, the oile faileth: If there be not a Maieſticke grace and royaltie, that may command reuerence, the Crowne is miſſing; If there be not a carefull reſpect to the law of God, as the abſolute

guide of all counſells, and determinations, the Teſtimonie is neglected; all of them concurring, make both King and people happy.
                     Now, it is time for the people to clap their hands, and by their lowd acclamations to witneſſe their ioy; which muſt needs break forth with ſo much more force, by how much it was longer, vpon feares and policy, ſuppreſſed.
                     The Court and the Temple were neere together; Howeuer it was with Athaliah, and the late reuolted Princes of Iudah, according to the common word, the neerer to the Church, the further from God; their religious predeceſſors held it the greateſt commodity of their houſe, that it neighboured

vpon the houſe of God; From her palace might Athaliah eaſily heare the ioyfull ſhouts of the multitude, the lowd noiſe of the Trumpets; and as aſtoniſhed with this new tumult of publike gratulations, ſhe comes running into the Temple: Neuer had her foot trod vpon that holy pauement, till now that ſhe came to fetch a iuſt reuenge from that God whoſe worſhip ſhee had contemned.
                     It fell out well, that her ſudden amazedneſſe called her forth, without the attendance of any ſtrong guard; whoſe ſide-taking might haue made that quarrell mutually bloody: Shee ſoone heares, and ſees what ſhee likes not; her eare meets with, God

ſaue the King; her eye meets with the vnlooked for heyre of the Kingdome, ſitting on his throne, crowned, and robed, in the royall faſhion; guarded with the Captaines and ſouldiers, proclaimed by the Trumpeters, acclamed &amp; applauded by the people.
                     Who can ſay whether this ſight draue her more neer to frenzie, or death? How could it bee otherwiſe, when thoſe great ſpirits of hers, that had beene long vſed to an vncontrolled ſoueraigntie, find themſelues ſo inexpectedly ſuppreſſed.
                     Shee now rends her cloathes, and cryes, Treaſon, treaſon, as if that voice of hers could ſtill command all hearts, all hands; as if one breath of hers were powerfull

enough to blow away all theſe new deſignes: Oh Athaliah, to whom doſt thou complaine thy ſelfe? they are thy iuſt executioners wherewith thou art incompaſſed; If it be treaſon to ſet vp the true heire of Ahaziah, thou appealeſt to thy Traitors. The treaſon was thine, theirs is iuſtice; The time is now come of thy reckoning for all the royall blood of Iudah, which thine ambition ſhed; wonder rather at the patience of this long forbearance, then the rigor of this execution.
                     There needs no formall ſeat of Iuſtice in ſo apparent offence, Iehoiada paſſes the ſentence of death vpon her; Haue her forth of the ranges; Let her not be ſlaine in the houſe of the Lord; and him that followeth
                        
                        her, kill with the ſword.
                     
                     Had not this vſurpation beene palpable, Iehoiada would not haue preſumed to intermedle; Now being both the Prieſt of God, and Vnckle and Protector to the lawfull King, he doth that, out of the neceſſity of the ſtate, which his infant Soueraigne (if hee could haue beene capable of thoſe thoughts) would haue deſired.
                     Violent hands are layd vpon Athaliah, whom no doubt a proud and furious diſdaine of ſo quicke a charge, and of ſo rough an vſage made miſerably impatient; Now ſhe frownes, and cals, and ſhrieks and commands, and threatens, and reuiles, and intreats in vaine; and dyes with as much ill will from her ſelfe, as ſhe liued with

the ill will of her repining ſubiects.
                     I ſee not any one man of all her late flatterers, that followes her, either for pitty, or reſcue; Euery man willingly giues her vp to iuſtice; Not one ſword is drawn in her defence; Not one eye laments her. Such is the iſſue of a tyrannicall miſ-gouernment; that which is obeyed not without ſecret hate, is loſt not without publique ioy.
                     How like is Athaliah to her mother Iezebel, as in conditions and carriage, ſo euen in death: Both killed violently, both killed vnder their owne walls; both ſlaine with Treaſon in their mouthes; both ſlaine in the entrance of a changed gouernment:

One trod on by the horſes, the other ſlaine in the horſe-gate. Both paid their owne blood for the innocent blood of others.
                     How ſuddenly, how eaſily is Iudah reſtored to it ſelfe, after ſo long, and ſo fearfull a deprauation; The people ſcarce beleeue their owne eyes, for the wonder of this happy change; neither know I whether they bee more ioyed in the ſight of their new King, thus ſtrangely preſerued, or in the ſight of Iehoiada, that had preſerued him.
                     No man can enuy the protection of the young King vnto him, by whoſe meanes hee liues and raignes: That holy man cares onely to improue his authority, to the common good: He makes a
                        
                        couenant betweene the Lord, and the King, and the people: and after ſo long &amp; dangerous a disjunction, reunites them to each other. Their reuiued zeale beſtirs it ſelfe, and breakes downe the Temples, and altars, and images of Baal, and ſacrifices his idolatrous Prieſt; Shortly, both Ahab, and Baal is deſtroyed out of Iudah.
                     The Scepter of Iudah is changed from a woman, to a child; but, a Child trained vp, and tutored by Iehoiada; This minority ſo guided was not inferiour to the mature age of many predeceſſors. Happy is that land, the non-age of whoſe Princes falls into holy and iuſt hands. Yet euen theſe holy and iuſt hands came ſhort of what they might haue done; The

high places remained ſtill: Thoſe altars were erected to the true God, but in a wrong place: It is maruell if there be not ſome blemiſhes found in the beſt gouernment: I doubt Iehoiada ſhall once abuy it deare that hee did not his vtmoſt.
                     But for the mayne, all was wel with Iudah, in all the dayes of Iehoiada; euen after that Ioaſh was growne paſt his pupillage: Hee that was the Tutor to his infancie, was the councellor of his ripe age; and was equally happy in both: How pleaſing was it to that good High Prieſt, to be commanded by that charge of his in the buſineſſe of God? The yong King giues order to the Prieſts, for the collection of large ſumms,

to the repayring of the breaches of Gods Houſe. It becomes him well to take care of that, which was the nurſery of his infancy: And now, after three and twentie yeares he expoſtulates with his late Guardian, Iehoiada, and the reſt of his coate, Why repayre ye not the breaches?
                     
                     Oh gracious and happy viciſſitude; Iehoiada the Prieſt had ruled the infancy of King Ioaſh in matters of ſtate; and now Ioaſh the King commands aged Iehoiada the Prieſt in matter of deuotion. In the affaires of God, the action is the Prieſts, the ouerſight and coaction is the Princes: By the carefull indeuor of both, Gods houſe is repayred, his ſeruice flouriſheth.
                     
                        
But alas, that it may too well appeare, that the ground of this motion was not altogether inward, no ſooner doth the life of Iehoiada ceaſe, then the deuotion of Ioaſh begins to languiſh: and after ſome languor, dyes.
                     The benefit of a truly religious Prelate, or Stateſ-man, is not knowne till his loſſe.
                     Now ſome idolatrous Peeres of Iudah haue ſoone miſ-carryed the King from the Houſe of the Lord God of their Fathers, to ſerue Groues, and Idols. Yea, whither goe we wretched men, if we be left by our Maker? King Ioaſh is turned, not idolater onely, but perſecutor; yea, (which is yet more horrible to conſider) perſecutor of the ſonne of that Iehoiada
                        
to whom he owes his owne life. Zechariah his Coſen german, his foſter-brother, the holy iſſue of thoſe parents, by whom Ioaſh liues, and raignes, for the conſcionable rebuke of the idolatry of Prince, and people, is vniuſtly, and cruelly murthered by that vnthankfull hand: How poſſible is it for faire and Saint-like beginnings to ſhut vp in monſtrous impieties? Let him that thinkes hee ſtands, take heed leſt he fall. When did God euer put vp ſo foule ingratitude to himſelfe, to his ſeruants? O Ioaſh, what eye can pitty the fearfull deſtruction of thee, and thy Iudah?
                     If ye haue forgotten the kindneſſe of Iehoiada, your vnkindneſs to Iehoiada ſhall not be forgotten:

                        A ſmall army of Syrians came vp againſt Iudah and Ieruſalem, and deſtroyed all the Princes of the people, and ſent all the ſpoyle of them to Damaſcus. Now Hazael reuenges this quarrell of God, and his anointed; and plagues that people which made themſelues vnworthy to bee the Lords inheritance.
                     And what becomes of Ioaſh? Hee is left in great diſeaſes, when his owne ſeruants conſpired againſt him for the blood of the ſonnes of Iehoiada, and ſlew him on his bed, and he dyed; and they buryed him not in the Sepulcher of the Kings. Dying Zechariah had ſayd in the bitterneſſe of his departing ſoule, The Lord looke vpon it, and require it: I confeſſe I had rather to haue

heard him ſay, The Lord paſſe it ouer, and remit it; ſo ſaid Steuen; ſuch difference there is betweene a Martyr of the Law, and of the Goſpell: although I will hope the zeale of iuſtice, not the vncharitable heate of reuenge drew forth this word: God heares it, and now giues an account of his notice; Thus doth the Lord require the blood of Iehoiadaes ſon; euen by the like vnthankfull hand of the obliged ſeruants of Ioaſh. He that was guilty of abhominable Idolatry, yet (as if God meant to waue that challenge) is called to reckoning for his cruell vnthankfulneſſe to Iehoiada; This crime ſhall make him odious aliue, and ſhall abandon him dead from the ſepulcher of

his fathers; as if this laſt royalty were too good for him, who had forgotten the law of humanity. Some vices are ſuch, as Nature ſmiles vpon, though frowned at by diuine Iuſtice: Others are ſuch, as euen Nature it ſelfe abhorres; ſuch is this of Ingratitude, which therefore caries ſo much more deteſtation from God, as it is more odious euen to them that haue blotted out the image of God.
                  
                  
                     
                     IOASH with ELISHA dying.
                     
                     
                        THe two Kingdoms 2 Kings 13. of Iudah and Iſrael, how euer diuided both in gouernement, and affection, yet loued to interchange the names of their Kings; Euen Iſrael alſo had their Ioaſh, no better then that of Iudah; he was not more the father of a later Ieroboam, then (in reſpect of miſ-worſhip) he was the ſon of the firſt Ieroboam, who made Iſrael to ſin; Thoſe Calues of Dan and Bethel, out of a politick miſ-deuotion, beſotted all

the ſucceſſion of the ten vſurped Tribes: yet euen this Idolatrous King of Iſrael comes downe to viſit the ſicke bed of Eliſha, and weeps vpon his face.
                     That holy Prophet was neuer any flatterer of Princes, neyther ſpared he inuectiues againſt their moſt plauſible ſinnes: yet King Ioaſh, that was beaten by his reproofes, waſhes that face with the teares of loue, and ſorrow, which had often frowned vpon his wickedneſſe.
                     How much difference there was betwixt the Ioaſh of Iſrael, and the Ioaſh of Iudah? That of Iudah hauing beene preſerued and nurtured by Iehoiada the Prieſt, after all profeſſions of dearneſſe ſhuts vp in the vnkinde murther

of his ſonne; and that meerly for the iuſt reproofe of his own Idolatry: This of Iſrael hauing beene eſtranged from the Prophet Eliſha, and ſharply rebuked for the like offence, makes loue to his dying reprouer, and bedewes his pale face with his teares: Both were bad enough, but this of Iſrael was, howeuer vicious, yet good-natur'd: That of Iudah added to his wickedneſſe, an ill diſpoſition, a dogged humor. There are varieties euen of euill men; ſome are worſe at the root, others at the branch; ſome more ciuilly harmleſſe, others fouler in morality. According to the exerciſe of the reſtraining grace, naturall men doe eyther riſe, or fall in their ill.
                     The longeſt day muſt haue his

euening: Good Eliſha, that had liued ſome ninety yeares, a wonder of Prophets, and had outworne many ſucceſſions in the thrones of Iſrael, &amp; Iudah, is now caſt vpon the bed of his ſickneſſe, yea, of his death: That very age might ſeeme a diſeaſe; which yet is ſeconded with a languiſhing diſtemper: It is not in the power of any holineſſe to priuiledge vs from infirmity of body, from finall diſſolution: He that ſtretched himſelfe vpon his bed, ouer the dead carkaſſe of the Shunamites ſonne, and reuiued it; muſt now ſtretch out his owne limmes vpon his ſicke bed, and dye: Hee ſaw his Maſter Elijah rapt vp ſuddenly from the earth, and fetcht by a fiery chariot from this vale

of mortalitie; himſelfe muſt leaſurely wait for his laſt pangs, in a lingring paſſage to the ſame glory. There is not one way appointed to vs, by the diuine prouidence, vnto one common bleſſedneſſe: One hath more paine, another hath more ſpeed: Violence ſnatcheth away one, another by an inſenſible pace drawes euery day neerer to his terme: The wiſedome and goodneſſe of God magnifies it ſelfe in both: Happy is he that after due preparation, is paſt through the gates of death, ere he be aware; Happy is he that by the holy vſe of long ſickneſſe is taught to ſee the gates of death afarre off, and addreſſed for a reſolute paſſage: The one dyes like Elijah, the other like

                        Eliſha, both bleſſedly.
                     The time was, when a great King ſent to Eliſha to know if he ſhould recouer; now the King of Iſrael, as knowing that Eliſha ſhall not recouer (ſo had his conſumption ſpent him) comes to viſit the dying Prophet; &amp; when his teares would giue him leaue; breakes forth into a paſſionate exclamation, O my father, my father, the chariot of Iſrael and the horſmen thereof. Yet the Calues of Dan and Bethel haue left ſome goodneſſe in Ioaſh: As the beſt man hath ſomething in him worthy of reproofe; ſo the faultieſt hath ſomthing commendable. Had not the ſpirit of God himſelfe told vs, that Ioaſh did that which was euill in the ſight of the Lord, wee had

admired this piety, this reuerent reſpect to the Prophet. The holieſt man could not haue ſaid more: It is poſſible for the clients of a falſe worſhip, to honor (out of another regard) the profeſſors of Truth; From the hand of Eliſha had Iehu the grandfather of Ioaſh receiued his vnction to the Kingdome: this fauour might not be forgotten.
                     Viſitation of the ſicke is a duty required both by the law of humanity, and of religion; Bodily infirmity is ſad, and comfortleſſe; and therefore needs the preſence, and counſell of friends to relieue it; Although, when wee draw the curtaines of thoſe that are eminently gracious, wee doe rather fetch (with Ioaſh) then

bring a bleſſing.
                     How ſenſible ſhould wee bee of the loſſe of holy men, when a Ioaſh ſpends his teares vpon Eliſha? If we be more affected with the forgoing of a naturall friend, or kinſman, then of a noted and vſefull Prophet, it argues more loue to our ſelues, then to the Church of God, then to GOD himſelfe.
                     What vſe there was of charets and horſemen in thoſe warres of the Ancient, all Hiſtories can tell vs: All the ſtrength of the battell ſtood in theſe: There could bee neither defence, nor offence, but by them: ſuch was Eliſha vnto Iſrael; The greateſt ſafegard to any nation is the ſanctity, and faithfulneſſe of their Prophets; without

which, the Church and State lyes open to vtter deſolation.
                     The ſame words that Eliſha ſaid of his maſter Elijah, when he ſaw him taken vp from the earth, doth Ioaſh now ſpeake of Eliſha, neere his diſſolution: O my father, my father, the charets of Iſrael, and the horſemen thereof. The words were good; the teares were pious; but where are the actions? O Ioaſh, if the Prophet were thy father, wher was thy filiall obedience? he cry'd downe thy Calues, thou vpheldſt them; he counſell'd thee to good, thou didſt euill in the ſight of the Lord.
                     If the Prophet were the charets and horſemen of Iſrael, why didſt thou fight againſt his holy doctrine? If thou weepeſt for his

loſſe, why didſt thou not weepe for thoſe ſinnes of thine, that procured it?
                     Had thine hand anſwered thy tongue, Iſrael had been happy in Eliſha; Eliſha had beene happy in Iſrael, and thee; Words are no good tryall of profeſſion: The worſt men may ſpeake well: Actions haue onely the power to deſcry hypocrites.
                     Yet euen a Ioaſh thus complying, ſhall not goe away vnbleſſed: This outward kindneſſe ſhall receiue an outward retribution; Theſe few drops of warme water ſhed vpon the face of a Prophet, ſhall not loſe their reward; The ſpirit of propheſie forſakes not the death-bed of Eliſha; Hee calls for bow, and arrowes, and

puts them into the hand of Ioaſh, and putting his hands vpon the Kings hand, hee bids to ſhoot Eaſtward: and whiles the ſhaft flyes, and lights, he ſayes, The arrow of the Lords deliuerance from Syria; for thou ſhalt ſmite the Syrians in Aphek, till thou haue conſumed them: If the weake and withered hand of the Prophet had not beene vpon the youthfull, and vigorous hand of the King, this bow had been drawn in vaine; the ſtrength was from the hand of the King, the bleſſing from the hand of the Prophet: He whoſe reall parable hath made the earth to be Syria, the arrow, reuenge, the archer, Ioash, hath obtained for his laſt boone from God to Iſrael, that this archer ſhall ſhoot this arrow

of reuenge, into the heart of Syria, and wound it to death. When the hand of the King, and of the Prophet drawes together, there cannot chooſe but ſucceſſe muſt follow.
                     How readily doth Eliſha now make good the words of Ioaſh? How truly is he the Charets, and Horſemen of Iſrael? Iſrael had not fought without him, much leſſe had been victorious; If theirs be the indeuour, the ſucceſſe is his: Euen the dying Prophet puts life, and ſpeed into the Forces of Iſrael, and whiles hee is digging his owne graue, is raiſing Trophees to Gods people.
                     Hee had receiued kindneſſe from the Syrians; amongſt them was hee harbour'd in the dearth;

and from ſome of their Nobles, was preſented with rich gifts; but their enmity to Iſrael drowns all his priuate reſpects; he cannot but profeſſe hoſtility to the publique enemies of the Church: Neither can he content himſelfe with a ſingle prediction of their ruine. Hee bids Ioaſh to take the arrowes, and ſmite vpon the ground; hee ſets no number of thoſe ſtrokes; as ſuppoſing the frequēce of thoſe blowes, which Ioaſh might well (vpon his former parabolicall act) vnderſtand to bee ſignificant. The ſlacke hand of the King ſmites but thriſe. So apt we are to be wanting to our ſelues; ſo coldly doe wee execute the commands of God: The ſick Prophet is not more greeued,

then angry at this dull negligence; Doubtleſſe God had reuealed to him (for his laſt gratification) that vpon his feruent prayers, ſo oft as Ioash ſhould voluntarily (after his generall charge) ſmite the earth, ſo oft ſhould Iſrael ſmite Syria. Eliſhaes zeale doth not languiſh with his body: with a fatherly authoritie hee chides him, who had ſtyled him father; not fearing to ſpend ſome of his laſt winde in a myld reproofe, Thou ſhouldſt haue ſmitten fiue or ſix times, then thou hadſt ſmitten Syria till thou hadſt conſumed it, whereas now thou ſhalt ſmite Syria but thriſe. Not that the vnchangeable decree of the Almighty meant to ſuſpend it ſelfe vpon the vncertaine iſſue of Ioaſhes will; but, hee that put this

word into the mouth of his Prophet, puts this motion into the hand of the King, which did not more willingly ſtay, then neceſſarily obey that prouidence wherby it was ſtirred. Euen whiles wee haue our freeſt choyce, wee fall vpon thoſe actions and circumſtances, whereby the iuſt and holy will of our God is brought about. Our very neglects, our ignorances ſhall fulfill his eternall councells.
                     
                        Eliſha dyes, and is buried; his miracles doe not ceaſe with his life: Who can maruell that his liuing prayers raiſed the ſonne of the Shunamite, when his dead bones raiſe the carkaſſe that touched them. God will bee free in his works; he that muſt dye himſelfe,

yet ſhall reuiue another; the ſame power might haue continued life to him, that gaue it by his bones. Iſrael ſhall well ſee that he liues, by whoſe vertue, Eliſha was both in life, and death, miraculous: Whiles the Prophet was aliue, the impetration might ſeeme to be his, though the power were Gods; now that he is dead, the bones can challenge nothing, but ſend the wondring Iſraelites to that almighty Agent, to whom it is all one to worke by the quicke, or dead. Were not the men of Iſrael more dead then the carkaſſe thus buryed, how could they chooſe but ſee in this reuiued corps, an embleme of their owne cōdition? how could they chooſe but thinke, If wee adhere to the

God of Eliſha, he ſhall raiſe our decayed eſtates, and reſtore our nation to the former glory.
                     The Sadduces had as yet no being in Iſrael, with what face could that hereſie euer after looke into the world, when before the birth of it, it was ſo palpably conuinced, with an example of the reſurrection? Intermiſſion of time, and degrees of corruption adde nothing to the impoſſibilitie of our riſing: The body that is once cold in death, hath no more aptitude to a reanimation, then that which is moldred into duſt; Onely the diuine power of the Maker muſt reſtore eyther, can reſtore both: When wee are dead, and buryed in the graue of our ſinne; it is only the touch of Gods Prophets,

applying vnto vs the death and reſurrection of the Sonne of God, that can put new life into vs; No leſſe true, though ſpirituall, is the miracle of our raiſing vp from an eſtate of inward corruption, to a life of grace.
                     Yet all this preuailes not with Iſrael: No bones of Eliſha could raiſe them from their wicked Idolatry: and, notwithſtanding their groſſe ſins, Ioaſh their King proſpers: Whether it were for the ſake of Iehu, whoſe grand-chyld he was; or for the ſake of Eliſha, whoſe face hee wept vpon, his hand is notably ſucceſsfull: not onely againſt the ſon of Hazael, King of Syria, whom hee beates out of the Cities of Iſrael; but, againſt Amaziah King of Iudah,
                        
whom he tooke Priſoner, beating downe the very walls of Ieruſalem, and returning laden with the ſacred, and rich ſpoyle both of the Temple, and Court, to his Samaria.
                     
                     Oh the depth of the diuine Iuſtice, and wiſedome in theſe outward adminiſtrations! The beſt cauſe, the beſt man doth not euer fare beſt: Amaziah did that which was right in the ſight of the Lord; Ioaſh, euill: Amaziah followes Dauid (though not with equall paces) Ioaſh followes Ieroboam, yet is Amaziah ſhamefully foyled by Ioaſh; Whether God yet meant to viſit vpon this King of Iudah, the ſtill-odious vnthankfulnes of his father to Iehoiada; or, to plague Iudah for their ſhare in the blood

of Zechariah, and their late reuolt to Idolatry; or, whether Amaziahs too much confidence in his own ſtrength (which moued his bold challenge to Ioaſh) were thought fit to be thus taken downe, or what euer other ſecret ground of Gods iudgment there might be, it is not for our preſumption to inquire: Who ſo by the euent ſhall iudge of loue, or hatred, ſhall be ſure to run vpon that woe, which belongs to them that call good euill, and euill good.
                     What a ſauage peece of Iuſtice it is to put the right, whether of inheritance, or honor, to the deciſion of the ſword, when it is no newes for the better to miſ-cary by the hand of the worſe?
                     The race is not to the ſwift; the

battell is not to the ſtrong; no, not to the good: Perhaps, God will correct his owne by a foyle; perhaps he will plague his enemy by a victory. They are only our ſpirituall combats wherein our faithfull courage is ſure of a crowne.
                  
                  
                     
                     VZZIAH Leprous.
                     
                     
                        EVen the Throne of 2 Chro. 26 And 2 King, 15. 
                        Dauid paſſed many chāges of good, and euill: Good Iehoſaphat was followed with three ſucceſſions of wicked Princes; and thoſe three, were again ſucceeded with three others godly, and vertuous; Amaziah for a long time ſhone fair, but at the laſt, ſhut vp in a cloud; The gods of the Edomites marred him; his rebellion againſt God, ſtirr'd vp his peoples rebellion againſt him: The ſame hands that

ſlew him, crowned his ſonne Vzziah; ſo as the yong King might imagine it was not their ſpight, that drew violēce vpō his father, but his owne wickedneſſe; Both early did this Prince raigne, and late; he began at ſixteene; and ſat fifty two yeares in the Throne of Iudah: They that mutined in the declining age of Amaziah, the father; are obſequious to the childhood of the ſonne, as if they profeſſed to adore ſouerainty, whiles they hated lewdneſſe: The vnchanged gouernment of good Princes is the happineſſe, no leſſe of the ſubiects then of themſelues: The hand knowes beſt to guide thoſe reines to which it hath beene inured; and euen meane hackneyes goe on cheerfully in

their wonted rode; Cuſtome, as it makes euils more ſupportable, ſo where it meets with conſtant mindes, makes good things more pleaſing and beneficiall.
                     The wiſe and holy Prophet Zechariah, was an happy Tutor to the minority of King Vzziah; That veſſell can hardly miſ-cary where a skilfull ſtereſ-man ſits at the helme: The firſt praiſe of a good Prince is to be iudicious, &amp; iuſt, and pious, in himſelfe; the next is, to giue eare, and way, to them that are ſuch: Whiles Zechariah hath the viſions of God, and Vzziah takes the counſels of Zechariah, it is hard to ſay whether the Prophet, or the King, or the State be happier.
                     God will be in no mans debt;

ſo long as Vzziah ſought the Lord, God made him to proſper. Euen what we doe out of duty cannot want a reward: Godlineſſe neuer diſappointed any mans hopes, oft hath exceeded them. If Vzziah fight againſt the Philiſtims, If againſt the Arabians, and Mehunims; according to his names, the Vzziah, Azariah. ſtrength, the help of the Almighty is with him: The Ammonites come in with preſents, and all the neighbour nations ring of the greatneſſe, of the happineſſe of Vzziah; His bounty and care makes Ieruſalem both ſtrong, and proud of her new Towers; yea the very Deſert muſt taſt of his munificence.
                     The outward magnificence of Princes cannot ſtand firme, vnleſſe

it be built vpon the foundations of prouidence and frugality; Vzziah had not beene ſo great a King, if he had not been ſo great an husband; he had his flockes in the deſerts, and his heards in the plaines; his plowes in the fields, his vine-dreſſers vpon the mountaines, and in Carmel: neither was this more out of profit, then delight, for he loued husbandry. Who can contemne thoſe callings for meanneſſe, which haue beene the pleaſures of Princes?
                     Hence was Vzziah ſo potent at home, ſo dreadfull to his neighbours; his warres had better ſinewes then theirs; which of his predeceſſors was able to maintaine ſo ſetled an army, of more then of three hundred and tenne

thouſand trained ſouldiers, well furniſhed, well fitted for the ſuddeneſt occaſion? Thrift is the ſtrongeſt prop of power.
                     The greatneſſe of Vzziah, and the rare deuices of his artificiall Engines for war, haue not more raiſed his fame, then his heart: ſo is hee ſwolne vp with the admiration of his owne ſtrength, and glory, that he breaks againe; How eaſie it is for the beſt man to dote vpon himſelfe; and to bee lifted vp ſo high, as to loſe the ſight both of the ground, whence he riſes, and of the hand that aduanced him: How hard it is for him that hath inuented ſtrange engines for the battering of his enemies, to find out any meanes to beat downe his owne proud

thoughts? Wiſe Salomon knew what he did, when hee prayed to bee deliuered from too much: Leſt, ſaid he, I be full, and deny thee, and ſay, Who is the Lord? Vpon this Rocke did the ſonne of Salomon run, and ſplit himſelfe; His full ſayles of proſperity caryed him into preſumption &amp; ruine: what may he not now doe? what may he not be? Becauſe hee found his power otherwiſe vnlimited; ouer-ruling in the Court, the Cities, the Fields, the Deſerts, the Armies, and Magazins, therefore he thinkes hee may doe ſo in the Temple too: as things royall, ciuill, husbandly, military paſſed his hands, ſo why ſhould not (thinkes hee) ſacred alſo? It is a dangerous indiſcretion for a man

not to know the bounds of his owne calling: What confuſion doth not follow vpon this breaking of rankes?
                     Vpon a ſolemne day, King Vzziah clothes himſelfe in Pontifical robes, and in the view of that populous aſſembly, walkes vp in ſtate, into the Temple of God, and boldly approching to the Altar of Incenſe, offers to burne ſweet odours vpon it, to the God of heauen: Azariah the Prieſt is ſenſible of ſo perillous an incrochment; he therefore attended with fourſcore valiant aſſiſtants, of that holy Tribe, haſtēs after the King, and finding him with the cenſer in his hand, readie addreſſed to that ſinfull deuotion, ſtayes him with a free, and graue expoſtulation:

There is no place wherein I could be ſory to ſee thee, ô King, but this, where thou art; neither is there any act, that wee ſhould grudge thee ſo much, as this, which is the moſt ſacred; Is it poſſible that ſo great an ouerſight ſhould fall into ſuch wiſedome? Can a religious Prince, trained vp vnder an holy Zechariah, after ſo many yeares zealous profeſſion of piety, be either ignorant, or regardleſſe of thoſe limits, which God hath ſet to his owne ſeruices?
                     Oh, what meanes this vncouth attempt? Conſider, ô deare Soueraigne, for Gods ſake, for thy ſoules ſake, conſider, where thou art, what thou doeſt; it is Gods houſe wherein thou ſtandeſt, not

thine owne; Looke about thee, and ſee, whether theſe vailes, theſe Tables, theſe Pillars, theſe Walls, theſe Pauements, haue any reſemblance of earth: There is no place in all the world whence thy God hath excluded thee, but only this; this he hath reſerued for his own vſe: And canſt thou think much to allow one roome as proper to him, who hath not grudged all the reſt to thee? But if it bee thy zeale of a perſonall ſeruice to God, that hath caried thee hither; alas, how canſt thou hope to pleaſe the Almighty with a forbidden ſacrifice? Which of thine holy Progenitors euer dared to tread, where thy foot now ſtandeth? which of thē euer put forth their hand to touch this ſacred Altar?

Thou knoweſt that God hath ſet apart, and ſanctified his owne attendants; wherefore ſerues the Prieſthood, if this be the right of Kings? Were it not for the ſtrict prohibition of our God, it could ſeeme no other then an honour to our profeſſion, that a King ſhould thinke to dignifie himſelfe by our employment; but now, knowing the ſeuere charge of the great King of heauen, wee cannot but tremble to ſee that cenſer in thine hand; who euer, out of the holy Tribe, hath weilded it vnreuenged? This affront is not to vs, it is to the God whō we ſerue; In awe of that terrible Maieſty, as thou wouldſt auoid ſome exemplary iudgement, O King, withdraw thy ſelfe, not

without humble deprecations, from this preſence; and lay down that interdicted handfull, with feare and trembling; Bee thou euer a King, let vs bee Prieſts; The Scepter is thine, let Cenſers be ours.
                     What religious heart could do other then relent at ſo faithfull and iuſt an admonition? But how hard it is for great perſons to yeeld they haue offended? Vzziah muſt not be faulty; what is done raſhly ſhall be born out with power; He was wroth; and thus expreſſes it: What meanes this ſaucy expoſtulation, O ye ſons of Leui? how dare ye thus malapertly controll the well-meant actions of your Soueraigne? If ye be Prieſts, remember that ye are ſubiects; or

if ye will needs forget it, how eaſie is it for this hand to awake your memory? What ſuch offence can it be for me to come into that houſe, and to touch that Altar, which my royall Progenitors haue made, beautified, conſecrated? Is the God of this place only yours? Why doe ye thus ambitiouſly ingroſſe Religion? If Princes haue not intermedled with theſe holy affaires, it was becauſe they would not, not becauſe they might not; When thoſe lawes were made for the Sanctuary, there were no Kings to grace theſe diuine ceremonies; yet euen then, Moſes was priuiledged: The perſons of Princes (if yee know not) are no leſſe ſacred then your owne. It is your preſumption to

account the Lords anointed, prophane: Conteſt with thoſe, whoſe dry &amp; vnhallowed heads are ſubiect to your power; For me, I will not aske your leaue to bee deuout; Looke yee to your owne Cenſers, preſume not to meddle with mine; In the meane time, can ye thinke this inſolence of yours ſhall eſcape vnreuenged? Can it ſtand with the honour of my ſoueraignty, to be thus proudly checked by ſubiects? God doe ſo to me and more alſo, if. Whiles Vzziah yet ſpeakes, God ſtrikes: Ere the words of fury can come forth of his mouth, the leproſie appeares in his forhead: Leproſie was a moſt loathſome diſeaſe; the forhead is the moſt conſpicuous part: Had this ſhamefull ſcurfe

broken forth vpon his hand, or foot, or breſt, it might haue been hid from the eyes of men; now the forhead is ſmitten with this iudgement, that God may proclaime to all beholders, Thus ſhal it be done to the man whoſe arrogance hath thruſt him vpon a ſacred charge. Publique offences muſt haue open ſhame.
                     It is a dangerous thing to put our ſelues into the affaires, into the preſence of God, vnwarranted; There cannot be a more fooliſh meſpriſion, then, becauſe we are great on earth, to thinke wee may be bold with heauen: When Gods meſſengers cannot preuaile by counſels, intreaties, threats, it is time for God to ſhow his immediate iudgements. Wilfull offenders

can expect nothing but a fearfull reuenge.
                     Now begins Vzziah to be confounded in himſelfe; and ſhame ſtriues with leproſie, for a place in his forehead; The hand of God hath done that in an inſtāt, which all the tōgues of men had attempted in vaine: There needs no further ſolicitor of his egreſſe, the ſenſe of his plague ſends him forth alone: And now he thinks; Wretched man that I am, how haue I angred God, and vndone my ſelfe? I would needs come in like a Prieſt, I now goe forth a leper: the pride of my hart made me thinke my ſelfe worthy the preſence of a God; Gods iuſt diſpleaſure hath now made me vnworthy of the preſence of men:

whiles I affected the altar, I haue loſt my throne; whiles I ſcornfully reiected the aduice and cenſures of Gods miniſters, I am now becomne a ſpectacle of horror, and deformity, to my owne ſeruants; I that would be ſending vp perfumes to heauē, haue made my naſtineſſe hatefull to my own ſenſes. What doe I vnder this ſacred roofe? Neither is Gods houſe now, for mee, nor mine owne; what cell, what dungeon is cloſe enough for me, wherin to weare out the reſidue of mine vnhappy and vncomfortable dayes? O God thou art iuſt, and I am miſerable.
                     Thus with a deiected countenance, and ſad heart, doth Vzziah haſt to retire himſelfe; &amp; wiſhes, that he could be no leſſe hid from

himſelfe, then from others: how eaſie is it for the God of heauen to bring downe the hyeſt pitch of earthly greatneſſe, and to humble the ſtubborneſt pride?
                     Vpon the leaſure of ſecond thoughts, Vzziah cannot but acknowledge much fauour in this correction, and confeſſe to haue eſcaped well; Others, hee knew, had beene ſtrucke dead, or ſwallow'd vp quick for ſo preſumptuous an intruſion: It is happy for him if his forehad may excuſe his ſoule.
                     
                        Vzziah ceaſed not to be a King, when he began to be a leper; the diſeaſe of his forhead did not remoue his Crowne: his ſonne Iotham raigned for him, vnder him; and whiles he was not ſeene, yet

hee was obeyed. The character of ſoueraignty is indeleble, whether by bodily infirmity, or by ſpirituall cenſure: Neither is it otherwiſe, O God, betwixt thee, and vs, if we be once a royall generation vnto thee, our leproſies may deforme vs, they ſhall not dethrone vs: ſtil ſhall we haue the right, ſtill the poſſeſſion of that glorious kingdome, wherin wee are inueſted from eternity.
                  
                  
                     
                     AHAZ with his new Altar.
                     
                     
                        AFter many vnhappy 2 King. 16. changes of the two thrones; Ahaz ſucceedes Iotham in the Kingdome of Iudah: an ill ſonne of a good father; not more the heyre of Dauids ſeat, then of Ieroboams ſinne: Though Iſrael play the harlot, yet who can abide that Iudah ſhould ſin? It is hard not to be infected with a contagious neighbourhood: who euer read that the Kingdome of Iſrael was ſeaſoned with the vicinity of the true religion

of Iudah? Goodneſſe (ſuch as our nature is) is not ſo apt to ſpread: A tainted ayre doth more eaſily affect a ſound body, then an wholſome ayre can cleare the ſicke: Superſtition hath euer bin more ſucceſſefull, then truth; The yong yeares of Ahaz are ſoone miſ-led to a plauſible miſ-deuotiō.
                     A man that is once falne from truth, knowes not where he ſhall ſtay: From the Calues of Ieroboam is Ahaz drawne to the gods of the heathen; yea, now, bulls and goates are too little for thoſe new deities, his owne fleſh and blood is but deare enough; He made his ſon to paſſe through their fire. Where doe we finde any religious Iſraelite thus zealous for God? Neither doth the holineſſe and mercy

of our God require ſo cruell a ſacrifice: neither is our dull, and niggardly hand ready to gratifie him with more eaſie obediences; O God how gladly ſhould wee offer vnto thee our ſoules, and bodies, which wee may inioy ſo much the more, when they are thine; ſince zealous Pagans ſticke not to leeſe their owne fleſh, and blood in an Idols fire?
                     He that hath thus ſhamefully caſt off the God of his fathers, cannot bee long without a fearefull reuenge. The King of Iſrael galls him on the one ſide; the King of Syria on the other: To auoid the ſhocke of both, Ahaz doth not betake himſelfe to the God whō he had offended; who was able to make his enemies at peace

with him, but to Tiglath Pileſer King of Aſhur: Him doth hee wooe with ſuits, with gifts; and robs God of thoſe preſents, which may indeare ſo ſtrong an helper. Hee that thought not his ſon too deare for an Idol, thinkes not Gods ſiluer and gold too deare for an Idolatrous abettor.
                     Oh the infinite patience of the Almighty! God giues ſucceſſe a while to ſo offenſiue a riuality: This Aſſyrian King preuailes againſt the King of Syria; kils him, and takes his chiefe City, Damaſcus; The quarrell of the King of Iudah hath inlarged the territories of his aſſiſtant, beyond hope; And now, whiles this Aſſyrian victor is inioying the poſſeſſion of his new-won Damaſcus: Ahaz
                        
goes vp thither to meet him, to congratulate the victory, to adde vnto thoſe triumphs, which were drawne on by his ſolicitation. There hee ſees a new faſhion'd Altar, that pleaſes his eye; That old forme of Salomons, which was made by the pattern ſhowd to Moſes in the Mount, is now growne ſtale, and deſpicable; A modell of this more exquiſite frame is ſent to Vrijah, the Prieſt; and muſt be ſampled in Ieruſalem. It is a dangerous preſumption to make innouations, if but in the circumſtances of Gods worſhip. Thoſe humane additions which would ſeeme to grace the inſtitution of God, depraue it; That infinite wiſedome knowes beſt what will pleaſe it ſelfe, and preſcribes

accordingly; The fooliſhneſſe of God is wiſer then the wiſedome of men; Idolatry and falſhood is commonly more gawdy and plauſible, then truth; That hart which can for the outward homelineſſe deſpiſe the ordinances of God, is already aliened from true religion, and lyes open to the groſſeſt ſuperſtition.
                     Neuer any Prince was ſo foully idolatrous, at that he wanted a Prieſt to ſecond him: An Vrijah is fit to humor an Ahaz. Greatneſſe neuer could command any thing, which ſome ſeruile wits were not ready both to applaud, and iuſtifie.
                     Ere the King can be returned from Damaſcus, the altar is finiſhed; It were happy if true godlineſſe

could be ſo forward in the proſecutions of good: Neither is this ſtrange pile reared onely, but thruſt vp betwixt Gods altar, and the temple; in an apparent precedency, as if he ſaid, Let the God of Iudah come behind the Deities of Syria.
                     
                     And now, to make vp the full meaſure of his impiety, this idolatrous King will himſelfe be ſacrificing vpon his new altar, to his new gods; the gods of Damaſcus: An vſurped prieſthood well becomes a falſe Deity. Becauſe (ſaith he) the gods of the Kings of Syria helpe them, therefore will Iſacrifice to them, that they may helpe mee.
                     
                     Oh blinde ſuperſtition! how did the gods of Syria helpe their

Kings, when both thoſe Kings, and their gods were vanquiſhed, and taken by the King of Aſſyria? Euen this Damaſcus, and this altar were the ſpoyle of a forraigne enemy; How then did the gods of Syria helpe their Kings, any other, then to their ruine? what dotage is this to make choice of a foyled protection? But had the Syrians proſpered, muſt their gods haue the thanks? Are there no authors of good but blocks or Deuils? Or is an outward proſperity the only argument of truth, the onely motiue of deuotion? O fooliſh Ahaz, it is the God thou haſt forſaken, that plagues thee, vnder whoſe onely arme thou might'ſt haue preuailed. His power beats thoſe Pagan ſtockes, one againſt

other, ſo, as one while, one ſeems victorious, another vanquiſht; and at laſt hee confounds both, together with their proudeſt clients: Thy ſelfe ſhall be the beſt inſtance.
                     Of all the Kings of Iudah hitherto, there is none ſo dreadfull an example either of ſin, or iudgement, as this ſon of good Iotham. I abhor to think that ſuch a monſter ſhould deſcend from the loynes of Dauid; where ſhall bee the period of this wickedneſſe? Hee beganne with the hie places, thence he deſcends to the Calues of Dan and Bethel; from thence he falls to a Syrian altar, to the Syrian god; then from a partnerſhip hee falls to an vtter excluſion of the true God, and blocking vp

his Temple; and then to the ſacrifice of his owne ſonne; and at laſt, as if hell were broken looſe vpon Gods inheritance, euery ſeuerall City, euery hie place of Iudah hath a new god: No maruell if he bee branded by the Spirit of God, with, This is that King Ahaz.
                     
                     What a fearfull plague did this noyſome deluge of ſin leaue behind it, in the land of Iudah? who can expreſſe the horror of Gods reuenge vpō a people that ſhould haue beene his? Pekah the King of Iſrael, ſlew an hundred and twentie thouſand of them in one day; amongſt whom was Maſeiah the ſonne of Ahaz: O iuſt iudgement of the Almighty! Ahaz ſheds the blood of one ſonne

to an idoll: The true God ſheds the blood of another of his ſons, in reuenge.
                     Yet, the hand of the Lord is ſtretched out ſtill:
                     Two hundred thouſand of them were caried away by the Iſraelites captiue to Samaria:
                     
                     The Edomites came, and caried away another part of them for bondſlaues, to their country:
                     The Philiſtims came vp and ſhared the Cities of the ſouth of Iudah, and the villages thereof; Shortly, what other is miſerable Iudah, then the prey, and ſpoile of all the neighbouring Nations? For the Lord brought Iudah low becauſe of Ahaz King of Iſrael, for hee 
                        2 Chr. 28. 19. 
                        made Iudah naked, and tranſgreſſed ſore againſt the Lord: As for the

great King of Aſhur, whom Ahaz purchaſed with the ſacrilegious pillage of the houſe of God, in ſtead of an ayd, hee proues a burden; How euer he ſped in his firſt onſets; now, hee diſtreſſed Iudah, 
                        2 Chr. 28. 20. 
                        but ſtrengthned it not: The charge was as great, as the benefit ſmall: ſooner ſhall hee eate them out, then reſcue them. No arme of fleſh can ſhelter Ahaz from a vengeance.
                     Be wiſe, ô ye Kings, be inſtructed ô yee Iudges of the earth; ſerue the Lord with feare, and reioyce with trembling: Kiſſe the Sonne leſt he be angry, and ye periſh from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little.
                     His ſubiects complaine, that he died ſo late, and, as repenting that

he euer was, deny him a roome in the ſepulchers of Kings: as if they ſaid; the common earth of Ieruſalem is too good for him that degenerated from his Progenitors, marr'd his kingdome, depraued his people, forſooke his God.
                  
                  
                     
                     
                        The vtter Deſtruction of the Kingdome of ISRAEL.
                     
                        
                           IVdah was at a ſore 2 King. 17. heaue, yet Iſrael ſhall miſ-cary before it; ſuch are the ſins of both, that they ſtriue whether ſhall fall firſt; but this lot muſt light vpon the ten Tribes; though the late King of Iudah were perſonally worſe then the moſt of Ieroboams ſucceſſors, yet, the people were generally leſſe euill: vpon whom the incroachments of Idolatry were more by obtruſion, then by conſent,

beſides that the thrones of Iudah had ſome interchanges of good Princes, Iſrael none at all: The ſame iuſtice therefore that made Iſrael a ſcourge to Iudah, made Aſſyria a ſcorpion to Iſrael.
                     
                     It was the quarrell of Iudah that firſt ingaged the King of Aſhur in this warre againſt Iſrael; now he is not ſo eaſily fetcht off; So we haue ſeen ſome eager maſtiue, that hath beene ſet on by the leaſt clap of the hand, but could not bee looſned by the force of ſtaues.
                     
                        Salmaneſer King of Aſſyria comes vp againſt Hoſhea King of Iſrael, and ſubdues him; and puts him to his Tribute: This yoke was vncouth and vnpleaſing; The vanquiſht Prince was neither

able to reſiſt, nor willing to yeeld; ſecretly therefore he treats with the King of Egipt for aſſiſtance, as deſiring rather to hazard his liberty by the hand of an equall, then to inioy a quiet ſubiection vnder the hand of an ouer-ruling power; wee cannot blame Princes to bee iealous of their ſoueraignties; The detaining of his yearely Tribute, and the whiſperings with new confederates, haue drawne vp the King of Aſhur to perfect his own victories: He returnes therefore with a ſtrong power, and after three yeares ſiege, takes Samaria, impriſons Hoſhea, and in the exchange of a wofull captiuity, he peoples Iſrael with Aſſyrians, and Aſſyria with Iſraelites. Now that

abuſed ſoyle hath vpon a ſurfet of wickedneſſe, caſt out her perfidious owners, and will try how it can fare with heatheniſh ſtrangers: Now the Aſſyrian gallants triumph in the Palaces of Samaria and Iezreel; whiles the Peeres and Captaines of Iſrael are driuen manicled through the Aſſyrian ſtreets, and billeted to the ſeuerall places of their perpetuall ſeruitude: Shortly, now the flouriſhing Kingdome of the tenne Tribes is comne to a finall and ſhamefull end; and ſo vaniſhed in this laſt diſsipation, that, ſince that day, no man could euer ſay, This was Iſrael.
                     
                     Oh terrible example of vengeance, vpon that peculiar people, whom God hath choſen forhimſelfe,

out of all the world: All the world were witneſſes of the fauours of their miraculous deliuerances, and protections; All the world ſhall be witneſſes of their iuſt confuſion.
                     It is not in the power of ſleight errors to ſet off that infinite mercy: What was it, ô God, what was it, that cauſed thee to caſt off thine owne inheritance? What but the ſame that made thee to caſt the Angells out of heauen? Euen their rebellious ſins. Thoſe ſins dared to emulate the greatneſſe of thy mercies, no leſſe, then they forced the ſeuerity of thy iudgments: They left all the commandements of the Lord their God; and made them molten Images, euen two Calues; and made a groue and
                        
                        worſhipped all the hoſt of heauen; and ſerued Baal; and cauſed their ſonnes and daughters to paſſe through the fire, and vſed diuination, and enchantments, and ſold themſelues to doe euill in the ſight of the Lord to prouoke him to anger.
                     
                     Neither were theſe ſlips of frailty, or ignorant miſ-takings, but wilfull crimes, obſtinate impieties, in ſpight of the doctrines, reproofes, menaces, miraculous conuictions of the holy Prophets, which God ſent amongſt them: Thy deſtruction is of thy ſelfe, ô Iſrael; what could the iuſt hand of the Almighty doe leſſe then conſume a nation ſo incorrigibly flagitious? A nation ſo vnthankfull for mercies, ſo impatient of remedies, ſo vncapable of repentance:

ſo obliged, ſo warned, ſo ſhameleſly, ſo lawleſly wicked?
                     What nation vnder heauen can now challenge an vndefaiſible intereſt in God; when Iſrael it ſelfe is caſt off? what Church in the world can ſhow ſuch deare loue-tokens from the Almighty as this, now-abhorred, and adulterous ſpouſe? Hee that ſpared not the naturall Oliue, ſhall hee ſpare the wild? It is not for vs ſinners of the Gentiles to be highminded, but awfull.
                     The Iſraelites are caryed captiue into Aſſyria; thoſe goodly Cities of the ten tribes may not lie waſt, and vnpeopled: The wiſedome of the victor findes it fit to tranſplant his owne Colonies thither; that ſo he may raiſe profit thence,

with ſecurity: From Babylon therfore, and Cuthah, and Aua, and Hamath, and Sepharuaim, doth he ſend of his owne ſubiects to poſſeſſe, and inhabit the Cities of Samaria. The land doth not brook her new Tenants: They feared not the Lord; (how ſhould they, they knew him not?) Therefore the Lord ſent Lyons amongst them which ſlew ſome of them: Not the verieſt Pagan can bee excuſed for his ignorance of God; Euen the deprauedſt nature might teach vs to tremble at a Deity; It is iuſt with the Almighty not to put vp neglect, where hee hath beſtowed reaſon.
                     The brute creatures are ſent to reuenge the quarrell of their Maker, vpon worſe beaſts, then

themſelues. Still hath God left himſelfe Champions in Iſrael: Lyons teare the Aſſyrians in pieces; and put them in mind, that, had it not beene for wickedneſſe, that land needed not to haue changed maſters. The great Lord of the world cannot want meanes to plague offenders: If the men bee gone, yet the beaſts are there; And if the beaſts had beene gone, yet ſo long as there were ſtones in the wals, in the quarries God would be ſure of auengers: There is no ſecurity but in being at peace with God.
                     The King of Aſſyria is ſued to, for remedy: Euen theſe Pagans haue learned to know that theſe Lyons were ſent from a God; that this puniſhment is for ſinne;

                        They know not the manner of the God of the land, therefore he hath ſent Lyons among them: Theſe blind Heathen that thinke euery land hath a ſeuerall God; yet, hold that God, worthy of his owne worſhip; yet, hold that worſhip muſt bee grounded vpon knowledge; the want of that knowledge, puniſhable, the puniſhmēt of that want, iuſt, and diuine: How much worſe then Aſſyrians are they that are ready to aſcribe all calamities to nature to chance? that acknowledging but one God of all the world, are yet careleſſe to know him to ſerue him?
                     One of the Prieſts of Iſrael is appointed to bee caried backe to Samaria, to teach the Aſſyrian Colony the faſhions of the God of

the land; not for deuotion, but for impunity: vaine Politicians thinke to ſatisfie God by patching vp religions; any formes are good enough for an vnknowne deity: The Aſſyrian Prieſts teach, and practiſe the worſhip of their own Gods; The Iſraelitiſh Prieſt preſcribes the worſhip of the true God; The people will follow both; the one out of liking, the other out of feare: What a prodigious mixture was here of religions? true with falſe, Iewiſh with Paganiſh, diuine with diuelliſh; Euery diuiſion of theſe tranſplanted Aſſyrians had their ſeuerall deities, high places, ſacrifices; this Prieſt of Iſrael intercommons with euery of them: So as now theſe fathers of Samaritaniſme,

are in at all; They feare the Lord and ſerue their idols: No beggers cloak is more peeced then the religion of theſe new inhabitants of Iſrael. I know not how their bodies ſped for the Lyons, I am ſure their ſoules fared the worſe for this medlie: Aboue all things God hates a mungrell deuotion; If we be not all Iſrael, it were better to bee all Aſhur; It cannot ſo much diſpleaſe God to bee vnknowne or neglected, as to bee conſorted with Idols.
                  
                  
                     
                     HEZEKIAH and SENACHERIB.
                     
                        
                           ISrael is gone, Iudah 
                        2 Kings 18. and 19. is left ſtanding; or rather ſome few ſprigs of thoſe two Tribes: ſo we haue ſeene in the ſhredding of ſome large Timber-tree, one or two boughes left at the top to hold vp the ſap. Who can but lament the poore remainders of that languiſhing kingdome of Dauid?
                     
                     Take out of the two Tribes of Iudah, and Beniamin, one hundred and twenty thouſand, whom

                        Pekah the King of Iſrael ſlew in one day. Take out two hundred thouſand that were caried away captiue to Samaria; Take out thoſe that were tranſported into the bondage of the Edomites; and thoſe that were ſubdued in the South parts, by the Philiſtims; alas, what an handfull was left to the king of Iudah; ſcarce worth the name of a dominion: Yet, euen now, out of the gleeds of Iudah, doth God raiſe vp a glorious light to his forlorne Church; yea, from the wretched loynes of Ahaz, doth God fetch an holy Ezekiah. It had beene hard to conceiue the ſtate of Iudah worſe then it was; neither was it more miſerable, then ſinfull, and in regard of both, deſperate; when beyond

hope, God reuiues this dying ſtocke of Dauid, and out of very ruines builds vp his owne houſe. Ahaz was not more the ill ſonne of a good father, then he was the ill father of a good ſonne. He was the ill ſonne of good Iotham, the ill father of good Hezekiah. Good Hezekiah makes amends for his fathers impietie; and puts a new life into the hartleſſe remnant of Gods people.
                     The wiſedome of our good God knowes when his ayd will bee moſt ſeaſonable, moſt welcome; which hee then loues to giue, when he findes vs left of all our hopes: That mercifull hand is reſerued for a dead lift; then, he failes vs not.
                     Now, you might haue ſeene

this pious Prince buſily beſtirring himſelfe, in ſo late and needfull a reformation, remouing the high places, battering and burning the Idolls, demoliſhing their temples, cutting downe their groues, opening the Temple, purging the altars, and veſſells, ſanctifying the Prieſts, rekindling the Lampes, renuing the incenſe, reinſtituting the ſacrifices, eſtabliſhing the order of Gods ſeruice, appointing the courſes, ſetling the maintenance of the miniſters, publiſhing the decrees for the long-neglected Paſſ-ouer; celebrating it, and the other feaſts, with due ſolemnity, incouraging the people, contributing bountifully to the offerings, and, in one word, ſo ordering all the affayres of God,

as if hee had beene ſent downe from heauen to reſtore Religion; as if Dauid himſelf had been aliue againe in this bleſſed heyre, not ſo much of his Crowne, as of his piety. Oh Iudah, happy in thy Ezekiah, Oh Ezekiah happy in the gratious reſtauration of thy Iudah: Ahaz ſhall haue no thanke for ſuch a ſonne; The God that is able of the very ſtones to raiſe children to Abraham, rayſes a true ſeed of Dauid out of the corrupt loynes of an Idolater: That infinite mercy is not tyed to the termes of an immediate propagation: For the ſpace of three hundred yeares, the man after Gods owne heart had no perfect heyre till now; Till now did the high places ſtand: the deuotions of

the beſt Princes of Iudah were blemiſhed with ſome weake omiſſions; Now the zeale of good Ezekiah cleares all thoſe defects, and workes an intyre change.
                     How ſeaſonably hath the prouidence of God kept the beſt man for the worſt times? When God hath a great worke to doe, hee knowes to fit himſelfe with inſtruments.
                     No maruell if the Paganiſh Idolls goe to vvracke, vvhen euen the brazen Serpent that Moſes had made by Gods owne appointment, is broken in peeces: The Iſraelites were ſtung with fiery Serpents, this brazen Serpent healed them, which they did no ſooner ſee, then they recouered: But now, ſuch was the venome of

the Iſraelitiſh Idolatry, that this Serpent of braſſe, ſtung worſe then the fiery; That, which firſt cured by the eye, now by the eye poyſoned the ſoule; That which was at firſt, the type of a Sauiour, is now, the deadly engine of the Enemy. Whiles it helped, it ſtood; it ſtood whiles it hurt not, but when once wicked abuſe hath turned it into an Idoll; what was it but Nehuſhtan?
                     
                     The holineſſe of the firſt inſtitution cannot priuiledge ought from the danger of a future profanation; nor, as the caſe may ſtand, from an vtter abolition: What antiquity, what authoritie, what primary ſeruice might this Serpent haue pleaded? All that cannot keepe it out of the duſt.

Thoſe things which are neceſſarie in their being, beneficiall in their continuance, may ſtill remaine when their abuſe is purged; but thoſe things whoſe vſe is but temporary, or whoſe duration is needleſſe and vnprofitable, may ceaſe with the occaſion, and much more periſh with an inſeparable abuſe. Ezekiah willingly forgets who made the Serpent, when he fees the Iſraelites make it an idoll: It is no leſſe intolerable for God, to haue a riuall of his owne making.
                     Since Hezekiah was thus, aboue all his Anceſtors, pright with the Lord; it is no maruell if the Lord were with him; if he proſpered, whither ſoeuer hee went; The ſame God that would haue

his iuſtice magnified in the confuſion of the wicked Princes of Iſſrael, and Iudah, would haue his mercy no leſſe acknowledged, in the bleſſings of faithfull Hezekiah.
                     
                     The great King of Aſſyria had in a ſort ſwallowed vp both the Kingdomes of Iudah, and Iſrael; yet not with an equall cruelty; He made Iſrael captiue, Iudah (vpon a willing compoſition) tributary. Iſrael is vaniſhed in a tranſportation, Iudah continues vnder the homage wherein Ahaz left it: Hezekiah had raigned but ſixe yeares when he ſaw his neighbours of Iſrael packing into a miſerable captiuity; &amp; the proud Aſſyrians Lording in their Cities; yet, euen then, when hee ſtood alone, in a corner of Iudah, durſt Hezekiah
                        
draw his necke out of the yoke of the great, and victorious Monarch of Aſſyria; and, as if one enemy had not beene enough, at the ſame time, hee falls vpon the incroaching Philiſtims, and preuailes. It is not to be asked, what powers a man can make, but in what termes he ſtands with heauen. The vnworthy father of Hezekiah had clogged Iudah with this ſeruile fealty to the Aſſyrian; what the conditions of that ſubiection were, it is too late, and needleſſe for vs to inquire, If this payment were limited to a period of time, the expiration acquitted him; If vpon couenants of ayd, the ceſſation thereof acquitted him; If the reforming of religion, &amp; baniſhment of Idolatry ran vnder the

cenſure of rebellion, the quarrell on Ezekiahs part, was holy, on Senacheribs vniuſt: but if the reſtipulation were abſolute, and the withdrawing of this homage vpon none but ciuill grounds, I cannot excuſe the good King from a iuſt offence: It was an humane frailty in an obliged Prince by force to affect a free and independant ſoueraignty.
                     What doe we mince that fact, which holy Ezekiah himſelfe cenſures? I haue offended, returne from mee, what thou putſt on mee will I beare? The comfort of liberty may not be had with an vnwarranted violence. Holineſſe cannot free vs from infirmity: It was a weaknes to doe that act, which muſt bee ſoone vndone with

much repentance, and more loſſe; This reuolt ſhall coſt Ezekiah (beſides much humiliation) three hundred yearely talents of ſiluer, thirty talents of gold: How much better had it beene for the Cities of Iudah to haue purchaſed their peace with an eaſie tribute, then warre with an intolerable taxation.
                     Fourteene years had good Hezekiah fed vpon a ſweet peace, ſauced only with a ſet penſion; now he muſt prepare his pallat for the bitter morſels of warre. The King of Aſſyria is comne vp againſt all the defenced Cities of Iudah; and hath taken them: Ezekiah: is faine to buy him out with too many talents; The poore Kingdome of Iudah is exhauſt,

with ſo deepe a payment; in ſo much as the King is forced to borrow of God himſelfe, for Hezekiah gaue him all the ſiluer that was found in the houſe of the Lord; yea, at that time did Hezekiah cut off the gold from the doores of the temple of the Lord, and from the pillars which he had ouer-laid, and gaue it to the King of Aſſyria. How hard was good Hezekiah driuen, ere he would bee thus bold with his God? Surely if the mines, or cofers of Iudah could haue yeelded any ſupply, this ſhift had beene hatefull; to fetch back for an enemy, that which hee had giuen to his Maker: Onely neceſſity excuſes that from ſacriledge in the ſonne, which will, made ſacriledge in the father: That which

is once deuoted to a ſacred vſe, may not be called backe to a profane: But he whoſe the earth is, and the fulneſſe of it, is not ſo taken with our metals, that hee ſhould more regard our gold, then our welfare: His goodnes cannot grudge any outward thing for the price of our peace: To rob God out of couetouſneſſe, or wantonneſſe, or neglect is iuſtly damnable; wee cannot robbe him out of our need; for then he giues vs all we take; and bids vs ranſome our liues, our liberties; The treaſures of Gods houſe were precious, for his ſake, to whom they were conſecrated, but more precious in the ſight of the Lord was the life of any one of his Saints.
                     
                        
Euery true Iſraelite was the ſpirituall houſe of God; why ſhould not the doore of the materiall tēple be willingly ſtripped, to ſaue the whole frame of the ſpirituall Temple. Take therefore, ô Hezekiah what thou haſt giuen, no gold is too holy to redeeme thy vexation: It matters not ſo much how bare the doores of the Temple bee, in a caſe of neceſſity, as how wel the inſides be furniſhed with ſincere deuotion. O the cruell hard hartedneſſe of thoſe men which will rather ſuffer the liuing Temples of God to be ruined; then they will ranſome their life, with farthings.
                     It could not bee, but that the ſtore of needy Iudah muſt ſoone be drawne dry with ſo deepe an

exaction; that ſum cannot be ſent, becauſe it cannot be raiſed: The cruell Tyran calls for his brickes whiles he allowes no ſtraw; His anger is kindled becauſe Ezekiahs cofers haue a bottome; with amighty hoſt doth he come vp a gainſt Ieruſalem; therefore ſhal that City be deſtroyed by him, becauſe by him it hath bin impoueriſhed; the inhabitants muſt bee ſlaues, becauſe they are beggers.
                     Oh lamentable, and, in ſight, deſperate condition of diſtreſſed Ieruſalem: wealth it had none; ſtrength it had, but a little; all the Country round about was ſubdued to the Aſſyrian; that proud victor hath begirt the wals of it, with an innumerable army, ſcorning that ſuch a ſhouell-full of

earth ſhould ſtand out but one day; Poore Ieruſalem ſtands alone, block't vp with a world of enemies, helpleſſe, friendleſſe, comfortleſſe; looking for the worſt of an hoſtile fury; when Tartan and Rabſaris, and Rabſhakeh, the great Captaines of the Aſſyrians, call to a parlee. Hezekiah ſends to them three of his prime officers, his Steward, his Secretary, his Recorder. Lord; What inſolent blaſphemies doth that foule mouth of Rabſhakeh belch out againſt the liuing God, againſt his anointed ſeruant?
                     How plauſibly doth hee diſcourage the ſubiects of Ezekiah, how proudly doth hee inſult vpon their impotency, how doth he braue them with baſe offers of

aduantage; and laſtly, how cunningly doth he fore-lay their confidence (which was onely left them) in the Almighty, proteſting not to bee comne vp hither without the Lord; The Lord ſaid to me, Goe vp to this land, and deſtroy it; How fearfull a word was this? The reſt were but vaine crackes, this was a thunderbolt to ſtrike dead the heart of Ezekiah; If Rabſhakeh could haue been beleeued, Ieruſalem could not but haue flowne open; How could it think to ſtand out no leſſe againſt God, then men? Euen thus doth the great enemy of mankinde; if hee can diſ-hearten the ſoule from a dependance vpon the God of mercies, the day is his: Lewd miſcreants care not

how they be-lye God for their owne purpoſes.
                     
                        Eliakim the ſteward of Hezekiah well knew, how much the people muſt needes bee affected with this pernicious ſuggeſtion; and faine would therefore, if not ſtop that wicked mouth, yet diuert theſe blaſphemies into a forraigne expreſſion. I wonder that any wiſe man ſhould looke for fauour from an enemy: Speak I pray thee, to thy ſeruants in the Syrian language: What was this but to teach an aduerſary hovv to doe miſchiefe? Wherfore came Rabſhakeh thither but to gall Ezekiah, to vvith-dravv his ſubiects? That tongue is propereſt for him vvhich may hurt moſt; Deprecations of euill to a malicious man

are no better then aduices. An vnknowne idiome is fit to keepe counſell; they are familiar words that muſt conuey ought to the vnderſtanding. Leud men are the worſe for admonitions.
                     
                        Rabſhakeh had not ſo ſtrained his throat, to corrupt the citizens of Ieruſalem, had it not beene for the humble obteſtation of Eliakim; Now he reares vp his voyce, and holds his ſides, and roares out his double blaſphemies; one while affrighting the people with the great power of the mighty king of Aſſyria; another while debaſing the contemptible force of Hezekiah; now ſmoothly alluring them, with the aſſurances of a ſafe and ſucceſsfull yeeldance; then, diſcouraging them with the

impoſſibility of their deliuerance; laying before them the fearfull examples of greater nations vanquiſhed, by that ſword, which was now ſhaken ouer them; triumphing in the impotency, and miſ-cariage of their gods: Who are they among all the Gods of the countries, that haue deliuered their Country out of mine hand, that the Lord ſhould deliuer Ieruſalem out of mine hand? Where are the Gods of Arpad, and of Hamath? Where, but in that helliſh darkneſſe, that is ordained both for them, and for thee, barbarous Aſſyrian, that dareſt thus open thy mouth againſt thy Maker: And can thoſe Atheous eyes of thine ſee no differēce of Gods? Is there no diſtance betwixt a ſtocke, or ſtone, and that infinite

Deity that made heauen &amp; earth? It is enough that thou now feeleſt it; thy torments haue taught thee too late, that thou affrontedſt a liuing God.
                     How did the fingers &amp; tongues of theſe Iewiſh Peeres and people, itch to be at Rabſhakeh; in a reuengefull anſwer to thoſe impieties: All is whuſht; not a word ſounds from thoſe vvalls: I doe not more wonder at Hezekiahs wiſedome, in commanding ſilence, then at the ſubiects obedience, in keeping it; This rayler could not be more ſpighted, then with no anſwer; and if he might be exaſperated, he could not bee reformed; beſides, the rebounding of thoſe multiplyed blaſphemies, might leaue ſome ill impreſſions

in the multitude; This ſulphurous flaske, therefore, dyes in his owne ſmoke: onely leauing an hatefull ſtench behind it.
                     Good Hezekiah cannot eaſily paſſe ouer this deuilliſh oratory; no ſooner doth he heare of it, thē he rends his clothes, and couers himſelfe with ſack-cloth, and betakes himſelfe to the houſe of the Lord, and ſends his officers, and the graueſt of the Prieſts, clad in ſack-cloth, to Eſay the Prophet of God, with a dolefull and querulous meſſage.
                     Oh the noble piety of Hezekiah; notwithſtanding all the ſtraits of the ſiege, and the danger of ſo powerfull an enemy; I find not the garments of this good King, any otherwiſe then

whole, and vnchanged; but now ſo ſoon as euer a blaſphemy is vttered againſt the Maieſty of his God, (though by a Pagan dog) his clothes are torne, and turned into ſack-cloth: There can bee no better argument of an vpright heart, then to be more ſenſible of the indignities offered to God, then of our owne dangers. Euen theſe deſperate reproches ſend Ezekiah to the Temple: The more we ſee Gods name profaned, the more ſhall we, if we be truely religious, loue and honor it.
                     Whither ſhould Hezekiab run but to the Temple, to the Prophet? There, there is the refuge of all faithfull ones, where they may ſpeak with God, where they may bee ſpoken to from God,

and fetch comfort from both: It is not poſſible that a beleeuing heart ſhould bee diſappointed: Iſaiah ſends that meſſage to the good King, that may dry vp his teares, and cheere his countenāce, and change his ſuit; Thus ſaith the Lord, Be not afraid of the wordes which thou haſt heard, with which the ſeruants of the King of Syria haue blaſphemed me; Behold I will ſend a blaſt vpon him; and bee ſhall heare a rumor, and ſhall returne to his owne Land; and I will cauſe him to fall by the ſword in his owne Land.
                     
                     Loe; euen whiles Senacherib was in the height of his iollity &amp; aſſurance; Gods Prophet foreſees his ruine; and giues him for dead, whiles that Tyran thought of nothing but life and victory.

Proud &amp; ſecure worldlings little dreame of the neere approach of their iudgements: whiles they are plotting their deepeſt deſignes, the ouer-ruling iuſtice of the Almighty hath contriued their ſudden confuſion, and ſees, and ſets them their day.
                     
                        Rabſhakeh returnes, and finding the King of Aſſyria warring againſt Libnah, reports to him the ſilent, (and therein) contemptuous anſwer, and firme reſolutions of Hezekiah; In the meane time God pulls Senacherib by the eare, with the newes of the approching army of Tirhakah King of Ethiopia, which was comming vp to raiſe the ſiege; and to ſuccour his confederats: That dreadfull power will not allow the

                        Aſſyrian King, in perſon to lead his other forces vp againſt Ieruſalem, nor to continue his former Leaguer long before thoſe walls. But now, hee writes big words to Hezekiah, and thinks with his thundering menaces to beat open the gates, and leuell the bulwarks of Ieruſalem: Like the true maſter of Rabſhakeh, hee reuiles the God of Heauen; and baſely parallels him with the dunghill deities of the heathen.
                     Good Ezekiah gets him into his Sanctuary; there he ſpreads the letters before the Lord; and calls to the God that dwells between the Cherubims, to reuenge the blaſphemies of Senacherib, to protect and reſcue himſelfe, and his people. Euery one of thoſe words

pierced heauen; which was no leſſe open to mercy vnto Hezekiah; then, vengeance to Senacherib; Now is Iſaiah addreſſed with a ſecond meſſage of comfort to him, who doubtleſſe diſtruſted not the firſt: onely the reiteration of that furious blaſphemy made him take faſter hold, by his faithfull deuotion. Now, the iealous God in a diſdaine of ſo blaſphemous a conteſtation, riſes vp in a ſtile of Maieſty, and gloriouſly tramples vpon this ſaucie inſolency, Becauſe thy rage againſt me, and thy tumult is comne vp into mine eares, therefore I will put my hooke into thy noſe, and my beidle into thy lips: and will turne this backe by the way thou cameſt. Lod, Senacherib, the God of heauen makes

a beaſt of thee, who haſt ſo brutiſhly ſpurned at his name; If thou be a rauenous Beare, hee hath an hooke for thy noſthrils: If thou be a reſty horſe, he hath a bridle for thy mouth; In ſpight of thee, thou ſhalt follow his hooke, or his bridle; and ſhalt be led to thy iuſt ſhame by either.
                     It is not for vs to bee the Lords of our owne actions; Thus ſaith the Lord concerning the King of Aſſyria; He ſhall not come into this city, nor ſhoot an arrow there, nor come before it with ſhield, nor caſt a banke againſt it; by the way that he came ſhal he returne; &amp;c. Impotent men, what are we in the hands of the Almighty? we purpoſe, he ouerrules; wee talke of great matters, and thinke to doe wonders; he

blowes vpon our proiects, and they vaniſh with our ſelues: He that hath ſet bounds to the Sea, hath appointed limits to the rage of the proudeſt enemies; yea, euen the Deuils themſelues are confined; Why boaſt yee your ſelues, ô ye Tyrans, that ye can doe miſchiefe; yee are ſtinted: and euen within thoſe liſts, is confuſion.
                     O the Trophees of diuine Iuſtice, That very night the Angell of the Lord went out, and ſmote in the campe of the Aſſyrians an hundred foureſcore &amp; fiue thouſand; and when they aroſe earely in the morning, behold they were all dead corps.
                     
                     How ſpeedy an execution was this, how miraculous? No humane arme ſhall haue the glory of this victory; It was God that

was defied by that preſūptuous Aſſyrian; It is God that ſhall right his owne wrongs; Had the Egyptian, or Ethyopian forces beene comne vp, though the ſame God had done this worke by them, yet ſome praiſe of this ſlaughter had perhaps cleau'd to their fingers. Now an inuiſible hand ſheds all this blood; that his very enemies may cleare him frō all partnerſhip of reuenge. Go now, wicked Senacherib, and tell of the gods of Hamath and Arpad, and Sepharuaim, and Hena, &amp; Iuah, which thou haſt deſtroyed, and ſay, that Hezekiahs God is but as one of theſe: Goe, and adde this Deity to the number of thy conqueſts: Now, ſay that Ezekiahs God in whom hee truſted hath

deceiued him, and graced thy Tryumphes.
                     With ſhame and griefe enough is that ſneaped Tyran returned to his Niniue, hauing left behinde him, all the pride and ſtrength of Aſſyria, for compoſt to the Iewiſh fields. Well were it for thee, ô Senacherib, if thou couldſt eſcape thus; vengeance waits for thee at home, and welcomes thee into thy place; whiles thou art worſhipping in the houſe of Niſroch thy god, two of thine own ſons ſhall be thine executioners. See now, if that falſe Deity of thine can preſerue thee frō that ſtroke which the true God ſends thee by the hand of thine owne fleſh; Hee that ſlew thine hoaſt by his Angell, ſlayes thee by thy ſonnes:

The ſame Angell that killed all thoſe thouſands, could as eaſily haue ſmitten thee; but he rather reſerues thee for the further torment of an vnnaturall ſtroke, that thou mayeſt ſee too late, how eaſie it is for him in ſpight of thy God, to arme thine owne loines againſt thee.
                     Thou art auenged, O God, thou art auenged plentifully of thine enemies▪ Whoſoeuer ſtriues with thee, is ſure to gaine nothing but loſſe, but ſhame, but death, but hell. The Aſſyrians are ſlaine, Senacherib is rewarded for his blaſphemy: Ieruſalem is reſcued, Ezekiah reioyces, the nations wonder and tremble. O loue the Lord all ye his Saints, for the Lord preſerueth the faithfull, &amp; plenteouſly rewarded the proud doer.
                  
                  
                     
                     HEZEKIAH ſicke, recouered, viſited.
                     
                     
                        
                           HEzekiah was freed 2 King. 20. from the ſiege of the Aſſyrians, but hee is ſurpriſed with a diſeaſe: he that deliuered him from the hand of his enemies, ſmites him with ſickneſſe: God doth not let vs looſe from all afflictions, when he redeemes vs from one.
                     To thinke that Ezekiah was either not thankfull enough for his deliuerance, or too much lifted vp with the glory of ſo miraculous

a fauour; were an iniurious miſ-conſtruction of the hand of God; and an vncharitable cenſure of an holy Prince: For, though no fleſh and blood can auoid the iuſt deſert of bodily puniſhment, yet God doth not alwayes ſtrike with an intuition of ſinne; ſometimes he regards the benefit of our triall; ſometimes the glory of his mercy in our cure.
                     It was no ſleight diſtemper, that ſeized vpon Ezekiah, but a diſeaſe both painfull, and fierce, and in nature deadly. O God, how thou laſheſt euen thoſe whom thou loueſt: Hadſt thou euer any ſuch dearling in the throne of Iudah, as Hezekiah? Yet he no ſooner breatheth from a miſerable

ſiege, then hee panteth vnder a mortall ſickneſſe: when as yet he had not ſo much, as the comfort of a child, to ſucceed him, thy Prophet is ſent to him with the heauy meſſage of his death, Set thine houſe in order, for thou ſhalt dye and not liue. It is no ſmall mercy of God that he giues vs warning of our end; we ſhall make an ill vſe of ſo gratious a premonition, if we make not a meet preparation for our paſſage. Euen thoſe that haue not an houſe, yet haue a ſoule; no ſoule can want important affaires to be ordered for a finall diſſolution; the neglect of this beſt thrift is deſperate. Set thy ſoule in order, ô man, for thou ſhalt dye, and not liue.
                     If God had giuen Ezekiah a

ſon, nature had bequeathed his eſtate; now, hee muſt ſtudy to find heyres: Euen theſe outward things, (though in themſelues worthleſſe) require our carefull diſpoſition, to thoſe we leaue behind vs; and if wee haue delayed theſe thoughts, till then, our ſicke beds may not complaine of their importunity; We cannot leaue to our families a better legacy, then Peace.
                     Neuer was the Prophet Eſay vnwelcome to this good King, vntill now: Euen ſad tidings muſt be caried by thoſe meſſengers, which would be faithfull: neither may wee regard ſo much how they will bee taken, as by whom they are ſent.
                     It was a bold and harſh word

to ſay to a King, Thou ſhalt dye, and not liue: I doe not heare Hezekiah rage, &amp; fret at the meſſage; or threat the bearer, but he meekly turnes his face to the wall, and weepes, and prayes: Why to the wall? Was it for the greater ſecrecie of his deuotion? was is for the more freedome from all diſtraction? was it that the paſſion which accompanied his prayer, might haue no witneſſes? Or, was it for that this wall lookt towards the Temple, which his heart and eyes ſtill moued vnto, though his feet could not?
                     Howſoeuer, the patient ſoule of good Ezekiah turnes it ſelfe to that holy God, from whom hee ſmarts, and bleeds; and poures out it ſelfe into a feruent deprecation,

                        I beſeech thee, O Lord, remember now how I haue walked before thee in truth, and with a perfect hart; and haue done that which is good in thy ſight.
                     
                     Couldſt thou feare, ô Ezekiah, that God had forgotten thine integrity? The grace that was in thee, was his owne worke; could he in thee neglect himſelfe? Or doſt thou therefore doubt of his remembrance of thy faithfulneſs, becauſe hee ſummons thee to receiue the crowne of thy faithfulneſſe, glory, and immortality? wherein canſt thou bee remembred, if this bee to forget thee? What challenge is this? Is God a debter to thy perfection? Hath thine holy cariage merited any thing from that infinite Iuſtice?

Farre, farre were theſe preſumptuous conceits from that humble and mortified ſoule: Thou hadſt hated thine owne breſt, if it could once haue harboured ſo proud a thought. This perfection of thine was no other, then an honeſt ſoundneſſe of hart, &amp; life, which thou knoweſt God had promiſed to reward: It was the mercy of the couenant that thou pleadedſt, not the merit of thine obedience.
                     Euery one of theſe words were ſteeped in teares: But what meant theſe words, theſe teares? I heare not of any ſuit moued by Hezekiah; onely he wiſhes to bee remembred, in that which could neuer bee forgotten, though hee ſhould haue intreated for an obliuion.
                     
                        
Speake out Hezekiah, what is it that thy teares craue, whiles thy lips expreſſe not? O let me liue, and I ſhall praiſe thee, O God.
                     
                     In a naturall man none could wonder at this paſſionate requeſt; who can but wonder at it, in a Saint? whoſe happineſſe doth but then begin, when his life ceaſeth: whoſe miſery doth but then end, when his death enters: the word of faith, is, Oh let me dye, that I may inioy thee. How then doth the good King crye at the newes of that death, which ſome reſolute Pagans haue intertained with ſmiles? Certainly, the beſt man cānot ſtrip himſelfe of ſome fleſh, and whiles nature hath an vndeniable ſhare in him, he cannot but retaine ſome ſmatch of

the ſweetneſſe of life, of the horror of diſſolution; Both theſe were in Hezekiah, neither of them could tranſport him into this paſſion: they were higher reſpects that ſwayed with ſo holy a Prince; a tender care of the glory of God, a carefull pitty of the Church of God; His very teares ſaid; ô God, thou knoweſt that the eyes of the world are bent vpon me, as one that hath abandoned their idolatry, and reſtored thy ſincere worſhip; I ſtand alone in the midſt of a wicked and idolatrous generation, that lookes thorough all my actions, all my euents; If now they ſhall ſee me ſnatcht away in the midſt of my dayes, what will theſe Heathen ſay; how can thy great name but ſuffer in

this mine vntimely extinction?
                     Beſides, what will become of thy poore Church, which I ſhall leaue feebly religious, and as yet ſcarce warme, in the courſe of a pious reformation? how ſoone ſhall it be miſerably ouer growne with ſuperſtition, and heatheniſme; how ſoone ſhall the wild Boare of Aſſyria root vp this little vineyard of thine? What need I beſeech thee, ô Lord, to regard thy name, to regard thine inheritance?
                     What one teare of Hezekiah can run waſt? What can that good King pray for, vnheard, vnanſwered? Senacherib came in a proud confidence to ſwallow vp his citie, and people: prayers and teares ſend him away confounded:

Death comes to ſwallow vp his perſon, (and that not without authority) prayers and teares ſend him away diſappointed. Before Iſaiah was gone out into the midle Court, the word of the Lord came to him, ſaying; Turne againe, and tell Hezekiah the Captaine of my people; Thus ſaith the Lord, the God of Dauid thy father; I haue heard thy prayer, I haue ſeene thy teares; behold I will heale thee; On the third day thou ſhalt goe vp to the houſe of the Lord; and I will adde to thy dayes fifteene yeares.
                     
                     What ſhall we ſay then, ô God, haſt thou thus ſoone changed thy purpoſe? Was it not thy true meſſage which thy Prophet, euen now, deliuered to Ezekiah? Is ſome what falne out that thou

fore-ſawſt not? or, doeſt thou now decree ſomewhat thou meantſt not? The very thought of any of theſe were no better then blaſphemous impiety. Certainly, Hezekiah could not liue one day longer, then was eternally decreed; The decree of Gods eternall counſell had from euerlaſting, determined him fifteene yeeres yet longer: Why then doth God ſay, by his Prophet, Thou ſhalt dye, and not liue? He is not as man that he ſhould repent; the meſſage is changed, the will is not changed; yea rather the meſſage is explicated, not changed; For the ſignified will of God, though it ſound abſolutely, yet muſt bee vnderſtood with condition; that tells Hezekiah what hee muſt expect

frō the nature of his diſeaſe, what would befall him, without his deprecations: There was nothing but death in the ſecond cauſes; what euer ſecret purpoſe there was in the firſt; and that purpoſe ſhall lye hid for a time, vnder a reſerued condition: The ſame decree that ſayes, Niniue ſhall be deſtroyed, meanes, if Niniue repent, it ſhall not be deſtroyed; hee that finds good reaſon to ſay, Hezekiah ſhall dye, yet ſtill meanes, if the quickned deuotion of Hezekiah ſhall importune mee for life, it ſhall be protracted. And the ſame God that hath decreed this addition of fifteene years, had decreed to ſtirre vp the ſpirit of Hezekiah, to that vehement and weeping importunity, which ſhould obtaine

it. O God, thou workeſt thy good pleaſure in vs, and with vs; and by thy reuealed will moueſt vs in thoſe wayes, whereby thou effecteſt thy ſecret will.
                     How wonderfull is this mercy? Hezekiahs teares are not dry vpon his cheekes, yea his breath is not paſſed his lips, when God ſends him a comfortable anſwer. How carefull is the God of compaſſions, that his holy ſeruant ſhould not languiſh one houre, in the expectation of his denounced death? What ſpeed was here, as in the errand, ſo in the act of recouery? within three daies ſhall Hezekiah be vpon his feet; yea his feet ſhall ſtand in the Courts of Gods houſe; he that now in his bed ſighes, and grones, &amp; weeps

out a petition, ſhall then ſing out a thankſgiuing in the Temple. Oh thou that heareſt the prayer, vnto thee ſhall all fleſh come: With what cheerfull aſſurance ſhold we approach to the throne of that grace, which neuer fayled any ſuppliant.
                     Neither was this grant more ſpeedie, then bountifull; wee are wont to reckon ſeuen yeares for the life of a man; and now, behold, more then two liues hath God added to the age of Hezekiah. How vnexampled a fauour is this? who euer but Hezekiah knew his period ſo long before? the fixedneſſe of his terme, is no leſſe mercy, then the protraction; we muſt be content to liue or die at vncertainties; we are not worthy

to calculate the date of our owne times: Teach vs, O Lord, ſo to number our dayes, that we may apply our hearts to wiſedome.
                     
                     There is little ioy in many daies, if they be euill; Ezekiah ſhall not be bleſſed onely with life, but with peace; The proud Aſſyrian threatens an inuaſiō; his late foyle ſtill ſtickes in his ſtomacke, and ſtirs him to a reuenge; the hooke is in his noſthrils, hee cannot moue whither he liſts; The God of heauen will maintaine his owne quarrell: I will defend this City for mine owne ſake, and for my ſeruant Dauids ſake. Loe; for his life, Ezekiah is beholden (next vnder the infinite goodnes of God) to his prayers; for his protection, to the deare memory of his father

                        Dauid; ſurely, for ought we find, Ezekiah was no leſſe vpright, and leſſe offenſiue then Dauid; yet both Ezekiah and Ieruſalem ſhall fare the better for Dauids ſake, aboue three hundred yeares after.
                     To that man after his owne heart, had God ingaged himſelfe, by his gracious promiſe, to preſerue his throne, his ſeed: God loues to remember his ancient mercies: How happy a thing it is to be faithfull with God; this is the way to oblige thoſe which are yet vnborne; and to intayle bleſſings vpon the ſucceſſions of future generations.
                     It ſeemes it was ſome peſtilent vlcer that thus indangered the life of Hezekiah. Iſaiah is not a Prophet

only, but a Phyſician. And Iſaiah ſaid, Take a lump of figs: Hee that gaue an aſſurance of recouery, giues a receit for the recouery. The decree of God includes the meanes: neither can the medicine worke without a word; neither will the word worke without the medicine; both of them muſt meet in the cure: If we ſo truſt the promiſe, that we neglect the preſcript, we preſume to no purpoſe. Happy is that ſoule, that ſo regards the promiſe of Gods Prophets, as that withall he receiues their counſells.
                     Nothing could bee more proper for the ripening of hard and purulent tumors, then dryed figs; Herein Iſaiahs direction was according to nature; Wherefore

ſhould wee balke the ordinary road, when it is both fayre and neere?
                     The ſudden contradiction of the meſſage cauſes a iuſt difficulty in the aſſent. Hezekiah therefore craues a ſigne; not for that he diſtruſted, but that hee might truſt the more; wee can neuer take too faſt hold of thoſe promiſes of God, which haue not more comfort in the application, then naturall impoſſibility in the performance. We beleeue, Lord, helpe our vnbeleefe.
                     The ſicke King hath his option; His father was offred a ſigne and refuſed it; hee ſues for one, and obtaines it: Shall the ſhadow goe for ward ten degrees, or backe ten degrees? As if heauen it ſelfe lay

open to his choyce; and were ready either to mend this pace, or retire for his confirmation; What creature is not cheerfully forward to obey the faith of Gods ſeruāts?
                     
                        Hezekiah faſtens rather vpon that ſigne which is more hard, more diſagreeing from the courſe of nature; not without good reaſon; Euery proofe muſt bee clearer then the thing to bee proued, neither may there want a meet proportion betwixt both; now the going forward of the ſhadow was a motion, no other thē naturall, the recouery of that peſtilent diſeaſe was againſt the ſtreame of nature; the more difficult ſigne therefore, the ſurer euidence.
                     Whether ſhall we more wonder

at the meaſure of the loue of God to Hezekiah, or at the power of Iſaiahs faith in God? Out of both, either the Sun goes backe in heauen that his ſhadow may goe backe on earth: or the ſhadow no leſſe miraculouſly goes backe on earth, whiles the Sunne goes forward in heauen. It is true that the Prophet ſpeakes of the ſhadow, not of the Sun; except perhaps becauſe the motion of the Sun is beſt diſcerned by the ſhadow; and the motion of the ſhadow is led by the courſe of the Sunne: beſides, that the demonſtration of this miracle is reported to be locall in the Diall of Ahaz, not vniuerſall, in the ſenſible length of the day; withall, the retrait of the Sunne had made a

publike and noted change in the frame of nature, this particular alteration of the ſhadow in places limited, might ſatisfie no leſſe without a confuſiue mutation in the face of the world; Whetherſoeuer; to draw the Sun backe together with the ſhadow; or to draw the ſhadow backe without the Sunne was the proofe of a diuine omnipotency; able therefore to draw backe the life of Hezekiah, fifteene degrees, from the night of death; towards which it was haſting.
                     O God, thou wilt rather alter the courſe of heauen and earth, then the faith of thy children ſhall ſinke for want of ſupportation.
                     It ſhould ſeeme the Babylonians finding the Aſſyrian power abated

by the reuengefull hand of Gods Angell, and their owne diſcord, tooke this aduantage of a reuolt; and now to ſtrengthen their part, fall in with Hezekiah King of Iudah, whom they found the old enemy to the Aſſyrians, &amp; the great fauourite of heauen: him they wooe with gifts; him they congratulate with Ambaſſages: The fame of Hezekiahs ſickneſſe, recouery, forme, and aſſurance of cure, haue drawne thither meſſengers, and preſents from Berodach Baladan King of Babylon.
                     
                     The Chaldees were curious ſearchers into the ſecrets of nature, eſpecially into the motions of the celeſtiall bodies; Though there had beene no politicke relations,

this very Aſtronomicall miracle had beene enough to fetch them to Ieruſalem, that they might ſee the man, for whoſe ſake the Sun forſooke his place, or the ſhadow forſooke the Sun.
                     How eaſily haue we ſeene thoſe holy men miſ-caried by proſperity, againſt whom no miſeries could preuaile? Hee that ſtood out ſtoutly againſt all the Aſſyrian onſets, clinging the faſter to his God, by how much he was harder aſſaulted by Senacherib, melteth now with theſe Babylonian fauours, and runnes abroad into offenſiue weakneſſes.
                     The Babylonian Ambaſſadors are too welcome to Ezekiah; As a man tranſported with the honor of their reſpectiue, and coſtly viſitations,

he forgets his teares, and his turning to the wall; he forgets their incompatible Idolatry; ſo hugging them in his boſome, as if there had beene no cauſe of ſtrangeneſſe: All his doores fly open to them; and in a vainglorious oſtentation all his new-gathered treaſures, all his ſtrong armoryes entertaine their eyes; nothing in his houſe, nothing in his Dominion is hid from them.
                     Oh Ezekiah, what meanes this impotent ambition? It is not long ſince thou tareſt off the very plates of the Temple doores, to giue vnto Senacherib; and can thy treaſures be ſuddenly ſo multiplied, that they can be worthy to aſtoniſh forraine beholders? Or, if thy ſtore-houſe were as rich as

the earth, can thy heart be ſo vain as to be lifted vp with theſe heauie metals? Didſt thou not ſee that heauen it ſelfe was at thy becke, whileſt thou wert humbled? and ſhall a little earthlie droſſe haue power ouer thy ſoul? Can the flattering applauſe of ſtrangers let thee looſe into a proud ioy, whom the late meſſage of Gods Prophet reſolued into teares? Oh God, if thou do not keepe vs, as well in our ſunſhine, as in our ſtorme, wee are ſure to periſh: As in all time of our tribulation, ſo in all time of our wealth, good Lord deliuer vs.
                     Alas, how ſleight doth this weakneſſe ſeeme in our eyes, to reioyce in the abundance of Gods

bleſſings? to call in forraine friēds to be witneſſes of our plenty? to raiſe our conceits, ſome little, vpon the acclamations of others, vpon the value of our owne abilities?
                     Lay thine hand vpon thy mouth, ô fooliſh fleſh and blood when thou ſeeſt the cenſure of thy Maker.
                     
                        Iſaiah the Prophet is ſent ſpeedily to Hezekiah, with a ſharpe and heart-breaking meſſage: Behold the dayes come that all that is in thine houſe, and that which thy fathers haue layd vp in ſtore vnto this day, ſhall be caried into Babylon; nothing ſhall be left, ſaith the Lord; And of thy ſonnes that ſhall iſſue from thee, which thou ſhalt beget, ſhall they take away, and they ſhall bee Eunuches in
                        
                        the Palace of the King of Babylon.
                     
                     No ſinne can bee light in Hezekiah: the holineſſe of the perſon addes to the vnholineſſe of the act; Eminency of profeſſion doubles both the offence, and the iudgement. This glory ſhall end in an ignominious loſſe.
                     The great and holy God will not digeſt pride in any, much leſſe, in his owne. That which was the ſubiect of Hezekiahs ſin, ſhall be the matter of his puniſhment; thoſe with whom he ſinned, ſhall be his auengers; It was his treaſure and munitiō, wherin he prides himſelfe to theſe men of Babylon: The men of Babylon ſhall cary away his treaſure and munition; What now doth Hezekiah but tempt them with a glorious

booty; as ſome fond traueler that would ſhow his gold to a Thiefe?
                     Theſe worldly things are furtheſt off from the heart; Perhaps Hezekiah might not bee much troubled with their loſſe: Loe, God comes cloſer to him, yet.
                     As yet was Ezekiah childleſſe; how much better had it beene to continue ſo ſtill, then to bee plagued in his iſſue? He ſhall now beget children to ſeruitude; his loines ſhall yeeld Pages to the Court of Babylon: Whiles he ſees them borne Princes, he ſhal foreſee them made Eunuches in a forraigne Palace: What comfort can he take in the wiſhes and hopes of ſonnes, when ere they bee borne, hee heares them deſtin'd

to captiuitie and bondage?
                     This rod was ſmart, yet good Ezekiah kiſſes it; his heart ſtrucke him no leſſe, then the mouth of the Prophet; meekly therefore doth he yeeld to this diuine correction; Good is the Word of the Lord which thou haſt ſpoken. Thou haſt ſpoken this word, but from the Lord; it is not thine, but his; and being his, it muſt needs bee, like himſelfe, good: Good becauſe it is iuſt, for I haue deſerued more, and worſe; Good, becauſe mercifull; for I ſuffer not according to my deſerts. Is it not good, if there be peace and truth in my daies? I haue deſerued a preſent paymēt, O God thou deferreſt it; I haue deſerued it in perſon, thou reſerueſt it for thoſe whom I cannot

yet ſo feele, becauſe they are not; I haue deſerued war &amp; tumult, thou fauoreſt me with peace; I haue deſeru'd to be ouer-run with ſuperſtition, and Idolatry, thou bleſſeſt me with truth; ſhouldſt thou continue truth vnto me, (though vpon the moſt vnquiet termes) the bleſſing were too good for me; but now thou haſt promiſed, and wilt not reuerſe it, that both truth and peace ſhall bee in my dayes; Lord I adore thy iuſtice, I bleſſe thy mercy.
                     Gods children are neither waſpiſh nor fullen whē they are chid or beaten, but patiently hold their backes to the ſtripes of a diſpleaſed mercy; knowing how much more God is to be magnified, for what he might haue done, then

repined at, for what hee hath done; reſigning themſelues ouer into the hand of that gracious iuſtice, which in their ſmart ſeekes their reformation and glory.
                  
                  
                     
                     MANASSEH.
                     
                        AT laſt, ſome three yeares after his recouery, 2 King. 21. And 2 Chor. 33. 
                        Hezekiah hath a ſonne; but ſuch a one, as if he could haue foreſeene, orbity had beene a bleſſing.
                     Still in the throne of Iudah there is a ſucceſſion, and interchange of good and euill: Good Iotham is ſucceeded by wicked Ahaz; wicked Ahaz is ſucceed by good Ezekiah; Good Ezekiah is ſucceeded by wicked Manaſſeh: Euill Princes ſucceed to good, for the

exerciſe of the Church: and good ſucceed to euill, for the comfort of the Church.
                     The young yeares of Manaſſeh giue aduantage to his miſ-cariage; Euen, whiles he might haue been vnder the Ferule, hee ſwayed the Scepter: Whither may not a child be drawne, eſpecially to a gariſh, and puppet-like ſuperſtition? As infancy is capable of all impreſſions, ſo moſt of the worſt.
                     Neither did Manaſſeh beginne more earely thē he held out long; He raigned more yeares then his good father liu'd: notwithſtanding the miraculous addition to his age; More then euer any King of Iudah, beſides, could reach: Length of daies is no true rule of Gods fauour; As plants laſt longer

then ſenſitiue creatures, and brute creatures out-liue the reaſonable; ſo, amongſt the reaſonable, it is no newes for the wickedly great, to inherit theſe earthly glories, longer then the beſt.
                     There wants not apparent reaſon for this difference; Good Princes are fetcht away to a better Crowne; They cannot bee loſers, that exchange a weake and fading honor, for a perfection and eternity of bleſſedneſſe: Wicked men liue long to their owne diſaduantage; they do but cary ſo many more brands to their hell: If therefore there be a iuſt man that periſheth in his righteouſneſſe; and there bee a wicked man that prolongs his life in his wickedneſſe, farre be it

from vs, either to pity the remouall of the iuſt, or to enuie the continuance of the wicked; This continues to his loſſe, that departs to an happy aduancement.
                     It is very like that Ezekiah marrying ſo late, in the vigour both of his age, and holineſſe, made a carefull choyce of a wife ſutable to his owne piety; Neither had his delight beene ſo much in her (according to her name) if her delight had not beene, as his, in God; Their iſſue ſwarues from both, ſo fully inheriting the vices of his grandfather Ahaz, as if there had beene no interuention of an Ezekiah: So wee haue ſeene the kernell of a well fruited plant degenerate into that crab, or willow, which gaue the originall to

his ſtocke; yet can I not ſay that Ezekiah was as free from traducing euill to his ſonne Manaſſeh, as Ahaz was free from traducing good to his ſonne Hezekiah: Euill is incorporated into the beſt nature, whereas euen the leaſt good deſcends from aboue.
                     We may not meaſure grace by meanes: Was it poſſible that Manaſſeh hauing beene trained vp in the religious Court of his father Hezekiah, vnder the eye of ſo holy Prophets and Prieſts, vnder the ſhadow of the Temple of God, after a childhood ſeaſoned with ſo gracious precepts, with ſo frequent exerciſe of deuotiō, ſhould run thus wild into all heatheniſh abominations; as if there had bin nothing but Idolatry in the ſeed

of his conception, in the milke of his nouriſhment, in the rules of his inſtitution, in the practice of his examples? How vaine are all outward helpes without the influence of Gods Spirit? and that ſpirit breathes where he liſteth: good educatiō raiſeth great hopes, but the proofe of them is in the diuine benediction.
                     I feare to looke at the out-rages of this wicked ſonne of Ezekiah: What hauocke doth hee make in the Church of God? as if hee had beene borne to ruine Religion, as if his onely felicity had beene to vntwiſt, or teare, in one day, that holy web which his father had beene weauing, nine and twenty yeares? and contrarily, to ſet vp in one houre that offenſiue pile,

which had beene aboue three hundred yeares in pulling down: ſo long had the high places ſtood; the zeale of Ezekiah in demoliſhing them honored him, aboue all his predeceſſors; and now the firſt act of this greene head was their reedifiyng: That miſchiefe may be done in a day, which many ages cannot redreſſe.
                     Fearefull were the preſages of theſe bold beginnings; From the miſ-building of theſe chappels of the Hills to the true God, Manaſſeh proceeds to erecting of altars to a falſe: euen to Baal, the God of Ahab, the ſtale Idoll of the heathen; yet further, not content with ſo few Deities; he worſhips all the hoaſt of heauen; and, that hee might deſpight God yet

more, he ſets vp altas to theſe abuſed riuals of their Maker, in the very houſe of the Lord; that holy place doth hee not feare to defile with the grauen Image of the groue, that he had made: Neuer Amorite did ſo wickedly as Manaſſeh; and, which was yet worſe, it ſufficed not to be thus wicked himſelfe, but hee ſeduced Gods people to theſe abominations; and, that his example might moue the more, he ſpares not his owne ſonne from the fire of the Idol ſacrifices. Neither were his witcheries leſſe enormious, then his Idolatry; he obſerued times, hee vſed inchantments, he dealt with familiar ſpirits, &amp; with wizards: Neither were either of theſe worſe then his cruelty; Hee ſhed

innocent blood till hee had filled Ieruſalem from one end to another.
                     O Manaſſeh, how no leſſe cruell wert thou to thine owne ſoule, thē to thy Iudah: What an hideous liſt of monſtrous impiety is here; Any one of which were enough to draw iudgment vpon a world; but what hell is ſufficient for all together?
                     What browes are not now lifted vp to an attentiue expectation of ſome preſent, and feareful vengeance from God, vpon ſuch flagitious wickedneſſe? Therefore thus ſaith the Lord, Behold I am bringing ſuch euill vpon Ieruſalem, &amp; Iudah, that whoſoeuer heareth of it, both his eares ſhall tingle: The perſon of Manaſſeh is not capable of

reuenge enough; as his ſin dilated it ſelfe by an infectious diffuſion to his people, ſo ſhall the puniſhment. Wee are ſenſible of the leaſt touch of our owne miſeries, how rarely are wee affected with other mens calamities? yet this euill ſhall be ſuch, as that the rumor of it ſhall beat no eare that ſhall not glow with an aſtoniſhing commiſeration: What thē ô God, what ſhall that plague be, which thou threatneſt with ſo much preface of horror? I will ſtretch ouer Ieruſalem the line of Samaria, and the plummet of the houſe of Ahab; and I will wipe Ieruſalem as a man wipeth a diſh, wiping it and turning it vpſide downe: And I will forſake the remnant of mine inheritance; and I will deliuer them into the hand
                        
                        of their enemies, and they ſhall become a prey and a ſpoile vnto all their enemies.
                     
                     It is enough ô God, it is enough: What eare can but tingle? what eye can but weepe? what haire can but ſtart vp? what heart can bee but confounded at the mention of ſo dreadfull a reuenge? Can there bee a worſe iudgement then deſolation, captiuity, deſertion, ſpoyle, and torture of preuailing enemies? but howeuer, other Cities and nations haue vndergone theſe diſaſters, without wonder, that all this ſhould befall to thy Ieruſalem, the place which thou haſt choſen to thy ſelfe, out of the whole earth, the lot of thine inheritance, the ſeat of thine abode, whereof

thou haſt ſaid, Here ſhall bee my reſt for euer, it is able to amaze all eyes, all eares.
                     No City could fare worſe then Samaria, whoſe inhabitants after a wofull ſiege, were driuen, like cattle, into a wretched ſeruitude; Ieruſalem ſhall fare no better from Nebuchadnezzar the King of Babylon: Ieruſalem, the glory of the earth, the dearling of heauen, See, ô ye vaine men, that boaſt of the priuiledges of Chaires, and Churches, ſee, and tremble. There is no place vnder heauen to which the preſence of God is ſo wedded as that the ſins thereof ſhall not procure a diſdainfull, &amp; finall diuorce: The height of former fauors ſhall be but an aggrauation of vengeance.
                     
                        
This totall vaſtation of Ieruſalem, ſhall take time: onwards, God begins with the perſon of wicked Manaſſeh; againſt whom he ſtirres vp the Captaines of the hoaſt of the late friend, and old enemy of Iudah: Thoſe thornes amongſt which hee had ſhrouded his guilty head, cannot ſhelter him from their violence; they take him, and binde him with fetters of yron, and cary him to Babylon; There hee lyes loaded with chaines, in an vncomfortable dungeon exerciſed with variety of tortures, fed with ſuch coorſe pittances of bread, and ſips of water, as might maintaine an vn willing life, to the puniſhmēt of the owner. What eye can now pity the deepeſt miſeries of

                        Manaſſeh? What but bondage can befit him, that hath ſo lawleſly abuſed his liberty? What but an vtter abdication can befit him that hath caſt off his God, and doted vpon Deuils? What but a dying life, and a tormenting death can bee fit for a man of blood?
                     Who now wold not haue giuē this man for loſt; and haue lookt when hell ſhould claime her owne? But oh the height, oh the depth of diuine mercy! After all theſe prodigies of ſin, Manaſſeh is a conuert; When he was in affliction he beſought the Lord his God: and humbled himſelfe greatly before the God of his fathers. How true is that word of the Prophet, Vexation giues vnderſtanding; The viper

when he is laſhed, caſts vp his poyſon: The traitor when hee is racked, tells that truth which he had elſe neuer vttered; If the croſſe beare vs not to heauen, nothing can: What vſe were there of the graine, but for the edge of the ſickle, wherewith it is cut downe; the ſtroke of the flayle, wherewith it is beaten; the weight and attrition of the mill, wherewith it is cruſhed; the fire of the ouen wherewith it is baken? Say now, Manaſſeh, with that grandfather of thine (who was, till now, too good for thee) It is good for mee that I was afflicted: Euen thine yron was more precious to thee, then thy gold; thy Gaole was a more happy lodging to thee, then thy palace;

                        Babylon was a better Schoole to thee, thē 
                        Ieruſalem: what fooles are wee to frowne vpon our afflictions? Theſe, how crabbed ſoeuer, are our beſt friends. They are not, indeed, for our pleaſure, they are for our profit: their iſſue makes them worthy of a welcome. What doe wee care how bitter that potion bee which brings health?
                     How farre a man may goe, and yet turne? Could there bee fouler ſinnes then theſe? Lo, here was Idolatrie in the height, violation of Gods houſe, ſorceries of all kinds, bloodie crueltie to his owne fleſh, to the Saints of God; and all theſe againſt the ſtreame of a religious inſtitution, of the zealous counſels of Gods Prophets,

of the checks of his owne heart.
                     Who can complaine that the way of heauen is blocked vp againſt him, when hee ſees ſuch a ſinner enter? Say the worſt againſt thy ſelfe, ô thou clamorous foule; Here is one that murdered men, defied God, worſhipt Diuels; and yet finds the way to repentance; if thou bee worſe then he, deny (if thou canſt) that to thy ſelfe, which God hath not denied to thee, capacitie of grace: In the meane time; know that it is not thy ſinne, but thine impenitence that barres heauen againſt thee.
                     Preſume not yet, ô man, whoſoeuer thou art, of the libertie of thy conuerſion; as if thou couldeſt

run on lawleſly in a courſe of ſinning, till thou come to the brim or hell; and then couldſt ſuddenly ſtop, and returne at leaſure: the mercy of God did neuer ſet period to a wilfull ſinner; neither yet did his owne corrupt deſires; ſo as when he is gone the furtheſt, he could yet ſtay himſelfe from another ſtep: No man that truly repents is refuſed: but many a one ſins ſo long, that he cannot repent. His cuſtome of wickedneſs hath obdur'd his hart, &amp; made it flint to all good impreſſions. There were Ieroboams, and Abijams, and Ahabs, and Ioaſhes, &amp; Ahazes, in theſe ſacred thrones, there was but one Manaſſeh: God hath not left in any mans hād the reines of his owne hart, to pace, &amp;

turne, and ſtop as hee liſts; This priuiledge is reſerued to him that made it; It is not of him that wils, nor of him that runs, but of God that ſhowes mercy: and that mercy neglected, iuſtly binds ouer to iudgement.
                     I wonder not at Manaſſeh, either ſinning, or repenting, I wonder at thy goodneſſe, ô Lord; who after thy iuſt permiſſion of his ſinne, calleſt him thus graciouſly to repent, and ſo graciouſly receiueſt him repenting: So as Manaſſeh was not a more loathſome and monſtrous ſpectacle of wickedneſſe, then he is now a pleaſing and vſefull patterne of conuerſion; Who can now deſpaire of thy mercie, ô God, that ſees the teares of a Manaſſeh accepted? whē
                        
wee haue debauched our worſt; our euill cannot match with thy goodneſſe; rather it is the praiſe of thine infinite ſtore, that where ſinne abounds, grace abounds much more; O keepe vs from a preſumption of grace, that wee may repent; and raiſe vs from a diſtruſt of grace when wee haue repented.
                     No ſooner is Manaſſeh penitent, then he is free; his prayers haue at once looſed him from his ſinnes, and from his chaines; and of a captiue haue made him a King; and from the dungeon of Babylon haue reſtored him to the palace of Ieruſalem: How eaſie is it for the ſame hand that wounds to cure: What cannot feruent prayers doe, eyther for our reſcuing

from euill, or for our inueſting with good?
                     
                        Then Manaſſeh knew that the Lord he was God. Then? and not before? Could his yonger eares eſcape the knowledge of Gods miraculous deliuerance of Ieruſalem from the Aſſyrians? Could hee but know the ſlaughter that Gods Angell made in one night, of an hundred foureſcore and fiue thouſand? Could he but haue heard the iuſt reuenge vpon Senacherib? Could he be ignorant of his fathers ſupernaturall recouery? Could hee but ſee that euer-laſting monument of the noted degrees in the Dyall of Ahaz? Could he auoid the ſenſe of thoſe fifteene yeares, which were ſuper-added to his fathers age? What one of theſe

proofes doth not euince a Deity? Yet, till his owne ſmart, and cure, Manaſſeh knew not that the Lord was God.
                     Fooliſh ſinners pay deare for their knowledge; neither will indure to be taught good-cheape: ſo we haue ſeene reſty horſes that will not moue till they bleed with the ſpur: So we haue ſeene dull and careleſſe children, that will learne nothing but what is put into them with the rod.
                     The Almighty wil be ſure to be knowne for what he is: if not by faire meanes, yet by foule; If our proſperity, and peace, and ſweet experience of his mercy can win vs to acknowledge him, it is more for our eaſe, but, if we will needes bee taught by ſtripes, it is

no leſſe for his glory.
                     
                        Manaſſeh now returnes another man to Ieruſalem: With what indignation doth hee looke vpon his old follies? and now, all the amends he can make, is to vndoe what he did; to doe that which hee vndid: Hee tooke away the ſtrange Gods, and the Idoll out of the houſe of the Lord, and all the altars that he had built in the mount of the houſe of the Lord, and in Ieruſalem, and caſt them out of the City. True repentance beginnes to decline at the ablatiue; deſtroying thoſe monuments of ſhame which former errour had reared; The thornes muſt firſt be ſtubbed vp, ere the ground can be capable of ſeed; The true method of grace, is, firſt, Ceaſe to doe euill; then,

                        Learne to doe good.
                     
                     In vaine had Manaſſeh profeſſed a repentance, if the ſtrange gods had ſtill held poſſeſſion of Ieruſalem, if the Idoll had ſtill harboured in Gods Temple, if forraigne altars had ſtill ſmoked vpon the holy mountaine; Away with all this traſh, when once Manaſſeh comes to a true ſenſe of piety.
                     There is nothing but hypocriſie in that penitent, who after all vowes, and teares, retaines his old abhominations; It is that poore peece of ſatisfactiō which we can giue to the diuine iuſtice, in an hearty indignation, to fling downe that cup of wickedneſſe wherewith wee haue beene bewitched, and to trample vpon the

ſhreads: without which, confeſſion is but winde, and the drops of contrition, water.
                     The liuing God loues to dwell cleane, hee will not come vnder the roofe of Idols, nor admit Idols to come vnder his: Firſt therfore, Manaſſeh caſts out the ſtrange Gods and Idols, and altars; and then, He repaires the Altar of the Lord, and ſacrifices thereon peace-offerings, and thanke-offerings. Not, till he had pull'd down, might he build; and when hee had pull'd downe, hee muſt build: True repentance is no leſſe actiue of good. What is it the better, if when the Idolatrous altars are defaced, the true God hath not an Altar erected to his Name? In many Altars was ſuperſtition,

in no altars, Atheiſme.
                     Neither doth penitent Manaſſeh build God a new Altar, but hee repaires the old, which by long diſ-vſe lay waſt, and was moſſie &amp; mouldred with age &amp; neglect.
                     God loues well his owne inſtitutions; neither can he abide innouations, ſo much as in the out-ſides of his ſeruices. It is an happy worke to vindicate any ordinance of God from the iniurie of times, and to reſtore it to the originall glory.
                     What haue our pious gouernors done other in religion? had wee gone about to lay a new foundation, the worke had been accurſed; now wee haue onely ſcraped off ſome ſuperfluous moſſe, that was growne vpon

theſe holy ſtones, we haue cemented ſome broken peeces, we haue pointed ſome crazie corners with wholſome morter, in ſtead of baſe clay, wherewith it was diſgracefully patched vp: The altar is old, it is Gods altar: It is not new, not ours: If we haue layd one new ſtone in this ſacred building, let it flye in our faces, and beat out our eyes.
                     On this repaired altar doth Manaſseh ſend vp the ſacrifices of his peace, of his thankfulneſſe; and doubtleſſe the God of heauen ſmels a ſweet ſauour of reſt; No perfume is ſo pleaſing to God, as that which is caſt in by a penitent hand.
                     It had not ſerued the turne that Manaſseh had approched alone to

this renued altar; As his leud example had withdrawn the people from their God; ſo now he commands Iudah to ſerue the Lord God of Iſrael; Had he been ſilent, he could not haue been vnfollowed: Euery act of greatneſſe is preceptiue; but now that religion is made Law, what Iſraelite will not be deuout?
                     The true God hath now no competitour in Iudah; All the Idolls are pull'd downe, the high places will not be pull'd downe; An ill guiſe is eaſilie taken vp, it is not ſo eaſily left. After a common deprauation of religion, it is hard to returne vnto the firſt purity: as when a garmēt is deeply ſoiled, it cannot without many lauers recouer the former cleanneſſe.
                  
                  
                     
                     IOSIAH'S Reformation.
                     
                     
                        YEt, if wee muſt alter 2 King. 22. And 23. from our ſelues, it is better to bee a Manaſſeh, then a Ioaſh: Ioaſh beganne well, and ended ill: Manaſſeh began ill, and ended well; his age varied from his youth, no leſſe, then one mans condition can varie from another; His poſterity ſucceeded in both; Amnon his ſonne ſucceeded in the ſinnes of Manaſsehs youth; Ioſiah his grandchild ſucceeded in the vertues of his age. What a vaſt differēce doth grace make in the ſame age? Manaſſeh began his reigne at twelue

yeares; Ioſiah at eight; Manaſſeh was religiouſly bred vnder Hezekiah; Ioſiah was miſ-nurtured vnder Amnon; and yet Manaſſeh runs into abſurd Idolatries, Ioſiah is holie and deuout. The Spirit of God breathes freely; not confining it ſelfe to times, or meanes.
                     No rules can bind the hands of the Almightie; It is in ordinarie proofe too true a word, that was ſaid of old, Woe be to thee, O Land, whoſe King is a child: the goodneſſe of God makes his owne exceptions; Iudah neuer fared better, then in the green years of a Ioſiah: If wee may not rather meaſure youth, and age by gouernment, and diſpoſition, then by yeares: Surely thus, Ioſiah was older with ſmooth cheekes, then

                        Manaſſeh with gray haires. Happy is the infancie of Princes, when it falls into the hands of faithfull Counſellors.
                     A good patterne is no ſmall helpe for young beginners; Ioſiah ſets his father Dauid before him, not Amnon, not Manaſſeh: Examples are the beſt rules for the inexperienced; where their choice is good, the directions are eaſieſt: The lawes of God are the wayes of Dauid; Thoſe lawes were the rule, theſe wayes were the practice; Good Ioſiah walkes in all the wayes of his Father Dauid.
                     
                     Euen the minority of Ioſiah was not idle; we cannot be good too early: At eight yeares it was enough to haue his eare open to heare good counſaile; to haue his

eies &amp; hart opē to ſeek after God: At twelue, he begins to act: and ſhowes well that hee hath found the God he ſought: Then he addreſſes 2. Chro 34. 3. himſelfe to purge Iudah, and Ieruſalem, from the high places, groues, images, altars, wherewith it was defiled; burning the bones of the idolatrous Prieſts vpon their altars; ſtrawing the aſhes of the idols vpon the graues of them that had ſacrificed to them, ſtriuing by thoſe fires, and mattocks to teſtifie his zealous deteſtation of all idolatry.
                     The houſe muſt firſt be clenſed, ere it can bee garniſhed; no man will caſt away his coſt vpon vncleane heaps; ſo ſoone as the Temple was purged, Ioſiah bends his thoughts vpon the repayring,

and beautifying of this houſe of the Lord.
                     What ſtir was there in Iudah, wherein Gods Temple ſuffered not? Sixe ſeuerall times was it pillaged, whether out of force, or will: Firſt, Iehoaſh King of Iudah is faine by the ſpoile of it to ſtop the mouth of Hazael; Then, Ioaſh King of Iſrael fils his owne hands with that ſacred ſpoile, in the dayes of Amaziah; after this, Ahaz rifles it for Tiglath Pileſer, King of Aſſyria; then Hezekiah is forced to ranſacke the treaſures of it for Senacherib; yet after, the ſacriledge of Manaſseh makes that booty of it, which his later times indeuoured to reſtore; and now laſtly, Amnon his ſonne neglects the frame, embeazels the furniture

of this holy place: The very pile began to complaine of age and vnreſpect: Now comes good Ioſiah, and in his eighteenth yeare (when other young Gallants would haue thought of nothing but pleaſure, and iollity) takes vp the lateſt care of his father Dauid, and giues order for the repayring of the Temple.
                     The keepers of the doore haue receiued the contribution of all faithfull Iewes, for this pious vſe; the King ſends Shaphan the ſcribe to Hilkijah the Prieſt to ſumme it vp, and to deliuer it vnto Carpenters, and Maſons, for ſo holy a worke.
                     How well doth it beſeeme the care of a religious Prince, to ſet the Prieſts and Scribes in hand

with reedifying the Temple? The command is the Kings, the charge is the high-Prieſts, the execution is the workmens; when the laborers are faithfull in doing the worke, and the high Prieſt in directing it, and the King in inioining it, Gods Houſe cannot faile of an happy perfection; but when any of theſe ſlackens, the buſineſſe muſt needs languiſh.
                     How God bleſſes the deuout indeuours of his ſeruants? Whiles Hilkijah was diligently ſuruaying the breaches and the reparation of the Temple, hee lights vpon the booke of the Law: The authenticke and originall Booke of Deut. 31. 26. Gods Law was by a ſpeciall charge appointed to be carefully kept within a ſafe ſhrine, in the

Sanctuary: In the depraued times of idolatry, ſome faithfull Prieſt (to make ſure worke) had locked it faſt vp, in ſome ſecret corner of the Temple, from the reach of all hands, of all eyes: as knowing how impoſſible it was, that diuine monument could otherwiſe eſcape the fury of prophane guiltineſſe: Some few tranſcripts there were doubtleſſe, (parcels of this ſacred Book) in other hands; neither doubt I, but as Hilkijah had been formerly well acquainted with this holy volume (now of long time hid) ſo the eares of good Ioſiah had beene inured to ſome paſſages thereof; but the whole body of theſe awfull Records, ſince the late night of Idolatrous confuſion, and perſecution

ſaw no light, till now; This precious treaſure doth Hilkijah find, whiles he digs for the Temple: Neuer man laboured to the reparation of Gods Church, but he met with a bleſſing more thē he looked for.
                     
                        Hilkijah the Prieſt, and Shaphan the ſcribe do not ingroſſe this invaluable wealth into their owne hands, nor ſuppreſſe theſe more then ſacred roles, for their owne aduantage; but tranſ-mit them, firſt to the eares of the King, then by him, to the people: It is not the praiſe of a good ſcribe, to lay vp, but to bring forth, both old and new: And if the Prieſts lips ſhall keepe knowledge, they keep it to impart, not to ſmother: The people ſhall ſeeke the Law at his
                        
                        mouth; for hee is the meſſenger of the Lord of Hoſts.
                     
                     So ſoone as the good King heares the words of the booke of the Law, and in ſpeciall, thoſe dreadfull threats of iudgement, denounced againſt the Idolatries of his Iudah; he rends his clothes, to ſhow his heart rent with ſorrow, and fearfull expectation of thoſe plagues; and waſhes his boſome with teares. Oh gracious tenderneſſe of Ioſiah: he doth but once heare the Law read, and is thus humbled; humbled for his fathers ſins, for the ſins of his people: how many of vs, after a thouſand hammerings of the menaces of Gods Law, vpon our guilty ſoules, continue yet inſenſible of our danger? The very reading

of this Law doth thus affect him; the preaching of it ſtirs not vs; The ſinnes of others ſtrucke thus deepe with him; our owne are ſleighted by vs: A ſoft hart is the beſt tempered for God: So Phyſitians are wont to like thoſe bodies beſt, which are eaſieſt to worke vpon: O God make our clay, waxe, and our waxe pliable to thine hand; ſo ſhall we be ſure to be free either from ſin, or from the hurt of ſin.
                     It is no holy ſorrow that ſends vs not to God; Ioſiah is not moaped with a diſtractiue griefe, or an aſtoniſhing feare, but in the height of his paſſion, ſends fiue choice meſſengers to Huldah the Propheteſſe, to enquire of the Lord, for himſelfe, for Iudah: It is

an happie trouble that driues vs to this refuge. I doe not heare any of theſe Courtiers reply to this godly motion of their young King: Alas, Sir, what meanes this deepe perplexity? What needs all this buſie inquiſition? If your father were idolatrous, what is that to you, who haue abandoned his ſinnes? If your people were once idolatrous, what is that to you, yea to them, who haue expiated theſe crimes by their repentance? Haue you not carefully reformed all thoſe abuſes? hath not your happy reformatiō made an abūdant amends for thoſe wrongs? Spare your teares, and ſaue the labor of your meſſengers; All is well, all ſhall be well; theſe iudgements are for

the obſtinate; had we beene ſtill guilty, theſe feares had been iuſt: were wee ſtill in danger, what had we gained by our conuerſion? Rather, as glad to ſecond the religious cares of their young King, they feed his holy anxieties with a iuſt aggrauation of perill; and by their good counſell, whet theſe his zealous deſires of a ſpeedy reſolution: That ſtate cannot but be happy, whoſe Prieſts and Peeres are ready as to ſuggeſt, ſo to cheriſh, and execute the deuout proiects of their Soueraignes.
                     The graue Prieſt, the learned ſcribe, the honourable Courtiers doe not diſdaine to knocke at the doore of a Propheteſſe: Neither doth any of them ſay; It were hard if wee ſhould not haue as much

acquaintance with God, as a woman; but in an humble acknowledgement of her Graces, they come to learne the will of God, from her mouth: True piety is modeſt, and ſtands not vpon termes of reputation, in the buſineſſes of God; but willingly honors his gifts in any ſubiect, leaſt of all in it ſelfe.
                     The ſexe is not more noted in Huldah, then the condition; As ſhe was a woman, ſo a wife; the wife of Shallum: Holy matrimony was no hindrance to her diuine reuelations; ſhe was at once a Propheteſſe in her colledge, an huſwife in her family; It was neuer the practice of God to confine his graces to virginitie: At this very time the famous Prophet

                        Ieremy flouriſhed, ſome years had he already ſpent in this publike ſeruice; why was not he rather conſulted by Ioſiah? It is not vnlike that ſome propheticall imployments called him away, at this time from Ieruſalem: His preſence could not haue beene balked: purpoſely, doubtleſſe doth God caſt this meſſage vpon the point of that abſence, that hee might honor the weaker veſſell with his diuine oracle; and exerciſe the humility of ſo great clients: In the anſwers of God, it is not to be regarded, who ſpeakes, but from whom: The iniury redounds to God, if the weakneſſes of the perſon cauſe vs to vndervalue the authority of the function.
                     
                        
As Ioſiah and his meſſengers do not deſpiſe Huldah, becauſe ſhee was a woman; ſo Huldah doth not flatter Ioſiah, becauſe a King: Goe tell the man that ſent you; Thus ſaith the Lord: Behold I will bring euill vpon this place. Loe, hee that was as God to his ſubiects, is but as a man to the Propheteſſe: neither is the meſſage euer the ſweeter, becauſe it is required by a Prince: No circumſtance may vary the forme of diuine truth.
                     Euill muſt befall Ieruſalem and Iudah, yea, all the words of that booke, muſt allight vpon the inhabitants of both: In how bad a caſe we may bee, and yet thinke our ſelues not ſafe onely, but happy? Theſe Iewes had forgotten their old reuolts; and now hauing

framed themſelues to holy courſes; promiſed themſelues nothing but peace, when the Propheteſſe foreſees, and foretels their approching ruine: Euen their old ſcore muſt be paid, after the opinion of a cleer agreement. In vaine ſhall wee hope to quit our arrerages by prorogation. This Propheteſſe had immediate viſions from God, yet ſhee muſt ſpeake out of the Booke; There was neuer any reuelation from the Lord, that croſſed his writings: His hand, and his tongue agree eternally: If that booke haue curſed Iudah, ſhe may not abſolue it.
                     Yet, what a gracious mixture was here of mercy, with ſouerity; ſeuerity to Iudah, mercy to Ioſiah;
                        
                        Iudah ſhall be plagued, and ſhall become a deſolation, and a curſe; Ioſiah ſhall bee quietly houſed in his graue, before this ſtorme fall vpon Iudah: His eye ſhall not ſee, what his people ſhall feele: It is enough that the expectation of theſe euills afflicts him, the ſenſe ſhall not.
                     Whence is this indulgence? Becauſe thine heart was tender, and thou haſt humbled thy ſelfe before the Lord. How happy a thing it is to bee a reed vnto Gods iudgements, rather then an oake, the meeke and gentle reed ſtoops and therefore ſtands, the oake ſtands ſtiffely out againſt the ſtrongeſt guſt, and therefore is turned vp by the roots: At leaſt, let vs lament thoſe ſins wee haue not auoyded;

and mourne for the ſins of others, whiles wee hate our owne.
                     He that found himſelfe exempted from this vengeance, by his repentance and deepe humiliatiō, would faine find the fame way for the deliuerance of his people: The ſame words of the Law therefore, that had wrought vpon his heart, are by him cauſed to be publikely read in the eares of Iudah, and Ieruſalem; The aſſembly is vniuerſall, of Prieſts, Prophets, people, both ſmall and great; becauſe the ſin was ſuch, the danger was ſuch: that no man may complaine to want information, the Law of God ſoūds in euery eare. If our eare be ſhut to the Law, the ſin is ours; but if the Law be ſhut

to our eares, the ſin is of our gouernors: Woe be to them that hide Gods booke from the people, as they would doe rats-bane from the eye of children: Ignorant ſoules cannot periſh without their murder: There is no feare of knowing too much, there is too much feare of practizing too little: Now, if the people doe not imitate their King in relenting, they are not worthy to partake with him in his impunitie. Howſoeuer, they ſhall not want a great example; as of ſorrow, ſo of amendment. Good Ioſiah ſtands by the pillar, and ſolemnly renewes his Couenant with his God; the people cannot for ſhame refuſe to ſecond him: Euen they that lookt for a deſtruction,

yet doe not with-draw their obedience; Gods Children may not be ſullen vnder his corrections, but whether they expect or feele ſmart, are no other then dutifull to his awfull hand. As a man that findes hee hath done ſomething that might indanger the forfait of his fauour, puts himſelfe into ſome deſeruing action, whereby hee may hope to re-indeare himſelfe, ſo doth Ioſiah here; No indeauor is enough to teſtifie his zeale to that name of God which was ſo profaned by his peoples Idolatry; What euer monuments were yet remaining of wicked Paganiſme, hee defaces with indignation; hee burnes the veſſels of Baal, and puts downe his Chemarim, deſtroyes the houſes

of the Sodomites, ſtrawes the powder of their idols in the brooke Kedron, defiles Topheth, takes away the horſes, of the Sun, burns the charets of the Sun with fire, and omits nothing that might reconcile God, cleare Iudah, perfit a reformation.
                     Neither is this care confined to Ieruſalem, and the neighboring Townes, but ſtretches it ſelfe to the vtmoſt coaſts of Ioſiahs Kingdome; Bethel was the infamous ſeat of the pollution of Iſrael; it ſeemes the heyres of Ieroboam (who ſet vp his goldē calfe there) inioyed it not long; the Kings of Iudah recouered it to their crown, but, it had not yet recouered it ſelfe from that ancient infection: Thither doth good Ioſiah ſend the

vnhallowed aſhes of Baals Reliques, to ſtaine that altar firſt, which hee will ſoone after deface.
                     The time was, and it was no leſſe then three hundred and fiftie yeares ſince, that the man of God, out of Iudah, cried againſt Ieroboams altar;
                     
                        O Altar, Altar; Thus ſaith the 
                        1 Kin. 13. 2 
                        Lord; Behold a Child ſhall be borne, vnto the Houſe of Dauid, Ioſiah by name, and vpon thee ſhall he offer the Prieſts of the high-places, that burne incenſe vpon thee, and mens bones ſhall be burnt vpon thee.
                     
                     And now is the houre come, wherein euerie of thoſe words ſhall bee accompliſhed: It could not but bee a great confirmation to Ioſiah, to ſee that God had ſo

long agoe fore-markt him for his owne; and fore-nam'd him to ſo zealous a ſeruice.
                     All our names are equally fore-known of that diuine prouidēce, though not fore-ſpoken: neither can any act paſſe from vs, which was not pre-determined in that eternall Counſell of the Almightie: neither can any act that is there pre-determined bee vnfulfilled vpon earth: Interuention of time breakes no ſquare in the diuine decrees: Our pur-blind eies ſee nothing, but that which toucheth their lidds; the quicke ſight of Gods preſcience ſees that, as preſent, which is a world off: According to the prediction, the ſtench of dead mens bones is a fit perfume to ſend vp from this

altar to heauen; whoſe beſt ſacrifices ſauoured worſe in the noſthrils of God. And the blood of the idolatrous ſacrificers was a meet oblation to that God, who had beene diſhonoured by their burnt-offerings to his baſe corriualls.
                     Euen that Prophet who fore-told this, had his toomb in Bethel, and that toomb had his inſcription; His laſt weakeneſſe might not rob him of the honour of his ſepulture: How palpablie doe theſe Iſraelites condemne themſelues, whiles they reſerue ſo famous a monument of their own conviction. It was no preiudice to this holy Prophet, that his bones lay amongſt the ſepulchers of idolaters. His Epitaph preſerued

thoſe bones from burning, vpon that altar, which he had accurſed; As the Lyon might not teare his carcaſſe, when hee died, ſo now, the furie of the multitude may not violate his verie bones, in the graue.
                     I doe not ſee Ioſiah: ſaue them for reliques; I heare him command they ſhall reſt in peace; it is fit the dead bodies of Gods Saints ſhould be as free from contempt, as from ſuperſtition.
                     After the remouall of theſe rites of falſe worſhip, it is time to bring in the true: Now a ſolemne Paſſouer ſhall be kept vnto the Lord, by the charge of Ioſiah: That book of the Law ſets him, the time, place, circumſtances of this ſacrament, his zeale ſo carefully followes

it, that ſince the dayes of Samuel, this feaſt was neuer ſo gloriouſly, ſo punctually celebrated. Ieruſalē
                         is the place, the fourteenth day of the firſt moneth is the time, the Leuites are the actors, a yearling and ſpotleſſe Lambe is the prouiſion; no bone of it is broken, the blood is ſprinkled vpon the doore-poſtes, it is roaſted whole, eaten with ſowre herbs, with bread vnleauened; the remainder is conſumed by fire. The law, the ſacrifices, had beene in vaine, if the Paſſouer had beene neglected. No true Iſraelite might want, whether this monument of their deliuerance paſt, or this Type of the Meſſiah to come. Rather then faile, Ioſiahs bountie ſhall ſupplie to Iudah Lambs for

their paſchall deuotion: No almes is ſo acceptable, as that whereby the ſoule is furthered.
                  
                  
                     
                     IOSIAH'S Death; with the deſolation of the Temple, and Ieruſalem.
                     
                        
                           IOſiah hath now happily ſetled the 2 King. 23. verſ 29. And 2 Chro. 35. verſ 20. 2 Chr. 36. affaires both of God, &amp; the ſtate: and now hath ſweet leiſure to inioy himſelfe, and his people: his conſcience doth not more cheare him at home, then his ſubiects abroad; Neuer King raigned with more officious piety to God, with more loue, and applauſe of men: But what ſtability is there in theſe

earthly things? how ſeldome is excellency in any kind long-liu'd? In the very ſtrength of his age, in the height of his ſtrength, is Ioſiah withdrawne from the earth; as not without a mercifull intention of his glory, on Gods behalfe, ſo, not without ſome weakneſſe, on his own. Pharaoh Necho King of Egipt comes vp to fight againſt the King of Aſſyria: What is that to Ioſiah? Perhaps the Egiptians attempted to paſſe through the land of Iudah, towards Carchemiſh the ſeat of his war; but, as a neighbour, not as an enemy: Ioſiah reſiſts him; as neither holding it ſafe to admit a forraigne power into the boſome of his Countrey, nor daring to giue ſo faire an occaſion of prouoking the

                        Aſſyrian hoſtility againſt him.
                     The King of Egipt mildly deprecates this enmity, hee ſends Ambaſſadors to Ioſiah, ſaying, What haue I to doe with thee thou King of Iudah, I come not againſt thee, this day, but againſt the houſe wherewith I haue warre; for God commanded me to make haſt; forbeare thee from medling with God, who is with me, that hee deſtroy thee not.
                     
                     What friend could haue ſayd more? what Prophet could haue aduiſed more holily? why doth not good Ioſiah ſay with himſelfe; There may bee truth in this ſuggeſtion; God may haue ſent this man, to be a ſcourge of mine old enemy, of Aſhur: If the hand of the Almighty be in this deſigne, why doe I oppoſe it? The quarrell

is not mine, why do I thruſt my finger into this flame, vnbidden? Wherefore ſhould I hazard the effuſion of blood, vpon an harmleſſe paſſage? Can I heare him plead a command from God, and not inquire into it? How eaſie is it for me to know the certainty of this pretended commiſſion? Haue not I the Prieſts, and Prophets of God about me? Let mee firſt goe and conſult his oracle; If God haue ſent him, and forbidden mee, why ſhould my courage cary me againſt my piety?
                     It is ſtrange that the good hart of Ioſiah could eſcape theſe thoughts; theſe reſolutions: Yet, hee that vpon the generall threats of Gods Law againſt Iudah, ſends meſſengers

to inquire of a Propheteſſe; now, vpon theſe particular threats of danger to himſelfe, ſpeaks not, ſtirs not. The famous Prophet Ieremy was then liuing, and Zephaniah; beſides a whole Colledge of Seers, Ioſiah doth not ſo much as ſend out of doores, to aske, Shall I goe vp againſt the King of Egipt? Sometimes, both grace and wit are aſleepe in the holieſt and warieſt breſts: The beſt of all Gods Saints may bee ſometimes miſcaried by their paſſions, to their coſt.
                     The wiſe prouidence of God hath mercifully determined to leaue Ioſiah to his owne counſels, that by the weakneſſe of his ſeruant, hee might take occaſion to perfit his glory: Euen that wherein

                        Ioſiah was wanting vnto God, ſhall concurre to the making vp of Gods promiſe to Ioſiah: when we are the moſt blind-folded, we run on the waies of Gods hidden decrees; and, what euer our intents be, cannot, if wee would, goe out of that vnknowne path.
                     Needs will Ioſiah put himſelfe into armes againſt an vnwilling enemie; and, to bee leſſe noted, diſguiſes himſelfe. The fatall arrow of an Egyptian archer findes him out, in the throng, and giues him his deaths-wound; Now, too late hee calls to a retrait; his changed Charet is turned to a Biere, to carie his bleeding corps to his graue, in Ieruſalem.
                     
                     What eye doth not now pitie and lament the vntimely end of

a Ioſiah? Whom can it chooſe but affect, to ſee a religious, iuſt, vertuous Prince ſnatcht away in the vigour of his age? After all our fooliſh moane, the prouidence that directed that ſhaft to his lighting place, intends that wound for a ſtroke of mercy: The God whō 
                        Ioſiah ſerues, looks through his death, at his glorie: and by this ſudden violence will deliuer him from the view, and participation of the miſeries of Iudah, which had beene many deaths; and fetches him to the participation of that happineſſe, which could countervaile more deathes, then could be incident into a Ioſiah. Oh the wonderfull goodneſſe of the Almighty, whoſe verie iudgements are mercifull; Oh

the ſafe condicion of Gods children, whom very paine eaſeth, whom death reuiues, whom diſſolutiō vnites, whom laſtly their verie ſinne and temptation glorifies.
                     How happily hath Ioſiah gained by this change? In ſtead of a froward people, he now is ſorted with Saints and Angels; in ſtead of a fading, and corruptible crowne, he now inioyes an eternall. The orphane ſubiects are readie to weepe out their eyes, for ſorrow; their loſſe cannot be ſo great, as his gaine: he is glorious, they, as their ſins had deſerued, miſerable. If the ſeparated ſoule could be capable of paſſion, could Ioſiah haue ſeene, after his departure, the calamities of his ſons, of

his people, it could not but haue laid ſiege to his peace.
                     The ſad ſubiects proclaime his ſonne Iehoahaz, King, in ſtead of ſo lamented a father; He both doth ill, and fares ill: By that time he hath ſat but three moneths in the throne, Pharaoh Nechoh King of Egypt ſecōds the fathers death, with the ſonnes captiuity: This victorious enemy puts downe the wicked ſonne of Ioſiah, and lades him with chains at Riblath, in the land of Hamath; and lades his people with the tribute of an hundred talents of ſiluer, and a talent of gold: Yet, as if he that was vnwilling to fight with Ioſiah, were no leſſe vnwilling to root out his poſterity, this Egyptian ſets Eliakim, the ſecond ſonne of

                        Ioſiah, vpon the ſeat of his father; &amp;, that he might be al his, changes his name to Iehoiakim: oh the woful &amp; vnworthy ſucceſſiō of Ioſiah; one ſon is a priſoner, the other is a tributary; both are wicked. After that Iehoiakim hath been ſome yeares Pharaohs Bayliue, to gather, and racke the deare rents of Iudah; Nebuchadnezzar the great King of Babylon comes vp, and ſweepes away both the Lord, and his Feodary, Pharaoh, and Iehoiakim.
                     
                     So farre was the ambitious Egyptian from maintaining his incroachment vpon the territories of Iudah, that hee could not now hold his owne: From Nilus to Euphrates, all is loſt: So ſubiect are the leſſer powers ſtill to bee ſwallowed vp of the greater; ſo

iuſt it is with God, that they which will bee affecting vndue inlargement of their eſtates, ſhould fall ſhort of what they had.
                     
                        Iehoiakim is caried in fetters to Babylon: and now in that dungeon of his captiuity, hath more leaſure, then grace, to bethinke himſelfe of all his abominations; and whiles hee inherits the ſad lodging of his great grandfather, Manaſſeh, inherits not his ſucceſſe.
                     Whiles hee is rotting in this Goale, his young ſonne Iehoiachin ſtarts vp in his throne; like to a muſhrom that riſes vp in a night, and withers in a day: Within three moneths, and ten dayes, is that young Prince (the meet ſon

of ſuch a father) fetcht vp in irons to his fathers priſon; Neither ſhall he goe alone; his attendance ſhal adde to his miſery; His mother, his wiues, his officers, his peeres, his craftſmen, his warriours accompany him, manicled, and chained, to their perpetuall bondage.
                     Now, according to Iſaiahs word, it would haue been great preferment for the fruit of Hezekiahs loynes to bee Pages in the Court of Babylon.
                     
                     One only branch yet remaines of the vnhappy ſtocke of holy Ioſiah, Mattaniah, the brother of Iehoiakim, whom Nebuchadnezar (changing his name to Zedekiah) ſets vp in that forlorne, and tributary throne; There might hee

haue liued (though an vnderling) yet peaceable; This man (to make vp the meaſure of Gods iuſt iudgments) as he was euer a rebell to God, ſo proues rebellious to his Soueraigne maſter, the King of Babylon: The Prophet Ieremy hath forewarn'd him in vain; nothing could teach this man, but ſmart.
                     Who can looke for other then fury frō 
                        Nebuchadnezzar, againſt Ieruſalem, which now had affronted him with three ſeuerall ſucceſſions of reuolts, and conſpiracies againſt his gouernment; and thrice abuſed his bounty, and indulgence? with a mighty army doth he therfore come vp againſt his ſeditious deputy; and beſieges Ieruſalem, and blockes it vp with forts round about. After two

yeares ſiege, the Chaldees without, and the famine within, haue preuailed; King Zedekiah and his ſouldiers are fled away by night, as thinking themſelues happy, if they might abandon their walls, and ſaue their liues.
                     The Chaldees (as caring more for the birdes, then for the neſt) purſue them, and ouertake Zedekiah, forſaken of all his forces, in the plaine of Iericho, and bring him to Nebuchadnezzar, King of Babylon. What can ſo vnthankfull and perfidious a vaſſall expect, but the worſt of reuenge? The ſentence is fearfull: Firſt, the ſonnes of Zedekiah are ſlaine before his eyes; then thoſe eyes of his (as if they had ſeene enough, when they had ſeene him childleſſe)

are put out: His eyes are onely lent him ſo long, as to torment him with the ſight of his owne vtmoſt diſcomfort; Had his ſonnes but ouer-liued his eies, the griefe had beene ſo much the leſſe, as the apprehenſion of it had beene leſſe liuely, and piercing; Now, this wofull obiect ſhall ſhut vp his ſight, that, euen when his bodily eyes are gone, yet the eyes of his minde might euer ſee what he laſt ſaw; That thus his ſonnes might bee euer dying before him, and himſelfe in their death euer miſerable.
                     Who doth not now wiſh that the blood of Hezekiah and Ioſiah could haue beene ſeuered from theſe impure dregs of their lewd iſſue? no man could pity the offenders,

were it not for the mixture of the intereſt of ſo holy progenitors.
                     No more ſorrow can come in at the windowes of Zedekiah, more ſhall come in at his doores; his care ſhall receiue what more to rue for his Ieruſalem: Nebuzaradan the great Marſhall of the King of Babylon comes vp againſt that deplored City, and breakes downe the walls of it, round about, and burnes the Temple of the Lord, and the Kings houſe, and euery faire Pallace of Ieruſalem, with fire; driues away the remainder of her inhabitants, into Captiuity, caries away the laſt ſpoiles of the glorious Temple. Oh Ieruſalem, Ieruſalem, the wonder of all times, the paragon of

nations, the glory of the earth, the fauourite of heauen, how art thou now become heapes of aſhes, hilles of rubbiſh, a ſpectacle of deſolation, a monument of ruine? Iflater, yet no leſſe deepe haſt thou now pledged that bitter cup of Gods vengeance, to thy ſiſter Samaria; How carefully had thy God forwarned thee? Thogh Iſrael play the harlot, yet, let not Iudah ſinne: Loe now, as thine iniquities, ſo thy iudgements haue ouertaken her: Both lye together in the duſt, both are made a curſe to all poſterities: Oh God, what place ſhall thy iuſtice ſpare, if Ieruſalem haue periſhed? If that delight of thine were cut off for her wickedneſſe, Let not vs bee high minded but feare.
                     
                        
What pity it was to ſee thoſe goodly Cedars of the Temple flaming vp higher then they ſtood in Lebanon? to ſee thoſe curious marbles, which neuer felt the dint of the pick-axe, or hammer, in the laying, wounded with mattockes, and wounding the earth in their fall? to ſee the holy of holies, whereinto none might enter but the high-prieſt, once a yeare, thronged with Pagans; the vailes rent, the ſacred Arke of God vilated, and defaced, the Tables ouer-turned, the altars broke down, the pillars demoliſhed, the pauements digged vp, yea, the very groūd, where that famous pile ſtood, deformed. O God, thou woldſt rather haue no viſible houſe vpon earth, then indure

it defiled with Idolatries.
                     Foure hundred thirty and ſixe yeares had that Temple ſtood, and beautified the earth, and honored heauen, now it is turned into rude heapes; There is no preſcription to be pleaded for the fauour of the Almighty: Onely that Temple, not made with hands, is eternall in the heauens. Thither hee graciouſly bring vs, that hath ordain'd vs thither, for the ſake of that glorious high-Prieſt, that hath once for all entred into that holy of holies,
                  
                  Amen.

                        THE firſt tranſportation into Babylon, vnder Iehoiakim, (wherein Daniel, Ezekiel, and many other of the beſt note, were driuen into captiuity,) was (ſome eleuen yeares after) followed with a ſecond, vnder Zedekiah; wherin the remnant of the, nowruined, Ieruſalem, and Iudah, were ſwept away. Seuenty yeares was

the period of their longeſt ſeruitude; whiles Babylō
                         was a Queen, Iudah was her vaſſall: when that proud Tyranneſſe fell, Gods people began to riſe againe: The Babylonian Monarchie was no ſooner ſwallowed vp of the Perſian, then the Iewes felt the comfort of libertie.
                     For Cyrus conquering Babylon, and finding the Iewes groaning vnder that miſerable captiuity, ſtraight releaſes them, and ſends them, vnder the conduct of their Captaine Zorobabel, backe to their almoſt-forgotten country.
                     The world ſtands vpon viciſſitudes; Euery Nation hath her turne, and muſt make vp her meaſure: Threeſcore and tenne yeares agoe, it was the courſe of

                        Iudah, the iniquity of that rebellious people was full. Some hundred and thirty yeares before that, was the turne of Samaria, and her Iſraelites: Now the ſtaffe is come to the doores of Babylon, euen that wherewith Iudah was beaten: and thoſe Perſians which are now victorious, muſt haue their terme alſo. It is in vaine for any earthly ſtate to promiſe to it ſelfe an immutable cōdition. At laſt, the rod that ſcourged Gods children, is caſt into the fire: Thou haſt remembred, O Lord, the Children of Edom in the day of Ieruſalem, how they ſaid, Downe with it, downe with it, euen to the ground: O daughter of Babylon waſted with miſery, how happy is hee that rewardeth thee as thou haſt ſerued them: It is Cyrus that

hath wrought this reuenge, this reſcue.
                     Doubtleſſe, it did not a little moue Cyrus to this fauour, that he found himſelfe honorably fore-named in theſe Iewiſh propheſies, and fore appointed to this glorious ſeruice, no leſſe then an hundred and ſeuenty yeares, before Eſay 44 vlt he was: Who would not be glad to make good ſo noble and happy a deſtiny? O God, if wee heare that thou haſt ordained vs to life, how gladly, how carefullie, ſhould we worke out our ſaluation? if to good workes, how ſhould we abound?
                     In the firſt yeare of his Monarchy, doth Cyrus both make proclamations, and publiſh them in writing, through all his Kingdome;

wherein he both profeſſeth his zealous reſolutions, and deſires to build vp Gods houſe, in Ieruſalem, and inioynes, and incourages all the Iewes, through his dominions, to addreſſe themſelues to that ſacred worke; and incites all his ſubiects to ayd them with ſiluer, and gold, and goods, and beaſts. How gracious was the command of that, whereof the very allowance was a fauour?
                     Was it Cyrus that did this? was it not thou, O God, in whoſe hands are the harts of Kings, that ſtirredſt vp the ſpirit of this Perſian; as if he had beene more then a ſonne of thy Church, a father? How eaſie is it for thee to make very Pagans protectors to thy Church; enemies, benefactors?
                     
                        
Not with an empty grace doth this great King diſmiſſe the Iewes, but with a royall bountie; Hee brings forth the veſſels of the houſe of the Lord, which Nehuchadnezzar had brought forth out of Ieruſalem, and had put them in the houſe of his gods; and cauſes them to be numbred by his Treaſurer to the hands of Sheſhbazzar the Prince of Iudah, for the vſe of the Temple; no fewer then fiue thouſand and foure hundred veſſels of gold and ſiluer.
                     
                     Certainly, this great Monarch wanted not wit to thinke; It is a rich booty that I find in the Temples of Babylon; by the law of conqueſt it is mine; hauing vanquiſht their gods, I may well challenge their ſpile; how ſeaſonably doth it now fall into my

hands, vpon this victorie, to reward my ſouldiers, to ſettle my new Empire: what if this treaſure came from Ieruſalem? the proprietie is now altered; the very place (according to the cōceit of Iewes) hath profaned it; The true God, I haue heard, is curious; neither will abide thoſe veſſels, which haue beene polluted with idolatrous vſes: It ſhall bee enough if I looſe the bonds of this miſerable people: If I giue liberty, let the next giue wealth: they will think themſelues happy in bare walls, in their natiue earth: To what purpoſe ſhould I pamper their penurie with a ſudden ſtore? But the Princely hart of Cyrus would admit of no ſuch baſe ſacrilegious thoughts; Thoſe veſſels that hee

finds ſtampt with Gods marke, he will returne to their owner; neither his owne occaſions, nor their abuſe ſhall be any colour of their detention. O Cyrus, how manie cloſe-handed, griple-minded Chriſtians ſhall once be choked in iudgement with the example of thy iuſt munificence? thou reſtoredſt that which wee purloine: woe bee to thoſe houſes that are ſtored with the ſpoiles of Gods Temple: woe bee to thoſe fingers that are tainted with holy treaſures.
                     Kings can hardly doe good alone; their lawes are not more followed, then their examples: No ſooner doe the chiefe of the fathers of Iudah and Beniamin, and the Prieſts, and Leuites ſet their

faces towards Ieruſalem for the building of the Temple, then the liberall hands of their Pagan neighbours furniſh them with gold, and ſiluer, and precious things. Euer Perſian is glad to be at the charge of laying a ſtone, in Gods houſe. The ſame God that had giuen them theſe mettals, out of his cofers of the earth, giues it out of their cofers to his Temple. He that tooke away by the Chaldees, giues by the Perſians: Where the Almighty intends a worke, there cannot bee any want of meanes.
                     Thus hartened, thus laded, doe the ioyfull families of Iudah returne to their old home; How many thouſands of them were worne out, and loſt in that ſeuenty

yeares ſeruitude? How few of them yet ſuruiued, that could know the place of their birth, and habitation; or, ſay, Here ſtood the Temple, here the Palace? Amongſt thoſe fourty and two thouſand, three hundred &amp; threeſcore Iewes, that returned in this firſt expedition; there were whō the confuſion of their long captiuity Beſides ſeruants 7337. had robbed of their pedigree; They knew themſelues Iewes, but could not deriue their line: theſe were yet admitted, without difficulty; But thoſe of the Prieſtly tribe, which could not deduce their genealogy from the regiſter, are caſhiered as vncleane. Then, God would bee ſerued in a blood, now in a due ſucceſſion: If we could not fetch

the line of our pedigree from Chriſt, and his Apoſtles, we were not fit for the Euangelicall altars. Their calling was by nature, ours by grace; The grace of inward abilities, of outward ordination; if we cannot approue both theſe, we are iuſtly abādoned; now had the children of Iſrael taken down their Harpes from the Willowes, which grew by the waters of Babylon, &amp; could, vnbidden, ſing the true ſōgs of their recouered Zion: They are newly ſetled in their old māſions, when vpō the firſt publike feaſt, in the Autumne, immediately following their return, they flock vp to Ieruſalē: their firſt care is their publike ſacrifice; That ſchool of their Captiuity, wherin they haue been long trained, hath

taught them to begin with God: A forced diſcontinuance, makes deuotion more ſauoury, more ſweet to religious hearts; whereas in an open freedome, piety doth too often languiſh.
                     
                        Ieſhua the Prieſt, and Zorobabel the Prince are fitly ioyned in the building of the Altar: neither of their hands may be out of that ſacred worke: no ſooner is that ſet vpon the baſes, then it is imployed to the daily burnt-offerings: The Altar may not ſtay the leiſure of the Temple; Gods Church may not want her oblations; He can be none of the ſons of Iſrael, that doth not euery day renue his acknowledgements of God.
                     How feelingly doe theſe Iewes
                        
keepe their feaſt of Tabernacles, whiles their ſoiourning in Babylon was ſtill in their thoughts; whiles as yet their Tēts muſt ſupply their ruined houſes? The firſt motions of zeale are commonly ſtrong, and feruent; How carefully doe theſe Gouernours and Prieſts make preparatiō for Gods Temple? Carpenters and Maſons are hyred; Tyrian workmen are againe called for, and Lebanon is now anew ſolicited for Cedar trees. The materials are ready; Euery Iſraelite, with ſuch courage addreſſes himſelfe to this ſeruice, as if his life lay in thoſe ſtones: And now, whiles the foundation of the Temple was laying, the Prieſts ſtand in their habits, with Trumpets, the Leuites with

Cymbals, interchanging their holy Muſicke, and melodiouſly ſinging praiſes to the God of Iſrael, who had turned their captiuity as the ſtreames in the South, and honoured their eyes and hands with the firſt ſtones of his houſe: The people ſecond their ſongs with ſhouts; The earth ſounds, and heauen rings with the ioyfull acclamations of the multitude; It is no ſmall comfort, in a good action, to haue begun wel; The entrance of any holy enterpriſe is commonly encountred with many diſcouragements, which if wee haue once ouercome, the paſſage is ſmooth.
                     How would theſe men haue ſhouted at the laying on of the laſt ſtone of the battlements, who are

thus ioyed with laying the firſt ſtones of the foundation? The end of any thing is better then the beginning: that hath certainty, this danger; this labour, that reſt: little did theſe men thinke that, for all this, few of them ſhould liue to ſee the roofe.
                     What different affections ſhall wee ſee produced in men by the ſame occaſion? The younger Iewes ſhouted at this ſight, the elder wept: The yonger ſhouted to ſee a new foundation; The elder wept to remember the old: They who had ſeene no better, thought this goodly; They who had ſeen the former, thought this meane, and homely; more ſorrowing for what they had loſt, then reioycing in ſo vnequal a reparation.
                     
                        
As it may fall out, it is ſome peece of miſery to haue beene happier; euery abatement of the degrees of our former height laies ſiege to our thankfulneſſe, for leſſer mercies. Sometimes, it proues an aduantage to haue knowne no better; he ſhall more comfortably inioy preſent benefits, who takes them as they are, without any other compariſons, then of the weakeneſſe of his owne deſeruings. It is nothing to mee what my ſelfe or others haue beene, ſo I bee now well: Neither is it otherwiſe in particular Churches, if one be more gloriouſly built then another, yet if the foundation be rightly layd in both; one may not inſult, the other may not repine: Ech muſt

congratulate the truth to other, each muſt thankfully inioy it ſelfe.
                     The noiſe was not more loud, then confuſed; here was a diſcordant mixture of lamentation, and ſhouting; it was hard to ſay whether drowned the other.
                     This aſſembly of Iewes was a true image of Gods Church on earth; one ſings, another cries; neuer doth it all either laugh or mourne at once. It ſhall bee in our triumph that all teares ſhall be wipt from our eyes; till then, our paſſions muſt bee mixed, according to the occaſions.
                     The Iewes are buſie at worke, not more full of ioy, then hopes; and now that the wals begin to ouerlook the earth; their thoughts

ſeeme to ouerlooke the walls. But what great enterpriſe was euer ſet on foot for God, which found not ſome croſſes?
                     There was a mungrell brood of Samarit-Aſſyrians, which euer ſince the daies of Senacherib dwelt in the land of Iſrael; whoſe religion was a patched coate of ſeuerall ſhreds; ſome little part Iewiſh, the reſt Pagan, not without much variety of idolatry. Theſe hollow neighbours profer their aſſiſtance to the children of the captiuity; Let vs build with you, for we ſeeke your God, as ye doe: and doe ſacrifice to him. Might men be their owne iudges, there would bee no hereſie in the world, no miſ-worſhip. It is true; theſe men did ſacrifice to the true God;

The Lyons taught them to ſeeke, and the Iſraelitiſh Prieſt taught them to find the faſhions of the God of the land: Some of theſe Iewes knew their deuotion of old; They ſerued Iſraels God; but with their owne: As good no God, as too many. In a iuſt indignation therefore do theſe Iewiſh gouernours repell the partnerſhip of ſuch helpers: You haue nothing to doe with vs, to build an houſe to our God; but we our ſelues together will build vnto the Lord God of Iſrael. The hand of an idolater is contagious. Yet, had it beene to the building of ſome fortreſſe, or commonhall, perhaps their ayd had not beene refuſed, but when the wals of Gods houſe are to be raiſed, this ſociety had beene piacular.
                     
                        
Thoſe that may not be allowed to helpe the worke, will aske no leaue to hinder it: their malicious ſuggeſtions weaken the hands of the people of Iudah, and ſtirre vp authoritie to ſuppreſſe them.
                     
                        Cyrus was farre off; neither liued he long after that gracious commiſſion; and beſides was ſo taken vp the while with his wars, that he could not haue leaſure to ſift thoſe querulous accuſations. Now therefore, during the laſt yeares of Cyrus, and the raigne of his ſonne Cambyſes, and the long gouernment of Darius Hyſtaſpides, and of his ſonne Xerxes, or Ahaſuerus, and laſtly of his ſonne Artaxerxes, vntill the daies of Darius Nothus, (which was no leſſe

then fiue ſucceſſions of Kings, (beſides Cyrus) doe the wals of the Temple ſtand ſtill, yea lye waſte; ſubiect to the wrongs of time, and wether: the fit matter of ſorrow to the Iewes, inſultation to the enemies, deriſion to paſſengers.
                     What a wide gap of time was here betwixt the foundation of Gods houſe, and the battlements? How large a triall doth God now ſecondly take of the faith, of the patience of his people? How large a proofe doth he giue of his own long-ſuffering? Oh God, when thou hadſt but one houſe vpon earth, thou wert content to put vp delayes, yea affronts in the building of it; now thou haſt many, it is no maruell if thy longanimity

and iuſtice, abide ſome of them to lie deſolate: They are not ſtones, or mettals, or men that can make thee more glorious; thou beſt knoweſt when to ſerue thy ſelfe of all theſe; when to honour theſe with thy ſeruice.
                     A ſmall matter hinders the worthieſt action; as a little fiſh (they ſay) ſtayes the greateſt ſhip: Before, the Iewes were diſcouraged with words, but now they are ſtopped by commands.
                     Theſe enuious Samaritans haue corrupted the gouernours which the Perſian Kings ſet ouer thoſe parts; and from their hands haue obtained letters of deepe calumniation, to Ahaſuerus the King; and after him, to his ſonne Artaxerxes; wherein Ieruſalem is

charged with old rebellion to Kings; and for proofe, appellation is made to the records; frō which euidence, is ſpightfully inferred, that if theſe wals bee once built, the King ſhall receiue no tribute on this ſide the riuer. Neuer was Gods Church but ſubiect to reproaches.
                     Princes haue reaſon to bee iealous of their rights. The records are ſearcht; It ſoone appeares that within one Century of yeares, Ieruſalem had rebelled againſt Nebuchadnezzar, and held out two yeares ſiege of that great Babylonian. The ſcandall of diſloyaltie is perpetuall: although indeed they held him rather a preuailing enemie, then a lawfull Soueraine; One act diſparages either place, or

perſon, to all poſterities. Therefore ſhall the wals of Ieruſalem lie waſte, becauſe it had once beene trecherous; After an hundred yeares doth that Citie rue one perfidious act of Zedekiah. Fidelitie to our gouernours is euer both ſafe, and honourable.
                     Command is now ſent out from Surnamed Longhand. 
                        Artaxerxes, (euen the ſon of Queene Eſther) to reſtrain the worke: All reſpects muſt ceaſe with carnall minds, when their honors, or profits are in queſtion. Rehum the Chancellor, and Shimſhai the Scribe, come now armed with authoritie: The ſword hath eaſily preuailed againſt the trowell. Still do the Iewes find themſelues as it were, captiues at home, and in ſilence, and ſorrow, ceaſe

from their labors, vntill the dayes of the next ſucceſſour, Darius Nothus.
                     
                     As thoſe that had learn'd to ſow after a bad crop, theſe Iewes, vpon the change of the Prince, by the incouragement of the Prophets of God, Haggai, and Zechariah, take new heart to build againe: If others power hinder vs in the worke of God, our will may not be guilty.
                     Their new gouernors come, as before; to expoſtulate; Who hath commanded you to build this houſe, and to make vp this wall? and what are your names? They wiſely and modeſtly plead the ſeruice of the God of heauen, the decree of Cyrus; ſtill perſiſting to build, as if the prohibition of Artaxerxes had

dyed with the author. The vnpartiall Gouernours doe neither claw, nor exaſperate; but relating the humble and iuſt anſwer of the Iewes, moue the King that ſearch may be made in the rolles of Babylon, whether ſuch an Edict were made by Cyrus; and require his royall pleaſure, concerning the validity of ſuch pretended decree. Darius ſearches, findes, ratifies, inlargeth it, not onely charging his officers not to hinder the worke, but commanding to leuie ſummes of his own Tribute, beyond the riuer, for the expences of the building, for the furniſhing of ſacrifices; threatning vtter ruine to the houſe of that man, and death to his perſon, who ſhold offer to impeach

this bounty: and ſhutting vp with a zealous imprecation; The God of heauen that hath cauſed his name to dwell there, deſtroy all Kings and people that ſhall put to their hand to alter, and to deſtroy this houſe of God which is at Ieruſalem: I Darius haue made a decree, let it be done with ſpeed.
                     
                     Who would haue lookt for ſuch an edict from a Perſian? No Salomon, no Dauid could haue ſaid more.
                     The ruler of all hearts makes choyce of his owne inſtruments, and when hee pleaſeth, can glorifie himſelfe by thoſe meanes, which are leaſt expected: That ſacred work which the husband, and ſon of an Eſther croſſed, ſhall bee happily accompliſhed by a

                        Darius: In the ſixt yeare of his raigne, is the Temple of God fully finiſhed; and now the Dedication of it, is celebrated, by a ioyfull feaſt: An hundred bullocks, two hundred rams, foure hundred lambes, in a meet proportion, ſmoke vpon their altars: And now the children of the captiuitie thinke this day a ſufficient payment for all their ſorrowes: We haue reaſon to thinke it the faireſt day that euer ſhone forth to vs, wherein the ſpirituall building of Gods houſe is raiſed vp in our ſoules. How ſhould wee ſhout at the laying of this foundation, and feaſt at the laying on of the roofe? What other, what better ſacrifice can wee offer vp to God in the ſenſe of our ioy, then our

ſelues? Let our hearts be at once, the Temple, the Altar, the ſacrifice; Oh God, bee thou glorified in all theſe, who haſt graciouſly honoured all theſe with thy ſelfe.
                     Euery holy feaſt is now duely kept, the Prieſts know their diuiſions, the Leuites their courſes; and the whole ſeruice of God is put into a ſetled order; But, as there can be no new beginnings without imperfection, nor long continuance, without corruption; reformation is no leſſe neceſſary then good inſtitutions; Ataxerxes 
                        The windfull. 
                        Mnemon hath learn'd of his father Darius to befriend Gods people; and ſtriues to inherit his beneficence: vnder his gouernment, is Ezra the Prieſt, &amp; learned ſcribe, ſent with a large commiſſion frō
                        
                        Babylon, to Ieruſalem, to inquire into the wants, and redreſſe the diſorders of the Iewes; with full power not onely to cary with him all the voluntaries of his nation; and the treaſures contributed in all the prouince of Babylon; but to raiſe ſuch ſummes, out of the Kings reuenues, as ſhould be found requiſite; and withall to ordaine Magiſtrates and Iudges, and to crowne the Lawes with due execution, whether to death, or baniſhment, or confiſcation; and laſtly, with a large exemption of the Prieſts and Leuites, and all the inferiour officers of the Temple, from all toles, tributes, cuſtomes. Nothing wanted here, whether for direction, or incouragement. It is a ſigne of Gods

great fauour to any nation, when the hearts of Soueraigne gouernours are raiſed vp, both to the choice of worthy agents, and to the commanding of pious, and reſtauratiue actions.
                     Holy and carefull Ezra gathers a new colony of Iewes, takes view of them, at the riuer of Ahaua; and finding a miſſe of the ſonnes of Leui (without whom no company, no plantation can bee compleat) ſends for their ſupply; And now, fully furniſhed, hee proclaimes a faſt in the way.
                     I doe not heare him ſay, The iourney is long and dangerous; the people haue need of all their ſtrength. I could well wiſh vs al afflicted with a religious faſt, were it not that the abatement of

the courage, and vigour of the multitude may indanger our ſucceſſe; But without all theſe carnall conſultations, he begins with this ſolemne act of humiliation; It is better to haue God ſtrong in our weakneſſe, then to haue fleſh and blood ſtrong in his neglect.
                     
                        Artaxerxes was a Patron of the Iewes, yet a Pagan by profeſſion; wiſe Ezra was afraid of quenching thoſe ſparkes of piety which he deſcryed in this ſemi-proſelite. Rather therefore then hee will ſeeme to imply a diſtruſt in the prouidēce of that God, in whoſe ſeruice he went by ſeeking a conuoy of ſouldiers from the King; Ezra chooſes to put himſelfe vpon the hazard of the way, and the

immediate protection of the Almighty. Any death were better then to heare Artaxerxes ſay, Is this the man that ſo confidently told me, The hand of our God is vpon all them for good that ſeeke him; but his power and his wrath is againſt all them that forſake him? Doth he beleeue himſelfe that he thus doubts ere he begin? Dare he not truſt his God with his owne buſineſſes?
                     The reſolutions of faithfull hearts are heroicall: No heathen man ſhall ſtumble at Ezraes feare: Hee can finde more aſſurance in his faſt, then in a Perſian band: with a couragious relyance vpon the hand of his God he puts himſelfe into the iourney; and finds nothing but ſafety

and ſucceſſe: The fidelity of the Almighty neuer diſappointed the confidence of his ſeruants. All the army of Artaxerxes could not haue been ſo ſtrong a gard to the Iewes, as their inuiſible protection.
                     In the ſpace of foure moneths is Ezra, and his company happily ariued at Ieruſalem: where hee ioyes to ſee the new Temple, and his old Colleagues: and now hauing deliuered vp the charge of his treaſure, by waight, in the chambers of the houſe of the Lord, hee applies himſelfe to his worke, and deliuers the Kings Commiſſions to the Lieu-tenants and Gouernors, for their vtmoſt aſſiſtance.
                     The Princes of Iudah doe not

(for ought I heare) repine at the large Patent granted to this Prieſt, nor ſay, What doth a man of this robe meddle with placing, or diſplacing Magiſtrates? with execution of iudgements to death, bonds, baniſhment? but rather as congratulating this power to ſacred hands, gladly preſent vnto him all their grieuances. Truly religious hearts cannot grudge any honour to their ſpirituall guides.
                     This holy Commiſſioner is ſoone welcomed with a ſad Bill of complaint, from ſome good Peeres of Iſrael; wherein they charge diuers of the Prieſts, Leuites, people, not to haue ſeparated themſelues from the idolatrous inhabitants of the lands, nor

(therefore) from their abominations, euen from Canaanites, Hittites, Perizzites, and the reſt of thoſe branded nations; That they haue taken of their daughters for themſelues, and for their ſonnes: So that the holy ſeed haue mingled themſelues with thoſe forbidden people; and, (which made the matter ſo much more hainous, leſſe remediable) that the hand of the Princes, and Rulers, hath beene chiefe in this treſpaſſe.
                     
                     Oh hypocriticall Iewes, did ye refuſe to ſuffer your Samaritan neighbours to ioyne with you in building a liueleſſe houſe vnto God, and doe ye now ioyne affinitie with a more accurſed generatiō for the building of liuing houſes vnto poſteritie? for the

pulling down of the liuely houſe of God?
                     How could Ezra heare this with his cloathes, his haire, his beard vntorne? What griefe, what aſtoniſhment muſt this newes needs bring to a zealous heart? And, were it not that the conſcience of his ſincere reſpect to Gods glory relieued him, how could Ezra chooſe but repent him of his iourney; and ſay; Am I comne from Babylon to find Paganiſme in Iudah? Did I leaue Perſians, to meet with Canaanites? what doe I here, if Ieruſalem bee remoued? How much better were a cleare captiutie, then an idolatrous freedome? Wo is me, that hauing left many Iewiſh harts in Babylon, I now am forced to find heathen

blood in Ieruſalem.
                     
                     As a man diſtracted with ſorrow, Ezra ſits downe vpon the earth with his garmēts rent, with the haire of his head, and beard pluckt off, wringing his hands, knocking his breſt, not mouing from his place vntill the euening ſacrifice. It is hard to be too much affected with the publike ſinnes of Gods people. Thoſe who find themſelues in the ſhip of Gods Church, cannot but bee much troubled with euery dangerous leake that it takes: Common caſes are not more neglected by the careleſſe, then taken to heart by the wiſe, and godly.
                     There, and thus, Ezra ſits aſtonied vntill the euening ſacrifice: others reſorted to him the while;

euen all that trēbled at the words of the God of Iſrael; but to help on his ſorrow, not to relieue it; neither doth any man with a mitigation of his owne, or others griefe. At laſt, hee riſes vp from his heauineſſe, and caſts himſelfe vpon his knees, and ſpreads out his hands vnto the Lord his God: Wherefore was all that penſiueneſſe, faſting, ſilence, tearing of haire and clothes, but to ſerue as a meete preface to his prayers? wherein he ſo freely powres out his hart, as if it had beene all diſſolued into deuotion; profeſsing his ſhame to lift vp his face towards the throne of God; confeſſing the iniquities of his people, which were increaſed ouer their heads, and growne vp vnto

heauen; fetching their treſpaſſe farre, and charging them deepe; feelingly acknowledging the iuſt hand that had followed them, in all their iudgements, and the iuſt confuſion wherein they now ſtand before the face of their God.
                     Teares, and ſighes, and grouelings accompanied his prayers; the example and noiſe whereof drew Iſrael into a participation of this publike mourning, For the people wept very ſore: How can they chooſe but thinke, If he thus lament for vs, how ſhould wee grieue for our ſelues?
                     All Iudah went away merrily with their ſinne, till this checke of Ezra, now they are afflicted: Had not the hands of the Peeres

beene in this treſpaſſe, the people had not beene guilty; had not the cheekes of Ezra beene firſt drenched with teares, the people had not beene penitent. It cannot be ſpoken, what power there is in a great example, whether to euill, or good.
                     Prayers and teares are nothing without indeauors. Shechaniah, the ſonne of Iehiel puts the firſt life into this buſineſſe. Hauing ſeconded the complaint of Ezra, he now addes, Yet there is hope in Iſrael concerning this thing. Now therefore let vs make a couenant with our God to put away all the wiues, and ſuch as are borne of them. Ariſe, for this matter belongeth to thee, wee alſo will be with thee; Be of good courage, and doe it.
                     
                     
                        
When miſchiefe is once done, the chiefe care is how to redreſſe it. The beſt way of redreſſe is the deliberate vndoing of that which wee haue raſhly committed; The ſureſt obligation to the vndoing of an euill act, is an oath or couenant made with God for the performance.
                     There is no man ſo wiſe, but hee may make vſe of good counſell; there is no man ſo forward, but he may abide incitation. It is no ſmall incouragement to ſee an harty aſſiſtance in an enuious and difficult ſeruice. Then aroſe Ezra, and made the chiefe Prieſts, the Leuites and all Iſrael to ſweare that they ſhould doe according to this word.
                     
                     It is halfe done that is thus aſſured. There was need of a ſtrōg

power to diſſolue a matrimoniall, though inordinate loue: Doubtleſſe, theſe men had maried out of affection; their hearts were no leſſe ſet vpon theſe wiues (though heatheniſh) then if they had beene of their owne Tribes; neither were their children, thus begotten leſſe deare vnto them, then if they had laine in Iewiſh wombes: Nothing leſſe then an oath of God, therefore could quit theſe paſſions; That is both required and taken
                     Now begins Ezra to conceiue ſome hope of preſent redreſſe; the comfort whereof, yet, cannot turne off his ſorrow for the offence paſſed; Hee neither eates bread, nor drinkes water; willingly puniſhing himſelf, becauſe

                        Iſrael had ſinned: Now ſhall his Countreymen eaſily reade in his face their owne penance, and iuſt humiliation; and ſay; This man takes no ioy in our ſufferings; hee would not ſmart thus for vs, if he did not deſcry more danger towards vs then we can apprehēd.
                     Proclamation is made through Iudah and Ierurſalem, vnder paine of forfaiture of ſubſtance, and excommunication from Gods people; that all the children of the captiuity ſhould gather themſelues together vnto Ieruſalem. They are met accordingly; The Courts of Gods houſe are thronged with penitents; and now, as if the heauen would teach them what to doe, the cloudes raine downe aboundance of teares.

What with thoſe ſad ſhowres, what with their inward remorſe, the people ſit trembling in the open Courts; and humbly wait for the reproofe, for the ſentence of Ezra. He riſes vp; and with a ſeuere countenance, layes before them their ſinne, their amends: The ſinne of their ſtrange wiues; the amends of their confeſſion, of their ſeparation: not ſparing to ſearch their wound; not neglecting the meet plaiſter for their cure.
                     The people, as willing to bee healed, yeeld themſelues patiently to that rough hand; not ſhrinking at the paine, not fauouring the ſore; As thou haſt ſaid, ſo muſt wee doe; Onely crauing a fit proportion of time, and a due aſſiſtance

for the diſpatch of ſo long and important a worke. Ezra gladly harkens to this, not ſo much requeſt, as counſell of Iſrael; The charge is diuided to men, and dayes; For two moneths ſpace the commiſſioners ſit cloſe; and within that compaſſe, finiſh this buſineſſe, not more thankleſſe then neceſſary: Doubtleſſe much varietie of paſſion met with thē in this buſie ſeruice; Here you ſhould haue ſeene an affectionate husband bitterly weeping at the diſmiſſion of a louing wife, and drowning his laſt farewell in ſobs: there you might haue ſeen a paſſionate wife, hanging vpon the armes of her beloued husbād, and on her knees, coniuring him by his former vowes, and

the deare pledges of their loues; and profering with many teares, to redeeme the loſſe of her huſband with the change of her religion: Here, you might haue ſeene, the kindred and parents of the diſmiſſed, ſhutting vp their denyed ſuites with rage and threats. There, the abandoned children kneeling to their ſeemingly-cruell father, beſeeching him not to caſt off the fruit of his owne loynes; and expoſtulating, what they haue offended in being his: The reſolued Iſraelites muſt be deafe, and blind to theſe mouing obiects; and ſo farre forget nature, as to put off part of themſelues. Perſonall inconueniences haue reaſon to yeeld to publike miſchiefes Long intertainment

makes that ſinne hard to be eiected; whoſe firſt motions might haue beene repelled with eaſe.
                     Had not the prohibition of theſe mariages been expreſſe, and their danger and miſchiefe palpable, the care of their ſeparation had not bred ſo much tumult in Iſrael. Hee that ordained matrimony, had vpon fearefull curſes forbidden an vnequall yoke with Infidels. Beſides the marring of the Church by the mixture of an vnholy ſeed, religion ſuffered for the preſent, and all good hearts with it. Many teares, many ſacrifices needed to expiate ſo foule an offence, and to ſet Iſrael ſtraight againe.
                     All this while euen theſe meſline

                        Iewes were yet forward to build the Temple; The worſt ſinners may yeeld an outward conformity to actions of piety: Ezra hath done more ſeruice in pulling downe, then the Iewes in building; without this act, the temple might haue ſtood, religion muſt needes haue falne. Bebel had beene tranſlated to Ieruſalem; Iewes had turned Gentiles. Oh happy indeauors of deuout and holy Ezra that hath at once reſtored Iudah to God, and to it ſelfe.
                  
                  
                     
                     NEHEMIAH building the walls of Ieruſalem.
                     
                        THirteen years were Nehemiah 1, 2, 3, 4, Chapt. now paſſed ſince Ezraes going vp to Ieruſalem, whē 
                        Nehemiah the religious Courtier of Artaxerxes, inquires of the eſtate of his Country, and brethren of Iudaea: Hee might well finde that holy ſcribe had not beene idle: The commiſſion of Artaxerxes had beene improued by him to the vtmoſt; Diſorders were reformed, but the walls lay waſt; The Temple

was built, but the Citie was ruinous; and if ſome ſtreets were repaired, yet they ſtood vngarded; open to the mercy of an enemie, to the infeſtation of ill neighbourhood: Great bodies muſt haue ſlow motions; As Ieruſalem, ſo the Church of God, whoſe type it was, muſt bee finiſht by leaſure.
                     
                        Nehemiah ſate warme in the Court at Shuſhan, fauored by the great King Artaxerxes; nothing could be wanting to him, whether for pleaſure, or ſtate; what needed hee to trouble his head with thoughts for Ieruſalem? what if thoſe remote wals lay on heaps whiles himſelfe dwelt faire? what if his far-diſtant countrymen be deſpiſed, whiles himſelfe is honoured,

by the great Monarch of the world?
                     It is not ſo eaſie for gracious diſpoſitions to turne off the publike calamities of Gods Church; neither can they doe other then leeſe their priuate felicities in the common diſtreſſes of the vniuerſall body. If I forget thee, O Ieruſalem, let my right hand forget her cunning; If I doe not remember thee, let my tongue cleaue to the roofe of my mouth.
                     
                     Many Iewes went vp from Babylon, and Shuſhan, to Ieruſalem, few euer returned voluntarily from their natiue home to the region of their captiuity: Some occaſion drew Hanani with certaine others of Iudah, to this voyage. Of them doth Nehemiah
                        
carefully inquire the preſent condition of Ieruſalem: It was no newes that the people were afflicted, and reproached, the walls broken downe, the gates burnt with fire. Euer ſince the furious vaſtation of Nebuzaradan, that City knew no better termes: ſeldome when doth the ſpirituall Ieruſalem fare otherwiſe in reſpect of outward eſtate: Externall glory and magnificence is an vnſure note of the Church.
                     Well had Nehemiah hoped that the gracious edict, and beneficēce of Darius, and the ſucceſſiue patronage of his Lord Artaxerxes had by the continuance of twenty yeares fauour aduanced the ſtrength and glory of Ieruſalem, but now, finding the holy City

to lie ſtill in the duſt of her confuſion, neglected of God, deſpiſed of men, hee ſits downe and weepes, and mournes, and faſts, and prayes to the God of heauen. How many ſaw thoſe ruines, and were little affected? he heares of them a far off, and is thus paſſionate? How many were vpon this ſight affected with a fruitleſſe ſorrow, his mourning is ioyned with the indeuors of redreſſe. In vaine is that griefe which hath no other end then it ſelfe.
                     
                        Nehemiah is reſolued to kneele to the King, his maſter, for the repaire of his Ieruſalem; he dares not attempt the ſuit till hee haue begun with God; This good Courtier knew well that the hearts of theſe earthly Kings are in the ouer-ruling

hand of the King of heauen to incline whither hee pleaſeth: Our prayers are the only true meanes to make way for our ſucceſſe; If in all our occaſions we doe not begin with the firſt mouer, the courſe is prepoſterous and commonly ſpeeds thereafter.
                     Who dares cenſure the piety of Courtiers, when he finds Nehemiah ſtanding before Artaxerxes? Euen the Perſian Pallace is not vncapable of a Saint: No man that waits on the Altar at Ieruſalem can compare for zeale, with him, that waits on the cup of a Pagan Monarch: The mercies of God are vnlimited to places, to callings.
                     Thus armed with deuotions, doth Nehemiah put himſelfe into

the preſence of his maſter Artaxerxes. His face was ouerclouded with a deepe ſadneſſe, neither was hee willing to cleare it. The King eaſily notes the diſparity of the countenance of the bearer, &amp; the wine that he beares: and in a gracious familiarity askes the reaſon of ſuch vnwonted change; How well it becomes the great to ſtoope vnto a curteous affability, and to exchange words of reſpect, euen with their humble vaſſalls.
                     
                        Nehemiah had not been ſo long in the Court but hee knew that Princes like no other then cheerefull attendants; neither was hee wont to bring any other face into that preſence, then ſmooth, and ſmiling.
                     
                        
Greatneſſe vſes to bee full of ſuſpition, and where it ſees a deiection, and ſowerneſſe of the browes, is ready to apprehend ſome ſullē thoughts of diſcontētment, or, at the leaſt, conſtrues it for a diſreſpect to that ſoueraignty, whoſe beames ſhould bee of power to diſperſe all our inward miſts: Euen good manners forbid a man to preſſe into the preſence of a Prince, except hee can either lay by theſe vnpleaſing paſſions, or hide them: So had Nehemiah hitherto done: Now, he purpoſely ſuffers his ſorrow to looke through his eies, that it may worke both inquiry, and compaſſion from his maſter; neither doth hee faile of his hopes in either; Why is thy countenance ſad,
                        
                        ſeeing thou art not ſicke. How ſenſible doe we thinke the father of mercies is of all our penſiue thoughts, when an heathen maſter is ſo tender of a ſeruāts griefe? How ready ſhould our tongues bee to lay open our cares to the God of all comfort, when we ſee Nehemiah ſo quicke in the expreſſions of his ſorrow to an vncertaine eare?
                     
                        Let the King liue for euer: Why ſhould not my countenance, bee ſad when the City the place of my father ſepulphres lyeth waſt, and the gates thereof are burnt with fire. Not without an humble preface doth Nehemiah lay forth his grieuance; Complaints haue euer an vnpleaſing harſhneſſe in them which muſt bee taken off by ſome diſſcreet

inſinuation: Although it could not but ſound well in the generous eare of Artaxerxes, that his ſeruant was ſo carefull for the honour of his Countrey; As nature hath made vs all members of a community and hath giuen vs common intereſts, ſo, it is moſt pleaſing to vs, to ſee theſe publike cares diuide vs from our owne.
                     The King eaſily decryes a ſecret ſupplication wrapt vp in this moanefull anſwer, which the modeſt ſuiter was afraid to diſcloſe, and therefore he helps that baſhfull motion into the light; For what doſt thou make requeſt? It is the praiſe of bounty to draw on the iuſt petitions of fearefull ſuppliants.
                     
                        Nehemiah dares not open his

mouth of the King, till his heart hath opened it ſelfe by a ſudden eiaculation to his God; No buſineſſe can bee ſo haſty, but our prayer may preuent it; the wings whereof are ſo nimble, that it can fly vp to heauen, and ſolicit God, and bring downe an anſwer, before euer our words need to come forth of our lips. In vaine ſhall we hope that any deſigne of ours can proſper, if wee haue not firſt ſent this meſſenger on our errād.
                     After this ſilent, and inſenſible preparation; Nehemiah moues his ſuit to the King; not yet at once; but by meet degrees; firſt hee craues leaue for his iourney, and for the building: then he craues ayd for both; Both are granted; Nehemiah departs furniſhed

with letters to the gouernours, for a conuoy; with letters to the keeper of the Kings forreſt for timber. Not more full of deſire, then hope.
                     Who euer put his hand to any great worke for the behoofe of Gods Church, without oppoſition? As the wals of the Temple found buſie enemies, ſo ſhall the walls of the City; and theſe ſo much more; as they promiſe more ſecurity and ſtrength to Ieruſalem: Sanballat the Deputie-Lieutenant of the Moabites, and Tobiab, the like officer to the Ammonites, and Geſhem, to the Arabians, are galled with enuy at the ariuall of a man authorized to ſeek the welfare of the children of Iſrael: There cannot bee a greater

vexation to wicked hearts, then to ſee the ſpiritual Ieruſalem in any likelihood of proſperity. Euill ſpirits and men need no other torment, then their owne deſpight.
                     This wiſe Courtier hath learnt that ſecrecy is the ſureſt way of any important diſpatch. His errand could not but be known to the gouernors; their furtherance was inioyned for the prouiſion of materialls; elſe the walls of Ieruſalem had ouer-lookt the firſt notice of their heathē-neighbors. Without any noiſe doth Nehemiah ariſe in the dead of night, and taking ſome few into his companie, none into his counſaile, hee ſecretly rounds the decayed wals of Ieruſalem, and viewes the breaches,

and obſerues the gates; and returnes home in ſilence, ioying in himſelfe to fore-ſee thoſe reparations, which none of the inhabitants did once dreame of: At laſt, when hee had fully digeſted this great worke in his owne breſt, hee cals the rulers and Citizens together, and hauing condoled with them, the common diſtreſſe, and reproach, hee tells them of the hand of his God, which was good vpon him; hee ſhewes them the gracious commiſſion of the King, his maſter, for that good worke. They anſwer him with a zealous incouragement of each other, Let vs riſe vp and build▪
                         Such an hearty inuitation countenanced by authority hath eaſily ſtrengthened

the hands of the multitude; with what obſeruance and dearneſſe doe they now looke vpon their vnexpected patron? how do they honour him as a man fent from heauen, for the welfare of Ieruſalem? Euery man flyes to his hodde, and trowell, and reioyces to ſecond ſo noble a leader, in laying a ſtone in that wall of their common defence.
                     Thoſe emulous neighbours of theirs, Sanballat, Tobiah, Geſhem, the cheife commanders of Moab, Ammon, Arabia, haue ſoone eſpyed the firſt morter, that is laid vpon that old foundation. Enuy is vſually more quicke-ſighted then loue: And now they ſcornfully apply themſelues to theſe deſpiſed Iewes, and thinke to ſcoffe

them out of their worke: The fauourableſt perſecution of any good cauſe is the laſh of lewd tongues; whether by bitter taunts or by ſcurrilous inuectiues: which it is as impoſſible to auoyd, as neceſſary to contemne. The barking of theſe dogs doth not hinder Nehemiah from walking on his way; profeſſing his confidence in the God of heauen, whoſe work that was; he ſhakes off their impotent malice, and goes on cheerfully to build: Euery Iſraelite knowes his ſtation. Eliaſhib the high Prieſt, and the reſt of that ſacred tribe put the firſt hand to this worke; they build the ſheep-gate, and ſanctifie it; and in it, all the reſt. As the firſt fruits of the field, ſo the firſt ſtones

of the wall, are hallowed to God, by the conſecration of thoſe deuout agents: That buſineſſe is like to proſper which beginnes with God.
                     No man was idle, no part was intermitted; All Ieruſalem was at once encompaſſed with buſie labourers. It cannot bee, but the ioynt-indeauors of faithfull harts muſt raiſe the walles of the Church.
                     Now Sanballat, and his brethren, find ſome matter to ſpend their ſcoffes vpon; What doe theſe feeble Iewes? will they fortifie themſelues? will they ſacrifice? will they make an end in a day? will they reuiue the ſtones out of the heapes of rubbiſh which are burnt?
                     
                     How baſely do carnall minds

thinke of the proiects, and actions of Gods children; therefore vilifying them, becauſe they meaſure them by no other line, then outward probability. Oh fooliſh Moabites, this worke is Gods, and therefore in deſpight of all your tonges and hands, it ſhall proſper: He heares you whom yee haue blaſphemed, and ſhall turne your reproach vpon your own heads.
                     And, thou proud Ammonite, that couldſt ſay, If a Foxe goe vpon their ſtone-wall, hee ſhall breake it downe; ſhalt well find, that all the woluiſh troopes of your confederats ſhall not bee able to remoue one ſtone of this ſure fortification; Whiles Moab and Ammon repine and bluſter in vaine this wal ſhal riſe, &amp; when Moab &amp; Ammon ſhal

lye in the duſt, this wall ſhall ſtand. The morter that hath beene tempered with ſo many teares, and layed with ſo many prayers, cannot but out-laſt all the flints, and marbles of humane confidence.
                     Now the growth of this wall hath turned the mirth of the aduerſaries into rage: Theſe Moabites, Ammonites, Arabians, Aſhdodites conſpire all together, to fight againſt Ieruſalem; and whiles the morter is yet greene, to demoliſh thoſe enuied heapes.
                     What hath this City offended in deſiring to be defenced? what wrong could it be to wiſh a freedome from wrongs? Were this people ſo mighty, that there could be danger in ouer-powring their

neighbours, or in reſiſting a common ſoueraign, there might haue appeared ſome colour for this hoſtile oppoſition; but, alas; what could a deſpiſed handfull doe to the preiudice of either? It is quarrell enough to Ieruſalem that it would not be miſerable.
                     Neither is it otherwiſe with the head of theſe helliſh complices; there needs no other cauſe of his vtmoſt fury, then to ſee a poor ſoule ſtrugling to get out of the reach of his tyrannie. So doe ſauage beaſts briſtle vp themſelues, and make the moſt fierce aſſaults when they are in danger of looſing the prey, which they had once ſeized on.
                     In the meane while, what doth Nehemiah with his Iewes for their

common ſafety? They pray, and watch; they pray vnto God, they watch againſt the enemy.
                     Thus, thus ſhall wee happily preuaile againſt thoſe ſpirituall wickedneſſes, which war againſt our ſoules: No euill can ſurprize vs if we watch; no euill can hurt vs, if we pray; This is the victory that ouercomes the world, euen our faith.
                     
                     There was need of a continued vigilancy; the enemy was not more malicious, then ſubtle, and had ſaid; They ſhall not know, neither ſee, till wee come in the midſt among them, and ſlay them. Open force is not ſo dangerous, as cloſe diſſimulation; They meant to ſeeme Iewes, whiles they were Moabites and Ammonites; and in the

clothes of brethren purpoſed to hide murderers. Neuer is Satan ſo preuailent, as when hee comes transformed into an Angell of light.
                     It was a mercifull prouidence of God, that made theſe mens tongues the blabs of their owne counſell. Many a fearfull deſigne had proſpered, if wickedneſſe could haue beene ſilent. Warning is a lawfull gard to a wiſe aduerſary: Now doth Nehemiah arme his people; and for the time, changes their trowels into ſwords, &amp; ſpeares, and bowes; raiſing vp their courage with a vehement exhortation, to remember the Lord, which is great, and terrible, and to fight for their brethren, their ſonnes, their daughters, their wiues,
                        
and their houſes. Nothing can ſo harten vs to the encountring of any euill, as the remembrance of that infinite power and wiſdome which can either auert, or mittigate, or ſanctifie it: wee could not faint if wee did not forget God.
                     Neceſſity vrges a man to fight for himſelf, loue inables his hand to fight for thoſe which challēge a part in him; where loue meets with neceſſity, there can want no indeuor of victory; Neceſſity can make euen cowards, valiant; loue makes the valiant, vnreſiſtable: Nehemiah doth not therefore perſwade theſe Iewes to fight for themſelues, but for theirs: The inlargement of the intereſt, and danger, cannot but quicken the dulleſt ſpirits.
                     
                        
Diſcouered counſels are alreadie preuented; Theſe ſerpents dye by being firſt ſeene; When the enemies heard that it was knowne vnto vs, they let fall their plot. Could wee deſcry the enterpriſes of Satan, that tempter would returne aſhamed.
                     It is a ſafe point of wiſedome to carrie a iealous eye ouer thoſe, whom we haue once found hollow, and hoſtile: From that time forth Nehemiah diuided the taske, betwixt the trowell, and the ſword; ſo diſpoſing of euery Iſraelite, that whiles one hand was a Maſon, the other was a ſouldier: one is for worke, the other for defence. Oh liuely image of the Church militant, wherein euery one labours, weaponed;

wherein there is neither an idle ſouldier, nor a ſecure workman: euery one ſo builds, as that he is ready to ward temptations; euerie one ſo wields the ſword of the ſpirit, for defence, that, withall, hee builds vp himſelfe in his moſt holy faith; here is neither a fruitleſſe valour, nor an vnſafe diligence.
                     But what can our weapons auaile vs, if there be not meanes to warne vs of an enemie? Without a Trumpet we are armed in vain. The worke is great and large, and we are ſeparated vpon the wall, one farre from another: Yea, ſo farre as the vtmoſt bounds of the earth, are wee ſeparated one from another, vpon the wals of the ſpirituall Ieruſalem; onely the ſacred Trumpets

of God, call vs, who are diſtant in place, to a combination in profeſſion. And who are thoſe Trumpets, but the publike meſſengers of God, of whom God hath ſaid; If the Watchmen ſee the 
                        Ezee. 33. 6. 
                        ſword come, and blow not the trumpet, and the people be not warned, if the ſword come, and take any perſon from among them, hee is taken away in his iniquitie, but his blood will I require at the watchmans hand. Wo bee to vs if we ſound not; if the ſound we giue be vncertaine: wo be to our people, if when we premoniſh them of enemies, of iudgements, they ſit ſtill vnmoued, not buckling themſelues to a reſiſtance, to a preuention.
                     It is a mutuall ayd, to which theſe Trumpets inuite vs; wee

might fight apart, without the ſignals of warre; In what place yee heare the ſound of the Trumpet, reſort ye thither vnto vs. There can bee no ſafety to the Church, but wher euery man thinkes his life, and welfare conſiſts in his fellowes; Conioyned forces may proſper, ſingle oppoſitions are deſperare: All hearts and hands muſt meet in the common quarrell.
                  
                  
                     
                     NEHEMIAH redreſsing the extortion of the Iewes.
                     
                        WIth what difficultie doe theſe miſerable Iewes ſettle in their Ieruſalem? The feare of foraine enemies doth not more afflict them, then the extortion of their owne: Dearth is added vnto warre: Miſeries doe not ſtay for a mannerly ſucceſſion to each other, but in a rude importunity throng in, at once. Babel may be

built with eaſe, but whoſoeuer goes about to raiſe the walls of Gods Citie, ſhall haue his hands full: The incurſion of publike enemies may be preuented with vigilancy and power; but there is no defence againſt the ſecret gripes of oppreſſion.
                     There is no remedy, the Iewes are ſo taken vp with their trowel, and ſword, for the time, that they cannot attend their trades; ſo as, whiles the wall did riſe, their eſtates muſt needs impayre: Euen in the cheapeſt ſeaſon they muſt needs be poore, that earned nothing but the publike ſafetie, how much more in a common ſcarcity? their houſes, lands, vineyards are therefore morgaged, yea their very skins are ſold, for corn,

to their brethren: Neceſſity forces them to ſell that, which it was cruelty to buy; What will we not, what muſt we not part with, for life? The couetous rulers did not conſider the occaſions of this want, but the aduantage. Sometimes, a bargaine may bee as vnmercifull as a robbery: Charity muſt be the rule in all contracts; the violation whereof, whether in the matter, or the price, cannot but be ſinfull.
                     There could not bee a iuſter ground of expoſtulation then this of the oppreſſed Iewes: Our fleſh is as the fleſh of our brethren, our children as their children; and loe, we bring into bondage our ſonnes and our daughters: whiles there is no difference in nature, why ſhould there bee

ſuch an iniurious diſproportion in condition. Euen the ſame fleſh may beare a iuſt inequality; Some may be rulers, whiles others are ſubiect; Some wealthy, others poore; but why thoſe wealthy rulers ſhould tyrannize ouer thoſe poore inferiours, and turne brotherhood into bondage no reaſon can be giuen but lawleſſe ambition; If there were one fleſh of Peeres, another of Peaſants, there ſhould be ſome colour for the proud impoſitions of the great, as becauſe the fleſh of beaſts is in a lower ranke then ours, we kill, we deuoure it at pleaſure; but now, ſince the large body of mankinde conſiſts of the ſame fleſh, why ſhould the hand ſtrike the foot? And if one fleſh may

challenge meet reſpects from vs, how much more one ſpirit; The ſpirit is more noble, then the fleſh is baſe; the fleſh is dead without the ſpirit; the ſpirit without the fleſh, actiue and immortall; Our ſoule, though ſhapeleſſe, and immateriall, is more apparently one, then the fleſh; And if the vnity of our humane ſpirit call vs to a mutuall care, and tenderneſſe in our cariage, each to other, how much more of the diuine? by that we are men, by this we are Chriſtians: As the ſoule animates vs to a naturall life, ſo doth Gods Spirit animate the ſoule to an heauenly; which is ſo one; that it cannot bee deuided. How ſhould that one ſpirit cauſe vs ſo farre to forget all naturall,

and ciuill differences, as not to contemne, not to oppreſſe any whom it informeth?
                     They are not Chriſtians, not men, that can inioy the miſeries of their brethren, whether in the fleſh or ſpirit.
                     Good Nehemiah cannot chooſe but bee much moued at the barbarous extortion of the people; and now, like an vnpartiall gouernour, hee rebukes the Rulers and Nobles, whoſe hand was thus bloody with oppreſſion. As of fiſhes, ſo of men, the leſſer are a prey to the great: It is an ill vſe made of power, whē the weight of it ſerues onely to cruſh the weake. There were no liuing amongſt men had not God ordained higher then the higheſt;

and yet higher then they. Eminency of place cannot bee better improued, then by taking down mighty offenders.
                     If nobility doe embaſe it ſelfe to any foule ſinne, it is ſo much more worthy of coertion, by how much the perſon is of greater marke.
                     The iuſtice of this reproofe could not but ſhame impudence it ſelfe; Wee after our abilitie haue redeemed our brethren the Iewes which were ſold to the heathen, and will you ſell your brethren, or ſhall they be ſold to vs? Shall they finde at home that yoke of bondage which they had put off abroad? whiles they are ſtill Iewes, ſhall we turne Aſſyrians? If they muſt be ſlaues, why not rather to

enemies, then to brethren? How much more tollerable were a forayne ſeruitude, then a domeſticall: Be aſhamed, ô ye Nobles of Iſrael, to renue Babylon in Ieruſalem. I maruell not if the offenders be ſtricken dumbe with ſo vnanſwerable an expoſtulation; Guiltineſſe, and confuſion haue ſtopt their mouthes.
                     Many of thoſe who haue not had grace enough to refraine ſin, yet are not ſo vtterly void of grace as to maintaine ſinne; Our afterwits are able to diſcerne a kinde of vnreaſonableneſs in thoſe wicked actions, which the firſt appearance repreſents vnto vs plauſible. Gaine leads in ſinne, but ſhame followes it out. There are thoſe that are bold and witty to

beare out commodious, or pleaſant euills; neither could theſe Iewiſh enormities, haue wanted ſome colours of defence; Their ſtocke was their owne, which might haue beene otherwiſe improued, to no leſſe profit; The offer, the ſuit of theſe bargaines was from the ſellers; Theſe eſcheates fell into their hands, vnſought; neither did their contract cauſe the neede of their brethren, but releeue it: But their conſcience will not beare this plea. I know not whether the maintenance of the leaſt euill bee not worſe, then the commiſſion of the greateſt; This may bee of frailty, that argues obſtinacy: There is hope of that man that can bluſh, and be ſilent.
                     
                        
After conuiction of the fact, it is ſeaſonable for Nehemiah, to perſwade reformation: No oratory is ſo powerfull, as that of mildneſſe: eſpecially when we haue to doe with thoſe, who either through ſtomach, or greatneſſe, may not indure a rough reproofe: The drops that fall eaſily vpon the corne, ripen, and fill the eare, but the ſtormy ſhowers that fal with violence, beat down the ſtalkes flat to the earth, and lay whole fields, without hope of recouery. Who can reſiſt this ſweet &amp; ſoueraign reprehenſion; Ought yee not to walke in the feare of our God, becauſe of the reproach of the heathen, our enemies? Did we dwell alone in the midſt of the earth, yet the feare of our God

ſhould ouer-awe our wayes; but now that we dwell in the midſt of our enemies, whoſe eies are bent vpon all our actions, whoſe tongues are as ready to blaſpheme God, as we to offend him, how carefully ſhould we auoid thoſe ſins, which may draw ſhame vpon our profeſſion?
                     Now, the ſcandall is worſe then the fact; Thus, ſhall religion ſuffer more from the heathen, then our brethren doe from vs: If iuſtice, if charity cannot ſway with vs, yet, let the ſcornfull inſultations of the prophane Gentiles, afright vs frō theſe preſſures. No ingenuous diſpoſition can be ſo tender of his own diſgrace, as the true Iſraelite is of the reproch of his God: What is it that

hee will not rather refraine, doe, ſuffer, then that glorious name ſhall hazard a blemiſh? They cannot want outward retentiues from ſin, that liue either among friends, or enemies; if friends, they may not be grieued, if enemies, they may not be prouoked: Thoſe that would liue well, muſt ſtand in awe of all eyes; Euen thoſe that are without the Church yet may not bee without our regard: No perſon can bee ſo contemptible, as that his cenſure ſhould be contemned.
                     In diſſuading from ſinne, reaſon it ſelfe cannot preuaile more then example. I likewiſe, and my brethren, and my ſeruants might exact of them money, and corne. But from the time that I was appointed to
                        
                        the charge of Iudah, I, and my brethren haue not eaten the bread of the gouernour. Hee ſhall neuer rule well, that doth all that hee may: It is not ſafe for either part, that a Prince ſhould liue at the height of his power: And if the greateſt abate of their right, is it for inferiors to extort? Had Nehemiah aimed at his own greatneſſe, no man could haue had fairer pretences for his gaine.
                     
                        The former gouernors that were before him were chargeable vnto the people, and had taken of them bread and wine, beſides fourty ſhekels of ſiluer. His foot had not firſt trod in this commodious path; it was beaten by the ſteps of his predeceſſors; neither did any of them walke beſide it: How euer it

might bee enuious to raiſe new taxations, yet to continue thoſe he found vnrepined at, had been out of the reach of exception: A good Gouernour lookes not ſo much what hath beene done, as what ſhould bee; Precedents are not the rule, whereby hee rules, but iuſtice, but piety. So did not I, becauſe of the feare of the Lord: Lawes are not a ſtraiter curbe to ſubiects, then conſcience is to good Princes.
                     They dare not doe what they cannot doe charitably: what aduantage can they thinke it to bee from vnder the controllment of men, when the God of heauen notes, and puniſhes their offences. Who ſo walketh by this rule, can neither erre, nor miſ-cary; It

is not truſting to the externall remedies of ſinne, either they are not alwaies preſent; or if preſent, not powerfull enough; but if the feare of God haue once taken vp the heart, it goes euer with vs, and is ſtrong enough to ouer-maiſter the forceableſt temptation.
                     Therefore muſt theſe Iewes follow this example of Nehemiah, becauſe he followed not the example of his predeceſſors; becauſe he left their euill, they muſt imitate his good. In vaine ſhall rulers aduiſe againſt their owne practice; when they lead the way, they may well challenge to bee followed: Seldome hath it been euer ſeene that great perſons haue not beene ſeconded in euill, why ſhould not their power ſerue to

make patternes of their vertues?
                     Thus well did it ſpeed with Nehemiah; his mercifull cariage, and zealous ſuit haue drawne the Rulers to a promiſe of reſtitution; We will reſtore them, and will require nothing of them, ſo will we doe as thou ſayeſt.
                     
                     It is no ſmall aduantage that theſe Nobles muſt forgoe, in their releaſes: there cannot be a better ſigne of a ſound amendment, thē that we can be content to be looſers by our repentance; Many formall penitents haue yeelded to part with ſo much of their ſinne, as may abate nothing of their profit; as if theſe Rulers ſhould haue beene willing to reſtore the perſons, but withall ſhould haue ſtood ſtifly to require their ſums:

This whining and partiall ſatiſfaction had been thankleſſe. True remorſe inlargeth the heart, and openeth the hand to a bountifull redemption of our errors.
                     Good purpoſes doe too often coole in time, and vaniſh into a careleſſe forgetfulneſſe; Nehemiah feared this iſſue of theſe holy reſolutions; and therfore he proſecutes them in their firſt heat; not leauing theſe promiſes, till he had ſecured them, with an oath; The Prieſts are called for, that in their mouthes, the adiuration may be more ſolemne, &amp; ſacred; It is the beſt point of wiſedome to take the firſt opportunity of fixing good motions, which otherwiſe are of themſelues light, &amp; ſleightie. To make all yet more ſure,

their oathes are croſſe-barred with his execration. Alſo I ſhooke my lap, and ſaid, ſo God ſhake out euery man from his houſe, and from his labour that performeth not this promiſe, euen thus be he ſhaken out, and emptied, and all the Congregation ſaid, Amen. A promiſe, an oath, a curſe, are paſſed vpon this act; now, no Iſraelite dares falter in the execution: When we haue a ſin in chace, it is good to follow it home, not ſlackning our purſuit till we haue fully preuailed; and when it is once falne vnder our hands, we cannot kill it too much.
                     Now Nehemiah hauing thus happily deliuered his people frō a domeſticall captiuity, commēds his ſeruice to the gracious remuneration

of the Almighty; Thinke vpon me my God, for good, according to all that I haue done for this people; Therfore doth hee refuſe the bread of the Gouernour, that hee may receiue the reward of the Gouernour of heauen: Had hee taken a temporary recompence, both he and it had beene forgotten, now he hath made an happy change for eternity. Not that he pleades his merit, but ſues for mercy; neither doth he pray to bee remembred for his work, but according to his worke.
                     Our good deedes as they are well accepted of God, ſo they ſhall not goe vnrewarded; and what God will giue, why may not wee craue. Doubtleſſe, as we may offer vp our honeſt obediences

vnto God, ſo we may expect and beg his promiſed retributions; not out of a proud conceit of the worth of our earnings, who at the beſt are no other then vnprofitable ſeruants; but out of a faithfull dependance vpon his pact of bounty, who cannot bee leſſe then his word: O God, if we doe ought that is good, it is thine act, and not ours; crowne thine owne worke in vs, and take thou the glory of thine own mercies.
                     Whiles Nehemiah is buſie in reforming abuſes, at home; the enemy is plotting againſt him, abroad; Sanballat, and Tobiah, and Geſhem the Arabian conſpire againſt his life, and in him, againſt the peace of Ieruſalem: What open

hoſtility could not do, they hope to effect by pretence of treaties: Foure ſeuerall meſſages call Nehemiah to a friendly meeting. Diſtruſt is a ſure gard. The wiſe gouernor hath learn'd to ſuſpect the hollow fauours of an enemy; and to returne them, with ſafe and iuſt excuſes. I cannot come downe, why ſhould the worke ceaſe whiles I leaue it, and come downe to you? I doe not heare him ſay, You intend miſchiefe to mee; I will not come forth to you; though this were the proper cauſe of his forbearance, but he hee turnes them off with an anſwer, that had as much truth, as reſeruedneſſe. Fraud is the fitlieſt anſwered with ſubtlety: Euen innocencie is allowed a lawfull craft; That

man is in an ill caſe, that conceales no truth from an aduerſary.
                     What intreaties cannot doe, ſhall bee attempted by threats; Sanballats ſeruant comes now the fifth time, with an open letter, importing dangerous intimation, wherein is written, It is reported among the heathen and Gaſhmu ſaith it, that the Iewes thinke to rebell; for which cauſe thou buildeſt the wall that thou mayeſt be their King. It is reported: and what falſhood may not plead this warant
                           ••
                         What can be more lying then report? Among the beathen: and who is more Ethnick then Sanballat? what Pagan can be worſe then a mungrel Idolater? And Gaſhmu ſaith it, Aske my fellow elſe; This Arabian was one of thoſe three heads

of all the hoſtile combination, againſt Ieruſalem, againſt Nehemiah; It would be wide with innocēce if enemies might bee allow'd to accuſe.
                     
                        That the Iewes thinke to rebell: A ſtale ſuggeſtion, but, once, powerfull; Malice hath learn'd to miſcall all actions; where the hands cannot bee taxed, very thoughts are preiudged: For which cauſe thou buildeſt the wall, that thou mayeſt be their King; Hee was neuer true Iſraelite that hath not paſſed ſpightfull ſlanders, and miſconſtructions: Artaxerxes knew his ſeruant too well, to beleeue any rumour, that ſhould haue beene ſo ſhameleſſe; The ambition of Nehemiah was wel known to reach onely to the cup, not to

the Scepter of his Soueraign: And yet, to make vp a ſound tale, Prophets are ſuborned to preach, There is a King in Iudah: as if that loyall gouernor had corrupted the pulpits alſo; and had taught them the language of treaſon.
                     But what of all this? what if ſome falſe tongue haue whiſpered ſuch idle tales? It is not ſafe for thee, O Nehemiah, to contemn report: Perhaps this newes ſhal fly to the Court, and worke thee a deadly diſpleaſure ere thou canſt know thy ſelfe traduced; Come therefore, and let vs take counſell together: Surely that man cannot be ſparing of any thing, that is prodigall of his reputation. If ought vnder heauen can fetch Nehemiah out of his hold, it is the

care of his fame. But, that wary gouernour ſees a net ſpred neere vnto this ſtall; and therfore keeps aloofe, not without contempt of thoſe ſlie deuiſes. There are no ſuch things done as thou ſayeſt, but thou faineſt them out of thine owne heart: Some imputations are beſt anſwered with a neglectiue deniall: It fals out often that plaine dealing puts craft out of countenāce,
                     Since neither force nor fraud can kill Nehemiah, they will now try to draw him into a ſinne, and thereby into a reproach; O God, that any Prophets tongue ſhould be mercenary! Shemaiah the Seer, is hyred by Tobiah, and Sanballat, to affright the Gouernour, with the noyſe of his intended murder; and to aduiſe him for ſhelter,

to flye to the forbidden refuge of the Temple. The colour was faire. Violence is meant to thy perſon, no place but one can promiſe thee ſafetie; The City hath as yet no gates; come therefore, and ſhut thy ſelfe vp in the Temple, there onely ſhalt thou be free from all aſſaults.
                     And what if Nehemiah had harkened to this counſell? Sinne, and ſhame had followed; That holy place was for none but perſons ſacred; ſuch as were priuiledged by blood, and function; others ſhould preſume, and offend in entring; and now, what would the people ſay? What ſhall become of vs whiles our Gouernour hides his head for feare? When ſhall wee finde a

Temple to ſecure vs? What doe wee depending vpon a cowardly leader?
                     Well did Nehemiah fore-caſt theſe circumſtances, both of act, and euent, and therefore reſoluing to diſtruſt a Prophet that perſwaded him to the violation of a Law, hee reiects the motion with ſcorne; Should ſuch a man as I flee? Should I goe into the Temple to ſaue my life? I will not goe: It is fit for great perſons to ſtand vpon the honour of their places; Their very ſtations ſhould put thoſe ſpirits into them, that ſhould make them hate to ſtoope vnto baſe conditions.
                     Had God ſent this meſſage, wee know hee hath power to diſpence with his owne Lawes;

but well might the contradiction of a Law argue the meſſage not ſent of God. God as he is one, ſo doth hee perfitly agree with himſelfe. If any priuate ſpirit croſſe a written word, let him be accurſed.
                  
                  
                     
                     AHASVERVS Feaſting, VASHTI caſt off, ESTHER choſen.
                     
                     
                        WHat bounds can Eſter 1, 2. be ſet to humane ambition? Ahaſuerus, that is, Xerxes, the ſonne of Darius is already the King of an hundred, and ſeuen and twenty Prouinces, and now is ready to fight for more. Hee hath newly ſubdued Egypt, and is now addreſſing himſelf for the conqueſt of Greece. Hee cannot hope euer

to ſee all the land that hee poſſeſſeth, and yet hee cannot be quiet, whiles he heares of more. Leſſe then two ells of earth ſhall ere long ſerue him, whom, for the time, a whole world ſhall ſcarce ſatisfie; In vaine ſhall a man ſtriue to haue that which he cannot inioy, and to inioy ought by mere relation; It is a windy happineſſe that is ſought in the exaggeration of thoſe titles, which are taken vpon others credit, without the ſenſe of the owner: Nothing can fill the heart of man, but he that made it.
                     This great Monarch, partly in triumph of the great victories, that he hath lately wonne in Egypt, and partly, for the animation of his Princes, and ſouldiers,

to his future exploits, makes a feaſt, like himſelfe, royall and magnificent.
                     What is greatneſſe if it bee not ſhowed? And wherein can greatneſſe bee better ſhowne, then in the atcheiuments of warre, and the intertainments of peace?
                     All other feaſts were but hunger to this of Ahaſuerus, whether we regard the number of gueſts, or the largeneſſe of preparation, or continuance of time: During the ſpace of a whole halfe yeare, all the tables were ſumptuouſly furniſhed for all commers from India, to Ethyopia; A world of meat was euery day dreſſed for a world of men; Euery meale was ſo ſet on, as if it ſhould haue beene the laſt: Yet all this long

feaſt hath an end; and all this glory is ſhut vp in forgetfulneſſe; What is Ahaſuerus the better, that his Peeres then ſaid, hee was incomparably great? What are his Peeres the better, that they were feaſted? Happy is he that eates bread, and drinkes new wine in the Kingdome of God; this banquet is for eternity, without intermiſſion, without ſatiety.
                     What variety of habits, of languages, of manners, met at the boards of Ahaſuerus? What confluence of ſtrange gueſts was there now to Shuſhan? And, leſt the glory of this great King might ſeeme, like ſome coorſe picture, only faire a farre off; after the Princes and Nobles of the remote Prouinces, all the people

of Shuſhan are intertained, for ſeuen daies with equall pompe and ſtate; The ſpacious Court of the Palace is turned into a Royall Hall, the walls are rich hangings, the pillars of marble, the beds of ſiluer and gold, the pauement of porphirie curiouſly checkered; The wine and the veſſels ſtroue whether ſhould bee the richer; no man drunke in worſe then gold; and whiles the mettall was the ſame, the forme of each cup was diuers; the attendants was anſwerable to the cheare; and the freedome matched both: Here was no compulſion, either to the meaſure, or quality of the draught; euery mans rule was his owne choice. Who can but bluſh to ſee forced healths in Chriſtian

banquets, when the ciuility of very pagans commands liberty.
                     I cannot but enuy the modeſty of heathen Dames; Vaſhti the Queene, and her Ladies, with all the ſeuerall rankes of that ſexe, feaſt apart; intertaining each other, with a baſhfull curteſie, without wantonneſſe, without that wild ſcurrility, which vſeth to haunt promiſcuous meetings: Oh ſhamefull vnchaſtity of thoſe looſe Chriſtians, who muſt feed their luſt, whiles they fill their bellies; and thinke the feaſt vnperfit, where they may not ſate their eye no leſſe then their palate.
                     The laſt day of this pompous feaſt is now come: King Ahaſuerus is ſo much more cheerfull,

by how much his gueſts are neerer to their diſmiſſion. Euery one is wont to cloſe vp his curteſie with ſo much more paſſion, as the laſt acts vſe to make the deeper impreſſion; And now, that he might at once amaze, and indeare the beholders, Vaſhti the Queene in all her royalty, is called for; Her ſight ſhall ſhut vp the feaſt, that the Princes and people may ſay, How happy is King Ahaſuerus, not ſo much in this greatneſſe, as in that beauty.
                     Seuen officers of the chamber are ſent to cary the meſſage, to attend her entrance, and are returned with a deniall: Perhaps Vaſhti thought; What meanes this vncouth motion? More then ſixe moneths hath this feaſt continued;

and, all this while wee haue inioyed the wonted liberty of our ſexe; Were the King ſtill himſelfe, this command could not bee ſent; it is the wine, and not hee, that is guiltie of this errand; Is it for mee to humour him in ſo vaine a deſire? Will it agree with our modeſt reſeruedneſſe, to offer our ſelues to bee gazed at by millions of eyes? Who knowes what wanton attempts may follow vpon this vngouerned exceſſe? This very meſſage argues that wit, and reaſon haue yeelded their places to that beſotting liquor. Nothing but abſence can ſecure vs from ſome vnbeſeeming profer; neither doubt I, but the King when he returnes to himſelfe, will giue me thankes

for ſo wiſe a forbearance.
                     Thus, vpon the conceit (as is likely) that her preſence would bee either needleſſe, or vnſafe. Vaſhti refuſeth to come. Although perhaps her great ſpirits thought much to receiue a command frō the hand of officers.
                     The blood that is once inflamed with wine, is apt to boyle with rage: Ahaſuerus is very wroth with this indigne repulſe: It was the oſtentation of his glory, and might, that hee affected, before thoſe Princes, Peeres, people; and now that ſeemes eclipſed, in the ſhutting vp of all his magnificence, with the diſgraceful affront of a woman. It vexes him to thinke, that thoſe Nobles, whom hee meant to ſend away aſtoniſhed

with the admiration of his power, and maieſty, ſhould now ſay: What boots it Ahaſuerus to rule afarre off, when hee cannot command at home? In vaine doth he boaſt to gouerne Kings, whiles hee is checked by a woman.
                     What euer were the intentions of Vaſhti, ſurely her diſobedience was inexcuſable; it is not for a good wife to iudge of her huſbands will, but to execute it: neither wit, nor ſtomacke may carie her into a curious inquiſition into the reaſons of an inioyned charge, much leſſe to a reſiſtance: but in an hood-winkt ſimplicity ſhe muſt follow, whither ſhee is led; as one that holds her chiefe praiſe to conſiſt in ſubiection.
                     
                        
Where ſhould the perfection of wiſedome dwell, if not in the Courts of great Princes? or what can the treaſures of Monarchs purchaſe more invaluably precious, then learned and iudicious attendance? Or who can be ſo fit for honour as the wiſeſt.
                     I doubt how Ahaſuerus could haue beene ſo great, if his throne had not beene ſtill compaſſed with them that knew the times, and vnderſtood the law, and iudgement. Theſe were his Oracles in all his doubts: Theſe are now conſulted in this difficulty; neither muſt their aduice bee ſecretly whiſpered, in the Kings eare, but publikely deliuered in the audience of all the Princes. It is a perillous way that theſe ſages

are called to goe, betwixt an huſband and wife; eſpecially of ſuch power, and eminency; yet Memucan feares not to paſſe an heauie ſentence againſt Queen Vaſhti. Vaſhti, the Queene hath not done wrong to the King onely, but alſo to all the Princes, and all the people, that are in all the Prouinces of the King Ahaſuerus. A deepe and ſore commination; iniuries are ſo much more intolerable, as they are dilated vnto more; thoſe offences which are of narrow extent, may receiue an eaſie ſatisfaction; the amends are not poſſible, where the wrong is vniuerſall: For this deed of the Queene ſhall come abroad to all women, ſo that they ſhall deſpiſe their husbands in their eyes: Indeed ſo publique a fact muſt needs fly;

That concourſe gaue fit opportunity to diffuſe it all the world ouer; The examples of the great are eaſily drawne into rules. Bad leſſons are apt to be taken out; as honour, ſo contempt fals downe from the head to the skirts; neuer aſcends from the skirts to the head.
                     Theſe wiſe men are ſo much the more ſenſible of this danger, as they ſaw it more likely, the caſe might proue their owne. Likewiſe ſhall the Ladies of Perſia and Media ſay this day vnto all the Kings Princes. The firſt precedents of euill muſt bee carefully auoided, if wee care to keepe a conſtant order in good. Prudence cannot better beſtirre it ſelfe, then in keeping miſchiefe from home.
                     
                        
The foundation of this doom of Memucan is not laid ſo deep for nothing; If it pleaſe the King let there goe a royall commandement from him, and let it bee written among the lawes of the Perſians, and Medians, that it bee not altered, that Vaſhti come no more before Ahaſuerus; and let the King giue her royall eſtate to another that is better then ſhe. How bold a word was this, and how hazardous? Had Ahaſuerus more loued the beauty of Vaſhti, then his honor, Memucan had ſpoken this againſt his owne life: Howſoeuer, a Queene of ſo great ſpirit, could not want ſtrength of fauour, and faction, in the Perſian Court; which could not but take fire at ſo deſperate a motiō. Faithfull ſtateſmen, ouerlooking priuate

reſpects, muſt bend their eies vpon publique dangers, labouring to preuent a common miſchiefe, though with the aduenture of their owne. Nature had taught theſe Pagans the neceſſitie of a female ſubiection; and the hate and ſcorne of a proud diſobedience. They haue vnlearned the very dictates of Nature, that can abide the head to bee ſet below the ribbe.
                     I cannot ſay but Vaſhti was worthy of a ſharpe cenſure; I cannot ſay ſhe was worthy a repudiation. This plaiſter drew too hard; It was but heathen iuſtice to puniſh the wiues diſobedience in one indifferent act, with a diuorce: Nothing but the violation of the mariage-bed, can either

breake, or vntye the knot of mariage. Had ſhe not been a Queen, had not that contemptuous act beene publique, the ſentence had not beene ſo hard; now the puniſhment muſt be exemplary, leſt the ſin ſhould be ſo. Many a one had ſmarted leſſe, if their perſons, if their places had beene meaner.
                     The King, the Princes approue this heauy iudgment of Memucan; It is not in the power of the faire face of Vaſhti, to warrant her ſtomacke: No doubt many meſſages paſſed ere the rigour of this execution: That great hart knows not to relēt, but will rather break, then yeeld to an humble deprecation. When the ſtone, and the ſteele meet, fire is ſtricken; it is a ſoft anſwer that appeaſeth wrath.

                        Vaſhti is caſt off, Letters are ſent from the King, into all his Prouinces, to command that euery man ſhould rule at home; The Court affords thē an awfull patterne of authority: Had not Ahaſuerus doted much vpon Vaſhties beauty, hee had not called her forth at the feaſt, to be wōdredat, by his Peeres &amp; people; yet now hee ſo feeles the wound of his reputation, that he forgets he euer felt any wound of his affection. Euen the greateſt loue may be ouer-ſtrained; It is not ſafe preſuming vpon the deepeſt aſſurances of dearneſſe: There is no heart that may not be eſtranged. It is not poſſible that great Princes ſhould want ſoothing vp in all their inclinations, in all their actions:

Whiles Ahaſuerus is following the chace of his ambition, in the wars of Greece, his followers are prouiding for his luſt at home; Nothing could ſound more pleaſing to a carnall eare, then that all the faire yong virgins, throughout all his dominions, ſhould be gathered into his palace at Shuſhan, for his aſſay, and choice: The decree is ſoone publiſhed; The charge is committed to Hege, the Kings Chamberlain, both of their purification, and ornaments.
                     What ſtrife, what emulation was now, amongſt all the Perſian damoſells, that either were, or thought themſelues faire? Euery one hopes to bee a Queene; and ſees no reaſon why any other

ſhould be thought more excellent; How happy were wee, if we could be ſo ambitious of our eſpouſalls to the King of heauen?
                     Amongſt all this throng of Virgins, God hath prouided a wife for Ahaſuerus; hauing determined his choice, where moſt aduantage ſhall riſe to his forlorne people.
                     The Iewes were miſerably ſcattered ouer the world, in that wofull deportation vnder Iechoniah; ſcarce an handfull of them returned to Ieruſalem; the reſt remaine ſtill diſperſed where they may but haue leaue to liue. There are many thouſands of them turned ouer with the Babylonian Monarchy, to the Perſian; amōgſt the reſt, was Mordecai, the ſonne

of Iair, of the tribe of Beniamin; a man of no meane note, or ability; who, liuing in Shuſhan, had brought vp Hadaſſah, or Eſther, his vncles daughter, in a liberall faſhion; It was happy for this orphane, that in a region of captiuity, ſhee light into ſuch good hands; Her wiſe kinſman finds it fit, that her breeding, and habit ſhold be Perſian-like; In outward and ciuill formes, there was no need to vary from the heathen; her religion muſt bee her owne; the reſt was ſo altogether theirs, that her very nation was not diſcerned.
                     The ſame God that had giuen incomparable beauty to this Ieweſſe, gaue her alſo fauor in the eies of Hegai, the keeper of the

women; Shee is not only taken into the Perſian Court, as one of the ſelected virgins, but obſerued with more then ordinary reſpect; all neceſſaries for her ſpeedie purification are brought to her; Seuen maides are allowed for her attendance, and the beſt &amp; moſt honorable place in that Seraglio is allotted to her; As if this great officer had deſigned her for a Queene, before the choice of his maſter.
                     What ſtrange preparation was here for the impure bed of an heathen? Euery Virgin muſt be ſixe moneths purified with oyle of myrrhe, and ſix other months perfumed with ſweet odors, beſides thoſe ſpeciall receits, that were allowed to each, vpon their

owne election: O God, what care, what coſt is requiſite to that ſoule which ſhould be addreſſed a fit Bride for thine holy and glorious Maieſty?
                     When wee haue ſcoured our ſelues with the moſt cleanſing oyle of our repentance, and haue perfumed our ſelues with thy beſt graces, and our perfecteſt obedience, it is the onely praiſe of thy mercy, that we may bee accepted.
                     The other Virgins paſſed their probation, vnregarded; when Eſthers turne came, though ſhee required nothing; but tooke what was giuen her; though ſhe affected nothing, but brought that face, that demeanure, which nature had caſt vpon her, no eye

ſees her without admiration; the King takes ſuch pleaſure in her beauty, that, contemning all the other vulgar formes, his choyce is fully fixed vpon her; All things muſt proſper, where God hath intended the ſuceeſſe: the moſt wiſe prouidence of the Almighty fetches his proiects from farre; The preſeruation and aduantage of his owne people is in hand; for the contriuing of this, Vaſhti ſhal be abandoned; the virgins ſhall be choſen; Eſther only ſhall pleaſe Ahaſuerus; Mordecai ſhall diſpleaſe Haman; Hamans ruine ſhall raiſe Mordecai: The purpoſes of God cannot be iudged by his remote actions; only the accōpliſhment ſhowes his deſignes; In the meane time, it pleaſeth him to

looke another way, then hee moues; and to worke his owne ends, by arbitrary, and vnlikely accidents.
                     None but Eſther ſhall ſucceed Vaſhti; ſhe onely caries the heart of Ahaſuerus from all her ſexe; The royall Crowne is ſet vpon her head; And, as Vaſhti was caſt off at a feaſt, ſo, with a ſolemne feaſt ſhall Eſther bee eſpouſed; Here wanted no triumph, to expreſſe the ioy of this great Bridegroom; and that the world might witneſſe he could be no leſſe louing, then ſeuere, all his Prouinces ſhal feele the pleaſure of this happy match, in their immunities, in their rich gifts.
                     With what enuious eyes doe we thinke Vaſhti lookt vpon her

glorious riuall? How doth ſhee now (though too late) ſecretly chide her peeuiſh will, that had thus ſtript her of her royal crown, and made way for a more happy ſucceſſor? Little did ſhee thinke her refuſall could haue had ſo hainous a conſtruction: Little did ſhe feare, that one word (perhaps not ill meant) ſhould haue forfaited her husband, her crowne, and all that ſhe was. Who ſo is not wiſe enough to forecaſt the danger of an offence, or indiſcretion, may haue leaſure enough of an vnſeaſonable repentance.
                     That minde is truly great and noble, that is not changed with the hyeſt proſperity; Queen Eſther cannot forget her cozen Mordecai; No pompe can make her ſleight

the charge of ſo deare a kinſman: In all her royalty, ſhe caſts her eie vpon him, amongſt the throng of beholders, but ſhee muſt not know him; her obedience keeps her in awe, and will not ſuffer her to draw him vp with her, to the participation of her honor; It troubles her, not a little, to forbeare this duty; but ſhee muſt; It is enough for her, that Mordecai hath commanded her not to be acknowne, who, or whoſe ſhe was.
                     Perhaps the wiſe Iew feared, that whiles her honour was yet greene, and vnſetled, the notice of her nation, and the name of a deſpiſed captiue might bee ſome blemiſh to her in that proud Court; when as afterwards, vpon

the merit of her cariage, and the full poſſeſſion of all harts, her name might dignifie her nation, and countermand all reproches
                     
                        Mordecai was an officer in the Court of Ahaſuerus; his ſeruice called him daily to attend in the Kings gate; Much better might he, being a Iew, ſerue a Pagan Maſter, then his foſter-daughter might aſcend to a Pagans bed.
                     If the neceſſity or conuenience of his occaſions called him to ſerue; his pietie and religion called him to faithfulneſſe in his ſeruice: Two of the Kings Chamberlaines, Bigthana, and Tereſh, conſpire againſt the life of their Soueraine. No greatneſſe can ſecure from trecherie, or violence: Hee that ruled ouer millions of

men, through an hundred, and ſeuen and twenty Prouinces, cannot aſſure himſelfe from the hand of a villaine; He that had the power of other mens liues, is in danger of his owne. Happy is that man, that is once poſſeſſed of a crown incorruptible, vnfadable, reſerued for him in heauen: no force, no treaſon can reach thither, there can be no perill of either violence, or forfaiture.
                     The likelieſt defence of the perſon of any Prince, is the fidelity of his attendants: Mordecai ouer-hears the whiſpering of theſe wicked conſpirators; and reueales it to Eſther; ſhe (as glad of ſuch an opportunity to commend vnto Ahaſuerus the loyalty of him whom ſhe durſt but ſecretly honour)

reueales it to the King; The circumſtances are examined, the plot is diſcouered, the traytors executed, the ſeruice recorded, in the Perſian Annalls. A good foundation is thus laid for Mordecaies aduancement, which yet is not ouer-haſtened, on either part; Worthy diſpoſitions labour onely to deſerue well, leauing the care of their remuneration, to them, whom it concernes; It is fit that Gods leaſure ſhould be attended in all his deſignements; The houre is ſet, when Mordecai ſhall bee raiſed: If in the meane time there be an interuention, not only of neglect, but of feares, and dangers, all theſe ſhall make his honour ſo much more ſweet, more precious.
                  
                  
                     
                     HAMAN diſreſpected by MORDECAI. MORDECAIS meſſage to ESTHER.
                     
                        BEſides the charge of his Eſter 3. 4. office, the care of Eſthers proſperity calls Mordecai to the Kings gate; and fixes him there: With what inward contentment did he thinke of his ſo royall pupill? Here I ſit among my fellowes; little doth the world thinke, that mine adopted child ſits in the Throne of Perſia: that the great

Empreſſe of the world owes her ſelfe to me; I might haue more honor, I could not haue ſo much ſecret comfort, if al Shuſhan knew what intereſt I haue in Queene Eſther.
                     
                     Whiles his hart is taken vp with theſe thoughts, who ſhould come ruffling by him, but the new-raiſed fauorite of King Ahaſuerus, Haman the ſonne of Ammedatha the Agagite? Him hath the great King inexpectedly aduanced, and ſet his ſeat aboue all the Princes that were with him: The gracious reſpects of Princes are not alwayes led by merit, but by their owne will; which is euer affected to bee ſo much the freer, as themſelues would bee held more great.
                     
                        
When the Sunne ſhines vpon the Diall, euery paſſenger will be looking at it; There needed no command of reuerence, where Ahaſuerus was pleaſed to countenance; All knees will bow alone euen to forbidden Idols of honor; how much more where royall authority inioynes obeyſance? All the ſeruants, all the ſubiects of King Ahaſuerus are willingly proſtrate before this great mignon of their Souerayn; onely Mordecai ſtands ſtiffe, as if he ſaw nothing more then a man in that proud Agagite.
                     
                     They are not obſerued that do as the moſt; but if any one man ſhall vary from the multitude, all eyes are turned vpon him: Mordecaies fellow-officers note this

palpable irreuerence, and expoſtulate it; Why tranſgreſſeſt thou the Kings commandements?
                     
                     Conſidereſt thou not how far this affront reacheth? It is not the perſon of Haman, whom thou refuſeſt to adore, but the King in him: Neither doe we regard ſo much the man, as the command; Let him be neuer ſo vile whom the King bids to bee honoured, with what ſafety can a ſubiect examine the charge, or reſiſt it? his vnworthineſſe cannot diſpence with our loyalty.
                     What a dangerous wilfulneſſe ſhould it be to incurre the forfaiture of thy place, of thy life for a curteſie? If thou wilt not bow with others, expect to ſuffer alone; Perhaps (they thought)

this omiſſion was vnheedy; In a caſe of ignorance, or incogitancie, it was a friendly office to admoniſh; the ſight of the errour had beene the remedy.
                     
                        Mordecai heares their challenge, their aduice; and thinks good to anſwer both, with ſilence; as willing they ſhould imagine, his inflexibleneſſe proceeded from a reſolution; and that reſolution from ſome ſecret grounds, which he needed not impart: at laſt yet he imparts thus much: Let it ſuffice, that I am a Iew, and Haman an Amalekite.
                     
                     After a priuate expoſtulation, the continuance of that open neglect is conſtrued for a ſullen obſtinacie; and now, the monitors themſelues grow ſenſible of

the contempt: Men are commonly impatient to loſe the thanke of their indeuours, and are prone to hate whom they cannot reforme. Partly therfore to picke a thanke, and partly to reuenge this contumacy, theſe officers turne informers againſt Mordecai, neither meant to make the matter fairer then it was; they tell Haman how proud, and ſtubborne a Iew ſate amongſt them, how ill they could brooke ſo ſaucie an affront to be offered to his greatneſſe; how ſeriouſly they had expoſtulated, how ſtomackfully the offender perſiſted; and beſeech him, that he would bee pleaſed in his next paſſage, to caſt ſome glances that way, and but obſerue the faſhion of that intolerable

inſolency.
                     The proud Agagite cannot long indure the very expectation of ſuch an indignity; On purpoſe doth he ſtalk thither, with higher then his ordinary ſteps; ſnuffing vp the aire, as he goes, and would ſee the man, that durſt deny reuerence to the greateſt Prince of Perſia.
                     
                     
                        Mordecai holds his old poſture; onely hee is ſo much more careleſſe, as he ſees Haman more diſdainfull, and imperious; neither of them goes about to hide his paſſion; one lookt, as if hee ſaid, I hate the pride of Haman; the other lookt, as if he ſaid, I will plague the contempt of Mordecai: how did the eies of Hamā
                         ſparkle with fury, and as it were dart

our deadly beames in the face of that deſpightfull Iew? How did he ſwell with indignation; and then againe waxe pale with anger? ſhortly, his very brow and his motion bad Mordecai looke for the vtmoſt of reuenge.
                     
                        Mordecai foreſees his danger, and contemnes it; no frownes, no threats can ſouple thoſe ioints: he may breake, he will not bow.
                     What ſhall we ſay then to this obfirmed reſolution of Mordecai? What is it, what can it be, that ſo ſtiffens the knees of Mordecai, that death is more eaſie to him, then their incuruation? Certainly, if meere ciuility were in queſtion, this wilfull irreuerence to ſo great a Peere, could not paſſe without the iuſt cenſure of a rude peruerſneſſe;

It is religion that forbids this obeisāce, &amp; tels him, that ſuch curteſie could not bee free from ſinne; Whether it were, that more then humane honor was required to this new-erected image of the great King, as the Perſiās were euer wont to bee noted for too much lauiſhneſſe in theſe courtly deuotions: Or whether it were, that the ancient curſe wherewith God had branded the blood, and ſtocke of Haman, made it vnlawfull for an Iſraelite to giue him any obſeruance: For the Amalekites (of whoſe royall line Haman was deſcended) were the nation, with which God had ſworne perpetuall hoſtility; and whoſe memory hee had ſtraitly charged Ex. 17. 16. Deu. 25. 19. his people to root out, from vnder

heauen; How may I (thinks he) adore, where God commāds me to deteſt? How may I profeſſe reſpect, where God profeſſeth enmity? How may I contribute to the eſtabliſhment of that ſeed vpon earth, which God hath charged to be pull'd vp from vnder heauen? Outward actions of indifferency, when once they are felt to trench vpon the conſcience, lay deepe obligations vpon the ſoule; euen whiles they are moſt ſleighted by careleſſe hearts.
                     In what a flame of wrath doth Haman liue this while? wherewith he could not but haue conſumed his owne heart, had hee not giuen vent to that rage in his aſſured purpoſes of reuenge:

Great mens anger is like to themſelues, ſtrong, fierce, ambitious of an exceſſiue ſatisfaction. Haman ſcornes to take vp with the blood of Mordecai; This were but a vulgar amends; Poore men can kill where they hate, and expiate their owne wrong, with the life of a ſingle enemie: Hamans fury ſhall fly an higher pitch; Millions of threats are few enow to bleed for this offence: It is a Iew that hath deſpighted him; all the whole nation of the Iewes ſhall periſh for the ſtomach of this one: The Monarchy of the world was now in the hand of the Perſian, as Iudaea was within this compaſſe, ſo there was ſcarce a Iew vpon earth, without the verge of the Perſian dominions:

The generation, the name ſhall now dye at once; Neither ſhall there bee any memory of them; but this; There was a people, which hauing beene famous through the world, for three thouſand, foure hundred, and foureſcore yeares, were in a moment, extinct by the power of Haman for default of a courteſie.
                     Perhaps, that hereditary grudge, and old antipathy, that was betwixt Iſrael, and Amalek, ſtucke ſtill in the heart of this Agagite; he might know that God had commanded Iſrael to root out Amalek from vnder heauen; and now therefore an Amalekite will bee ready to take this aduātage againſt Iſrael. It is extreame iniuſtice to dilate the puniſhment, beyond

the offence; and to enwrap thouſands of innocents within the treſpaſſe of one: How many that were yet vnborne when Haman was vnſaluted, muſt rue the fact they liued not to know? How many millions of Iewes were then liuing, that knew not there was a Mordecai? all of them are fetcht into one condicion, and muſt ſuffer, ere they can know their offence. Oh the infinite diſtance betwixt the vniuſt cruelty of men, and the iuſt mercies of the Almighty; Euen Caiphas himſelfe could ſay, It is better that one man dye, then that all the people ſhould periſh; and here Haman can ſay, It is better that all the people ſhould periſh then that one man ſhould dye. Thy mercy, ô God, by the willing

death of one that had not ſinned, hath defrayed the iuſt death of a world of ſinners: Whiles the iniurious rigour of a man, for the ſuppoſed fault of one, would deſtroy a whole nation, that had not offended: It is true, that by the ſinne of one, death raigned ouer all; but it was, becauſe all ſinned in that one: had not all men beene in Adam, all had not falne in him, all had not dyed in him; It was not the man, but mankind that fell into ſinne, and by ſinne, into death: No man can complaine of puniſhment, whiles no man can exempt himſelfe from the tranſgreſſion: Vnmercifull Haman would haue imbrued his hands in that blood, which hee could not but confeſſe innocent.
                     
                        
It is a rare thing, if the height of fauour cauſe not preſumption; Such is Hamans: greatneſſe, that he takes his deſigne for granted, ere it can receiue a motion; The fitteſt dayes for this great maſſacre, are determined by the lots of their common diuination; according whereunto, Haman chooſeth the houre of this bloody ſuit; and now, waited on by opportunity, he addreſſeth himſelfe to King Ahaſuerus. There is a certaine people ſcattered abroad, and diſperſed among the people, in all the Prouinces of the Kingdome, and their lawes are diuers from all people; neither keepe they the Kings lawes, therefore it is not for the Kings profit to ſuffer them; If it pleaſe the King, let it bee written that they may be deſtroyed, and I will pay tenne
                        
                        thouſand talents of ſiluer to the hands of the officers. With what cunning hath this man couched his malice? He doth not ſay, There is a Iew that hath affronted mee, let me be auenged of his nation; this rancour was too monſtrous to be confeſſed; perhaps this ſuggeſtion might haue bred in the mind of Ahaſuerus a conceit of Hamans ill nature, and intolerable immanity; but his precences are plauſible, and ſuch as driue at no other, then the publique good; Euery word hath his inſinuation: It is a ſcattered people; were the nation intire, their maintenance could not but ſtand with the Kings honour; but now ſince they are but ſtraglers, as their loſſe would be inſenſible, ſo their continuance,

and mixture cannot but be preiudiciall; It was not the fault, it was the miſery of theſe poore Iewes, that they were diſperſed; and now their diſperſion is made an argument of their extirpation; therefore muſt they be deſtroyed, from the earth, becauſe they were ſcattered ouer the earth. As good, ſo euils draw on each other; That which ſhould plead for pitty in the well-affected, is a motiue to cruelty in ſauage minds. Seldome euer hath extremity of miſchiefe ſeized, where eaſier afflictions haue not beene billeted before.
                     All faith full Iewes had wont to ſay vnto God, Haue mercy vpon vs, O God, and ſaue vs, for our ſoule is full of contempt, and we are ſcattered
                        
                        amongst the heathen; and here this enemy can ſay of them, to Ahaſuerus, Deſtroy them for they are ſcattered; Root them out, for they are contemned; How much better is it to fall into the hands of God, thē of men; ſince that which whets the ſword of men, works commiſeration in the Almighty: Beſides the diſſipation of the perſons, Their lawes are diuers from all people: All other people liue by thy lawes, they onely by their owne: and how can this ſingularity of their faſhions, but breed diſorder, and inconuenience? Did they liue in ſome corner of the earth apart, their difference in religion and gouernment could not import much; now, that they are diſperſed amongſt all thy

ſubiects, vvhat doe theſe vncouth formes of theirs, but teach all the vvorld to bee irregular? vvhy ſhould they liue vnder thy protection, that will not be gouerned by thy lawes?
                     Wicked Haman! what were the lawes of Iſrael, but the lawes of God? if this be a quarrell, what ſhall the death of the Iewes bee other, then martyrdome?
                     The diuerſity of iudgement, and practice from the reſt of the world hath beene an old, and enuious imputation caſt vpō Gods Church: What if we be ſingled from others, whiles wee walke with God? In matters lawfull, arbitrary, indifferent, wiſedome teacheth vs to conforme our ſelues to all others; but, where

God hath laid a ſpeciall impoſition vpon vs, we muſt either vary, or ſinne: The greateſt glory of Iſrael was their lawes, wherein they as far exceeded all other nations, as heauen is aboue earth; yet, here their lawes are quarrelled, and are made the inducements of their deſtruction; It is not poſſible the Church of God ſhould eſcape perſecution, whiles that which it hath good is maligned; whiles that offēds which makes it happy.
                     Yet, that they haue lawes of their owne, were not ſo vnſufferable, if withall, they did obſerue thine, ô King, but theſe Iewes, as they are vnconformable; ſo they are ſeditious: They keepe not the King lawes: Thou ſlandereſt Haman;
                        
they could not keepe their owne lawes, if they kept not the Kings; for their lawes call them to obedience vnto their ſoueraignes; and adiudge hell to the rebellious: In all thoſe hundred and ſeuen and twenty prouinces, King Ahaſuerus hath no ſubiects, but them; They obey out of conſcience, others out of feare: why are they charged with that, which they doe moſt abhorre? What can be the ground of this crimination? Ahaſuerus commanded all knees to bow to Haman; A Iew onely refuſes; Malicious Haman; He that refuſed to bow vnto thee, had ſufficiently approued his loyalty to Ahaſuerus; Ahaſuerus had not been, if Mordecai had not beene a good ſubiect; Hath the

King no lawes, but what concerne thine adoration? Set aſide religion (wherein the Iew is ready to preſent if not actiue, yet paſſiue obedience) and name that Perſian law, which a Iew dares break.
                     As I neuer yet read, or heard of a conſcionable Iſraelite, that hath not paſſed vnder this calumniation, ſo I cannot yeeld him a true Iſraelite, that deſerues it.
                     In vaine doth hee profeſſe to acknowledge a God, in heauen, that denies homage to his deputy on earth.
                     
                        It is not for the Kings profit to ſuffer thē. Worldly hearts are not led by good, or euill, but by profit, or loſſe; neither haue they grace to know that nothing is profitable but what is honeſt, nothing

ſo deſperately incommodious, as wickedneſſe; They muſt needs offend by rule that meaſure all things by profit, &amp; meaſure profit by their imagination. How eaſie is it to ſuggeſt ſtrange vntruths, when there is no body to giue an anſwer? Falſe Hamā, hovv is it not for the Kings profit to ſuffer the Iewes? If thou conſtrue this profit, for honor, The Kings honor is in the multitude of ſubiects, and what people more numerous then they? If for gaine, The Kings profit is in the largeneſſe of his Tributes; and what people are more deepe in their payments? If for ſeruices? what people are more officious? How can it ſtand with the Kings profit to bereaue himſelfe

of ſubiects, his ſubiects of their liues, his Exchequer of their tributes, his ſtate of their defence? Hee is a weake polititian that knowes not to guild ouer the worſt proiect, with a pretence of publike vtility. No name vnder heauen hath made ſo many fooles, ſo many villaines, as this of profit.
                     Laſtly, as Ahaſuerus reapes nothing but diſprofit by the liues of the Iewes, ſo hee ſhall reape no ſmall profit by their deaths: I will pay tenne thouſand talents of ſiluer to the Kings treaſuries for this execution. If reuenge were not very ſweet to the malicious man, hee could not be content to purchaſe it at ſo high a rate; How doe we ſee daily that the thirſt hereof caries

men to a riotous prodigality of eſtate, body, ſoule?
                     Cruell Haman, if thou couldſt haue ſwim'd in a whole Sea of Iewiſh blood, if thou couldſt haue raiſed mountaines of their carcaſſes; if thou couldſt haue made all Perſia thy ſhambles; who would haue giuen thee one farthing for all thoſe piles of fleſh, for all thoſe ſtreames of blood? yea who would not rather haue beene at charge for the auoyding of the annoyances of thoſe ſlaughtered bodies, which thou offereſt to buy at ten thouſand talents? It were an happy thing, if charitie could inlarge it ſelfe, but ſo much as malice; if the preſeruation of mankinde could be ſo much beholden to our bountie, as the deſtruction.
                     
                        
Now when all theſe are laid together, the baſeneſſe and diſperſedneſſe of the people, the diuerſitie of their lawes, the irregularitie of their gouernment, the rebellion of their practice, the inconuenience of their toleration, the gaine of their extirpation; what could the wit or art of man deuiſe more inſinuatiue, more likely to perſwade? How could it bee but Ahaſuerus muſt needs thinke (ſince he could not ſuſpect the ground of this ſuit;) What a zealous patriot haue I raiſed that can be content to buy off the incōmodity of the ſtate, at his own charge? How worthy is hee rather of the aide both of my power, and purſe? why ſhould I be fee'd to eaſe my Kingdomes of

rebels: The ſiluer is giuen to thee, the people alſo, to doe with them as ſeemeth good to thee: Without all delay, the ſecretaries are call'd to write the warrants, the Kings ring is giuen to ſeale them, the poſts are ſent out to cary them into all Prouinces; The day is ſet wherein all Iewes, of all ages, of both ſexes, through the hundred and ſeuen and twenty prouinces of the King, ſhall be ſacrificed to the wrath of Haman.
                     
                     In all the cariage of Ahaſuerus, who ſees not too much heddineſſe of paſſion? Vaſhti is caſt off for a trifle; the Iewes are giuen to the ſlaughter for nothing, his rage in the one, his fauour in the other is too impotent: Hee is not a worſe husband then a King; the

bare word of Haman is enough to kill ſo many ſubiects: No diſpoſition can bee more dangerous in great perſons, then violence of affectiō mixed with credulity. Oh the ſeeming inequality of humane condicions: The King and Haman ſate down to drink, but the City of Shuſhan was perplexed: It is a wofull thing to ſee great ones quaffe the teares of the oppreſſed; &amp; to heare them make muſick of ſhriekes.
                     With what lamentation doe we thinke all the Synagogues of Iewes through the world receiued this fatall meſſage of their proclaimed deſtruction? How doe they bemone themſelues, each to other? How doe their conioyned cries fill heauen, and earth? But aboue all, what ſack-cloth and

aſhes could ſuffiſe wofull Mordecai, that found in himſelfe the occaſion of all this ſlaughter? What ſoule could bee capable of more bitterneſſe, then he felt? Whiles he could not but think, Wretched man that I am; It is I, that haue brought all this calamity vpon my nation; It is I, that haue beene the ruine of my people: wo is me that euer I put my ſelfe into the Court, into the ſeruice of a Pagan; how vnhappy was I to caſt my ſelfe into theſe ſtraits, that I muſt either honour an Agagite, or draw a vengeance vpon Iſrael? Yet how could I imagine, that the flame of Hamans rage would haue broken out ſo farre? might that reuenge haue determined in my blood, how happy ſhould I haue been? now, I haue

brought death vpon many thouſands of innocents, that cannot know wherefore they dye; Why did I not hide my ſelfe rather frō the face of that proud Amalekite? Why did I ſtand out in conteſtation with ſo ouer-powerfull an enemy? Alas, no man of Iſrael ſhall ſo much as liue to curſe me, onely mine enemies ſhall record my name, with ignominy, and ſay, Mordecai was the bane of his nation. Oh, that my zeale ſhould haue reſerued mee for ſo heauie a ſeruice! Where now are thoſe vaine ambitions, wherewith I pleaſed my ſelfe in this great match of Eſther? How fondly did I hope by this vndue meanes to raiſe my ſelfe, and my people? Yea, is not this carnall preſumption

the quarrell that God hath againſt me? Doe I not therefore ſmart from theſe Pagans, for that I ſecretly affected this vncircumciſed alliance? Howſoeuer it bee, yet, ô God, what haue thy people done? Oh let it be thy iuſt mercy that I may periſh alone!
                     In theſe ſad thoughts did Mordecai ſpend his hart, vvhiles hee vvalked mournfully in ſackcloth, before that gate, wherein he vvas wont to ſit; now his habit bars his approach; no ſackcloth might come vvithin the Court: Lo, that vvhich is vvelcomeſt in the court of heauen, is here excluded from the preſence of this earthly royaltie: A broken and a contrite hart, O God, thou wilt not deſpiſe.
                     
                     Neither did it a little adde to

the ſorrow of Mordecai, to heare the bitter inſultations of his former monitors: Did wee not aduiſe thee better? Did we not foreadmoniſh thee of thy danger? ſee now the iſſue of thine obſtinacy: now ſee, what it is for thine earthen pitcher to knock vvith braſſe? now, vvhere is the man that vvould needs conteſt vvith Haman? haſt thou not now brought thy matters to a fair paſs? Thy ſtomacke had long owed thee a ſpight, and now it hath paid thee; vvho can pitty thy wilfulneſſe? ſince thou vvouldeſt needs deride our counſell, vvee vvill take leaue to laugh at thy ſackcloth. Nothing but ſcornes, and griefes, and terrors preſent themſelues to miſerable Mordecai: All the externall buffets of aduerſaries

were ſleight to the vvounds that he both made, and felt in his owne heart.
                     The perpetuall intelligences that were cloſely held betwixt Eſther, and Mordecai, could not ſuffer his publique ſorrow to bee long concealed from her; The newes of his ſackcloth afflicts her ere ſhe can ſuſpect the cauſe; her crowne doth but clog her head, vvhiles ſhee heares of his aſhes; True friendſhip transformes vs into the condicion of thoſe vvee loue; and if it cannot raiſe them to our cheerfulneſſe, drawes vs downe to their deiection: Faine vvould ſhee vncaſe her foſter-father of theſe mournfull vveeds; and change his ſackcloth for tiſſue; that yet, at leaſt, his cloathes

might not hinder his acceſſe to her preſence, for the free opening of his griefes.
                     It is but a ſleight ſorrow that abides to take in outward comforts; Mordecai refuſes that kinde offer; and vvould haue Eſther ſee that his afflictiō was ſuch, as that hee might well reſolue to put off his ſackcloth and his skin at once; that he muſt mourne to death rather then ſee her face to liue.
                     The good Queene is aſtoniſht with this conſtāt humiliatiō of ſo deare a friend; and now ſhe ſends Hatach, a truſty (though a Pagan) attendant, to inquire into the occaſion of this ſo irremediable heauineſſe: It ſhould ſeeme Eſther inquired not greatly into matters of ſtate; that which perplexed all

                        Shuſhan, was not yet knowne to her; her followers, not knowing her to be a Ieweſſe, conceiued not how the newes might concerne her, and therefore had forborne the relation: Mordecai firſt informes her, by her meſſenger, of the decree that was gone out againſt all her nation, of the day wherein they muſt all prepare to bleed, of the ſumme which Haman had profered for their heads, &amp; deliuers the copy of that bloody Edict; charging her, now, if euer, to beſtirre her ſelfe; and to improue all her loue, all her power with King Ahaſuerus, in a ſpeedy and humble ſupplication for the ſauing of the life (not of himſelfe ſo much, as) of her people.
                     
                        
It was tydings able to confound a weake heart; and hers, ſo much the more, as ſhee could apprehēd nothing but impoſſibility of redreſſe: ſhe needs but to put Mordecai in mind of that, which all the Kings ſeruants and ſubiects knew well enough, that the Perſian law made it no leſſe then death for whom ſoeuer, man, or woman, that ſhould preſſe into the inner court of the king, vncalled. Nothing but the royall ſcepter extended, could keepe that preſumptuous offender from the graue. For her, thirty dayes were now paſſed ſince ſhee was called in to the King; an intermiſſion, that might bee iuſtly ſuſpicious; Whether the heate of his firſt affection were thus ſoone (:of it

ſelfe) allayed towards her; or whether ſome ſuggeſtions of a ſecret enemie (perhaps his Agagite) may haue ſet him off; or whether ſome more pleaſing obiect may haue laid hold on his eyes; what euer it might be, this absēce could not but argue ſome ſtrangeneſſe, and this ſtrangeneſſe muſt needs imply a danger in her bold intruſion: Shee could bewaile therfore, ſhe could not hope to remedy this diſmallday of her people. This anſwer in the eares of Mordecai ſounded truth, but weakneſſe; neither can he take vp with ſo feeble a returne; Theſe occaſions require other ſpirits, other reſplutions, which muſt bee quickened by a more ſtirring reply:) Thinke not with thy ſelfe that
                        
                        thou ſhalt eſcape in the Kings houſe, more then all the Iewes. For if thou altogether holdeſt thy peace at this time, then ſhall their inlargement, &amp; deliuerance ariſe to the Iewes from another place, but thou and thy fathers houſe ſhall bee deſtroyed. And who knoweth whether thou art comne to the Kingdome for ſuch a time as this.
                     
                     The expectation of death had not quailed the ſtrong heart of faithfull Mordecai; euen, whiles hee mournes, his zeale droupes not; there could haue beene no life in that breſt, which this meſſage could not haue rouzed.
                     What then? is it death that thou feareſt in this attempt of thy ſupplication; what other thē death awaits thee in the neglect of it? there is but this difference, ſue, &amp;

thou maiſt die, ſue not, and thou muſt dye: what blood haſt thou but Iewiſh? and if theſe vnalterable edicts exempt no liuing ſoule, what ſhall become of thine? and canſt thou be ſo vainly timerous, as to die for feare of death? to preferre certaintie of danger, before a poſſibility of hopes? Away with this weake cowardiſe vnworthy of an Iſraelite, vnworthy of a Queene: But if faint heartedneſſe or priuate reſpects ſhall ſeale vp thy lippes, or with-hold thine hand from the ayde of thy people; if thou canſt ſo farre neglect Gods Church, know thou that God will not neglect it; it ſhall not be in the power of Tyrans to root out his choſen ſeed; that holy one of Iſrael ſhall rather

worke miracles from heauen, thē his inheritance ſhall periſh vpon earth? and how iuſt ſhall it then be for that iealous God, to take vengeance vpon thee, and thy fathers houſe for this cold vnhelpfulneſſe to his diſtreſſed Church? Suffer me therefore to adiure thee by all that tenderneſſe of loue, wherewith I haue trained vp thine orphane infancie; by all thoſe deare and thankfull reſpects which thou haſt vowed to mee againe; by the name of the God of Iſrael whom wee ſerue, that thou awaken and ſtirre vp thine holy courage, and dare to aduenture thy life, for the ſauing of many; It hath pleaſed the Almighty to raiſe thee vp to that height of honor, which our progenitors

could little expect; why ſhouldſt thou bee wanting to him, that hath beene ſo bountifull to thee? yea why ſhould I not thinke that God hath put this very act into the intendement of thine exaltation? hauing on purpoſe thus ſeaſonably hoyſed thee vp to the throne, that thou maiſt reſcue his poore Church from an vtter ruine?
                     Oh the admirable faith of Mordecai, that ſhines through all theſe cloudes, and in the thickeſt of theſe fogges, deſcries a cheerfull glimpſe of deliuerance; Hee ſaw the day of their common deſtruction enacted, he knew the Perſian decrees to be vnalterable; but, withall, hee knew there was a Meſſias to come; he was ſo well

acquainted with Gods couenanted aſſurances to his Church, that he can through the midſt of thoſe bloody reſolutions foreſee indemnity to Iſrael; rather truſting the promiſes of God, then the threats of men. This is the victory that ouercomes all the feares, and fury of the world, euen our faith.
                     It is quarrell enough againſt any perſon, or community not to haue been aidfull to the diſtreſſes of Gods people. Not to ward the blow, if wee may, is conſtrued for little better then ſtriking. Till we haue tryed our vtmoſt, wee know not whether wee haue done that we came for.
                     
                        Mordecai hath ſaid enough; Theſe words haue ſo put a new

life into Eſther, that ſhe is reſolute to hazard the old; Goe gather together all the Iewes that are preſent in Shuſhan, and faſt ye for me, and neither eate nor drinke, three daies night or day; I alſo and my maidens will faſt likewiſe, and ſo will I goe in vnto the King, (which is not according to the law) and if I periſh, I periſh. Heroicall thoughts doe well befit great actions. Life can neuer be better aduentured, then where it ſhall begaine to leeſe it.
                     There can bee no law againſt the humble deprecation of euils; where the neceſſity of Gods Church calls to vs, no danger, ſhould with-hold vs from all honeſt meanes of releife. Deepe humiliations muſt make way for the ſucceſſe of great enterpriſes,

wee are moſt capable of mercy, vvhen we are throughly empty: A ſhort hunger doth but whet the appetite, but ſo long an abſtinence meets death halfe way, to preuent it; Well may they inioyne ſharp penances vnto others, who practiſe it vpon themſelues.
                     It was the face of Eſther that muſt hope to win Ahaſuerus, yet that ſhall be macerated with faſting, that ſhe may preuaile. A carnall heart would haue pampered the fleſh, that it might allure thoſe wanton eyes; ſhee pines it, that ſhe may pleaſe.
                     God, and not ſhe, muſt work the hart of the King; Faith teaches her rather to truſt her deuotions, then her beauty.
                  
                  
                     
                     ESTHER ſuing to AHASVERVS.
                     
                        THE Iewes are eaſily Eſther. 5. intreated to faſt, who had receiued in themſelues the ſentence of death; what pleaſure could they take in meat, that knew what day they muſt eate their laſt? The three dayes of abſtinence are expired; now Eſther changes her ſpirits, no leſſe then her clothes; Who that ſees that face, and that habit, can ſay ſhe had mourned, ſhe had faſted? Neuer did her royall apparell

become her ſo well. That God before whom ſhe had humbled her ſelfe, made her ſo much more beautifull, as ſhe had beene more deiected; And now, with a winning confidence, ſhe walks into the inner court of the King, and puts her ſelfe into that forbidden preſence: as if ſhe ſaid; Here I am with my life in my hand, if it pleaſe the King to take it, it is ready for him; Vaſhti, my predeceſſor, forfaited her place for not comming when ſhe was called; Eſther ſhall now hazard the forfaiture of her life, for comming when ſhe is not called: It is neceſſity, not diſobedience that hath put me vpon this bold approch; according to thy conſtruction, O King, I doe either liue or

dye, either ſhall be welcome. The inexpectedneſſe of pleaſing obiects makes them many times the more acceptable: the beautifull countenance, the gracefull demeanure, and goodly preſence of Eſther, haue no ſooner taken the eyes, then they haue rauiſhed the hart of King Ahaſuerus: Loue hath ſoone baniſhed all dreadfulneſſe; And the King held out to Eſther the golden ſcepter that was in his hand: Moderate intermiſſion is ſo farre from cooling the affection, that it inflames it: had Eſther been ſeene euery day, perhaps that ſatiety had abated of the height of her welcome; now, three and thirty dayes retiredneſſe hath indeared her more to the ſurfeted eyes of Ahaſuerus.
                     
                     
                        
Had not the golden Scepter been held out, where had Queen Eſther beene? The Perſian Kings affected a ſtern awfulneſſe to their ſubiects; It was death to ſolicit them, vncalled; How ſafe, how eaſie, how happy a thing it is to haue to doe with the King of heauen, who is ſo pleaſed with our acceſſe, that he ſolicits ſutors; who, as he is vnweariable with our requeſts, ſo is infinite in his beneficences!
                     How gladly doth Eſther touch the top of that Scepter, by which ſhee holds her life? and now, whiles ſhe thinks it well that ſhe may liue, ſhe receiues beſides pardon, fauour: What wilt thou Queene Eſther, and what is thy requeſt? it ſhall be giuen thee, euen to the halfe of
                        
                        the Kingdome. Commonly, when wee feare moſt, wee ſpeed beſt; God then moſt of all magnifies his bounty to vs, when we haue moſt afflicted our ſelues. Ouerconfident expectations are ſeldome but diſappointed; whiles humble ſuſpicions goe laughing away: It was the benefit and ſafety of but one peece of the Kingdome that Eſther comes to ſue for, and behold, Ahaſuerus offers her the free power of the halfe: He that gaue Haman, at the firſt word, the liues of all his Iewiſh ſubiects, is ready to giue Eſther halfe his Kingdome, ere ſhe aske: Now ſhee is no leſſe amazed at the louing munificence of Ahaſuerus, then ſhe was before afraid of his auſterity; The Kings hart is in
                        
                        the hand of the Lord, as the riuers of water; hee turneth it whitherſoeuer hee will.
                     
                     It is not good to ſwallow fauours too greedily, leſt they either choke vs in the paſſage, or proue hard of digeſtion. The wiſe Queene, howeuer ſhee might ſeeme to haue a faire opportunity offered to her ſuit, findes it not good to apprehend it too ſuddenly; as deſiring by this ſmall dilation, to prepare the eare and hart of the King for ſo important a requeſt.
                     Now, all her petition ends in a banquet; If it ſeeme good vnto the King, let the King and Haman come this day vnto the banquet, that I haue prepared for him. It is an eaſie fauor to receiue a ſmall courteſie, where

we offer to giue great. Haman is called, the King comes to Eſthers table; and now highly pleaſed with his entertainment, hee himſelfe ſolicits her to propound that ſuit, for which her modeſty would, but durſt not ſolicit him: Baſhfulneſſe ſhall leeſe nothing at the hand of wel-gouerned greatneſſe.
                     Yet ſtill Eſthers ſuit ſtickes in her teeth, and dares not come forth without a further preface of time, and expectation; Another banquet muſt paſſe, ere this reckning can be giuen in. Other ſuitors wait long for the deliuerie of their petition; longer for the receit of their anſwer: Here the King is faine to wait for his ſuit: Whether Eſthers hart would

not yet ſerue her to conteſt with ſo ſtrong an aduerſary, as Haman, without further recollection; or whether ſhe deſired to get better hold of the King, by indearing him with ſo pleaſing entertainments; or whether ſhee would thus ripen her hopes, by working in the mind of king Ahaſuerus a fore-conceit of the greatneſſe, and difficulty of that ſuit, which was ſo loath to come forth; or, whether ſhe meant thus to giue ſcope to the pride, and malice of Haman, for his more certaine ruine: Howſoeuer it were, to morrow is a new day, ſet for Eſthers ſecond banquet, &amp; third petition.
                     The King is not inuited without Haman; Fauors are ſometimes done to men, with a purpoſe of

diſpleaſure; Doubtleſſe Haman taſted of the ſame cates with his maſter; neither could hee in the forehead of Eſther read any other characters, then of reſpect, and kind applauſe, yet had ſhee then, in her hopes, diſigned him to a iuſt reuenge. Little do we know, by outward cariages, in what termes we ſtand with either God or men.
                     Euery little winde raiſeth vp a bubble; How is Haman now exalted in himſelfe with the ſingular grace of Queene Eſther; and begins to value himſelfe ſo much more, as hee ſees himſelfe higher in the rate of others opinion.
                     Only ſurly, and ſullen Mordecai is an allay to his happineſſe; No

edict of death can bow the knees of that ſtout Iew: yea the notice of that bloody cruelty of this Agagite, haue ſtiffned them ſo much the more: Before, he lookt at Haman as an Amalekite, now, as a perſecutor. Diſdaine and anger looke out at thoſe eyes, and bid that proud enemy doe his worſt. No doubt, Mordecai had beene liſtening after the ſpeed of Queen Eſther; how ſhee came in to the King, how ſhe was welcom'd with the golden ſcepter, and with the more precious words of Ahaſuerus; how ſhee had intertained the King, how ſhee pleaſed; the newes had quit his ſackcloth, and raiſed his courage to a more ſcornfull neglect of his profeſſed aduerſary.
                     
                        
                        Haman comes home, I know not whether more full of pride, or of rage; calls an inward counſell of his choiſe friends, together with his wife; makes a glorious report of all his wealth, magnificence, height of fauor, both with the King and Queene; and at laſt, after all his ſun-ſhine, ſets in this cloudy epilogue, Yet all this auaileth me nothing, ſo long as I ſee Mordecai the Iew ſitting at the Kings gate. It is ſeldome ſeene that God allowes euen to the greateſt dearlings of the world, a perfect contentment; ſomething they muſt haue to complaine of, that ſhall giue an vnſauory verdure to their ſweeteſt morſels; and make their very felicity, miſerable.
                     The wit of women hath wont

to be noted for more ſudden and more ſharpe. Zereſh the wife of Haman ſets on foot that motion of ſpeedy reuenge, which is applauded by the reſt. Let a gallowes be made of fifty cubits high, and to morrow, ſpeake thou to the King, that Mordecai may be hanged thereon; then goe thou in merily with the King, vnto the banquet. I doe not heare thē ſay; Be patient a while, thou haſt already ſet Mordecai his laſt day; the month Adar will not be long in comming; the determination of his death hath made him deſperate, let him in the meane time eate his owne heart in enuy at thy greatneſſe; but they rather aduiſe of a quicke diſpatch. Malice is a thing full of impatience, and hates delay of execution, next vnto

mercy. Whiles any grudge lies at the heart, it cannot bee freelie cheerfull. Forced ſmiles are but the hypocriſie of mirth. How happy were it for vs, if we could be ſo zealouſly carefull to remoue the hindrances of our true ſpirituall ioy, thoſe ſtubborne corruptions, that will not ſtoope to the power of grace.
                  
                  
                     
                     MORDECAI honored by HAMAN.
                     
                        THe wit of Zereſh had like to haue Eſther. 6. gone beyond the wit of Eſther; had not the working prouidence of the Almighty contriued theſe euents, beyond all hopes, all conceits, Mordecai had beene diſpatched, ere Eſters ſecōd banket. To morrow was the day pitched for both their deſignes; had not the ſtreame beene inexpectedly turned, in vaine had the Queene blamed her delayes;

                        Mordecaies breakfaſt had preuented Eſthers dinner: for certainly, hee that had giuen to Haman ſo many thouſand liues, would neuer haue made dainty, vpon the ſame ſuit, to anticipate one of thoſe, whom he had condemned to the ſlaughter: But, God meant better things to his Church, and fetches about all his holy purpoſes, after a wonderfull faſhion, in the very inſtant of oportunity: Hee that keepeth Iſrael, and neither ſlumbreth, nor ſleepeth, cauſeth ſleepe to depart that night from him that had decreed to root out Iſrael. Great Ahaſuerus, that commanded an hundred and ſeuen and twenty prouinces, cannot command an houres ſleepe. Pouerty is rather bleſſed with the

freedome of reſt, then vvealth, and power: Cares and ſurfet vvith-hold that from the great, vvhich preſſeth vpon the ſpare diet, and labour of the meaneſt. Nothing is more tedious then an eager purſuit of denied ſleepe: vvhich (like to a ſhadow) flyes away ſo much faſter, as it is more followed: Experience tels vs, that this benefit is beſt ſolicited by neglect; and ſooneſt found when vve haue forgotten to ſeeke it.
                     Whether to deceiue the time, or to beſtow it well; Ahaſuerus ſhall ſpend his reſtleſſe houres in the Chronicles of his time. Nothing is more requiſite for Princes, then to looke backe vpon their owne actions, and euents, and thoſe of their predeceſſors;

The examination of fore-paſt actions makes them wiſe, of euents, thankfull, and cautelous.
                     Amongſt thoſe voluminous regiſters of Acts &amp; Monuments, which ſo many ſcores of prouinces muſt needs yeeld, the booke ſhall open vpon Mordecaies diſcouery of the late treaſon of the two Euruches: the reader is turned thither, by an inſenſible ſway of prouidence: Our moſt arbitrary or caſuall actions are ouer-ruled by an hand in heauen.
                     The King now feeles afreſh the danger of that conſpiracy; and (as great ſpirits abide not to ſmother or bury good offices) in quires into the recompence of ſo loyall a ſeruice, What honour and dignity bath beene done to Mordecai for this?
                        
Surely Mordecai did but his duty; he had hainouſly ſinned, if hee had not reuealed this wicked trechery; yet Ahaſuerus takes thought for his remuneratiō: How much more carefull art thou, ô God of all mercies, to reward the weake obediences of thine (at the beſt) vnprofitable ſeruants?
                     That which was intended to procure reſt, ſets it off; King Ahaſuerus is vnquiet in himſelfe, to think that ſo great a merit ſhould lye, but ſo long, neglected; neither can he find any peace in himſelfe, till hee haue giuen order for a ſpeedy retribution: hearing therefore by his ſeruants, that Haman was below in the Court, hee ſends for him vp, to conſult with him, What ſhould be done to the man
                        
                        whom the King delighteth to honour: O maruellous concurrence of circumſtances, drawne together by the infinite vviſedome, and power of the Almighty: Who but Haman ſhould be the man? And vvhen ſhould Haman bee called to aduiſe of Mordecaies honour, but in the very inſtant, vvhen hee came to ſue for Mordecaies hanging? Had Ahaſuerus but ſlept that night, Mordecai had beene that morning aduanced fifty cubits higher then the earth, ere the king could haue remembred to vvhō he vvas beholden.
                     What ſhall vvee ſay then to reconcile theſe croſſe-paſſions in Ahaſuerus? Before he ſigned that decree of killing all the Iewes, hee could not but know that a Iew
                        
had ſaued his life; and now, after that he hath enacted the ſlaughter of all Iewes, as rebels, he is giuing order to honour a Iew, as his preſeruer. It were ſtrange if great perſons in the multitude of their diſtractions ſhould not let fall ſome incongruities.
                     Yet, vvho can but think that king Ahaſuerus meant vpon ſome ſecond thoughts to make amends to Mordecai? neither can he chooſe but put theſe two together; The Iewes are appointed to death, at the ſuit of Haman; This Mordecai is a Iew; how then can I doe more grace to him, that hath ſaued my life, then to command him to be honored by that man who vvould ſpill his?
                     When Haman heard himſelfe

called vp to the bed-chamber of his maſter, he thinks himſelfe too happy in ſo early an oportunity of preſenting his ſuit; but yet more in the pleaſing queſtion of Ahaſuerus; vvherein he could not but imagine that fauour forced it ſelfe vpon him vvith ſtrange importunity; For how could hee conceiue that any intention of more then ordinary honor could fall beſides himſelfe? Selfe-loue, like to a good ſtomach, drawes to it ſelfe what nouriſhment it likes; and caſts off that which offends it. Haman will bee ſure to bee no niggard in aduiſing thoſe ceremonies of honour, which he thinkes meant to his owne perſon. Could hee haue once dreamed that this grace had been purpoſed

to any vnder heauen, beſides himſelfe, he had not beene ſo lauiſh in counſelling ſo pompous a ſhew of exceſſiue magnificence. Now the Kings owne royall apparell, and his owne Steed is not ſufficient, except the royall Crowne alſo make vp the glory of him, who ſhall thus triumph in the kings fauour. Yet all this were nothing in baſe hands: The actor ſhall be the beſt part of this great pageant. Let this apparell, and this horſe, be deliuered to one of the Kings moſt noble Princes, that they may aray the man withall, whom the King delighteth to honour, and bring him on horſe backe through the ſtreets of the City, and proclaime before him, Thus ſhall it be done to the man whom the King delighteth to honour.
                        
Honour is more in him that giues, then him that receiues it: To be honoured by the vnworthy is little better then diſgrace; No meaner perſon will ſerue to attend this Agagite, in his ſuppoſed greatneſſe, then one of the nobleſt Princes. The ambition is too high flowne that ſeekes glory in the ſeruility of equals.
                     The place addes much to the act; There is ſmall hart in a concealed honour; It is nothing vnleſſe the ſtreets of the city Shuſhan be witneſſes of this pompe, and ring with that gracious acclamation.
                     The vaine harts of proud men can eaſily deuiſe thoſe meanes, whereby they may beſt ſet out themſelues. Oh that wee could

equally affect the meanes of true and immortall glory. The heart of man is neuer ſo cold within him, as when from the height of the expectation of good, it falls into a ſudden ſenſe of euill: So did this Agagites. Then the King ſayd to Haman, make haſt, and take the apparell, and the horſe, as thou haſt ſaid, and doe euen ſo to Mordecai the Iew, that ſitteth at the Kings gate; Let nothing faile of all that thou haſt ſaid. How was Haman thunderſtricken with this killing word? Doe thou ſo to Mordecai? I dare ſay all the honors that Ahaſuerus had heaped vpon Haman, cannot counteruaile this one vexation: Doubtleſſe, at firſt, he diſtruſts his eare, and then muzes whether the King be in earneſt; at laſt, when

he heares the charge ſo ſeriouſly doubled, and findes himſelfe forced to beleeue it, hee beginnes to thinke, What meanes this vnconceiuable alteration? Is there no man in all the Court of Perſia to bee pickt out for extraordinary honor, but Mordecai? Is there no man to bee pickt out for the performance of this honour to him, but Haman? haue I but one proud enemie in all the world, and am I ſingled out to grace him? Did it gall me to the heart, and make all my happineſſe tedious vnto mee, to ſee that this Iew would not bow to me, &amp; muſt I now bow to him? That which he would rather dye, and forfait the life of all his nation, then doe to mee, notwithſtanding the Kings command;

ſhall I bee forced by the Kings command to doe vnto him? Yea, did hee refuſe to giue but a cap, and a knee to my greatneſſe; and muſt I lacquay ſo baſe a fellow through the ſtreets, muſt I be his herald to proclaime his honour through all Shuſhan? Why doe I not let the King know the inſolent affronts that hee hath offered me? Why doe I not ſignifie to my Soueraigne, that my errand now was for another kinde of aduancement to Mordecai? If I obtaine not my deſired reuenge, yet, at leaſt, I ſhall preuaile ſo far, as to exempt my ſelfe from this officious attendance vpon ſo vnequall an enemy. And yet, that motiō cānot be now ſafe; I ſee the Kings heart is (vpon what groūd

ſo euer) bent vpon this action; ſhould I flye off neuer ſo little (after my word ſo directly paſſed) perhaps my coldneſſe, or oppoſition might be conſtrued as ſome wayward conteſtation with my maſter: Eſpecially, ſince the ſeruice that Mordecai hath done to the King, is of an higher nature, then the deſpight which he hath done to mee. I will, I muſt giue way for the time; mine humble yeeldance, (when all the cariage of this buſineſſe ſhall bee vnderderſtood) ſhal (I doubt not) make way for mine intended reuenge: Mordecai, I will honor thee now, that by theſe ſteps, I may ere long raiſe thee many cubits higher. I will obey the command of my ſoueraigne in obſeruing thee, that

he may reward the merit of my loyalty, in thine execution.
                     Thus reſolued, Haman goes forth, with a face and heart full of diſtraction, full of confuſion; and addreſſes himſelfe to the attyring, to the attending of his old aduerſary, and new maſter, Mordecai; What lookes doe we now think were caſt vpō each other, at their firſt greeting? their eyes had not forgotten their old language; Certainly, when Mordecai ſaw Haman come into the roome where he was, he could not but thinke; This man hath long thirſted for my blood, and now hee comes to fetch it; I ſhall not liue to ſee the ſucceſſe of Eſther, or the fatall day of my nation: It was knowne that morning in the

Court, what a lofty gibbet Haman had prouided for Mordecai; and why might it not haue comne to Mordecaies eare? What could he therefore now imagine other, then that he was called out to that execution? But, when he ſaw the royall robe that Haman brought to him; he thinks, Is it not enough for this man to kill mee, but he muſt mock me too, What an addition is this to the former cruelty? thus to inſult, and play vpon my laſt diſtreſſe? But, when he yet ſaw the royall crowne ready to be ſet on his head, and the Kings owne horſe richly furniſhed, at his gate, and found himſelfe raiſed by Princely hands, into that royall ſeat, he thinks; what may all this meane? Is it the purpoſe

of mine aduerſary that I ſhal dye in ſtate? Would he haue me hangd in triumph? At laſt, when hee ſees ſuch a traine of Perſian Peeres attending him, with a graue reuerence; and heares Haman proclaime before him, Thus ſhall it bee done to the man whom the King delighteth to honour; finding this pompe to be ſerious, &amp; well meant, hee imagines (in all likelihood) that this inexpected chāge proceeds from the ſuit of his Eſther; now, he begins to lift vp his head, and to hope well of himſelfe, and his people, and could not but ſay within himſelfe, that he had not faſted for nothing. O the wondrous alteration that one morning hath made in the court of Perſia; he that was yeſternight

deſpiſed by Hamans footmen, is now waited on by Haman, and all his fellow-Princes; Hee that yeſter-night had the homage of all knees but one, and was ready to burſt for the lacke of that, now doth obeyſance to that one, by whom hee was wilfully neglected; It was not Ahaſuerus that wrought this ſtrange mutation, it was the ouer-ruling power of the Almighty, whoſe immediate hād would thus preuent Eſthers ſuit, that he might challenge all the thanke to himſelfe. Whiles Princes haue their owne wills, they muſt doe his; and ſhall either exalt, or depreſſe according to diuine appointment.
                     I ſhould commend Hamans obedience in his humble condiſcent

to ſo vnpleaſing, and harſh a command of his maſter, were it not, that either he durſt doe no other, or that hee thus ſtoopt for an aduantage. It is a thankleſſe reſpect that is either forced, or for ends: True ſubiection is free and abſolute; out of the conſcience of duty, not out of feares, or hopes.
                     All Shuſhan is in an amaze at this ſudden glory of Mordecai, and ſtudies how to reconcile this day with the thirteenth of Adar; Mordecai had reaſon to hope well; It could not ſtand with the honour of the King, to kill him whom he ſaw cauſe to aduance; neither could this be any other, then the beginning of a durable promotion; otherwiſe, what recompence

had at houres riding beene to ſo great a ſeruice?
                     On the other ſide, Haman droupes, and hath changed paſſions with Mordecai; Neither was that Iew euer more deeply afflicted with the decree of his owne death, then this Agagite was with that Iewes honour. How heauy doth it lye at Hamans heart, that no tongue, but his, might ſerue to proclaime Mordecai happy: Euen the greateſt mignons of the world muſt haue their turnes of ſorrow.
                     With a couered head, and a deiected countenance, doth hee haſten home, and longs to impart his griefe, where he had receiued his aduice: It was but cold comfort that hee finds from his wife

                        Zereſh, and his friends. If Mordecai be of the ſeed of the Iewes, before whom thou haſt begunne to fall, thou ſhalt not preuaile againſt him, but ſhalt ſurely fall before him: Out of the mouth of Pagans, O God, haſt thou ordained ſtrength, that thou maiſt ſtill the enemy, and the auenger. What credit hath thy great name won with theſe barbarous nations, that they can out of all experience make maximes of thine vndoubted protection of thy people, and the certaine ruine of their aduerſaries? Men finde no difference in themſelues; the face of a Iew lookes ſo like other mens, that Eſther and Mordecai were not (of long) taken for what they were: He that made them, makes the diſtinction betwixt

them; ſo as a Iew may fall before a Perſian, &amp; get vp, and preuaile; but if a Perſian (or whoſoeuer of the Gentiles) begin to fall before a Iew, he can neither ſtay, nor riſe: There is an inuiſible hand of omnipotency that ſtrikes in for his owne, and confounds their oppoſites. O God, neither is thine hand ſhortned, nor thy bowels ſtraitned in thee; thou art ſtill and euer thy ſelfe; If wee be thy true ſpirituall Iſrael, neither earth nor hell ſhall preuaile againſt vs; we ſhall either ſtand ſure, or ſurely riſe, whiles our enemies ſhall lick the duſt.
                  
                  
                     
                     HAMAN hanged. MORDECAI aduanced.
                     
                     
                        
                           HAmans day is now comne; That vengeāce Eſther 7. 8. which hath hitherto ſlept, is now awake, and rouzeth vp it ſelfe to a iuſt execution; That heauy morning was but the preface to his laſt ſorrow, and the ſad preſage of his friends is verified in the ſpeaking; While the word was in their mouthes, the meſſengers were at the doore to fetch Haman to his funerall-banquet.
                     
                        
How little do we know what is towards vs? As the fiſhes that are taken in an euill net, and as the Eccles. 9. 12 birds that are caught in the ſnare, ſo are the ſonnes of men ſnared in an euill time, when it falleth ſuddenly vpon them.
                     It was (as Haman conceiued) the onely priuiledge of his dearneſſe, and the comfort of his preſent heauineſſe, that he only was called with the King, to Eſthers banquet, when this onely was meant for his bane: The face of this inuitation was faire, and promiſed much; and now the ingenuous man begins to ſet good conſtructions vpon all euents. Surelv (thinkes he) the King was tyed in his honor to giue ſome publique gratification to Mordecai;
                        
ſo good an office could deſerue no leſſe, then an houres glory; But little doth my maſter know what termes there are betwixt me, and Mordecai; had he fully vnderſtood the inſolencies of this Iew, and ſhould notwithſtanding haue inioined me to honour him, I might haue had iuſt cauſe to complaine of diſgrace, and diſparagement; but now, ſince all this buſineſſe hath beene caried in ignorance, and caſualty, vvhy doe I wrong my ſelfe in being too much affected vvith that vvhich was not ill meant? Had either the King, or Queene, abated ought of their fauour to mee, I might haue dined at home; now this renued inuitation argues me to ſtand right in the grace of both:

And why may not I hope, this day, to meet with a good occaſion of my deſired reuenge? How iuſt will it ſeeme to the King, that the ſame man whō he hath publikely rewarded for his loyalty, ſhould now bee publiquely puniſhed for his diſobedience?
                     With ſuch like thoughts Haman cheares vp himſelfe; and addreſſes himſelfe to the royall banquet, with a coūtenāce that wold fain ſeem to forget his mornings taske: Eſther workes her face to an vnwilling ſmile vpon that hatefull gueſt; and the King (as not guilty of any indignity that he hath put vpon his fauorite) frames himſelfe to as much cheerfulneſs, as his want of reſt would permit. The table is royally furniſhed

with all delicate confections, with all pleaſing liquors: King Ahaſuerus ſo eates, as one that both knew hee was, and meant to make himſelfe, welcome: Haman ſo poures in, as one that meant to drowne his cares; And now, in this fulneſſe of cheere, the King hungers for that long-delayed ſuit of Queene Eſther; Thrice, hath he graciouſly call'd for it; and (as a man conſtāt to his owne fauours) thrice hath he, in the ſame words vowed the performance of it, though to the halfe of his Kingdome: It falls out oftentimes, that when large promiſes fall ſuddenly from great perſons, they abate by leiſure; and ſhrinke vpon cold thoughts; here King Ahaſuerus is not more liberall

in his offer, then firme in his reſolutions; as if his firſt word had beene, like his law, vnalterable. I am aſhamed to miſſe that ſteddineſſe in Chriſtians, which I finde in a Pagan. It was a great word that he had ſaid, yet he eates it not, as ouer-lauiſhly ſpoken: but doubles, and trebbles it with hearty aſſurances of a reall proſecution; whiles thoſe tongues which profeſſe the name of the true God, ſay, and vnſay at pleaſure; recanting their good purpoſes, contradicting their owne iuſt ingagements vpon no cauſe, but their owne changeableneſſe.
                     It is not for Queene Eſther to driue off any longer, the ſame wiſedome that taught her to deferre her ſuit, now teaches her to

propound it; A well choſen ſeaſon is the greateſt aduantage of any action; which as it is ſeldome found in haſt, ſo is too often loſt in delay: Now therefore with an humble and gracefull obeyſance, and with a countenance ful of modeſt feare, and ſad grauity, ſhe ſo deliuers her petition, that the King might ſee, it was neceſſity that both forc't it vpon her, &amp; wrung it from her. If I haue found fauour in thy ſight O King, and if it pleaſe the King, let my life bee giuen me at my petition, and my people at my requeſt: Epectation is either a friend or an enemy, according to the occaſion: Ahaſuerus lookt for ſome high and difficult boon; now, that he heares his Queene beg for her life, it could not bee,

but that the ſurpluſage of his loue to her muſt be turned into fury againſt her aduerſary; and his zeale muſt bee ſo much more to her, as her ſuit was more meek &amp; humble. For we are ſold, I and my people, to be deſtroyed, to be ſlaine, and to periſh; but if we had beene ſold for bondmen, &amp; bondwome, I had held my tongue, although the enemy could not counteruaile the Kings damage. Crafty men are ſometimes choaked with their owne plots. It was the profer of ten thouſand talents wherewith Haman hoped both to purchaſe his intended reuenge, and the reputation of a worthy patriot; that ſumme is now laid in his diſh, for a iuſt argument of malicious corruption; for, well might Eſther plead; If wee Iewes
                        
deſerued death, what needed our ſlaughter to be bought out? and if we deſerued it not, what horrible cruelty was it to ſet a price vpon innocent blood? It is not any offence of ours, it is the only deſpight of an enemy that hath wrought our deſtruction.
                     Beſides, now it appeares the King was abuſed by miſ-information; the aduerſary ſuggeſted that the life of the Iewes could not ſtand with the Kings profit; whereas their very bondage ſhould bee more damage to the ſtate, thē all Hamans worth could counteruaile. Truth may bee ſmothered, but it cannot dye; it may be diſguiſed, but it will bee knowne; it may bee ſuppreſſed, but it will triumph.
                     
                        
But what ſhall wee ſay to ſo harſh an aggrauation? Could Eſther haue beene ſilent in a caſe of decreed bondage; who is now ſo vehement in a caſe of death? Certainly, to a generous nature, death is farre more eaſie then bondage; why would ſhe haue indured the greater, and yet ſo abhorres the leſſe? Was it for that the Iewes were already too well inured to captiuity; and thoſe euils are more tolerable wherewith wee are acquainted: Or, was it, for that there may be hopes in bondage, none in death? Surely, either of them were lamentable, and ſuch as might deſerue her humbleſt deprecation.
                     The Queene was going on, to haue ſaid, But, alas, nothing

will ſatisfie our bloody enemie, ſaue the vtter extirpation of mee, and my nation; when the impatient rage of the King interrupts her ſentence in the midſt, and (as if he had heard too much already, and could too eaſily ſupply the reſidue of her cōplaint) ſnatches the word out of her mouth, with a furious demand; Who is he, and where is he that durſt preſume in his heart to doe ſo? It was the intereſt of Queene Eſthers perſon that raiſed this ſtorme in Ahaſuerus; ſet that aſide, how quietly, how merily was the determined maſſacre of the Iewes formerly digeſted? Actions haue not the ſame face when we looke vpon them with contrary affections.
                     Now Queene Eſther muſters

vp her inward forces, and with an vndaunted courage, fixing her angry eyes vpon that hated Agagite, ſhee ſaies, The aduerſary, and enemy is this wicked Haman. The word was loath to come forth, but it ſtrikes home at the laſt. Neuer till now did Haman heare his true title; Before ſome had ſtiled him, noble; others great; ſome, magnificent, and ſome perhaps, vertuous; onely Eſther giues him his owne, wicked Haman; Ill-deſeruing greatneſſe doth in vaine promiſe to it ſelfe a perpetuitie of applauſe: If our waies be foule, the time ſhall come, when after all vaine flattery, after all our momentanie glory, our ſins ſhall be ript vp; and our iniquities laid before vs to our vtter confuſion.

With what conſternation did Haman now ſtand? How doe we thinke he lookt to heare himſelfe thus enſtyled, thus accuſed, yea, thus condemned? Certainly, death was in his face, and horror in euery of his ioynts; no ſenſe, no limme knowes his office: Faine would he ſpeake, but his tongue falters, and his lips tremble; faine would he make apologies vpon his knees, but his hart failes him; and tells him the euidence is too great, and the offence aboue all pardon: Onely guiltineſſe, and feare look through his eyes vpon the enraged countenance of his maſter; which now bodes nothing to him but reuenge, and death.
                     In what a paſſionate diſtemper

doth this banquet ſhut vp? King Ahaſuerus flyes from the table, as if hee had beene hurried away with a tempeſt. His wrath is too great to come forth at his mouth; onely his eye tels Haman that he hates to ſee him, &amp; vowes to ſee his diſpatch: For ſolitarineſſe, and not for pleaſure, doth hee now walke into his garden; and thinkes with himſelfe; What a monſter haue I fauoured? Is it poſſible that ſo much cruelty and preſumption ſhould harbour in a breſt that I thought ingenuous? Could I bee ſo bewitched as to paſſe ſo bloody a decree? Is my credulity thus abuſed by the trecherous ſubtilty of a miſcreant whom I truſted? I confeſſe it was my weake raſhneſſe to yeeld

vnto ſo prodigious a motion, but it was the villany of this Agagite, to circumuent me by falſe ſuggeſtions; He ſhall pay for my error; the world ſhall ſee, that as I exceeded in grace, ſo I wil not come ſhort in iuſtice. Haman, thy guilty blood ſhall expiate that innocent blood, which thy malice might haue ſhed.
                     In the meane time, Haman, ſo ſoone as euer he could recouer the qualme of his aſtoniſhment, finding himſelfe left alone with Queene Eſther, looſeth no time, ſpareth no breath to mitigate her anger, which had made way to his deſtruction. Doubtleſſe, with many vowes, and teares, and deierations, he labours to cleare his intentions to her perſon; bewailing

his danger, imploring her mercy, confeſſing the vniuſt extent of his malice, profering indeauors of ſatisfaction: Wretched man that I am, I am condemned before I ſpeake, and when I haue ſpoken, I am condemned: Vpon thy ſentence, O Queene, I ſee death awaits for me, in vaine ſhall I ſeeke to auoid it; It is thy will that I ſhould periſh; but let that little breath I haue left, acquit me ſo farre with thee, as to call heauen and earth to record, that in regard of thee, I dye innocent: It is true that mine impetuous malice miſcarried me againſt the nation of the Iewes, for the ſake of one ſtubborne offender; but did I know there was the leaſt drop of Iſraelitiſh blood in thy ſacred

perſon? could I ſuſpect that Mordecai, or that people, did ought concerne thee? Let not one death be enough for me if I would euer haue entertained any thought of euill againſt nation, or man, that ſhould haue coſt but a frowne from thee: All the court of Perſia can ſufficiently witneſſe how I haue magnified and adored thee, euer ſince the royall crowne was ſet on thy head; neither did I euer faile to doe thee all good offices vnto that my Soueraigne Maſter, whom thou haſt now mortally incenſed againſt me. O Queene, no hand can ſaue my life, but thine, that hath as good as bereaued it: ſhow mercy to him, that neuer meant but loyalty to thee: As euer thou

wouldſt oblige an humble and faithfull vaſſall to thee, as euer thou vvouldſt honour thy name, and ſexe, with the praiſe of tender compaſſion, take pitty vpon me, and ſpare that life vvhich ſhall be vowed to thy ſeruice: and, wheras thy diſpleaſure may iuſtly alledge againſt mee that rancorous plot for the extirpation of that people, vvhom I, too late, know to be thine, let it ſuffice that I hate, I curſe mine owne cruelty; and onely vpon that condition ſhall beg the repriuall of my life, that I ſhall worke, and procure by thy gracious ayd, a full defeazance of that vniuſt execution. O let fall vpon thy deſpairing ſeruant one word of fauour to my diſpleaſed Maſter, that I may yet liue.
                     
                        
Whiles hee vvas ſpeaking to this purpoſe, hauing proſtrate himſelfe (for the more humilitie) before the queene, and ſpread his armes in a vehement imploration vp to her bed; the King comes in, and, as not vnwilling to miſconſtrue the poſture of him, vvhom he now hated, ſaies, what, will hee force the Queene alſo before me in the houſe? That vvhich Haman meant as an humble ſuppliant, is interpreted as from a preſumptuous offender; How oftmight he haue done ſo, and more, vvhiles he vvas in fauour, vncenſured? Actions are not the ſame vvhen the man alters. As charity makes a good ſenſe of doubtfull occurrents, ſo preiudice and diſpleaſure takes all things (though

well-meant) at the vvorſt. It is an eaſie thing to picke a quarrell, vvhere vve intend a miſchiefe.
                     The wrath of the King is as a meſſenger of death: Whiles theſe vvords were yet in the mouth of Ahaſuerus, Haman, in turning his head towards the King, is ſuddenly muffled for his execution; he ſhall no more ſee either face, or Sun: he ſhall bee ſeene no more but as a ſpectacle of ſhame, and horror: and now he thinkes, Wo is me whoſe eyes ſerue me onely to foreſee the approch of a diſhonourable, and painfull death! what am I the better to haue been great? O that I had neuer beene, Oh that I could not be: How too truly haue Zereſh and my friends foretold me of this heauy deſtiny?

Now am I ready to feele what it is that I meant to thouſands of innocents; I ſhall dye with paine and ignominie: Oh that the conſcience of mine intended murder could die with me. It is no maruel if wicked men find nothing but vtter diſcomforts in their end: rather then faile, their former happineſſe ſhall ioyne with their imminent miſeries, to torment thē. It is the iuſt iudgement of God that preſumptuous ſinners ſhold be ſwallowed vp of thoſe euills, which they would not feare; Happy is that man, who hath grace to fore-ſee, and auoyd thoſe waies, which will lead him to a perfect confuſion. Happy is hee that hath ſo liued that hee can either welcome death as a friend,

or defie it as an enemy.
                     Who was euer the better for fauour paſt? thoſe that had before kiſſed the feet, and ſmiled in the face of Haman, are now as ready to couer his head, and helpe him to the gallowes. Harbonah one of the Chamberlaines, ſeaſonably tells the King how ſtately a gibbet Haman had newly ſet vp for well-deſeruing Mordecai, within his owne palace.
                     I heare not one man open his mouth to intercede for the offender, to pacifie the King, to excuſe or leſse the fact; euery one is ready to pull him down that is falling, to trample on him that is downe; yet no doubt, there were ſome of theſe Courtiers whom Haman had obliged; Had the cauſe been

better, thus it would haue beene. Euery curre is ready to fall vpon the dog that he ſees werryed; But here, it was the iuſt hand of God to ſet off all hearts from a man that had beene ſo vnreaſonably mercileſſe; and to raiſe vp enemies (euen among friēds) to him, that had profeſſed enmity to Gods Church: So let thine enemies periſh, ô Lord, vnſuccored, vnpitied. Then the King ſaid, hang him thereon: There can bee no truer iuſtice then in retaliation; who can complaine of his own meaſure: Behold the wicked trauaileth 
                        Pſal. 7. 14. 
                        with iniquity, and hath conceiued miſchiefe, and brought forth falſhood. He made a pit and digged it, &amp; is falne into the ditch that hee made. His miſchiefe ſhall returne vpon his
                        
                        owne head, and his violent dealing ſhal come downe vpon his owne pate.
                     
                     There hangs Haman, in more reproch, then euer he ſtood in honor; and Mordecai (who is now firſt knowne for what hee was) ſucceeds his fauour, and changes inheritances with his enemy; for whiles Haman inherits the gibbet of Mordecai, Mordecai inherits the houſe and honor of Haman. O Lord, let the malice of the wicked come to an end, but eſtabliſh thou the iuſt.
                     One houre hath changed the face of the Perſian Court; what ſtability is there in earthly greatneſſe? He who in the morning all knees bowed vnto, as more then a man, now hangs vp like a deſpiſed vermin, for a prey to the

rauens: He, who this morning was deſtin'd to the gallowes, now rules ouer Princes; neither was it for nothing, that hee this day rode in triumph: The Kings ring that was taken from Haman, is now giuen to Mordecai, as the pledge of his authority; and hee that euen now ſate in the gate, is called vp next to the throne. Wickedneſſe, and honeſt innocence haue now payd their debts to both their clients.
                     Little ioy would it yet haue been to Eſther, that her enemy was dead, her kinſman aduanced, if ſtill her people muſt for all this expect their fatall day: Her next ſuit therfore is for the ſafety of her nation, in the countermand of that bloody decree, which Haman
                        
had obtained againſt them: That which was ſurrepticiouſly gotten, and raſhly giuen, is ſo much more gladly reuerſed; by how much mercy is more pleaſing to a good nature, then cruell iniuſtice. Mordecai hath power to endite, ſeale, ſend out letters of fauor to the Iewes, which were cauſleſly ſentenced to the ſlaughter. If a Perſian law might not be reuerſed, yet it might be countercharged: Mordecai may not write, Let no Iew be ſlaine, he may write, Let the Iewes meet, and ſtand for their liues againſt thoſe that would ſlay them. This command flyes after the former, ſo faſt, as if it would ouer-take that, which it cannot recall; The Iewes are reuiued with this happy tydings,

that they may haue protection as well as enmity; that authority will not be their executioner; that their owne hands are allowed to be their auengers.
                     Who would imagine that after publike notice of this alteratiō at the Court; when the world could not chooſe but know the malicious ground of that wrongfull edict, the ſhamefull death of the procurer, the power of the party oppoſite; any one ſhould be found, throughout all the prouinces, that would once lift vp his hand againſt a Iew? that, with his owne danger, would indeauor to execute a controlled decree? The Church of God ſhould ceaſe to bee it ſelfe, if it wanted malicious perſecution;

there needs no other quarrell thē the name, the religion of Iſrael.
                     
                     Notwithſtanding the known fauour of the King, and the patronage of Mordecai, the thirteenth of Adar is meant to be a bloody day; Haman hath too many abettors in the Perſian dominions; theſe ioyne together to performe that ſentence, whereof the author repented: The Iewes take hart to defend themſelues, to kill their murtherers. All the prouinces are turn'd into a field of ciuill war; wherein innocence vanquiſheth malice. The Iewes are victors, &amp; not onely are aliue, but are feared; the moſt reſiſt them not, many aſſiſt them, &amp; ſome become theirs: The countenance of the great leads the world at pleaſure; feare

of authority ſwayes thouſands that are not guilty of a conſciēce.
                     Yea, beſides the liberty of defence, the Iewes are now made their owne Iuſticers; That there may be none left from the loynes of that accurſed Agagite, (who wold haue left none of the Iewiſh ſeed) they ſlay the ten ſons of Haman; &amp; obtaine new daies of further executions; Neither can death ſatisfie their reuēge; thoſe ten ſons of Haman ſhall, in their very carcaſſes beare the reproach of their father, and hang aloft vpon his gallowes.
                     Finally, no man doth, no man dares frowne vpon a Iew; they are now becomne Lords in the midſt of their captiuity; no maruell if they ordaine, and celebrate

their ioyfull Purim, for a perpetuall memory, to all poſterities, of their happy deliuerance. It were pity that the Church of God ſhould not haue ſun-ſhines, as well as ſtormes, and ſhould not meet with interchanges of ioy in their warfare, before they enter vpon the vnchangeable ioy of their endleſſe triumph.

                        I May not but tell my Reader, there was a miſtaking in the Poſt-ſcript of my late large volume; Wherein the Printer vndertooke the Authors promiſe, to publiſh no more, till he ſhould finiſh his whole labour, in a full ſecond Tome. Whereas I onely yeelded, for the incouragement of the buyer, to adde nothing to the firſt. Should theſe haue ſtayed the leaſure of my meditations vpon the new Teſtament; Some readers would haue complained to bee held too long faſting; Euen this ſmall intermiſsiō hath beene call'd on with no ſmall importunity of many; whoſe ſuggeſtion was no other then iuſt; that, as on the one ſide I might prouide for the eaſe of many buyers by an entire publication: So, on the other ſide, I ſhould diſcontent no fewer,
                     
                     who hauing furniſhed themſelues with the ſeuerall volumes of my Contemplations already publiſhed, ſhould be forced to breake the ſute, and to want the remaining parts. Out of theſe conſiderations, I was not vnwilling to ſend forth theſe thoughts, after their fellowes; beſeeching my reader not to haſten his expectation of my labours vpon the reſidue of the new Teſtament, which, vpon ſome priuate reaſons, haue reſolued to pace more ſlowly towards the publike light. God make theſe, and them, as profitable, as they are well meant to the Common good.
