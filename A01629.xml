            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

            THE
TRYALL AND
examination of a mans
owne ſelfe.
            
               CHAP. 1.
               What the true tryall and examination of
a Mans owne ſelfe is: and how generallie
neceſſarie to all manner of perſons, hauing
care and deſire of their ſaluation.
               
                  BRieflie (in deed) and
in very fewe wordes
is it ſaid by the Apoſtle,
Let a man examine
himſelfe:
                  1. Cor. 11. 28. but in
that breuitie, and in
thoſe fewe wordes,
hee effectuailie comprehendeth the
whole office and duetie of euerie ſuch
an one, as doth earneſtly deſire to be
reconciled, and to be at one with God;
yea, therein hee ſummarilie ſetteth
downe, and compendiouſlie preſcribeth
all and whatſoeuer is needefull

or expedient, for ech true Chriſtian to
doe &amp; performe. For, to examine a mans
owne ſelfe, is nothing elſe, than for him
throughly to trie, narrowly to ſearche,
and diligently to proue, who and what
maner of perſon he is; &amp; in what caſe
he inwardly feeleth his owne conſcience.
To the ſame effect, purpoſe and
meaning doth the Apoſtle in an other
place ſay,Gal. 6. 4. 
                  Let euerie man prooue his owne
works:
                  2. Cor. 13. 5. And again, Proue your ſelues whether
ye be in the faith: examine your ſelues.
               
               He therefore is to bee vnderſtoode,
rightly, duely, and truely to examine
himſelfe, which diligently and carefully
ſearcheth out, tryeth, groapeth, &amp; inwardly
rippeth vp euery corner of his
conſcience, and ſo narrowly fifteth
both his workes, actions and faith, that
he leaueth nothing in his whole man,
either outwardly or inwardly, whereof
he maketh not a true and perfect preſentment
vnto his Conſcience, and
(as it were) ſtrictly enditeth and iudicially
arraigneth at the Barre, as before
a moſt ſeuere Iudge. And looke
how neceſſary it is for euery one that
hath ſinned, (and by ſinning disfranchiſed
and baniſhed himſelfe from the
kingdome of heauen) to bende his

whole care and ſtudie, howe to come
into fauour againe with God, king of
the ſame heauenly kingdome: ſo neceſſary
is it, that before hee goe about
the ſame, he diligently trie and examine
himſelfe.
               
               For, no man can rightly acknowledge
his ſins, no man can truely confeſſe
his faith, no man can duely vſe
the Sacramentes, that doth not firſt
carefully trie and examine his owne
Conſcience. Furthermore, in vaine
doth a man either heare, reade, or
learne any good leſſons touching
ſounde doctrine and pure religion; in
vaine doth hee labour by ſtudie to attaine
the knowledge of matters diuine
and heauenly, vnleſſe he haue withall,
a full and reſolute purpoſe, to applie
the ſame vnto the tryall &amp; examination
of himſelfe. So greatly doth it ſtand vs
vpon, to make this tryall of our ſelues,
and ſo greatly materiall is it for vs, diligently
to exerciſe our ſelues therein,
as in the which the whole ſumme and
effect of our ſaluation conſiſteth,
               And doubtles, vnleſſe we ſpeedily, &amp;
while we haue time, trie and examine
our ſelues, and by earneſt &amp; hearty repentance
turne vnto the Lord, it is to

be feared, leaſt God being angrie with
vs, doe for our hardneſſe of heart harden
vs more and more, as hee hardened
Pharao; leaſt for our wilfull blindnes,
he blindfolde vs altogether; leaſt
for our wicked, filthie, licentious and
reprobatelike life,Rom. 1. 28 &amp; 11. hee turne vs vp, and
giue vs ouer vnto a reprobate minde;
and leaſt in his heauie diſpleaſure
he deliuer vs vp vnto our owne vile
affections &amp; lawleſſe luſtes, to wallow
ſtill in the filthie mier of our abhominations
&amp; filthie deuiſes, neuer to bee
able ſo much as once to thinke of our
ſaluation, or once to raiſe vp our cogitations
toward heauenly things. Than
which euil and miſchiefe, what can be
more grieuous, more hainous or lamentable
in this miſerable and wretched
life of ours?
               Let therefore euerie one ſpeedily, &amp;
while he hath time, frame himſelfe to
make this triall, that he may be receiued
of God into fauour againe. Let vs
now at length awake out of this our
deepe letharge and ſleepe of ſinne; let
vs once renounce, defie, and caſt away
the works of darkeneſſe,Rom. 3. 12. that we may
walke comely and honeſtlie as in the
day, garniſhed and apparailed with

the workes of light, as liuely members
of Chriſts Church in the holie fellowſhippe
of faithfull beleeuers.
               Nowe, in what ſort and manner this
Tryall and examination of our ſelues
is to be made and performed; how and
which way we may come into fauour
again with God; how alſo after our reconciliation
we muſt demeane, and
bel
                     •
                  aue our ſelues, and how we ought
to frame our liues and conuerſation,
that we may alwaies haue a clear conſcience
toward God,Act. 24. 16 and toward men,
we will endeuour the beſt we can (according
to that proportion and meaſure
of skill wherewith the Lord hath
endued vs) plainely and familiarly to
declare: beſeeching the eternall and
bleſſed Spirite of God, who was ſent
downe from heauen, from the Father
and the Sonne, to teach vs all trueth,
ſo to direct our vnderſtandinges, and
to further our endeuours, that we may
ſet downe nothing, but that which
ſhall be meete, wholſome, and profitable
to inſtruct Chriſtian conſciences
withall: and moreouer ſo to moue and
enflame the heartes and mindes of all
ſuch as ſhall reade theſe our dooings;
that as we ſimplie and with a deſire to

profite them, haue taken this trauaile
in hand; ſo they with the like ſinglenes
and meaning may reade the ſame, and
apply all thinges herein compriſed to
their godly furtheraunce and edification.
            
            
               CHAP.2.
               The examination and tryall of our owne
ſelues muſt firſt beginne at the conſideration
of our owne corrupt nature,
               WHoſoeuer thou be, that
art inwardly touched
with any care of thine
owne ſaluation, and
doeſt inwardly groane
with earneſt deſire to ſtande in the fauour
of God, and to bee at one with
him; firſt of all and before all other
thinges, (I pray thee) enter into thy
ſelfe, deſcende into thine owne conſcience,
and make a true ſurueye of
thine inwarde man; and thou ſhalt
quickly finde (I warrant thee) what a
ſuttle craftie Foxe, (euer hauing recourſe
to his peeuiſh nature) thou foſtereſt
and keepeſt within that ſame
fulſome ſtinking breaſt of thine. The

firſt ſtep to get helpe, and the chiefeſt
way to recouer health, is, for a man to
know himſelfe. In vaine is the medicin
miniſtred, where the diſeaſe is diſſemblingly
couered and kept vnknowen.
               Wilt thou therfore that I ſhall plainly
tell thee what maner of perſon thou
art, and what diſeaſe thou haſt? I ſaye,
thou art nothing elſe but ſinne; thou
art (euery whitte of thee) a wretched
ſinner, and guiltie of euerlaſting damnation.
Neuer goe about to denie it,
ſeeke no ſhifts or euaſions to gaineſay
it, neither take any exception againſt
it. The very woorde of God himſelfe
doth conuince thee, the prickes of
thine owne conſcience doe ouerthrow
thee, and daily experience doth detect
thee.
               For, firſt, the worde of God ſayeth 
thus of thy nature, being altogether
corrupted and ſtained, thorough the
fall and transgreſſion of our firſt Parentes,
and of thy ſinne which by propagation
thou haſt from them.Rom. 5. 12. 
                  By one
man ſinne entered into the world:

of one the fault came on all men to

was I borne, and in ſin hath my mother
conceiued me. Againe,Gen. 8. 21.

we are the children of wrath.
               
               
                   And feeleſt thou not within thee
manifeſt effectes of ſinne, to wit, the
luſtes and affections of the fleſh, leading
thee away from God, and making
thee both vnwilling and vnable
to liue vnder his lawe?Rom. 7. 
                        •
                     3. 
                  Feeleſt thou not
another lawe in thy members ſtill rebelling
against the lawe of thy minde? Thou feeleſt,
thou feeleſt (no doubt) the cumberſome
ſuggeſtions of ſin dwelling in
thee, continually drawing thee away
from doing good, and ſtill egging thee
forwarde to commit euill. Thou feeleſt
(I ſay) the wofull effectes of originall
ſinne, euen a minde voide of the
feare of God. Thou feeleſt thy ſelfe
not to loue God with all thy hart, with
all thy ſoule, &amp; with all thy ſtrength as
thou oughteſt to doe, and as thou art
bound to doe. Thou findeſt in thy ſelfe
and prooueſt by experience, that thou
art beſieged and beſette with ſorrowe,
griefe, heauineſſe and infinite other
like vexations of thy ſoule.
               
                   Moreouer, thou canſt not but ſee

theſe our bodies are ſubiect to innumerable
miſeries: thou ſeeſt the number
of diſeaſes aſſaulting vs: the extremitie
of famine pinching vs, the ramping
rage of hunger afflicting vs: the
miſerable plague of thirſt diſtreſſing
vs: thou ſeeſt death with his gryping
pawe, daylie catching, haling and making
hauocke of vs. And all theſe are
puniſhmentes appointed of God for
ſinne originall, Through ſinne death entred
into the world.
                  Rom. 5. 12.
               
               To be ſhort, thou feeleſt and findeſt 
a iuſt puniſhment &amp; deſerued plague,
euen in theſe outwarde thinges. The
earth bringeth forth thornes, brambles,
thyſtles, noiſome weeds, &amp; many
hurtfull thinges beſides. It bringeth
forth no good thing, vnleſſe it bee tilled
&amp; manured with great labour. Finallie,
what thinges ſoeuer for the
maintenance and ſuſtentation of this
our fraile &amp; tranſitorie life are requiſite
and needefull, the ſame are we (of
neceſſitie) driuen to ſeeke, &amp; procure
with continual cares and troubleſome
toile. All theſe diſcommodities and all
other miſeries whatſoeuer, wee muſt
knowe, and wee ought to knowe, to be
ſent vnto vs and inflicted vpon vs as a

penaltie or amercement for originall
ſinne.Gen. 3. 17. 
                  Curſed (ſaith God to the firſt
transgreſſour Adam) he the earth for thy
ſake: in ſorrowe ſhalt thou eat of it all the
daies of thy life: thornes and thiſtles ſhall is
bring forth to thee, and thou ſhalt eate the
herbe of the fielde: in the ſweate of thy face
ſhalt thou eate thy bread.
               
               Now therefore, aſwell by the authority
of the word of God, as by the ſenſe
and feeling of ſuch calamities and miſeries
as euery man euidently ſeeth &amp;
findeth in his mind, in his body, and in
the outwarde thinges of the worlde, I
thinke thou art ſufficiently perſwaded;
yea too too plainely conuicted, that
thou canſt not but (wil thou, nil thou)
thou muſt needes confeſſe thy ſelfe to
be a ſinner born, &amp; that thou art guilty
of euerlaſting damnation, euen in this
reſpect, for that thou art a mā, iſſued &amp;
deſcended from that firſt man Adam:
yea although thou thy ſelf in al thy life
haddeſt actually cōmitted none euill.
               When all theſe thinges are well imprinted
in thy mind, and that thou art
throughly reſolued, and perſwaded
that all this afore ſpoken is true, the
beſt and next way for thee to take,
that deſireſt and meaneſt to examine

thy ſelfe, is, diligently to conſider
theſe pointes following.
               Firſt, to bow the knees of thine hart 
before the tribunal ſeat of God, to cō
                  feſſe
thy faultes &amp; ſins, to ſubmit &amp; cō
                  mit
thy ſelfe wholly vnder the mighty
hand of God, ready to abide his diuine
pleaſure, if in the ſeuerity of his iuſtice
rather than in his mercy, he will deale
with thee according to the tenour of
that ſentence of incurring eternall
death, which hee pronounced vnto
man before his fall. Whenſoeuer (ſayth
he) you ſhall eate thereof, ye ſhall die.
                  Gen. 2. 2.
               
               Then, as often as thou feeleſt the 
effects of ſinne, and the puniſhments
thereof, ſuch as wee haue alreadie
ſaide, continually to bee perceiued,
ſeene, and felt in our mindes, in our
bodies, and in all our thinges ſubiect
to our outwarde ſenſes: ſo often call
to remembrance, that the ſame ought
to ſerue thee as tokens, and to put
thee in memory of thy guilt and tranſgreſſion:
and that therefore it neceſſarilie
ſtandeth thee vppon, to fall to
moſt earneſt repentance, to conſider
and thinke with thy ſelfe, that this
whole life which we here liue, ought to
bee a continuall meditation of repentance:

and that in the meane while, we
ought patiently to ſuffer all miſeries
and calamities, ſith we our ſelues were
the cauſe thereof, and by our owne
fault haue deſerued the ſame.
               
                   Laſt of all, (ſeeing we cannot by any
meanes ſhewe forth worthy repentance,
and pacifie God his anger iuſtly
conceiued againg vs (yea with the
ſway of ſin preuailing in vs, wee rather
exaſperate his furder wrath) it remaineth
for vs therefore, to take this ſure
courſe, euen to lift vp the eies of our
mind vnto our Mediator leſus Chriſt,
and to beſeech the Father to reſpect
the righteouſneſſe and obedience of
him alone; &amp; not to call into accompt
the vnrighteouſnes and diſobedience
either of our firſt parent, or of vs our
ſelues, but to impute the righteouſnes
of Chriſt vnto vs, as though it were
our owne. And hereunto let the words
of the Apoſtle by al meanes moue and
ſtirre thee: As by the offence of one, the
fault came on all men to condemnation,
                  Rom. 5. 18. 
                  ſo
by the inſtifieng of one, the benefite abounded
towarde all men to the iustification of
life, &amp;c. Theſe and the like reaſons,
drawing thee to the acknowledgement
of thy ſinne, to repentaunce,

to true inuocation of the name of
God, and humble imploring of his fatherly
mercie, thou maieſt well
thinke, thou haſt laide a good foundation,
and made a good entraunce
into the tryal and examination of thy
ſelfe.
            
            
               CHAP. 3.
               He that wil profitablie and rightlie trie and
examine himſelfe, muſt diligently conſider
his promiſe made at Baptiſme, and
how well m euery point he anſwereth the
ſame.
               
                  BVT it may bee, thou
comforteſt thy ſelfe and
waxeſt bolde, for that
long ago thou waſt baptized:
and thereupon
makeſt thy reckoning that all thy ſins,
aſwell originall as actuall before committed,
were then remitted and forgiuen
thee: and that therefore there is
no cauſe to charge thee, or laie before
thee any thing touching originall ſin;
and that thou canſt not for that ſinne
be any more called into queſtion, and
drawen into iudgement.
               
                  
Heere (loe) is there offered vnto
thee an occaſion of a newe, and altogether
a more ſeuere and preciſe examination.
For certainely, if thou purpoſe
earneſtly &amp; effectually to try thy
ſelfe, it is thy part and dutie, exactly &amp;
diligently to ſearche (as hath beene
ſayde afore) euery corner of thy Conſcience,
whether in euery degree and
reſpect thou haue vſed thy ſelfe and
dealt according to that ſolemne vowe
and profeſſion which thou madeſt
and vnder-tookeſt at thy Baptiſme.
Whereby it ſhall moſt plainely appeare,
whether there be any of thoſe
remnaunts of originall ſinne and olde
Adam yet remaining within thee,
or no.
               That thou maieſt the ſooner, the
readier and the reuerentlyer bringe
this to paſſe, it ſhall bee good for thee
firſt diligently to weigh and conſider
ſuch ſpeciall things &amp; materiall points
as are commonly vſed and ſolemnized
at the very time that Baptiſme is
miniſtred: namely what each ſeuerall
action meaneth, togeather with each
circumſtance and neceſſarie braunch
thereunto belonging. And this being
done, orderlie to proceede to the thorough

ſearch of each corner of thy inward
conſcience.
               Marke well therefore what was done, at
the time that thou waſt Baptized and ſolemnely
receiued into the Church, in the
ſight of God and his Angels, and of godlie
beleeuing brethren.
               
                  FIrſt there acknowledging thy ſelfe 
by nature to be the child of wrath,
ouerwhelmed &amp; drowned in ſins;
and ſo long as thou ſo liuedſt, to be vnder
the power of the Prince of darkenes:
thou cameſt penitently to the
Church; deepely and ſolemnely there
proteſting that thou wouldeſt forſake
the Diuel and all his workes, and that
thou wouldeſt liue a newe and better
life from thenceforth: that thou wouldeſt
become a new man, cleane contrary
to that thou waſt afore:Eph. 2. 19. and that
thou wouldeſt ſerue God alone in all
ſynceritie and godlineſſe of life.Act. 2. 38.
               
               Thou diddeſt thē alſo preſently make 
profeſſiō of thy faith &amp; beliefe in God
the father, in Ieſus Chriſt his ſonne, &amp;
in the holy Ghoſt; making there thy
humble praier, &amp; beleeuing that thou
ſhouldeſt be receiued into fauour and
grace, not for any works of righteouſneſſe

in the ſelfe (which were none at
all) but thorough the meere mercie of
God,Tit. 3. 5. by the bloude of Chriſt, and by
the lauer of regeneration.
               
                   After thou haddeſt thus bewailed
the wofull ſtate of thy miſerable vnworthines,
and publiquely proteſted
thine earneſt repentance, and withall
thereunto added a ſounde confeſsion
of thy faith:then was there likewiſe ſet
foorth vnto thee, the promiſe of God,
made vnto all that truely repent and
turne vnto him by a liuely faith,Mar. 16. 16 and
are baptized: Hee that ſhall beleeue and
bee baptized,
                  Joel. 2. 13. 
                  ſhall bee ſaued. Amend your
liues,
                  Act. 23. 8. 
                  and be baptized euerie one of you, in
the name of Jeſus Chriſt for the remiſſion
of ſinnes.
               
               
                   Theſe conteſtations and promiſes
beeing thus ſolemnely made on both
parts, thou waſt bapt. ſed, that is to ſay,
thou waſt dipped or ſprinckled with
water, &amp; therewithall the Word of God
was pronounced forth, hauing vertue
after a maruelous ſort to waſh &amp; take
away thy ſinnes by the bloudſheads of
Chriſt. The Word was added to the Element,
&amp; ſo was it made in thee a Sacrament:
eue
                     •
                   a Sacrament and Seale
of the righteouſnes of faith.
                  Rom. 4. 11. Of that faith
                  
(I ſaye) which thou euen a little while
afore diddeſt profeſſe; and of that righteouſneſſe,
which God promiſed vnto
thee. And it is (as it were) an Indenture
of Couenants, or mutuall handwriting
obligatory between God and
thee. For in this action of thy baptiſme
there paſſeth a certaine mutuall bond
or obligatō between you; euen much
like as betweene Barterers &amp; Bargainers:
but moſt aptly, properly,Epheſ. 5. and ſpecially
betweene the husband and the
wife. For, the couenaunt, promiſe and
bonde here made, is not for any ſhort
while, but euen for the whole ſpace of
thy life: and ſo long as thou continueſt
in this world, the memorie of this promiſe
&amp; couenant by thee made, ought
ſurely to bee imprinted in thy minde:
yea ſtill, euē ſo long as thy life laſteth,
it behooueth thee (all that euer thou
canſt) to endeuor thy ſelfe to accompliſhe
and performe thy promiſed couenants.
Thou art now in this ſort engraffed
into Chriſt, and incorporated
into his holy congregation,Rom. 6. 4. being the
Church,Eph. 2. 13. &amp; thou art receiued into the
number &amp; fellowſhip of the faithfull.
               Moreouer the very fourme, manner 
&amp; cuſtomable rite of Baptiſme it ſelfe

is a perpetuall witneſſe of thy vowed
promiſe, and admoniſheth thee of thy
duetie all the daies of thy life. Namely
firſt, when thou waſt put down into
the Font, dipped into the water, or
ſprinckled therewith, there was ſignified
vnto thee, the mortification of thy
ſelfe and all thy members, in that thou
diddeſt there openly and ſolemnely
profeſſe, that thou wouldeſt die vnto
ſinne. Againe, thy raiſing and lifting
vp againe out of the water, betokened
thy reſurrection and ryſing againe to
newnes and amendment of life. And
it did repreſent vnto thee, that like as
Chriſt died, was buried and raiſed vp
from the dead for thee,Rom. 6. 4. ſo ſhouldeſt
thou continually walke in righteouſnes
and true holineſſe.
               
                   Call further to remembrance what
great benefites thou haſt receiued in
Baptiſme, aſivel in being thereby aſſured
of the good promiſes of God there
and then made vnto thee, as alſo in
being therby the more encouraged &amp;
ſtirred vp to performe ſuch thinges as
thou for thy part there diddeſt promiſe
and vndertake. Firſt, thy ſinnes
all &amp; ſome, both originall, actuall and
acceſſarie, were there freely remitted

and forgiuen thee. Sinne ceaſed there
to be imputed vnto thee, and a newe
righteouſnes euē the righteouſnes of
Ieſus Chriſt) was beſtowed vpon thee.1. Cor. 6. 11.
The force and ſtrength of that ſinne
which naturally dwelt in thee,Tit. 3. 5. is broken
&amp; vanquiſhed that nowe it ſhould
not be able (as afore) to raigne any more
in thy mortal bodie,
                  Rom. 6. 12. 
                  neither that thou ſhouldeſt
obey the luſts thereof. Our old man is
crucified with him, that the body of ſin
might bee deſtroyed, that henceforth
we ſhould not ſerue ſinne. For indeed,
ſinne is in Baptiſme remitted &amp; done
away, but not ſo, as that we ſhould for
euer after be cleare and voide of it, but
that it ſhould not be any more laide to
our charge, or imputed vnto vs, and
that it ſhoulde not raigne in vs, or
beare ſoueraigne rule and domination
ouer vs. As Auguſtine doth very
well note in his Epiſtle to Julian, and
in his expoſition of the 102. Pſalme:
but moſt excellently and plainely is
it ſette out and explaned by the bleſſed
Apoſtle Paule in his Epiſtle to the
Romaines:Rom. 5. &amp; 7. 22. 
                  I delight in the lawe of God,
concerning the inner man: but I ſee an other
Law in my members rebelling againſt the
Law of my mind, &amp; leading me captiue vnto

the Lawe of ſinne, which is in my members,
&amp;c.
               
               There is alſo the holy Ghoſt giuen
vnto thee in Baptiſme, and that partly,
to bee (as it were) an earneſt-peny of
vndoubted aſſuraunce to thy conſcience,Rom. 8. 16.
for all thoſe good and ſpeciall
benefites which thou art to receiue,Eph. 1. 14. &amp; 5. 26.
ſpecially after this life: and partly to
bee (as it were) a cooperator in their
ſanctification, &amp; to aſſiſt vs in reſiſting
all the euill ſuggeſtions of the wicked
ſpirite, &amp; of ſin naturally bredde in vs.
The ſpirite (faith Paule) helpeth our infirmities.
                  Rom. 8. 16. 27.
For it cannot otherwiſe be, but
that whoſoeuer receiueth the Holy
Ghoſt, receiueth alſo many other moſt
ſingular gifts and excellent bleſſings.
For as he is a gift himſelf, ſo is he likewiſe
a bountifull beſtower, &amp; a liberall
diſpoſer of gifts heauenly &amp; ſpirituall.
He ſtrengthneth our faith, he enkindleth
in vs loue, hee foſtereth hope, hee
ſtirreth vs vp to ſhew forth the fruites
of good works,Rom. 12. and (to be ſhort) he ſanctifieth
and directeth the whole man.1. Cor. 12.
               
               Theſe ſixe moſt notable and excellent
thinges,Gal. 5. were at the time when
thou diddeſt receiue Baptiſme, fully
concluded, effectually profeſſed, and

autentically ſealed, partly in thee, and
partly through and by thee: and ought
therefore of thee to bee borne in memory,
&amp; neuer to ſlide out of thy daily
and hourely remembrance.
               Now doth it ſtand thee vpon, yea it
is thy bounden duty, and an eſpeciall
part of thy chiefeſt care, diligently to
conſider in what caſe thou ſtandeſt:
thou muſt (I ſay) now enter into thine
owne Conſcience, and there make a
true ſuruey of all thy dealinges, howe
thou art, howe thou haſt beene in life
and actions anſwerable vnto the ſame,
and after what ſort thou haſt perfourmed
thy promiſe, and obſerued theſe
thy ſealed couenants. God for his part
doth (doubtleſſe) ſtand to his promiſe:
for hee is true and faithfull, and neuer
ſtarteth from his worde, nor changeth
his purpoſe. And therefore gaue he to
thee then, and from that time foorth,
his holy ſpirit, as a pledge of his faithfull
promiſe and aſſured good will towardes
thee.
               Now, if thou on the other ſide, wilt
for thy part exactly ſift out, and ſearch
thy ſelf, how thou haſt diſcharged thy
vowed couenants, &amp; performed theſe
thy faithfull and ſolemne promiſes,

thou ſhalt without all doubt finde thy
ſelfe many and ſundrie waies guiltie.
Confeſſe the truth (I pray thee) and
ſpeake vnfainedly, whether thou haſt
not ſince that time fallen into thine
olde byas, and turned backe to thine
old crooked nature and corrupt manners?
Whether the lawe of thy members,
and the reliques of ſinne, naturally
ſtill cleauing vnto thee, haue not
manie times prouoked, allured, mooued,
yea enforced thee to attempt &amp;
practiſe ſome thing againſt the lawe of
God? Whether thou haue not ſometimes
liſtened, giuen eare and place
vnto Sathā (who alwaies lieth in waite
to catch theee) and hearkened to his
wicked temptations, allurementes,
counſells, and ſuggeſtions? Whether
thou haue ſo intirely continued dead
vnto ſinne, that thou haſt hitherto liued
onely vnto righteouſneſſe? Alas,
it is too plaine and true, that thine
owne Conſcience heerein accuſeth
thee, and within thee with open crie
teſtifieth againſt thee, that thou haſt
moſt hainouſlie manie times reuolted
from thy bargaine, falſified thy promiſe,
and careleſlie run headlong into
manifeſt iniquitie.
               
                  
If this then bee true, (as (alas) it is
moſt true) there is no ſhift but thou
needs muſt acknowledge &amp; cōfeſſe thy
ſelfe to be a creature moſt vile, wicked
&amp; miſerable. For firſt, thou muſt needs
yeeld, that thou art a leaguebreaker, a
falſifier of promiſe, a deſpiſer &amp; open
violatour of thy couenant made vnto
God the father: then which, what can
bee more horrible? Thou haſt fruſtrated
the wholſome effects of the death
&amp; reſurrection of Ieſus Chriſt, wherein
thou haſt with no leſſe contumelie reproched
Chriſt, then they which nailed
him on the Croſſe. Thou haſt greeued
the holy Ghoſt,Heb. 12. &amp; diſplaced him,
who had made a choiſe of thee,Epheſ. 4. as of
an houſe to dwell in.1. Cor. 6. The Angells of
God, whom afore by thy repentance &amp;
mortification thou cauſedſt to reioyce
ouer t
                     •
                  ee, now by thy new fall &amp; lewdneſſe
thou haſt brought to ſorrowe for
thee. The whole Church, which reioiced,
and was glad when ſhee receiued
thee for one of her dear new Citizens,
&amp; conceiued good hope of thy Chriſtian
towardnes, thou haſt now ſhamefully
deceiued, &amp; drawen into ſorowful
lamentation. To be ſhort, thou haſt
deſpoiled and bereft thy ſelfe of thoſe

giftes, which with the holy Ghoſt, and
by the holy Ghoſt, were bountifully &amp;
liberally beſtowed vpon thee.
               What ſhift or meane therefore remaineth,
if the Lorde being a iuſt and
righteous iudge ſhoulde ſtrictly deale
with thee for thy miſdeedes, and narrowly
looke into thy tranſgreſſions,
but that before his Tribunall ſeate in
the heauenly conſiſtorye, God the father,
God the ſonne, and God the holy
Ghoſt (accompanied with infinite legions
of bleſſed Angels, &amp; in the ſight
of the whole Church beho
                     •
                  ding &amp; approuing
it) ſhould pronounce thee for
one, that haſt worthely deſerued eternall
death, &amp; euerlaſting puniſhment,
as a periured caytife, as a treacherous
recreant, as a faithles promiſebreaker
as a falſe hearted wretch vnto God the
father, as a bloudy cutthrote, haling &amp;
drawing Chriſt vnto the Croſſe anew,
as an enimy to the Holy Ghoſt, as a
mocker of the bleſſed Aungels, as a
Traytor to the whole Church, as a
ſhamefull runne-away from the holy
congregation, and finally as a cruell
manqueller of thine owne ſelfe?
               What canſt thou now do? What way
wilt thou take? What hope or truſt cāſt

thou haue? What land, what ground
can patiently beare the burthen and
weight of thy wretched Carcaſſe?
What heauen, what ſunne, what planets,
what ſtarres can quietly looke
on thee, or willingly giue ſhine vnto
thee? Or what eies rather canſt thou,
or dareſt thou lift vp vnto heauen?
               The time was, when thou waſt in
excellent good ſtate, and waſt adorned
and endued with right excellent
giftes: but now through thine owne
fault and wilfulneſſe, thou haſt altered
thy caſe, and cauſed thoſe thinges
which of themſelues were good, holſome,
and to thee moſt profitable, to
turne all to thy harme and confuſion.
               Truely it had beene better for thee
neuer to haue heard of the will and
promiſe of God: neuer to haue beene
waſhed and cleanſed by the bloude of
Chriſt, then after all theſe,2. Pet. 2. 21. to forſake
the holy commandements, and like a
filthy ſwine to returne to thy wallowing
in the mier, and as a dogge to lap
vp his old vomit.
               Beholde nowe (wretched creature
that thou art) vnto what a dangerous
ſtaie thou haſt brought thy ſelfe
                     •
                  , and
with what maner of gaping gulf thou

art euen ready to be ſwallowed. If the
Lord God vouchſafe not in time with
mercy to releeue and ſuccour thee, it
will come to paſſe, that thee by wicked
&amp; vncleane ſpirit, which was once baniſhed
and caſt out of the waſhing of
thy newe birth and by the holy ghoſt,
will come and take vp his lodging againe
in thee; and not hee alone, but

IT is not ynough for thee, to confeſſe
thy ſelf in a generality, to haue grieuouſly
offended, to haue lewdly violated
and broken the couenaunt and
promiſe made with God, to haue conſented
to the ſuggeſtions of the Deuill
and thine own fleſh: but it is moſt
expedient for thee (if thy minde and
purpoſe bee thoroughly and fully to
trie and examine thy ſelfe) to rip vp
all thy actions and dealinges to the
very quicke, and preciſely to examine
and diſcuſſe all thoſe ſundry wayes
and meanes, whereby thou haſte any
way offended either God or thy neybour.
               Heere (be thou ſure) there will bee
layd open before thee a large volume,
&amp; a big booke, in the which thou ſhalt
prefectly ſee all thy deteſtnble ſinnes,
(which bee infinite) plainly ſet down,
clearely written, and apparantly diſcoucred.
Heerein ſhalt thou ſee ſtore
of witneſſes againſt thee: and heereby
beeing brought to thine aunſwere,
and drawne to the barre of Triall, thou
ſhalt bee enforced and (will thou,
nill thou) driuen, to yeelde accompts
for euery ſeuerall fact in particularty.
And therefore, ſo much as hytherto

hitherto hath beene yet ſpoken, may
wel ſeeme ſmall and of little account▪
if wee well weigh, and diligently compare
the ſame to that, which yet remaineth
vntold, and which now ſhal
                     •
                  
be (by Gods good grace) particularly
handled.
               This tryall or examination cannot
any way be ſo commodiouſlie and orderly
made, as by exactly calling vnto
our conſideration the written lawe o
                     •
                  
God, with all and ſingular the members,
braunches and circumſtaunce
                     •
                  
thereof. For the lawe of God (otherwiſe
called the Decalogue or tenne
Commaundementes) is as it were 
                     •
                  
cleare and bright Glaſſe, wherein we
may by and by, and at a bluſh perfectly
beholde our ſpirituall deformitie.
And of this lawe, the Scripture ſetteth
downe vnto vs three ſpeciall vſes.
               
                   Firſt, as a moſt wiſe Guide of our
life, it teacheth vs what we are to do,
and what wee are to leaue vndone
what wee are to deſire and ſeeke, and
what we are to loath and forſake.1. Tim. 1. 9. 
                  The
lawe is giuen to the diſobedient, to the vngodly
and ſinners, &amp;c.
                  Pſal. 119. 33. 
                  Teach mee O Lords
the way of thy commaundements.
               
               
                   Secondly, the lawe plainely ſetteth

downe before our eies, our manifolde
ſinnes and transgreſſions, and worketh
in vs a ſorrowfull griefe, and earneſt
repentaunce for the ſame.Rom. 3. 20. 
                  By the
lawe commeth the knowledge of ſinne.
                  Rom. 7. 7. And
againe, I knewe not ſinne but by the lawe.
For I had not knowen luſt, except the lawe
had ſaide, Thou ſhalt not lust. And a little
after: O wretched man that I am, who
ſhall deliuer me from the body of this ſinne?
And in the ſame Chapter:Verſ. 9. 
                  When the
commaundement came, ſinne reuiued, but
I dyed.
               
               Thirdly, the lawe (conuincing vs of 
moſt manifeſt guiltineſſe and malediction,
and no way able to ſatisfie and
pacify the wrath of god for the breach
of the ſame) biddeth vs for ſuccour to
flee vnto our Mediatour Chriſt, who
onely and alone deliuereth vs from
malediction and damnation, and taketh
the curſe due vnto vs vpon himſelfe.
                  Gal. 3. 13.
And againe,Verſ. 24. 
                  The lawe is our ſchoolemaiſter
to bring vs to Chriſt.
               
               LET vs nowe therefore in order
run ouer the whole preceptes and
commaundements of the lawe of
God, and let vs pauſe a while at each,
falling thee to thine anſwere for euerie

particular Commandement;1. Commandements. how
carefull thou haſte beene to keepe
them, and howe truely thou haſt diſcharged
thy bounden duety in obſeruing
and performing them: that when
thou haſte thus ſundry wayes founde
thine infirmities, and throughly conſidered
thy manifolde tranſgreſſions,
thou mayeſt certainly knowe, that vnleſſe,
the Mediator Ieſus Chriſt vouchſafe
to cloth thee with his righteouſneſſe,
and to impute vnto thee his obedience
and performaunce of the
Lawe, there is no remedy but that
thou muſt needes bee eternallie damned.
               
                  The firſt Commaundement
therefore is this:
                  
                     I am the Lorde thy God which brought
thee out of the Land of Aegypt,Deut. 5. 6. out of the
houſe of bondage: Thou ſhalt haue none other
Gods before my face.
                  
                  
                     HEre firſt, I wiſh thee well
and throughly to conſider,
what inward ſinnes
of minde and conſcience,
lodging only within

the ſecrete corners of thy heart, be
directly committed againſt this commaundement.
Then, the outwarde
ſinnes, ſuch (I mean) as openly break
out into action, and engender many
times great diſorders and offences.
And laſt of al, enter into diligent conſideration
of all ſuch ſinnes, as ſeeme
to proceede out of that trade of life,
wherein thou liueſt.
                  
                     Sinnes Inwarde.
                     COnſider well with thy ſelfe, whether
thou haue not nowe and
than conceiued ſome erroneous
opinions in thy minde of the onelye
true and eternall God, whereby thou
haſte beene drawen and moued, either
to ſome godleſſe doubting, or to ſome
curious queſtioning.
                     Whether thou be ignoraunt, or vnready
in any of thoſe cheefe points of
doctrine, Faith and Religion, which al
Chriſtians are bounde to knowe and
vnderſtand.
                     Whether thou haue ſecreatly in
heart, or otherwiſe priuily aſſented to
any manner of iuſtly condemned hereſie.
                     
                        
Whether, when thou haſt ſeene the
wicked to flooriſh in their ruffling deuiſes,
and to haue the worlde at will,
whereas (on the contrary ſide) the
godly haue beene and are commonly
afflicted with aduerſitie, &amp; when thou
haſt ſeene manie thinges to come to
paſſe in the worlde diſorderly, thou
haue thereupon doubted of the prouidence
or wiſedome of God.
                     Whether thou haſt beene alwaies
certainely perſwaded in thy conſcience,
that aſwell aduerſitie as proſperitie;
and trouble aſwell as quietnes is
ſent by the good wil of almighty God;
and whether in all ſeaſons thou haſt
thou haſt put thy whole truſt and confidence
in him onely.
                     Whether thou haue patiently ſuffered
all daungers that haue come vnto
thee, without any murmuring againſt
God, or kicking againſt his fatherly
chaſtiſement: &amp; whether thou
haue entirely therein reſigned thy will
to his diuine pleaſure, accounting and
confeſſing thy ſelfe worthy of thoſe &amp;
greater ſcourges,
                     Whether when thou haſt beene in
great daungers and perills, thou haue
had any diſtruſt, that god either would

not, or could not deliuer thee. By the

                           •
                        ne, thou haſt derogated from the
goodneſſe of God; by the other from
his power. But both the one and the
other be directly againſt his promiſes.
                     Whether thou haue beene puffed
vp with pride and arrogancie, for the
gifts that God hath beſtowed on thee,
glorying therefore in thy ſelfe rather
than in God, and for the ſame haſt
diſdained thy brethren. For, all pride
tendeth to the hinderance of the glorie
of God.
                     Whether for the obtaining of ſaluation,
thou haue aſcribed any part therof
either to thine owne or to any other
mans merites, and haue not depended
wholly and onely vpon the
merites of Chriſt and his diuine mercie.
                     Whether thou haue addicted thy
minde to any manner of thing then to
God. For that thing is to euerie man
his God, which he chiefly loueth, and
ſpecially delighteth in, whether the
ſame be Angell, or man, or what creature
elſe ſoeuer.
                     Whether thou haue doone ſuche
things as ſerue for the honour of god,
ſyncerely and ſimply for the l
                           •
                        ue thou

beareſt vnto God himſelfe, and not for
any other ends: &amp; whether thou haue
done ſuch thinges vnfeinedly, with all
thy heart, with all thy minde, with all
thy ſtrength. For without a ſincere
meaning, thy ſeruice and obedience
is hypocriticall, and being vnperfect,
it maketh thee guilty.
                  
                  
                     Sinnes externall and outward.
                     THeſe ſinnes doe proceede alſo, all
of them from the heart. For they
are firſt inward and internall: but
when they burſt out into act, then are
they alſo outwarde and externall: and
the more hainous and greeuous are
theſe in this reſpect, for that thereby
our neighbour is hurt aſwell as our
ſelues, and by our euil example is moued
and brought to ſinne.
                     Call to remembraunce therefore
and conſider, whether thou haue euer
ſhewed thy ſelfe by any ſign or token,
to haue fauoured and allowed any vnſound
opinions concerning God, or
matters of Fayth; and whether thou
haue euer gone about by perſwaſion
to drawe others to the ſame, thy

erronious conceites and wilfull aſſertions.
                     Whether in the cauſes and pointes
of Chriſtian religion, thou haue at any
time ſpoken otherwiſe with thy
tong, then thou haſt inwardly thought
and beleeued in thy heart: as though
thou thoughteſt it ynough (ſo that
thou keepe thy conſcience a right to
God) that otherwiſe it mattereth not
at all, what thou ſaydeſt or vnſaydeſt,
confeſſedſt or deniedſt before men, as
time and place occaſioned thee. This
is an horrible offence, and a plain preferring
of men before God, and this is
a ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſte.
                     Whether thou haue euer and in euery
place ſo framed thy life, and directed
thy actions, that all men might
perceiue and knowe that thine earneſte
purpoſe and intent vvas to
ſanctifie the name of the LORDE
GOD.
                     Whether for the auoiding of any

haue truſted to the helpe, protection

good or badde, or of menne, or
of anye other creature what-ſoeur;

as though they were able to haue holpen
thee aſwell as God. For there is
none to bee inuocated &amp; ſought vnto
for helpe, but God onely.
                     Whether for the procuring of any
thing either good or badde, thou haue
vſed any vnlawfull meanes, or ſuperſtitious
&amp; damnable helpes. Of which
ſort bee the obſeruation and choiſe of
daies, of Planetarie houres, of motions
and courſes of ſtarres, mumbling

                     Whether thou haue vſed thus to do

which (certainly) is a very wicked and

                     Whether thou haue miſuſed the holy
Word of God, conteined in the ſacred

meant, ſpoken and vttered, or in applying
it to ſuch matters and purpoſes
as it ought not to bee applied vnto,
as namely to guming, ieſting, balletting,

                     Whether thou haſte adiured or enforced

about ſome trifling toy and friuolous

conceit, or ſome ſuch drift as
tended to the daunger of ſuch as bee

they had beene fit Miniſters for ſuch

howe he diſchargeth his oth,4. Commandement. whereby

they knewe well ynough to
be defectiue, naught, deceitfull, and
faulty.
                     Whether they haue ſworn that they
payed more for their wares, then in
truth they did: or that they would not
ſell the ſame any better cheape then
the price they pitched, and yet afterwarde
haue done otherwiſe.
                     ¶ Suters for mariage.
                        Suters for mariage. Whether the
ſooner and eaſier to win the good will

and conſent, the one of the other, they
haue vſed othes and aſſeuerations
faithfully to doe this or that, and to
bee thoſe perſons which they pretended
to be, and yet in trueth haue bin

of periurie.
                     Finally, whether in committing any
of theſe afore-named, thou haue been
therby the cauſe of offence to others,
and miniſtred vnto them occaſion to
commit the like. For being the cauſe
of offence, eyther in worde or deede,
to others, thou makeſt thy ſelfe guilty
of their ſinne, ouer and beſide thine

                     And whether when thou haſt ſeene

                     Remember the Sabboth day, that thou
keepe it holy. Sixe dayes ſhalt thou labour,
and doe all thy worke: but the ſeuenth day
is the Sabboth of the Lord thy God: In it
thou ſhalt not do any worke; thou, nor thy
ſonne, nor thy daughter, thy man ſeruaunt
nor thy maide, nor thy beaſt, nor thy ſtraunger
that is within thy gates. For in ſix daies
the Lorde made heauen and the earth, the
Sea, and all that in them is, and reſted the
ſeuenth day: therefore the Lorde bleſſed
the ſabboth day and hallowed it.

vſed that induſtry and diligence
which God requireth at thine hands.

                     To be ſhort: it is euery particular
man and womans dutie to looke about,Euery man particular.
&amp; it ſtandeth each man in hand
to conſider with himſelfe, according
to that trade, function, or kinde of life
wherein he liueth, whether he haue any
manner of waie ben the cauſe either
of the hurt, or of the death of an
other. As for example: The Maiſter,
when he commandeth his ſeruant to
lift or carrie ſuch great burthens,
whereby he is hurt in his bodie, or
peraduenture catcheth that harme,
whereof he can neuer be cured. Likewiſe,
he that willeth another to goe afore
through a deepe foord or water,
ouer ſome bridge, rotten planke, timber,
or ladder, where there is great apparance
of preſent danger. Hee alſo
that hurleth a ſtone, or ſhooteth an

arrow into ſuch place, where others do
vſually haunt and aſſemble. Alſo hee
that lendeth or letteth to hire to an other
a horſe, which hee knoweth to
haue naughtie trickes, as oftentimes
to haue ouerthrowen and caſt his rider,
to floūdre in the mire, to lie down

                     Infinite be the waies, whereby the

and which waie he hath offended, and
broght his neighbor into any hazard▪
perill, or danger.
                     Finally, whether in committing any

thou haſt beene a ſtumbling-blocke,
or the cauſe of fall to another.
And alſo, whether ſeeing others committing
any of the ſame, thou haue ſecretly
aſſented vnto them, neither
ſtaying them, nor reprouing thē, neither

thereof, when time and place ſerued

                     THis commaundement
teacheth vs, that God
forbiddeth &amp; condemneth
in vs, euen all corrupt
affections &amp; cogitations.
And therefore condemneth
thoſe ſins which in our very thoughts
may be committed againſt the afore▪
going cōmaundements, namely thoſe
that be of the ſeconde Table. Thus
we ſee, that not our actions onely, but
our very frowarde will and corrupt
thought, is ſufficient to make vs guiltie
before God. And therefore there
be many pointes which thou art here
                           •
                        
in diligently and warily to call to thy
conſideration.
                     Namely, whether thou haue deſired
the dignitie, place, office, authoritie,

power, glory, countenance, and calling
of any other, ſpecially of thy ſuperiour
or equal; &amp; whether thou haſt
practiſed any wayes howe to diſplace
him, and ſettle thy ſelfe in his roome.
                     Whether thou haſt gone about to
hinder from preferment, thine inferiour
and vnderling.
                     Whether thou haſt entred into anie
deuiſe with thy ſelfe, how thou mighteſt
bring to paſſe this peruerſe deſire
of thine in this behalfe. Theſe are directly
againſt the fifth commaundement.
                     
                     Whether thou haſt felt within thee
ſuch wicked motions ariſing, that
thou haſt borne hatred to any, or wiſhed
any harme to his bodie.
                     Whether thou haſt long dwelt in anger
and malice towardes any man, euen
vnto an earneſt and heartie deſire
of reuenge.
                     Whether thou haſt had any determination
to purſue with effect, theſe
thy cruell deſires. And this is againſt
the ſixt Commaundement.
                     
                     Whether thou haue felt thy fleſh &amp;
thy wicked affections inwardly enflamed
to deſire vnlawful copulatiō with
any perſon, either preſent or abſent.
                     Whether thou haſt entered into

deuiſe how to bring to paſſe theſe thy
filthie deſires. This is againſt the ſeuenth
commaundement.
                     
                     Whether thou haue ſwelled with
rancour and enuie, at the proſperitie
and wealthie ſtate of another, wiſhing
the ſame to be thine.
                     Whether thou haſt entred into any
deuiſe, how to obtaine thy purpoſe, &amp;
haue thy deſire, Theſe are againſt the 8.
commaundement.
                     
                     Whether vpon an enuions and malitious
ſtomack, thou haue bethought
thee, how to diſable, empaire, and diminiſh
any other mans fame, credite,
dignitie, or eſtimation. This is againſt
the ix. commaundement.
                     
                  
                  
                     Sinnes externall and outward.
                     WHether by any ſignes, tokens
or argumentes, as with thine
eyes, beckes, &amp;c. thou haue
ſhewed thy ſelfe to deſire and couet any
other mans goodes, or to ſeeke
meanes to vndermine and deceaue
him.
                     Whether thou haue any way ſo to
behaue thy ſelfe, as either by painting,
pranking or garniſhing thy body, in

bragging, boaſting, or making glorious
ſhew &amp; report of thy welth, houſe,
apparel, furniture, money or ſuch like
thinges, that thou haſt thereby occaſioned
and prouoked an other to couet
and deſire thy body or thy goods.
In this ſorte and by this meanes thou
art the cauſe, of vnlawfull and forbidden
concupiſcences in an other.
                  
                  
                     For the trade of life.
                     WHether in that trade of life
wherein thou liueſt, thou haſt
euer haded anie vnlawefull
thought, will, or deſire, to haue any of
thinges in the former commaundementes
expreſſely prohibited, to bee
brought to effect, and actually accompliſhed.
And whereas we do not lightly
put any of our actions in practiſe,
but we firſt conceiue thē in our mind,
here doeſt thou plainly perceiue, that
in this Tenth Commaundement all
thoſe hidden, ſecret, and lurking cogitations,
deſires, willes and affections
(for theſe euer goe before the act
or deede) are flatly forbidden, prohibited
and condemned.
                     Finally, whether by any ſignes of

concupiſcence, ſhewed by thee, thou
haue giuen offence (that is to wit) occaſion
of concupiſcence to others.
                     Againe, whether hauing perceiued
and noted any ſignes of cōcupiſcence
in an other, thou haue in thy ſecrete
conceipt, allowed and well liked the
ſame.
                     ¶ And thus much generally &amp; plainly
ſpoken of the ſinnes committed, againſt
the Decalogue may ſuffice. Now
let vs ſee how thou oughteſt hereby to
make profitable try all of thy ſelfe, and
ſo to finde out what manner of man
thou art.
                     1 Firſt it behoueth thee with al attention
of mind to looke into theſe commaundementes
and tables, and therin
diligently to conſider, whether thou
finde any thing that neerely toucheth
thy conſcience and perſon; that thou
mayeſt perfectly ſee what ſpeciall
crimes and offences, thou art manifeſtly
guiltie of, before the tribunall
ſeate of God. For to this end properly
was the law by God giuen, and to this
ende, haue we collected and framed
this treati
                           •
                        e, in ſuch ſort and manner
as thou ſeeſt.
                     2 Secondly, thou ſhalt ſo throughly

examine thine actions, that thou muſt
looke well about thee, and conſider againe
and againe, whether in one and
the ſelfe ſame action thou haue in many
ſortes highly offended God: that
is, whether thou haue by the breach of
one commaundement, tranſgreſſed

                           〈◊〉
                        . For this cōmeth often ſo to paſſe,
as by example we will ſhewe.
                     ¶ If thou haue corrupted anye
wares, or any other thing, which thy
neighbour is to buy, and then ſell thē
vnto him for good; firſt of all thou
knoweſt that thou herein haſt ſinned
againſt the ix. Cōmandement, which forbiddeth
thee to giue falſe witneſſe.
But if thou diddeſt it, with an intent
and meaning to rake and ſcrape a priuate
gaine vniuſtly to thy ſelfe, with
the loſſe and hinderance of an other,
thou art therein guiltie of the breach
of the viii. Commandement, whereby is
forbidden all theft.
                     If furthermore in this behalfe,
thou haue deceiued anie that is thy
ſuperiour, or that is linked to thee in
bloud, as thy Father or thy Mother:
the Magiſtrate, the Miniſter of the
Church, thy kinſeman, &amp;c. therein
haſt thou tranſgreſſed the fifth Commaundement.
                        
of honouring Father and
Mother.
                     To be ſhort, if this circumſtance do
alſo concurre, that this cra
                           •
                        tie practiſe
were by thee doone on the Sabbaoth
day, then haſt thou heerein incurred
the diſpleaſure of Almightie God for
prophaning and not ſanctifying the
Sabbath day. Laſt of all, it may bee,
that in this bargayning and ſelling,
ſome ſuch woordes might paſſe from
thee, as might make thee further guiltie.
For if thou ſweareſt vainely, and
without cauſe, with an intent &amp; meaning
to auouch any thing that thou
wouldeſt haue to be beleeued, then
art thou therein guiltie of the thirde
commaundement. Thou ſhalt not take the
name of the Lorde thy God in vaine.
                     
                     ¶ Thirdly, we ſhall doe well, in the
examining and dicuſſing of thy actions,
to giue thee charge, circumſpectly
to conſider euerie particular circū
                        ſtance,
to wit, the time, the place, the
perſon, the cauſe, the end, the maner,
the inſtrument, &amp;c. No man wil denie,
but that the offence is farre greater &amp;
hainouſer, which is committed on the
Sabbath daye, or at ſuch time as all
men for ſome publike calamitie, are

in a generall heauines: againe, when
it is committed in the ſight and face
of many honeſt and graue perſons:
furthermore, when it is doone by, or
againſt any man in high authoritie;
moreouer, when no manner of alluring
occaſion went afore, to drawe or
mooue thee to that euill. Therefore
we may not ſlightly paſſe ouer, howe
much, and how greatly theſe circumſtances
doe aggrauate and augment
thy fault.
                     4 Fourthly, it ſtandeth thee vpon,
moreouer, often and many times to
conſider with thy ſelfe, and plainely
to confeſſe, that thou canſt neuer call
to memorie all thy ſinnes committed:
and againe, that thou canſt neuer exactly
ynough iudge, 
                           •
                        ow greeuous &amp;
deteſtable thoſe be, which doe alreadie
come to thy remembraunce. For
truely and diuinely hath the Prophet
ſet downe, who can vnderſtand his faults?
O clenſe me from my ſecret faultes.
                        Pſal. 19. 12. For ſo
ſtandeth thy caſe, that euen where
thou leaſt thinkeſt, thou there ſinneſt
moſt greeuouſly. And the thinges
which thou thinkeſt well and iuſtlie
done, are in the ſight of God, and before
the tribunall ſeate of the highe

iudge, vncleane, vnrighteous, and de
                        
                           •
                        ectrue.
And therefore the Prophet Iſaiah
cryeth out thus: We haue been all
as an vncleane thing, and al our righteouſneſſe
is as a filthy clout.
                        Jſa. 64. 6.
                     
                     Seeing therefore the caſe thus ſtandeth,
it is thy part and dutie, plainely
to confeſſe, that much ignoraunce remayneth
in thee, and that the ſame is
in thee a great ſinne: for the which,
vnleſſe God in mercy do pardon thee,
hee may hurle thee headlong into eternall
damnation.
                     5 Fiftly, thou muſt conſider that
there is cauſe ynough to condemne
and pronounce thee guiltie, for that
thou haſt not done thoſe good workes
which in the lawe are commaunded.
For looke how many ſinnes in euerie
particular commaundement are forbidden,
ſo many good workes in euery
commaundement are commaunded.
To euery ſinne there ought to anſwere
his contrarie, and that is, ſome
good worke.
                     ¶ Now if thou throughly examine
thy conſcience, thou ſhalt ſoone eſpy,
that thou haſt not perfourmed, no
not the leaſt part and portion of thoſe
thinges which the lawe of God requireth

at thy handes: yea, if thou narrowly
ſearch euery corner of thy ſelfe,
thou ſhalt finde that either thou haſt
fulfilled and perfourmed nothing at
all, or if thou haſt perfourmed anye
thing, yet ſhalt thou finde it to be vnperfect,
corrupt, and with ſome manner
of contagion infected. For all our
obedience is maymed, lame, and vnperfect.
Wherefore thou muſt ſay as
Chriſt hath taught vs all:Luc. 17. 10. 
                        Although we
had done all thoſe things that are commanded
vs. yet we are vnprofitable ſeruauntes.
Againe,Rom. 8. 7. 
                        The wiſedome of the flesh is enimitie
against God, for it is not ſubiect to
the lawe of God, neyther in deede can bee.
Againe in the 7. Chapter. I knowe that
in mee,

                        that is in my flesh dwelleth no good
thing: for to will is preſent with me, but I
finde no meanes to perfourme that which is
good. And, I delight in the lawe of God concerning
this inner man: but I ſee an other
lawe in my members, rebelling againſt
the lawe of my minde, and leading me cap

vnto the lawe of ſinne, which is in my
members.
                     
                     6 Sixtly, thou muſt caſt in thy mind
to conſider and record the paines and
puniſhmentes, which God threatneth
and inflicteth vpon thoſe that diſobey

and tranſgreſſe his commandements.
Of theſe paines, puniſhmentes, and
plagues, ſome be corporall and externall,
ſome ſpirituall and internall. Of
the firſt ſort are, barraineſſe and ſteriliti
                           •
                        
of the earth, hunger and dearth,
diſſentions and warres, diſeaſes, peſtilence,
baniſhmentes, ſhipwrackes, inundations
and ouerflowings, ſtormes,
calamities burninges, &amp;c. Of the latter
ſort are, ignoraunce of the ſcriptures,
famine of the woorde of God,
blindneſſe of the minde, incredulitie
and vnbeliefe, induration, or hardening
of the heart, deliuerie and giuing
vp into a reprobate ſenſe, &amp;c. A great
beadroll of plagues are reckoned vp
in the 28.Deut. 28. of Deuteronomie. But when
it pleaſeth him, the Lorde can and
will ſend many mo than are there expreſſed.
For hee daily prepareth and
maketh readie newe ſcourges &amp; whips
for diſobedient men, eue
                           •
                         as they dayly
commit newe ſinnes and offences.
For, alas, what miſerie doe wee nowe
day by day taſt and proue? what daungers?
What diſeaſes? What other incommodities,
which as it is to bee
thought, were not ſo much as once
knowen, by the very bare names, vnto

men in the olde men: nor ſo much as
once by any meanes ſpoken of? And
withall, thou ſhalt remember and call
to minde, the examples of ſuch as by
the iuſt iudgement of God, are read &amp;
reported of, in the bookes of the ſacred
ſcriptures, &amp; others alſo, to haue
been plagued with theſe puniſhments,
either bodily or ſpiritually: and it ſhall
alſo much further thee, to adde hereunto
ſuch as thou of thine own knowledge
within thy time and memorie,
haſt knowen to haue felt the heauie
hande of God.
                     7 Seuenthly, it ſhalbe very behouefull
for thee to conſider, that for thy
ſinnes and offences, others linked vnto
thee in conſanguinitie and kinred
are puniſhed, namely thy Parentes,
thy children, thy brethren, thy ſiſters,
&amp;c.euen as thou alſo ſomewhile muſt
ſmart for others ſinnes. For thus doe
we miſerable and wretched men draw
one an other into daunger, and one of
vs is guide and companion vnto another,
in running headlong to the
place of torment &amp; damnation. This
doeth God himſelfe affirme, when as
in the beginning of his decalogue he
ſayth: I am the Lorde thy God, a ielous

God, viſiting the iniquitie of the fathers,
vpon the children; vpon the third and vpon
the fourth generation of them that hau
                              •

                        1. Chro. 21. 14. So for one ſinne of king Dauid,
there were ſlame many thouſandes of
his people: and for his adulterie committed
with Vrias wife, the child which
ſhe bore him, dyed.2. Sam. 12. 18. And againe; For
the ſinnes of the people,Job. 34. 30 the Lord ſetteth
ouer them cruell tyrauntes, and
rauening hypocrites.1. Sam. 2. 31. 
                        Hely the Prieſt,
and all his poſteritie, was puniſhed for
the ſinnes of his children. Ah, what a
ſea of miſchiefes doth euen one ſinne
bring with it?
                     8 Eightly, there is yet one thing behinde,
to be conſidered, which is moſt
dreadfull and formidable. By reaſon
of thy ſinnes, thou art made guiltie of
eternall damnation: and after greeuous
puniſhmentes ſuſtayned here in
this worlde, there remayne yet behinde
other tormentes to be ſuffered
in an other, and the ſame much more
terrible, bitter, and laſting. For
there, both bodie and ſoule together
are ſubiected and adiudged to eternall
tormentes, and fire that neuer
ſhall bee quenched, which God
from afore the beginning of the world

hath prepared for the Diuell and all
the contemners of his precepts and
commaundements. Now, how horrible
a thing it is, and what an vnſpeakable
puniſhment it is, euerlaſtingly
to be depriued of the preſence &amp; face
of Almightie God, and to burne in
hell with vnquenchable fire, that ſhal
neuer be conſumed, there is no man
that can ſo much as conceiue in mind
or cogitation.
                     Goe to nowe therefore, whoſoeuer
thou art, and by this that we haue alreadie
ſpoken of the law of the Lord,
learne to examine thy conſcience,
and to make perfect tryall and ſuruey
of thy ſelfe. Doubtleſſe, when thou
haſt a little while continued and gone
forward in this way and courſe which
wee haue heere ſhewed, and attentiuely
conſidered, ſuch things as haue
beene declared, I doubt not, but that
thou wilt by and by, and without delay,

                         ſighes and teares, burſt
out into this confeſſion, O heauenly father,
J haue ſinned againſt heauen, and
againſt thee: I am not worthie to bee
called thy Sonne, I am not worthie to lifte
vp mine eves towardes heauen. Looke
howe much I being once in Baptiſme

purged from my ſinnes in the bloud
of thy ſonne, and ſanctified by receiuing
the holy Ghoſt, did in the ſame
pleaſe thee: ſomuch, againe, muſt I
needes by reaſon of my manifolde
ſinnes, ſince cōmitted, diſpleaſe thee.
Nowe, the ſinnes which I haue committed,
if I ſhould go about to number
them, they are infinite. For there is
not one of thy holy precepts &amp; commaundements,
againſt which I haue
not committed many offences, &amp; ſundry
tranſgreſſions. Many be they,
which I haue committed in acte and
deede: and ſuch as I haue not actually
brought to paſſe and done, yet
through my corrupt cogitations, and
vncleane will, I am as deepely guiltie
of, as if I in act had committed them.
To be briefe, my ſinnes ſurmount the
ſands of the Sea, &amp; if I make diligent
ſearch and inquirie of the greuouſneſſe
of my ſinnes, I truely find them
haynouſer &amp; greater, than I am able
to vtter. What ſay I, vtter? Nay, than
I can in mind conceiue, or in inwarde
cogitation comprehende. Certes, ſo
often as I looke into, and behold with
the eyes of my minde, my frowarde
heart, cankered ſtomack, peruerſe diſpoſition,

euer enclined to euil, which
thou Lord moſt cleerely &amp; throughly
ſeeſt, togither with my deſire and delight
to performe the ſame, the verie
remembrance of my great and greeuous
maliciouſneſſe driueth mee into
ſuch perplexitie, that I no wayes know
whither to turne me. Whither Lorde
ſhall I go from thy ſpirit, and whither ſhal
J flee from thy preſence? Yea this further
doth merueilouſly diſquiet, torment
&amp; greeue mee, for by my ſinnes I haue
giuen offence, that is, occaſion of fall,
and ruine to a great ſort of others, being
harmleſſe &amp; honeſt perſons. Wilt
thou Lord as a iuſt and vpright iudge,
require the bloud of them alſo at my
hands? What ſhal I further do? ſeeing
I haue burdened and ſpotted my conſcience,
by aſſenting alſo to other
mens ſinnes? in not diſſwading &amp; reclaiming
them, before they did euil, &amp;
in not reprouing and rebuking them
after they had done euil? Ah how
much better had it beene, that being a
man I had neuer beene ſo familiar among
men? What miſerie is this? I
am the cauſe of an other mans offending,
&amp; an other man likewiſe to me:
and thus doe wee all, encumber and

loade one another with ſinnes, and
dragg, pull, hale &amp; drawe one another
into the break-necke fall and lamentable
gulfe of eternall damnation. If
thou Lorde wilt ſtrictly looke what is
amiſſe. &amp; narrowly enquire of our iniquities.
O Lorde who ſhal be able to
abide it?Pſa. 130. 3 Moreouer, when I do ſomewhat
further conſider my ſinnes, I ſee
a great heape yet behind, &amp; many mo
than now come to memorie; manye
lewde prankes heretofore by me moſt
wickedly haue been don, which I then
thought had not been wicked, neither
can I at this preſent houre ſufficiētly
ſo iudge &amp; deeme of them: which ignorance,
blindneſſe and infirmitie of
mine in this behalf, I muſt needs confeſſe
(wil I, nill) to be imputable vnto
me, for a moſt greeuous and haynous
ſinne. And herein I perceiue, that although
I had committed none euil at
all afore, yet to haue herein again deſerued
euerlaſting tormentes. I had
almoſt ſayed, why Lord wouldſt thou
that this naughtie and corrupt ignorance
ſhould thus originally be bred
in vs, and thus ſtill to cleaue vnto vs?
Alas, I haue no ſacrifice to offer vnto
thee, to ſatisfie for mine ignorance.
                     
                        
Nowe what ſhall I ſay of my negligence
in not doing thoſe good works,
which thou in thy law haſt commanded
and appointed? Or if I haue done
any at all, yet was it not ſincerely
done, but many wayes infected with
hipocriſie, and other vices? For to omitte
a good worke, and to doc an ill
worke, are with thee accompted alike.
All theſe things therefore (I cō
                        feſſe)
do moſt vehemently, (&amp; good
cauſe why) diſquiet and greeue inee.
For my ſinnes are they, for which, O
God, thou iuſtly inflicteſt greeuous
puniſhments and plagues, aſwell ſpirituall
and internall, as corporall and
externall. And whereas I dayly finde
the ſame by experience, true, partly
in my ſelfe, partly in others, yet ſuch
is my blindneſſe &amp; hardneſſe of heart
that I am nothing at all as yet mooued
thereby vnto any repentance or
amendment.
                     To al theſe aforeſaid euils, there is
to be added yet another heap of miſchiefs,
vz, that for theſe ſinnes of mine
a great many other innocents &amp; gyltles
perſons be ioyntly with me, &amp; for
me wrapped in woes, and ſubiected to
miſerie, danger and inconuenience.

O Lord, wilt thou thus in thy iuſtice
deſtroy and make hauoke of thy iuſt,
for vs being wretched, vniuſt, and miſerable
caitiſes? Laſt of all, for theſe
my great, hainous and manifolde offences,
knowen and hidden, priuie, &amp;
apert, there is due yet vnto me after
this life, &amp; after this temporall death,
another death eternall, continuing
euerlaſtingly in neuer dying torments.
Is thy lawe (O Lord) being
good, righteous &amp; holy, thus become
to be vnto me death? But I may not,
nor I ought not, (O God) to aſcribe
and impute theſe moſt wretched miſeries,
and extreeme Calamities vnto
thy law, but to mine owne peruerſe,
froward, and crooked affections, and
to my generally and entierly corrupted
will.
                     To my ſelfe, to my ſelfe I ſaye, muſt
all this miſerie be aſcribed, &amp; my ſelfe
only may I thanke for all this heauie
plight and wretchedneſſe. O wretch
that I am, who ſhall deliuer me from the
body of this death.

thou art in the ſight of God, and in

Iawe of God, accuſing thee before the
tribunall ſeate of iudgement. In this

CHAP. V.
               WHen thou haſt nowe
thus farre profited and
reaped this benefit by
the lawe, that thou are
therby brought to the
acknowledgement of thy ſinnes: the
next is, with all thy minde, and vttermoſt
endeuour to betake thy ſelfe vnto
an earneſt and heartie repentance,
and to flee vnto Chriſte, for ſuccour,
pardon, and forgiueneſſe of all thy
ſinnes and offences. Vnleſſe wee acknowledge
our ſinnes, &amp; earneſtly repent
vs for the ſame, wee ſhall (as

Chriſt ſayth) periſh. And the Apoſtle
Peter ſetting before the eyes of the
lewes,Luc. 13. 3. their cruell, obſtinate, and wilfull
ſinnes, when as he ſpake vnto thē,
ſaying: This Jeſus whom God hath made
both Lorde and Chriſte,
                  Act. 2. 36. 
                  haue ye crucified,
brought them vnto an acknowledgment
of their ſins. And therfore anon
after, in the ſame place, when as they
by acknowledging their ſinnes, were
marueilouſly troubled in minde, and
pricked in heart, he replyed vnto thē
and ſayd, Repent ye and amend your liues,
Therefore it is not ſufficient to acknowledge
our ſinnes, but there muſt followe
alſo an earneſt and effectuall Repentaunce,
with all his circumſtances
and partes.
               Nowe, Repentance is nothing elſe,
but an earneſt conuerſion, &amp; turning
to God, of a ſinner, meekely and humbly
acknowledging his ſinnes and iniquities.
               And it conſiſteth ſummarily in theſe
two points, Contrition, and fayth: as
many places of the Scriptures doo
plainely and cuidently declare. Repent
(ſayth Chriſt) and beleeue the Goſpell.
                  Mar. 1. 15.
Where the firſt mēber ſignifieth Contrition,
the ſecond Faith.

                     ntye

of your former life, for the kingdom of heauē
is at hande. In which ſentence there is
likewiſe both Contrition and alſo Fayth
included. Hereunto alſo is to be referred
that, which is cyted and alleaged
by the Apoſtle both in his Epiſtle to
the Romanes,Rom. 9. 11. and alſo to the Colloſſians,Col. 2. 12.
touching mortification and alſo
viuification.
               Contrition therefore ſetteth before
our eies the heauie wrath of God, and
the puniſhmentes due for ſinne: On
the other ſide, Faith ſetteth before vs,
the mercies of God, free pardō &amp; forgiueneſſe,
and viuification or quickening
againe. The one laieth open and
diſcouereth vnto God, our wound and
diſeaſe: the other ſheweth forth &amp; receiueth
from God a ſuppling ſalue, a
mollifying plaſter, &amp; a ſoueraigne recuratiue
medicine. The one groaneth
vnder the burden of ſinne, &amp; ſorrowfully
bewaileth his heauy plight: the
other bringeth eaſement, &amp; affordeth
refection.Mat. 11. 28. 
                  Come vnto me (ſayth our Sauiour
Chriſt) all ye that labour and he heauie
laden, and I will refresh you. To bee
ſhort, the one throweth down to hell;
the other fetcheth from thence, and
lifteth vp to heauen.
               
                  
To drawe therefore the effect of all
the chiefeſt and eſpecialeſt pointes to
be conſidered of in this matter, into
ſmall roume and briefe wordes: Contrition
is a moſt vehement affliction,
troubleſome vexation, and perplexed
conſternation of the mind, yea of the
whole man, cauſed through remembraunce
and acknowledgement of his
ſinnes: &amp; alſo of a feare of Gods heauie
iudgements and deſerued puniſhmentes.
So that all this abaſhment,
vexation, affliction, perplexitie, and
conſternation hath his reſidence and
dwelling in the minde: inſomuch that
although there appeare withall ſometimes
vpon the ſodaine, certaine outward
tokens &amp; externall ſignes thereof,
as confeſſion of the mouth, teares,
ſighing, groaning, abſtinence from
meate and drinke, loathing, renouncing
or contempt of all worldly matters
and externall dealings, with ſuch
like: yet becauſe our queſtion in this
place is not of counterfeite, cloaked,
diſſembled, and vnperfect, but of true,
ſyncere, perfect, and effectual Contrition,
we muſt needes ſounde the very
depth of the heart, and the very innermoſt
and ſecreteſt corners of the

Conſcience.
               And to this end are the wordes of
the Prophet Dauid, where hee ſayth:
Thou deſireſt no ſacrifice,
                  Pſal. 51. 16. 
                  O God, though I
woulde giue it, neyther delighteſt thou in
burnt offering. The ſacrifices of God, are a
contrite ſpirite: a contrite and broken hart,
O God, thou wilt not deſpiſe. And againe:
Heale mee O Lorde,
                  Pſal. 6. 2. 
                  for my bones are ſore
vexed, and my ſoule is ſore troubled. And
a litle after in the ſame Pſalme:Ver. 6. 
                  I ſainted
in my mourning. I cauſe my bed euery
night to ſwimme, and water my couch with
my teares. So alſo Peter remembring
and acknowledging howe greeuouſly
he had ſinned in denying Chriſt,Mat. 26. 7
                        •
                     . 
                  went
out and wept bitterly.
               
               Seeing therefore that true, ſyncere,
and not hypocriticall Contrition, is a
thing meerely internall, and ſpiritual,
there is no man but well vnderſtandeth,
that it is a ſpirituall gifte, and a
ſingular benefite of almightie God,
who onely openeth the eyes of our
mindes, to ſee and confeſſe our ſinnes
and offences. If then it bee the good
gift of God, it ſtandeth euery one of
vs vpon, inceſſauntly to craue at the
handes of our heauenly father, to endue
vs ſeely creatures, and miſerable

forlorne wretches with his grace, to
vnderſtand and bewaile our greeuous
ſinnes, &amp; wickednes, manifoldly committed.
For whoſoeuer after his tranſgreſſion
&amp; fall, hath not this contrite
ſpirite, this bruſed and broken heart,
(as the Prophet tearmeth it) and this
ſpirituall mortification for his ſinnes,
to ſuch an one it may ſeeme, that the
way to all recouerie and amendment
is ſhut vp and ſtopped.
               For Contrition, is as it were a keye,
that openeth and driueth backe the
hidden bolt, and openeth the doore,
which kept vs backe from comming
againe to God. Neither canſt thou alleage
for thine excuſe, that thou lackeſt
time, or that thou art not able to
perfourine, and fulfill ſo manie harde
pointes and difficult workes, whereby
to teſtifie and declare thy contrition.
For ſeeing that it is wholly reſident
in the heart, and there onely conſiſteth,
it is brought to paſſe, and perfourmed
in verie ſhort ſpace of time,
yea in a verie moment: and further,
euen with the onely affections of the
minde.
               Moreouer, which will make thee
more to marueile: that which thou

once in this ſort faithfully &amp; humbly
atchiueſt, remaineth firme, acceptable
and ratified of God for euer after;
ſo that thou haue a ſtedfaſt &amp; an hartie
purpoſe neuer againe to returne to
thy former wickedneſſe. For in contrition,
thou muſt wholly and altogether
die vnto thy ſinnes: that is, thou
muſt ſo renounce them, as though
thou neuer intedeſt any more to haue
any dealing therwith. And ſuch (doutleſſe)
was the Contrition of the Publicane,
whoſe wordes were verie
briefe and fewe.Luc. 18. 13. 
                  God bee mercifull vnto
me a ſinner. Such Contrition was
alſo in the Theefe, which was crucified
with Chriſte, ſaying:Luc. 23. 42. 
                  Lorde remember
mee when thou commeſt into thy
kingdome. He therefore that will earneſtly
repent, and come into the fauour
of God againe, muſt bee touched
with ſuch an incomparable grief
for his ſinnes committed, that he muſt
reſolutely, and directly confeſſe himſelfe
to haue thereby iuſtly deſerued
al thoſe plagues, which God by Moſes
and the Prophetes hath threatned,
and thundered out vpon all the deſpiſers
of his worde, and contemners of
his Maieſtie: and that if God being

by nature moſt mercifull, ſhould not
vouchſafe to haue mercie and compaſſion
on him, he muſt needes (and
that preſently) incurre the greeuous
daunger, and feele intollerable ſmart
thereof.
               Wee were purpoſed hereunto, to
haue annexed ſome briefe and compendious
fourme of confeſſion, and
therein to haue made a plaine diſcouerie
and and anatomie of all the affections
of a corrupt heart, and alſo
to haue brought in, the ſorrowfull ſinner,
confeſſing himſelfe to haue iuſtly
deſerued all plagues and puniſhmentes,
aſwell of this life preſent, as
of the life to come, and aſwell corporall
as ſpirituall: and further alſo
to haue deſcribed him, vtterly denying
and renouncing himſelfe, and ſo
humbly ſtanding before the tribunall
of the Lorde, his God and iudge, ſubmitting
himſelfe wholly vnto his diuine
pleaſure and bleſſed will, wayting
for that ſentence and doome,
which ſhall beſt pleaſe him. But becauſe
partly in the Chapter laſt afore,
we haue alreadie in ſome ſort deliuered
ſuch a confeſſion: and partly for
that in the ſacred ſcriptures, many

good &amp; godly praiers are to be found,
ſet forth by the auncient fathers, and
holy men of God; euery godly, zealous,
and well diſpoſed man may therin
vertuouſly exerciſe himſelfe, and
thence take out for his godly comfort,
plentifull examples of Chriſtian
meditation.
               Of this ſort, there bee prayers for
ſinnes in Exodus,Exod. 32. in the booke of Nū

through faith in Ieſus Chriſt.
CHAP. VI.
               
                  AFter thou haſt thus,
ſome ſpace, like a giltie
&amp; ſuppliant ſuter,
proſtrated thy ſelfe
at the feet of thy iuſt
and righteous iudge,
and art driuen vnto ſuch a ſtraite and
narrowe iſſue, that thou canſt not any

manner of wayes denie, but that thou
haſt deſerued, and art moſt woorthie
of all terrible and eternall puniſhmentes,
and with the feare of this
iudgement, art verie ſore a mazed,
terrified, and perplexed, yea altogether
mortified, &amp; brought to deathes
brinke: the next waye and remedie
for thee nowe is, by fayth in the mercies
of God, to rayſe vppe thy ſelfe againe,
meekely and humbly crauing
pardon of thy ſinnes and miſdeedes.
Vnto this humble proſtrating of thy
ſelfe, thou waſt both profitably and
neceſſarily driuen through humble
confeſſion of thy ſinnes, and meeke
contrition of thy heart. But nowe
thou muſt take heede and beware, that
by conſideration of the ſeueritie of
Gods iudgements, thou bee not vtterly
diſcouraged, &amp; daſhed out of countenance,
and thereby enter into any
diſpaire, diffidence or diſtruſt of the
goodneſſe of God. It ſhall be very requiſite
therefore for thy comfor, and
as a ſoueraigne ſalue and cordiall medicine
againſt this inconuenience, to
lay downe before thee, ſome holeſome
and health ſome doctrine, howe thou
ſhalt haue ful remiſſion and foregiueneſſe

of al thy ſins through faith in Ieſus
Chriſt.Gen. 4. 13. Cain acknowledged &amp; confeſſed
his ſinne, and being therefore in
minde marueilouſly troubled, graunted
it to be moſt greeuous and haynous.Mat. 27. 3.
Iudas likewiſe openly condemneth
himſelfe for his great guilt and
treacherous crime in betraying his
maiſter, publiquely teſtifying and
pronouncing Chriſt to bee iuſt and
innocent; and further reſtoreth backe
the money which hee had receiued.
What will ye ſaye, lacked in him here
to be done more? And yet neyther
of them both obtayned pardon of
their ſinnes: &amp; why? forſooth becauſe
this free &amp; franke confeſſion of their
ſinnes was not accompanied with a
liuely fayth and vndoubted truſt in
the mercies of God, for pardon and
forgiuenes thereof.Mat. 26. 75▪
                   Contrariwiſe Peter
bewayled, and wept bitterly for his
ſinne,Mar. 14. 72. but yet ſo, that in the meane
while he ſhrūke not frō his firme faith,Luc. 22. 92.
And therefore within a while after,Joh. 18. 25▪
                   he
receiued a ſingular comfort and ſpeciall
conſolation from the mouth of
Chriſte himſelfe;Joh. 20. 15. after his reſurrection.
Therefore it is out of all doubt,
that faith is altogether and neceſſarily

behoouefull to all true &amp; penitent ſinners,
wherewith they may raiſe vp thē
ſelues againe, being throwen downe
with the burden of their offences. And
nowe, howe truely ſorrowfull and repentant
ſinners may by fayth, againe
be rayſed vp, we will plainely and euidently
declare.
               Faith is a ſure and ſtedfaſt truſt,
whereby we aſſure our ſelues that god
will performe vnto vs all thoſe things
that he hath promiſed, chiefely and
ſpecially, ſpirituall benefites, and in
them, remiſſion of our ſinnes; and
righteouſneſſe in Chriſt &amp; for Chriſt.
Which is confirmed by the authour of
the Epiſt, to the Heb,Heb. 11. 17 in theſe wordes.
Faith is the grounde of thinges which are
hoped for, and the euidence of thinges
which are not ſcene. The interpretation
and expoſition of which deſcription
(ſo farre as concerneth the vſe and
practiſe thereof) who ſo is deſirous to
know, may ſee ſet down in the 4. chap.
of the Epiſt. to the Rom. Wherein after
the Apoſtle had ſayde that Abraham
was iuſtified by faith, and that the
inheritaunce of the worlde was giuen
to him through fayth; he afterwarde
addeth, that this reuerend and bleſſed

Patriarch had reſpect vnto the goodneſſe
and power of God,Rom. 4. 17. 
                  whereby hee
quickeneth the dead, &amp; calleth thoſe things
which bee not, as though they were: And
therefore that aboue hope, that he should be
the father of many Nations, according to
that which was ſpoken to him. So shall thy
ſeede be.
                  Gen. 15. 5. 
                  And be not weake in this fayth,
conſidered not his owne bodie, which was
now dead, being almoſt an hundreth yeares
old, neither the deadneſſe of Saraes wombe:
Neyther did he doubt of the promiſe of God
through vnbeliefe, but was ſtrengthened in
the fayth, and gaue glorie to GOD, being
fully aſſured, that hee which had promiſed,
was alſo able to doe it, and therefore it was
imputed to him for righteouſneſſe. &amp;c.
Hereby may euery one eaſily perceiue
that faith vndoubtedly beleeueth that
thoſe thinges ſhall be perfourmed, and
through the goodneſſe and power of
God be brought to paſſe, which otherwiſe
ſeeme neuer poſſible to bee performed;
that faith doth alwayes looke
into the promiſes and power of God:
and finally, that faith is an aſſured,
certaine, vndoubted, and inuincible
perſwaſion, conceiued of the goodneſſe
and power of God, whereby this
glorie is aſcribed, attributed, and entitled

to God, that hee both will and
alſo can ſaue vs. All which are ſignified
in that vſuall and accuſtomed
fourme of confeſſion, which euerye
one priuately vndertaketh and pronounceth
for himſelfe, ſaying: I beleeue
in God. For in theſe fewe wordes
is ſet foorth and contayned the whole
ſumme and ſignification of fayth.
               Nowe heare and marke in fewe
wordes, howe thou art iuſtified by
fayth. Euen as the Apoſtle teacheth
vs,Rom. 4. 5. that Abraham was iuſtified by
fayth, without workes, and that his
fayth and ſure perſwaſion of Gods
goodneſſe and power was imputed to
him for righteouſneſſe: ſo muſt thou
make thy reckoning (whoſoeuer thou
bee that acknowledgeſt thy ſelfe a
greeuous ſinner, and that thou art
guiltie of the manifolde breache of
Gods law, and that thou haſt no good
workes of thine owne to oppoſe and
ſet againſt the ſeueritie of Gods iudgment)
that thou likewiſe and in the
ſame ſorte, ſhalt bee iuſtified by faith
without workes, as the Apoſtle in that
Chapter euidently and plainely teſtifieth.
He ſayth there alſo further, that
it is not written for him onely, that it was

imputed to him for righteouſneſſe, but alſo
for vs, to whom it shalbe imputed for righteouſneſſe,
which beleeue in him that rayſed
vp Jeſus our Lorde from the dead: who
was deliuered to death for our ſinnes, and
is riſen againe for our iuſtification. This
therefore is required at thy hand (ſeein
thou haſt no manner of helpe in
thy ſelfe, whereby to obtayne thy ſaluation,
eyther by thine owne workes
or any others) that thou conceaue a
ſure and vndoubted fayth, and a ſtedfaſt
and firme perſwaſion of the goodneſſe
and power of God: and that thou
be fully perſwaded, and throughly aſſured
in thy conſcience: that God the
father, will receiue thee againe into
fauour, that he will pardon &amp; forgiue
thee thy ſinnes, and that he will iuſtifie
and make thee righteous for his
ſonne Ieſus Chriſt, as he by his owne
expreſſe words, by his holy Prophets,
and laſt of all, by the ſame his beloued
ſonne, hath graciouſly promiſed.
For if from the bottome of thy heart,
thou vnfaynedly beleeue the promiſes
of God touching this matter made
vnto the holy fathers of olde, be thou
aſſured that thou art in the kings high
way to iuſtification and ſaluation.
               
                  
Theſe promiſes haue euer from
the beginning of the worlde hitherto
beene euidently continued, and
ſhall to the worldes end be moſt faithfully
and truely perfourmed. Immediately
after the tranſgreſſion and fall
of our firſt parentes Adam and Eue,
this promiſe of Chriſt was made vnto
them, when as the Lorde ſpake vnto
the ſerpent.Gen. 3. 58. 
                  I will put 
                        •
                     nmitie betweene
thee and the woman, and betweene thy
ſeede and her ſeede: he shall breake thine
head. Afterwarde he ſpake vnto Abraham,
ſaying:Gen. 22. 1. 
                  In thy ſeede shall all Nations
of the earth be bleſſed.
                  Gal. 3. 19. Which promiſe
is excellently expounded by the
Apoſtle, to ſignifie and to be meant
of Chriſt. This promiſe was likewiſe
made vnto Dauid, that of his ſeede
and poſteritie, Chriſt the Sauiour of
the worlde ſhould be borne.

                        •

moſt clearely and manifeſtly propheſie
and foretell of Chriſtes comming,Pſal. 132. 
                        •

of Chriſts humiliation &amp; death,Mat. 17. 5.

                  Hee shall
ſee fruite of the trauayle of his ſoule,
                  
                     
                        •
                     ſa. 53. 11.
                  
                  and shall bee ſatisfied: by his knowledge
ſhall he iuſtifie manie: for hee ſhall beare
their iniquities. To be ſhorte, manie
figures, ſignes and types, acertayned,
inſinuated and repreſented vnto
mens mindes, thoſe thinges which
were to be done &amp; finiſhed by Chriſte
for our iuſtification:Num. 21. 9. the braſen ſerpent
was ſet vpon a poale in the wilderneſſe,Joh. 3. 14.
and ſundrie ſacrifices by
the Iſraelites vſed,Exod. 2. 48. were figures of
Chriſt,Heb. 9. 9. and foreſhewed both his comming
in the fleſhe, &amp; his death which
hee ſhoulde ſuffer for our inſtification.
               Now that thou maieſt knowe, how
for Chriſt, and in Chriſt our ſinnes are
pardoned and forgiuen vs, and righteouſnes
imputed vnto vs, thou muſt
looke into his death, which hee ſuffered
to pacifie and ſatisfie the wrath of
God the father for our ſinnes. This
ſingular benefite, and vnſpeakable act
of Chriſte, together with the moſt ſoueraigne
vertue and efficacie of the
ſame, is in many places both of the
olde Teſtament and of the new, notably
deſcribed. For this his death and
paſſion was figured and foreſhewed by
the types and ſacrifices before expreſſed.

This death and paſſion of our
Sauiour and redeemer Chriſte, was
moſt excellently, pithily, and cleerely
ſet out and foretolde by the Prophet
Iſaiah in the Chapter afore recited.Iſa. 53.
And Chriſt ſayth himſelfe: This
is the bloud of the new Testament which is
ſhed for you and for manie,
                  Mat. 26. 28 
                  for the remiſſion
of ſinnes.
                  Mar. 14. 24 By the death and bloudſhed
of Ieſus Chriſt,Rom. 4. 25. we are ſayed,Eph. 1. 7. in
many places of ſcripture to be ſanctified
and clenſed from our ſinnes.Colloſ. 1. 14 In an
other place alſo the Apoſtle ſpeakingHeb. 13. 12
of Chriſt,1. Iohn. 1. 7. ſayth:Eph. 5. 20. 
                  He gaue himſelfe for
vs, to be an offering and a ſacrifice &amp;c. In
this ſort therefore, and after this manner,
doth our heauenly father (being
pacified and pleaſed with vs through
the death of Chriſt) forgiue and pardon
our ſinnes, and imputeth vnto vs
his righteouſneſſe.
               But thou wilt ſaye; howe knowe I,
whether this merite of Chriſte, this
remiſſion of ſinnes, and this gift and
imputation of righteouſneſſe for
Chriſt, be beneficiall, profitable, and
applyable to mee or no? For we muſt
euer ſtande in feare and doubt, leaſt
wee be excluded from the participation
of thoſe ſo vneſtimable benefites,

as Chriſt brought and wrought. But
to anſwere thee in this caſe, and becauſe
thou ſhalt not be vnfurniſhed
of a ſtayed perſwaſion herein, be thou
thus aſſured, that the worde of God
doeth moſt plainly direct and point
thee to ſundry places, and alledgeth
vnto thee manifolde textes and reaſons,
whereby thou mayſt vndoubtedly
knowe that thy ſinnes are forgiuen
thee for Chriſts ſake, if thou doeſt
earneſtly repent thee of thy wickedneſſe,
and withall beleeue that God
the father for Chriſt his ſonne, will
receiue thee into fauour, and forgiue
thee thy ſinnes, in this thy beleeuing,
be thou ſure thou ſhalt obtaine pardon
and remiſſion of all thy ſinnes
and offences, which the ſcripture
doeth in many places teſtifie and declare.Gen. 15. 6.
                  Abraham beleeued God, &amp; it was
imputed to him for righteouſneſſe. Which
ſentence, the Apoſtle in his Epiſtle
to the Romans, namely in his fourth
Chapter, vſeth for his theme, or principall
ground-worke to his whole
diſcourſe of this matter there by him
handeled.Heb. 11. The author of the Epiſtle
to the Hebrewes affirmeth, that all
the holy fathers, and Patriarches in

the olde time, were in this ſort iuſtified
by faith. In the Goſpel after Iohn;Ioh. 1. 12. &amp; 3. 15. &amp; 36. &amp; 47.
it is in ſundry places by expreſſe words
ſaide, that ſo many as beleeue on the name
of Chriſt, ſhalbe ſaued, ſhall haue life euerlaſting,
and ſhall neuer come into condemnation.
The Apoſtle Peter alſo
witneſſeth the ſame, ſaying: To him
(euen Ieſus Chriſt) geue the Prophets
witneſſe, that through his name all that
beleeue in him, ſhall receiue remiſsion of
ſinnes. In another place alſo Paul &amp;
Silas,Act. 10 43 to the ſame effect, ſaid to the Iailers
whom they conuerted.Act. 13. 31 
                  Beleeue in
the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and thou shalt be
ſaued. Alſo to the Romans out of the
prophet Abacuc.Rom. 1. 17
