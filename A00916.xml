            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

            THE PRINTER to the Reader.
            
               GENTLE READER, Albeit the Authour of this Worke designed the same to be printed, and published togeather with his Supplement to Fa. Persons his Discussion of M. Barlowes Answere &amp;c. by reason of the relation that the one hath to the other (in which respect also this is intituled an Adioynder:) neuertheles for as much as afterwards, when this came to my hands, I vnderstood that M. Barlowes credit was already quyte crushed with the Disscussion of Fa. Persons, and euery where so decried, that most men were fully satisfyed, concerning his ignorance, absurdity,

and folly, and therefore might be more desirous to see this Adioynder in Answere of M. Doctour Andrews (as well in respect of his farre greater reputation, as for that he hath not yet byn answered by any in our tongue:) And considering also that this Adioynder is growne to a farre greater volume, then the Author at the first intended, and that therefore many may desyre to haue it a part, both for the better cōmodity of carryage, and also for other good respects; yea, and that the separation thereof from the Supplement cannot hinder, but that such as desyre to haue them both, may easely be satisfyed, and cause them to be bound eyther togeather, or a sunder, as they shall best lyke; I therfore resolued, with the good leaue of the Authour, to print, &amp; publish them both in seuerall volumes.
            For although this Adioynder, hath indeed a great connexion with the Supplement, and in some sort dependeth thereon, (as being written only to iustifie the same, and specially concerning matters incident thereto:) yet the points treated therein

are so clearly handled, and discussed, that the truth of the Catholyke cause, and M. Andrewes his notable fraudes, and cauils, may sufficiently appeare thereby, without the helpe of the Supplement, notwithstanding the frequent references thereto.
            I shall not need to say any thing concerning the intention, and drift of the Authour, for that the same may fully be seene, partly by the titles of the Chapters which follow immediatly, and partly in the 3. first paragraphs of the first Chapter, and therefore all that I thinke good to aduertise thee, good Reader, is, that albeit this Authour hath not had eyther the occasion, or the intention to answere all M. Andrewes his Booke (but such points only, as are some way incidēt to the foresaid Supplement) neuertheles this Adioynder may serue for a sufficient answere to the whole, seeing it conteineth a confutation of at least an hundred Positions, Assertions, Paradoxes, Answeres, and Obiections of M. Andrewes; in all which he is proued to be eyther most Idle, and Impertinent, or egregiously fraudulent, and false, or els to argue directly

for the Catholikes, against the common doctrine of his owne fellows, whereby thou maist easily iudge of the rest of his Worke, and what a number of like frauds, and follies might be discouered therin, if the whole were as throughlie sifted, and examined as these points haue bene, which haue occurred to this Authour by the occasion of his Supplement. And so vvishing thee aboundance of Gods grace for the discouery of Falshood, and knovvledge of the Truth, to the euerlasting good of thy ovvne soule, I take my leaue.
         
         
            
            THE TABLE OF CHAPTERS.
            
               THE Authours intention is declared, and M. D. Andrews his interpretation of Pasce oues meas, examined, and confuted. Furthermore it is shewed, that he hath belyed S. Augustine, corrupted S. Ambrose, notably abused S. Cyril, vainely carped at a Law in the Code, and foolishly approued the vnlawfull proceeding of Iustinian the Emperour against the Pope. CHAP. I.
               
               
                  Pag. 1.
               
               The Answeres of M. Andrewes to certaine places of the Councell of Calcedon are examined, and con
                     •
                  uted. His notable fraud in  diuers things, and especially in the allegation of a Canon of that Councell is discouered: and the supreme authority of the Sea Apostolike clearely proued out of the same Councell and Canon. CHAP. II.
               
               
                  Pag. 39.
               
               
                  M. D. Andrewes his answeres to three places of the Fathers are  examined. And by the way the Cardinall is cleared from a false imputation of Iouinians heresie
                     •
                   and M. Andrewes truly charged therwith. Finally all that which we teach concerning the Popes authority, is necessarily deduced out of M. Andrewes his owne doctrine and expresse wordes. CHAP. III.
               
               
                  Pag. 98.
               
               Foure other places of the Fathers are debated, and M. Andrewes his Answeres therto confuted. VVith a Discouery of notable corruption &amp;  falsity in him: and of three manifest lyes within little more then three lines. And by occasion therof, it is also proued, that 8. Popes who liued in S. Augustines time, had, and excercised an vniuersall and supreme Authority. CHAP. IIII.
               
               
                  Pag. 133.
               
               
                  M. Andrewes his answeres to three other places, alleadged by the  Cardinall out of the Fathers, are examined and confuted, and diuers, absurdities discouered therin. And finally he is proued to be a wrangler in the highest degree. CHAP. V.
               
               
                  pag. 193.
               
               A further manifestation of M. Andrewes his trifling, wrangling, and fraudulent humour, by his Answeres to other places of the Fathers, concerning Prayer to Saintes, which he deuideth into

three ranks, wherof the two first are examined in this Chapter. CHAP. VI.
               
               
                  Pag. 218.
               
               
                   The Answeres of M. Andrewes to the Fathers of the third ranke, are examined, and sound to be either impertinent, fraudulent, or most iniurious to them; namely to S. Ambrose, whom he most egregiously abuseth. Also it is euidently shewed, that the Inuocation of Saints was generally practised, &amp; approued aswell by the ancient Fathers, as by all other faithfull Christians, in the Primitiue Church. CHAP. VII.
               
               
                  Pag. 258.
               
               
                   Certaine obiections of M. Andrewes against Prayers to Saints are answered, and by the way, an imposture of the pretended Bishops, and Clergy of the Prouince of Canterbury in a Synodicall Canon of theirs is discouered. And finally M. Andrews is proued to haue notably wrangled, iugled, and trifled throughout this whole Controuersy. CHAP. VIII.
               
               
                  Pag. 306.
               
               
                   The Conclusion of this Adioynder, deuided into two Chapters. In this are detected diuers srauds and shifts common to M. Andrewes with M. Barlow; as to change the state of the question, dissemble that which most importeth in the Cardinalls text and argument; to abuse wrest, bely and falsisy not only the Cardinall, but also the ancient Fathers, Councells, and holy Scriptures: and finally to face out matters impudently for lack of proofes. CHAP. IX.
               
               
                  Pag. 361.
               
               
                   That M. Andrews ouerthroweth his owne cause, and fortifieth ours, graunting many important points of Catholike Religion: That he is turned Puritan in the point of the Kings Ecclesiasticall Supremacy. and betrayeth his Maiesties cause vnder-hand, pretending to defend it: and therfore is neither good English Protestant, nor yet good Subiect. Lastly what is the opinion of learned strangers concerning him, and his booke: with a good aduise for a friendly farewell. CHAP. X.
               
               
                  Pag. 329.
               
               An Appendix touching a Register alleaged by M. Franc. Mason for the lawfull Ordayning of Protestant Bishops in Q. Elizabeths Raigne.
               
            
         
      
      
         
            
            THE AVTHORS INTENTION IS DECLARED, AND M. D. Andrewes his interpretation of Pasce oues meas, examined, and confuted. FVRTHERMORE It is shewed, that he hath belyed S. Augustine, corrupted S. Ambrose, notably abused S. Cyril, vainly carped at a law in the Code, &amp; foolishly approued the vnlawfull proceeding of Iustinian the Emperour against two Popes.
            CHAP. I.
            
               WHEN I had well-neere ended my Supplement, and already sent away the greatest part of it to the print, it was my chance to haue a sight of M. D. Andrewes his Answere to Cardinall Bellarmines Apology; and considering that the subiect thereof was in effect the same

that Father Persons,
               The reason that moued the Author to adde this Adioynder to the former Suplemēt. and I had handled, and debated with M. Barlow; I easily perswaded my selfe that I should find many things treated by M. Andrewes, which I had touched in my Supplement. In which respect I determined to take a speedy Suruey of his worke; and finding that he pretended now and then to answere some places, authorities, and arguments which had bene obiected, as well by me, as by the Cardinall, I resolued to examine, and confute his Answers, in respect not only of my selfe, but also of the most Worthy Cardinall; not for that I thinke he needeth any defence, (who like an inexpugnable fortresse trenched on euery side, and fortified with bulwarks of truth, doth of himselfe sufficiently resist the assaults, and daunt both the courage and force of his enemies) but that in discharge of the obligation which all true Christians owe him, for his singular merits towards the Church of Christ, I may for my part, out of my pouerty, pay with the poore widdow, my two mytes; and therfore hauing offered one of them in my Supplement, I thinke good now to add the other; and the rather, for that I hope by the same meanes to preuent the Cauills of my Aduersary M. Barlow, who otherwise might perhaps in his reply (if he be disposed to make any) blame me, for not taking notice of such a worthy work (as that of M. Andrewes) and eyther turne me ouer to him for satisfaction touching those points, or els make vse of his answers himselfe; which being esteemed as a precious fruite of the fine wit and curious pen of the greatest Rabbin in the English Synagogue, are held (no doubt) by his friends, and followers for no other then oracles of Apollo, I meane, both infallible and irrefragable: for which cause I am the more willing to enter

into the examination of them. And therefore to the end thou mayst,The Authors intention in this Adioynder.
                
               good Reader, know how far I meane to proceed therin, thou shalt vnderstād, that seeing my Supplement is already vnder the presse, and that I haue no more tyme to bestow on this Adioynder, but vntill the said Supplement be printed, I make account, that I shall haue opportunity to handle but a few points: in which respect I think good, to make choyce of such only as concerne some of the most important matters, cō
               trouersed betwixt M. Barlow, &amp; me, not doubting but that the same shall suffice to shew ex vngue Leonem, that is, to giue the Reader an aboundant tast and tryall of M. Andrews his good spirit, and sincerity in the defence of his cause.
            1. Well then to come to the matter. For as much as one of the chiefest points debated in my Supplement
               What question is specially handled in this Adioynder.
                (by occasion of the new Oath) is the question concerning the supreme and vniuersall Authority of the Apostolike Roman Sea (which authority I deduced specially from the Pastorall commission giuen by our Sauiour to S. Peter) I thinke good to examine of what worth,
                  Supplemēt chap. 1. nu. 58.59. &amp; seq.
                and weight M. Andrewes his Answeres are touching the same, especially in his 16. &amp; 17. page, where he laboureth seriously to proue three wayes against Cardinall Bellarmine, that our Sauiours words to S. Peter,
               
                  D. Andr. Respons. ad Apolog. ca. 1. pag. 16. 
               Pasce oues meas (alleaged, and learnedly vrged by the Cardinall) do make nothing for vs.
            2. First, he saith, that S. Augustine affirmeth that S. Peter had no peculiar increase by the word Pasce, and that S. Ambrose affirmeth the like of the words oues meas. And to the end that this may appeare, he pretendeth to lay downe the very words of those two Fathers.
                  Aug. de Agon. Christ. c. 30. Of S. Augustine thus; Cùm Petro dicitur, ad omnes

dicitur,
               
                  Ambros. de sacerd. dignitate cap. 20. 
               Pasce oues meas: when it is said to Peter, it is said to all, Feed my sheep. Of S. Ambrose thus: Eas oues non solùm Beatus suscepit Petrus, sed &amp; nobiscum eas suscepit, &amp; nos cum illo accepimus omnes. Those sheep not only the blessed Peter receaued, but also he receaued them with vs, and we all receaued them with him. And then M. Andrewes addeth: Nempe dictum illi Pasce &amp;c. for it was said vnto him, Feed, as well in the person of others, as in his owne, at
                  
                     
                  
                  que
                vel sic iacebit Cardinali ratio sua: and so shall the Cardinalls reason serue him to no purpose. Thus argueth he.
            3. But to the end, thou maist (good Reader) see, and note with what fidelity and conscience this man alledgeth the Fathers, I will lay downe the place of S. Augustine somewhat more amply then he hath done,S. Augustine lamely and fraudulētly alledged by M. Andrews. whereby thou shalt easily discouer his notable fraud. S. Augustine in the place alledged by him saith thus: Non enim sine causa inter omnes Apostolos &amp;c. For not without cause doth Peter sustayne the person of the Catholike Church amongst all the Apostles, for to this Church the keyes of the Kingdome of heauen were giuen, when they were giuen to Peter,
               
                  August. vbi supra.
                
               and when it is said to him, Doest thou loue me? Feed my sheep, it is said to all, and therefore the Catholick Church ought willingly to pardon her Children when they are corrected, and strengthned in piety, seeing we see, that to Peter himselfe, bearing the person of the Church, pardon was granted both when he had doubted vpon the sea &amp;c. and when he had thrice denyed his Maister &amp;c. Thus saith S. Augustine, declaring that Pasce oues (which our Sauiour said to S. Peter) was said to all the Church, because S. Peter bare the person of the Church: Which he did, by reason of the supreme authority that he had ouer the Church.
            4. For else why should rather he, then others of

the Apostles be said to represent the whole Church, but because he was Head or supreme Gouernour therof;
                  Cic. offic. l. 1. which we may learne euen in Cicero,
               How S. Peter did beare the person of the Church when he receaued the keyes. who saith that, Est proprium munus Magistratus &amp;c. It is the proper office or duty, of the Magistrate, to vnderstand that he beareth the person of the Citty. So he; speaking of the chiefe or supreme Magistrate: wherby it appeareth, that whatsoeuer is giuen to the King, as King, and Head of the Common-wealth, the same is giuen to the Common-wealth, wherof he beareth and representeth the person: and so in like manner what was giuen to S. Peter as Head of the Church, the same was giuen to the Church which he representeth. For which cause also S. Cyprian saith, that Ecclesia est in Episcopo, the Church is in the Bishop; and the reason is, because the Bishop is Head of the Church; &amp; as this is true in euery particuler Bishop, in respect of the particuler Church which he gouerneth. So also is it most truly verified in the supreme and vniuersall Pastour, in respect of the whole Church whereof he is Head.
            5. That this was S. Augustines meaning, it is euident by his owne doctrine in other places,S. Augustines meaning declared out of his owne doctrine. where he sheweth plainly, that S. Peter bare the person of figure of the Church, in respect of his Primacy: Cuius Ecclesia, saith he, Petrus Apostolus propter Apostolatus sui primatum gerebat figurata generalitate personam &amp;c. Of which Church Peter in respect of the primacy of his Apostleship, did beare the person,
               
                  Tract. vlt. in Ioan.
                
               figuring, or representing the generality therof. For if we respect what did belong properly to himselfe, he was by nature one man, by grace one Christian, and by a more aboundant grace, vnus, idem
                  
                     
                  
                  que
                primus Apostolus, one, &amp; he the chiefe Apostle: but when it was said vnto him, Tibi dabo claues, I will giue thee the keyes &amp;c. he signified the

vniuersall Church. Thus saith S. Augustine, teaching euidently, that S. Peter bare the person of the Church, by reason of the Primacy of his Apostleship, that is to say, because he was the chiefe Apostle; which the same holy Father signifieth also more plainly in another place, saying,
                  Idem in Ps. 108. 
               Cuius Ecclesiae ille agnoscitur gessisse personā propter Primatum quem in Discipulis habuit: Of which Church he is acknowledged to haue borne the person for the Primacy, which he had amōgst the Disciples. And to the same purpose he saith also elswhere,
                  Idem ser. 13. de verb. Dom.
                
               Petrus à petra cognominatus &amp;c. Peter taking his name from a Rock, was happy, bearing the figure of the Church, hauing the principality of the Apostleship.
            
            6. Loe then, for what cause S. Augustine said, that when Christ gaue to S. Peter the keyes of heauen &amp; pastorall authority to feed his sheep,M. Andrewes fraud against the intention of S. Augustine. he gaue the same to all the Church, to wit, because S. Peter hauing the principality, or primacy of the Apostolicall dignity (and being consequently chiefe Pastor, and head of the Church) did beare, and represent the person, or figure of the whole Church. So that you see the place which M. Andrewes bringeth out of S. Augustine against the Primacy of S. Peter, maketh notably for it, if it be considered with the circumstances therof, which he cunningly, and craftily concealed. But in the other place which he citeth out of S. Ambrose, he is more fraudulent, hauing plainly corrupted the text, which as it is in S. Ambrose, is very conforme to this doctrine of S. Augustine, signifying nothing else but that all the lawfull Pastors in Gods Church,
                  S. Ambr. de Sacerd. dignit. c 1. receaued their Pastorall authority ouer their flocks, with S. Peter: and therfore he saith, Quas oues, &amp; quem gregem non solùm tunc Beatus Petrus suscepit, sed &amp; cum, illo eas nos suscepimus omnes: Which sheep, and which flock not only the Blessed Peter then receaued, but as so

we all receaued them with him. Thus saith S. Ambrose, which all Catholikes do graunt and teach in like mā
               ner, because (as I haue said) S. Peter representing the person of the whole Church (wherof he was head) receaued not that Pastorall authority for himselfe alone, but also for the Church.
            7. In which respect S. Ambrose saith very well,The meaning of S. Ambrose declared. that all the Pastors of the Church receaued their authority with him, though not in equall degree (as M. Andrews would haue it) who therfore bodgeth into S. Ambrose his text, these words of his owne, Et nobiscum eas suscepit: and he (that is to say S. Peter) receaued those sheep with vs; as if S. Ambrose should meane, that S. Peter had no prerogatiue in that point, but that he and other Pastors receaued them all alike, he with them, &amp; they with him; for to that purpose doth M. Andrewes also alledge the words of S. Ambrose afterwards, in a different letter thus:
                  Andr. ca. 3. pag. 74. § Verum 
               Et ille nobis
                     •
                  um, &amp; nos cum illo oues illas pascendas suscepimus, which manner of speach doth indeed inforce a greater equality betwixt S. Peter, and other Pastors, then the true words of S. Ambrose do import, or then he euer did imagine, who taught expresly elswhere the Primacy of S. Peter, not only aboue all other inferiour Pastors, but also aboue the Apostles themselues, saying,
                  Ambr. in 2. Cor. 12. that albeit Andrew was called before Peter, yet Primatum non accepit Andraeas, sed Petrus: Andrew did not receaue the Primacy, but Peter: yea, &amp; in another place he proueth it by these very words of our Sauiour, which are now in question, to wit, P
                     •
                  sce oues meas.
            
            8. For hauing said, that our Sauiour asked Peter thrice whether he loued him (not to learne,
               
                  Idē lib. 10. cōment. in cap. 24. Euāg. Luc.
                saith he, any thing of him, but to teach him, whom he meant to leaue to vs, velut amoris sui Vicarium, as the Vicar of his loue) he

alleageth our Sauiours words to S. Peter,
               S. Ambrose proueth S. Peters Supremacy out of the wordes Pasce oues meas.
                to wit, Simon the sonne of Iohn, doest thou loue me &amp;c. Pasce agnos meos, feed my Lambes, and then shortly after he inferreth thereupon thus, Et ideo quia solus profitetur ex omnibus, omnibus antefertur; and therefore because he alone of all the rest professed his loue, he is preferred before them all: and after a whyle he concludeth, that our Lord asked him the third tyme, whether he loued him: Et iam, saith he, non agnos, vt primò, quodam lacte p
                     •
                  scendos &amp;c. And now Peter is commaunded, not to feed Lambs with a certayne milke, as the first time, nor to feed the little sheep, as the second tyme, but, oues pascere iubetur; perfectiores, vt perfectior gubernaret, he is commaunded to feed the sheep; to the end that he being more perfect, might gouerne the more perfect. Thus saith S. Ambrose.
            
            9. Wherein it is to be noted that he teacheth 3. things:Three things taught by S. Ambrose. The first that our Sauiour left S. Peter vnto vs, as the Vicar, or Substitute of his loue, that is to say to succeed him in that fatherly loue, &amp; care of his Church which he himselfe had; the second, that when our Sauiour gaue to S. Peter the Pastorall commission, and authority to feed his Lambs, and sheep, he preferred him therin before all the rest of the Apostles; Quia solus (saith S. Ambrose) profitetur ex omnibus, omnibus antefertur: The third is, that wheras S. Ambrose obserueth three degrees of Christians, to wit Lambs, litle sheep, and sheep, all recommended to the Pastorall care of S. Peter, he giueth to vnderstand, that all sorts of Christians were committed to his charge, and gouernment, and not the weake only, but the most holy also, learned, and perfect, yea euen the Apostles themselues, and therefore he saith: vt perfectiores perfectior gubernaret.
            
            10. This then being S. Ambrose his sense, and

doctrine concerning the Pastorall cōmission giuen to S. Peter, it is most euident, that when he teacheth that all Pastours receaued their flocks with S. Peter, he teacheth it in the same sense that S. Augustine doth, to wit, that because S. Peter (being supreme Pastour) represented the whole Church, and receaued the Pastorall authority not for himselfe alone, but also for all those who were eyther at that tyme, or euer should be subordinate vnto him,D. Andrews can help the dyce whē he is put to his shifts. therefore all other Pastours receaued their authority not only in him (as S. Augustine speaketh) but also with him, that is to say, in, and with their chiefe Pastour, and head. And therefore, whereas D. Andrews, to make a greater shew of parity, or equality betwixt S. Peter, and other Pastors, hath added to S. Ambrose his text those words of his owne, &amp; nobiscum eas accepit, it may passe for a piece of coggery, and well discouereth his skill to help the dyce when he is put to his shifts.
            11. Besids that, his vanity and folly notably appeareth, in that hauing gayned nothing,A vayne. brag of D. Andrews. but rather lost his cause by alledging these two places of S. Augustine, and S. Ambrose, yet he braggeth thereof afterwards, as if he had got a great victory, saying in the 214. page that although,
                  Andr. cap. 8. pag. 214. &amp; 215. 
               pasce oues, was said in the singuler number, and to one (to wit S. Peter) yet it passed to all, and that clariùs id loquuntur Ambrosius &amp; Augustinus, quàm vt obstrepere possint nouitij nostri. Ambrose, and Augustine do speake (or affirme) it more plainly, then that our nouices can any way contradict it. So he; meaning by our nouices, the Catholiks, as I take it, though I know not why he so calleth them, neyther do I meane heere to discusse it, but will remit to the indifferent Reader to iudge, what cause he hath so to brag of these two Fathers,

and what fidelity he hath shewed in alledging them, dissembling the cleare doctrine of the one, and corrupting as well the text, as the sense of the other: and thus much for his first answere.
            12. In his second, he seeketh to retort the Cardinals argument vpon him,The secōd argument &amp; answer of M. Andrews which he taketh to be so sharp that it will prick the Cardinall. and to proue the Kings Supremacy by the word, pasce, which he saith he knoweth will touch the Cardinall to the quick: quod scio, saith he, punget Cardinalem. Let vs heare then this sharp argument which I thinke will proue a very blunt one. Thus then he saith: Negat Cardinalis Primatum Regis &amp;c. The Cardinall denieth the Kings Supremacy, and yet God said to a King, tu pasces populum meum Israel, thou shalt feed my people Israel: Where no man can deny, but that a King was made the Pastor of all Israel,
               
                  Andr. c. 1. pag. 16. §. Verū vim videamꝰ. 
               yea of the Priests, except he will deny them to be part of Israel. Thus argueth this learned and sharp Doctor, ouerthrowing his owne argument sufficiently by his owne conclusion, graunting in effect, that if the Priests were not a part of the people of Israel, the King was not their Pastor.
            
            13. To this purpose then, it is to be considered what I haue amply debated in the first Chapter of my Supplement,
                  See Suppl. Chap. 1. n. 18.19. &amp; sequ.
                concerning the exemption, and sepation of the Priests and Leuits from the temporall, and politike State, by the expresse words of Almighty God who gaue the Leuits (not to the temporall Prince,
                  Num. c. 8. but) to Aaron and his children, tradidi eos dono Aaron, &amp; filijs eius de medio populi, I haue giuen them (saith Almighty God) for a gift to Aaron and his children, out of the midst of the people. Besides, that God ordayned expresly that the Tribe of Leui should not be numbred,
               
                  Num. 1. neither yet haue any part, or inheritance with the rest of Israel, because he had reserued the same for his owne

seruice, and therfore would himselfe be their possession,
               
                  Deut. 10. &amp; 18. 
               portion, and inheritance. So that this being very cleare in the expresse words of the Law,
                  Supplem. c. 1. n. 22.23. &amp; 24. (which, as I also proued, was neuer altered but rather confirmed at the institution of the Kings, who were expresly bound to obserue the whole law, and to obey the high Preist) I may say to the Doctor, as he said before to the Cardinall, at
                     
                        
                     
                     que
                   vel sic iacebit Doctori ratio sua.
            
            14. But put the case this were not so, yea and that the Preists of the old law had byn subiect to the Kings in spirituall matters (wherof I haue already proued the contrary) will M. Andrews inferre theron,
                  Suppl. cap. 1. vbi supr.
                that therfore Kings haue also the spirituall Supremacy in the new law, without any new institution, or ratification therof by our Sauiour Christ,
               In what case Christiās may ground vpon the law of Moyses. or his Apostles? Doth not this great Doctor know, that the Mosaycal law was abrogated by the law of grace, and that wheras it was deuided into three parts (to wit, Iudiciall, Cerimoniall, and Morall) the two former vtterly ceased, and the third (I meane the Morall part, contayning the Commaundements) remayneth only in force, not because it was instituted then, but because those Commaundments being grounded on the law of Nature, are alwayes in force, and therfore ordayned againe to be kept in the new Law. In which respect the cōmandment cōcerning the Sabboth, doth not now bynd Christians, as it was then ordayned and practiced.
            15. And therfore M. Andrews might aswell introduce Poligamy practised in the old Law, as the spirituall supremacy of Kings (if we should graunt that they then had any such) and with much more reason might he teach abstinence from puddings, and other meates made of bloud; seeing that we find some commaundements,

or ordinance therof, in the Acts of Apostles, wheras there is no one syllable in all the new Testament,M. Andrews his beggarly proofe for a temporal princes spirituall Supremacy. to proue that Kings haue any spirituall authority ouer the Church; it being most euidēt that al those places of Scripture, which he or any other doth, or can alledge out of the new Testament to that purpose, do concerne only temporall obedience to the pagan Emperours, or Princes, who were then Persecutors of the Church, and therefore could not be spirituall heads or Gouernours thereof, nor obayed by Christians in spirituall matters. And this I say the rather, because M. Andrews doth not only heere, but also throughout his whole booke, seeme to ground his doctrine of the Kings spirituall Primacy, specially vpon the law of Moyses (as I shall haue occasion to shew further hereafter) which sufficiently bewrayeth the beggery and misery of his cause,
                  See infra. cap. 6. and his want of proofes for the same by the law of Christ.
            16. And although as well the ancient Fathers, as we, do ordinarily produce testimonies of the old Testament, not only for matters in controuersy, but also for instruction in matters of morality, yet neyther they, nor we euer do it, to other end, but to confirme things instituted, and taught in the new law, by the ordinance, and commaundment eyther of Christ, or of his spouse the Church;M. Andrews proofes of the temporall Princes supremacy, sauour of Iudaisme. and this we do only in respect of the conformity that is in many things betwixt the figure, and the Verity (I meane betwixt the old law, and the new, Moyses, and our Sauiour Christ, the Synagogue, and the Church) and not to the end to proue any thing to be necessary now, because it was ordayned, or practised then; which were rather a point of Iudaisme, then of Christianisme. And therefore this and

other arguments of M. Andrews grounded only vpon the Iudicial lawes of Moyses, may shew him to be rather a Iew then a Christian, except he can bring some other ground for the same out of the new Testament, or some Apostolicall, or Ecclesiasticall Canon or Tradition; which he neyther doth, nor euer shall be able to do.
            17. But who seeth not, how he tryfleth in this point, as cōmonly he doth in all? For how doth it follow, that if it be true which we teach (to wit, that Christ made S. Peter supreme Pastour of the Church by cōmaunding him to feed his sheep) then he gaue the same spirituall authority to Dauid, when he bad him feed his people of Israel?
               2. Reg. 5. Is it not manifest, that although the word pasce, feed, as it was spoken to them both, doth signifie to gouerne,
               D. Andrews doth equiuocate egregiously. yet it is Equiuocall, being to be vnderstood of a different manner of gouernment in them both, that is to say, in the one spirituall, and in the other temporall? what consequence then can he draw from the one to the other, except it be this, that as when God bad Dauid (who as a temporall man) to feed his people of Israell (which was a temporall people) he gaue him temporall authority, making him head of a temporall Kingdome? So when he bad S. Peter (who was a spirituall man, a Priest, an Apostle, and Prince of the Apostles) feed his sheep (that is to say) all the faithfull conteyned within his Sheepfold (which is a spirituall congregation) he gaue him a spirituall authority, and made him supreme Pastor, and head of a spirituall Kingdome, that is to say, of his Church. And this no doubt is the most direct inference that can be made of the word Pasce, when it is applied in the old Testament eyther to Dauid (if we respect him, as he

was a King, and not a Prophet) or else to any other temporall Prince.
            18. And therfore whereas M. Andrewes saith, Narro autem Cardinali &amp;c. I declare to the Cardinall that the tytle of Pastor was giuen in the holy Scriptures to Princes long before it was giuen to the Bishop,
               
                  Andr. vbi supra.
                
               and much more often, as to Iosue before, and more often euery where in the holy-history, and in the Prophets. This his narration, I say, is very idle,D. Andrews argueth impertinently. and impertinent, seeing it proueth not any thing which we deny, but that which we willingly graunt, to wit, that the words Pascere, and Pastor, are often applyed in the old Testament to temporall Princes; but that they signify spirituall gouernment in them as Kings, M. Andrews will not proue in hast, and the contrary is manifest inough in Cyrus a Pagan,
                  Isa. 44. and Idolatrous King, whome God called Pastormeus, and no man I thinke will be so absurd to imagine that he had any Ecclesiasticall authority, or was Head, and chiefe member of Gods Church, wherof he was no member at all: besides, that the example which he giueth vs of Iosue out of the booke of Numbers doth not any way help his cause, but flatly confound him.
            
               
                  Num. 27.19. For albeit in the Chapter which he quoteth, to wit the 27 it is declared that God commaunded Moyses to assigne and ordaine Iosue for his Successour in the gouernmēt of the people (least they should be like to oues sine Pastore,
               D. Andrews cō
                  founded by an instance of his owne. sheep without a Sheepheard) yet it is euident there, that he was not to haue any authority ouer the High Priest, but rather the cleane contrary, to wit, that he should depend wholy vpon the High Priests direction; and therfore wheras Moyses was commaunded there by almighty God to giue part of his glory to Iosue, Theodoretus doth very well obserue (as I haue

noted before in the Supplement) that Moyses did distribute his dignity,
                  Theodor. quast. 48. in Num. See Suppl. nu. 21. and authority (which was both spirituall, and temporall) betwixt Iosue and Eleazar the High Priest, yet in such sort, that Iosue should be directed in al his affaires by Eleazar, Pro hoc, saith the Scripture, si quid agendum erit &amp;c.
                  Num. 27. 
               For him (that is to say Iosue) if any thing be to be done, Eleazar shall consult the Lord, and at his word, he (to wit Iosue) shall go out, and in, and all the children of Israel with him, and all the rest of the multitude. Thus saith the holy Scripture, wherby it appeareth that albeit Iosue was Pastor populi,
               M. Andrews pricking argument doth wound none but himselfe. yet he was but a temporall Pastor, or Gouernour, and to be directed euen in temporall affaires by the spirituall Pastor Eleazar, whome Almighty God did illuminate and instruct in his consultations, for the direction of Iosue. Now then, doth this example prick Cardinal Bellarmine trow you, or M. Andrews? Truely though he meant to prick the Cardinall, yet you see, he hath wounded none but himselfe.The third answere of D. Andrews examined. Thus much to his second answere.
            20. His third is in substance, that albeit S. Augustine, and S. Cyril haue amply cōmented vpon the Ghospell of S. Iohn, and vpon those very words of our Sauiour to S. Peter, Pasce oues meas, yet neyther of them (saith he) saw, illustrem hunc fidei articulum de primatu Petri temporali,
               
                  Andr. vbi supra pag. 17. lin. 4. 
               this notable article of faith concerning the temporall primacy of Peter &amp;c. So he. As if the Cardinal did teach, or affirme, that S. Peters primacy is a temporall primacy; which is a meere fiction of M. Andrews to frame matter for himselfe to impugne; for seeing the spirituall primacy of S Peter is so euident in the holy Scriptures, that he is now &amp; then forced to graūt it in some sort, yea 
                  See after c. 3. n. 36.37. &amp; seq.
                somtimes as far forth in effect as we demaūd; though at at other times he laboureth vtterly to ouerthrow it (as I

                  Cap. 5. n. 18.19.20. her after) he wil now needs presuppose that we teach the Popes Primacy to be a temporall primacy, &amp; why forsooth? Marry because the Cardinal, as also all the Catholiks do teach, that the spirituall authority which our Sauiour gaue S. Peter, and his Successors, may, and doth in some cases extend it selfe to temporall things, so far forth, as it is, or may be necessary for the execution of their spirituall power, and for the benefit of soules, the publike good of the Church, and gods glory, wherof I haue giuen sufficient reason in the first Chapter of my 
                  Supplement cap. 1. nu. 59. &amp; sequent.
                Supplement.
            21. Therefore I will only say for the present, that if the Popes spirituall Primacy may for this cause be called a temporall primacy,
               If the Popes primacy be a temporall Primacy, M. Andrews is a pecuniary Pastour. then may M. Andrews (who taketh himselfe to be a Bishop, and a spirituall Pastour) be iustly called, and nicknamed a corporall Bishop, and a pecuniary Pastour, because he doth punish men sometymes in his spirituall court, not only in their bodyes, but also in their purses: and if he would thinke him absurd, who should so style, and intytle him, he is no lesse absurd himselfe in calling the Popes Primacy, for the like reason, a temporall Primacy. And although neither S. Augustine, nor S. Cyril, do in the places cyted by M. Andrews speake of any such extension of spirituall power to temporall matters (whereof they had no occasion to treate) yet it sufficeth that they do not deny it, yea and that they do both of them sufficiently teach there, the spirituall Primacy of S. Peter, wherof the other is a necessary consequent.
            22. S. Augustine in that very Treatise (wherto M. Andrews appealeth, I meane vpon the Ghospell of S. Iohn, and the last Chapter) hath that expresse doctrine,

and those very words which I cyted a little before,S. Augustine acknowledgeth S. Peters supremacy in the place alleadged by M. Andrews. concerning the person, and figure of the whole Church, represented in S. Peter, propter Apostolatus sui Primatum, by reason of the Primacy of his Apostleship (or as he saith els where) propter Primatum quem in discipulis habuit, for the Primacy which he had amongst the Disciples. For which cause he called him also twice in the same place, primum Apostolorum, the chiefe Apostle, and saith, that the Church receaued the keyes in him, which as I haue shewed doth euidently proue him to be head and supreme Pastour of the Church,
                  S. August. Tract. 124. in Euang. Ioan. Idem. in psal. 108. whereof only he, and no other of the Apostles is said to represent the person, and figure; so that S. Augustine sufficiently acknowledgeth S. Peters spirituall Supremacy in the place alledged by M. Andrewes.
            
            23. The like doth S. Cyril also in his cōmentary vpon S. Iohns Ghospell,
               
                  S. Cyril cō
                     ment. in Cap. vlt. Ioan.
                and in the same place which M. Andrewes cyteth, for there he calleth S. Peter expressely Prince, and head of the Apostles, saying: Vt Princeps Caput
                     
                        
                     
                     que
                   ceterorum primus exclamauit, Tu es Christus filius Dei viui:
               S. Cyril also acknowledgeth S. Peters supremacy in the place which M. Andrews alleadgeth 
               Peter as Prince, and head of the rest, first exclaymed, Thou art Christ the Sonne of the liuing God. So he: wherby he teacheth euidently, that S. Peter was head, and supreme Pastour of the Church, in that he acknowledgeth him to be Prince, and head of the Apostles, who were the chiefe Magistrates, and Pastors therof; and therefore it is to be considered, how this agreeth with that which followeth presently after in M. Andrews his text, who hauing affirmed as you haue heard, that neyther of these Fathers saw the article touching Peters temporall Primacy,
               
                  Andr. vbi supra.
                addeth, 
                  Id tantum vident, nec praeterea quid, quia &amp;c. They see this only and nothing els, that because Peter had denyed his Lord not once, but thrice

he was asked concerning loue, not once but thrice, and so when he had abolished his triple negation, with his triple confession, he was restored to the place or degree of Apostleship, from the which he was fallen: for touching the Primacy they are altogeather silent.
Thus saith M. Andrews.
            
            24. Wherin it is to be noted, that wheras he saith, that these Fathers saw only this, which he heere setteth downe, nec praeterea quid, and nothing else, it is euidently false, for two respects; the one, for that they saw more then he mentioneth, yea more then he listed to see, to wit, the Primacy of S. Peter, as I haue shewed out of them both; the other is, because they saw not that which he affirmeth in their behalfe, I meane, that S. Peter was by those wordes of our Sauiour restored to his place in the Apostleship which he had lost; for if they should haue said so,M. Andrews maketh S. Augustin &amp; S. Cyril fauour a pernicious heresy. they should seeme to hould (or fauour at least) the pernicious heresy of Wycliffe, that Magistrates loose their dignity, and authority by mortall sinne, which pestiferous opinion, those holy Fathers, no doubt, would haue abhorred, if it had bene set abroach, or taught by any in their tyme; seeing that it shaketh the very foundation of all obedience eyther to Ciuill, or Ecclesiasticall Magistrates; because it doth not only make all obedience vncertaine (for no man knoweth who is in the state of Grace) but also giueth occasion to Subiects vpon euery offence of their Prince to call his authority in question.
            25. Therfore to the end thou maist, good Reader, know as wel the integrity of these Fathers in this point,S. Augustine belyed by D. Andrews. as M. Andrews his fraud, and bad conscience in alledging them, thou shalt vnderstand that S. Augustine saith nothing at all, that may be so much as wrested to any

such sense in that place,
                  Aug. Ep. 50. and doth elswhere expressely teach the contrary, as when he saith: Sanctus Dauid de criminibus mortiferis &amp;c. Holy Dauid did pennance for mortall sinnes, and yet remayned in his honour, or dignity: and when blessed Peter shed most bitter teares, he repented that he had denied his Lord, and yet remained an Apostle
               
                  •
                (&amp; againe a little after) when Peter the Apostle denied our Sauiour, and wept, and remayned still an Apostle, he had not yet receaued the holy Ghost. Thus saith S. Augustine; and could he teach a doctrine more contrary to that which M. Andrews fat
                  •
               ereth vpon him?
            26. Let vs now see how he handleth S. Cyril,
               S. Cyril notably abused by M. Andrews. vpō whome it may be he principally relyeth for this matter; for indeed that holy Father saith somewhat concerning the same, though far otherwise then M. Andrews would make his Reader belieue, for thus saith S. Cyril:
               
                  Cyril vbi supra.
                
               Dixit, pasce agnos meos, Apostolatus sibi renouās dignitatem, ne propter negationem quae humana infirmitate accidit labefactata videretur. He (to wit our Sauiour) said (to Peter) feed my Lambs, renewing to him his dignity of the Apostleship, least it might seeme to haue bene decayed by his denyall, which happened by humane infirmity. Thus far S. Cyril; who you see, neyther saith, nor meaneth that S. Peter fell from his Apostleship by his denyall of Christ, but rather signifieth the contrary, to wit, that Christ would not haue it so much as to seeme, or be supposed, that he had lost his dignity by his fall, and therefore renewed it by that new, and expresse commission, ne labefactata videretur, lest it should seeme to haue bene decayed, or lost.
            
            27. Wherin also it is to be obserued, that the dignity wherof S. Cyril speaketh, was not the bare office, or degree of an Apostle, but that which was peculiar, and proper to S. Peter, and so acknowledged by S. Cyril himselfe

a little before in the same Chapter, when he tearmed him Principem, &amp; Caput ceterorum, the Prince and head of the rest of the Apostles, as also S. Augustine (as you haue heard) calleth it Primatum &amp; principatum Apostolatus, the Primacy and principality of the Apostleship, and therefore I say, the Dignity which according to S. Cyrils doctrine our Sauiour renewed in S. Peter, was his Primacy, and Soueraignty in Gods Church, and the renouation thereof was a confirmation, or rather an increase of it, as of a thing which he had neuer lost, and being then renewed, was made more eminent then before. But perhaps some will say, that M. Andrews doth not here plainly affirme as his owne opinion, that S. Peter fell from the Apostleship, but relateth the doctrine of S. Augustine and S. Cyril, who seemed to him so to say. Therfore let vs heare what he saith himselfe in another place concerning the same.
            
               
                  Andr. pag 215. §. No
                        •
                      vero.
               28. 
                  Pasce oues, saith he, expressè faternur vni dictum &amp;c. we confesse expresly that pasce oues was said to one, yea thryce said to one, because he had thrice denied, atque ea voce muneri restitutum &amp;c: and that he (to wit Peter) was by that word, or speach restored to his charge, and not constituted, or appoynted in a charge aboue others.
So he, shewing euidently, that his opinion is,M. Andrews worthily suspected to hold that Magistrats fall from their dignity by mortal sinnes. that S. Peter lost his office, and authority by his fall, and that he was restored thereto by those words of our Sauiour: which, as I haue said, sauoureth greatly of that damnable and pernicious heresy, whereof I haue spoken before except he can tell vs (which he shall neuer be able to do) how, and why S. Peter (rather then all other men) lost his place, and office by his fall, which (though it was most grieuous) yet proceeded not of any infidelity, heresy, or malice, but (as S. Cyril
               
well noteth, and no man I thinke doubteth of it) contigit humana infirmitate, hapned by humane frailty; so that if he lost his dignity thereby, the like must needs be thought of others in like fraylties, and much more in cases of more greiuous, and malicious sinnes, which would be an euident confirmation of Wickliffs Heresy.
            29. But howsoeuer M. Andrews shall be able to purge himselfe of this suspition, it cannot be denied but that he hath most impudently abused and belyed both S. Augustine and S. Cyril, in making them affirme, that S. Peter fell from his Apostleship by his denyall of Christ, whereof the contrary is clearely gathered out of S. Cyrils owne words, and expressely taught by S. Augustine, as you haue heard before, which may also be confirmed by the testimony of the other S. Cyril Bishop of Hierusalem, and of Optatus Mile
                     •
                  itanus, who do both of them, not only teach in expresse words, that S. Peter did not loose his Apostleship by his fall, but do withall acknowledg his preeminent authority ouer the rest of the Apostles. S. Cyril saith thus: Petrus princeps Apostolorum excellentissimus &amp;c.
               
                  S. Cyril Hierosol. Cathech. Mystag. 2. 
               Peter the most excellent prince of the Apostles, did not only receiue pardon of his denyall (of Christ) verùm etiam dignitatem Apostolicam non ablatam retinuit, but also retayned his Apostolicall dignity not taken from him. So he. And Optatus hauing signified that,
                  Optat. l. 7. de Schismate Donatistarū

               B. Petrus praeferri omnibus Apostolis meruit, Blessed Peter deserued to be preferred before all the Apostles, yea and that, solus accepit claues ceteris communicandas, he only receaued the keyes to be cōmunicated to the rest (which was done bono vnitatis, saith he, for the good of vnity, in which respect, he also calleth him a litle after, caput Apostolorum, the head of the Apostles) he concludeth after a while, that albeit Peter did alone deny Christ,
               
yet, bono vnitatis de numero Apostolorum separari non meruit: for the good of vnity he did not deserue to be separated from the number of the Apostles. Thus saith Optatus, to shew the benefite &amp; necessity of Vnity in Gods Church. And this I hope may suffice for this point.
            30. Now then, to draw to the Conclusion of the premisses, it appeareth plainly therby, that our Catholike doctrine, and arguments grounded vpon the wordes of our Sauiour to S. Peter,
               The pla
                     •
                  ces of 3. Fathers alledged by M. Andrews do confute him. 
               Pasce oues meas, do remayne good and sound, notwithstanding M. Andrewes false glosse therupon; yea, and that they are much confirmed by these very places of S. Augustine, S. Ambrose, &amp; S Cyril, which he hath produced against vs. For wheras all his drift is to proue out of those Fathers, that S. Peter had nothing more by that Pastorall commission, then the rest of the Apostles; you haue heard out of S. Augustine, that in receiuing that cōmission, he represented the person and figure of the whole Church, by reason of his Primacy amongst the Apostles: and out of S. Ambrose, that he was therby preferred before all the Apostles: and lastly out of S. Cyril, that he was Prince, and Head of the Apostles, and that the same dignity (for he speaketh of that which he acknowledgeth to haue bene in him before his fall) was renewed by that commission.S. Chrysostome for S. Peters Supremacy. Wherto may be added the testimony of S. Chrysostome, who in his booke de Sacerdotio treating of those words Pasce oues meas, saith, that our Sauiour would haue S. Peter to be auctoritate praeditum,
               
                  Chrysost. de Sacerd. l. 2. 
               ac reliquis item Apostolis longè praecellere: indued with authority, and also far to excell the rest of the Apostles.
            
            31. And again, in his Homilyes vpon S. Iohns Ghospell, and the same words of our Sauiour, he saith; that Christ asked S. Peter whether he loued him, because he

(to wit Peter) was the mouth of the Apostles, and Prince, &amp; Head of the Congregation: and further teacheth, that by those words, Christ committed vnto him curam Fratrum, the charge of his Brethren (for so he explicateth Pasce oues meas) Neque negationis meminit,
               
                  Ibidem.
                saith he, ne
                     
                        
                     
                     que
                   exprobrat; tantùm dicit, si amas me, fratrum curam susciptas, that is to say, neyther doth Christ remember Peters denyall, neyther doth he vpbrayd him with it, but only saith, if thou louest me, take the charge of thy Brethren. So he: and that by S. Peters Brethren our Sauiour meant the Apostles, it appeareth euidently afterwards in the same Homily, where S. Chrysostome note 
                  〈◊〉
                that albeit at Christs last Supper, S. Peter did not presume to aske our Sauiour a question,
                  Ibid.
                but willed S. Iohn to do it, yet now after this commission was giuen him, commissa sibi fratrum cura, saith he, vicem suam alt
                     •
                  ri non mandat, sed ipse Magistrum interrogat: the charge of his brethren being committed vnto him, he doth not now delegate any other, but himselfe asketh their Maister. Thus saith S. Chrysostome, giuing plainly to vnderstand, that S. Peter hauing by this commission receaued the charge of his brethren the Apostles, was more confident then before, and would not vse the interuention of any of them (because they were vnder his charge) but himselfe asked our Sauiour, as the mouth, Prince, and Head of the Apostolicall Congregation, for so you haue also heard S. Chrysostome tearme him before, in the same Homily.
            32. So that you see this holy Father teacheth the same, that the others before mentioned do, to wit, that S. Peter had by this commission, a preheminence, and prerogatiue aboue all the Apostles; yea, and that the charge, or gouernment of them (no lesse then of all

inferiour Pastours in Gods Church) was cōmitted to him;S. Leo. ep. 89. which S. Leo also testifyeth expressely, saying that the charge of feeding the sheep of Christ, was more specially committed to Peter.

                And in another place, that, Peter was chosen out of the whole world to haue the chiefe charge of the vocation of the Gentills, &amp; of all the Apostles, and of all the Fathers of the Church:

Barlows blasphemous speaches, and exceptions against him: and now to conclude, though I might add to these Fathers the cleare testimonies of Eusebius Emissenus, Theophilactus, S.

                and diuers others concerning S. Peters prerogatiue in his Pastorall commission aboue the rest of the Apostles, yet I will content my selfe with these already cyted, not doubting, but that they may suffice for answere to M. Andrews his idle cauills,

Andrews his sharpe arrowes do proue but shuttlecocks, or fools bolts Eccl. 19. whereof the Psalmist saith, Sagittae potentis acutae; but you see his sharp shafts do proue to be no better then sagittae paruulorum, the shuttlecocks of litle children, or rather to say truely, to be that fooles bolt, which as the Prouerb saith, is soone shot, wherof Salomon saith, sagitta in fe

                  ore canis, sic verbum in corde stulti: as an arrow in the thygh of a dog (who neuer can rest vntill it be out) so is a word in a fooles hart, which truely I would haue forborne to haue said of M. D. Andrews (were

his folly far more exorbitant then it is) if he did not shew so much virulency, and malice towards the worthy Cardinall,
               
                  Prou. 16. as he doth euery where, treating him most iniuriously with such opprobrious and contumelious tearmes,Concerning a law in the Code of Iustinian. that he deserueth to be answered (as the Wyseman aduyseth) secundum stultitiam suam &amp;c. according to his owne folly, lest he may thinke himselfe to be wise.
            
            34. But let vs now passe to some other matter, which shall be a law in the Code,
               
                  Supplem. Chap. 1. nu. 99. beginning inter Claras, which law is an Epistle of Pope Iohn the second, to Iustinian the Emperour, and another of Iustinian to him, wherin the Pope is acknowledged to be Caput omnium Ecclesiarum,
               
                  Apol. Car. Bellar. c. 3. pag. 17. 
               the Head of all Churches. This law is cited by me in my Supplement, to proue the dutifull respect and obedience of the ancient Emperours, shewed to the Apostolicke Roman Sea, and to the same purpose it is also alledged by Cardinall Bellarmine in his Apology,
               
                  Andr. Resp. ad Apolog. cap. 3. pag. 81. to whom M. Andrews answereth thus: 
                  Poterat Cardinalis abstinere à lege, inter Claras, citanda &amp;c. The Cardinall might well haue forborne to cyte the law inter Claras, which he knoweth not to be cyted inter Claras leges, amongst the cleare lawes, but amongst the obscure, and counterfait: he might also haue abstayned from mentioning Iustinian (the Emperour) who shewed himselfe to be Superiour to the Pope (aliqua ex parte) in some part, first in Siluerius the Pope and after in Vigilius, of whome he banished the former, and imprisoned the later. So he: wherein you see two things affirmed, the one that the Cardinall knoweth the law of Iustinian which beginneth inter Claras, to be cyted amongst the obscure, and counterfait lawes;
and the other, that Iustinian shewed himselfe to be in some

part superiour to Popes,
               The law Inter Claras proued to be a most true &amp; cleare Law, though M. Andrews hold it for obscure and counterfait. because he banished Pope Syluerius, and imprisoned Vigilius; I will briefly examine both these points.
            35. As for the first, truly I cannot but wonder at M. Andrews his confidence and boldnes, or rather his impudence, so boldly and confidently to affirme (as he doth without any proofe in the world) that the Cardinall knoweth the foresaid law to be cyted amongst the obscure, yea counterfait Lawes, wheras the Cardinall knoweth it to be held &amp; esteemed not only inter Claras, but also, inter clarissimas leges, amongst the most cleare lawes, for so the most famous Lawyer Baldus tearmeth it;The testimony of Baldus.
                who vpon this very law, maketh this Glosse, Clarissima est lex, in qua Dominus Imperator &amp;c. This is a most cleare law, wherin the Emperour writeth to the Pope cō
                  cerning the faith which he professeth.
               
                  see the Code l. 1. tit. de sūm. Trin.
                So he. And this may be confirmed with the authority of Accursius, who glosseth it no lesse then all the other Lawes in the Code, without making the least doubt or scruple in the world of any obscurity or defect therin.
                  Accurfius
               
            
            36. But perhaps M. Andrewes will say that it cannot be denyed,The testimony of Alciat. but that some haue doubted of it, and impugned it. Whereto I answere, that true it is, that some heretikes of these latter ages haue either ignorantly, or maliciously called it in question,
                  Alciat. l. 4. Parergō cap. 25. of whome the learned, and eloquent Lawyer Alciat saith thus:

                  Sunt qui suspectam habent Ioannis Pontificis epistolam &amp;c. There are some who do suspect Pope Iohns Epistle, which is in Iustinians Code, vnder the Title De Trinitate, and say, that it is not found in some books, which as I thinke they do in fauour of those who depresse the Popes authority; as also I haue found other Authors corrupted by them to the same end (to wit, the Chronicles of Otho

Frisingensis, and certaine verses of Ligurinus the Poet.) But I do know it to be extant in very many old copyes, and that it cānot with any suspicion be impeached, and if one or two books haue it not, it is to be ascribed to the negligence of the Wryters, who somtymes omitted it, because they thought that it doth not much concerne the Science of the Law; neuerthelesse it is not to be doubted, quin genuinus germanus

                      Ioannis sit foetus, but that it is the proper &amp; true worke of Pope Iohn.
               
Thus saith Alciat, who not only testifieth, as you see, that he had himselfe seene it in very many old copyes, but also yieldeth a probable reason why in some other copyes it might be left out.
            37. I could confirme this also by the testimony of the learned Lawier Cuiacius &amp; others,Pope Nicolas the first cyted this law aboue 800. years agoe. if it were needfull, as it is not, seeing that Pope Nicolas the first of that name (who liued aboue 800. years agoe) cyteth the Epistle of Iustinian the Emperour to Pope Iohn, beginning, Reddentes honorem (which he saith, Iustinian himselfe inserted into his Lawes) &amp; layeth downe some part of it word for word,
                  Nicol. ep. ad Michael Imperat.
                as it is yet to be seene in the law inter Claras, wherof we now treate (which law is, as I haue already declared, an Epistle of Pope Iohn to Iustinian, wherin that other of Iustinian cyted by Pope Nicolas is inserted) wherby it is euident that the said Law was,The same cōfirmed out of Liberatus who liued in Iustinians dayes. Liberat. in breuiar. c. 20. as it is now in the Code 800. yeares agoe, and held for a cleare Law of Iustinian, wherof there are also other most pregnant, and conuincing testimonies; for Liberatus who liued in Iustinians tyme, witnesseth that he was himselfe at Rome when Hypatius, and Demetrius came thither, sent from Iustinian the Emperour, to consult with the Sea Apostolike, against the messengers of certaine Nestorian and Eutychian Bishops, concerning

two, or three points then in controuersie betwixt the Catholicks in the East parts, and them (which points also Liberatus setteth downe) &amp; addeth that Pope Iohn did write to the Emperour, Et epistola sua firmauit quid confitendum; and confirmed by his Epistle what was to be professed, or belieued touching the same; and this was done, saith Liberatus, nobis ibi positis, whylest we were there.
            38. So that it is euident inough that the Epistle of Pope Iohn, whereof Liberatus speaketh, is the same that is now in question, as well because the contents are the same, that Liberatus testifyeth, as also for that Hypatius, and Demetrius are mentioned therin to be the Embassadours of Iustinian, who brought it to the Pope; besides that Iustinian himselfe writing to Agapetus the Pope,
                  Tom. 2. Concil. ep. Iustin. ad Agapetū vide Bīniū.
                maketh mention of his owne Epistle to Pope Iohn, and of Pope Iohns to him; as also Pope Iohn doth the like in his Epistle to diuers Senatours: finally Iustinian in a constitution of his directed to Epiphanius Bishop of Constantinople, and set downe in the Code in Greeke,
                  Ibidem ep. 2. Ioan. 2. ad Senatores.
                relateth the substance of his Epistle to Pope Iohn, to the effect abouesaid, shewing also the great care he had to conserue the vnity of all the Churches in the East parts:
                  L. 6. Tit. de sum. Trinit.
                
               Cum ipso, saith he, Sanctissimo Papa veteris Romae ad quem similia hisc
                     •
                   perscripsimus, with the most holy Pope himselfe of old Rome, to whome we haue written the like to these. So he. And then addeth further thus. Nec enim patimur &amp;c. For we do not suffer that any of those things which belong to the state of the Church, be not related 
               
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . 
               to his Beatitude as being the head of all the most holy Priests of God, and specially because, as often as there hath risen any Heretikes in these parts, they haue bene corrected by the sentence, and Iudgement of that

venerable Seat. Thus saith Iustinian in that cōstitution.
            39. Wherein first he testifyeth, that he had written to the Pope of Rome (who was then Iohn the second, as it is euident:) secondly he signifyeth, that the substance of his letters to the Pope was the same in effect, that he wrote to Epiphanius; and this is so cleare by the contents of both the Epistles, that the one (to wit that to Epiphanius) is set downe in the Code in Greeke, without any translation, because the other to Pope Iohn which followeth in Latin,
                  See the Code vb
                        •
                      supra.
                is the same in effect: in which respect the former in Greeke needed not to be translated, as the glosse witnesseth. Thirdly Iustinian in this Constitution to Epiphanius, not only acknowledgeth the Pope to be head of all the holy Priests of God (as he did in like manner in his Epistle to the Pope) but also giueth another most notable testimony as well of the Vniuersall authority,A cleare testimony of the vniuersall authority, &amp; perpetual
                     •
                   integrity of the Roman Sea: as of the perpetuall intergrity of the Roman Sea, seeing he confesseth that all the heresies which euer sprong in the East, or Greeke Church, had been condemned by the Iudiciall sentence of that venerable Seat.
            40. Therefore can any man desire eyther more cleare proofes then these, that the law inter Claras, is a cleare, and no obscure or counterfait law? or more pregnant testimonies of the Primacy of the Bishop of Rome by the Ciuill or Imperiall law in the daies of Iustinian? Or yet a more euident demonstration of M. Andrews vanity, and folly, in seeking to obscure the perspicuous, and cleare light of this ancient law, with such a friuolous and vayne exception so clearly conuinced, as you haue seene? Whereby he also worthily incurreth the malediction of the Prophet, Vae qui dicitis &amp;c. VVo be to you who call good bad,
               
                  Esa. 5. 
               and bad good, and make light darknesse,

and darknesse light. And thus much for this point.
            
               Two facts of Iustiniā the Emp. against 2. Popes examined &amp; reproued.41. The other point which now resteth to be discussed is, that M. Andrews saith, that the Cardinall might also haue abstayned from mentioning Iustinian, because he shewed himself to be Superiour some way to the Pope; first in banishing Siluerius, &amp; after in imprisoning Vigilius; &amp; wheras the Cardinall had also produced the testimony of the Bishop of Patera,
               
                  Liberat. in Breuiar. c. 22. who vpon the banishment of Pope Siluerius came to Iustinian, and protested Gods iudgment against him, saying, that though there were many Kings, yet there was not one alone as he, who was expelled from his Seat, was Pope ouer the Church of the whole world (meaning that there was not one King alone ouer the whole world, as there is one Pope, or vniuersall Pastour ouer the whole Church) M. Andrews answereth thereto:
                  Andr. vbi supra. pag 81. §. Vt nobis.
                
               Non tam curandum &amp;c. It is not to be so much regarded, what the Bishop said, as what Iustinian did. And againe presently after; Facta cùm videamus, verba quid audiamus, vel Paterensis, vel Cardinalis? seeing we see the facts (of Iustinian) why should we harken to the words, eyther of the Bishop of Patera, or of the Cardinall?
            42. So he; arguing as you see, far more simply, &amp; absurdly then it could haue bene belieued, or imagined of D. Andrews, if he had not himselfe published this in print. For if this kind of argument may passe for good,A most absurd argument of M. Andrews. what hath there euer bene in the world so wickedly done, that may not be iustifyed? For howsoeuer it hath byn, or may be reprehended by holy, graue, or learned men, those that list to maintayne the fact, may say with this Doctor, facta cùm videamus, verba quid audiamus? And when our Sauiour Christ said to the Iewes, of those

who sate vpon the Chayre of Moyses,
               
                  Matth. 23. 
               Quae dicunt facite &amp;c. Do what they say, but not what they do, might not some haue answered (according to this Doctors rule) facta cùm videamus, verba quid audiamus? But to the end that his absurdity may the better appeare, let vs consider a little the manner, &amp; quality of these facts of Iustinian. Thus then passed the matter.
            43. Agapetus the Pope,
                  Anast. in Agapeto Hist. miscel. &amp; Paul. Diac. l. 16. Liberat. in Breuiar. c. 22. Predecessour to Syluerius, being at Constantinople, and hauing in the presence of the Emperour Iustinian conuinced the hereticall Bishop of, that Citty called Anthymus, deposed him and ordayned Mennas Bishop in his place, wherwith the hereticall and wicked Empresse Theodora, wife to Iustinian, (and speciall Patronesse of Anthymus) was so highly offended,
                  Platina Blond. dec. 
                  
                     •
                  . lib. 3. Niceph. l. 17. cap. 18. Naucler. Gener. 18. anno 510. that she neuer rested to seeke the restitution of Anthymus, and the expulsion of Mennas: and to that end (Agapetus being shortly after deceased) she made great instance to Siluerius his Successour, to obtaine it of him, and being flatly denyed, she practised his ouerthrow, and caused him to be falsly accused by counterfait letters, to haue intelligence with the Gothes against the Roman Empyre,The wicked practise of the hereticall Empresse Theodora against Pope Syluerius. and to betray vnto them the Citty of Rome. Vpon which pretence he was by her order taken by Bellisarius, and sent into banishment. Loe then one of the two facts, which M. Andrews iustifieth with his rule or maxime of facta cùm videamus, verba quid audiamus? But can there any thing be more shamefull, or more shamefully defended? And so I may likewise say of the other fact, which passed in this manner.
            44. Syluerius the Pope being banished, the wicked Empresse intruded Vigilius into his Seat, vpon assured promise on his part,

                during the life of Siluerius (that is to say, whyles he himselfe was an Intruder, and no true Pope) yet such was Gods mercifull prouidence for the preseruation of S. Peters Seat in the integrity of the Catholike faith, that Siluerius deceasing shortly after, and Vigilius being by the meanes of Bellisarius canonically chosen (whereby he became of an Vsurper to be true Pope, and successour to S. Peter) he vtterly changed his mind, and former course, &amp; not only refused to performe his promise to the Empresse, in the restitution of Anthymus, but also cōming afterwards to Constantinople (where the Emperour receiued him with great honour) he excommunicated her, and other her adherents, as S. Gregory witnesseth, who liued at the same tyme.
            45. And albeit some write that she procured his banishment,
                  Idem An. 538. &amp; Liberat. in Breniar. c. 24. yet others affirme (with more probability) that the same hapned after her death, and was procured by the instigation of Theodorus Bishop of Caesarea in Cappadocia, who was a very fire-brand of Schisme and sedition, and a peruerse hereticke, though he cunningly cloked it a long tyme, being secretly an Origenist, and one of the Sect called Acephali (who impugned the Councell of Chalcedon, &amp; were Eutychians;) finally he was the man who in the end wholy seduced the Emperour, and made him a flat heretike, as I haue signified 
                  Suplem. cap. 1. nu. 108. Iustinian the Emperour was so ignorant that he could neyther wryte nor read, and therefore easily deceaued by subtil heretiks. before. So that it is no meruail that the Emperour being himselfe so ignorant, and vnlearned as he was (not hauing so much skill, as either to writ, or read, being as Suydas testifieth Analphabetus, one that neuer learned his Christ-crosse, and therfore easy to be abused by the practise of subtle Heritiks) it is I say no meruail that he transgressed the bounds,
                  Suydas in Iustiniano
               
               
and limitts of his Imperiall authority,
                  Euagr. l. 4. cap. 40. Idem lib. 5. cap. 1. as well in these two Acts concerning these two Popes, as also in diuers others. In which respect Euagrius a famous Historiographer (who wrote his history at the same tyme) hauing signified that God strooke him with suddayne death,The Iudgment of Euagri concerning Iustinians death, and the state of his soule. for punishment of his wickednes, made no doubt to conclude, concerning him, in these words: Iustinianus cùm omnia omnino turba, at
                     
                        
                     
                     que
                   tumultu compleuisset &amp;c. When Iustinian had filled all the world with trouble, and tumult, and receaued in the end a due reward for the same, he passed from this life to endure the penalty therof in hell, according to Gods iust iudgement.
            
            46. Now then, these being the facts of Iustinian the Emperour, towards these two Popes, let vs ponder a litle what reason M. Andrews hath to prefer the same before the Bishop of Patera's censure thereof, which he vtterly reiecteth, as not meriting any consideration. It is therefore to be considered, that these facts of the Emperour were no lesse repugnant to all the Catholicke Emperours his predecessours (of whome I haue treated amply 
                  See supplem. cap. 1 nu. 90. &amp; seq.
                before) then to his owne course and procedings from the beginning of his Empire, vntill the tyme of Siluerius the Pope, as it doth euidently appeare not only by his publike Decrees and letters written to the Popes Iohn the second, and Agapetus, and to Epiphanius Bishop of Constantinople (wherof I haue spoken sufficiently already:
                  Anastas. in Agapeto. Blond dec. 1. l. 3. Naucler Gen. 18. an. 510.) but also by the great honour he did, and the reuerent respect which he bare to Agapetus the next predecessour to Siluerius, whom as the Historiographers do testifie, he receaued into Constantinople, cum summa veneratione, with exceeding great veneration.
            47 And when Agapetus had conuinced &amp; confounded

the Eutichian Bishop Anthymus,
               
                  Anastas

Therefore, I say, if Iustinians fact against Siluerius, and Vigilius be so much to be esteemed (in M. Andrews his iudgement) as to be preferred before the words and iudgement of a learned Bishop of the same ages, why shall not all these former facts of his (I meane his publike Decrees, letters and most humble submission to Agapetus, all which were conforme to the beliefe, and practise of the whole Church at that tyme) why shall they not, I say ouerweygh M. Andrews his words, and approbation of only two facts done in fauour of Heretykes, and by their instigation, who notably abused Iustinian, and circum
                  •
               ented him, as it is euident in the histories? May not we therefore with much more reason say of this Doctor, then he said of the Bishop, facta cùm videamus, verba Doctoris quid audiamus?
               The importance of the Bishop of Patera his reprehension of Iustinians fact against Pope Syluerius.
               
            
            48. But now if we weigh the words of the Bishop of Patera, of what weyght they ought to be, yea, and were indeed with Iustinian, we shall easily see how vaine, and idle this Doctors words, and conceipts are, who so litle esteemeth them as you haue heard. It is therfore to be vnderstood that this Bishop was a Grecian by birth and habitation, and not bound to Siluerius the Pope by any temporall obligation, of

                that nothing els but meere conscience and the regard of his duty to God, and to the Roman Sea (euen by the instinct of that holy spirit which inspired the prophets in like cases) did mooue this Bishop to go to the Emperour, and so freely, and sharpely to reprehend him for his fact, as he did, with protestation of Gods Iudgements against him; for so saith Liberatus,

                  See Card. Apol. pag. 27. The Bishop of Patera called to witnes (or rather protested) Gods Iudgement against him for expelling the Bishop of so great a Seat: which words beeing also related by the Cardinall out of Liberatus, M. Andrews thought good to nipp out of the Cardinals text, belike because he thought that those words might make the Reader the rather to reflect vpon the propheticall zeale &amp; spirit of this holy Bishop, &amp; the importance of his graue &amp; serious reprehension of the Emperour.

Andrews discouereth an hereticall spirit in his Iudgment of Iustinians fact. &amp; his owne conscience to iudge, and will only say of him, that preferring, as he doth the inconsiderate act of the ignorant, and vnlearned Emperour (misled by heretikes) before the zealous, &amp; graue speach &amp; cesu

Thus saith Liberatus, wherin it is to be noted, that although the Emperour vpon the Bishops admonition, commaunded that the matters whereof Siluerius was accused, should be better examined; yet he did not presume to ordayne, that in case he should be found guilty, he should be depriued of his Dignity, but only that (for the security of the Citty of Rome) he should liue in any other Citty, and there exercise his function and charge.
            50. And Liberatus doth also further declare, that as Siluerius was returning to Rome according to the Emperours order, Bellisarius caused him (at the instance of Vigilius,
               
                  Idem ibidem.
                who then vsurped his Seat) to be deliuered into the hands of two of Vigilius his seruants, in whose custody he perished shortly after with famine &amp; misery, in an Iland called Palmaria; wherby it appeareth how the Emperours reuocation of his fact was frustrated, to wit, not by his owne fault, but by the sinister practise of his officers, &amp; ministers, who by the help of the wicked Empresse Theodora, easily deluded him. So that M. Andrews might learne by this relatiō of Liberatꝰ how potent were the Bishops words, which he so litle esteemeth; and the reader may note as well M. Andrews
               
his folly,M. Andrews hi
                     •
                   folly in approuing an act which the author of it did after disallow and repent. as his bad conscience: his folly, in that he maketh more accompt of the temerarious, and erroneous act of the Emperour (which he himself acknowledged for such, &amp; recalled) then of the Bishops admonition, which made him see and repent his errour; his bad conscience, in that he dissembled all this, though he could not but see it in Liberatus
                     •
                  
                for no man can imagine that he would be so negligent as to answere to this obiection of Cardinall Bellarmine, and not to search the Authour alledged by the Cardinall, to see whether there were any corruption in the allegation; &amp; therfore thou maist see, good Reader, with what sincerity he vseth to treat matters of Religion (though the same import no lesse then the eternall saluation,The bad conscience of M. Andrews in dissembling the truth which he could not but see in Liberatus.
                or damnatiō of mens soules) not caring what he saith or dissembleth so that he may shift of the matter for the tyme with some shew of probability, whereof we shall see much more experience hereafter in him, as we haue already seene the like in M. Barlow. For truely it is hard to say whether of them is more fraudulent, and absurd in this kind.
            51. In the meane time two things are euident by this which hath been heere debated; the one, how weakely M. Andrewes argueth when he saith, that the Emperour Iustinian shewed himself in these two acts to be superiour to the Pope aliqua exparte, for it may well be graunted in some sense,A weake &amp; foolish argument of M. Andrews, to proue Iustinian superiour to 2. Popes. &amp; he gaine nothing by it, seing the like may be said of Nero, who put to death S. Peter, and S. Paul; of Herod, who killed S. Iohn Baptist; and of Pilate, who gaue sentēce of death against Christ, for they and all other persecutors of Gods Church (yea Iustinian also himself in the end of his raigne when he declared himself an heretick, and expelled Catholick

Bishops from their seats,M. Andrews must deuyse new answeres to the Cardinal, concerning the law inter Claras, &amp; the Bishop of Patera his reprehension of Iustinian. because they would not subscribe to his heresies) they all, I say, shewed themselues to be Superiours (aliqua ex parte) ouer those whom they killed, banished, and persecuted, hauing by Gods permission power ouer them, and exercysing the same power vpon them: neuertheles I hope no good Christian man will say that because they did this, ergo, it was lawfully done, which must eyther be the conclusion of M. Andrewes his argument à facto, or els he concludeth nothing to the purpose.
            52. The other thing which I say is cleare by the premisses, is, that as well the testimony of the Bishop of Patera, produced by the Cardinall, as also the other, grounded vpon the law inter Claras (alledged both by the Cardinall, and by me) are good, and solid proofes for the Popes Vniuersall authority ouer the Church of God, notwithstanding the idle exceptions of M. Andrewes against the same, and therefore he must now deuyse some other answere therto, or seek some other shift, seeing this hath fayled him, and serued to no other purpose, but to shew his conformity of spirit, rather with the hereticks, who deceaued and seduced Iustinian in the banishment of two Popes, then with such Catholicke and holy Bishops, as the Bishop of Patera, or those others,M. Andrews his words of the Cardinall iustly retorted vpon himselfe. whose aduise he vsed in making his Catholike lawes, in fauour and honour of the Sea Apostolike. Finally, thou seest, good Reader, that it may be iustly sayd of him, as he said of the Cardinall, to wit that he might haue abstayned from mentioning Iustinian, and the law inter Claras, seeing that he hath gayned thereby nothing els, but to manifest his owne folly to bewray the weaknes of his cause, &amp; to fortify ours.
         
         
            
            THE ANSVVERS OF M. ANDREWS TO Certayne places of the Councell of Calcedon are examined, and confuted. His notable fraud in diuers things, and especially in the allegation of a Canon of that Councell is discouered: and the supreme authority of the Sea Apostolike clearely proued out of the same Councell, and Canon.

Andrewes hath framed an Answere, such a one as it is, &amp; so perhaps may seeme to some to haue answered vs both. In which respect I think good to examin what he saith concerning that

matter, the rather because he holdeth it for a paradoxe in the Cardinall, to affirme that the Popes Supremacy is manifestly gathered out of that Councel, &amp; addeth further, that the Cardinals authority is not yet so great in the world, as to make men belieue that the Popes Primacy is established by that which they know doth specially ouerthrow it.
               
                  Andr. pag. 170. cap. 7. §. Quod ibi.
                So saith M. Andrewes; &amp; therefore this poynt seemeth to me right worthy to be discussed.
            2. Thus then he saith: Legat actione vna totaventilatum &amp;c.
                  Ibidem.
                
               Let a man read the matter debated in one whole action (of the Councel) and renewed, and confirmed in another, &amp; finally decreed by a Canon, that the priuiledges of the Bishop of Constantinople shalbe, ne maiora, sed aequalia per omnia, not greater, but equal in all things with the priuiledges of the Bishop of Rome, the Roman Legats crying in vayne against it, and the Bishop of Rome himself s
                     •
                  ying also afterwards by his letters in vayne to the Emperour, Empresse, and Anatolius. Thus saith M. Andrewes; wherein two things specially are to be noted for the present (for afterwards I will ad a thyrd:) one is, that the Councel granted by that Canon to the Bishop of Constantinople equal priuiledges, per omnia, in all respects, with the Bishop of Rome: The other that Pope Leo, and his Legats resisted, and contradicted it in vayne.
            3. For the first, whereas he saith that the Councell of Calcedon did by that Canon giue to the Bishop of Constantinople,
               M. Andrews his shameles dealing. 
               ne maiora, sed aequalia per omnia priuilegia, not greater priuiledges, but equal in all things with the Bishop of Rome (as though the Councell had exempted the Church, and Bishop of Constantinople from subiection to the Roman Sea, for, par in parem non habet potestatem, an equal hath no authority, or power ouer his equal) truly I must needs say, that if M. Andrews had any

care what he saith, or sparke of shame, he would not haue affirmed this so resolutly as he hath done, seeing that the very words, and text of the Canon it selfe do euince the contrary. In which respect he thought good to giue vs only some patches &amp; pieces thereof with his corrupt sense, and vnderstanding of it, and not to lay downe the Canon it selfe, whereof the drift, and whole scope is no other, but to giue to the Bishop of Constantinople the second place after Rome, before the Bishops of Alexandria, Antioch, and Hierusalem, which Churches in former tymes had alwayes had the precedence before the Church of Constantinople.
               
                  Concil. Chalced. Act. 15. Can. 28.
            
            4. The words of the Canon are these: 
                  Sanctorum Patrum decreta vbique sequentes &amp;c. Following euery where the decrees of the holy Fathers, and acknowledging the Canon of an hundreth and 50. Bishops, which was lately read, we do also decree, and determine the same, concerning the priuiledges of the Church of Constantinople, which is new Rome. For the Fathers did worthily giue priuiledges to the Throne of old Rome, because that Citty did raygne (or had the Empyre) and the 150. Bishops most beloued of God, being moued with the same consideration, gaue equall priuiledges to the most holy Throne of new Rome, iudging rightly, that the Citty which is honored as well with the Empyre, as with the Senate, and doth enioy equal priuiledges with the most ancient Queene Rome, should be also extolled, and magnifyed, as she is, euen in Ecclesiasticall things, secundam post illam existentem, being the second after her &amp;c.
            
            5. Thus saith the Canon, adding also certayne priuiledges which were in particuler granted to the Church of Constantinople, whereof I shall haue occasion

to speake after a whyle, when I shall first haue explicated this that I haue layed downe already, which, as you hane seene, hath no other sense, or meaning, then to renew, or confirme a former Canon pretended to be made by 150. Bishops in the Councel of Constantinople some 60. yeares before, which Canon was a confirmation of the Decrees of the Councel of Nice, not only concerning matters of faith, but also touching the limites, and iurisdiction of certaine Metropolitan Churches, yet with this exception in fauour of the Church of Constantinople,

               The sense and meaning of the Canon of the Councell of Cal. alleadged by M. Andrews.6. This then being the effect of that Canon of the councel of Constantinople, it is cleare that this other of the Councell of Calcedon which renewed, and confirmed it, was also to the same purpose, to wit, to giue to the Church of Constantinople the second place after the Roman, that is to say, the preheminence before the Churches of Alexandria, and Antioch, which according to the Canons of the Councel of Nice, had the second, and third place after the Church of Rome; and this, I say, is euident in the Canon it selfe alledged by M. Andrewes, where it is sayd expresly of the Church of Constantinople,
               
                  Can. 28. that it should be magnified, and extolled as old Rome was, secundam post illam existentem, being the sesecond after her, which clause was yet more clearely expressed in the same Canon, as it was related in the Councell the day after it was made in these words,
                  Concil. Calced. Act. 16. 
               Et in Ecclesiasticis sicut illa maiestatem habere negotijs, &amp; secundam post illam existere, that is to say, we iudged it conuenient that the Citty of Constantinople should haue a

Maiesty in Ecclesiasticall affayres,
               
                  Relatio Synodi ad Leon. in fine Còcil.
                
               as Rome hath, and be the second after her; besides, that the relation which the whole Councell of Calcedon made to Pope Leo of the substance, and effect of this Canon, may put the matter out of all doubt, declaring it thus: Confirmauimus autem, &amp; centum quinquaginta sanctorum Patrū regulam &amp;c. We haue also confirmed the rule, or Canō of the 150. holy Fathers, which were assembled in Constantinople, vnder Theodosius the elder of pious memory, whereby it was ordayned, that after that most holy, and Apostolicall Seat, the Church of Constantinople should haue the honour, which is ordayned to be the secōd &amp;c. Thus wrot the whole Councell of Calcedon to Pope Leo.
            
            7. Now then can any thing be more cleare then that the drift, and meaning of that Canon is no other then to giue the second place to the Church of Constantinople, after the Sea Apostolike? Why then doth M. Andrewes affirme so confidently, that this Canō made thē equall in all things?
               M. Andrews corrupteth the text of the Canon, adding vnto it per omnia.
                For although it giueth to the Bishop of Constātinople equall priuiledges with the Bishop of Rome, yet it neither saith nor meaneth that their priuiledges should be equall in all things or in all respects, as M. Andrews corruptly, &amp; fraudulētly affirmeth in a differēt Letter, as though he laid down the very words of the Canō. Besides that, the equality mētioned in the Canon, is sufficiently explicated by the Canon it self, which hauing signified that the Fathers in that Councell thought good to grant the second place vnto the Church of Constantinople, and to giue it equall priuiledges with the Church of Rome, addeth presently (for the explication thereof) vt &amp; Ponticae, &amp; As
                     •
                  anae, &amp; Thraciae Dioecesis Metropolitani &amp;c. That the Metropolitans of Pontus, Asia, &amp; Thracia,

and also the Bishopps of the same Diocesse amongst the Barbarous (so were all called, that were no Graecians) should be ordayned by the Bishops of Constantinople.
            
            8. So sayth the Canon, giuing to vnderstand that whereas the Church of Constantinople had bene in times past but a priuate Bishoprick (&amp; subiect to Heraclea) it should hereafter be not only a Metropolitan,
               What māner of Equality the Church of Cōstantinople should haue with the Romā Church. but also a Patriarchall Sea, and haue Metropolitans vnder it, yea and that as the Church of Rome was the chiefe Church of the West, so also the Church of Constantinople (being now made the second after Rome) should be the chief Church of the East, &amp; preferred before the Patriarchall Seas of Alexandria, Antioch, and Hierusalem, yet with this euident exception, and reseruation, that neuerthelesse it should be still inferiour to the Roman Sea, being the second after it, that is to say, it should haue the same place and priuiledge that the Church of Alexandria had in former times, which though it was the chief Church of the East, &amp; the secōd after Rome,
               
                  Sozom. hist. l. 3. cap. 7. yet was alwayes inferiour &amp; subiect thereto, as it is euident by the appeale of the famous Athanasius Bishop of that Sea, to Pope Iulius the first of that name, aboue an hūdreth yeares before the Coūcel of Calcedō.
            
            
               What preheminence the Church of Cōstā
                  tinople sought to haue in the Coū
                  cell of Calcedon.9. Therfore the preheminence which the Church of Cōstantinople was to haue by this Canon, was to be preferred before the Churches of Alexandria &amp; Antioch: and the equality that it was to haue with Rome, was no other, but to be a Patriarchall Sea, and head of all the Patriarchall, and Metropolitan Churches of the East, as Rome was in the West, yet with reseruatiō of the right of Primacy due to the Roman Sea. Besides that, it is to be noted that the Greek word 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                which

in our latin Copies is translated aequalis, doth signify also similis, lyke, not only in prophane Authors (as euery mā may see in the Thesaurus of Henricꝰ Stephanꝰ) but also in diuers places of holy Scripture, both in the old &amp; new Testamēt. And he that list to see more to this purpose, may read the Paralel of Tortus, &amp; his Tortor, writtē against M. D. Andrews, by the Reuerēd &amp; Learned Father Androas Eudaemon-Ioannes, who hath sufficiently handled,
                  See Paral. Torti. ac Tort. cap. 4. p. 157. edit. Colon, 1611. and explicated this point, and hath also produced a cleare testimony out of Theodorus Balsamon a very learned Grecian, and Patriarch of Antioch, to proue that the mention of paria priuilegia, equall priuiledges grāted to the Church of Cō
                  stantinople in the Coūcell of Calcedō, doth not any way derogate from the supreme dignity of the Romā
                Sea.
            10. Whereto I also add, that the word aequalis in the Scripture doth not alwayes signify a true, and iust Equality in all respects, but somtymes also an Equality in a certayne proportion,How Equality is vnderstood somtimes in the Scriptures. as in the Apostle to the Corinthians, who exhorteth them to supply the temporall wants, and necessityes of the poore, with their store, and aboundance, vt fiat aequalitas, sayth he, that there may be an equality, meaning an equality in a certayne similitude, and proportion, as it appeareth by that which he addeth for the further explication therof, saying: sicut scriptum est, qui muliùm non abundauit, &amp; qui modicum non minorauit, as it is written, he which gathered much,
               2. Cor. 8. 
               had no more, then was necessary for him, and, he that gathered litle, had no less. So sayth the Apostle, alluding to the history in Exodus of those who gathered Manna in different quantity,
                  Exod. 18. and yet found that they had it in

                  〈1 page duplicate〉
               
               
               
                  〈1 page duplicate〉
               
               
               
a kind of equality (because euery one had so much as was needfull for him,
                  See S. Tho. in ep. 2. ad Cor. cap. 8. and no more) so that equality doth not signify heere an Arithmeticall equality (as the Philosophers,
                  Item Ioan. Gagnaeus in hunc locum.
                and Schoolemen tearme it) which is equall in euery respect, and is vsed in commutatiue Iustice, that is to say, in buying, and selling and the lyke (wherein the iust and true valew of euery thing is equally considered) but a Geometricall equality, keeping only a certayne proportion according to distributiue Iustice, which (as Aristotle, and the Schoolemen do teach) doth alwayes respect equality in the distribution of honours, priuiledges, and rewards; yet so, as due proportion be obserued correspondent to the different dignity and quality of euery one.Two kinds of equality correspō
                  ding to two kinds of Iustice. And therfore when two persons of different quality and degree (as the Captayne, and his souldiar) are to be rewarded for some one seruice to the common wealth, their rewards, or priuiledges are truly equall, when they are priuiledged,
                  Aristot. Ethic. 5. S. Thom. 2.2. q. 16. and rewarded in a due proportion to their degrees, without impeachment to the difference that is betwixt them. And so a subiect may be said to haue equall priuiledges with his King, and yet be his subiect still: and in this mā
               ner the words equall, and equality are to be vnderstood in the Coūcell of Calcedō
                (as is euident by the Canō it self) wherin you see, it was ordayned that the Bishop of Constantinople should haue equall priuiledges with the Bishop of Rome, and yet haue the secōd place after him.
            11. But now to deale somewhat more liberally with M. Andrews in this point, let vs put the case that the Fathers in the Councell of Calcedon did meane to giue to the Church of Constantinople that equality with the

Roman sea,The Canon which graunted the priuiledges to the Church of Constā
                  tinople abrogated by Pope Leo. which he affirmeth; should he, trow you, gayne any thing thereby? Or could he any way preiudice the vniuersall, and supreme authority, either of Pope Leo at that tyme, or of the other Popes his Successors euer since? Truly no; but rather should notably confirme theyr primacy, and vtterly ouerthrow his owne cause, seeing that it is most euident, that the authority of Pope Leo was such, that his only opposition to that Canon, and his abrogation therof sufficed to ouerthrow, &amp; disanull it; which I will take a litle paynes to proue by the whole course, and practise of the Church, euen from that Councell, vntill the ruine of the Greeke Church and Empyre, which though it be needlesse in respect of the learned, yet I hope it will not be altogeather fruitles to the more ignorant, and vnlearned, and may serue for an aboundant conuiction of M. Andrews his impudency, and malice, who is not ashamed to auouch such a manifest falsehood, and impugne such a knowne truth, as he doth.
            12. To this purpose I wish it to be noted, what Gelasius (who liued at the same tyme, and was Pope about 30. yeares after Leo) wrote to the Bishops of Dardania,
               Foure things to be noted in an Epistle of Pope Gelasius for the inualidity of the Canō. concerning a schisme raysed by Acatius Bishop of Constantinople in the tyme of Pope Felix his Predecessor, in which Epistle he signifyeth 4. things specially to be noted for this purpose. First, that the Emperour Martian (though he had made great instance to Pope Leo for the aduancement of the Church of Constantinople, yet) did highly prayse, and commend the said Pope, for that he would not by any meanes suffer the rules of the Canons to be violated in that point. Secondly, that Anatolius the Bishop of Constantinople, in

whose fauour that Canon was made (being most seuerely reprehended by Pope Leo for his ambitious attempt) excused himself, laying the fault vpon the Clergy of Constantinople, and affirming, in Apostolici Praesulis totum positum potestate, that all the matter was in the power of the Apostolicall Prelate, that is to say of Pope Leo. Thirdly, that the Emperour Leo who succeeded Martian before Pope Leo dyed, attempting within a few yeares after to obtayne the same priuiledges for the Church of Cōstātinople in the tyme of Pope Simplicius, was flatly denyed them, and that it was declared vnto him by Probus Bishop of Canusium the Popes Legat, nullatenus posse tentari, that it might by no meanes be attempted.
            13. Finally Gelasius also signifyeth, that Acatius Bishop of Constantinople, who raysed the Schisme wherof he writeth, and was therefore excommunicated by Pope Felix, was himself so subiect, &amp; obedient to the Roman Sea, before he fell into that schisme, that he procured the Pope to censure, and depriue the Bishops of Alexandria, and Antioch, yea and was himself executor of the Popes sentence against them, and that therefore falling also himself afterwards into the fellowship of the condemned Bishops (vpon whome he had executed the Popes sentence of condemnatiō) he deserued no lesse to be condemned then they. All this witnesseth Gelasius; whereby it appeareth euidently that from the tyme of the Councel of Calcedon to his raigne, which was about 40. yeares, the Canon whereupon M. Andrewes relyeth, was not held to be of any waight, for the exemption of the Church of Constantinople from the subiection of the Church to the Roman Sea. For if the Canon had then had any such force, neyther

would the Emperour Martian haue hyghly commended Pope Leo for resisting it, nor Anatolius (in whose fauour it was made) would haue excused himself for procuring it, and acknowledged the matter to depend wholy vpon Pope Leo's determination: neyther should Leo the Emperour haue needed to haue renewed that suit to Pope Simplicius; neyther yet would Acatius haue yielded, as he did, for a tyme, to obay the Pope, and to execute his sentence vpon other Grecian Bishops.
            14. Furthermore albeit this schisme raysed by Acatius continued in the Church of Constantinople some yeares after his death (during the raigne of two Hereticall Emperours,The East Church acknowledged to be subiect to the Sea of Rome. to wit Zeno, and Anastasius, which was about 40. yeares) yet diuers Grecian, and Orientall Bishops which were partakers of the sayd schisme, made earnest, and humble suit in the meane tyme to Pope Symmachus in a generall, and cōmon letter (with the tytle, or superscription of Ecclesia Orientalis &amp;c.) to be restored to the vnion of the Roman Sea,
                  Ep. orient. Episcop. ad Symmachū. To. 2. Concil.

Peter, Prince of the Apostles, but also to feede Christs sheep committed to his charge per totum habitabilem mundum, throughout the whole habitable world. And as soone as the wicked Emperour Anastasius was dead (who was stroken, by Gods iust iudgement, with a thunderbolt) and the worthy, and Catholike Emperour Iustinus chosen in his place, as well Iustinus himself, as also a Synod of Bishops assembled in Constantinople, togeather with Iohn Bishop of that Sea, demanded of Pope Hormisdas (who succeeded Symmachus) to be reconciled to the Sea Apostolik; and afterwards the sayd Bishop of Constantinople sent a profession

of his faith to Hormisdas,

Peter, then to the pretended, and supposed equality of priuiledges which M. Andrews saith, were granted to the Church of Constantinople by that Canon of the Councell of Calcedon.

Moreouer Mennas Bishop of Constantinople being excommunicated together with Theodorus Bishop of Caesarea in Cappadocia by Pope Vigilius, pretended not this Canon, or the equality supposed by M. Andrewes, but submitted himself, as also Theodorus did, to the authority of the Roman Sea, crauing absolution, and restitution to the communion thereof.

                and opposed himself to the Roman Sea, taking vpon him the title of Vniuersall Bishop (which schisme lasted only during his lyfe) yet it is euident by the Epistle of Pope Pelagi

            18. And after the death of the sayd Iohn, S. Gregory the great in an Epistle of his to a Sicilian Bishop, testifieth that the Bishop of Constantinople in his time being accused of a great delict, acknowledged himself to be subiect to the censure, or chastisment of the Sea Apostolik, in case he were guilty; whereupon S. Gregory saith,

               Nam quòd se dicit Sedi Apostolicae subijci, siqua culpa in Episcopis inuenitur &amp;c. For wheras he saith that he is subiect to the Sea Apostolik, if any fault be found in the Bishops, I know not who is not subiect vnto it.
               
                  Idem ibid. ep. 64. And in another epistle to the same Bishop, he saith: Quis dubitet eam Sedi Apostolicae subiectam &amp;c. Who doubteth but that the Church of Constantinople is subiect to the Sea Apostolyke, which as well the most pious Emperour; as Eusebius Bishop therof do continually professe? So he, wherein it is to be noted that these Bishops of Constantinople professed this their obedience to the Roman Sea, at such tyme as the Church of Rome was most miserably oppressed by the tyranny of the Gothes, and Longobards, in such sort, that it would haue beene vtterly contemned (especially by the Greeke Church) if it had vsurped a greater authority, then was generally belieued to be due vnto it, and to haue byn giuen by our Sauiour to S. Peter, and his Successors.
            19. To this may be added the excommunication, and deposition of many Bishops of Constantinople by

Bishops of Rome,Many Bishops of Constantinople deposed by the Popes of Rome. as it appeareth in an Epistle of Pope Nicolas the first to the Emperour Michael, wherein he nameth 8. Bishops of that Sea deposed by his predecessors; and afterwards he himself also gaue sentence of excommunication, &amp; deposition against Photius Bishop of the same Sea, which sentence Basilius the Emperour executed for feare of incurring the censures of the Sea Apostolike,
                  Ep. Nicolai 1. ad Michael. Imperat.
                as he himself testified in the 8. generall Councell. And when Photius was afterwards by his owne subtile practise restored to his Sea, he was agayne deposed by Pope Stephanus:
                  To. 4. concil in 8. Synodo gener. in appendice ex Act. 6. and such was the reuerence, and respect that the Clergy, and Nobility of Constantinople bare to the Sea Apostolike, that they would not admit one of the bloud Royall called Stephanus to succeed Photius, vntill they had written to the Pope to haue his confirmation thereof. Moreouer three generall Councels, to wit the 6.7. and 8. being after S. Gregoryes tyme assembled, and held in Greece, and two of them in Constantinople it self, the Popes Legats, and not the Bishop of Constantinople were Presidents therof, which neyther the Greeke Emperours nor those Bishops would haue permitted, if they had byn perswaded that the Councell of Chalcedon had exempted the Church of Constantinople from the Popes Iurisdiction, or made the same equal with the Roman Church.
            20. And albeit after S. Gregories time diuers hereticall Emperours, and the Bishops of Constantinople, during their raigne, caused diuers schismes, and separated them selues from the vnion of the Roman Sea, yet when Catholike Emperours, and Bishops succeeded, they returned to the vnion, and obedience thereof; in so much that not only the Embassadours of the Emperour Petrus Altisiodorensis, but also the two Patriarkes

            21. And againe 200. yeares after in the yeare 1459. the Greeke Emperour Ioannes Paleologus, and Ioseph Bishop of Constantinople, togeather with the Legates of the other 3. Patriarkes of Alexandria, Antioch, and Hierusalem, besids many Grecian Bishops, Abbots, and other learned Prelats,

                  S. Antoninus Tit. 22. cap. 13. §. 1.2. &amp; seq. Item Concil. Florentin. sess. vlt.
                but also of the ancient Greeke Fathers, they receiued, and with their hands and seales confirmed the Catholike doctrine, as well concerning that point, as all other wherein they had in the tyme of the former Schismes dissented from the Roman Church, as I haue signified more at large in the first Chapter of my Supplement, where I proposed also to be considered,
                  See Suplem. cap. 1. nu. 114. &amp; 115. that presently after their reuolt from this solemne vnion made at Florence, God punished the Empyre, and Church of Constantinople with that lamentable, and miserable captiuity wherein it hath euer since remayned.
            
               The iust Iudgmēts of God vpon the Church of Constantinople.22. And thereto I will now also add for the conclusion of this point, what S. Antoninus obserueth in his history concerning the iust Iudgements of God vpon the Church of Constantinople, before the fall of the Greeke Empyre, to wit, that whereas the Bishops of that Sea had dyuers tymes most ambitiously, and

proudly impugned the authority of the Roman Church, by the fauour, and help of the hereticall Emperours, God so disposed, that in the end the said Emperours became the instruments of his iustice, to punish their pryde, especially from the tyme of the Emperour Constantin called Monomachus, who though in despyte, and hatred of the Roman Church, he graced the Bishop of Constantinople called Michaël, not only with extraordinary priuiledges, and ensygnes of honour (which he granted as well to his person and successors, as to his Sea) but also with the tytle of Vniuersall Patriarke of the whole world, and all Papal authority (leading also his horse by the brydle to his pallace, because he had vnderstood that the Emperours of the West had done the like honour, and seruice to some Popes) neuertheles perceauing afterwards that the people did, by this occasion, beare such reuerence, and respect to Michaël, that the Imperiall state might be endangered (as he conceiued) in case any controuersy should fall out betwixt the Church, and the Empyre, he publikely degraded, and disgraced him, depriuing him of all those ensignes, tytles, and priuiledges, wherewith eyther he, or any other of the Emperours his predecessors had endowed the Church, or Bishops of Constantinople.
            
            23. And from that tyme forward, as S. Antoninus testifieth, the Patriarks of that Sea became very slaues to the hereticall Emperours, and were put out, and in by them at their pleasure, whyles in the meane tyme the Roman Church ouercomming all her enemies, tryumphed ouer the malice, and tyranny of her oppressors, enioying the stability, security, and maiesty which she still possesseth; wherein the prouidence and

iustice of Almighty God is euidently seene,
                  Matth. 16. as well in conseruing the Sea Apostolike according to his promise to S. Peter, as also in depressing, and punishing the pryde of the Bishops of Constantinople, who had so oft maliciously impugned the same, which may serue for a Caueat to other rebellious Children of the Church. For,
                  Eccli. 5. although Almighty God is patiens redditor, a slow paymaster, yet he payeth home in the end; and as Valerius saith,
                  Valer. Maxim. l. 1. cap. 1. 
               tarditatem supplicij grauitate compensat, he recompenseth the slownes of his punishment, with the weyght, or grieuousnes thereof. This I haue thought good to touch here by the way, vpon so good an occasion, &amp; will now conclude concerning M. Andrewes his Canon, alledged out of the Councell of Calcedon.
            
            24. Therfore I say that it being euident by all this discourse, that the sayd Canon was neuer able to equal the Church of Constantinople with the Roman Sea (to which end M. Andrews saith it was enacted) he must needs coufesse, that eyther there was no such Canon at all, to the purpose that he mentioneth, or els that the small force, and authority therof may serue for an euident argument of the supreme power, and authority of Pope Leo, and his successors, seeing that theyr only resistance, and contradiction sufficed to ouerthrow it, notwithstanding the great authority of the Councell of Calcedon which ordayned it.
                  Andr. cap. 7. p. 170. Whereby it also appeareth how vainely and vntruely he saith, that Pope Leo contradicted it in vayne; yea, and which is more absurd, that he made suite,Bad dealing of M. Andrews. and intercession in vayne, Frustra (saith he) Romano ipso Pontifice apud Augustum, Augustam, &amp; Anatolium per litteras suas intercedente; The Bishop of Rome himselfe making intercession, or

sueing in vayne by his letters to the Emperour, the Empresse, and Anatolius. So that you see, he maketh Pope Leo's case very desperate, and his authority very feeble, seeing that he was fayne to make such intercession, and suite, not only to the Emperour and Empresse, but also to Anatolius himselfe.
            25. Therefore albeit I am not ignorant that intercedere hath dyuers senses, and amongst the rest signifieth to withstand, prohibite, or hinder a thing proposed or intended; and that some perhaps may say that M. Andrews vseth it heere in that sense: yet because it signifieth also to make intercession, and suite, and is so vsed commonly in Ecclesiasticall Authors, and will be so vnderstood in this place by euery common Reader; yea and for that M. Andrewes himselfe so taketh, and vseth it diuers

                   Locus. tymes, and would be loath (no doubt) to haue men thinke that Pope Leo did, or durst oppose himselfe to the Emperour, &amp; Empresse (but rather that in this case he behaued himselfe towards them, and Anatolius as an humble suppliant, and yet all in vayne) therefore I say, I cannot let this poynt passe vnexamined, to the end thou mayst see,
                  Liberat. in Breuiar. cap 13. Ep. Leo. 53.54.55.59.70.71. good Reader, as well M. Andrewes his vanity, as also what kind of suit &amp; intercession Pope Leo made vnto these whome he nameth, &amp; what effect, &amp; successe it had with them. But first I think it not amisse to declare here how this Canon was made in that Councell, and why it was contradicted by the Legats of Pope Leo,
               How the Canon for the B. of Constantinoples priuiledgs was made. &amp; afterwards disanulled by Leo himself.
            26. Therefore it is to be vnderstood that Anatolius then Bishop of Constantinople, ambitiously thirsting after his owne promotion (namely to be preferred before the Bishops of Alexandria, and Antioch, and considering

that Dioscorus Bishop of Alexandria was deposed by the Councell for heresy, and the Bishop of Antioch much disgraced for hauing adhered to Dioscorus, thought that a good opportunity was offered him to accomplish his desyre, and therevpon practised with the Bishops in the Councell for the furtherance of his pretence, and hauing gayned so many of them, that it seemed to him their very number, and authority, might extort the consent of the rest (yea of the Popes Legats themselues) procured, that when the last session of the Councell was ended, and as well the Iudges, or Senate, as the Legats were departed, all the Bishops of his faction eyther remayned behynd, or els after their departure returned againe to the place of the assembly, and there made the Canon whereof we now treate. Whereupon the Legats hauing notice of it,
                  Concil. Calced. act. 16. caused the whole Councell to be assembled againe the next day, and finding Anatolius, and his faction (who were the far greater part of the Councell) resolute in their determination, protested their owne opposition, &amp; contradiction to the Canon, as well in respect, that it was repugnant to the Councell of Nice, as also for that the other

            27. Finally they reserued the determination of the matter to Pope Leo himselfe, whom they called Apostolicum Virum, Vniuersalis Ecclesiae Papam. The Apostolicall man, and Pope of the Vniuersall Church, vt ipse, say they, aut de suae Sedis iniuria, aut de Canonum euersione possit ferre sententiam. That he may giue sentence

Item ep. 55.70. &amp; 71. which also the whole Councell acknowledged sufficiently in a common letter written to him, wherein they craued of him the ratification of this Canon, most humbly, and instantly, (as it will appeare heereafter) which neuertheles he flatly denyed, confirming only the condemnation, and deposition of Dioscorus, and the rest of their decrees cōcerning matters of faith (for the which only he sayd the Councell was assembled) and in fine he disanulled the Canon for diuers causes specifyed in his Epistles. First because it had no other ground but the ambitious humour of Anatolius, who inordinatly sought thereby to haue the precedence before the Patriarks of Alexandria, and Antioch. Secondly, because it was not procured, or made Canonically, but by practise, and surreption in the absence of his Legats

                  Leo ep. 53. ad Anatolium. Idem ep. 55. ad Pulcher.
                was of no validity, hauing neuer been sent to the Sea Apostolike, nor put in practise by the predecessors of Anatolius. Lastly, for that it was flatly repugnant to the Canons of the Councell of Nice.
            
            28. For these causes, I say, Pope Leo abrogated this Canon, which neuertheles it is like he would haue admitted, and confirmed, if it had proceeded from any good ground, and tended to any vtility of the Church, and had beene withall orderly proposed, and Canonically made;
                  Concil. Nicen. Can. 6. for, albeit the Councell of Nice had already ordayned: the

               , and iurisdiction of the Patriarchal

Churches of Alexandria, Antioch, and Hierusalem, with the consent of Pope Siluester, who was the head of that Councell (without whose ratification, nothing could be of force that was decreed therein, no more then our Acts of Parliamēt without the Kings approbation) neuertheles, for as much as the Canons of the Nicen Councell touching those Churches, and this Canon also, whereof we now specially treate, did not ordayne, or concerne any thing which was de iure diuino, but only the priuiledges, and iurisdiction of Churches pertayning to Ecclesiasticall Lawes, it is euident that Pope Leo (being the head of the whole Church) might dispose of them, as he should see iust cause, yea and it is not to be doubted but that he would haue ratified this Canon, had he not seene such sufficient cause to the cōtrary, as hath beene declared; &amp; therfore the Popes his successors being moued with such other occasions, and vrgent reasons, as change of tyme produced, not only permitted the Bishops of Constantinople to haue the second place after them, but ordayned it also by a Canon, as I shall haue occasion to shew 
                  See after in the end of this Chapter.
                heereafter. In the meane tyme I conclude concerning this poynt, that although Thedorus Balsamon, and Zonaras, and some other Grecian collectors of the Councells, do set downe this Canon in fauour of the Churches of Constantinople, yet it is not to be found eyther in the Collections of Dionysius and Isidorus gathered out of the Greeke aboue a thousand yeares agoe, or yet in the old Greek manuscripts, or the ancient Latin copies of the Councells, which we haue in these parts: and thus much for the making, and abrogation of this Canon.
            29. And now to come to the assertion of M. Andrewes
               
concerning Pope Leo's intercession,What maner of intercessiō Pope Leo made to Martian the Emperour against Anatolius. made (as he saith) in vayne to the Emperour, Empresse, and Anatolius, true it is, that Pope Leo wrote to them all three, but whether as a suiter or suppliant, or yet in vayne, let the Reader iudge, and accordingly giue credit to M. Andrews hereafter. First then he wrote to the Emperour, that whereas he (I meane Pope Leo) might haue called Anatolius to account long before, for being consecrated Bishop by an heretike,
                  Leo. ep 54. ad Martiā.
                he had borne with him at the Emperours request, and that by the Emperours help and by his (I meane Pope Leo's) fauourable consent, Anatolius had obtayned that great Bishoprick, and that therefore he might haue contented himselfe with those fauours, and not haue presumed thereupon the rather to encroach vpon the dignities of other Bishops. Also he signifyed to the Emperour, that Anatolius should neuer be able to make his Sea an Apostolicall Sea, or yet to increase it by the iniury, and offence of others; that the priuiledges of Churches being instituted by the Canons, and Decrees of the venerable Councell of Nice, could not be impeached, or changed by any impious attempts of his; that it pertayned to him (I meane to Pope Leo) in respect of his office, and charge, to looke to the obseruation of the Canons, and not to preferre one mans will before the common benefit of the whole Church; finally presuming as he saith, of the Emperours pious disposition to conserue the peace, and vnity of the Church, he besought: him to represse the ambition, and wicked attempt of Anatolius (if he persisted therein) and to make him obay the Canons of the Councell of Nice, for other wyse the issue would be, that Anatolius should but worke his owne separation from the communion of

the Vniuersall Church.
            30. To this effect wrote Pope Leo to the Emperour, crauing indeed with great reason, his help and assistance, for the correction, and amendment of Anatolius, yet with great grauity, and authority as you see, and not in vayne, as M. Andrewes would haue vs to suppose; for albeit the Emperour had fauoured greatly the pretence of Anatolius,
               
                  Relatio Synod. Chalced. ad Martian. in fine Concil.
                to prefer the Church of Constantinople before Alexandria, and Antioch, neuertheles vpon Pope Leo's letters to him, he not only yielded therein, but also greatly approued it in the sayd Pope, that he defended the Canons of the Councell of Nice with such constancy, and resolution, as he did; which is manifest by another letter of Pope Leo to the Emperour,
                  Leo. ep. 59. ad Martiā.
                wherein he signified the contentment, and ioy that he receaued, when he vnderstood by the Emperours letters, that he not only approued his defence of the Canons, but was also himselfe determined to defend them, and to conserue the priuiledges of the Churches, according to the decrees of the Nicen Councell. So that I hope M. Andrews cannot now say, that Pope Leo's intercessiō to the Emperour was in vayne. Let vs then see what manner of suite he made to the Empresse.
            31. He wrote also to her diuers Epistles, and in one of them hauing first taxed Anatolius of immoderate pryde,
               
                  Leo ep. 55. ad Pulcheriam.
                for seeking to passe the limits of his owne dignity, to the preiudice of other Metropolitās; signfying withall, that he might haue contented himself to haue byn aduanced to the Bishoprike of Constantinople, as well by his fauourable consent, and approbation, as by her, and the Emperours grant, he addeth touching the Canon now in question, Consensiones, saith he, Episcoporum Canonum apud Nicaeam conditorum regulis repugnantes,

vnita nobiscum vestrae fidei Pietate, in irritum mittimus, &amp; per auctoritatem B. Petri Apostoli generali prorsus definitione cassamus. The piety of your faith being vnited with vs, we do vtterly make voyde, and by the authority of the Blessed Apostle Peter, do with a generall definition wholy disanull the consents (that is to say the Decrees) of the Bishops, which were repugnant to the rules of the Canons made in the Councell of Nice. So he, speaking, as you see, not like a suppliant, sed tamquam potestatem habens, like a man that had power, and Apostolicall authority, to disanull, and abrogate this Canon, as he did.
            32. Now it resteth that we see,What intercession Pope Leo made to Anatolius what manner of petition, or supplication he presented to Anatolius, which truly was such, that it made him stoupe, as stout, and proud as he was. First then, Pope Leo blameth him for taking the occasion he did, to seeke not only to preferre himselfe before the Bishops of Alexandria
               
                  Leo. ep. 53. ad Anatol.
                and Antioch (as though their Churches had lost their priuiledges by the fall of their Pastors) but also to subiect them and all other Metropolitans of the Greeke Church to his iurisdiction; which he tearmeth inauditum, &amp; numquam antea tentatum excessum, an excesse neuer heard of, nor attempted by any man before. And further signifyeth, that this attempt being quite contrary to the most holy Canons of the Councell of Nice, was too wicked, and impious; that his haughty pryde tended to the trouble of the whole Church; that he had abused his brethren the Bishops in the Councell, who being assembled only for the definition, and decision of matters of faith, had been drawne by him, partly by corruption, and partly by feare, to fauour, and further his ambitious desires; that he accused himselfe

sufficiently when he acknowledged that the Legats of the Sea Apostolyke (whome he ought to haue obayed) publikly contradicted, and resisted him in the Councell.
            33. Moreouer he aduertiseth him, that the Canon pretended to haue been made some 60. yeares before in the Councell of Constantinople, could not serue his turne, seeing that the same was neuer sent, or intimated by any of his predecessors to the Roman Sea, &amp; therfore he wished him to remember what Christ threatneth to them, who scandalize any one of his litle ones, and thereby to consider what he deserueth, who feareth not to scandalize so many Churches, and Priests. Finally he exhorteth him to leaue his ambitious desires, concluding with this sentence of the Apocalyps:
                  Apoc. 3. 
               Tene quod habes, ne alius accipiat coronam tuam, hold that which thou hast, lest another take thy Crowne; for, si inconcessa quaesieris &amp;c. if thou seeke, saith he, those things that are vnlawfull, thou shalt depriue thy selfe of the peace, and vnion of the vniuersall Church by thy owne work, and iudgement. So he. And dost thou not see good Reader what an humble suppliant Pope Leo was to Anatolius? If one should write a letter to M. Andrewes in this style, and forme, would he take it, trow you, for a supplication?
            34. But now let vs see what effect it had, and whether it was in vayne,
               What effect Pope Leo's intercession had. or no, as M. Andrews affirmeth of it. This will be euident by the epistles of Pope Leo to Iulianus Bishop of Coa, to the Emperour, and to Anatolius himselfe. To the Bishop, he signifieth that the Emperour had written vnto him, interueniens saith he, pro Anatolio, vt nostri illi animi gratia praebeatur, quoniam correctionem eius promittit &amp;c.
               
                  Leo. ep. 68. Requesting in the behalfe

of Anatolius, that we will bestow vpon him the grace, or fauour of our affection,The Emperour made suite to Pope Leo for Anatolius. because he promiseth his amendment &amp;c. So that you see now, Iordanis conuersus est retrorsum, for whereas Pope Leo (according to M. Andrewes his assertions) was a suiter both to the Emperour, and to Anatolius, the Emperour is now become a suiter to Pope Leo for Anatolius, which will yet more cleerly appeare by another Epistle of Pope Leo to the Emperour himselfe,
                  Idem ep. 70. ad Martian.
                wherein he promised that Anatolius should find in him sincerae gratiae animum, an affection of sincere grace, or fauour, in case he followed sincerely the Emperours aduise, and counsell, and performed in hart, that which he promised in words; for that otherwyse he would resolutly proceed agaynst him, to chastise him for his pryde; wherby it is euident, that the Emperour had written to Pope Leo in the behalfe of Anatolius, and that Pope Leo would not otherwise promise him his grace, and fauour, but vpon condition of his harty repentance, and sincere amendment.
            35. And will you now see all this confirmed by Pope Leo's letters to Anatolius himselfe?
                  Leo. ep. 71. ad Anatol.
                Therfore wheras Anatolius had written a letter of submission to him, not only acknowledging his fault in that attempt,Anatolius his submission to Pope Leo but also yielding him an account of the state of his Church of Constantinople, Pope Leo answering the same, first commended greatly certayne predecessors of Anatolius, to wit Iohn, Atticus, Proclus, and Flauianus, exhorting him to imitate them, and blaming him by the way for his scandalous attempts, and hauing also signified how glad he was to vnderstand by his letters that he had reformed certayne abuses in the Church of Constantinople, he gaue him order withall to make two priests (called

               Andreas, and Euphratas) and to admit some others to Ecclesiasticall dignities, vpon certayne conditions which he prescribed him; and lastly comming to speake more particulerly of his presumptuous attempt, he saith, that whereas he layd the fault vpon the euill counsell, and perswasions of the Clergy of Constantinople, who vrged him vnto it, he might haue giuen better satisfaction if he had also blamed his owne consent thereto, and not haue layed the fault vpon others: neuertheles, saith he, gratum mihi, frater charissime, est &amp;c. It is gratfull to me (most deare brother) that you professe now to be displeased with that which then also should not haue pleased you. Your owne profession togeather with the attestation of the Christian Prince, is sufficient for our reconciliation, neyther doth your correction (or amendement) seeme to me to be ouerlate (or out of season) cui tam venerabilis assertor accessit, who haue so venerable a surety.
            36. Thus wrote Pope Leo to Anatolius, whereby it appeareth that M. Andrews saying that he did by his letters intercedere frustrà apud Augustum, Augustam, &amp; Anatolium, hath in two words made two lyes, the one in intercedere (for that the Pope made no intercession, or suite, especially to Anatolius, but was sued vnto by the Emperour in his behalfe:) The other in frustrà; for though it should be granted that the Pope made suite, yet it was not in vayne. And therefore if M. Andrews should seeke to quit himselfe of one of the lyes,A manifest and sound lye of M. Andrews. by saying that he tooke intercedere, for to make opposition, and not intercession, yet he cannot rid himselfe of the other lye (which is a sound one) seeing that Pope Leo's opposition was so far from being in vayne, that it brought Anatolius, as I may say, vpon his knees, and forced him to humble, and submit himselfe, to acknowledge

his fault, to promise amendment, yea to procure the Emperour to be a suiter, and intercessor for him; and finally to receiue, and execute Pope Leo's commandments, lawes, and ordinances in the Church of Constantinople, as though he had bene some Italian Bishop within the Suburbs of Rome. So that I hope, thou seest good Reader, that I haue now clearely proued 2. things. The one that M. Andrews hath sought notoriously to delude thee, in telling thee, that Pope L
                     •
                  o contradicted this Canon, in vayne. The other that the Emperour, and the whole Christian world had at that tyme a firme beliefe of the supreme authority of Pope Leo ouer the Councell of Calcedon, and the whole Church of God, seeing that his only opposition to this Canon sufficed to ouerthrow it.
            37. Whereupon it also followeth that although it were true which M. Andrews most falsely,Pope Leo his supreme authority proued by the ouerthrow of the Canon alledged by M. Andrews. and absurdly affirmeth (to wit, that the Fathers in the Councell of Calcedon meant by this Canon to make the Byshoprik of Cōstantinople, equal in all respects, with the Apostolicall Sea of Rome) yet it little importeth, yea rather maketh for vs, then for M. Andrews, seeing that the C
                     •
                  non was as I haue shewed, presētly ouerthrowne, and 
                  •
               ade voyd by the authority of the Roman Séa, and that 
                  •
               ot only Anatolius himselfe (who procured it) acknowledged his errour therin, but also, as well he, as other Catholike Bishops his successors liued in the vnion, and subiection of the sayd Roman Church, as I haue sufficiently shewed by the experience, and practise euen of the Greeke Church, vntill it was vtterly ruined by the Turks.
            
            38. Therefore it shall be now conuenient to see how well M. Andrews answereth, and satisfyeth the

places alledged by the Cardinall, and my selfe out of the Councell of Calcedon; whereby I shall also haue occasion to confute certayne reasons of his, which he further vrgeth out of the circumstances of the foresayd Canon.
               
                  Apol. Bellar. pag. 92. The first place, or authority, which he vndertaketh to answere, is, that in many Epistles, or rather supplications addressed to Pope Leo, and the whole Councell,
                  Concil. Calced. Act. 3. he is named before the Councell with this tytle: Sanctissimo &amp; Deo amantissimo, &amp; vniuersali Archiepiscopo, &amp; Patriarchae Magnae Romae Leoni, &amp; Sanctae, &amp; vniuersali Chalcedonensi Synodo,
               The name of Vniuersall Bishop giuen to the Pope by the generall Councell of Calcedon. 
               quae voluntate Dei congregata est: To the most holy, and most beloued of God, and vniuersall Archbishop, and Patriarke of Great Rome Leo, and to the holy and vniuersall Synode of Calcedon, which is assembled by the will of God. In which tytle it is to be obserued not only that the name of Pope Leo is set before the name of the Councell (whereby he is acknowledged to be superiour to the Councell) but also he is called Vniuersall Archbishop, and Patriarke of Rome, in respect of his vniuersall authority ouer the whole Church of God: besides that it is to be noted heerin, that the tytle of Vniuersall Bishop, so much impugned now by the Sectaries of this tyme, was vsualy giuen to the Bishops of Rome in the tyme of that Councell, seeing it was in the Councell it selfe diuers tymes vsed, and giuen to Pope Leo, without the contradiction of any.
            39. Hereto M. Andrews answereth thus: 
                  Cur huc illuc oberret quis &amp;c. why shall a man go vp and downe hither,
                     Andr. pag. 170. §. Quod ibi.
                   and thither, throughout all the corners of the Acts (of this Councell) searching the deskes, and looking on the backsyde of letters to find somewhere that whereof he readeth there the contrary in expresse

words? let him read (not in any tytle, or superscriptiō of a letter, or memoriall wherin euery man knoweth how suiters are wont to extoll, and magnify those to whome they sue) but let him read the matter ventilated, or debated in one whole action, and renewed, and confirmed in another, and finally enacted by a Canon &amp;c. so he: and then followeth that which I haue set downe out of him, and confuted before concerning the contents of the Canon.
            
            40. Heere now thou seest, good Reader, that this answere of his contayneth 3. poynts: the first that all this obiection is taken, as it were, out of the booke, being grounded on nothing els but on the superscriptions of letters, and memorials. The second, that the manner and style of the letters, and memorialls of suppliants, is alwayes to extoll, and magnify those to whome they make suite. The third, that a Canon of the same Councell decreed the contrary to all this in expresse words (giuing to the Bishop of Constantinople equal priuiledges in all things with the Bishop of Rome) this being the whole substance of his answere, and the last poynt concerning the Canon (which most importeth) being by me already fully confuted to his shame, it will easily be seene how he tryfleth in the two former.M. Andrews his tryfling answers. For as for the first, what skilleth it whether those tytles were written on the insyde, or outside of the supplications, seeing that they were taken, and set downe by the Notaries of the whole Coūcell, no lesse then the Canons, and Actions themselues, and not reproued, or contradicted by any? Is it not therefore cleare inough thereby, that the tytle of vniuersall Bishop was in those dayes vsually giuen to the Bishop of Rome? and seeing his name is set downe before the name of

the Councell (though he himselfe was not present, but only his Legats) was not he sufficiently acknowledged thereby to be the President, and head of the Councell?
            41. But I would be glad to know of M. Andrews what reason those suppliants had to addresse, and present their petitions rather to Pope Leo by name,M. Andrews hardly vrged. then to the Bishop of Constantinople, or to other Grecian Bishops, and Metropolitans of their owne country? Let him tell me, I say, what other reason they could haue, but because they held him not only to be the chiefe, and vniuersall Pastor (that is to say, to haue vniuersall authority) but also to be acknowledged by the whole Councell, as their head? For if the Councell had not so esteemed him, those suppliants might be assured that by naming him alone, and giuing him extraordinary tytles that were not due vnto him, they should offend the Councell, and consequently hurt their owne cause.
            42. Moreouer let M. Andrews tell vs, if it please him, why those suters should exceed in the tytle rather to Pope Leo, then to the whole Councell, seeing that they addressed their petitions to both? Why did they not, I say, magnify and extoll the Councell with some excessiue tytle, as well as the Pope? For, if it were needfull for them to vse excesse, and flattery to eyther of both, for the better successe of their petition, it is like they would haue done it rather to the whole Councell then to him, if they had not assured themselues, that the grant of their petition depended principally on him, as on the head of the Councell; so that the supplications being directed indifferently to both, and no excesse, or flattery so much as imagined by M. Andrewes
               
in that part of the tytle which concerneth the Councell, he must eyther acknowledg the like of the other part that toucheth the Pope, or els 
                  •
               ell vs some reason of the difference, whereof no other can be conceiued, but only his greater authority then the Councells in respect that he was their head and the vniuersall Pastor of the Church. And thus much touching his answere to the first place.
            43. The second place alledged by Cardinall Bellarmine out of that Councell,
                  Bellar. Apol. vbi supra.
                is, that in the Epistle of the whole Councell to Pope Leo, he is acknowledged in expresse words to be the head of all the Bishops assembled there, &amp; they his members, for thus they wrote speaking of themselues:
                  Relat. Synodi ad Leon. in fine Cōcilij.
                
               Quibus tu sicut membris caput praeeras: ouer whome thou wert President, as head ouer the members, in those which held thy place &amp;c. So they. And what doth M. Andrews, trow you, answere to this? Marry,
                  Andr. vbi supra.
                forsooth, he saith, that, vtcumque tum praefuit sicut caput &amp;c. howsoeuer he then gouerned as head, yet he could not hinder, but that another head was made equall to this head.
               A weake and idle answere of M. Andrews. So he; meaning that the Canon (whereof we haue hitherto treated) made the Bishop of Constantinople, equall with him in all things, and so made two heads. But how weake, and idle this answere is, thou mayst iudge, good Reader, by the weaknes of this Canon, which I haue sufficiently shewed, as well by the inualidity, and nullity of it (being abrogated by Pope Leo) as also by the false sense that M. Andrews hath giuen vs of it: so that the foundation of his answere (I meane the Canon) fayling him, his answere must needs fall to the ground, and be altogeather impertinent, and the place alledged by the Cardinall remayne in full force.

                  Card. Apolog. vbi supra.
               44. The third and last place, which he vndertaketh to answere, is, that the whole Councell also testifyed in the same Epistle to Pope Leo, that our Sauiour had committed to him the keeping of his vineyard,
               
                  Relat. Synodi ad Leon.
                that is to say, of his Church; whereto M. Andrews answereth, that the vineyard was indeed committed to him, but not to him alone,
                  Andr. vbi supra.
                
               sed cum alijs in vin
                     •
                  a operarijs, but toge
                     •
                  ther with other workmen in the vineyard, wherein he saith very truely, for no man denyeth, but that there were other Pastors in the Church besides Pope L
                     •
                  o, though we affirme that all other Pastors were inferiour, and subordinate to him; and I think no man doubteth but that when the charge, or gouernment of a temporall Commonwelth is committed to a King, or other soueraigne Prince, he doth not exercyse it alone, but togeather with other Magistrats subordinate and subiect to him: and the like we say of the supreme Pastor of the Church, that he is not the only Pastor, though he be chiefe, and supreme; which point I haue debated in the former Chapter,
                  See cap. 1. nu. 3.4.5. &amp; sequent
                where I confuted the like answere of M. Andrewes to our obiection of the Pastorall commission giuen by our Sauiour to S. Peter.
            
            45. Therefore I remit him, and the Reader to what I haue discoursed there, touching that poynt
                  •
                and wil also ad further heere cōcerning Pope Leo, that wheras M. Andrewes granteth his Pastorall authority, togeather with other Pastors (meaning that he had no more, nor other authority ouer the Church then other Bishops had) he is easily conuinced by the circumstances of the same place which the Cardinall obiecteth,
                  Relat. Synodi ad Leon.
                and he pretendeth now to answere; for there Dioscorus is accused of three things: the first, that he had taken vpon him to condemne, and depose Flauianus Bishop of Constantinople,
               
and Eusebius Bishop of Doryleum against the Canons of the Church. The second, that whereas Pope Leo had depriued Eutyches the heretyk of his dignity in the Church of Constantinople (where he was Abbot of a Monastery) Dioscorus had restored him thereto, and so, irruens in vineam &amp;c. breaking into the vineyard which he found notably well planted,
               A cleere testimony for Pope Leo's supremacy. 
               he ouerthrew it &amp;c. The thyrd was, that, post haec omnia, saith the Councell, insuper, &amp; contra ipsum &amp;c. And after all this, he did moreouer extend his madnes against him to whom the charge, or keeping of the vineyard was committed by our Sauiour, id est, contra tuam quoque Apostolicam Sanctitatem, that is to say, also against thy Apostolyke Holynes, meaning Pope Leo, for to him the Councell wrote this.
            46. Whereby it is euident that the Councell distinguisheth clearely betwixt the authority of Pope Leo, and of the two other Bishops Flauianus, and Eusebius, seeing that all three of them being named (as greatly iniured by Dioscorus) the offence agaynst Pope Leo is exaggerated much more then the iniury done to the other two, and held to proceed of meere madnes, &amp; fury. And albeit mention be made of the vineyard (as broken downe, and ouerthrowne by Dioscorus, in the depositiō of those two Catholik Bishops) yet only Pope Leo (who is honoured with the title of Apostolicall Sanctity) is acknowledged to haue had the charge of the vineyard committed to him by our Sauiour: which had bene said very impertinently of him alone, if those other two Bishops had as much charge of the vineyard as he Besids that the Councell testifieth in the same place, that Pope Leo depriued Eutiches (who was an Abbot in Constantinople) of his dignity, which he could not haue done out of his owne Diocesse in the Church of Constantinople,
               
if as well the Bishop of that Church, as Eutiches had not been subiect to him; whereto it may also be added, that, as Liberatꝰ testifieth, this Flauianus Bishop of Constantinople (for whose iniurious deposition Dioscorus is here accused by the Councell) appealed for remedy to Pope Leo,
               
                  Liberat. in Breuiar. cap. 12. acknowledging thereby that Leo was his superiour, and had also an vniuersall authority; for otherwyse the appeale from the Greeke Church to him had byn in vayne. So that M. Andrewes his glosse, allowing to Pope Leo no more authority, then to all other Pastors, is very absurd, and easily conuinced by the text it selfe.
            47. After this, he idly carpeth at the Cardinall, for saying that the Councell acknowledged Pope Leo to haue the charge totius vineae,
               
                  Andr. vbi supra p. 171. 
               of the whole vineyard, because totius is not in the text of the Councell: Nec totius vineae dicitur (saith M. Andrewes) sed commoda vox (totius) Cardinali visum est adijcere:
               
                  Andr. vbi supra.
                
               neyther is it said, of the whole vineyard, but the Cardinall thought good to add totius, because it is a commodious word for his purpose, whereby it seemeth that he would haue some vnwary Reader to imagin that the Cardinall had corrupted the text, by adding the word totius, whereas there is no such matter; for hauing alledged the words of the Coū
               cell, as they are (to wit, cui vineae custodia à Saluatore commissa est) he doth afterwards in his owne discourse, and for the explication therof, adde totius, saying, vbi fatentur totius vineae custodiam &amp;c. where they (to wit the Fathers of the Councell of Calcedon) do confesse that the charge of all the vineyard,
               
                  Apolog. C. Bellar. pag. 92. 
               was committed to the Pope. Thus saith the Cardinall, signifying that the Councell did meane, that Leo had the charge of the whole Church (which as I haue shewed) is most euident euen by all

the circumstances of the place.
            48. And therefore M. Andrewes supecting with great reason,
                  Andr. vbi supra.
                that this deuyse would serue him to litle purpose, thought best to grant, that totius vineae might be sayd in some sense. 
                  Et vel si totius, sayth he, nihil iuuaret &amp;c. Yea, and if it had bene sayd, totius vineae, it would help him nothing, seeing that whatsoeuer doth eyther violate the vnity, or trouble the peace of the whole Church, ad curam omnium ex aequo pertinet, non Leonis solùm, doth belong to the care of all men equally, and not of Leo only. So he; signifying that albeit Pope Leo might be sayd to haue had the Charge of the whole Church, yet it were to be vnderstood, that he had it no otherwyse,A strange paradoxe of M. Andrews. then all other men haue.
And why? Marry, forsooth, because all men are equally bound to haue care of the vnity and peace of the Church; which truly may passe for a very strange paradoxe, howsoeuer he vnderstandeth it, I meane, whether he extend the word omnium, to all men in generall (as he seemeth to do) or limit it to all Pastors only.
            49. For if he meane that all men ought to haue care of the vnity, and peace of the Church alyke, or in equall degree, he is most absurd, confounding all order, gouernment, and subordination in the Church, seeing that one speciall cause (if not the chiefest) why God ordayneth Pastors, and Gouernours therin, was to auoyd schismes, and to conserue it in peace, and vnity, as I haue proued amply in my 
                  See Supplem. c. 4. nu. 3.4.5. &amp; 6. 
               Supplement. I haue also shewed that M. 
               
                  Ibid. nu. 7.8. 
               Barlow vrgeth the same, in defence of his pretended Episcopall authority against the Puritans; wherto I may add, that M. Andrewes himself also approueth it els where, granting that S. Peter was appoynted head of the Apostles,
               
                  Andr. cap. 8. pag. 219. by our Sauiour,

vt schismatis tollatur occasio (as S. Hierome saith) that the occasion of schisme may be taken away:
                  Hieron. li. 1. cont. Iouin.
                yea and confesseth moreouer, that S. Peter had so much authority giuen him, as was necessary, for auoyding of schisme, and for the maintenance of peace and vnity: of which poynt I shall haue somewhat to say vnto him 
                  Chap. 3. nu. 37. &amp; seq.
                here after.
            50. If then Pastors, or gouernours are (by his owne confession) instituted in the Church to conserue the same in vnity, &amp; haue speciall authority giuen them to that end, he must needs confesse also, that they ought to haue more care thereof,Pastors are more bound to haue care of the Church then priuate men. then those who haue not any speciall institution, or authority to the same end; and therefore I would be glad to know, how he agreeth with himself in this poynt, teaching heere as he doth, that the care of the peace of the whole Church, doth belong to all men alyke? For if he say that Pastors are more bound, then theyr subiects, to care for the vnity of theyr owne particuler Diocesses, but not of the whole Church, he is too to ridiculous, seeing that euery Pastor ought to haue, not only as much care of the whole Church, as euery other man, but also much more then others, by reason of his function, &amp; office, which doth extend it selfe to the whole Church, it being euident that what authority soeuer any man hath in any part of the Church, it is giuen him for the good of the whole, and finally tendeth therto.
            51
                  •
                And who knoweth not, that all heresies, and schismes which violate the vnity of the whole Church, do first spring in some part thereof, and are to be suppressed, not in respect of that part only, but much more in regard of the whole Church? As in like manner we see in our bodyes that the care of the health, and conseruation

of euery member, tendeth more to the good of the whole, then of the part it selfe, that is, or may be particulerly interessed; &amp; therefore euery part doth willingly expose it selfe to danger for the conseruation of the whole. Whereupon I inferre, that if Pastors haue more obligation, then lay-men, to haue care of a part of the Church, they are consequently more bound to haue care of the whole, whereto (as I haue sayd) the care of euery part is specially to be referred.
            52. Moreouer whosoeuer is Pastour in any one part of the Church, is capable of Pastorall iurisdiction in any other, though he be restrayned, and limited to a certayne part, to auoyd confusion: in which respect the Priests in euery Diocesse are Priests throughout the whole Church, and may minister Sacraments any where in cases of necessity; and a Bishop in any place is euerywhere a Bishop, and one of the Magistrats, and Pastors of the Church, and therefore hath a voyce, and right of suffrage in all Generall Councells though they be held out of his Diocesse; whereas none of the Laity hath any voyce, or suffrage therein at all, as it is manifest by the testimony of Theodosius the Emperour in his Epistle to the Councell of Ephesus;
                  Ep. Theodo

Andrews will be ashamed to say.
            53. Therefore he must confesse, that albeit euery member of the mysticall body of Christ be bound to haue a speciall care of the vnity of the whole,
                  1. Cor. 12. 
               vt not sit schisma in corpore, sed in idipsum pro inuicem sollicita sint membra: That there be no schisme, or diuision in the body, but that the members togeather be carefull one of another: yet this obligation extendeth no further then the condition, quality, and degree of euery one requyreth, which we may learne by the Apostles doctrine to the Romans,
               
                  Rom. 12.
who hauing signified that we haue many members in one body, and that all the members haue not the same action, addeth: 
                  ita multi vnum corpus sumus in Christo &amp;c. So we being many, are one body in Christ, &amp; ech one anothers members, &amp; hauing gifts according to the grace, that is giuen vs different eyther Prophesy according to the rule of faith, or ministery in ministring, or he that teacheth in doctrine he that exhorteth in exhorting, he that giueth in simplicity, he that ruleth in carfulnes,
                  Pastours bound more then other men to haue care of the Church according to the doctrine of the Apostle. he that sheweth mercy in cheerfulnes.
            
            54. Thus far the Apostle, who exemplifying heere, as you see, the different gifts, and graces that God bestoweth vpon sundry members of his mysticall body, and ascribing to euery one of them the proper talent which is requisit thereto, requyreth specially in the Gouernour Solicitude and Carefulnes, giuing plainely to vnderstand, that although euery member of Christs Church, ought to be sollicitous, and carefull for the

publike good thereof; yet a Pastor, or Gouernour is most bound thereto, as to that which most properly pertayneth to his charge, &amp; vocation. As for example in the tyme of the Apostles the heresy of the Nicolaits did violate the vnion, and trouble the peace of the whole Church; and albeit there were in the Church of Pergamus, as well Prophets, Doctors, Preachers, and Priests, as other faithfull people, who were all bound to haue care of the vnity of the whole Church (as all Christians are) neuertheles we see in the Apocalyps that none of them but the Bishop only,
                  Apoc. 2. was reprehended for negligence, and want of due care to find and cast out the Nicolaits from amongst them, because the sollicitude, and care of the vnity, and publike good of the Church did specially belong to the Pastour, or Bishop, in which respect he alone was seuerely reproued, and commanded to do pennance.
            55. So that whereas M. Andrews imposeth an equal obligation of the same care vpon euery member, what doth he els but make, as I may say, a gally-maufrey,
               M. Andrews galli-maufrey or hotch-potch. or hotch-potch of the different members of Christs mysticall body confounding their seuerall functions, and making them all eyes, or heads, requyring the obligation of a Pastor, or Gouernor in euery particuler man? And truly if this doctrine were generally imbraced in England,
               M. Andrews teacheth seditious doctrine. what other fruit could be expected thereof, but confusion, tumult, and sedition, whyles euery gyddy-headed fellow perswading himselfe, that he were as much bound to care for the publike good of the Church, as the Pastors thereof (yea as the supreme head, or Gouernour himselfe) might intrude himselfe to intermeddle in Ecclesiasticall affayres for the discharge of his conscience, and obligation? For if his

band in that behalfe were equal with the band of Pastors, he could not with reason be denyed equality with them in charge, and commission; seeing that equality of obligation requireth equality and parity of power to performe it,Equality of obligation requireth equality of care. for when power of performance wanteth, the obligation ceaseth. So that a greater power and dignity induceth an obligation of greater care; and therefore let M. Andrews consider what a wise, and learned proposition he hath made, and published to the world, and what a good and vigilant Pastour he is, who teacheth such dangerous, and seditious doctrine.
            56. And albeit (to auoyde this absurdity) he should restrayne his generall propositiō to Pastors only, and say, that whatsoeuer violateth the vnity of the whole Church doth belong equally to the care of all Pastors; yet he were no lesse ridiculous then before, seeing that he must needs acknowledge an inequality of obligation, and care euen amongst them, according to their different degrees. For if a Patriarke haue iurisdiction ouer Metropolitans, and they ouer Bishops, and Bishops ouer Priests, it is cleare, that as their charge, and degree is vnequal; so also is the obligation of euery one of them different, and conforme to his dignity, degree, and authority. And therefore although the office and duty of euery Pastour, is, as I haue sayd, to haue special care of the vnity, and peace of the Church, yet his obligation in that behalfe must needs be so much the greater, by how much his power, and authority is greater, and he more able to performe it then others his inferiours, to which purpose the Prophet saith of a Prince, or supreme Pastor: Princeps ea quae sunt digna Principe cogitabit,
               
                  Isa. 32. 
               &amp; ipse super Duces stabit:
               
The Prince shall thinke those things which are worthy of a Prince, and he shall be ouer Dukes, or captaynes. So saith Isay of our Sauiour (as some expound it) or, as others say, of Iosias King of Iuda.
            
            57. But of whom soeuer it is to be vnderstood, it is manifest inough, that the forme of a good Pastor, or Gouernour is prescrybed therein, shewing that the Prince being the supreme Gouernour, is to imbrace cogitations, and thoughtes fit for his estate, and as much excelling the cogitations of his Dukes, or Captaynes (that is to say of his inferiour, or subordinate Magistrats) as he excelleth them in degree; and what thought is so worthy of a Prince, as the care of the vnity, and peace of his estate, wherein consisteth the publyke, and generall good of euery Common welth? And the like is to be sayd of Pastors, and especially of the supreme Pastor of the Church,If M. Andrews his position be true he must lay away his tytle of Lord Bishop. who ought (according to the Prophet) to haue cogitations worthy of his soueraignty, that is to say, as much to surpasse other inferiour Pastors in the care of the publike good of the Church, as he surpasseth them in power, and dignity. Well then to conclude, if M. Andrews his position may go for currant, he may shake hands with the Puritans, and lay away his tytle of Lord Bishop, &amp; become follow Minister with his Ministers in the Diocesse of Ely; seeing that there is no reason why he should haue a greater degree, and dignity in the Church then they, if they be bound to haue as great a care of the Church as he.
            58. But let vs see how he proceedeth to fortify his assertion,
                  Andr. cap. 7. pag. 171. in hope vtterly to ouerthrow the Popes Primacy. Thus then he saith:

                  Quòd enim totius vineae, id est, Ecclesiae, custodiam ab ipso Christo ait Pontifici commissam,

id est Primatum &amp;c.
                For whereas the Cardinall saith that the charge of all the vineyard,M. Andrews corrupteth the text of the Councel of Calcedon. that is to say of the Primacy of the Church, was committed by Christ himselfe to the Bishop, see how it contradicteth the Councell, and the sentence of all the Fathers that were there present, who with one voyce, sayd: 
                  Siqua essent Romanae Sedis priuilegia, ea illi (non à Christo, nesciebant hoc Chalcedonenses quin) à Patribus concessa esse &amp;c.
               
If the Roman Sea had any priuiledges the same were granted vnto it (not by Christ, for they in the Councell of Calcedon knew not that) but by the Fathers &amp;c. So he: grounding still, as you see, all the force, and weyght of his arguments vpon no better foundation then his owne fraud, I meane his fraudulent allegation, and exposition of that Canon of the Councell, wherof I haue amply treated before; and now he secondeth his former fraud with a new corruption of the text, setting this downe in a different letter for the very words of the Councell,M Andrews groundeth his arguments vpon his owne fraud. 
               siqua essent Romanae sedis priuilegia, ea illi à Patribus concessa esse, if there were any priuiledges of the Roman Sea, they were granted to it by the Fathers: whereas neyther those words, nor yet the sense thereof are to be found in the 28. Canon, which he alledgeth, no nor in all the Councell of Calcedon.
            
            59. For in these generall words of his are included all the priuiledges that the Sea of Rome had any way eyther by diuyne, or human law, for any respect or cause whatsoeuer, but the Canon speaketh with great restriction,
                  Act. 15. ca
                        •
                     . 28. to wit, of priuiledges granted vpon one consideration only; for thus it saith: Etenim antiquae Romae throno, quòd Vrbs illa imperaret, iure Patres priuilegia tribuere: For the Fathers did worthily giue priuiledges to the throne of old Rome, because that Citty did

gouerne. Thus saith the Canon, far otherwyse then M. Andrews affirmeth, who with his (siqua) comprehendeth all priuiledges whatsoeuer; whereas you see the Canon speaketh only of priuiledges giuen to the Roman Church, in respect of the Imperiall Seat; so that other priuiledges might be giuen thereto for other respects, for ought we see in this Canon; and the reason is cleare, why that consideration of the Imperial Seat was only mentioned, and no other, to wit, because those that penned the Canon, saw well inough, that the Church of Constantinople could pretend no other reason to demand extraordinary priuiledges, but only because the Imperiall Seat, which was wont to be at Rome, was then remoued to Constantinople.
            
            60. Therefore I beseech thee (good Reader) consider a little M. Andrews his silly discourse, concerning this point, who (hauing sayd, as you haue heard, that the Fathers in the Councell of Calcedon knew not any priuiledges granted to the Roman Sea by Christ) addeth: 
                  Quare autem concessa &amp;c?A silly collection of M. Andrews. And why were they granted? Was it because Christ sayd to Peter, Tibi dabo claues, aut, Pasce oues meas? I will giue thee the keyes, or, feed my sheep? No; but because Rome was then the Seat of the Emperour, and gouerned the rest. So he; and a litle after he concludeth thus:A difference to be noted betwixt the primacy of S. Peter, and the priuiledgs granted to the Roman Sea. 
               
                  Quod ergo habet Roma de Primatu &amp;c.
Therefore that which Rome hath of the Primacy, is not from Christ, but from the Fathers, and in respect of the Emperours Seat, and not for the Sea of Peter.
               
            
            61. VVhereto I answere, first that M. Andrews must learne to distinguish betwixt the Primacy of S. Peter, and the priuiledges granted to the Sea of Rome, for that the sayd Primacy could not be from any, but

from Christ himselfe; whereas the Roman Church may haue, and hath priuiledges from men, that is to say not only from generall Councells, but also from temporall Princes, as from Constantine, Pepin, Charles the Great, and other Catholike Princes, and therefore M. Andrews argueth most absurdly from the Priuiledges, to the Primacy, denying that the Primacy was from Christ, because the Priuiledges were from men, and some of them giuen for humane respects; wherin he sheweth himselfe as wyse, as if he should deny the regalty, and soueraignty of our Kings, by reason of the prerogatiues, and priuiledges granted to them by the Parliaments; or as if he should say, that the Church of Christ (which is his Spouse) was not instituted by him, but by men, because aswell temporall Princes, as generall Councells haue giuen great priuiledges thereto.
            62. Secondly I say, that M. Andrewes is very simple if he see not,Why those which penned the Canō alledged by M. Andrews, made no mention of the keys, and Pastorall commissiō giuen to S. Peter. that the pēners of the Canon had great reason to auoyd therein all mention of the keyes, and of the Pastorall commission giuen by our Sauiour to S. Peter, as also of the Priuiledges granted to the Roman Church in respect of S. Pet
                     •
                  rs Sea; seeing that the same could not any way further the pretence of the Bishop of Constantinople, but rather hinder it. For what could he demaund for any of those respects? Would M. Andrews haue had him to say that because Christ gaue S. Peter the keyes and commission to feed his sheepe, therefore it was conuenient that the Councell should also giue the lyke authority to the Bishop of Constantinople, or prefer him before the Bishop of Alexandria, and Antioch (which was in deed his demaund?) how would this conclusion follow of those premisses? Whereas

the other consequent was not so euill, to wit, that because the Roman Church had ben in tymes past priuiledged by reason of the Imperiall Seat, it was conuenient, that also the Church of Constantinople should haue like priuiledges for the same reason.
            63. Agayne, what should the Bishop of Constantinople haue gayned by mentioning priuiledges granted to Peters Sea? Should he not haue hindred his owne cause thereby, and pleaded against himselfe for Alexandria, and Antioch? For who knoweth not, that S. Peter was Bishop of Antioch, some yeares before he came to Rome, and that he made his disciple S. Marke Bishop of Alexandria, in which respect those two Churches had alwayes the preheminence before all other next after the Roman? seeing then the Bishop of Constantinoples pretence was no other, but to be preferred before the Bishops of Alexandria, and Antioch, he had no lesse reason to forbeare all mention of Peters Sea,M. Andrews his fraud in alledging the Canon and of the priuiledges granted thereto, then M. Andrews had in setting downe the substance of the Canon, to conceale, and omit all that which would haue discouered his fraud, and ouerthrowne his cause (I meane that the second place after Rome was granted by that Canon to the Church of Constantinople) and therefore he was not so simple to touch that string, which would haue mard all his musick, as it hath been partly signifyed before, and will further appeare by that which followeth.
            64. For hauing sayd that which you haue heard before concerning priuiledges granted by the Fathers to the Roman Sea (because Rome was then the Imperial Citty) he addeth:
                  Andr. vbi supra.
               
               
                  in sua autem iam potestate esse, ex eadem ratione &amp;c. The Fathers of the Councell signifyed that it was now in their power for the same reason,

(seeing that Constantinople did enioy both the Imperiall Seate, and Senate) to aduance it also to equal dignity; and for as much as it was equall in all other things, to make it equal also in Ecclesiasticall matters, and, to vse their owne words, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , that is to say, to be magnifyed as Rome was.
               
So he: wherein he not only falsifieth the sense, and meaning of the Canon (in that he maketh it to giue an absolute equality to the Church of Constantinople, with that of Rome) but also craftily leaueth out all mention of the second place after Rome,
               
                  Can. 28. which was granted to the Church of Constantinople by that Canon, &amp; doth immediatly follow the Greeke words which he alledgeth, and ouerthrow all the equality that he pretendeth, to be mentioned there; for after 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , these words do follow immediatly in the Greeke, 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , which in our Latin copyes is very well translated word for word, secundam post illam existentem, that is to say, being the second after it: whereby it is signifyed, that the Church of Constantinople (which had wont to haue an inferiour place to diuers other Churches) should from thenceforth be the second after Rome. And did not M. Andrews, trow you, see this in the Greeke, and Latin? And if he saw it, with what conscience could he so deepely dissemble it, as not only to leaue out all mention of it, but also to make an equality, and parity in dignity, and in all things els betwixt the Churches of Rome, and Constantinople? Wheras the words which he concealed do make it cleare, that the equality mentioned in the Canon, must needs be vnderstood only according to distributiue iustice, that is to say, without impeachment, or preiudice of the different degrees, and dignityes of the two Churches,

as I haue amply declared before.
            65. And as for the Greeke words which he cyteth to fortify his forgery, they do not extend so far, as he would stretch them (I meane) to make a parity, and equality in dignity; for whereas the Greeke text saith, that Constantinople should be magnifyed, as Rome was, the same may very well stand with the foresayd equality, which distributiue Iustice ordayneth (to wit, with the reseruation of the different dignityes of the one, and the other) as when a Noble man, and a meane man do concurre in one act, or seruice to the Common welth, and both of them are rewarded, and aduanced according to their different qualityes, it may truly be sayd that the meane man is aduanced as the Noble man is, though not to the same degree, for both of them are aduanced, as well the one, as the other, and yet they are not made equal in dignity.
            66. But now if we take the Greeke wordes alleaged by M. Andrews, or the Latin in our translation, with the restriction that immediately followeth (wherby the second place after Rome is assigned to Constantinople) it is most cleare,M. Andrews streyneth the Greek text to make it serue his turne. that they cannot possibly signify (as he would haue them) parificare, &amp;, ad parem dignitatem euehere, &amp;, ad paris magnitudinis instar efferre, which words and manner of speach do exclude all that diffe
                  •
               rence of degree, and dignity which is expresly reserued in the Canon, giuing the second place to Constantinople: so that you see, he is in all this matter most fraudulent, and hath notably corrupted the Canon, aswell by concealing that which most imported, to shew the full drift therof, as also by peruerting both the words, and the sense of it.
            67. It resteth now, that I say somewhat more to

his conclusion,
                  Andr. pag. 171. which is this: Quod habet ergo Roma de primatu &amp;c. therfore that which Rome hath of the primacy, it hath not from Christ, but from the Fathers, and in respect of the seat of the Emperour,A very false and foolish conclusiō of M. Andrews. and not for the seat of Peter; and forasmuch as the Fathers in aduancing new Rome to equall greatnes, exercised the same power which they vsed in honouring old Rome, therfore he is farre from the faith, who affirmeth, that the primacy of the Bishop of Rome is according to the faith, and religion of the Councell of Chalcedon. So he; concluding as you see two things, the one concerning the primacy of the Roman Sea (which he saith was not giuen by Christ, but, by the Fathers, and not in respect of Peters Seat, but, for the seat of the Emperour:) wherto I haue said inough in effect already, hauing taught him to distinguish betwixt the Primacy of the Roman Sea granted by Christ to S. Peter, and the priuiledges which the Fathers, or temporall Princes haue giuen therto; for of the former, to wit, the Primacy of S. Peters Sea, the Canon speaketh not at all (because the mention of it would haue bene nothing to the purpose of the Canon, but rather against it, as I haue sufficiently declared:) and therfore this part of the conclusion is cleane from the matter, and cannot possibly be drawne from the Canon wherupon he groundeth all his arguments.
            68. The other part is also no lesse friuolous then the former, for whereas he concludeth that the Fathers of the Councell of Calcedon held not the Primacy of the Bishop of Rome for a matter of faith, or Religion, because they made the Church of Constantinople equal with the Roman Sea, you see that all the equality wherupon he buyldeth, is but his owne fiction, and repugnant to that very Canon, which he layeth for his foundation;

and yet forsooth, he is not ashamed to triumph and insult against the Cardinall, exacting of him some Canon of the Councell of Chalcedon for the Popes Primacy, as though he himselfe had knockt him downe with a Canon: for thus he saith for an vpshot, and final conclusion of all this matter.
            69. 
                  Nec alieunde igitur tamquam è vepreculis extrahat nescio quid,
                  
                     Andr. vbi supra.
                   
                  &amp; arrodat &amp;c.
Therefore let not (the Cardinall) draw, I know not what, out of some place, as it were, out of the bryers, and gnaw vpon it; let him giue vs a Canon (for the Canons are the voyce of the Councell) not out of the superscription of an Epistle,
                  Wisely forsooth. or some corner of a period, or perhaps some peece of a tytle, or fragment of a little clause. So he; wherein thou seest, good Reader, how he bestirreth himselfe with his diminitiues, or (to vse a phrase of M. Barlows) with his Hypocoristicall alleuiations, extenuating all that the Cardinall hath obiected, as meere tryfles, and calling for a Canon, because the Canons are the very voyce of the Councell, and so he would haue vs to suppose of his counterfait Canon (I say counterfait, in respect that he hath abused, mangled, and peruerted it as you haue seene) which therefore is so far from being the voyce of the Councell, that it is nothing els but a loud, and lewd lye of his owne.
            70. For the Canon it selfe, being taken as it is in the Councell, vtterly ouerthroweth his cause, seeing that it giueth the second place to Constantinople after Rome,
               The Canō alledged by M. Andrews ouerthroweth his cause
                     •
                  
                and therefore acknowledgeth the Primacy of the Roman Sea: besids that although it had ben such as M Andrews would haue it to be, yet Pope Leo's authority sufficed to disanul it euen in the Iudgment of Anatolius himselfe, who hauing been the cause, and authour

of it, acknowledged his errour therein and craued pardon for the same, as I haue amply declared before. And although after the earnest endeuours of diuers as well Catholike, as Hereticall Emperours to aduance the Church of Constantinople, and some schismes also raysed for that cause, the Popes permitted the second place to the Bishops of that Sea, whithout further opposition (especially from the tyme of Iustinian the Emperour, which was about a 100. yeares after the Councell of Calcedon, yea and afterwards also Pope Innocentius the third ratifyed,
                  Concil. Lateran. sub Innocent. 3. cap. 5. and confirmed it by a Canon in the great Councell of Lateran) yet the supreme authority of the Sea Apostolike was no way preiudiced thereby, as it appeareth euidently by the relation, which I haue made before of the subiection, and obedience of the Catholike Emperours,
                  See before from num. 1
                     •
                  . to nu. 24. and Bishops of Constantinople to the Sea of Rome from tyme to tyme, vntill the Greeke Empyre was vtterly ruyned by the Turkes. So that it is euery way manifest that the Canon of the Councell of Calcedon alledged by M. Andrewes hath serued him to no other purpose, but to bewray his impudency, fraud, and folly.

               71. And wheras he demaundeth of the Cardinall some Canon of that Councell, for the proof of the Popes Supremacy, he sheweth himselfe very idle to exact a Canon, for a matter that was not then in question, but professed by the whole Councell, as it euidently appeareth by their Epistle to Pope Leo wherin they acknowledge that he being ordayned to be the interpeter of the voyce of Blessed Peter to all men,

truth to the children of the Church; that Christ had prepared for them that spirituall banquet (meaning their Synod) by his Letters; that he by his Legates had gouerned them in that Councell, as the Head gouerneth the members; that the keeping of the Vineyard was committed to him by our Sauiour; and that he had depriued Eutyches the heretike of his dignity in Constātinople,

                  . which as I haue declared before, he could not haue done, if his authority had not bene vniuersall.
            72. And then comming to speake of the Canon which they had made in fauour of the Church of Constantinople, they signified the trust and confidence they had, that as he was wont by his carefull gouernment to cast forth the beames of his Apostolicall light euen to the Church of Constantinople, so he would now condescend to confirme, that which they had ordayned concerning the said Church, for the auoyding of confusion, and mayntenance of Ecclesiasticall Discipline, which Discourse they end with this most humble, and submissiue petition: Haec sicut propria, &amp; amica, &amp; ad decorem conuenientissima, dignare complecti Sanctissime, &amp; Beatissime Pater: most holy and blessed Father vouchsafe to imbrace these things, as your owne, and friendly, and most conuenient, or fit for good order.

            76. To which purpose it is to be considered that one of the chiefe causes of the assembly of that Councell, was to depose Dioscorus,

                  . Bishop of Alexandria, which done by the sentence of Pope Leo, pronounced by his Legates in these words:Dioscorus Patriarke of Alexandria deposed by Pope Leo. 
               
                  Sanctissimus, &amp; Beatissimus Archiepiscopus magnae &amp; senioris Romae Leo, per nos, &amp; per presentem sanctam Synodum, vnà cum ter beatissimo, &amp; omni laude digno beato Petro Apostolo, qui est petra &amp; crepido Ecclesiae, &amp; ille qui est rectae fidei fundamentum, nudauit eum tam Episcopatus dignitate, quàm etiam ab omni Sacerdotali alienauit ministerio.
The most holy, and most blessed Archbishop of the elder and great Rome Leo, hath depriued him (to wit Dioscorus) as well of all Episcopall dignity, as priestly ministery, by vs and this holy Synod, togeather with the thrice most blessed, and prayse-worthy Peter the Apostle, who is the rock and top of the Church, and he which is the foundation of the true faith.
This was the sentence giuen by the Popes Legats against Dioscorus; which sentence euery Bishop in the Councell not only approued particulerly with his suffrage, or voyce, but also confirmed with his subscription,Three things to be noted in the depositiō of Dioscorus prouing Pope Leo's supremacy. as it appeareth in the 3. Action of the sayd Councell.
            77. Wherein it is to be obserued. First; that Pope Leo deposed Dioscorus by the Synod, whereupon it followeth, that he was president, and head thereof, and that the sayd Synod was but, as it were, his instrument, in that deposition. Secondly, that he deposed him by the authority which he had, as successor to S.

Peter; in which respect it is sayd here that he did it, togeather with the most blessed Apostle Peter. Thyrdly, that for as much as S. Peter is heere acknowledged to be the head of the Church (as being the rock, and top thereof, and the foundation of the faith) the like must needs be granted of Pope Leo who was his successor, and exercysed his authority. Lastly, seeing that this sentence of deposition giuen against Dioscorus in this manner, and with these circumstances, was receiued particulerly, and subscrybed by euery one in that Coū
               cell, without any contradiction, or exception taken to any part thereof, it is euident, that the whole was conforme to the faith, and beliefe of the Councell, and consequently that they held Pope Leo not only for S. Peters successor,

                  . but also for head of the whole Church; and this I trust cannot be sayd to be taken out of the bryars, or corner of a period, or fragment of a clause, but out of one of the most principall, and important Acts of all the Councell.
            78. Also it appeareth in the same Councell that Theodoretus Bishop of Cyrus (who being deposed by Dioscorus, appealed to Pope Leo) was by his authority restored to his seat,
                  Ep. Theodor. ad Leonem.
                and admitted into the Councell: Ingrediatur, say the Fathers, &amp; Reuerendissimus Episcopus Theodoretus &amp;c. Let also the most Reuerend Bishop Theodoretus enter, that he may be partaker of our Synod, because the most holy Archbishop Leo hath restored to him his Bishopricke.
               Theodoretus restored to his Bishoprike by Pope L
                     •
                  o. So they; whereby they gaue sufficient testimony of the soueraygnty of Pope Leo, acknowledging his power to restore Bishops to their Bishopriks in the Greeke Church. Finally if there were nothing els in that Councell to proue Pope Leo's supreme, and vniuersall authority ouer the Church of God, it might

suffice for an euident proofe thereof,Pope Leo was vndoubtedly the head and president of the Coū
                  cell. that he was vndoubtedly the president, and head of the Councell, as you haue heard before, and may be confirmed by the subscriptions of his Legats set before all other Bishops, though one of them was but a Priest, and no Byshop.
            79. For what reason can be imagined why Pope Leo should be president of a Councell in Greece, so far from his owne seat (as well he himselfe as his Legats being Romans,
               Caluin confuted cōcerning the cause why Pope Leo was president of the Councell. and of the Latin Church) but that it belonged to him to be head thereof, in respect of his vniuersall authority? Will M. Andrews absurdly say as Caluin doth, that there was no Bishop in all Greece at that tyme, held to be worthy of that Honour? How then was Anatolius Bishop of Constantinople able to procure such a Canon, as he did, in his owne fauour? Can any man belieue that he was (as M. Andrews saith) esteemed worthy to be made equal in dignity, and all things els with the Bishop of Rome, and yet not fit to be President of a Councell in his owne country, yea lesse fit then a stranger, who was held to be but his 
                  •
               qual? Besides that howsoeuer Pope Leo himselfe might be esteemed more worthy of that Charge, then the Bishops of Greece (in respect of his eminent learning, wisdome, and vertue) yet there is no probability in the world,Pope Leo head of the Coūcel of Calcedō in respect of his supreme authority ouer the whole Church. that the Emperour, and all the Bishops of that Councell (which were aboue 600.) had the like conceit of the sufficiency of his Legats, or that they would all of them yield as well to them, as to him (one of them being but a Priest:) This, I say, is so improbable that M. Caluin, and M. Andrews must eyther giue vs some other probable reason for it (as they shall neuer be able to do) or els confesse that Leo was President

of that Councell by right of his soueraignty, and supreme authority ouer Gods Church.
            80. Therefore now to conclude this matter, thou seest, good Reader, what was the beliefe of the Fathers in the Councell of Calcedon concerning the Popes supremacy, and how far M. Andrews is from their faith, and Religion, yea and what a seared conscience he hath,What a seared cō
                  science M. Andrew
                     •
                   hath. not only to deny such an euident truth as this, but also to impugne it, with so much fraud, and impudency as he doth against his owne conscience (no doubt:) for he could not possibly see in the Councell, that which he himselfe alledgeth and the Cardinall obiecteth, but he must needs see all this which I haue cyted out of it: neyther could he alledge some part of the 28. Canon, and vrge it as he doth (laying downe the words euen of the Greeke text) but he saw as well that which followeth immediatly (and clearely conuinceth his fraud, and forgery) as that which went before, and seemed to make for him; whereby it is euident that he not only wittingly dissembled, and concealed the whole drift of that Canon, but also maliciously peruerted, mangled, and falsifyed it, to the end to deceiue his Reader, for the mayntenance of his miserable cause; for so I may well tearme it, seeing it dryueth him to such miserable and desperate shifts.
         
         
            
            M. D. ANDREVVS HIS ANSVVERES TO three places of the Fathers are examined. AND By the way the Cardinall is cleared from a false imputation of Iouinians heresy, and M. Andrews truly charged therewith. Finally all that which we teach concerning the Popes authority is necessarily deduced out of M. Andrews his owne doctrine, and expresse words.

                  Suppl. cap. 4. nu. 3. &amp; 4. I alledged two places of S. Cyprian, and S. Hierome, which the Cardinall also cyteth in his Apology, togeather with diuers other testimonies of

the Fathers, to proue the Primacy of S. Peter, and for as much as M. Andrews his answere thereto (if it haue any force at all) maketh as much against me, as against the Cardinall,
               
                  Apol. Card. Bel. cap. 8. p. 125. Cypriā. de vnit. Eccles.
                I will examine heere what force, and pith it hath. The Cardinall saith thus of S. Cyprian. Fecit Cyprianus Petrum &amp;c. Cyprian made Peter the head, fountayne, and roote of the Church: and in his Epistle to Quintus: Peter, saith he, whome our Lord first chose, and vpon whome he buylt his Church &amp;c.
Where S. Cyprian doth not only say,
                     Idem ep. ad Quintum.
                   that Peter was first chosen, but also addeth that the Church was buylt vpon him; and truely the foundation in a buylding, &amp; the head in a body are all one.
Thus saith the Cardinall, alledging, as you see, two places of S. Cyprian, to both which M. Andrews meaneth to say somewhat.
            2. To the first he saith thus,
                  Andr. Resp. cap. 8. pag. 217. 
                     
                        •
                     in. penult.
                
               
                  Fecit Cyprianus &amp;c. Cyprian made Peter the head, fountayne, and roote of the Church, not Peter of the Church, but rather maketh the Church it selfe the fountayne from whence many brookes,M. Andrews graue discourse in answere to the Cardinall. the light from whence many beames, and the roote from whence many boughs are propagated. Learne this euen of himselfe; Sic &amp; Ecclesia Domini luce perfusa &amp;c. So the Church being wholy resplendent with the light of our Lord, casteth forth her beames throughout the whole world (loe, he sayth the Church, and not Peter) yet the light is one, and the selfe same which is spread euery where (is this light Peter? or is he euery where spread abroad?) and the vnity of the body is not separated. The Church through the plenty of her fertility stretcheth forth her branches ouer the whole earth, and doth amply spread abroad her aboundant flowing brookes, yet the head is one, the beginning one, &amp; one mother, copious with the prosperous successe of her fecundity, or fruitfulnes. Caligauit hic

Cardinalis &amp;c the Cardinall was spurre-blynd, or dimme sighted here, for (I thinke) he will not say, that Peter is the mother, and therefore not the head.
               
            
            3. This is M. Andrews his graue discourse, supposing, as it seemeth, that because the word mater is applyed to the Church by S. Cyprian, therefore Caput cannot be applyed to S. Peter, but to the Church. Therfore to the end M. Andrews may vnderstand that S. Peter (and not the Church it selfe) is in this place worthily tearmed by S. Cyprian, caput, fons, radix, &amp; origo, the head, the fountayne, the roote, and the spring, he shall do well to consider the ground and drift of all S. Cyprians discourse, which the Cardinall in his Apology omitted for breuityes sake, and therefore although I haue layd it downe in my Supplement, to proue the necessity of a visible head in the Church, yet I will take paynes to repeat it heere, to ease the Reader of the labour to seeke it there.
            4. S. Cyprian meaning to shew the cause, why the Church is troubled with heresyes,The drift and meaning of S. Cyprian. and schismes, and withall to giue the remedy, saith thus: 
                  Hoc eò fit &amp;c. This hapneth, because men do not returne to the beginning of truth, nor seeke the head, nor obserue the doctrin of the heauenly Maister,
                  
                     Cyprian vbi supra.
                   
                  which if any man will well consider, and examine, he shall not need any longer treatise, or arguments to proue it; the proofe is easy to be belieued by the compendiousnes, or breuity of the truth; our Lord sayd to Peter,
                  
                     Matth. 1.6. 
                  I say vnto thee, thou art Peter, and vpon this rock I will buyld my Church, and the gates of hell shall not ouercome it &amp;c.
                  
                     Ioan. 21. To him also he saith after his resurrection, Feede my sheepe: vpon him being one, he buylt his Church, and to him he recommended his sheep to be fed, and although after his resurrection he gaue

equal power to all his Apostles,
                     Ibid. 20. and sayd, as my Father sent me, so I send you, receaue the holy Ghost &amp;c. neuertheles to manifest, and shew a vnity, he ordayned one chayre, and by his authority disposed, that the beginning of the same vnity should proceed from one. Truely the rest of the Apostles were that which S. Peter was, endued with lyke fellowship of honour, and power, but the beginning proceedeth from vnity; the Primacy is giuen to Peter, that one Church of Christ, and one chayre may be shewed. So he.
            5. And prosecuting still the same matter, proueth notably the vnity of the Church, by the vnity of the head,S. Cypriā proueth the vnity of the Church by the vnity of the head thereof. from whence all the vnity of the body is deriued, which he sheweth by three excellent similituds of many branches of one tree springing from one roote, many brookes of one water flowing from one fountayne, and many beames of one light deriued from one sunne, concluding his discourse, that notwithstanding the amplitude of the Church, by the propagation, and numerosity of her children, and the extension of her parts, and members all ouer the world, vnum tamen caput est, sayth he, &amp; origo vna &amp;c. yet the head is one, and the origen, or beginning one (that is to say Peter) vpon whome he sayd before (as you haue heard) that our Sauiour buylt his Church, and to whom he recō
               mended his sheep to be fed, yea gaue him Primatum, the Primacy, vt vna Christi Ecclesia, &amp; vna cathedra monstretur, to shew therby one Church of Christ, and one chayre; and this must needs be the true sense of S. Cyprian in that-place, if we will make his conclusion conforme to his premisses, and to the whole scope of his intention.
            6. So that M. Andrews making the Church it selfe

to be the roote, fountayne, and head whereof S. Cyprian speaketh, doth most absurdly confound the tree with the roote, the riuers with the spring, the body with the head, and lameth all that most excellent discourse, of S. Cyprian, yea ouerthroweth the very foundation thereof, denying all that which S. Cyprian layd for his ground, to wit, the Primacy, and supreme authority of S. Peter, from whence he expresly deryueth the vnity of the Church, as he doth also most clearely els where, saying in his Epistle to Iubaianus:
               
                  Idem ep. ad Iubaian.
                
               Nos Ecclesiae vnius caput, &amp; radicem tenemus: We haue, or do hold the head, and roote of one Church (and after declaring what roote,
               
                  Ibid.
                and head he meaneth, he sayth:) nam Petro primùm Dominus super quem &amp;c. For our Lord gaue this power (of binding, and loosing) to Peter, vpon whome he buylt his Church, &amp; vnde vnitatis orig
                  •
               nem instituit, &amp; ostendit: and from whence he ordayned, and shewed the beginning of vnity. And agayne after in the same Epistle: Ecclesia quae vna est, super vnum qui claues accepit, voce Domini fundata est. The Church which is one, was by the speach of our Lord founded vpon one, who receaued the keyes. So he. Whereby it euidently appeareth, that his constant, and manifest doctrine is, that all the vnity of the Church, proceedeth from the vnity of her head (to wit S. Peter, and his chayre) and that the Cardinall affirming that S. Cyprian made Peter the head, fountayne, &amp; roote of the Church, gaue vs his true sense: and M. Andrews making the Church it selfe to be the head,
               A foolish glosse of M. Andrews vpon the text of S. Cyprian. 
               fountayne, and roote of it selfe, is very absurd, and wholy repugnant to S. Cyprians doctrine or meaning.
            7. And this will be more cleere, if we examin a little better M. Andrews his glosse vpon the text of S.

Cyprian, whereby he laboureth to proue, that the Church it selfe, and not S. Peter is the head, fountayne, and roote whereof S. Cyprian speaketh.
                  Andr. vbi supra pag. 218. lin. 2. For hauing layd downe S. Cyprians words (to wit, sic Ecclesia Domini luce perfusa &amp;c. so also the Church shyning with the light of our Lord, reacheth forth her beames ouer the whole world) he noteth that the Father sayth, Ecclesia, non Petrus, the Church, not Peter; and no meruaile, seeing he had no occasion then to name Peter, but the Church only; for although the Church, being a visible body, hath alwayes a visible head vnder Christ, to wit Peter, and his successors; yet S. Cyprian doth speake of it heere, as of a body considered a part, not including the head, meaning afterwards to speake of the head (as he had in lyke manner done before) declaring from whence the vnity of that body is deriued, as it will appeare further heereafter.
            8. In the meane tyme, let vs see how M. Andrews goeth on with the text; Vnum tamen lumen est &amp;c. Yet it is one light, which is euery where spread, neyther is the vnity of the body separated; heere now he asketh two questions, the one whether Peter be the light,
               How S. Peter might be called the light of the Church. and the other, whether he be euery where dispersed? whereto I answere, that although he is not the light of the Church, as he was a particuler man, yet he may well be so called, not only as he was an Apostle (seeing that our Sauiour sayd to all the Apostles, Vos estis lux mundi, you are the light of the world) but also much more as he is the Vicar,
                  Matth. 5. and substitute of our Sauiour, who being lux vera,
               
                  Ioan. 11. the true light, imparteth vnto him his owne excellencyes, so far forth, as is necessary for the gouernement of his Church, which he hath committed to his charge; in which respect it may truely be sayd, that

the light of the Church proceedeth not only from Christ, but also from him, as from the head thereof vnder Christ, and that by his authority it is spread euery where throughout the Church.
            9. And this is sufficiēt to make good the similitude according to the intention of S. Cyprian, who only speaketh here of the Church, as of a body receiuing all the vnity of her seueral &amp; many parts from the head, as the light which is spread thoughout the world, receaueth vnity from the sunne; &amp; therfore he argueth thus in substance:The vinity of the Church notably proued, and deduced by S. Cyprian from the vnity of the Head. As the light of the sunne dispersed ouer the earth (though it haue many beames, yet) is but one light by reason that it proceedeth from one sunne, so also the body of the Church dispersed by many members ouer the whole world, is but one body, because it proceedeth from one head; which reason he giueth yet more expressely in the two other similituds that immediatly follow (of a tree spreading forth many boughes, and of many brookes flowing from one fountayne) for of the former he saith, that though the boughes are many, and spread far abroad, Robur tamen vnum tenaci radice firmatum: yet the strengeth is one fastned in the strong, and stiffe roote; and of the later he saith in like manner, that notwithstanding the aboundant, and copious plenty of water dispersed by many brookes, yet it is but one water, because vnitas, saith he, seruatur in origine, the vnity is conserued in the spring. Who then seeth not, that to apply this similitude to the Church, we must needs say, that albeit the sayd Church hath very many members, and parts spread ouer the whole world yet it is but one body, because it hath but one head wherein the vnity of all the parts is conserued.
            
               10. And to this is also conforme the rest of S. Cyprians text, which M. Andrews proceedeth to lay downe thus; 
                  Ramos suos Ecclesia &amp;c. The Church, through her aboundant fertility, stretcheth forth her branches ouer the whole earth, and largely spreadeth abroad her copious riuers, or brookes, yet the head is one, the origen, or beginning one, and one mother &amp;c. So sayth S. Cyprian, teaching, as you see, nothing els in effect, but that the Church being a body dispersed ouer the whole world in her members, is vnited in one head, and therefore he saith, vnum tamen caput, &amp; origo vna, yet the head is one, and the origen, or beginning one: and so hauing spoken as well of the head of the Church, as of the body, and declared from whence the vnity of the whole is deryued, he had great reason to adde vna mater, one mother,
               Why the Church is called one Mother. giuing to vnderstand that as the Church hath one head, so she is one mother; one, in respect of her vnity deryued from her head, and mother, because she is the spouse of Christ, and hath children dispersed throughout the world.
            11. And thus may M. Andrews see, that albeit S. Peter is not called in S. Cyprian a Mother,
               M. Andrews fraudulent in his lame allegation of S. Cyprian. yet he is acknowledged to be the head, from whence the vnity of the whole Church our mother is communicated to vs her children, which would haue bene as cleare as the sunne, if he had layd downe the similituds themselues, as well as he gaue vs only the application of them out of S. Cyprian (beginning his allegation, with Sic &amp; Ecclesia: so also the Church &amp;c.) for he knew full well that his false glosse would haue bene easily discouered if he had set downe the similituds, as they are deliuered, and vrged by the Father himselfe. Therefore now let the Reader Iudge, Quis caligauit hic? who

was blind heere? the Cardinall, or M. Andrewes? Thus much concerning the first place of S. Cyprian.
            
            12. The other place is; Petrus super quem Dominus fundauit Ecclesiam:
               
                  S. Cypr. ep. ad Quint.
                Peter vpon whom our Lord did found his Church; whereupon the Cardinall infereth that S. Cyprian teacheth, that the Church is buylt vpon S. Peter,
               
                  Card. Bellar. Apolo. c. 8. p. 125. Andr. cap. 8. pag. 218. and that therfore he is the foundation of the Church, and consequently the head therof, because the foundation in a buylding, and the head in a body is all one: whereto M. Andrewes answereth thus. Alter verò illi ex Cypriano locus praecidendus erat &amp;c.
               A shifting answere of M. Andrews, falsely charging the Cardinall with fraud. He thought it necessary to cut of the other place of Cyprian where it seemed little to fauour the Primacy; for thus it is, nam nec Petrus (quem primum Dominus elegit) &amp;c. For neyther did Peter, whome our Lord chose the first, challenge any thing insolently to himselfe, nor take vpon him arrogantly to say that he had the Primacy, or that he ought to be obayed of those that were yonger, and later then he:
               Wherein the mynd or sense of Cyprian seemeth to be, that if Peter had sayd that he had the Primacy, he had insolently challenged somewhat to himselfe, and therfore the Cardinall suppressed this part of the text warily,
                  The Primacy of S. Peter is notably proued, by those words of S. Cypriā, which M. Andrews sayth the Cardinall fraudulētly left out. because it made litle for the Primacy, and rather tooke hold of the former part, where Cyprian saith, that the Church was buylt vpon Peter &amp;c.
            
            13. Thus sayth M. Andrews, with somewhat more, which I will also lay downe after a whyle, when I shall first haue examined this; wherein you see he would fayne make the Reader belieue that the Cardinall had vsed some art, or fraud, in leauing it vncyted, as not fauorable, but rather preiudiciall to S. Peters Primacy; wheras in truth it doth notably proue it, and

no way impayre, or infringe it, as he may see in the Cardinals controuersyes, where amongst very many other places alledged for the Primacy of S. Peter, he vrgeth this, fortifying it notably with the authority of S. Augustine, who also cyteth those words of S. Cyprian, though vpon another occasion. Therefore I will set downe the Cardinalls owne words to the end that he may answere for himselfe: who hauing brought the testimonyes of a whole Iury (as I may say) of Greeke Fathers (to wit Origen, Eusebius, S. Basil, S. Gregory Nazianzen, S. Epiphanius, the two S. Cyrils, S. Chrysostome, Euthymius, Theophilact, Occumenius, and Hugo Etherianus, all of them expressely acknowledging the supremacy of S. Peter aboue all the other Apostles) addeth as many more of the Latin Fathers, and beginneth with S. Cyprian thus.

            14. 
                  Ex latinis S. Cyprianus in Ep. ad Quintum &amp;c. Of the latin Fathers S. Cyprian in his Epistle to Quintus sayth, that Peter, when he was reprehended by Paul, would not say that he had the primacy, and that he ought to be obayed,S. Cypriā cleerly explicated by the Card. out of S. Augustine. whereby he signifyeth that Peter had the primacy, and might command all others. And lest perhaps our aduersaries may say, that Cyprian meaneth that Peter did not say he had the Primacy, because he should therein haue affirmed that which was false, let vs heare Augustine expounding this place of Cyprian lib. 2.S. Peter being head of the Apostles suffered himselfe to be reprehended by S. Paul. 
                  de Baptismo cap. 1. &amp;c.
Thus saith the Cardinall, and after hauing layd downe S. Cyprians words alledged by S. Augustine (being the same that you haue heard before) he addeth the words of S. Augustine which are these: Ecce vbi commemorat Cyprianus &amp;c. Behold how Cyprian doth shew that Peter the Apostle (in whom the primacy of the Apostles is preeminent

with such an excellent grace) corrected by Paul a later Apostle, when he dealt concerning Circumcision otherwayse then truth required. So sayth S. Augustin, whereby it euidently appeareth, how he vnderstandeth S. Cyprian in this place, to wit, that albeit Peter was preeminent, and far excelled the Apostles by reason of his Primacy, yet when he erred, he patiently suffered himselfe to be corrected by Paul, and did not insolently, and arrogantly defend his errour, standing vpon the authority of his Primacy, and challenging obedience of S. Paul and others.
            15. This then being so, and the Cardinalls opinion concerning the meaning of S. Cyprian in this place being so 
                  •
               ell fortified,Bellarmine cleared from M. Andrews imputatio
                     •
                  . as you haue now heard, by S. Augustines construction, and iudgement thereof, what reason hath any man to thinke that the Cardinall did, as M. Andrews chargeth him, purposely, and craftily suppresse those words of S. Cyprian, as not making for Peters Primacy; whereas you see he taketh them to make much for it, and doth vrge them notably to proue it? Therefore can any reasonable man imagine any fraud in the Cardinall? Or any other cause why he did not eyte them in his Apology, but partly for breuityes sake (which euery may seeth how much he affecteth in all his workes) and partly because he thought he had alledged sufficient already out of that Father to proue his intent?
            16. So that, whereas M. Andrews sayth, Ea Cypriani mens videtur &amp;c. The mynd or sense of Cyprian seemeth to be, that if Peter had said he had the Primacy, he had insolently challenged somewhat to himselfe (that is to say more then was due vnto him) he did very well to say videtur, it seemeth; for if he had absolutly affirmed

it, he had ouerlashed very far. Besides that he may learne if it please him to make a great difference betwixt insolenter,
               How a man may speake of his owne authority insolently, and yet truly. and 
                  
                     •
                  also, insolently, and falsely; for a man may take vpon him a true authority, and speake of it insolently, that is to say without iust cause, or in defence of some euill act, and yet not falsely, because it is true that he hath the authority which he pretendeth. And therefore I say, that if S. Peter should haue stood vpon his Primacy in defence of his erroneous act, and sayd, that S. Paul ought to follow and obay him therin, because he was the Primate, and head of the Apostles
               
                  •
                he had both sayd, and done insolently, which neuertheles, in defence of a truth, or vpon some other iust occasion, he might both say and do, without all note of insolency, yea iustly, and necessarily, because he had indeed the Primacy, and therefore was to be obayed, and followed in all good, and iust actions.
            17. But now M. Andrews goeth forward: and whereas the Cardinall concluded that Peter being the foundation of the Church was therefore the head of it,
                  Andr. v
                        ••
                      supr.
                
               M. Andrews granteth,How S. Peter is tearmed the foundation of the Church by S. Cyprian. that S. Peter was fundamentum quidem vnum, sed non vnicum, one, but not the only foundation: esse enim illiusce aedificij duodecem fundamenta, for that there are twelue foundations of that building. But M. Andrews is heere short of his account, for he should rather haue sayd that there are thirteene, except he will exclude Christ, of whome the Apostle sayth, Fundamentum aliud nemo potest ponere &amp;c. no man can lay any other foundation then that which is already layed,
               1. Cor. 3. 
               Iesus Christ: of whome also the Prophet sayth, Ecce ego ponam in fundamentis Sion lapidem &amp;c.
               
                  Isa. 28. 
               Behold I will lay a stone in the foundation of Sion, an approued stone, a corner, and precious stone, founded in the foundation &amp;c.
            
            
               18. And this I am sure M. Andrews will not deny, seeing that it is one of the most speciall arguments whereby his fellowes are wont to exclude S. Peter from being the foundation of the Church (to wit because Christ is the foundation of it:) if therefore M. Andrews will admit twelue foundations of the Church, without preiudice to Christ, he may also admit eleuen without preiudice to Peter. For albeit the twelue Apostles are all founded vpon Christ, who is the first and principall stone, yet Peter may haue the first place in the foundation next after Christ, being immediatly founded on him (as head and ordinary Pastor of the Church) and the rest vpon Peter, as extraordinary, and subordinate to him. Besides that Peter, and the rest of the Apostles are called foundations in different manner, as I will declare 
                  See after nu. 24.25. &amp; 2
                     •
                  . more particulerly in the discussion of M. Andrews his answere to the place of S. Hierome.
            
            19. And now to conclude concerning S. Cyprian, whereas the Cardinall argueth vpon his words, that because S. Peter was the foundation of the Church, he was therefore the head thereof (in respect that the head in a body,A bad inference of M. Andrews about twelue heads. and the foundation in a buylding is all one) M. Andrews answereth thus: 
                  Vix illuc vsquequa
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      &amp;c. That is scantly true euery way, for I do shew the Cardinall a buylding, whereof there are twelue foundations, but hardly can the Cardinall shew me one body, wherof there are twelue heads. So he, very well to the purpose (I assure you) ouerthrowing himselfe with his owne answere;
for if that buylding (which he sayth hath twelue foundations) be the Church, as indeed it is (and so it appeareth by his quotation of the 24. Chapter of the Apocalyps
               
                  Apoc. 24.) then may the Cardinall very easily

shew him also a body that hath twelue heads, euen according to the doctrine, and opinion of M. Andrews himselfe, who can not deny but that the Church is a body (I meane such a body as heere we treate of, to wit not a naturall, but a mysticall body) neyther can he deny that the Apostles were heads of that body seeing all of them had (as M. Andrews still telleth vs) the charge, and gouernement of the Church alike; and therefore being twelue gouernours, they were also twelue heads.
            
            20. Is it then so hard a matter for the Cardinall to shew him a body with twelue heads? Nay, which is more, and toucheth more our case, doth not M. Andrews thinke it possible that such a body may haue a hundreth heads,A politicall or mysticall body may haue many heads subordinat to one head. and all of them subordinate to one head? What will he say of the state of Venice? Will he deny that the Senators (who are many hundreths) are heads thereof? or that they are subordinat to one Doge, or Duke? So that it is to be vnderstood, that in respect of the rest of the Common welth, the Senators are all heads, though in respect of the Doge, they are but members subordinate to him. And so in this spirituall buylding of the Church, or mysticall body of Christ, though the twelue Apostles were twelue foundations, and consequently twelue heads, yet, as all the twelue were subordinate to Christ, so were eleuen of them subordinate to Peter, whome Christ made their Primacy or Head, which, as you haue heard, is the expresse doctrine of S. Cyprian, teaching that albeit the Apostles had equal power, yet Primatus, sayth he, Petro datur, vt vna Ecclesia Christi, &amp; vna Cathedra monstretur, The Primacy is giuen to Peter, that one Church of Christ, and one chayre may be shewed. Whereby he giueth to vnderstand,

that although the Apostles were all of equal powe
                     •
                  
                in respect of all other Christians, who were subiect to them,M. Andrews so wryteth as he doth much help his Aduersaryes cause yet they were not equal in respect of Peter to whome our Sauiour himselfe gaue the Primacy to conserue vnity amongst them, and in his whole Church. And this I hope may suffise for answere to M. Andrews his glosse vpō the 2. places of S. Cyprian; only, I cannot omit to thanke him, for the paynes he taketh still to corroborate our cause with his answers, &amp; obiections, for truly if he write many bookes in this vayne, we shall not need any other champion to fight for vs but himselfe, as it will also further appeare by his answere to the place of S. Hierome whereof I am now to treate.

            21. The Cardinall cyteth out of S. Hierome these words, Inter duodecem vnus eligitur, vt capite constitut
                     •
                   schismatis tollatur occasio: one is chosen amongst twelue, to the end, that a head being made, the occasion of schisme may be taken away,
               Touching the place of S. Hierome. by which words of S. Hierome, spoken expressely of S. Peter, it is cleare that according to S. Hieromes doctrine our Sauiour made S. Peter head of the Apostles, and consequently of the whole Church of God;
                  Supple. c. 4. nu. 3. to which purpose I haue also vrged the same in my Supplement.
            
               
                  Andr. vbi supra pag. 219. §. Hieronymus.
               22. Now then M. Andrews answereth the Cardinall thus:

                  Hicronymus idem hic à Cardinale patitur &amp;c. Hierome suffreth heere at the Cardinals hands the same (iniury) that Cyprian suffred before; both their places (or texts) are lamely cyted, for Hi
                        •
                     rome saith thus: At dices (tu scilicet Iouiniane) super Petrum fundatur Ecclesia &amp;c.
                  M. Andrews bad glosse vpō S. Hieroms text. But thou (to wit Iouinian) wilt say, the Church is founded vpon Peter (which the Cardinall doth now so oft, and earnestly inculcate vnto vs, well following Iouinian therein:) but what sayth Hierome?

Although, sayth he, the same is in another place done vpon all the Apostles, and all of them receiue the keyes, and the strength of the Church is equal consolidated, or established vpon them all, yet (neyther in respect of the keyes, nor of the foundation, which are so much esteemed at Rome, but) for this cause one is chosen amongst twelue, that a head being made, the occasion of schisme may be taken away.
                Thus far doth M. Andrews alledge the words of S. Hierome, and glosse them, as you see, wherein two things are specially to be obserued for the present, the one that he taxeth the Cardinall for wronging S. Hierome now, no lesse then he wronged S. Cyprian before, in the lame, and corrupt citation of their places.
The other, that he would make the Reader belieue, that to hold the Church to be buylt vpon Peter was one of Iouinians heresyes, and not S. Hieromes doctrine; and that therefore the Cardinall teaching, and oft inculcating the same, doth follow Iouinian; of these two points I must needs say somwhat before I passe further; for truely they deserue to be well examined, and the good conscyence of M. Andrews to be layed open to the world.
            23. In the first point I must needs say he hath some reason, to wit, in saying that S. Hierome is as much wronged by the Cardinall,
                  Supra nu. 15. as S. Cyprian was before; which is most true; for neyther of them both receiue any wrong at all by the Cardinall,The Cardinal falsely charged by M. Andrew

                     •
                  ion of S. Hierome. as you haue already seene in the place of S. Cyprian, and will easily see also in this place of S. Hierome, if you conferre that which the Cardinall left vncyted (and is layd downe by M. Andrews) with that which followeth, and is cyted by the Cardinall: for albeit S. Hierome do teach in the words which M. Andrews cyteth, that the

               Church was equally buylt vpon all the Apostles, yet it is euident by that which the Cardinall alledgeth, that the same is so to be vnderstood, that it doth not any way preiudice the Primacy of S. Peter, seeing that S. Hierome affirmeth expressely (notwithstanding the equality, whereof he speaketh) that S. Peter was made head of the Apostles; and therefore it is manifest that M. A
                     •
                  drews doth vnderstand this equality in other manner then S. Hierome doth, who indeed sayth, with great reason, as also diuers other Fathers do (and no Catholike will deny it) that the Church was buylt vpon all the Apostles (ex aequo, equally) but in what sense the same is to be vnderstood,
                  Psal. 86. Apocal. 21. Ephes. 
                  
                     •
                  . I would wish Mr. Andrews to learne of Cardinall Bellarmine himselfe in his controuersyes, where he declareth the same very learnedly,
                  Bellar. de Rom. Pont. lib. 1. c. 11. perspicuously, and briefely, as he is wont.
            24. Thus then he sayth, answering to this very place of S. Hierome and certayne others taken out of the Scriptures, and obiected by Luther: Respondeo, tribus modis Apostolos omnes fuisse Ecclesiae fundamenta &amp;c.How the Church according to Cardinal Bellarmine is buylt equally vpō all the Apostles. I answere that all the Apostles were three wayes the foundations of the Church, yet without any preiudice to Peter. The first is, because they were the first that did found Churches euery where, for Peter did not himselfe alone conuert the whole world vnto the fayth of Christ, but some Nations were conuerted by him, others by Iames, and others by the rest.
And therefore S. Paul Rom. 15. saith: 
                  Sic praedicaui &amp;c. I haue so preached this Ghospell where Christ was not named, least I should buyld vpon other mens foundation. And 1. Cor. 3. vt sapiens architectus &amp;c. I haue layd the foundation lyke a wyse Architect, and another buyldeth thereupon. And in this manner all Apostles are foundations alyke, which

I thinke is meant in the 21. Chapter of the Apocalyps.
               
            
            
               25. The Apostles and Prophets are also sayd another way, to be foundations of the Church, to wit, because all Christian doctrine was reuealed vnto them, seeing that the fayth of the Church is grounded vpon the reuelation which the Apostles, &amp; Prophets had from God; for new articles of fayth are not alwayes reuealed to the Church. But the Church resteth, and continueth in that doctrine which the Apostles, and Prophets learned of our Lord, and deliuered to their posterity by preaching, and writing, and by this meanes we are, as the Apostle sayth, Ephes. 2. buylt vpon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets, and according to these two wayes, Peter is no greater then the rest. But as Hierome sayth, the strength of the Church is equally established vpon them all.
               
            
            
               26. The Apostles also are sayd a third way, to be foundations of the Church, to wit in respect of their gouernement; for all of them were heads, gouernours, and Pastors of the vniuersall Church, but not in the same manner that Peter was, for they had a chiefe, and most ample power as Apostles, or Legats; but Peter had it as ordinary Pastor; besides that they had their full power in such sort, that neuerthelesse Peter was their head, and they depended of him, and not he of them: and this is that which was promised to Peter Matth. 16. when it was sayd vnto him in presence of the rest, Vpon this rock I will buyld my Church, which besides the other Fathers before cyted, S. Hierome teacheth in his first booke against Iouinian; where explicating what is the meaning of buylding the Church vpon Peter, he sayth thus: Licèt super omnes Apostolos &amp;c.

Although the strength of the Church be established equally vpon all the Apostles, yet therefore one was chosen amongst the twelue, to the end, that a head being made, the occasion of schisme might be taken away.
               
            
            27. Thus far the Cardinall, which I hope may suffice to teach M. Andrews how the Church was founded equally vpon the Apostles, to wit, the two first waye, (whereof the Cardinall speaketh as mentioned in the Apocalyps, and the Epistle to the Ephesians, where not only the Apostles, but also the Prophets are called foundations of the Church) which may well stand with the Primacy of S. Peter, and S. Hieromes doctrine concerning the same; whereas M. Andrews making S. Hierome impugne S. Peters Primacy by the equality that he mentioneth, maketh him contradict himselfe, and ouerthrow his owne doctrine in the very next words after, wherein he expoundeth (as the Cardinall noteth very well) what is meant by the buylding of the Church vpon S. Peter, signifying that it is to be vnderstood thereby, that our Sauiour made S. Peter head of the Apostles, as I will shew further hereafter, by M. Andrews his owne confession. So that it is cleare inough that the Cardinal left not those words of S. Hierome vncyted,
                  See after nu.

                as preiudiciall to Peters primacy, but only for breuityes sake;M. Andrewes calumniateth Bellarmine. and that therefore M. Andrews hath notably calumniated him, as well in this place as in the former, seeking to cast vpon him some suspition of fraudulent dealing in the cytation of Authors, which is indeed the proper talent of M. Barlow, and M. Andrews, as you haue hitherto seene sufficiently proued in them both, and shall see further exemplyfied heereafter in M. Andrews, to his confusion.
            28. The second point which I wished to be obserued

in his Glosse vpon S. Hieromes text,M. Andrews second charge against the Cardinall touching Iouinianisme refuted and retorted
                     •
                  
                is that he sayth the Cardinall followeth Iouinian in affirming, that the Church was founded vpon S. Peter, as if the Cardinall did teach therein so
                  •
               e heresy of Iouini
                     •
                  n, and not S. Hieromes doctrine: but this surpasseth all impudency. For, no doubt, he speaketh against his owne conscience, and knowledge, seeing he cannot be ignorant of the contrary, if he haue read, and examined that very place in S. Hierome which he obiecteth, where it is euident, that the matter then in controuersy betwixt S. Hierome, and Iouinian was about the merit of Virginity,
               
                  S Hier. li. 1. contra. Iouinian.
                because Iouinian equalled mar
                  •
               ryage with it, which heresy S. Hierome in that place laboured to confute
                  •
                and for as much as the heretyke had obiected the marriage of the Apostles (inferring thereupon that if Virginity were to be preferred before marriage, Christ would not haue chosen marryed men, but Virgins to be his Apostles, and the Princes, and Captains of Christian disciplin) therefore S. Hierome answereth, that it appeareth not in the Scriptures that any of them had a wyfe except Saint Peter, and that he being married whiles he was vnder the law, liued continent from his wyfe after his vocation to the Apostleship; and that if any of the rest had wyues before their vocation, they abstayned from them euer after; and that S. Iohn Euangelist being chosen a Virgin, was singularly beloued, and specially fauoured of our Sauiour aboue the rest for his Virginity.
            29. And whereas Iouinian also vrged the supreme dignity of S. Peter, as that the Church was founded vpon him, being a married man, and not vpon S. Iohn who was a Virgin (wherein it is euident that Iouinian sought to fortify his heresy by an argument drawne

from a point of knowne Catholike doctrine) S. Hierome was so far from denying the Church to be founded on Peter, that he notably confirmed it, declaring that Peter was made thereby head of the Apostles; for hauing taught that the Church was also founded equally vpon all the Apostles (in the sense that I haue declared) he gaue a reason not only why S. Peter was made head of the rest (to wit to take away the occasion of schisme) but also why he (being a married man) was endowed with that power, and dignity, rather then S. Iohn who was a Virgin, whereof he yielded this probable reason, that respect was had to the age of them both, because Peter was a man of yeares, and Iohn very yong; and therefore to auoyd murmuration against Iohn himselfe (which would haue hapned in case he being the yongest of them all should haue bene made their head) Peter was worthily preferred before him.Why S. Peter was preferred by our Sauiour to the supremacy before S. Io
                     •
                  n. This is briefely the substance of S. Hieromes discourse in that place. Whereby it is euident that he notably confirmeth our Catholike doctrine concerning the Supremacy of S. Peter, acknowledging him to be made the head as well of S. Iohn, as of all the rest.
            30. And to the end that M. Andrews may euidently see that S. Hierome did not impugne, or disallow this proposition, the Church is founded vpon Peter (but reiected only the false consequent that Iouinian drew thereon, against the merit of Virginity) I wish him to read S. Hieromes Commentary vpon the 16. Chapter of S. Matthew, and particulerly vpon these words of our Sauiour, super hanc petr
                     •

                  abo Ecclesiam meam &amp;c. vpon this rock will I buyld my Church &amp;c. where he shall see that the proposition, which Iouinian
               
obiected,
                  S. Hier. in 16. cap. Matth.
                is also the cleare, and expresse doctrine of S. Hierome, who sayth thus in the person of our Sauiour to S. Peter: Because thou Simon hast sayd to me, thou art Christ the Sonne of God,
               S. Peter
                     •
                   supremacy acknowledged by S. Hierome, and groū

                   word
                     •
                  . 
               I also say to thee (not with a vayne, or idle speach that hath no operation, or effect) sed quia meum dixisse fecisse est, but because my saying is a doing (or making) therefore I say vnto thee, thou art Peter (or a Rock) and vpon this rock I will buyld my Church. As Christ being himselfe the light, granted to his disciples that they should be called the light of the world, so to Simon who belieued in Christ the Rock, he gaue the name of Peter (that is to say, a Rock) and according to the metaphor of a Rock it is truly sayd to him, I will buyld my Church vpon thee.
            
            31. Thus far S Hierome, teaching expressely that Christ buylt his Church vpon Peter,
               
                  Idem ep. a

                      ep. 54. which also he teacheth in diuers other places, as in an Epistle to Marcella, where he hath these wordes, Petrus super quē Dominus fundauit Ecclesiam &amp;c. Peter vpon whome our Lord founded his Church; and in another Epistle to Pope Damasus he affirmed the same, not only of him, but also of the chayre of Peter saying: Ego nullum primum nisi Christum sequens Beatitudini tuae, id est Cathedrae Petri,
               
                  Ibid. ep. 5

                do cōmunicate with thy Beatitude, that is to say, with the chayre of Peter; vpon that Rock I know the Church is buylt. Finally in the selfe same booke against Iouinian, where he answereth the former obiection, he calleth S. Peter, Petram Christi, the Rock of Christ, saying: O vox digna Apostolo, &amp; Petra Christi! O speach worthy of an Apostle, and the Rock of Christ! signifying thereby, that S. Peter was the Rock
               
whereupon Christ buylt his Church.
            32. So as it cannot be denyed, that S. Hierome both firmely belieued, and expressely taught that our Sauiour buylt his Church vpon Peter, wherein you haue already 
                  See before nu. 4.5. &amp; sequēt
                seene, that he agreeth with S. Cyprian (who wrote long before him) and with the whole Councell of Calcedon, which calleth S. Peter, Petram, &amp; crepidinem Ecclesiae,
               
                  See before cap. 2. nu. 76. the rock, and top of the Church, and rectae fidoi fundamentum, the foundation of the true faith. Besids that you may also see in Cardinall Bellarmins controuersyes,
                  Bellar. de Rom. Pontif. l. 1. c. 10. that he agreed therin with Origen, S. Athanasius, S Basil, S. Gregory Nazianzen, S. Epiphanius, S. Chrysostome, S. Cyril, Tertullian, S. Hilary, S. Ambrose, S. Maximus, S. Leo, S. Gregory the Great, and other learned Fathers.
            33. Wherupon it followeth that Iouinian did not obiect the same, as his owne singular opinion (which he knew well would be litle esteemed, and was to be proued, and not obiected) but as a matter generally acknowledged by Catholikes, and that therefore he only sought to draw some consequence out of it (as out of a knowne principle of the Catholike faith) for the confirmation of his heresy,How shameles M. Andrews is to charge the Cardinall with Iouinianisme, which he himselfe professeth, except he dissent frō his fellows of the English clergy. as all heretykes do also seeke to do the like, not only out of Catholike opinions, but also out of the Scripture it selfe. What then may we thinke of M. Andrews, who is not ashamed to taxe the Cardinall as a follower of Iouinian for teaching that the Church was buylt vpon Peter? Can we thinke that he hath any conscience, or care of what he saith, especially seeing that he himselfe is a true scholler, and follower of Iouinian, except he dissent not only from Luther, Caluin and other Archsectaries his great Maisters, but also from his brethren

of the present English Church.

Andrews himselfe (except he will disclayme from all his brethren) do follow Iouinian. Whereto I might add other heresyes of his taught by many Archsectaries of our tyme (wherin,

                it may be, M. Andrewes hath his share amongst the rest) as that merits, and rewards of the lust are equal; and that the corporall virginity, and integrity of the Blessed Virgin Mary, was corrupted, and lost by the birth of our Sauiour.
            35. All which opinions being heresyes of Iouinian, and registred for such by S. Augustine,

Andrewes, and his fellowes? seeing that the Cardinall holdeth nothing els with Iouinian, but only that Catholike doctrine which Iouinian held, and professed togeather with S.

               The answere of M. Andrews to the place of S. Hierome examined.36. Now then let vs proceed with the examination of what he saith further to the place of S. Hierome alledged by the Cardinall, which is this: 
                  Propterea inter duodecim &amp;c. Therefore amongst twelue one is chosen
                        •
                      that a head being appointed, the occasion of schisme may be taken away: whereto he answereth thus: Inter duodecim vnum eligi &amp;c. that one be chosen amongst twelue, or some number which some one man may be able to gouerne,
                     Andr cap. 8. pag. 219. § Hieronymus.
                   and prouyde for, or els to take away schisme, who doth forbid a head to be chosen? or so much power to be giuen him, as may suffice for the end, or purpose for the which he was ordayned? But the question is how far that power, and that number extendeth, lest the head become caput heteroclitum (an extrauagant head, or a head out of course) and not so much the occasion

of schisme taken away,Foure things to be noted in M Andrews his answere. as an occasion giuen of tyranny.
So he, all which I beseech thee, good Reader, well to note, and particulerly that he granteth these points following: The first, that S. Peter was chosen head of the Apostles: the second, that a head is necessary for auoyding of schisme: the third, that the same head is  to haue as much authority as is conuenient for the end  for which he is ordayned; and the fourth that of all  this there is no question, for that the question is (saith  he) concerning the power of the head, how far it extendeth, and how great may be the number that he is to gouerne.
            37. But if M. Andrews consider well what he granteth,M. Andrews large graunt, cōcerning the primacy of S. Peter. he may consequently decyde the question, or doubt that he maketh, and shall see that he hath granted as much in effect as we teach, or demand con

               cerning the authority of S. Peter, and his successors. For if S. Peter were made head of all the Apostles to whome Christ left the gouernment of his Church, it cannot be denied, but that he was made head of the Church; for who is head of any common welth, but he that is head of all those that haue the administration, charge, and gouernement of it? And if the reason why he was ordayned head of the Apostles, was to auoyde and preuent the danger of schisme, it must needs be granted, that so long as the same cause, and reason (I meane the danger of schisme) continueth in the Church,What followeth of M. Andrews hi

                  nt. so long also the remedy is to continue therin; and that the greater the danger is, the more necessary also is the remedy; whereupon it followeth that seeing the danger of schisme doth, and euer shall continue in the Church, the remedy also of one head is euer to continue. And for as much as the danger of schisme
               
in the Apostles tyme was not so great (they being all of them most holy men,One

Ephes. 4. as though he had lesse care of the vnity of his Church in future ages then in the beginning when (as I haue sayd) the danger of schisme should be far lesse, then it would be afterwards. Therfore I conclude that seeing S. Peter was made head of the Apostles,
               Our Sauiours prouidence in the conseruation of the Romā Church when all other Apostlicall Churches haue fayled. and consequently of the whole Church, to auoyd schisme, M. Andrews can not deny the same authority to S. Peters successors for the same reason; especially seeing that our Sauiours prouidence therein is euident (to the very eye of euery man that list not to be willfully blynd) in that he hath permitted the succession of all the Apostles to fayle in all the Churches where they gouerned, excepting only the succession of S. Peter in the Roman Church, which he hath miraculously conserued, to make it manifest to the world, that S. Peter, and his chayre (as you haue heard out of S. Cyprian and S. Hierome) is the Rock whereupon he promised to buyld his Church,

                and that as S. Augustine sayth: Ipsa est Petra, quam non vincunt superbae inferorum portae, that is, the Rock which the proud gates

of hell do not ouercome.
            39. Furthermore, whereas M. Andrews granteth also that a head appoynted in the Church for the remedy of schisme is to haue so much power, as is necessary for that end, he must needs consequently grant all that power which we requyre, and acknowledge it in S. Peter and his successors to the same end;Power to punish &amp; to define, necessary in the head of the Church to remedy schismes. I meane, not only a power &amp; authority to define, &amp; decyde cō

               ty, and peace of the Church; for how can the head sufficiently remedy schisme if he cannot punish those which do cause, and mayntayne it? and if M. Andrews will say that Christ hath therfore left authority to his Church to punish only by excommunication, and spirituall censures, I must demand of him, what remedy the head of the Church can giue thereby, when his censures are contemned, and specially by an absolute Prince? shall he haue then no further power to remedy the inconuenience? how then is his power such as M. Andrews himselfe granteth it to be, to wit quanta rei satis si

            40.Whence the greatest danger of schisme commonly aryseth. And who seeth not that the greatest harme that groweth to the Church by schisme commonly is, when secular Princes do eyther rayse it themselues, or mayntayne it in others? Shall not then the head of the Church haue sufficient power to remedy this greatest danger, and mischiefe that can hap to the Church? Or shall he not haue meanes as well to correct his

greatest and most powerfull subiects,
                  See Supplem. cap. 1. nu. 61.62 as the least, and meanest? Then (as I haue sayd in my Supplement) the power of the Church should be no better then a cobweb, that holdeth the little flyes, and letteth go the great ones, and consequently the prouidence of Almighty God should be very defectiue, in ordayning a head to conserue his Church in vnity, and not giuing him sufficient power to performe it, which no wyse temporall Prince would do, if he should make a Lieutenant to gouerne in any part of his dominions. Wherto it may be added, that the Lawyers teach, that he which granteth iurisdiction, is presumed to grant all things necessary for the execution of it; which is also conforme to the Philosophers Maxime, to wit, Qui dat esse, dat consequentia ad esse, he which giueth a being, giueth togeather with it all those things which are consequents thereof, or necessarily requyred thereto, as I haue amply proued in my

            41. Besides that, I haue also declared 
                  Ibid. nu. 63. &amp; 64. there that he which hath power ouer the soule for the benefit thereof,Power ouer the soule necessarily implieth some power ouer the body. must needs haue also power ouer the body, and goods, which by the very Law of nature are subiect to the soule, and ordayned to serue it, and therefore to be disposed by the spirituall Gouernour, or Pastor, so far forth, as is necessary for the saluation of the soule, in which respect the Church hath alwayes vsed (and still doth) to impose not only fasting, and other bodily pennance, but also imprisonments, and pecuniary mulcts vpon her disobedient children, when the benefit of their soules, and the publick good of the Church doth requyre it, which is also vsed by our

Aduersaries themselues in their Ecclesiasticall discipline, who in their spirituall Tribunals, and Courts do punish the disobedient, as well by pec
                  •
               niary penalties, as by corporall imprisonements. Whereupon it followeth, that when Princes (who are members of the Church) do violate the vnion thereof, and are incorrigible by excommunication, they may be chastised by their supreme head, or spirituall Pastor euen in their temporall states, so far as shall be necessary for the good of their soules, and the benefit of the whole Church; for otherwyse the head of the Church should not haue that sufficient power to remedy schismes, and other inconueniences, which M. Andrews himselfe granteth, and it cannot indeed be denied.
            42. This then being so, M. Andrews his first question, or doubt is sufficiently solued,A doubt of M. Andrews sufficiently solued. to wit, How far the power of the head, whereof S. Hierome speaketh, doth extend; that is, to the direction, gouernement yea and chastisment (when occasion requyreth) of all his inferiour members, of what degree soeuer, and consequently of Kings and Princes, so far forth as shalbe needfull for the cōseruation of vnity in the Church; and that therefore when only excommunication will not suffice to reduce them to vnity, and obedience, the head may extend his spirituall power to chastise them in their bodyes, goods, and states, as far as shall be conuenient for the good of soules, and the glory of God, whereto all mens temporall states, goods, lands, and lyues are principally ordayned.Touching the number committed to S. Peters charge.
            
            43. And now to come to his other question concerning the mumber, which this head may gouerne to auoyd and remedy schisme, let M. Andrews well ponder what he hath already granted, and of this

there will be no doubt at all. For if Peter was head of the Apostles (as S. Hierome teacheth, and M. Andrews confesseth) then consequently he was head of as many in number, as were subiect to them; which was no lesse then all the world, whereof they had the spirituall charge, and gouernement, in which respect the Royall Prophet sayth of them and their successors, pro patribus tuis nati sunt tibi filij &amp;c.
               
                  Psal. 44. 
               For thy Fathers, children are borne vnto thee, thou shalt ordayne them to be Princes ouer all the earth. So saith the Prophet of the Apostles, &amp; of Bishops who succeed them in their charge, and are therfore Princes &amp; Gouernours of the Church as S. Augustine,
               
                  In Psal. 44. 
               S. Hierome, and other Fathers expound this place; which therefore is verified, especially in the Apostles, who being the Princes, and Gouernours of the Church, did not only plant, but also propagate throughout the world in their owne tyme, according to the commission, and commaundment of our Sauiour, who sayd vnto them: Euntes in vniuersum mundum &amp;c. Going into the vniuersall world preach the Ghospell to euery creature;
               
                  Mar. vlt.

                  Psal. 18. 
               The sound of them went forth into all the earth, and their words into the bounds thereof.
            
            
               M. Andrews granting S. Peter to be head of the Apostles granteth that he was head of the whole Church.44. Seeing then the Apostles were Gouernours of the whole Church, and yet subiect to S. Peter, as to their head, it must needs be granted that he was supreme head, and gouernour of the whole Church, propagated, and dispersed throughout the world vnder their gouerment; for which cause S. Chrysostome saith with great reason (not only of all the Apostles in generall, that they were to haue orbis terrarum curam, the charge of all the world, but also much more) of S.

Peter in particuler.
                  Idem. ho. 5. in Petris Apost. &amp; Eliant.
                That, Petro Apostolo orbis terrarum Ecclesiae, the Churches of all the world, and the multitudes of people were to be committed to Peter the Apostle; and therefore euen in the former place, where he saith, that the Apostles were to receiue of Christ the charge of the world,
                  Idem. ho. 87. in Ioan.
                he acknowledgeth that S. Peter was Princeps Apostolorum, &amp; vertex totius coetus, the Prince of the Apostles, and the top, or head of all their congregation, and that Christ committed vnto him curam fratrum, the charge of his brethren (that is to say of the Apostles) and finally that Christ recommended vnto him orbis terrarum curam, the charge of the whole world. Finally, comparing S. Iames the Apostle with S. Peter in the same place (by the way of obiection, demanding why then Iames was made Bishop of Hierusalem, and not Peter) he answereth: Hunc totius orbis magistrum praeposuisse, that our Sauiour preferred Peter to be the Maister of the whole world, giuing to vnderstand, that whereas S. Iames was only Bishop of Hierusalem, and the Countries adioyning (as also the other Apostles had euery one of them some part of the world allotted vnto him to gouerne) S. Peter had the charge of the whole.
            45. By all which it is euident that albeit the Apostles had the gouerment of all the Church, yet they were but subordinate to S. Peter, who had a commission peculiar, and singular to himselfe, which was to haue the care, charge, and gouerment of them, as well as of all others subiect to them: So that his power, and authority was wholy independant on them, wheras theirs must needs depend of him, as of their immediate head vnder our Sauiour, whereby it may appeare what an idle head M. Andrews hath, to exclude no

lesse S. Peter then euery other particuler man from the gouerment of the whole Church,M. Andrews head very idle. for no better reason, then lest he might become heterochtum cuput (an extrauagant head) or perhaps proue a Tyrant, through the excesse eyther of power, or of the number of subiects: wherein he sheweth himselfe no lesse prophane, then absurd, attributing as it seemeth, no force, or effect to our Sauiours promise of his continuall assistance to his Apostles, and Church for euer: besides that he erreth gros

                  Matth. 16. &amp; vlt.
                it being euident that the greater the number of the subiects is,A paradox of M. Andrews. the greater also is the difficulty to oppresse them by Tyranny, and the greater the feare, and danger to attempt it.
            46. And therefore we see more frequent tyranny in small States then in great Monarchies,
               Tyranny more frequent in small stats then great Monarchies. and when great Monarches are Tyrants, they commonly exercyse their Tyranny vpon some part of their Dominions and not vpon the whole, whereas a small State contayning a few subiects, is easily Tyrannized vniuersally; so that the multitude of subiects is not properly a motiue, but rather a brydle to Tyranny, though it is properly a cause of schisme, when they are not gouerned by one head, which M. Andrews acknowledgeth sufficiently, when he confesseth,M. Andrews acknowledgeth by a necessary cōsequent that one head is necessary for the whole Church. that one head is necessary to take away the occasion of schisme amongst twelue, or some other small number: for if that be true, then the greater the number is, the greater is the danger of schisme, if they haue many heads independant one of another; whereupon it followeth that one supreme head is most necessary for the whole Church, cōsisting of an innumerable multitude of the faithfull, dispersed throughout the whole world, who being all visible members

of one visible body, could not possibly be conserued long in vnity if they had not one visible head (whome they were all bound in conscience to obay) as I haue

                  Ibid. nu. 7.8. &amp; 9. himselfe.
            47. For which cause not only S. Cyprian (as you haue heard before in this 
                  num. 2.3.4. &amp; sequent.
                Chapter) but also S. Hierome in this place teacheth with great reason that our Sauiour made S. Peter head of the Apostles, to auoyde and remedy the schismes, which might grow (not so much amongst them, as) in the whole Church; for in them (after they had receiued the holy Ghost) there was no danger thereof, though in the whole Church, which was to be propagated by them ouer the world, the danger of schisme was very great, not only in their tyme, but also much more afterwards (as I haue signifyed 
                  nu. 37. before) in which respect it was needefull to be preuented by the institution of one head ouer the whole Church;The conclusion cōcerning the place of S. Hierome. and therefore when S. Hierome answering Iouinian, saith, that S. Peter was made head of the Apostles, he meaneth that he was made head of the Church, which was represented in them, as in the Gouernours thereof; for seeing that the obiection of Iouinian which S. Hierome answereth, concerned the foundation of the Church vpon S. Peter, his answere must needs also concerne the same: to which purpose it is to be considered, that he denyeth not Iouinians proposition (as I haue proued

because, as Cardinall Bellarmine saith very well, the foundation in a buylding, and the head in a politycall, or mysticall body is all one: so as S. Peter being made head of the Apostles (who represented the Church as Gouernours thereof) he was consequently made the head, and foundation of the Church; and this being so, it appeareth that this place of S. Hierome is cleare for vs, and directly proueth that our Sauiour made S. Peter head of the vniuersall Church.

            CHAP. IIII.
            
               THOV hast seene good Reader in the last Chapter how well M. Andrews hath satisfyed the Cardinalls obiectiō out of S. Cyprian, and S. Hierome; and now in this Chapter I will examine his Answers to diuers other places of the Fathers, namely of S. Basil, and S. Gregory

Nazianzen, S. Chrysostome, and S. Augustine, which albeit he pretendeth to answere togeather with the former; yet I haue thought good to separate them, because I haue alledged them separatly in my Supplement.
            
               
                  Card. Bellar. Apolo. c. 8. pag. 125 Suppl. cap. 4 nu. 15. S. Basil. in serm. de iudicio Dei. Andr. cap. 8. p. 218. §. Ex Basilio.
               2. First out of S. Basil, the Cardinall, an I obiect these words to proue the supremacy of S. Peter ouer the rest of the Apostles: Ille beatus qui ceteris praelatus discipulis fuit, cui claues regni caelestis commissae. That happy, or blessed (Peter) who was preferred before the rest of the disciples, to whome the keyes of the heauenly Kingdome were committed &amp;c. Hereto M. Andrews answereth thus: 
                  Ex Basilio, ceteris discipulis praelatum Petrum, sed an vt esset Monarcha? &amp;c. The Cardinall obiecteth out of S. Basil that Peter was preferred before the rest of the Disciples; but was it to the end that he should be a Monarch? is there no other prelacy but of a Monarchy? he was preferred 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   in the testimony (that was giuen him by Christ) as Basil hath there, and 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , blessednes: add also (if you will) that he was preferred in order, and place; the King doth also attribute the same vnto him, yea that he may be the Prince of Apostles, yet without a Monarchy.
                Thus saith M. Andrews to the first part of S. Basils place: whereto I will say somewhat before I add the rest. Heere then you see he graunteth that S. Peter was preferred before the rest of the Apostles in order, and place, yea and that he was the Prince of the Apostles, and forsooth no Monarch.
            
            
               How S. Peter may be sayd to be a Monarch.3. But if we consider what he hath graunted in the last Chapter, we shall find that he must needs acknowledge him to be a Monarch, how much soeuer he mislyke the word: for if a Monarch do signify him that

is one chiefe Prince, and s
                  •
               preme head or gouernour of others, not for his owne particuler benefit, but for the publike and generall good of those whome he gouerneth (for so is a Monarch distinguished from a Tyrant) he cannot with any reason deny S. P
                     •
                  ter to be the Monarch, that is to say, the supreme Prince, and head of the Church, whome he acknowledgeth togeather with S. Hierome to haue been made by our Sauiour, head of the Apostles, to preuent and remedy schisme, and to haue had not only the precedence of place, and order (as now he saith) but also so much power as suffyced, for the conseruation of Vnity in the Church, whereupon followeth all that power,
                  Chap. 3. nu. 39.40. &amp; 41. and authority which we do attribute to S. Peter, and his successors, as I haue declared briefely in the last Chapter.
            4. For S. Peter hauing by this commission of our Sauiour, authority to ordaine, commaund, and punish as far as was necessary for the good of the Church, it must needs be graunted that he had the power and authority of a Monarch: and although M. Andrews had not been forced by 
                  •
               he euidence of S. Hieromes testimony to grant it, yet this very place of S. Basil which he pretendeth heere to answere, doth proue it sufficiently, signifying as much in effect as S. Hierome teacheth; seeing that S. Basil not only saith that Peter was preferred before the rest of the Disciples, but also declareth wherein, that is to say (not in place and order only, but) in authority also, and iurisdiction; adding, cui claues Regni caelestis commissae sunt, to whome (to wit Peter) the keyes of the heauenly Kingdome were committed; giuing to vnderstand, that he had by this particuler cōmission of the keyes, a particuler Iurisdiction more then the rest, in respect whereof he was Boatus, happy,
               
                  〈1 page duplicate〉

or Blessed, and preferred before the rest.
            
            
               
                  Andr. vbi supra. A vaine cauill of M. Andrews.5. Whereby it may appeare how vainly M. Andrews seeketh to elude the force of this place, by that which he addeth, saying, Nam claues ei commissas quis dubitat &amp;c. for who doubteth that the keyes were committed to him, but whether the same was done in his person, or in the person of the Church, Basil doth not declare heere, but Augustine doth in many places. So he: as though S. Basil did not sufficiently explicate himselfe, and shew that S. Peter had by the keyes a greater iurisdiction then the other Apostles, for els to what purpose did he add, that the keyes were committed to him, but to shew how, and wherein he was Blessed, and preferred before the rest? And whereas M. Andrews sayth, that Augustine declareth in many places, that the keyes were giuen him in the person of the Church, and not in his owne, I haue sufficiently shewed the vanity of this euasion in the first 
                  Cap. 1. nu. 3.4. &amp; 5. Chapter of this Adioynder, where I haue euidently proued out of S. Augustine himselfe that S. Peter receaued the keyes, and Pastorall authority for the Church, no otherwyse, but as the supreme head, and Gouernour thereof, in which respect he represented the person of the whole Church, wherein consisteth his preheminence, &amp; preferment before the rest, wherof S. Basil speaketh. So that you see M. Andrews hath said nothing to any purpose in answere of the place of S. Basil.
            
            6. Now then let vs see what he saith to a place of S. Gregory Nazianzen obiected as well by the 
                  Card. Bellar. Apolog. vbi supra.
                Cardinall as by 
                  Suppl. cap. 4. nu. 10. S. Greg. Nazianzen orat. de moderat. &amp;c.
                me: Vides (sayth he) quemadmodum &amp;c. Thou seest how amongst the Disciples of Christ (all of them truely great, and high, and worthy to be chosen) this, to wit Peter, is called a Rocke, and hath the foundations of the

Church committed to his charge &amp;c.
                  Andr. vbi supra.
                Thus saith this ancient and holy Father: whereto M. Andrews answereth thus: 
                  Ex Nazianzeno, Petrum &amp; Ioannem aliquo prae ceteris priuilegio donatos &amp;c. Out of Nazianzen (he obiecteth) that Peter, and Iohn had some priuiledge more then the rest: Peter that he had a new name taken from a Rock, and that Iohn was beloued more then the rest, and might layne vpon Christs brest, and the rest of the Apostles did not take it ill; what was there heere singular in Peter more then in Iohn? and therefore there is eyther heere no Primacy, or els a double Primacy. So he.
            7. Wherein thou mayst easily see,A place of S. Gregory Nazian. explicated and vrged. good Reader, how he paltreth and iuggleth, if thou notest well the obiection, and how he answereth it, partly dissembling those very words which most import, and partly seeking to blynd the Readers eyes with the mention of a priuiledge giuen to S. Iohn, which indeed is also related in that place by S. Gregory Nazianzen, but nothing at all preiudiceth the far greater priuiledge of S. Peter, I meane his supreme authority signifyed by S. Gregory in the words obiected by the Cardinall. For when S. Gregory saith, that Peter was called a Rock, and had Ecclesiae fundamenta fidei suae credita, the foundations of the Church committed to his charge, what els doth he affirme therein, but that the Church was buylt vpon Peter, as vpon a Rock; and that the charge, or gouernment thereof was giuen more particulerly to him then to the rest. For if M. Andrews will say heere (as he is wont) that they were all foundations and gouernours of the Church alike, why was he called a Rock more then they? or what was the priuiledge of Peter whereof Nazianzen speaketh heere, according

to M. Andrews his owne confession, who graunteth that Nazianzen testifieth that Peter and Iohn were aliquo priuilegio prae ceteris donati, priuiledged in some things aboue the rest?
            8. Therefore if M. Andrews will allow any particuler priuiledge to S. Iohns layning vpon Christs brest, as he must needs do (for I thinke he will not be so absurd to say that the same is also to be vnderstood of all the rest) he must needs graunt that Peter had also a particuler priuiledge not only in the name of a Rock, but also in that which was signifyed thereby, that is to say, in that the foundations of the Church were committed particulerly to his charge (as Nazianzen speaketh) by which Metaphore he signifyeth sufficiently that S. Peter was made supreme Gouernour of the Church, as hath bene declared heretofore, and therfore those words of Nazianzen (atque Ecclesiae fundamenta fidei suae credita habeat) wherein consisteth the force of the obiection, seemed to M. Andrews as sore as a byle, and not to be toucht in his answere, though he set it downe in his margent togeather with the rest of the Cardinalls text.
            9. But what shall we say of his absurd inference or conclusion,M. Andrews impertinent trifling. when he saith, that because a priuiledge was giuen to Iohn, as well as to Peter, therefore there was eyther nullus, or duplex primatus, a double primacy, or none at all? Shall we thinke so great a Doctour, as M. Andrews, to be so simple, as not to see how impertinently he try fleth therein? For what coherence is there betwixt those two priuiledges wherby he should make that inference in them both? especially seeing that he himselfe will, I am sure, deny one part thereof (to wit the double primacy) no lesse then we, and the

other part is also sufficiently contradicted, not only by S. Hierome, but also by himselfe, as I haue shewed amply in the last Chapter, where I haue declared, how S. Hierome answered Iouinians obiection, that the Church was founded vpon Peter, and not vpon Iohn, by occasion whereof S. Hierome teacheth, that although Iohn was more fauoured and beloued of our Sauiour then the rest of the Apostles for his Virginity, yet Peter was preferred before him in the primacy, being made head of them all to take away the occasion of schisme, and thereby ouerthroweth this his inference of a double primacy or none.
            10. For if Peter were head of the Apostles, he was also head of the Church, and consequently there was one primate, or head, and not two, notwithstanding that Iohn layned vpon Christs brest, and was more beloued of Christ then the rest; so as M. Andrews doth notably contradict himselfe; besides that he argueth as wisely, as if he should say that when his Maiesty sheweth more particuler fauour, and affection to any man then to my L. of Canterbury, he maketh eyther two Primates of England, or none at all. Whereby thou mayst see (good Reader) what an absurd, and as I may tearme it, a sleeueles answere he hath made heere to the place of S. Gregory Nazianzen.
            
            11. After this there followeth another place of the Cardinall,
                  Suppl. cap. 4. nu. 15. Card. Apol. vbi supra.
                taken out of S. Chrysostome, which I haue also obiected in my Supplement. The words layd downe by the Cardinall are these: Sanctus Ioannes Chrysostomus ho. 55. in Matthaeum &amp;c.
               
                  S. Chrysost
                        •
                      ho. 55. in Matth.
                
               S. Iohn Chrysostome in his 55. homily vpon Matthew saith: (Christ) made Peter Pastor of his future Church. And a litle after: God alone can graunt that the future Church shall remayne immouable,

notwithstanding so many, and so great waues (of persecution) violently bre
                     ••
                   in vpon it: of which Church a fisherman, and of meane parentage is the Pastor and head &amp;c. Heere we read expressely, that Peter was head of the Church. Thus far the Cardinall.
            12. Heereto M. Andrews answereth thus: 
                  Ex Chrysostomo, Cuius Pastor &amp; caput homo piscator &amp;c.
                  
                     Andr. cap. 8. pag. 219. Out of Chrysostome he obiecteth thus, Whereof the Pastour, and head was a fisherman: but these words (whereof the pastor, and head) are crept into the text, and added in the Latin in fauour of 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   (he meaneth the Pope) for they are not in the Greeke, where we read 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   a fisherman, but the word head appeareth no where, nor in that place so much as Pastor, albeit no man will deny that Peter was pastor of the Church, yea, and a chiefe or principall pastor, but yet a pastor togeather with other Pastors his fellow-Apostles, and not alone without others &amp;c.
So he: wherein you see he taketh exception to the words cuius pastor &amp; caput, which he saith are not in the Greeke. Whereto I answere, that put the case they be not now in the Greeke copies which M. Andrews hath seene, yet it litle importeth, seeing that the latin translatour found them (as it is most probable) in the Greeke copie which he followed, and that S. Chrysostome saith as much in effect, as well in the same homily, as in other places.
            13. Whereby it is euident that it is conforme to his doctrine, and not added in fauour of the Pope, as M. Andrews would haue his Reader to suppose. For S. Chrysostome saith in the same homily: Petrus Apostolorum os &amp; vertex,
               
                  Chrysost. vbi supra.
                
               cùm omnes interrogati essent, solus respondit &amp;c. Peter the mouth &amp; head of the Apostles, whē they were all asked, answered alone &amp;c. In which words S.

               Chrysostome doth plainly acknowledge S. Peter to be head of the Church, seeing that he called him head of the Apostles. And in the same place alledged by the Cardinall, hauing said, that a poore fisherman (by the power,
                  Idem ibid.
                and vertue of Christs graunt) surpasseth in strength a
                  •
               d solidity the nature of the dyamond, he preferreth him far before Hieromy the Prophet, saying; that whereas Almighty God made Hier
                     •
                  my like a pillar of yron, and a brazen wall, and gaue him power, and authority ouer one Nation, hunc autem vniuerso terrarum orbi Christus praeposuit, Christ gaue him (to wit Peter) power, and authority ouer the whole world. So he.
            14. And because, M. Andrews will be like heere to fly to his common place, and to say, that all the Apostles had power, and authority ouer the whole world, as well as S. Peter, and that therefore this comparison of him with Hieremy proueth not, that he had any more authority then the rest of the Apostles, M. Andrews must consider that S. Chrysostome cannot heere meane that his authority ouer the whole world was no other, then that which the other Apostles had, seeing he hath taught before in the same homily that he was their head; and I thinke M. Andrews will not be so absurd to say that the authority of the head, and of the members is all one: besides that S. Chrysostome teacheth most clearely els where, that S. Peter was head not only of the Apostles, but also of the whole Church, as it may appeare by that which I haue alledged out of him to that purpose, both in the first, and also in the precedent Chapter of this Adioynder.
            15. Whereto I will now add a most cleare testimony thereof, out of his learned Commentary vpon

the Acts of the Apostles, where discoursing vpon the election of Matthias the Apostle in the place of Iudas, and particulerly vpon those words, Et in diebus illis surgens Petrus, he noteth not only the fauour of Peter, but also his authority ouer the rest, as ouer the flock committed to his charge. Quàm est feruidus, saith he, quàm agnoscit creditum à Christo gregem &amp;c. How feruent is Peter, how well doth he acknowledge the flock committed to him by Christ! Loe how he is Prince in this company or congregation, and euery where beginneth first to speake &amp;c.
            
            16. And againe afterwards prosecuting the same matter,
                  Idem. ho. 3. in Acta Apost.
                he sayth: Quid? an non licebat ipsi eligere? Licebat &amp; quidem maxime &amp;c. What? and was it not lawfull for him to choose (Matthias?) Yes truely it was most lawfull, but he did it not, because he would not seeme to gratify any. Also againe after a while, he saith thus, Primus hic Doctorem constituit &amp;c. he (to wit Peter) did first heere make a Doctor;
               A notable discourse of S. Chrysostome prouing S. Peters Supremacy. 
               he said not, we are sufficient to teach &amp;c. quamquam autem habebat ius constituendi par omnibus, tamen haec congruenter fiebant &amp;c. Albeit he had as much authority to appoynt him as they all, yet this was done very conueniently. So he, giuing to vnderstand, that notwithstanding Peters absolute power to choose Matthias himselfe alone, yet out of prudence he determined rather to do it by the generall consent of all the Apostles, which he also signifyed no lesse plainly afterwards in these words: Meritò primus omnium &amp;c. he doth worthily first of all the rest vse, or exercyse his authority in this busines, as one that had all the rest in his hand, or power, for to him Christ sayd: &amp; tu aliquando cōuersus, confirma fratres tuos, and thou being sometyme conuerted, confirme they brethren.
            
            
               17. All this saith S. Chrysostome, concerning the the election of Matthias the Apostle, whereby it appeareth playnly, that he held S. Peter to be head of the Apostles, and of the whole Church, seeing he teacheth not only that he was the Prince in that Congregation, but also that he had as much authority, to make an Apostle, as they all, and might haue done it of himselfe (if he had thought it fit, and conuenient) because he had them all in his hand. So as it is cleare, that when S. Chrysostome in the 55. homily vpon Matthew (which the Cardinall alledgeth) calleth S. Peter verticem Apostolorum, the head of the Apostles, and saith that Christ made him power of the Church, and that he gaue him authority ouer the whole world, he meaneth, and teacheth manifestly that he was supreme head, and Pastor of the vniuersall Church: which is the same in substance, and effect, that those words, Cuius pastor &amp; caput, do signify.
            18. Therefore the doctrine being S. Chrysostomes, as well in that homily alledged by the Cardinall as els where, and the words also themselues (which perhaps may be wanting in some Greeke copie) being extant, as they are cyted by the Cardinall, in all our Latin translations, it is but a vayne shift of M. Andrews to say, that they are thrust into the Latin in fauour of the Pope, it being more probable (as I haue sayd) that they were in the old Greeke copies, which the Latin translatours followed, and that eyther the Grecians themselues in the time of their schisme from the Roman Church, or perhaps some of our late heretikes (who haue taken vpon them to print the Greeke in these dayes) haue purposely left out the same, in hatred of the supreme authority of S. Peter, and his

successors. But howsoeuer it is, you see the doctrine of S. Chrysostome is cleare to the purpose that those words (which M. Andrewes saith are not in the Greek) do import: and this suffiseth to proue by the testimony of S. Chrysostome, that S. Peter was supreme Pastor and head of the vniuersall Church.
            
               A stale trifeling conceyt touching the word 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   againe brought in by M. Andrews19. And as for M. Andrews his stale, and tryfling deuyse to call the Pope 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                (alluding to the name of the beast in the Apocalyps, according to the interpretation of Irenaeus, as he would haue his Reader to suppose, albeit he vse it far otherwise then Irenaeus meant it, who applyed it only to the temporall Empyre, and not to the Roman Sea) I willingly omit it, as not pertayning to the place of S. Chrysostome wherof I now specially treat, and therefore do remit him for his satisfaction in that point to Cardinall Bellarmines controuersies,
                  Bellar. de Rom. Pon. lib. 3. cap. 10. §. Secunda opinio.
                where the same is so sufficiently answered, that he, and his fellowes may be ashamed still to repeat it, and not to impugne the manifold, and solid reasons which the Cardinall produceth to confute their ridiculous, and absurd application of that name to the Pope.
            20. And now to end concerning the testimony of S. Chrysostome; whereas M. Andrews for conclusion of his answere thereto saith, that no man will deny that Peter was Pastor of the Church, yea and a principall pastor, sed cum alijs pastorem coapostolis suis, non solum sine alijs,
               A dreaming fancy of M. Andrews. but Pastour togeather with other his fellow Apostles, and not alone without others; I thinke he was in a dreame when he wrot
                  •
                it, impugning no man therein for ought I know. For I neuer heard tell of any man yet, who taught that S. Peter was Pastor of the Church alone, or that the other Apostles were not

Pastors as well as he,

                     . 39.40. &amp; 41. albeit we teach with S. Chrysostome, and others, as you haue heard, that they were subordinate to him, as to the supreme pastor, and their head;
                  Card. Bell. Apolog. vbi supra. Supple. chap. 4. which also M. Andrews himselfe doth acknowledge sufficiently, as I haue shewed amply in the last Chapter. And this I hope may suffice concerning S. Chrysostome.
            
            21. There remayneth now only S. Augustin of the 4.

                   4. post Domin. Palma.
                Fathers alledged by the Cardinall and my selfe for the proofe of S. Peters Primacy: his words are these: Totius corporis morbum in ipso capite curat Ecclesiae &amp;c. he (to wit Christ) cureth the disease of the whole body in the very head of the Church, &amp; cōpoundeth the health of all the members, in ipso vertice (that is to say) in the very crowne, or top of the head: Thus saith S. Augustin: whereupon the Cardinall saith:
                  Andr. vbi sup.
                
               Sanctus Augustinus apertè vocat S. Petrum caput corporis Ecclesiae. S. Augustine doth planily call S. Peter head of the body of the Church.M. Andrewes bold assertion without all proofe. To this M. Andrewes saith thus: Concludít testes suos cum Augustino, non Augustino, cuius tempore non fiebant Sermones de tempore. He (to wit the Cardinall) concludeth his witnesses with an Augustine, who is not Augustin; in whose tyme there were not made any Sermons de tempore. So he, taking exceptions to the authority of this allegation, because in S. Augustins tyme (as he would haue vs suppose) there was no such custome in the Church, to make Sermons de tempore (that is to say of the ordinary feasts that do occur thoughout the course of the yeare) and that therefore the Authour of those Sermons de tempore, out of the which the Cardinall taketh this place, could not be S. Augustins, but of some other later wryter, who set them out in S. Augustins name.
            
               22. But now if you aske how M. Andrews proueth that there were no Sermons de tempore in S. Augustins tyme, you must take his bare word for a proofe, for you neyther haue, nor are like to heare any other of him. But for the tryall of this matter I must remit thee, good Reader, to some better, and more authenticall witnesses then M. Andrewes, namely to Possidius a learned Bishop, who being a familiar friend of S. Augustin forty yeares togeather (as he signifieth himselfe) wrote his life,
                  Possidius in vita Augustin. Indic. Possid. cap. 9. &amp; 10. and making a Catalogue of his workes doth mention amongst the rest diuers Sermons, or Treatises of his made of some of the principall feasts of the yeare, as of Christmas, Ascension, Pentecost, Lent, and 23. Tracts, or Sermons per Vigilias Paschae, in the Eues of Easter (whereof by all likelyhood this very Sermon was one, being made on the Wednesday before Easter:) whereto may be added also diuers other particuler feasts of Saints, mentioned in like manner by Possidius, as namely the Natiuity of S. Iohn Baptist, of the Apostles S. Peter and S. Paul,
               
                  Ibidem.
                of S. Laurence, S. Cyprian, S. Perpetua and Felicitas, S. Saluius, S. Vincent, and some others which I omit, for that these I trow may suffice to conuince M. Andrews of great ignorance, or malice in that he denyeth that there were any Sermons de tempore, in S. Augustins tyme.Sermons were made de tempore both in the Latin
                     •
                   and in the Greeke Church in S. Augustins tyme.
            
            23. For although it is like inough that neyther S. Augustin, nor any other Father of that age, wrote any work vnder the title of Sermones de tempore (but that such sermons being made at diuers tymes, and dispersed in diuers parts of their workes, haue bene since their daies gathered into one volume, and set out vnder that tytle for the ease, and commodity of the

Readers) yet no man that hath byn conuersant in the Fathers can be ignorant that such were vsually made both in the Latin and in the Greeke Church in S. Augustins tyme;
                  Ambros. To. 5. Serm de tempore.
                which may euidently appeare (besids the testimony of Possidius aforesaid) by the works of S. Ambrose, wherin there are Sermons vpon almost all the great feasts from Aduent to Pentecost:
                  S. Maximus.
                and in the same tyme liued also S. Maximus Bishop of Turin, who wrote diuers homilies vpon the principall feasts of the yeare,
                  Gennadius de viris Illustrib.
                as testifyeth Gennadius a famous writer of that age, whereof I shall haue occasion to speake further hereafter. Besids that it cannot be denyed that the like custome was also in the Greeke Church in those daies,
                  Gregor. Nyssen.
                seeing that we fynd in S. Gregory Nissen (who was S. Basils brother) diuers Orations made vpon the feasts of the Natiuity of our Sauiour,
               
                  Gregor. Nazian.
                
               S. Stephen, Easter, and the Ascension; And others also in S. Gregory Nazianzen vpon the feasts of Easter,
               
                  Chrysost. To. 3. 
               Pentecost, the Natiuity of Christ, the Epiphany (which amongst the Greekes was called Sancta Lumina.) In like manner diuers homilies in S. Chrysostom of the fifth feria in Passion week, and of the Resurection, and Ascension of our Sauiour, and of Pentecost, besids diuers others of particuler Saints, as S. Fulgentius S
                  •
                
               Augustines schooler, and others. So that this exception of M. Andrews to the authority of this place of S. Augustin is tooto cold, and friuolous, and far vnworthy of a man that professeth to haue read the ancient Fathers, and therefore truely he had reason to seeke out another answere that might be of some more weight, which he frameth in these words: Sed nec si tempori cedamus, hic tamen testis satis in tempore venit &amp;c.
               
                  Andr. vbi supra.
                
               But though we should yield to tyme (he meaneth that albeit we should

graunt that Sermons were made de tempore in those daies) yet this witnes commeth out of tyme, or season, &amp; very vnluckily, who doth not tell vs of any other head but of a sickly head, nor of any other crowne of a head, but a crazed,
               M. Andrews rauing fit. or crackt, crowne, which therefore might very well haue been passed with silence.
            
            24. Thus raueth M. Andrews, hauing his head so crazed with the frenzy of heresy, that he vttereth such braynsick, and idle stuffe, as this, which truely no man that were well in his wits, would vtter to the purpose he doth, that is to say, to proue that S. Peter was not head of the Church. For els why doth he say it? seeing that the Cardinall cyteth this place to no other end, but to proue that S. Peter was head of the Church,S
                     •
                   Peters fall no preiudice to his Primacy. and therefore M. Andrews giuing this for his second answere (hauing as you haue seene great reason to mistrust the former) must needs conclude thereupon, that S. Peter was not head of the Church. But how doth it follow, that because S. Peter by fraylty denyed our Sauiour, Ergo, he was not head of the Church? Do those that hold, and teach his primacy, deny his fall? Or teach that his successours cannot also erre in matter of fact, as he did, though not in definition of matters of faith?
            25. Truly if M. Andrews eyther had a sound brayne, or els were guyded by the same spirit that S. Augustine and other fathers were, he would haue made another manner of construction of this place then he doth, and rather haue sought to confirme S. Peters Primacy by his fall, then to impugne it thereby, for so doth S. Augustine in this place, shewing that it was conuenient, that almighty God should suffer him to fall, because he was to be the gouernour and head of

the Church, which S. Augustine teacheth expressely in these words.
            26. Ideo B. Petrum paululum Dominus subdeseruit &amp;c.
               
                  S. Aug. ser. 124. de temp.
                
               Our Lord did therefore forsake blessed Peter for a while, to the end that all humane kind might know in him, that without the grace of God it could do nothing, and thereby a rule might be giuen also to him (who was to be gouernour of the Church) to pardon sinners; for the keyes of the Church were to be committed to Peter the Apostle, yea the keyes of the Kingdome of heauen were recommended vnto him: as also in like manner there was to be committed to his charge an innumerable multitude of people,
               S. Augustine teacheth that S. Peter was permitted to fall because he was to be supreme head of the Church. 
               which in respect of the vyces and passions of their nature were wrapped in sinnes, and offences. And againe after a while: Idcirco, saith he, diuinae prouidentiae secretum &amp;c. Therefore did the secret of Gods prouidence so dispose, and permit, that he (to wit Peter) should himselfe first fayle and fall into sinne, that by the consideration of his owne fall he might temper the rigour of his sentence towards sinners: Quantum igitur diuini inuneris &amp;c. Therefore note what great bounty, and goodnes, and how much care and sollicitude God sheweth heerin towards the saluation of man, he c
                     •
                  reth the disease of the whole body in the head of the Church, and compoundeth the health of all the members in the very crowne of the head, &amp; in the very top of the cōfession of Christ, in the very foū
                  datiō of an immoueable faith, that is to say, in that Peter, who said, although I should dye with thee, yet I will not deny thee.
            
            27. All this saith S Augustine, and much more to the same purpose, which I omit for breuityes sake, for that this may suffice to teach M. Andrews that S. Peters Primacy was so far from being preiudyced by his fall, that it may rather be in some sort confirmed thereby, seeing it appeareth, that it was conuenient in respect

of his Primacy, that he should fall for the benefit that should ensue thereof,The same also taught by S. Chrysostome.
                as well to himselfe, as to the Church which is also the expresse doctrine of S. Chrysostome, who hauing said, that Orbis terrarum Ecclesiae &amp;c. the Churches of the whole world,
               
                  S. Chrysost. hom. in S. Petrum &amp; Eliam.
                
               and the multituds of people were to be committed to his charge. And hauing also called him Apostolorum verticem, the head of the Apostles, the immouable foundation, the steedfast rock, the pillar of Churches, and mayster of the whole world, he addeth, Peccare permissus est &amp;c. he was suffered to sinne, for this cause chiefly, because the multitude of people was to be committed vnto him, lest he being seuere and innocent might be vnwilling to pardon the offences of his brethren.
               
                  S. Greg. ho. 21. in Euangel.
                So he: to whome I may also adde S. Gregory the Great, who maketh the same construction of S. Peters fall that these two other Fathers do, affirming that God suffered him to fayle, quem praeferre cunctae Ecclesiae disposuerat, whome he had determined to make gouernour of all the Church, that he might learne by his owne fraylty to haue compassion of other sinners.
            28. And to the end M. Andrewes may see that S. Augustine doth also else where plainly acknowledg the Primacy of S. Peter notwithstanding his fall;Another place of S. Augustine acknowledging S. Peters supremacy notwithstanding his fall. See Andr. cap. 1. pag. 16. lin. 17. he shall do well to read a place alleadged by himselfe in his first chapter, to proue that S. Peter had nothing peculiar to himself by his pastorall commission; which place if he had layd downe at large (as he curtolled, and maymed it after his manner) it might haue sufficed to conuince him, as well in the matter for the which he produced it, as also in this. For there S. Augustin hauing taught that S. Peter receauing the keyes, &amp; the cōmission of Pastor, represented the person of the Church, inferreth that the Church ought to pardon repentant

sinners, seeing that Peter bearing the person of the Church was pardoned whē he had denyed his maister.
                  Aug. de agone Christ. cap. 30.
            
            29. Wherein S. Augustine not only deduceth a pious document out of S. Peters offence (as you see he doth in the other place) but also acknowledgeth sufficiently his supreme Dignity,
               
                  See before Chap. 1. nu. 3.4. &amp; 5. teaching that he bare the person of the Church, which he did no otherwise, but as he was supreme head, and Gouernour thereof, as I haue declared at large in the first Chapter of this Adioynder, where I haue layd downe the words of S. Augustine,
               
                  Cyril. in cap. vlt. Ioan.
                and discouered M. Andrews his fraud more particulerly,
                  Vbi supra nu. 23. &amp; 24. and produced also a cleare testimony of S. Cyril concerning the Primacy of S. Peter (whome he calleth Principem &amp; Caput Apostolorum: the Prince &amp; head of the Apostles) though he do there grant his fall which he saith hapned by humane infirmity,
               
                  Bellar. de Rom. Pont li. 1. c. 25. whereof M. Andrews cannot be ignorant, seeing he cyteth also that place of S. Cyril, no lesse then the other of S. Augustin, though with greater fraud, as I haue also shewed in the first Chapter.
            30. Finally I may add to these, those other testimonies which I haue now lastly examined, and debated with M. Andrewes out of S Cyril, S. Hierome, S Basil, and S. Chrysostome, as also the rest of that grand Iury of 24. Fathers, Greeks, and Latins alledged by Cardinall Bellarmine in his controuersies to proue the supreme authority of S. Peter ouer the Apostles, all which most learned, and ancient Fathers, being the lights of the Church, knew as well as M. Andrews, that S. Peter had denyed our Sauiour, and yet neuertheles did not take the same to be any preiudice to his Supremacy. Whereupon I conclude, that if their heads were sound, then M. Andrews his head must needs be very

sick and crazed, seeing his sense, and iudgment is so far different from theirs, as to seek to ouerthrow, or disproue S. Peters Primacy by his fall, and to speake of him so contemptibly, and opprobriously, as he doth.
            31. But will you heare how well he mendeth the matter? Marke him well, I pray you, and you shall see that as his head hath ben hitherto somewhat crackt, so now he is become wholy distract, talking as idly, as if he were more fit for Bedlam then for a Bishoprick. For hauing sayd, as you haue heard before, that this testimony of S. Augustine was vnluckily produced by the Cardinall, because it giueth vs notice of no other head, but of a sickly head (to wit S. Peter) and that therfore it might very well haue bin pretermitted, he goeth forward thus:
                  O caput elleboro dignum!
                
               Praesertim cùm eùmdem morbum in capite vestro notarint diu iam medicorum filij. et si omnes non ego, id est, plus ego quàm omnes: especially seeing that the Phisitians children haue now a long tyme noted the same disease in your head, although all not I, that is to say, I more then all. Thus saith he, so mystically I assure you, that he seemeth to propound a riddle, and therefore may do well to explicate his meaning, and let vs know who were those Phisitians, and their children that haue noted the same disease in our head.
            
               The later hereticks do follow the old.32. Neuertheles for as much as it may be presumed, that by the children he meaneth Luther, Caluin, Beza and himselfe, with other Sectaries of this age, we may also make a reasonable coniecture who were the Phisitians, seeing that we are not ignorant that the true progenitours of all the Sectaries aforenamed, were dyuers old heretykes, whose herefies they haue reuyued; namely the 
                  Aug. de Vnit. E

               Aerius whome they follow in denying Sacrifyce for the dead; 
                  Hieron aduers. Vigilant.
                
               Vigilantius with whome they impugne the reuerend vse of reliques; 
                  Idem. contra Iouin.
                
               Iouinian who taught diuers points of their beliefe touched particulerly in the last 
                  See before chap. 3. nu. 34. &amp; 35. Aug. de vtilitate credendi cap. 17. Chapter, and other Arch-heretikes condemned by the Church in ancient tyme, who (as S. Augustine witnesseth) vsed also to barke (though in vayne) against the Sea Apostolike, no lesse then these their children do.
            33. But although we may ghesse who were the Phisitians, and their children, yet it will not be so easy to coniecture what he meaneth by etsi omnes non ego, id est plus ego quàm omnes: although all not I, that is to say, I more then all; for truely I haue shewed it to diuers, and haue not found two that agree in the interpretation of it, but the most probable seemeth to be the one of two; one is, that he alludeth to the words of S. Peter,
               
                  Marc. 14.
               
                  Matth. 26. when he sayd etsi omnes scandalizati fuerint sed non ego: Although all shall be scandalized, yet not I, who neuerthelesse was scandalized more then they all, because he alone denyed his mayster: which sense hath great difficulty, because it neyther hath connexion with that which goeth immediatly before, nor is truly applicable to the Pope (of whome M. Andrews seemeth there to treate) but is only contumelious to S Peter (being a taunting kind of exprobration of his fall) and therefore me thinkes M. Andrews should not admit it to be his meaning, as sauouring too much of impiety.
            34. The other sense is, that it should be referred to M. Andrews himselfe, and that there is some litle fault in the print, I mean in the points, though not in the

words, which therefore should be pointed this, &amp; si omnes, non ego? and if all, not I? that is to say, if all haue noted this disease in your head, why should not I note it? Giuing to vnderstand, that he will not yield to any of his brethren for zeale, &amp; skill in noting the faults of Popes, but rather, plus ego quàm omnes, that is to say, therein will I go beyond them all:M Andrews zeale greater then his wit. which sense hath at least some good coherence with the precedent clause and well befitteth M. Andrews his zeale to the Ghospell and hatred to the Pope, and so may passe for his meaning. But whatsoeuer his meaning is, I cannot forbeare to tell him, that seeing his brayn is so intoxicated that he cannot write intelligibly, and yet will take vpon him to play the Physitian, and to cure the Popes diseases, I will say to him with our Sauiour Medice cura teipsum, and wish him to purge his owne head,A good recipe for M. Andrews. with some good quantity of a drug called Catholicon, and a litle Helleborum to restore him againe to his right wits, before he presume to be the Popes Physitian, and to iudge of the diseases of the head of the Church.
            35. And whereas he goeth forward to shew vs a difference in the cure of Peters disease, and of the diseases of his Successors, let vs follow him a while, and you shall see him runne as well out of his honesty, as out of his wit. For thus he saith: 
                  Sed ab eo morbo sanatum hoc caput &amp;c. But this head (to wit S. Peter) was healed of this disease, but your head (he meaneth the Pope) neyther will be healed, nor yet is curable: yet if he euer be healed, let him be the head of the Church of Rome,
                  Three notorious lyes. as he was in Augustines tyme, but, let no man appeale to him from beyond the sea, or if any appeale, he is to be excommunicated by Augustine, who was

far from acknowledging Zosimus, Bonifacius, and Celestinus for heads of the Church, in whome neuertheles he cured the same disease.
So he, which I beseech thee good Reader, well to note, and thou shalt see his conscience no lesse crackt then his brayne, ioyning extreme falsity with folly, abusing the authority not only of S. Augustine, but also of the whole Councell of African Bishops (though he name S. Augustin only, and none of the other) and finally vttering 3. notable lyes in litle more then 3. lynes. The first is, that the  Pope had no further authority but ouer his Church of Rome in S. Augustines tyme. The second, that no man  might in those daies appeale to the Sea Apostolicke out of Africk. The third, that S. Augustine was far  from acknowledging those three Popes Zosimus, Bonifacius, and Celestinus to be heads of the Church, yea and that he cured S. Peters disease in them. Of these 3. points, the first wilbe fully cleared by the discussion of the second and the third.
            36. First then concerning the second, whereas M. Andrews affirmeth that all Appeales from Africk to Rome were forbidden by S. Augustin,
               Concerning the prohibition of appeals from Afrike to Rome obiected by M. Andrews. vnder payne of excommunication, wee shall neede no other witnesse to conuince him, but S. Augustine himselfe, who teacheth the flat contrary not only in expresse words, but also by practise, as it will euidently appeare after a whyle; for albeit there was a controuersy betwixt the Church of Africk, and the Roman Sea, in S. Augustins tyme, partly about appeales to Rome, and partly about the Canons of the Nicen Councell, for that a Canon related by the Popes Legate, as out of the said Councell, was not found in the Copies that were then in Africk (whereof the causes may be seene at large as

well in Cardinall Bellarmins Controuersies,
                  Bellar. de Rom. Pont l. 2. c. 25. Baron. an. 419. as in the history of Cardinall Baronius, who doe fully answere all our aduersaryes cauills concerning the same:) albeit, I say, this controuersy continued some 4. or 5. yeares,A controuersy betwixt the Bishops of Africk, &amp; the Sea of Rome cō
                  cerning the prosecution of Appeals. and grew in great part, by reason of abuses cōmitted by some of the Popes legates, in the rigorous, and violent execution of the Popes sentences (which may suffice to proue the comon vse of Appeales from Africk to Rome in those daies) neuertheles it is euident that during the tyme of this controuersy there was no prohibition of the appeales of Bishops from Africk, to Rome; for that all the African Bishops agreed to continue the wonted course of Appeales without innouation, vntill they should haue answere out of Greece, concerning the Canons of the Nicen Councell.
            37. And when they had receaued the same, they were so far from excommunicating such as should appeale to Rome, or from prohibiting the same, by a Synodicall Decree, that they only wrote a common letter to Pope Celestinus, wherein they did not impugne the right of Appeales to Rome, but shewed their dislike of the manner, and meanes that had ben vsed in the prosecutiō thereof. And whereas there were 3. wayes vsed by the Sea Apostolyke in the prosecution, and decision of appeales,Three wayes vsed in the prosecution &amp; decision of appeales. the first, by calling the parties and witnesses to Rome; the second, by sending Legates to the place from whence the appeales came, with commission to heare, and determin them, sometymes with the assistance of the Bishops of that prouince, and sometymes without them; and the third, to remit the matter wholy to the determination of the Metropolitan, or of some Prouinciall Synod of the same

country (as S. Gregory the great did in Africk dyuers tymes, whereof I shall haue occasiō to lay downe some examples 
                  infra nu. 47.48. &amp; 49. heereafter:) of these 3. wayes I say, the African Bishops held the two former to be very inconuenient for them, but tooke no exception at all to the third way (which was to remit the causes to be tried at home by the Metropolitans or by Prouinciall Synods) &amp; therfore the reasōs which they vrged, tended especially to proue that it was most conuenient, &amp; conforme to the Councell of Nice, that causes should be decyded by the Metropolitans, and Synods of the same Country, where the controuersy should ryse; and this the Pope might haue graunted (if he had thought it conuenient) and yet haue reserued to himselfe the right of appellation, and haue decyded Appeales also by his commission, as it shall further appeare after a while by the practise of S. Gregory.
            
            38 But put the case,
                  Ibid.
                that S. Augustine, and the Bishops of Africk had required of Pope Celestinus to be quite rid of Appeales, what will M. Andrewes infer thereon? Will he say, that therefore they decreed, vt transmarinus nemo appellet, &amp; si appellet excommunicandus, that no man appeale out of Africk, and that if he doe, he shallbe excommunicated? Will he infer this vpon their demaund, or petition? I say their petition, for that when they come to treate of that matter in their Epistle,
                  To. 1. Concil. in Concil. Africano ca. 10
                     •
                  . they begin it thus: Praefato debitae salutationis officio impendiò deprecamur, vt &amp;c. The office or duty of due salutations premised, we do most earnestly beseech you, that you will not ouer easily giue eare to such as come from hence &amp;c. Will then M. Andrewes make no difference betwixt demaunds, and decrees? petitions, and prohibitions? must he not rather confesse that the

               African Bishops acknowledged that Pope Celestinus had power to dispose appeales? For otherwyse why did they rather seeke satisfaction by letters to him, then resolue by some Synodicall decree to exclude his authority, and to debar him from further medling in those affaires? as it is like they would haue done, had they had byn perswaded that his authority in that behalfe was vsurped. But let M. Andrewes take the request of the African Bishops in what sense he list (I meane eyther for the exclusion of Appeales, or for moderation in the prosecution of them) yet he can neuer make good his forgery of transmarinus nemo appellet &amp;c. it beeing most euident,M. Andrews his forgery. that neyther these petitions of theirs, nor any Canon of the African Synods, nor yet any one word in S. Augustin did euer prohibite all Appellation from Africk to Rome, or yet cause any surcease, or interruption thereof, nor yet hinder the moderate and conuenient prosecution of appeales; for the proofe whereof I shall not need (as I haue said) to produce any other witnes then S. Augustine himselfe, and his owne practise not past 5. or 6. yeares before his death in the cause of a Bishop called Antony, whome he had made Bishop of Fussula.
            
            39. It is therefore to be vnderstood that this Antony being depriued of his Bishoprick by a Synodicall sentence of African Bishops (for his outragious misdemeanours) appealed to Rome to Pope Bonifacius,
               
                  S. Aug. ep. 261. The case of Antony Bishop of Fussula appealing to Rome. wherupon the Pope being moued partly with the Primats letters, and partly with such other testimony as Antony had cunningly produced for his purgation, resolued to returne him to his Bishopricke (yet with this expresse condition, as S. Augustine witnesseth, if the information

which he had giuen, were found to be true) but before it could be executed, it chanced that Pope Bonifacius dyed, and Celestinus succeeded him.
            40. And for as much as many rumours were spred in fauour of Antony, that he should be restored by the Popes sentence, and the same executed by violence with the help of secular power, if need were (as the like had byn also vsed in former occasions) the people of Fussula were so exasperated therewith, that they were like to fall to tumult, and conceiued no small indignation against S. Augustine himselfe, complayning of him to the Pope, because he had made Antony their Bishop, wherewith he was so afflicted, that he wrote a most pittifull letter to Celestinus successor to Bonifacius lamēting greatly his owne mishap in that he had made such an vnworthy Bishop;
                  Ibid.
                and recommended the decision of the case to his wife, and charitable consideration, saying thus amongst diuers other things:S. Augustine his dutifull respect to Pope Celestinus. 
               Collabora nobiscum pietate venerabilis, Domine beatissime, &amp; debita charitate suscipiende sancte Papa &amp;c. Most blessed Lord venerable for thy piety, and holy Pope, to be receaued with due charity, labour togeather with vs, and commaund that all those things which are sent, be read, or related vnto thee. So he.
            41. And whereas Antony being depriued of the Bishoprick, and remayning still with the tytle, had greatly vrged, that seeing he had still the tytle of Bishop of Fussula, he ought also to haue the Bishoprick,
                  Ibid.
                
               S. Augustine made instance on the other side, that the sentence giuen against Antony might stand, for that it was conforme euen to former sentences giuen in like cases by the Sea Apostolike, and therefore he saith: Existat exemplo ipsa Sede Apostolica iudicante, vel aliorum

iudicata firmante &amp;c. Let it serue for an example, the Sea Apostolike either iudging so it selfe, or els confirming the iudgments or sentences of others. So he, and then addeth diuers examples of Bishops, who being depriued of their Bishoprikes retayned still their tytle; and sayth moreouer thus.
            
               
                  Ibid.
               
               
                  Ego Fussulenses Catholicos filios in Christo meos &amp;c. I doe recommend to the benignity of the charity of your Holynes, as well the Catholike people of Fussula my children in Christ, as Antony the Bishop my sonne also in Christ, for that I loue them both &amp;c. Let both of them deserue your mercy; they, that they may suffer no ill, he, that he may do no ill; they, lest they may hate the very name of Catholike, if they receiue no help from Catholike Bishops, especially from the Sea Apostolike against a Catholike Bishop; and he, lest he may commit so great a wickednes as to alienate those from Christ, whome he seeketh to make his owne against their wills &amp;c. Finally S. Augustine concludeth thus: Si autem membra Christi quae in illa regione sunt &amp;c. If you do relieue the members of Christ which are in that quarter (he meaneth Fussula) from the deadly feare and sorrow wherein they liue, and do comfort my old age with this mercifull iustice, he will reward you, as well in this present life, as in the future, who doth by you succour vs in this our trouble, and hath placed you in that seat.
            
            42. Thus wrote S. Augustine to Celestinus the Pope, and much more to the same purpose, intreating most earnestly for the people of Fussula, especially that there m
                  •
               ght be no violence vsed to restore Antony, and therefore hauing signified what was reported and feared in that behalfe,
                  Ibid.
                he said, non sinas ista fieri per

Christi sanguinem &amp;c. suffer not these things to be donne for the bloud of Christ, and for the memory of Peter, who admonished the gouernours of Christian people not to exercise a violent dominion amongst their brethren. So he; giuing a necessary aduise to Pope Celestinus, though with all humility, as you see, to preuent the inconueniences that were feared, and had hapned before by the indiscreet, and violent proceeding of some of the Popes Legats in like cases. And so far was he from any meaning to oppose himselfe to the Popes authority,
                  Ibid.
                or to the restitution of Antony (in case the Pope should haue ordayned it) that he resolued for his part, as he signified, that, if he could not obtayne his sute of Celestinus he would renounce his Bishoprick, and retyre himselfe to a priuate life, to do penance, for hauing bene partly the cause of so great a scandall, in making Antony Bishop.
            43. By all which it appeareth how far S. Augustine and other Bishops of Africk,
               The primate of Numidia in Africk approued the Appeale of Antony to Rome. were from denying the Popes authority to admit Appeales, seeing that the primate of Numidia himselfe assisted Antony in his Appeale to Pope Bonifacius; and S. Augustine wrote also to Celestinus concerning the same with such submission, as you haue heard, not threatning to excommunicate Antony for his Appeale to Rome (as M. Andrewes would haue vs to suppose, saying: si appellet, ab Augustino excommunicandus, if any man appeale he is to be excommunicated by Augustine) but most humbly, crauing mercifull iustice, and moderation in the decision of the cause. So as we must needs say, that eyther S. Augustine contradicteth himselfe and his owne actions (which is not credible) or els that M. Andrewes hath belyed him in this poynt, as indeed he

hath; and therefore he had reason not so much as to quote in his margent any place of S. Augustine for the proofe, or confirmation of his assertion.
            44. Neuertheles for as much as he mentioneth an excommunication threatned by S. Augustine to all such as should appeale from Africk to Rome,
               
                  Concil. Mileu. Can. 12. he seemeth to ayme at a Canon of a Coūcell held at Mileuis, where S. Augustin was present, in which Synod it was indeed ordayned vnder payne of excommunication, that no Priests or Deacons, or other Clergy men of the inferiour sort should appeale from their owne Bishops and Memetropolitans in Africk to Bishops beyond the seas. And to the end M. Andrewes his cosenage may the better appeare, I will set downe the Canon it selfe, which is this: Placuit, vt Presbyteri, Diaconi, vel inferiores Clerici &amp;c. we haue ordayned that Priests, deacons, and other inferiour Clergymen, if in the causes which they shall haue, they complaine of the iudgments of their Bishops, they may be heard by the Bishops their neyghbours &amp;c. And if they shall thinke it necessary to appeale from them, that they appeale not to any, but to the Councells of Africk, or to the Primats of their owne Prouinces; Ad transmarina autem qui putauerit appellandum &amp;c. and he that shall thinke it conuenient to appeale to the parts beyond the seas, shall not be admitted to the communion of any within Africke. Thus saith that Canon. And who seeth not, that those words (qui putauerit appellandum &amp;c. he which thinketh conuenient to appeale) are to be referred only to those of whome the Canon expressely speaketh immediatly before (to wit,M. Andrewes Transmarinus nemo.
                
               Priests, and Deacons, and other inferiour Clergymen) and therefore do not any way concerne Bishops, and much lesse exclude all Appeales, as M. Andrewes doth with his transmarinus nemo.
            
            
               45. To which purpose it is to be considered that this Canon is conforme to another made many yeares before in the great generall Councell of Sardica,
               
                  Concil. Sard. ca. 17. approued by Pope Iulius the first (in which Councell also the Appeales of Bishops to Rome were expressely confirmed) besides that the very Councell of Mil
                     •
                  uis in which this Canon was made,
                  S. Aug. ep. 92. &amp; 93. was receaued, and confirmed by Pope Innocentius the first, as it shall appeare further after a whyle. So that this Canon which concerneth only the appeales of inferiour Clergy men, and not of Bishops, and was admitted by the Popes themselues did not any way preiudice the right of Appeales to Rome, or the authority of the sea Apostolicke; and this also may be clearely proued out of S. Augustine himselfe, who writing to the Donatists, and reprehending them for their temerarious presumption in excommunicating, and condēning Caecilianus the Catholike Bishop of Carthage, aduertised them with all of their folly, in that they considered not how vayne their attempt was therin, and how litle cause Caecilianꝰ had to care for their sentēce, seing it was free for him to reserue his cause to the iudgement of other Bishops beyond the seas, and especially of the Apostolyke Church, meaning there by especially the Apostolyke Sea of Rome, which he alwayes called the Apostolyke seat, or Apostolike Chayre, per antonomasiam, as it may be noted in diuers places of his workes (whereof I haue alledged some already, and shall haue occasion to alledge others hereafter) insomuch that when he speaketh of the Apostolicke Church, or Apostolicke seat, or Apostolike chaire, without naming any in particuler, he speaketh vndoubtedly of the Roman Church
            
            46. And therefore he saith in the same Epistle to

the Donatists that Caecilianus might well contemne the multitude of his enemyes,
                  
                     •
                  . Aug. ep. 1.62. seeing that he held communion, as well with the Roman Church) in qua semper Apostolicae Cathedrae viguit principatus, wherein the principality, or soueragnity of the Apoctolike chayre hath alwayes florished) as with other Catholicke countryes from whence the Ghospell was brought to Africk &amp;c. Moreouer in the said Epistle he maketh playne distinction betwixt the Appeales of Bishops, and Priests, saying: neque enim de Presbyteris &amp;c.
               S. Augustine testifyeth that appeales to Rome were allowed to the Bishops of Africk though prohibited to the inferour Clergy. 
               Neyther was the question heere concerning Priests, or Deacons or other Clergy men of the inferiour sort, but concerning our collegues, who may reserue their cause entyre, and whole to the iudgement of other their collegues, and especially of the Apostolicke Churches. So he: whereby it appeareth, that albeit he signifieth that there was a restraynt of Appeales of Priests, and inferiour Clergy men (according to the Canon of the Councell of Mileuis) yet he graunteth that Bishops had free liberty to appeale out of Africk to the Apostolike Churches, and especially to the Romā Church, wherein (as you haue heard him say before) Apostolicae Cathedrae semper viguit principatus, the soueraignty of the Apostolike chayre hath alwayes florished.
            47. And to the end it may appeare, that neyther the Councell of Mileuis,
               Examples of Appeales from Africk to to Rome. nor yet the petition of the African Synode to Pope Celestinus, did hinder the course of appeales to Rome, or the decision of them in Africk by the Popes authority, I will conclude with some examples very notable for this purpose. The first shalbe of Lupicinus a Bishop of Mauritania in Africk, restored to his seat shortly after S. Augustines tyme, by the sentence of Pope Leo,
               
                  S. Leo ep. 87. ad Epis. Maurit.
                who also sent thither

a Bishop called Potentius, as his Legate, and the Bishops of Africk admitted him, albeit the African Synod had requested Pope Celestinus to send no more Legats thither.
            48. Another example may be of a comission sent by Pope Gregory the Great to an Agent, or officer of his in Africk,
               
                  S. Greg. Regist. lib. 1. ep. 82. called Hilarius, to assemble a Prouinciall Synod there, for the examinatiō of a complaynt made to him by two deacons Felicissimus and Vincentius, against Agentius their Bishop, in which commission order was giuen to Hilarius punctually to execute the sentence of the Synod.
                  Idem ibid. lib. 10. ep. 31. &amp; 32. Also the same Pope, hauing heard the complaints of certayne Priests in Africk against Paulinus their Bishop, committed the hearing, and decision of the cause to Victor the primate of Numidia, and Columbus, with other Bishops, giuing them commission to heare and determyn it amongst themselues,
                  Ibid. lib. 10. ep. 8. except they should thinke the assistance of his officer Hilarius needfull for the better determination of the cause.
                  Ibid. ep. 35. In like manner a complaynt being exhibited to the said Pope by Donadeus a Deacon, against Victor his Bishop, he deputed the foresaid Columbus, and other Bishops to examin the cause, and to punish the Bishop if he were found in fault. And the like commission he gaue also to a Synod of Bishops held at Bizacium in Africk, for the tryall of the cause of Clementius their Primate.
            49. Now then in these examples two things are to be noted, the one that the Popes vsed to decyde appeales, and other controuersyes, in diueres manners, sometymes ordayning and disposing thereof by their Legats or other officers, and sometymes giuing no other commission to their said Legats, and officers, but

to assemble some Prouinciall Synode, and to see the sentence thereof executed: and sometymes againe giuing all power, and authority to the Metropolitan, &amp; Bishops of that country to decyde the causes; which last way, and manner of tryall was no way repugnant to the request of the African Synod in their letter to Pope Celestinus,
               
                  Supra nu. 36. as I haue signifyed before.
            50. The other thinge to be noted, is, that the Popes vsed still iure suo,
               The request of the African Bishops to Pope Celestinus concerning appeals, neyther did nor could preiudice the right of the sea Apostolick. their owne right (notwithstanding the forsaid request of the African Synod) yea, and that the Bishops of Africk approued, and acknowledged the same by their obedience, knowing full well that the petitions of their predecessors to Celestinus rested wholy in his will and pleasure, to be granted, or denied, as he should see cause, whereof 
                  •
               here fell out shortly after an euident example, and proofe in the Councell of Calcedon: for albeit the Fathers of that famous generall Councell not only made earnest sute to Pope Leo by a common letter to obteyne the second place after Rome for Constantinople, but also ordayned, and decreed it by a speciall Canon, neuertheles Pope Leo denyed their sute, disanulled their decree, and forced the Authors thereof to acknowledge their errour, as I haue amply proued in the second 
                  See cap. 2. nu. 24. &amp; seq. vs
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      ad nu. 28. Chapter; and therefore much more might Pope Celestinus deny the request of a Prouinciall Synode, and might also haue disanulled their decrees, if they had made any preiudiciall to the Roman Sea, as they did not.
            51. And now to conclude vpon these premisses 3. things do euidently follow thereon. The first, that  the Appeales of Bishops from Africk to Rome were neuer prohibited, or so much as interrupted by any decrees, or Canons, and much lesse by the letters of the

               African Synode to Pope Celestinus. The second that  the Canon of the Councell of Mileuis which M. Andrewes seemeth to alledge (as forbidding appeales to Rome, vnder payne of excommunication) did only concerne Priests and Deacons, and other Clergy men of the inferiour sort, and therefore did not prohibite the Appeales of Bishops, and much lesse of all men in generall, besides that being made with the Popes consent it was not any way preiudicall to the authority of the Sea Apostolike. The third, that M. Andrews iugleth  notably with his Reader, when he saith as out of S. Augustine,
               M. Andrews maketh no bones to falsify whole Synods and bely the Fathers. 
               Ad eum transmarinus nemo appellet &amp;c. To him (that is to say to the Bishop of Rome) let no man appeale from beyond the seas: or if he appeale, he is to be excommunicated by Augustine, for neyther those words nor the sense thereof are to be found any where in S. Augustine, who, as you haue seene, expressely taught and practised the contrary. So that transmarinus nemo being set downe by M. Andrews in a different letter to be noted, is indeed worth the noting for a notable falsity, and a flat corruption of the Canon, and abuse of S. Augustine, and of all the Bishops in that Councell. What then shall we say of this mans truth, and fidelity who maketh no bones to bely the Fathers,It is proued S. Augustine acknowledged the Popes Zosimus, Bonifacius and Celestinus, for heads of the Church. and corrupt whole Synods? Can any man thinke that he hath any regard of conscience, or shame? Thus much for the second point.
            52. And now to say somewhat of the third, he affirmeth as you haue heard, that S. Augustine was far from acknowledging the Popes Zosimus, Bonifacius and Celestinus for heads of the Church, whereof you haue already seene the contrary in two of them, to wit Bonifacius, and Celestinus, whose power, and custome

to admit, and determyne Appeales from Africk, S. Augustine clearely acknowledged, and approued in the cause of Antony Bishop of Fussula (as I haue amply 
                  See before nu. 38.39. &amp; seq.
                shewed) which power could not otherwise be due to Bonifacius, and Celestinus, but only in respect of their supreme, and vniuersall authority ouer the whole Church.S. Aug. ep. 157. ad Optat.
                And that S. Augustine had also the same opinion of Zosimus, it appeareth sufficiently in an Epistle of his to Optatus, to whome he writeth, that he receaued his letters at Caesarea, quò nos (saith he) iniuncta nobis à venerabili Papa Zosimo Apostolicae sedis Episcopo Ecclesiastica necessitas traxerat; whither we were drawne by an Ecclesiasticall necessity, inioyned, or imposed vpon vs by the venerable Pope Zosimus, Bishop of the Apostolicall seat. So he; which may also be confirmed out of Possidius, who writeth, that Litterae sedis Apostolicae compulerunt &amp;c. The letters of the Sea Apostolike compelled Augustine with other Bishops to go to Caesarea in Mauritania,
               
                  Posidius in vita Augustini
                
               to consult and determyne of diuers necessityes of the Church.
            
            53. Whereby it is manifest that S. Augustine acknowledged in Pope Zosimus an Ecclesiasticall power, and authority to impose vpon him, and other Bishops a necessity to obay his commaundements in matters concerning the seruice of God, and the Church, which Zosimus could not do otherwise then as supreme and vniuersall Pastor, or head of the Church, for that the Church of Africk was not otherwise subiect to him, then as all other Churches were. But of Pope Zosimus, and of S. Augustines opinion concerning his Primacy I shall haue occasion to speake further after a while: and in the meane tyme this I hope may suffise to proue that S. Augustine was so far from impugning these

three Popes, that he acknowledged their supreme and vniuersall authority, and consequently that they were heads of the vniuersall Church, notwithstanding M. Andrews his peremptory assertion of the contrary, which therefore may passe for another vntruth.
            54. Whereupon it also followeth, that he forgot himselfe much more when he so confidently affirmed in the first poynt, as you haue heard, that the Bishops of Rome in S. Augustines tyme, were but only heads of the Church of Rome, which I noted before. For the first of the 3. vntruthes, though I remitted the particuler answere thereof vntill I had discouered the other two, because they would not a litle help to the discouery of the first, as you may haue already noted; for it being cleare by all this former discourse that Appeales from Africk to Rome were vsuall, frequent, and neuer prohibited in S. Augustines tyme; and againe that he acknowledged an authority and power in Pope Zosimus to lay iniunctions, &amp; commaundements vpon him, and other Bishops in Africk, it must needs follow that the Bishops of Rome had a more ample authority in his dayes then ouer the particuler Church of Rome.
               8 Popes. who liued in S. Augustins tyme, exercysed a supreme &amp; vniuersall authority. And to the end thou mayst yet haue, good Reader, a more aboundant satisfaction in this poynt, I will say somewhat of all the Popes that liued in S. Augustines tyme who were 8. in all, to wit Liberius (in whose tyme he was borne) Damasus, Siricius, Anastasius, Innocentius, Zosimus, Bonifacius, &amp; Celestinus. And first of Liberius.
            
            55. We read in the Ecclesiasticall history, that certayne Arian heretykes being excommunicated,Pope Liberius. and deposed from their Bishopricks by the Catholike Bishops

of the East Church sent their Legats to Pope Lib

                  rius crauing to be restored by his authority, and for as much as they craftily dissembled their heresy, and faygning to be repentant, made open profession of the Catholicke faith, according to the beliefe, and doctrin of the Councell of Nice, they obtayned his letters for their restitution,
                  
                     •
                  . Basil ep. 74. &amp; 82. which they presented at their returne in a Synod held at Tyana, and by vertue thereof were restored, as S. Basil witnesseth, saying, that Eustathius Bishop of Sebasta (who was the chiefe of that Legacy) brought an Epistle (from Liberius) by the which he should be restored, and when he had presented it to the Synod at Tyana, in locum suum restitutus est, he was restored to his place. So he.
            56. Whereby it appeareth that the authority of Liberius extended further then to his owne Church of Rome; seeing he could restore Bishops to their seats in the East Church, as also his predecessor Pope Iulius had done not long before, vpon the appeales of the famous Athanasius deposed by the Arians, and of Paulus Bishop of Constantinople, Marcellus Bishop of Ancyra, Asclepa Bishop of Gaza, and Lucian Bishop of Hadrianopolis, all of them vniustly expelled from their seats vpon diuers pretences; whose causes Iulius discussing (saith the Story) tamquam omnium curam gerens propter propriae Sedis dignitatem singulis reddidit suas Ecclesias, as hauing a care of all for the dignity of his owne seat restored their Churches to euery one of them.

                     •
                  n in the tripartite history, which I haue thought good to add to the former example of Liberius. For although it fell not out in S. Augustines tyme (whereof I now specially treate) yet it was not aboue 14. yeares before him, and therefore may well be applyed

to his tyme, as the Eue to the Feast. Besides, that doth demonstrate what was the beliefe of the Catholike Church at that tyme concerning the supreme dignity of the Roman Sea, seeing that not only other Catholike Bishops, but also Athanasius himselfe (who was the mirrour of sanctity, zeale, and integrity in that age) had recourse thereto, as to the supreme tribunall on earth, for the reparation of his wrongs; but now to proceed.
            57. After Liberius succeeded Damasus,

                whose vniuersall authority is sufficiently testified euen by the African Bishops, whome M. Andrewes maketh most opposit to the Roman Sea. This may be veryfied by an Epistle of 3. Councells of Africk, and the Archbishop Stephanus, who wrote to Pope Damasus, giuing him the title of most Blessed Lord, raysed to the heyght of Apostolicall dignity,

To. 2. calleth him the gouernour of the Church of God; expounding these words of the Apostle to Timothy: Ecclesia est domus Dei viui &amp;c. whereupon he saith, Ecclesia domus Dei dicitur, cuius rector hodie est Damasus: the Church is called the house of God, the gouernour whereof at this day, is Damasus So he; wherto I may add a notable testimony of S Hierome, who wryting also to Damasus to know of him, with whome he might communicate in Syria, and whether he might vse the word hypostasis, affirmed that he held Cōm
                     •
                  nion with his Beatitude, that is to say (saith he) with Peters Chayre, and that he knew the Church to be buylt vpon the rock, inferring thereupon, that whosoeuer did eate the Lambe out of that house (he meaneth the communion of Damasus, or of Peters Chayre) he was a profane man, and out of the Arck of Noe: wherupon I infer, that S. Hierome affirming the Church to be built vpon Damasus, acknowledgeth him to be head thereof, for the reason vrged 
                  Chap. 3. nu. 17.18.19. &amp; 20. before by me in the last chapter, to wit, because the head of a mysticall, or politicall body, and the foundation in a buylding are all one; besyds that he also acknowledgeth the same, by excluding all those from the vnity of the Church, who did not hold communication with Damasus, because the vnity of the body is deriued principally from the vnity of the head thereof, according to the expresse doctrin of S. Cyprian, which I haue also amply layd downe in the last 
                  nu. 4.5.6.

                Chapter.
            59. Finally, S. Hierome demanding resolution

from Damasus with whome he should cōmunicate in Syria (where was then a great Schisme) and whether he might vse the word hypostasis, sheweth, that Damasus had authority to determyne,What authority S. Hierome did attribute vnto Damasus.
                and decyde controuersies and resolue doubts, or difficult questions in matter of religion; and therfore S. Hierome saith vnto him, Discernite, siplacet, obsecro, non timebo tres hypostases dicere, si iubetis: I beseech you iudge, or determyne, if it please you, for I will not feare to say that there are three hypostases, if you command me. And againe afterwards; Quamobr
                     •
                  m obtestor Beatitudinem tuam per crucifixum &amp;c. Therefore I beseech your Beatitud for Christs sake crucified, and for the consubstantiall Trinity, that authority may be giuen me by your letters, eyther to vse, or to forbeare the word hypostasis &amp;c. as also that you will signifie vnto me, with whome I may communicate at Antioch; for that the Campenses, and the heretikes called Tharsenses being vnited togeather, nihil aliud ambiunt, quàm vt auctoritate communionis vestrae fulti &amp;c. do seeke nothing more, or with greater ambition, then that being vpheld with the authority of your communion, they may vse the word hypostasis in the old sense. So he.
            60. Wherin two thinges are to be noted, the one that S. Hierome doth not aske counsaile or aduise of Pope Damasus, but a definitiue sentence (vt auctoritas detur, that authority be giuen him) that is to say, that Damasus should by his letters determin and ordein what S. Hierome should doe in those cases. The other is that not only the Catholikes in the East parts (as S. Hierome and the Aegyptians, whome he also called the collegues of Damasus) but also the heretyks sought to fortifie themselues, by the communion and authority of the Sea Apostolike. Whereupon two things do also

follow euidently: the one, that Damasus had power to decyde and determyne controuersies euen in the East Church; and the other, that his authority was not restreyned to his owne Church at Rome, as M. Andrews seemeth to suppose, but was vniuersall, and therefore acknowledged as well in the East, as in the West.
            61. This may be notably confirmed by the restitution of Peter Bishop of Alexandria to his seat, who immediatly succeeded Athanasius, and being oppressed by the Arians, followed the example of his worthy predecessour, and fled to Rome to Pope Damasus,
               
                  Socrat. lib. 4. ca. 30. and returning with his letters (which confirmed as well his creation, as the Catholike faith) was restored by the people, qui illis confisus (saith Socrates) expollit Lucium, &amp; Petrum in eius locum introducit; who by the vertue of those letters expelled Lucius the Arrian Bishop, and put Peter into his place.
            62. Also Vitalis an heretike in Antioch being accused to Pope Damasus of heresy, was forced to come to Rome to purge himselfe:
                  Elias Cretens. in ep. 2. ad Cledō. Greg. Nazian. Baron. an. 373. To. 1. Concil. ep. 1. Damas.
                and albeit after he had there professed himselfe to be a Catholike, he was remitted by Pope Damasus to Paulinus Bishop of Antioch for his final absolution, yet Damasus prescribed to Paulinus a forme of abiuration, whereto Vitalis should subscribe; which being done Paulinus absolued him. Whereby it is euident that Damasus had a supreme authority as well in the East, or Greeke Church, as in the West; for otherwise neyther would Peter Bishop of Alexandria (who was a very holy man) haue appealed vnto him, nor the people haue receaued Peter by the vertue of his letters; neither yet would Vitalis haue gone from Antioch to purge himselfe at Rome, nor Paulinus Bishop of Antioch permitted that Damasus should intermeddle in

matters pertayning to his charge.
            63. And this may yet further appeare by the earnest endeuours of S. Chrysostome then Bishop of Constantinople, and Theophilus Bishop of Alexandria to pacify Damasus towards Flauianus Bishop of Antioch;
                  Sozom. li. 8. cap. 3. who had committed periury, and byn the cause of a great diuision and trouble in the Church, for the remedy wherof they sent Embassadours to Rome to perswade Damasus that it was necessary for the good of the Church,
                  Socrat. li. 5. c. 15. that he should pardon the offence of Flauianus, for the concord and peace of the people; which being graunted by Damasus: &amp; communione (saith Socrates) Flauiano ad hunc modum reddita: and Flauianus being by this meanes restored to the communion of the Church, the people of Antioch were in tyme reduced to concord, and vnion with him.
            
            64. Whereto Theodoretus addeth,
                  Theodor. lib. 5. cap. 23. that the Emperour Theodosius in the tyme partly of Pope Damasus, and partly of his successor Syricius and Anastasius, laboured to procure the reconciliation of Flauianus with the sea Apostolick, and commaunded him to goe to Rome to answere for himselfe which he promised to doe in the spring following, though he did not performe it. Finally the Emperour made his peace with the Pope in the end, vpon condition that Flauianus should send his Embassadours to Rome, which he did (saith Theodoretus) with a sollemne embassadge of Bishops, Priests, and Deacons, vnder Acacius Bishop of Berroea, who was at that tyme a man of great fame; whereupon all the Bishops of Aegipt (who vntill then would not communicat with him) admitted him to their communion. So that albeit the Historiographers do differ concerning the tyme when Flauianus was reconcyled

with the Pope, yet they all agree, that he could neuer be fully restored to the peace, and communion of the vniuersall Church, vntill he had submitted himselfe to the Roman Sea, which sheweth euidently that the Bishops of Rome had far greater and more ample authority, then M. Andrewes doth affoard them. Thus much concerning Damasus.
            
            
               P. Syricius.65. And now to come to his successor Syricius, it is euident euen in this cause of Flauianus (by the testimony of S. Ambrose) that his authority extended it selfe to the Greek, and Eastern Church, no lesse then to the Latin, and West Church; seeing that in a Synod held at Capua,

                     •
                  lus Bishop of Alexandria, and to the Bishop of Aegipt, with this limitation (as S. Ambrose witnesseth) that the approbation, and confirmation of their sentence should be reserued to the Roman Sea, and the Bishop thereof, who was then Syricius. In like manner we fynd that his authority was admitted and acknowledged not only in Spayne, and France, but also in Africk,
               
                  To. 1. Concil. inter Siricij ep. &amp; decret.
                as it may appeare by his Decretall Epistle writtē to Himerius, or Himericus Bishop of Arragon in Spayne, in answere of diuers demaunds of his, in which epistle he ordayned that those his decrees should be sent by Himerius, as well to Carthage in Africk, as to Portugal, and France, and that they should be of no lesse force there, and els where, then in Arragon.
            
            66. To this will I add a testimony of an African Father that liued in the tyme of Siricius,
               
                  Optat. li. 
                  
                     •
                  . contra Parmen.
                to wit of Optatus Bishop of Mileuis, who clearely deduceth the primacy of Syricius from the primacy of S. Peter: for writing against Parmenian the Donatist, and vrging him

that he could not deny but that Petrus omnium Apostolorum caput, Peter the head of all the Apostles sate first in the Roman chayre (wherof he also yieldeth these reasons, viz. that in the said chaire vnity might be kept of all men,The argument of Optatus Mileuitanus.
                that the rest of the Apostles should not euery one of them defend or callenge to himselfe a single chayre, and that he might be held for a Schismatik, and a wiked man who should set vp a chaire contra singularem Cathedram, against the singular, or principall chayre) hauing, I say, vrged this, he reckoneth all the Popes from S. Peter to his tyme, ending with Syricius, and concluding, that because the Donatists held not communion with him, therefore they could not haue the true Church.
            67. In this discourse it is manifest that as he acknowledgeth Peter for head of the Apostles, and his chayre for the singular, and principall chayre, so he also acknowledged Syricius for head of all other Bishops, and his chayre (which was Peters) for the principall chayre; for otherwyse his argument against the Donatists grounded on Peters supreme authority, had ben to no purpose. Besids that he saith also a litle after (prosecuting the same argument:) Legimus Principem nostrum &amp;c. We read that Peter our Prince receaued the wholsome keyes against the gates of hell &amp;c. Vnde est ergo &amp;c. How chanceth it then that you stryue to vsurpe to your selues the keyes of the Kingdome, who with your audacious presumption do sacrilegiously make warre against the chayre of Peter? So he.
            68. Therefore (omitting heere how aptly this may be applyed to M. Andrews and his fellowes as well as to the Donatists) that which I wish specially to be obserued, is, that Optatus being an African acknowledged

the same soueraignty in Syricius which he affirmed to be in S. Peter: for whereas he calleth him not only the head of the Apostles, but also Principem nostrum, our Prince; it is cleare that the principality, and soueraignty of Peter in the tyme of Optatus, could not be otherwise vnderstood, but in his successor Syricius, who consequently was Prince, and head of the Church as Peter was.
            69. The very same is taught also by S. Augustine concerning Pope Anastasius,
               Anastasius. who succeeded Syricius; for S. Augustine presseth the Donatists with the same argument that Optatus doth, and naming all the Popes vntill his owne tyme,
                  Aug. ep. 165. he endeth with Anastasius, hauing first deriued their lineall succession from S. Peter, Cui, saith he, totius Ecclesiae figuram gerenti &amp;c. to whome bearing the figure of the whole Church our Lord sayd: Vpon this rock I will buyld my Church: wherein it is to be noted, that S. Augustine acknowledging the primacy of S Peter, in saying, that the Church was built vpon him, and that he bare the figure of the whole Church (which he did not in any other respect but because he was head thereof, as I haue proued in the first Chapter of this Adioynder) he acknowledgeth the same in his successors, and namely in Anastasius, whome therefore he draweth by lyneall succession from S. Peter: and to this purpose it may be also obserued, that elswhere he ascribeth the great prerogatiue of S. Peter (to wit his being the rock, or foundation whereupon the Church was buylt) to his chayre, or seat, and to the succession of Bishops deriued from him, bidding the Donatists reckon the Priests,
               
                  Idem in psal. contra part. Donati.
                that had succeeded one another in Peters seat, and then concluding, Ipsa est Petra &amp;c. that is the rock which the proud gates of hell doe not ouercome:
               
whereby it is euident, that S. Augustine acknowledged Anastasius, and all other successors of S. Peter for heads of the vniuersall Church, seeing he affirmeth them to be the foundation thereof.
            70. This may be confirmed also by a Canon of an African Synod, where it was decreed, that letters should be sent to their brethren and fellow-Bishops abroad,
                  Concil. African. can 35. vide 
                        •
                     innium pag. 637. edit. Colon. 1606. and especially to the Sea Apostolike, to informe Anastasius, who then was Pope, how necessary it was for the Church of Africk, that such Donatists as being Clergy men should returne to the vnity of the Catholike Church, might be receiued and admitted, without preiudice to their former dignityes, if the Catholike Bishops that should receiue them, should thinke it conuenient, notwithstanding a Decree made to the contrary before, in another Synod held beyond the seas: whereby it appeareth that notwithstanding the great need which the Africā
                Church had of this decree (as they signifyed) yet they would not ordayne it without his knowledge and consent or rather, as it seemeth, they expected his leaue, and order to do it, and no meruail seeing that in other Synods and namely in the next following in the tyme of his immediate successor Innocentius
               
                  P. Innocentius.
                (of whome I am now to treat) the African Bishops craued confirmation of their decrees from the Sea Apostolike;
                  Ep. 90. inter ep. August.
                
               vt statutis, say they, nostrae mediocritatis etiam Apostolicae Sedis adhibeatur auctoritas &amp;c. That the authority of the Sea Apostolike may also be added to the statutes of our mediocrity, to conserue the saluation of many, and to correct the peruersity of some.
            
            71. Thus wrote they to Pope Innocentius, giuing clearely to vnderstand, not only that the validity of

their decrees depended vpon his confirmation, but also that the conseruation of the faithfull in the true faith and the correction of peruerse, and obstinate heretiks did specially belong to his care, and proceed from his authority. This will further appeare by another Epistle written to the same Pope Innocentius by them in another Synod held at Mileuis,
               
                  Ibid. ep. 92. as also by his answere to them. Thus then they wrote: Quia te Dominus gratiae suae praecipuo munere in Sede Apostolica collocauit &amp;c. Because our Lord hath by his speciall guift of his grace placed thee in the Apostolicall seat, and ordayned thee to be such a one in these our tymes that we should rather cōmit the fault of negligence if we should conceale from thy Reuerence those things that are to be suggested for the Church, then that thou canst eyther disdayne them, or contemne them; therefore we beseech thee, to vse and apply thy Pastorall diligence to the great dangers of the weaker members of Christ &amp;c. So they, whereby they shewed sufficiently their opinion concerning as well the worthynes of his person, as his Pastorall power and authority ouer all the members of Christ; as it will more euidently appeare by his answere, whic
                  •
                was this.
            72. Diligenter &amp; congruè Apostolico consulitis honori &amp;c.
               
                  Ibid. ep. 93. You do diligently, and conueniently prouyde for the Apostolicall honour, I meane the honour of him, who besides other intrinsecall things, hath the sollicitude, or care of all Churches (to declare what sentence is to be held in doubtfull matters) wherein truely you follow the rule that you know hath bene kept with me alwayes throughout the whole world &amp;c. So he: and a litle after, he saith further, that as often as there is question of matter of faith, all Bishops ought to referre

all that which is for the generall good of the Church to Peter, the authour of their name, and honour
               
                  •
                giuing to vnderstand that all Episcopall honour and dignity, and other Ecclesiasticall authority proceedeth immediatly from the visible head of the Church vnder Christ, that is to say, S. Peter, and his successors; and that therefore the cōdemnation of heresyes, &amp; determination of all doubts in faith ought to be expected and required specially from them.
            73. And to the end that M. Andrews may know that Pope Innocentius did not in this vrge his owne Apostolicall authority more then S. Augustine, and the other African Bishops approued; I wish him to read an Epistle of S. Augustine, and Alypius, where hauing sayd that relations were sent ex duobus Concilijs, Cathaginensi, &amp; Mileuitano ad Apostolicam sadem,
               
                  August. ep. 106. ad Bonifac.
                from the two Councells of Carthage, and Mileuis to the Sea Apostolike, they add afterwards (concerning the answere of Pope Innocentius) ad omnia illa rescripsit 
                     •
                  o modo, quo fas erat, atque oportebat Apostolicae sedis Antistitem: he (to wit Innocentius) wrote backe or answered to all things in such sort as was conuenient, and as the Bishop of the Apostolike Sea ought to do. So they; approuing as you see, not only the substance, and matter of his Epistle, but also his Apostolicall manner of writing, acknowledging it to be fit for a man of his Apostolicall dignity. So that it appeareth as well by the Epistle of the African Bishops to Pope Innocentius, as also by his answere to them, and their approbation thereof,Marke this consequence. that the Bishops of Rome in those dayes had, and exercysed a supreme authority in the confirmation of Synods, resolution of doubts, and condemnation of heresyes, and heretikes.
            
               
               The Pelagian heresy condemned by Zozsimus and Innocentius.
               74. Whereof there occurred at that tyme a notable example in the condemnation of the Pelagian heresy: for although the African Bishops did particulerly condemne it in their prouinciall Synods (which could not prescrybe lawes to the whole Church, yet the generall and vniuersall condemnation thereof, throughout the world proceeded from the authority of the Sea Apostolyke, and the seuerall sentences of the two Popes Innocentius, an Zosimus, which they signifyed in their letters not only to the Bishops of Africk, but also to all Bishops vniuersally, in respect of the vniuersall care,
                  Aug. ep. 157. and authority they had ouer the whole Church. And therefore S. Augustine saith, that the heretikes, Pelagius &amp; Celestius were, toto Christiano orbe dānati, cond̄ened throughout all the Christian world, by the vigilācy of the Episcopall Synods of Africk, etiā à Venerabilibus Antistitibus Apostolicae sedis Papa Innocentio, &amp; Papa Zosimo, and by the venerable Bishops of the Apostolick Sea, Pope Innocentius, and Pope Zosimus.
            
            75. Thus saith S. Augustine; which his great friend Possidius Bishop of Calama (who wrote his life) confirmeth,
                  Possid. in vita August. ca. 18. and explicateth notably, signifying that the 2. Popes Innocētius and Zosimus did (at the great instance of the Councell of Africk) cut off the Pelagians, from the members of the Church, and by letters directed to the Churches, as well of Africk, as of the East, and West, iudge them to be held as accursed, and to be auoyded of all Catholikes, Et hoc tale, saith he, de illis Ecclesiae Dei Catholicae pronuntiatum iudicium, etiam pijssimus Imperator Honorius audiens &amp; sequens &amp;c. and the most pious Emperour Honorius hearing, and following this such a notable Iudgmēt of the Catholike Church

of God pronounced against them, condemned them by his lawes,
               3. things to be noted in the precedent testimony of Possidius. 
               and ordayned that they should be held for heretikes. So he; wherein three things are specially to be noted. The first, that the Pelagian heresy was condemned vniuersally by the authority of the Sea Apostolike, to wit, by the sentence of the Popes Innocentius and Zosimus, signified by their letters, not only to the Churches  of Africk, but also to all other Churches; in which respect S. Augustine also in his foresaid Epistle to Optatus,
               
                  Aug. vbi supra.
                aduertiseth him, that he sent him the copies of such writings, and letters of the Sea Apostolike, as were come to his hands, concerning those matters, addressed eyther particulerly to the Bishops of Africk, or vniuersally to all Bishops.
            76. Another thing to be noted in the testimony  of Possidius, is, that he calleth the sentence of those two Popes Innocentius and Zosimus, Ecclesiae Dei Catholicae iudicium the Iudgement of the Catholike Church of God; which he could not haue done, but in respect of their supreme power, and authority to condemne heresyes, as heads of the whole Catholike Church. The third is, that albeit the Emperour Honorius condemned  also the Pelagians for heretikes by his temporall lawes, yet he did it no otherwise but audiens, &amp; sequens &amp;c. hearing and following the iudgment of the Catholike Church, that is to say, of those two Popes Innocentius and Zosimus; for of them he speaketh expresly.
            77. And now to proceed, if M. Andrews do yet desire any further proofe of this matter,
                  Prosper in Chron.
                let him read S. Prosper S. Augustines disciple, who sayth that a Synod of 217. Bishops being held at Carthage, their Synodicall decrees were sent to Zosimus: quibus probatis, per totum

                     〈1 page duplicate〉
                  
                  
                  
                     〈1 page duplicate〉
                  
                  
                  
mundum haeresis Pelagiana condemnata &amp;c. which being approued, the Pelagian heresy was condemned thoughout the whole world. And againe in another place he saith of Innocentius: Tunc Pelagianorum, machinae fractae sunt &amp;c. and then were the engines of the Pelagians broken, when Innocentius of blessed memory stroke the heads of their wicked errour with his Apostolicall sword.
               
                  Idem contra collat. ca. 41. So he, and a litle after he affirmeth the like of Pope Zosimus who added, saith he, the force of his sentence to the decrees of the African Councell, and armed the right hands of Bishops with the sword of Peter, ad detruncationem impiorum, for the excommunication of the wicked. So he; giuing to vnderstand, that not only the force of the African Synods against the Pelagians, but also the general condemnation of them throughout the world, proceeded from the authority of the Roman Sea: wherupon it must needs follow, that the said authority was vniuersall, and that the Bishops of that Sea (and namely Innocentius and Zosimus) were more then Caput Ecclesiae suae Romanae, heads of their Church of Rome.
            
            78. And albeit this might suffice cōcerning these two Popes; yet I cannot omit the most famous,The famous appeale of S. Iohn Chrysostome to Innocentius.
                and sollemne appeale of S. Chrysostome to one of them (to wit to Innocentius) to whome he sent 4. Bishops to complayne of his vniust banishment procured by Theophilus Bishop of Alexandria, and wrote also himselfe vnto him thus: Obsecro, vt scribat &amp;c. I beseech you write, and decree by your authority that these thinges which were so vniustly done (when I was absent,
               
                  Chrysost. ep. ad Inno. To. 5. 
               aud did not refuse to be iudged) may be of no force (as indeed of their owne nature they are not) and that those which haue done so vniustly, may be subiect to the penalty of the Ecclesiasticall lawes &amp;c.
               
Thus wrote S. Chrisostome with much more to the same purpose which he would not haue donne, if he had thought that the authority of Innocentius had byn lymited within the particuler Church of Rome, or rather if he had not knowne that his authority was vniuersall and sufficient to determyne his cause,
                  Palladius in vita Chrysost.
                which also was euident by the progresse and issue of the matter; for not only he as playntife appealed to Innocentius, but also Theophilus, as defendant sent a Priest of his called Peter with letters to iustifie his cause; besids that all the Bishops of the East,
                  Zosom. li. 8. ca. 26. and Greek Church (being in this controuersy deuided) sent messingers or letters to Rome in fauour of the one, or of the other, as witnesseth Palladius Bishop of Helenopolis,
               
                  Georg. Alexand. in vita Chrysost.
                who was S. Christostomes disciple, and went also to Rome to prosecute his cause, and further testifyeth that Pope Innocentius gaue sentence for S. Chrysostome, disanulling the act, and iudgment of Theophilus.
            
            79. And whereas Atticus was made Bishop of Constantinople after the expulsion of S. Chrystostome,
               
                  Idem ibid. Nicep. l. 13. ca. 34. 
               Innocentius suspended him frō his Episcopall function, vntill the causes should be fully heard,

Eccle. li. 5. c. 34. and determined, ordayning that in the meane tyme Proclus Bishop of Cyzicum should gouerne the Church of Constātinople. And albeit Innocentius forbare for sometyme to proceed against Theophilus by way of censure; yet after S. Chrysostomes death (who dyed in banyshment within 3. yeares) he excommunicated not only Theophilus, and Atticus for the excesses cōmitted on their part, but also Arcadius the Emperour, and Eudoxia the Empresse for assisting them with their Imperiall authority, as Georgius Alexandrinus, Gennadius, Glicas, and Nicephorus do testify. Finally although Theophilus remayned obstinate

so long as he liued (which was not past 5. yeares after S. Chrysostomes death) yet he dyed repentant, and Atticus after much suite and many Embassages sent (as Theodoretus testifyeth) was reconcyled to the Roman Church. As also Arcadius the Emperour vpon his submission, and humble petition of pardon was absolued by Pope Innocentius as appeareth by the letters of them both, which are set downe in Glycas. And thus passed this matter,
                  Glycas part. 4. Annal.
                which alone may suffice to proue the supreme, and vniuersall authority of Innocentius.
            
            80. And as for Zosimus, Bonifacius, and Celestinus, who succeeded Innocentius and were the 3. last Popes of the 8. that liued in S. Augustins tyme, I shall not need to say much, seeing that I haue already spoken sufficiently of them as of Zosimus a litle 
                  Supra nu. 74. before, concerning the condemnation of the Pelagian heresy, besides a former 
                  Supra nu. 52. &amp; 53. testimony of S. Augustine, touching an assembly of himselfe, and other African Bishops at Cesaraea, by the inuention or commaundment of Pope Zosimus. In like manner I haue

                     •
                  8. &amp; seq.
                shewed before that not only S. Augustine, but also the Primate of Numidia in Africk acknowledged the primacy of the Popes Bonifacius, and Celestinus by recommending to them the cause betwixt Antony Bishop of Fussula, and the people of that Diocesse, whereto neuertheles I thinke good to add concerning Bonifacius, that it appeareth by his letters to the Bishops of 7. Prouinces in France, that 
                  To. 1. Concil. ep. 2. Bonif.
               the Clergy of the Citty of Valentia sent to him a bill of complaynt with the testimony of the whole Prouince against Maximus an hereticall Bishop of the Manichaean sect, accusing him of many haynous crymes, and that thereupon Bonifacius did delegate the hearing

of the cause to the said Bishops,P. Celestinus head of the generall Coū
                  cell of Ephesus. whereby it is euident that his power, and authority was not confyned within the Church of Rome.
            
            81. And now to conclude with Celestinus, who was the last of the 8. methinks M. Andrews should not be ignorant how far his authority, and Iurisdiction extended, seeing that, it cannot be denyed that he was President and head of the generall Councell of Ephesus, and that the famous S. Cyril Bishop of Alexandria was but his substitute, and Legate therein, which is euident not only by the testimony

               Cyrillus to whome he wrote thus: Adiuncta tibi nostrae sedis auctoritate ipse qui vice nostra potestate

Thou shalt prouide his Church (of a Pastor) and he shall vnderstand that he is excluded from our communion &amp;c.
            
            82. Thus wrote Celestinus to Cyril, who therefore in his 
                  Ibid. To. 1. cap. 14. letters, to Nestorius signifyed vnto him, that if he did not recant, and reforme his errours within the tyme limited, and prescrybed by Pope Celestinus, he should be excommunicated, and depriued. And the whole Councell also pronouncing 
                  Ibid. To. 2. ca. 1

                  . Euag. lib. 1. ca. 4. Nicepho. l. 14. cap. 34. sentence of condemnation against Nestorius, affirmed, that they were compelled to vse that seuerity not only by the Canons of the Church, but also by the letters of Pope Celestinus: and 
                  To. 4. cap 17. Concil. Ephes.
                in their Epistle to the said Pope they signifyed, that they reserued, and remitted the cause of Iohn the Patriarch of Antioch (who was a fauourer of 
                  Niceph. li. 14. ca. 34 
               Nestorius,)

to his iudgment and sentence. Besides that Nicephorus testifieth that the common fame was in his time, that certayne priuiledges were graunted to S. Cyril, (which also his successours enioyed) by reason of his Legacy, and substitution to Pope Celestinus in that Councell and amongst other things that he had the title of Iudex vniuersi orbis, Iudge of the whole world.
            
               An euidēt argumēt that Celestinus was vniuersall and supreme Pastor of the Church.83. Now then I report me to thee, good Reader, whether Celestinus was no more then the head of his Church of Rome as M. Andrews maketh him. For is it likely that eyther S. Cyrill (who was Bishop of Alexandria, and consequently the first and chiefe Patriarke of the East) would haue stouped to be his substitute and Legate, and to receiue commissions and orders from him, or yet that the whole Councell, (beeing most of them also of the Greeke and East Church) would haue acknowledged themselues to be compelled by his letters to condemne Nestorius, yea and remitted the cause of the second Patriarke of the Greeke Church to his finall determination, if they had not taken him for the vniuersall and supreme Pastour of the whole Church? As I shewed also the like before in the second 
                  See cap. 2. per. 
                        •

                Chapter of this Adioynder, concerning the authority of Pope Leo in the great Councell of Chalcedon, which was held in the same age, not past 20. yeares after this other of Ephesus. So that M. Andrewes cānot by any meanes excuse himselfe from a manifest lye in this, no more then in other two poynts before mentioned.
            
               M. Andrews facility in 
                     •
                  ing.84. Whereby it appeareth euidently that he hath made 3. notable lyes as I may say with one breath, that is to say within litle more then 3. lynes, Besyds an

egregious corruption of the Canon, of the African Synod (with his transmarinus nemo) and a foule abuse as well of S. Augustine (in making him say, that which he neyther sayd, nor meant) as also of his Reader in seeking to perswade him, that S. Augustine excommunicated all those that would appeale to Rome out of Africk, yea and cured Peters-diseases in the 3. last Popes; for so he also saith, in quibus tamen eumdem morbum curauit, in whome, to wit (Zosimus Bonifacius, and Celestinus) Augustine cured the same diseases (that is to say the diseases of Peter) meaning as I take it, eyther Peters presumptiō of his owne strength or els his denyall of Christ: which neuertheles I cannot see how he can apply to them, and much lesse pretend that S. Augustine cured the same diseases in them.
            85. Therefore whereas his drift was no other in all this, as it seemeth but to perswade thee (good Reader) that S. Augustine was at daggers drawing with these 3. Popes, thou hast partly seene already by that which hath bene said concerning two of them to wit Zosimus, &amp; Celestinus, how much he hath sought to abuse thee therin, &amp; the like will also euidently appeare concerning Pope Bonifacius, if thou consider with what affection,
                  August. contra. duas ep. Pelag. lib. 1
                     •
                   
                  cap. 1. reuerend respect, and submission S. Augustine dedicated vnto him his 4. bookes against two Epistles of the Pelagians writing to him thus:
            86. Noueram te quidem fama celeberrima praedicante &amp;c. I knew thee truely before,
               S. Augustins dutifull respect vnto Pope Banifacius. 
               by the most famous report of thy renoumne, and vnderstood by many most frequent, and true relations, how aboundantly thou art replenished with Gods grace (most blessed and venerable Pope Boniface)

but after that my brother Alipius, had seene thee, and been receiued by thee with all benignity and sincerity &amp;c. I had so much more notice of thy Holinesse, by how much more certeyne is our amity; for thou, who takest no gust, or delight in high things (though thou art in a higher degree then others) dost not disdayne to be a friend to the meane and inferiour sort. So he; and afterwards hauing signifyed that he had vndertaken to write against 2. epistles of the Pelagians, he concludeth: Haec ergo quae duabus Epistolis &amp;c. These things therefore which I doe answere in this disputation to two Epistles of the Pelagians, I haue determyned to direct specially to thy Holynes, not as things needfull to be learned by you but to be examined, and amended if any thing do chance to dislyke you. Thus wrote S. Augustine to Pope Bonifacius: being so far from hauing any auersion or alienation from him, and much more from presumyng to cure any diseases in him (that is to say to correct any errours in his person or gouernment) that he shewed all dutifull loue and reuerend affection towards him, giuing notable testimony to his rare vertue, &amp; sanctity, and not only acknowledging the dignity of his seat, but also submitting himselfe and his workes to his censure, and Iudgment, to be examined corrected, and amended by him as he should see cause, whereby it appeareth that S. Augustine liued in perfect vnion with Pope Bonifacius.
            
            87. And in what tearmes he stood with Pope Celestinus (though we may gather it sufficiently by his owne letter 
                  See before nu. 38. &amp; seq.
                before mentioned concerning the Bishop of Fussula) yet it shall not be amisse to vnderstand it also by the testimony of Celestinus himselfe. It is therefore to be vnderstood that S. Augustine dying in the tyme of Pope Celestinus, and his workes (especially

those against the Pelagians) being by their practise much impugned and defamed in France S. Prosper who had been a disciple (as I haue sayd before) of S. Augustine, and was then Bishop of Aquitane, went purposely to Rome togeather with Hilarlus Bishop of Arles, to complayne thereof &amp; to procure the letters of Pope Celestinus in iustifycation of him, and his workes: Whereupon Celestinus wrote a generall letter to all the Bishops of France, as well in defence of S. Augustine, as in condemnation of the Pelagians, and amongst other things sayth of S. Augustine thus:
                  To. 1. Concil. ep. 1. Celest. S. Prosper contra Collator. cap. 42.

                  tionis virum pro vita sua &amp; meritis in nostra semper communione habiumus &amp;c. We haue alwayes held Augustine, of holy memory, in our communion for his life, and merits: neyther was he euer toucht with so much as any rumor of euill suspition, whome we haue knowne to haue been so learned,
               
                  Vincent. lirinens. cap. vlt.
                
               that he was held by my predecessours for one of the chiefe, or best maisters. So he.
            88. Whereby it is euident that S. Augustine euer liued in the vnion and obedience of the Roman Sea, for otherwyse Pope Celestinus would not haue giuen this testimony of him especially if he had byn so opposit to him, and his predecessours as M. Andrewes affirmeth, I meane if he had taken vpon him not only to correct, and reforme them, and to excommunicate euery one that should appeale to them out of Africk, but also to deny and impugne their supreme, and vniuersall authority which all Christendome acknowledged at that tyme, as I haue euidently shewed So that now I leaue it to thee, good Reader, to consider whether M. Andrews hath not (as it pleased him to say of S. Peter) caput morbidum, &amp; verticem malè sanum, being so possest and opprest with the peccant, or rather pestilent hereticall

humour of lying, that it floweth out of his mouth in such aboundance, as we see. And therefore whereas he pretendeth to descend of the race of Phisitians, and to be one of those Medicorum filij, who make speciall profession to pry into the diseases of Popes,M. Andrewes his Father, a Father of lyes. I may truly say that whosoeuer was his Grand father (were he Phisitian, or Apothecary) his father could be no other but the Father of lyes, from whome he hath contracted this pestiferous, and diuelish disease, which therefore being hereditary is, as it may be feared, incurable: in which respect we may more truely say of his head, then he said of ours, nec est sanum, nec vt videtur, sanabile.
            
         
         
            
            Mr. ANDREVVES HIS ANSWERS TO THREE OTHER PLACES Alleadged by the Cardinall out of the Fathers, are examined and confuted: and diuers absurdities discouered therin. AND Finally he is proued to be a Wrangler in the highest degree.
            CHAP. V.
            
               IN the two last Chapters I haue examined, and (if I be not much deceaued) fully confuted M. Andrewes his answers to 7. places of the Fathers, obiected by the Cardinall in his Apology, and by me in my Supplement. And whereas there are 3. other Authorityes

of the Fathers obiected togeather with the former by the Cardinall, and pretended also to be answered by M. Andrews, which I haue not touched any where in my Supplement, I thinke good to say somewhat thereto, lest if I should passe them with silence, it may seeme to some that M. Andrewes hath quit himselfe better in the answere of them, then of the rest; and that he hath bene able, at the least, to say somewhat to the purpose in defence of his cause.
            2. The First of the 3. places is alleadged by the Cardinall out of Origen thus:
                  Orig. in cap. 6. ad Rom.
                
               Petro cum summa rerum de pascendis ouibus traderetur, &amp; super ipsum &amp;c. When the chiefe or supreme charge of feeding Christs sheepe was giuen to Peter, and the Church founded vpon him, veluti super terram,
               A place of Origen is discussed. 
               as vpon the ground, the confession of no other vertue but only of Charitie was exacted of him. Thus far the Cardinall out of Origen to proue the primacy of Peter.
               
                  Andr cap. 2. pa

                   217. §. ex Origene.
                Whereto M. Andrewes answereth thus. Ex Orig
                     •
                  ne summam rerum &amp;c. Out of Origen the Cardinall obiecteth that the Chiefe charge of feeding Christes sheepe, was giuen to Peter,
               
                  Orig. in Matth. 16. Tract. 1. but the same Chiefe or supreme Charge was also giuen to others, as Origen doth els where plainly affirme, and if any thing were giuen there peculiarly to Peter, the same was giuen him in respect of his peculiar fall; super ipsum veluti super terram &amp;c. The Church was founded vpon him as vpon the ground; but it was also founded vpon others, togeather with him. Thus sayth M. Andrewes.
            
            3. Wherein I wish two things to be noted. The one, that heere he flyeth to his common and stale shift, to wit, that the rest of the Apostles had as much preheminence in all this as Peter: and that if he had any thing peculiar it was in respect of his fall, all

which I haue fully confuted to his shame in the first Chapter,
                  See cap. 1. nu. 3.6.23. &amp; 26. where I haue declared how he abused S. Augustine, S. Ambrose, and S. Cyril concerning this point, and therefore I will not trouble my selfe and my Reader with the Repetition thereof. The other is, that he seeketh to fortify this idle conceipt of his by the interpretation of Origen himselfe who he sayth teacheth expressely els where that others had the chiefe charge of feeding Christs flock as well as Peter, for the which he quoteth his first homily vpon the 16. of Matthew, where neuerthelesse Origen hath not one word touching the words, Pasce oues meas, but expoundeth there that which occurred in the 16. of Matthew, concerning Peters Confession of Christ,
                  Matth. 16. 
               Thou art Christ the Sonne of the liuing God, and Christs answere to him, Thou art Peter, and vpon this rock I will build my Church &amp;c. and I will giue thee the keyes of the Kingdome of heauen &amp;c. wherein it is also to be obserued, that Origen in that Homily followeth altogeather an Allegoricall sense, and seeking to drawe from thence some Morall doctrine (as preachers vse to do) applyeth the same not only to all the Apostles, as well as to Peter, but also to all perfect Christians, teaching that whosoeuer doth by the reuelation of God, and light of grace confesse Christ, as Peter did, he shall haue the same beatitude which Peter had, and be a Rock as he was; and that as euery true Christian and iust man doth participate of Christ, and therefore may well be called Christus, Iustitia &amp; Sapientia, so also he may be called Petrus &amp; Petra, and to this purpose Origen addeth further that the Church is built vpon such, and that hell gates shall not preuaile against them, meaning such iust men and perfect Christians as are of

the m
                  •
               mber of the elect, expounding the gates of hell to signify all kind of sinnes, as well as false doctrine.
            4. In like manner he applieth the giuing of the keyes, as well to euery faythfull Christian, as eyther to Peter, or to the rest of the Apostles, saying; Videamus quomodo dictum est Petro, &amp; omni fideli qui Petrus est, Dabo tibi claues &amp;c. Let vs see how it is said to Peter, and euery faithfull man which is Peter, I will giue thee the keyes of the Kingdome of heauen. And then he proceedeth, shewing that Christ promiseth the keyes to euery faithfull man in reward of his confession, vt ipse sibi aperiat portas Regni caelorū &amp;c. That he may open for himselfe the gates of the Kingdome of heauen. Which gates also Origen expoundeth to be the vertues of Chaslitic, and perfect Righteousnes, by the which the gates of heauen are opened (as it were with keyes) &amp; sic (saith he) in singulis quibusque virtutibus, and so also in all other vertues; and to this purpose is Origens discourse in that homily.
            5. Now then who seeth not heere, that he leaueth the litterall sense altogether in this, and lyke a preacher, followeth the Allegoricall and Morall, thereby to induce his audience to vertue, and withdraw them from vice and sinne? And will M. Andrewes say, that therefore Origens opinion was, that Peter had nothing promised peculiarly to himselfe more then to euery perfect Christan?By M. Andrews 
                     •
                  ad glosse euery good man and woman shall haue as much authority as S. Peter. So shall euery iust man and womā (for Orig
                     •
                  n speaketh of all alyke) haue as much Ecclesiasticall power and Iurisdiction as Peter had; for I am sure M. Andrewes will not deny, but that when Christ promised the keyes to Peter, he promised to giue him Ecclesiasticall Iurisdiction and power, howsoeuer the same is to be vnderstood, I meane whether as promised

to himselfe alone for the whole Church (as we vnderstand it) or as promised also to the Apostles equally with him (as M. Andrewes, and his fellowes would haue it) and therefore, I say, that taking this interpretatiō of Origen for the literall sense, euery faithfull man or woman that is of the elect hath as much power to bynd, loose, excommunicate, and exercise any other Ecclesiasticall Iurisdiction, as Peter, and the rest of the Apostles had: yea to be not only Pastors of Christs flock, but also chiefe Pastours and to haue summā rerum de pascendis ouibus, the chiefe charge of feeding Christs sheepe.
            6. For whereas Origen sayth so of S. Peter, in the place now in question; M. Andrewes will haue the same to be vnderstood also according to this Interpretation of Origen, which as you haue heard, includeth not only all the Apostles, but also euery other perfect Christian (yf he be of the elect) and excludeth all those that are not such: so as amongst other consequents that follow thereof, one may be
                  •
                that it is vncertayne whether M. Andrewes himselfe be a Pastour,
               A great doubt whether M. Andrews be a Pastor or not, if he vnderstand Origen aright. or no; for though he hold himselfe for a perfect Christian (which neuertheles I hold to be very doubtfull, or rather assure my selfe of the contrary) yet it is very vncertayne whether he be one of the elect, and if he be not of that number, then according to this interpretatiō (if it be literall) he hath no pastorall Cōmissiō. Besides, it would follow that euery Priest should haue as much authority as his Bishop, &amp; euery Bishop as much as his Metropolitan, yea and euery predestinate man, or woman (that is a perfect Christian) should haue as much as any of them, or as they all: seeing that all they can haue no more then summā rerum de pascendis ouibus,
               
the chiefe charge and care of feeding Christs flock
                  •
                which Origen saith was giuen to Peter.
               M. Andrews by his interpretation of Origen ouerthroweth all subordination in the Church. Loe then what good doctrine M. Andrews teacheth heere, by this Interpretation of Origen (if he will haue it to be litterall) ouerthrowing therby all subordination in the Church, and cōfounding the Ecclesiastical with the secular, the Laytie with the Clergy &amp; the head with the members, I meane the spirituall Pastours or sheapheardes of Christs flock, with their sheepe or subiects, which truly he would not do if he were not as silly and single witted as a sheepe, or at least, if he were not more malicious then a sheepe of Christs flock ought to be.
            7. Therefore to conclude this point, seeing that this Interpretation of Origen out of Origen serueth him to no better purpose then the other did before out of S. Augustine, S. Ambrose, and S. Cyril (which only serued to bewray his malice and folly,
                  Chap. 1. vbi supra.
                as I haue shewed amply in the first Chapter.) It is cleare that Origens testimony alleadged by the Cardinall (concerning the chiefe Charge of feeding Christs sheepe giuen to Peter) remayneth cleare,Other plaine places of Origen to proue S. Peters primacy. and sound for the Catholiks to be taken in the litterall sense as the Cardinall alleadged it, especially seeing it is most conforme to Origens doctrine in other places, as in his homilyes vpon diuers Euangelists,
               
                  Origen. in diuers. Euangel. hom. 2. where he calleth. S. Peter Summum Apostolorum verticem, the chiefe or supreme head of the Apostles; and therefore discoursing also afterwards in the same place of the particuler priuiledges of grace giuen by our Sauiour to S. Iohn the Apostle, he preferreth neuertheles S. Peter before him in dignity saying, Nemo nos existimet Petro Ioannem preferre &amp;c. Let no man thinke that I preferre Iohn before Peter. Who

would so do? for, which of the Apostles was hygher (in dignity) then he, qui est &amp; dicitur Vertex eorum? Who is called, and is their head. So he. And I am sure M. Andrews can not imagine that Origen deduced the supreme dignity of Peter from any other ground or reason, but because he had, summam rerum de pascendis ouibus, the chiefe charge of feeding Christs sheepe, and was the foundation of the Church, as Origen acknowledgeth in the place alleadged by the Cardinall, and diuers others: and this shall suffice for him.
            8. The second place which I am to debate with M. Andrewes is taken by the Cardinall out of S. Hylary in these words;
                  Card. Apol. cap
                        •

               A place of S. Hilary for S. Peters authority defended. that is to say of the Church. which (Rock) should dissolue or break the lawes of hell &amp;c. Thus far the Cardinall out of S. Hilary, to proue that Peter was the foundation, and consequently the head of the Church. Whereto M. Andrewes answereth thus. Ex Hylario, felix Ecclesiae fundamentum Petrum, out of Hilary the Cardinall obiected that Peter was the happie foundation of the Church,
                  Andr. cap. 8. pag. 218. §. ex Hylario.
                
               Sed inter alia pariter fundamenta, but amongst and togeather with other foundations. So he. Meaning that because all the Apostles are called in the Scriptures foundations of the Church, therefore S. Peter was no otherwise the foundation therof then they. Wherto I neede not to say any thing heere, because I haue largely treated the same point in the third Chapter, shewing how the Apostles were called foū
               dations of the Church,
                  See chap.

                  . without derogation eyther to Christ, who is the first, and chiefe foundation, or to Peter who is the second immediatly grounded

vpon Christ, and therefore I remit my Reader thereto.
            9. And now to go forward with M. Andrewes his answere, he addeth the rest of S. Hilaries words thus: Dignam aedificatione Christi Petram, a Rock worthie of the building of Christ; which wordes of Hilary he glosseth thus; sed fidei ratione &amp;c. but by reason or meanes of fayth (sayth Hilary himselfe) and not of his person, that Peter may depend on the fayth, and not the fayth vpon Peter.
               
                  M. Andrewes his shifting glosse. Thus sayth M. Andrews, seeking by the help of a lying glosse of his owne to make his Reader belieue, that S. Hilary doth so admit S. Peters fayth to be the foundation of the Church, that he excludeth his person; fidei ratione ait ipse Hilarius, non personae, sayth M. Andrewes, Peter was a Rock by the meanes of his faith, saith Hilary himselfe, and not of his person. So indeed saith M. Andrewes, but so sayth not S. Hilary. And therefore M. Andrewes thought best to quote no place of S. Hilary neither in the text nor in the margent; and sure I am that in the place which the Cardinall alleadgeth, S. Hilary speaketh expressely of S. Peters person, and not of his faith, except M. Andrewes can shew vs how faith was called by a new name, &amp; so made the foundation of the Church, as we can shew him, how Symon was called Peter, that is to say a Rock, to signify by that new name that he should be felix Ecclesiae fundamentū
                (as S. Hilary sayth) the happie foundation of the Church,
               S. Peters fayth not separated from his person in the sense and meaning of S. Hilary. &amp; receiue the keyes of heauen. In which respect S. Hilary addeth also in the same place, O Beatus caeli ianitor! O blessed porter of heauen! Neuerthelesse I would not haue M. Andrews to think that in affirming with S. Hilary that Peter was the foundation of the Church, I doe exclude his faith from his person,

as though S. Hilary should say or any Catholike man meane, that the Church was built vpon Peters person and not vpon his faith; but I do attribute the same so to his person, that I acknowledge therein the presence, concurrence, and merit of his faith, by the which he deserued to be made the foundation of the Church, and the porter of heauen, as S. Hilary calleth him.
            10. And therfore albeit S. Hilary in another place calleth the Rock of Cōfession, the foūdatiō of the Church, &amp; sayth also that fayth receiued the keyes of the heauenly Kingdome (which by all likelyhood is the place that M. Andrews meaneth, though he doth not quote it) yet in the same place he addeth cōcerning S. Peters persō, that supereminentem beatae fidei suae confessione gloriam promeruit,
               
                  S. Hilar
                        •
                      li. 6. de Trinitate.
                he deserued a supereminent glorie by the confession of his blessed fayth: and a litle after, hinc regni caelorum habet claues &amp;c. hereby, or in respect hereof (that is to say of his faith, or confession of Christ) he hath the keyes of the Kingdome of heauen, and his earthly iudgments are heauenly. Thus sayth S. Hilary, shewing euidently in what sense he sayth, that fayth &amp; the confession of Christ was the foundation of the Church, and that it receiued the keyes, to wit, because by the Merit thereof S. Peter deserued to haue the supereminent dignity or glorie to be the foundatiō of the Church,
                  Ibidem.
                and to haue the keyes; which he also signifyeth more plainely before in the same Tract, saying of Peters person, post Sacramenti confessionē beatus Simon aedificationi Eccl
                     •
                  siae subiacēs, &amp; claues regni caelestis accipiens &amp;c. Blessed Simon after the cōfessiō of the mystery, lying vnder the building of the Church (that is to say, being made the foūdatiō of the church) &amp; receiuing

keyes of the heauenly Kingdome &amp;c. So he. Where you see he ascribeth S. Peters being the foundation of the Church, as also his hauing of the keyes, to his person, though to shew the reasō &amp; cause therof, he addeth post cōfessionē Sacramenti, after the cōfession of the mystery.
            11. So that S. Hilary saying in one place, that Peter was the foundation of the Church, and in another affirming the same of his fayth, or Confession, doth not in either of both vnderstand his person without his faith, or yet his faith without his person (I meane abstracting his faith from his person) but considereth both ioyntly, that is to say, his person by the merit of his faith.One of M. Andrews his petty 
                     •
                  rauds. And therefore whereas M. Andrewes affirmeth, as you haue heard, that S. Hilary himselfe sayth, that Peter was the foundation of the Church fidei ratione, non personae, by the meanes of his faith, and not of his person, he may put vp non personae in his pocket, for S. Hilary hath no such word, neither that meaning, which M. Andrews would haue his Reader to gather thereof, that is to say, to exclude S. Peters person from the foundation of the Church. So as this may passe for a petty fraud, and a pretty cosening trick amongst many other of more importance, whereof you haue seene diuers already, and shall see more hereafter.
            12. There resteth now to be examined only one of the 3. places before mentioned, which is alleadged by the Cardinall out of S. Maximus thus:
                  Card. cap. 8. p. 125. 
               Quanti igitur meriti apud Deum suum Petrus &amp;c. Of how great merit do you thinke that Peter was with his God,
               
                  Maxim. ho. 3. de Apost. Pe
                     
                        •
                     ro &amp; Paulo.
                
               that after the rowing of a litle boat, the gouerment of the whole Church was giuen him. Thus far the Cardinall out of S. Maximus. To this M. Andrews saith: 
                  E Maximo (si tamen Maximus

is Taurinensis &amp;c.
                  
                     Andr. vbi supra pag. 219. §. E. Maximo.
                   The Cardinall obiecteth out of Maximus (if neuerthelesse this was Maximus of Turin and not some other later then he, if also in the tyme of Maximus Sermons were purposely made of the Apostles, as no doubt there were in the age after) Petro totius Ecclesiae gubernacula tradita &amp;c. the gouerment of the whole Church was giuen to Peter. But did euer any man thinke that the gouerment of any particuler Church was giuen him, except you who gaue him the gouerment of the Roman Church (as though the same were not part of the whole) after you haue giuen him the gouerment of the whole? So he: very mystically as he is wont, yet seeming to graunt (for ought I see) that Peter had the gouerment of the whole Church, which is the same 
                  ••
               at the Cardinall teacheth, and seeketh to proue by this place.
            13. But perhaps he will fly heere to his old shift, to wit, that though Peter had the gouerment of the whole Church, yet he had it no otherwise then the rest of the Apostles had. Concerning which point, I haue treated so amply before, that it were needles to repeat it heere, especially seeing that he seeketh no such euasion in this place, but seemeth to graunt as much as we demand; and only carpeth at vs for giuing to Peter the gouerment of the particuler Church of Rome,
               M. Andrews his phantasticall conceit. after we haue giuen him the gouerment of the whole. For so he saith; which truly is a fine conceipt, and right worthy of M. Andrews enigmaticall and phantasticall braine, who loueth to walk in mysts, and cloudes, to the end it may be vncertayne what he affirmeth, or what he denyeth: as for example, he graunteth heere or at least seemeth to graunt the doctrine of S. Maximus, which is, that Christ gaue the gouerment of the

whole Church to S. Peter; and yet presently after he seemeth to call the same in question againe, affirming, that we haue giuen him the gouerment as well of the whole Church of God, as of the particuler Church of Rome, saying: Romanae vestrae traditis &amp;c. postquam ei totius gubernacula tradidistis: You giue him the gouerment of the particuler Church of Rome, after you haue giuen him the gouernement of the whole.
            14. So that he suposeth here, that not Christ, but we haue giuen him both the one and the other, to wit the particuler, after the generall: whereby he seemeth also to affirme that S. Peter was not Bishop of Rome otherwise then in our conceit, and by our gift, adding withall a strange parenthesis (quasi ea totius pars non esset) as though the same particu
                  ••
               e Church of Rome were not a part of the whole; as who would say that S. Peter could not be gouernor both of the whole Church and of a particuler Church; wherein he argueth as wisely as if he should say, that a Bishop of Ely could not be Gouernor of the particuler Church of Ely, and of the whole Diocesse, or that a Bishop of Canterbury could not be Gouernour of that Bishoprick and Prymate of England, or that a generall of an Army could not gouerne a particuler Company, and be Generall of the whole Army.
            
               M. Andrews dull head more to be confoūded by blowes then persuaded by argumēts.15. But will M. Andrewes, trow you, be so absurd to say in good earnest that S. Peter was not gouernor of a particuler Church, or that we only (meaning the Catholikes of this age) haue made him so? Truly if he affirme this, and will stand to it, he is not to be confuted by arguments, but confounded by blowes, as a mad man that had need to be beaten into his witts, hauing (as Aristotle sayth of some) as much

need of punishment,

                  cap. 9. 
               as he should haue of sense, that should deny the snow to be white, for I thinke there was neuer any thing more clearly testified by all the Fathers of the Church, Councells, Historiographers Ecclesiasticall and prophane, vndoubted monuments of Antiquity, and all manner of Testimony then that S. Peter was Bishop of Rome, especially seeing that the continuall succession of Bishops in the Roman Sea from him, euen to the present Pope Paulus Quintus, doth demonstrate, and as I may say proclayme the euidence thereof. And therefore I must needes imagine that M. Andrews hath some other meaning then his wordes import; but whatsoeuer it is, he sheweth by his obscure, doubtfull and impertinent manner of wryting,
                  See cap. 4 nu. 23. that he hath caput morbidum, and verticem malè sanum, as you heard him say of S. Peter in the last Chapter.
            16. And this might suffice for answere to his glose vpon the place of S. Maximus,
               
                  S. Maximꝰ of Turyn did wryte homilyes or Sermōs of Saints. but that I cannot omit to say something to the two doubts he maketh, to wit, whether this Maximꝰ was he that was Bishop of Turin, &amp; whether there were Sermōs made purposely of the Apostles in his tyme; both which doubts the ancient Gennadiꝰ (who wrote in the same age) may wel resolue, seeing that in his booke de viris illustribus,
               
                  Genadius in Catal. Illustrium viror.
                he writeth that Maximus Bishop of Turin wrote certayne Tracts in prayse of the Apostles (which are these verie Homilies whence this testimony is taken) &amp; hauing mentioned diuers other Tracts and Homilies vpon the Natiuitie of S. Iohn Baptist, S. Eusebius of Versels, and S. Cypri
                     •
                  n, also of the passion of Christ, and the fast of Lent, of the Crosse, Sepulcher, and Resurection of our Lord (which are also to be seene in his works vnder the tytle of homylies, he concludeth: Scripsit etiam homilias multas
               
&amp;c. He (to wit Maximus) wrote also many Homilyes of the Natiuity of the Theophany (which we call the Epiphany) of Easter, and of Pentecost &amp;c. besides diuers others which I haue read, and do not remember. So he.
            17. Wherein it is to be noted for the resolution of M. Andrews his doubts, that S. Maximus who was Bishop of Turin, wrote homilyes in prayse, not only of the Apostles, but also of diuers other Saints, and vpon diuers feasts; which M. Andrews may belieue because it is testified by one that might know it well, for that he wrote about the yeare of our Lord 490. which was the same age wherein S. Maximus liued, who died (as Gennadius also witnesseth) in the yeare 420. about ten yeares before the decease of S. Augustin,
               
                  Gennadius vbi supra.
                which I note by the way to put M. Andrews in mynd of a notable scape &amp; ouersight (not to call it a flatly) in his former answere to a place of S. Augustine (wherof I treated in the last Chapter) where you may remember he affirmed very confidently,
                  See before chap. 4. nu. 21. that, tempore Augustini non fiebant Sermones de tempore:
               M. Andrews hath not giuen any probable answere to any one of ten places obiected by the Cardinall. In S. Augustins tyme there were no sermons made de Tempore. So that you see he is found to be minus habens, and taken tardy in euery thing, and not able to giue any reasonable satisfaction, or answere to any one place of ten alleadged by the Cardinall in one Chapter.
            18. And yet forsooth in the preamble to his answere of those places, he maketh so light of them as though he could blow them away all with a blast; for thus he saith: Vnum hoc peccant omnia &amp;c. they haue all this one fault,
               
                  Andr. vbi supra pag. 217. §. Inspiciamus.
                
               that they bring nothing which may not straight be graunted, except perhaps some litle word, about the which I do not meane 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , to contend in words. So he. But

if this be true, how chanceth it that the poore man hath bene so puzled in the answere of these places that he hath bene faine so to trifle, wrangle, cogg, and lye, as you haue heard? Hath some litle word, trow you, that hath occurred now and then, and could not be graunted, driuen him to so hard an exigent? But let vs hear what he saith may be graunted, and what denied in those places: Nam nec primatum (saith he) negamus Petri &amp;c. For we do not deny the Primacy of Peter, nor the names which do signify it, but we demand the thing or matter it selfe now in question, that is to say, his earthly Monarchy. Thus saith he, seeming out of his bountifull liberality, to graunt that which he seeketh to ouerthrow, as much as in him lyeth, yea denying that in effect which he graunteth in words,M. Andrews his 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . and reducing all his dispute to a playne 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , that is to say, a wordwarre, or a contention about words, which neuertheles he professeth to auoyd.
            19. You see he graunteth the primacy of Peter, yet when it is vrged against him out of the Fathers in the places aboue mentioned, he laboureth to ouerthrow the ground from whence they deduce it. For whereas they teach, that Peter had the primacy because he was the foundation of the Church, and had a speciall Commission giuen him to feede Christs sheepe, he goeth about to proue that Peter was no more the foundation of the Church, then the rest of the Apostles, nor otherwise Pastor thereof then they: whereupon it must needs follow, that he was not their primate, nor had any more gouernement ouer the Church then they. Wherein then consisteth his primacy which the Fathers teach, and deduce from the power giuen him by the keyes, and by his Pastorall commission, which doe import authority,

power, Iurisdiction, and gouernment?
            20. Therefore M. Andrews denying S. Peters preeminēce in authority and gouernment, denyeth the primacy, that the Fathers teach, and reduceth it only to a bare name, without effect, and so doth nothing els indeed but 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               ; yea and if we well consider what he saith we shall find that he graunteth not so much as the very word or name of primacy, or at least if he do he cōtradicteth himselfe; for what are, trow you, those voculae which he excepteth frō his graunt, when he sayth, that there is nothing in these places of the Fathers, which may not presently be graunted, nisi voculam fortè habent &amp;c. except some litle word perhaps?M. Andrewes troubled greatly with litle wordes. What litle word I say is that which cannot be graunted? Is it not Primatus, Caput, and some such other words as signifie Primacy? Yes truely; for no other voculae, or voces in those places of the Fathers do so much molest him. Neuertheles he hath no sooner excepted them from his grant, but he granteth thē presētly, saying: Non negamus Primatum Petri &amp;c. Wee doe not deny the primacy of Peter, nor those names which signify Primacy, which is a strange kinde of 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , for he wrangleth with himselfe, contradicting himselfe notably within the space of two lynes, first signifying that those wordes and names are not to be graunted, and presently after granting them, as no way preiudiciall to his doctrine.
            21. And to the end wee may vnderstand that he granteth vs nothing but words and names, he distinguisheth the same from the thing it selfe which he meaneth to deny, and yet so handleth the matter that he doth still 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , reducing also his denyall to a meer quarrell of words deuised by himselfe, and neyther vsed nor meant by vs, eyther in wordes or sense:

for he calleth rem ipsam,
               M. Andrewes fighteth in the aire and peruerteth the state of the Question. 
               the thing it selfe (which is signified by our primacy) terrestrem monarchiam, an earthly Monarchy: and in another place he also tearmeth it 
                  See cap. 1. nu. 20. 
               temporalem Primatum, a temporall Primacie; and this forsooth is that which he denyeth heere, and so denyeth no part of our doctrine, but a foolish cōceipt of his owne; for although we hold and teach that the gouernment of the Church is a Monarchie, and that the power thereof doth extend it selfe to temporall thinges (in such sort and for such reasons as I haue touched in the first 
                  nu. 20. &amp; 21. chapter of this Adioynder, and handled at large in my 
                  See Supplem. chap. 1. nu. 61. &amp; seq. vs
                     
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      ad 69. Supplemēt) yet it neyther is nor can be called temporall or earthly, otherwise then as S. Hilary calleth S. Peters iudiciall sentences terrena iudicia, when he sayth, terrena eius iudicia sunt caelestia, his earthly Iudgements (that is to say,
                  S. Hilar. l. 6. de Trinit.
                his sentences giuen on earth) are heauenly.
            22. And so I say, that albeit the gouernment of the Church may in this sense be called earthly, to wit, because it is exercised vpon earth, yet it is not earthly or temporall, but spirituall and heauenly, both because it is a spirituall and heauenly power, and also because it is guided and directed from heauen by the spirit of God. And therefore whereas M. Andrews doth call or rather nickname the Popes Supremacy, a Temporall Primacy, and his Monarchy an earthly Monarchy, because he punisheth his spirituall subiects in their temporall goodes, or states, he may by the same reason say, that S. Peter and S. Pauls power was not spirituall, but corporall and temporall, because the one of them punished Ananias &amp; Sapphira with corporall death, and the other strook Elimas the Magician blind,
                  Act. 5. Ibid. ca. 13. deliuered the incestuous Corinthian to Sathan in interitum carnis,
               1. Cor. 5. to

the destruction of the flesh, and finally extended his power to secular and politicall matters, commaunding 
                  Ibid. ca. 6. the Corinthians to appoint temporall Iudges amongst themselues rather then to haue recourse to the tribunalls and Iudgements of Infidells:M. Andrews a pecuniary Pastour &amp; a wrangler in the highest degree. yea M. Andrewes must acknowledge himselfe to be but a meere temporall, yea a pecuniary Pastour, because in his spirituall Courtes he vseth pecuniary mulcts, and other temporall punishments, as I haue shewed before, in the first 
                  See before chap. 1. nu. 21. Chapter. By all this it appeareth that M. Andrews denying not the spirituall, but (as he tearmeth it) the earthly Monarchy, and temporall primacy of Peter, denyeth nothing els but his owne vayne and idle manner of speach, expressing only a foolish fancie of his, and a very Chymera that hath no being in rerum natura, and so he doth still 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , and is therefore truely 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , that is to say a wrangler, in the highest degree.
            23. And to the end this may yet appeare more manifestly, I will examine his answers &amp; obiections touching another point in controuersy betwixt him, and vs, whereby we shall also see how notably he wrangleth, cauilleth, iuggleth, and tryfleth; and because the matter, and his manner of answering will requyre some long discourse, I will make it the subiect of the three next Chapters.
         
         
            
            A FVRTHER MANIFESTATION OF MAISTER ANDREWS HIS Tryfling, wrangling, and fraudulent humour, by his Answers to other places of the Fathers, concerning Prayer to Saints, which he deuydeth into three rankes, whereof the two first are examined in this Chapter.
            CHAP. VI.
            
               WHEREAS the Cardinall vndertaketh in his Apology
                  Card. Apol. cap. 1. pag. 12. to treate of prayer to Saynts (because the Apology for the Oath condemneth the vse,M. Andrews his meer trifling cauill. and practise of it in the Catholike Church) M. Andrewes taketh exception to the Cardinall for changing the state of

the question,
                  Andr. cap. 1. p. 35. §. Porrò.
                and sayth that he fighteth with his owne shaddow, because he promiseth to treate de intercessione Sanctorum of the intercession of Saynts, wheras that which the King condemneth (saith M. Andrewes) is the inuocation of Saynts: wherin he also noteth this difference, that the intercession of Saynts is their worke, and the inuocation of them is ours, and that the King denieth not that which the Cardinall proueth, to wit, that the Saynts do pray for vs, but that they are to be inuocated, or prayed vnto, which (saith M. Andrews) the Cardinall proueth not.
            
            2. And he pleaseth himselfe so much with this deuise, that he doth often inculcate the same, vrging the Cardinall to proue that Saynts may be inuocated, yea producing a text of Scripture, to proue that none can be inuocated but God;
                  Andr. pa. 37. §. Verū.
                for 
                  terret nos Apostolus, saith he, vtcumque vos hominem habetis pro leui &amp;c. The Apostle doth terrify vs (how light soeuer you make of the man) when he asketh this question,
                     Rom. 10. 
                  quomodo inuocabunt eum, in quem non crediderunt? how shall they inuocate him in whome they belieue not?An ignorant collection.
for you perhaps haue found a way how a man may inuocate those in whome you your selues say you do not belieue, whereas he (to wit the Apostle) seemed then to haue found no way.
Thus saith M. Andrews: wherein it is to be noted, that one speciall reason why he rejecteth our doctrine concerning prayer to Saynts, is, for that we do inuocate them; because in his conceipt, Inuocation is so proper to God alone, that none can be inuocated but he; and if he do not conceiue so, why doth he insist so much vpon the word inuocate, yea, and seeke to terrify vs with his terret nōs Apostolus, charging vs to make light of him, because we inuocate them in whome

we belieue not, that is to say, those whome we do not hold for God.
            3. But a man may wonder how this great Doctor could so grossely erre in a matter so euident as this, seeing that the words of the Apostle immediatly going before, do manifestly shew, that he speaketh there of an inuocation due to God alone, as to our chiefe Lord; which kind of inuocation is not communicable to creatures; and therefore the Apostle hauing sayd, that God is Dominus omnium &amp;c. the Lord of all, and rich, or bountifull;
                  Rom. 10. 
               towards all that inuocate him, he confirmeth it with the saying of the Prophet, omnis qui inuocauerit nomen Domini saluus erit,
               
                  Ioel. 2. euery one that shall inuocate the name of our Lord shalbe saued, and then he addeth,The true meaning of S. Paul about the inuocatiō of him in whome we belieue. 
               Quomodo inuocabunt eum in quem non crediderunt? How shall they inuocate him, in whome they haue not belieued? as who would say, how can they inuocate him, of whome the Prophet speaketh, him that is Dominus omnium, the Lord of all, except they belieue in him, that is to say, except they belieue him to be their Lord, and Creatour. Whereby he doth not signify that none but God can be inuocated in any sort, but that we cannot inuocate God, as our Lord, and our God, except we belieue him so to be.
            4. And this doth not contradict the Inuocation of Saynts in another respect, to wit (not as Gods) but as the seruants of God, whome he glorifyeth, and honoreth, and by whose intercession, and mediation he bestoweth graces, and fauours vpon men: in which sense it may also be truly said, that we cannot inuocate them, or craue the helpe of their prayers, except we do in some sort belieue in them (I meane) so far forth as we inuocate them, that is to, say except we belieue

them to be Gods seruants, and that we also haue confidence in them, as in those, who by Gods goodnes may helpe vs. So as a faith, and beliefe in Saynts, is also necessary for the inuocation of them, though it is not the faith that we haue in God, as in our chiefe Lord, and Creatour; and that we may haue faith in Saynts, M. Andrewes may learne in the Apostle himselfe, who commendeth the charity,
                  Ep. ad Philem.
                and faith which Philemon had in Domino Iesu, &amp; in omnes Sanctos, in our Lord Iesus, and in all Saynts; vpon which words S. Hierome in his Commentary vpon that Epistle discourseth amply,
                  S. Hieron. To. 6. in ep. ad Philem.
                prouing that we may be sayd to haue fayth in Saynts.
            5. Therefore M. Andrewes is to vnderstand for the full answere of his obiection, that as there is an honour, and glory which is due to God only (as the Apostle witnesseth,1. Tim. 1. saying, soli Deo honor, &amp; gloria, honour, and glory be to God alone) and another due to creatures (whereof the same Apostle also sayth,
                  Rom. 2. 
               gloria, honor, &amp; pax omni operanti bonum; glory, honour, and peace be to euery one that doth good) so also there are two sorts of inuocation, the one vsed to God alone (whereof the Apostle speaketh in the text alledged by M. Andrewes) and the other vsed not only to Angels, and Saynts,
                  Gen. 48. but also to men, as we read in the holy Scriptures, where Iacob blessing the children of Ioseph saith,
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . 
               inuocetur nomen meum super pueros hos, &amp; nomina Patrum meorum: let my name, and the names of my Fathers Abraham, and Isaac be inuocated vpon those children. Vpon which words S. Augustine noteth expressely that not only exaudition,
               S. Aug. li. locution. in Gen. nu. 200. but also inuocation is sometymes applyed to men, and not to God alone; besides that, I will make it euident heereafter, that

the ancient fathers do vse inuocation, for prayer to Saynts.
            6. But if M. Andrewes will not belieue S. Augustine, and the other ancient fathers, nor yet the holy Scripture, let him belieue himselfe, who afterwards teacheth clearely inough, that the word inuocation may be applyed to creatures, for he saith, that poscere à Sanctis auxilium,
               
                  Andr. p. 45. §. Locus autem.
                
               propriè inuocare est, to craue helpe of Saynts, is properly to inuocate them, so that according to this interpretation of his, we do properly inuocate all those of whome we craue help,M. Andrews cō
                  tradicteth himselfe. and succour, which we lawfully craue, not only of God, but also of those, who by the ordinance of God, may, and do lawfully succour, and helpe vs, as Angels, Saynts, and men do; whereupon it followeth that we may lawfully demaund their helpe, and consequently inuocate them according to M. Andrews his owne interpretation, whereby it appeareth that he hath not only very idly laboured to fright vs with his terrible text taken out of the Apostle, but also fondly contradicted himselfe.
            7. No lesse vayne, and idle is the exceptiō which he taketh against the Cardinall,Cardinall Bellarmine vnder the name of Intercession of Saints comprizeth as well our prayers to them as their praiers for vs. for vndertaking to proue the intercession of Saynts, insteed of the inuocation of Saynts: for how can M. Andrewes be ignorant that the Cardinall meaneth to proue the Catholike doctrine concerning prayer to Saynts, or the inuocatiō
                of Saints, albeit he tearme it the intercession of Saints? For whereas there are in this question two poynts specially controuersed, the one, whether we may pray to Saynts, and the other, whether they doe pray for vs, (which two haue a connexion, and dependance one of another) it sufficeth that the Cardinall named one

of them, meaning vnder the tytle thereof to proue the Catholyke doctrine concerning them both, as indeed he doth by the places of the Fathers which he alledgeth; prouing by some of them that the Saynts pray for vs, succour, and helpe vs, and by others that we may pray to them, yea and that we doe receiue helpe, and succour by them; wherby the Cardinall doth sufficiently discharge his promise, yea and proueth that which M. Andrewes exacteth of him, to wit, the inuocation of Saynts, so that M. Andrewes sheweth himselfe still to be 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , a notable wrangler, contending about woords, when neuertheles he vnderstandeth cleerly the Cardinalls sense, and meaning therein.
            8. And now to shew that the Cardinall euidētly proueth the inuocation of Saynts, I will examin M. Andrews his answeres to the places alledged by the Cardinall out of the Fathers, wherby also his cauilling, wrangling &amp; fraudulēt humour shall euidently appeare. He deuideth the Fathers (which the Cardinall produceth) into 3. rankes.
                  Andr. pa. 39. §. Patrum.
                The first (sayth he) is of those, qui verè Patres, sed non verè citantur, are truly Fathers, but not truly cyted. The second, of those, qui verè citantur, sed fidei suspectae, which are truly cyted, but of no sound credit. And the third,M. Andrews his triple diuision not worth three chipps. of those, qui &amp; veri, &amp; verè citantur, sed nihil ad rem, which are both true Fathers, and truly cyted, but nothyng to the purpose. Thus sayth M. Andrewes. In the first ranke he placeth S. Basil, out of whose Oration vpon the Fourty Martyrs the Cardinall alledgeth these words: Qui aliqua premitur angustia &amp;c. whosoeuer is pressed (or vexed) with any griefe,
               S. Basil. ho. in 40. Martyres.
                
               let him haue recourse to these, and he that is ioyfull, or merry, let him pray to these: the one, that he may be deliuered from his griefe, and the other, that he may be conserued in his

mirth. Thus far the Cardinall alledgeth S. Basil in that place.
            9. Whereto M. Andrews giueth two answers.M. Andrews wrangleth when he he cannot answere. In the first he saith, that it is one thing to declare what is done, and another to determine what ought to be done. In the other he taketh exception to the translation of the place out of the Greeke, which later point I thinke good to examine first, because the other will be afterwards the more easily discussed. Now then M. Andrews would make the world belieue, that the Cardinall had vsed great fraud, and corruption in cyting S. Basils words, and that he hath falsifyed the Greeke text; whereas he knoweth well that the Cardinall alledgeth truly the Latin translation, which also though it do not render the Greeke, word for word, yet giueth the true sense, and meaning thereof. The corruption which M. Andrews imputeth to the Cardinall consisteth in these words, hos oret, let him pray to these, which (saith M. Andrews) is not so in the Greeke, eyther for the words, or sense. The words in the Greeke he saith, are 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , that is to say, he runneth to these, wherein he also noteth, that the manner of speach is different, as that there is not in the Greeke any precept, or commandment to pray, or runne, but only a declaration of a fact, to wit, that men did then vse to haue recourse, and runne to the Martyrs: besides that, he maketh (hos) these Martyrs, to signfy the place where their memories, or monuments were.
            10. And therefore he expoundeth,
                  Andr. pag. 40. §. Non verè.
                
               ad hos currit, id est, saith he, ad eorum memorias &amp;c. that is to say, to their memoryes, where he may pray vnto God, who by miracles then done there shewed, that he did heare the prayers

of his suppliants. So he, and then addeth further thus
                  •
                
               And that there should be no doubt hereof he (to wit) Basil addeth presently 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   &amp;c. the deuout woman maketh her prayers in this place, and therefore he speaketh of the place: and then to take away all scruple he saith a litle after, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   (and not) 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , not let him pray to them, nor let our prayers be made to them) but with them. Thus saith M. Andrews confounding, as you see, hos, with hic, the Martyrs with the place where they were honoured, and seeking to destroy ad hos, to these, by cum hijs with these, absurdly impugning one truth by another, as though these could not all stand togeather; whereas S. Basil toucheth all those three things seuerally, passing from one to another.
            11. And to the end that this may be euident, I craue thy patience, good Reader, whyles I lay downe vnto thee the whole substance of S. Basils discourse touching these 3 points.The substance of S. Basils discourse about praying vnto Saints. First then he speaketh of the Martyrs themselues, saying, hi sunt qui nostram regionē administrant &amp;c. these are they which gouerne our Country, and like Towers, or fortresses vnited togeather, do giue vs security against our enemies: and then speaking not only of them, but also of dyuers places where they were honoured, and serued in their reliques, he addeth nec in vno loco se clauserunt, sed in multis locis hospitio excepti, multorum, Patrias ornauerunt: they haue not shut themselues vp in one place, but being receiued as guests in many places, they haue adorned the countryes of many men. Afterwards he speaketh both of the particuler Temple, and Church in Caesarea dedicated to those Martyrs (where it seemeth he made his Oration, or sermon) and also of the Martyrs themselues. Beneficium,
               
sayth he, fratres dilectissimi &amp;c.; most louing Brethren we haue this benefit, and perpetuall fauour of Almighty God, heere is a ready helpe for Christians, to wit, a Church of Martyrs, an army of the triumphant, a quyre of those that prayse God. So he.
            12. Then he cōtinueth his speach of the Martyrs, signifying that whereas they were wont to vse greate diligence to fynd out some one intercessor for them, Quadraginta, sayth he, sunt hi &amp;c. These Martyrs are fourty praying altogeather, for seeing God is where one or two are gathered in his name, who can doubt that God is present where there are fourty? He that is afflicted which any griefe, hath refuge, or recourse to these, and he which is ioyfull, or merry doth runne to these &amp;c. Thus sayth S. Basil speaking sometymes, as you see, of the Martyrs themselues, and sometymes of the place where their reliques were reserued, &amp; they honoured in their reliques.
            13. And therefore he passeth also now from them agayne to speake of the place, and to shew withall the notable effects, and the temporall benefits which the people might expect by their recourse to the Martyrs, saying: Hic, mulier pia orans pro filijs auditur &amp;c. Heere, the deuout woman praying for her children is heard, and craueth a safe returne for her husband, when he is in his iourney, and health for him when he is sick. And then he concludeth concerning the Martyrs themselues, cum his ergo Martyribus nostrae fiant preces, therefore let vs pray with these Martyrs; in all which you see he exhorteth the people not only to haue recourse to these Martyrs in their necessities, but also finally to pray with them, because our prayers to Saynts doe litle auayle vs, except we also pray to God for our

selues; &amp; then are our prayers much more potent, and acceptable to God, when they concurre with the prayers of his Saynts, and seruants, and are fortifyed, and strengthened by them.
            
               M. Andrews very grosse and foolish.14. Now then, I remit it heere to the iudgment of any indifferēt Reader, whether M. Andrews hath any reason in the world to cōfound hos, with hic, &amp; to destroy ad hos, cum his, seeing that euery one of these hath a cleare, and different sense according to the different nature, and property of the words. Besids, that M. Andrewes is totoo grosse, and foolish in making ad hos, to signify in hoc loco, seeing that presently after he himselfe maketh cum his, to signify, with these Martyrs. For if cum his, or cum illis, with these, or with them, do signify the Martyrs themselues, what reason had he to make ad 
                     •
                  os, a litle before to signify the place, especially seeing that hi, is clearely referred to the Martyrs themselues, throughout the whole context, as you haue euidently seene?
            15. But will you heare him yet further confute his owne glosse,M. Andrews cō
                  futeth himselfe. and see him tript, as I may say, in his owne play? You shall therefore vnderstand that the Cardinall hauing alledged that part of S. Basils discourse which you haue heard to proue prayers to Saynts, addeth those other words which I haue also by occasion layd downe a litle before, to wit, Hi sunt qui nostram regionem administrant &amp;c. these are they who gou
                     •
                  rne our Country, and lyke towers, or fortresses giue vs security against the incursion of enemies &amp;c. which words the Cardinall cyteth to proue the veneration of holy reliques;
                  Card. Apol. pag. 13. and M. Andrewes comming to treate of that matter, and to answere that place, not past 3. lea
                  •
               es after his answere to the former, flatly ouerthroweth

his owne exposition,
                  Andr. p. 47. §. Pari autem.
                which you haue heard, saying thus: 
                  locum Basilij a
                        ••
                     ert &amp;c. The Cardinall bringeth a place of Basil, whereof it shall suffice to admonish you in one word. The Reader shall not find there any reliques of Martyrs, but the Martyrs themselues, hij sunt inquit &amp;c. he sayth these are the words hij, cannot be referred to reliques; for the Gender doth not suffer it, eyther in the Latin, where it were to be sayd hae, or in the Greeke, where it were to be sayd haec, so that it cannot be referred to 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , which is of the neuter gender.
So he.
            16. If this then be true, why doth he in the former place make hos, those, to signify memorias Martyrum, the memoryes, or monuments of Martyrs? Doth the Gender, trow you, suffer it, eyther in the Latin, or in the Greeke? Can he make hij, or hos, which are masculine, agree with memorias of the feminine, or with monumenta of the neuter Gender? or with 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , and 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                or 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                in the Greeke, whereof the first is feminine, and the other two neuters? Truly he must eyther make a new Grammar to mayntayne his construction in the former place, or els retract his exposition, and argument in the later,
                  See Apol. Card. p. 13. so that you see, how true it is, which the Latin Prouerb saith, oportet mendacem esse memorem, it behooueth a lyar to haue a good memory.Another cauill of M. Andrews against Cardinall Bellarmine.
            
            17. But if M. Andrewes will say, that he may as well take hos Martyres, for memorias Martyrum in the former place, as Cardinall Bellarmine taketh hij Martyres, for reliquias Martyrum in the later (for so indeed doth M. Andrews affirme of the Cardinall) I must tell him,

                that it is but an idle conceit of his owne, that the Cardinall so taketh hi Martyres in that place, or any

where els, for although he cyteth those words of S. Basil for the veneration of reliques, yet the intercession of Saynts is also clearely proued thereby, and therfore the Cardinall doth not confound the one with the other, but proueth the one by the other, to wit, the necessary vse, and veneration of holy reliques, by the help, and protection which we receiue from Saynts, to which purpose he alledgeth the place of S. Basil, shewing thereby that the fourty Martyrs being honored in their reliques throughout all that Country did protect, and defend the same, veluti quaedam Turres like certayne Towers, and fortresses.
            18. And therefore, as S. Basil saith of them, and not of their reliques, hij sunt &amp;c. these are they which gouerne our Country, so the Cardinall also vnderstandeth the words hij sunt, to signify the Martyrs themselues, and not their reliques, though he alledge it, and that worthily, to proue that the practise of the Catholike Church in the reuerent reseruation, and veneration of reliques, is not only lawfull, but also very commendable, and profitable: whereby it appeareth that M. Andrews cauilleth euidently and very idly, when he maketh the Cardinall to take hij Martyres, for reliquias Martyrum, and much more, when he argueth so substantially, as you haue heard, vpon the difference of the Genders, in the Greeke, and Latin, seriously impugning his owne vayne conceit, and vsing still that

                and 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                wherewith he falsely chargeth the Cardinall.
            19. And now to say a word or two concerning the difference betwyxt the Latin,The latin translatiō of S Basil defended. and the Greeke (by reason whereof M. Andrewes chargeth the Cardinall to haue corrupted the Greeke, text) I am sure M. Andrewes
               
is not ignorant (as I haue sayd before) that the Cardinall hath layd downe sincerely the words of the Latin translation, who therefore could not iustly be charged with falsity, though the translatour had cō
               mitted any errour, as he hath not for the sense, albeit there is differēce in the words. For although 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                doth in deede, signify currere to runne, and not orare, to pray; yet for as much as the ordinary meanes, and manner of running, or hauing recourse to Martyrs, both is, and was in S. Basils tyme by prayer vnto them, yea and that S. Basil doth in this oration sufficiently exhort, and perswade his auditors thereto, first vsing an argument à fortiore (to wit, that seeing they were wont to take great paynes to find out some one intercessor for them, they had much more reason to haue recourse to these fourty) and afterwards signifying not only the custome of the afflicted to recurre to them, but also the comfortable effects and helps which they receiued thereby, to which purpose he sayth, hic pia mulier orans profilijs auditur &amp;c
                  •
                here the deuout woman is heard praying for her children &amp;c. therefore I say all this being considered the Latin translatour (whose text the Cardinal cyteth) doubted not to translate 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , hos oret, expressing also the indicatiue moode in the Greeke, by an imparatiue in the Latin, because S. Basils discourse sufficiently includeth an exhortation, and perswasion, as I haue signifyed before.
            20. And because M. Andrewes may perhaps desire some further proofe that it was the custome in S Basils tyme to pray to Martyrs,A plaine place out of S. Basil for the inuocation of Martyrs. yea to inuocate them (for without that word there is no bargayne with M. Andrewes) let vs heare what S. Basil himselfe

sayth of another holy Martyr, to wit S. Mammas,
               
                  S. Basil. orat. in S. Mammantem.
                vpon whome he made also another oration, and sayth as followeth: 
                  memores estote Martyris, quotquot &amp;c. Be yee myndfull of the Martyr, as many of you as haue enioyed him in your sleepe (he meaneth by some vision, or apparition) as many as haue euen in this place had his help,
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . to pray for you, or whome soeuer nomine aduocatus, he being called vpon by name, hath assisted in his actions, or workes, as many as he hath reduced to the right way when they went astray, as many as haue recouered their healths by him, to whomesoeuer he hath restored their children, reuyuing them when they were dead; and finally as many of you, as haue had your liues prolonged by him
                     •
                   gather all these together, and contribute the same, as it were a common shot, to the prayse of the Martyr &amp;c.
            
            21. Thus sayth S. Basil, which I haue the more largely layd downe, to the end thou mayst see good Reader, not only what benefits the deuout Christians in S. Basils tyme receiued by the intercession, &amp; prayer of Martyrs, but also that this holy Martyr of whome he treateth did sometyme appeare to men by visions in their sleep, and that men vsed to inuocate him in their necessityes, and thereby had his assistance, which is euident euen in the Greeke text, where we read 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , that is to say, whomsoeuer he (to wit the Martyr) hath assisted in his works, being called vpon by name: which words I hope M. Andrewes cannot deny to expresse a playne inuocation of the Martyr, and the good effect (I meane the helpe, and assistance) that followed thereof.
            22. Besyds that it is also to be considered heere, that S. Basil doth speak not only of assistance giuen by

the holy Martyr in the place where his reliques were kept (as when he sayth, quotquot in hoc loco cōstituti &amp;c. as many of you as heere in this place haue had his help in your prayers) but also of great fauours done by him in other places, as namely to wandring men that had lost their way &amp;c. And therefore I would gladly know heere of M. Andrews in what manner these wandring men, or others that were absent from the monument, and reliques of the Martyr,M. Andrewes very hardly posed. obtayned those fauours mentioned by S. Basil, yea, and how they knew that the Martyr had fauoured, and helped them, if they had not first inuocated him, and prayed particulerly vnto him; for M. Andrews cannot say in this case, as he sayd in the former, that because God did shew by miracles at the Monuments of the Martyrs, that he heard mens prayers there, therefore men had &amp; might haue recourse thither to pray to God for help, but not to the Martyr himselfe; this deuyse I say cannot serue his turne.
            23. For how did the way-faring man (who was far from the Monument of the Martyr, and had lost his way) know that he was brought into it againe by the help of the Martyr, but because he had reposed speciall confidence in him, yea, and recommended himselfe particulerly to his prayers, and assistance? In which respect S. Basil hauing vsed that generall speach:Diuers miraculous effects of the Inuocation of Martyrs specifyed by S. Basil 
               quibuscumque ex nomine vocatus adfuit &amp;c. to whomesoeuer the Martyr had giuen assistance being called vpon by name, doth particularize the fauours that many had receiued by the inuocation of him, saying that some had byn reduced to their right way, others restored to their health, others had recouered their dead children, and others agayne obtayned prolongation

of lyfe, all which, no doubt, were things well knowne to S. Basils auditors, to haue happened in that manner to some or other amongst them, for otherwyse he would not haue affirmed the same vnto them so confidently as he did.
            24. This then being so, it is euident by the testimony of S. Basil himselfe, that the custome, and practise of faithfull, and Catholyke people in his tyme, was to inuocate holy Martyrs, and Saynts by name, and that God did approue the same by many miracles: whereupon it followeth, that the recourse which S. Basil sayth was ordinary to the fourty Martyrs, included the inuocation of them according to the cōmon custome of that tyme,the Latin translatiō of S. Basil defended in which respect I also inferre, that the translatour expounding 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , by orare, did expresse S. Basils sense, and meaning, though not the nature of the Greeke word: and finally I conclude, that the place of S. Basil alledged by the Cardinall proueth directly not only the intercession of Saynts for vs, which M. Andrewes graunteth but also our intercession, and prayers to them, notwithstanding the glosse of M. Andrewes confounding the Martyrs with their Monuments; which how impertinent, and friuolous it is, you haue sufficiently seene, as well by an argument of his owne, as by the rest of this discourse.
            
               
                  Andr. p. 40. §. Non verè
               25. And now to say somewhat of his other answere which I mentioned in the beginning, he sayth, Aliud est narrare quid fiat, aliud statuere quid faciendum sit: it is one thing to declare what is done,Another answere of M. Andrewes refuted. and another thing to declare what should be done, giuing to vnderstand that albeit S. Basil in the place alledged by the Cardinall, declared that men vsed in his tyme to pray

to Saynts, yet the same doth not suffice to proue it to be lawfull,
                  M. Andr. vrging stil to haue some decrees of the Fathers concerning prayers to Saynts flieth frō the authority of the Fathers to Coūcells. except it be approued by some decree of S. Basil, and the other Fathers of that tyme; to which purpose he doth often inculcate the same, demanding still some statute, or decree of the Fathers, as I shall haue occasion to shew further heereafter. But heere I would be glad to know, what kind of statute, and decree he would haue in this question, for if he exact some decree of the Fathers assembled in a Generall, or Prouinciall Councell, he flyeth, as I may say, out of the lists, to another manner of tryall then the Cardinal offereth in this place, and then he himselfe seemeth to accept. Besydes that he must expect such decrees from the To
                  •
               es of the Coūcells, where they are particulerly related, and not from the workes of the Fathers, who are not wont to set them downe, but vpon particuler occasions now and then occurring.
            26. To which purpose it is also to be vnderstood, that there were neuer any Councells assembled, or Synodicall statutes made concerning faith,Why Councell
                     •
                   are assembled. but by reason of matters controuersed with publike trouble, scandall, and danger to the Church; as the 4. first Generall Councells were called by reason of the heresyes of the Arians, M
                     •
                  cedonians, Nestorians, and Eutychians, which at those dayes did exceedingly molest and scandalize all the East Church;Why the Inuocatiō of Saynts was not confirmed by some Synodicall decree in the primitiue Church. whereas the inuocation of Saynts-being then publikely, and generally practised throughout the whole Church needed not to be confirmed by decrees of Synods, especially seeing it was not expressely denyed by any at that tyme. For albeit an abominable Arian heretike called Eustathius did then impugne the publyke honour done to Saynts, by dedicating Churches to them, and celebrating

their feasts (for which cause a Prouinciall Councell was held at Gangra,
               
                  Concil. Gangren. in proamio &amp; ca. 20. where this his heresy, togeather with diuers others of his was condemned, and all those anathematized who did contemne the Temples, and Monuments of Martyrs, and the assemblyes, and sacred oblations which were made there:) yet because this heretike did not directly impugne the inuocation of Saynts, the same was not directly, and expressely confirmed, or mentioned in this Canon.
            27. And although about this tyme also (I meane in the 4. age) Vigilantius denyed,S. Hieron. aduer. Vigilant.
                
               that Saynts pray for vs (whereupon it may indeed be inferred that he consequently held the Inuocation of them to be superfluous) yet for as much as he liued but only in a corner of France,
               The heresy of Vigilantius denying the Saints pray for vs, quikly repressed by S. Hierome. and was presently confuted and repressed by S. Hierome, in such sort, that the Church was no further troubled with his errour, therefore there needed no Councells to be assembled, or Synodicall decrees to be made for the condemnation thereof, and much lesse for the confirmation of prayer to Saynts, which he did not expressely deny. So as M. Andrews sheweth himselfe very impertinent still to demaund statutes, and decrees for the inuocation of Saynts within the first 400. yeares, at what tyme it was (as I haue sayd) so publike, and generall throughout the whole Church, that it was needles to confirme it by Canons, or decrees, as it will still further appeare, the further we debate this matter.
            28. In the meane tyme to returne to S. Basil, and to conclude concerning him,The conclusion cō
                  cerning the place of S. Basil. I appeale to the iudgment of any indifferent man, whether he could declare eyther his owne beliefe, or the faith of the Church touching this point, more clearely then he hath done

heere, shewing the vse, and custome of Catholike people in his tyme, not only approued, and highly commended by him (as it is euident by that which I haue layd downe before) but also confirmed,
                  nu. 19. &amp; 20. and ratifyed by Almighty God with miraculous effects, and the grant of pious petitions made by deuout people to the holy Martyrs, and Saynts, at their Monuments, and els where. All which, I say, being witnessed by S. Basil, is truly a far greater testimony for vs, then if he should haue only declared his owne opinion. So as a man may wonder with what face M. Andrewes can admit the authority of the Fathers, and yet reiect their testimony of such facts as these, whereby they shew not only their owne beliefe, but also the beliefe, and practice of the Church in their dayes. And thus much concerning S. Basil.
            
            29. The next place which M. Andrewes vndertaketh to answere is taken out of Eusebius, and cyted by the Cardinall thus:
                  Apol. Card. p. 14
                     •
                   
                  Euseb. de praep. Euangel. lib. 13. c. 7. 
               Haec nos quotidie factitamus &amp;c. These things we (Christians) vse to do daily, who honoring the true Souldiars of piety as the friends of God, do also go to their tombes, and pray vnto them, by whose intercession to Almighty God, we do acknowledge, that we receiue great help.
               M. Andrews his cauill against the place cyted out of Eusebius. Thus far the Cardinall cyteth the words of Eusebius, according to the Latin translation, which he layeth downe sincerely; albeit M. Andrewes chargeth him with fraud in peruerting the Greeke text, because the words in the Greeke are somewhat otherwise, signifying that the custome of the Christians was to pray at the tombes of the Martyrs, and maketh no expresse mention of praying to them: whereto I answere as to the former charge, that the Latin translatour, whose words the Cardinall cyteth, followeth

the sense of Eus
                     •
                  bius, gathering the same out of the circumstance of the place. For Eusebius shewing there the conformity of Plato's doctrine to our Christian Religion, layeth downe Plato's words, wherein he sayth, that those which were vertuous, and valiant men, and dyed for the defence of their Country, became after their death, Semidei, halfe Godes, and deliuered men from many euils, and were serued, and worshipped as Gods, &amp; their monuments and tombes adored.
            30. Wherupon Eusebius to shew the lyke practice of Christiās, sayth that it was vsuall, &amp; ordinary amongst Christians to goe to the tombes of Martyrs, and there to pray, and to honour their blessed soules (for so hath the Greeke) which being considered, together with the doctrine of Plato before related, concerning the honour, and worship done to the Semidei, and the conformity thereof with Christian religion vrged by Eusebius, as also that the cōmon custome of Christians was at that tyme to pray to Martyrs by name (as I haue shewed a litle before,
                  See before nu. 20. &amp; infra nu. 
                  
                     ••

                  .57.60. &amp; seq. Item cap. 7. &amp; 8. per. totum.
                by the authority of S. Basil, and will shew further after a whyle:) All this, I say, being considered, the Translatour had reason to vnderstand, that the prayers which Eusebius sayth the Christians made at the tombes of Martyrs, were directed to them, and not to God only, especially seeing that all the prayers, honour, and seruice exhibited to Martyrs, eyther at theyr tombes, or els where, redoundeth to the honour, and seruice of God, to whome the same are finally directed, and addressed, and for whose sake principally, the holy Martyrs, and Saynts, are honored, and serued. Therefore seeing the Latin translatiō which the Cardinall cyteth is not only free from

errour in doctrine, but also conforme to the circumstances of the place, and to the practice of the Church at that tyme, it may well be admitted, though it be not altogeather litterall: but howsoeuer it is, the Cardinall following, and alledging it, as it is generally receiued amongst learned men, could not iustly be charged with fraud, though the same should be erroneous: whereas M. Andrews sheweth himselfe both fraudulent and malicious, in charging the Cardinal to peruert the Greeke text, when he cyteth the Latin translatiō with all sincerity. And thus much for this poynt.
            31. Furthermore M. Andrewes addeth to the two former places another out of S. Chrysostome,
               M. Andrews his exception against the testimony cited by Bellarmine out of S. Chrysostome. which the Cardinall cyteth thus: Saepius illos inuisamus, tumulos adoremus &amp;c. let vs often visit these Martyrs (to wit S. Iuuentinus, and S. Maximus) let vs adore their tombes, &amp; let vs with great faith touch their reliques, to the end we may obtayne some benediction thereby. Thus farre the Cardinall out of S. Chrysostome, to proue that the ancient Fathers of the first 400. yeares, and namely S. Chrysostome approued the veneration of holy reliques. Wherin M. Andrewes pretendeth to haue found two fraudes;
                  Andr. vbi supra. §. Sed neque.
                the one, in the translation of the Greeke, and the other in the allegation of the Latin. Of the former he sayth thus: Nam &amp; graecè &amp;c. For in the Greeke 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , is to touch the shryne; but to touch the shrine, I thinke, is not to adore it. Our Sauiour did not adore the sonne of the widdow of Naim, when he touched the coffin wherein his body lay. So he.
            32. Wherein I beseech thee good Reader, to note how substantially he answereth this place, saying nothing at all to the substance, and whole drift thereof,

but cauilling only about a word,M. Andrews sayth nothing to the whole substance of the place, but cauilleth only about some words. or two, as if all the wayght, and force of the place consisted therein, whereas the place would directly pro
                  •
               e all that which the Cardinall intendeth, though we should grant that which M. Andrewes affirmeth concerning the difference betwixt the Greeke, and the Latin. For seeing that S. Chrysostome exhorteth the people not only to visit the Martyrs by repayring to their tombes, but also to touch, yea, and with faith to imbrace their reliques (for so hath the 
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . Greeke) to the end to haue thereby some benediction, doth he not plainely teach therein that holy reliques are to be reuerently kept, visited, and worshipped?
            33. For how can it be imagined that a man can come to visit holy reliques, and with fayth touch, and imbrace them to the end heere declared (to wit, to receiue thereby some blessing from Almighty God) but that he doth it with deuotion, and an exteriour demonstration of the internall reuerence that he beareth therto, I meane with a reuerent, and religious veneration thereof expressed with his externall acts, and religious behauiour, which is nothing els, but that reuerence, and worship, which the Cardinall teacheth to be due to holy reliques; and therefore seeing that this is S. Chrysostomes expresse doctrine in this place, euen according to the Greeke text, and words layd downe, and vrged by M. Andrews himselfe, how impertinent is his cauill touching the differēce betwixt the Greeke, and the Latin? Doth he not therein shew himselfe to be a meere tryfler, cauiller, and wrangler? Which may appeare also further by his confirmation thereof,M. Andrews a meere wrangler. where he sayth that our Sauiour did not adore the sonne of the widdow of Naim, when he touched the

coffin.
            34. For to what purpose serueth this, but to bewray his owne peruerse, and wrangling humour? Will he argue thus: Christ touched not the coffin to adore the widdowes sonne, Ergo, reliques may not be touched with intention to worship them? How absurd were this consequence? As well might he say, that because Christ touched the coffin of the widdowes sonne with intent to stay it,M. Andrews hath foūd out a new Logik to inferre quidlibet ex quolibe
                        •
                     
                  
                therefore whosoeuer toucheth the tombe of a Martyr, eyther hath, or ought to haue the same intention; for the one may be inferred vpon Christs example as truly, and directly as the other. B
                  ••
                perhaps M. Andrews hath found out a new Logick to inferre quidlibet ex quolibet.
            
            35. The second exception which he taketh to the Cardinall for the citation of this place, is for the difference betwixt the Latin text, and the Cardinalls allegation, who hath tumulos adoremus, let vs adore their tombes, whereas the Latin translation (saith M. Andrews) hath tumulos adornemus, let vs adorne, or deck their tombes; and this he vrgeth for a great fraud; from the which the Cardinall may easily be freed. For albeit some impressions of S. Chrysostome haue tumulos adornemus, yet others (&amp; namely those which the Cardinall followed) haue tumulos adoremus. And to the end M. Andrewes may be satisfied in this poynt, I remit him to three impressions of S. Chrysostoms workes set forth at Venice, two of them in diuers yeares, and all 3. of dyuers stampes; the first in the yeare 1574. apud Iuntas: the second in the same yeare apud haeredes Melchioris Sessae; and the third in the yeere 1583. apud Dominicū Nicolinum. In all which he shall fynd tumulos adoremus, and not adornemus.
            
            
               
               M. Andrews his trifling toy of tumulos tangere answered.36. And now for as much as M. Andrews sayth very confidently, that the Greeke being 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                (which is in Latin capsulam tangere, to touch the shrine) he belieueth, that to touch the shryne, is not to adore it, I will debate the matter a litle with him, and make no doubt to proue that 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                in Greeke, &amp; tangere in Latin, as they are heere taken, do signify in effect adorare, that is to say to reuerēce, venerate, or worship, I meane not with diuine honour, but with such veneratiō as is due to Saynts, holy men, and holy things, for so signifyeth adorare in this place, and so the Cardinall, and all other Catholikes take it, when they apply it to Saynts, or holy reliques, as I will shew amply hereafter in the 9. Chapter, where I shall haue a good occasion to iustify the vse of it in that sense against M. Andrewes,
               
                  See after chap. 9. from nu. 10. to nu. 31. who will needs haue it to signify nothing els but to worship

                includeth, and expresseth an act of veneration.
            38. And vpon this occasion, I cannot omit to speak of an ancient kind of adoration with the hand, vsed amongst the Paynims; which was to stretch forth their hand towards the Sunne, or Moone, or what els soeuer they meant to adore, as though they would touch it, and then to kisse their hand: of which kind of adoration it seemeth Iob spake, when he sayd, that he had neuer kissed his hand when he saw the Sūne, and Moone, quae est, sayth he, iniquitas maxima, which is the greatest iniquity that may be. And from hence, no doubt descended the ciuil veneration, with the hand, whereof Martiall speaketh, when he sayth,
                  Martialis li. 8. epig. 65:
               
                  Roma salut auit voce manu

Rome saluted her Captayne both with voyce, and

hand. And the lyke we read in Tacitus,

            39. But now to returne to actuall touching for reuerence or deuotion (signifyed in Latin authors by the word tangere,
               
                  Plin. li. 11. cap. 48. as it was amongst the Greekes by 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , or 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               ) Pliny witnesseth that the ancient Grecians did vse attingere genua, vel mentum, to touch the knees or chinne of those, to whome they made supplication: and Seruius referreth the same to the forhead, saying, venerantes Deum tangimus frontem. We read also in Virgil, tangere aras, vsed for the taking of a solemne oath, by touching the altar; and in another Poet,
                  Ouidius.
               
               
                  Tange manu mensam, tangunt quo more precantes.
               
Touch the table with thy hand, as men are wont to do when they pray. Also the Paynims were accustomed to touch the right hands of their Gods for reuerence, and deuotion: whereupon Lucretius sayth:

                  —tum portas propter ahena

                      meantum.
               
The sense is, that the images of the Gods standing at the gates, had their right hands worne with the frequent touching of passengers. And as you heard before

in Homer, that Thetis touched the knees of Iupiter, when she did him reuerence:
                  Seneca i
                        •
                      Medea.
                so also Medea did the lyke to Creon in Seneca, which is expressed there with the word attingere. Finally, from hence it is lykely the custome grew, which is ordinary at this day, to offer to touch the knees, or the lower part of the garment of great personages, to do them honour, and reuerence.
            40. What meruaile is it then that the vse was in tymes past (as still it is) to touch holy things for reuerence sake, or that S. Chrysostome earnestly exhorted the people ther
                  •
               to in the place whereof we now treat, which may also be notably cōfirmed by the testimony of S. Gregory Nyssen in his Oration vpon S. Theodorus the Martyr,
                  S. Greg. Nyssen orat. in S. Theod.
                declaring what a wonderfull comfort it was to be admitted 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , to touch the Martyrs reliques (as I shall haue occasion to shew more at large after a whyle:S. Basil in Psal. 115.) and S. Basil also saith to the same purpose, qui contingit ossa Martyrum &amp;c. he which toucheth the bones of Martyrs, receiueth a kind of sanctification, by the grace that resideth in the body.
               
                  S. Greg. Nazianz. orat. 1. in Iulian.
                So he: to whome I may adde S. Gregory Nazianzen testifying, that the bodyes of Martyrs, and Saynts, siue manibus contrectentur &amp;c. whether they be touched with hands, or honored, are able to do as much as their holy soules.
            
            41. And hereof there hath alwayes byn manifest experience in the Church of God, yea euen in the old Testament,4. Reg. 13. where we read that a dead body was reuiued as soone as it touched the bones of the Prophet Elizaeus.
               
                  S. Aug. li. 22. de ciuit. Deica. 8. And the lyke recounteth S. Augustine of Eucharius a Priest, a religious woman, and a yong mayde, who being all 3. dead, were restored to lyfe as soone as their garments which had byn layd vpon the reliques

of S. Stephen were cast vpon them. Also he signifyeth that a blynd woman recouered her sight by applying to her eyes certayne flowers which had but touched the said Martyrs reliques.S. Ambros. li. 7. ep. 54. ad Marcellin.
                
               S. Ambrose also testifyeth the lyke concerning the relyques of S. Geruasius, and S. Protasius, saying: Cognouistis, imo vidistis &amp;c. you haue knowne, yea you haue seene many dispossessed of Diuels, and very many cured of their diseases, assoone as they touched the clothes of the Saynt. So he; who also further declareth that men vsed commonly to cast their garments super Sanctissimas reliquias, vpon their most holy reliques to the end they might become tactu ipso medicabilia, medicinable, or able to cure diseases euen by touching them. And finally he saith, that men desyred to touch though it were but the very extreme parts of their relyques, &amp; qui tetigerit, saith he, saluus 
                     •
                  rit, and he which toucheth them, shalbe safe, or healed.
            42. Now then all this being considered, with the circumstances of the place in S. Chrysostome (to wit, that he not only exhorted the people to touch the shryne of the Martyrs, but also to imbrace their reliques which faith, to the end they might receiue some benediction thereby) who seeth not that he doth euidently include an act of veneration, and deuotion, to be done to the tombe, and reliques of the Martyrs, by the reuerend touching of them. Whereupon it also followeth, that he who translated 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , tumulum adorare, giueth the true sense of S. Chrysostome, and so neyther he, nor the Cardinall following his translation hath committed any errour. And therefore M. Andrews may do well to rectify his beliefe (which was, as you haue heard, that Capsulam tangere, is not adorare) so as withall he learne to take adoration in the sense that

heere it is meant, and is frequently vsed in the holy Scriptures (I meane for a religious worship,
                  See cap. 9. nu. 14. &amp; 15. or veneration, inferiour to diuyne honour) which I hope to perswade him, or at least the indifferent Reader in the 9. Chapter.

                   4. lin. 7. Besides, that it may please him to free the Cardinall from the fraud, which he imputeth to him, for vsing adoremus, in steed of adornemus, seeing it is euident by this which I haue sayd, that adoremus expresseth the sense of tangamus, as it is vsed by S. Chrysostome in that place. And therefore whereas M. Andrews concludeth abesse voci litteram, Cardinali fidem, that there wants a letter in the word, and fidelity in the Cardinall, he may now vnderstand that there is no other want heere, but of wit in himselfe, or at least of a sincere will to vnderstand the place aright, according to the meaning of the author. And this shall suffice for answere to his censure vpon the Fathers of the first ranke.
            43. Now let vs see what he sayth to the second ranke of Fathers which he granteth to be truly cyted,
                  S. Ephr. Ser. de laud. SS. Mart Card. Apol. p. 15. but not to be of sound credit. The first of these is S. Ephrem, out of whome the Cardinall alledgeth these words: Precamur be atissimi Martyres &amp;c. we beseech you most blessed Martyrs,
               
                  Andr. ca. 1. p. 41. §. Proximi.
                
               that you will vouchsafe to pray vnto our Lord for vs wretched sinners, that the grace of Christ may come vnto vs. To this M. Andrewes answereth dyuers wayes;M. Andrews his crypticall cauill against the testimony alleadged out of S. Ephrem.
                first he taketh exception against the translation, both because the author thereof was one of ours (who fidelity and credit he saith hath byn long since cracked) and also because the originall (which is in Greeke) was, saith he, lately taken out of a grot, and therefore is fidei crypticae, of obscure credit. So it pleaseth him to make himselfe merry with

the word Crypta, for that Vossius the Translatour signifyeth in his Epistle to the reader, in the beginning of the first Tome, that he had a speciall help for his translation, by two very ancient manuscripts, or written copyes of S. Ephrems workes, which are to be seene in Crypta ferrata (a famous monastery neere to Rome called, commonly in Italian Grotta ferrata) of which manuscripts the one was written in the yeare of our Lord 531.
            44. But what cause had M. Andrews to iest at this? Sure I am, that in the iudgement of any indifferent man, it may serue for no small iustification of the translatour, that he fortifyeth his translation with the authority of such an ancient manuscript, written aboue eleuen hundreth yeares agoe, and yet extant to seene so neere to Rome, where his Tomes were printed, especially seeing that there is such continuall recourse, and confluence thither from Rome (by reason of the celebrity of that Monastery) that he might well think he should quickly be discouered for an impudent, and notable lyar, in case he should faygne the same. And therefore for his further iustification in this poynt, he also directeth his Reader to the very Classe where the sayd manuscripts are, to be found in the Library of Grotta ferrata, to wit, vnder the tytles of these Greeke letters ω, and ΤΤ. Besyds, that he declareth also further that he conferred the same copyes with dyuers other which he saw, and are yet to be seene in the Vatican at Rome, and in the library of Cardinall Sforza.
            
            45. So that these particularityes being considered, no man can with any reason, or without extreme malice imagin any fraudulent meaning in the translatour, seeing he remitteth his translation to the examination

of so many learned men, as Rome continually affoardeth, who might with all facility conuince him of fraud, if he had vsed any: and therefore M. Andrews sheweth more malice, then wit, in this exception, as also in that he reiecteth the translation, because the author thereof was a Catholyke. For albeit he say that Catholykes haue lost their credit in matters of that kind, yet I hope the discreet Reader (who hath already seene by many examples how litle credit M. Andrews deserueth) will not easily belieue him without some further proofe then his bare word. And this it seemeth he himselfe feareth, and therefore seeketh another shift in these words:

                  eketh to God in this manner: Ad te, ad praeter te nemiuem orationem facio, to thee, to none but thee I make my prayer. So he; not quoting any particuler Treatise, or chapter where the words which he cyteth are to be found; which by all lykelyhood he omiteth of purpose, the better to cloke a peece of coggery, which he may be worthily suspected to haue vsed in this poynt.
            46. For whereas he mentioneth the first tome of a true Ephrem, thou shalt vnderstand, good Reader, that there are no other works of S. Ephrem extant in Latin, but only the three Tomes aboue mentioned set forth by Vossius, except a litle pamphlet contayning a few sermons translated by a monke of Camaldula, which cannot deserue the name of a Tome: besides that, there is not any such prayer therein as he mentioneth, for ought I can find. And put the case

he could there shew the same words which he cyteth, yet they may be so vnderstood, that they will make nothing for his purpose.
                  Psal. 50. For euen as Dauid when he had committed homicide, and sinned not only against God,In what sense it is sayd that we pray to God alone. but also against his neyghbour, sayd neuertheles to almighty God, Tibi soli peccaui, I haue sinned against thee alone, because all sinne against man, doth finally redound to God: euen so, for as much as all our prayer is finally directed to God the author, and giuer of all grace, and goodnes, we may well say, that we pray to none but to him; albeit we vse therein the interuention, and assistance of Angels, Saynts, or men, by whome we also pray to God, when we craue, or procure their prayers to him for vs.
            47. And in this sense, no doubt that manner of prayer is to be vnderstood, if any such be in S. Ephrem, or in any other ancient Father: for otherwise it should contradict the custome of the Apostle, who vsed to craue the prayers of the Romans,

                  Col. 4. as also all good Christians are wont to recōmend themselues to the prayers one of another,
                  Heb. 13. and are warranted so to do by the holy Scripture: so as I shall not need to say any more concerning his true Ephrem, vntill he giue me further newes by whome he was translated, and published, how many tomes there are of him, and in what part of his first tome those words which he cyteth are to be found. And whereas he concludeth his censure vpon this place, with another deuyse, affirming that S. Ephrem might perhaps play the Oratour, and inuocate Martyrs by a figure called Prosopopaeia (whereupon, sayth he, you may perhaps ground an example of Rhetorick, but no rule of Diuinity) I will differre the answere

thereof for a whyle, because he handleth the same point more amply afterwards vpon another occasion.
            48. In the meane tyme I will proceed to the examination of his censure vpon a place of S. Chrysostome which the Cardinall cyteth thus:
                  S. Chrys. Hom. 66. ad Pop. Antioch. Ca
                        •

               Nam &amp; ipse qui purpuram indutus est &amp;c. For he also which is clad with purple commeth to imbrace these tombes, and all pryde layd aside, to pray to the Saynts, that they may pray to God for him. To this he answereth in substance,
                  Andr. pa. 41 §. lamdudum. that the homily from whence it is taken (to wit the 66. ad populum Antiochenum) is not S. Chrysostomes by the opinion not only of Erasmus, but also of our Garetius, yea and that the Cardinall himselfe knoweth that S. Chrysostome did not make 26. Homilyes ad populum Antiochenum, and much lesse 66. But heere I must aduertise him, that as the Cardinall knoweth that S. Chrysostome made not 66. Homilyes ad populum Antiochenum, so he also knoweth very well that all those homilyes are taken out of other vndoubted works of S. Chrysostome, and namely that very place which the Cardinall alledgeth, is to be seene word for word in S. Chrysostomes Homilyes vpon the Epistle to the Corinth. where the words cyted by the Cardinall in Latin are in Greeke thus:

            49. This I haue thought good for the satisfaction of those that vnderstand the Greeke to lay downe out of the Greeke text, in the 26. homily of S. Chrysostome vpon the second Epistle of S. Paul to the Corinthians, where there followeth in lyke māner further testimony for the Inuocation of Saynts, which is also to be

seene in the 66. homily ad Populum Antiochenum, albeit the Cardinall thought it needles, as it seemeth, to alledge the same, because the former seemed to him sufficient;A further testimony of S

                   Chrysostome touching the inuo

                  cation of Saynts. neuertheles I thinke it not amisse vpon this occasion to add a few words, which follow in the Greeke text, thus: 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               : that is to say, and which hath (or weareth) the diademe prayeth to the tent-maker, and the fisher, as to his patrons, yea though they be dead. Thus sayth S. Chrysostome in the same place immediatly after the words alledged by the Cardinall, as it may be seene not only in the 66. homily ad populum Antiochenū, but also in the homilyes vpon the Epistle to the Corinthians, which are acknowledged by all men to be S. Chrysostomes works. So that there is no doubt, but that the words alledged by the Cardinall are S. Chrysostomes, and do correspond to the Greeke text word for word, in which respect the testimony cānot be auoyded, and shifted of by M. Andrews, as eyther corrupt, or counterfait.
            50. And this as it seemeth, he knew well inough, and therefore deuysed another shift, seeming to admit that S. Chrysostome doth say so,
                  Andr. vbi supra.
                and yet denying that it maketh for vs. For, non quid fecerit, sayth he, tum aliquis, sed quid ex Patrum statuto fecerit &amp;c The King demandeth not what some man did then,
               This is nothing els but to cast shaddowes before the light, to obscure, &amp; not to seek out the truth. 
               but what he did according to the decree of the Fathers, and what at that tyme the Fathers decreed concerning this poynt? Where an act, or deed only is declared, &amp; no decree related, is a voluntary act, as of a matter of free deuotion, and not as of a thing necessary to saluation, which neuertheles the Cardinall vndertooke to proue. Thus farre M. Andrewes, turning, and wynding, as you see, to fynd some starting hole if it

were possible, though he be catcht so fast that he cannot escape away. For, wheras he flyeth to his former shift of demanding some decree of the Fathers, and reiecting their testimony of facts, he notably discouereth the weakenes of his cause.
            51. For,
                  Supra. nu. 26. &amp; 27. as I signifyed before (vpon the occasion of the selfe same answere which he made to a place of S. Basil) there was not any sufficient occasion, why the Fathers of the Greek Church should make any Synodicall decree at that tyme concerning prayer to Saynts,
                  Supra. nu. 19. &amp; 20. seeing that there was no question of it among them, but a generall custome, and practise thereof euery where, as I partly shewed by the testimony of S. Basil, &amp; the same may be clearly euinced euen by this place of S. Chrysostome, especially if we consider what followeth immediatly the words alledged by the Cardinall, and me. For S. Chrysostome hauing sayd (as you haue heard) that he which was clad with purple (meaning the Emperour) stood praying to the Saynts at their tombes, &amp; that he which weareth the di
                     •
                  deme doth pray to the tentmaker, and the fisher, as his Patrons, and protectours, addeth; Therefore darest thou be so bold to say, that their Lord,
               The custome of prayer to Saynts vniuersall in S Chrysostomes tyme. 
               or Mayster is dead, whose seruants, euen when they are dead, are the prot
                     •
                  ctors of the Kings of the world? And this is not only seene at Rome, but also at Constantinople, for euen here the Sonne of Constantine the Great, thought his father to be much honoured, if his body were layd before the Gates of the Fisher. Thus sayth S. Chrysostome, with much more to the same purpose, which I omit.
            52. For by this it appeareth sufficiently, first, that the custome, and practise of prayer to Saynts was vniuersall, I meane both in the Latin, and in the Greeke Church in the tyme of S. Chrysostome, which he signifyeth

expressely by naming the two principall Cittyes, and Imperiall Seates, to wit Rome, and Constantinople, where the same was in vre. Secondly it appeareth that it was not practised only by some obscure person (as M. Andrews seemeth to insinuate, when he sayth that the question is not quid aliquis tum fecerit, what some man did then) but that it was the custome of most worthy,M. Andrews impugning the custome of prayer to Saynts impugneth an argument of Christs diuinity. and remarkable persons, to wit, the most Christian and Catholyke Emperours themselues. Thirdly it is euident by this place, that S. Chrysostome hyghly approued this custome and belieued it to be most necessary, and conforme to the Christian and Catholyke verity, seing he doth notably vrge, and exaggerate the same, for the instruction, and edificatiō of the people, to shew vnto them, not only the great dignity, and glory of Gods seruants, and Saynts, but also the Omnipotent power, and diuinity of our Sauiour Christ.
            53. Whereupon it also followeth, that M. Andrewes, and others who deny this article of Catholike religion, do deny a notable argument of Christs Diuinity. And therefore whereas he contemneth such a fact as this of most Christian &amp; worthy Emperours, so testifyed,M. Andrews tryfleth notably in vrging the Cardinall to proue that prayer to Saynts is of necessity to saluation. approued and vrged by S. Chrysostome, as you haue heard, to proue that Christ is God, it is cleare that he cōdemneth the practise, &amp; beliefe of the Catholyke Church of that age, yea (and if by the decrees of the Fathers which he demandeth, he meaneth their expresse, and cleare doctrine deliuered in their workes) he condemneth also the decree of S. Chrysostome touching the same. And whereas he addeth for the conclusion of this poynt, that this fact related by S. Chrysostome, was but an act of voluntary deuotion, and not of a thing

necessary to saluation (which he sayth the Cardinall vndertooke to proue) he tryfleth notably; for neyther doth the Cardinall vndertake to proue any such thing, neyther is it materiall for the question in hand, whether it be of necessity to saluation, or no.
            54. The Cardinall vndertooke only to proue that the doctrine of the Protestans reiecting prayer to Saynts, is not the faith of the old primitiue Church, which he promiseth to proue by the testimony of the Fathers of the first 400. or 500. yeares, as it appeareth expressely by his owne words. Soquitur, saith he, vt ostendamus fidem &amp;c. It followeth that we shew the faith (which the King defends) not to be the faith of the old, and primitiue Church &amp;c.

                And agayne a litle after, hauing signifyed that his Maiesty in his preface, admitteth the 3. Creeds, the 4. first Generall Councells, and the vniforme doctrine of the Fathers of the first 400. (or as it is in the English copy 500. yeares) he declareth that amongst other poynts of Catholike religion his Maiesty condemneth Prayer to Saynts, and the veneration of Reliques, as superstitious. Whereupon the Cardinall sayth: Accipiam Intercessionem Sanctorum &amp;c. I will take in hand the intercession of Saynts, with the veneration of reliques, which if I can shew to be approued by an vnanime consent of the Fathers of the first 400. or 500. yeares,

               I shall withall proue that the King of Englands fayth is not the fayth of the old, &amp; primitiue Church, but the deuyses &amp; heresies of late innouatours. Thus saith the Cardinall, without touching any way the question, whether prayer to Saynts be necessary to saluation, which as I haue sayd litle importeth for the decision of the controuersy, whether the primitiue Church held it to be lawfull or no.

               55. For there is no doubt but that many things are, and may be lawfull, yea very cōmendable, and behoouefull to saluation, though they are not of such necessity, but that a man may in some cases be saued without them; as for example, the Euangelicall Counsayles, and many workes of supererogation (as almes, fasting, and such lyke, which consist in acts of voluntary deuotion) are conuenient and notable helps, though not absolutly necessary to euery mans saluatiō. And therefore albeit his Maiesty seemeth not to bynd himselfe further to admit the vniforme consent of the Fathers, then in matters necessary to saluation; yet for as much as the question concerning Prayer to Saynts, which the Cardinall vndertook to handle, is only whether the primitiue Church held it to be superstitious (as his Maiesty affirmeth it to be) the Cardinall needed not to debate and discusse,How the beliefe of prayer to Saynts is of necessity to saluation. whether it be of necessity to saluation; and therefore he forebare to speake thereof, as needles, and impertinent to the question in hand: neuertheles this occasion being now offered, I cannot omit to say, that if M. Andrwees do speake heere (not of the act, or practise of praying to Saynts, but) of the beliefe of the doctrine, demanding, whether it be of necessity to saluation to belieue that prayer to Saints is lawfull, I must needes tell him that it is so necessary, that if he, or any man els do obstinatly deny, and impugne it, he is an heretike, and consequently cannot be saued, and the reason is because he impugneth the beliefe, and practice of the vniuersall Catholike Church, which our Sauiour hath commaunded vs to heare, and obey, vnder payne to be held as Ethnicks,
               
                  Matth. 18. 
               and Publicans.
            
            56. Besides that, considering the inestimable benefits

that we may receiue both spiritually, and temporally by prayers to Saynts,Folly to neglect &amp; omit prayer to Saynts, impiety to contemn
                     •
                   it, heresy to cōdemne it. whereof the whole Church hath had sufficient, and publyke experience in all ages (as it is most euidēt by the testimonyes of these fathers, for the tymes when they liued) it cannot be denyed, but that to omit the practice of it, were extreme folly, and to contemne it were impiety. So as M. Andrews may now choose whether he will belieue, and practise this doctrine with the whole Catholyke Church, or els shew himselfe a foole in neglecting it, impyous in contemning it, or an heretyke in condemning and impugning it. And thus much for his censure vpon the place of S. Chrysostome.
            
            57. The next place which he censureth, is of Saynt Maximus Bishop of Turin,

                  dida virgo &amp;c. O worthy Virgin &amp;c. we beseech thee, with as feruent prayers, as we may, that thou vouchsafe to remember vs.

                   42. §. Maxmi.
                To this M. Andrewes answereth that the homilyes of Maximus, and almost all the rest which goe vnder the tytle of Sermones de tempore, and are of Saynts, are not very much to be esteemed: that this very homily which the Cardinall cyteth as of Maximus, was a long tyme held to be of Ambrose, and that now we haue made it to be the homily of Maximus: that we are wont to attribute these homilyes sometymes to one, and sometymes to another, as it pleaseth vs to make tytles: and finally, that nec fides certa, vbi author incertus, there is no sure credit to be giuen to a worke, wherof the author is vncertayne. So he. But how much this his censure is to be esteemed you may partly ghesse by his lyke censure vpon an homily of

                  See chap. 4. nu. 22.23. &amp; 24. See chap. 5. nu. 16. &amp; 17. whereof I treated amply in the 4. Chapter, and touched also againe in the last Chapter by occasion of an homily of S. Maximus made in the prayse of the Apostles, which I proued to be his, as also that he w

            58. And whereas M. Andrewes sayth heere, that this homily in the prayse of S. Agnes was a long tyme held for an homily of S. Ambrose, he might haue done well to haue told vs where he findeth the same. True it is, that S. Ambrose in his booke de Virginibus wryteth a notable encomium, or prayse of S. Agnes, and in his Epistles he wrote an elegant discourse of her life, martyrdome, and miracles; but that he was euer thought to be author of this homily, it is but a conceipt, or inuention of M. Andrews for ought I haue yet seene: and put the case, that that there hath byn some doubt or question whether of them was the author of it, will he conclude, as heere he doth, that therefore there is no credit to be giuen vnto it? If he will iustify that consequence, he must reiect, diuers parts of the holy Scripture, which neuerthelesse I hope he will acknowledge to be of sound credit; as in the old Testament the booke of the

               Caluin and diuers of his followers admit it for Scripture, yet they doubt greatly who was the author of it.
            59. So as if M. Andrewes will stand to his owne inference he must needs conclude, that the Epistle to the Hebrews is of no sound credit, which I thinke he will be loath to say, seeing that all the English Clergy doth at this presēt acknowledge it for Canonical Scripture. Besides, that although it should be true which he sayth (to wit that it hath byn doubted whether S. Ambrose, or S. Maximus were author of that homily) yet that can be no sufficient reason to reiect the doctrine of it, but rather an argument to fortify, and approue it, as both very sound, and very acient, seeing that it hath byn alwayes ascrybed to one of those two ancient, learned, and holy Fathers: and therefore to conclude, you see that M. Andrews hath sayd nothing to the purpose against this testimony produced by the Cardinall out of S. Maximus.
            
            60. There followeth another out of S. Gregory Nazianzen his oration,

And agayne in the same Oration, the same Father testifyeth that a holy Virgin called Iustina did pray vnto the Virgin Mary, to deliuer her from danger. To these two poynts M. Andrews answereth seuerally: to the first he sayth that the oration is not liquidae fide
                     •
                  , of cleare credit; and his reason is because

it is vncertayne who that Cyprian was of whome the oratiō was made, as whether he was Cyprian Bishop of Carthage, or another Cyprian of Antioch: and then he concludeth: Ita fluctuat res tota, ita perplexa omnia: So vncertayne is the whole matter, so perplexe, or doubtfull are all things in that oration. So he. Wherein you see how substantially he argueth, inferring that the matter, and substance of the oration is vncertayne, because it is doubtfull of which Cyprian the oration was made, whereas neuertheles he cannot with any reason deny but that the oration is S. Gregory Nazianzens: whereupon it must needs follow that albeit Nazianzen should be deceiued,

            61. And whereas M. Andrewes addeth concerning the latter poynt (to wit, the prayer of the mayd) that it was but a fact of a mayd, and then asketh whether the fact of a mayd is a statute of the Church? and whether a rule of fayth is to be grounded vpon a mayds act? I haue sufficiently answered him already touching the statutes,

Gregory affirmeth of that holy mayd.
            62. But will you now heare how well M. Andrewes concludeth all this matter?
                  Andr. vbi supra.
                forsooth he maketh an obiection against himselfe, saying in a different letter (as if the obiection were the Cardinalls) sed factum non reprehenditur,
               A notable collusion. of M. Andrews. but this fact of the mayd is not reprehended by S. Gregory Nazianzen: and then he addeth answering to his owne obiection: Immò, idem illud &amp;c. yea, but Epiphanius sharpely reprehended the selfe same, in the same age, in the Collyridian heretykes, when it was done by many of the same sexe. Thus saith M. Andrews, playing his part kindly, as well in his obiection as in his answere. For in his obiection (wherein he would seeme to speake for the Cardinall, or rather to lay downe his words) he dissembleth altogether what the Cardinall saith to vrge, and fortify that example of the mayde,
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . and therefore forbeareth purposely, as it may be thought, to set it downe in his margent with the rest of the Cardinalls text
                  •
                who after the words of S. Gregory before related (to wit Virginem Mariam rogauit &amp;c.
               S. Gregory Nazianzen highly approueth prayer to our Blessed Lady. 
               She besought the Virgin Mary to succour a Virgin in danger) addeth immediatly, ac paulo pòst refert eam &amp;c. and a litle after (Nazianzen) declareth that her prayer was heard. Vicit, inquit, virgo, vincitur daemon. The Virgin (saith he) ouercame, and the Diuel is ouercome.

Thus doth the Cardinall vrge this example, which as you see, is of much more force, then to say only (as M. Andrews saith) that S. Gregory did not reprehend the fact.
            63. For albeit his silence in not reprehending it may serue for an argument that he did not mislyke it, yet the other clearely proueth that not only he, but also God himselfe did notably approue it, seing he saith that she obtayned the effect of her prayer, and ouercame the Diuel: whereto I also add, that when that holy Father beginneth to recount the history of the mayde,S. Greg. Nazian. vbi supra
                he sayth thus: Audite Virgines, ac simul exultate &amp;c. Harken o ye Virgins, and reioyce also, yea all ye that esteeme chastity in matrimony, and loue Virgins, give eare, for to both sorts this my narratio may serue for an ornament. So he. Whereby it appeareth playnely that he meant to recount that which he would wish to be approued and imitated by others: whereupon it followeth that by this example he exhorted, and encouraged all those whose chastity should be endangered. to craue the help of the blessed Virgin, as that holy mayd did, who thereby (togeather with her other deuotions of fasting, and prayer to almighty God, which S. Gregory relateth) ouercame the Diuel and escaped the danger of his tentation. And could this holy Father more euidently declare what his faith and beliefe was, concerning prayer to Saynts, then not only to relate this fact of a holy Virgin without reprehension of it, but also to signify the happy euent, and successe thereof, yea, and to incyte others to the approbation,S. Epiph

            64. But now sayth M. Andrewes, although Nazianzen did not reprehend it
                  •
                yet Epiphanius did sharply

reproue idem illud, euen the selfe same fact in the same age in other women. If this be true, M. Andrews doth indeed say somewhat to the purpose (at least to proue that the Fathers of that age did not with vnanim consent allow prayers to Saynts;) but if it be false, and that he flatly belyeth S. Epiphanius,

                adoring her with diuine honour, offring vnto her certayne cakes in sacrifice, as though she had byn a God, or a Goddesse, and they her Priests: whereupon he discourseth amply, prouing first out of the old Testament, that nusquam mulier sacrificauit, aut Sacerdotio functa est, women haue neuer sacrifyced anywhere, or executed Priestly function. And then he commeth to the new Testament, where he sheweth also the same, and addeth further, that if women could euer haue byn admitted to Sacrifyce, the Virgin Mary her selfe should haue done it rather, then any other, neuertheles she neuer did: and finally he concludeth, that the body of the blessed Virgin Mary was reuera sanctum, sed non Deus, truely holy, but not God,
            65. By all which it appeareth, that these women, which Epiphanius reprehendeth, did not only take vpon them the Priestly function, but also cōmitted flat Idolatry, adoring the Virgin Mary with diuine honour, offring sacrifice vnto her, which is a worship due to God alone. Now then could a man belieue that M. Andrewes,

Or betwixt the vsurpation of Priestly function (whereof no woman is capable) and the oblation of priuate prayers, which is as free for women, as men? Doth euery one, or any one that prayeth to Saynts or Angels, crauing their help, and assistance (as that holy Virgin did) doth he, I say, adore them as Gods, commit Idolatry, offer Sacrifice, vsurpe the function of a Priest, as those women did, whome Epiphanius reprehended? Truly if M. Andrews can iustify this, he may boldly say, and write what he list. So as now you see that wheras he vndertooke to proue that this testimony of S. Gregory Nazianzen is not liquidae fidei, of cleare credit, he hath obscured, or rather clearly lost his owne credit, by an euident, and intollerable abuse of S. Epiphanius, without giuing the least blemish, or taynt in the world to the credit of the place that he impugneth: by the which it appeareth euidently, that the Inuocation of Saynts was vsuall in the tyme of S. Gregory Nazianzen, seeing that he himselfe did both inuocate Saynts, and also testify and approue the practise of it in others, as you haue heard: and this shall suffice for him.

                In which respect the Cardinall cyted this place no lesse then the former, and the rather, because the Inuocation of Saynts followeth of their prayer for vs; for if they pray for vs, we may lawfull craue their prayers, as I will shew more amply hereafter: so that I shall not need to stand longe vpon this place; only I will say, that whereas by occasion of this he affirmeth, that S. Augustine doth teach expressely, that Saynts are not to be inuocated at the altar, though they are named there, I shall haue better opportunity to speake fully of that poynt in the next Chapter; and in the meane tyme I will examine his answere to the Fathers of the third rank, whome he granteth to be true Fathers, and truly cyted, but nihil ad rem, nothing to the purpose. And this shall be the subiect of the next Chapter, because so many things occur to be debated, that they cannot be discussed in a few words.
         
         
            
            THE ANSVVERS OF Mr. ANDREVVS TO THE FATHERS OF THE THIRD RANKE, are examined, and found to be eyther impertinent, fraudulent, or most iniurious to them; namely to S

               Ambrose, whome he egregiously abuseth. ALSO It is euidently shewed, that the Inuocation of Saynts was generally practised and approued, as well by the ancient Fathers, as by all other faithfull Christians, in the Primitiue Church.

               TO the third rank of Fathers M. Andrews reduceth those whome the Cardinall affirmeth to haue expressely inuocated Saynts.S Greg. Nissen orat in S. Theodor. Card. Apol. p. 13. As for example, S. Gregory Nyssen Brother to S. Basil praying to Saynt Theodorus the Marter, sayth thus: Intercede ac deprecare &amp;c. Pray, and

make intercession for vs to our common King, and Lord, to obtayne vs grace &amp;c. And a little after: If there be need of greater prayer, or to call vpon the other Martyrs thy brethren, assemble the whole company, and pray togeather with them all, admonish Peter, stirre vp Paul, and Iohn the Deuyne, and beloued Disciple of Christ. Thus saith this ancient Father.

            2. Whereto, as also to all other places of lyke quality, and namely to three alledged by the Cardinall out of S. Gregory Nazianzen, S. Hierome, and S. Maximus, M. Andrews answereth in substance,

                that they are but figuratiue, and Rhetoricall speaches, after the manner of Orators, who in panegyricall and funerall Orations do commonly vse the figures prosopopaeia and Apostrophe, whereby they speake not only to dead men, as though they were liuing, but also to senselesse things, as Ambrose doth to the water of Baptisme, Eusebius to Piety,M. Andrews would make the ancient Fathers better Orators thē Christian

               Nazianzen to the Feast of Easter. And for the confirmation of this, he addeth that the Fathers themselues, when they spake to Saynts in that manner do not suffer themselues to be otherwyse vnderstood, seeing they confesse diuers tymes that they know not whether those to whome they speake, do heare them, or no; for so, sayth he, doth Nazianzen in an Apostrophe to the soule of Constantius the Emperour, and in the funerall Oration of his sister Gorgonia; as also Gregory Nissen in his Oration vpon Theodorus the Martyr; and Hierome in his Epitaph vpon Nepotianus. Whereupon he concludeth, that when the Fathers do inuocate Saynts by name in their panegyricall, and funerall Orations, Homilyes, or Sermons, they do it not as Christians, and Deuines, but as Orators and Rhetoritians; to wit, as the pagan Orator did, when he

said, Marce Druse te appello, I call vpon thee Marcus Drusus: or as the Poet sayd, Audis haec Amp

                  e sub terram abdite? dost thou heare these things, O Amphiaraus, being hid vnder the earth?
            3. And to this effect he maketh a larger discourse then he is commonly wont to doe, imploying therein all the art he hath, because he seeth it to be very needfull to dazell the eyes of the Reader with the splendour of a Rhetoricall answere: but truly he had need of more Rhetorik then euer had Cicero, or Demosthenes to perswade a learned, and discreet Reader, that the Fathers do inuocate Saynts rather as Orators, then as Christians, rather in shew then in deed, and by Rhetorical figures, rather then with religious deuotion. And therefore whereas the confirmation, and proofe of this his conceipt, consisteth specially in that he sayth the Fathers themselues do seeme now and then to doubt, whether those whome they inuocate in that manner do heare them, I must admonish him of foure things, for the full answere of his obiection.
            4. First that he make a difference betwixt the soules of dead men in generall,M. Andrews ad
                     •
                  uertised of 4. things. and of such as are known Saynts, and honored by Almighty God with publyke miracles: for albeit the Fathers in the funerall  Orations of some lately dead, might seeme with great reason to doubt whether they heard them, or no (knowing right well that the dead,
                  Matth. 5. yea though they were good men are not receiued into glory vntill they haue as our Sauiour speaketh, payd the last farthing of the debts cōtracted in this lyfe) yet they made no such doubt cōcerning the Saynts whose feasts were publikly celebrated in the Church, as were the feasts of S. Theodorus the Martyr, S. Cyprian, and S. Agnes, of

whome, the first was in
                  •
               ocated by S. Gregory Nissen, the second by S. Gregory Nazianzen, and the third by S. Maximus in their festiuall dayes, celebrated with great solemnity, as it appeareth in the Orations, and Homilyes of the sayd Fathers cyted by the Cardinall.
            5. Secondly, he is to vnderstand that such conditionall  speaches, as he obiected out of S. Gregory Nazianzen in his Apostrophe to the soule of Constantius the Emperour to wit,Conditionall speaches do not alwayes suppose a doubt in the speaker. 
               si quis tibi istorum sensus sit, if thou haue any feeling, or vnderstanding of these things) and agayne to his sister Gorgonia (si fanctae animae haec talia prefe
                     •
                  tiscant, if holy soules do vnderstand things of this quality) these, I say, &amp; such lyke do not alwayes signify a doubt in him that vseth them, but rather sometymes an affirmatiō, or assurance of that which he may seeme to doubt of, being vsed rather by the way of obsecratiō, thē otherwyse. As for example, if a man should say to some great fauorite of a Prince, If you haue any credit with your Mayster, procure me this fauour. Or if one deare friend should say to another, If you loue me, do this for me; these māners of speach do signify nothing els in effect, but because it is certayne, that you haue so great credit with your maister, that you may obtaine of him what you will procure me this grace at his hands: or because I am sure you loue me, therefore let it appeare in doing this for me;

               herfore

receiue him as my selfe; and that the Apostles meaning was no other then this, it is euident by that which followeth, when he sayth; Confidens in obedientia tuae &amp;c. trusting in thy obedince,
                  Ibid.
                I haue written vnto thee, knowing that thou wilt doe aboue that which I say. Therefore M. Andrewes must not make such a generall rule of such condicionall speaches as he doth, but rather vnderstand, that when the Fathers do vse any such concerning glorified soules, and knowne Saynts, they vse them no otherwyse then as affirmations, or rather earnest obsecrations,M. Andrews maketh the ancient Fathers very vnchristian and wicked Oratours. as if they should say, because I am sure thou knowest what is done heere on earth, therefore help, and assist those which recommend themselues vnto thy prayers.
            6. Thirdly,  I wish M. Andrews well to consider how absurdly he maketh the Fathers (I will not say rather Orators then Christians, as he himselfe termeth them, but) very vnchristian, and most wicked Orators, if it be true which he, and his fellowes teach concerning the Inuocation of Saynts.
                  Melanch. in antith. Verae doctri. &amp; Pontif. Magdeb. cent. 1. l. 2. c. 4. colum. 340. Brent in Apol. Confes. VVittemb. Beza. in Respons. ad Nicolaum Seluec. Andr. cap. 8. p. 150. liu. 45. For who knoweth not, that all the sectaryes of this tyme do hold the same to be iniurious to Christ (yea and diuers of them affirme it to be blasphemous, and Idolatricall; for so teach Melanchthon, the Magdeburgenses, Brentius, Bezae, and diuers others of them) and M. Andrewes himselfe sayth, that when we inuocate Saynts, we giue them the place of Christ, and make other mediators besids him, wherein he signifieth euidently, that we do iniury to Christ. And if this be true, what a wicked, and impious Rhetorik was this of the fathers not only to inuocate Saynts themselues, but also to induce others vnto it by their example?
            7. For although there is no doubt, but that in their

writings, &amp; specially in their panegyricall &amp; funerall Oratiōs they vsed all ornamēts of Rhetorike fit for the subiects wherof they treated (in matters wherein there was no longer of scandall, or errour) yet it were absurd to think that they would vse them in such sort that their audience might be scandalized, and drawne into errour thereby, or that they would themselues, so much as in shew and apparence, violate the least poynt of Christian doctrine, or seeme to do iniury to Christ; or finally that they sought rather to be eloquent then religious: and therefore M. Andrews must eyther acknowledge the Inuocation of Saynts to be lawfull, or els confesse that he hath a most profane, and irreligious conceipt of the ancient Fathers, in affirming, as he doth, that they vsed the same, not as Deuynes, but as Rhetoritians, and not as Christians, but as Orators.
            
            8. Lastly to put this matter out of all doubt, and to discouer the impertinent vanity of M. Andrews in  this poynt, let vs cōsider the circumstāces of one of the places now heere in question betwixt the Cardinall,
                  S. Greg. Nyssen. orat. in Theodor. Mart.
                and him, I meane the same place of S. Gregory Nissen, which I haue layd downe before, taken out of his oratiō made in the solemnity of the feast of S. Theodorꝰ the Martyr, wherein S. Gregory hauing first touched the great celebrity of the feast by the confluence of all sorts of people, farre and neere, moueth them to consider thereby how God rewardeth the iust man, not only in earth and thereby also incyteth them further to aspyre to the lyke rewards, by the imitation of the vertues of those whome God so honoureth; and to this end he discourseth amply of the great honour that was euery where exhibited to the reliques of martyrs, and particulerly of that holy Martyr in that place, and feast, elegantly

declaring the magnificence of the Church where his feast was celebrated adorned with excellent workemanship of all sorts
                  •
                and namely with pictures,Pictures of Martyrs vsed in Churches, and highly approued by S. Gregory Nyssen. liuely expressing the particularityes of his Martyrdome, wherein, by the way, we may note the vse of the pictures of Saynts in Churches in those dayes, yea and that they were held to be very profitable for the instruction of the people, seeing that S. Gregory Nissen sayth also vpon this occasion:The great deuotion of Chrians in the reuereut touching of holy reliques, approued by S Gregory Nyssen. 
               Solet enim pictura tacens in pariete loqui, maxime
                     
                        
                     
                     que
                   prodesse: for the picture which is sylent vpon the wall is wont to speak, and to profit exceedingly. So he

                giuing to vnderstand, that the sight of the picture, or paynted history did greatly edify the people, and styre them vp to the imitation of the Saynts vertues, and holy lyfe. But to proceed.
            9. After this the same Father relateth the feruent deuotion of the people, greatly desiring to approach to the tombe of the Martyr; Credens, sayth he, contrectationem eius esse sanctificationem, &amp; benedictionem, belieuing that the very touching of it would be a sanctification &amp; benediction; yea seeking to get but some of the dust about the tombe, esteeming the same as a thing of great pryce; and if they could haue the good fortune to touch the reliques themselues, he appealeth to their owne experience and knowledge,The Inuocation of holy Martyrs expresly mentioned and allowed by S Gregory Nyssen. how prosperous, and happy they would thinke themselues, and how they would imbrace the sayd reliques, kisse them, and apply them to their eyes, eares, and all the instruments of their senses
                  •
                
               Deinde saith he, deuotionis &amp; affectonis lachrimas Martyri &amp;c. And then powring forth teares of deuotion and affection to the Martyr, as though he were there whole, and aliue, they exhibite their humble petition vnto him, as to the seruant of God, and as one that being

inuocated (for so signifieth the Greeke 
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . word) receiueth what gifts soeuer he will. Thus saith this ancient, and holy Father, and then concludeth: ex hijs omnibus, ô popule pie, discite &amp;c. O pious, or godly people learne by all this, that the death of Gods Saynts, is honourable, and precious in his sight.
            
            10. All this I haue thought good to lay downe at large, first to confirme all that which hath hitherto byn treated concerning the custome of the Church at that tyme, not only in the veneration of holy reliques, but also in the expresse Inuocation of Saynts
                  •
                secondly that this holy Father making all this discourse in the solemnity of that Martyrs feast, to styrre vp the people as well to deuotion towards God, and the Martyr, as to the imitation of the Martyrs vertues (for so he himselfe professeth) did highly approue all that which he hath heere related, and consequently when afterwards in the conclusion of the Oration he himselfe inuocated the Martyr, he did it of pure deuotion and not of vayne ostentation of his eloquence, not as a flanting Rhetorician, or Oratour, but as a religious Deuine, and deuout Christan, a pious Pastour, and teacher of his flock, to whome he preached, for whome he prayed,
                  S. Greg. Nyssen. vbi supra.
                and whome he sought to moue by his owne example, to concurre with him in the Inuocation of the Martyr.
            11. Wherein also M. Andrews may if it please him note the word Inuocation vsed by this Father for prayer to the Martyr,
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  
                of whome he sayth, that the people prayed vnto him, and called vpon him as the Mynister of God, and as one that receiued (or obtayned of God) what gifts he would 
               
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                that is say, being inuocated; for I thinke M. Andrewes will not deny that

                in Greeke doth properly signify inuocare in Latin, and in English to inuocate. And therefore because he is so curious to runne to the Greeke in all occasions to examin our cytations of the Greeke Fathers, I remit him heere to the Greeke; for that I haue byn in this no lesse (if not more) curious then he,M Andrews remitted to the Greek text, wherto he ordinarily appealeth. hauing searched the old manuscripts of the Vatican, where I haue seene two written copyes of S. Gregory Nyssen, both of them very ancient, and in them both haue found the Greeke words, as heere I haue layd them downe in the margent, with all the rest, very conforme to the Latin translation; and therefore I hope he can take no iust exceptions thereto.
            12. And how then do you thinke he will seeke to elude this euident testimony of this ancient Father? Marry (forsooth) because he findeth,A shifting euasion of M. Andrews refuted. that he sayth to the Martyr, vbicumque tamdem fueris, wheresoeuer thou art, he inferreth thereupon, that the Father calleth vpon him doubtfully, and that fluctuant hic omnia, fides nulla de hijs, securum nihil; all things are heere vncertayne, no faith or beliefe is to be had of these things,
                  Andr. pag 44. lin. 12. nothing at all secure. So he. And shall then all this serious discourse of this holy Father, directed especially to the glory of God,
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . and the hono
                  •
               r of his Martyr, in the solemnity of his feast, in a publike assembly of the people, and for their instruction and edification (wherin he testifyed, and highly commended their deuotion to the Martyr, the honour they did vnto him, yea to his very reliques, and their expresse Inuocation, of him, with teares of deuotion, and affection, for so saith the Greeke:) shall all this, I say, be vncertayne, voyde of faith, and beliefe, voyde of security, only because M. Andrewes hath found therein, vbicumque fueris?

Can any man imagin that S. Gregory Nyssen would publikely bely the people, euen to their faces, or yet approue their deuotion to the Martyr, and their inuocation of him, if he did not belieue it to be acceptable to God, and no way repugnant to the Catholike faith?
            13. And agayne on the other side, if all that he sayd was true and highly approued by him (as it is euident it was) can we desire a more cleare testimony of the beliefe of this holy Father, and the Church in his tyme concerning the inuocation of Saynts? And what then if he should haue doubted where the soule of the Martyr was (acknowledging neuertheles that wheresoeuer he were, he was highly in Gods fauour) would it follow thereon, that all his former discourse was eyther false, or impertinent? Or that he doubted whether the Martyr could heare,M. Andrews his doubt retorted vpon him selfe. or help them that did inuocate him? Nay might not M. Andrewes rather gather directly thereof, that S. Gregory Nissen, and the people belieued that the Martyr heard their prayers, saw their deuotion, and vnderstood their actions, yea could, and would help them wheresoeuer he were, seeing that they craued his help, not knowing where he was? Of this truly there can be no doubt.
            14. But for M. Andrewes his better satisfaction in this poynt,
                  Ioan. 14. I must needs desire him to call to mynd what our Sauiour himselfe teacheth concerning the many mansions in his Fathers house,What S. Gregory Nyssen meant when he sayd to S. Theodore Wheresoeuer thou art. signifying thereby that as there be many mansions, so also there are different degrees of glory which God imparteth to his Saynts; whereby M. Andrews may also vnderstand (if it please him) that S. Gregory Nissen alluding thereto, had reason to speake doubtfully of the mansion, or place where the Martyr was, and degree of glory,

wherewith God had blessed him, because no mortall man can know it without speciall reuelation, neyther yet is it knowne to vs in what sort the glorified soules are imploied in the seruice,
                  Nyssen. vbi supra.
                and prayse of God in those heauenly mansions; in which respect the Father spake also doubtfully thereof, beseeching the Martyr that wheresoeuer he was, or howsoeuer he was imployed in Gods seruice, he would vouchsafe (as an inuisible friend) to come to visit the assembly of those that honoured him, and to prayse and thank God, togeather with them, euen for the rewards that God had bestowed vpon him, for shedding his bloud in the confession of his faith.
            15. This then beeing so, I leaue it to thee, good Reader,M. Andrews a wrangler in the highest degree. to iudge whether M. Andrews be not a true 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , and a Wrangler in the highest degree, seeing that he not only dissembleth the whole drift, and scope of this ancient Father, and all the substance of his discourse; but also impugneth the same with some of the Fathers owne words, or his manner of speach, ill vnderstood, and wrested from the Fathers meaning
                  •
                besides that, it also appeareth, what a friuolous and vayne euasion he hath sought heere to auoyd the force of diuers pregnant, and vnswerable places alledged by the Cardinall, I meane not only this of S. Gregory Nissen, but also the others before mentioned, to wit, of S. Gregory Nazianzen, S. Hierome, and S. Maximus, inuocating expressely S. Cyprian, the holy widdow Paula, and S. Agnes: all which, as also all other places to the same purpose he laboureth to frustrate (as you haue heard) with a deuise of an Apostrophe, and a proso
                     •
                  opaeia; whereas no man can doubt, but that those Fathers did therein exercise acts of pure deuotion (as

you see S. Gregory Nyssen did) according to the beliefe, and practice of the whole Church at that tyme; which is euident by the testimonyes that you haue heard already, and wil be much more manifest by those that yet rest to be examined. And this shall suffice for this poynt.
            16. The next place that he taketh in hand to answere, is one of S. Ambrose in these words:
                  Ambros
                        •
                      l. de viduis. Card. in Apol. p. 15. 
               Obsecrandi sunt Angeli &amp;c. The Angels which are giuen vs for Guardians, and defenders are to be prayed vnto; and the Martyrs in lyke manner, whose protection we seeme to challenge, by hauing their bodyes in pledge, they may pray for our sinnes,
               S. Ambrose shamefully calumniated by M. Andrews. 
               who with their owne bloud haue washed away their owne sinnes, if they had any. 
               
                  〈◊〉
                saith S. Ambrose. Whereto M. Andrewes answereth, that the Cardinall might very well haue forborne to produce this place, and not haue cyted it so greedily, as he hath donne, but that, he litle careth (saith he) as it seemeth, that the bloud of Christ should be held for superfluous,
               
                  Andr. p. 45. §. Pot
                        •
                     
                     rat.
                
               rather then he would not pray to Saynts; for, superfluus certè sanguis Christi &amp;c. truly the bloud of Christ is superfluous, if Martyrs can wash away their sinnes with their owne bloud. So he.
            17. Wherevpon he also inferreth, that the Reader may preceiue heereby, that Ambrose wrote this when he was but a Nouice in Chistian religion, and that it is no meruaile, if he sayd, that Martyrs are to be prayed vnto, seeing he teacheth
                  •
                that they haue washt their sinnes with their owne bloud. Wherein appeareth the modesty of M. Andrews, and his good spirit, who rather then he will acknowledge his owne errour (which is euidently conuinced by this place) chargeth this holy Father with the most execrable, and blasphemous doctrine

that can be imagined, as to teach that the bloud of Christ is superfluous; which any Christian hart would abbore to heare, and much more to hold, and teach; seeing that it must needs follow thereupon, that all Christian religion, and beliefe is in vayne being all grounded vpon the merits of Christs Passion, and his precious bloud shed for vs.
            
               S. Ambrose cleared from M. Andrews his slaunderous imputation by the vniforme doctrine of holy Scriptures and Fathers.18. And truly if S. Ambrose may be charged with this blasphemous opinion, for the cause which M. Andrewes alledgeth, then all the Fathers of Gods Church yea the Apostles themselues may in lyke manner be charged therewith. For all of them say as much in effect, as S. Ambrose doth, which also may by some peruerse and hereticall 
                  •
               rayne be wrested to the same peruerse sense, albeit to those who do consider the grounds of their doctrine, and beliefe, the contrary is euident. For who knoweth not (if malice do not blynd-fold, and wholy peruert his vnderstanding) that when in the holy Scriptures, and Fathers, any merit, sufficiency, or cooperatiō to saluation is attributed to a man, or to his fayth, works, or any endeauour of his, the same is vnderstood to proceed principally from the merits of Christs Passion, which is the cause, ground, and foundation of all grace, goodnes, and merit in man; and therefore is alwayes supposed, and necessarily vnderstood in all such manner of speach, as this of S. Ambrose, though it be not expressed.
            
               
                  Nazian. orat. 1. in. Iulian.
               19. As when we read in S. Gregory Nazianzen that certayne Christian souldiars hauing committed Idolatry, exhorted one another, vt Christo satisfacerent sanguine suo, to satisfy Christ with their bloud: and in S. Cyprian:
               
                  Cypr. li. 4. ep. 2. 
               omnia peccata passione purgare, to purge all sinnes by passion, or suffering. And agayne in another

               redimere peccata &amp;c. to redeeme sinnes with iust sorrow, and satisfaction; and to wassh the wounds (of sinne) with teares.
               
                  li. 3. ep. 14. Also in the same Father, Deo precibus, &amp; operibus satisfaccre, to satisfy God with prayers, and workes:
                  in ser. de opere &amp; eleemos.
                and, sordes eleemosynis abluere, to wash away the filth (of sinne) with almes. And in Origen, Poenitendo, flendo, satisfaciendo delere quod admissum est, to abolish,
                  Origen. bo. 6. in exod.
                or blot out that which hath byn committed, with repentance, weeping, and satisfaction. Also in Tertullian,
               
                  Tertul. li. 2. de poeniten. ca. 7. Ibid. ca. 6. that the sinner hath cui satisfaciat, to whome he may giue satisfaction, and that God doth offer vs, impunitatem poenitentiae compensatione redimendam, impunity, or remission of punishment to be redeemed with the recompence of pennance.
            20. We read also in Irenaeus, that our goods, or substance being giuen to the poore,
                  Iren. li. 4. c. 26. in sine.
                
               solutionem faciunt praeteritae cupiditatis, do cause solution (or remission) of our former couetousnes. Also in S. Augustine, that for daily, and light sinnes, quotidiana oratio fidelium satisfacit, the daily prayer of the faythfull doth satisfy.

                And in S. Hilary, that Dauid facti veteris crimen lacrymis abluit, Dauid washt away the fault of his old deed with teares. In S. Chrysostome, that S. Peter adeo abluit negationem &amp;c. did so wash away his denyall of Christ (with his teares, or repentance) that he was made the chiefe Apostle. And agayne in the same Oration;

                   fieri precium in illo die, and become a price to redeeme our soule in the day of iudgement.
                  S. Greg. li. 6. in 2. Reg. 15

                  ca. 2. Finally, to omit innumerable other places of the rest of the Fathers, S. Gregory the great teacheth, that peccata delenda sunt austeritate poenitentiae,
               
sinnes are to be blotted out with the austerity of pē
               nance, and, the possunt satisfactione purgari, they may be purged with satisfaction. Thus say these holy Fathers.
            21. And now will M. Andrews charge them all to teach, that the bloud of Christ is superfluous, because they speake of mens satisfaction for sinne (by washing the same with teares, and by purging, and redeeming them with almes, pēnance, and Martyrdome) without mention of Christs satisfaction for vs? May he not take the lyke exception also to diuers speaches in the holy Scripture as peccatū tuum eleemosynis redime;
                  Dan. 4. redeeme thy sinne with almes,
                  Prou. 16. 
               misericordia, &amp; veritate redimitur iniquitas, iniquity is redeemed with mercy, &amp; verity
                  •
                
               spesalui facti sumus,
               
                  Rom. 8. we are saued by hope; baptisma vos saluos facit, baptisme saueth you; saluos nos fecit per lauachrum regenerationis,
               
                  Tit. 3. he hath saued vs by the water of regeneratiō;
                  Philip. 2. 
               operamini salutem, work your saluation, and the lyke in diuers other places: may he not, I say, cauill as well agaynst these speaches, as agaynst the other in S. Ambrose? Yes truly.
            
               The reason why baptisme, pennance, good works, Martyrdome, and such lyke, are sayd to saue vs, without derogatiō to the Passion of Christ.22. For the reason is all one in both, it being euident, that the merit of Christs precious blood, and death is presupposed, and necessarily vnderstood as well in the one, as in the other: and as Baptisme, and Hope are speciall meanes to apply vnto vs the merits of Christs passion (in which respect they are sayd in the Scripture to saue vs;) so also teares of repentance, pennance, almes, good workes, and Martyrdome (wherof S. Ambrose speaketh) are speciall meanes to apply vnto vs the satisfaction of Christ; and in that respect the Fathers say, that they satisfy for vs, wash away, blot out, and purge our sinnes, to wit, as secondary causes

that haue their operation by the vertue, and force of the first cause (which is the merits of our Sauiours passion:) and therefore if a man should say, that a Phisitian had saued his lyfe, he could not with reason be thought to derogate any thing eyther from the operation of the medicine, or from the prouidence, or power of God, who gaue force to the medicine, and good successe to the Phisitian; as neyther he that should say the medicine saued his life, could be thought to do iniury eyther to God, or to the Phisitian.
            23. For whereas many causes do commonly concurre to one effect,M. Andrews shewed to b
                     •
                   eyther very ignorant, or exceeding malicious. euery cause may well be sayd to work the effect, without denyall of the concurrence of other causes, and especially of the first cause, by vertue whereof all the rest haue their opperation. So that M. Andrews sheweth himselfe eyther very ignorant, or totoo malicious, in saying, that S. Ambrose maketh the bloud of Christ superfluous, because he sayth, that the Martyrs wash away their sinnes with their owne bloud, as though he denyed the vertue of Christs passion by ascribing remission of sinne to Martyrdome, which is an inferiour, and secondary cause thereof, as being an immediate meanes to apply the force and fruit of Christs passion vnto vs; and therefore whereas he sayth, it is no meruaile that S. Ambrose who so sayd, did not also stick to say, that we may pray to Saynts; it is indeed no meruaile at all, seeing that his speach is in both most conforme to reason, Scriptures, Fathers, and to the doctrine of the whole Church. But truly the wonder is, that any modest Christian, and especially one that pretends to be a Prelate in Gods Church, should be so temerarious, and audacious, as to lay so foule an imputation as he doth here, vpon one of the

most holy, and famous Fathers of Gods Church, for speaking only in such sort, as all other Fathers speake, yea the Scriptures themselues, as I haue already shewed.
            24. Yea but S. Ambrose changed his mynd (sayth M. Andrewes) in the later poynt (to wit concerning prayer to Saynts) for Ambrosio,
               
                  Andr. p. 45. § Poterat.
                sayth he, alibi alia mens prouecto iam, meliùs edocto: Ambrose was elswhere of another mynd, when he waxed elder, and was better learned. So he; and how doth he proue this? Marry for sooth by two manyfest testimonyes of his, as he saith, for thus he goeth forward, cuius nota sententia ad Deum suffragatore non est opus,
               S. Ambros. in cap. 1. ad Rom.
                
               certe nec obsecratore, whose knowne opinion, or sentence is, there is no need of a suffragator, or helper to God, nor yet of a beseecher, &amp; illa:
               
                  Idem oration. de obitu Theodos.
                
               tu solus Domine inuocandus es; and that other, thou only, O Lord art to be inuocated. Thus sayth he, alledging, as you see, two places out of S. Ambrose, and cyting for the former his Commentary vpon the Epistle to the Romans, and for the latter, his funerall Oration vpon Theodosius the Emperour. But in the former you may note partly his euil hap, and partly his folly;M. Andrews vnfortunate, foolish, &amp; fraudulēt, and first touching his euil fortune. in the latter his fraud, and falshood. His euil hap is manifest in the former, because, to shew that S. Ambrose recalled his doctrine which he had deliuered in an vndoubted worke of his, M. Andrews bringeth a testimony calling it notam sententiam, a knowne sentence, or opinion of S. Ambrose, albeit he take it out of a worke, which in the opinion of diuers learned men was not written by S. Ambrose; and so perhaps M. Andrews himselfe would tell vs,
                  Coment. in ca. 3. ep. 
                  
                     •
                  . ad Tim.
                if we should obiect against him out of that Commentary that Pope Damasus was head, or gouernour of the whole Church, because

we read there, cuius (Ecclesiae) hodie rector est Damasus, of which (Church) Damasus is gouernour at this day.
            25. Neuertheles I say not this because I meane to reiect the authority of that Commentary,
                  See chap. 1. nu. 7. hauing alledged it my selfe before against M. Andrewes, as S. Ambrose his worke, which I haue done partly because it is commonly cyted vnder his name, being amongst his other workes, and no other Author of it knowne; and partly because M. Andrews himselfe approueth it so highly, as you see in this place, and therefore I made account that howsoeuer others may take exception to it, and to my allegation of it, yet he can take none, but must needs admit it; wherein also I wish this difference to be noted betwixt his allegation thereof, and myne, that I did not wholy rely vpon the authority of it, but fortifyed it with a most pregnant place taken out of a knowne, and assured worke of S. Ambrose for the satisfaction of such as might doubt of the former;
                  Ibidem.
                whereas he being driuen to such an exigent as you haue seene (that is to say,
                  Posseuin. in Appar. Maldonat. in cap. 17. Matt. Bellar. de amiss. gra. lib. 4. c. 9. §. Sed facilis.
                flatly to deny S. Ambrose his cleare doctrine) and vndertaking to shew that he recalled it afterwards, professeth to produce an vndoubted and knowne testimony of S. Ambrose, cyting neuertheles a worke which diuers learned men, as I haue said, do hold to be none of his, as it may be seene in Posseuinus, Maldonatus, Cardinall Bellarmine, and others; which, I say, I cannot but ascribe to some euil fortune that haunteth M. Andrews, and forceth him to ground all his buildings vpon such weake, and vnsure foundations, that there is no true solidity in anything he sayth, or produceth out of others.
            26. And put the case there were no doubt at all

to be made of the Author of that Commentary,M Andrews his folly in alledging a place against prayer to Saynts, which doth nothing concerne it. but that he was vndoubtedly S. Ambrose, yet M. Andrews sheweth himselfe not only vnfortunate, but also most foolish, and ridiculous, in that the place which he alledgeth out of it, against prayer to Saynts, doth not concerne it at all, nor impugne any thing els, but Idolatry to the Sunne, Moone, Planets, and Starres, which S. Paul reproued in the Pagans in his Epistle to the Romans, by the occasion whereof the Author of the Cō
               mentary sayth that those Idolatrous Paynims of whome the Apostle speaketh were wont to excuse their Idolatry,
                  Rom. 1. by saying, that by the inferiour Gods, men did come to the highest and chiefe God,
                  Ambros. in cap. 1. ad Rom.
                as by Counts, or Earles to the King: &amp; then he addeth, 
                  Numquid it a demens est aliquis &amp;c.
Is any man so mad, or so vnmindfull of his owne good, that he giueth the Kings honour to the Count? For if any be found that do but only treate of such a matter, they are worthily condemned as Traytours, and yet these (Pagans) do not thinke themselues guilty of treason, when they giue the honour of the name of God to his creature, and forsaking their Lord, do adore their fellow-seruants, as though any thing more can be reserued to God. For men do therefore go to the King by his Tribunes, or Counts, because the King is but a man, and knoweth not whome he may trust with the Common wealth: Ad Deum autem (quem vtique nihil latet, omnia enim merita nouit) promerendum, suffragatore non est opus, sed mente deuota; but to deserue the fauour of God (from whome nothing is hid, and who knoweth all mens merits) there is no need of a suffragator, or helper, but of a deuout mynd.
Thus saith that Author in that place, be he S. Ambrose, or who els soeuer.
            
               27. Wherein it is to be obserued,What the authours scope and drift was in the place alledged by M. Andrews. that his whole scope, and drift is to confute the Idolatrous Pagans, who did not so much vse the help, and mediation of creatures to come to God (which no man can deny to be lawfull, so that it be done in due manner) as they gaue to creatures both the name of God and the honour due to him, calling them Gods, and adoring them with diuine honour, that is to say, with sacrifice which is a worship due to God alone; and this they did because they were of opinion that the chiefe God did not otherwise know mens minds, or actions, nor could otherwyse gouerne the world, but by the inferiour Gods, as kings cannot otherwyse gouerne their realmes, but by their officers, in which respect the author sheweth the difference betwixt God, &amp; earthly Kings, opposing to their ignorance Gods knowledge of all mens harts, and secret thoughts, and thereupon concludeth that, Ad Deum promerendum suffragatore opus non est, there is no need of a suffragator to deserue the fauour of God, sed mente deuota, but of a deuout mynd: giuing to vnderstand, that God, to whome all mens mynds and harts are manyfest, knoweth and seeth the deuotion and merits of euery man, though no man intimate, or relate the same vnto him.
            28. Wherevpon it followeth, that there is no such absolute necessity to come to God by the meanes of others, as the Paynims imagined, seeing that any man may (according to the doctrine of this Author) come to him immediatly by the deuotiō of his owne mynd, yea &amp; by his merits, which, by the way, I wish M. Andrews to obserue in this place, where the author signifieth that there is no need of a suffragator ad Deum promerendū, to merit or deserue Gods fauour, because God knoweth omnia

merita,
               M. Andrews clippeth the Fathers authorities that they may not speake against him all merits; which words (I meane promerendum, and omnia merita) M. Andrews thought good to leaue out of the text, which he alledgeth, albeit the Authors meaning, and the true sense of the place cannot be well vnderstood without them, especially promerendum, which is essentiall to the text; for the Author saith, ad Deum promerendum suffragatore non est opus. So as you see, how M. Andrewes iugleth in the citation of this place, not only dissembling the circumstances, and drift of the Author, but also nipping a word out of the short sentence which he cyteth.
            29. But notwithstanding all his iugling, it is euident (the whole place being considered) that it maketh nothing against our Prayer to Saynts, seeing that we do not make the Saynts Gods, as the Paynims made the Sunne, &amp; Moone, to whome they sacrificed, neyther do we hold, as the Paynims did, that a man cannot come immediatly to God by prayer, and deuotion, which we commonly vse to do, directing our prayers,The mediation as well of Christ himselfe, as of Saynts &amp; men for vs, is ouerthrowne by the place alledged by M. Andrews if he vnderstand it aright. as well mentall as vocall, to God himselfe, although we do also many tymes craue the help, and assistance, as well of men, as of Saynts, as a thing (though not of absolute necessity to saluation) yet very conuenient, behoouefull, and profitable thereto, which is no way contradicted by this place.
            30. For no man can with any reason imagine that the author of that Commentary denyed it to be lawfull, profitable, or needfull to haue a suffragatour, or mediatour to pray for vs, for so should he haue impugned a most knowne truth, which M. Andrews neyther will, nor can deny (I meane the mediation not only of Saynts for vs, and of one man for another (both which M. Andrews granteth) but also of the humanity

of Christ for vs all) for if we haue no need of eyther suffragatour, or mediatour to God, but only of a deuout mind, because he knoweth our harts, and thoughts; it followeth that when we doe deuoutly serue God our selues, we need not the prayer eyther of other men, or of Saynts, or yet of Christ himselfe and therefore let M. Andrews consider, whether he will admit this inference, which must needs be good, if he will inferre any thing vpon this place against prayer to Saynts.
            31. So as you see, he hath very impertinently alledged this testimony, to proue that S. Ambrose changed his mynd concerning Prayer to Saynts, for neyther is the Commentary,The trick of heretiks to seeke to ouerthrow plaine places by obscure. which he cyteth, an vndoubted worke of S. Ambrose (&amp; consequently the sentence which he alledgeth out of it, is not nota sententia, a knowne sentence of that holy Father, as he tearmeth it:) neyther is it any thing to the purpose though it be his, besides that we may note heere an ordinary trick of an heretyke, which is, to seeke to ouerthrow most euident and playne places, by others that are more obscure, and doubtfull, or subiect to diuers interpretations, for so doth he heere, opposing this obscure, and difficult place, to a testimony which is so cleare, that he is forced to reiect S. Ambrose, and make him no better then a blasphemous heretike for his doctrine therein, and yet you see also, that the place which he cyteth, being vnderstood secundum subiectam materiam, and according to the circumstances thereof, maketh nothing at all for him, or against vs, and this shall suffice for the former of the two places, and his euill fortune and folly in the allegation thereof.
            32. In the other sentence which he alledgeth to proue, that S. Ambrose changed his mynd touching

prayer to Saynts, he sheweth more fraud then folly
                  •
                The words are;Another place of S. Ambr. very fraudulently cited by M. Andrews and ridiculously applied to his purpose. 
               Tu solus Domine inuocandus es. Thou only, o Lord, art to be inuocated; whereupon he would inferre, that no Saynt may be inuocated, that is to say prayed vnto; but to omit that which I haue sufficiently treated before, concerning the word inuocation (whereon he so much relyeth) I desire thee good Reader, to note how he would cozen, and abuse thee in the allegation of this place. Thou shalt therefore vnderstand, that S. Ambrose in his funerall oration vpon the death of the Emperour Theodosius, hauing declared his great vertues,
                  See Chap. 6 nu. 2. &amp; 3. vseth indeed those words which M. Andrews cyteth, but whether to the same purpose that they are alledged, thou thy selfe shalt be iudge. Thus then he sayth:
                  S. Ambr. de obitu Theod.
                
               Conteror corde &amp;c. I am much afflicted in hart, because a man is taken from vs, whose like is hardly to be found; sed tu solus Domine inuocandus es, tu rogandus vt eum in filijs repraesentes; but thou alone, o Lord, art to be inuocated, thou to be prayed, that thou mayst represent him in his Children. Thus sayth S. Ambrose.
            
            33. And now will M. Andrews inferre vpon this, that S. Ambrose teacheth heere, that we may not pray to Saynts? did he not see trow you (if he saw the place in the author,
                  M. Andr. applyeth that to all things in generall which S. Ambrose speaketh of a particuler matter. and not in some corrupt note-booke, eyther of his owne, or his fellowes) that S. Ambrose speaketh heere of prayer for a particuler purpose, to wit, to obtayne the grace of God for the Emperours Children, to make them like their Father? and this S. Ambrose sayd with great reason was to be craued of God alone; for he alone, and none but he, can giue grace, and therefore he is only to be inuocated as the giuer of it, albeit the prayers both of Saynts, and men, may be craued to help to obtayne it of him; and I

thinke M. Andrews will not deny,Only God is to be inuocated, &amp; prayed vnto, as the giuer of grace, though the prayers of Saynts &amp; men may be craued to obteine it of him. but that S. Ambrose might very lawfully haue desired the people to pray to God to represent Theodosius in his Children, that is to say, to giue them grace that they might be lyke their father in vertue, and piety. So as it appeareth that solus inuocandus is no otherwyse vsed in this place of S. Ambrose, then as rogandus is, which presently followeth; and that both of them are to be referred to that which ensueth, to wit, vt eum in filijs repraesentes
               
                  •
                and finally that this place doth not exclude the crauing of prayers eyther of man, or of Saynts to obtayne grace of God, though it signify, that God only can giue grace and consequently is only to be inuocated to that end.
            34. And therefore I leaue it to thy iudgement,The weaknes of M Andrews his cause is further discouered, by another shift and cozenage of his good Reader, how sincere M. Andrews is in cyting the Fathers, whome he nippeth, and mangleth in this manner, to make them speake after his fasshion, and what a good cause he hath in hand, seeing he is forced to maintayne it with such fraud and falsehood, which may yet further appeare by the conclusion of his answere to the place obiected by the Cardinall out of S. Ambrose, wherein truly he sheweth himselfe no lesse fraudulent,
                  Andr. p. 45. §. Poterat.
                and impertinent, then before. Thus then he sayth. Etiam scriptus illi de oratione liber &amp;c. He (to wit Ambrose) also wrote a booke concerning prayer, wherein (albeit there was fit place or occasion to treate of this matter,
               A booke forged &amp; fathered vpon S. Ambrose which he neuer wrote. 
               yet) there is no mention at all of Saynts. So he
                  •
                which truly I must needs account for a fraud, &amp; abuse of his reader, vntill he tell me where this booke, which he mentioneth, is to be found; for I haue searcht for it diligently, as well in the Tome of S. Ambrose, as also in others that haue written particulerly

of his workes, and yet I can find no such booke, nor mention thereof any where.
            35. True it is that he treateth of prayer in many parts of his workes, not in any particuler treatise bearing that tytle, but obiter by the way vpon occasions offred eyther in the exposition of the Scriptures of the old and new Testament, or in his other treatises; as for example, in his bookes de Sacramentis, he writeth of the manner, &amp; place of prayer, of the order to be obserued therein, of the beginning, midst, and end of it, of the difference of postulation,S. Ambros. lib 1 de sacram. cap. 3.4. &amp; 5. Idem lib. 5. cap. 4. obsecration, and thanksgiuing, yea he expoundeth the whole Pater noster. And as it is true, that in these places there is no mention eyther of the prayers of Saynts for vs, or of our prayers to them: so also it is no lesse true, that there are many other things apperteyning to prayer, which are not so much as touched there, as (to speake of a thing of lyke nature and quality to the other) there is not any insinuation of our mutuall prayers one for another, albeit there are diuers places which may be supposed very fit, and conuenient for that purpose; neyther is there any mention there of prayer for our enemies, although S. Ambrose may seeme to haue had very iust occasion to speake thereof, when treating of prayer, he expoundeth this petition of the Pater Noster, Dimite nobis debita nostra &amp;c. Forgiue vs our trespasses, as we for giue them that trespasse agaynst vs.
            36. And now shall we say, that S. Ambrose held it to be eyther vnlawfull,M. Andrews hardly vrged by his owne argument. or needles to pray for our enemies? or to craue the prayers of our brethren, because he fayth nothing of those poynts in these places? or shall his silence heere preiudice his cleare doctrine els where, and be taken for a recantation of it, as

               M. Andrews would haue it to be supposed in this other case? What then will he say of a poynt which he himselfe alloweth concerning the intercession of Saynts, to wit, not only that they pray for vs, but also that we may pray to God to heare and help vs by their intercession, which he granteth to be lawfull, albeit there would be no mention of it in that booke of S. Ambrose de Oratione which he cyteth,
                  Andr. p. 45. § Poterat.
                if there were any such, for he himselfe confesseth, that there is no mention therein at all of Saynts; will he therefore allow vs to inferre herevpon, that S. Ambrose did not belieue eythere that Saynts do pray for vs, or that we may pray to God to be helped by their intercession? So should this supposed booke whereto he appealeth, condemne him no lesse in this poynt, then vs in the other.
            37. And if I would be so absurd to argue as he doth, I might as probably say, that S. Ambrose approueth prayer to Saynts,M. Andrews hi
                     •
                   absurd argument ab authoritat
                        •
                      negatiua, retorted against himselfe. because he doth not condemne it in his exposition of the Pater Noster, where the place seemed to inuite him to teach, that all prayer ought to be directed to God only, if he had byn of that opinion, and had not allowed prayer to Saynts, as to intercessours to God for vs: thus I say, I might argue with as much probability, as M. Andrewes doth, but that I am not ignorant (as neyther he, me thinks, should be) that such an argument ab authoritate negatiua (howsoeuer it may sometymes serue for a light or bare coniecture) yet can neuer passe for a proofe amongst learned men, especially to such purpose as he vrgeth it here, to wit to ouerthrow an authors expresse doctrine in one place, by his silence thereof in another; for who knoweth not that all authors haue certaine principall intentions in their workes and treatises, whereto specially

tendeth all their discours; and that they are not any way bound to handle other by-questions further then they thinke conuenient? wherein also euery one hath his reasons (though vnknowne to others) why he handleth one poynt, more then some other, which may perhaps seeme no lesse pertinent to his subiect then that which he handleth; neyther is he to be controlled or blamed for the same, if he performe as much as he eyther promiseth or specially intendeth. And therefore although S. Ambrose had written such a booke concerning prayer, as M. Andrews forgeth, yet his silence therein touching prayer to Saynts, could not preiudice his expresse doctrine thereof in his other workes.
            38. Well then to conclude cōcerning this poynt, I hope, good Reader, thou hast noted diuers thinges worthy to be considered; as first that M. Andrews hath not only reiected S. Ambrose his expresse testimony concerning the inuocation of Saynts, but also charged him with a most blasphemous doctrine,How many wayes M. Andrews hath abused S. Ambrose. which neuer any man els I dare say (except perhaps some other Sectary of this age) euer so much as suspected, or imagined in that holy Father. Secondly promising to proue by a knowne sentence of S. Ambrose, that he changed his mynd afterwards in that poynt, he alledgeth a worke, which in the opinion of diuers learned men was not written by S. Ambrose; besydes that the place which he produceth is nothing at all to the purpose, for the which he alledgeth it. Thirdly laying downe the true words of another place in a true worke of S. Ambrose, he hath fraudulently dissembled &amp; concealed that which immediatly followeth, and not only discouereth, but also ouerthroweth his false construction

thereof; and lastly he hath coyned a new worke of S. Ambrose, neuer heard of by any, but by himselfe, whereby also he could gayne nothing if there were any such. So as now I report me to thee, good Reader, whether he hath not quit himselfe well in the answere of the Cardinalls obiection out of S. Ambrose. Let vs then passe to another.M. Andrews answere to a place of Ruffinus examined. and confuted.
            
            39. The next place which he laboureth to answere is taken out of the history of Ruffinus, who saith of Theodosius the Emperour thus. Circuibat omnia orationum loca &amp;c. he went about to all places of prayer, and lay prostrate in hearcloth, and craued help for himselfe, by the faithfull intercession of Saynts. So he; declaring what meanes Theodosius vsed to obtayne the admirable victory which almighty God afterwards gaue him against Eugenius the Tyrant.
                  Ruffin. lib. 2. Hist. c. 33. Card. Apol. p. 10. To this M. Andrews answereth thus: Theodosius ibi sanctorum inuocator non est &amp;c.
               
                  Andr. p. 4.5. §. Locus.
                
               Theodosius is not there an inuocatour of Saynts, for it is one thing to craue help of Saynts, which is properly to inuocate them, and another to craue help of God by the intercession of Saynts, So he, giuing to vnderstand that Theodosius did not pray to Saynts, but to God, to heare him by the intercession of Saynts, which he signifieth afterwards more playnely, saying. Rogare autem Deum &amp;c. To beseech God to fauour vs at the request of Saynts, is not to pray to them,
               
                  Pag. 48. lin. 14. 
               or to inuocate them but God; hoc autem nec praeterea quid fecit ibi Theodosius, this, and nothing els did Theodosius there. Thus sayth M. Andrewes, who, as you see granteth that Theodosius prayed at the tombes of Martyrs, yea that he craued help of almighty God by the intercession of Saynts, but not that he prayed to the Saynts themselues.
            40. Neuertheles he may easily be cōuinced heerein,

if we consider what hath byn already proued by the testimonyes of those holy Fathers which haue hytherto byn produced; by the which it is euident that the common custome of Christians was at that tyme to pray to Saynts, and Martyrs, at their tombes, and monuments; and amongst the rest S. Chrysostome testifyeth expressely (as you haue heard) that the very Emperours themselues (of whome one was Theodosius) vsed to come to the monuments of Martyrs,
                  Supra chap. 6. and there to pray to them,
                  S. Chrysost. ho. 20. in ep. ad Corin.
                to the end that they might pray to God for them, and therefore I remit it to the iudgment of any indifferent man, whether it be credible that Theodosius being to craue Gods fauour, and assistance against the Tyrant Eugenius at the tombes of Martyrs, and by their intercession, did not also particulerly pray to them, as not only all Christians at that tyme, but also he, and other Emperours were wont to do in their necessityes; is it likely that he would do it at other tymes, and not then when he had most need?
            41. This is so improbable that M. Andrews had need to bring some more pregnant reasons to proue it then he doth, especially seeing it was commonly reported, as Zozomen witnesseth, that Theodosius going to encounter Eugenius,
               
                  Zozomen. lib. 7. cap. 24. passed by a Church which he had buylt in the honour of S. Iohn Baptist, and that 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , that is to say, he inuocated the Baptist to be his Assistant in the battayle?
               The Emperour Theodosius inuocated Saintes, &amp; namely S. Iohn Baptist. whereby it euidently appeareth, that Theodosius was held at that tyme to be an inuocatour of Saynts, and namely of S. Iohn Baptist, and that the same was generally approued in him, seeing it was reported amongst the people, and related by Sozomen, as one speciall

meanes which he vsed to obtayne the famous victory, that God gaue him presently after against his enemy; and therefore there is no doubt, but that when he craued help against the same enemy by the intercession of Martyrs at their tombes (as Ruffinus testifyeth in the place alledged by the Cardinall) he inuocated the Martyrs themselues; for I thinke no reason can be giuen why he should pray particulerly to S. Iohn Baptist, and not also to those Martyrs, seeing that the selfe same occasion, and oportunity of tyme, place, and necessity vrged him to both alyke
                  •
               
            
            42. But perhaps you will imagine that some potent reasons moued M. Andrewes to thinke that Theodosius did not inuocate the Martyrs, yea that it was not lawfull for him to do it.
                  Andr. p. 45. §. Locus.
                But truly his reason is no other, but because, we neyther are sure that the Saynts heare vs, nor haue any precept in Scripture to pray to them. Vtcumque,
               This is to giue checkmates to all the ancient Fathers at once, and was there not one of all these great Clerks that vnderstood the Scripture as well as this Mynister
                     •
                  
                sayth he, illi pro nobis intercedant &amp;c. Howsoeuer the Saynts pray for vs, yet except we may be sure that they heare vs, yea and though the same were manifest, yet except we haue some commandment of God for it, they are not to be inuocated by vs, albeit they pray for vs of their owne accord. So he; opposing this his friuolous conceipt against the sacred authority, as wel of the publike custome, and practise of the primitue Church, as of the beliefe of the ancient Fathers, testifying, and approuing the same; which might suffise to perswade any reasonable man, both that Saynts do heare vs, and also that they may be inuocated. For would the whole Church of God, euen then when it was notably furnished with learned, and holy pastors (which our aduersaries cannot deny) haue practised, or yet permitted the inuocation of Saynts, if eyther it were vnlawfull,

or els that the Saynts do not heare vs?
                  
                     •
                  . Tim. 3. So should the spouse of Christ,
               
                  Matth. 28. and the pillar of truth (whereto our Sauiour promised his owne continuall assistance) so should she, I say haue erred most perniciously, if it were not lawfull to pray to Saynts; and foolishly, if they did not heare vs; and therefore if there were no other argumēt or proofe thereof, but the practise of the whole Church, as well in those dayes as euer since, yet the same might suffice to conuince M. Andrews, and his fellowes in this poynt.
            
               It is proued by manifest experience that Saynts do heare our prayers, &amp; help vs.43. But what will he say to the vndoubted experience that men haue had in all tymes, and ages, and yet haue of the admirable, and most miraculous effects of petitions made to Saynts? do not the same most euidently proue both that the Saynts do heare vs, and that God himselfe approueth the vse, and custome of praying to them? I haue shewed this experience already in the age whereof we now speake, by the testimonyes of Saynt Basil,
               
                  See Chap. 6. and Saynt Gregory Nazianzen, witnessing the notable effects of prayers to the 40
                  •
                Martyrs, Saynt Mammas, and the blessed Virgine Mary, whereto I might add diuers others of the same age, and all other ages ensuing vntill this day; but to auoyde prolixity (and because I hold it needeles to multiply witnesses, in a matter so manifest as this) I will content my selfe with only one euident testimony of Theodoret, who liued in the same age that diuers of those other fathers did, whome the Cardinall alledgeth; for he was Bishop of Sirus in S. Augustines tyme before the third Generall Councell, of Ephesus, though he was yonger then any of the rest, &amp; liued many yeares after them, to wit vntill the 4. Generall Coūcell where he was present
                  •
                So as two of the 4. first Generall Coūcells

were held in his dayes, and whyles he was Bishop.
            44. This ancient Father writing against the Gentils of his tyme, and prouing by many euident arguments that Christ is God, vrgeth notably the great honour generally exhibited in those dayes to Martyrs, in the sumptuous, and magnificent Churches that were then dedicated vnto them,
                  Theodor
                        •
                      de Graec. affect. curan. lib. 8. whereof he sayth thus: 
                  Neque verò ad haec per annum semel, aut bis &amp;c.
We do not vse to come to these only once, or twyce, or fiue tymes in the yeare, but we do often celebrate festiuall dayes in them; we do often euery day sing hymnes, and prayses to the Lord of those Martyrs; and men that are in health do pray to be conserued in it, and those that are sicke do craue health; also barren women and men do desire to haue children, and those that are already Fathers do seeke to haue their Children conserued: also trauaylers 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . 
                  do craue the Martyrs to be their companions in their way, and guydes of their iourney; and those that are safely returned, giue thankes, confessing the benefit receiued, 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , 
                  not comming to them, as to Gods, but praying to them as to diuine men, and beseeching them to be intercessors for them; and that they do obtayne those things which they piously, and faithfully craue, it is testifyed by the gifts, that are offered by such as haue made vowes, which are manifest tokens that they haue obtayned their desired health; for some do hang vp figures (or representations) of eyes, some of feete, some of hands, all made of siluer, or gould; and their Lord doth gratfully accept what gift soeuer is giuen, and disdayneth none, though neuer so small and meane, measuring them according to the ability of the giuer. Therefore those gifts being set forth to the publike view of all men, are most euident

signes, and testimonyes, that those which giue them are freed from their diseases, and haue recouered their health. These I say do shew what is the vertue or power of the Martyrs, and the power, and vertue of the Martyrs doth declare, that he whome they haue worshipped and serued, is true God. Thus sayth Theodoret.
            
            
               The ancient custome of the primitiue Church to hang vp votiue representations of hands, feet eyes, and such like in Churches, to testify the recouery of bodily health by the intercession of Saynts.45. And can any man desire more cleare, and manifest testimony, eyther that the generall custome of the Church was to pray to Saynts in his tyme, or that God approued it with miraculous effects? Yea, and that the same was held for a speciall argument to proue that Christ was God? Wherein also it is to be obserued, that the vse was in that age (aboue eleuen hundred yeares agoe) to hang vp votiue Images and representations of hands, feete, eyes, and such like, to testify the miraculous recouery of bodily health by the intercession of Saynts, which therefore is no moderne custome of these later ages (as our aduersaryes falsely affirme it to be) but an ancient practice of the primitiue Church. Whereupon it also followeth not only that prayer to Saynts is most lawfull, and honorable to almighty God, and profitable to men, but also that Saynts heare the prayers that are made vnto them, seeing that they obtayne the grant thereof, and giue succour to their suppliants. What account then is to be made of the cauilling, and trifling doubt that M. Andrews maketh, whether they heare vs, or no? Especially seeing he groundeth the same vpon no better reason, then partly because some of the ancient Fathers were of opinion that the Saynts shall not haue the perfect vision of God, before the day of Iudgment (and consequently that they do not see

in him what is done on earth) and partly also for that S. Augustine teacheth,
                  Andr. p. 40. lin. 5. that the dead are not present at the affayres of men. Whereupon he concludeth; Quòd sinec ipsi intersint (vt Augustinus) &amp;c. if the Saynts are neyther present heere themselues,
               A very simple discourse of M. Andrews. 
               as Augustin affirmeth, neyther yet do see any thing in the glasse (he meaneth the Essence of God) as almost all the other Fathers affirme, they cannot know our desires; for how should they know them, seeing that they neyther can see things in the glasse, nor yet in themselues. So he; arguing more simply then I could haue imagined of so great a Doctor, if I had not seene it.
            46. For put the case that all this which he saith,How Saynts may vnderstand and know our prayers and actions. were infallibly true (I meane that the Saynts neyther haue as yet the full visiō of God, neyther are at any time present heere amongst men) is there no otherway for them to know our actions, or vnderstand our petitiōs? how did Elizaeus the Prophet know that his seruant Giezi tooke gifts of Naman Syrus, when neuertheles he neyther had the vision of God,4. Reg. c. 5. nor yet was present with Giezi when he receiued the gifts? And how do Prophets vnderstand things to come, or done in remote places? Will M. Andrews say, that they haue no knowledge thereof, because they neyther see God, nor are present at the actions, nor in the places whereof they speake? This I thinke he wil be ashamed to say; &amp; therefore he must needs confesse that his inference is very vayne, &amp; idle, when he argueth that the Saynts do not vnderstand our prayers, because they do not see God, nor are present with vs. And this he might haue learned of S. Augustine, euen in that place which he cyteth, to proue that the dead are not present at our affayres.
            47. For euen there (I meane in his booke de cura

pro mortuis) he declareth,S. Aug. l. de cura pro mort. c. 12. that albeit the dead do not naturally know what passeth in earth, neyther are ordinarily conuersant with vs, yet they may know our actions,
                  Ibid. ca. 15. See Chap. 9. nu. 42.43. &amp; 44. S. Aug. lib. 2. de Ciuit. Dei cap. 9. as well by the relation of Angels, as by diuine reuelation, yea, and that they may be present with vs, and helpe vs per diuinam potentiam, by diuine power, as shall further appeare in the ninth Chapter, where I shall haue somewhat more to say to M. Andrewes concerning his grosse, and shamefull abuse both of the Cardinall,
                  Lact. li. 7. cap. 21. and S. Augustine touching this place. Therfore whereas he also alledgeth S. Augustine, Lactantius, and S. Bernard to proue that the soules of the iust are reserued in certayne receptacles,
               
                  Bern. ser. 3. de omnib. Sanct.
                and secret places, where they haue not the perfect vision of God vntill the day of iudgement, I shall not need to say any thing thereto, as well because it would auayle him nothing, as you see, though S. Augustine and all the rest of the Fathers had ben of that opinion, seeing that euen there (I meane in those receptacles) the Saynts might know our prayers by Ang

Augustine, but also all the Fathers both Greeke and Latin (except 3. to wit, Tertullian, Lactantius, and Victorinus) do teach, that the Saynts do already enioy the visiō of God, though not in that perfection, and consummation of their beatitude, which they shall haue after the resurection, and glorification of the bodyes, as M. Andrews may see, if it please him in the controuersy of Cardinall Bellarmine, who alledgeth to this purpose 36. Fathers of the Greeke,

            48. And whereas he sayth also by the way that the Saynts ought not to be inuocated, albeit they could heare vs, because there is no precept of it, I forbeare to giue any full satisfaction to that scruple in this place, because he doth not heere yield any reason, or produce any authority to proue, that nothing is to be done wihout an expresse precept, though in another place he alledgeth a text of Scripture to that end, whereof I shall haue further occasion to speake after a whyle, and therefore I remit the full answere thereof vntill then, and only in the meane tyme I will say to him with S. Augustine,

            49. So he;
                  Idem. ep. 118. who also in another place speaking of certayne traditions of the Church, sayth: Si quid horum tota p
                     •

               The force and validity of Ecclesiasticall customes. 
               or vse any of these things, it is a most insolent madnes to dispute whether it be to be done, or no. Thus saith S. Augustine, cōcluding M. Andrews to be a most insolent madde man, who calleth in question a generall custome of the Church:
                  S. Hiero. contra Lucifer. c
                        •

                     •
                  
                to which purpose S. Hierome also saith to the Luciferians, that albeit there were no authority of Scripture for the matter in question betwyxt them, yet, totius orbis in hanc partem consensus instar praecepti obtineret, the consēt of the whole world in this behalfe were as much as a precept. And the lyke sayth Tertullian; Hanc si nulla,
               
sayth he,
                  Tertul. de corona. mil. cap. 3. 
               Scriptura determinauit &amp;c. if no Scripture hath determined this, yet truly custome, which without doubt, hath flowed from tradition, hath corroborated, and strengthned it.
            
            50. To these Fathers I might add many more to the same purpose, if it were needefull, but these may suffice for the present, to shew that M. Andrews doth very idly exact a precept for prayer to Saynts, when it is euident by the testimony of all the Fathers before cyted, that the same was generally practised in the Church in their tyme, no lesse then it is at this present: whereupon I also conclude concerning the fact of Theodosius the Emperour,
                  See supra nu. 41. Sozom. bist. lib. 7. cap. 24. S. Chryso. ho. 26. in ep. ad Corinth.
                that it cannot be with reason denyed, but that when he lay prostrate before the tombes of the Martyrs, crauing helpe agaynst Eugenius the Tyrant by their intercession, he prayed also to them, and not only to God, especially considering the testimonyes produced by me before out of Sozomen concerning his particuler inuocation of S. Iohn Baptist vpon the same occasion, and out of S. Chrysostome, testifying the Emperours custome in those dayes to pray to the Martyrs at their monuments; wherein also, it may well be presumed, that S. Chrysostome had a speciall relation euen to that fact of Theodosius whereof we now treate, because the same was then very famous when he wrote his cōmentary vpon S. Paules Epistles, whence this testimony is taken; for he wrote the same, whyle he was Bishop, as it may appeare by the tyme of his election, and of a vision of S. Paul who was seene to assist him whiles he interpreted those Epistles,

               51. Next after this followeth a place of S. Paulinus,

                inuocating S. Clarus in these words: Haec peccatorum &amp;c. Receiue these prayers of sinners, who do beseech thee to be mindfull of Paulinus, and Therasia. And now because Paulinus wrote in verse, M. Andrews will haue it to be vnderstood that he did but play, or dally lyke a Poet.The testimony of S. Paulin for the inuocatiō of Saynts defended against M. Andrews. But to this I answere, that if S. Paulinus was a Poet, he was a Christian, yea a holy Poet, and therefore would not vse any Poeticall licence to the derogation of the Christian fayth, or Religion, or that might any way seeme iniurious to Christ (as M. Andrews, and his fellowes do account the inuocation of Saynts to be:) besides that, it is manyfest that he did no otherwise in verse, then the other Fathers afore mentioned did in prose,
                  See before nu. 6. and was warranted, as you haue seene by the custome, and practice of the whole Church at that tyme:

            52. Finally he concludeth his censure with S. Augustine, whome the Cardinall alledgeth thus: Habet Ecclesiastica disciplina &amp;c.
               M. Andrews his answere to a place of S. Augustine examined and confuted. 
               The Ecclesiasticall discipline hath that which the faythfull know, who make mention of Martyrs at the Altar of God, not to pray for them there, as for others that are dead, for it is an iniury to pray for a Martyr, to whose prayers we ought to be recommended: Thus sayth S. Augustine. To this M. Andrewes answereth, that the Cardinall shall neuer be able to make Augustin on his side,
                  Andr. p. 46. §. At. A most vayne and ridiculous brag of M. Andrews. or not to be for the Protestants, and that whatsoeuer is cyted ex aliquo riuulo Augustini, out of some litle booke of Augustine; the same is dryed vp with one only sentence, as with the sunne: and this sentence, he saith, is in opere suo palmari, in his principall worke de Ciuitate Dei. Well then let vs see the splendour of

this radiant sentence, and try what heate or force it hath to dry vp the other testimonyes cyted out of S. Augustine for prayer to Saynts.
            
               
                  S Aug. de ciuit. Dei l. 22

                  ca. 10.53. The words which M. Andrews alleadgeth out of S. Augustine are these: Ad quod Sacrificium Martyres &amp;c. At which Sacrifyce (S. Augustine meanes the Sacrifice of the Masse) the Martyrs are named in their place, and order, as the men of God (who haue ouercome the world in the confession of him) but yet they are not inuocated by the Priest which sacrificeth. Thus far M. Andrews cyteth S. Augutine, and then addeth: Non inuocantur Martyres &amp;c. Augustine hath these very words, the Martyrs are not inuocated by the Priest; and why lesse by the Priest, then by the people? And that which is not lawfull in Sacrifice, why is it lawfull out of Sacrifice? And that which is not to be done at Masse,
               A childish discourse of M. Andrews cō
                  tayning three foolish demaunds. 
               why may it be done at Mattins? And is there any force in the Sacrifice or Altar to make that vnlawfull, which is otherwyse lawfull? Thus M. Andrews discourseth to proue that S. Augustine is not ours, but wholy his in this controuersy.
            54. Thereof let vs see how well he hath performed it, and for as much as he insisteth most vpon the word inuocantur, because S. Augustine sayth,Touching the inuocation which S. Augustine sayth is due to God alone that the Martyrs are not inuocated by the Priest, it is specially to be considered in what sense S. Augustine vseth that word in this place; for seeing that it is applyed sometymes to God alone, and sometymes to creatures (as I haue shewed before, as well out of the holy Scripture, as by the testimony of S. Augustine himselfe) it is euident, 
                  Chap. 6. nu. 2. &amp; seq.
               that if it be vsed heere in the former sense only (I meane for an inuocation of God including a diuine honour) it doth no way constradict the inuocation of Saynts in our sense, signifying only a request of their

help by their prayers, which, as I haue shewed, M. Andrews himselfe acknowledgeth to be the proper signification of inuocare.
               
                  Ibid.
                It is therefore to be vnderstood that S. Augustine in this place vseth it only for an inuocation by Sacrifice, which is so proper to God alone, that it cannot be applyed to Saynts, or any pure creature.
            55. This wilbe most manifest,The true sense of S. Augustin
                     •
                   declared. if we consider the circumstances of the text, and the drift of S. Augustine, who meaning to shew that the honour which we Christians do to Martyrs, redoundeth specially to God, signifyeth, that albeit God doth worke greate miracles by them, yet we do not hold them for Gods, neyther buyld temples to them as to Gods, nor erect Altars to Sacrifice to them; sed vni Deo, &amp; Martyrum, &amp; nostro Sacrificium immolamus, but we offer Sacrifice to one God, who is as well the God of the Martyrs, as ours; at which Sacrifice (sayth he) they are named as the seruants of God, non tamen à Sacerdote qui sacrificat inuocantur, yet they are not inuocated by the Priest which sacrificeth; and then to shew euidently that he includeth the oblation of Sacrifice in the inuocation whereof he speaketh, he addeth presently: Deo quippe non ipsis sacrificat &amp;c. for he sacrificeth to God, and not to them, though he sacrificeth in the honour of them,
               The inuocation wherof S. Augustin speaketh is proper
                     •
                   to Priestly functiō, and not to be vsed but in Sacrifice. 
               because he is Gods Priest, and not theirs. Thus saith S. Augustine, immediatly after the word inuocantur.
            
            56. Whereby he giueth to vnderstand that the inuocation whereof he speaketh is proper to Priestly function, and therefore to be exhibited by the Priest to God only (whole Priest he is) and not to the Martyrs; as who would say, because the Priest is Gods Priest, and ought to sacrifice to God alone, therefore

he only nameth the Martyrs in his Sacrifice, and doth not inuocate them, that is to say, he doth not inuocate them with Sacrifice, which is proper to the office, or function of a Priest,S. Augustine doth no way impugne the inuocation of Saynts in the place alledged by M. Andrews. for otherwyse (I meane if S. Augustine did not take inuocation in this place for a Priestly, or Sacrificall action) his reason why the Priest doth not inuocate the Martyrs (to wit, because he is the Priest of God, and sacrificeth to him alone) were to no purpose; which no doubt M. Andrews saw well ynough, and therefore he ended his citation at inuocā
                  tur, without adding that which immediatly followeth, and sheweth what S. Augustine meaneth there by inuocation.
            
            57. Now then what wonder it is that S. Augustine saith, that Martyrs are not to be inuocated in this manner, that is to say, with Sacrifice which is offred to God alone? Doth any man doubt of it? Or doth it any way impugne the inuocation of Saynts by prayer? how idle then are M. Andrews his questions, to wit, why the Priest may not inuocate Martyrs, as well as the people may? and why not at Masse, as well as at Mattins? and whether there be any force in the Sacrifice or Altar,M. Andrews doth seeme to confound the Priest with the people Masse with Mattins, and the Aultar with euery other place. to make that vnlawfull which otherwyse is lawfull? whereby he seemeth to confound the Priest with the people, Masse with Mattins, and the Altar with euery other place, supposing that whatsoeuer is prohibited to the Priest, is also forbidden to the people, and what cannot be done at Masse, is not to be done at Mattins: and finally that whatsoeuer is vnlawfull at the Altar, is lawfull no where els, which is most absurd, seeing that many things are lawfull, or vnlawfull according to the different state, and quality of persons, matters, tyme, and place.
            
               58. For who knoweth not that to inuocate God with Sacrifice, is the proper function of the Priest, and not of the people, and that the same is done at Masse, and not at Mattins, and no where els but at the Altar, yea and that the Priest may highly offend God in his Sacrifice, that is to say at Masse, or at the Altar, when the people offende no way at all: and therefore to satisfy M. Andrews his three demaunds according to S. Augustines meaning in this place, he is to vnderstand that the Priest may inuocate God with Sacrifice,Three foolish demands of M. Andrews answered, according to S Augustins meaning. and the people cannot, that the same is to be done at Masse, and not at Mattins, and that such inuocation is not lawfully done any where, but at the Altar, and that it is so due to God alone, that it can neuer be applyed to Saynts, eyther by people, or Priest, at Mattins, or Masse, at the Altar, or yet elswhere; and so shall he vnderstand that the place which he alledgeth maketh nothing agaynst prayer to Saynts, and that his vayne demands haue serued to no other purpose but to shew his ignorance and folly.
            59. This will yet further appeare by his conclusion, wherein he taketh vpon him to expound the other place of S. Augustine, which you haue heard cyted by the Cardinall, to wit, Iniuria est &amp;c. It is iniury to pray for a Martyr, to whose prayers we ought to be recommended: whereto M. Andrews hauing opposed,M. Andrews his extrauagant and foolish glosse, vpō S Augustins place obiected by the Cardinall. and vaynely vrged this other place in such sort, as you haue heard, answereth in conclusion thus: Quare apud illum &amp;c. Wherefore, that we should be recomended to the prayers of Martyrs, is not to inuocate them; but to wish to be recommended to the intercession of Christ the head, and of all his mysticall body, and we do call vpon Christ, that he may heare vs, and not vpon the Saynts that they may

heare vs, but this we craue of God, that they may be heard for vs of him, and with him. Thus doth M. Andrews glosse that text.
            60. So as to be recommended to the prayer of a Martyr, is to wish to be recommended to the intercession of Christ, and of all his mistycall body; as if a man should say, that for a man to be recommended to the prayers of M. Andrews, is not to craue the help of his prayers in particuler, but to wish that the Kings Maiesty (being head of the English Church) and all English Protestants, may pray for him. For truly he may say the one as well as the other, especially seeing that he giueth no reason at all of this his extrauagant interpretation, but relyeth wholy vpon his owne peruerse, and false vnderstanding of the other place of S. Augustine, which he will needs suppose to exclude all inuocation of Saynts, though, as you haue seene, it doth not concerne the same any way at all.
            61. But to put the matter out of doubt what S. Augustine meant in this place, when he sayd, that we ought to be recommended to the prayer of the Martyr, we are to consider what his expresse doctrine is els where concerning the same poynt, namely in his Treatise de cura pro mortuis, of the care to be had of the dead, which albeit M. Andrews will not (as I thinke) allow for opus palmare, S. Augustines principall worke (because he hath already giuen that tytle to the bookes de Ciuitate Dei) yet it cannot be denied to be S. Augustines,
               S. Augustines expresse doctrine concerning the inuocation of Saynts. who doth himselfe acknowledge it for such in his Retractions. This learned holy Father treating of the good that the dead may receiue by the care of their friends to bury their bodyes neere to the monuments of Saynts, sayth thus:
            
               62. 
                  Sed cum talia viuorum solatia requi

So he. And a little after he sayth further to the same purpose: Cùm it aque recolit animus &amp;c. Therefore when the mynd of a man remembreth where his friends body is buried, and some place also which is venerable by the name of some Martyr occurreth to his remembrance, eidem Martyri animam dilectam commendat recordantis, &amp; precantis affectus; the affection of him that remembreth it and prayeth, doth recommend the soule of his friend, to the same Martyr.
                Thus sayth S. Augustine, teaching expressely not only prayer to Saynts, but also prayer for the dead (which I wish M. Andrewes to note by the way) as also that the prayer whereof S. Augustine speaketh heere, cannot be sayd to be made generally to Christ, and to all his mysticall body (according to M. Andrews his former glosse) but particulerly eisdem Sanctis tamquam patronis, to the same Saynts, as to their patrons, and eidem Martyri, to the same Martyr, by whose tombe the bodyes of the dead are buryed.
            63. But perhaps M. Andrews will say that this is taken ex aliquo riuulo Augustini, out of some litle brooke of Augustine, and not ex opere suo palmari, out of

his principall worke de Ciuitate Dei. Well then, let vs see whether we can find any thing there to this purpose. I doubt not but that M. Andrews (who highly esteemeth that most excellent worke, and therefore seemeth to haue read it diligently) will easily call to mind what a number of notable,A notable miracle recounted by S. Augustine. and manifest miracles S. Augustine relateth there, as knowne to himselfe to haue byn done at the memoryes of S. Steuen and diuers other Martyrs, &amp; that amongst the rest he recounteth one which happened to an honest poore old man of Hippo,
               
                  S. Aug. de ciuit. Dei lib. 22. c. 8. called Florentius, who hauing lost his cloke, and not hauing money wherewith to buy another, went to the monument of the Twenty Martyrs (which was there very famous) and clara voce, sayth he, vt vestiretur orauit, prayed with a lowd voyce, that he might haue wherewith to cloth himselfe.
            64. Wherupon certayne scoffing yong men, for (so S. Augustine calleth them) being by chance present, and hauing heard him, followed him at his departure, and mocked him, quasi à Martyribus quinquagenos folles, vnde vestimentum emeret, petiuisset, as though he had demanded of the Martyrs fifty peeces of money (called folles) wherewith he might buy him clothes. But he not regarding them went towards the sea side, and there saw a great fish panting vpon the shore, which, with their help (who had followed him thither) he tooke, and sold for three hundred folles to a Christian Cooke called C
                     •
                  rt
                     •
                  sus (declaring vnto him all that had hapned) who opening the fish, found in his belly a ring of gold, and being moued partly with commiseration, and partly with scruple, gaue it also to the poore man, saying vnto him, Ecce quomodo viginti Martyres te vestierunt: Behold how the

20. Martyrs haue clothed thee. Thus much relateth S. Augustine concerning this matter.
            65. Whereby it euidently appeareth,An inference vpō the miracle related by S. Augustine. first, that this poore man prayed not only at the monument of those Martyrs, but also to the Martyrs themselues, crauing of them reliefe of his necessity; for there vpon the yong men, who heard his prayer, tooke occasion to charge him to haue craued 50. folles of the Martyrs, which they would not haue done if they had not heard him pray vnto the Martyrs; &amp; thereto also alluded the Cooke, who hauing heard the story related, and vnderstood thereby, to whome, and for what he had prayed, sayd vnto him, Behold how the Martyrs haue clothed thee, as who would say, the Martyrs of whome thou crauedst to be clothed, haue heard thy prayer, and giuen thee wherewith to cloth thee.
            66. Secondly it appeareth that it was the custome at that tyme to inuocate Saynts particulerly, and that God approued it by this miraculous effect. And if M. Andrews do say, that if it had byn vsuall, these yong men who heard him, would not haue mocked him for doing it, he is to vnderstand, that they did not mock him for calling vpon the Martyrs, but because his request seemed to them extrauagant, quasi qui à Martyribus quinquagenos folles petiuisset, as though he had demanded 50. folles to buy him clothes. Besids that, Saynt Augustine so much condemned them for deryding him, that he calleth them adolescentes irrisores, scoffing yong men, yea and God so disposed for their confusion, that they themselues were witnesses of the miraculous euent, and helped him to take the fish which he sold for 300. folles, besids the ring that was found in his belly.
            
               97. Thirdly it is cleare, that S. Augustine highly approued the inuocation of the 20. Martyrs, seeing that he recoūteth this togeather with many other miracles, to proue the truth of the Christian faith, saying in the end for the conclusion of the whole: Cui nisi huic fidei attesta
                     •
                  tur ista miracula &amp;c. To what other faith doe these miracles giue testimony
                     •
                   but to this, whereby Christ is preached to haue ascended into heauen with his flesh? for these Martyrs, were Martyrs (that is to say witnesses) of this faith &amp;c. For in this faith they dyed, who can obtayne these things of God, for whose name they were slayne. So he.
            68. Now then, that which I wish thee, good Reader, to note in all this discourse,The conclusion of this Chapter, touching the vanity of M. Andrews &amp; the conformity of S. Augustine with the other Fathers alledged by the Cardinall for prayer to Saynts. is, how well M. Andrews hath performed his vaunt, which was that he would with one only sentence, as with the sunne, dry vp, whatsoeuer could be obiected out of any litle brooke of Augustine, when neuertheles his hoat sunny sentēce hath proued no warmer, nor brighter then the moone in the wayne, and change, which hath neyther heate nor light, for so you see it hath fallen out with the place cyted by him out of S. Augustine, which proueth nothing at all for his purpose, whereas the other testimonyes alledged partly by the Cardinall, and partly by me, are (as you haue also seen) most euident, and pregnant, to proue the inuocation of Saynts, which M. Andrews hath hitherto impugned.
            69. If then we consider the conformity of S. Augustine in this point withall the other Fathers, whose places haue byn before produced to wit S. Basil, Eusebius, S. Chrysostome, S. Ephrem, S. Maximus, S. Gregory Nazianzen, S. Gregory Nyssen, S. Ambrose, S. Hierome, Ruffinus, S. Paulinus, and Theodoret, I doubt not

but that their consent, and vniforme testimony may suffice in the opinion of any reasonable man, to shew that the vniuersall custome, practise, and faith of the Church in their age, was the same that now is concerning the Inuocation of Saynts, notwithstanding all the wrangling, trifling, shifts, euasions, collusions, and frauds, which you see M. Andrews hath vsed to obscure the euident, and manifest verity thereof: so as I might heere very well end this matter, were it not that M. Andrews in the preamble to his censure vpon the places of the Fathers, maketh some obiections, not hitherto answered by me, which by all likelyhood not only he, but also those that haue read him, will expect should be some way satisfyed, and therefore I meane to examine the validity thereof, with what breuity I conueniently may.
         
         
            
            CERTAYNE OBIECTIONS OF M. ANDREWS AGAINST PRAYERS TO SAYNTS ARE ANSWERED: AND by the way, an Imposture of the pretended Bishops and Clergy of the Prouince of Canterbury in a Synodicall Canon of theirs is discouered. AND Finally, M. Andrews is proued to haue notably wrangled, iuggled, and tryfled throughout this whole Controuersy.
            CHAP. VIII.
            
               AMONGST diuers friuolous obiections there is one especially, which, as it seemeth, he maketh his Achilles, and holdeth for inuincible, and therfore he tryumpheth not a little, before he produceth it,
                  Andr. p. 39. §. Neque.
                saying, that he will not obiect to the Cardinall some acclamation, or

vow proceeding from some mans impetuous or violet affection,M. Andrews cō
                  fidence in the Canon of the Coūcell of Laodicea. but a Canon, and a statute of a Councell held at Laodicea about the same tyme, and published by the vniforme consent of the Fathers, quod leges, sayth he,

                  bis à Thedoret relatum &amp;c. which (Statute) thou shalt read twice related by Theodoret in his Commentary vpon the 2. and 3. Chapter to the Colossenses. They do there forbid in expresse words, ne quis precetur Angelos, that no man pray to Angels (and the reason touching Saynts is all one) because some men did then giue counsaile, &amp; thought it necessary to procure the fauour of God by Angels. Thus sayth M. Andrews, vsing no lesse fraude then he is wont, as well touching Theodoret, as the Canon of the Councell of Laodicea.
            
            2. And first for Theodoret,
               Theodoret notably abused by M Andrews. he abuseth him notably, alledging some part of his words, and leauing out that which would clearely explicate the whole matter, and Theodorets meaning, who interpreting the place of S. Paul to the Colossenses (Nemo vos seducat, volens in humilitate &amp; religione Angelorum,
               
                  Coloss. 2. let no man seduce you, willing in the humility, and religion of Angels) declareth that certayne heretykes in Phrygia and Pisidia defending the vse of the old law,
                  Theodoret. in c.

                  . ep ad Coloss

                     n.
                induced men to the worship of Angels; and after a whyle layeth downe the reason, which they vsed to that end, saying; Illi ergo consulebant &amp;c. therefore they counselled this vnder pretence of humility, saying that men cannot see, nor comprehend Almighty God, nor come vnto him, and that they must procure to themselues Gods fauour by Angels. Thus sayth Theodoret, whereof you see M. Andrewes layeth downe only the last words, to wit, putabant oportere sibi diuinam beneuolentiam conciliare &amp;c.

They thought they must procure to themselues the diuine fauour by Angels; whereas the words immediatly going before, which he leaueth out, gaue the reason of this their errour, signifying that they thought it necessary to procure Gods fauour by Angels, because men could not come to him otherwyse, which is farre from the conceipt of any Catholyke, or Christian man, seing that this opinion denyeth that we may come to God by Christ, and maketh Angels the only mediatours betwyxt God and vs, which is in effect to deny, and destroy the Christian faith.
            3. And therefore no meruaile if Saynt Paul, the Councell of Laodicea, and Theodoret forbad such prayer to Angels; but the truth is that the Canon which Theodoret mentioneth forbiddeth only to commit Idolatry to Angels, and not simply to pray to them, as I will make it manifest, when I shall haue first declared how M. Andrews hath abused the Councell of Laodicea.
               M. Andrews abuseth the Coūcell of Laodicea. Therefore hauing sayd that the Canon of that Councell is twyce related by Theodoret in his Cōment vpon the second, and thyrd to the Colossenses, he addeth; Prohibent ibi disertis verbis, ne quis precetur Angelos; the Fathers of that Councell do there forbid in expresse words,
                  Andr. p. 39. §. Neque.
                that no man pray to Angels. So he. Whereby the Reader must needs imagin not only that the Canō of the Councell was fully layd downe by Theodoret, but also that the same was to no other effect,The Coū
                  cell of Laodicea forbiddeth Idolatry to Angels &amp; not prayer 
                     •
                  o them. but only to ordayne that no man should pray to Angels; wheras Theodoret doth not alledge any one word of the Canon, but toucheth only the effect of it in some sort and in very generall tearmes, for the Canon it selfe maketh no mention at all of prayer, but forbiddeth only an Idolatrous worship of Angels; which also Theodoret
               
sheweth to be his owne meaning, though he speake only of prayer to Angels, as it is euident both by the circumstances of the place layd downe by me before, and left out by M. Andrews, and also more playnely afterwards when he speaketh of the sayd Councell, and Canon the second tyme, in one of the two places which M. Andrews himselfe quoteth, to wit, vpon the thyrd Chapter to the Colossenses, where he sayth thus.
            4. Quòd enim illi Angelos iubebant adorare &amp;c. For because those Phrygians commanded men to adore Angels, he (to wit S. Paul) commanded the contrary,
               
                  Theodor
                        •
                     t. in 3. Coloss.
                
               that they should adorne both their words, and deeds with the remembrance of Christ our Lord.
               Theodoret his meaning cleerly explicated by his owne words. 
               Vtter forth (saith the Apostle) your thanks giuing to God the Father by him, and not by Angels. And the Synod of Laodicea following this law, and seeking to remedy the old disease, decreed, that men should not pray to Angels, and leaue our Lord Iesus Christ. Thus saith Theodoret: whereby he sheweth that those Phrygian Idolatours made a playne oppositiō of Angels to Christ, teaching &amp; cōmāding an adoratiō
                of Angels insteed of Christ, &amp; therefore he sayth that the Apostle cōmanded the contrary to them, to wit, that we should prayse God by Christ, and not by Angels; whereby it appeareth that their contrary doctrine was to prayse God by Angels, and not by Christ; which he also confirmeth saying,Theodoret forbiddeth such prayer to Angels as excludeth the mediation of Christ. that the Councell of Laodicea made the lyke Decree agaynst the same errour, ordayning that none should pray to Angels, and leaue Christ. So as by all this it is manifest, that according to Theodoret, the adoration, and prayer to Angels forbidden by S. Paul, and the Councell, was such as excluded the mediation of Christ for vs, and made the Angels our only mediatours

whereof neuertheles you do not see so much as any insinuation, or ynkling in M. Andrews, whereby it is euident, that he hath abused both the Councell, and Theodoret, and his Reader most of all.
            5. This will appeare more clearely by the expresse words of the Canon whereof Theodoret speaketh, which are these: Quòd non oporteat Christianos relicta Dei Ecclesia obire &amp;c.
               
                  Concil. Laodic. cap. 35. 
               That Christians ought not to forsake the Church of God, and to goe away, and to make Congregations of abominable Idolatry to Angels, which is forbidden, and therefore whosoeuer shallbe found,
               The meaning of the Canon of the Coūcell of Laodicea. 
               huic occultae Idololatriae vacans, exercising this hidden, or secret Idolatry, be he accursed, for that he hath forsaken our Lord Iesus Christ, and gone to Idols. Thus sayth the Canon, shewing euidently, that the adoration, and prayer to Angels, which Theodoret sayth was forbidden by the Canon,What kind of Idolatry was done to Angels by the Phrygians was some abominable Idolatry committed to Angels in certayne secret Congregations, which those Phrygians made in corners, forsaking the Church of God, and Christ himselfe. And this I say is euident by the Canon; for no man I thinke can be so simple to imagine that all this could be sayd, or meant of prayer to Angels, in such sort as we Catholykes vse the same, that is to craue the assistance of their prayers to Christ for vs, or to God by the merits, and mediation of Christ.
            6. For if this were the abominable Idolatry whereof the Councell speaketh, then should the Apostle haue byn an abominable Idolatour, when he desired the Romans, Corinthians, Thessalonians, and others to pray for him:
                  Rom. 15. and so should we in lyke manner when we desire one anothers prayers,1. Cor. 1. for no sufficient,

to pray to Angels,

               blesse these childrē. And Iosue fell downe prostrate before an Angell, and called him Dominum suum, his Lord. Besids that the Apostle, yea our Sauiour himselfe testifyeth, not only the continuall presence of Angels amongst vs, but also the assistance, and help that we receiue by them: in so much that the ancient Fathers (and amongst the rest Theodoret himselfe) do thereupon teach expressely that we haue euery one of vs from our natiuity a proper Angell, who protecteth, and defendeth vs, and prayeth to God for vs.
            7. Whereupon it must needs follow that seeing the Angels do not only know our actions much better then men, and heare our prayers no lesse then they, but also do continually assist vs as well with their prayers, as otherwyse; it followeth, I say, that we may lawfully craue their assistance, yea much more then of men, for that they being ordayned by God to help vs, are no lesse willing, and farre more potent, and able to do it then men are; and therefore truly I may well conclude, that neyther the Councell of Laodicea, nor yet Theodoret could be so absurd as M. Andrews would make them, to thinke it Idolatry to pray to Angels, when they know it to be lawfull to pray to men. And this I say the rather of Theodoret, because he teaching expressely (as I signifyed before) that Angels haue the protection of men, doth declare withall, that men are subiect imperio Angelorum,

                to the gouernment, and command of Angels, and that they pray for vs,

whereby he teacheth consequently that men owe vnto them, not only loue, and gratitude as to their Guardians, and Protectors, but also the duty of reuerence, and supplication, as to their superiours, commanders, gouernours, and intercessours for them.
            
               M. Andrews must reforme his vnderstanding of Theodoret.8. So as M. Andrewes may see that he hath iust cause to reforme his vnderstanding of that place of Theodoret, and acknowledge that it is not likely, that Theodoret would thereby contradict his owne doctrine elswhere, but rather that he, I meane M. Andrews, hath notably abused both the Councell and Theodoret; the Councell, in concealing, and dissembling the whole substance of the Canon, which he could not but know; and Theodoret in leauing out that which was most necessary for the explication of his meaning in both those places which he cyteth; and finally that he hath also abused them both, in making them to impugne, and forbid all prayer to Angels, though as intercessours to Christ for vs: whereas they only forbid Idolatry to Angels, with prayer to them, as to the only mediatours betwixt God and vs, wherby Christs mediation for vs is wholy excluded, to the vtter subuersion, and ouerthrow of our Christian fayth.
            
               The place of S. Paul forbidding the religion of Angels explicated.9. And to the end that all this may be yet more cleare, we are to consider that religio Angelorum, the religion, or superstitious worship of Angels, which S. Paul reprehended in the Epistle to the Colossenses, that Theodoret expoundeth, was no other but some such Magicall, or Idolatrous worship exhibited to Angels as the disciples of Simon Magus vsed (whereof

                of whome Theodoret speaketh, which was to exclude the mediation of Christ, as it appeareth euidently by that which the Apostle addeth saying: &amp; non tenens Caput ex quo &amp;c. and not holding the head whereof the whole body is by ioynts, &amp; bands compacted &amp;c. signifying that he spake of such as forsook the head, to wit Christ, and made Angels the chiefe mediatours of their reconciliation to God.
            10. Therefore S. Chrysostome saith vpon that place of S. Paul: Sunt nonnulli &amp;c. there are some which do say that we must not come to God the Father, and be reconciled to him by Christ, but by Angels: and so doth also Oecumenius, and Theophilactus expound the same place.

               The same is to be granted much more in supernaturall things.14. And this being so in naturall and earthly matters subiect to our senses, what shall we thinke of heauenly thinges, or of matters belonging to religion, and fayth, which do farre more exceed mans weake capacity? must we eyther know how they are wrought, or els deny the effects? Let M. Andrews tell me how Angels, and Saynts in heauen do pray to God for vs, which he granteth they do, or how they vnderstand one another; or yet how the humanity of Christ heareth our prayers, and knoweth our actions, I meane, whether he seeth them in his diuinity, or knoweth them by reuelation? and if he dare not determine the matter, let him according to his owne inference doubt whether Christ heareth our prayers, or not: yea let him not willingly pray vnto him, seeing he 
                  Pa. 37. §. Vt hoc.
                sayth that no man doth willingly call vpon those of whome he is vncertayne by what meanes they heare him: and if he will take vpon him to determine it, let him tell me why the glorified soules of Saynts which see God, may not heare our prayers, and know our actions in the same manner?
            15. But to omit infinite other instances which might be giuen, let vs heare what S. Augustine sayth, euen in a matter pertayning to this question whereof we now treate. For albeit he maketh great doubt how Almighty God did work those stupendious miracles (which as he testifieth vpon his owne knowledge were done at the memoryes,
                  S. Aug. de ciuit. li 22. cap. 8. and relyques of S. Steuen,
               
and other Martyrs) yet he made so litle doubt of the effect, that he vrged the same notably against the Paynims to proue the verity of the Christian fayth, saying:

                     Idem Ibid. c. 
                     
                        •
                     . whereby he worketh temporall things, being himselfe eternall; or whether he doth the selfe same things by his ministers, or whether he doth some of them by the soules of the Martyrs, as he doth by men whiles they are yet heere in body, or all by Angels whome he commandeth inuisibly, immutably, and without a body (in such sort that those things which are sayd to be done by the Martyrs, be done only by their prayers, and impetration, &amp; not also by their operation) or whether some things are done by these meanes, &amp; some by others, which cannot by any meanes be cōprehended by mortall men, ei profectò haec attestantur fidei &amp;c. all these truly do giue testimony to that fayth, wherein the resurrection of the flesh is preached.
            
            16. Thus discourseth this holy Father, acknowledging as you see, the imbecillity of mans vnderstanding to comprehend the manner how Almighty God did worke these supernaturall effects, although he doubted not of the effects of themselues,M. Andrews cō

Sauiour Iesus Christ on the right hand of his Father in heauen; and therefore it, were absurd to imagine that the glorified Saynts in heauen could not see, or know what is done on earth, especially such things as concerne themselues, and the honour that is done vnto them for Gods greater glory, and the prayers that are directed to them for the reliefe of Gods seruants. Lastly S. Iohn in the Apocalyps signifyeth that the Saynts in heauen do offer vp the prayers of holy men on earth,

                  .20. Moreouer S. Augustine discoursing how the Saynts shall see God in heauen after the resurrection, and whether they shall see him with their corporall eyes, teacheth by the way, that they shall then see all things with the eyes of the spirit, etiam vnde sunt corpore absentes, euen whence they are absent in body; and this he proueth amply by the example of Elizaeus, who being absent from his seruant Giezi, saw him take gifts of Naaman,
               
                  
                     •
                  . Reg. 
                  
                     •
                  . and therefore sayd vnto him, Nonne cor meum in praesenti erat &amp;c. was not my hart present with thee, when the man came from his Chariot to meete thee, and thou tookest the money? Whereupon S. Augustine sayth; Corde suo ergo se dixit hoc vidisse Propheta &amp;c. therfore the Prophet sayd that he saw this with his hart, being no doubt admirably helped by Almighty God: but how much more shall all men then abound in this gift, when God shalbe omnia in omnibus, all in all? Thus discourseth this

learned Father to proue that the Saynts after their resurrection videbunt omnia, shall see all things with their spirituall eye, etiam vnde sunt corpore absentes, euen whence they are absent in body.
            21. And this must needs be vnderstood in lyke manner of glorifyed soules before the resurrection, for that the glorification of their bodyes (although it shall increase their Ioy, and glory, yet) shall not increase their vision of God, or knowledge, which they haue now as perfect, as they shall haue after their resurrection. Finally to omit many other Fathers which might be alledged, S. Gregory sayth,
                  S. Greg. li. 12. Moral. cap. 14. that it is not to be belieued, that quae intus claritatem Dei vident &amp;c. the soules which see into the light, or brightnes of God, are ignorant of any thing that is abroad;
                  Idem. li. 4. Dial. ca. 33. and againe in another place, quia in illa aeterna haereditate &amp;c. for as much as in that eternall inheritance all men do see God with a cōmon clarity, or brightnes, what is there which they cannot know, who know him that knoweth all things? Thus saith S. Gregory, teaching, as you see, that the Saynts in heauen know all things in earth, and yielding the selfe same reason thereof which you haue heard M. Andrews say was inaudita Patribus, neuer heard of amongst the Fathers, to wit, that because they see, and know God, therefore they see, and know all things in him, in whome omnia constant, sayth the Apostle, all things do consist.
            
            22. So as howsoeuer the ancient Fathers may haue differed in opinion concerning the manner how the Saynts know things done on earth,A good deduction vpon M. Andrews his owne grant. 
               M. Andrews may see that they agree touching the effect: which also is so conforme to reason, that he cannot with reason deny it, especially seeing he himselfe granteth that the

Saynts do pray for vs of their charity, &amp; loue towards vs. For if they loue vs so, that as S. Cyprian. li. de mortalit. Item. ep. 57. 
               S. Cyprian saith, de nostra salute sunt solliciti, they are carefull for our saluation, and as M. Andrews 
               
                  Andr. pag. 37. §. Omnia. Item. p. 46. lin. 9. confesseth they do indeed pray for vs, it must needs be granted that this their loue, and care doth include a desire to know our necessityes whereupon it also followeth that they do know them
                  •
                for if their desire should not be satisfyed, they should not be so happy and blessed, as the perfection of their beatitude doth requyre: besides, that seeing Almighty God doth glorify them not only in heauen with the visiō of his Deity, but also in earth with many miracles done at their monuments (as M. Andrews himselfe confesseth in his answere to a place of S. Basil) it were absurd to thinke that they do not know as well the particuler fauours that God doth to men for their fakes,
                  Andr. p. 4. §. Non Verè.
                as also the honour and glory that redoundeth thereof both to God, and them, without which knowledge their beatitude, as I haue sayd, should not be complete.
            23. Now then seeing that our doctrine, that Saynts do heare,A brief recapitulation of the reasons whereupō is grounded the doctrine that Saynts heare our prayers. or vnderstand our prayers, is grounded vpon such sure foundations, as heere I haue declared, to wit, the continuall custome, and practice of the Church to pray to them; the manifest experience of benefits receiued by them; the conformity thereof to the holy Scriptures, with the vniforme and expresse testimonyes of the Fathers, &amp; lastly vpon reason it selfe; how little reason hath M. Andrews to deny it vpon no better reason, then because it is vncertayne in what manner they heare vs? especially seeing I haue also euidently proued that the vncertainty of the manner,
                  See before nu. 13 &amp; 14. meanes, or cause of any thing, can nothing derogate

from the certaynty of the effect, so as he must eyther bring some more solid arguments agaynst prayer to Saynts, or els he shall but discouer both his owne imbecillity, and the weakenes if his cause.
            24. And therefore he had reason to seeke some better reason,Another silly shift of M. Andrews. which he doth, seeming to put the case that it were true, yea most manifest that Saynts do heare our prayers, yet, ne sic quidem (sayth he) audemus vota nostra ad illos preces
                     
                        
                     
                     que
                   dirigere, we dare not for all that direct our vowes,
                  Andr cap. 1 p. 37. §. Verum.
                and prayers vnto them; and hereof he yieldeth this reason, cùm praeceptum 
                     •
                  a de re nullum acceperimus, praeceptum autem acceperimus in Lege disertis verbis:
               
                  Deut. 12. 
               Quod tibi praecepero hoc tantùm facies. We dare not (saith he) pray vnto them, because we haue receiued no precept concerning that poynt,M. Andrews is so scrupulous that he dare do nothing without 
                     •
                   precept or example in Scripture. but haue receiued a precept in the law, in expresse words; What I shall command thee, that only thou shalt doe: So he; and then concludeth; id tantùm audemus facere &amp;c. We dare doe that only whereof we haue a precept. Bring you a praecept, and we will straight inuocate them with you. Thus argueth he.
            25. And hath he not, trow you, very well proued now, that nothing may be practiced in Gods Church without an expresse written precept?His impertinent allegation of Scripture. Who would thinke that a Doctor of diuinity should haue so litle vnderstanding of the holy Scriptures, as to inferre this conclusion vpon the place that he alledgeth, which concerneth only the Sacrifyces that God required, and commanded to be offred vnto him in the Mosaycall law, as it is euident by the very circumstances of the place, in the 12. Chapter of Deuteronomy, from whence that precept is taken. For when Almighty God had admonished the people to beware

that they did not imitate the nations whose lands they should possesse, in their abominable Sacrifyces, saying: for all the abhominations, that our Lord doth abhorre, haue they done to their Gods,
               
                  Deut. 12. 
               offering their sonnes, and daughters,
               An explication of the place of Deuteronomy alledged by M. Andrews. 
               and burning them with fire, after this I say, followeth immediatly, what I command thee, that only doe to our Lord, neyther adde any thing, nor diminish. Thus sayd Almighty God; as who would say, whereas the gentills whose lands thou shalt possesse, did worship their Gods with most abominable Sacrifyces, and ceremonyes, sacrificing their owne children by fire, do not thou imitate them therein, but offer thou to me in Sacrifice, only that which I doe command thee, to wit those things which are ordayned, and prescrybed in the law to that end,
            26. And this no doubt is the cleare sense, and meaning of those words, for if they shalbe vnderstood, as M. Andrews taketh them, to exclude the practice of all things whatsoeuer that were not expressely commanded in the letter of the law,
                  Hest. 9 Iudith ca. vlt. 1. Machab. 4. then the solmne feasts ordayned afterwards by Mardochaeus, Iudith, and the Machabees had byn vnlawfull, which neuertheles are approued in the Scripture, and the last of the 3. to wit the feast of the Dedication instituted by the Machabees,
               
                  Ioan. 10. was honoured by our Sauiour himself with his presēce. But let vs put the case that this commandment of Almighty God was generall touching the seruice and worship of God in the old law,M. Andrews hardly pressed by his owne argument. will M. Andrewes inferre thereupon, that the same is to be extended to the new law? As well may he say, that we are bound to obserue the whole law, and so proue himselfe a Iew, &amp; euacuate the law of Christ, as Saynt Paul argueth against 
                  Gal. 5. those that mayntained the vse of Circūcisiō
                togeather

with the faith of Christ.
            27. Neuertheles I say not this to exclude all manner of arguments,How arguments may be deduced from the Law of Moyses. or inferences drawne from the old law to the new (that the same remayne within the limits of probability, as from the figure, to the verity, which admitteth many limitations, and exceptions) but to exclude the obligation of all precepts eyther ceremoniall,
                  See chap. 1. nu. 14.15. &amp; 16. or Iudiciall, which do not in any sort bynd vs now, as I haue shewed in the first Chapter of this Adioynder. And therefore whereas M. Andrews sayth heere, cùm praeceptum acceperimus in lege disertis verbis &amp;c. seeing we haue receiued a precept in the law in expresse words &amp;c.
               M. Andrews his argument proueth himselfe to be a Iew. I say to him that seeing this precept did vndoutedly belong to the ceremoniall law, and concerned only the manner of worship to be done to God by Sacrifice, he sheweth himselfe a flat Iew, in saying that we Christians haue receiued this precept in the law.
            28. Furthermore he is to vnderstand, that albeit we should grant that nothing can be practiced, or taught in the new law without some precept, or doctrine thereof deliuered by our Sauiour Christ vnto his Church, yet he could gayne nothing thereby, except he could also proue that all our Sauiours precepts, and doctrine are expressely set downe in Scripture, which neyther he nor any of his fellowes haue byn able yet to proue, or euer shalbe, it being euident that our Sauiour neyther commanded any thing at all to be written, but to be preached, and taught, saying, praedicate euangelium &amp;c. preach the gospell to euery Creature, and againe docete omnes gentes &amp;c. teach all Nations,
               
                  Matth. 28. 
               baptizing them &amp;c. neyther did the Apostles eyther write any thing of diuers yeares after Christ Ascension, or when they

wrote, deliuer all Christs doctrine, and their owne by writing,
                  
                     •
                  . Thes. 2. but very many things by tradition, in which respect the Apostle himselfe saith, tenete traditiones quas accepistis, siue per sermonem, siue per. Epistolam nostram, hold the traditions which you haue receiued eyther by word, or by our Epistle, by which words of the Apostle the ancient Fathers namely

                  nifest, that the Apostles did not deliuer all things by Epistle, but many things without writing; eadem fide digna sunt tam illa, quàm ista: as well those things as these, are worthy of the same credit.
            
            
               S. Augustines golden rule.29. For this cause S. Augustine giueth this generall rule, that whatsoeuer the whole Church retayneth, whereof the beginning cannot be deduced eyther from the Scriptures, or Generall Councells, or some later institution, the same was vndoutedly deliuered by the Apostles, and this he vrgeth 
                  S. Aug. de Baptis. contra Donat. l. 2. ca. 7. &amp; li. 4. c. 6. &amp; Ibid cap. 24. &amp; li. 5. ca. 23. very often as a most assured ground, and principle agaynst the Donatists; and for the same reason not only he, but also all other Fathers teach, that the generall custome of the Church, is an infallible, and euident proofe of the truth in any controuersy, in so much that he affirmeth it to be insolentissimae insaniae, a poynt of most insolent madnes to dispute, or doubt of it, as I haue declared in the last Chapter, which I wish M. Andrews well to obserue, as also the other testimonyes of the ancient Fathers produced there concerning this poynt.
                  Idem ep. 118. See chap. 7. nu. 49.
            
            30. Now then, hereupon I conclude two things, the one, that M. Andrews, who as he sayth dare do

nothing without a written precept, may lay away his scruple, in matters that are generally practised by the Church, the other, that seeing it is euident by these testimonyes of so many holy and learned Fathers, as haue byn heere alledged, that the whole Church in their dayes practized prayer to Saynts, as a thing most beneficiall to men, and honorable to God; and that they acknowledged the euident and miraculous benefits that grew to men thereby, yea vrged the same agaynst the very Gentills, and Paynims, as inuincible arguments of the diuinity of Christ, and of the verity of Christian religion: and seeing also that this practice, custome, and beliefe was then generall, when Christian religion most florished (I meane in the tyme of the 4. first generall Councells) and when the Church abounded most with famous Doctors, Pastors, and Fathers, it must needs be graunted, that the doctrine of prayer to Saynts, is an irrefragable verity, and that according to S. Augustines censure, it is no lesse then insolent madnes in M. Andrewes to call it in question,M. Andrews according to S. Augustins censure is an insolent mad man. and much more to impugne it with such friuolous reasons as he doth, and especially with a ceremoniall precept of the Mosaycall law, as if he were a Iew, and not a Christian, seeing that he acknowledgeth himselfe to haue receiued a precept thereby disertis verbis, in expresse words, which I thinke no good Christian will say of any precept,
                  Andr. p. 38. §. Atque.
                belonging to the ceremoniall, or Iudiciall law.
            31. But M. Andrews goeth yet further, and exacteth at least some example of it in the Scripture,
                  S. Aug li de vnit. Eccl. ca. 22. vel. 19. in some ed
                        •
                     
                     tions.
                if there be no precept: whereto S. Augustine answereth sufficiently, when he sayth to a Donatist (who made the lyke demaund about the rebaptization of such as

were baptized by heretykes) that seeing there is no example or expresse mention of it in Scripture, and that Christ hath clearly and expresly recommended vnto vs the authority of his vniuersall Church dispersed thoughout the world, the testimony and custome of that Church is to be admitted and imbraced, and whosoeuer reiecteth or resisteth the same,
                  Idem. contra. Crescon. lib. 1. cap. 33. doth most perniciously resist our Sauiour himselfe against his owne saluation. Thus sayth S. Augustine in substance, though much more amply; who also speaking elswhere of the same point, giueth this notable, and generall rule, that for as much as the holy Scripture doth vndoubtedly recommend vnto vs the authority of the Church etiam in hac re à nobis tenetur Scripturarum veritas &amp;c. the veri
                     •
                  y of Scripture is retayned by vs in this point, when we do that which hath already pleased the whole Church. So he. And so say I to M. Andrews in this our case; to wit that seeing it is euident by the testimony of all antiquity, that the inuocation of Saynts was generally admitted, and practised by the Primitiue Church, and from thence hath descended to our tyme, there needeth no example of it in Scripture, because the authority of the Church, which the Scriptures do expressely recommend vnto vs sufficeth to warrant the same.M. Andrews and his fellowes do admit diuers traditions without any ex
                     •
                  presse precept, or example thereof in Scripture.
            
            32. And truly it may seeme strange that M. Andrews, or any of his fellowes of the English Clergy do deny this, seeing that they do admit diuers traditions whereof there is neyther precept, nor example in the Scripture; as the baptisme of infants, who do not actually belieue, for although the same be very consonant to Scripture (as also is prayer to Saynts, and all other things which are practiced in the Catholike

Church) yet the vse, and practice thereof is grounded vpon tradition and not vpon the Scriptures,
                  Origen lib. 5. in cap. 6. ad Rom.
                as Origen testifyeth, saying: Ecclesia ab Apostolis traditionē accepit &amp;c. The Church receiued a tradition from the Apostles, to giue baptisme to litle children. So he. And S. Augustin also to the same purpose saith more plainely thus;
                  S. Aug. de Gen. ad lit. li. 10. c. 23. 
               Consuetudo m
                     •
                  tris Ecclesiae in baptizandis paruulis &amp;c. the custome of our Mother the Church in baptizing infants, is not to be contemned, or reputed as superfluous, neyther were it to be belieued at all, if it were not an Apostolicall tradition. So he, who also acknowledgeth the same in another place,
                  Idem lib. 4. de Baptis. con
                        •
                     ra Donatist. cap. 24. and saith further, that if any man do demaund diuine authority for it (quamquam quod vniuersa tenet Ecclesia &amp;c. albeit that which the vniuersall Church holdeth, and hath not byn ordayned by Councells, but hath alwayes been reteyned, is most rightly belieued to haue byn deliuered by no other, but by Apostolicall authority) neuertheles we may truly coniecture by Circumcision in the old law, what force the Sacrament of Baptisme hath in Infants. Thus saith S. Augustine, who to answere those, that do demand diuine authority, for the custome of the Church in baptizing Infants, doth not proue, or confirme it by any precept, or example out of Scripture, but only by a probable coniecture drawn from the figure of it in the old law, relying principally vpon the tradition of the Church.
            33. But what need I seeke any other testimony for this matter, seeing that Tho. Rogers in the 39. articles agreed vpon by the pretended Bishops, and Clergy of England, and analyzed into propositions, glossed, and set forth by him, with their publyke approbation, doth acknowledge that the baptisme of yong children, is in any wyse to be retayned in the Church, as most

agreeable with the institution of Christ,
               
                  See the faith, doctrine &amp;c. printed an. Do. 1607. by Iohn Legat in Cambridg pag. 1

               although (sayth he) we be not commanded by expresse termes to baptize them. So he; whereupon it directly followeth, that M. Andrews hath ouerlashed greatly in saying, id tantùm audemus facere de quo praeceptum habemus, we dare doe that only whereof we haue a precept. Also what precept, or example haue M. Andrews and his fellowes in Scripture for the vse of Godfathers, and Godmothers, and of the signe of the crosse in Baptisme, allowed as well by their practice, as by the late Queenes Iniunctions, yea and by the Ecclesiasticall Canons of the Bishops,
                  See constitutions Ecclesiast. printed at London by Barker an. 1604, can. 30. and Clergy of the Prouince of Canterbury, made in their Synod held at London with his Maiestyes lycence, in the yeare 1603. and published the yeare following by his Maiestyes authority, vnder the great Seale of England, in which Canons they do not only approue the vse of the signe of the crosse in Baptisme, but also professe to follow therein the primitiue, &amp; Apostolicall Churches, &amp; the true rules of doctrine cōcerning things indifferent, which are consonant to the word of God, and the iudgement of all the ancient Fathers, so that by their owne confession, they retayne the vse of it without eyther precept or example in holy Scripture.
            34. And now, because I haue had this occasion to speake of this constitution,A notable trumpery of the pretended Bishops in their Ecclesiastical Constitutions. I can not omit to aduertise thee, good Reader, of a notable peece of trumpery, and cosenage, vsed by that graue Synod, in this very Canon whereof we now speake; wherein giuing the reason why they retayne the vse of the signe of the crosse in Baptisme, they say they do it, because the same hath byn euer accompanyed (among them) with sufficient cautions, &amp; exceptions agaynst all popish superstition, and errour, and forsooth,
                  Ibidem.
                that the world may vnderstand from

what popish errour they haue freed the same, they signify, that the Church of England since the abolishing of Popery, hath euer held, and taught, that the signe of the crosse vsed in Baptisme is no part of the substance of that Sacrament, and that the infant Baptized is by vertue of Baptisme (before it be signed with the signe of the crosse) receiued into the congregation of Christs flock, as a perfect member thereof, and not by any power ascribed to the signe of the crosse &amp;c. whereupon they conclude, that the vse of the signe of the crosse in Baptisme, being thus purged from all popish superstition, and errour, and reduced in the Church of England to the primary institution of it &amp;c. it is to be reuerently retayned, and vsed. Thus teach they in their foresayd Synod.
            
            35. But now we must demand of them where they haue euer read in any Catholyke Authour, that the signe of the crosse,
                  D. Tho. 3. par. q 66. Greg. de Valent. disput. 4. q. 1. Nauar. in Manu. cap. 22. nu. 6.

yet it maketh no doubt at all,

But of this I shall not neede to produce any further proofe, seeing that those pretended Bishops, which were present at this Congregation, and made this Canon, haue giuen sufficient testimony of the truth in this poynt, to no meaner a person, then to his Maiesty himselfe, as he did publikely testify in the Cō
               ference at Hampton-court wherein the question concerning the vse of the signe of the crosse in Baptisme, being debated betwixt them and the Puritans, his Maiesty sayd, that he vnderstood by the Bishops, yea and found it himselfe to be true, that the Papists themselues did neuer ascribe any power, or spirituall grace to the signe of the crosse in Baptisme,

Thirdly. printed an. 1604. whereupon it followeth that they do not, nor euer did account to be any essentiall part of the Sacrament, for if they did, they should ascribe vnto it a spirituall grace, and power, as they doe to the essence of the Sacrament, which they all do vniformly teach to giue grace ex opere operato, and therefore seeing that according to his Maiestyes testimony (as well vpon his owne knowledge,Conference of Hampton Court cō
                  trary to the Constitutions and the same Bishops to them selues. as by the relation of the Bishops to him) the Catholykes did neuer ascribe any power, or spirituall grace to the signe of the Crosse in Baptisme, it is euident that the Bishops in their Synod belyed them egregiously (charging them to hold it to be a part of the substance of the Sacrament) yea and notably deluded the people in seeking to perswade them, that the Catholykes had corrupted

the vse thereof, and that the English Clergy hath now reduced it to the primary institution.

            38.M. Andrews transgresseth eyther the Synodical Canon of the English Clergy or his owne rule But to returne to M. Andrews (who perhaps was one of that conuenticle, though not as a Bishop, yet as one of the Clergy of the Prouince of Canterbury) I would gladly know of him whether he, and his Clergy in the Diocesse of Ely, do vse the signe of the Crosse in the administration of Baptisme, or not; and if they do not, let him tell vs how they obserue this Synodicall Canon made by his fellowes, and authorized by his Maiesty: and if they do obserue it, let him shew vs some precept, or example of it in Scripture, seeing he resolutly affirmeth in the name of the whole English Church,
                  See supra nu.

                as it seemeth, that they dare do that only whereof they haue a precept. Therefore I say, let him

eyther shew vs some precept for it in Scripture, or els confesse that he, and his fellowes dare do more then is commanded therein.
            39. Finally, if they may lawfully follow the primitiue, and Apostolicall Churches, and the iudgement of all the ancient fathers, in matters though not commanded in Scripture,Prayer to Saynts no lesse conforme to the practice of the primitiue Church, then the vse of the signe of the Crosse in Baptisme. yet consonant thereto (as they professe to do in the foresayd Canon) then they must also grant, that it is in lyke manner lawfull for Catholykes, to do the lyke for prayer to Saynts, seeing that the same is conforme to the practice of the primitiue Church, and to the beliefe of the ancient fathers, and consequently to the holy Scriptures, for otherwyse neyther would so many learned, ancient and holy fathers haue approued it, neyther yet the Church (whose authority, as S. Augustine sayth, the Scripture recommendeth vnto vs) would haue practised it; I meane that visible Catholyke Church,
                  S. Aug. li. de vnit. Eccl. c. 1
                     •
                  . &amp; contra Crescon. lib. 1. c. 31. whereof S. Augustine did so constantly defend, and mayntayne the authority, agaynst the heretykes in his tyme, that he pronounced them (as you haue heard before) to be most insolent mad men, if they did but only doubt of any generall custome thereof.
                  Idem. ep. 118.
            
            40. Whereupon I conclude, that prayer to Saynts being generally approued, and practised by the Church in S. Augustines tyme, it must needs follow according to his rule, that the vse, and practice thereof, is not only most lawfull, and consonant to Scripture, but also reuerently to be retayned, and vsed by M. Andrews, and his fellowes, euen according to their owne profession in their Synodicall constitution, seeing, as I haue signified before, they professe reuerently to retayne the signe of the Crosse in Baptisme (though not

commanded in Scripture) because the same was vsed in the primitiue Church, and is consonant to Scripture, and to the Iudgement of all the ancient Fathers.
            
            41. And if he say,M. Andrews still hardly pressed with his owne rule and inference vpō the text of Deuteronomy. that they professe in their Canon to follow the rules of doctrine, concerning things that are (at least) indifferent, &amp; that prayer to Saynts is neyther absolutly good, nor yet indifferent, but altogeather vnlawfull, and consequently not to be vsed, he is to vnderstand first, that according to his owne rule, and inference vpon the text of Deuteronomy, he neyther doth, nor can admit any thing, that is not commanded in Scripture, be it neuer so good. For he sayth id tantúm audemus facere &amp;c. we dare do that only whereof we haue a precept, and to that purpose he alledgeth also the text of Deuteronomy, hoc tantùm facies quod tibi praecipio, thou shalt do this only which I do command thee, where you see the word tantùm as well in his assertion, as in the text of Scripture, excludeth all things whatsoeuer that are not commanded, whereupon it followeth that the vse of the signe of the Crosse in baptisme is as well prohibited, as prayer to Saynts, if hee vnderstand that text of Deuteronomy aright,Prayer to Saynts ought rather to be admitted, then the signe of the Crosse in Baptisme according to the Synodicall Canon of the English Clergy. and make a good inference thereon,
            42. Secondly it is not sufficient, that he and his fellowes do hold the inuocation of Saynts to be vnlawfull, but they must also proue it so to be, or els they must grant the practice of it to be lawfull (as of a thing at least indifferent) vpon the same reason that they admit the 
                  •
               igne of the Crosse in baptisme, yea with farre greater reason, seeing that, as I haue already proued, prayer to Saynts is not only good, and lawfull, but also most profitable, and beneficiall to men, whereas the Crosse in baptisme (according to the doctrine of

the foresayd Canon) hath no vertue, or power in it at all, but is only an outward Ceremony, and honorable badge of a Christian. So as M. Andrews cannot approue the vse thereof, and exclude the practice of prayer to Saynts, except he wilbe so absurd to admit things indifferent, and reiect a thing absolutly good, and very necessary for euery Christian man; for so I say, he must needs confesse the inuocation of Saynts to be,M. Andrews eyther idly demandeth a precept in Scripture for prayer to Saynts, or els he must grant it to be as lawfull as the signe of the Crosse in Baptisme. except he can ouerthrow the testimonies of all the ancient Fathers, yea and the experience that the Church hath alwayes had of the soueraygne benefits that men reape thereby.
            43. Thirdly, whereas he demandeth a precept in Scripture for prayer to Saynts, he seemeth to grant it to be eyther good of it selfe, or at least indifferent; for if it were absolutly bad, it were in vayne, and absurd to demand a precept of it, for that it could neuer be commanded, so as eyther his demand in that behalfe is very idle, and absurd, or els he must acknowledge it at least to be indifferent, and consequently, that it is no lesse lawfull to vse it without a precept, then the signe of the Crosse in Baptisme.
            
               1. Tim. 2.
               1. Ioan. 2.44. Lastly, seeing that he vseth the signe of the Crosse without a precept, because it is consonant to Scripture (for so sayth the Canon) and reiecteth prayer to Saynts for want of a precept,What places and how fit to the purpose the Protestāts alleadge out of the Scriptures agaynst praying to Saynts. it is reason that he shew vs, eyther some prohibitiō of prayer to Saynts in Scripture, or at least how it is repugnant to Scripture: which he shall neuer be able to do, as it appeareth suffciently by those texts of Scripture, that he and his fellowes are wont to alledge agaynst it; as for example, they obiect, that Christ is the only mediatour betwixt God, and man, that he is our aduocate with his Father, and

that he commandeth all men that labour,
               
                  Matth. 11. 
               and are loaden to come to him, promising to refresh them, and such lyke places as signify vnto vs the bounty, and mercy of our Sauiour Christ, and his facility, and readines to heare, and helpe vs; all which places being vnderstood as our aduersaries take them, do no lesse ouerthrow our mutuall prayers one for another, then our prayers to Saynts, whereby they may vnderstand their absurdity.
            45. For if Christ be our only mediatour,
               The absurdity of our aduersaries arguments against the inuocatiō of Saynts. and aduocate in such sort as they take it, to wit, that we may not craue the prayers of Saynts without iniury to Christ, because he is our only mediatour, how then doth the Scripture teach vs to craue one anothers prayers? is i
                  •
                lesse iniury to Christ to craue the prayers of sinners, thē of Angels, and Saynts, who are free from sinne, and most acceptable to God? And againe, if it be lawfull to come to God by the mediation, and prayers of men, can it be vnlawfull to come to him by the intercession of Angels, and Saynts? But that thou mayst, good Reader, see how substantially M. Andrews argueth against prayer to Saynts out of these places of Scripture,
                  Andr. cap. 8. pag. 179. lin. 29. thou shalt heare an eloquent discourse of his; thus then he sayth.
            
               46. Cùm, Venite ad me, dixerit &amp;c. seeing that Christ sayd come to me, come all and I will refresh you (that is to say, by my selfe, and not by mynisters) why do we not go to himselfe directly without an interpreter,A very seely and simple discourse of M. Andrews against praying to Saynts. and sue to him, but do go out of the way to Saynts, and sue to them that they may vouchsafe to be suters for vs? Do we treate with any of the holy Spirits more safely, or sweetly then with our Iesus? haue they more easy accesse, or better commodity to speake to God?

or is any elder amongst the Iewes, more gratefull to Christ then the faithfull Centurian? do the Saynts better know our needs, or are they more compassionate, or more mercifull or yet more affectionat towards vs then he, whereby we may haue more confidence in them, then in him? ought we to make more account of any fauour of theirs, then of Christs promisse (I will refresh you) or of his precept, come to me? But when you do so inuocate Saynts, you giue them the place of Christ, for if you come to them, you haue in Christs place those that may refresh you insteed of him; you haue mediatours to God who may pray for your sinnes, such (mediatours) as Paul, and Iohn did not make themselues, and if they had, the faithfull Christians would not haue suffered it,S.

Andrews serious in tryfling. which thou wilt euidently see, good Reader, if thou do but note well his discourse, and what followeth thereof (if his construction of those places of Scripture, which he alledgeth be true) for as well might he argue thus (following his owne grounds and changing only the word Saynts into men)

Do we conferre more safely, or sweetly with any man then with our Iesus? haue we more easy accesse or better opportunity to speake to any man then to him? do men know our necessityes better then he, or are they more compassionate,

mercifull, or more affectionate towards vs then he, whereby we may haue more confidence in them, then in him? ought we not much more to esteeme Christs promise (to wit, I will refresh you) and his precept Come vnto me, then any fauour of men? But you, when you craue the prayers of men, do giue them the place of Christ; for if you come to them, you haue in Christs place those which may refresh you insteed of him, you haue mediatours to God, which may pray for your sinnes, such (mediatours) as Paul, and Iohn did not make themselues &amp;c.
            
            48. Loe then how substantially he hath argued against prayer to Saynts,M. Andrews his argumēts do as directly-ouerthrow that which he himselfe approueth, a
                     •
                   that which he impugneth. seeing that his arguments (if they haue any force at all) do as directly ouerthrow that which he himselfe approueth, as that which he impugneth, I meane as well our mutuall prayer one for another (which I am sure he will not disallow) as eyther the prayers of Saynts for vs, or our intercession to them; and is it possible, that so great a Clarke, and subtill Logician as he, did not see this? or that he is ignorant in what sense the Scripture teacheth that our Sauiour is our only mediatour, and aduocat? seeing that the Apostle hauing sayd, that, there is one mediatour of God and men Iesus Christ, addeth immediatly, qui dedit redemptionem semetipsum pro omnibus, who gaue himselfe a redemption for all,
               How it i

               comming (sayth the Apostle) to God by himselfe, whereas all other Aduocats, or Patrons (be they Angels, Saynts, or men) do no otherwyse obtayne grace, or mercy but by him, and by his merits, in which respect the Church endeth her prayers to Saints with per Christum Dominum nostrum, by Christ our Lord; and in this sense, I say, our Sauiour Christ is truly called our only mediatour, not only by the way of redemption, but also by the way of prayer which doth no way exclude other mediators to him for vs, or to God the Father by his merits, which M. Andrews himselfe confesseth sufficiently, seeing he granteth that the Saynts in heauen do pray for vs all with Christ their head, and doth not deny, but that we may craue the prayers one of another: whereupon it followeth that Christ is not our only mediatour by the way of prayer, in such sort as he and his fellowes do vnderstand it.
            50. And whereas he seeketh to confirme his false inference with the testimony of S. Augustine agaynst Parmenian the Donatist,
               The meaning of S. Augustine peruerted by M. Andrews, is truly explicated. saying, that if Paul, and Iohn had made themselues mediators, the faithfull Christians would not haue suffred it, he peruerteth wholy the sense of S. Augustine, as he is wont, alledging only a litle scrap of his discourse, and dissembling all that which doth fully explicate his meaning. And that this

may appeare thou shalt vnderstand, good Reader, that for as much as the Donatists taught that the grace of the Sacraments depended of the goodnes of the minister, yea and did most wickedly, and proudly affirme of themselues,

Augustine inueigheth bitterly agaynst this their execrable presumption, and pryde, &amp; sayth, that neyther S. Iohn, nor S. Paul, nor the rest of the Apostles durst euer presume to make themselues mediators in this sense; and therefore he saith that they acknowledged themselues to be sinners, and that S. Iohn did not say,1. Ioan. 2. 
               si quis peccauerit mediatorem me babetis &amp;c. if any man sinne, you haue me for a mediatour, but, aduocatū habemus &amp;c. we haue an aduocate Iesus Christ; whereby S. Iohn confessed himselfe to be a sinner &amp; to haue need of the propitiation, and mediatiō of Christ.
            
            51. And S. Paul in lyke manner commended himselfe (saith S. Augustine) to the prayers of the faithfull, and did not make himselfe a mediator betwixt God, and the people: so as S. Augustine sheweth euidently heereby, that he doth not exclude the mediation of Saynts, or of one man for another by way of intercession to Christ, but only in such sort, as the same should impugne Christs mediation for all men; which he also signifieth more expressely in the same place, saying, Homines omnes Christiani &amp;c. all Christian men do recommend themselues one to anothers prayers, but he for whome no man prayeth, but he for all, is the only and true

mediatour. Thus saith S. Augustine;How S. Augustine denyeth that men may be mediators one for another. who affirming that Christians craue the prayers one of another, graunteth consequently that they may also be mediatours, that is to say intercessors one for another, and therefore doth not deny that Saynts, or men may be mediators for men in any other sense then such as the proud Donatists vnderstood the same, who did so iustify themselues that they did euacuate, &amp; take away the necessity of Christs mediation for them, or for such as they recommended to God, esteeming themselues to be so pure, and immaculate, that God did heare them in respect of their owne purity.
            52. Wherein also it is to be obserued that albeit S. Augustine in all this discourse speaketh only of men whyles they liue in this world (and not of Saynts, or Angels) teaching that no man liuing (in respect of his frailty, and subiection to sinne) can be a mediator, or aduocate in the same sense that Christ is (to wit, in such sort that he needeth no other mediator,
               Neyther men nor Saynts, or Angels do obteyn any thing of God but by the mediation and meri
                     •
                  s of Iesus Christ. or aduocate to pray for him, but that he prayeth for all other) neuertheles the same may also be vnderstood of Angels, and Saynts; for although they pray for all men, and no man for them, yet for as much as they obtayne nothing of God but by Christs mediation, and merits, they cannot be sayd to be such mediatours, or aduocates as neede no other mediation, or helpe to obtayne their sutes, which is only sayd truly of Christ, who therefore is (as S. Augustine sayth) the true, and only mediator pro quo nemo interpellat, sed ipse pro omnibus, for whome no man prayeth, but he for all.
            
            53. This then being the cleare sense, and meaning of S. Augustine, I remit it to thy iudgement good Reader, whether this contradicteth any way our Catholyke

doctrine, or maketh any thing at al for M. Andrewes his purpose; may he not then be ashamed to say, as he doth, that when we craue the prayers to Saynts, we giue them the place of Christ, &amp; that when we come to them we seeke to be refreshed by them insteed of Christ? when neuertheles he doth not deny but that we may craue the prayers of men and consequently come to Christ by them, or rather togeather with them, and with their assistance; for no man I think that requests eyther men, or Saynts to pray for him, doth so wholy confide in their prayers, that he omitteth to pray to Christ,
               M. Andrews prodigall of his rhetorik. and therefore he commeth also himselfe immediatly to Christ, as he that hath a suite to a Prince, and doth not only procure to be recommended to him by his fauorits, but also presenteth his owne petition vnto him, doth come himselfe immediatly to the Prince, though he be accompanyed, or seconded by others, whereby it appeareth what a deale of Rhetorik M. Andrews hath cast away, to proue that he which prayeth to Saynts doth not come to Christ.
            
            54. And if he will yet say further (as some of his fellowes are wont to do, that the case is not lyke of Saynts, and men, because there are examples in the Scripture of crauing the prayers of men, but not of Saynts, he shall shew himselfe to be no lesse ignorant then absurb, because the same can be no confirmation of his former arguments taken out of Scripture,An absurd shift and euasion of our aduersaries vrged against thē. but an euident confutation of them, seeing that it appeareth thereby, that Christ is not the only mediator, or aduocate in the sense that they take it; for if he were then could we not craue the prayers of any but of Christ; and therefore for as much as the Scripture (which cannot be contrary to it selfe, alloweth and

exhorteth vs to craue one anothers prayers,
                  Iac. 5. it is euident that it doth not teach,The Scripture should cō

Furthermore seeing that the Scripture doth teach vs to craue the prayers and help of our brethren liuing, there can be no reason imagined, why we should not also do the same when they are glorifyed in heauen, but eyther because they do not heare, or vnderstand our prayers, or because they are not willing, or not able to helpe vs, but that they heare vs, I haue sufficiently proued already, and haue also answered M.

Thus argueth S. Hierome by an argument a fortiori, grounded on the Scripture to shew the extreame absurdity of Vigilantius the heretike, who denyed that the Saynts in heauen do pray for vs, and are able to helpe vs.
            59. And this ability of Saynts to helpe men, is to be ascribed not only to the effect of their prayers,

but also to their power,

before) it cannot be reiected by M. Andrews, and his fellowes, though there should be no cōmandment nor example of it in Scripture, seeing they professe to admit without a precept, such things as are indifferent, when they are conforme to the holy Scriptures, the practise of the primitiue Church, and iudgement of all the ancient Fathers.
            61. But what starting hole,Two foolish exceptions taken by M. Andrews to the Cardinalls allegation of the ancient Fathers. trow you, will M. Andrews find heere, or what exceptions will he take to this my conclusion? mary forsooth, he will cauill, at least, about the authority of the Fathers alledged by the Cardinall; against whome he taketh two mayne exceptions, the one concerning the age, and tyme when they lyued, and the other touching their vniforme consent; of the former he sayth that they were all of them after 300. yeares, to wit, in the 4. age, whereas in quadringentis annis, sayth he, rex expectat, the King expecteth the resolution of the Fathers of 400. yeares;
                  Andr. pag 35. §. de qua dringentis.
                as who would say that the Cardinall hath proued nothing to the purpose (at least to his Maiesties intention) because he hath not alledged any of the Fathers of the first 3. hundred yeares;M. Andrews wrongeth his Maiesty. wherein no doubt he doth his Maiesty great wrong, Fathering his owne foolish, and absurd conceipt vpon his Maiesty, whose great wisdome being considered, it cannot be imagined, that in admitting the Fathers of the first 500. yeares (for so he doth in the English Apology) his meaning was to reiect their vniforme consent in any one of those centuries especially seeing that his Maiesty professeth in the same place to reuerence the ancient Fathers more then euer the Iesuits did; which truly he should not do if his meaning were such as M. Andrews maketh it heere.
            
               62. For I am well assured that the Iesuits neuer tooke any exception agaynst all the Fathers of any one age from Christs tyme to this,The vniforme consent of the Fathers of the 4. or 5. age must needs be taken for an euidēt testimony of the truth. and much lesse to those of the 4. and 5. age, who were of such eminent learning; and sanctity, that their vniforme consent concerning any question of religion, must needs be held for an euident testimony of the truth, seeing that God of his infinit mercy, did then propagate his Church, and fayth ouer the world, and establish the same vnder Christian Emperours (to wit Constantin the Great, and his successors (by meanes whereof the Church was euery where prouided, and furnished with notable Pastours, who being freed from the former persecutions, had opportunity to write those ample volumes, and worthy monuments, which by Gods great prouidence they left to their posterity, for the confirmation of the Christian Catholyke fayth; whereas in the former ages (I meane the first 3. Centenaryes) the persecution was so great vnder the pagan Emperours that neyther the Christian faith could so much extend it selfe, as it did in the 4. and 5. age. Neyther could there be so many able men to write, neyther those that were, could haue such opportunity to do it, as the others had in the peace, and tranquility of the Church.
            
               Some one Father of the 4. and 5. age hath written more then all the Fathers of the 3. precedent ages.63. And this is euident by the workes of the one, and the other seeing that in the first 300. yeares, there were not past 7. or 8. Fathers at most, that wrote, (at least whose bookes we now haue) and of those also the most wrote very little, in so much that the workes of some one of the Fathers of the 4. and 5. age do in volume, and quantity exceed all the workes (that are now extant) of all the Fathers of the 3. former

ages; and therefore it cannot be expected, that they should treate, or touch all matters which are now in controuersy, especially such as were not then any way called in question. Besides that in the 4. and 5. age were held the 4. first Generall Councells, which not only his Maiesty,It is not possible that all the Doctors &amp; Pastors of the Church can erre in any thing at any tyme and why. but also M. Andrews himselfe admitteth. In which respect the Fathers of that tyme must needs be taken for assured, and vncontrollable witnesses of the truth, for those Councells (which were no other but assemblyes of the Fathers then liuing) could not be of such vndoubted authority, as they are, if the Fathers of those ages had vniformely taught, or belieued any erroneous doctrine; for if they were all deceiued in one point, they might also be deceiued and erre in the rest, and so should the whole Church (wherof they were the Pastors &amp; Doctors) be drawne into errour by them,
                  Matth. 28. Ibid. 16. which is not possible, seeing that Christ hath not only promised his owne assistance to his Church for euer,
                  Ephes. 4. and that hell gates shall not preuayle against it, but also hath placed in it Pastors,
               Pastors and Doctors ordayned by Christ in his Church to preserue it from errour, vnto the worlds end.

Whereby it is euident that God of his singular prouidence hath giuen Doctors, and Pastors to the Church, yea and ordayned that they shall remayne there vnto the worlds end, to preserue the same from errour; whereupon it followeth, that all the Doctors, and Pastors of the Church,If all the Doctors of the Church, could erre at any tyme, the remedy were not effectuall which God hath ordayned to preserue his Church from errour by them. cannot erre at any tyme, for if they could, then were not the remedy effectuall, and certayne which God hath ordayned in his Church

Andrews taketh against the Fathers alledged by the Cardinall, for being all of that 4. age, is most vayne, and friuolous, seeing that the consent of the Doctors of any one age is sufficient to determin any matter in controuersy.

Andrwes confuted by an example of his owne fellowes. doe affirme that they follow therein the iudgement of all the Fathers of the primitiue Church, but can they shew, trow you, that euery Father of the primitiue Church, yea or the greatest part of them do particulerly speake of that ceremony? sure

I am they cannot show it; for albeit diuers very ancient and holy Fathers do treat thereof and highly approue it, yet many others are vtterly silent concerning the same; neuertheles for as much as those that approue it, are not contradicted by any of the rest, their testimony may well be taken for the vniforme consent of all, or truly otherwyse my Lord Bishops will not be able to iustify their assertion, and proue that they follow the iudgement of all the Fathers in that poynt. Therfore this exception of M. Andrewes is very ridiculous except he can shew that those Fathers whome the Cardinall omitted, haue contradicted the testimonyes of the other; but this you see, he hath not byn able to doe, though he hath done his best endeauour thereto, with shame ynough to himselfe, and his cause.

Augustine named, and he himselfe also one of the number, and all of them florished aboue 1100. yeares agoe, and haue not byn gaynsayd, or impugned by any? May we not, I say, boldly admit their testimonyes

for a proofe of the vniforme consent of the Church in their tyme? The Scripture teacheth, and common practice approueth that 2. or 3. substantiall witnesses may suffice to proue any matter in question,
                  Deut. 17. and therefore much more may these 12. most learned, and holy Fathers suffice to shew, what was the practice, and beliefe of the Church in their dayes, especially seeing that diuers of them speake of publike matters of fact, which passed in their owne tyme, and knowledge, in which respect they cannot be thought to fayne; and lye, except we shall take them to be voyd both of conscience, and common honesty.
            69. But M. Andrewes addeth further, that it appeareth euen in Cardinall Bellarmine himselfe that the Fathers were not all of one mynd concerning prayer to Saynts,
                  Andr. vbi supra.
                and for proofe thereof he remitteth his Reader to the Cardinalls controuersyes,Another vayn euasion of M. Andrews answered. and particulerly to the tract de beatitudine Sanctorum, the first booke, and 20. Chapter; which truly I haue read diligently, and cannot find any thing at all to that purpose, except perhaps he meane that the Cardinall signifyeth there the different opinions of the Fathers concerning the manner how Saynts do vnderstand,
                  Bellar. de beatit. Sanct. lib. 1. cap. 20. or heare our prayers; whereupon it seemeth M. Andrewes inferreth that they differed also in opinion concerning the whole controuersy,Cardinall Bellarmine abused by M. Andrews. when neuertheles it appeareth euidently there, that they made no doubt whether prayer to Saynts be lawfull, neyther yet whether they know our actions, but only in what manner they know them, and how they heare, or vnderstand our prayers; touching which poynt, and the absurd inference that M Andrewes maketh thereof (denying the certaynty of the effect, by the vncertainty of the cause, or manner

of it) I haue so amply discoursed 
                  See supra nu. 12.13.14.15. &amp; 16. before, that I shall not need to say any more thereof in this place.
            70. But that which I wish to be noted heere is, that in the same Chapter which he quoteth, all the arguments of Luther, Caluin, the Magdeburgenses, and the rest, and amongst others euen those which he obiecteth against prayer to Saynts, are fully answered, and yet he insisteth still vpon the same, without any reply in the world to the Cardinalls answers, as though these his old stale obiections were new inuentions, and had neuer byn answered before; whereas reason would,M Andrews presumed to erre not of ignorance but of malice. that seeing he saw the answeres thereto (as by this his quotation it is manifest he did) he should haue said somewhat to confute them. And if he say that he did not hold them worthy of a reply, he should haue shewed the same, at least in some one or 2. of them: and so no doubt he would haue done, if he had byn able, whereby it appeareth that he erreth not of ignorance, but of meere malice, and impugneth a knowne truth against his owne conscience, and knowledge.
            71. Well then I will conclude concerning the 12. Fathers alledged by the Cardinall,
                  S. Aug. aduers. Iulian Pela. lib. 2. in Epilogo.
                and me, with the words of S. Augustine, defending the authority, and faith of 11. Fathers alledged by him against Iulian the Pelagi
                     •
                  n, who desired to haue Iudges of his cause. 
                  His igitur eloquijs, saith S. Augustine,
                  Saynt Augustins words to a Pelagian heretike fitly applyed to M. Andrews. 
                  &amp; tanta auctoritate Sanctorum &amp;c. therefore with these testimonyes, and so great authority of holy men, eyther thou wilt through Gods mercy be cured (which how much I desire, he seeth, whome I beseech to worke it) or if (which God forbid) thou still remayne in thy great folly (for so it is, though it seeme wisdome to thee) thou wilt not seeke Iudges, to the end to purge thy selfe, and try thy cause,

but to accuse the worthy, and famous Doctors of Catholyke verity, Irenaeus, Cyprian, Reticius, Olympius, Hilary, Gregory, Ambrose, Basil, Iohn, Innocent, and Hierome, with the rest of their fellowes yea the vniuersall Church of Christ, wherein they haue florished with exceeding great glory in our Lord, whyles they faithfully ministred the food of God to his diuine family, and therefore I will see that in respect of this thy miserable madnesse (from which God deliuer thee) thy bookes are to be answered in such sort that the fayth of these Fathers is to be defended agaynst thee, no lesse then the Ghospell it selfe against the professed enemyes of Christ. Thus sayth S. Augustine to Iulian, and the same say I to M. Andrews, with lyke harty desire of this good, leauing the application of the whole partly to the consideration of the discreet Reader, and partly to himselfe according to the light, and feeling he may haue thereof in his owne conscience.
            72. It resteth now that I say somewhat briefely to certayne trifling obiections which he maketh against the inuocation of Saynts out of Origen, S. Cyril, and S. Athanasius,
               Certayne trifeling obiections of M. Andrews out of Origen, S. Cyril, &amp; S. Athanasius.
                vrging the Cardinall to shew somewhat out of them to proue it to be lawfull, and particulerly out of Origen against Celsus, and S. Cyril against Iulian the Apostata, and out of Athanasius against the Arians, because he supposeth that those Fathers should in those their treatises haue taught that the inuocation of Saynts is lawfull, if they had byn of that opinion; and he addeth that the two former do flatly deny that Christians do honour Martyrs pari cultu, with equal honour to that which the Paynims gaue to their Heroes: wherein truly he hath great reason; and I will also add thereto that not only Origen, and S. Cyril, but

also S.
               
                  Nazianz. oratio. 1. in Iulian.
                
               Gregory Nazianzen, S.
               
                  S. Aug. de ciuita. Dei lib. 22. cap. 10. 
               Augustine, &amp; 
                  Theodoret de Graecor. affect. curat. cap. 8. 
               Theodoret, &amp; diuers other Fathers deny the same, as well as they, but what is that to the inuocation of Saynts, or yet to the honour that the Church doth to them in their feasts (which perhaps M. Andrews couertly impugneth by this obiection, though he speake expressely of nothing els but of the inuocation of Saynts) doth he not know that the Heroes were not only accounted Gods, but also honored as Gods with Sacrifice, which honour the Fathers do vterly deny to be giuen by Christians to Martyrs, and Saynts, though they highly approue the honour that is done vnto them in the Church, as to the beloued seruants of God.
            73. And now will M. Andrews inferre heereupon that Saynts may not be inuocated? me thinks he should not be simple; and if he say that those Fathers should at least vpon the same occasion haue taught that the inuocation of Saynts is lawfull, if they had held it so to be (for so indeed he seemeth to inferre) I haue 
                  See chap. 7. nu. 35.36. &amp; 37. already answered him sufficiently concerning this absurd manner of arguing, ab auctoritate negatiua, and therefore will only say vnto him heere, that I may with much more reason inferre the contrary vpon the same ground,M Andrews his argument retorted vpon himselfe. to wit that because those Fathers did not vpō that occasion teach the inuocation of Saynts to be vnlawfull, therefore they approued it; for reiecting the vnlawfull honour that the Paynims sayd was done to Martyrs, they had sufficient occasion to reiect also the inuocation of them, if they had held it to be vnlawfull. So as, you see, he gayneth nothing by this obiection out of Origen, and S
                     •
                   Cyril, but rather hurteth his cause, and bewrayeth his owne folly.
            74. But now in his other obiection out of Athanasius
               
he sheweth both folly, and fraud. For whereas he vrgeth the Cardinall to bring some testimony for the inuocation of Saynts out of the Orations of S. Athanasius against the Arians,
               M. Andrews frameth a very fraudulent obiection out of S. Athanasiu
                        •
                     .
                he pretendeth to find there, that the same is wholy excluded, and reiected, vbi, saith he, Christum ideo conuincit esse Deum, quòd inuocetur; praeter Deum enim à Christianis neminem inuocari, where Athanasius doth therefore conuince that Christ is God, because he is inuocated, for that Christians do inuocate none but God. So he; quoting for th
                  •
                same the second oration of S. Athanasius against the Arians;
                  Athana. orat
                        •
                     
                   
                  
                     ••
                  . where truly I fynd no such thing; true it is that in the 3. Oration he proueth substantially, and amply that Christ is God because he is adored, speaking playnly of that kind of adoration which is called Cultus latriae, and is due to God alone, as it is euident by the places of Scripture which he alledgeth to proue it; but of inuocation there is not one word, for ought I find, and though there were, yet it were as litle to the purpose, for that inuocation is also diuersly taken, as adoration is, and is applyed sometymes to God alone (in which sense it cannot be applyed to creatures) and sometymes to Angels, Saynts, or men, as I haue shewed euidently before in the 6. Chapter by examples of holy Scripture,
                  See before Chap. 6. nu. 2.3.4. &amp; 5. and the testimony of S. Augustine.
            
            75. Whereby it appeareth, that he is not only idle, and impertinent in this obiection,M. Andrews idle impertinent and fraudulēt. but also fraudulent; changing the word adoration into inuocation, if he did mistake the second oratiō of S. Athanasius for the third, and not of purpose falsify, and bely him in both; which I remit to God and his conscience to iudge of; and will now with this conclude this Chapter, and matter, not doubting
                  •
                
               good Reader, but thou hast noted throughout

the whole, that he hath neyther sufficiētly answered any one place of the Fathers alledged by the Cardinall, or any argument of his, neyther yet hath obiected any thing himselfe to any purpose, but hath eyther notably tryfled, and paltred in his answeres, and obiections, or egregiously peruerted, corupted, or falsifyed such Fathers, and authors as he hath had occasion to alledge.
            
               M. Andrews a true 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   and a wrangler, iuggler and tryfler in the hyghest degree.76. So as, I hope, I haue now performed that which I vndertooke in these 3. Chapters, which was to defend the Cardinall, and to proue M. Andrews to be a true 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , that is, an egregious wrangler, iangler, iuggler, and tryfler in the hyghest degree; and by the same occasion I haue also fully debated with him an important point of Catholike religion concerning the inuocation of Saynts, which I haue euidently proued to be most consonant to holy Scripture, practised by the primitiue Church, approued by the vniforme consent of the anciēt Fathers, most acceptable to God, honorable to him, and his Saynts, and finally very behouefull, and beneficiall to man. Whereby it may appeare that M. Andrews, and his fellowes, who so eagerly impugne it, are no other then the instruments, and proctors of the Diuell, who out of his extreme malice, and enuy to Angels, Saynts, and all mankind, seeketh by all the meanes he may, to depriue the Angels, and Saynts of their honour,M. Andrews the Diuells Proctor. and man of the inestimable benefits that he may reape, both spiritually, and temporally by their intercession; to which purpose he hath retayned, and feyed M. Andrews, as it seemeth by his diligent, and eloquent pleading the cause, and will, I feare me, one day pay him his fee in other money then he wilbe willing to receaue, except he open his eyes in tyme to see his danger, which I beseech God of his infinit mercy to giue him grace to do.
         
         
            
            THE CONCLVSION OF THIS ADIOYNDER, DEVIDED INTO TWO CHAPTERS. IN THIS, are detected diuers fraudes and shifts common to M. Andrews with M. Barlow; as to change the state of the question, to dissemble that which most importeth in the Cardinalls text and arguments; to abuse, wrest, bely and falsefy not only the Cardinall, but also the ancient Fathers, Councells, and holy Scriptures: and finally to face out matters impudētly for lack of proofs.
            CHAP. IX.
            
               THERE remaine, good Reader, diuers other thinges in M. Andrews to be examined which I haue touched in my Supplement:The authour forced to draw to an end. but being now called on by my printer to furnish his presse, I am forced not only to send away that which I haue already written, but also to interrupt

my designement in the prosecution of the rest; and therefore for as much, as I am now to draw to an end, I think good for the conclusion of the whole, to lay before thee sundrie sorts of shifts, cosenages, corruptions, &amp; frauds which he hath vsed throughout his whole worke; and to the end I may performe it with more breuity, and better method, I will follow the same course that I held with M. Barlow, That is, draw them to certaine 
                  •
               eades and giue thee some few examples of euery one, which being added to those that haue already occurred in this Adioynder, may suffice, I hope, to shew 
                  •
               hee with what kind of stuffe he hath patched vp his Latin volume, what a miserable cause he and his fellowes haue to defend, seing it driueth them to such shamefull shifts as thou hast partly seene already, and shalt further see by that which ensueth.
            2. The first point which I reproued in M. Barlow was his cōmon custome to change the state of the question,Changing the state of the question exemplified in the question of the Popes Primacy. and so to answere nothing to the purpose, which is no lesse frequent and ordinarie in M. Andrews: as for example, whereas the true state of the controuersy betwixt vs and them concerning the primacy of the Pope, is, Whether he be supreme head of the Church in all spirituall and Ecclesiasticall causes, and may in some cases extend his power to temporall thinges, that is to say, Whether being the supreme spirituall Pastor, he may for the publik benefit of the Church and the good of soules punish his disobedient children (namely temporall Princes) in their temporall 
                  See supl. chap. 1. nu. 59. &amp; seq.
               states (which I haue shewed in my Supplement to be a necessary consequent of his supreme spirituall power) M. Andrews will needes make vs hould and

teach that the Popes primacy is a temporall primacy, in which respect he 
                  Andr. cap. 1. pag. 17. linca. 4. calleth our doctrine and beliefe touching that point, illustrem fidei articulum de Primatu Petri temporali, The notable Article of Faith concerning the temporall Primacy of Peter: and as you heard 
                  Chap. 5. nu. 21. before distinguishing the name of Peters primacy (which he granteth) from the thing signified by that name (which he denyeth) he tearmeth it 
                  Cap. 8. pag 217. §. Inspiciam &amp; cap. 1. pag. 14. §. 1. 
               terrestrem Monarchiam, an earthly Monarchy, and therefore he vrgeth the Cardinall to proue this temporall primacy, and earthly Monarchy, and so impugneth no opinion of ours, nor any thing els but his owne fond fiction, as I haue shewed
                  Chap. 5. nu. 21. &amp; 22. before, and more amply in the 
                  See chap. 1. nu. 20. &amp; 2
                     •
                  . first Chapter of this Adioynder, and therfore I shall not need to stand any longer vpon this point heere, but will passe to another.
            3. Amongst other questions much controuersed concerning good works,Another example of the state of the question changed touching works of supererogation. one is, whether there be any works of supererogation, which the Catholyks vnderstand to be such as being lawfull and good of their owne nature, are not commanded by any precept (as for example, the Euangelicall Councells) in which sense Cardinall Bellarmine, and all other Catholikes do vse the word supererogation, as signifying a work done supra praeceptum, that is to say, more then the precept cō
               mandeth. But M. Andrewes impugneth it in another sense and so changeth the state of the question.
                  Andr. cap. 8. pag. 169. §. In supererogationis.
                For he will needs haue workes of Supererogation to be such good works only as are done after or besids the full accomplishment of the Commandment (so that before a man can do a worke of supererogation, he must fullfill and fully obserue all the precepts) whereupon he also inferreth, that no man can do any such works, no not

the Apostles themselues, because they could not fullfill the Commandments, hauing allwayes occasion to to say, Dimitte nobis debita nostra, forgiue vs Lord our offences.
            4. Wherein M. Andrews expressely impugneth not so much the Cardinall and other. Catholiks, as S. Augustine, and other ancient Fathers, from whome they take both the terme and the sense thereof. For whereas our Sauiour saith in the Ghospell, that the good Samaritan brought the wounded man into the Inne,
                  Luc. 10. and leauing two pence with the Host told him, quodcumque supererogaueris reddam tibi, whatsoeuer thou shalt lay out more I will render it vnto thee, S. Augustine alluding to the same place, and words of our Sauiour, teacheth euidently, that those things which are lawfull, id est,
               
                  S. Aug. lib. 
                  
                     •
                  . de adulter coniug. ad Pollent. cap. 14. sayth he, nullo praecepto Domini prohibentur, that is to say, which are not forbidden by any precept of our Lord, and are done, non praescripto legis, sed confi
                     •
                  io charitatis, not by the prescript or commandment of the law, but by the counsell of Charity, haec sunt, saith he, quae ampliùs exogantur saucio &amp;c. These are those works which are laied out more for the wounded man, who through the compassion of the Samaritan was brought to the Inne to be cured, and therefore they are said not to be commanded by our Lord, although they are aduised to be offered, to the end, that they may be vnderstood to be so much more gratfull, by how much more they are signifyed not to be due. So he.
            5. Also in another place he putteth the matter out of all doubt exemplyfying the same thus: Stbularius ergo est Apostolus.
               
                  Idem lib. 2. quaest. Euang. cap. 1
                     ••
                  
                
               Quod autem supererogat &amp;c. Therefore the host is the Apostle, And that which he layeth out more, is eyther that counsell whereof he saith, De Virginibus praeceptum

Domini non habeo, consilium autem do: Concerning virgines I haue no precept of our Lord, but I giue counsell. Or ells it is, that he wrought with his owne handes, least in the begining of the Ghospell he should be a burden to some of the weaker sort, when neuertheles it was lawfull for him to be fed or maintayned by the Ghospell. Thus sayth S. Augustine, clearly confuting M. Andrews his idle discourse; for to omit that he teacheth the vse of the word supererogation (which therefore was not deuised of late tyme and much lesse by the Catholiks of these dayes) first he sheweth that it signifieth such works, as being lawfull them selues are not comaunded by any precept, in which only sense Cardinall Bellarmine, and all other Catholyks vse it.
            6. Secondly he exemplifieth the same not only in the coūsell of Virginity (which is therfore a work of Supererogatiō
               ) but also in S. Paules owne practice of mayntayning himselfe by the labour of his hands, when he might haue liued by the Gospell; whereupon it followeth clearly that M. Andrews argueth very impertinently in saying, that the Apostles themselues could do no workes of Supererogation, because they had daily occasion to say, Dimitte nobis debita nostra. For I am sure M. Andrews will not deny that S. Paul was an Apostle, and yet S. Augustine affirmeth, as you see, that he not only taught works of Supererogatiō
                (namely Virginity, and continent single lyfe) but also practised &amp; performed them himselfe, doing such good workes as he was not bound to do by any precept. Besides that, it appeareth also hereby that a man may doe a work of Supererogation, though he haue occasion dayly to say Dimitte nobis debita nostra. Which therefore was an idle exception of M. Andrews against such workes, euen in the Apostles

themselues. Lastly wee see by these testymonyes of S. Augustine, and the example of S. Paul, that a work of supererogation is no other but such a good work as is not commanded by precept, and therfore it is euident that M. Andrews taking it in another sense changeth th
                  •
                state of the question.
            
               A third example of the state of the questiō changed. Car. Apol. pa. 107.7. Moreouer, whereas the Apology for the Oath accounteth the Adoration of the Bl. Sacrament of the Eucharist to be a new inuētiō, &amp; the Cardinall answering the same declareth the sense and meaning of the Catholiks concerning that point, saying, that they teach the Adoration of Christ our Lord present in the Sacrament &amp;c. M. Andrews replieth thus: In adoratione Sacramenti ad limen ipsum turpiter impingit &amp;c. In the Adoration of the Sacrament the Cardinall stumbleth shamefully,
               
                  Andr. cap. 8. pag. 195. §. In adora.
                
               euen at the first entrance. Of the Sacrament, saith he, that is to say of Christ our Lord in the Sacrament
                     •
                   Apage vero! Quis ei hoc dederit? Fy fy, who would grant him this? The Sacrament, that is to say,
               
                  Lib. 4. cap. 34. de consecrat. 2. Hoc ergo.
                
               Christ in the Sacrament, but rather Christ himselfe (who is the thing conteyned in the Sacrament) is to be adored wheresoeuer he is, i
                     •
                  , with, or without the Sacrament. The King houldeth that Christ is truly in the Eucharist, and truly to be adored, that is to say, the thing of the Sacrament, but not the Sacrament, I meane the earthly part, as Irenaeus calleth it, &amp; the visible according to Augustine. So he.
            8. Wherein I omit for the present to note what he granteth concerning our Catholyk doctrine (wherof I shall haue occasion to speake more particulerly 
                  Chap. 10. nu. 4. hereafter) and I only wish to be obserued, how manifestly &amp; wittingly (no doubt) he changeth the state of the questiō, notwithstanding the Cardinalls owne explicatiō therof, who signifieth, that for as much as Christ
               
is truly, and really present in the Sacrament, therefore Christ himselfe is adored therein, and not the bare Sacrament: though the Cardinall, I say, doth declare this, yet M. Andrews will needs presuppose that wee hold and teach that the bare Sacrament or formes of bread and wyne are to be adored, for els why doth he make distinction of the Sacrament, and the thing of the Sacrament, granting the adoration of the one, and not of the other, but denying the later, as our opinion, as though we affirming that the Sacrament of the Eucharist is to be adored, should meane it only of the exteriour formes? As well might he say, that he which teacheth that Christ is to be adored, meaneth it of his humanity, and not of his diuinity; for who knoweth not that the Sacrament of the Eucharist conteyneth not only the Sacramēt (that is to say the exteriour formes of bread, &amp; wine) but also the thing of the Sacramēt, which is our Sauiour Christ, as the person of Christ conteyneth as well his Diuinity, as his humanity. And therefore he that adoreth his person doth adore his Diuinity vnited with his humanity, and not his humanity alone.
            9. For otherwise he that should adore Christ Cultu latriae,
               
                  S. Ambros. lib. 3 de spiritu S. cap. 12. should commit Idolatry. And as well S. Ambrose (when he saith, Carnem Christi in mysterijs odoramus, Wee adore the flesh of Christ in the mysteries) as also S. Augustine (saying,
                  S. Aug. in Psa
                        •
                     m. 98. 
               Nemo illam carnem manducat nisi prius adorauerit, No man eates that flesh but he adoreth it first) should teach Idolatry, if they should be vnderstood to speake of the flesh of Christ alone separated from his Diuinity. In which repect M. Andrewes himselfe approueth that manner of speach in those two Fathers, yea, and afterwards explicateth the same himselfe very well out of S. Augustine, saying, the humanity

it selfe of Christ (as S. Augustine disputeth) is not to be adored by it selfe,
               
                  Andr. vbi supra pag. 201. 
               but vnited with the Diuinity, as the Kings purple, or Royall robe, when he is vested or clad with it, and not when it lyeth by it selfe alone. Thus saith M. Andrewes: and the lyke exposition might he haue made of adoring the Blessed Sacrament of the Eucharist, if his peruerse, wrangling, and cauiling humour would haue permitted him to acknowledge what is our Catholik doctrine in this point, which he could not but knowe in his conscience, for that I am sure he neuer read, nor heard tell of any Catholik, who taught or thought that the bare Sacramēt in the Eucharist I meane the exteriour forme, is to be adored without Christs presence, or in respect of it selfe. And this may suffice for this point.
            
               A fourth example of the state of the question changed, cōcerning the veneration of holy reliques.10. I may adde the lyke concerning another point, wherein M. Andrewes chargeth the Cardinall to change the state of the question, I meane touching the reuerence and honor that is and allwayes hath byn done in the Catholik Church to the holy reliques of Saynts. For whereas the Apology for the Oath condemneth it for a new and false, yea an abhominable doctrine, and the Cardinall in his answere thereto, so amply and euidently proueth it out of the Ancient Fathers that it cannot be denyed, M. Andrews hath no other refuge but to take hould of the word Adoration vsed by the Apology,
                  Card. Apolog. cap. 1. pag. 12.13.14.15.16.17. &amp; 18. vnderstanding it for worship due to God alone, and exacting of the Cardinall some proofe that such adoration is due to reliques, as though Catholiks were of that opinon; wheras nether the Cardinall, nor any other Catholike doth apply that word to reliques in that sense, but vse it for reuerence and veneration due to holy men, or holy things, as the Cardinall

himselfe signifieth in plaine and expresse words. So that if the said Apology do impugne the adoration of Reliques, in the other sense (meaning the exhibition of diuine honour thereunto) it doth not any way impugne our doctrine,A strange peruersity but changeth the state of the question, as well as M. Andrewes, though so absurdly as he who doth not only vnderstand the Adoration of Reliques to signify a diuine honor done vnto them, but also will needs proue no adoration of creatures is lawfull.
            11. To which purpose he alledgeth the example of the Angell in the Apocalyps,
                  Apocal. 1
                     •
                  . &amp; 22. who when Saynt Iohn the Euangelist would haue adored him twice, forbad him to do it at both tymes, saying, Vide ne feceris, Deum adora,

                     .
                See that thou doest it not, adore God. Whereupon he inferreth, that seeing S. Iohn could not be ignorant (especially the second tyme) that the Angell was not God, and yet would haue adored him, it followeth that he (I meane S. Iohn) did not intend to adore him with adoration due to God alone, but with such (saith M. Andrews) as the Cardinall supposeth may be vsed to Angells, holy men, or sacred thinges, and yet neuerthelesse the Angell would not permit it,
                  Andr. ibidem pag. 5
                     •
                  . and therefore in M. Andrews his opinion no such adoration is lawfull, for, Nec est, saith he, Angelorum ratio alia, alia Sanctorum &amp;c. For in this there is no difference betwixt the adoration of Angells, and of Saynts of holy men
                     •
                   neyther is there more respect to be had to reliques thē to those whose reliques they are. So he. Not admitting, as you 
                  •
               ee, any adoration of Angells or Saynts, though it be not meant thereby to exhibit diuine honour vnto them, but only to do an act of veneratiō, reuerēce or religioꝰ worship; and why? Many forsooth because the Angell would

not suffer S. Iohn the Apostle to adore him in that māner.
            12. Wherein two thinges are to be noted, the one, what a poore conceipt M. Andrews hath of S. Iohn whome he maketh to be so ignorant that he knew not whether such adoration were lawfull or no,M. Andrews hath a poore conceipt of S. Iohn the Euangelist vntill the Angell did instruct him, and forbad him to vse it. The other that he reasoneth as substantially as if he should say, that if a holy man should of modesty and humility. refuse some extraordinary honour offred vnto him by some other holy person, and byd him not to do it to him, but to God, hee must needs meane that no such kind of reuerence, or honor may be done to men; for such no doubt was the case betwixt S. Iohn and the Angell,
               Why the Angel in the Apocalips did forbid S. Iohn to adore him eyther of them shewing their humility, and the respect they bare the one to the other, S. Iohn reuerencing the Angell as a Celestiall creature to whome he held himselfe much inferiour, and the Angell bearing much respect, and reuerence to S. Iohn as to the most worthy and beloued Apostle of Christ, who was Lord and maister to them both, and therefore acknowledging himselfe to be no other but conseruum,

Victore, and Rupertus do giue also another reason thereof to wit, that the Angell bare respect euen to humane nature, in regard of the humanity of our Sauiour. Hinc est, saith S.

            13. But for the further satisfaction and instruction of the vnlearned reader in this point,Three sorts of adoration mentioned in the Scriptures he is to vnderstand that there are three kindes of adoration specified in the holy Scripture. The first is that which is due to God alone, and is called by Deuines Adoratio Latriae, that is to say, an adoration, or exteriour worship exhibited  by some corporall reuerence, and submission to acknowledge our duety and seruice to God, as he is our Creatour, Conseruatour, and Chiefe good, and this adoration is so due proper vnto God alone, that it is Idolatry to exhibit the same vnto any Creature. Of this kind the Scripture speaketh when it saith 
                  Matth 4. 
               Dominum Deum tuum adorabis, &amp; illi soli seruies. Thou shalt adore thy Lord God, and serue him alone. Also, Non

                  •
                The second kind of adoration, though it be  inferiour to this, yet is also an act of Religion, exhibited in like manner exteriourly to Angells, Saynts or holy men, as to the seruants of God, and for the honor and loue of him: of which kind many examples are set downe in holy Scriptures, as of 
                  Genes. 18.

            16. Hereby then it is euident, that according to the vse and phrase of the holy Scripture,Adoration is vnderstood diuersly according to the circūstances. the word Adoration is to be vnderstood diuersly as it is diuersly applied eyther to God alone, or to Angells, holy men, and holy thinges, or els to men of dignity and the same is also obserued in the hebrew word Sachah which signifieth Adorare, and is diuersly vnderstood of each of these three kindes of Adoration, according to the different application thereof
                  •
                in so much that it cannot otherwise be distinguished but by the circumstances. So as it is no meruaile, that as well the ancient Fathers as the Catholiks of these dayes, following the custome of the holy Scriptures do vse the word Adoration in the same different manner and s
                  •
               nse, that the Scripture doth. But it may be wondered that M. Andrews being so great a Doctor, and R

                  bin, as he is taken to be, can eyther be so ignorant as not to know this, or so peruerse and malicious (if he know it) as to contend and striue to proue that there can be no lawfull Adoration but of God alone.
            17. And therefore for as much as he hath sought to make good his Assertion, not only by the example of the Angell in the Apocalyps before mentioned, but also by two or three testimonyes of the Fathers (yea gybing, bragging, and triumphing, in such sort as if

he had vtterly foyled the Cardinall) I cannot omit to say somwhat thereto,

Hierome doth not vse adorare there properly, but figuratiuely: and thereof he yieldeth two reasons, the one because in the same place he sayth also, that she might puluerem lingere, lick the dust, Quare vt hoc, ita &amp; illud non propriè, sed figuratè. Wherefore as this, so also that is not spoken properly, but figuratiuely. Thus reasoneth M. Andrews, and by the way addeth out of his scoffing humour: At nec vos puluerilingi estis; But neyther you your selues are dust-lickers, meaning as I take it, that we must eyther be dust-lickers, or els take adorare figuratiuely in that place.
            
               A iest of M. Andrews spoyled.18. But truly he hath spoiled his iest by mistaking the phrase, whereupon he groundeth it, for puluerem lingere, is not in all that Epistle, for ought I can find, though I haue read it ouer of purpose; but some lines before there is indeed, Crucis lignum lambere, to like the wood of the Crosse, and therefore if he will make himselfe as merry with vs, and with this phrase, as he doth with that other, he must say wee are not Crucilambi, Crosse-lickers, or rather to expresse the whole and make a merry word indeed he must say Cruci-ligni-lambi, Crosse-wood-lickers; but howsoeuer it pleaseth him to be merrie, I must tell him seriously, that I will not so easely grant him, that Crucis lignum lambere, was spoken there

This Adoration (which the Cardinall saith is due to holy thinges) may perhaps be so called by the figure Catachresis,

            20. But will M. Andrews say, that there is such want of proper wordes for the Veneration of Angells, Saynts, and men, that the penners and translatours of the holy Scriptures were forced in all those places mentioned before, to abuse a word that is proper to God? Might not honorare &amp; venerari haue serued to expresse their meaning, if adorare were only to be vnderstood of diuine honour? Besides that, I must needs say that the matter goeth very hard with Abraham, Lot, Iosue, Balaam, the Children of the Prophets, and all those others before mentioned (who are said in the Scriptures

to haue adored Angells and men) their case, I say, is hard

Andrews his corrupt Conscience,M. Andrews his corrupt conscience. who maketh no scruple to abuse and delude his Reader with such shifts and deuises, to bolster out his bad cause. Thus much for his first reason.
            21. His second reason why adorare is taken figuratiuely in that place of S. Hierome is this
                  •
                
               
                  Vbi vero saith he,
                     Andr. vbi supra.
                   
                  propriè ei loquendum erat &amp;c.
                  For when S. Hierome was to speake properly, to wit, to Vigilantius his aduersary (who pressed him strictly, and would not suffer him to speake at large (then he denyeth it earnestly, saying, Nos autem, non dico, Martyrum reliquias &amp;c. We do not worship and adore (I do not say) the Reliques of Martyrs, but neyther the Sunne nor the Moone, nor the Angells, nor the Cherubim, nor the Seraphim.
                Thus saith M. Andrews out of S. Hierome, ending his citation there; because that which followeth would marre all his market, as you shall see after a while, and in the meane tyme he concludeth thus, What I pray you will the Cardinall say

here, seeing that the old Fathers of the Church do crie out we do not adore the reliques of Martyrs?
               M. Andrews tryumpheth when he hath lost the victory. 
               heere the Cardinall is held so fast that he cannot slip away.
Thus triumpheth M. Andrews before the victory, or rather hauing lost the victory, being himselfe a Captiue, and hauing no other remedy left him, but to brag and face out the matter.
            22. For thou shalt vnderstand good Reader, that S. Hierome here speaketh (as the Logicians say) ad hominem, that is to say according to the sense and meaning of his aduersary Vigilantius (one of M. Andrews his worthy progenitours) who impugning the adoration of reliques in the same sense that M. Andrews doth,Vigilantius M. Andrews his progenitor. held it for no other then Idolatry, as S. Hierome testifieth in the same Epistle to Riparius, which M. Andrews alledgeth. Ais, saith S. Hierome,
               
                  S. Hier. ad Riparium.
                
               Vigilantius &amp;c. you say, that Vigilantius (as we may say M. Andews) openeth againe his stinking mouth, and casteth forth a most filthy sauour against the Reliques of holy Martyrs, and calleth vs, who reuerence them, and worship the bones of the dead, Cinerarios, &amp; Idololatras, worshipers of Ashes, &amp; Idolators.
               
                  Idem li. aduers. Vigilantium.
                
               So he. And in his tract against Vigilantius himselfe, he setteth downe Vigilantius his owne words thus, Quid n
                     •
                  cesse est &amp;c. What need hast thou not only to honour with so greate honour, but also to adore that (I knowe not what) which thou worshipest, carrying it in a litle vessell from place to place, and why doest thou kisse and adore dust lapt in a linnen cloth? And againe a litle after, We see you, according to the custome of the Gentils &amp;c. euery where kisse and adore I knowe not what litle dust carried in a litle vssell, and lapt in a precious linnen cloth. Thus wrote Vigilantius.
            
            23. Whereby you see how he charged the Catholicks

of those daies with flat Idolatry, for worshipping, or adoring the Reliques of Saynts, taking adoration for worship due to God alone, in which respect he calleth the Catholicks Idolators. And therefore S. Hierome answering him in the same sense, saith that which M. Andrews alleadgeth,
                  S. Hierom explicated by himselfe. to wit, non adoramus reliquias Martyrum &amp;c. We do not adore the reliques of Martyrs (that is to say, we do not giue diuine honor to the reliques of Martyrs, committing Idolatry as Vigilantius chargeth vs:
                  Idem ibidem.
               ) But, honoramus (saith he presently afterwards) reliquias Martyrum, vt eum cuius sunt Martyris adoremus &amp;c. We honor the Reliques of Martyrs, that we may adore (or yield diuine honor to) him whose Martyres they are.
               The honour done to Gods seruants for his sake, redoundeth to God. 
               Honoramus serous &amp;c. We honour the seruants, to the end that their honor may redound to the honour of their Lord, who said, he which receiueth you, receiueth me. Thus saith S. Hierome; which M. Andrews thought good to dissemble, as if he had not seeme it, for that it fully explicateth the state of the questiō betwixt S. Hierome &amp; Vigilantius (as also betwixt M. Andrews &amp; vs) &amp; cleareth all the matter. For who seeth not heere that albeit S. Hierome denyeth the adoration of Reliques in the sense that Vigilantius obicted it, as we also do (to wit as signifying a diuine honor) yet he approueth and teacheth it in the sense of Catholiks, that is, as adoration signifieth a veneration and worship done to Saynts, for the honor of God who is honored &amp; glorified thereby.
            24. To which purpose two things are to be noted in this matter, the one, that whereas Vigilantius chargeth the Catholicks to adore and kisse euery where the R
                     •
                  liques of Martyrs, he shewed sufficiently, that the custome of the faithfull was at that tyme to do corporall reuerence thereto, not only by kissing them, but

also by inclyning or bowing downe the body, which the word adoration signifieth, and S. Hierome denyeth not, though he denyeth the inference of Idolatry, that Vigilantius made thereon.
            25. The other is, that as Vigilantius did not herein reproue the particuler custome of some particuler men, but the practice of the whole Church at that tyme; so also S. Hierome did not impugne him only with priuate reasons and arguments of his owne, but also with publick examples, as of the publick translation of the holy Reliques of S. Andrew, S. Luke, and S. Timothy to Constantinople by Constantin the Emperour,
                  S. Hiero
                        •
                     . vbi supr
                        ••
                     
                  
                
               apud quas, saith he, Daemones rugiunt &amp;c. at which reliques Diuells do rore, and the inhabitors and prossessors of Vigilantius do confesse that they feele their presence. So he. And then produceth also another example that had passed not long before of a most solemne translation of the Reliques of Samuel the Prophet from Iudaea to Chalcedon in Thracia, which were sumptuously and triumphantly carried by Bishops in a goulden vessell, and met, receiued, and accompanied by the people of all the Churches by the way (in so much that there were, saith S. Hierome, continuall swarmes of people euen from Palestina to Chalcedon, sounding forth the praise of Christ with one voice all a long as they went:Mark 
                     •
                  hi
                     •
                   reason of S. Hierome.) whereupon he asketh Vigilantius, whether he tooke Arcadius the Emperour (who caused this to be done) and all the Bishops which caried these reliques, and all the multitude of people which accompanied them, for sacrilegious persons and fooles, and finally concludeth, deryding his folly, Videlicet, saith he, adorabant Samuelem, non Christum, cuius Samuel &amp; Leuita &amp; Propheta fuit. Belike they adored Samuel, and not Christ, whose Leuite and Prophet

Samuel was. This saith S. Hierome, shewing the absurdity of Vigilantius, who did thinke that Christ was not adored in all this, but only Samuel. Whereas all the reuerence, honor, &amp; adoration vsed by those Bishops, and people to the Reliques of Samuel, was indeed done to Christ, because (as S. Hierome said before) seruorum honos redundat ad Dominum: The honor of the seruants redoundeth to their Lord.
            
            26. So that S. Hierome doth not deny, that holy reliques may be adored in any other sense, then as M. Andrewes (following his progenitor Vigilantius) will needs vnderstand the word adoration, that is, for a diuine Cult, and worship, in which sense neyther S. Hierome nor the Catholiks in his tyme, nor we now do vse, or take it, when it is applied to holy things, but only for a deuout and religious veneration, as S. Hierome himselfe doth also vse it, not only in the place before cited by the Cardinall (touching the adoratiō
                of the ashes of S. Iohn, and other Prophets) but also when he said of himselfe,
                  S. Hierom. lib. 2. Apol aduersus Ruffin.
                
               Praesepe Domini &amp; incunabula adoraui. I adored the manger, and cradle of Christ: and againe expounding that verse of the Psalme, adorate scabellum pedum eius, adore the Foot-stole of his Feet, he taketh the Foot-stoole to be the Crosse,
               
                  Idem in Psalm. 98. giuing thereby to vnderstand that the Crosse is to be adored. And therefore I leaue it to thee, good Reader, to iudge what a vaine vaunt it was of M. Andrews to say vpon the former place of S. Hierome, Tenetur hic Cardinalis vt elabi non possit: hecre the Cardinall is taken, and held so fast, that he cannot slip away. Whereas you see, that the whole place and the circumstances, being laied downe with the state of the question betwixt Vigilantius and S. Hierome (all which he craftily concealed) he is caught himselfe

lyke a mouse in a trappe in such sort that he shall neuer be able to get out with his credit.
            27.A place of S. Augustine and S. Ambrose examined. But yet there remaineth a word or two more to be said of this matter to a place of S. Augustine, and S. Ambrose, which he also obiecteth to the same purpose. For whereas those two Fathers interpreting the wordes of the psalme, adorate scabellum pedum eius, Adore yee the Foot-stoole of his Feete, do expound the foot-stoole to be the body of our Sauiour in the Blessed Sacrament of the Eucharist,

                      Sancto. c. 12. teaching that the same is there to be adored, M. Andrews saith, that if adorare might be taken properly to adore holy thinges, they would neuer haue troubled themselues so much to find out how the Footstool of God might be adored: neyther would they haue determined that it could not be adored but in the body of Christ:
                  Bellar. de Sanctor. Beatit. lib. 2. cap. 13. Whereto I answere, first
                  •
                that they do not expound the same litterally, but mystically; for scabellum Dei, the Foot-stoole of God, in that place, is litterally to be vnderstood of the Arke of the Testamēt, as the Cardinal hath proued by many notable reasō

                in his Cōtrouersys, wherto I remit M. Andrews, because I will not detayne my reader too long vpon this point.
            28. Secondly I say, that albeit they vnderstood adoration in that place for diuine honour, yet they do not deny but that it is, and well may be taken in other places,
                  S. Aug. de ciuitate Dei li. 10. cap. 1. for a religious worship, done to holy men; for S. Augustine himselfe teacheth expressely in his booke de Ciuitate Dei, that there is no one word in Latin that so properly signifieth diuine honor, or worship, but it is, and may be applied to creatures, except Latria, which is borrowed of the Greeks, and applyed eyther alwayes, sayth S. Augustine, or almost allwayes, to the seruice of God, rather by custome and

vse, then by the nature of the word, properly signifying seruitus, seruice. For which cause hauing in his questions vpon Genesis demanded, how Abraham could lawfully adore the Children of Heth, seeing the Scripture sayth,
                  Matth. 4. 
               Dominum Deum tuum adorabis, &amp; illi soli seruies. Thou shalt adore thy Lord God, and serue him alone, he answereth that it is not said there, Deum solum adorabis, Thou shalt adore God alone, but, illi soli seruies thou shalt serue him alone, and noteth also, that for the word seruies in Latine, the Greeke hath 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , from whence is deriued Latria. So that it is euident by S. Augustine himselfe, that neyther adorare, nor any other Latine word doth properly signify to worship God only, and that adoratio when it is not taken for cultus Latriae (as he taketh it in the exposition of Adorate scabellum &amp;c.) may be applyed to creatures; and therefore he himsefe not only vnderstandeth adoratiō
                for ciuil worship in the foresaid example of Abraham,
               
                  Idem ser. 25 de Sanctis.

               29. S. Ambrose also made no doubt to apply it to the veneration, and worship of holy things, who speaking of the Nayle of Christs Crosse (which Queene Helen caused to be set in the Diadem of the Emperour Constantin her sonne) sayd, that she did wysely therein, vt Crux Christi adoretur in regibus, that the Crosse of Christ may be adored in Kings; and to shew that he spake of religious worship, &amp; adoration, &amp; not of ciuill honour due to kings, he addeth immediatly, non insolentia ista, sed pietas est, cùm defertur sacrae redemptioni, This is

not insolency, but piety, when

               o be noted by the way, that M. Andrewes may learne hereby how impertinently he answereth els where to this place alledged by Cardinall Bellarmine; for whereas the Cardinall (to proue the religious adoration of reliques, and images) obiecteth out of S. Ambrose this very place (to wit that Queene Helen did well, and wisely cause the Crosse to be set vpon the head of Kings, to the end that the Crosse of Christ may be adored in Kings) M. Andrews answereth,
                  Andr. cap. 8. p. 198. §. Ambrosio.
                that if the Crosse be adored in Kings, nō aliter adoratur &amp;c. it is not otherwyse adored then the Kings thems

                  lues: is autem ciuilis honos est, non religiosus, but this is a ciuil, and not religious honour. So he: but you see heere that the adoration whereof S. Ambrose speaketh, is not due, or giuen to the Kings themselues, but referred to our redemption, that is to say, to the Passion of Christ, and therefore it is not ciuil, but religious adoration, which also appeareth more euidently by that which followeth a litle after in S. Ambrose, declaring what manner of reuerence was exhibited to the holy Nayle of the Crosse; for hauing sayd, Ecce clauus in honore est &amp;c. behold the Nayle is honored &amp;c. and that, inuisibili potestate daemones torquet,
               
                  S. Ambros vbi supra.
                
               it doth torment diuels by an inuisible power, he addeth after a whyle

               ferro pedum eius reges inclinantur; reges adorant, &amp; Photinians diuinitatem eius negant? Kings do bow downe to the iron of his feete (that is to say to the nayle wherewith Christs feete were fastened to the Crosse) Kings do adore, and doe the Photinian heretikes deny his diuinity? thus saith S. Ambrose, making, as you see, the adoration of the instruments of our Sauiours Passion, to be an argument of his diuinity, and shewing withall what manner of

reuerence Kings themselues vsed to the holy Nayle, to wit, a corporall reuerence, and submission, inclyning and bowing downe their bodyes vnto it, which is properly Adoration.
            
            30. Whereby the Reader may also see the absurdity of another euasion which M. Andrews seeketh in the same place,
                  Andr. vbi supra. Ambros. de obitu Theod.
                saying: vbi de religiosa adoratione sermo illi &amp;c. where he (to wit Ambrose) speaketh of religious adoration, he sayth, that Helen hauing found the Crosse adored the King (that is to say Christ) and not the wood, whereof he also declareth the cause, to wit, because this is the errour of the gentils, and the vanity of wicked men. So he; who in these very words of S. Ambrose, which he obiecteth, may see, and acknowledg, if it please him, what all Catholikes do teach togeather with S. Ambrose concerning the adoration of the Crosse, and other instruments of Christs Passion, Images, and holy relicks, to wit, that the wood, substance, and matter it selfe is not adored, but that which is thereby represented: as in like case, when M. Andrews standeth bare in the Chamber of Presence before the Kings chayr, &amp; Cloth of Estate, he doth nor reuerence the matter, or substance of the Cloth and Chayre, but the Maiesty of the Prince which the same doth represent, and yet neuertheles he cannot deny, but that he reuerenceth, and honoureth the Kings Chayre, though not for it selfe, but to shew, and expresse his duty towards his Prince; and in like manner, albeit S. Ambrose affirmeth with great reason, that Queene Helen did not adore the wood of the Crosse, but Christ (because to adore the wood alone, without relation to Christ, had byn a wicked, and Gentilicall vanity, and errour) yet he saith afterwards, as you haue heard, not only that the

Crosse is adored, but also that ferro pedum eius reges inclinantur, Kings do bow downe to the Iron of Christs feete, meaning the holy Nayle, as I haue declared before; and therefore M. Andrewes must needs graunt, that though S. Ambrose do reiect (as all Catholikes also do) the adoration of the bare wood and Iron of the Crosse, and Nayle in respect of themselues, yet he admitteth, and approueth the adoration of them, with relation to our Sauiours Passion, cùm defertur (as he speaketh) sacrae Redemptioni, when the honour is referred to our holy Redemption.
            31. This then being so,Three things gathered out of the premises. 3. thinges follow vpon the premises. The first, that S. Augustine and S. Ambrose affirming that the Foot-stoole of God could not be adored, if it were not vnderstood of the Blessed body of our Sauiour in the Eucharist, do speake only of adoratio  latriae, that is to say the adoration which is due to God alone, and therefore they alledge the wordes of our Sauiour, Dominum Deum tuum adorabis, &amp; illi soli seruies: thou shalt adore thy God and serue him alone.
               
                  Matth. 1
                     •
                  
                In which wordes adoration is precisely to be vnderstood of diuine honour, and yet so, that S. Augustine (as you haue heard) gathereth thereby, that there is also an inferiour adoration which may be exhibited to creatures, and therefore he noteth that our Sauiour said not, Deum solum  adorabis, thou shalt adore God alone. The second consequent is, that M. Andrewes hath wholy failed of his purpose, which was to proue that adoration of Reliques must needs be vnderstood to signify a diuine and godly honor done to Reliques, whereof I haue clearely proued the contrary, notwithstanding his obiections, which I haue shewed to be partly friuolous, and partly  fraudulent. The third is, that he sheweth himselfe to be

Barlow, was that he vsed to dissemble and omitt many tymes the most important part of his aduersaries obiections, and answeres, which kind of fraudulent dealing is no lesse ordinary in M. Andrews, though neuerthelesse in his Preface to the Reader he promiseth to set downe in his Margent the Cardinalls owne words and text, and albeit he confesseth that other whiles he contracteth, or abridgeth the same when place and paper wanteth, and that sometymes he leaueth out and cutteth off some wordes, quae abesse poterant, which might well be spared,

                yet he assureth his Reader, that he will allwaies set downe those words wherein the whole force of the Cardinalls meaning and intent consisteth, in such sort, Vt nihil pereat de argumenti pondere, that there shall vant nothing of the weight of his argument. Thus promiseth he, but how well he performeth it we shall easely perceiue by those two or three examples

following. For though I might lay downe many more, yet I am forced to keep my selfe within certayne limits to auoyd prolixity.
            33. The Cardinall to proue that the Article of the Creed concerning the remission of sinnes, is not admitted and receiued in England as it ought to be, sayth thus: Veram peccatorum remissionem credere non potest &amp;c. he cannot belieue that there is true remission of sinnes,
               
                  Card. in Apol. cap. 7. pag. 84. lin. 19. 
               who belieueth, as the new Sectaries do, that sinnes do allwayes remayne in man, though he be iustified, albeit they be not imputed. For the Apostle did not say in the Creed, I belieue that sinnes are not imputed,
               The argument of Cardinall Bellarmine. 
               but, I belieue the Remission of sinnes, that is to say, true and full remission; otherwise the offence of the first man Adam which did truly and properly infect all his ofspring, should be of greater force then the grace of the second man, that is to say Christ, which could not truly and properly purge or make cleane those that are borne againe in him. Thus sayth the Cardinall: who you see groundeth the force of his reason partly vpon the expresse words of the Creed, and partly vpon a comparison of the offence of Adam, and the grace of Christ, shewing that if sinnes be not truly remitted, the grace, and merits of Christ shall not be so powerfull to clense vs from sinne,
                  Rom. 3
                     •
                  
                as the fall of Adam was to infect vs therewith, which cannot be said without extreme iniury to our Sauiour.
            34. And this is not the Cardinalls owne argument but taken from the Apostle himselfe, and therefore being most important, it deserued to be set downe and answered by M. Andrews, who neuertheles doth not eyther alleadg it in his margent with the rest of the Cardinalls text,
                  Andr. ca. 7. p. 162. §. S

                     d neque.
                or so much as mention it in his answere, but maketh the Cardinall say only this, Neque

veram remissionem peccatorum &amp;c. Neyther can he belieue the true remission of sinnes, which belieueth, as the new Sectaries do, that sinnes do allwaies remaine in man, though he be iustified, albeit they be not imputed. Thus farre doth M. Andrewes alledge the Cardinalls text, leauing out his arguments wherein consisteth the proofe of his assertion, and insteed of answering the same, he vrgeth an ordinary and stale obiection out of the Psalmist,
               
                  Psal. 31. and the Apostle to the Romanes,
               
                  Rom. 4. to proue that sinnes are not forgiuen, but only discouered, and not imputed.
            
            35. But this hath bene answered a hundreth tymes so fully, that he may be ashamed to vrge the same still and not to take so much as knowledg of the answere,M. Andrews bringeth in stale arguments and dissembleth their answers. though neuertheles Cardinall Bellarmine gaue him sufficient occasion to do it euen in this place, remitting his Reader to his Controuersies, as indeed he had great reason to do, for that he hath there substantially and clearely proued the Catholike doctrine in this point, and confuted all the aduersaries arguments, and particulerly answered those obiections which M. Andrews bringeth heere concerning the couering of sinne and not imputing it; which phrases and manner of speach the Cardinall teacheth to signify a full remission of sinne, and this he proueth not only by solid arguments deduced out of the holy Scripture, but also by the interpretation of the ancient Fathers, as of S.

                  Esay ca 1. 
               If your sinnes shall be lyke scarlet, they shall be made as whyte as snow.

               immaculate, and irreprehensible coram ipso, before him, or in his sight. In all which you see the holy Ghost teacheth such a full and perfect remission, and vtter abolition of sinne (to our exceeding comfort) that if a man should studie and deuise wordes and phrases to signify, and perswade the same, it were not possible to do it more effectually. And yet all these places being so euident as you see, must be vnderstood forsooth (say our aduersaries) of couering or hiding sinne,
               What the Psalmist meant by not imputation of sinne. or not imputing it, because the Scripture somtymes vseth such manner of speaches, though reason would, that the more rare and obscure phrases should be expounded by the more frequent and cleare, especially in this place of the Psalme alledged by M. Andrews, which the Psalmist himselfe doth sufficiently explicate, who hauing said: Blessed is the man to whome God hath not imputed sinne, addeth immediatly, Nec est in Spiritu eius dolus; Nor any deceipt is in his spirit, or soule: whereby he signifieth plainly, that mans sinnes are then couered, and not imputed, when his soule is cleare, or free from sinne.
            
               38. And now to returne to the Cardinals argument dissembled and omitted by M. Andrews,
               The aboundāce of Christ his grace, worketh a true and inherent Iustification in vs. the same doth notably confirme all this, for that it inuincibly proueth a reall, and inherent Iustification in vs, consisting in a true remissiō of sinne, &amp; a true sanctificatiō groūded vpon the plenitude, &amp; fullnes of Christs merits, and the aboundance of grace which we receiue therby according to the expresse Doctrine of the Apostle, saying, Si enim vniusdelicto mors regnauit per vnū &amp;c. If by one mans fault,
               
                  Rom. 5. 
               death hath reigned by one, much more those which receiue aboundance of grace, and of the guift, and of the Iustice, shall reigne in life by one Iesus Christ. In which wordes it is to be noted that the Apostle speaking of Iustification doth plainly exclude, and reiect the imputation of Iustice, making expresse mē
               tion of a righteousnes, which we receiue aboundantly with grace, and a guift giuen vs by Almighty God; which aboundance of Grace and Iustice, being giuen vs, and receiued by vs, must needes be really in vs, and make vs truly iust. And this is much more euident by that which followeth, Sicut enim, saith the Apostle,
                  Ibidem.
                
               per inobedientiam vnius hominis &amp;c. for euen as by the disobedience of one man, many sinners were made, so by the obedience of one man, many iust shall be made.
            
            39. Thus saith the Apostle, who, as you see, compareth, or rather opposeth Christ to Adam, and our Iustification giuen vs by Christ, to the death of the soule, or damnation purchased for vs by Adam, concluding that we are made as truly iust by Christ, as wee were truly sinners by Adam, which he also enforceth and vrgeth in the same place,
                  Rom. 5. saying: Si enim vnius delicto multi mortui sunt &amp;c. For if by one mans fault many haue died, much more the grace of God, and the guift in the

grace of one man Iesus Christ, hath abounded vnto more mē, wherby the Apostle signifieth not, that more are iustified by Christ, then haue died, or byn condemned by Adam (which in the Greeke is manifest, where insteed of plures, more men, we read 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , many men) but that Christs grace was more abundant, and of greater force to iustifie vs, then Adams sinne was to make vs sinners, and to condemne vs, which he confirmeth also afterward saying: Vbi abundauit delictum superabundauit gratia: VVhere the fault abounded, grace hath byn much more aboundant.
            
            40. Whereupon the Cardinall inferreth with the Blessed Apostle, that seeing the sinne of Adam was of force to make vs truly sinners, the merits and grace of Christ are of far greater force to purge, and cleanse vs from our sinnes, &amp; to make vs truly iust; for otherwise we must needes say, that our help is not equiualent to our harme, nor our remedy to our diseases, nor our rysing to our fall, nor our gayne to our losse, nor consequently

This then being the effect and substance of the Cardinals argument, and the same so important, as you see, I leaue it to the Iudgement of any indifferent man, whether M. Andrews hath performed his promise in his Preface, which was (as you haue heard) that albeit he should be forced sometymes for want of place and paper to abridge and contract the Cardinals text, yet he would leaue out nothing that should be of moment, vt nihil ei pereat de argumenti pondere, so that nothing should be lost of the weight of his argument? Did he want heere, trow you, place and paper? or rather sincerity to set downe that which he had neither will, not skill to

For wheras the principall point which the Cardinall sought to proue thereby, was that Kinges could haue no voyce, or suffrage in the definition of Ecclesiasticall matters, M. Andrews answereth, that Theodosius in that Epistle signifyeth what the Count Cādidianus was to do in the Councell, and not what he himselfe might do therein: which answere would haue appeared to haue bene most friuolous, if so much of the Epistle had bene set downe, as the Cardinall alledgeth, and especially these wordes, Nefas est &amp;c.

Augustine would not take vpon him to determine how the same was wrought, saying that euen in ordinarie and naturall thinges, the effects are euident and certayne, and yet the causes are many tymes eyther vncertayn, or els wholy vnknowne, which is to be graunted much more in supernaturall and miraculous euents,
                  See Chap. 8. n. 12.13.14.15.16. as I haue shewed euidently in the last Chapter, where I haue confuted such another ridiculous argument of his against Prayer to Saints.
            44. And albeit he had resolued that the Saints themselues do not appeare or assist at their tombes, but Angels in their shape and lykenes, yet it could not be sayd but that apparition is theirs, being made by Gods expresse ordinance for their merites, in their name and lykenes, and for the benefit of those that expect and craue their help; especially seeing it is vsually said in the holy Scriptures, that God spake and appeared to 
                  Genes. 18. 
               Abraham, and Moyses 
               
                  Exod. 3., when neuerthelesse it was done by the ministry of Angels, and not in any shape that could represent him; and therfore S. Augustin
                     •
                  
                had great reason to say, that S. Felix appeared,

and that the Martyrs per diuinam potentiam viuorum rebus intersunt, are by the diuine power present at the doings or affaires of men: although afterwards he moueth a question concerning the manner of it, and doth not deny, but that it may be done by the ministery of Angels. Hereby then it appeareth, that this place of S. Augustine so clearely proueth the Apparition of Saints, and that men are helped by theirs prayers and merits, that M. Andrews had no other way to shift it off handsomly, but to omit the wordes of S. Augustine as of small moment, and testifying only a sleight matter of heare-say. I might add diuers others of this kind, but I omit them for breuities sake, and the rather for that they are commonly mixed with other kind of fraudes, wherof I shall haue occasiō to speake herafter; and therefore I will now proceed to others of more importance, namely his egregious abuse of authors, partly in wresting &amp; peruerting their sense, &amp; partly in the corrupt &amp; fraudulent citation of thē, in which kind you haue already seene M. Barlows talent, whereby you shall be able to iudge whether of them excelleth therin.
            45. First then I will begyn with his abuse of the Cardinall, who to shew that the Protestants in England do not entirely hold the Creed of Athanasius,
               M. Andrews his abusing &amp; corrupting of Authors. Bell. Apol. cap. 7. §. Venio ad tertiū. proposeth the Article concerning the day of Iudgemēt, when euery one (saith Athanasius) is to render account (de factis proprijs) of his owne acts: and those which haue done well, shall go to life euerlasting; and those which haue done euill, shall go to eternall fire. Whereupon the Cardinnll saith thus, 
                  In quibus verbis confitemur &amp;c. In which wordes (of Athanasius) we confesse, that there shall be a last Iudgement, wherein the iust Iudge will render to euery one according to the quality of his

deedes, to some the crowne of Iustice, and to others eternall punishment, and shame. For if lyfe euerlasting should be giuen to the faithfull not for the merits of workes, but in respect of faith and of Christs righteousnes mercifully imputed vnto them, there should be no need of Iudgement nor of examination of deedes: neither were it needfull that there should come a iust Iudge, but a mercyfull Father, neyther that we should render any reason of our deedes, but shew Christs Iustice imputed vnto vs, and apprehended by fayth; therefore the King cannot belieue this Article, if he belieue with Caluin and the Protestants, that all the workes of iust men are sinnes;
                     Calu. l. 3. Inst. c. 14. for these are Caluins wordes: no worke can passe from holy men, which doth not deserue the iust reward of shame.
               
            
            46. And what account shall iust men be able to make of their owne deedes vnto Christ the Iudge, if all their workes are vicious, and deserue the iust reward of reproach? and if iust men shall not be able to giue account of their deedes, truly the vniust shall be much lesse able to doe it; to what purpose then shall we all stand before the Tribunall of Christ to render account of our owne actions? But perhapps they will say, that all the workes of the Iust are vncleane, and filthie, but their filth shall be couered by the mercie of God, and the workes reputed as cleane to the faithfull, for Christ. But if this were true, then should there be no neede (as I haue sayd before) of the iustice of a Iudge, but of the mercie of a Father, and liberalitie of a Prince, therefore to what purpose doth the Article of the Creed say that Christ shall come to iudge the quick and the dead, and that all men shall render account of

their owne deedes, and why doth the Apostle say, reposita est mihi corona iustitiae &amp;c. The Crowne of Iustice is layd vp for me,
                  1. Pet. 1. 
                  which the iust Iudge will giue me in that daie? And why doth his fellow Apostle Peter say in lyke sort, &amp; si patrem inuocatis &amp;c. And if you inuocate, or call vpon the Father,
                  
                     Matth. 16. 
                  him which iudgeth without acception of persons, according to the worke of euery man: conuerse yee with fear in the time of your soiourning or dwelling heere? And finally why doth our Lord, who will come to iudge, fortell that he will come with his Angells to render to euery one according to his workes?
            
            47. All this saith the Cardinal concerning this matter, which I haue laid downe thus largely to the end you may see as well his sound discourse grounded vpon expresse scripture, as the malice of M. Andrewes peruerting and wresting the same to another sense then euer the Cardinall meant, and there fore craftily leaueth out of the Cardinalls text, all that which toucheth Caluins doctrine, concerning the impuritie and vncleanes of the best workes; which poynt the Cardinall especially impugneth, vrging, that if Caluins doctrine were true in that behalfe, then were the Iustice of God in the iugement and examinatiō of workes needles, and only his mercy and liberality requisite, whereby the Cardinall excludeth not Gods mercie from his Iudgements (as you shall hear euen now M. Andrews charge him) but inferreth 3.Card. Bellarmines inferēces. thinges vpon the Article of the Creed against Caluins doctrine.  The First, that iust mens workes which are to be iustly examined, iudged and rewarded with eternall life, are not damnable sinnes, as Caluin teacheth them to be.  The Second, that men shall not be saued only by their faith, and the imputation of Christes Iustice, but also

by the merits of good workes. And the third followeth directly of the former, to wit, that the only mercie and liberality of God is not to haue place in his last Iudgement (as it should haue if Caluins doctrine were true) but also his Iustice
                  •
                And therefore vpon this it followeth directly (as the Cardinall argueth very well) that whosoeuer belieueth Caluins doctrine in this behalfe, doth not belieue the Article of the Creed concerning Gods Iudgement, and retribution of workes.
            48. But now let vs se, how M. Andrews vnderstandeth, and glosseth the Cardinalls text; and to the end thou mayst, good Reader, heare him in his right vaine how he b

Thus then he sayth: Symbolum quoque tertium ab Athanasio conscriptum recipimus integrè &amp;c. We receiue also wholy the third Creed, written by Athanasius. There was no need to make mention of the last iudgement out of that, seeing it is expressed both by the Apostolicall, and also in the Nycen Creed.
               It is said there that we are to yield account of our deedes, but not

such an account as it seemeth heere the Cardinall will make, who I think will not appeare in the last Iudggement with this his Theology, nor say there, behould the merits of my workes; behould the qualitie of my deedes, for the which I require that lyfe euerlasting be giuen me. I doe not desire here a mercifull Father, but I will haue a iust iudge, away with the grace of Faith, or of the righteousnes of Christ mercifully imputed vnto me. I will haue my deedes examined, for works haue proceeded from me which doe not deserue reproach, as being such as are without fault, and haue nothing that needes to be couered with mercy: for if it were so, I should haue no need of the Iustice of a Iudge, but of the mercie of a Father, or of the liberality of a Prince, whereof I haue no need. It is meruaile that the Cardinal did not add, for I am not as all other men, as also these innouatours are, who haue need of thy mercy, to the end that their euill deedes be not ymputed vnto thē, &amp; reputed as good deedes for the righteousnes of Christ. But if this were so, thē would Cō
                     stantine say to the Cardinall, set vp a ladder, &amp; clime vp to heauē alon, as he sayd once to Acetius the Nouatiā heretick.
               
            
            49. Neuerthelesse a man may well maruaille and demaund, whether the Cardinall in good earnest be so affected,

                     sset. pag. 87. and so think of himselfe as heere he seemes to doe, to wit, that he shall haue no need of the mercy of a Father, nor of the liberality of a Prince, that he feareth not the Iustice of the Iudge, that he challengeth to himselfe lyfe euerlasting, for the quality of his deedes, and merits of his workes; that he renounceth the Grace, Fayth, and Righteousnes of Christ; that he will appeare in Iudgemēt without these, and there make ostentation of his workes, as being full, pure, and perfect, without all kind of filth, or

vice. Thus farre M. Andrewes.
            
            50. And dost thou not (good Reader) see how he descanteth heere vpon a false burthen of his owne, amplifying &amp; exaggerating his owne malicious conceit, and misconstruction of the Cardinalls wordes, as though the same were his true sense and meaning? dost thou not see, I say, how he pleaseth himselfe in dilating and amplifying his slanderous fiction, glorying and triumphing in his owne malice? In so much that I may well say vnto him with the psalmist,
                  Psal. 51. 
               Quid gloriaris in malitia, qui potens es in iniquitate? For I appeale to any indifferent man whether any such thing, as heere maliciously he inferreth, can be iustly gathered on the Cardinalls wordes, who (as I haue said before) meaning to confute Caluins pernicious doctrine (which draweth men to a most dangerous presumption of Gods mercy and neglect of his iustice, yea and to a careles contempt of all good workes, teaching all to be sinfull and damnable, and no other meanes of saluation but by only faith, and the imputation of Christs Iustice;) the Cardinall, I say, impugning this as well by expresse Scripture, as by the Article of the Creed, doth vrge the Iustice of our iust Iudge, as well in the reward of vertue, and good workes, as in the punishment of vice &amp; sinne, not excluding his mercy from his Iustice (which can neuer be separated) but inculcating the consideration of his exact Iudgment in the examination, punishment, and reward of mens deedes, good and bad, according to their merits, which directly ouerthroweth Caluins doctrine of iustification by only fayth, and of the impurity of good workes.
            
               51. And therefore for as much as M. Andrews knew very well that he could not so easily delude his Reader with the flourish of his false glosse, if he should lay downe the doctrine, and words of Caluin (which the Cardinall alledgeth and confuteth) he resolued to leaue them quite out with a great parte also of the Cardinalls text concerning the same. Perhaps he would haue his Reader to imagine that he lackt place and paper but if you consider the length of his discourse (which he continueth for almost three whole pages) you will easily see that he wanteth neyther paper nor roome in his margent to set downe all the Cardinalls text, if he had thought it would haue bene for his purpose.
            52. But truely, that which seemeth to me most strange in his extrauagant discourse, is, how he could imagine that the Cardinall taketh vpon him to be iudge of his owne actions, whose arguments tend to proue, that God only is to examine and iudg all mens workes, and not that euery man, or yet any man shall be able to iudg and determine of the quality of his owne deedes; for so should man be his owne Iudg, &amp; the iugdement of God be no lesse superfluous &amp; needles, then it should be if Caluins doctrin (which the Cardinall impugneth) were true. Besides, that the Cardinall neyther saith, nor so much as insinuateth, that we shall haue no need in iudgement of the mercy of a Father, or the liberalitie of a Prince, and much lesse that he renounceth the mercy, grace, faith, and the Righteousnes of Christ (as M. Andrews doth calumniate and belie him.) For the Cardinall knoweth and acknowledgeth, as all Catholikes do, that without the mercy, grace, faith, and Righteousnes of Christ,
               
there can be noe iustificatiō (I meane not the Righteous

                saith S. Augustine, sed quam dat homini Deus &amp;c. not that Iustice by the which God is iust, but that which he giues to man, that man may be iust by God) and therefore that which the Cardinall saith, is only this, that, si ita esset, if it were so as Caluin teacheth, that is to say, if the iust mans best workes were sinfull, and impure, and yet couered and reputed as cleane by the mercy of God, and for the Righteousnes of Christ imputed vnto vs, then the iustice of a Iudg to examin, and iudg our workes were needles, and to no purpose, seeing in that case the only mercy of God couering our sinnes, and imputing Christs Righteousenes vnto vs, would suffice to saue vs without the examination and iust iudgment of workes: which consequence is indeed so cleare, that M. Andrews had noe other shift to auoid it, but to peruert the Cardinalls whole sense, and meaning, and so to argue against his owne fiction, and make a plaine Schi

                  hia as you haue seene him often do before.
            53. Furthermore it may be wondred greatly how he could so farre forget himselfe as to make the Cardinall so cōfident &amp; presumptuous of his owne merit, as to brag and boast euen to God himselfe of the quality of his deedes, seeing that he (I meane M. Andrews) knoweth full well (and accounteth it for no small error in the Cardinall, and all Catholykes) that they impugne Luther and Caluins doctrine concerning the certainety and assurance of Saluation, and hould that no man without a speciall reuelation

from almighty God can know, and much lesse determine, vtrum odio vel amore dignus sit. Whether he be worthy of loue or hatred,
               
                  Eccles. 9. that is to say, whether he be in the state of grace, or haue true merits, and be truly iustified. And therfore the good Catholike, though his merits be neuer so great in the sight of God, yea and his conscience neuer so cleare (whereby his hope also of reward may be greate) yet assuring himselfe that he hath no goodnes of himselfe, but that all his good merits are Gods guifts, are speciall fruits of Gods grace, neyther is vainly proud thereof, but rather more humble and thankfull for the same; neyther yet presumeth to be his owne iudg, whether he haue any good merits or no, but leaueth the iudgment therof to God, with due reuerence and feare, knowing that he searcheth the harts and reynes, yea and that, as the Prophet saith,
                  Psalm. 7. 
               scrutabitur Hierusalem cum lucernis, he will search Hierusalem (that is to say euen the Consciences of the iust) with Candles.
               
                  Sophon. cap. 1. And that therefore it is necessary for euery man according to the aduise of the Apostle,

               operari salutem cum metu, &amp; tremore, to worke his saluation with feare and trembling. In which respect the Cardinall treating in his controuersies of the merits of workes, and hauing proued that a man may haue some confidence in good works and merits (modo superbia cauetur,
               
                  Ibid. §. Sit tertia propositio.
                saith he, so that pride be auoided) concludeth that, propter incertitudinem propriae iustitiae &amp;c. For the vncertainty of a mans owne Iustice and the danger of vaine glory,
               
                  S. Chrysos. Ho. 38. ad Pop. Antioch &amp; ho. 3. in Matth.
                
               it is most safe, and secure for euery man to repose his whole confidence, and trust in the only mercie and benignity of almighty God. Whereof he yealdeth also this reason out of S. Chrysostome, that God who seeth, and knoweth his good merits, will vndoubtedly

reward him, the rather for his humility.
            54. Thus then you see that M. Andrewes hath imployd all his Rhetorick, no lesse maliciously then vainly in framing such a formal prosopopaeia, as he hath done, of the Cardinalls Iustification of himselfe, and ostentation of his merits, which is so farre, not only from the Cardinalls humilitie and sanctitie, but also from his doctrine euery where, and his sense and meaning in this place, that I may well conclude, that M. Andrews hath notoriously abused, wronged, and belyed him, charging him with false and absurd doctrine which he neuer thought and much lesse taught, wresting his words, and sense to other purpose, then euer he meant, or could ymagine, which is the point that I haue vndertaken to shew at this tyme; and therefore I omit to prosecute the Confutation of the rest of his idle discourse, wherein after some further gybes at the Cardinall,M. Andrews is copious in prouing that which no man doth deny. yea at all Cardinalls and Iesuits for their presumption in their owne (Innocencie) he laboureth to proue that there shall be place for mercie in Gods Iudgement, which I thinke no man will be so absurd to deny; and then he alleadgeth certaine places of S. Gregory and S. Bernard to proue that our best workes are impure, which places (as also all the rest that his fellowes are wont to cite for that purpose) are fully answered in Cardinall Bellarmins Controuersies,

                      Iustif. lib. 4. cap. 21. whereto I remit him for that point. But in the end after all his rauing, it seemeth he is somewhat come to himselfe, acknowledging (as it were in lucid
                     •
                   interuallo) that account is to be giuen for deedes,M. Andrews lucidum interuallum.
                as well at the howre of death as in the last iudgement, and that good workes shall be rewarded by the force of Gods promise, yea and that a man may

                heerafter to say somewhat more vnto him, as also about merits and the eternall retribution of workes. And therefore this shall suffice for the present concerning this point.
            55. But what meruaile is it if he maketh no scruple to abuse the Cardinall and to peruert his sense and meaning,M. Andrews abuseth the Fathers. seeing that he vseth the same stile with the holy and auncient Fathers, to which purpose I doubt not but you may remember that in the first Chapter of this Adioynder I shewed euidently how he abused, belyed, and falsified S. Ambrose, S. Augustine, and S. Cyrill; as that he corrupted 
                  See before Chap. 1. nu. 6. 
               S. Ambrose his text, adding certaine words thereto, and belyed S. 
               
                  Ibid. num. 25. 
               Augustine, and S. Cyril, affirming them to teach that S. Peter lost his Apostleship by his fall. Whereas S. Augustine hath nothing at all to that purpose in the place cyted by M. Andrews, and teacheth the quite contrary els where. And though S. Cyril hath somewhat concerning that matter, yet it is farre otherwyse then M. Andrews suggesteth, as is euident by the place it selfe which I haue laid downe at large in the first 
                  nu. 26.27. Chapter, and therfore I forbear to treat further therof in this place.
            56. Also you may remember his notable fraud in the corrupt allegation of a Canon of the Councell of Chalcedon, concerning the equality of dignity, power and authority, which he saith, was giuen thereby to the Bishop of Constantinople with the Bishop of Rome
               
                  •
                whereas the contrary appeareth by the expresse wordes of the same Canon, by the which it is cleare,

            58. Therefore whereas the Apologie for the Oath seemeth only to admit and approue the 4. first generall Councells, the Cardinall demandeth, why those only should be admitted and receiued,

                  Aske that of Gregory, who allbeit he was after the fifth, yet he bare this honour only to the 4. first. He spake magnificently of the first fower, de quinto silijt, he was silent, or said

nothing of the fift; and the reason which moued him not to giue lyke honor to the fift as to the other, moued also the King not to beare the lyke respect to the rest of the Councells which followed the fift.
So he. Wherein you see he affirmeth that S. Gregory spake magnificently, or very honorably of the 4. first Councells, and de quinto siluit, said nothing of the fift, though the same had bene held before his tyme.
            59. But how truly he saith this, it shall appeare by Saint Gregories owne words, who wryting to Iohn Byshop of Constantinople, and hauing said of the 4. first Councells that he did imbrace them tota deuotione. vt quatuor Euangelia, with all deuotion as the 4. Ghospels (because, saith he, the building of the holy faith is raised vpon them as vpon a fowre squared stone &amp;c.) he addeth concerning the fi
                  ••
               t,Open your eyes Syr Lancelot and see whether S. Gregory sayd nothing of the fifth generall Councell. 
               quintum quoque pariter veneror &amp;c. I reuerence also together with them the fifth Councell, wherin the Epistle of Iba is reiected, as full of error, and Theodorus separating the person of our mediatour in two substances, is conuinced to haue fallen into perfidious impietie. Also the writinges of Theodoret, reprouing the faith of Cyril, are refuted there, for their temerarious madnes, and therefore all the persons which the said venerable Councels reiect, I do also reiect, and those which they admit, and reuerence, I doe imbrace: for seeing they were ordeyned by an vniuersall consent, whosoeuer presumeth to loose that which they binde, or to binde that which they loose, doth destroy himselfe and not them. Quisquis ergo aliud sapit, Anathema sit &amp;c. Therefore whosoeuer thinketh, or vnderstandeth otherwise, let him be accursed, and whosoeuer holdeth the faith of the foresaid Synods, peace be to him from God the Father by Iesus Christ his Sonne. Thus saith S. Gregorie, as well of the 5. Synod, as of the other

fowre.
            60. And now, good Reader, I remit it to thy iudgement whether it be truth which M. Andrews saith, to wit, that S. Gregory, Siluit de quinto, said nothing to the fift Councell, yea and whether he admitted, and honored only the fowre first Councells, doth he not say, quintum quo

                  ror. I doe also togeather with the other reuerence the fift Councell? and doth he not acknowledg the infallible verity thereof as well as of the other, holding him for accursed who doth reiect anything determined by any of the fiue, whether it concerne matter of faith, or the Condē
               nation of any mans person? and what other reason doth he alledg, but because they were all fiue held by generall consent, giuing euidently to vnderstand that a generall Councell lawfully assembled, representeth the whole Church of God, and is infallibly guided by the holy Ghost.
            61. And whereas he seemeth to speake more magnificiently (as M. Andrews termeth it) of the fowre former then of the fift (saying that he reuerenceth them with all deuotion as the 4. Ghospells) the reason thereof is euident, to wit, because the most important points of our Christian faith (concerning the Blessed Trinity, the Godhead of the holy Ghost, and the Diuinity, Humanity, Nature and Person of our Sauiour Christ) were resolued, and decreed therin, whereas in the 5. there was not any new matter of faith determined, but only certaine persons and their writinges cōdemned, which had caused a great controuersy, and schisme in the Church at that tyme; neuertheles we see,
                  S. Greg. l. 3. Ep. 37. that albeit S. Gregory doth not say in expresse wordes, that he reuerenceth the 5.

Councell, as the 4. Ghospells (as he said of the other fowre) yet he saith as much in effect, seeing that he professeth to hould all those for accursed who do reiect or contradict it. So that M. Andrews hath shamefully abused and belied S. Gregory herein, and must seeke some other Patron to iustifie and defend him for admitting only the 4. first generall Councells: but let vs see some more of his fraudes in this kind.
            62. Vpon occasion of certaine places of the Fathers alledged by the Cardinall, to shew the Custome of praying to Saints in the primatiue Church, M. Andrews goeth about to proue that Saynts do not know what wee do here on earth,
                  Andr. cap. 1. pag. 46. eyther by seeing the same in God, or by being themselues present amongst vs, and hauing alleadged 3. or 4. authorities for the former point (which he may see sufficiently answered in Cardinall 
                  Bellar de Sanct. beatit. lib. 1. ca. 1. &amp; 2. Bellarmines Controuersies) he saith for the letter, 
                  Andr. vbi supra lin. 4. 
               mortuos autem rebus nostris non interuenire sensit Augustinus. Augustine was of opinion that the dead are not present at our affaires, for the which he quoteth no place of S. Augustine, but addeth, quis hoc refert? Cardinalis. Who relateth or affirmeth this? the Cardinall: and for this M. Andrews citeth in his margent the Cardinalls treatise of the beatitude of Saynts in his bookes of Controuersies,
                  Bell. de Beatit. lib. 1. ca. 20. where indeed the Cardinall handling that question, and laying downe the obiection of hereticks, hath amongst the rest a place of S. Augustine in his books de cura pro mortuis,
               
                  S. Aug. li. de cura pro mort. ca. 12. where he affirmeth that the dead are not present at mens affaires, neyther yet do know what is done vpon earth; neuertheles afterwards the Cardinall answering the same obiection in the same Chapter, proueth out of the very same treatise of S.

               Augustine (from whence the obiection is taken) that albeit the dead are not vsually presēt at mens affaires, nor do naturally know what is done vpon earth, yet they may know it, not only by Angells, 
                  Idem ibid. c. 15. but also supernaturally, to wit, by diuine reuelation, yea and that the holy Martyrs, 
                  Ibid. c. 1
                     •
                  . and Saynts are present amongst men, per diuinam potentiam, by the diuine power.
            
            63. And to shew this, the Cardinall alledgeth these wordes out of the said treatise of S. Augustine, non ideo putandum est &amp;c. It is not therefore to be thought that euery one of the dead may be present at the affaires of men, because the Martyrs are present in healing and helping some men, but rather it is to be vnderstood, that because the dead cānot be present amongst men by their owne nature, therefore the Martyrs are present at mens affaires by the diuine power. Thus saith S. Augustine: where you see he distinguisheth betwixt naturall, and supernaturall meanes, and betwixt the glorified Saynts of God (for such are the Martyrs of whome he speaketh) and other dead men, granting that the Mar
                     •
                  yrs do that by supernaturall, and diuine meanes, which other dead men cannot naturally do; and this is the same in effect that all Catholikes hould concerning the knowledge that the glorified Saynts haue of things don in earth, to wit, that they do not know the same naturally, but by supernaturall meanes, whether they see it in seeing the diuine essence, or know it otherwise by reuelation; so as; thereby it is manifest that M. Andrewes hath notably abused both S. Augustine and the Cardinall; S. Augustine, in making him to affirme of glorified Saynts, that which he spake of other dead men, as if he made no difference betweene the supernaturall knowledge and power of the one, and the naturall
               
of the other, which he euidently distinguisheth; Also he abuseth the Cardinall in taking hould of his obiection, and dissembling his solution, which is one of the most grosse and palpable frauds or rather fooleries that may be imagined in this kind.A most grosse and palpable fraud or rather foolery of M. Andrewes.
            
            64. Furthermore whereas the Cardinall produceth the euident and cleere testimony of S. Augustine, to proue that many Miracles were done by the Reliques of S. Stephen in Affrick, M. Andrews wisheth the Cardinall to consider how he can well and handsomly reconcile Augustine with Augustine concerning those Miracles,
                  Card. Apolog. c. 12. p. 157. and his reason is, because Augustine saith in an Epistle to his Cleargie,
                  S. Aug. de ciuit. Dei l. 22. cap. 8. Andre. ca. 12. pag. 284. §. 1. and all the people of Hippo, nusquam hic in Africa, t
                     •
                  lia fieri se scire, he knew that such things were not don any where in Africk, which I beseech thee good Reader, to note, and thou shalt euidently see the good Conscience of M. Andrews,
               
                  Epist. 137 who abuseth S. Augustine notably two wayes, the one in making him seeme to contradict himselfe most manifestly,M. Andrews his bad conscience in abusing S. Augustine most impudently. yea and to giue himselfe, as it were, the lye, witnessing in one place matters of fact vpon his owne knowledge, (for so he testifieth those Miracles don by S. Stephens reliques,) and in another place affirming that he knewe the same to be false, for so must it needes be, if he knewe that such thinges were not done any where in Africk. The other abuse is in that he peruerteth the sense of S. Augustins Epistle, as it will easely appeare, if we consider the occasion why S. Augustine wrote the same; which therefore I think good here to relate.
            65. A Scandalous quarrell being fallen out betwixt a Chaplaine of S. Augustin, and a yong man concerning an infamous calumniation raysed by the

yong man against the Preist (whereof the truth could not be tried or knowne, because the matter depended wholly vpon their owne oathes, and testimonyes) S. Augustin aduised them to goe to Nola in Italy to the body of S. Felix, where it pleased God ordinarily in like cases to discouer periuries, by the miraculous punishment of the periured person; and of this he thought good afterwards to giue account vnto his Cleargie and People for their satisfaction, which he did by the Epistle that M. Andrews citeth, wherein discoursing, by the occasion of this matter, why Almighty God, doth such Miracles in some places, and not in others, he saith,
                  S. Aug. Ep. 
                  
                     •
                  37. 
               Multis notissima est sanctitas loci &amp;c. Many do verie well knowe the holynes of the place, where lyeth the bodie of Blessed Felix of Nola, whither I ordeyned them to go, because from thence I might more easely and truly vnderstand by letters whatsoeuer that should please God to manifest in either of them. So he; and then hauing added that also in Millan a periured theefe was discouered miraculously at the Monuments of certaine Saints, and forced to restore that which he had stolne, he saith further thus; numquid non Africa &amp;c. Is not Affrick full of the bodies of holy Martyrs? &amp; tamen nusquam hic scimus talia fieri &amp;c. And neuerthelesse we know that such things (that is to say Miracles in this kind) are not don any where here in Africk. For euen as the Apostle sayth that all holy men haue not the guifts of healing, so also, he who diuideth things proper, or peculiar to euery one as it pleaseth him, would not haue these things to be done at all the memories or monuments of Saynts. Thus sayth S. Augustine.
            
            66. Whereby I doubt not but thou seest, good Reader, in what sense he denieth Miracles to haue byn done in Affrick, that is to say, such Miracles as were

done at the body of S. Felix, for the discouery and punishment of periury and not such as he testifieth els where, to haue byn ordinarily don at the Reliques of S. Stephen,
               
                  S. Aug. de ciuit. Dei l. 22. cap. 8. whereof he recounteth such a multitude, with such asseueration of his owne knowledge therof, and publique testymony of an infinite number of witnesses, and such particular relation of circumstances, tymes, and places, that a man must hould him for the most impudent lyar, that euer wrote, if they were not most true. Besides, that writing the same, as he did, for the proofe of Christian Religion against Pagans, and Infidells, it cannot without extreme folly be imagined that such a learned, wise, and holy man, as he, would be so prodigall not only of his owne credit, and reputation, but also of the honour of Christiā Religiō, as to expose the same to the derision of the Paynims, by seking to confirme it by fables and lyes, which euery man in those parts (as well the Paynimes themselues as others) might haue cōtrolled and would haue derided, if they had byn fained.
            67. Finally, these miracles of S. Stephen which M. Andrewes calleth here in question, are testified by S. Augustine in that worke which M. Andrewes himselfe so much esteemeth els where,
                  Andr. c. 1. p. 46. §. at id nūquam.
                that alledging out of it a sentence which he thought might make for him, he calleth it opus palmare de ciuitate Dei, the principall or most excellent worke of Augustine of the citty of God. And yet now he would faine disgrace it, or rather S. Augustine himselfe by the imputation of a contradiction, which he would the Reader should suppose to be betwixt it, and the foresaid Epistle of S. Augustine, whereas you see (and M. Andrews knoweth it in his

owne conscience) that there is no contradiction in the world betwixt them, but that both of them do notably and clearly testifie the ancient and venerable vse of holy Reliques, and the miraculous assistance, and helpe that God giueth to his faithfull people thereby, and by the praiers and Reliques of his holy Martyrs and Saints. So that truly a man may wonder at the impudency,M. Andrews his abuse of S. Augustine inexcusable. and seared Conscience of M. Andrews, who seeketh to delude his Reader with such a fraudulent and inexcusable abuse of this holy Father.
            68. But no wonder that he is so bould with the Fathers, seeing that the Sacred authority of the holy Scriptures cānot suffice to free them from his fraud: Wherein it seemeth he hath conspired with M. Barlow, with whome he concurreth in the corruption and abuse of one and the selfe same place. To which purpose I must desire the good Reader to call to mind what I debated with M. Barlow concerning this point in the sixt Chapter of my Supplement,
                  See suppl. c. 6. num. 14 15.16. where I shewed euidently how he abused the holy Scripture, in saying that God in his word appointed Kinges to be guardians of both the tables, to command and prohibit in matters of Religion,
               
                  Ibidem.
                for which he quoted in his margēt the 17. of Deuteronomy, and 18. verse, where no such thing is to be found, but rather the cleane contrary is to be inferred thereon,
                  Andr. ca. 1. p. 22. §. Sed nec.
                as I amply declared in the foresaid Chapter: and now M. Andrews hauing occasion to treat of the antiquitie of the spiritual primacy of temporall Kings,The holy Scripture abused by M. Andrews. draweth it partly from the same place, deducing it euen from Moyses, who when he deliuered, saith he, the Copie of the law to the King, cum eo sic tradito summam religionis (quae prima, summaque

legis pars est) custodiendae, &amp; custodiri faciendae potestatem tradidit; gaue togeather with it the chief power to keepe Religion and cause it to be kept, which Religion is the first and chiefe parte of the lawe. Thus saith M. Andrews, &amp; though he quot no place, yet he must eyther ground this his assertion vpon the same place of Deuteronomy, which M. Barlow alleadgeth, or els he shall finde it no where, for it was ordeyned only there &amp; no where els, that the King should haue a Copie of the lawe.
            69. Wherein neuerthelesse that is to be noted by the way, that Moyses did not there, or any where els, giue a Copie of the lawe to any King, (for there were no Kinges of the people of Israell for 4. hundred yeares after Moyses) but God ordeyned by Moyses in 17. of Deuteronomy that the future King, should take a Copie of the law, from the Priest of the Tribe of Leui, and haue the same with him, and read it all the daies of his lyfe. But what? Will M. Andrews say that the King was made hereby supreame head or gouernor of the Church in Ecclesiasticall causes? or (to vse his owne manner of speach) that the Cheif or supreame power to keepe Religion and cause it to be kept, was giuen him hereby? Truly the wordes immediatly following do shew another reason why the King should haue the Copy of the law, to wit, vt discat &amp;c. to the end he may learne to feare his Lord God, and keepe his word, and ceremonies commanded in the law. That is to say, he should haue it for his owne priuat vse, and instruction, that he might punctually obserue it all the dayes of his lyfe, to which purpose I am sure M. Andrews will allow euery man and woman to haue a Copy of it as well as the King. How then was sūma potestas the supreme power, wherof he speaketh, giuen hereby to the King more then

to any other man or woman?
            70. But if wee cōsider what was expressely ordeyned a litle before in the same Chapter touching the supreme authority of the high Priest,
                  Deut. 17. and that the future King was presētly after cōmanded to keepe exactly the whole law of God (wherof the ordinance touching the obediēce to the high Priest was a principall part) yea &amp; to take a Copie of the law of the Priests, who kept the originall (&amp; therefor as I argued against M. Barlow, were the true Gardiās of the law, &amp; not the King, who had but the Copy) &amp; if wee weigh withall that he was to learne of them also the sense &amp; interpretation of the law, because they only, &amp; not the King had authority to teach &amp; interpret it, and to resolue all doubts &amp; difficulties which should occurre therein (as I proued clearly out of the 
                  Deut. 17. &amp;. 24. Exod. 28. Ezech 44. Malach 2. See chap. 1. à nu. 10 ad nu. 24. Scriptures in the first Chapter of my Supplement) if all this, I say be well considered, it may be wondred, with what face M. Barlow and M. Andrews could inferre any spirituall supremacy of the King vpon this place, which doth in truth proue their subiection in matters of Religion to Priests, and specially to the high Priest. So as it is euident that M. Andrews hath no lesse shamefully abused the holy Scriptures in this point, then M. Barlow: in so much that it is hard to say whether of them is more shameles, especially seeing that they both do also exceed in a prodigious kind of impudency, wherin I thought no man could haue matched M. Barlow, vntill I had read M. Andrews, I meane in facing and bragging out a bad matter, when arguments and proofs are to weake, whereof I gaue some Instances in M. Barlow, and will now do the lyke in M. Andrews.
            
            
               71. Thou maist remember, good Reader, what poore stuffe he produced 
                  Andr. ca. 1. p. 16. to proue that S. Peter had nothing peculiar to himselfe by his pastorall Cōmission, and how he triumphed in two or three paragraphes, as though he had trodden the Cardinall vnder his feet,M. Andrews his facing-out of matters. yea and bragged also afterwardes in another place, saying:

When neuerthelesse to make good his idle cōceipt he was faine to vse great fraud and corruption in the allegation of those two Fathers, corrupting the text of S. Ambrose, &amp; dissembling the circumstances of the place in S. Augustine, which clearely proueth the Primacy of S. Peter, as I haue amply declared in the first Chapter of this 
                  Cap. 1. nu. 3. &amp; sequent. ad nu 12. Adioynder, so that his braggs and vaunts had no other ground, but his owne vanity, corruption, and falsity.
            72. The lyke may be noted also in his vayne insultations against the Cardinall about the Councell of Chalcedon. For when he himselfe had shamefully abused, peruerted, and mangled the 28. Canon (as I haue clearly shewed in the second Chapter of this Adioinder 
               
                  c. 2. nu. 3.4.6.7.59. &amp;. 64. he admonisheth the Cardinall seriously not to produce his proofes, tamquam è vepreculis, as it were out of the bryers, not out of the superscriptions of letters, or of some corner of a period, or perhaps some peece of a tytle, or fragment of a litle clause, but to bring out some Canon, for that the Canons are the voyce of the Councells. As though forsooth he had beaten downe the Cardinall with the shot of a Canon; whereas not

only the most important parts of that Councell, but also the very Canon, which he mangled, and peruerted, do euidently proue the Cardinalls intent, to wit, the primacy of the Roman Sea,
               
                  Ibidem.
                as I haue amply shewed in the second Chapter aforesaid: so as it is hard to say whether he was more impudent in his corruption and falsity, or in his vayne brags afterwards, as if he had vsed all the sincerity in the world, and got a great victorie.
            73. And in lyke sort dealt he with the Cardinall about the adoratiō
                of Reliques, when he triumphed saying: Tenetur hic Cardinalis vt elabi non possit. Heere the Cardinall is catcht, and held so fast, that he cannot escape away: neuertheles the testimony which he himselfe produced, being layed downe whole with the circumstāces doth cōuince him both of folly &amp; fraud, as hath bene manifestly shewed a litle before euen in this 
                  See before nu. 21. &amp; seq. ad nu. 27. Chapter, and therefore I forbeare to speake further thereof, and will only add one other Instance in this kind,
                  Card. Apolog. ca. 15. pag. 197. &amp; 198. of a matter which hath not beene touched hitherto.
            74. The Cardinall as well in his Matthaeus Tortus, as also in his Apology;M. Andrews impudently affirmeth that the Puritans haue recalled their doctrine cō
                  cerning the Kings supremacy. auoweth that the Puritans in England do no lesse abhor the oath of supremacy then the Catholikes, and in his Apology alleadgeth for the proofe thereof, not only his Maiesties monitorie Preface, and his Basilicō Doron, but also Caluins doctrine (which the Puritanes professe) and the testimony of M. Bancroft late pretended Bishop of Canterbury, who plainely witnesseth the same, as well concerning the profession and practice of the Puritans, as also touching Caluins expressed doctrine in that behalfe; and M. Andrews finding himselfe hardly p

hauing no other remedy but to face out the matter, calleth the Cardinall not only Mendacem, a Ly

               a Dotard, and why? Marry because the Puritans (saith M. Andrewes) do dayly in their Sermons giue the tytle of supreme Gouernour to the King, yea and do not stick to sweare somtymes to the Kinges supremacy, in so much, that, facto, saith he, res tenetur, the matter is cleare in fact, and experience; and afterward acknowledging that indeed M. Bancroft did twenty yeares agoe gather out of diuers Theses or positions of theirs, some suspition that they were alienated from the Kinges supremacy, yea and that perhaps it was so then, he concludeth, that now of late recognouerunt errores suos, they haue acknowledged, or recalled their errours.
            75. This is M. Andrews his discourse, which how true it is (notwithstanding his impudent asseueration thereof) I do appeale to the consciences of the learneder sort of Puritans, &amp; Precisians in England, whether they haue of late tyme, or at any tyme, retracted, and recanted Caluins doctrine and theirs in this point as an erour. For albeit I make no doubt but that some of them may now in their sermons (as others of the weaker sort of them did euen in M. Bancrofts tyme,The fact of some Puritans in taking the oath cannot preiudice the opiniō or doctrin of the rest. and alwayes before) vse the ordinary style of his Maiesties tytle, yea and that otherwyles some of them also do dispence with their cōsciences, and swallow the Oath to get some Benefice, or Ecclesiasticall dignity: yet I assure my selfe that the more zealous, and precise Puritans, and especially their whole Congregatiō will not acknowledge this fact of some of them for any definition, or decree of theirs, or for a recantation of their doctrine, and

beliefe in this poynt, neyther is it sufficient for the recalling of an errour of a whole sect standing still on foote (as this of the Puritans yet doth) that some of them chang their opinion, or for feare, or promotion dissemble it, when the same is not ratified by some publike testimony of their whole company.
            76. Therefore I must now vrge M. Andrews to shew vs in what printed booke, or generall decree of their Congregatiōs they haue recanted their opiniō, and acknowledged it for an errour, seeing that the same was published before to the world by themselues, in such sort, that M. Bancroft (by M. Andrews his owne confession) gathered it out of their owne bookes;
                  Andr. p. 34

               &amp; ita fortè tum fuit, saith he, and so perhaps it was then (he meaneth 20. yeares agoe) and yet you see, he saith it with a perhaps, as if the matter were in doubt, and that perhaps it was not so. But I dare say without all peraduenture that it was so; not only 20. yeares agoe, but also much later, euen since his Maiesty came into England, for I am sure there are ynough who know and remember, that Burges a Puritan preacher was committed to Prison, for that in a Sermon before his Maiesty, he would not giue him his ordinary style, and tytle of supreme Gouernour of the Church.
            77. But what if I produce a very substātiall witnes of their continuance in that opinion some yeares after, and such a one as M. Andrews hath great reason to admit, for that he stil liueth, yea ruleth in the English Clergy no lesse thē 
               M. Andrews himselfe,M. Barlow a witnes against M. Andrews. I meane the learned Doctor and worthy superintendent M. Barlow, who in his Epistle to the Ministers of Scotland, prefixed to the Sermon which he prated

before his Maiesty against the Puritans the 21. of September in the yeare 1606. (which is not past 6. yeares agoe) coupleth the Puritans with the Papists for their opinion in that point, saying, 
                  M. Barlow in his Epistle to the ministers
                        •
                      of Scotland.
                
               that Papists, and Puritans will haue the King to be but an honorable member, not a chiefe gouernour in the Churches of his dominions. Thus saith M. Barlow, whome M. Andrews must needs allow for a man of credit, except he will discredit his owne occupation, and ministry.
            78. Besides that, I will adde to M. Barlow another authenticall witnes, who wrote the yeare after, and representeth the authority of all the Clergy of England, I meane M. Thomas Rogers in his booke intytled; The faith, doctrine, and religion professed, and protected in the realme of England &amp;c. wherein he setteth downe 39. Articles agreed vpon by the whole Clergy, and analised by him into propositions, with a discouery, and confutation (as he pretendeth) of all those that haue at any tyme contradicted the said articles; and all this he saith was perused,
               The testimony of all the English Clergy against M. Andrews. 
               and by the lawfull authority of the Church of England allowed to be publike; So that this is a witnes of sufficient credit, if ther be any credit to be giuen to the Church, and Clergy of England, yea to M. Andrewes himselfe, who is a principall member thereof, and therefore by all lykelyhood gaue his suffrage to the approbation of M. Rogers his booke.

                  Tho. Rogers. p. 208. §. penult.
                concerning the doctrine of the Puritans, and addeth further also in the next leafe, that if the King be not included in the number of Pastors, Elders, Deacons, and Widdowes, he cannot possibly haue any thing to doe in Church-affaires in these mens opinions, meaning the Puritans.
            
            80. All this wrote M. Thomas Rogers touching the doctrine of the Puritans not past fiue yeares agoe, for his booke was printed in Cābridge by Iohn Legat in the yeare of our Lord 1607. If then the Puritans were so lately (as fiue yeares agoe, of the opinion that M. Barlow, and M. Rogers report, which is the same that the Cardinall affirmeth) eyther let M. Andrews tell vs precisely in what bookes, or sermons since that tyme they haue recalled this errour, or els if he will needs say that they did it before, I will turne him to these two for answere, not doubting but they are able to giue him full satisfaction therein, especially M. Rogers, who hath pawned the credit of all the English

Clergy for the truth of his testimony.M. Andrewes his immodesty in reuyling the Cardinall most iniuriously. And in the meane tyme I will desire thee, good Reader, to consider, whether M. Andrews could haue any iust cause, or pretence to reuile the Cardinall, and call him lyar, and dotard as he doth, for affirming a matter belonging to our Country, which he findeth expressely testified by the greatest superintendent of our English Clergy, besids other sufficient reasons mouing him thereto.
            81. For put the case it were true (as it is most false) that the Puritans haue of late recanted their errour (as M. Andrews tearmeth it) yet the same hauing neuer byn hitherto so published that strangers can take notice thereof, hath M. Andrew
                     •
                  
                any reason in the world to reprehend and reuyle any stranger for not acknowledging it, being but a matter of fact, which he neyther knoweth, nor is bound to know? Truly, albeit M. Andrews be of a most intemperate tongue, and malignant disposition towards Catholykes (as hath appeared diuers wayes) yet I verily think that if the weakenes of his cause had not forced him to braue, and face it out with rayling for lack of reason to defend it, he would not in this case haue byn so immoderate in contumelies, and reproaches towards the Cardinall, as he hath byn without any cause giuen of his part. But heerin he concurreth so well with his companion M. Barlow, that it appeareth euidently they are both guided by one spirit. To conclude this point concerning the Puritans, wheras M. Andrews saith that they haue of late acknowledged their error touching the Kings supremacy, I will in the next Chapter 
                  Chap. 10. nu. 61. &amp; sequēt.
                make it euident, that not they, but hee (if he be an English Protestant) may be sayd

to haue acknowledged his error, and that he is turned Puritan in that point, admitting the Kings Ecclesiasticall supremacy no otherwise, but so, as they may safely grant it without change of opinion, yea subscribe, or sweare to it in the same sense that he teacheth it (and so perhaps such of them do as take the Oath of supremacy:
                  Andr. p. 15. §. verum.
               ) and this I say, I make no doubt to proue clearely in the next Chapter, quod scio punget Doctorem, as he sayd once of the Cardinall.
            82. To these examples of his egregious impudency in this kind, I may well adde one, or two other examples of his impudent assertion of notable lyes without allegation of authour, or witnesse; as when he chargeth certayne Iesuits to haue affirmed, or (as it seemeth) to haue written, that they cōmitted no sinne abannis,
               An impudent lye of M. Andrews touching certayne Iesuits. saith he, nescio quot, I know not for how many yeares togeather; which I dare boldly affirme to be a monstrous lye, I meane; that any Iesuit hath so written, or sayd eyther of himselfe, or any other man; for although I make no doubt but that many Iesuits, and other good men both Religious, and secular by the help of Gods grace, doe liue free from all mortall sinnes (that is to say such sinnes as do vtterly depriue men of Gods fauour, &amp; grace, and deserue eternall damnatiō) yet I am well assured, that no Catholyke will say, that any man liueth free from all sinnes (such I meane as are called veniall) which could not be sayd of the Apostles themselues, as S. Iohn testifieth,1. Iohn 1. saying, si dixerimus quod peccatum non habemus &amp;c. Yf we say that we haue no sinne, we seduce our selues, and truth is not in vs; and to the same purpose also the Scripture sayth els where,
                  Prouerb. 24. 
               Septies in die cadet iustus &amp;c. The iust mā shall fall seauen tymes

a day, and shall ryse againe.
            
            83. And this is so knowne, and firmely belieued of all Catholykes, that it is incredible that any one who professeth the Catholyke Religiō should affirme of any man (and much lesse be so vayne to say of him selfe) that he committed no sinne for some yeares; &amp; therefore M. Andrewes must not thinke it strange if we take this for an egregious lye, vntill he produce some other authour, or witnes then himselfe, as I doubt not but he would haue dōe, if he had any worth the naming, or els had not (perhaps) forgot his name, as well as the number of yeares in which those Iesuits committed no sinne, for so it appeareth by his ab annis, nescio quot; whereby we may see what substātiall tales he telleth vs, seeing he writeth, eyther he knoweth not, or at least he careth not what.
            84. The lyke I say also of another matter auowed by him with more particularities,Another egregious lye of M. Andrews cōcerning a Iesuit in prison. and circumstances, to wit, that a Iesuit being in Prison at the same tyme when he wrote, cōfessed vpon his owne accord without all compulsion, feare, or examination, (moued merely with remorse of conscience) that the Popesent to England 3. Buls of excommunication to be kept in readines, and published in three seuerall parts of the realme vpon the execution of the powder-plot, wherevpon he inferreth that the Pope must needs be priuy vnto the sayd plot. But for as much as I assure my selfe, and know right well, that no such Buls, as he mentioneth were euer made, I do not only deny the inference of the Popes knowledge of the powder-plot, but also may iustly charge M. Andrews to haue faygned the whole matter himselfe, vntill he name the Iesuit, who confessed it, yea, and procure him also to giue publyke

testimony of it, which by all lykelyhood would haue byn done long ere this, if any secular Priest, Iesuit, or other Catholyke man (of any credit, or reputation amongst Catholykes) had confessed, and acknowledged any such matter, especially in such manner as he hath declared.
            85. Besydes, that it is not vnknowne what Iesuits haue bin in prison of late yeares, or were when he wrote, whereby also it may easily be iudged by such as know them, how vnlykely it is, that any of them would (vpon pretence to discharge his conscience) charge, and stayne it with such a horrible forgery as this is. Neyther are we ignorant of the common practise of M. Andrews, and his fellow-ministers to calumniate, and slaunder such Catholike Priests, and Iesuits, as they haue vnder lock and key in close prison; whereof sufficient experience was seene when F. Garnet was in the tower, of whome a hundreth false bruits were spread, not only ouer all England, but also in forrein countries, yea ouer all christendome. And albeit he sufficiently purged, and cleared himselfe at his death of all the slanderous imputatious, yet M. Andrews is not ashamed still to auow some of them;
                  Andr. ca. 15. pag. 342. lin. 5.6. &amp; 7. as that he acknowledged by writing dyuers tymes vnder his owne hand, and thryse publykly at his death, that he had vnderstood of the powder-treason out of confession; whereas he publykely protested the contrary:F. Garnet impudently belyed by M. Andrews. for being greately vrged to confesse, and acknowledge that he heard it out of confession, he flatly denyed it, repeating thryse, neuer, neuer, neuer; and wheareas he was charged to haue already acknowledged it vnder his hand, he also denyed it, bidding his accusers shew it if they could; and of all

this I am well assured by the relation of credible persons, who were there present, and especially of an honorable Gentleman, who stood so nere him that he heard euery word he sayd, and hath vpon his credit, and conscience affirmed it vnto me. In so much that I dare boldly appeale for the truth of this matter, to the consciences, and knowledge of all those that were within the hearing of him; whome I also beseech to consider what credit is to be giuen to M. Andrews his report of the other thing touching the Iesuit in prison (which passed in secret) seeing he is so shameles to lye concerning a publyk matter, wherein he may be disproued by some hundreths of witnesses.
            86. But it is not to be wondered that he speaketh his pleasure of F. Garnet, and other Iesuits, whome he professeth to hate, seeing he vseth (as you haue heard) to bely the ancient Fathers, whom he pretendeth to loue and honour, for he that belieth those whome he supposeth to be his friends, will care litle what he saith of such as he holdeth for enemies. And this shall suffice for this matter, and Chapter, wherein I doubt not, but it euidently appeareth that M. Andrews will not yield a iote to M. Barlow for all kind of cosenages, lyes, and fraudulent deuises to couer the nakednes, and pouerty of his cause.
         
         
            
            THAT Mr. ANDREVVS OVERTHROWETH HIS owne cause, and fortifieth ours, granting many important points of Catholike Religion. THAT he is turned Puritan in the point of the Kings Ecclesiasticall Supremacy, and betrayeth his Maiesties cause vnder hād, pretēding to defend it: &amp; therfore is neyther good English Protestāt, nor yet good Subiect.

               NOvv ther resteth only one point to be handled which is of farre differēt quality from the former. For thou mayst remember, good Reader, that amongst many things which I censured and reproued in M. Barlow,
               
                  See Sup. c. 8. nu.
                I greatly allowed and approued one which is ordinary

in him, to wit, that he doth very often ouerthrow his owne cause, and fortifie ours, which truly is no lesse but rather more ordinarie in M. Andrews, as it may appeare by many examples which partly haue already occurred in this Adioynder, and partly may be noted throughout his whole worke. In the first Chapter I shewed how he confirmed (though against his will) the Catholick doctrine concerning the Primacy of the Pope, by the allegation of certaine places of S. Augustin 
               
                  See Cap. 1. nu. 3.4.5.22. &amp; 23. and S. Cyril, and of a place of Deuteronomy concerninge

Andrews seeinge euidently that the Protestants religion cannot be defended with any probabilitie in the rigour of the first groundes thereof layed by Luther, Caluin and others, taketh a new course; which is to see how neere he can goe to the Catholyke Religion and misse it, perswading himselfe that he shall be the more able in that manner to answere our obiections, and find alwaies some occasion or other which how litle soeuer it be, seemeth to him sufficient: for he maketh account that he shall allwayes be a Protestant good enough, if he be not a Catholike; wherein neuertheles it befalleth him as it doth to the fly that playeth with the flame, comming now and then so nere it, that she burneth her winges, and falleth into it, whereof you shall see sufficient experience in this Chapter.

            5. And then he addeth also further out of S. Augustine concerning the flesh of Christ in the Sacrament, &amp; cùm vel illam adoras, ait, ne cogitatione remaneas in carne &amp;c. And when thou adorest that (flesh) doe not (sayth Augustine) rest with thy cogitation in the flesh, wherby thou shalt not be quickned with the spirit, for the spirit, sayth he, quickneth, or giueth lyfe, the flesh profiteth nothing, thus saith M. Andrews out of S. Augustine, explicating notably how the very Sacramēt (that is to say the exteriour formes of bread &amp; wyne) may be adored, to wit, together with the persō of Christ which it conteineth: for as the humanity, or flesh of Christ in the Sacrament may be adored because it is ioyned with the Diuinity, so also the Sacrament conteyning Christ truely and really present, may be adored togeather with him, as the Kings royall Robe (saith M. Andrews) may be togeather with the Kings person, though not without it; so that in this point you see he teacheth the very same that we do, concerning the adoration of the blessed Sacrament, though Caluin

But M. Andrewes goeth much further, &amp; cōmeth indeed so neere the Catholike doctrine that he acknowledgeth it. For although he take some exceptions to merit, yet he vnderstandeth it otherwise then we doe, and so in effect doth not deny or impugne that which we teach concerning the same, notwithstanding his vayne cauils,

it with this restriction,

               non ex pondere humani meriti, sed ex vi promissi diuini, not by the weight of mans merit, but by the force of Gods promise, whereof grace is the foundatiō, by the which, saith he, our mercifull Sauiour hath promised mercedē plenam operi non pleno, mercedē diariā operi horario, a full hire to a scant or vnperfect worke, a daies wages to an howers worke.

Andrews, no doubt, vnderstand it, who proceedeth thus, And that which he promised of his me
                     •
                  re grace, and goodnes, he rendreth by Iustice; for he should not be iust except he should stand to his promise. Wee may say (to God) with conueniēt humility, giue me the reward which thou hast promised, but I thinke wee cannot say, giue me that which I haue deserued, or that which thou owest me for my merit; for setting aside the promise of God, there is not any sufficient tytle for the which,
               
                  Valent. 8.9.4. 
               God ought to recōpence such a worke with eternall lyfe. Thus saith M. Andrews.
            
            8. Wherein although he exclude all consideratiō of merit from the reward of works,M. Andrews granteth the merit of good workes by cōsequēce. neuertheles grā
               ting, as he doth, the reward to be due by the force of Gods promise, he granteth in effect as much as we desire. To which purpose, I wish two thinges to be noted in this his discourse, the one, that he speaketh clearly of eternall reward and lyfe euerlasting, acknowledging the same to be due to good workes by the force of Christs promise; the other that the merit

which he impugneth, is only such as excludeth the consideration of Gods promise, as it appeareth by the reason which he giueth out of Gregory de Valentia, to wit,
                  Andr. vbi supra.
                because setting aside the promise of God, there is not any sufficiēt tytle or cause why God is bound to reward good workes with lyfe euerlasting. This then being the reason why he excludeth merit, it is cleare that he doth not exclude the merit whereof we speake, nor conclude any thing against vs, but rather argueth for vs; for we are so farre from reiecting the consideration of Gods promise from our merit, that we graunt the merit of euerlasting lyfe especially thereupon.
            9. For albeit we teach, that the grace of God doth giue a great dignity and valour to the worke, and therefore cōcurreth to the merit thereof, yet we teach withall, that the same were not sufficient for the merit of eternall saluation,The cōsideratiō of Gods promise for the merits of Christ necessarily included in the cōsideratiō of our merit. if God had not promised it for the merits of our Sauiours passiō (which is the ground of all mans merit) &amp; therfore almighty God hauing couenanted and bargayned with vs to giue such a reward for such a worke, yea &amp; assisting vs with his grace to doe the worke, hath not only made himselfe our debter, if we doe it, but also maketh vs able to merit the reward promised. I say merit, though M. Andrewes doth not admit the word, who neuertheles doth acknowledge it sufficiētly whē he saith, that God hath promised, and will render mercedem diariam operi horario,
               Reward &amp; merit are correlatiues, &amp; cannot be, but in respect of one another. the dayes wages to an howers worke, for merces &amp; meritum, reward and merit are correlatiues, and cannot be the one, but in respect of the other, for reward is neuer due but to him that doth merit or deserue it, and he only that meriteth may iustly clayme reward. And therefore

the Apostle saith expressely, 
                  
                     •
                  i qui operatur mer
                     ••
                  s imputatur, non secūdum gratiam, sed secundum debitum: to him that worketh the reward is imputed, not according to Grace, but according to debt.
               M. Andrewes acknowledging the reward of the work granteth the merit of the worke, &amp; the worker.
            
            10. So as M. Andrews acknowledging that God hath promised, and doth render mercedem operi, a r
                     •
                  ward to the worke, doth consequently acknowledge meritum operis, &amp; operantis, the merit both of your worke, and of the worker; for, dignus est operarius mercede sua, (saith our Sauiour) the workman is worthy of his wages, that is to say, he meriteth or deserueth it. In which respect also the Apostle saith, Vnusquisque mercedem accipiet secundum laborem suum, Euery one shall receiue reward according to his labour, that is to say, as his labour deserueth, or as he meriteth for his labour. And a

                  al ability) yet when he had performed the condition, he claymed performance of the Couenant, and had her to wyfe; and afterwards when she was taken from him by Saul, &amp; giuen to Phaltiel, he required her againe (after Sauls death) not only because she was his wyfe, but also because he had bargayned for her, and got her by Couenāt,
                  
                     •
                  . Reg. 3. 
               quam despondi mihi, saith he, centū praeputijs Philistinorum; whome I betrothed vnto me, with a hundred prepuces of the Philistines, as who should say, that it was

reason he should haue her, because he had deserued her.
            11. And much more truly may the lyke be said of the good workes of iust men,The dignity of Gods grace increaseth the valew of merit. proceeding from Gods grace, which workes besids the couenant and promise of reward, are enobled also, and dignified by grace, and so made not only acceptable vnto God, but also much more worthy of the reward promised, then any moral workes could be, though God should promise to reward them eternally
                  •
                so that the dignity of Gods grace concurring in the good worke, with Gods promise of reward, maketh the same truly meritorious, be the worke neuer so smal, and the reward promised neuer so great; and therefore whosoeuer doth for the pure loue of God, forsake his lands, or parents, or wyfe, he meriteth that great reward which our Sauiour promised, to wit

And in this sense do all the Fathers teach the merit of workes so expressely, that not only the Magdeburgenses, but also Caluin taketh exceptions to them all, for vsing the word merit so frequently as they do, which indeed is most euident in theyr wrorkes, and may be seene by innumerable places of the sayd Fathers alledged by Cardinall Bellarmine and others, to proue the merit of good workes; which I pretermit, for that my meaning is not here so much to proue or confirme our doctrine in this poynt, as somewhat to explicate it, vpon this occasion offered.

but by the force of the promise,M. Andrews maketh an ydle distinctiō, and why
                     •
                  
                and not by the valour of the merit. This distinction, I say, is very impertinent for two causes, the one, for that it excludeth the effect by the cause, that is to say, the merit by the promise of reward, from whence the said merit groweth: for albeit we add thereto another consideration, to wit the dignitie of Gods grace, increasing the valour of the merit, yet the same followeth also vpon the promise, because God hath promised to reward eternally such workes only as proceed from his grace, and are dignified thereby, and consequently made the more meritorious, in which respect we allwayes say with S. Augustine,
               
                  S. Aug. ep. 105. that omne bonum meritum nostrum non facit in nobis nisi gratia, nothing but grace doth cause in vs all our good merit, and cùm Deus coronat merita nostra, nihil aliud coronat nisi munera sua, When God doth crowne our merits,
               M. Andrews cannot deny, that the dignity of Gods grace increaseth the valour of merit, except he will take part with the Pelagians.
                he doth crowne nothing els but his owne guifts. And truly I cannot see how M. Andrewes can deny that grace increaseth the valour of the merit, except he will take part with Pelagius the heretike, and impugne the dignity of Gods grace, so as he must needes graunt that the worthines of grace being added to the force of Gods promise, doth make the worke more worthie of reward. The other cause why I say the distinction is ydle (or rather M. Andrews for making it) is because he maketh the same to confute the Cardinall, as if the Cardinall did exclude the Consideration of Gods promise from the reward of workes, whereof he might see the contrary in the Cardinalls controuersies,
                  Bellar. de Iustifi
                        •
                     . lib. 5. c. 14. where he debated the question at large, and substantially proueth the necessity of Gods promise to make a worke meritorious, and therefore wheras

               M. Andrews seeketh also to proue the same by 
                  Greg. de valē. de effec. grat. disput. 8. quaest. 16. punct. 4. 
               Gregorius de Valentia whom he alledgeth to that purpose (as if he would cōfute the Cardinall by one of his owne profession) he is, as I haue said, very impertinent therin, labouring to proue that which the Cardinall denyeth not, but expressely teacheth. So as, you see still M. Andrewes doth nothing els but idly beate the aire, and fight with his owne shaddow, impugning only his owne conceit, and in the rest granting our doctrine concerning the reward and merit of good workes. Thus much for this point.

                  Cap. 6. nu. 10. Chapter of his changing the state of the question, one was concerning the veneration of reliques, for that he will

                  See before Ca. 6. nu. 11. Apoc. 19. &amp; 22. labouring to proue that adoration is not to be taken otherwayes, then for deuine honour; but in this I haue sufficiently shewed his ignorance and absurdity, and haue also proued 
                  Ibid. from nu. 10. to nu. 31. that we do not honor and worship reliques with diuine adoration, but with a Religious worship due to holy men, or holy things for the honor and loue of God: in which point it seemeth M. Andrews agreeth fully with vs, confessing that the dead bodyes and reliques of holy Martyrs, and Saynts (which are truely knowne to be such) are to be honoured,

The King also will haue the same to be solemnly carried into an honorable place.
            14. And afterwards answering to a place of S. Ambrose which the Cardinall obiecteth, he saith that wheras Ambrose will haue vs to honor the body of the dead Martyr,

Ambrose speaketh, because it is due, and exhibited to Saynts for the honour and loue of God whose seruants they are,
                  S. Hieron. vbi supra.
                
               quin seruorum honos, saith S. Hierome, redundat ad Dominum, the honor of the seruants redoundeth to their Lord. In which respect the same holy Father signifieth that all the adoration which was done to the Reliques of the Prophet Samuel (when they were transported with great solemnity and honour from Palestine to Constantinople) was not done so much to Samuel as to Christ, whose Leuite &amp; Prophet Samuel was, as I haue signified more at large in the last 
                  See ca. 9. nu. 25. Chapter
            15. Whereby it appeareth that the honor done to the seruants of Christ for Christs sake only (and not for any ciuil and temporall respect) must needes be a religious honour: such I meane, as I haue declared in

the last 
                  Ibidem nu. 14.15 Chapter to haue bin often exhibited in the holy Scripture to Angells, and holy men with the terme of adoration, and with the exhibition of a Corporall reuerence, which may be more or lesse according to the deuotion of the exhibitours thereof, so that it be in their mind and intention distinguished from diuine honour due to God alone, in which intention consisteth the true difference and distinction of diuine, religious, and ciuil adoration, as I haue also declared before in the last 
                  Ibidem
                Chapter. So as M. Andrews confessing an honor to be due to holy Reliques, cannot with reason exclude from the same any Corporall reuerence, so that the intention be to doe only a religious and not diuine worship; As he must needs also acknowledge the lyke in ciuil adoration and honor done to Princes and great personages.
            16. For whereas the same is diuersly performed, somtymes by putting of the cap, sometymes by bowing the body, and somtymes by kneeling, and other whiles also by prostration vpon the ground (which maner of ciuill adoration is often mentioned in the old testament, and was vsed in tymes past amongst the Persians to their Kinges) there is no doubt, but that as all these may lawfully be vsed whē the intention is no other but to do a Ciuill honor thereby, so also the least of them were vnlawfull, yea Idolatry, if the intention of the doer were to giue thereby a diuine honor to any man: and the lyke, I say must needes be graunted, concerning the externe honor due to the holy Reliques of Saints, which how great it was in the tyme of S. Ambrose, S. Hierome,
               
                  S. Hieron. aduers. Vigilant.
                and S. Augustine we may vnderstand by the custome then vsuall to kisse them for deuotion sake; and to

carry them about in procession (as we now terme it) with great solemnity and reuerence; which appeareth not only in S. Hierome, who seuerely reprehended Vigilantius for carping at the same (as I haue signified in the last 
                  Cap. 6. nu 22.23.24. &amp; 25. Chapter) but also by the testimony of S. 
               
                  S. Aug de ciuit. Dei l. 22. ca. 8. 
               Augustine, who recounteth diuerse Miracles done by reliques while they were so carried by Bishops; as namely that Lucillus the Bishop was himselfe cured of a fistula carrying a certaine relique of S. Stephen, populo praecedente &amp; sequente, the people going before him, and following him; and that a blind woman being brought to the Bishop Proiectus, as he carried Sacra pignora (so termeth he the holy Reliques of S. Stephen) was restored to her sight by applying to her eyes certayne flowers which had touched them.
            17. Such was the honour that Catholike people bare to holy Reliques in those dayes, that they sought either to touch them, or to haue some thing that had touched them, or bene neere about them; whereby diuers great Miracles were done,
                  Idem ibid.
                yea dead men reuiued, as S. Augustine testifieth in the same place by diuers examples which he relateth, and therefore I leaue it to the Iudgment of any reasonable man how great the deuotion, and the religious honour was which then was vsuall in the Church, and allowed by these Fathers to be done to the reliques of Saints, especially seeing that the same was also approued, and confirmed from heauen by innumerable Miracles; which M. Andrewes himselfe granteth, saying, Augustino assentimur &amp;c. we grant with Augustin that the body of the Protomartyr was conueniently,
               
                  Andr. vbi supra. p. 5. or duely to be honored, after that it pleased god to worke certaine Miracles

thereat.
               M. Andrewes granteth that Miracles were dōne at the reliques of Martyres in S. Augustins time So he; wherein besides the graunt of due honour to be done to holy reliques (whereof now I speake) I wish also to be noted, that he graunteth that Miracles were done in Gods Church in S. Augustins tyme, which most of the Sectaries of these daies haue hitherto denyed, affirming that Miracles ceassed after the tyme of the Apostles, which they are forced to say because we exact of them to shew Miracles in their Church as an vndoubted signe of the true Church; shewing on our part the continuance thereof in our Church from the Apostles to this day, whereof sufficient experience hath bene seene in euery age,Many notable miracles lately done at Valētia in Spayne. and euen now lately by innumerable cures of all sorts of diseases, at Sichem in Flanders, at Minich in Bauiere, in diuerse partes of Italy, and at this present at Valentia in Spaine, at the body of a holy Preist who dyed in April last, all so publick and so sufficiently testified to the world, that impudencie it selfe cannot deny the truth thereof.
            18. So that seeing M. Andrewes graunteth that Miracles were done in the Church of God, for 4. hundreth yeares, and we can proue the continuance thereof in our Church vntill this day, either he must shew vs in what age they ceassed after S. Augustines time, and why then rather then before, yea and proue also that all the miracles done in the Catholike Church euer since, haue bene diabolicall illusions; or els he must confesse, that the Protestants Church is not the true Church,No Miracles done in the protestants Church. seeing that they haue not hitherto had so much as a lame or sickd og healed in all their Congregations by the vertue of any of their profession dead or aliue, notwithstanding their liuely and strong faith whereof they are wont so much to vaunt. And this I say the rather, because I find that M. Andrewes is verie

silent about this point, euen when the Cardinall giueth him sufficient cause to speake thereof, who answering an obiection of the Apology for the Oath concerning witchcraft imputed to Catholikes (because they quench fire with Agnus Deis) sayth

               Andrewes comming to answere that paragraph which beginneth with those words, left them out wholly, and setteth downe the next wordes following for the beginning of the Cardinalls text in that place, perhaps he lakt

                  . nu. 31. he sayd he would leaue out sometimes.
            19. But to conclude concerning holy Reliques, it appeareth sufficiently hereby that M. Andrewes graunteth as much concerning them as we desire, to wit, that they are to be decked, and adorned, layd vp with honour and solemnitie, reserued and kept in honourable and holy places, and finally that they are to be honored, yea and that God doth somtimes worke Miracles by thē (which he cannot deny to be a notable and diuine confirmation of the honour that is done vnto them) and therefore for as much as the honour that he graunteth to be due vnto them, is neither diuine honour (which both he and we conclude in this case) nor ciuill honour, (seeing it is not done for any temporall or ciuill respect, but proceedeth out of deuotion, and tendeth directly to the honour of God) he must needs graunt it to be a religious honour, and that the same may be exhibited with much more externall worship and reuerence then the ciuill honour or worship, which is due to any Prince: yea so

much more, as respect of deuotion and Religion surpasseth and excelleth temporall and ciuil respects: so that if ciuill honour do require corporall reuerēce with cap and knee, bowing and prostrating of the body, much more doth the Religious honour due to Saints, and their Reliques require the same. Thus much for this point.
            20. Whereas the Cardinall hauing occasion to speak of Monks,

                and Religious women, he saith, that their Institute cannot be reprehended, except we reprehend all the Fathers of the first 500. yeares, M. Andrews grāteth it to be true,
                  Andr. c. 12. p. 284. §. nec instituta
                  
                     •
                  
                for he saith that his Maiesty meāt not to reprehend the Institute of Monks, but the Monkes thēselues, because they haue long since gone frō their Instituts or rule, being degenerated into Locusts, apud quos, saith he, desidia nimium verè, nimium saepe in luxuriam despumauit, whose Idlenes, or sloath hath too truly, and too oft turned to a very foame, or froath of luxurious and licentious life. So he, and then he addeth, that because their Institute was not of the diuine law, but only of the positiue, and now gone in merum abusum, into a meere abuse, therfore it is worthily antiquated, or abolished amōgst the Protestants; wherin that which I wish especially to be noted, is, that he approueth the first Institute of Monks, and consequently must needs approue diuers important pointes of Catholike doctrine, and vtterly condemne his owne Religion.
            21. For it is most euident that the first Institut and discipline of Religious life,In what consisted the religious disciplin of the ancient Monks. consisted principally, as still it doth, in the obseruation of the Euangelicall Counsells of our Sauiour, to wit, of voluntary pouety, Chastity, and obedience, abnegation of a mans selfe, and Chastisment of his flesh, by fasting, Pennance, wearing

of hairecloath, disciplines, &amp; diuers other Mortificatiōs as it is manifest partly in the Monasterial discipline obserued by the first Monkes in the Apostles time, and related by Philo

                and other Fathers of the first 400. yeares, to omit S. Benets Rules yet extant which were made in the age following. So that M. Andrewes approuing the Institutes of the old Monks, alloweth the practise of all that Catholicke doctrine before mentioned, which other Sectaries of this time haue hitherto condemned, derided and abhorred, as repugnant to the liberty of their Ghospell and their owne sensuality.
            22. Besides that, he also approueth thereby workes of supererogation, (such I mean as are not commanded, but counselled and left to our owne free choice) and consequently he granteth the difference betwixt a Counsell, &amp; a Precept, contrary to the doctrin of Luther Caluin, and other Sectaries. Finally he alloweth vowes of Pouertie, Chastity, and Obedience which are, and alwaies haue bene as it were, the link and band of Monasticall and Religious profession, as it appeareth euidently in the ancient Fathers, as in Dionysius S. Paules disciple, who testifieth that those who were made Monkes in his time (which was the tyme of the Apostles) made a solemne promise and couenant before the Altar to renounce the world, and imbrace the Monasticall lyfe. And S. Basil writing to a Monke

                  fessed coram multis testibus, before many witnesses: and in his Monasticall rules signifieth that he which hath vowed himself to God in this Religious profession, and passeth afterward to another state of life, sacrilegij se scelere obstringit, is guilty of Sacriledg, because he hath, saith he, as it were stolne himselfe from God, to whome he had dedicated and consecrated himselfe.
            
            23. Also S. Augustine saith to the same purpose, Nemo potiùs in Monasterio frater dicat &amp;c. Let no brother or religious man that is in a monasterie, say, I will leaue and forsake it, or that it is not to be thought, that only those shall be saued who liue in Monasteries, or that others which liue abroad, do not pertaine to god, for to him that should say so, it is to be answered, illi non vouerunt, tu vouisti. They haue not vowed, but thou hast vowed. So he. Finally Ioannes Cassianus who liued also in the same tyme, treating of the perfection of Religious men, and hauing said, that inestimable glory in heauen, is promised them yf they keep their Rules, and most grieuous paines prepared for them if they neglect them, concludeth, Meliusest enim &amp;c. For it is better according to the sentence of the Scripture not to vow, then to vow and not to performe it. Thus saith Cassianus, to whome I might add many other witnesses,
                  Ioan Cass. de Iustit. renūti. li 4. c. 13. but that it is needlesse, seing these may suffice to shew M. Andrews allowing as he doth the Instituts of the Monks of the primitiue Church must needes admit, &amp; allow religious vowes of Pouerty, Chastity, &amp; Obedience, whereto all Religious men are, and euer haue bene bound by their Institutes.
            
            24. So as it is cleare by all this, that in this one point he hath graunted diuers important points of

               Catholike religion, yea and vtterly condemned his owne, which denyeth and impugneth all those things practised in Monasticall lyfe, according to the first Institutes thereof. Besides that it also followeth therō, that his religion is vtterly voyd of all christian perfection, which specially consisteth in the true imitation of Christs lyfe, by the obseruation of the Euangelicall Counsells professed and practised in Religious discipline; for which cause all the Ancient Fathers placed the highest perfection of christian Religion therein, as I haue euidently shewed in any Supplement by the clear testimonies of S. Dionysius Areopagita,
               
                  See supl. c. 7. nu. 59. &amp; 60. 
               Eusebius, S. Gregory Nazianzen, S. Basil, S. Chrisostome, S. Hierome, S. Augustin, Sozomenus, &amp; S. Bernard.
            
            25. Therefore it litle importeth for the matter in hand what he iangleth against Monkes: for put the case it were true that they were all degenerated from their first institute (as it is most false, and affirmed by him without any proofe, and therfore to be answered with a bare deniall) yet it suffiseth for the proofe of that which I haue heere vndertaken,M. Andrews approuing the first institute of monks approueth many important points of Catholke Religion. that the sayd institut consisted in the practise of many notable, and important points of Catholike religion, and that he hath by an euident consequent granted, and approued the said points, together with the institut against the currēt of the doctrine, and profession of all his fellowes; in which respect I shall not need to trouble thee, good Reader with any answere to the rest of his impertinēt discourse, and namely to his friuolous stale obiection, concerning the idlenes of Monkes,
               
                  See Card. Bellar. l. de. monachis. c. 42 43. &amp; seq.
                answered fully long since by dyuers Catholiks, and namely by Cardinall Bellarmine in his Controuersies, whereto I remit him, because I am forced to hast to an end: for otherwise

truly, I would not only say somewhat therto, but also I would examine, and debate with him 2. or 3. other points which he toucheth, and especially what was the true cause, why monasticall profession was first abrogated amongst the Protestants, and why they pretending to reforme the Church in these our dayes, did rather quite abolish the institute of Monks, thē seeke to restore it to the first integrity, if it were good at the first, and only fallen to decay, and corruption, as he signifieth.
            26. For whereas he seemeth to giue two causes thereof, the one that Monkes were growne to be idle, and the other, that their idlenes was turned to licentiousnes; if that were true, those reformers should rather haue sought to redresse the abuse, and to reduce the Monkes to their first rules, then to antiquate the whole Institute, which being grounded vpon the holy Scriptures, the expresse Counsels of our Sauiour, and the example of his lyfe, was ordeyned 
                  See Supplem Chap 7. n. 58 59.60. by the Apostles (as I haue shewed in my Supplement) and doth conteyn in it all true Christian perfection according to the opinion of all the Fathers, in which respect it could not by any humane authority be lawfully abrogated, and taken quite out of the Church. Besides that it is euident that the Ringleaders in that pretended reformation, I meane Luther, Oecol

                  mpadius, Bucer, Peter Martyr, Ochinus, Michonius, Menius, Musculus, Pelicanus, Pomeranus, and Munsterus, being all of them Votaries, that is to say Monkes, Fryars, and religious men, abolished the Institutes of monasticall lyfe, only because they themselues were so transported with the fury of lust, and sensuality, that they could no longer indure the restraint therof in religious discipline.
            
               27. And therefore they resolued not only to teach most beastly and fleshly doctrine tending to all liberty of the flesh (as that, it

                  S. Basil. de vera virginitate. The first Euangelists of the Protestants Ghospell, were the true Locusts that destroyed religiou

                   profession and perfection. 
               Basil saith of such) did seek to couer stupri scelus honesto cōiugij nomine, the wickednes of whordome with the honest name of Marriage, most of them taking harlots vnder the name of wiues.
            28. So as M. Andrewes may see who were indeed those Locusts, whose slothfull idlenes turning to a froath of licencious lyfe destroyed monasticall perfection and profession amongst the Prostestants, to wit, the very first Apostles, and Euangelists of their Ghospell, I meane the votaries aboue named, and other such of their humour, and crew, who being

weary of the seuerity of Monasticall discipline became Apostata's, and renegats, and the better to cloake and excuse their owne Apostasy, not only sought to abrogate all monasticall discipline, but did also set abroach the new doctrine which M. Andrewes and all other Protestants now professe, and therefore it is easie to iudg what good fruit such bad trees could yield, and consequently from what spirit as well the abrogation of monasticall profession amongst the Protestants, as their whole doctrine proceedeth. And thus much for this point.
            29. The Cardinall to proue that the name Catholike doth most properly belong to them that liue in the vnitie, and obedience of the Roman Church, alleageth S. Ambrose; who hauing declared that his brother Satyrus being by shipwrack cast vpon a coast where there were many Schismatiks called Luciferiās,
               That the name Catholike belongeth only to the Apostolike Roman Church, &amp; to the children thereof. asked the Bishop of the place, whether he did agree with the Catholike Bishops, and explicated the same presently saying, id est, an cum Romana Ecclesia consentiret, that is to say, whether he agreed with the Roman Church, whereto M. Andrewes answereth that Ambrose did aske the Bishop with great reason whether he agreed with the Roman Church, sciebat enim Episcopum tum Romae Catholicum, for he knew that the Bishop of Rome then was a Catholike. So he; wherin he granteth consequently that the Pope is supreme and vniuersall Pastor of the whole Church,
                  Andr. c. 5. pag. 125. §. Quod affert.
                for that must needes follow of his grant; seeing it is euident that he who then was Bishop of Rome, and whom he alloweth for Catholik, had, and exercised a supreme and vniuersall authority; to which purpose it is to be considered who was Bishop of Rome at that time; wherto M. Andrewes himselfe giueth vs no small light, signifying

presently after, that Liberius was Bishop a litle before him; and sure it is, that Damasus succeeded Liberius, and reygned many yeares, who therefore must needes be the Catholike Bishop that M. Andrewes meaneth.
            30. Now then what authority Damasus had, and exercised during his raigne, it appeareth sufficiently by that which I signified before concerning him and his supremacy, in the 4. 
                  See Chap. 4. nu. 57.58. &amp; sequent.
                Chapter, where I shewed that the same was acknowledged not only in Affrick, by the Byshops of 3. African Synods, who in a commō Epistle to him, gaue cleare and euident testimony thereof, but also in the East Church, euen by the chief Patriarkes therof, to wit, by 
                  Ibid. nu. 61. 
               Peter the holy Bishop of Alexandria, who immediately succeeded Athanasius and being expelled from his Church by the Arians, fled to Pope Damasus,
               
                  
                     Magdeb. cent. 4. c. 10.
                  
                     Socrat. l. 4. c. 30.
                and by the vertue and authority of his letters was restored to his seat, as the Magdeburgians themselues do relate, out of the Ecclesiasticall histories. And in the Church of Antioch, his authority was acknowledged by Paulinus Byshop therof, receiuing instructions and orders from him,
                  Cap. 4. nu. 62. for the absolution of Vitalis the Heritick. Also afterwards 
                  Ibid. nu. 63. 
               Theopilus Byshop of Alexandria, and S. Chrysostome Byshop of Constantinople, were suters to him to obtain pardon for Flauianus Byshop of Antioch, as may be seene more particulerly in the fourth Chapter of this Adioynder, where I haue also set downe the cleer
                  Ibid. nu. 58. &amp; 59. testimonies of some Fathers, who liued at the same time, and euidently acknowledged his supremacy.
            31. So that M. Andrewes granting that Pope Damasus was a Catholike Bishop, and that the Church of Rome was in such integrity vnder him, that S. Ambrose
               
had reason to hold none for Catholickes, but such as held vnion therewith. It m
                  •
               st needs follow that the supreme and vniuersall authority, which Pope Damasus had and vsed, was not vsurped, but due to him, &amp; his Sea, and consequently to his successors. And wheras M. Andrewes signifieth that the Roman Church, and Bishops were not alwaies in the like integrity, that they were at that time, to wit, neither a little before in the time of Liberius, nor shortly after in the time of Honorius, because both of them subscribed to heresy, (as he saith) I will not now stand to debate that point with him, both because I should digresse too much from the matter in hand (hauing here vndertaken to shew what he granteth in fauour of Catholicks, &amp; not to disproue what he denieth or affirmeth otherwise) as also because he may see those old and stale obiections fully answered by the Cardinall himself in his Cō

            32. There followeth presently after a large and liberall grant of M. Andrews right worth the noting. For wheras the Cardinall still prosecuteth the same matter (touching the application of the name Catholicke to the Roman Church) and hauing produced the precedent authority of S. Ambrose remitteth his Reader for further proofe therof, to the last page of his

                former Booke (which was his Answere to the Apology for the Oath) it is to be vnderstood, that in the said book and page, he proueth by the authority of 3. Ancient Fathers (to wit

               S. Augustine) that the name Catholike is a most true

and proper note of the true Church, and that it could neuer be vsurped by Hereticks, yea and that our aduersaries themselues (namely in the Apology for the Oath) do so call vs,
                  Andr. c. 5. p. 125. Nam quae.
                and distinguish vs from themselues by that name, and do consequently acknowledge vs to be members of the true Church, whereto M. Andrews answereth thus. Nam quae in extrema pagina &amp;c. For as for those things which the Cardinall wrote in the last page of his former booke, and would gladly haue his Reader to see, fatemur omnia, we graunt and acknowledge them all. So he. Whereby he granteth that we being called Catholiks, euen by our aduersaries themselues haue the true signe &amp; note of the true Church, and are therefore true members thereof, and that he and his fellowes, who haue not the same note are Heretikes or Schismatiks. For this is in effect the Argumēt of the Cardinall, grounded vpon the authority of the Fathers aforesayd, which (you see) M. Andrews graunteth saying, fatemur omnia.
            
            
               
                  Andr. vbi supra.
               33. And albeit he seeketh presently an euasion, by a distinction, yet it helpeth him nothing, for thus he saith. Nec de nominis honore lis vlla, sed vtri è re magis nomen habeant,
               
                  M. Andr. his distinction helpeth him nothing. 
               neyther is there any contention (betwixt vs) about the honour of the name, but whether of both haue the name (deriued) from the thing. So he, allowing vs as you see, the honor of the name (for the which he saith they do not contend with vs) and calling in question only to whome belongeth the thing, signified by that name, whereas neuertheles it is euident, that according to the authorities alledged and vrged by the Cardinall out of the Fathers, the name and the thing expressed by the name do alwaies so cōcur, that they are neuer separated; for which cause those Fathers

do hold and teach, that the very name, and word Catholyke is an euident note, to distinguish the true Catholike faith and Church, from the false doctrine and Congregation of Heretickes, which they could not do, if some might haue only the name Catholike, and others the faith, or Church which it signifieth.
            34. And therefore S. Augustine in the place alledged by the Cardinall,
                  Aug. vbi supra. Item de vera religione c. 7. saith that the very name Catholike held him in the Catholike Church: quod (saith he) non sine caus
                     •
                   inter tot haereses ista Ecclesia sola obtinuit, which name this Church only hath obteyned amongst so many heresies not without cause. So saith S. Augustine, whereto the other Fathers, which the Cardinall also cyteth, do agree, all teaching that heretikes or hereticall congregations neuer did or could vsurpe the name Catholike, but that the same hath alwayes been, and euer shall be peculiar to the true Church; wherby they teach euidently that the name, and the thing signified by the name do euer concur. So as M. Andrews granting not only the Fathers doctrine in this poynt, but also giuing vs freely the honour of the name, alloweth vs to haue the thing expressed by the name, and so in conclusion with his fatemur omnia, he acknowledgeth vs for true Catholiks and himselfe, and his fellowes for heretikes,
               
                  Luc. c. 19. and therefore I may well say vnto him with our Sauiour in the Ghospell ex ore tuo te iudico serue nequam.
            
            35. And the lyke I may also say concerning his grant in another matter,
                  Andr. c. 7. pa. 168. §. Nam de nostr. to wit, that our Bishops are true Bishops, and that the Protestant Bishops of Englād had their ordination from ours, yea from 3. of ours (for so he giueth to vnderstand) whereupon he also

inferreth, that he and his fellow Superintēdents haue a true ordination and succession from the Catholike Church, whereas the quite contrary followeth vpon his grant, for if our Bishops be true Bishops (as hauing a true successiō from the Apostles) and that the protestant Bishops haue no other lawfull ordinatiō but from ours, two consequents do directly follow thereon, the one; that we haue the true Church and doctrine if M. Andrewes his fellow and friend M. Barlow

                say true, who in his famous sermon (mentioned by me 
                  See before chap. 6. nu. 77. els where) affirmeth, the Successiue propagation of Bishops from the Apostles, to be the mayne roote of Christian Society (according to S. Augustine) and the mayne proofe of Christian doctrine (according to Tertullian) as I haue shewed amply in my 
                  See Suppl. Chap. 4. nu. 54.55. &amp; seq.
                Suplement, and proued thereby that M. Barlow, and his fellowes are (e) heretykes and Schismatikes. The other consequent is, that if the English Protestant Bishops had no other lawfull ordination then from the Catholikes, they had none at all; for that at the chāge of religion in Queen Elizabeths tyme, they were not ordayned by any one Catholyke Bishop and much lesse by three (as M. Andrews saith they were) but by themselues, and by the authority of the Parliament as I haue also declared at large in my Supplement 
                  Suppl. ca. 5. nu. 2.3.4. &amp; 5.. Where neuertheles, I am to aduertise thee, good Reader, of an errour not corrected amongst the faults escaped in the Print. For, whereas it is said there, they had almost seduced an Irish Archbishop, and perswaded him to consecrate some of them Byshops, there want certaine wordes, to wit, a Welsh Bishop, hauing in vaine sollicited, which words, are to be inserted thus; they had almost seduced a Welsh Bishop (hauing in vaine solicited
               
an Irish Archbishop) and perswaded him to consecrate some of them Bishops after the Catholike manner &amp;c. And agayne a litle after, whereas it is said thus; seeing the Irish Bishop would not performe his promise, they resolued to ordaine themselues &amp;c. there want also these words, cons
                     ••
                  t, nor the Welsh Bishop; which words are to be added thus
                  •
                seeing the Irish Bishop would not cōsent, nor the Welsh Bishop performe his promise, they resolued to ordayne themselues. Thus, I say, it should be corrected.
            
               36. Whereby it may euidently appeare what a beggarly Church and Clergy they then had,What a beggarly Church &amp; Clergy the Sectaries haue in England
                   and still haue: for hauing then not so much as any pretended Archbishop, or Bishop of their owne profession, they were forced to begg their consecration euen of the Catholikes their aduersaries, and hauing solicited an Archbishop in vaine, and being out of hope to haue the consent of a Metropolitan to their ordination, &amp; much more to be consecrated by 2. or 3. Bishops, according to the ancient Canons of the Church, they determined, as I may say, to play small game, rather then to sit forth, being desirous to haue some kind of ordination from any one Catholik, though inferiour Bishop, yea and in fyne they sought to haue it from such a one, as was held to be the simplest man that then was, or perhaps euer had bene of the English Clergy; for so indeed was esteemed the Bishop of Land

Peter head of the Apostles, to take away all occasion of Schisme, yea and that he gaue him as much authority as was necessary to that end, whereupon I inferred necessarily that not only S. Peter but also his successours haue all that power, and authority which we attribute vnto them (as may be seene in the third Chapter

But his opinion concerning the Kings Ecclesiasticall supremacy will be much more manifest, if we consider what a poore conceipt he hath of it, and how he abaseth it, being so farre from graunting it, to be a principall article of faith, (as we hold the Popes Primacy to be) that he saith it is, ne articulus quidem, not so much as an Article, vtpote de exteriori modo regimine &amp;c. as of a thing which concerneth only the externall gou

Therefore it is inough if it be without the compasse of faith, so that it may haue place only amongst orthodox, or true doctrine. So he;

                and to the same purpose he also saith in another place, that it is a truth, but extra symbolum, out of the creed,
               The Ecclesiastical Supremacy of temporall Princes, may be in M. Andrews his Pater noster but is not in his Creed.
                so that it may perhaps be come into his Pater noster, but is not yet into Creed. Whereupon diuers things might be inferred worth the noting; but I will touch only two or three.
            39. If the Kings Supremacy be not a matter of Faith, then is it neither expressely taught in Scripture, nor necessarily deduced from it; for if it were, then must it needes be a matter of Faith, and therevpon it followeth that although M. Andrews doe alleage Scripture to proue it, yet he himselfe is of opinion that it is but only probably gathered out of Scripture, and consequently that a man may without daunger of damnation, choose whether he will belieue it or no. For of thinges which are in Controuersy, and not defined, but only probably gathered out of Scripture, a man may without daunger of his soule adhere to eyther parte, which truly may serue for a great Motiue to all Protestants to make small account of the Kinges Ecclesiasticall Su

seeing that so great a Doctor as M. Andrewes, (who pretendeth expresly to maintaine and defend it) teacheth,The oath of the supremacy vnlawful, if the supremacy be no matter of faith that it is no matter of faith. Besides that I cannot see how he can approue the Oath of the Kings Ecclesiasticall supremacy, to be lawfully tēdred or taken, as of an vndoubted truth, if it be no matter of faith. For he that sweareth a thing to be simply true, which he doth not certainly belieue, but only is probably perswaded that it is true,

               M. Andrews denieth it saying, tantum abest &amp;c. It is so farre from being (so new as the Cardinall saith (to wit) a thousand fiue hundred yeares after Christ) that it was a thousand fiue hundred yeares before Christ was borne. Neither was Henry the 8. the Authour of that in our age, but Moyses in his, who hauing put off (or laid away) his Priesthood, was neuerthelesse aboue Aaron: and when he gaue to the King the Law, he gaue him withall the chiefe power to keepe Religion (which is the first and chiefest part of the Law) and to

cause it to be kept. So he. Wherein he giueth two reasons or groundes out of the old Law, for the spirituall Supremacy of temporall Princes. The one because Moyses laid aside his Priesthood (and being therfore but a temporall man) was superiour to Aaron.
               M. Andrews his grosse ignorance. And the other, because he gaue to Kings, the chief power and charge of Religion, when he gaue them the copy of the Law.
            41. In the former point of the two, he notably bewrayeth his owne ignorance, in saying that Moyses laid aside his Priesthood, or ceased to be Priest, after he was once Priest, as if Moyses his Priesthood had bin like to the Ministry of the Protestants, which may be put of and on like a Ierkin, or a Cloake when they list, whereas his Priesthood was so permanent and inseparably annexed to his person, that albeit he might cease from the execution of the function, yet he could neuer put off the power of his Priesthood during his life. Besides that he was so farre from putting off his Priesthood, that he was not only still Priest after Aaron was consecrated,
                  S. Aug. Quaest. in. Leuit. li. 3. quaest. 23. but also (as S. Augustine teacheth expresly) chief Priest either togeather with Aaron, or els aboue him. Ambo, saith he, tunc summi Sacerdotes erant: both Moyses and Aaron were thē high Priests, or rather was not Moyses high Priest, and Aaron vnder him? Thus saith S. Augustine, wherby you see how weake and seelly is M. Andrews his first reason grounded vpon his own ignorant conceipt, that Moyses left off his Priesthood, and that neuertheles he was still superiour to Aaron, being a meere temporall Prince (for if he meant not so, his argument, for the temporall Princes supremacy is not worth a rush:) but you haue heard out of S. Augustine, that Moyses was not only a Priest after the

Consecration of Aaron, but also chief Priest, I meane aboue Aaron in which respect it may be thought that God commaunded Moyses &amp; not Aaron to cloath Eleazar Aaron Sonne

               nce of Aaron himself, to succeed him in the office of high Priest:
            42. In his second reason (concerning the chiefe power and charge of Religion giuen to Kings by Moyses togeather with the copy of the Law) he sheweth most euident and notorious malice in the manifest abuse &amp; corruption of Scripture,M. Andrew his notorious malice in the abuse of holy Scripture. no such thing, but rather the cleane contrary, being to be gathered out of that place of Deuteronomy,
               
                  Deut. 17. where Moyses ordayned that the copy of the Law, should be giuen by the Priestes, to the future Kings. I say future, for that there was no King ouer Gods people in the time of Moyses,

Barlow with the euident abuse of this place of holy Scripture in diuers respects, and therfore I beseech thee good Reader, take paines to reuiew what I haue said there, if thou dost not well remember it. So as I may now conclude vpon these two reasons of M. Andrews, that he is both an ignorant and a corrupt Doctor: ignorant in affirming that Moyses laid a way his Priesthood, and corrupt in notably abusing the holy Scriptures.

                I haue sufficiently answered therto in my Supplement, where I haue proued first, that the law of Moyses did expressely and manifestly giue to the high Preist the supreme authoritie not only in

matters of religion, but also euen in temporall affaires, forasmuch as concerned the decision of doubts and difficult questions. Secondly that the

                examples do clearly proue the contrary. And lastly that although it were true, that Kings were superiour to Preists in the old law, yet it doth not 
                  nu. 53.54.55. &amp; 56. follow theron that they are so now also in the new law, as well because the law of Moyses (at least the iudiciall and ceremoniall part thereof) was wholly abrogated by the law of Christ, as also because our Sauiour ordained a new and farr more excellent Preisthood, &amp; manner of gouernment in his Church, which beginning in the Apostles and spirituall Pastors, was continued also most euidently in them for 300: yeares, without interruption (to wit during the paganisme of the Emperours) and no new cōmission euer since that tyme knowne to be giuen by Christ to Kings, whereby they were authorized to take vpon them the gouerment of the Church.
            44. So that I am to demaund of M. Andrews (as I also did of M. Barlow in my 
                  See sup. Chap. 1. nu. 83. &amp; 84. It cannot be shewed how Kings af
                     •
                  ter they were Christened came to haue the gouernment of the Church. 
               Supplement) how, and by what Commission the supreme authority in Ecclesiasticall affayres was transferred from the Apostles and their Successors, to Kings after they were Christened; seeing that they can neyther claime any succession therin from the Kinges of the old law (which as I haue said was quite abrogated by Christ) nor pretend any new authority giuen thē
               
in the new lawe, it being most manifest that all the texts of Scripture, which M. Andrewes or other of our aduersaries doe, or can alleage for the spirituall Supremacy of temporall Kinges out of the new Testament, do ordeyne obedience to the Pagan Princes that the raigned, no lesse then to others, which therfore cannot be vnderstood to concerne spirituall matters, and much lesse to make them heades of the Church, except M. Andrewes will be so absurd to say, that the most wicked Emperours, Tyberius, Caius, Claudius, and Nero were heades or supreme Gouernours of the Church, and that they could commaund and ought to be obeyed in spirituall and Ecclesiasticall affayres.
            45. Now then seeing M. Andrewes neither bringeth, nor is able to bring, any other proofes then these out of the old or new Testament for the Ecclesiasticall Supremacy of Kinges, I may well conclude, that as he hath great reason to hould it for no matter of faith, and therfore not to admit it into his Creed (as being neither expressely taught in Scripture, nor necessarily deduced from it) so I may with no lesse reason aduise him also to put it out of his Pater noster (if it be gotten so farre into his bookes) seeing it is not so much as probably gathered out of Scripture;The Ecclesiasticall supremacy of temporall Princes excluded by a rule of M. Andrewes
                     •
                  
                in which respect also I am to put him in mind of a rule giuen by himselfe in another question, to witt, that nothing is to be admitted and practised in the Church, whereof some precept is not to be shewed in holy Scriptures, for so doth he tell vs concerning prayer to Saints, saying, non audemus vota nostra &amp;c. We dare not direct our prayers to Saints, because we haue no precept thereof, hauing a precept in expresse wordes.

               Quod tibi praecepero hoc tantum facies, Thou shalt only do this which I shall command thee,

wherevpon we dare only doe that whereof we haue a precept.
            
            46. Thus sayth he, and therefore according to this his owne rule, I must now exact of him to shew vs some precept whereby the Kinges spirituall Supremacie is cōmaunded or ordeyned in Scripture, but this he acknowledgeth sufficiently he cannot do, seing he teacheth that we are not boūd to belieue it as an article of faith but to be perswaded only that it is a truth, which he neither could, nor as I thinke, would say if he could shew any precept or commaundement of it in Scripture. And this being so, how then dare he and his fellowes admit it into their Church, seeing he sayth, Id tantùm audemus facere &amp;
                     •
                   we dare only doe that whereof we haue a precept? And how can he approue that men should be compelled to sweare it as an vndoubted truth, when neuertheles it is no matter of faith (by his owne confession) nor hath any ground in Scripture, (as I haue shewed) and much lesse is ordeyned and commaunded in Scripture, and therefore, according to his owne rule, not to be admitted &amp; practised in the Church, and consequently not to be ratified by a solemne Oath for an infallible verity, as if it were one of the most important Articles of our Creed.
            47. But yet let vs examine the matter a litle further &amp; sound the depth of M. Andrewes his doctrine cō
               cerning the Kings Ecclesiasticall Supremacy, I doubt not but we shall find that he is neither good English Protestant, nor yet a good subiect; for if it fall out that his doctrine agreeeth not with the moderne Lawes and Statuts of the Realme, he is neither of both, seing that according to the doctrine of English Protestants, none can be accounted to be of their congregation, neither yet a good subiect who belieueth not the Kings Supremacy

And not only Christian Kings haue this power, but also any Pagan Prince hath, and may exercise the

same, as the Kings of Chinae and Persia (the one a Pagā
                and the other a Mahumetan) doe at this day.

               and Realmes of England, and Ireland, and so iustly acknowledged by the Clergy of the said Realmes. Whereby it appeareth euidently that the King according to these Lawes and statutes (yea and by the confession and acknowledgement of all the English Clergy) not only hath spirituall authority, power, and iurisdiction, but also is the very fountaine and spring, from whence it floweth to all Bishops and Clergy in his dominions
                  •
                Whereupon it followeth that if there be any spirituall iurisdiction and power in the Church
                  •
                and Clergy of England, the same is much more in the King then in them, seeing it is deduced and deriued from him, to the Church, as from the head to the body.
            54. Now then this being most euident, how doth M. Andrewes his doctrine agree with this? seeing he teacheth that the King is no otherwise ouer the Church, (that is to say) he hath no power or authority ouer it, but as a foster-father and a tutor

                  dat that he may nourish and defend it, which as I haue said,M. Andrewes depriueth the Kings Maiesty of all the spirituall authority that the Parliaments haue giuen him. all Catholike Princes do, and Pagan Princes may do without any spirituall power at all. So that you see M. Andrewes depriueth his Maiesty of all the spirituall authority and iurisdiction, which the Parliament hath giuen him. And the like he doth also in other places, where he ouerthroweth the Kings Ecclesiasticall Supremacy in other manner; for wheras the Cardinall obiecteth Caluins doctrine, that no man ought to be called Head of the Church, M. Andrews saith that Caluin indeed did not like it quo s
                     •
                  nsu Papa &amp;c. in the sense that the Pope is called the Ministeriall head,

but I know saith he, it would not dislike Caluin in the sense that Saul was head of the Tribes of Israel, and so also the head of the Tribe of Leui: so he. Giuing to vnderstand that Kings are heades of the Church, in no other sense then as Saul was head of the Tribe of Leui.
            
            55. Whereupon i
                  •
                followeth, that Kings are neither heads of the Church, nor yet haue any authoritie at all ouer it; for that Saul had none ouer the tribe of Leui, which (as I haue shewed in the

                  Numer. 8. Scripture) to Aaron and his children, so as the temporall Magistrate had nothing to doe with them. And although it should be graunted that Saul was head of the Tribe of Leui, as well as of the rest, it would not follow, that he was their spirituall head, it being manifest, that all the spirituall authority and iurisdiction in the lawe of Moyses resyded in the Preists, and especially in the high Priest, as I haue proued at large in my 
                  Suppl. c. 1. from nu. 10. to 53. supplement, where I haue also shewed 
                  Ibid. nu. 51.52. that King Saul had no lawfull power and authority either spirituall or temporall ouer the person of the high Priest, as it appeared, in that his owne naturall subiects (who knew the law of God) refused to obey him when he commaunded them to kill Achimelech the high Priest,K. Saul had no authority ouer the hygh Priest. S. Aug. in psal. 51. which therefore he caused to be done by Doeg the Idumean, who being a stranger, and not knowing the law of God, or contemning it (and representing, as S. Augustine testifieth,

the Earthly Kingdome and societie of wicked men) executed his tyranicall and sacrilegious commaundement.
            56. Therefore whereas M. Andrewes signifieth that our Kings are Heades of the Church of God in England, as Saul was head of the tribe of Leui, he alloweth them no authority at all ouer the Church, neither spirituall nor temporall; for that, as I haue sayd, the Leuiticall tribe was wholy exempt from the temporall state, and subiect only to the high Preist: and albeit Saul was truly head of all the other tribes, yet he was only their temporall head, and had no other but temporall power ouer them. And therefore M. Andrewes doth also by this example depriue his Maiestie (if not of all authority) at least of all the spirituall power and iurisdiction which our Parliaments haue graunted him.
            57. To this may be added also his doctrine in his Tortura Torti,
               
                  Andr. Tort. Torti. p. 151. where he saith, Nos Principi censurae potestatem non facimus

                  Supra nu. 53. declared before out of the Statuts; neither could the Prince giue it to any other, if he had it not truly and properly in himselfe, in whose person the same must needes principally reside, seeing that by the expresse words of the Statute, it is vnited and annexed to the Imperiall Crowne of England,
               The King could not giue the power of censure to other if he had it not in himfelse. for what right, Power, of Iurisdiction soeuer is in the Crowne, the same must needes be vnderstood to be principally and most properly in the Prince.
            58. Whereby it is manifest that the Kinges of England may according to this Statute, not only giue all manner of Iurisdiction (wherein all kind of Censures are included) but also exercise the same themselues if it please them, as in lyke case they might (yf they thought it conuenient) do and exercise the acts of all the ciuill offices in the common wealth, as well as the officers themselues,

               M. Andrews neyther good Subiect nor. good English Protestant. and therefore M. Andrewes denying the Power of Censures to the King, denyeth him the Royall prerogatiue, and supreme spirituall authority wherewith our Parliaments haue indued him: whereupon it followeth directly that he is neither good subiect nor good English Protestant. For seeing he abridgeth his Maiesties authority, denying his Ecclesiasticall Supremacy in the sense and māner that our late Parliaments haue ordayned the same, he cānot be accounted a good subiect.
            
            
               59. And if he say that by this argument, I confesse that we our selues are no good Subiects, because we deny the Kings Ecclesiasticall Supremacy,A great difference to be noted betwixt M. Andrews his deniall of the Kings supremacy and ours. he is to vnderstand, that the case betwixt him and vs, is farre different; for, we deny it only of meere conscience, because we hold our selues bound to belieue, as a matter of faith, that S. Peter and his successors are supreme heades of the Church (being a doctrine deduced from our Sauiours expresse words and commission giuen to S. Peter, acknowledged by the vniforme consent of the ancient Fathers, and confirmed by the continuall practise of the Church, euen from S. Peters time to these our daies, as I haue proued sufficiently throughout this Treatise,) in which respect we haue great reason to say with the Apostles,
               
                  Act. 5. 
               opertet magis obedire Deo, quàm hominibus, and to giue our liues, rather then to offend God, and our consciences, in the deniall of such an important article of our faith, to the euerlasting damnation of our soules.M. Andrews hath no such obligation to deny the Kings supremacy, as we haue. But M. Andrews holding the Kings Supremacy to be no article of faith, or beliefe, but only a matter of perswasion, (which passeth not the boundes of probability) hath no such cause and obligation to deny it, as we haue, and yet neuerthelesse (vnder the colour and pretence to defend it) he doth so extenuate and abase it, that he maketh it nothing, but an externall, humaine and meere temporall authority, and consequently as any Pagan Prince may exercise, as well as a Christan.M. Andrews lyke to a treacherous frend or a preuaricating aduocate.
            
            60. And therefore he dealeth therin no otherwise then one who being chosen by his friend to maintaine his quarrell, draweth his sword with pretence to defend him, and giueth him a deadly wound behind his backe: or like to some preuaricating Aduocate, who

being hyred to defend a cause, pleadeth for the aduerse party: for so doth he, who being specially chosen by his Maiesty, to defend and maintaine his Ecclesiasticall Supremacy, doth couertly, and vnderhand betray him,M. Andrews doth vnderhand betray the Kings cause. depriuing him of all the spirituall power that the Parliament hath giuen him, and leauing him only the bare title without the effect; which kind of dealing, if it were but amongst frendes and equals, were no lesse then treacherous and perfidious, and therefore what it is in a subiect towardes his Prince, especially in a man so much honored &amp; aduanced by his Maiesty, as M. Andrewes hath bin, I leaue it to the iudgement of any indifferent man, but sure I am it cānot be counted the part of a good subiect.
            61. Neither can he be thought to be a good Enlish Protestant, for who knoweth not that the English Protestant differeth from all other Protestants of other Nations, especially in holding and maintayning the Ecclesiasticall and spirituall Supremacy, that our Parliament first gaue to King Henry the 8. which you see M. Andrews doth not,Why M. Andrewes is no good English Protestant.
                who (as I haue said) hath so pared, shaued, and abridged it, that he hath made it nothing in effect, at least much lesse, and of farre other conditiō then the Parliament ordayned it. Wherby he is not only subiect to the penalties of the Parliamentall statutes,See cōstitut. and Canons Ecclesiasticall, printed. by Rob. Barker, Anno. 1604. Can. 2. as a Traytor, but also incurreth the censure of excommunication imposed by a late Synodicall constitution of the Byshops and Clergy of the Prouince of Canterbury, vpon such, as impeach in any part, (saith the Canon) his Maiesties Regall supremacy in Ecclesiasticall causes, restored to the Crowne by the Lawes of this Realme therin established, and so strickt is the Canon against such persōs, that it ordayneth further, that

they being excommunicated ipso facto, shall not be restored, but only by the Archbyshop, after their repentance, and publike reuocation of their wicked errour. So as this Canon, and all the rest made in that Conuocation, being authorized by his Maiesty, and published by his Regall authority, vnder the great Seale of England, I remit to the iudgment of all true English Protestantes, whether M. Andrews hauing incurred the censure of this Canon (and being consequently cut off from the vnion of their Congregation) can be a member of their body, or any other to them, then an Ethnick, or a Publican, vntill he haue publikly reuoked his errour, and be absolued, and restored by the Archbishop.
            62. And no maruell, seeing that he is (as it seemeth) so farre from being an English Protestāt (whatsoeuer he hath ben hertofore) that he is now turned flat Puritan in this point,M. Andrewes seemeth to be turned Puritan, in the point of the K. Supremacy. allowing the King no more power ouer the Church then to mayntayne, and defend it, which is the very doctrine of the Puritans, who therfore do willingly sweare obedience to their Princes for the defence, and conseruation of the Church, as it appeareth by the Oath of the Puritans in Scotlād, who sweare thus: Quoniam percepimus Ecclesiae, &amp; religionis nostrae tranquillitatem &amp;c. Forasmuch as we perceiue that the tranquillity,The Oath of the Puritans of Scotland, set forth in the yeare 1584. &amp; stability of our Church, and religion doth depend on the health, and good gouernment of his Maiesty, as of the comfortable instrument of gods mercy, granted the Realm for the conseruation of the Church, and the administration of iustice amongst vs; we do couenant, and promise with our hart, vnder the same Oath, subscription, and penalties, to defend his person, authority,

and dignity, with our goods, bodies, and liues, for the defence of the Ghospell of Christ, and the liberty of our Countrey.
            63. Thus sweare they, and no more teacheth M. Andrewes in substance, granting no other power to Kings ouer the Church, then they do, to wit, that Kings are but as Foster-fathers, &amp; defēders of it. Wherin neuerthelesse this difference may be noted betwixt the Puritans and him,What difference may be noted betwixt M. Andrews and the Puritans.
                that they do belieue it as a matter of faith (no lesse then we) wheras M. Andrewes is only perswaded that it is true, seing that he placeth therin the Kings Ecclesiasticall Supremacy, which he holdeth to be no matter of fayth, and therfore if the said Supremacy consist only in the defence of the Church, (as it doth according to his doctrine) then both we, and the Puritans are better subiects then he,Both Catholikes &amp; Puritans are better Subiects then M. Andrews.
                because we belieue the same to be a matter of faith, and consequently do think our selues bound in conscience to maintaine it, though it be with los
                  •
               e of our liues, wheras he taking it to be but only a matter of perswasion, will not, by all liklyhood, loose six pence to defend it.
            64. Furthermore to shew that he doth truly Puritanize in the point of the Supremacy, it is to be vnderstood, that whereas the 
                  Card. Apol. ca. 1. pag. 10 Cardinall obiecteth out of the Basilicon Doron of his Maiesty, that the Puritans do not admit the Kings Ecclesiasticall primacy, because they introduce a certaine parity into the Church, he 
                  Andr. c. 1. p. 30. §. Postremo.
                answereth that albeit they maintayne a parity a mongst themselues (reiecting the distinction of degrees of Byshops aboue Ministers or of one Minister, aboue another) yet they doe not hold, that there is any parity betwixt the King, and them, but do admit and acknowledg his Supremacy ouer them; thus teacheth M.

Andrews, and addeth presently after in the 
                  Ibid §. Nec habet. next paragraph, that wheresoeuer the Religion is reformed, the supreme temporall Magistrats haue this Power, euen this selfe same, which the King hath. So he, whereupon two things may be euidently gathered. The one, that the Puritans haue the same doctrine concerning the Ecclesiasticall primacy of temporall Princes, that is taught in all the reformed Churches, which indeed they also affirme of themselues. The other is, that the King hath no other Ecclesiasticall power but the self same that the Puritans, and all the reformed Churches doe graunt to their temporall Magistrate.
            65. But what the Puritans teach concerning this point,
                  See c. 6. n. 78.79. you heard in the last Chapter by the testimony of M. Rogers, approued, and warranted by all the Cleargy of England, to wit, that Princes must be seruants to the Church,
               The Puritans doctrine cō
                  cerning the Kings subiectiō to their Presbytery. 
               subiect to the Church, submit their Scepters to the Church, and throw downe their Crownes before the Church, and that (as Beza testifieth) they cannot be exempted from this diuine domination of the presbitery; whereupon I gather two things, the one, that the Supremacy which (as M. Andrews saith) the Puritans do acknowledg in the King, is to be vnderstood only in temporall matters, wherein they doe indeed admit him to be theyr supreme head, and Gouernour, though (as you see in M. Rogers) they hold him in spirituall matters to be wholly subiect to the Presbitery. The other is, that all the reformed Churches are also of the same mynd, seeing that they professe the same doctrine concerning the Kings Ecclesiasticall supremacy, that the Puritans doe, as M. Andrews himselfe confesseth
                  •
                whereupon it also followeth that the Kings Maiestie hath no spirituall power, or authority at all

ouer the English Church, seeing that (by M. Andrewes his owne confessiō) he hath no other power but that which the Puritans and the reformed Churches doe admit in their temporall Princes.
            66. Besides that, albeit we should grant, that the Puritans and reformed Churches do allow the tē
               porall Magistrat to haue some power, and authority in Ecclesiasticall matters, yet it is euident that they do not allow them that spirituall Iurisdiction and authority,
               The pretended reformed churches do not allow in tē
                  porall Princes any such spirituall authority as our Parlamēts haue grā
                  ted to our Kings. which our Parliaments haue granted to our Kinges, to wit, that all the spirituall power of the Church shall reside principally in them, and is to be deduced from them to the Church, as from the head to the body, &amp; that they may giue Dispensations, Licences, and Faculties in matters of Conscience, make Ecclesiasticall Lawes, giue Commissions to consecrate Bishops, to excōmunicat, interdict, suspend, cēsure, to visit &amp; correct all Ecclesiasticall Persons, and to reforme all heresyes, and abuses: this I say being a meere spirituall power, and exercised by our Kings in England (according to the grant of the Parliament) is not admitted, and much lesse practized in any of the reformed Churches,
                  M. Andrews professing the doctrine of the Puritans and reformed Churches concerning the Kings supremacy denieth it to be spirituall. as all those know, who know any thing of their doctrine and practise.
            67. Therfore wheras M. Andrews saith, that aswell the reformed Churches as the Puritans, do grant the self same authority to the temporall Prince, which our King hath, and exerciseth in England: he sheweth euidently that in his opinion his Maiesty hath no such spirituall iurisdiction, and authority as hath bin granted him by our Parliament, for that (as I haue said) the Puritans &amp; reformed Churches (whose doctrine in this point he approueth) do not acknowledg any such

spirituall authority in temporall Princes, but only a temporall power, and obligation to mayntayne, and defend the Church, so farre forth as the same hath need of externall, and humane helpe, assistance, or defēce, which is indeed the self same, &amp; all that M. Andrewes (as you haue heard 
                  supr
                        •
                      nu. 47.before) alloweth to the Kings Maiesty, when he saith, that he is no otherwise ouer the Church, but as a foster-father &amp; a tutor to nourish and defend it, and that the question of the Kings Ecclesiasticall supremacy concerneth 
               
                  nu. 37. 
               only the externall gouernment of the Church,
               
                  M. Andrews no English Protestant but a flat Puritan.
                
               so farre forth as it requireth, and admitteth humane help and authority. So that you see M. Andrews is not in this point an English Protestant, but rather a flat Puritan.
            
            68. And if this be now the common opinion of the Protestants in England (as M. Andrewes would haue vs to suppose) we may more truly say of them,The learned English Protestāts ashamed o

            69. Wherein two things are to be noted, the one that he doth ridiculously make the Pagan Emperours the chief members, that is to say, the heads, or gouernours of the Church, who neuertheles being Idolatours, could not be so much as the meanest members thereof. The other, that he seemeth to make the Kings Maiesty no other wise chief gouernour in the Church, then they were, albeit I think he will not be so absurd, as to acknowledge any spirituall authority in thē,
                  M. Barl. seemeth to make the King head of the Church no otherwyse thē as the Pagan Emperours were. seing they were altogeather vncapable therof, being as I haue sayd, Idolatours, enemies, and violent persecutors of the Church, and faith of Christ. So as herby it appeareth that he also concurreth with M. Andrews to depriue his Maiesty of all the spirituall iurisdiction, and authority which the Parliaments haue grā
               ted to our Kings, and that consequently they are both of them in one predicament of disloyalty towards his Maiesty, and defection from the wonted Protestātisme of England, in the point of the Kings Ecclesiasticall Supremacy.
            
            70. Now then to conclude concerning them both, &amp; all the premises, thou hast seene, good Reader, how well these two Prelats of the English Church do simbolize, &amp; agree, not only in seeking to delude their Readers with dyuers lyes, fraudulent shifts, and deuises, but also in betraying their owne cause, and fortifying ours which is so euident in them both, that they may well be accounted the most harmles, or rather the most propitious enemies that euer the Catholikes had, and therfore may in some sort be compared to the Scorpion,

Andrews, like to the Scorpion, and why. yieldeth a sufficient remedy against his owne poison, and so do they; for albeit they are replenished with venom, and malignity, yea and sting somtimes most maliciously, (not with solid arguments, but with spitefull gibes, and contumelious iests) yet their malice doth commonly carry with it the remedy of it selfe, being for the most part so manifest, and accompanyed with such apparant falshood, and euident folly, that no man of learning, and consideration can receiue any harme thereby, but rather great benefit by the discouery of their imbecility, &amp; the weakenes of their cause
                  •
                Seing they cannot otherwyse defend it, then by such contumelious, and malicious proceedings.
            71. Insomuch that the learned strangers, who read M. Andrewes his booke in latin,The opinion of the learned strangers concerning M. Andrewes his bookes against Cardinall Bellarmine.
                and do consider withall the speciall choyce that the English Clergy hath made of him to mayntayne the combat against Cardinall Bellarmine, in the eye, and view of the Christian world, do exceedingly wonder, as well at the penury of learned Deuines in England, as at their want of iudgment in venturing the credit of their cause, vpō so weake a Champion, whose valour consisteth in nothing els, but in certayne Thrasonicall braggs, Satyricall scoffes, and a vayne presumption of his latin stile;M. Andrews gerally disliked for his obscurity
                     •
                  
                which neuertheles seemeth to learned men more fit for a Comicall, or Satyriall Poet, thē for a Doctor of Diuinity; wherein also they obserue such obsurdity
                  •
                that they hold it for no lesse vicious in a Deuine writing of matters in controuersy, then it would be in an Orator or Aduocat pleading a cause, in whome nothing is more requisit, then perspicuity: and therefore Quintilian greatly reprehendeth such as affecting an

extraordinary breuity, necessaria subtrahunt verba &amp;c. do leaue out, saith he, necessary words. And (as if it were sufficient that they know their owne meaning) care not whether others vnderstand them or no. So sayth Quintilian.
            
            72. And truly the same is so well verifyed in M. Andrewes that he may iustly say with the Poet dum breuis esse laboro obscurus fio, whyles I labour to be briefe I become obseure, in so much that he is farre more easy to be confuted,M. Andrewes compared for his obscurity to a fish called a Cuttle. then vnderstood, seeming somtymes rather to propound riddles, then to argue or discourse; which he doth (perhaps) of purpose to the end that being obscure, and ambiguous he may alwayes haue some starting hole, or other, when he is pressed by his aduersary; not vnlike to a fish (called in latin sepia, in English a Cuttle) which when she is in danger to be taken casteth out a kind of black licour lyke inke,
                  Plyn. l. 9. ca. 29. wherwith she obscureth, and troubleth the water in such sort that she cannot be seene, and so the more easily escapeth.
            73. Neuertheles M. Andrews reapeth not the like benefit by his obscurity, being discouered wheresoeuer he lurketh, and taken tardy at euery turne, whereof sufficient experience hath bene seene in these few points of his booke, which I haue had occasion to handle, being only such as are incident to matters treated in my Supplement, besydes dyuers others of the same sort, which I am forced, for lack of time, to omit, wherein I might much more amply haue displayed his insufficiency, falsity, and folly: and therfore I leaue it to thee good Reader, to imagin what a number of absurdityes, lyes, frauds, and corruptions his whole worke would affoard, if it were well examined.
            
               74 But now to end in no lesse charitable manner with him,A good aduise for a frendly farewell to M. Andrews. then I did with M. Barlow, I will only wish him well to consider those few aduyses which I gaue to M. Barlow in the 8. last paragraphs of my

            AN APPENDIX TOVCHING A Register alleadged by M. Francis Mason, to proue THAT The first Protestant Byshops, in the reigne of Queene Elizabeth, had a lawfull Consecration.
            
               THIS Adioynder being printed, and some copyes ready to be diuulged, it was my chance to vnderstand by a Letter written to a frend of myne, that one M. Mason hath lately published a Book,Touching the cause and subiect of this Appendix. wherin he pretēdeth to answere the Preface to Fa. Persons his Discussion, especially concerning one point treated therin, to wit, the Consecration of the first Protestant Bishops in the raigne of Queene Elizabeth: &amp; further, that he indeauoureth to proue their consecration by a Register, testifying that

4. Bishops consecrated M. Parker, the first Archbishop of Canterbury in the said Queenes dayes; wherupon, if it be true, it must needes follow that all other Bishops consecrated after him, and his successors, euen vntill this day, haue some more shew of lawfull consecration, and succession, then the Catholickes haue hitherto known or imagined.
            2. And therfore for as much, as not only the Authour of the Preface to Fa. Persons his Discussion, but also my selfe in my Supplement,

                     d. ca. 10. nu. 35. and in this Adioynder haue constantly denyed, that they had any such consecration, I thought good to stay the publication of this Adioynder, vntill I had added therto this briefe Appendix concerning M. Masons pretended Register, left otherwise M. Barlow, and M. Andrewes may hold me to be sufficiently answered by M. Mason, and remit me to his Register for that point.

                  rch of England, M. Iewell, and M. Horne, whome they pressed mightily with the defect of due vocation, and consecration, vrging them to proue the same, and to shew how, and by whome they were made Priests, and Bishops.
            3. To which purpose M. D. Harding in his confutation

of the Apology,
               
                  D. Hard. confut. of the Apolog. par. 2. fol. 59. printed an. Dom. 1565. speaking to M. Iewell the pretended Bishop of Salisbury, and hauing already proued, that he had no succession in his Episcopall function from the Apostles, sayth thus: Therefore to goe from your succession, to your vocation, how say you Syr? You beare your selfe,
               
                  D. Hardings chaleng to M. Iewell cōcerning the consecration of the first Protestant Bishops. 
               as though you were a Bishop of Salisbury; but how can you proue your vocation? By what authority vsurp you the administration of doctrine, and Sacraments? What can you alledg for the right, &amp; proof of your ministry? Who hath called you? Who hath layd hands on you? By what example hath he done it? how, and by whome are you consecrated? Who hath sent you &amp;c. So he.
            4. In lyke manner M. Doctor Stapleton in his answere to M. Iewells booke intituled,
                  D. Staplet. return of vntru. fol. 130. lin. 26. 
               A reply &amp;c. saith thus: How chanced then M. Iewell, that you and your fellowes bearing your selues for Bishops, haue not so much as this congruity,
               
                  D. Stapletons chalenge to M. Iewell, and M. Horne touching their cōsecration. 
               and consent, I will not say of the Pope, but of any Christian Bishop at all throughout all Christendome, neyther are lyked, and allowed of any one of them all, but haue taken vpon you that office without any imposition of hands, without all Ecclesiasticall authority, without all order of Canons and right? I aske not who gaue you Bishoprikes, but who made you Bishops &amp;c. So he. Who also in his Counterblast against M. Horne the pretended Bishop of Winchester, saith to him thus: It is not the Princes only pleasure that maketh a Bishop,
               
                  Idem counterblast fol. 301. 
               but there must be both free election, without eyther forcing the Clergy to a choyse, or forcing the chosen to filthy brybery, and also there must follow a due consecration, which you, and all your fellowes doe lack, and therefore you are indeed (by the way to conclude it) no true Byshops,
               
                  An. 1. Elizab. ca. 1. 
               neyther by the law of the Church, neyther yet by the lawes of the Realme, for want of due consecration, expressely required by an act of

Parliamēt renewed in this Queens dayes in suffragā Bishops, much more in you. Thus sayth M. Stapleton, which I haue layd downe at large in his owne words, togeather with the lyke out of D. Harding before, to the end it may appeare how earnestly they pressed M. Iewell, &amp; M. Horne (who were two of the first pretended Byshops in Queene Elizabeths tyme) to shew from whom, and by whom, they had their vocation, and consecration.
            5. And what,M. Horne answered nothing cōcerning his consecration. trow you, was answered therto? was there any Bishop named who had consecrated them? were there any witnesses alledged of their consecration? was M. Masons register, or any other authenticall proof therof produced, eyther by M. Iewell, or M. Horne?
                  Iewell defence of the Apology pag. 130. No truly; for as for M. Horne he neuer replyed, or any man for him, for ought I euer heard. And M. Iewell though he tooke vpon him to answere it, yet did it so weakely, coldly, and ambiguously, that he sufficiently fortified and iustified his aduersaries obiection.
            6. For whereas D. Harding had demanded of him how he could proue that he was a Bishop
                  •
                who had called him, who had layd hands on him, and who had consecrated him; he answered, that he was a Bishop by the free, and accustomed Canonicall election of the whole Chapter of Salisbury,
               M. Iewels ambiguous and weak answere touching his lawfull consecration. but to the question how he was consecrated, or by whome, he answereth no otherwyse, then thus, Our Bishops are made, saith he, in forme and order, as they haue byn euer, by free election of the Chapter, by consecration of the Archbishop, and 3. other Bishops, wherein you see, he saith not, I was made, or wee were made, by the consecration of the

               Archbishop, and 3. other Bishops (as he should haue said, to answere directly to the question) but our Bishops are made &amp;c. declaring directly, and truly nothing els, but the custome that then was receiued, and vsed amongst them, for the making of Bishops, which was not denyed, or doubted of by D
                     •
                   Harding, neyther was it any thing at all to the purpose, because the same concerned not the institution, and consecration of M. Iewell himselfe, or the first pretended Bishops, and much lesse did it concerne the ordination, and consecration of their Archbishop, which as M. Iewell could not but know, most imported to be declared.
            7. For albeit it should be true, that the Arch-Bishop, and 3. others consecrated M. Iewell himselfe, and the rest,How much it imported M. Iewell to haue proued the consecration of their Archbishop. yet if the sayd Archbishop, and those three others, had themselues no consecration, neyther they, nor any other ordayned by them were Bishops; and therefore this was the difficulty which M. Iewell should principally haue cleared, as M. Doctor Harding afterwards in his detection told him roundly, saying thus: And how I pray you was your Archbishop himselfe consecrated? what 3. Bishops in the realme were there to lay hands vpon him? You haue now vttered a worse case for your selues,
               
                  Doct. Har. detect. fol. 234. p. 2. 
               then was by me before named, for your Metropolitan, who should giue authority to all your consecrations, himselfe had no lawfull consecration. Yf you had byn consecrated after the forme, and order which hath euer byn vsed, yee might haue had Bishops out of France to haue consecrated you, in case there had lacked in England. But now there were ancient Bishops ynough in England, who eyther were not required, or refused

to consecrate you, which is an euident signe that you sought not such a consecration, as had byn euer vsed, but such a one, whereof all the former Bishops were ashamed. Thus saith D. Harding.
            
            8. Now then, good Reader, I wish heere certaine thinges to be considered, first, that this controuersy betwixt D. Harding, and M. Iewell, was thus debated, as you haue heard, in the very beginning of the Queenes reygne, not past 5. or 6. yeares after the institution of those first pretended Bishops, as it may appeare by Doctor Hardings confutation of the Apology, printed in the yeare of our Lord 1565. and by Doctor Stapletons Returne of vntruths, printed the yeare following.
            9. Secondly I wish it well to be weyghed, whether it be probable, that these two learned men (Doctor Harding, and Doctor Stapleton) would haue obiected to M. Iewell, and M. Horne, this defect of their consecration in printed bookes, so confidently, and resolutely, as they did, if they had not bin well assured of it, especially thē, whē their consecration would haue byn so fresh in memory (if they had byn consecrated at all) that the denyers of it might haue byn conuinced by multitudes of witnesses to their perpetuall shame.
            10. Thirdly,Touching M. Iewels irresolute ambiguous &amp; indirect answere. let it be considered, whether M. Iewell being expresly demanded, and vrged to shew who consecrated him and his fellowes, would haue answered so irresolutly, ambiguously, and indirectly as he did, if he could haue proued theyr consecration eyther by witnesses, or by Registers, or any other authenticall proofe; to which purpose it is also to be

noted, that he made no doubt at all, to speake resolutly, and clearely of his election, because it was true, and euident, that he was chosen by the Chapter of Salisbury,
               How much it imported the first Protestant Bishops to haue had a publick &amp; most solemne Consecration. &amp; therfore for that point he boldly appealed to D. Hardings owne knowledg. And would he not trow you, haue spoken as resolutly &amp; clearely of his consecration, if he could haue produced the lyke proof therof, or any other probability at all? especially seeing that it was the poynt which was thē chiefly in questiō? nay would not he haue cried shame on D. Harding for denying, or calling in questiō a matter that must needs haue bin most notorious at the sāe time if there had bin any such thing at all? For besids that the cōsecratiō of Bishops is allwayes wōt to be don in publik, who knoweth not that it greatly imported those new pretēded Bishops, for the credit of their cause, &amp; honour of all theyr future Clergy, to haue bene consecrated with all the publicity, and solemnity in the world, if they could haue had any shew of lawfull consecration, espicially by 4. Bishops, as M. Masons register reporteth?How improbably M. Mason affirmeth out of his Registers that 4. Bishops consecrated M. Parker the first Archbishop.
            
            11. Neither can it be imagned that M. D. Harding would haue bene so inconsiderate as to demand of M. Iewell expresly, what three Byshops in the Realme were to lay hands vpon him (meaning Protestant Bishops) if there had bene 4. it being a thing whereof neither he, nor any man els could haue bene ignorant at that tyme, if there had bene so many, the persons themselues being then all alyue by all lyklyhood when D. Harding wrote this, which was within 6. or 7. yeares after this pretended consecration; at least if any of them should haue bene dead, the memory

of them would haue bene so fresh, that M. Iewell might, and no doubt would, not only haue named them,How litle credit M. Masons newfound Register deserueth. but also haue appealed to the knowledge, and testimony of hundreths of witnesses, who must needs haue knowne them, and remembred, this pretended Consecration; which was as I haue sayd so constantly denyed by Catholikes at the same tyme, that it highly imported M. Iewell, and his fellowes to lay downe their best, and most substantiall, and authenticall proofes of it, for the defence of theyr owne honour and credit of theyr whole Clergy and Cause.
            12. This then being so, I report me to the iudgment of any indifferent man, what credit M. Masons new found register deserueth, being produced now after fifty and odd yeares to testify this consecration,
                  Andr. Resp. ad Apol. p. 41. §. proximi.
                whereof not so much as any one witnes was named, nor any register pretended by those whom it most imported to proue it, within 5. or 6. yeares after it was supposed to be done.

            13. And therefore seeing it pleaseth M. Andrewes to say of S. Ephraems Tomes translated by Vossius, that they are Crypticae fidei,
               With how great reason exception is to be takē to M. Masōs Register vntill he shew it to Catholiks, who may giue testimony of it. because they were found in Crypta ferrata, and M. Barlow in his pleasant humour iesteth at an Authour alledged by Cardinall Baroniꝰ out of a manuscript, calling him a Corner-creeping relatour, and a Vatican deske-creeper; as also others of our aduersaries are wont to reiect what soeuer we alledge out of the manuscripts of the Vatican, &amp; other Libraries, vpon no better ground, but because they will needes haue an vncharitable, or rather malicious conceipt, and imagination of fraudulent dealing in vs; I hope it will not seeme to any reasonable man,

vnreasonable, or strange, that vpon so good ground, and reason, as I haue heere declared, I take a mayne exception to this Register of M. Masons, vntill he, or some of his fellowes do shew the same to some learned, discreet, and sincere Catholikes, who vpon the view, and due consideration thereof, may giue iudgement, and testimonie of the truth, and validity of it.
            
               What is to be considered in M. Masōs Register to make it autēticall.14. For I doubt not but that it will easily appeare, whether it be an olde, and authenticall Register, as well by the antiquity of the booke, and letter, and the formalities requisite thereto, as also by the matters antecedent, and consequent to this pretended Consecration. For as there were many things, no doubt, done before, worth the Registring, so also diuers thinges haue passed since in the space of 55. yeares, which wilbe found in their due order &amp; place, whereby the validity of the pretended Register may be the more easily discerned; therefore I say, let it be shewed, and in recompence thereof I promise as well in my owne behalfe, as for other Catholikes heere in Rome, that if any English Protestant come hither, (as many do dayly) and shall desire to see any manuscript in Rome alledged by any Catholike authour, we will procure him ample satisfaction therein, and doe him what other seruice we may,An offer to shew any manuscript in Rome to English Protestāts. as we are wont to doe to all our louing countrymen that come into these parts; which many Noblemen, and Gentlemen of great reputation, and some of the greatest, (who haue receiued courtesy, and seruice at our hands) may, and no doubt will testify. And thus much I haue thought good to say to M. Masons Register in generall,

leauing the particuler examination, and answere thereof to such Catholikes as shall haue the sight of it, and occasion withall to treate of the matter which it handleth, as I doubt not, but some will haue, ere it be long.
