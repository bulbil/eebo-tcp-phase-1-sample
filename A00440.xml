            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).

            TO THE RIGHTE HONORABLE, THE GODLY, WISE AND VERTVOVS LADIE ELIZABETH, COVNTESSE OF LYNCOLNE, vvife to the right noble Edvvarde Earle of Lyncolne, Lorde highe Admirall of England one of the Queenes Maieſties priuie counſail and Knight of the moſt honorable order of the Garter: MEREDITH HANMER vviſheth encreaſe of honor, continewance of Godly zeale, perfection of wiſedome, and health in Chriſt Ieſus.
            
               THE holy Apoſtle and Euangeliſt, Sainct Iohn, one that leaned on our Sauiours breaſte (right honorable Ladie) when he ſawe a noble woman whome he tearmeth a Lady, walking in the way of trueth, and willingly embracing the gladſome tidmges of the Goſpell, reioyced exceedingly and wrote vnto her an Epiſtle wherein he commendeth her vertues, exhorting her to obſerue the olde commaundement of louing one an other, and to take heede of deceauers: though in all poynctes I am founde farre inferior, nay in nothing comparable at all vnto the bleſſed Apoſtle, yet your honors vertues doe counteruaile, or rather ſurpaſſe the other Ladies Godlineſſe, ſeeinge the ſeede of Chriſtianity was in her but newely ſowen, and true zeale of religion firmely rooted theſe many yeares in your Ladiſhips mind. Notwithſtanding my inferior condition, be it lawfull (though not of worthineſſe, at leaſt wiſe of fauour) for me to imitate the bleſſed Apoſtle, &amp; to wryte vnto your honor, not any exhortation of myne owne (whiche peraduenture woulde be very ſimple) but the exhortation of the Apoſtles and Diſciples of our Sauiour, the martyrdomes of Saynctes and ſuch as ſerued God in trueth and vpright conuerſation, the inuincible courage and conſtancie of zealous Chriſtians, the Godly ſayinges and ſentences of true profeſſors, the wiſe and politicke gouernemente of common weales by Catholicke Emperours and Chriſtian princes, the carefull ouerſight of the flocke of Chriſt by reuerend Biſhops and learned Prelats, the confutation and ouerthrowe of heretickes with the confirmation of the trueth 
                  •
               y holy councells and ſacred aſſemblies, and to ſay the wholl in one worde, as the principall drifte of myne Epiſtle, to preſente vnto your Ladiſhip theſe auncient Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtoriographers, to wit, Euſebius, Socrates, Euagrius, &amp; Dorotheus. Whoſe hiſtories are ſo repleniſhed with ſuch godly doctrine, that I may very well ſay of their

all, as a learned wryter reporteth of Euſebius, that they are able to perſwade any man be his mind neuer ſo farre alienated from the trueth, to become a zealous Chriſtian. Wherefore my good Lady ſeeing that as Plato ſayth running witts are delighted with poetrie, as Ariſtotle wryteth, effeminate perſons are rauiſhed with muſicke, and as Socrates telleth vs hiſtories agree beſte with ſtaide heades: I preſent vnto your honor theſe hiſtories agreeing very well with your diſpoſition, and beinge the frutes of my trauell and ſtudie. Ruffinus ſayth, that he wrote his hiſtorie to delight the reader, to occupie the time, and to remoue the remembrance of the calamities (meaning the perſecution) which then lately had happened. As for Chriſtian pleaſure and Godly delightes, what can be more pleaſaunt then the reading of the Eccleſiaſticall hiſtories? toutching the time, I knowe it full well you ſpende it as it beſeemeth your calling, to ſpeake of calamitie (vnleſſe we beholde the miſerie and lamentable eſtate of other Realmes and dominions) preſentlye there is geuen no ſuche occaſion, for it can not be remembred that the ſubiectes within this realme of Englande had the Goſpell ſo freely preached, Clerkes ſo profoundely learned, Nobility ſo wiſe and politicke, all ſucceſſes ſo proſperous, as in this happie raygne of our moſt vertuous &amp; noble Princeſſe Queene Elizabeth, and therefore are we greatly bounde to praiſe God for it. Yet if ye call to memorie the corruption of late dayes, the blindnes of ſuch as woulde be called Gods people, the lamentable perſecution of the Engliſh Church, then may ye reade them after calamitie. But notwithſtandinge the premiſes it is not my drifte to ſalue ſuch ſores, neither to prouide medicens for ſuch Maladies. God of his prouidence hath continewally bene ſo carefull ouer his Church that his ſeruants were neuer left deſolate. Though Elias complayned that he was left alone, yet were there thouſandes vvhich bovved not their knees to Baal. S. Paul telleth vs there is of Iſrael a remnant left. Our Sauiour ſpeaking of his Church though it be not of the greateſt multitudes yet is it accordinge vnto his Epitheton a litle flocke. And ſure I am there may be found a righteous Abraham in Chaldaea, a iuſt Lot in Sodome, a godly Daniel in Babylon, a deuout Tobias in Niniue, a paciente Iob in Huſſe, and a zealous Nehemias in Damaſco. There is found wheate among tares, graine in the huſke, corne among chaffe, a kearnel within the shale, marrow within the bone, a pearle within the cockle, and a roſe amonge the thornes. There was a Ionathas in the court of Saul to fauour Dauid, there was an Obadia in the Court of Achab to entertayne the Prophets, there was an Abedmelech in the Court of Sedechias to entreate for Ieremie, and in the Court of Diocletian there were many yonge Gentlemen, namely Petrus, Dorotheus, Gorgonius with many others which embraced the Chriſtians &amp; ſuffred death for the teſtimony of Chriſt, as your honor may reade in theſe Eccleſiaſtical hiſtories, which I haue not therfore commended vnto you for the remembrance of any calamitie at all. But as for the Court of our moſt gracious Queene (a ſight both ioyfull and comfortable) where there reſortes ſo many learned Clerkes, ſo many Godly perſons, ſo many graue Matrons, ſo many vertuous Ladies, ſo many honorable perſonages, hauinge ſo noble a heade to gouerne them all: There the Chriſtian is no Phoenix, the godly is no blacke ſwanne, for the Goſpell is freely preached, and the profeſſors thereof had in honor and eſtimation. Wherefore in ſo godly a place, to be ſo vertuouſly diſpoſed at vacant times, as to reade theſe auncient hiſtories, wilbe a commendation vnto your honor, an encreaſe of knowledge, a confirmation of the faith, a maintenance of zeale, and a liuely beholdinge of Chriſt Ieſus in his members. Here you may ſee the modeſty and ſhamefaſtnes of Chriſtian maydens, the conſtancie of zealous women, the chaſt mindes of graue Matrons, the godly diſpoſition &amp; wiſe gouernment of Queenes

and Empreſſes. Heere your Ladiſhip ſhall finde zealous prayers, ſorowefull lamentations, godly Epiſtles, Chriſtian decrees &amp; conſtitutions. The father admoniſhing the ſonne, the mother her daughter, the Biſhop his clergie, the Prince his ſubiectes, one Chriſtian confirming an other, and God exhortinge vs all. Many nowe adayes had rather reade the ſtories of Kinge Arthur: The monſtrous fables of Garagantua: the Pallace of pleaſure: the Dial of Princes, where there is much good matter: the Monke of Burie full of good ſtories: Pierce ploweman: the tales of Chaucer where there is excellent wit, great reading and good decorum obſerued, the life of Marcus Aurelius where there are many good Morall precepts: the familiar and golden Epiſtles of Antonie Gvvevarra where there is both golden witt &amp; good penning: the pilgremage of Princes well penned and Clerckly handeled: Reinard the Fox: Beuis of Hampton: the hundred mery tales: skoggan: Fortunatus: with many other infortunate treatiſes and amorous toies wrytten in Engliſhe, Latine, Frenche, Italian, Spaniſhe, but as for bookes of diuinitie, to edifie the ſoule, and inſtructe the inwarde man, it is the leaſt part of their care, nay they will flatly anſwere it belongeth not to theyr calling to occupie their heades with any ſuch kinde of matters, It is to be wiſhed, if not all, at leaſte wiſe that ſome part of the time which is ſpente in readinge of ſuche bookes (althoughe many of them contayne notable matter) were beſtowed in reading of holy Scripture or other ſuch wrytinges as diſpoſe the mind to ſpirituall contemplation. I am fully perſwaded that your Ladiſhip readeth no vayne bookes, I haue ſeene the experience of your vertuous diſpoſition my ſelfe and knowen it nowe of a long time. Wherefore ſeeinge you haue obtained honor with them that be preſēt, fame for the time to come, riches for your poſterity, an eſtate for your ſucceſſors reputation among ſtraungers, credit amongeſt your owne, gladneſſe for your friends and that which paſſeth all, a ſure affiance in the goodneſſe of God: thinke it not amiſſe ſeeing it agreeth with my vocation, as I beganne with the Apoſtle that I nowe ende with exhorting of your Ladiſhip to goe on ſtill in well doinge, and with requeſtinge of your honor louingly to accept the thankefull remembrance of the benefits which I haue receaued at your handes. Let your vertuous diſpoſition and right honorable callinge be a protection and defence that theſe auncient hiſtories be not blemiſhed in the handes of Zoylous Sycophants, which as Socrates ſayth, being obſcure perſons, and ſuch as haue no pith or ſubſtance in them, go about moſt commonly to purchaſe vnto them ſelues fame and credit by diſpraiſing of others. God ſend your Ladiſhip many ioyfull yeares. From London the firſt of September. 1576.

            THE TRANSLATOR VNTO THE CHRISTIAN READER, AS TOVCHING THE TRANSLATION OF THESE AVNCIENT HISTORIES.
            
               AS I am geuen to vnderſtande (good Chriſtian reader) there haue bene diuers vvhich attempted to tranſlate theſe auncient Eccleſiaſtical hiſtories, yet haue geuen ouer their purpoſe, partly being diſcouraged vvith the diuerſitie and corruption of Greeke copies, and partly being diſmayed vvith the crookednes of Euſebius ſtile, vvhich is by reaſon of his vnperfect allegations, and last of all, beinge vvhollie ouercome vvith the tedious ſtudie and infinite toyle and labour. The occaſion that moued me to take ſo great an enterpriſe in hand vvas, that I read them in Greeke vnto an honorable Ladie of this lande, and hauing ſome leaſure beſides the lecture and other exerciſes agreeable vnto my calling, I thought good to turne the priuate commoditie vnto a publique profite, and to make the Chriſtian reader of this my natiue countrey partaker alſo of theſe learned, zealous, and pleaſaunt hiſtories. VVhen I tooke penne in hande, and conſidered vvith my ſelfe all the circumſtances of theſe Hiſtories, and founde in them certen things vvhich the autors peraduenture might haue left vnvvritten, but the interpretor in no vviſe vntranſlated: I remembred the ſaying of Auguſtine, Diuinitatis eſt non errare, It belongeth to the Diuinitie, or to God him ſelfe not to erre, and that theſe Hiſtoriographers vvere but men, yet rare and ſinguler perſons. Daily experience teacheth vs there is no gardē vvithout ſome vveeds, no medovv vvithout ſome vnſauerie floures, no foreſt vvithout ſome vnfrutefull trees, no countrey vvithout ſome barren land, no vvheate vvithout ſome tares, no day vvithout a cloude, no vvriter vvithout ſome blemish, or that eſcapeth the reprehenſion of all men. I am ſure there is no reader ſo foolish as to builde vpon the antiquitie and autoritie of theſe hiſtories as if they vvere holy ſcripture, there is an hiſtoricall Faith vvhich is not in the compaſſe of our Creede, and if you happen to light vpon any ſtorie that ſauoureth of ſuperſtition, or that ſeemeth vnpoſsible, penes autorem ſit fides, referre it to the autor, take it as cheape as ye finde it, remember that the holy Ghoſt ſayth, omnis homo mendax. if ſo, peraduenture the reader to, then let the one beare vvith the other. VVhere the places did require, leſt the reader shoulde be ſnared in errour, I haue laide dovvne Cenſures of an other letter then the texte is of, vvhere the autor vvas obſcure, I haue opened him vvith notes in the marge, vvhere I founde the ſtorie vnperfect, I haue noted it vvith a ſtarre, and ſignified vvithall vvhat my penne directed me vnto. Manie Latine vvriters haue imployed great diligence and labour about theſe Greeke Hiſtoriographers, one tranſlating one peece, an other an other peece, one interpreting one of the autors, an other trāſlating almoſt all, one peruſing, an other correcting. Ierome turned Euſebius into Latine, but it is not extant. Ruffinus tooke vpon him to tranſlate Euſebius. Of him Ierome vvryteth inIerom

Ruffinus deſerued but ſmall praiſe for his tranſlations, becauſe of purpoſe he tooke no heede vnto the vvordes and meaning of the autor vvhich he tooke vpon him to tranſlate, but interpreted for the moſt parte at his pleaſure, by adding and diminishing, more like a Paraphraſt then a tranſlator. I finde by peruſing of him that he vttered in fevv vvords, vvhich Euſebius vvrote at large: that he is tedious vvhere Euſebius is brief: that he is obſcure vvhere Euſebius is plaine: that he hath omitted vvhere Euſebius is darke, vvords and ſentences and pages, and Epiſtles, and in maner vvholl bookes. Half the eight booke of Euſebius (ſo hath Muſculus to) and in maner all the tenth booke, he hath not once touched. Ruffinus vvrote the hiſtorie of his time in tvvo bookes, and erred fovvly in certen things, as Socrates doeth report of him. Epiphanius Scholaſticus tranſlated the Tripartite hiſtorie. Ioachimus Camerarius geueth of himohanius. this iudgement. Tantam deprehendi in tranſlatione non modo barbariem ſed etiā inſcitiam ac ſomnolentiam iſtius Epiphanij, vt mirarer vlli Graecorum non adeo alienam linguam Latinam, ſed ignoratam ſuam eſſe potuiſſe. I founde in the tranſlation of this Epiphanius, not onely ſuch barbarous phraſes, but alſo ignoraunce and palpable errour, that I can not chuſe but maruell, hovve any Grecian coulde be vnskilfull, not ſo muche in the ſtraunge Latine tongue, as ignorant in his ovvne language.

This Muſculus as it is very like, vvanting perfect coppies, erred fovvly in infinite places. Moreouer, he is ſo obſcure that the Tranſlator hath neede of an interpretour, ſo intricate that the Reader is novve and than graueled, ſo briefe that the Greeke autors them ſelues doe grieuouſlie complaine, that the ſentences in their Hiſtories vvere not fullie expreſſed. Though the reporter be partiall being of a contrarie religion, yet herein I finde his iudgement to be true, and ſpecially in his tranſlation of the tenth booke of Euſebius. yet not I only, but others haue founde it. Iacobus Grynaeus a learned man, corrected many faultes,naeus. explicated many places, printed in the marge many notes, yet after al this his labour vvhich deſerueth great commendation, there are founde infinite eſcapes, and for triall thereof, Ireport me vnto the Reader.

I founde the Greeke coppie of Euſebius in manie places vvonderfull crabbed, his Hiſtorie is full of allegations, ſayings

His vvords are ſvveete, his vaine pleaſaunt, &amp; his inuention very vvittie. though the hiſtorie be large, his bookes long, and the labour great in vvryting of them, yet vvas I very much recreated vvith the ſvveteneſſe of the vvorke. Euagrius, vvho beganne vvhere Socrates left, and continevved his penne vnto the endeEuagrius of the firſt ſix hundred yeares after Chriſt, is full of Dialects, and therefore in Greeke not ſo pleaſaunt as Socrates. He hath many ſuperſtitious ſtories vvhich might very vvell haue bene ſpared. But in peruſing of him I vvould haue the reader to note the great chaunge that vvas in his time more then in the dayes of the former vvryters, and therafter to conſider of the times follovving, the difference that is in theſe our dayes betvvene the Church and the Apoſtolicke times. the encreaſe, augmentation, &amp; daily adding of ceremonies to ceremonies, ſeruice vpon ſeruice, vvith other Eccleſiaſticall rites and decrees, is not the encreaſe of pietie and the perfection of godlines, for our Sauiour telleth vs in the Goſpel, that tovvards theMath.

Moreouer Euagrius being a tēporall man, ſtuffeth his Hiſtorie vvith prophane ſtories of vvarres and vvarlike engines, of battailes and loudshed, of Barbarians and Heathen nations. In deſcribing the ſituation of any ſoyle, the erection of buildings, and vertues of ſome proper perſon, he doth excell.

The faultes that are therein, I attribute them rather vnto the corrupt coppies, then to any vvant of knovvledge in him. Such things as are to be noted in him, I haue laid them in the preface before his booke.

It is a vvonder to ſee the zeale of their prayers, their charitie tovvards all men, their conſtancie in torment, and their confidence in Chriſt Ieſus. Theſe be they vvhome S. Iohn in his Apocalypſe ſavve in a viſion vnder the altare, that vvere Martyred for thec. 6. 7. vvord of God and the teſtimonie of Christ Ieſus, vvhich cried vvith a loud voyce, ſaying: Hovve long tariest thou Lord, holy and true, to iudge and to auēge our bloude, on them that dvvell on the earth. And long vvhite garments vvere geuen vnto euery one of them, and it vvas ſayd vnto them, that they should rest yet for a litle ſeaſon, vntill their felovve ſeruaunts and their brethern that should be killed as they vvere, vvere fulfilled. The Angell telleth him vvho they vvere that vvere arayed in long vvhite garmentes, and vvhence they came, ſaying: theſe are they vvhich came out of great tribulation, and haue vvashed their long robes, and made them vvhite by the bloude of the Lambe, therfore are they in the preſence of the throne of God, and ſerue him day and night in his temple: and he that ſitteth in the throne vvill dvvell among them. They shall hunger no more, neither thurſt, and God shall vvipe avvay all teares from their eyes. Very comfortable vvordes. But the executioners, the tyrantes, and tormentours hearts vvere ſo hardened, that neither voyces from aboue, nor ſignes in the 
                  •
               er threatning vengeance and the vvrath of God to light vpō them, neither the ſvvetting of ſtones, nor the monſters that the earth brought forth could mollifie their ſtonie mindes. The ſea ouerflovved the land, the earth opened and left daungerous gulphes, Earthquakes ouerthrevve their Tovvnes and Cities, fire burned their houſes, yet vvoulde they not leaue of their furie. They vvere as S. Paul ſayeth, turned into a reprobate ſenſe, they left no villanie vnpractiſed, in the ende many of them fell into frenſie and madnes, they ranne them ſelues vpon naked ſvvordes, they brake their ovvne neckes, they hanged them ſelues, they tumbled them ſelues headlong into riuers, they cutte their ovvne throtes, and diuerſly diſpatched them ſelues. This is the viall full of the vvrathe of God,

vvhich the Angell in the reuelation povvred vpon the vvaters, and the voyce that folovved after may very vvell be ſpoken of them: O Lord vvhich art and vvaſt, thou art righteous and holy, becauſe thou hast geuen ſuch iudgements, for they haue shed out the bloud of Saincts and Prophets, and therefore haſt thou geuen them bloud to drinke, for they haue deſerued it. The aforeſaid Martyrs gaue forth godly ſayings, diuine precepts for the poſteritie, they ſealed their doctrine vvith their ovvne bloude, they ſpared not their liues vnto the death, they are gone before, they shevved vs the vvay to follovv after, theſe (good Chriſtian reader) vvith other things are to be ſeene throughout theſe Hiſtories. The Chapiters in the Greeke vvere in many places very ſmall, if I shoulde haue follovved the Greeke diuiſion, then had I left much vvaſt paper, I haue ſometimes ioyned tvvo or three together, ſome other times taken them as they lay, yet vvhere I altered the diuiſion, I noted in the marge the number of the Greeke Chapiters. There is no raigne of any Emperour, no ſtorie almoſt vvorthie the noting, but thou haſt in the marge the yeare of the Lord for the better vnderſtanding therof. VVhatſoeuer I found in the Greeke, vvere it good or bad, that haue I faithfullie vvithout any parcialitie at all laide dovvne in English. VVherfore if ought be vvell done, geue the praiſe vnto God. let the paines be mine, and the profit the Readers.

                        That Ieſus and the very name of Chriſt from the beginning was both knowen and honored among the deuine Prophets, that Chriſt was both a King, an highprieſt, and a Prophet.
                     
                     THat the name both of Ieſus and alſo of Chriſt among the holy prophets of old was honored, nowe is it time to declare. Moſes firſt of all knowing the name of Chriſt to be of great reuerence &amp; glorious, deliuering types of heauenly things, &amp; pledges &amp; miſtical formes (according vnto y• commaundement preſcribed, ſaying vnto him: See thou doe all thinges after the

So then he deemed Chriſt to be a certayne deuine thyng. The ſame Moſes alſo, when, being inſpired with the holy Ghoſt he had wel forſeene the name of Ieſu, iudged the ſame worthy of ſinguler prerogatiue: for this name of Ieſu appeared not manifeſt among men afore it was knowen by Moſes, and this name he gaue to him firſt, and to him alone whom he knew very wel by tipe &amp; figuratiue ſigne to receaue the vniuerſal principality after his death.

The name of Christ therefore among the Hebrewes hath not onely honored thoſe that were adorned with the high prieſthood, anointed with figuratiue oyle prepared for that purpoſe: but alſo princes whom the Prophets by the precept of God haue anoynted and made figuratiue Christs: becauſe they figuratiuely reſembled the deuine worde of God, and the regall and princely power of the onely and true Chriſt gouerning all thinges. And moreouer we haue learned certaine of the Prophets typicalye by their anoynting to haue bene termed Chriſts. Al they had a relation vnto the true Christ, the deuine and heauenly worde, the onely highprieſt of all, the king of all creatures and the chiefe Prophet of the father ouer all other Prophets, the proofe hereof is playne: for none euer of all them that typicaly were anoynted, were they Princes, or Prieſts, or Prophets, haue purchaſed vnto them ſelues ſuche deuine power and vertue as our ſauiour and Lorde Ieſus Chriſt ſole and ſinguler hath ſhewed. None of all them howe famous ſo euer they were found, among their owne throughout many ages by reaſon of their dignitie and honor haue beſtowed this benefit vpon their ſubiects, that by their imaginatiue appellation of Chriſt they ſhould by name be conſecrated Chriſtians in deede. Neyther hath the honor of adoration bene exhibited by the poſteritie vnto any of them, neither after their death hath there bene any ſuch affection, that for their ſake any prepared them ſelues to dye for the maintenance of their honor, neither hath there bene any tumult among the Gentils throughout the worlde for any of them, the power of the ſhadow was not of ſuch efficacy in them, as the preſence of the verity by our ſauiour declared, which reſembled nether the forme or figure of any: nether linealy deſcended according vnto the fleſhe from the Prieſts: neither was exalted by the might of men vnto his kingdome: neither

prophecied after the maner of the auncient Prophets: neither obtayned any preeminence or prerogatiue amonge the Iewes: yet for all this, Chriſt, being by the diuine ſpirite adorned with all theſe dignities though not in types yet in trueth it ſelfe, and enioyinge all the gyftes of thoſe men (whereof mention is made) he hath bene more publiſhed and preached, and hath powred vpon vs the perfect ornature of his moſte reuerent and holy name, not turning henceforthe vnto types and ſhadowes ſuch as ſerue him, but vnto the naked trueth, the heauenly life, and vndoubted doctrine of verity, his anoynting was not corporall, but ſpirituall, by participation of the vnbegotten dyetie of the father, the whiche thinge Eſai declareth when as in the perſon of Chriſt he breaketh out into theſe wordes: The ſpirite of the Lorde vpon me, vvherefore he anoynted

And in an other place, Dauid declaring his dignitie ſayeth: The Lorde
                        Pſal. 110. 
                        ſayde vnto my Lorde, ſit thou on my right hand, vntil I make thine enemies thy footeſtole. And out of my vvombe before the day ſtarre haue I begotten thee. The Lorde ſvvare, neither vvil it repent him, thou art a Prieſt for euer after the order of Melchiſedech.
                         This Melchiſedech in theGeneſ. 14 Heb. 4. 7. ſacred Scriptures is ſayde to be the Prieſt of the moſt highe God, ſo conſecrated and ordayned neither by any oyle prepared of man for that purpoſe, neither by ſucceſſion of kindred attayning vnto the prieſthoode as the maner was among the Hebrewes. Wherfore our Sauiour according vnto that order and not others (which receaued ſignes &amp; ſhadowes) is publiſhed by performance of the othe, Christ and Priest.

The tyme of which taxing vnder Cyrenius, Flauius Ioſephus an auncient hiſtoriographer among the Hebrevves maketh mention of, adding thereunto an other hiſtory of the hereſye of the Galilaeans, which ſprong vp about the ſame time, wherof amongeſt vs alſo Luke in the Actes of the Apoſtles mentioneth writing thus: After this maner ſtarted vp on Iudas of Galilee in the dayes of tribute &amp; drevve avvay many of the people after him, he alſo him ſelfe perished and as many as obeyed him vvere ſcattered abrode. The ſame doth Ioſephus (before mentioned) in his eyghtenth booke of Antiquities confirme thus, by worde: Cyrenius of the number of Conſuls vvhich enioyed other principalities, and by the conſent of all men ſo preuailed that he vvas thought vvorthy of the Conſulship &amp; counted great by reaſon of other dignities, came vvith a fevve into Syria, ſent for this purpoſe by Caeſar that he should haue there the iuriſdiction of the Gentiles, &amp; be Cenſor of their ſubſtance.

                        inferred nothing els but manifeſt ſeruitude, &amp; exhorted the Gentils to ſet their helping hand to the maintenance of their libertie And in his ſecond booke of the warres of the Ievves, he writeth thus of him: About that time a certaine Galilaean by name Iudas, ſeduced the people of that region, miſliking vvith this, to vvit: that they ſuſtained the payment of tribute, vnto the Romaine empire, &amp; vnder God that they ſuffred mortall men to beare rule ouer them.

And the vvord of begetting, he ouerskipped vvith ſilence vn to the ende, vvith ſuch a recital of ſonnes, making relation vnto Adam vvhich vvas of God. neither is this hard to be proued, or to ſmale purpoſe propoſed. The kinſmen of Chriſt according vnto the flesh, either making apparēt or ſimply inſtructing, yet altogether teaching that vvhich is true: haue deliuered theſe thinges vnto vs: hovve that the Idumaean the eues inuading the city Aſcalon in Palaeſtina, tooke captiue together vvith other ſpoiles out of the temple of Apollo, adioyning vnto the vvalls, Antipater, ſonne to one Herode▪

VVhē the prieſt vvas not able to pay raunſome for his ſonne, this Antipater vvas brought vp after the maner of the Idumaeans, &amp; became very familiar vvith Hyrcanus the high prieſt of the Ievves. &amp; hauing bene in embaſye vvith Pompeye in Hircanus ſteade, he reſtored vnto him the kingdome vvhich vvas taken from his brother Aristobulus, aſſigned him ſelfe gouernour of Palaeſtina, and proceaded forvvardes in felicitie. VVhen this Antipater vvas enuyed for his greate felicitie, and vvas trayterouſly ſlayne, there ſucceded him his ſonne Herode, vvhich at length of Antonius and Augustus, by decree of the Senate, receaued rule ouer the Ievves, vvhoſe ſonnes vvere Herode, and the other Tetrarches.
                         Theſe thinges are common among the greeke hiſtoryes. And when as vnto that tyme the genealogies of the Hebrevves, yea of them alſo linealy deſcending of Proſelytes, as Achior the Amanyte, and Ruth the Moabyte, likewiſe as many as fell, beinge deliuered from out of Aegypt, and mixt with the Iſraelites, were recorded amonge their auncient monuments: Herode, whome the Iſraeliticall genealogie auayled nothinge, beinge prickedHerode burned the genealogies of the Hebrevves to make him ſelfe a gentleman. in mynde with the baſenes of his byrthe, burned their auncient recorded genealogies, ſuppoſing thereby to deriue him ſelfe of noble parentage, if none other holpen by publique recordes were able to prone their pedegrewes from the Patriarches, or Proſelytes, or ſuch as were cleped ſtrangers horne, and mingled of olde amonge the Iſraelytes.

The aduerſaryes of the trueth, thought better to erre with Euſebius, by ſaying that Cephas was rebuked by Paule, and not Peter, rather then that they woulde graunte Peter (whome they terme the Prince of the Apostles) to be controlled of Paule, ſuppoſing hereby a preſiding to enſur agaynst the prymacye of the Pope, or liking of this opinion as a bare ſhift to stoppe the ſclannderous mouth of Porphyrius, which here took occaſion to reprehende the Christians for their ſedition, but let vs confeſſe the trueth, and ſhame the deuill.Galat.

Ierome with other graue writers, affirmeth ſuch circumstances to haue bene. Euſebius whoſe creditt herein is not ſmale, reporteth the ſame to haue bene taken out of their recordes in the city of Edeſſa, regeſtred there in the Syrian tongue, and by him tranſlated out of the Syrian, into the greeke tongue. I ſidorus and Gelaſius, the firſt of that name, biſhop of Rome, about the yeare of our Lorde 494. together with 70. other Biſhops, decreed that the Churche of God ſhould receaue the ſame epistles, for no other then Apocrypha, one thing I may not here runne ouerwith ſilence, but admoniſhe the Reader of, how that late writers, namely Damaſcenus, and that fabulous Hiſtoriographer Nicephorus haue added vnto this hiſtory fabulous reportes, howe that Abgarus, gouernour of Edeſſa, ſent his letter vnto Ieſu, and with all a certayne paynter which might vewe him well, &amp; bring vnto him backe againe the lively picture of Ieſu, the which painter (as they reporte) being not able (for the glorious brightneſſe of his gracious countenance) to bring his purpoſe to effect: our Sauiour him ſelfe tooke an handkerchef, and layde to his deuine and liuely face, and by the wiping of his face, his picture was therein impreſſed, the which he ſent to Abgarus. Nicephorus patcheth other fables therunto: firſt he ſayth, that the King of Perſia ſent a paynter vnto Ieſu, which brought vnto him the picture of Ieſu, and alſo of Mary his mother. Agayne that the Edeſſaeans in the time of Iuſtinianus the Emperour, being beſieged and brought to ſuch a narrowe ſtraicte, that there remayned no hope of deliuer ance, but a preſent foyle and ouerthrowe, in the ſame lamentable plight, to haue runne vnto this picture for a refuge, wher (as they ſay) they foūd preſēt remedy. beleue it who wil. Euſebius, who ſearched their records, who layde downe the copye of the Epistles, who tranſlated faythfully all that he founde there, toutching Chriſt, neyther ſawe, neyther heard, of any ſuch thing, for he promiſed in the preface to his hiſtory, to omitt nothing that ſhoulde ſeeme pertinent. if the other writers founde it, why did not Euſebius finde it? if the other writers thought expedient to publiſhe the ſame, why did Euſebius omitt it? nay it was not there founde at al, but forged. therefore recount them for fables. the firſt that reported them, was a hundred yeares after Euſebius.

Then Herode as the holy Ghoſt witneſſeth, perceauing the death of Iames to haue pleaſed the Ievves, layeth wayt for Peter, whome, when he had taken, he caſt into priſon, whoſe death he had procured, had not the Angel of the Lorde, by diuine apparition, aſſiſted him by night, miraculouſly louſing his fetters, and reſtoring him to the office of preaching? And ſuch was the will of God concerning Peter.

                        How that Agrippa otherwiſe called Herode, perſecuting the Apoſtles, and extolling him ſelfe, felt the heauy hand of God, to his destruction.
                     
                     THe enterpriſes of the king, againſt the Apoſtles of Chriſt, paſſed not long vnpuniſhed. For immediatly after his priuy practiſes agaynſt the Apoſtles (as it is in the Actes) when he was in Caeſarea, vpon an high ſolemne day, arayed in a gorgeous, and princely robe, preaching vnto the people from his lofty tribunall ſeate, the plague of God (as meſſenger of iuſtice) apprehended him. and when as the whole multitude in compaſſe, had ſhowted to his prayſe, that to their hearing the voyce of God, and not of man proceeded from him▪ the Angell of the Lorde (as the Scripture witneſſeth) ſmote him, ſo that he was conſumed of wormes, and miſerably finiſhedAct. 12. his mortal life. And that conſent is worthy of memory, which is found betwene holy Scripture in this miraculous fact, and the hiſtory of Ioſephus, wher he deliuereth vnto vs a manifeſt teſtimony of the trueth, to witt, in the ninetenth booke of Iudaicall Antiquities, writing this miracle in theſe wordes: Novv vvas the thirde yeare of his Lieuetenantshipp throughout all Iudaea,
                        Ioſeph. Anti. lib. 19. cap. 7.

Vnto this feaſte frequented the vvhole multitude of thoſe vvhich vvere chiefe in that prouince, and aduanced to higheſt promotion, and dignity. The ſeconde day of theſe ſpectacles, the king putting on a robe of ſiluer, vvonderfully vvrought, at the davvning of the day came to the theatre, vvhere his ſiluer robe, by reflexe of the ſunne beames being lightned, yelded ſo gorgeous a gliſtring to the eye, that the shining thereof ſeemed terrible, and intollerable to the behoulders. Flatterers forthvvith, one, one thing, an other, an other thing, bolted out ſuch ſentences, as turned in the ende to his confuſion, ſaluting him for God,

Theſe thinges the king rebuked not, neither repelled this impious flatterie. But vvhen he a litle after looked about, he behelde an Angell hanging
                        This Angell in Ioſephus is an Ovvle. ouer his head. The ſame foorthvvith he ſuppoſed to be a meſſenger of euill, vvho before vvas of goodneſſe. Sodenly he felt him ſelfe pricked at the hart vvith extreme vehemencie of paine in his bovvels, &amp; heauily beholding his friendes, ſaide: I vvhich ſeeme to you a God, amThe oration of Herode Agrippa a litle before his death. novve conſtrayned to end the race of this lyfe. fatal deſtinie hath founde fault, vvith your fonde flatteries, vvhich of late you ſounded to my prayſe.

For vve haue liued not miſerably, but in that proſperous eſtate vvhich is termed bleſſed. VVhen he had vttered theſe vvordes he ſickned more &amp; more. Then vvas he carefully, &amp; circūſpectly caried, vnto the Palace. but the rumor vvas ſpred abroad, ouer al the contrey,If thou haddeſt lyued vvell, no doubt thou sholdeſt haue died vvel▪ thy life vvas very ill, thine end farre vvorſe. Herode Agrippa king of the Ievves ſeuen yeres. He vvas called ſomtimes Herod, ſomtimes Agrippa. 
                        that vvithout peraduenture, he vvould dye shortly. The multitude foorthvvith together vvith vvomen, and children, couered vvith ſackcloth, after their contrey manner, made ſupplication vnto God for their king, ſo that all ſounded of ſorovve, and lamentation. The king lying in an high lodging, and beholding the people proſtrate vpon their knees, could not refrayne frō teares. But after that he had ben vexed, the ſpace of fiue dayes, vvith bitter gnavving of his bovvels, he ended this lyfe, being the fiftie, and fourth yere, of his age, and the ſeuenth of his raigne. For the ſpace of foure yeres he raigned vnder Caius Caeſar, gouerning the tetrarchie of Philip three yeres. And the fourth yere, that vvhich he tooke of Herode. the other three yeres, he paſſed vnder Claudius Caeſar.
                         Theſe thinges I deepely way that Ioſephus, and others together with the diuine ſcriptures, hath truely alleaged. But if any ſeme to miſlyke with them ſelues toutching the name of the kyng, the tyme it ſelfe, and the Actes do declare him, to be the ſame, ſo that eyther by the error of the writer, the name was changed, or that he had two names, as many others haue had.
                     
                        The cenſure of the tranſlatour toutching the doubt rayſed about the name of Herode, vvhiche vvas ſmitten of the Angell vvith mortalitie.
                        EVſebius in this former chapiter ſeemeth to cleare a certayne doubt, which may riſe about the name of this king, whether he were called Herode (as Luke writeth in the Actes of the Apſtles) or Agrippa, as Ioſephus euery where termeth him. Luke ſaythi Herode the king ſtretched forth his hand &amp;c. Act. 12. Agayne, Luke ſayth: Herode went downe from Iud
                              ••
                            to Caeſarea. Euſebius, and Ioſephus do ſay, that Agrippa after he had continued three yeres in the kingdome of Iudaea, went downe to Caeſarea. Antiq. lib. 19. cap. 7. Luke ſayth: Vpon a day appointed, Herode arrayed him ſelfe in royall apparel, and ſate on the iudgement ſeate, and made an oration vnto the people, &amp; the people gaue a shoute, ſaying: The voyce of God, and not of man. Euſebius and Ioſephus ſay: Agrippa the ſeconde day of theſe ſpectacles, or ſtageplayes, putting on a robe of ſiluer which gliſtered &amp;c. The flatterers ſaluted him for God. Luke ſayth: The Angell of the Lord ſmote him. Euſebius ſayth: He behelde an Angell hanging ouer his head. Ioſephus ſayth: he ſawe an Owle ſit ouer his head, and forthwith he ſuppoſed her to be a meſſenger of ill lucke▪ last of all Luke ſayth: He vvas eaten of vvormes and gaue vp the ghoſt. Euſebius and Ioſephus ſay: that he was pricked at the hart with extreme payne, and bitter gnawing of the bowelles. all which circumſtances 
                              •
                           ende to one effecte▪ the greatest diſagreement that I ſee, is, in the name. By peruſing the hiſtories of Ioſephus &amp; Euſebius, I can not perceaue, that there were more Herodes, frō the birth of Chriſt (which were kinges of the Iewes) vnto the vtter ouerthrowe of Ieruſalē, vnder Titus, and Veſpaſian, (when 
                              •
                           s their kinges, and highpriestes were quite cut of) then two: the firſt: Herode the Idumaean, who ſlue the infantes, called alſo Herode the great. The ſeconde: Herode the Tetrarche, called Herodes minor, whoſe beginninges and endinges, the reader may beholde in the Chronographie printed in the ende of this preſent volume. Euſebius (lib. 2. cap. 4. alſo in his Chronicon, and Ioſephus, Antiq. lib. 18. cap. 11. &amp; 14. &amp; bell. Iud. lib. 1. cap. 10. 11.) do write: that Agrippa (toutching whom this preſent doubt doth riſe) being the ſonne of Aristobulus, nephew to Herode the great, brother to Herodias came to Rome, the yere before Tiberius died, and was a ſuter vnto the Emperour Tiberius, for ſome office or other. Tiberius vpon diſpleaſure conceaued agaynſt him, clapt him in priſon. This Agrippa after the death of Tiberius, grew in ſuch fauour &amp; credite with Caius Caligula (who ſucceeded

Tiberius) That he accuſed Herode the Tetrarche before the Emperour of treaſon, for whiche crime Herode (being conuinced) together with Herodias was commaunded to perpetuall baniſhment, and he appointed king of the Iewes. This Agrippa was king ſeuen yeres, foure vnder Caius Caligula, and three vnder Claudius. of Claudius

Chriſti. 46. though they differ in the name, Luke only calleth him Herode, all other writers call him Agrippa. Yet in Ioſephus (Antiq. lib. 19. cap. 5.) I finde, that this Agrippa had to his brother on Herode. Agrippa (ſayth he) begged of Claudius, for his brother Herode, the kingdome of Chalcis. Agayne Ioſephus ſayth there met Agrippa certayne kinges, Pariter &amp; Herodes frater eius, qui &amp; ipſe Chalcidis habebat imperium: and with all his brother Herode, whiche alſo was king of Chalcis. lib. 19. Antiq. cap. 7. Claudius wrote vnto the preſident of Alexandria, in the behalfe of the Iewes, ſupplicantibus ſibi regibus, Agrippa, pariter &amp; Herode, at the requeſt both of Agrippa and Herode the kinges. Antiq. lib. 19. cap. 5. agayne in the ſame place Claudius him ſelfe in his edict, ſayth: Petentibus me regibus, Agrippa, &amp; Herode Chariſſimis &amp;c. libenter hoc praebui: when as Agrippa and Herode, our deare princes, made the petition vnto me, I willingly condeſcended therunto. I finde moreouer mention made, that this Herode ſuruiued his brother Agrippa. Ioſephus writeth thus Antiquit. lib. 20. cap. 1. Herode the brother of the late deſeaſed Agrippa, then king of Chalcis, requeſted of Claudius Caeſar, autoritie ouer the temple, the ordayning of Prieſtes, all vvhiche he obtayned. a litle after it foloweth: Herode remoued Canthara from the highprieſthoode, and ſubſtituted Ioſoph the ſonne of Camus. Moreouer Ioſephus ſayth: Antiq. lib. 19. cap. 7. that after the departure of his brother, he conſpired the death of Sylas. this is all, that I finde to haue ben done by this Herod. finally he died in his bed, his ende being come without any manifeſt or knowen diſeaſe. Ioſephus ſayth: Deſunctus eſt Herodes frater regis Agrippae maioris, octauo anno Claudij principatus, cuius regnum, Claudius Agrippae iuueni dedit. Herode the brother of king Agrippae the greater, died the. 8. yeere, of the raigne of Claudius, whoſe kingdome Claudius aſſigned vnto yong Agrippa Antiq. lib. 20. cap. 5. bell. Iud. lib. 1. cap. 10. 11. VVe may in no wiſe think that Luke erred herein, he might peraduēture meane this Herode, who had ſome doing in the tēple, ſome dealing among the prieſts, ſome autoritie ouer the Iewes, who was carefull for them, together with his brother Agrippa. but his ende hath no affinitie, with that of Luke if we may credite Ioſephus, who no doubt (being a Iewe then liuing) was moſt ſkilfull, and beſt ſeene in the Iewiſh affaires▪ wherfore to reconcile this diſſagrement. let vs call him Herode with Luke, &amp; Agrippa with Euſebius and Ioſephus. nay leſſe that we ſeeme contrary to our ſelues, in taking contrary partes, let vs make them frendes and ioyning their handes together, name the childe Herode Agrippa, which Euſebius meant, when he gathered the ſummarie of his chapiters ſaying: 
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           , howe that Agrippa and Herode perſecuting the Apoſtles. Euſebius alſo in the later ende of the chapiter, ſuppoſeth the name either to haue ben changed, by ſome error of the writer, or els that he was, 
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           , called after two names. In as much as hitherto in this our cenſure, together with the other writers, we haue layd downe the names of the kinges which gouerned the Iewes ſince the birth of Chriſt: there remaineth yet one (which Euſebius lib. 2. cap. 19. toutcheth) to be ſpoken of, that the reader may finde the hiſtory, layd downe in an ample, and perfect maner▪ the ſame is Agrippa the yonger or leſſer. After Herode the Idumaean, or the great which raigned 37. yeres (foure only after the birth of Chriſt) ſucceded Archelaus, which continewed king nyne yeares. The thirde, after the birth of Chriſt was Herode the Tetrarche, who raigned 24. yeres. The fourth was Agrippa maior (touching whoſe name this controuer ſie roſe) who raigned ſeuen yeres. The fifth and the laſt was Agrippa minor, ſonne to the former Agrippa, whom the Angel ſtroke. this Agrippa raigned. 26. yeres to the deſtruction of Ieruſalem, and the vtter ouerthrowe of the Iewes. Ioſephus writeth of him (Antiq. lib. 19. cap. 8.) that he was but 17. yeres olde when his father died. This was he before whome Paul pleaded in the Actes of the Apoſtles when he ſayd: I thinke my ſelfe happie king Agrippa, becauſe I shall aunſvvere this day before thee &amp;c. becauſe thou haſt knovvledge of all cuſtomes, and queſtions, vvhiche are among the Ievves. In the ende Paul ſayd: O king Agrippa beleueſt thou the prophetes? I knovve that thou beleueſt. then Agrippa ſayd vnto Paul: almoſt thou perſvvadeſt me to be a Chriſtian &amp;c.

Nowe (gentle reader) thou mayest hereby note the wiſdome and prouidence of God toutching this wicked broode, that as Ioſephus (Antiq. lib. 18. cap. 11.) writeth: Inter centum annorum ſpacium, cuncta Herodis origo conſumpta eſt, within the compaſſe of one hundred yeres, all the progeny of Herode was rooted out.

                     FIrſt of all, this playnely appeareth, that he paſſed not the limites of veritye, by reaſon of him ſelfe, or of any other in reporting thoſe thinges whiche he wrote in that booke, by him entituled: of the life contemplatiue, or vvorshippers, ſaying: that the men and women were called worſhippers, eyther becauſe like cunning Phiſitians, they cured, and healed ſuch as came vnto them of their malitious paſſions: or els becauſe that religiouſly, they worſhipped the celeſtiall godhead, with pure and ſincere worſhip. But whether he gaue them this name of his proper perſon, for the aforeſayde cauſe: or whether at the beginninge they were ſo called, when as yet the name of Chriſtians was not euery where publiſhed: I thinke it not needefull curiouſly to ſhift out.

For in the Actes of the Apoſtles, whence no doubt this is rehearſed, it is written thatAct. 4. all the familiares of the Apoſtles ſould their ſubſtance, and poſſeſſion, diſtributing to euery one, as need required, ſo that none wanted among them. For as many, (ſayth the text) as had lands or houſes, ſould them, bringing the price thereof, and laying it at the Apoſtles feete, to this purpoſe, that ſeuerally euery ones want, and neceſſity, might be ſupplied. The like doth the ſame Philo teſtifie, writing thus: In many places this kinde of people liueth (for it behoued as

And a litle after, he ſayth: All the ſpace that is from morning to euening, is of them ſpent, in godly exerciſe▪ for, reading the holy Scriptures, they meditate thereupon, handling allegorically, the diuine philoſophy of their natiue contrey. And they ſuppoſe thoſe types of ſecretye, vvhich by figures are ſignified, to be made manifeſt by the expoſition of the Scriptures. They haue certayne Commentaryes of auncient vvriters, vvho beinge ringleaders of their opinions, haue left vnto their poſterityes, monuments of many thinges Allegorically handeled, vvhiche they vſing as principall types, do imitate the drifte of their trade. Theſe thinges ſeeme to haue bene vttered by this man, as thoughe he had bene an auditor, vnto their expoſition of the Scriptures. It is alſo very like that the Commentaryes (whiche he reporteth to haue bene amonge them) were the Goſpells, and the workes of the Apoſtles, and certayne expoſitions of the auncyent Prophetes, partlye ſuche as that Epiſtle vnto the Hebrevves is, and alſo the other Epiſtles of Paul doe contayne. To be ſhorte, that they newely compiled, and collected Pſalmes, thus he writeth: They contemplate not only diuine things, but they make graue canticles, &amp; hymnes vnto God,
                        Pſalmes and Hymnes. 
                        in a more ſacred ryme, of euery kinde of metre, and verſe. And many more thinges he declareth in that booke, whiche we here mention. But thoſe thinges ſeemed neceſſaryly ſelected of him, which paynte vnto vs the ſure and certayne notes, of their Eccleſiaſticall conuerſation. But if any man ſuppoſe theſe thinges nowe ſpoken of, not properly to appertayne vnto the pollycye of the Goſpell, but to be applyed vnto others, beſydes theſe forementioned worſhippers, let him at leſte wiſe creditt that, which out of his wordes we will alleadge, and no doubt if he iudge indifferently, he ſhall finde an infallible teſtimonye.

Not one eateth, or drinketh before ſunne ſett, adiudging the diuine meditating of vviſedome, to be a vvorke of light, &amp; the curious feeding of the carkaſſe, to be a vvorke of darkenes, geuing vnto the one, the daye, vnto the other, the leſſer parte of the night. Many thinke not vpon meate, no not in vvhole three dayes, beinge rauished vvith a greater deſire of knovvledge, then of foode.

There are beſides extant, of his, ſeuerall tractes, of his Problemes. Namely, tvvo bookes of Husbandry, ſo many of drunkenes, and certayne others, hauing their proper, and peculiar title, whereof one is: vvhat the ſobre minde prayeth or vovveth? alſo of the confuſion of tongues, of vvandring and finding, of Conuenticles vnto diſcipline. of that: vvho can be heyre of the goods of God? or: vvhat diuiſion can be of equalls and contraryes? of the three vertues, whereof Moyſes, with others hath written. Moreouer: of them vvhoſe names are changed, and vvhy they vvere changed, where he witneſſeth him ſelfe to haue written agayne, and againe of teſtaments. There is extant a volume of his: of banishment, and of the life of a perfect vviſe mā, according vnto righteouſnes, or: of vnvvrittē lavves. Agayne, of Gyaunts, or: that the Godhead is not changed▪ of dreames, which according vnto Moyſes are giuen from aboue, fiue volumes. And thus much of them which he wrote on Geneſis, that came to our handes. We haue alſo knowne vpon Exodus, fiue bookes of queſtions, and of the tabernacle, and of the tenn commaundements, and foure bookes of them vvhich by nature of lavves may be referred, vnto the tenn commaundements. of the ſacrifices of beaſtes, vvhat kindes of ſacrifices there be? of that: vvhat revvardes are ſet forth to the good and godly, in the lavv? vvhat punishmentes, and curſes to the vvicked. There are founde alſo certayne ſeuerall bookes of his, as of Prouidence, and of the Ievves, of Politickes, and of Alexander,

After theſe he wrote of the life contemplatiue, or vvorshippers, whence we borowed thoſe thinges, which we alleadged concerning the Apoſtolike mens liues. the interpretations of the Hebrue names in the lawe, and Prophetes, are attributed vnto his induſtrye.

There was with him Aristarchus, whome iuſtly in ſome place ofColoſſ. 4. his Epiſtles, he calleth his felowe captiue, and Luke when he had finiſhed the Actes of the Apoſtles, concluded his hiſtory here, ſaying: that Paul liued peaceably at Rome tvvo

The which being expired, fame goeth that the Apoſtle (after accompt made of his doctrine) returned vnto the office of preaching, and afterwardes when he came the ſeconde time vnto the city, vnder the ſame Emperour,Whereof reade the 25. cap. of this 2. booke. to haue bene crowned with martyrdome. Where lying in fetters he wrote the latter Epiſtle vnto Timothe, inſtructing him both of the accompt of doctrine that he made in his former captiuity, and alſo of his death approching nigh. Take here of his owne teſtimony, for thus he writeth. At my former apparance none aſſiſted me, for all forſooke me. I pray God that it be

                        not laide to their charge. But the Lord aſſiſted me, and ſtrengthned me, that by me the preaching should be accomplished, and that all nations might heare. And I vvas deliuered out of the Lyons mouth. Playnly he ſheweth by theſe wordes that he was before deliuered out of the lions mouth (meaning as it appeareth Nero, becauſe of his cruelty) that the preaching might be ſupplyed by him. Neither afterwardes hath he added the like, for he will deliuer me out of the lions mouth. He ſaw in the ſpirite his death to drawe nigh. Wherfore immediatly he ſayth: I haue bene deliuered out of the Lyons mouth, and the Lord vvill deliuer me from euery euill vvorke, and reſerue me vnto his heauenly kingdome. Noting, his martirdome to draw nigh. The which more euidently he foreſheweth in the ſame Epiſtle, ſaying: For I am novv ready to be offred, &amp; the time of my diſſoluing is at hand. In the latter epiſtle, when he wrote, he declared Luke alone to be with him, but in his former apparance, and pleading, not one, no not Luke to be with him. Wherefore it is playne that Luke wrote the Actes of the Apoſtles vnto that time, knitting vp his hiſtory, with his abſence from Paul. Theſe thinges haue we ſpoken to this end, that we may warrant the martyrdome of Paul, not to haue bene conſummated when Luke finiſhed his hiſtory, that is, when Paul came to Rome. It is very like that the apologye of Paul for his doctrine, might haue bene at the beginning ſooner accepted, when Nero was ſomewhat milder in affection, &amp; dealing. But after that he fell vnto ſuch outragious wilfulneſſe, he was quicke with others for the Apoſtles ſake.

When as he contrary to their expectation, freely, and with greater audacity then they hoped, in preſence of all the multitude, had confeſſed Ieſus to be the ſonne of God, our Sauiour, and Lorde, they could no longer abide his teſtimony, for he was counted of all, moſt iuſt, for his excellent wiſedome, &amp; piety, which he ſhewed in life.

His knees vvere after the guiſe of a camels knee, benummed, &amp; bereft of the ſenſe of feeling, by reaſon of his continuall kneeling in ſupplication to God, and petitions for the people. For the excellency of his righteouſneſſe he vvas called Iuste, and Oblias, vvhich ſoundeth by interpretatiō: the bulvvarke, or defence of the people in righteouſnes, as prophecies do go of him. VVhen diuers asked him toutching the hereſies among the people vvherof (vve mētioned before) vvhich vvas the gate or dore of Ieſu, he aunſvvered: the ſame to be the Sauiour, by vvhoſe meanes they had beleeue Ieſus to be Chriſt. But the aforeſayde hereſies, acknovvledge neyther the reſurrection, nor the comming of any iudge, vvhich shall revvarde to euery one according to his vvorkes. For as many as beleeued, they beleeued by meanes of Iames. VVhen many of the Princes vvere perſvvaded, there roſe a tumult of the Ievves, Scribes, and Phariſes, ſaying: It is very dangerous leſt that the vvhole people looke after Ieſus, as though he vvere Chriſt, and being gathered together they ſaid to Iames: vve pray thee refraine this people, for they erre in Ieſu, as though he vvere true Chriſt. VVe pray thee perſvvade this people, vvhich frequent to this feaſte of the Paſſeouer, concerning Ieſu, for vve all obey thee, yea vve, and all the people, teſtifie of thee, that thou art iuſt, and reſpecteſt not the perſon of any man, perſvvade therefore this multitude, that they erre not in Ieſu. For the vvhole multitude, and vve, obey thee. ſtand therefore vpon the pinacle of the temple, that thou mayſt be ſeene aloft, and that thy vvord may be perceaued plainly of all the people, for becauſe of this Paſſeouer, all the tribes are mett here, together vvith the Gentiles. The aforeſayd Scribes, and Phariſes placed Iames vpon the pinacle of the temple, and shouted vnto him, and ſayd: Thou iuſt man, at vvhoſe commaundement vve all are, in ſo much that this people is ſeduced after Ieſus, vvho vvas crucified, declare vnto vs, vvhich is the dore of Ieſus crucified. And he aunſvvered vvith a lovvde voyce: vvhy aske ye me of Ieſus, the ſonne of man, vvhen as he ſitteth at the right hand of the great povver in heauen, and shal come in the clovvdes of the aëer?

But let vs clime vp, and take him, to the end the people being ſtroken vvith feare may renounce his faith.

This Iames was ſo famous and renowmed among all for his righteouſnes, that the wiſe among the Ievves, imputed the cauſe of this ſodayne beſteging of Ieruſalem after his martyrdome (which no doubt

therfore happened vnto them) to be for the preſumptuous offence, practiſed againſt him. Ioſephus ſticked not to teſtifie the ſame in theſe wordes. Theſe thinges happened vnto the Ievves in vvay

How deteſtable he was become, it is not for this preſent tyme to declare. for there be many that haue paynted out his willful malice, which may eaſily appeare if we conſider the furious madnes of that man. through the which, after that beyond all reaſon he had deſtroyed an innumerable company, he fell into ſuch a ſucking vayne of ſlaughter, that he abſtayned not from his moſt deare, and familiar friendes. Yea he tormented with diuerſe kindes of death, his owne mother, his brethren, his wife, &amp; many of his neareſt kinsfolkes, as if they had bene enemyes, and deadly foes vnto him. but it behoued vs to note this one thing of him aboue the reſt, that he was counted the firſt enemy of all y• Emperours, vntoTertul. in Apolog. the ſeruice of God. of him doth Tertullian in Romayne letters write thus: reade your authors, there shall you finde Nero, chiefely to haue firſt perſecuted this doctrine at Rome. vvhen the vvhole Eaſt vvas novv ſubdued, he became cruell vnto all men, vve boaſt and bragge of ſuch a famous perſecutor. for they vvhich knevve him may eaſily perceaue, that this our doctrine had neuer bene condemned by Nero, had it not bene paſſing good. This enemy of God (wherein he was firſt eſpied) ſet vp him ſelfe to the deſtruction of the Apoſtles, for they write that Paule was beheaded, and Peter crucified of him at Rome, and that maketh for the credit of our hiſtory which is commonly reported, that there be churchyardes vnto this day, bearing the name of Peter and Paul.

He writeth that Florus was Liuetenant of Iudaea, when as the warres being begonne of olde, encreaſed the twelfe yeare of the raygne of Nero. Agayne, becauſe of the rebellion of the Ievves throughout all Syria, there roſe ſuch a tumulte, that the Gentiles without all compaſſion, as deadely foes deſtroyed the Ievves which inhabited the cities, ſo that the cities were ſeene full of ſepulchres, olde men, and yong men, ſlaine in the ſtreetes, women lying all along, hauing that vncouered, which nature commaunded to be kept in ſecrete, and the whole prouince miſerably afflicted with vnſpeakeable calamityes. and greater was the feare (ſayth he) of that which was like to enſue, then the harme already committed. ſuch was then the ſtate of the Ievves.

The elders of olde without any doubting, haue alleadged this in their workes, but the latter Epiſtle we haue learned, not to be allowed.

Others thought this booke very neceſſary, eſpecially vnto them that haue neede of an elementall introduction, but we haue knowne him to haue bene publikely reade in the Churche, and alleadged of many auncient writers in their workes. let this much be ſpoken of the holy Scriptures, as well of the generally receaued, as of the doubtfully reiected.

But how many, and what ſincere followers haue fedd the Churches planted by the Apoſtles, it can not be affirmed, but as farre forthe as can be gathered out of the wordes of Paul: He had many fellowe laborers, and companions as he called them, whereof diuersPeter &amp; Paul had many felow laborers. haue purchaſed immortall memorye, for ſo much as he maketh continuall mention of them in his Epiſtles, and Luke in the Actes repeting the moſt famous, remembreth them by name.

And of Paule they ſaye, that he accuſtomed to mention the Goſpell of Luke when he ſpake, as of his owne, ſayinge: accordinge vnto my Goſpell. Amonge the other fellowes of Paule, Creſcens is witneſſed to haue bene ſent by the Apoſtle him ſelfe into Fraunce.

A certayn grieuous indignation inuaded this ſeely vvoman, ſo that often tymes she prouoked againſt her ſelfe, by rayling and ſcolding, the cruell rauenners. VVhen as none either moued vvith pity, or prouoked vvith anger, ſlevve her: &amp; she labored about, ſeeking vittailes, and could no longer finde any: and famine had entred into her bovvels, and inner partes: furious motions more then famine, inflamed her mind ſo, that she being ledd vvith the heat of anger, &amp; pinching or pining neceſſity, offred violence vnto nature. for taking her ſonne in her armes, vvhich vvas a ſuckling, she ſayd: O vvretched infant, for vvhom shall I reſerue thee in theſe vvarres, in this famyne, inA mother ſlayeth her owne childe to eate. this ſeditious conſpiracy? Among the Romaynes, if ſo be that vve shall liue vnder them, there shall be bondage: this bondage hath famyne for gone: theſe ſeditious perſons do afflict vs more grieuouſly then both. Paſſe on, be thou meate vnto me: a fury vnto theſe ſeditious men: a fable vnto the vvorlde: vvhiche yet alone haſt not felt the Ievvish calamities.

If you are ſo godly, and miſlike this my ſacrifice: I truely haue eaten in your name, and that vvhiche remayneth, I reſerue for my ſelfe. vvhiche vvhen she had ſayde, they all trembled at this one horrible fact, and ſcarſe leauing this meate for the mother, they departed vvith greate feare. In a vvhile after, this haynous offence vvas bruted ouer the vvhole citye, ſo that euery man behoulding before his eyes this affliction, vvas no leſſe moued, then if the fact had bene committed agaynſt him ſelfe. But they that vvere preſſed vvith famyne, deſired death earneſtly, and happy vvere they accompted, vvhome death ſo preuented, that they neyther hearde nor ſavve the greate miſery that happened. ſuch were the rewardes of iniquity, and impiety committed by the Ievves agaynſt Chriſt and God.

If any will conferre the wordes of Chriſte with the reſt of thoſe thinges that the Hiſtoriographer hath written concerninge the whole warres: how can he but fall into an admiration, and confeſſe, that the prophecy, and preſcience of our Sauiour was wonderfull, and paſſing naturall reaſon: of thoſe thinges which (after the paſſion of our Sauiour, &amp; there crying, when the whole multitude of the Ievves craued a thefeLuk. 23. and a murtherer to be deliuered) happened vnto this whole nation, I thinke it not neceſſary to entreate. But this is needefull to be noted, which commendeth the goodnes of the prouidence of God, in deferring their deſtruction, for the ſpace of forty yeares after their preſumptuous raſhenes agaynſt Chriſt, in the which yeares, many of the Apoſtles and Diſciples, (Iames by name, their firſt Biſhop, called the brother of the Lorde) as yet aliue, and abiding in the citye of Ieruſalem: haue endured and continewed as a moſt ſure fortreſſe, for that place, God winking all that while, if peraduenture they woulde repent, to the ende they might be pardoned, and ſaued. And beſides ſo notable a patience, how wonderfull ſignes from aboue were exhibited, to happen vppon the impenitent, which of the aforeſayde Hiſtoriographer are ſett forth to perpetuall memory, and are now to be deliuered of vs, vnto the Readers handes.

The land of Sodome for their abominable ſinne was ouerthrowne, with fire, and brimſtone from heauen. The Lord him ſelfe ſayd: (Geneſ. 18.) that their ſinne vvas exceeding grieuous.

Terra Sodomitica olim tam fructibus, quàm ſubſtantia ciuitatum fortunata, nunc autem omnis exuſta, atque habitatorum impietate, fulminibus conflagraſſe memoratur. denique adhuc in ea Diuini reliquias ignis, &amp; oppidorum quinque videre licet imagines, &amp; renaſcentes in fructibus cineres, qui colore quidem ſunt edulibus ſimiles, carpentium vero manibus in fumum diſſoluuntur, &amp; cinerem. The land of Sodome is knovven of olde to haue bene fortunate, both for frute and vvelth of cities, but novv to lye all parched, and to haue bene burnt vvith lightnings, for the ſinne of the inhabitants▪ to be short, as yet a man may there ſee reliques of the fire, vvhich God ſent, and tokens of the fiue cities, and ashes to ſpring agayne, and grovve in the frute, vvhich in color are like vnto the eateable frute, but being plucked dovvne in the hande of the gatherer, they are diſſolued into ſmoke, and ashes. The tenne plagues of Aegypt were very grieuous, yet was the hart of Pharao, and of the Aegyptians, ſo hardened, that they could not repent. ſo that in ſteede of

the ſalt teares of repentance, which ſhould haue trickled downe their cheekes, to the waſhing away of their ſinnes: the redd ſea was fayne to open, &amp; to wipe away ſuch monſters, from of the face of the earth. God ouerthrewe infinite nations, before the face of his owne people (I meane the Iewes) to make away, for them into the land of promiſe. Yet forgat they all his goodnes, and benefites beſtowed vpon them. how ſhamefull a thing is it for the ſonne to diſobey his father, for the ſeruant to diſhonour his Lorde and mayſter, for the pacient to caſt of the phiſicion, for the choſen people to forſake their proper, and peculiar God? this haue the Iewes done, wherefore beholde what happened vnto them. Ioſephus writeth (bell.

The chiefe cauſe that moued them thereunto, was the cruelty of Florus.

                         This man was famous, not onely among his owne nation, but alſo among the Romaynes, ſo that at Rome, he was thought worthy the honor of a grauen picture, and the bookes which diligently he wrote, were thought worthy of the publike librarye.

The Prophetes vvhich liued after Moſes, compriſed in thirtene bookes, the famous actes of their tymes, from the death of Moſes, to Artaxerxes, vvho after the death of Xerxes, vvas king of Perſia. The other foure, containe Hymnes vnto God, and admonitions for the amendment of mans life. From Artaxerxes vnto our tymes, there are continuall bookes, yet not of ſuch creditt as the former, in ſo much there is not diligently layd dovvne a continuall ſucceſſion of the Prophets. It is very apparent, vvhat affection vve beare vnto our Scriptures, becauſe there is novv ſo much time paſt, and yet none of vs dare preſume, either to adde any thinge thereto: or to diminish anything therefro: or to alter any thinge thereof. this is engraſſed in the ſevves, from their youth vp, that they perſvvade them ſelues, this doctrine to be the vvritinges of God, and to perſeuere in the ſame, and vvillingly, if neceſſity ſo conſtrayne, to dye in the quarrell. theſe wordes I haue thought commodiouſly to haue bene by vs alleadged out of his commentaryes. this writer hath publiſhed one other, and no ſimple volume of the rule of reaſon, whiche ſome haue fathered vppon the Machabees, becauſe it contayneth the combats of the Hebrues, ſo termed in the bookes of the Machabees, manfully fighting in the defence of their pietye towardes God.

                        THey haue written that in the fiftenth yeare of Domitian, one Flauia, deſcending of the ſiſter of Flauius Clemens, which then was of the Romayne Conſuls, was exiled with many others vnto the Ile Pontia, for the teſtimony of Chriſt. When Domitian commaunded ſuch as lynealy deſcended out of Dauid to be ſlayne, the old report goeth, that certayne of this opinion, were accuſed to haue come out of the auncetors of Iudas, who was the brother of Chriſt, according vnto the fleſhe, as if by this meanes they were of the ſtocke of Dauid, and the kinſmen of Chriſt. this Aegeſippus declareth, ſaying: Cap. 20. after the greke Aegeſippus. 
                        there ſuruiued as yet certayne of the kindred of the Lorde, nephevves of Iudas, called his brother, according vnto the flesh, vvhom they brought forth, as being of the line of Dauid. theſe Iocatus doth bring before the Emperour Domitian, for he feared the comming of Chriſt, euen as Herode did, and demaunded of them, vvhether they vvere of the ſtocke of Dauid. vvhich vvhen they had acknovvledged, he demaunded againe, vvhat poſſeſſions they enioyed, and vvhat money they had. They aunſvvered: both vve haue onely ix. thouſande pence, ſo that halfe that ſumme ſufficeth either of vs, yet this ſumme haue vve not in money, but in vallovved land, contayning not aboue xxxix. acres, out of the vvhich vve pay tribute, and relieue our ſelues through our labour, and induſtry. Then shevved they him their hands, for teſtimony that they labored them ſelues, and the hardnes of their bodies, and the hard bravvne of their handes grovven by continuall labour. and vvhen as they vvere asked of Chriſt, and his
                        The kinſmē of Chriſt according vnto the fleſhe, make an accompte of their fayth, before Domitian the Emperour.

After they had thus aunſvvered, the report goeth, that Domitian condemned them not, but deſpiſed them, as vile, and baſe creatures, &amp; let them goe free, &amp; ſtayed by his edict, the perſecution then rayſed againſt the church. VVhen they vvere gone, it is ſayde, that they vvere rulers ouer Churches, in ſo much that in the ende they vvere martyres, and of the line of our Lorde, and aftervvardes peace enſuing, the report goeth, that they liued vntill the raigne of Traian.

VVhen he vvas come vnto a certayn city not farre diſtant (the name vvherof diuers doe expreſſe) and among other thinges had recreated the brethren: beholding a yong man of a goodly bodye, a gracious face, and ſeruente minde, he turned his face vnto him, that vvas appointed chiefe ouer all the Bishops, and ſayd: I commend this yonge man vnto thy cuſtody, vvith an earneſt deſire, as Chriſt, and the Churche, beare me vvitnes. VVhen he had receaued his charge, and promiſed diligence therein: he ſpake and proteſted vnto him, the ſelfe ſame, the ſecond time. Aftervvardes he returned to Epheſus. but the elder taking the yong man, that vvas deliuered vnto him, brought him vp at home, ceaſed not, cherished him ſtill, and in proceſſe of time baptized him. he came at length to be ſo diligent &amp; ſeruiceable, that he made him a liuery garment or ſcrole, ſigned vvith his maſters ſeale of Armes. but this yonge man became diſſolute out of ſeaſon, perniciouſly accompanyed him ſelfe vvith them, of his ovvne yeares, idle, diſſolute, and acquainted vvith ill behauiour. firſt they bringe him to ſumptuous banquetts: next they guyde him in the night to ſteale, and to robbe: after this they require that he conſent vnto the committing of a greater offence. but he acquainting him ſelfe by a litle, and a litle, through the greatnes of his capacitye, much like a horſe of a hardned mouth, fierce, ſtrong, and hardy, forſaking the right vvay, vvith the biting of the bridle, bringeth him ſelfe vnto a bottomleſſe pitt, of all miſorder and outrage. At length deſpayring of the ſaluation that commeth of God, being paſt all hope of grace▪ he practiſed no toye nor trifle, once being ouer the shoes, he proceeded forvvardes, and tooke the like lott vvith the reſte of his companions. takinge vnto him companions, and a rout of theues being gathered together, he became a moſt violent captayne of theeues, vvholy bent to ſlaughter, &amp; murther, &amp; extreame cruelty. In the meane vvhile, neceſſitye ſo conſtrayning, the Bishops ſent for Iohn: he vvhen he had ended, and finished the cauſe of his comming, goe to (ſayth he) O Byshop: reſtore vnto vs thy charge, vvhiche I, and Chriſt haue committed vnto thy cuſtody, the churche vvhereof thou art heade, bearing vvitnes. the Byshop at the firſt vvas amazed, ſuppoſing ſome deceite to be vvrought toutching money, vvhich he had not receaued, yet vvas he not able to aunſvvere them, for that he had it not, neyther to miſtruſt Iohn. but vvhen Iohn had ſayd: I require the yong man, and the ſoule of our brother, then the elder looking dovvne, vvith a heauy countenance, ſobbing and ſighing, ſayde: he is deade: to vvhome Iohn ſpake, hovve? and vvhat kinde of death? vvhich aunſvvered: he is dead to God. for he is become vvicked, and pernicious, and to be short, a theefe. for he keepeth this mountayne ouer againſt the church, together vvith his aſſociates. the Apoſtle then renting his garment, and beating his heade vvith greate ſorrovv, ſayde: I haue left a vviſe keeper of our brothers ſoule: prepare me a horſe, and let me haue a guyde. he haſtened out of the churche, &amp; rode in poſt, being come vnto the place appoynted, he is ſtraight vvayes taken of the theeuishe vvatch, he neither flyeth, neither reſiſteth, but exclam

It is reported that when the bookes of the three Euangeliſtes were through out the worlde, and come into his handes, he allowed them, and yelded of them a true teſtimonye, wiſhing that the declaration of ſuch thinges had bene printed in their bookes, which were done at the firſt preaching of Chriſt. the Reader may perceaue theſe three Euangeliſtes to haue onely ſett forth the doinges of our Sauiour, one yeare, after the impryſonment, and captiuitye of Iohn the Baptiſt, which may be gathered by the beginning of their hiſtories. for after the xl. dayes faſting, and the annexed temptation, Matthewe ſheweth the time ofMatth. 4. the beginning of his hiſtorye, ſaying: VVhen he had hearde that Iohn vvas taken, he returned from Iudaea into Galilee And Marke likewiſe: after that (ſayth

                        Symeon the ſonne of Cleopas, that he linealy deſcended of the ſtocke of Dauid, and that he vvas a Chriſtian. he ſuffered martyrdome being a hundreth, and tvventy yeare olde, vnder Traian the Emperour, and Atticus the Conſul.

Agayne the ſame Hiſtoriographer writeth, how that certayne others of the poſterity, of ſome one of them, called the brethren of our Lorde, namely Iude, were alyue, vntil the ſame tyme, yea after the teſtimony of them whiche vnder Domitian were tried, for the true faythe of Chriſte. for thus he writeth▪

                        How Traian cauſed to ceaſe the inquiſition for Chriſtians.
                     
                     SO greate a perſecution was rayſed agaynſt vs in ſundry places, that Plinius ſecundus a notablePlinius ſecundus wrote vnto the Emperour Traian in the behalf of the Chriſtians. Preſident, made relation thereof vnto the Emperour, being very much moued with the number of martyrs, which ſuffred death for the teſtimony of their fayth, ſignifying withall, that they committed no haynous offence, that they tranſgreſſed no law, ſauing that they roſe before day, and celebrated Chriſt with hymnes, as God. forbidding adulteryes, &amp; ſlaughter, with ſuch other like abominable factes, conforming all thinges agreable vnto the lawes. After which reporte, it is written that Traian commaunded by edicte, that the Chriſtian nation ſhoulde not be enquired for, but if happily they were founde, they ought to be puniſhed. by which edicte, the vehement heate of that greuous perſecution was ſomewhat delayed, yet neuertheleſſe, there was ſcope enough left for ſuch as were willing to afflicte vs. ſo that in one place the people, in an other place the Princes, and rulers of the regions, layde wayte for our men, whereby ſeuerall perſons, ſuffred martyrdome in their prouinces, and ſundry of the faithful, ſundry kindes of death, without open, or manifeſt perſecution. which hiſtory we haue ſelected out of the latine Apollogye of Tertullian, whereof we haue alleadged before, by interpretation thus: Although vve haue knovvne
                        Tertullian. 
                        the inquiſition directed for vs to be inhibited, it vvas by reaſon of Plinius ſecundus Preſident of the prouince, vvhich hauing condemned ſome of the Chriſtians, and depriued ſome others of their dignities, vvas moued vvith the greatnes of the multitude, and doubted vvhat vvas beſt to be done. he made the Emperour Traian priuy thereof, ſaying: that he founde nothinge in them that vvas impious, but that they refuſed the vvorshippinge of Idoles. ſignifyinge this vvithall, that the maner of the Chriſtians vvas to ryſe before daye, to celebrate Chriſte in Pſalmes as God: and to the ende their diſcipline might ſtraitly be obſerued, to forbid shedding of bloude, adultery, fraude, trayterous dealing, &amp; ſuch like. for aunſvvere hereunto, Traian vvrote againe: that there shoulde be no inquiſition for the Chriſtians, but if they vvere mett vvith, to be punished. And thus went the affayres of the Chriſtians then.

And Ignatius likewiſe vnto this daye, amongeſt moſt men famous, the ſeconde Biſhop by ſucceſſion after Peter, of the Churche of Antioch. the reporte goeth, that this Ignatius was ſent from Syria to Rome, for the confeſſion of his faith, to be foode for wilde beaſtes, who paſſing through Aſia, and curiouſly garded with a greate troope of keepers, confirmed the

congregations throughout euery citye where he came, with preaching of the worde of God, and wholſome exhortations, and ſpecially geuing charge to auoide the hereſies lately ſprong, and at that time ouerflowing, and to cleaue ſtedfaſtly vnto the traditions of the Apoſtles, which for the auoyding of error, and corruption, he thought very neceſſary to be diligently written. And being at Smyrna where Polycarpus was Biſhop, he wrote an epiſtle vnto the Church of Epheſus, making mention of Oneſimus their Paſtor. An other vnto the Church of Magneſia, lying on the riuer Meander▪
                         making mention of Dama their Biſhop. An other vnto the Church of Trallis, whoſe ouerſeer then was Polybius, and beſides theſe epiſtles, he wrote vnto the Churche of Rome, prefixing an exhortation, leſt that they refuſing martyrdome, ſhoulde be depriued of the hope layde vp for them. but it may ſeeme needefull, that we alleadg thence ſome part of the wordes for proofe hereof, for thus he writeth: Cap. 36. after the greke Ignatiꝰ epiſt. ad Rom.

And beinge beyonde Smyrna, he wrote vnto the Churches of Philadelphia, and Smyrna, and ſeuerally to Polycarpus their Biſhop, whome he knewe for a right Apoſtolike man, commending as a ſyncere and right Paſtor ought to doe, the congregation of Antioche, praying him to be carefull of the buſines there, namely about the election of a Biſhop in his rowme. this Ignatius writing vnto the Church of Smyrna, reporteth certaine wordesIgnatiꝰ epiſt. ad Smyrnenſes. vttered by Chriſt, which he founde I wott not where: I knovve and beleue that he vvas in the fleshe, after the reſurrection, for comming vnto them vvhich vvere vvith Peter, he ſayde vnto them. Come, feele me, and knovve that I am not a ſpirite vvithout body, and anone they felt him, and beleued. Irenaeus
                         alſo knewe his martyrdome, &amp; remembred his epiſtles, writing thus:Irenaeus lib. 5

And Polycarpus maketh mention hereof in the epiſtle vnderPolycarpus epiſt. ad Philip. his name vnto the Philippians, writing thus: I beſeeche you all, that you be obedient, and exerciſe patience, vvhich you haue throughly ſeene, not only in bleſſed Ignatius, Rufus, and Zoſimus, but in diuers of your ſelues, and in Paul, vvith the reſt of the Apoſtles, being perſvvaded for certaine, that all theſe ranne not in vayne, but in fayth, and righteouſnes, novve reſting them vvith the Lorde, in the place appointed, due for their deſerts, vvith vvhom they ſuffred together. they loued not this preſent vvorlde, but him that dyed for our ſinnes, and roſe agayne for our ſakes. agayne he addeth: both you, and Ignatius, vvrote vnto me, that if any did trauell vnto Syria, he might conuey thither your letters, of vvhich I vvill be careful, if fitt opportunity be offred, vvhether I my ſelfe goe, or ſend, that your buſines there, may be diſpatched. according vnto your requeſt, I haue ſent you the epiſtles of Ignatius, both vnto vs vvritten, and the others in my cuſtody, annexed vnto this epiſtle, vvhere you may gayne much profitt, they contayne fayth, and patience,

When that Antoninus ſyrnamed Pius, had ended twenty and two yeares, in the Romayne Empire: Marcus Aurelius Ʋerus, and Antoninus his ſonne, togither with Lucius his brother, ſucceeded him.

                        The martyrdome of Polycarpus, and diuers other Sainctes in Smyrna, vnder Verus the Emperour.
                     
                     WHen Aſia was viſited with greate perſecution, Polycarpus was crowned with martyrdome. I ſuppoſe it neceſſary, to penne in this our hiſtorye, his ende, which at this daye is publiſhed in writing. The Epiſtle is in the perſon of the Churche where he was Preſident, vnto the Pariſhes throughout Pontus, ſignifying the circumſtance about Polycarpus, in this ſorte:

And before they make relation of Polycarpus, they rehearſe the conſtancy, and pacience of other Martyrs, ſaying: The behoulders vvere amazed, ſeeing the flesh of the Martyrs rent vvith ſcurges, euen into the inner vaynes and ſinovves, ſo that the moſt ſecret entrayles of their bodies, their bovvels, &amp; invvard priuityes vvere piteouſly to be ſeene.

They write further, that when the ſearchers were nowe at hande, at the inſtant, and earneſt entreaty of his friendes, be fleeted thence vnto an other village, where incontinently the purſuers came, which tooke two boyes of that place, and ſcourged them vntill that one of them confeſſed the circumſtance, and ledde them vnto the lodginge of Polycarpus. When they had entred in, they founde him lying in an vpper chamber, where he might haue eſcaped, if that it had pleaſed him. But he ſayde▪ 
                        The vvill of the Lorde be fulfilled. for he vnderſtandinge of their pretence, as the reporte goeth, came downe, commoned with them pleaſantly, and chearefully, ſo that they which knewe him not before, ſtedfaſtly eyed his comely age, his graue, and conſtant countenance, marueyling that ſuch a doe was made, ſo much labour ſpent, and that a man of ſuch yeares ſhoulde be taken. He commaunded the table forthwith to be couered, meate to be layde on, requeſted them to make meary, craued of them the ſpace of one houre for prayer, that being graunted, he roſe vp, went to prayer, ſo repleniſhed with the grace of God, that ſuch as were preſent, and prayed, hearing his deuotion, were rauiſhed, and many ſorowed, that ſo honeſt, and godly a father, ſhoulde dye. After theſe thinges the Epiſtle contayneth in manner theſe wordes following:

There mett him Herode the iuſtice of peace, and his father Nicetes, vvho receauing him into their chariott, perſvvaded him, ſaying: VVhat harme is it to ſaye: Lorde Caeſar, to ſacrifice and ſo be ſaued? at the firſte he aunſvvered nothinge, but vvhen they vrged him, he ſayde: I vvill not condeſcende vnto your counſayle, they perceauing he vvoulde not be perſvvaded, gaue him very roughe language, and tumbled him dovvne out of the vvaggon, to the bruſing of his shinnes. But he as thoughe he had bene nothinge hurte, neyther iniuried at all, vvent bolte vprighte, chearefull, and apace tovvardes the Theatre. VVhen he vvas come vppon the Theatre or ſtage, a voyce came dovvne from heauen (vvhiche by reaſon of the greate tumulte vvas hearde of fevve) Be of good cheare ô Polycarpus, and play the man. The ſpeaker no man ſavve, but the voyce vvas hearde of many of vs. In the meane tyme the multitude vvas in a rage, ſeeing Polycarpus brought forthe. The Proconſul demaundeth of him, vvhether he vvere that Polycarpus, beckning that he shoulde denye it, and ſaying: tender thine yeares, vvith ſuch like perſvvaſions, ſvveare by the fortune of Caeſar, repent thee of that is paſt, ſay, remoue the vvicked. But Polycarpus behoulding vvith vnmoueable countenance, the multitude rounde about the ſtage, poynting vvith the hande, and ſighing, and looking vp vnto heauen, ſayde: remoue ô Lorde the vvicked. VVhen the Proconſul vrged, and ſayd: ſvveare, and I vvill let thee goe: Blaſpheme, and defie Chriſt, Polycarpus aunſvvered: foure ſcore, and ſixe yeares, haue I ſerued him, neyther hath he euer offended me in any thinge, and hovv can I reuile my Kinge, vvhich hath thus kept mee? The Proconſul ſtill vrged, and ſayde: ſvveare by the fortune of Caeſar. To vvhome Polycarpus: If thou requireſt this vayne glorye, that I proteſt the fortune of Caeſar, as thou ſayeſt, fayning thou knovveſt me not, Here freely I am a Chriſtian. If thou deſyre to knovve the doctrine of Chriſtianitie, apoynte the daye, and thou shalt heare. VVhen the Proconſul ſayd, perſvvade this people, Polycarpus aunſvvered: I haue voutchſafed to conferre vvith thee. For vve are commaunded to giue to Princes, and Potentates their due honour, ordained of God, nether preiudiciall to our religion, but as for this furious multitude, I vvill not deale vvith them. I iudge them vnvvorthy hearers of my purgation. To this the Proconſul ſayde: I haue vvilde
                                 beaſtes to deuoure thee, vnleſſe thou take a better vvaye. Polycarpus aunſvvered: bring them forthe, for it is determined amongeſt vs, not to paſſe from the better vnto the vvorſe by repentance: But vve recount it a thinge commendable, to turne from the thinge that is euill, to that vvhich is good and iuſte. Agayne the Proconſul ſayd: I vvill ſtyll thee vvith fire, if thou vvaye not the beaſtes, neyther repent. VVhome Polycarpus aunſvvered: Thou threatneſt fyre for an houre, vvhich laſteth a vvhyle, and quickly is quenched, but thou art ignorant of the euerlaſting fyre, at the day of iudgement, and endleſſe torments reſerued for the vvicked. But vvhat lingereſt thou, diſpatche as it pleaſeth thee. Vttering theſe, and the like vvordes, he vvas conſtant, and chearful, his countenance ſo gracious, that he notvvithſtanding vvas nothing moued thervvith, but of the contrary the Proconſul being amazed, commaunded the bedle, in the middeſt of the theatre, thryſe to cry: Polycarpus confeſſeth him ſelf a Chriſtian. At vvhich ſaying, the multitude both of Ievves, and Gentiles, inhabiting Smyrna, shouted vvith a great rage: this is that Doctor of Aſia, the father of the Chriſtians, the ouerthrovver of our Gods, vvho inſtructed many, that our Gods are not to be adored. To this they added an other clamor, crauing of Philip Preſident of Aſia, that he vvoulde lett looſe a lyon to deuoure him, vvho aunſvvered: That this vvas not lavvefull, in ſo much that the game or ſtage ſtryuing of beaſtes vvas then finished. Then they cryed vvith one voyce that Polycarpus shoulde be burned quicke. It behoued that the viſion shoulde be fulfilled vvhiche he ſavve on his pillovve, and prophecyed of, to ſuch as prayed vvith him at that preſent, ſayinge: I muſt be burned quicke, vvhiche vvas as ſoone done as ſpoken. For the multitude forthvvith caryed logges of vvoode, and ſtickes out of their shoppes, and bathes. but ſpecially the Ievves, ſerued promptly (after their vvonted manner) for that purpoſe. The fyery pyle being prepared, he vnapparelled him ſelfe, looſed his girdle, endeuored to pull of his shoes, vvhich before he did not, for that the faythfull contended among them ſelues vvho coulde ſooneſt touch his bodye, at their farevvell. for his good, and godly conuerſation, yea, before his graye heare grevve, he vvas honoured of all men. In a shorte vvhyle all thinges neceſſarily required for the execution, vvere applyed. And vvhen as they vvoulde haue nayled him to the ſtake, he ſayde: naye ſuffer me euen as I am. For he that gaue me pacience to abyde this fyre, vvill geue me alſo an immoueable mynde, to perſeuer vvithin this fyery pyle, vvithout your prouiſion, in pryntinge my bodye vvith nayles. VVhen they had hearde that, they ceaſe from naylinge, and fall a byndinge of him. His handes then being bounde to his backe, he like a notable ramme, picked out of a greate flocke, fitte for an acceptable burnte ſacrifice vnto Almightye God, is offered, ſaying: O Father of thy vvelbeloued, and bleſſed ſonne Ieſus Chriſt, through vvhome vve haue knovvne

The flame vehemently flashed about, terrible to the ſight, shevved no doubt of purpoſe to ſuche as vvere preſerued to publishe the ſame to the poſteritie. For the flamye fire, framing it ſelfe after the forme of a vault, or the ſayle of a shippe, vvith the bluſtring blaſtes of vvinde, compaſſed the filling bodye of the Martyr vvithin placed, as vvith a vval, and that vvhich vvas in the middes of the ſame, vvas not as firye, skorched, or burned fleshe, but as golde or ſiluer tryed in the fornace. For it ſeemed to our ſenſes, a fragrant, &amp; ſvveete ſmell, as of frankenſenſe, or ſome ſuch like precious perfume. At length vvhen the cruel perſecutors perceaued the fire not to conſume his body, they called for a tormē

But the enuiouſe, ſubtle and maliciouſe aduerſarye of iuſt men, ſeeinge the glorye of this Martyr ſo greate, and his vnblamable conuerſation from the beginninge to be crovvned vvith incorruption, and to receaue an incomparable revvarde: procured that his bodye should perishe from amonge vs, for there vvere manye that endeuored and fullye purpoſed to haue bene partakers of his bleſſed bodye by buriall, many pricked forvvardes Nicetes, the father of Herode, and his brother Dalces, to moue the proconſull, not to deliuer vnto the Chriſtians his body leaſt that (ſayth he) they leauinge Chriſt, fall a vvorshippinge of him. This they ſayd, vvhen the Ievves egged, and vrged them forevvardes, vvhich continually vvatched vs leaſt that vvee ſnatched him out of the fyre, beinge ignorant of this, that vve can neuer forſake Chriſt, vvhich dyed for the ſaluation of the vvhole vvorlde: that vve can vvorshippe none other. for vve vvorshippe Chriſt The Chriſtians worſhip God &amp; reuerē ce his Martyrs. as the ſonne of God, the Martyrs vve loue, as diſciples, and follovvers of the Lorde, and that vvorthely for the inuincible good loue they beare, to their Kinge, and maiſter, vvhoſe companions and diſciples vve deſire to be. vvhen the Centurion perceaued the ſedition of the levves he cauſed the body to be layd in the middes after theyr accuſtomed manner, to be burned.

                     AT that time Iuſtinus of whome we made mention before, when he had dedicated a booke in the defence of our doctrine, to the foreſayd Emperours was crowned with martyrdome by the maliciouſe meanes of Creſcens the philoſpher, profeſſing in life and learninge the ſect of Cynickes, for Iuſtinus in open diſputations, and publicke conference had with this philoſopher, bare away the bell which tended to the ſhortning of his life, and the haſteninge of his ende. This thinge did this famous philoſopher in his foreſayd Apologie foreſee and ſignifie in theſe words. I looke for no other thinge then this, but that I be betrayed of ſome one of thē called philoſophersIuſtinus martyr Apolog. 2., or knockt in the head vvith a clubbe by Creſcens, no philoſopher in deed, but a ſtately iangler.

No mans fonde, vayne, or foolish humor vvith flatterye to be fedde. Thus farre Iuſtinus. And that he periſhed through the practiſe of Creſcens, Tatianus a man inſtructed from his youth vp in prophane literature, and prayſed very much for the profit he tooke therein, teſtifleth in his booke againſt the Gentiles wryting thus: The famous philoſopher Iuſtinus ſayd very vvell, that the

                     THe ſame Iuſtinus before he ſuffred, remembred in his Apologie, ſuch as were martyred before him, very pertinent for this our purpoſe, wryting thus: A certain vvoman there
                        Iuſtinus in his Apology reporteth a certain hiſtory of a mā &amp; his vvife. vvas maryed vnto an husbande vvholy giuen vnto laſciuious life and leudnes, vvhereunto she hir ſelf vvas in times paſt addicted, vvho vvhen she had learned the doctrine of Chriſt repented hir of hir former life, and embraced chaſtitie, and exhorted hir husbande likvviſe to repēt, expounding vnto him the doctrine vvhich threatned vnto intemperate, and beaſtly liuers euerlaſting punishment, of endleſſe fyre. But he neuertheleſſe altogether ſet vpō the ſame levvd neſſe, ſeparateth by his vnlavvfull meanes his vvife from him. for she ſayd that it vvas thenceforth vnlavvfull for hir, to vſe company at bedd, and at borde, vvith that man, vvho contrarie vnto the lavve of nature, beyonde all right and reaſon, ſought meanes to ſatiſfie his filthy luſte and therefore vvould be diuorced from him. But through the perſvvaſions of her frends, she reuoked hir ſentence, &amp; changed hir mind, vvho counſayled hir, a litle vvhile quietly to liue together that there vvas great hope at length of his repentance: refrained hir ſelf and continevved vvith him in vvedlocke. VVhen hir husbande vvas gonne to Alexandria, and there knovven to haue practiſed farre more levvd factes, leaſt that she should be made partaker of his vvicked factes and haynous offences by continevving in his company at bedd and boord, in the bonde of matrimony: she made a bill of diuorce (as vve tearme it) she vvas ſeparated and vvent avvay from him. Then this good man (vvhen he shoulde haue reioyced that his vvife vvhichIronia. 
                        of olde vvas ſlaundered of hir ſeruantes and accuſed of hir levvdneſſe: vvhich of olde vvas giuen to dronkenneſſe, and all kinde of ſpite: novve had renounced hir former life, and exhorted him to the ſame repentance vvith hir, vvhome she diuorced becauſe he kept other company) accuſed hir that she vvas a Chriſtian. And she gaue vp a ſupplication vnto thee (ô Emperour) humbly requeſting, that she might firſt diſpoſe hir houſehould affaires, &amp; after the diſpoſition and ordering thereof, to aunſvvere vnto that vvhich she vvas accuſed for, the vvhich thing thou diddeſt graciouſly graūt, but he (hir husband ſomtimes) hauing no colour, nor cloke, to accuſe his vvife: bent his bovve and leueled thus at Ptolomaeus, vvho inſtructed hir in the Chriſtian fayth, &amp; endured tormēts vnder Vrbicius the Iudge. He had to his frend the Centurion, vvhom he perſvvaded to impryſon Ptolomaeus: to entreat him roughly vvithall: &amp; to demaund of him if he vvere a Chriſtiā. vvhich vvhen Ptolomaeus, one that vvas zealous for the trueth, no flatterer, no diſſembler,
                        Ptolomaeus martyred. 
                        had confeſſed himſelfe to be: the Centurion caſt him into pryſon vvhere he vvas longe
                        
                        punished. Aftervvardes being brought before Vrbicius, of this onely he vvas examined: if he vvere a Chriſtian, vvhoſe conſcience bearing him vvitneſſe of no crime, but in a iuſt cauſe: confeſſed that he had preached the true, and heauenly doctrine of Chriſt. For he vvhich denyeth himſelfe to be that man he is, either condemneth that vvhich is in him by denyall: or knovving him vnvvorthy and eſtranged from the matter, refuſeth to confeſſe: vvhere of neither is found in a true Chriſtian. And vvhen Vrbicius commaunded that he should be brought forth: one Lucius (that vvas alſo a Chriſtian) ſeing the ſentence giuen contrary to all reaſon, ſayde to Vrbicius VVhat reaſon is it (O Vrbicius) that thou shouldeſt condemne this man for confeſſing the name of Chriſt: vvhich hathe committed neither adultery: neither fornication: neither manſlaughter, neither theft: neither robbery: neither any vvicked offence, that he may iuſtly be charged vvithall. Thy Iudiciall ſentences do become neither Pius the Emperour: neither the philoſopher the ſonne of Caeſar: neither the ſacred Senate. Vrbicius aunſvvering nothing to theſe thinges ſayde to Lucius: and thou ſeemeſt to me, to be ſuch a one. Lucius aunſvvered: I am ſo, and he commaunded him forthvvith to be brought forth to the place of executiō. For this, Lucius thanked
                        Lucius martyred. 
                        him, &amp; ſayd that by this meanes he should be deliuered, from ſuch vvicked mayſters, &amp; go vnto a gracious God, his father, and King. After this a third ſtept forth vvhich ſuffred the like. In the end Iuſtinus concludeth with y• reherſall of that which we remembred before, ſaying: And I looke for no other, then that I be betrayed by ſome one of them, that are called philoſophers.

                         In his booke of Eaſter he declareth the time when he wrote it, begining thus: In the time of Seruilius Paulus proconſul of Aſia, vvhat time Sagaris ſuffred martyrdome, and the great ſturre vvas moued at Laodicea, tourchinge the
                        Melito in his booke of Eaſter. Sagaris martyred. Apece of the Apologie of Melito vnto the Emperour. 
                        Sabaoth, vvhich then by reaſon of the time fell out, theſe thinges vvere vvrytten of this booke Clemens Alexandrinus made mention, in a ſeuerall tracte which he wrote of Eaſter, and purpoſely (as he teſtifieth himſelfe) by occaſion of Melito his booke. In his Apology vnto the Emperour he reporteth the thinges practiſed againſt the Chriſtians, wryting thus: The godly people grened, by reaſon of nevve edictes, published throughout Aſia and before neuer practiſed: novve ſuffer perſecution. for impudent Sycophantes, &amp; greedy gapers after other mens goods, hauing gotten occaſion through thoſe proclamations: openly robb and ſpoile, day and night, ſuch as committee no treſpaſſe at all. And after a fewe lynes he ſayth: If this be done through your procuremēt, let it ſtand for good. for the Emperour that is iuſte, neuer putteth in practiſe any vniuſt thing, &amp; vve vvillingly vvill beare avvay the honor of this death, yet this onely vve hūbly craue of your highnes, that you (after notice and tryall had of the authors of this contention) doe iuſtly geue ſentence, vvhether they are vvorthy of death &amp; punishment, or of lif and quietneſſe. but if this be not your maieſties pleaſure, and the nevve edicte proceed not from your povver and authoritie, (vvhich vvere not ſeemely to be ſett forthe agaynſt barbarian enemies) the rather vve pray you, that you deſpiſe vs not, vvhich are greued and oppreſſed, vvith this common
                        
                        and shamefull ſpoyle. Agayne to theſe he addeth: The philoſophie novve in aeſtimation amongeſt
                        Chriſtian religion began to be made manifeſt in the time of Auguſtus, for then Chriſt was borne. 
                        vs, firſt florished among the Barbarians. for vvhen as it florished vnder the great dominion of Auguſtus, your forefather of famous memorie, it fell out to be a moſt fortunate ſucceſſe vnto your empire. For thence forvvardes vnto this daye, the Romaine empire increaſed and enlarged it ſelfe vvith greate glorie, vvhoſe ſucceſſor novve you are, greatly beloued: and haue bene long vvished for: and vvilbe together vvith your ſonne continually prayed for. retaine therefore this religion, vvhich encreaſed vvith the empire, vvhich began vvith Auguſtus, vvhich vvas reuerenced of your auncetors, before all other religions. This vvas a greate argument of a good beginning, for ſince that our doctrine florished together vvith the happie beginning empire: no miſfortune befell vnto it from the raygne of Auguſtus vnto this daye: but of the contrary all proſperous, and gloriouſe, and gladſome, as euery man vvished him ſelfe. Onely of all others Nero, &amp; Domitian, through the perſvvaſion of certaine enuious, &amp; diſpitefull perſons: vvere diſpoſed to bring our doctrine into hatred. From vvhome this ſclaunder of flattering perſons, raiſed againſt the Chriſtians ſprong vp, after a brutishe maner or cuſtome. but your godly auncetors corrected their blinde ignorance, and rebuked oftentimes by their epiſtles, their ſundry rashe enterpriſes. Of vvhich number Adrianus your graundefather, is knovven to haue vvritten both vnto Fundanus Proconſul, and Preſident of Aſia, and to manie others. And your father (yours, I ſaye, in that you gouerned all thinges together vvith him) vvrote vnto the cities in our behalfe, and vnto the Lariſſaeans, Theſſalonians, Athenians, and to all the Grecians: that they should innouate nothing, nether practiſe any thing preiudiciall vnto the Chriſtians. but of you vve are fully perſvvaded to obtaine our humble petitions, in that your opinion, and ſentence is correſpondent vnto that of your predeceſſors, yea and that more gracious, and farre more religious. Thus as ye reade, he wrote in the aforeſayde booke. And in his Proeme to his annotations of the olde Teſtamente, he reciteth the cataloge of the bookes of the olde Teſtament, then certeine &amp; canonicall (the whiche neceſſarilie we haue annexed) writinge thus: Meliton vnto the brother Oneſimus ſendeth greeting:
                        
                        Melito writeth vnto Oneſimus of the canonical Scripture of the olde teſtament. 
                        VVhereas oftentimes (you beinge inflamed vvith earneſt zeale tovvardes our doctrine) haue requeſted of me, to ſelect certaine annotations out of the lavve and prophets, concerning our Sauiour, and our vvhole religion: and againe to certifie you of the ſumme of the bookes, contained in the olde teſtament, according vnto their number, and order of placinge: novve at length I (beinge mindefull heretofore alſo of your petitions) haue bene carefull to performe that you looke for, knovving your endeuer, your care and induſtrie in ſetting forth the doctrine of faith, marching forvvards vvith loue tovvards God, and care of euerlaſting ſaluation, vvhich you preferre before all other thinges. VVhen that I traueled into the eaſt and vvas there, vvhere theſe thinges vvere both preached and put in practiſe: I compiled into order the bookes of the olde teſtament, ſuche as vvere vvell knovven, and ſent them vnto you, vvhoſe names are theſe: The fiue bookes of Moſes: Geneſis, Exodus, Leuiticus, Numeri, Deuteronomium. Then Ieſus Naue, the Iudges, the booke of Ruth, foure bookes of kinges, tvvo of Cronicles, the Pſalmes of Dauid, the Prouerbes of Solomon, the booke of VViſdome, Eccleſiaſtes, the Canticles, Iob, Eſay, and Ieremie the Prophets. on booke of the tvvelue prophets, Daniel, Ezechiel, Eſdras. vpon the vvhich vve haue vvritten ſix bookes of commentaries. Thus farre Meliton.

The meane tyme paſſing betvvene, vvas neither vayne, nor fruteleſſe, for the infinite mercy of Chriſt Ieſus our Sauiour, shined in the vvorlde, through their pacience. the deade by the liuing vvere reuiued: the martyrs profited ſuch as vvere no martyrs: the pure virgine, and mother the Churche, vvas greatly comforted, and cherished, vvhen as she recouered and receaued for liuing, ſuch as

They ſeuerally vvere examined, to be ſet at liberty, but after confeſſion they vvere coopled to the number of the martyrs. They taried vvithout vvhich neuer had grayne of fayth, no feeling of the vvedding garment, no ſparckle of the feare of God, but rather through their vvicked conuerſation blaſphemed the vvay of God, as ſonnes of perdition.

VVhen the Preſident had vrged him, and demaunded of him vvhat he vvas, he anſvvered: I am a Chriſtian. for vvhich anſvvere the Preſident allotted him vnto the beaſtes, of them I ſay to be rent in peeces and deuoured.

                        a great vvhile agoe (vvelbeloued Auircus Marcellus) ſince thou diddeſt enioyne me this taske▪ that I should publish ſome booke againſt the follovvers of the hereticke Miltiades, vvherupon I doubted vnto this day, vvhat vvas beſt to be done. not but that I vvas able to confute their falſehoode, and geue teſtimony vnto the trueth: but that I feared greatly, leſt by vvriting, I shoulde adde ſomething vnto the perfect vvordes of the nevv teſtament. vvhereto nothing may be added, and vvherefro nothing may be taken avvay, by him, that vvill leade a life agreeable to the Goſpell. I being of late at Ancyra in Galatia, founde the Churche throughout Pontus, filled, not vvith Prophets, (as they call them) but rather, as it shall be proued, vvith falſe Prophets: vvhere through the Lorde, as much as in me laye, I diſputed in the Churche, the ſpace of many

When he had written theſe thinges, in the beginning, and throughout his firſt booke reprehended their error: in his ſeconde booke he writeth thus of their endes: becauſe they charge vs with the deathe of the Prophets, for that vve receaue not their diſordered fantaſies (theſe ſaye they are the Prophets vvhiche the Lorde promyſed to ſende his people) let them aunſvvere me, I charge them in the

                        Montanus &amp; Maximilla hanged them ſelues. 
                        both theſe, throughe the motion of their madde ſpirit, not together at one tyme, but at ſeuerall tymes, hanged them ſelues, and ſo ended their lyues, after the manner of Indas the traytour. euen as the common reporte goeth of Theodotus, that iolly fellovve, the firſt founder
                        Theodotus the hereticke flying vp, broke his necke.

Agayne he writeth in the ſame booke, howe that the holy Biſhops, going about to rebuke the ſpirite, which ſpake in Maximilla were hindered by others, that wrought with the ſame ſpirite, ſayinge as followeth: let not the ſpirite of Maximilla ſaye as it is in the Epiſtle to Asterius Ʋrbanus: I am chaced as a vvolfe from the sheepe. I am no vvolfe. I am the vvorde, the ſpirite, and povver: but let him manifeſtly expreſſe that povver, by the ſpirite, and preuayle. let him compell ſuch men as then vvere preſent to trye, and conferre vvith that talkatyue ſpirite. namely theſe vvorthy men and Bishops: Zoticus of Comanum, and Iulian of Apamia: to confeſſe the ſame. vvhoſe mouthes vvhen the companions of Themiſon had ſtopped, they ſuffered not the lying ſpirite, and ſeducer of the people to be rebuked. In the ſame booke after he had layde downe other thinges to the confutation of Maximilla his falſe prophecyes, he declareth with all, the tyme when he wrote, and their prophecyes foreſhewing warres and ſedicions, whoſe fonde fantaſies he confuteth in this ſorte: And hovv can it othervviſe fall out but that this be

                        vvhich confute the booke of Alcibiades, vvhere he declareth that it is not the property of a Prophet, to prophecye in a traunce. a litle after he rehearſeth the Prophets of the newe Teſtament, among whome he numbreth one Ammias, and Quadratus, ſaying as followeth: A falſe Prophet in a traunce, vvhere licence, and impunitie doe concurre, beginneth vvith rashe ignoraunce, &amp; endeth vvith furious rage and frenſie of mind, as it is ſayd before. of this ſort, &amp; in ſuch

                         Againe he wryteth: If that as they ſay, after Quadratus, and Ammias the Philadelphian, theſe vvomen of Montanus, ſucceeded in the gift of prophecy: lett them shevve vvho aftervvardes ſucceeded Montanus, and his vvomen. for the Apoſtle thinketh good, that the gift of prophecie should raigne in euery Church, euen vnto the ende, but novve for the ſpace of theſe fouretene yeares, ſince Maximilla dyed, they are able to shevve vs not one. ſo farre he. this Militiades whome he remembreth, leaft vnto vs in wryting other monumentesMiltiades bookes. of his laboure, and induſtrie, in the holy Scriptures: aſwell in the bookes he wrote agaynſt the Gentiles as alſo in the books agaynſt the Ievves. ſatisfieng &amp; confuting in two books their ſeuerall argumentes, and opinions. afterwardes he wrote an Apologie of the Chriſtian philoſophie, which he embraced vnto the potentates and princes of this world.

                     TO be briefe this Phrygian hereſie was confuted by Apollonius an eccleſiaſticall writer who then (I ſaye at that time) floriſhed in Phrygia: he publiſhed a ſeuerall booke againſt it, he refuted their prophecyes, accompting them for vayne lyes: he plainely opened and reuealed the conuerſation of ſuch as were principall and chief patrons of this hereſie of Montanus, he wrote in this manner: But vvhat kinde of nevve Doctor this is, his vvorkes and doctrine
                        Apollonius againſt the Montaniſtes. 
                        doe declare. This is he vvhich taught the breakinge of vvedlocke: this is he vvhich preſcribed lavves of faſtinge: this is he vvhich called Pepuza and Timium (peltinge parishes of Phrygia) Ieruſalem, to the ende he might entice all men from euery vvhere to frequent thither. this is he vvhich ordayned tolegatherers &amp; taxers of money▪ this is he vvhich vnder pretenſe and colour of oblations, hath conningely inuented the arte of bribinge: this is he vvhich giueth greate hyre vnto the preachers of his doctrine, that by feedinge of the panche his prophecies may preuaile. Thus much of Montanus, and immediatly of his Prophetiſſes he wryteth: VVe haue shevved before, theſe firſt prophetiſſes, from the time they vvere filled vvith theyr falſe ſpirite, to haue forſaken theyr husbandes, hovve shamefully then do they lye calling Priſcilla a virgin? He addeth ſayinge: Doth not the-vvhole Scripture forbydde, that a prophete
                        The prophetiſſes of Mon tanus receaue gifts. Themiſon a montaniſt with money deliuered himſelf from pryſon. 
                        shoulde receaue revvardes, and money? VVhen I ſee a prophetiſſe receaue golde and ſiluer, and precious garmentes, hovve can I chuſe but deteſt her? Agayne of an other he ſayth: And beſides theſe, Themiſon alſo inflammed vvith the burninge thurſt of couetouſneſſe, taſted not of the tarte conyzance of confeſſion, before the tyrant, but shifted himſelf out of fetteres, vvith much money. And vvhen as therefore he shoulde haue humbled himſelfe, yet he all in braggery, as if he vvere a martyr after the example of the Apoſtle vvrote a catholicke epiſtle, very preſumptuouſly, to enſtructe them vvhich beleued better then he did, and to exhort them to ſtriue for the nevve doctrine together vvith him, and to reuile the Lorde, and his Apoſtles, and his holy Churche. Againe ſpeakinge of one of theyr highlye eſteemed Martyrs he wryteth in this ſorte: And that vve trouble not our ſelues vvith many, lett the prophetiſſe tell vs toutchinge Alexander, vvho called himſelfe a Martyre: vvith vvhome she hathe banqueted:

They that vvill knovve further of his offences, I referre them vnto publicke recordes▪ for by confutinge him, vvhome the prophete hathe not knovven by dvvellinge together many yeares, vve declare vnto the vvorlde by him the ſtedfaſtneſſe of the prophete. VVe are able to shevve at large the conformity of bothe partes. But if they haue any confident perſeuerance, lett them beare the reprehenſion. Agayne in an other place of the ſame booke, he wryteth of theyr Prophetes thus: If they deny theyre Prophetes to haue bene bribers, lett them affirme it condicionally that if it be proued: they be no longer Prophetes. hereof vve are able to alleadge many particular proufes. all the vvorkes of a Prophete are neceſſarily to be proued. tell me (I beſeche you) is it ſeemely for a Prophete to paynte himſelfe in coloures? is it ſeemly for a Prophete to ſmothe himſelfe vvith the vvhite gliſteringe ſtibium? is it ſeemly for a Prophete neatly to pyncke and gingerly to ſett forthe himſelfe? is it ſeemely for a Prophete to diſe and to carde? is it ſeemely for a Prophete to be an vſurer? let them anſvvere me vvhether theſe be lavvefull, or vnlavvefull. I vvill proue theſe to be theyre practiſes. This Apollonius in the ſame booke ſheweth the time of his wryttinge, to be the fortyeth yeare ſince Montanus inuented this falſe, and forged prophecy. Agayne he declareth howe that Zoticus (mentioned before by the former Author) went about at Pepuza, to reprehende, and confute the fayned prophecy of Maximilla, and the ſpirite which wrought in her: but yet was forbidd by ſuch as fauored her folly. he remembreth one Thraſeas a martyr of that time. This tradition firſt is to be ſuſpected for that chriſt (Matth. 28. Marc. 16.) commaūded the Apoſtles to paſſe throughout the worlde &amp; to preache the Goſpell. ſecondly for that he charged them (Luc. 24. Act. 1.) to tary in Ieruſalem but vntill they were endued with power from an high which was fifty dayes after the aſcention. Cap. 19. after the Greeke. he declareth as receaued by tradition, that the Lorde commaunded his Apoſtles not to departe from Ieruſalem vntill the twelfe yeares ende. he alleageth teſtimonyes out of the Reuelation, and reporteth howe that Sainct Iohn rayſed at Epheſus, by the deuine power of God, one that was deade to life againe. other thinges he wryteth by the which he hath fully confuted, and ouerthrowen the ſubtle ſleighte of the foreſayed hereſie, theſe thinges of Apollonius.

                        I charge thee in the name of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, and his glorious comminge, at vvhat time he shall come to iudge the quicke and the dead, vvho ſo euer thou be that copieſt this booke: that thou peruſe this copie, and diligently correcte it after the example of my ovvne hande vvrytinge, and that thou putt to likevviſe this charge and ſett it dovvne after the vvrytten copye.

Florinus a courtier then a ſchiſmatick laſt an hereticke. ſayinge: This doctrine (O Florinus) if I may boldly pronounce the trueth, ſauoreth not for ſounde: this doctrine diſagreeth from the Churche, and bringeth ſuch as geue care vnto it into extreme impietie: this doctrine no, not the heretickes vvhich vvere out of the Church, euer durſte to publishe: this doctrine ſuch as vvere elders before vs, and diſciples of the Apoſtles, neuer deliuered vnto thee.

For I remember better the thinges of oulde then the affayres of late.

                     IMmediately vpon this, Victor Biſhope of Rome, goeth aboute to ſeuer from the vnitie in the communion, all the churches of Aſia together with the adioyning congregations, as ſauoring not aright, and iuueyeth againſte them in his epiſtles, &amp; pronounceth flattly, all the brethren there for excōmunicated perſons. but this pleaſed not al the biſhops, for they exhorted him to ſeke after thoſe thinges which concerned peace, and vnitie, and loue betwene brethren. Ca. 26. after the Greeke. where then was the ſaying that the biſhope of Rome muſte iudge all and be iudged of none? Irenaeus biſhop of Liōs. Victor biſhop of Rome. Their words are at this daye extant that ſharpely reprehended 
                           Ʋictor, of which number, Irenaeus, in the name of all the brethren in Fraunce that were vnder his charge, wrote and allowed the ſame ſentence, to wete: The myſterie of the reſurrection of our Sauiour to be celebrated on the ſondaye onely. Yet as it was very meete he put him in remembrance at large of his dutie that he ſhoulde not eſtraynge or cut of all the churches of God, whiche retayned the tradition of olde cuſtome. his wordes are theſe: Nether is this controuerſie onely of the daye, but alſo of the kinde or maner of faſting. Some thinke they ought to faſte one daye, ſome tvvo, ſome more, ſome fortie, and telling the houres throughout day and nyght they counte a daye. nether beganne this varietie of faſtinge in our tyme, but longe before, through them vvho then bare rule, and as it is very likelye, through their double negligence, they deſpiſed and altered the ſimple and common cuſtome retayned of olde. yet for all this vvere they at vnitie one vvith an other, and as yet vve retayne it, for this varietie of faſtinge commendeth the vnitie of fayth. After this he adioyneth a certeine hiſtorie, whiche I will alleage as peculierly incident to this place▪ 
                        They (ſayeth he) that vvere bishops before Soter, of that ſea vvhich novve thou gouerneſt, I meane▪ 
                           Anicetus, Pius, Hyginus, Telesphorus and Xyſtus, nether did they ſo obſerue it them ſelues, nether did they publishe anye ſuche preſident vnto the poſteritie, &amp; for all that, they (though not obſeruing the ſame cuſtome) vvere at vnitie neuertheleſſe vvith them, vvhich reſorted vnto them from other churches, and did not obſerue the ſame, although their obſeruation vvas contrary to the mindes of ſuche as obſerued it not. nether vvas the like euer heard of, that any man, for ſuche kind of faſting vvas excō
                           municated. yea the bishopes them ſelues vvhich vvere thy predeceſſours, haue ſent the Euchariſt vnto the brethren of other churches, that obſerued a contrary cuſtome. And Polycarpus beinge
                        
                        at Rome, in the tyme of Anicetus, they both varied among them ſelues about trifling matters, yet vvere they ſoone recōciled, &amp; not a vvord of this matter. Neither vvas Anicetus able to perſvvade Polycarpus that he should not retaine that, vvhich he had alvvaies obſerued, vvith Iohn the diſciple of our Lord, &amp; the reſt of the Apoſtles, vvith vvhome he had bene cōuerſant: neither did Polycarpus perſvvade Anicetus, to obſerue it, but told him, that he ought to obſerue the aunciēt cuſtome of the elders, vvhome he ſucceeded. Theſe thinges being at this poynt, they cōmunicated one vvith an other. &amp; in the churche
                        Ruffinus trāſlatīg theſe wordes vnderſtandeth that Anicetus graunted the miniſtratiō of the cō
                           munion vnto Polycarpus, which is very like to be true. Irenaeus ſignifieth a peace maker. 
                        Anicetus graunted the Euchariſt vnto Polycarpus, for reuerēce he ovved vnto him. in the end they parted, one from an other in peace. and al ſuch as retayned cōtrary obſeruations throughout the vvhole vniuerſal churche, held faſte the bonde of loue &amp; vnitie.
                         Thus Irenaeus not degenerating from the etymologie of his name, paſſing all other in ye gyft of reconciling the brethren practiſed for the eccleſiaſticall peace. he wrote not only to Victor, but alſo to ſundrye gouernours of diuers other churches, in ſeuerall epiſtles, concerninge the ſayde controuerſie.

The ſame author which wrote the aforeſaid booke againſt the founder of this hereſie, declareth a certeine hiſtorie that was done in the time of Zepherinus after this maner. Therfore to the ende I may aduertiſe diuerſe of the brethren, I vvil rehearſe a certaine hiſtorie of our time, vvhiche as I ſuppoſe if it had bene in Sodome, they vvold haue fallen to repentāce. There vvas one Natalius, vvho not lōg before, but euē in our time becam a cōfeſſor. this Natalius vvas on a tyme ſeduced by Aſclepiodotus, &amp; an other Theodotus an exchaūger, they both vvere diſciples of Theodotus the tāner, vvho thē being author of this blaſphemous opiniō (as I ſayd before) vvas excōmunicated by Victor bishop of Rome. for Natalius vvas perſvvaded by thē for a certeine hire, &amp; revvarde, to be called a bishop of this heretical opiniō, to vvete: a hūdreth &amp; fifty pēce, monethly to be payd him. Novv he being thus linked vnto thē, the Lord vvarned him oft by viſions. for God and our Lord Ieſus Chriſt full of mercy &amp; compaſſion, vvold not that the vvitneſſe of his paſſiōs, should perishe vvithout the churche. &amp; for that he vvas altogether careleſſe, &amp; negligēt in marking the viſions frō aboue being novv as it vvere hooked vvith the ſvveete baites of primacie, &amp; honour, &amp; filthy lucre, vvherby thouſands do perishe: at lēgth he vvas ſcurged by an Angel of the Lord.
                        God ſendeth his Angell to ſcourge by night. 
                        &amp; for the ſpace of a vvhole nyght chaſticed not a little, ſo that vvhen he roſe earely in the morning couered in ſackcloth, &amp; ſprinckled in ashes, vvith much vvoe, &amp; many teares, he fel dovvn flatte before the feete of Zephyrinus bishope of Rome, not after the manner of a cleargie man, but of the laye people, beſeaching the churche (prone alvvayes to compaſſion) vvith vvatrishe eyes, and vvette cheekes, for the mercie of Chriſt, to tender and pitie his miſerable caſe, ſo that vſinge many petitions, and shevvinge in his bodie the printe of the plaguye ſtripes, after muche adoe he vvas receaued vnto the communion. We thinke beſt to adde vnto theſe other relations of the ſame author, for thus he writeth. They corrupted the holye &amp; ſacred ſcriptures, vvithout
                        The practiſes of the hereticall ſecte of Artemon. 
                        any reuerence: they reiected the canon of the auncient faith: they haue bene ignorant of Chriſt: not ſearching vvhat the holie ſcriptures affirmed, but exerciſinge them ſelues therein, &amp; ſiftinge it to this ende: that ſome figure or forme of a ſyllogiſme myght be founde to impugne the diuinitie of Christ: and if any reaſoned vvith them out of holie ſcripture, forthvvith they demaund vvhether it be a coniuncte, or a ſimple kinde of ſyllogiſme. layenge aſyde holye ſcripture, they practiſe Geometrie, as beynge of the earth they ſpeake earthlye and knovve not him vvhiche came frome aboue.

The bookes of Aſclepiades agree not vvith them of Theodotus. there is found betvvene them great difference, for their diſciples vvrote obſcurely ſuch things as their maſters had ambiciouſly corrected. againe vvith theſe the copies Hermophilus do not conſent. neither are the copies of Apollonius at concord among thē ſelues. if their alligatiōs be cōferred vvith their trāſlatiōs, &amp; alteratiōs, there shalbe found great diuerſity.

For firſt of all before the exerciſe of prophane literature, he inſtructed him in holy Scripture, and demaunded of him daily a certaine taſke, of that he learned and rehearſed. And this trade was not vnprofitable for him being a child, but he grewe therby vnto ſuch facility and promptnes, that he contented not him ſelfe with the bare and caſual reading of the words, but ſought farther, ſearching the perfect and profound vnderſtanding therof, ſo that diuers times he would ſet his father demaunding of him what was meant by this &amp; that place of holy Scripture.

Yet to him ſelfe he reioyced greatly, yelding vnto God the author of all goodnes harty thankes, for that he had made him the father of ſuch a ſonne. The report goeth that the father often vncouered the breaſt of his ſonne in his ſleepe, and ſolemnly kiſſed it as if the holy ghoſt had taken there the inner parte for his priuy cloſſet, and thought him ſelfe happy of ſuch an ofſpringe.

                        The tranſlator vnto the reader, for the remouing of ſuſpicion riſing of two thinges which Euſebius layd downe in the chapiter going before.
                        THere are two things in this former chapiter of Euſebius with good aduiſement to be conſidered. The firſt whether Potamiaena after her martyrdome prayed for Baſilides. the ſecond whether after her martirdome ſhe appeared vnto him, &amp; to others, as Euſebius (by heare ſay) laieth downe.

                           thoſe thinges vvhich are done, &amp; vvhich happen vnto men in this life, he ſayth further that they haue a care ouer vs, as we haue ouer them, although vve are altogether ignorant vvhat they doe. Peter Martyrs opinion, is this: although I could eaſily graunt, that the Sainctes in heauen do vvish vvith moſt feruent deſires the ſaluation of the elect, yet for all that, I dare not affirme that they pray for vs, in ſo much that the Scripture hath no vvhere layde that dovvne. Potamiaena this holy virgine and martyr, ſeeing the kindnes this ſouldier ſhewed vnto her, was greatly pleaſed with him, and in the feruency of her chriſtian loue towards him ſayde: that ſhe woulde entreate the Lorde for him after her departure. In the like ſorte alſo I reade that Cyprian Biſhop of Carthage moued Cornelius BiſhopCyprian lib. 1. epiſt. 1. of Rome, that whether of them both ſhoulde firſt departe this life, the ſame without intermiſſion ſhoulde pray vnto God for the other. ſuche was the feruencye of loue betwene them. In the like ſenſe men commonly ſay: God haue mercy on his ſoule. which ſaying the learned and zelous doe not ſo well like of for though the good motion (as they ſay) &amp; diſpoſition of the minde be expreſſed therby yet doth it the dead no good at all: when as his ſoule being already in the hands of God, needeth not our prayer. God no doubt was as redy to graūt Baſilides the light of his ſpirit, as Potamiaena was to pray for him. Toutching the ſeconde, whether ſhe appeared vnto him after her deathe the godly can iudge. Sainct Auguſtine ſayth: If the ſoules of the deade departed, vvere preſent at the affayres of the liuinge, then

                     FOr this cauſe therefore (as warned by a viſion from aboue) Alexander who afore was byſhop of Cappadocia tooke his iorney to Ieruſalem for prayer ſake, and viſitinge of the places there: whome they of Ieruſalem receaue bountifully, and ſuffer not to returne whome againe, and that did they accordinge vnto the viſion which appeared vnto them in the night, and plainely pronounced vnto the chief of them: charging them to haſten out of the gates of their city and receaue the byſhop ordained of God for them. this they did through thaduiſe of the bordering byſhops, conſtraining him of neceſſitie to remayne among them. Alexander himſelfe in his

epiſtles (at this day extant) againſt the Antinoites, maketh mention of this byſhopricke, in commen betwene him and Narciſſus, wryting thus about the later end of an epiſtle: Narciſſus greeteth

But what ſhall I ſpeake of them, when as Porphyrius himſelfe, then in Sicilia, ſtriuinge and ſtrugglinge againſt vs with his bookes endeuouring to confute holy ſcripture remembred the interpreters thereof? And beynge not able to charge, neither to impugne to any purpoſe our doctrine, any kinde of waye, now voyde of reaſon he fell to rayling ſpeaches and ſclaundering of the expoſitors. of which number namely he goeth about to accuſe Origen, whome he reporteth to haue knowen of a child, yet through his vnaduiſed forgetfulneſſe he commendeth the man, ſometyme reporting truely when as he coulde not otherwiſe chuſe: ſometime vntruely thinking thereby to delude others, and whileſt that nowe he accuſeth him for being a Chriſtian, anone he paynteth forth, and wondereth at his ſingular gyfte andPorphyrius an Atheiſt (whoſe wordes theſe are lib. 3. contra Chriſtianos) wrote fiftene bookes againſte the Chriſtians, whome Euſe bius cōfuted in 30. bookes of the which 20. were extāt in the tyme of Ierom but at this daye not one. excellencie in philoſophicall diſcipline. heare him therefore, for thus he writeth: Many beyng deſirous to finde out, not the imperfection and impietie of Ievvishe ſcriptures but the reſolution, haue turned them ſelues vnto expoſitions not cohaerent, &amp; interpretations of the ſcriptures inconuenient, and not onely allovvinge of forged ſcriptures, but alſo approuing and extollinge the commentators. for they alleaging the darke ſpeaches vvhich are ſayd to be manifeſt in Moſes, and publishing them as Oracles replenished vvith hydd &amp; concealed myſteries: they frame a charmed iudgement through the arrogancie of their minde and shevv forth their expoſitions. Agayne after a fewe lynes he ſayeth: This is the abſurde manner and guyſe of that man, vvith vvhome I beyng very yonge haue had conference, vvho then vvas very famous, and at this daye alſo by reaſon of the commentaries he lefte behinde him (I meane Origen) is muche ſpoken of, vvhoſe greate prayſe is blaſed farre and nyghe among the maiſters and fauourers of that doctrine. For vvhen he vvas the diſciple of Ammonius, vvho in our tyme excelled for his fame in philoſophie, he profited very muche vnder him beyng his maiſter, and obtayned greate knovvledge in the ſciences: but as toutchinge the right inſtitution of lyfe, he tooke in hande an other trade quite kame from his. for Ammonius beyng a Chriſtian and brought vp of chriſtian parents vvhen he had grovven into rypeneſſe of iudgement and the knovvledge of philoſophie, forthvvith he framed his trade of lyfe conformable vnto the lavves: but Origen beynge a Gentile and brought vp in the ſciences of the Gentiles, degenerated and fell into that

He continevvally peruſed Plato, he readde ouer the vvorkes of Numenius, Cronius, Apollophanes, Longinus, Moderatus, Nicomachus, and the reſte of the Pythagoreans, counted vviſe and

Theſe thinges hath Porphyrius written in his third-booke agaynſt the Chriſtians, truely reporting of this mans exerciſes, and ſundry kindes of knowledge but vntruely in that he ſayde, he ſhould degenerate from the Gentiles. For how can he pronounce the trueth when as he practiſeth to write againſte the Chriſtians? he ſayeth that Ammonius from leading a good and a godly lyfe fell into heatheniſh idolatrie. for the doctrine of Chriſt the which Origen receaued of his forefathers the ſame he retayned as we haue largely declared before. And

This haue I done firſte of all after the example of Pantaenus vvho profited a greate manye before my tyme, and had ſingular skyll and knovvledge therein. ſecondly after the example of Heraclas, novve a miniſter of the churche of Alexandria, vvhome I founde vvith a profeſſor of philoſophie vvhiche vvas his mayſter, fyue yeares before I applyed my minde to the ſtudie of theyr ſciences. VVho alſo in tymes paſte vſed the common and vſuall attyre, novve layinge that aſyde he tooke the philoſophers habite the vvhiche he retayneth as yet, and ceaſeth not vnto this daye vvith earneſt labour &amp; induſtrie to reade ouer the philoſophers bookes. Theſe thinges hath he written to the clearinge of him ſelfe for his ſtudie in prophane writers. When as at that tyme he continewed at Alexandria, there came a certayne ſouldier from the gouernour of Arabia, with letters vnto Demetrius Byſhope of that ſeae, and vnto him who then was Liuetenante of Aegypte, requeſtinge them with all ſpeede to ſende Origen vnto him whiche myght communicate vnto him ſome parte of his doctrine. Origen then beynge ſente of them taketh his voyage into Arabia. Not longe after when he had accompliſhed the cauſe of his iourney he returned into Alexandria. In the meane whyle there was rayſed ſuch a ſedition in the cytie and the warres were ſo hotte that there was no beynge for him there, he lefte Alexandria, and foreſeeynge that he coulde be ſafe no where in all Aegypt, he went into Palaeſtina and remayned at Caeſarea, where he was intreated by the byſhopes of that prouince, to diſpute in the open churche and to expounde holie ſcripture, beynge as yet not called to the miniſterie. Whiche thinge may euidently appeare by that whiche Alexander biſhope of Ieruſalem, and Theoctiſtus biſhope of Caeſarea wrote in defence of the facte vnto Demetrius concerninge him after this manner: (he layde this downe in his letters that there was neuer ſuche practiſe heardeAlexander. b. of Ieruſalem &amp; Theoctiſtꝰ b. of Caeſarea write thus vnto Demetrius b. of Alexandria which found faulte that a laye man in preſence of Biſhops ſhoulde diſpute or interprete. of, that there coulde no where the like preſident be founde; that laye men in preſence of biſhops haue taught in the churche) VVe knovve not for vvhat cauſe he reporteth a manifeſt vntrueth, vvhē as there may be found ſuch as in opē aſſemblies haue taught the people. yea vvhen as there vvere preſent learned men that coulde profite the people, and moreouer holie byshops at that tyme alſo exhortinge them to preache. For example ſake: at Laranda Euelpis vvas requeſted of Neon, at Iconium Paulinus vvas requeſted by Cellus, at Synada Theodorus vvas requeſted by Atticus, vvho vvere godly brethren. It is like alſo that this vvas practiſed in other places though vnknovven to vs. Thus was Origen honored beynge a yonge man, not onely of his acquaintance, but of byſhops that were ſtraungers vnto him. Afterwardes when Demetrius had called him whome by his letters and diuers Deacons of the churche had earneſtly ſolicited his returne, he taketh his voyage agayne into Alexandria, and there diligently applyeth his accuſtomed maner of teachinge.

But what ſturre fell out toutchinge that matter in his behalfe, and what was decreed by byſhops concerninge the controuerſies about him, and what other thinges he ſuffred preachinge the worde of God: in ſo much they require a ſeuerall volume we wyll paſſe them ouer, referringe the reader vnto the ſeconde Apollogie whiche we publiſhed in the defence of him, where we haue lyghtly runne them ouer.

Becauſe that he pretended the cauſe of his fall and the occaſion why he embraced that Apoſtaſie and ſchiſme to riſe through the perſwaſion of certaine brethren, asDionyſius b. of Alexandria vnto Nouatus the hereticke. if he were thereunto compelled by them, Marke howe he wryteth vnto him: Dionyſius vnto the brother Nouatus ſendeth greeting. If thou vvaſt conſtrayned againſt thy vvill (as thou ſayeſt) thou vvilt declare the ſame, if thou returne vvillingly▪ thou shouldeſt haue ſuffred anything rather then to rent a ſunder the church of God. neither is this martyrdome vvhich is ſuffred for not ſeueringe and deuidinge the Church of leſſe glorie, then that vvhich is tollerated for denyall of ſacrifice vnto deuels▪ yea in my iudgement it is offarre greater glorye. For in the one, martyrdom is ſuffred for one ſoule, in the other for the vniuerſall church. but if thou ether perſvvad the brethren, or conſtraine them to returne to vnitie, this notable fact vvilbe farre greater then the fault that vvent before. &amp; the one vvill not be imputed, the other vvilbe comended. If thou canſt not perſvvade the rebellious and diſobedient, ſaue at leaſte vviſe thine ovvne ſoule. I deſire thy health in the Lord and thy embracing of peace, &amp; vnitie.
                         Thus he wrote to Nouatus.

For truely as I heare in the greateſt ſynodes of bishopes it is decreed: that ſuch as renounce any hereſie shoulde firſte agayne be inſtructed, then be baptized and purged of the dregges, of the olde and impure leauen. And hereof I wrote vnto him requeſtinge him to certifie me agayne: and to our welbeloued fellowe miniſters Dionyſius and Philemon, who at the firſte gaue their cenſure with Stephan, and nowe they write vnto me, to whome at the firſte I wrote brieflie, but nowe at large.

                        Caeſarea calleth vnto him Marinus, from the tribunall ſeate, taketh him in hande with exhortations, leadeth him by the hande into the Churche, ſetteth him downe in the Chauncell, layeth his cloke aſide, ſheweth him the ſworde that honge by his ſide, afterwards pulleth out of his pocket the newe teſtament, ſetteth it ouer agaynſt the ſworde, and bad him chuſe whether of thoſe two, he preferred or liked beſt, for the health of his ſoule. When he immediatly ſtretching forth his right hande, had taken vp the booke of holy ſcripture, holde faſt then ſayth Theotecnus vnto him, cleaue vnto God, and thou ſhalt enioy the thinges thou haſt choſen, being ſtrengthened by him and goe in peace. After he had returned thence, the cryer lifted his voyce and called him to appeare at the barre, the time graunted for deliberation was now ended. ſtanding therefore at the barre he gaue tokens of the noble courage of his ſayth, wherefore in a while after as he was ledd, heard the ſentence of condenmation and was beheaded.

Aſtyrius on a time being preſent at the miracle, perceauing that many at the ſight thereof were amazed, pitied their erroneous eſtate, lifted his eyes vp vnto heauen and prayed Almighty God in Chriſt Ieſus his name that Satan the ſeducer of that people might be bewrayed,The deuill is put to flight by faſting &amp; prayer. and refrayned from the ſeducing any longer of mortal men. which when he had prayed (as the reporte goeth) forth with the ſacrifice ſwomme on the top of the water, and the beholders ceaſed to wonder, ſo that from that time forth there was no ſuch miracle ſeene in that place.

                        Of the image of the woman cured of the bloudy flixe, the image of Chriſt and of ſome of the Apoſtles.
                     
                     IN ſo much we made mention of this citye Paneas in Caeſarea Philippi, I thinke I ſhall offend if I paſſe ouer with ſilence a certaine hiſtorye worthy of memorie among the poſteritie in timeLuk. 8. Matth. 9. to come. The report goeth that the woman whoſe bloudy flixe we learne to haue bene cured by our Sauiour in the Goſpell, was of the aforeſaid citye, and that her houſe is there to be ſeene, and a worthy monument yet there to continewe of the benefitt conferred by our Sauiour vpon her.Monuments of memory &amp; not for ſuperſtition. that there ſtandeth ouer an high ſtone, right ouer againſt the dore of her houſe an image of braſſe reſembling the forme of a woman, kneeling vpon her knees, holding her handes before her, after the maner of ſupplication. Againe, that there ſtandeth ouer againſt this an other image of a man,

molten of the ſame mettal, comely araied in a ſhort veſture, and ſtretching forth his hand vnto the woman, at whoſe feete in the ſame piller there groweth vp from the grounde a certayne vnknowen kinde of herbe in height vnto the hemme of the braſen images veſture, curing all kind of maladies. This picture of the man, they report to be the image of Ieſus. it hath continewed vnto our time and is to be ſeene of trauellers that frequent the ſame citye. neyther is it any maruell at all, that they which of the Gentiles were cured by our Sauiour, made and ſet vp ſuch thinges. for that we haue ſeene the pictures of his Apoſtles, to wete, of Paul, of Peter, and of Chriſt himTo erect an image is a heatheniſh cuſtome. ſelfe, being grauen in their colours, to haue bene kept and reſerued. for the men of olde of a heatheniſh cuſtome, were wonte to honour after this manner ſuch as they counted Sauiours.
                     
                        The cenſure of the Tranſlator toutching the afore ſayd images.
                        
                           TOutching the trueth of this hiſtorye we may not doubt but that there was ſuch a towne, ſuch a woman, and of ſuch a diſeaſe cured by our Sauiour, the holy Euangeliſtes doe reporte it. and that there were ſuch images reſembling Chriſt and the woman (monuments of memorye, and not of ſuperſtition) and that there was ſuch an herbe of ſo wonderfull an operation, we cannot denye, inſomuch that many doe teſtifie of the ſame, ſome by heare ſaye, and ſome other that they ſawe it. yet thus much we may note with Euſebius in the ſame chapiter, that the originall erection of theſe and ſuch like images was deriued from the Gentiles, who of a heatheniſhe cuſtome were wont to adore ſuch as of olde tyme had benefitted them with the ſetting vp of their pictures for monuments in remembraunce of them. Toutching the miraculous operation of the herbe, we may aſſure our ſelues that it proceadeth neyther by vertue of the picture, neyther by the prayer of the other, being both dumbe pictures, but by ſome ſecrete permiſſion of the wiſedome of God. eyther to reduce the infidels at that tyme to the beliefe of the ſtorye, or to admoniſhe the Chriſtians that health was to be looked for, onely of Chriſt and no other Aduocate. after the death of Euſebius, Sozomenus (lib. 5. eccleſiaſt. hiſt. cap. 20.) reporteth that Iulian the Apoſtata tooke downe the image of Chriſt, and ſet vp his owne in the ſame place, which with violent fire that fell from heauen, was clefte a ſunder in the breaſt, the heade broken of with the

                              ke, and ſtickt in the grounde. for Iulian had taken downe the image of Chriſt, not to withdrawe the people from idolatrye, but in malice and despite of that newe religion, and erected vp his owne image to the intent the people ſhoulde worſhip it, purpoſely to deface Chriſt (euen as they doe nowe that willingly breake Gods commaundement to vpholde and mayntayne their owne traditions.) Therefore God ſtrooke Iulianus image from heauen with lightening and rent it in peeces, ſo that there remayned of it (as Sozomenus writeth) reliques long after. This God did not that he was pleaſed with the ſetting vp of pictures, but in token of his wrath and diſpleaſure againſt Iulian for comittinge ſo diſpitefull a deede.

For I am conſtrayned to write vnto mine owne bowels, my companions and conſenting brethren, citizens of the ſame Churche, and howe my writinges may be conueyed vnto them, ſeemes very difficult. a man may eaſier take his iourney, I ſaye not, without the compaſſe of theſe coaſtes, but from Eaſt vnto weſt, then trauell from Alexandria it ſelfe, to Alexandria. The middway of this citye is ſo crooked and vnmeaſurable, as is that waſte and croſſe wilderneſſe, whiche the Iſraelites wandred in, the continewance of two generations, and as is the ſeae, which deuided it ſelfe, and walled them in compaſſe, deepe &amp; penetrable, in whoſe high way, the Aegyptians were drowned. The calme and quiet shores reſembled often tymes the redd ſeae, for the ſlaughters committed vpon them. The floode that relieued the citie, ſeemed ſometime drier, and noyſomer then the drie and ſtony wildernes where Iſrael paſſing, thurſted ſo much that he murmured againſt Moſes, &amp; the drinke by the power of God (which onely worketh maruelous thinges) gushed out of the high rocke: ſometyme agayne it ſo ouerflowed, that the whole region in compaſſe, both way &amp; field, were aflote, and threatned the violence of mighty waters, euen ſuch as were in the time of Noe. This floode continewally ſlideth, being polluted with blood, and ſlaughter, and drowned carkaſſes, much like that which in the time of Moſes, was chaunged for Pharaos ſake, into blood and putrefaction▪ and what other floodes can purifie this waue, when all things are to be clenſed with water? and howe can the Ocean ſeae, being wide and waſte, compaſſing the whole worlde, ſeaſon the bitternes of this ſeae? how can the floode running out of paradiſe, whoſe fountayne is fourefold, into the which it is deuided, flowe into one heape &amp; washe away this shedd blood? and when can the ayre be purged of theſe noyſome and contagious vapors? ſuch fumigations are lifted from of the earth, ſuch windes from out of the ſeae, ſuch aër from out of floodes, ſuch exhalations from out of hauens, as if certayne putrified ishue diſtilled out of rotten carkaſſes, &amp; mingled it ſelfe with all the foure elements. and as yet they wonder and enquire whence proceade theſe continewal plagues, &amp; greeuous diſeaſes? whence proceade theſe infections which preuayle among vs? whence come theſe ſundry and manifold deſtructions of mortall men? and wherefore can not this great citie contayne henceforth as many citizens, if they were numbred, from the cradel to dotage, as heretofore it hath bredd as they cal them graybeardes? there were in tymes paſt ſo many from forty to ſeuenty as now the number of all ſortes can not aunſvvere. and of them alſo vvho heretofore from fourteene to foureſcore yeares vvere aſſigned, and allotted for diſtribution of bublique reliefe.

                        predeceſſors haue vvholy refuſed &amp; reiected this booke, &amp; by diſcuſſing the ſeuerall chapiters thereof haue founde it obſcure &amp; voyde of reaſons, &amp; the title forged▪ they ſayde it vvas not Iohns, nay it was no reuelation which was ſo couered with ſo groſſe a vayle of ignorance, and that there was none either of the Apoſtles or of the Saincts, or of them which belonged to the church, the author of this booke, but Gerinthus the author of the Cerinthian hereſie, intitling this as a ſigment vnder the name of Iohn for further credit &amp; authoritie. The opinion of Cerinthus was this▪ that the kingdome of Chriſt should be here on earth, and looke what he him ſelfe being very carnall luſted after, for the pampering of his pāch, the ſame he dreamed should come to paſſe, to wete: the ſatisfiyng of the bellye and the thinges vnder the belly with meates drinks, mariages, feſtiuall dayes, ſacrifices &amp; ſlaughters for oblatiōs, whereby he imagined he should conceaue greater ioy &amp; pleaſure. but I truely durſt not preſume to reiect this booke, becauſe that many of the brethren read it diligently, &amp; conceaued a greater opinion thereof, then the vnderſtanding my capacitie atayned vnto. I ſurmiſe there is a certaine hidd and wonderfull expectation of thinges to come contayned in the ſeuerall chapiters thereof▪ for where I vnderſtand him not, I bethinke my ſelfe the words contayne a deeper ſenſe, or more profound vnderſtanding: neither do I ſift or pronounce ſentence of theſe, after my groſſe vnderſtanding, but reſting rather with fayth, doe forthwith thinke they are higher then may be vnderſtoode of me▪ neither doe I vnaduiſedly refute the thinges I perceaued not, but rather maruell that I my ſelfe haue not manifeſtly ſeene them▪
                         after theſe things Dionyſius alloweth of all y• doctrine contained in the reuelacion, &amp; declareth that it is impoſſible to vnderſtande the meaninge thereof, by light reading ouer of the letter, writing thus: vvhen he had finished (as I may ſo terme it) all the prophecy, the prophete pronounceth them happie which kepe it, yea himſelfe to▪ happy (ſayth he)

                        is he which keepeth the words of the prophecy of this booke, &amp; I Iohn ſavv theſe things &amp; heard. wherefore I denyonot but that his name was Iohn, and that this worke is Iohns. I thinke verely the booke is of ſome holy mā, indued with the holy Ghoſt▪ but that it is the Apoſtles, the ſonne of Zebedie, the brother of Iames, whoſe is the goſpell intitled after Iohn, and the Catholicke epiſtle, I can hardely be brought to graunt, for I coniecture by the behauiour of both, by theyre fraſe of wryting, &amp; drift of the booke, that he was not the ſame Iohn. The euangeliſt layd downe no where his name, neyther preached he himſelfe, ether by goſpell or epiſtle. Againe after a fewe lines he ſayeth: Iohn no vvhere made mention as of himſelfe, or of any other, but the author of the reuelation forthvvith in the begininge of the booke prefixed his name, ſayinge: The

Againe Iohn, vvryteth an epiſtle vnto the ſeuen Churches in Aſia. Grace be vvith you and peace. The Euangeliſt prefixed not his name, no not to his Catholicke epiſtle, but orderly

The author hereof not contente after once naming himſelfe, to proſecute the

                        and the teſtimony of Ieſu. and about the end he vvriteth thus: happy is he that keepeth the vvordes of the prophecie of this booke, and I Iohn heard and ſavve theſe things. vvherefore vve haue to beleue that one Iohn vvrot theſe things according vnto this his ſaying, but vvhat Iohn he vvas it is vncertayne▪ he named not himſelfe as in ſundry places of the goſpell, the diſciple beloued of the Lord, neyther him vvhich leaned on his breſt, neyther the brother of Iames, neyther himſelfe vvhich ſavve and hearde the Lord, no doubt he vvoulde haue vttered one or other of
                        
                        theſe had he bene diſpoſed to reueale himſelfe▪ he layd dovvne not one of theſe but called him ſelfe our brother and partener, the vvitneſſe of Ieſu, and happie becauſe of the viſion and hearinge of the reuelations. I ſuppoſe there vvere many of the ſame name, vvith the Apoſtle Iohn, vvho for the loue they bare vnto him, and for that they had him in admiration and imitated his ſtepps, vvoulde be loued alike of the Lord, and therefore vſurped this name, euen as Paul and Peter are often repeated of faythfull vvryters. There is an other Iohn in the Actes of the Apoſtles

In the churche of Antioch after Domnus ſucceeded Timaeus, after him in our tyme Cyrillus was choſen biſhop, vnder whome we remēber one Dorotheus, then miniſter of the churche of Antioch to haue bene a very eloquent and ſinguler man. he applyed holy ſcripture diligently, he ſtudied the Hebrewe tongue ſo that he read with great ſkill the holy ſcriptures in Hebrewe. This man came of a noble race, he was expert in the chiefe diſcipline of the Grecians, by nature an eunuch ſo diſpoſed from his natiuitie. for which cauſe the emperour for rareneſſe therof, appropriated him, placing &amp; preferringe him to the purple robe in the citie of Tyrus. we hearde him our ſelues expounding holy ſcripture with great cōmendation in the churche of God. Tyrannus ſucceeded Cyrillus in the churche of Antloch, in whoſe tyme the ſpoile of churches was very ryfe. Euſebius whiche came from Alexandria, gouerned the church of Laodicea after Socrates. The ſturre about Paulus Samoſatenus was the cauſe of his remouing, for whoſe ſake he wēt into Syria, where of the godly he was hindred that he coulde not returne home againe, becauſe he was the deſired Jewell &amp; hoped ſtaye of our religion,Anatolius b. of Laodicea. as by the teſtimonie of Dionyſius hereafter alleaged ſhall manifeſtly appeare.

When vittaile (as they ſay) fayled ſuch as were veſieged, and famine preſſed them ſorer then foraine enemies, this ſame Anatolius brought this deuiſe to paſſe. whereas the one part of the citie helde with the Romaine

for to what purpoſe do we retaine theſe among vs nowe ready to yelde vp the ghoſt? to what purpoſe do we preſſe with famine ſuch as are maymed and wounded in bodie? when as men onely, and yonge men, are to be releaued, and retayned, and prouiſion of neceſſary foode, is to be founde for them which keepe the citie, with contine wall watch and warde. when he had perſwaded the ſenate with theſe and the like reaſons, firſte of all he roſe and pronounced that all ſuch, of what age ſoeuer, as were not fitte for feates of armes, were they men or women, myght boldly paſſe and depart the citie, affirminge that if they woulde remaine and lynger in the cytie like vnprofitable members, there was no hope of life, they muſt nedes periſhe with famine. to which ſaying the whole ſeuate condeſcended, ſo that he deliuered from daunger of death, in maner as many as were beſieged, but ſpecially thoſe that were of the churche. Agayne he perſwaded to flyght all the chriſtians throughout the citie, not onely ſuch as were within the compaſſe of the decree, but infinite mo, vnder colour of theſe, priuely arrayed in womens attyre, &amp; carefully he prouided that in the nyght ſeaſon they ſhould conuey them ſelues out at the gates, and flye vnto the Romaines campe, where Euſebius entertained all them that were afflicted with longe ſiege, after the maner of a father and phiſition, and reſteſhed them with all care and induſtrie. Such a coople of paſtors orderly ſucceeding one an other, did the church of Laodicea, by the diuine prouidence of God enioye, who after the warres were ended came thither from Alexandria. we haue ſeene many peces of Anatolius works, whereby we gather how eloquent he was, howe learned in all kind of knowledge, ſpecially in thoſe his bookes of Eaſter, wherof at this preſent, it may ſeeme neceſſary that we alleage ſome portion of the canons toutching Eaſter: The nevy moone of the firſt moneth &amp;

                        An. Do. 306. the perſecution vnder Diocletian waxed hotte, whē as theſe cruell edicts were euery where proclaimed. 
                        March, the feaſt of Eaſter then being at hande, when the Emperours proclamations were euery where publiſhed, in the which it was commaunded: that the churches ſhoulde be made euen with the grounde, the holy ſcriptures by burninge of them ſhoulde be aboliſhed, ſuch as were in honor and eſtimation ſhould be contemned, and ſuch as were of families if they retained the chriſtian faith ſhould be depriued of their freedome. and ſuch were the contents of the firſte edict. But in the proclamations which immediatly followed after, it was added: that y• paſtors throughout all pariſhes firſt ſhould be impriſoned, next with all meanes poſſible conſtrained to ſacrifice. then, I ſay, then, many of y• chiefe gouerners of the churches endured &amp; that cherefully moſt bitter torments, &amp; gaue y• aduenture of moſt valiant &amp; noble enterpriſes: many others fainting for feare, at y• firſt onſet were quite diſcouraged: all y• reſt tryed the experience of ſundry tormēts: one ſcorged from topp to toe: an other wreſted &amp; maimed with more intollerable payne: ſome fayled of y• purpoſed ende: ſome other were founde conſtant and perfect: one was drawen to the foule and filthie ſacrifices, and dimiſſed as if he had done ſacrifice, when as in very deede he had not: an other, when he had neyther approched neyther toutched ought of their deteſtable offringes, and ſuch as were preſent affirmed that he had ſacrificed, departed with ſilence, paciently ſuffring this thankleſſe pickthanke: an other halfe deade was borne away beyng throwen of them for deade: againe there were ſome proſtrat vpon the pauement trayled &amp; lugged all a long by the feete, &amp; recounted for ſacrificers: one reclaymed &amp; with a lowde voyce denyed y• euer he ſacrificed: an other lifted his voyce and confeſſed him ſelfe to be a Chriſtian, and gloryed in the faith of that gladſome tytle:

an other againe proteſted that he had neyther ſacrificed, neither euer woulde do ſacrifice. Theſe were beaten on the face and buffeted on the chekes, their mouthes were ſtopped by the ſouldiers handes, an whole bande was appointed for the purpoſe, whiche violently thruſt them out at the dores. ſo the enemies of the trueth triumphed if at leſt wiſe they might ſeeme to bring their purpoſe to effect, but their purpoſe preuailed not againſt the bleſſed martyrs of God, whoſe conflicts no tongue can ſufficiently declare.

                        Of the perſecution firſt rayſed by Ʋeturius the captaine against the Christian ſouldiers, at the beginning priuely, afterwards openly.
                     
                     THere were many to be ſeene whiche bare ſingular good will and affection to the ſeruice of almightie God, not onely in the time of perſecution, but long before whē peace preuailed. yet of late, I ſay of late at the firſt, the chiefe gouernour ſtarting vp as it were out of ſoking drunkemeſſe leaueled at the churche priuely and obſcurely (ſince the time which runne after theThe pollicie of Satans meſſengers. raigne of Decius &amp; Valerianus) and waged battaile with vs not ſodenly, but firſt aſſayed onely the chriſtians which were in campe. By this meanes he thought he could eaſſly ſnare the reſt, if that firſt he conquered theſe. and here might you ſee many of the ſouldiers deſirous to leade a priuate &amp; ſolitarie lyfe, fearinge they ſhoulde faynt in the ſeruice of almyghtie God. for when the captaine (who ſo euer he was) firſte went about to perſecute his hoaſt, and to trye and ſyfte as many as were brought vnto him throughout euery ward, and to giue them in choiſe either to obey &amp; enioy their dignitie, or to reſiſt and of the contrary to be depriued: many of the ſouldiers which were of the kingdome of Christ, without any delaye or doubt, preferred the faith of Christ before the fauor and felicitie they ſeemed enioye. and nowe one or two of them very heauely not onely contemned their dignities, but alſo endured bytter death for their conſtancie in the ſeruice of God. becauſe that the captaine as yet powred his malice by a little, &amp; though he durſt ſhede the blood of a fewe innocents, yet ſtaggered he at the multitude of beleeuers, fearing as it is moſt like, ſodenly to giue bettell vnto all, and that vniuerſally.

                        The Martyrdome of certaine courtiers in Nicomedia with others both there and in other places.
                     
                     ALl the renowmed men that euer were either of the Grecians or Barbarians cōmended for noble proweſſe and fortitude, are not to be compared to the deuine and famous martyrs of this our age, of thē I ſpeake who (together with Dorotheus) being the emperours pages, in chiefeſt credit with their Lordes, and were no leſſe vnto them then deare and naturall ſonnes: yet counted they thoſe comumelies, drudgeries, and new found torments for the trueth in Christ, greater ritches then the glory and pleaſure of this preſent life. One of theſe for example ſake, and the ende he made I wil declare, that the reader may coniecture by his happe, what beſell vnto the reſt. One of the aforeſayd Noble men was brought forth at Nicomedia into the open aſſembly, &amp; enioyned to do ſacrifice, who ſtoutly refuſing, by cōmandement is hoyſed vp on high; &amp; his naked

bodie all to be ſcourged, and the fleſhe rent in peeces with the laſhe of the whyppe, vntyll he were ouercome and yeelded to their ſacrifice. When that he had endured theſe torments, and perſiſted conſtant, and the bones laye all bare, the fleſhe baniſhed awaye: they powre Vineger myxt with ſalte, into the feſtred woundes, and bruſed partes of the bodie. When he had ouercome alſo theſe tormentes, and reioyced greatly thereat, a greediron with hotte burninge coales is prepared, and that which remayned of his bodie was layde thereon to be bruyled, a ſlowe fire beinge made vnder to conſume it by little and a little, leſt that death quickly deliuered him of his payne. So that they which had the charge of the fire woulde releaſe him of no part of his payne, vnleſſe he promiſed to yelde in the ende to the Emperours decree. But he holding faſt his former opinion ouer came them, &amp; yelded vp the ghoſt in the middeſt of his torments.Peter the emperours page after ſundry tormēts bruiled to death. Dorotheus hanged. Gorgonius was hanged. Anthimꝰ. b. of Nicomedia beheaded A certaine number beheaded. A certaine companie burned. A number drowned. The deade dygged vp. So valiant as you heare was the martyrdome of one of the Emperours pages, correſpondent vnto his name for he was called Peter. The thinges which happened to the reſt were nothing inferior to theſe, the which according vnto our former promiſe, we will leaue vntoutched. addinge onely this to that which went before, how that Dorotheus and Gorgonius with many others of the Emperours familie after ſundry torments ended their lyues on the gallowes, and bare away the garlande of victorie. At this time alſo was Anthimus biſhop of Nicomedia beheaded for the chriſtian faith, and with him a great multitude of martyrs. For I wot not how in the emperours palace at Nicomedia ſome parte of the houſe was all a fire, and when the Chriſtians were taken in ſuſpicion to be the authors therof, by the emperours cōmaundement the whole troope generally of all the godly there at that time was executed, whereof ſome with ſworde were beheaded, ſome other with fire burned, where alſo by the ſecret &amp; deuine prouidence of God (as the report goeth) both men and women ſkipped and leaped into the flaminge fire. An other companie the ſergiants ſette in a boate and threwe into the deapth of the ſea. The Emperours pages, after their death decently buried, and reſting in their graues were digged vp, and by the commaundement of their lordes caſt into the ſea, leſt any adored them in their ſepulchers and tooke them for gods as they dreamed of vs. and ſuch were the practiſes in the beginning of the perſecution at Nicomedia. but in a while after when that ſome in the region called Melitis, and againe ſome other in Syria were found ready to rebell, the Emperour commaunded all the paſtors throughout euery church to be impriſoned and kept in holde. The ſpectacle of the practiſes was ſo cruell to behold that it exceeded all that therof may be ſpoken. Infinite multitudes were euery where incloſed and the priſonsAll priſons were filled with Chriſtians. of old appointed &amp; ordained for murtherers, diggers vp of ſepulchers, and riflers of graues were then repleniſhed with biſhops, miniſters, deacons, readers, and exorciſts, ſo that there was no rowme in the priſon for ſuch as were condemned for hainous offences. Agayne when the former edicts had taken place, there followed others, by vertue of the which: ſuch as ſacrificed were ſet at libertie, and ſuch as reſiſted were commanded to be tormented with a thouſand kind of torments. Who is able heere to number the multitude of all the Martyrs throughout all the worlde? ſpecially in that they ſuffred martyrdome throughout Aphrick and amonge the Moores, throughout Thebais and Aegypt, throughout other cities and prouinces.

And if ſome tyme

violently they fell vpon them, backe agayne they recoyled, as if they had bene repelled by diuine power from aboue, which continewing a long time brought great admiration vnto the behoulders. When the firſt beaſt raunged aboue to no purpoſe, the ſeconde and thirde were let looſe at the one, and the ſame martyr. the ſufferance of thoſe Sainctes was to be wondred at, &amp; their conſtancy firmeThe conſtancy of yong men. and immoueable in their freſhe and greene bodyes. Then might a man haue ſeene a yong ſtripling vnder twenty yeares of age, ſtanding ſtill without any holding, ſtretching forth his handes in forme of a croſſe, making earneſt ſupplication vnto God, with a ſetled and immoueable minde, not wagging him ſelfe at all, or poynting any whither from his ſtanding place, yea thought the beares and Libards, breathed out preſent death, and now as it were teared his fleſhe in peeces with their teethe. yet I wott not howe as if their iawes had bene glued together, they recoyled back agayne.Fiue Martyrs after ſundry torments beheaded &amp; throwen into the ſeas. Beſides this yong man, ye might haue ſeene others in number fiue, throwen at the feete of a fierce bull, which toſſed into the ayre and tore in peeces with his hornes ſuch as ſtoode without the ryng. and left them as good as deade: onely the holy Sainctes he had no power to hurte, with his furious and cruell threats, thoughe he ſcattered the earth with his feete, and fanned the ayre with his hornes, though he were prouoked to fierceneſſe with ſearing yron, and fomed out preſent death, yet by the diuine prouidence of God he was puſhed backe. When that this beaſt could nothing preuaile agaynſt the holy Martyrs, others were let looſe, at length after ſundry bitter torments and violence of wilde beaſtes, all were beheaded, and in ſteade of ſtill earth and quiet ſepulchre, they ſwamme in the ſurging waues of the ſeas.

                           cap. 19. maketh mention of that, which Euſebius wrote cap. 14: and cap. 30. he maketh mention of that which Euſebius wrote cap. 2. as wrytten by himſelfe, therefore it is like Euſebius wrote this fragmente.

                           if we end at the 18. chapiter where the fragmente beginneth, the booke may ſeeme to be no booke but rather an entrance or beginning of a booke. Euſebius in the beginning of this. 8. booke cap. 2. promiſed to wryte of martyrs, thinkeſt thou Gentle reader, that he woulde be ſo briefe, and make ſo ſhort a treatiſe, where occaſion was miniſtred to wryte not one booke onely but rather. 3. bookes, if he were diſpoſed (omitting nothing as he promiſed li. 1. ca. 1. touching the martyrs of his time) to write of all the martyr doms ſuffred vnder Diocletian, Maximinian and Maximinus.

                        Of the martyrs in Palaſtina.
                     
                     IT was the ninetenth yeare of Diocletians raigne and the moneth Zanthicus, the which the Romaynes
                        Anno Domini. 306. call Aprill, the feaſt of Eaſter thē drawing nigh, Flauianus being gouerner of Palaeſtina, whē the emperours edicts were euery where proclaimed, in yt which it was commaunded yt the churches ſhould be deſtroyed, that the holy ſcriptures ſhould be burned, yt ſuch as were of creditt ſhould be contemned, yt ſuch as led a priuate life if they retayned the chriſtian profeſſiō ſhould be depriued of their freedome. &amp; ſuch were the contents of the firſt Edict. but in the proclamation which immediatly folowed after it was added yt the paſtors throughout all congregations ſhould firſt be impriſoned, next withall meanes poſſible conſtrained to ſacrifice. to be ſhort the firſt of the martyrs in Palaeſtina was Procopius who before he had bene any while impriſoned, ſtepping forthProcopius beheaded. at the firſt iumpe before the tribunall ſeat of the preſidents, &amp; being commaunded to doe ſacrifice vnto their gods, made anſwere: that to his knowledge there was but one only God, to whom, (as y• ſelfe ſame God had cōmaunded) he was bound of duely to ſacrifice. And when as they commaū
                        ded him to offer ſacrifice for y• proſperous ſtate of the foure emperours, he recited a certaine verſe out of a poet which pleaſed thē not, for the which immediatly he was beheaded the verſe was this:
                     Not many Lordes auayle vs here, let one beare rule and raygne.
                     This was ye firſt ſpectacle exhibited at Caeſarea in Palaeſtina the eight day of the moneth Deſius before the ſeuenth of the Ides of Iune called of the Romaynes the. 4. day of the ſabaoth. After him there ſuffred many of the inhabiters of the ſame citie, &amp; of the chief gouernours of y• eccleſiaſticall affayrs, who endured &amp; that cherefully moſt vitter torments, &amp; gaue the aduenture of moſt valiāt enterpriſes. other ſome fainting for feare were quite diſcouraged at the firſt. all the reſt tried the experience of ſundry torments. one ſcurged from top toe, an other wreſted vntil y• his ribbs brake a ſunder in the ſquiſing bonds, by reaſon whereof it fell out that ſome had their hands ſtrooke of, &amp; thus together they enioyed ſuch an end as befell vnto them according vnto the ſecret wiſedome &amp; iudgement of God. one was led by the hand &amp; lugged to the altar, &amp; his hands violēt ſtretched to toutch their deteſtable ſacrifices, &amp; in the end let go for a ſacrificer. an other when y• he had neither approched neither toutched, &amp; ſuch as were preſent affirmed that he had ſacrificed, departed with ſilence. one being halfe dead was borne away being throwen of them for dead, the ſame was tormēted with bondes &amp; reckned among the ſacrificers. an other lifted his voyce &amp; proteſted that he had not yelded at all, the ſame was beaten on the mouth &amp; conſtrayned to kepe ſilence, by the force of many hands which ſtopped his breath &amp; violētly excluded him when he had not ſacrificed at al. &amp; ſo it pleaſed them well, if at leaſt wiſe they might ſeeme to bring their purpoſe to effect, but for all their miſchieuous deuiſes the bleſſed martyrs of God only bare away y• victory. againe y• ſeuē
                        teenth day of y• moneth Dius, after the Romaynes the fifteenth of the Calendes of December, Alphaeus
                        
                        Alphaeus beheaded. Zachaeus beheaded. Romanus firſt had his tongue pulled out, next tormented &amp; clapt▪ in priſon, laſt of all in priſon ſtifled to death and Zachaeus, after they had bene laſhed with whipps &amp; mangled with raſors, after racking and greuous tormentes therein, after ſundry queſtions demaunded of them, after they had layen in y• ſtocks many dayes and many nights, their feet ſtretched foure ſpaces aſunder, laſt of all whē they had freely confeſſed and boldely pronounced that there was but one onely God, &amp; one kinge &amp; captaine ouer all Ieſus Chriſt (as if herein they had vttered blaſphemy or treaſon) they were in like maner beheaded euen as the martyr mētioned a litle before. Moreouer the hiſtory toutching Romanus y• martyr, who ſuffred the ſame day at Antioch is worthie of memory. He was borne in Palaeſtina, he was deacon and exorciſt of the church of Caeſarea, &amp; as it fell out being in Antioch at the ruyne and deſolation of y• churches, &amp; beholding with his eyes great multituds both of men women and children flocking vnto the altars and offering ſacrifices to the Idols, ſuppoſed it was

his duety in no wiſe to winck thereat: wherefore he being moued with ſingular zeale of the ſpirit of God, drewe nigh vnto them, exclaimed againſt them, and ſharpely rebuked them. Who, for ſo bold an enterpriſe was apprehended, &amp; ſhewed him ſelfe a valiāt witnes or teſtifier (if then there was any ſuch in the world) of the trueth in Chriſt. For when the iudge threatned him death with flaſhing fire that conſumeth to aſhes, he of the contrary embraced his offer moſt willingly, with cherefull countenance and gladſome courage, and with all, is brought vnto the place of execution. Being bounde to the ſtake while the officers threwe fagotts about him, and ſuch as were appointed to kindle the fire, wayted for the emperours watch worde &amp; pleaſure (who then was preſente) he ſhouted vnto them from the ſtake: where I pray you is the fire? The whiche he had no ſooner ſpoken, but the Emperour called him vnto him, to the ende he ſhoulde ſuffer a newe and ſtraūge kinde of torment, to wete: that his tongue might be plucked out of his mouth, the which he conſtantly endured, and thereby declared at large, howe that the deuine power, and grace of God, neuer fayleth them, which ſuffer for godlines ſake, but alwayes ether eaſeth their labours, &amp; ſlaketh theyr griefs, or els graunteth courage, and might to endure paciently vnto the ende. This bleſſed ſainct as ſoone as he had vnderſtoode of their newe deuiſed torment, beinge valiantly diſpoſed, neuer ſtaggered thereat, but voluntarily put out his tongue, &amp; yelded the ſame, which was fully inſtructed in the word of God, vnto the tormentors hands. After which tormēt he was clapt in priſon, and there plagued alonge time, at length, when the twentieth yeare of the Emperours raygne was nowe expired, at what time a generall pardon was proclaimed yt all priſoners ſhould be ſett at liberty, he alone lying in the ſtockes and his feete ſtretched fiue ſpaces aſunder, had his necke compaſſed with a haulter and thus in priſon ſtifled to death, ſo that hereby according vnto his deſire, he was crowned with martyrdome. This man although he ſuffred out of the bounds of his natiue ſoyle, yet being a Palaeſtinian by birth, is worthy to be canonized amōg the martyrs of Palaeſtina. Such were the tragicall affayrs of the church in Palaeſtina the firſt yeare of the perſecution, which was chiefly bent againſt y• preſidents of our doctrine &amp; byſhops of y• church of God.

All theſe in number eyght, were in one day beheaded in the citie of Caeſarea, the foure and twentieth daye of the moneth Dyſtros, that is: the ninth of the Calendes of Aprill. About that tyme two of the Emperours, whereof the firſte enioyed the prerogatiue of honor, the ſeconde was next which gouerned the Empire, embraced a priuate trade of lyuinge after the vulgare ſort of men, and the ſtate of the publicke weale immediatly beganne to decaye. In a while after the Romaine Empire was deuided, the Emperours amonge them ſelues one againſte an other fought great and greuous battailes, neither was that tumult and ſedition ceaſſed, before that firſte of all peace was reſtored and eſtabliſhed throughout all the parts of the worlde which were ſubiect to the Romaine Empire. for when as peace once appeared againe, much like ſonne beames ſhining after a miſtie and darke night, the publicke ſtate of the Romaine empire was a gaine eſtabliſhed, the bonde of amitie linked againe, mutuall amitie and concord retained of olde, was againe recouered.

It is in maner incredible how he ouercame all youthly affectiōs &amp; drowned all his wild otes in ſo vicious &amp; ſo corrupt a citie: &amp; how yt neither by reaſon of his youthly floure, lately floriſhing in his greene body: neither by reaſon of his cōpanie and acquaintance with youthly mates: he ſucked the iuyce neither ſwallowed the ſopps of lewde and wanton conuerſation: but embracing temperancie, led a reuerent life, peculier to chriſtian religion in modeſty, ſobrietie &amp; godlines.

                         God, was ledd no doubt by the deuine ſpirite as it were by a ſtryng into the city of Caeſarea, where the crowne of martyrdome, beynge the reward of godlines, was prepared for him. for whileſt that he liued among vs, he profited in holy ſcripture, during that ſhort terme of his life, more then any man coulde thinke, and practiſed ſuch diſcipline as tended to godly life, preparing a perfect way to dye well. But toutching the ende he made, who is it that beholdinge the ſame with ſingle eye wyll not be aſtonyed? and howe ſo euer

againe he be diſpoſed which only with fame and heareſay attaineth vnto the knowledge, of his ſetled mind, his noble courage, his immouable conſtancie, and aboue all his faithfull truſt &amp; endeuour wherby the tokens of vnfained godlines, and feruent ſpirite appeared which paſſed all the reach of mans reaſons, how can he chuſe but wōder therat? for when as in y• third yeare of our perſecution, vnder the raigne of Maximinus, the ſeconde whurlyburlie was rayſed againſt vs, and the tyrants letters then firſt of all were brought to Vrbanus, charging all the people of what degree or callingeThe cruell edict of Maximinus. ſo euer that they ſhoulde ſacrifice vnto their gods (the magiſtrats alſo throughout euery cytie buſily applying them ſelues to the ſame) and that the beadells throughout all the cytie of Caeſarea, ſhoulde by vertue of the Preſidents edict, ſummone, the fathers, the mothers, and their children to appeare at the Idols temple, and that the Tribunes ſhoulde likewiſe out of a ſcroule call euery one by his name: (by reaſon whereof there was no where but heauyneſſe, ſobbinge and ſighinge):The godly and bolde enterpriſe of Apphianus. the aforeſayde Apphianus (letting not one to vnderſtande of his purpoſe,) vnknowinge vnto vs which accompanyed with him in one houſe, vnknowinge vnto the whole bande of the captayne, came cherefully vnto 
                           Ʋrbanus the Preſident as he was a ſacrificinge, and boldly without any feare at all, tooke holde in his ryght hande and ſtayed him forthwith from doynge ſacrifice, exhortinge him alſo both wiſely and grauely with a certayne godly proteſtation and cheerefulneſſe of minde, thenceforth to ceaſſe and be no more ſeduced: ſayinge moreouer there was no reaſon that he ſhoulde deſpiſe the one &amp; the onely true God, and offer ſacrifice to idols and to deuells. Such an enterpriſe the yonge man tooke in hande, beynge prouoked thereunto (as it ſeemeth vnto vs) by the deuine power of God, ſounding in the eares of all mortall men by this his fact: that the Chriſtians which ryghtly do chalenge that name, are farre from falling away from the ſeruice due vnto God the author of all goodneſſe, ſo that they not onely ſuffer and variantly endure threates, and plagues, and puniſhments, which commonly chaunce vnto them but thenceforth alſo pleade more boldly and yeelde an accompt of their faith more freely, their tongue neither ſtuttinge neither ſtammeringe for feare, yea and if it may any kind of waye come to paſſe, they dare reuoke the perſecutors and tormentors them ſelues from their blinde ignorance, and conſtrayne them to acknowledge and embrace the one onely God. Immediatly after,Apphianus after often impriſoning, after ſundry horrible torments was throwen into the ſea whoſe carcaſſe the water threwe vp and layde at the gates of Caeſarea. he, of whome I ſpeake (as it was moſte like to happen vnto ſo bolde an enterpriſe) was haled of the Preſidents trayne, as of ſauadge beaſtes furiouſly raging againſt him, and tormented ouer all his bodie with infinite ſtripes the which he paciently ſuffred, and for a while was clapt in priſon. Where for one whole daye and nyght he was piteouſly tormented with both his feete in the ſtockes ſtreatched farre a ſunder, the thirde daye he was brought forth before the Iudge. And as ſoone as they enioyned him to ſacrifice, he reſiſted, and ſhewed forth the greate pacience ingraffed in his minde, for the ſuffringe of all terrors and horrible puniſhments: ſo that the executioners rent his ſides with the laſhe of the whippe, not once and twiſe, but often euen vnto the bone and inwarde bowells, laſhinge him alſo on the face and the necke, vntill that his face was ſwollen with the print of the ſtripes, ſo that they which afore time knewe him well and diſcerned him by his countenance, thenceforth miſſed of their marke, and knewe him not at all. When they ſawe he woulde not yeelde for all theſe manifolde and ſundrie tormentes, the executioners at the commaundemēt of the preſident, wrapped his feete in ſlaxe oyled all ouer and ſette the ſame a fire, whereof howe great, and what greuous payne be ſuffred, I am not able to expreſſe. It runne ouer his fleſhe, it conſumed the ſame, and pearced vnto the marowe bredd withinA cruell torment. the bones, ſo that his whole bodie larded and diſtilled muche like vnto droppinge and meltinge waxe. Yet there was breath left, and life remaininge for all theſe torments, the aduerſaries and executioners them ſelues were weryed at his intollerable pacience, which farre exceeded the common nature of man, after all this the ſeconde time he is caſt into priſon. Three dayes after he is brought againe before the Iudge, and beyng founde freely to confeſſe the ſame faith as aforetime, although by reaſon of his woundes, he was readie to yeelde vp the ghoſt, yet was he throwen into the ſurginge waues of the ſeas. If we ſhoulde make relation of the miracle which immediatly followed, peraduenture ſuch as ſawe it not with their eyes, will giue no creditt at all thereunto, and though we perſwade our ſelues, that men will hardlie beleue it: yet there is no reaſon to the contrarie but that we committe to memorie, and deliuer in writinge the hiſtorie as it was indeede, inſomuch as in maner all which inhabite Caeſarea are witneſſes to the ſame. There was no, not a childe in Caeſarea, but was preſent at this ſtraunge ſpectacle. As ſoone as they had plunged (as it pleaſed them beſt) that holie and bleſſed martyr of Chriſt in the deepe

goulphes of the mayne ſea: there roſe vpon a ſodaine ſuch a ſtorme (not after the wonted maner of weather) and ſuch a noyſe in the ayre, (not onely ouer the ſea but ouer the whole lande) whicheAn Earthquake. ſhooke both the earth, and the whole citie, with the violence and force therof: and together with this wonderfull and ſodaine earthquake the ſea caſte vp before the gates of the citie, the martyrs carcaſſe, as if it had bene of ſtrength not bigge inough to beare ſo holie a burthen. Such were the circumſtances toutching bleſſed Apphianus, who ſuffred martyrdome, on good friday, that is: the ſecond day of the moneth Zanthicus, the 4. of the Nones of Aprill.

                     THe ſame time of the yeare, and in maner on the ſelfe ſame dayes, in the citie of Tyrus, thereVlpianus wrapped in an oxe hyde together with a dogge &amp; a ſnake is drowned in the ſea. was a yonge man by name Vlpianus, who after moſt bitter ſtripes and greuous laſhes, was wrapped together with a dogge and a ſerpent in a greene oxe hyde, and caſte into the deapth of the ſea. And therefore I thought good to place him the next martyr in order of hiſtorie vnto Apphianus. Not long after, Aedeſius, not onely brother in God, but alſo by birth and blood, naturall brother by the fathers ſide vnto Apphianus, ſuffred like brotherly, and in maner the ſelfe ſame torments with him: after infinite confeſſions of his faith: after long fettering and ſtocking: after ſentence pronounced of the preſident, cōdemning him to the myne pitts &amp; quarries in Palaeſtina: after his holy trade of life, led vnder the philoſophicall habite, being farre more profounde in prophane literature, and better ſkilled in philoſophie then his brother: at length hearinge the Iudge, giue ſentence vpon the Chriſtians in the citie of Alexandria and raging againſt them beyonde all reaſon, ſhamefully entreating, ſome times graue and ſage, and ſober men, ſome other times deliueringe chaſte matrons, and conſecrated virgins, to brothell houſes, to the ende they ſhould be beaſtly abuſed: he enterpriſed the ſelfe ſame thinge which his brother had done before.Aedeſius the brother of Apphianus the martyr is drowned in the ſea. And becauſe he could in no wiſe away with thoſe horrible offences, he went boldly and courageouſly vnto the Iudge, and told him to his face of the filthie and ſhamefull acts he had done both by worde and deede. for which bolde reprehenſion he ſuffred ſundry bitter torments, with great conſtancie and pacience. and laſt of all he was throwen into the ſea, enioying the like ende with his brother. ſo farre of Aedeſius. And theſe things as I ſayd before enſued not long after.

And becauſe the cuſtome then preuailed, that ſundry ſhowes (how ſo euer it fell out at other times) in preſence of the emperours ſhould be exhibited with princely port &amp; maieſtie to their great delight &amp; pleaſure: and that varietie full of newe and ſtraunge deuiſes beſides the common and vſuall maner, ſhould then be miniſtred, ſo that ſome times beaſts which were fett out of India, Aethiopia, &amp; other places were let looſe in cōpaſſe of the theatre: ſome other times men with lewde and wanton geſtures, delited the beholders wonderfully, and the emperour alſo him ſelfe made ſport and paſtime: it behoued that a notable ſpectacle full of admiration ſhoulde ſhine in that gorgeous and princely ſhowe. And what thinke you was that? A martyr and a witneſſe of our chriſtian religion, brought to the ringe, and readie to wraſtle for the ſole and ſyncere ſeruice of God, by name Agapius, whome (a little before) we haue reported to haue bene throwen together with Thecla, at the feete of wylde beaſts. he beyng brought out of priſon and linked with malefactors to paſtime and ſport the people, when that he had openly runne the race, and played the man, and that thriſe, yea and oftenner to, becauſe the Iudge after ſundrie threates, &amp; ſundry torments, (either pitying his caſe or hoping he woulde recant) reſerued him to other newe combatts: at length he is agayne brought forth in preſence of the Emperour, no doubt beynge appoynted for that fitte tyme, that the ſayinge of our ſauiour, foreſhewed vnto his diſciples (to wete: They should be brought before kings and princes

But this faithfull and godly champion, firſt of all is called vpon of the tyrant, next intreated to reuoke his opinion, he is promiſed to be ſett at libertie: of the contrary he plainely pronounceth and that with a lowde voyce, that he was diſpoſed, and woulde willingly ſuffer, and that with all his hart, all the torments and plagues that ſhoulde be layde vpon him, not for any horrible or haynous crime committed by him, but for Gods cauſe and in his quarell, who was the creator of all thinges.

                         hott in a certayne village of Thebais called Porphyris (ſo named by reaſon of the veyne of redd marble which there did grow) there was a great number of confeſſors, of the which a hundreth (three onely excepted) men women and children together with tender ſucklings, were ſent to Pirmilianus Preſident of Paleſtina who lately ſucceeded in the rowme of Vrbanus. The which confeſſors, when they had proteſted their fayth in Chriſt, and truſt in God, the creator, and author of all goodnes, he ſo handled, that he commaunded (and that through the aduiſe of the Emperour) not onely their leftA hundreth Martyrs tormented and ſent to digging of mettalls. legges ſhould be ſawed aſunder in the knee; ſinewes, and all, with a hott glowing ſaw: but alſo their right eyes to be ſtickt on the point of a bodkine, the apple, eye lidd and all, to be quite digged out &amp; ſeared to the inner beynes, with an hott ſcalding yron: laſte of all they ſhoulde be condemned to the myne pitts and quarryes within the ſame prouince, for further miſery &amp; greater affliction. Neyther was it inough for him to behold with his eyes, theſe whiche endured ſuch torments, but he woulde alſo ſe before his face, ſuch as out of Palaeſtina (mentioned a litle before) he had enioyned to Iuſt one with an other, being neyther relieued at the Emperours coſt and charges, neyther trayned in any ſuch tryumphant exerciſe, or brought vp, in any ſuch championlike combat. They ſignified this not onely to the Emperours officers, but alſo to the face of the Emperour Maximinus him ſelfe, yelding forth ſignes of their moſt valiant conſtancye in Chriſt Ieſu, both by ſuffering of hunger and bitter corments, all which they ſuſtayned together with the aforeſayd, and other confeſſors allotted vnto their number out of the ſayd Caeſarea. Immediatly after theſe, there were others apprehended whiche aſſembled them ſelues together in the citie of Gaza to heare a Sermon, of whiche number ſome were alike tormented in the eye and the legge, ſome others had both their ſides rent in peeces with greater payne. Among the which there was one, by ſexe a woman, but in might, and valiantnes of minde, no leſſe then man, when as in no wiſe ſhe coulde away with the threats of abuſing her bodye, (ſuch an inkling had the tyrant geuen and committed the gouernement of the common wealth to cruell Magiſtrats) firſt ſhe was ſcurged, then tyed to an high tree, yelding forth a pitifull ſhewe of the ſore ſtripes printed in her ſides. When the executioners at the commaundement of the iudge had greuouſly aflicted her, an other woman deſeruing farre greater commendation then ſuch as the Grecians call Champions, (who for valiantnes and noble proweſſe are highly prayſed of all men) laying before her the ſelfe ſame marke of virginitie to ſhoote at with the former mayden, though in bewtie ſhe excelled not, though in countenance ſhe ſeemed abiect, yet in minde was ſhe

kinne and familiar acquaintance. other his vertues and well doinges, becauſe it required a longer treatiſe, we haue lately and that largely publiſhed in a ſeuerall and peculier volume entitled of his life, and deuided into three bookes. Therefore ſuch as are deſirous to learne more exactly and more exquiſetly to knowe his vertuous life, we referre thither, and preſently we minde onely to proſecute ſuch thinges as concerne the Martyrs which ſuffred perſecution together with him. The ſeconde after Pamphilus that came forth to wraſtle was the reuerent whore headed Valens, Deacon of the cityValens. 
                        Aelia, a graue father in euery mans eye and greatly ſkilled in holy Scripture, if then there was any ſuch in the worlde, he was ſo expert therein, that if he hearde any percell thereof by any man alleadged, forthwith was he able by rote to repeate it, as well as if then he read it out of the booke. The thirde was Paulus, a man wonderfull zealous and feruent in the ſpirite, borne in the citye Iamnia,
                        Paulus. where he grewe to greate fame, before martyrdome he endured the ſcorching and ſearing of his fleſhe with hott yrons, and paſſed through a worthy combatt at the confeſſion of his fayth, the martyrdome of theſe was differred by reaſon of their continewance in priſon two whole dayes. In the meane while came the brethren of Aegypt which ſuffered martyrdome together with them. theſe Aegyptians when they had accompanied the confeſſors of Cilicia, vnto the place appoynted for the digging of mettals, returned home againe. in their returne, they were taken of the watch which kept the gates of Caeſarea (which were barbarous and rude groomes) and examined who they were, and whence they came. when they could not conceale the trueth, they were layde in holde as if they had bene haynous treſpaſſers, and had committed ſome horrible crime. In number they were fiue, which5. Martyrs be headed. were brought before the tyrant, and after their examination, clapt in priſon. The thirde daye being the ſixtenth of the moneth Peritius after the Romaynes, about the fouretenth of the Calendes of March, theſe together with Pamphilus and the reſt of his companions (mentioned a litle before) by commaundement were brought before the iudg. This iudge firſt of all trieth with ſundry and manifold torments, with new and ſtraung deuiſes, the inuincible conſtancy, and valiant minde of the Aegyptians. And with all he demaunded of the chiefe, &amp; principal in this combat, what his name was, then, when as in ſteede of his proper name, he had named himſelfe vnto him, after ſome Prophet or other (for this was their maner, in ſteede of the Idolatrous names which their parents had geuen them, to choſe them newe names, they called them ſelues after the name of Elias, Ieremias, Eſay, Samuel and Daniel, and expreſſed not onely in worde but in workes them ſelues, the very true God of Iſrael, hidd from the Iewes, according vnto the proper etymologie of their names) Firmilianus, hearing ſuch an appellation of the Martyr weyed not at all the ſenſe and ſignification of the worde, but ſecondarily aſketh of him what contreyman he was, he ſatisfying the interrogatorie geueth a fl

Firmilianus being earthly minded enquireth earneſtly and curiouſly where this city was, in what contrey it lay, and with all tormented him greeuouſly to the ende he ſhoulde confeſſe the trueth▪ this Martyr hauing his handes wreſted, and tyed behinde him, his feete with certayne newe and ſtraunge kinde of engines ſtretched aſunder, auoutched conſtantly that he had told him the trueth. Afterwards when the iudge demaunded of him againe, what he was, and where that city was ſituated, made anſwere: that it was a contrey which onely belonged vnto the godly: that none other ſhoulde be partaker thereof, ſaue the godly alone: and that it was ſituate eaſtward where the ſunne in the morning ſpreddeth abroad the bright beames of his light. In vttering theſe wordes he entred into ſo diuine a cogitation within him ſelfe, that he forgot the tormentors which layd him on, on euery ſide, and ſeemed to perceaue no ſenſe or feeling of the payne and puniſhment, as if he had bene a ghoſt without fleſhe, bloode or bone. The iudge caſting doubts with him ſelfe, and greatly diſquieted in minde, thought the Chriſtians would bring to paſſe, that the city mentioned by the Martyr, ſhould rebell and become enemy vnto the Romaynes: he began to ſearch and diligently to inquire, where that region (by report eaſtward) ſhould be▪ laſt of all when he ſawe this yong man after bitter and greeuous torments, with immutable conſtancy to perſeuere ſtedfaſt in his former ſaying: he gaue ſentence that his head ſhould be ſtriken of from his ſhoulders▪ ſuch was the mortal race of this miſerable life, which this bleſſed Martyr did runne. The reſt of his companions, after the like torments, ended their liues, with the laying of their heads vpon the blocke. In the ende, Firmilianus, although in maner weryed, and fruſtrated of his purpoſe, yet ſatisfied to the full with theſe infinite

torments and their terrible execution, turned him ſelfe vnto Pamphilus, and his companions. And although he had experience ſufficient heretofore of their inuincible conſtancy in the defence of their fayth, yet agayne he demaundeth whether at length they would obey and yelde vnto him. when he was reſolued of their definite ſentence and laſt anſwere, which tended to martyrdome, hePorphyrius the ſeruant of Pamphilus after torment was burned to death. gaue ſentence they ſhould be tormented and puniſhed alike with the former martyrs. which being done, a yong man, one of the ſeruants of Pamphilus, ſo well brought by &amp; inſtructed, that he might very well ſeeme worthy the diſcipline and education of ſo worthy a man, as ſoone as he perceaued that ſentence was paſt vpon his maiſter, crieth out in the middeſt of the throng and requeſteth that his maiſters carkaſſe together with his companions, after the breath were departed their body, might quietly be buried in their graues. The Iudge being affectioned not like vnto man, but to a beaſt, or if there be any other thing more ſauadg, tendered not at all y• yong mans youthly yeares, but forth wt demaundeth of him whether he were a chriſtian, who, when that he affirmed plainly that he was: boyled with anger, as if his hart had bene ſtickt wt a knife, &amp; charged the tormentors they ſhoulde laye on him the weyght of their handes and the might of their ſtrength. after that he was inioyned to ſacrifice, and had refuſed: the Iudge commaunded that without all compaſſion he ſhould be ſcourged vnto the bare bone, the inner and ſecret bowells, not as if he were man couered with fleſh and compaſſed in a ſkinne, but a picture made of ſtone or wood, or ſome other ſenſeleſſe metall. In which kinde of torment continewed a long time, when the iudge perceaued that he vttered no language, neither gaue forth to vnderſtand y• he felt any paine: &amp; ſawe that (his body being in maner ſenſeleſſe, ſpent with laſhes &amp; conſumed away) he tormented him in vayne: he continewed ſtill in that his hard and ſtony hart, voyde of all humanitie, and decreed forthwith that his body ſhould be burned by a litle and a litle with a ſlowe and ſlacke fire. This yong man being the laſt of them which afore the martyrdome of Pamphilus (who was his maiſter according vnto the fleſhe) entred into this dangerous ſkirmiſhe, departed this life before him, becauſe that the tormentors which executed the reſt ſeemed to be very ſlow. Then might a man haue ſeene Porphyrius (for that was the yong mans name) after triall in euery kinde of exerciſe, earneſtly and wholy bent with a wonderful deſire, as the maner is of men, to obtayne the valiant &amp; ſacred victory: his body be poudred with duſt, yet gracious in face and countenance: haſtening to the place of execution for al his affections with vpright and noble courage repleniſhed no doubt with the ſpirite of God: attyred in the philoſophicall habit after his wonted guyſe, to wete, wearing a garment after the maner of a cloke which couered only his ſhoulders: telling his familiars with ſignes &amp; tokens wt a modeſt &amp; mild ſpirite what his wil was to be done: continewing ſtill yea when he was bounde to the ſtake, his glorious &amp; gladſome countenance: &amp; moreouer when the fire flaſhed about with great diſtance, and waxed extreame hott in compaſſe of him, ye might haue ſeene him with his breath on eyther ſide drawing the flame vnto him: and after theſe wordes when as the flame firſt of all toutched his bodye, which with loude voyce he ſounded out (Ieſus thou ſonne of God ſuccor and helpe me) to haue ſuffred conſtantly without any murmuring at al, all thoſe maruelous and extreame torments, euen to the laſt gaſpe. ſuch was the affliction of Porphyrius, whoſe ende Seleucus a confeſſor and aSeleucus beheaded. ſouldier ſignified vnto Pamphilus▪
                         who as the author of ſuch a meſſage deſerued, was without delay thought worthy to take the ſame chaunce together with thoſe Martyrs. for as ſoone as he had certified him of Porphyrius death, and taken his leaue and farewell of one of the Martyrs, certaine ſouldiers laye handes vpon him, and bring him before the Preſident. he as if he went about to haſten his iourney and to ioyne him a wayfaring companion with Porphyrius vnto the celeſtial paradiſe, commaūdeth forthwith that he ſhould be beheaded. This Seleucus was borne in Cappadocia, &amp; preferred to this great honor before all the youth of the Romaine bande and before them which were of great creditt and eſtimation among the Romaines, he excelled all the reſt of the ſouldiers in youthly fauour, in ſtrength, &amp; goodly ſtature of body, his countenance was gracious, his ſpeach amiable, he paſſed for comely making, for bigge ſetting, for fayre liking, and fit proportion of the whole body▪ he was famous at the beginning of the perſecution for his pacient ſuffring of ſtripes in the defence of the fayth, and being depriued of the warlike dignitie which he enioyed, became a zelous follower of the worshippers or religious men, he ſuccored and prouided with fatherly care &amp; ouerſight for the fatherles, the ſuccorleſſe, y• widowes, and ſuch men as were viſited with greate miſery &amp; affliction. wherfore God being rather delited wt ſuch like ſacrifices of mercy, and workes of charitye, then with ſmokye incenſe and bloody oblations, called him of his goodnes, vnto this glorious and renowmed garland of martyrdome. this was the tenth champion of the number mentioned

before, which ſuffered death in one and the ſelfe ſame daye, whereby (as it appeareth) the great and bewtifull gate of the kingdome of heauen, being ſett wide open by the meanes of Pamphilus his martyrdome, made an eaſie paſſage both vnto him and the others his companions to the attayning of the perfect pleaſure in the celeſtiall paradiſe. Theodulus alſo a graue and a zelous father,Theodulus crucified. one of Firmilianus the Preſidents familie, and in greater creditt with him, then all the reſt of his houſhold, partly for his whore heade and greate yeares (for he was a greate graundfather) and partly for the ſinguler good will and affection borne alwayes towards him: treading the ſame ſteppes which Seleucus had done before him, and committing the like crime with him, is brought before his maiſter Firmilianus the Preſident, to pleade for him ſelf: who being incenſed with greater rage towards him then the reſt of y• Martyrs, deliuered him in the ende to be crucified, which kind of martyrdome after the example of our Sauiour he ſuffered moſt willingly. yet becauſe there wanted oneIulianus burned. which might ſupplye the twelfe rowme among the Martyrs rehearſed before, Iulianus came forth. who comming from farre and as yet not entred into the wraſtling place, as ſoone as he had hearde by the way as he came of their death and happy endes, forthwith he conueyed him ſtraight vnto the noble ſpectacle and theatre of Martyrs, and as ſoone as he ſawe with his eyes the bleſſed bodyes of the Sainctes lying all a long vpon the grounde, he was tickled with inward ioye, he embraced them ſeuerally, and ſaluted them after the beſt maner. which when he had done the catchpoles and executioners apprehended him, and preſented him before Firmilianus, who after he had executed ſuch thinges as were correſpondent vnto his cruell nature, commaunded he ſhoulde be layde vpon a ſlowe and a ſlacke fire, and ſo burned to death. Iulianus triumphed and leapt for ioye, and with a loude voyce gaue great thankes vnto God, who voutch ſafed him worthy, ſo greate a glory and rewarde, and in the ende he was crowned with martyrdome. he was by birth of Cappadocia, in life and conuerſation holy, faythfull and very religious, and beſides his fame in other things he was inſpired with the aboundance of the ſpirite of God. ſuch was the trayne of them which were tormented, and by the goodnes of God crowned Martyrs in the company of Pamphilus. their holy and happy carkaſſes were kept aboue grounde by the decree of the wicked Preſident, foure dayes and foure nightes to be deuoured of the beaſtes of the fielde, and of the foules of the ayre. but when as miraculouſly neyther beaſte, neyther byrde, neyther dogge drewe nighe vnto them, agayne by the grace and goodnes of Almighty God, they were caried away ſafe and ſounde, and committed with ſolempne buriall after the chriſtian maner, vnto their ſtill graues and reſting ſepulchres. Furthermore when the tyranny and cruelty practiſed againſt vs, was bruted abroad, and rife in euery mans mouth: Adrianus and Eubulus of the contrey Manganaea, taking their iourney towards Caeſarea, for to viſite the reſt of the confeſſors, were taken at the gates of the city, and examined concerning y• cauſe of their voyage into that contrey. afterwards freely confeſſing the truth they were brought before Firmilianus, he without any more adoe, or farther deliberation, after many torments, and infinite ſtripes, gaue ſentence they ſhoulde be torne in peeces of wilde beaſtes. within two dayes after, being the fift day of the moneth Dyſtros, about the thirde Nones of March, when the citizensAdrianus be headed. of Caeſarea celebrated their wakes, vpon the day of reuells, Adrianus was throwen at the feete of a fierce lion, afterwards ſlayne with the edge of the ſworde and ſo dyed.

When the ſeuenth yeare of the perſecution rayſed agaynſt vs was nowe almoſt at an ende, and our affayres beganne by a litle and as it were by ſtelth to growe vnto ſome quiet ſtaye, eaſe, and ſecuritye, and nowe leaned vnto the eyght yeare, in the whiche no▪ ſmall multitude of confeſſors aſſembled them ſelues together at the myne pitts in Palaeſtina, who freely occupied them ſelues in the rites and ceremonyes of Chriſtian religion, ſo that they transformed their houſes into Churches: the Preſident of the prouince, being a cruell and a wicked man (as his miſchieuous practiſes agaynſt the Martyrs of Chriſt doe proue him for no other) made a voyage thyther in all the haſte, and hearing of their doinges, their trade of life and conuerſation, made the Emperour by his letters priuey thereunto, paynting forth in the ſame, ſuch thinges as he thought woulde diſgrace, diſcredit and defame the good name of thoſe bleſſed confeſſors. Whereupon the maiſter of the myne pitts and mettalls came thyther, and by vertue of the Emperours commaundement ſeuereth aſunder the multitude of confeſſors, ſo that thenceforth, ſome ſhould continew at Cyprus, ſome other at Libanus, and others alſo in other places of Palaeſtina, and commaunded that all ſhoulde be weryed and vexed with ſundry toyles and labour▪ afterwards he picked out foure of the chiefe of them, and ſent them vnto the iudge, of the which, two of them, were called Peleus and Nilus, Biſhops of Aegypt.

Let no man maruell at all, at his good conuerſation and godly life, though he were blinde, in ſo much that his maners deſerued not ſuch admiration as his gift of memorie, where he had printed whole bookes of holy ſcripture, not in tables made of ſtone (as the holy Apoſtle ſayth) neyther in the

God himſelfe reachinge vnto theſe men (mentioned before and continewinge in ſeuerall places and executinge their wonted trade of life in prayer and faſting with the reſt of their godly exerciſes) the right hand of his mercy and ſuccor; graunted them through martyrdom to attaine vnto an happy and a bleſſed ende. But the deuell, enemy and ſworne aduerſary of mankinde colde no longer away with them, for that they were armed and fenced againſt him with prayers continewally poured vnto God, but went about (as he imagined) to vexe them and to cut them of, from the face of the earth. For God had graunted him that might and power, that neither he in no wiſe colde be kept backe from his wilfull malice and wickednes: neither theſe men for their manifolde &amp; ſundry cōflicts, ſhould be depriued of their reward &amp; glory. For which cauſe by the decree of the moſt wicked emperour Maximinus, there were in one day nine &amp; thirty martyrs beheaded.

                        THis recantation ſet forth by the commaundement of the emperours, was publiſhed euery where throughout Aſia and all his prouinces which thing being done, Maximinus the Eaſtern tyrant, moſt impious of all &amp; chief enemy to y• ſeruice of God, not pleaſed wt theſe proclamations in ſteade of y• wryttē edict, commaunded his princes by word of mouth y• they ſhould make league wt the chriſtians.

But they certified one an other of this commaundement, &amp; Sabinus who then among them was in higheſt dignity certified by epiſtle wrytten in the latine tongue, the ſeuerall preſidents of the prouinces of the emperours decree by tranſlatiō thus: The maieſty of our Lordes and moſt noble emperours hath decreed nowe a good while agoe

For as much as therefore it fell out by this meanes that many putt themſelues in great perill, the maieſty of our lieges, &amp; moſt puyſant emperours, after their noble piety (iudging it a thing farre from their moſt noble purpoſe, for ſuch a cauſe to caſt men into ſo great a daunger) gaue me in charge that with diligence I shoulde write vnto your induſtry. That if any of the chriſtians be founde to vſe the relligion of his owne ſect, you neyther grieue nor moleſt him at all, neyther thinke any man for this cauſe worthy of punishment when as it appeareth in ſo long a tract of time, they can by no meanes be induced to ſurſeaſe from ſuch a pertinacy. Your induſtrie hath therefore to write to the liuetenāts, captaines &amp; cōſtables of euery citie &amp; village that they paſſe not the bounds of this edict to preſume any thing contrary to the ſame. The preſidents through out the prouinces, hauing receaued theſe letters thinking this to be the true meaning of the emperour, in theſe lettres contayned, declare forthwith by their epiſtles y• emperours decree vnto ye liue tenants, captaynes and vnto ſuch as gouerned the common people of the countrey. Neither were they onely ſatisfied with the ſending of letters, but rather by the deed doing it ſelfe to bring about the emperours will, brought forth and ſett at liberty, ſuch as they held captiues in priſon for the confeſſion of chriſtian religion, yea releaſinge them alſo which for puniſhmentes ſake were committed to ye mine pitts &amp; digginge of mettalls, for they being deceaued thought this would pleaſe the emperour. Theſe things being thus brought to paſſe, immediatly after the ſonne beames of peace ſhined brightly as if it had bene after a darke or myſty night. Then might a man haue ſeene throughout euery city, congregations gathered together, often ſynods and there wonted meeting celebrated.

                     THis Theotecnus therefore when he had vehemently impugned vs and procured euery kind of way that the chriſtians ſhould diligently be ſought out of their dennes and apprehended for haynous robbers: and had imagined all meanes to the end we ſhould be charged and accuſed: and had bene the cauſe of death to an infinite number, at length he erecteth the Idoll of Iuppiter

This Theotecnus alſo, being a flatterer (wherwith he ſeemed to pleaſe y• emperour) rayſed a wicked ſpirit againſt the chriſtiās and ſayd: God ſo commaunded that the chriſtians ſhould be baniſhed out of the citie, and the liberties thereof, For that they were rebells and traitors to the crowne.

I hope it is well knowen vnto yourMaximinus in the behalf of the Chiſtians. wiſdome and to all mortall men, our lieges and lordes Diocletian and Maximinian, our fathers, to haue notably decreed, whē as they ſaw in maner all men laying aſide the ſeruice of the gods, and ioyning them ſelues to the Chriſtian nation: that as many as ſeuered them ſelues from the ſeruice of the immortall Gods, shoulde be called againe vnto the religion of the gods with vndoubtedAn impudēt lye. he ſhewed no ſuch curteſie. paynes and punishments. I truely firſt of all when that happely I came into the eaſt &amp; vnderſtoode of many men which might haue profited the cōmon wealth, and were banished by the Iudges for the aforeſayd cauſe, gaue this to euery Iudge in charge: that none of them thenceforwards should deale ſeuerely with them of their prouinces, but call them backe vvith faire ſpeaches &amp; exhortations vnto the worship of the Gods. VVhen theſe thigs then according vnto our will were accomplished, it fell out that none of the eaſterne partes, eyther was banished or found obſtinate, but by reaſon that nothing was greuouſly or ſeuerely practiſed againſt them, they might be reuoked vnto the ſeruice of the Gods. VVhen as the laſt yeare proſperouſly I came to Nicomedia, and there made my abode, the citizens of Nicomedia came vnto me together with the images of their gods, crauing earneſtly that in no caſe I shoulde permitt ſuch a nation to inhabite their contrey. But foraſmuch as I knevve very many men of that religion to dvvell in thoſe parts, I framed them an anſvvere in this ſort: that I liked vvell of their petition, but I ſawe that all did not requeſt the ſame. VVherefore if any continewed in that ſuperſtition, (our will was) that euery one should be left to follow the free purpoſe of his vvill, ſo that they vvould acknowledge the ſeruice of the gods, in like ſort they should enioye the ſame city together with the citizens of Nicomedia and the other cities alſo, vvhich made the like requeſt vnto me, that not one of the Chriſtians might dvvell among them. It vvas needefull that I should anſvvere them friendly and louingly, the vvhich all the auncient Emperours obſerued and is of the gods them ſelues approued, through whome all mortall men and the gouernment it ſelf of the commonvvealth doth ſtande. It pleaſed vs then to ratifie ſo great a requeſt made vnto vs in the behalfe of the ſeruice of their hygh God. VVherefore though chiefely heretofore alſo vve haue vvritten vnto your vviſdome &amp; commaunded the like, that nothing ſeuerely were done againſt them of the prouince vvhich vvent about to ſuccour ſuch a nation, but shoulde paciently be obeyed, and that they should ſuffer contumelies and vexations neither of the officials neither of any other vvhatſoeuer. I haue thought good by theſe my letters to admonishe your prompt

minde, that vvith fayre ſpeaches and exhortations you brynge them of our dominions to acknovvledge the carefull prouidence of the Gods. VVherfore if any of his ovvne accorde thinke good to acknovvledge the ſeruice of the Gods, ſuch a one is vvorthie to be embraced: but if ſome vvill cleaue to their peculier religion, lette them do it at their free vvill and pleaſure. Your vviſdome hath therefore to obſerue that vvhich is decreed of vs, that none henceforth haue this povver giuen him to oppreſſe vvith contumelies, ratling ſpeaches, &amp; shaking troubles, our louing ſubiects, ſithen that as it is vvritten before, it behoueth vs rather vvith faire ſpeaches and milde exhortations to reuoke them vnto the ſeruice of the immortall gods. And to the ende this our commaundement be knovven of all our prouincials, our vvill is that you publishe by proclamation directed from yourſelfe, that vvhich is commaunded by vs
                        
                     
                      
                        When Maximinus being conſtrained of neceſſitie &amp; not of his owne accord had cōmaunded theſe things, for all this was he not of all men thought true in his dealing, either worthy of truſt, for becauſe that afore time after the like graunt, he ſhewed a turncoate, a wauering mind, &amp; a lying mouth. There durſt none of vs gather a ſynode together or medle with publique affaires, for theſe letters licenced not this: but onely commaunded: that we ſhould not be afflicted with any violence or contumelie, it commaunded not that conuenticles ſhould be made, that churches ſhould be buylt, or the reſt of our wonted ceremonies ſhould be retained. although Conſtantinus &amp; Licinnius princes of peace and piety, had written vnto Maximinus that he ſhould graunt theſe things and permitted the ſame vnto all their ſubiects by Edicts and decrees: yet the moſt wicked woulde not hitherto haue remitted his tyrannie, had not he by deuine iudgement bene compelled and brought at length againſt his will to this paſſe, for ſuch a trouble beſett him as followeth.

After this ſort the tyrant ſubiect to moſt vile ſhame and reproche came to his owne coaſts, and firſt of all being ſtroken with rage &amp; madneſſe, he ſlewe many prieſts and prophets of their gods, whome before he had ſuſpected, and by the procurement and truſt of whoſe oracles he had taken armour vpon him to wage battaile▪ as inchaunters &amp; deceauers, which alſo had villanouſly betraied his perſon, afterwards whē he had glorified the God of the Chriſtians, and ordayned a moſt perfect and abſolute decree in the behalfe of their

Seeing that hitherto we were furthered by thy prayers, and nowe hauing finiſhed nyne bookes of the eccleſiaſticall hiſtorie, we annexe the tenth and dedicate it vnto thee, moſt holy Paulinus, ſealinge and ſhuttinge vp the whole worke with the publiſhinge abroad of thy prayſe.

Inſomuch that theſe words of ye Prophet require a new ſong, of duety then we muſt haue a ſonge in our mouth, becauſe that after vgleſome and darke ſpectacles, after thunderinge and terrible threates, we haue bene thought worthie nowe to ſee ſuch thinges, and to celebrate ſuch ſolemnities, ſuch as I ſaye before vs manie iuſte men and Martyrs of God haue deſired to ſee vpon earth and haue not ſeene, to heare and haue not hearde.

We honor him iuſtly, reuerencinge the ſame with all the myght of our mindes, and teſtiflyng truely accordinge vnto the prophecies written where it is ſayde: Come and ſee the vvorkes of

Wherfore becauſe the bridgrome, the word of God hath thus ſpoken vnto the ſpouſe his moſt holy church, very well hath this chiefe ſolemnizer of the mariadge raiſed &amp; reſtored this deſert lying after the maner of a dead carcaſe, deſtitute and voyd of all hope of man, by the commō prayers of you all &amp; the true hands ſtretched forth at the commaundement of the vniuerſall king &amp; by ſhewing of the power of Ieſu Chriſt: &amp; beinge raiſed ordained her ſuch a one as he had learned by the deſcription of holy ſcripture.

But the holy word of ſaluation, carefull hereof, obeing the bountifullnes of his moſt gracious father, reuenged him of the ſinners with puniſhmente due for their deſert. Firſt of all then by takinge away the liues of the moſt impious and pernicious of all, the moſte greuous and hated tyrauntes of God, he purged the whole worlde with the induſtry of the moſt godly princes: next he brought vnto the open face of the world; men well knowen of him dedicated and conſecrated vnto him of olde in godly life and protected by him, thoughe in ſecrete (the troubleſome times then drawing nigh) them againe hath he honored ſufficiētly with plenteouſnes of his ſpirit, and by the meanes of theſe hath he wiped and clenſed the ſoules a litle before infected, oppreſſed with all kinde of filthe, and heapes of impious decrees, with reprehenſiue leaſons of Diſcipline as it were with digginge and deluinge inſtrumentes, as ſpades, and the

But this people being many &amp; great in nūber is not fitt to reſemble the buylding of a more excellent worke. Vnto ſome he committed the entrances of the houſe, geuing them in charge to watch the dores and to guide ſuche as enter in, who not vnworthely are ſhewed to be the porches of the temple, Some he hathe firmely ſett about the inner court with chiefe pillers after the maner of a quadrāgle and to the chiefe bulwarks he hath referred the Scripture of the foure Euangeliſts. Againe ſome he hath coupled with fortreſſes one eyther ſide about the princely pallace, which as yet are nouices in the faith they both increaſe and proſper, yet ſett farther of from the inward holy cōtemplation of the faithful.

                        The ingratitude of Licinnius towards Constantinus, and his cruelty towardes the Chriſtians.
                     
                     The ſight of theſe things was intollerable for y• deuel, enemy of honeſty, &amp; worker of malice to behold. neither in like ſort did y• things which happened vnto the forſayd tyrants, ſuffice Licinnius better to aduiſe him ſelfe. Who while he enioyed a proſperous raygne &amp; the ſecond honor next after the emperour Conſtantinus the greate, and was hyghly reuerenced for his affinytye and kynrede with Conſtantinus, layinge aſide the example of good princes, imitated the wickednes and impietie of cruell tyrants: &amp; whoſe tragicall lyfes he ſawe ended before his face theſe mens cenſures wold he followe rather then continew in the fauoure and friendſhip of the better. wherefore being moued agaynſt his deare friende in all things with the prycks of enuy, rayſed againſt him a wicked and a very ſore battaill, neyther tendering the lawes of nature, neither mindful of proteſted othes, neither of blood, neyther of the couenauntes paſſed betwene them. Yet the renowned emperour, that he might ſhewe him the tokēs of true friendſhip &amp; hartie good will, enuied not at his kinred, neither denyed his company in honorable wedlocke with his ſiſter: yea heLicinniꝰ had maried Conſtantinus ſiſter. voutchſafed to make him partaker of his fathers kinred and the emperiall blood: &amp; to be ſhorte he had graunted him as to his alliance and fellowe emperour authority ouer the whole empire, &amp; cō
                        mitted vnto him no ſmall part of the nations ſubiect to the Romaine empire, for to gouerne and rule. He likewiſe practiſing the contrary, inuented dayly all kinde of wiles againſt him that was of higher power, &amp; deuiſed all ſubtle ſleyghts to recompence his deare friend euel for good. where fore in the beginning to cloke his conſpiracy he fayned friendſhip, &amp; often in the meane ſpace guilfully &amp; deceatfully by his laying of waite he hoped eaſily to bring to paſſe y• which he deſired. But God being the friend &amp; fauorer &amp; keeper of Conſtantinus brought to light the wayte layde for him in ſecret &amp; in hugger mugger. For truely the power &amp; the ſtrong armour of piety is of great force both to reuenge the enemy and to preſerue proper health: ſo that the moſt godly emperour beinge ſtrengthened therewith eſcaped the manifold ſleyghts of the curſed enemy. But Licinnius when he perceaued that his ſecret conſpiracy framed not after his mind, for that God reuealed vnto the godly emperour, all his guyle and deceate, when he coulde no longer cloke his rebellion, be rayſeth open warres: &amp; withall when he purpoſed to geue battaill vnto Conſtātinus he went about to impugne almighty God himſelf, whome he knew to be worſhiped of Conſtātine. Afterward he endeuored to impugne by a litle litle &amp; ſecretly the ſaincts vnder his dominion, who neuer moleſted

nor endomaged his empire, neither hurt him any kinde of way at all. and to bring this to paſſe, he was ſore pricked &amp; geuen to do miſchiefe of his proper malice ingraffed in him. Wherfore neither laying before his eyes the remēbrance of them which perſecuted the chriſtians before him, neither of them whome he had chaſtized &amp; executed for committing of impietie, but renouncing his right witts he embraced open madnes, and purpoſed to impugne in ſteade of him that was holpen, God him ſelfe the helper of Conſtantinus, and firſt of all he baniſhed all the Chriſtians from his court, depriuinge him 
                           •
                        elfe (ſeely wretche) of their praiers which they made vnto God for him, the which alſo they were wont to make for all men after their coūtrie diſcipline. Afterwards he commaunded that the ſouldiers appoynted in the citie ſhould be depriued and ſpoyled of their honor &amp; dignities, vnleſſe they would do ſacrifice vnto deuills. Theſe were ſmall things in reſpect of greater practiſes which he committed. To what end ſhould I rehearſe the things which the enemy of God cōmitted ſeuerally and by peeces: howe the moſt vniuſt, made vniuſt lawes, who by his iniunctions gaue commaundement that no charitie by any man ſhoulde be extended towardes them which were afflicted in priſon: neither cōpaſſion ſhould be had on them which in fetters were like to periſhe for famine, neither was it lawfull for any to be honeſt or to practiſe charitie, which were bound by the lawes of nature to pitie their kinſfolkes? and that lawe was in deede to ſhamefull and moſt cruell exceedinge all paciencie of nature, vnto the which there was a penaltie annexed, that ſuch as had miniſtred of their charitie, were puniſhed alike with them vnto whome it was miniſtred, and ſuch as had ſhewed any kindnes towards them, were fettered, impriſoned, and puniſhed alike with the afflicted. Such were the conſtitutions of Licinnius. To what purpoſe ſhal repeate his practiſes toutching marriage, and his innouations toutching deade men, whereby he preſumed to aboliſhe the auncient lawes of the Romaines well and wiſely ordained: and brought in certaine barbarous and cruell lawes in deede very vniuſt and vnlawfull, and infinite fained leaſings, the which he deuiſed againſt the nations ſubiect to his dominion, ſundry taxes of golde and ſiluer, ſurueying of lands, gainfull penalties vpon the men throughout the contrey which then liued not, but of olde were deſeaſed: and to be ſhort the enemy of all goodnes, deuiſed for ſwearing of the lande to ſuch entent and purpoſe againſt them which had done no harme, and doyng away of noble and honeſt perſonages, whoſe youthly &amp; tender wiues being ſeuered from their huſbands he deliuered to ſeruants of his to be contumeliouſly and ſhamefully handled, &amp; many maried wiues, virgines and maydens, hath he ſhamefully abuſed (though he being nowe in his latter dayes, and as it were at deaths dore) to the ſatiſfying of his lecherous and beaſtlie luſt. to what end ſhal I vſe many words in this matter, when as the exceſſe of his later doings, made the former which were ſmall, to ſeeme in maner noth
                           •
                        g. Wherfore his later madnes aſſaulted the biſhops, he tooke thē in ſo much they were worſhippers of almightie God, to be enemies to his doings, whome he tooke in hand, though not openly, for feare of the ſuperior, yet againe in ſecrete and deceatfully, and 
                           •
                        lew through wiles diuers of the beſt approued gouernours. The maner of that ſlaughter he vſed, was ſtraunge and neuer heard of before, his practiſes about Amaſia &amp; the other cities of Pontus, exceede all that paſſe in crueltie: where he ouerthrewe ſome of the churches of God euen to the pauements, ſhut vp others, leſt that any in them ſhould aſſemble after the wonted maner, and performe the ſeruice dew vnto God. neither was he perſwaded that they in them prayed for him, becauſe he was of a corrupt conſcience, but thought that we made ſupplicatiō vnto God, and did all for the godly Emperour Conſtantine, &amp; for this cauſe he brake out into a furious rage againſt vs. Moreouer the flattering preſidents ſuppoſinge in this behalfe to gratifie the miſchieuous tyrant, tormented ſome of the biſhops, as lewde perſons are puniſhed, led them forth, and puniſhed without cauſe ſuch as had committed none euill as if they had bene murtherers: wherof ſome endured a more ſtraunge death, their bodies cutt in many ſmall peeces, as bouchers do vſe, and after this cruell and horrible ſpectacle, throwen into the bottomleſſe goulfe of the ſurginge ſea, to become foode for fiſhes. While theſe things were a doyng, againe the flight of godly men beganne, and againe the fieldes, and againe the deſerts, the woods and mountaines receaue the worſhippers of Chriſt. When theſe things in this ſort preuailed with the wicked tyrant, he thought thenceforth to rayſe perſecution agaynſt all, and had brought his purpoſe to paſſe (for there was nothing to hinder him from this hainous offence) vnleſſe that God which fighteth for the ſoules of his ſeruāts, had ſpeedely foreſtopped &amp; preuented his malicious enterpriſe, and had brought forth with a mightie arme in defence of the quarell his ſeruant Conſtantinus a defender of all the godly, as it were a great lyght in a darke and thicke miſtie night.

                        Conſtantinus after that he ouer came Licinnius enioyed the empire alone, fauored the Chriſtians, and reſtored peace.
                     
                     GOd from aboue graunted vnto this man, this deſerued frute of godlineſſe, to wete victorie and triumphant ſignes againſte wicked perſons, and brought ſubiect the vngracious tyrant together with all his counſellers and friends euen groueling at the feete of Cōſtātine, For when he was fallen into extreme folly, the godly emperour &amp; furtherer of chriſtiā religion, perceauing that he was no longer to be borne withall, weyed this matter wiſely, &amp; mingling the ſeueritie of iuſtice with the clemencie of his nature, thought beſt with voluntarie mind, to delider from iniury ſuch as were oppreſſed by the tyrant. And to the ende he might ſaue many, he went about to cutt of a few hurtfull &amp; peſtilent perſons. For when as Conſtantinus in times paſt had vſed clemencie and pitied him, which was worthy of no compaſſion at all, therby Licinnius enioyed no great commoditie for that he forſooke not his malice, but rather encreaſed his rage againſte the nations ſubiect vnto him, for them, to wete, being oppreſſed &amp; wearied by the ſauadge beaſt, there remained no hope of ſaluation. Wherfore the defender of pietie ioyned the hatred of the euill with the loue of goodnes, &amp; together with his ſonne Crispus, the moſt clement emperour he went forth to battaile, and ſtretched forth his helping hande vnto all that were oppreſſed. Theſe therefore together, the father and the ſonne, vſing for guide and helper God the ſupreme king and the ſonne of God the ſauiour of the whole worlde, hauinge both on euery ſide ſcattered the armies of the enemies of God, and all the aduerſaries in that conflict by the power of God, (eden as they wiſhed) being foyled and ouerthrowen: they gott an eaſie and a ſpeedy victorie. Immediatly then, ſooner then the word vttered, they which yeſter nyght and the day before breathed out preſent death and threaming thunder bolts of fiery perſecution were not afterwardes remembred, no, not as much as once by name, their tytles and honors had deſerued ſhame and ignominie, and Licinnius him ſelfe ſuffred the ſelfe ſame things a like, the which he ſawe with his eyes to chaunce vnto the wicked tyrantes his predeceſſors. For be admitted no correction, neither aduiſed him ſelfe by the ſtripes of his kinſfolkes, but treadinge with them the ſame path of impietie, is brought by iuſte iudgement into the ſame downefall. and thus was this man proſtrated. Conſtantinus then beyng renowmed for euery rare vertue and godlineſſe, being alſo chiefe conquerour: together with his ſonne Crispus the moſt godly emperour, like vnto his father in all things, tooke the eaſterne and the Romaine empire of old time one, &amp; brought ſubiect to their peace from the Eaſt euery where throughout both parts of the world, North and South, euen vnto the fartheſt place of the VVeſt. All the feare of them by whome they were afore time oppreſſed was taken away, and wiped from of the face of the earth, they celebrated ſolemne and royall feaſts. All was repleniſhed with the bryght beames of ioye and gladneſſe, and they which afore time full ſadly beheld eche other, now they do it with gladſome countenance and cheerefull eyes, they honored before all thinges (for ſo they were inſtructed) the ſupreme kinge, next the godly emperour together with his ſonnes beloued of God, with daunces and hymnes throughout townes and contries. Moreouer all olde iniurie was forgotten, neither was there mention of any mans impietie at all, but the enioyinge of preſent proſperitie, and the expectation of goodneſſe to come. The conſtitutions of the victorious emperour, full of clemencie and lawes containing manifeſt tokens of bountifulneſſe and true pietie, were euery where proclaymed. Thus therefore all tyrannie beyng rooted out, the empire fitte and dew for Constantinus and his ſonnes was preſerued firme and free from all enuye, who, wyping away all impietie of their predeceſſors in lyfe, and enioying meryly all the benefits beſt owed from aboue, haue ſett forth by their lawes, decreed in the behalfe of the Chriſtians, the ſtudy of vertue, and loue, and pietie towards God, with thankfulneſſe of minde.

I reade that Origen was of a long tyme in one houſe together at bedd and borde with an olde hereticke whoſe name was Paulus: I ſee that Euſebius highly commendeth the heretick Tatianus for his booke againſt the Gentiles, he extolleth alſo Bardeſanes the Syrian, who was a Valentian hereticke: I finde that Dionyſius Biſhop of Alexandria reuerenced wonderfully the perſon of Nepos the Chiliaſt, he doubted not to affirme that his ſoule was in reſt: yet as we may in no wiſe call Origen an heretick for his familiaritye with Paulus: neyther Euſebius a Tatian or Valentinian for commending of Tatianus and Bardeſanes, neyther Dionyſius a Chiliaſt for extolling of Nepos, no more may we call

                     Socrates a Nouatian for his familiaritie with Auxanon and prayſing of the Nouatians. where he commendeth the Nouatians, where he maketh report of Auxanon, where alſo he excuſeth him ſelfe, his wordes are theſe. I haue learned moreouer (ſayth Socrates)Socrat. li. 1. cap. 9. that Eutychianus a man of ſyncere religion floriſhed about that time, who though he were of the Nouatian ſect, yet did he many ſtraunge things. I will reueale him that reported me his doings, neyther will I cloke or conceale that at all, though therefore I may ſeeme to incurre ſuſpicion or the reprehenſion of diuers perſons. It was Auxanon a prieſt of the Nouatian Church. In an other place he commendeth the NouatiansSocrat. li. 2. cap. 30. for embracing the Nicene Creede, for ioyning with the true Chriſtians agaynſt the Arian heretickes: who woulde not in like ſorte commende them for the ſame? he ſayth further that almoſt they had bene at vnitie with the true Catholicks, had not the fault bene in the Nouatians them ſelues. What other thing is this then commending of them for well doing and reprehending of them for ill doing? is he therefore to be termed a Nouatian? This Nicephorus ſticked not in like ſorte to call Euſebius an Arian,Socrat. lib. 1. cap. 5. lib. 2. cap. 17. who as it is well knowen vnto the whole worlde was at the councell of Nice, wrote the creede &amp; condemned Arius with his owne hand. ſure I am of this, that toutching the hiſtory, this Nicephorus hath patched together out of Euſebius, Socrates, Euagrius &amp; other auncient writers: if euery birde tooke her fether from him there woulde be nothing left of his owne parte but fables. Tritenhemius wrote reuerently of this author in this ſorte: Socrates by byrth a Grecian, a learned and an eloquent man, a notable Hiſtoriographer,Tritenhemius li. de eccl, ſcrip. of great fame by reaſon of his profounde ſkill: wrote a volume containing the Eccleſiaſticall hiſtory from the raygne of Conſtantinus magnus the firſte Emperour of that name vnto the raygne of Theodoſius iunior.

                        When Alexander had wrytten theſe letters vnto the byſhops euery where throughout the ſeuerall cities, this peſtilence infection hereby was the more ſcattered abrode, becauſe that theſe vnto whome theſe letters were directed beganne to burne amonge themſelues with the ſparcles of contention and diſcorde. For ſome condeſcended and ſubſcribed vnto the letters: ſome others with all might impugned them. But ſpecially amonge all the reſt Euſebius byſhop of Nicomedia was prouoked to the ſchiſme and diſſention, for that Alexander had often in his letters charged him by name. And at that time Euſebius was able to do much, becauſe that the emperour then made his abode at Nicomedia, where Diocletian a litle before had buylded a princely pallace. For which cauſe many byſhops fauored the opinion of Euſebius. But he ſeaſed not to wryte vnto Alexander that he woulde lette paſſe the controuerſie rayſed betwene them: that he woulde admitte againe Arius and his adherentes into the churche: and others alſo throughout the cities he exhorted that they ſhoulde by no meanes condeſcende vnto the drifte of Alexander. whereby theyr roſe euery where no ſmale tumult. For then a man might haue ſeene not onely the preſidentes and chiefe rulers of the churches, inueying one againſt an other with ſpitefull and opprobrious tearmes: but alſo the laye multitude ſeuered a ſunder into two partes, the one fauoring the one ſide, the other, the other ſide. Wherefore the caſe became ſo haynous and ſhamefull, and into ſo lamentable a plighte that the chriſtian religion was openly derided of all men, euen in the publique theatres and ſolemne ſpectacles. The inhabitors of Alexandria contended very childiſhely, yea without all modeſtie about the chiefe poinctes of chriſtian religion, they ſente alſo legates and embaſſadours vnto the byſhops throughout the other prouinces, who ſeueringe themſelues vnto eyther ſide, rayſed the like contention. The Meletians who not longe before were cutt of from the churche, ioyned themſelues
                        The meletiā heretickes ioyne with the Arians. Meletius why he was depriued by Peter byſhop of Alexandria. 
                        with the Arians. I thinke it expedient to note what kinde of men they are. Meletius byſhop of a certaine citie in Aegypte, beſides ſundrye other cauſes, ſpecially for that in the tyme of perſecution he had renounced the fayth, and ſacrificed to Idols, was depriued of his byſhoricke by Peter byſhop of Alexandria, which ſuffred Martyrdome, vnder Diocletian. Who beinge depriued and fauored of many for all his fonde doinges, became the ringeleader of the hereſie, amonge them, who in Aegypt, of him vnto this preſent daye are called Meletians, and hauinge no iuſte cauſe or cloke to defende his doinges, in that he preſumed to ſeparate himſelfe from the churche, made a ſleeueleſſe anſwere: ſayinge that he was greatly iniuryed, wherefore he brake out into
                        
                        raylinge ſpeaches and reuiled Peter. And as ſoone as Peter, in that heate of perſecution, had ended his life with Martyrdome, he poſted ouer his opprobrious tearmes and rayling ſpeaches to the paintinge of Achillas who ſucceeded Peter in the ſeae of Alexandria. And laſt of all he leueled the pearcinge dartes of ſpitefull language at Alexander, who after the death of Achillas was there placed byſhop. While this tumulte and diſſention was toſſed to and froe, the opinion of Arius was called into controuerſie, then Meletius with his complices tooke part with Arius, and together with him conſpired againſt the byſhop. But they vnto whome the opinion of Arius ſeemed abſurde, approued of Alexanders ſentence toucchinge Arius, and affirmed the condemnation pronounced agaynſt ſuche as were of that opinion to be iuſte and accordinge to right. But Euſebius byſhop of Nicomedia, and as many as fauored the fonde opinion of Arius, wrote vnto Alexander that he ſhoulde reuoke the depriuation and digraduation paſt, and admitte into the churche, ſuche as were excommunicated and excluded the companye of the faithfull, and that they maintained no deteſtable doctrine at all. So then when of eyther ſide letters were brought vnto Alexander byſhop of Alexandria, the letters of both ſides were gathered together into one, Arius tooke ſuch as were in his behalfe, Alexander gathered the contrary. Here occaſion was miniſtred vnto the hereticall ſectes of the Arians, Eunomians, and Macedonians which in theſe dayes diſperſe themſelues abrode, to defende theyr damnable doctrine.

                           Hereby I gather the originall grounde of this controuerſie in that thou Alexander haſt demaunded of the elders toutching a certaine place of holy Scripture yea rather toutching a certaineThe epiſtle of Conſtantinus vnto Alexander &amp; Arius takē out of the 2. booke of Eu ſebius of the life of Conſtantine. vaine peece of a queſtion, vvhat euery ones opinion vvas: and thou Arius haſt vnaduiſedly blaſed abrode and ſett abroche that vvhich thou shouldeſt not at the firſt haue conceaued, and hauing conceaued it, thou shouldeſt haue paſt it ouer vvith ſilence. VVhereby this diſſention is riſen among you, the vvonted aſſembly of the church hindred, the moſt deuout people diuerſly diſtracted into ether ſide &amp; rente a ſunder, being afore time one body cōpacted together in harmoniacal vnity. wherefore let ether of you, pardoning ech other, like of that the which your felowe miniſter not without cauſe exhorteth you vnto: and what is that? that you neyther obiecte at all, neither anſwer any obiection that concerne ſuch matters. For ſuch queſtions as no law or eccleſiaſticall canon neceſſarily defineth, but the fruteleſſe contention of idle braine ſetteth abrode, though the exerciſe thereof auaile for the sharpening of the witt, yet ought we to retaine them within the inner cloſett of our mind, &amp; not rashly to broch them in the publique aſſembly of the vulgare people, neither vnaduiſedly to graunt the common ſorte the hearing thereof. For hovve many be there that can worthely explicate &amp; ſufficiētly ponder the weyght of ſo graue, ſo intricate, and ſo obſcure a matter? but if there be any ſuch that perſuadeth himſelfe able eaſily to compaſſe and to attaine vnto it, howe many partes are there (I beſeche you) of the multitude whome he can ſufficiently inſtruct therein? and who is there in ſifting out ſo curious a queſtion that can well paſſe the perill of plunging error? wherefore in ſuche caſes we muſt refrayne from verball diſputations leſt that ether we by reaſon of the imbecillity of our witt, can not explicate

our minde, ether our auditors when we teach by reaſon of theyr dull capacity can not comprehende the curious drift of our doctrine, whereby the people of neceſſity incurreth the daūger ether of blaſphemye or the poyſoned infection of diſcorde. wherefore both the rashe obiection, and the vnaduiſed anſwere (being cauſe of the heretical ſectes of the Arians, Eunomians, and of as many as fauor the like folly ought ere other of ech other craue pardone. Neither is there occaſion miniſtred to cōtende about the chiefeſt commaundement in holy Scripture, neither is there ſprong any new opinion toutching the ſeruice of God: for you retaine the on and the ſame ſentence in ſubſtance of fayth, ſo that you may eaſily embrace the vniforme conſent of vnity &amp; cō
                              cordo. For it is not well that for your contention about ſo ſclender matters and trifling toyes, ſo great a multitude of the people of God through your negligence should be at ſuch diſcorde among themſelues. Yea it is ſuppoſed not onely not well, but alltogether intollerable.

If then the caſe be thus, why may it not be thought farre more expediēt that we wearing the cognizance of theBrethren and chriſtiās may not brawle cōtentiouſly about words. moſt mighty God, euen for the chriſtian religion the which we profeſſe, should be at peace &amp; vnity among our ſelues? but let vs vveygh more diligently and conſider more deepely vvith our ſelues, vvhat I shall novve ſay: vvhether it be right or reaſon that for light and vayne contention about vvordes, one brother should diſſent from an other, and the renovvmed peace by peſtilent diſcord through vs vvhich ſpite one an other for ſclender &amp; vnneceſſary matters should thus miſerably be prophaned and rent in peces.

But the byshop of the princely cytye by reaſon of his olde age abſented himſelfe, yet there vvere then preſente of his clergie vvhich ſupplied his rovvme. Suche a garlande of immortall memory, tvviſted the emperour Conſtantine beinge but one, through the bonde of vnity vnto the glory of Chriſt: and to the ende he mighte be founde thankefull vnto his Sauiour, he ſett vp that renovvmed ſigne of victory agaynſt the enemye, liuely reſemblinge in this our aſſemblie the Apoſtolicke quire. For it is wrytten that in thoſe tymes there were gathered together holy men of euery nation vvhich is vnder heauen, amonge vvhome there vvere Parthians, Medes, Elamits, and inhabitors of Meſopotamia, Iudaea, and Cappadocia, Pontus and Aſia, Phrygia and Pamphilia, Aegypte and the partes of Libya vvhiche is beyonde Cyren, ſtraungeres of Rome, Ievves and Proſelytes, Cretes and

The number of Bishops in this aſſemblie vvas three hundred and ouer, but of Prieſtes, Deacons, Acolyts, and others vvhich accompanyed them the number coulde not be tolde. And of the miniſters of God, ſome for their ſage and ſober ſpeache, ſome for their grauitie in life, and patience in aduerſitie, ſome other for their trade of liuing as meane betwene both vvere highly commended.

And ſo farre out of Euſebius toutching that aſſemblie. When the Emperour had finiſhed the triumphe ſolemnized in remembrance of his victorie againſt Licinnius, he tooke his iorney vnto Nicaea.

                        Thebais, and Spiridion biſhop of Cyprus were recounted famous. But the cauſe that moued vs to rehearſe them, hereafter ſhalbe ſhewed. There were preſent alſo many of the laytie which were ſkilfull logicians, ready to defend ereother part. Euſebius biſhop of Nicomedia (as I haue ſayde before) Theognis and Maris maintayned the opinion of Arius. This Theognis was biſhop of Nicaea, and Maris biſhop of Chalcedon a cytie of Bithynia.

Before the biſhops mett together in one place, the logicians buſted them ſelues propoundinge againſt diuersMaris an Arian. others certaine preambles of diſputation, and when diuers were thus drawen to diſputation, and allured as it were by bayte: a lay man one of the number of confeſſors, of a ſimple &amp; ſyncere mindAthanaſius. Alexander. ſett himſelfe againſt the Logicians, and tolde them thus in playne wordes: that neyther Chriſt, neither his Apoſtles had deliuered vnto vs the arte of Logicke, neyther vayne fallacies, but an open and plaine minde to be preſerued of vs with faith and good works. The which when he had ſpoken, all that were preſent had him in admiration, and helde with his ſentence. Then the LogiciansRuffinus in his firſt boke cap. 3. layeth downe the circūſtances of this hiſtorie more at large. after they had heard the pure words of playne trueth quieted and ſetled them ſelues aright. So that at length by that meanes the ſturre rayſed by occaſion of Logicke, was wholly ſuppreſſed. The day after all the biſhops mett in one place, after them came the Emperour, beinge come he ſtandeth in the middeſt, neither woulde he firſt ſit downe, before he had beckened to the biſhops to do the ſame.

When that he had largely entreated of concord and peace to be preſerued amonge them, he referred vnto their diſcretion to diſcerne more exquiſitely of the principlesMat. 18. of Chriſtian religion, euen as the ſelfe ſame Euſebius reporteth in his thirde booke of the lyfe of Conſtantine, whoſe allegation may preſently ſeeme very commodious. For thus he wryteth: VVhen many thinges of eyther ſyde vvere alleadged, and a greate controuerſie rayſed

                        euen at the entrance into diſputation, the Emperour gaue pacient and peaceable eare vnto all, he receaued theire poſitions vvith earneſt and carefull ſtudie: ſome tymes he holpe in reaſoninge ere other parte: vvhen that they diſputed vvith heate of contention he reconciled them by little and little: he conferred vvith euery one louingly and curteouſly: he vttered his minde in Greeke, neither was he ignorant of that language. his ſpeache was both ſweete and pleaſaunt, perſwading with ſome, pacifying ſome other vvith gentle vvordes, prayſing others for their ſage ſentences. He ceaſed not to reduce them all vnto concorde, vntill that he had brought them to that paſſe, that they all became of one mind, and concluded with one opinion toutching all the thinges that euer toe fore vvere called into queſtion, ſo that not onely there florished among thē one faith: but alſo they agreed all together to celebrate the ſolempne feaſt of Eaſter at one and the ſame tyme throughout the vvorlde.

Theſe things hath Euſebius to like purpoſe rehearſed and left behinde him in writing, neither haue we in this place cyted them out of ſeaſon, yea we haue vſed his words forHe cōfuteth the ſclaunderous report which Sabinus made of the biſhops aſſembled in the councell of Nice. witneſſes and knitte them to this our hiſtorie, to the ende we geue not eare vnto ſome which haue condemned the counſell aſſembled at Nice, as though it had crred in the fayth: againe that we creditt not Sabinus the Macedonian, who called the men that mett there, idiots and rude perſons. For this Sabinus biſhop of the Macedonians, which inhabit Heraclaea a citie of Thracia, whileſt that he gathereth into one volume thoſe things which diuers councells and aſſemblies of biſhops haue committed to writing, he condemneth with opprobrious languages the biſhops which mett at Nice for vnlearned and ignorant men. not remembring that in ſo doing he cōdemneth Euſebius for an idiote, who publiſhed the ſame faith with the greate tryall and experience he had therein. Moreouer ſome things of ſett purpoſe he ouerſkippeth: ſome other he peruerteth: thoſe thinges which ſeemed to make for his purpoſe which tended to the marke he ſhott at, all thoſe he culled out diligently. And though he praiſeth Euſebius Pamphilus for a witneſſe to whome creditt may worthely begeuen, and though he hyghly commende the Emperour as one that preuayled very much in the eſtabliſhing of Chriſtian religion, yet for all that doth he reprehende the faith publiſhed in the councell of Nice, as deliuered by ſuch as were rude and all together vnlearned. And whome he calleth a wiſe man, and counteth a true witneſſe, the ſame mans teſtimonie of ſett purpoſe doth he reiect. For Euſebius reporteth that of the miniſters of God which then were preſent, ſome excelled for their ſage and ſober ſentences, ſome for their grauitie of life, and that the emperour with his preſence reduced them all vnto concorde, and linked them together in one mind and in one opinion. but of Sabinus if tyme do ſerue and occaſion hereafter be offred, we will ſay more.

It may not be that an immateriall, an intellectuall, and an incorporeall nature should admitt or be ſubiect to any corporall paſſion, for it behoueth vs to conceaue ſuch myſteries vvith ſacred and ſecrett termes. Our moſt ſage and vertuous Emperour reaſoned of theſe thinges after this ſort. The bishops becauſe of the clauſe, Of one ſubstance, published this forme of faith: VVe beleue in one God the father almighty maker of all things viſible &amp; inuiſible, and in one Lord Ieſus Chriſt the ſonne of God, the onely begotten ſonne of the father, that is of the ſubſtance of the father, God of God, light of light, very God of very God, begottē not made, being of one ſubſtāce with the father, by whome all things were made, both the things in heauē &amp; the things in earth. who for vs men &amp; for our ſaluation came downe, &amp; was incarnate, he was made man, he ſuffred &amp; roſe

Therefore they which ſay that there was a time when he was not, before he was begotten, or that he had his beginninge of nothinge, or that he is of an other ſubſtāce or eſſēce, or that affirme the ſonne of God to be made, or to be cōuertible or mutable: theſe the Catholicke &amp; Apoſtolicke church of God doth pronounce for accurſed▪ whē they had preſcribed this forme of faith, we ceaſed not diligētly to demaund of thē how they vnderſtoode that ſentēce, To be of the ſubstāce of the father. &amp; that: to be of one ſubſtance with the father. wherevpō there roſe obiectiōs &amp; reſolutiōs, ſo that the right ſēſe of the foreſayd ſentēces was curiouſly
                        Of the ſubſtance. 
                        ſought out. They ſayd that, to be Of one ſubſtāce, ſignified nothing elſe thē to be of the father, yet not to be as a part of the father. This ſeemed vnto vs very well to agree with the expoſitiō of that bleſſed doctrine which teacheth the ſonne to be of the father, yet not to be part of his ſubſtāce.
                        
                        VVherefore vve accorded vvith this ſentence, neither reiected vve the clauſe Of one ſubstance, becauſe that peace vvas placed before our eyes as a marke to beholde, and moreouer vve had ſpeciall care not to fall from the faith. In like maner vve approued Begotten, not made. For Made
                        
                        Begotten not made. 
                        they counted a common vvorde vvith other creatures vvhich vvere made by the ſonne, that the ſonne had nothinge in him vvhich reſembled or vvas like vnto them, and for that cauſe he vvas not a creature like vnto thoſe vvhich vvere made by him, but of a farr more excellēt ſubſtāce thē any creature is framed, the which holy ſcripture declareth to be begottē of the father: inaſmuch as no mortall nature can either by vvord expreſſe, or by thought comprehende or attaine vnto the maner of his generation. In like ſort alſo that clauſe: The ſonne to be of one ſubstance with the

And that To be of one ſubstance vvith the father, ſignified no other thing, then that the ſonne of God vvas in nothing like the reſt of the creatures, but altogether like vnto the father alone vvhich begate him, neither begotten of any oother then of the fathers ſubſtance and eſſence, vnto the vvhich thinge thus ſett forth, right and reaſon required that vve should condeſcende.

And withall we thought good to ratifie the forme of curſe published after the expoſition of the faith, becauſe that it forbiddeth that no man do acquaint him ſelfe vvith forreyne ſpeaches and vnwritten languages, vvhereby in maner all confuſion and diſcord is drawen and crept into the churche, vvhen as the ſacred ſcripture maketh mention no vvhere of any ſuch ſentences, to vvete: That the ſonne of God had his beginning of nothing, and that there vvas a time vvhen he vvas not. And ſuch like ſentences it ſeemed not agreable vvith reaſon either in vvordes to talke of them, or in deede to teache them. Vnto vvhich notable decree vve haue ſubſcribed, although heretofore vve neuer accuſtomed neither acquainted our ſelues vvith ſuch ſpeaches. Theſe things (vvelbeloued) vve haue neceſſarily ſent vnto you, not onely to certifie you of the cenſure concluded of vs after our curious ſifting and aſſent, but alſo to let you vnderſtande that while at the firſt the diuerſitie of reports written vnto you offended vs not a little, we perſiſted in one &amp; the ſame mind (as it was moſt meete) euen to the laſt houre. But afterwards with ſmall adoe, we embraced without any diſquietnes at all ſuch things as were not offenſiue, when as we with tractable mind ſought out the ſenſe and vnderſtanding of the words which vvere then in controuerſie, and found them altogether agreable vvith the thinges contayned in the forme of fayth published by vs our ſelfe. Theſe things did Euſebius Pamphilus ſende in writing vnto Caeſarea in Palaeſtina.

                               (for by iuſt iudgement he was worthy of no pardon) decreed that he should remaine in his proper city, that he should haue no authoritie to make miniſters, no authoritie to aduaūce any vnto the eccleſiaſticall function, neither to appeare or preſent him ſelfe in any other region or in any other citie for that purpoſe, but onely to retayne the bare name and title of his office and dignitie: they decreed farther toutching ſuch as were entred into holy orders by his laying on of hāds, that they after confirmation vvith more myſticall laying on of handes should be admitted into the fellovvship of the church, with this condition: that they shoulde enioye their dignitie &amp; degree of the miniſterie, yet that they be inferiour vnto all the paſtors throughout euery prouince and churche, the vvhich the moſt honorable man and our college Alexander hath ordayned.

But of Meletius namely it is otherwiſe decreede, to wete, that both for his inſolent boldnes, wherewith heretofore he moleſted the quiet eſtate of the church, and alſo for his temeritie and wilfull ignorance openly shewed, he shoulde haue neither power, neither authoritie geuen him, for in that he is a man, he may agayne vexe the churche with the like diſorder.

We haue moreouer to vnderſtād, that Arius wrote a booke of his opinion, the which he intituled Thalia, the ſtyle &amp; phraſe of the booke is both wanton and diſſolute, reſembling in all poynts the bawdy ballets and rymes of the wanton poet Sotades. the which booke alſo the councell then dyd condemne.

How great &amp; what horrible blaſphemies (God of his goodnes be mercifull vnto vs) haue ſome vnreuerently vttered againſt our great ſauiour, againſt our hope and life, and impudētly not only blaſed things cōtrary vnto the ſcriptures inſpired from aboue &amp; the ſacred faith, but alſo affirmed they beleued the ſame? For vvhen as three hundreth bishops and aboue, men of great fame both for modeſtie of minde &amp; sharpneſſe of witt, had confirmed one &amp; the ſame faith, which was founde to be a true faith by the trueth it ſelfe, and playne teſtimonies of holie ſcripture ſought out for the purpoſe: Arius alone was found (beyng ouercome with the power and fraude of the deuill) to fall from the ſame: and beynge prone therevnto through the peruerſitie of his minde, ſcattered and ſovved firſt of all amongeſt you, aftervvardes amongeſt vs, this poyſoned errour of perdition. VVherefore lett vs embrace that doctrine vvhich almightie God, the father of heauen hath deliuered vnto vs: let vs returne vnto our dearely beloued brethren vvhome the wicked &amp; impudēt miniſter of Satan hath ſeuered aſunder: let vs vvith might and mayne, and (as commonly vve ſay) vvith all the vaynes in our hart, go home agayne vnto the generall ſocietie and body of the church, and vnto our ovvne naturall members. This aboue all other things behoueth your wiſdome, your faith &amp; holines, after the remouīg frō your minds the cākred poyſō of the aduerſary, who ſet him ſelfe oppoſite againſt the trueth: that without all delaye ye haue recourſe vnto the grace and goodnes of almightie God. For that which ſeemed good vnto the three hūdred bishops, is no othervviſe to be taken then for the ſentence of God, ſpecially in as much as the holie Ghoſt vvas reſiant in the mindes of ſo vvorthie and ſo notable men, inſpiring them vvith the deuine vvill of God him ſelfe.

                        This the Emperour wrote vnto the people of Alexandria; ſignifying in playne words that the finall concluſion &amp; definitiue ſentēce of the faith was not layde downe vnaduiſedly, neither came to paſſe by happe hazard: but after great labour &amp; induſtrie, after diligent ſearching and ſifting out of the trueth, to haue bene publiſhed by the councell: and not ſome thinges to haue bene handled, ſome other things to haue bene omitted: but all whatſoeuer ſeemed neceſſary to be entreated of, toutching the confirmation of y• doctrine of faith, to haue bene ſufficiently diſcourſed: neither to haue bene firſte vnaduiſedly decreed, before all were curiouſly handled, in ſo much that all what ſo euer ſeemed to breede occaſion of controuerſie or diſcord, was quite plucked vp by the rootes. But (that I may vtter all in one word) Conſtantine calleth the cenſure of the whole aſſembly, the ſentence of God him ſelfe, neither doubted he but that ſo great a company of biſhops was vnited &amp; linked together in one mind &amp; in one opinion by y• motion &amp; inſtinct of the holy ghoſt. Yet for all this, Sabinus who is the ringleader of the Macedonian hereſie, wilfully and of ſett purpoſe impugneth theſe thinges: yea moreouer he termeth ſuch as mett at Nice, vnlearned and doultiſhe idiots: neither is he aſhamed to charge Euſebius biſhop of Caeſarea with the reprochefull ſpot and blemiſhe of ignorance, neither weyeth he this with him ſelfe, that ſuch as were preſent at the coū
                           cell, though they were vnlearned men (as he reporteth) yet being inſpired from aboue, &amp; endued with the grace of the ſpirite of God, could in no wiſe ſtraye from the trueth. But let vs heare what the Emperour layde downe in other letters againſt the opinions of Arius and his complices, the which alſo he ſent abroade vnto the biſhops and congregations throughout chriſtendome.

Inaſmuch as Arius traceth the ſtepps of deteſtable &amp; impious perſons: it is requiſite that he be partaker with them of the ſelfe ſame infamie and reproche. For as Porphyrius the ſvvorne aduerſarie &amp; deadly foe of deuine ſeruice, vvho lately published levvde cōmentaries, in the cōfutation &amp; defiance of Chriſtian religion, vvas revvarded according vnto his deſert, and ſo recōpenced that within the cōpaſſe of theſe fewe yeares he was not only grieued with great reproche, &amp; blemished with the shamefull ſpot of infamie, but alſo his impious &amp; blaſphemous works, perished &amp; vtterly were abolished: euen ſo now it ſeemed good vnto vs to call Arius &amp; his complices, the vvicked broode of Porphyrius, that looke vvhoſe maners they haue imitated, they may enioye alſo the priuiledge of their name. Moreouer we thought good, that if there can be founde extant any worke or booke compiled by Arius, the ſame shoulde be burned to ashes, ſo that not only his damnable doctrine may thereby he vvholly rooted out: but alſo that no relique thereof may remaine vnto the poſteritie.

                              COnstantinus the Emperour vnto the churches throughout chriſtēdome ſendeth greeting.Cōſtantinus the Emperour vnto the churches, &amp;c VVhen as I perceaued by the florishing &amp; proſperous eſtate of the publicke weale, how greatly we are beholding vnto the goodnes of almightie God conferred vpon vs: I deemed that aboue all things it behoued me of dutie to foreſee, that in the moſt holy and ſacred aſſemblies of the Catholicke church vnder heauen, there shold one faith, ſyncere loue &amp; charitie, vniforme conſent &amp; agreement toutching the religion &amp; ſeruice of almightie God, vnuiolably be retayned. But ſithence that the ſame could by no other way or meanes be compaſſed, neither in any other ſure or certaine place be ſetled, vnleſſe that either all the bishops, or at leſtvviſe the greater part of them aſſembled together, &amp; layde downe their ſeuerall cenſures concerning the moſt holy religion &amp; ſeruice of God: therfore when the greateſt company that coulde be gott, mette together, I my ſelfe as one of your number, vvas preſent vvith them. Neyther tooke I in ſcorne (vvhereat novve I greatly reioyce) that I coupled my ſelfe vvith you in thoſe affayres.

VVe proceeded ſo farre in the premiſſes, and handled all thinges ſo exquiſitely, vntill the ſentence vvhich ſeemed gratefull and acceptable vnto God the ouerſeer of all thinges, for the concorde and conſent in religion vvas openly pronounced, ſo that there remayned nothinge hereafter to be concluded vpon, vvhich ſeemed to tende or grovve either vnto diſcorde or diſagreement toutchinge the faith. VVhen as there at that tyme vve reaſoned of the moſt ſacred ſolemnitie and feaſt of Eaſter, it ſeemed good by vniforme conſent of all, that all men, in all places shoulde celebrate it, vpon one and the ſelfe ſame daye. for vvhat vvas there more auaylable? vvhat could there be more glorious, then that this feaſt (vvhereby vve retaine and holde faſt the firme hope of immortalitie) shoulde, after one and the ſame order, and after the ſame manifeſt trade, vvithout noueltie or alteration be obſerued? and firſt of all it ſeemed altogether contrary to order, that in the celebration of the ſayd moſt ſacred feaſt, we should imitate the rites &amp; maner of the Iewes, who in as much as they haue defiled their hāds with an hainous offence, reaſon it is as impure perſons their minds should be helde ſnared in blindneſſe. It remayneth therefore that vve lay aſide theyr cuſtome, and publishe for a remembrance vnto the poſteritie in tyme to come the celebration of this feaſte after a truer &amp; more ſyncere inſtitution, the vvhich vnto this preſent time from the firſt day of the paſſion we haue obſerued. VVherfore let vs haue nothing common, with that moſt odious broode of the Iewes, for we are taught by our ſauiour to tread an other way the which we muſt cleaue vnto. there is layde downe a race &amp; a limite both decēt and lawfull for our moſt ſacred religion. let vs ioyntly retaine this with vniforme conſent (moſt honorable brethren) &amp; withdraw our ſelues from that deſpitefull nation. For in very deede it is the greateſt abſurditie that can be, for them arrogantly to vaunt that we can in no wiſe obſerue theſe things without the ayde and helpe of their diſcipline. VVhat is it whereof they are able to ſauour aright, who after they had put the Lord Ieſus to death, hauing remoued the right ſenſe of their minde out of his quiet ſeate, vvere caryed not vvith the vveyght of reaſon, but vvith an intollerable vvilfulneſſe of rashe enterpriſes, vvhither ſo euer the frenſie and madneſſe that vvas ingraffed in their mindes did leade them? And in this poynte it is apparent they ſee not the manifeſt trueth, (no maruell then they erre in many things) in that they beſides the appointed time for the celebration of this feſt, within the compaſſe of the ſelfe ſame yeare do celebrate a ſecond Eaſter. VVhat cauſe then shall moue vs to imitate theſe men, vvhome vve ſee thus manifeſtly infected vvith the grieuons maladie of errour? vve vvill in no vviſe permit the ſame feaſt in one and the ſame yeare the ſeconde time to be ſolemnized. If that I had bene careleſſe and buſyed my ſelfe herein nothinge at all, it had bene your parte and duetie to haue imployed both your diligence, and alſo with earneſt and continewall prayer to haue craued that the right rule and ſynceritie of your minds should in no wiſe participate, neither in any thing haue felowship with the vvicked vvayes of levvde perſons. Beſides all this, vve may eaſily perceaue hovve shamefull and deteſtable a thinge it is to diſſent and diſagree about ſo vveyghtie a matter, and about ſo hygh and ſo religious a feaſte. One feſtiuall daye of purchaſed freedome, to vvete, of the moſte bleſſed paſſion &amp; bloodsheding hath our ſauiour commended vnto vs, one catholicke churche he would haue to be collected of all, whoſe mēbers though they be many &amp; in ſūdry places diſperſed vnder heauē: yet do they knit &amp; cloſe together in one ſpirite, that is in the will &amp; pleaſure of almighty god. I would that of your wiſdome &amp; holines, you deepely weyed with your ſelues how diſordered &amp; vndecent a thing it is, vpō the ſelfe ſame dayes, for ſome religiouſly to faſt, &amp; for ſome others ryotouſly to feaſte it out: and after Eaſter holidayes, for ſome to feaſt, and yeld them ſelues to fullneſſe of pleaſure, for others to abſtayne, and obſerue the preſcribed dayes of faſtinge. VVherefore this is to be reformed, and reduced vnto one maner and cuſtome, this (as I am ſure you doe all, knowe very vvell) is the pleaſure of God him ſelfe. And in as much as the ſame is ryghtly to be redreſſed, that vve haue nothinge common vvith murtherers of fathers, and ſuch as haue putt theyr Lorde and mayſter to death: In as much as agayne that orderly, and comelie maner retayned of all the churches throughout the vvorlde, inhabiting either the VVeſt, the South, or the North, and in ſundrie places alſo of the Eaſt, vvas to be obſerued of vs: therefore it is that preſentlie all haue thought ryght vvell thereof. I my ſelfe alſo haue taken vpon myne ovvne perſon, your tractable vviſdome, that looke vvhat cuſtome ſoeuer vvith vniforme conſent, is of force in the citie of Rome, in Italie, &amp; Aphtick, in all Aegypt, Spaine, Fraunce and Bryttaine, Libya and all Greece, in the prouince of Aſia, Pontus, and Cilicia: the ſame alſo vvith vvilling and gratefull minds, should be ratified and approued

of you all. Conſidering of this carefully vvith your ſelues, that not onely the greater number of congregations lyeth in the places before mentioned: but alſo that it is a moſt godly purpoſe for all men ioyntly with one harte and voyce, to deſire that eſtablished, which right and reaſon requireth to be done, which alſo hath no fellowship with the damnable periurie of the deſpiteful Iewes. but that I may vtter the whole in fewe wordes, it ſeemed good by common aſſent of the whole aſſembly, that the moſt ſacred feaſte of Eaſter, shoulde be celebrated vpon one, and the ſelfe ſame daye. for it may not be that variance and diſſention shoulde raygne about the celebration of ſo holy, and ſo high a feaſt, yea moreouer it is very commendable to condeſcend vnto this ſentence, which is farre from all error that doth preiudice the faith, &amp; from all fellowship with shamefull ſinne. VVherefore the matter being brought to this paſſe, embrace this decre with willing mindes as an heauenly &amp; moſt godly commaundement. for whatſoeuer is decreeed in the holy councels of Bishops, the ſame is to be attributed to the will of God. VVherefore when you haue certified al our welbeloued brethren, of the canons of this councel, the ſentence already layd downe, &amp; the maner of celebrating the moſt holy feaſt, it is your parte to approue the ſame, and duely to obſerue it: that as ſoone as I can perceaue the right diſpoſition of you all, the vvhich of long tyme I haue deſired, I may vpon one, and the ſelfe ſame daye, together vvith you all, ſolemnize this moſt ſacred feaſte, and ioye for your ſakes: the vvhiche shall come to paſſe, if that I may vnderſtande, that not onely the ſpite and outragious dealing of the deuill, through your vvell doing, ayded from aboue, is vvholly put to flyght and abandoned from amongeſt you: but that alſo our fayth by reaſon of peace, and concorde, doth euery vvhere notably florishe. God preſerue you vvelbeloued brethren.

Euen as (welbeloued brother) I haue learned of a truth, and am fully perſwaded, that all Churches from the fundations, are either through negligence gone to decay, or through feare of the daūger that was like to enſue haue bene leſſe repayred then they should haue bene, yea vnto this preſent daye, by reaſon of the grieuous maladye of ſpite, and great tyrannye exerciſed vpon the Sainctes of God, and the ſeruants of our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt: ſo now liberty being reſtored vnto all men, and that dragon, and perſecutor Licinnius being foyled, &amp; the direction of eccleſiaſticall affayres remoued from the diſpoſition of the vulgar ſort, by the prouidence of Almighty God &amp; the vigilant labor of our miniſtery, I ſuppoſe that the power and might of God is made manifeſt vnto all men, &amp; that they which fell by reaſon of feare, or incredulitie, or other infirmitie whatſoeuer, in as much as nowe they acknowledge the true God in deede, will repent and returne vnto the true and right way. VVherefore what Churches ſo euer thou doeſt gouerne, or other places, where other Bishops, Prieſtes &amp; Deacons, of thy acquaintance, doe ouerſe, our will is, that thou admonish them all, that with watchful eye, the buildings of the churches be looked vnto: to the ende that ſuch as ſtande may be repayred, and alſo be enlarged, or elſe vvhere neceſſitie ſo conſtrayneth, they may be erected all new from the foundation. Looke what thinges are neceſſarily required for buildinge, ſee that either thou thy ſelfe, or ſome other in thy name, demaunde them of the Lieuetenants, or rulers of our prouinces. for vve haue ſignified vnto them by our letters, that vvith all celeritie and promptnes of minde they shall ſupplye the vvante of ſuch thinges as thine holines doth preſcribe. and thus vvelbeloued brother I committ thee to the tuition of Almighty God.

VVherefore accept vvith louing harte, vvhat our vvill and pleaſure is. VVe haue thought good to ſignifie vnto thy vviſedome, that thou shouldeſt prepare fyftye volumes, or coppies of holy Scripture,

written in parchment, which shalbe both legible, hādſome, &amp; portable, &amp; that thou commaunde moreouer, that they be written of ſkilfull ſcriueners, exerciſed in the arte of penning. our will is, that the volumes compriſe thoſe bookes of holy Scripture, whoſe penning, and vſe, thou thy ſelfe shalt thinke moſt neceſſarily to auaile for the edifying of the Church. Our highnes hath ſent letters vnto our heade treaſurer, that he shoulde miniſter all neceſſaries for the prouiſion of theſe bookes. It is thy part then, to ouerſee with ſpeede, that theſe vvritten coppies be made ready. Moreouer by vertue of theſe our letters (as right requireth) we geue thee liberty to take vp tvvo common vvaggons, for the conueying of them thither, for ſo the vvritten coppies shal the ſooner be brought vnto vs, and ſo much the better if one of thy Deacons, be put in truſt therewith. who when as he commeth in place, shall find the proofe of our liberality.

Ieruſalem, ſendeth greeting. So bountifully vvas the goodnes of our Sauiour, shevved towards vs, that no tongue is able for the worthines thereof, ſufficiently to expreſſe this preſent miracle: that the pleadge or monument of his moſt bleſſed paſſion, which of late laye hidd in the bovvells of the earthe the ſpace of ſo many yeares, shoulde at length be reuealed vnto the ſeruants of God being ſet at libertie, after conquering of the common and generall enemie: it farre exceedeth all humane ſenſe, and capacitie of mans vvitt. For if all the ſages, and vviſeſt ſorte of men throughout the vvorlde, aſſembled them ſelues together, and purpoſed to reaſon and entreate hereof, without doubt they coulde not, for the worthines thereof, ſatisfie with any circumſtance, no, not the leaſt point thereof the fayth annexed vnto this miracle is of ſuch force, and ſo farre exceedeth the ſenſe and capacitie of mans nature: as celeſtiall, and diuine thinges, doe paſſe humane and worldly affaires. VVherefore this is alwayes my principall and onely marke to shoote at, that euen as the true fayth reuealeth her ſelfe dayly, by newe and ſtraung miracles: ſo all our mindes with all modeſtie, and vniforme readines, shoulde be fixed, and more prone, to the obſeruation of the moſt holy and bleſſed Goſpell. beſides this, that alſo (the vvhich I thinke euery man knovveth full vvell) I vvoulde haue thee fully aſſured to be my chiefe care, that the ſayd holy place, (the which by the commaundement of God, we haue purged from the foule weight of the filthy Idols, ouerlayed therevvith as it vvere vvith a moſt grieuous burthen: the vvhich place alſo vve knowe to haue bene recounted holy in maner from the beginning of the vvorlde, and aftervvards alſo to haue yelded more euident proofes of holines, by ſturring vp againe the faith of the paſſion of our Sauiour, as it vvere from out of darkenes into light) be bevvtified vvith goodly and gorgeous buylding.

I certify thee moreouer, that toutching the making vp of the vvalls, and the curious vvorkemanship thereof, I haue charged our friende Dracillianus (who gouerneth diuers other coaſts) and alſo the ruler of that prouince, our grace hath charged them, that what artificers, what workemen, what other thinges ſoeuer shall ſeeme expedient for the buylding, they shoulde learne of thy wiſedome, and forthvvith be ſent thither for the prouiſion thereof. Concerning the pillers, &amp; other parts of the temple to be made of marble, looke vvhat thou ſuppoſeſt fitteſt, both for the maieſtie of the workmanship, &amp; continewance of the buylding, taking vvith thy ſelfe good aduiſement therein, that thou certifie vs thereof by thy letters, to the ende that we vnderſtanding by thy letters what you haue neede of, may from euery vvhere conuey the ſame thither vnto you for it behoueth vs to garnishe, &amp; ſete forth vvith great maieſtie, the heade, and chiefe place of the vvhole vvorlde. our vvill is beſides, that thou certifie vs, vvhat thine opinion is, vvhether it vvere better to haue the roofe of the ſanctuary embovved vautvviſe, or vvrought after ſome other kinde of artificious cunning▪ if embovved vautvviſe, then may it finely be gylded all ouer.

came to paſſe, through his aduiſe, both profitable for the Church, and honorable for eccleſiaſticall perſons.

I will reueale him, y• reported vnto me his doings, neither will I cloke or conceale that, at all, though therefore I may incurre the daūger of ſuſpicion or the reprehenſiū of diuers perſons. It was Auxanon, a prieſt of y• 
                        Nouatian church, who hauing liued many years went, being a very yong man vnto the councell of Nice, together with Aceſius: that told me all the things which happened vnto Aceſius, of whome I ſpake before. It was euen he yt lengthened his dayes, &amp; continewed his yeares, frō that time, vnto the raigne of Theodoſius the yonger, &amp; rehearſed vnto me being a very yong man, all the famous actes of Eutychianus. And though he ranne ouer many gifts of the grace of God, beſtowed vpon him, yet reported he of him, one notable thing which happened in the raygne of Conſtantine the emperour, which was thus. One of the garde whome the emperour calleth ordinary, as ſoone as he was ones ſuſpected of traiterous conſpiracy, fled away. The emperour being throughly moued with indignation againſt him, gaue ſtraicte charge, &amp; commaundement, that whereſoeuer he were taken, there immediatly he ſhould be executed. He was found about Olympus in Bithynia, &amp; fettered wt cruell, &amp; greuous bonds in the parts of Olympus, then clapt in priſon. In thoſe parts Eutychianus had his abode, leading a ſolitary lif, curing many of their grieuous maladies, both outwardly in body, &amp; inwardly in their mind. with him this Auxanon had his conuerſation, being as then a yong ſtripling, which afterwards liued many yeares, &amp; learned vnder him y• monaſtical trad of liuing. They flock about Eutychianus, that he would releaſe yt priſoner, &amp; entreat the emperour for him (for the miracles wrought by Eutychianus were famous, &amp; being bruted abrode, they came to y• eares of y• emperour) he eftſones with a willing, &amp; prompt mind, promiſeth that he will take his iorney to y• emperour, in his behalfe. But whileſt y• y• priſoner endured extreame torments, by reaſon of y• intollerable fetters, wherewith he was faſtened: y• ſolicitors of his cauſe informed Eutychianus, y• death, becauſe of his bitter puniſhment, would preuent both y• execution inioyned by y• emperour, &amp; y• ſupplication y• was to be made for him. Eutychianus then, ſent vnto the kepers of y• iayle, requeſtinge thē to looſe y• man. And whē they had anſwered, that the deliuerance of the priſoner, would be the great daūger of their liues: Eutychianus together wt 
                        Auxanon, went ſtraight way vnto y• priſon. When as y• kepers being entreated, would not open y• priſon: y• gift of God incloſed in the breſt of Eutychianus, reuealed it ſelfe wt greater brightnes in the world. For the gates of y• priſon, voluntarily ſett themſelues wide opē yea when y• keyes were abſent, &amp; tied to y• keepers girdle. Moreouer when Eutychianus &amp; Auxanō

This was the recantation of Euſebius, and Theognis. by which circunſtances I do coniecture, though they ſubſcribed vnto the forme of fayth, decreed by the councell, yet that they would not condeſcend, to the renouncing of Arius: and that Arius before this time, was ſent for. And for all that it was ſo, yet was it ſtraictly cōmaunded, that Arius ſhoulde not tread within Alexandria. The which plainly appeareth, by the ſubtle treachery he founde out, for to returne vnto the church, and to the city of Alexandria, through falſe and fained ſhewe of repentance.

                     THe emperour, after the ending of the coūcell, liued in great trāquility. And as ſoone as (after the wonted guiſe) he had celebrated the twētyth yeare of his raygne, without all delay, or tariance, he turned himſelfe wholy to the buylding of churches, the which he brought to paſſe, as well in other cyties, as in that cytie the which he called after his name, but of olde bore the name of Byzantium. This he enlarged exceedingly, he enuironed with great &amp; goodly walls, he bewtified with glorious building, and made her nothing inferior to the princely cytie of Rome callinge her after his name Conſtantinople. He made moreouer a lawe that ſhe ſhoulde be calledConſtantinople called Newe Rome but of olde Byzantium. the Second Rome. The which lawe is ingrauen in a ſtony piller, &amp; reſerued in the publique pretory, nigh the emperours knightly picture. In this cytie he erected from the foūdation, two churches, calling y• one, of peace, the other, of the Apoſtles. He encreaſed not only (as I ſayd before) chriſtian affairs, but altogether rooted out the rites of the Gentiles. He caried away the images out of the Idole groues, &amp; to the end they might ſett out the cytie of Conſtantinople, they were to be ſeene abrode in y• open market place. He inuironed about in the open aer, the threefooted treſtle (vpon y• which the prieſt of Apollo in Delphos, was wont to receaue his oracle) with a grate. Peraduenture ſome men will count the recitall of theſe things altogether impertinent, ſpecialy in as much as of late in maner all men, haue ether ſeene them with their eyes, or heard of them wt theyr eares.

And why it was ſo harde a matter to finde, I will declare in fewe words. euen as they which embraced the faith of Chriſt highly eſteemed of that ſepulchre, and monument after his paſſion: ſo of the contrary, ſuch as abhorred chriſtian religion, heaped in that place much earth, and raiſed great hilloks, and buylded there the temple of 
                           Ʋenus, and hauinge ſuppreſſed the remembrance of the place, they ſette vp her Idole. This haue we learned of olde to be true. But when as the emperours mother was made priueye hereunto ſhee threwe downe the Idole: ſhe digged vp the place: ſhe cauſed the great heape of earthe to be hurled aſide, and the filth to be remoued: ſhe findes three croſſes in the graue, one, I meane that bleſſed, vpon the whiche Chriſte ſuffred: other two, on the whiche the two theeues ended their liues. Together with whiche croſſes the table of Pilate was founde, whereupon he had wrytten with ſundrye tongues, and ſignified vnto the worlde, that Chriſte crucified was the Kinge of the Iewes. Yet becauſe there roſe ſome doubte whether of theſe three, ſhoulde

be the croſſe of Chriſt, for the which they had made this ſearche, the emperours mother was not a litle penſiue. The which ſorowefull heuynes of hers, Macarius byſhop of Ieruſalem, not longe after, aſſwaged. For he made manifeſt by his fayth, that which afore was doubtfull, &amp; ambiguous. He deſired of God a ſigne, and obtained his ſute. The ſigne was this: there was a certaine woman of that coaſt, which by reaſon of her long, and greuous diſeaſe, lay at the poincte of death. As ſhe was yeldinge vp of the ghoſt, the byſhop layd euery one of the croſſes vpon her, beinge fully perſwaded, that ſhe ſhoulde recouer her former health, if that ſhe toutched the reuerent croſſe of our Sauiour, which in deed failed him not. For whē as both the croſſes, which belonged not vnto the Lorde, were layd to the woman, ſhe continewed neuertheleſſe at the poinct of death: but as ſoone as the third (which in very dede was the croſſe of Chriſt) was layd vnto her, although ſhe ſeemed preſently to leaue this world, yet leaped ſhe vp, and was reſtored to her former health. After thisThe croſſe of Chriſt was founde out by a miracle. Newe Ieruſalem. ſorte was the croſſe of Chriſt founde out. The emperours mother buylded ouer the ſepulchre, a goodly and gorgeous church, callinge it Nevve Ieruſalem, righte ouer againſt that old, and waſt Ieruſalem. The one halfe of the croſſe ſhe lockt vp in a ſiluer cheſt, &amp; left there to be ſeene, of ſuche as were deſirous to beholde ſuch monumēts, the other halfe ſhe ſente to the emperour. The which when he had receaued, ſuppoſinge that city, to be in greate ſafety, where in it were kept, compaſſed it with his owne picture which was ſett vp in the market place at Conſtantinople (ſo called of Conſtantinus) ouer a mighty piller of redd marble. Although I commit this to wryting, which I haue onely learned by heareſay, yet in maner all they which inhabite Conſtantinople, affirme it to be moſt true. Moreouer when Conſtantinus had receaued the nayles, wherewith the nakedThe nayles were founde. handes of Chriſt were faſtened to the tree (for his mother had founde theſe alſo in the ſepulchre of Chriſt, and ſent them vnto him) he cauſed bitts for bridles, helmets and headpeeces, to be made thereof the which he wore in battaile. The emperour furthermore made prouiſion for all ſuche neceſſaries, as were required to the buyldinge of the churches, and wrote vnto Macarius the biſhop,The good deedes the vertuous life, and godly ende of Helene. that with all diligence he ſhould further the buyldinge. The emperours mother as ſoone as ſhe had finiſhed the church, which ſhe called Nevve Ieruſalem, buylded a ſecond, nothinge inferior to the firſt, at Bethleem, in the hollowe rocke, where Chriſt was borne accordinge vnto the fleſh, alſo a thirde, vpō the mount, where Chriſt aſcended vnto y• father. Beſides, ſhe was ſo vertuous, &amp; ſo meeke that ſhe would fall downe to her prayers, in the middeſt of the vulgare ſorte of women: that ſhe woulde inuite to her table, virgines, which were conſecrated to holy life accordinge vnto the canon of the church: that ſhe woulde bring in meate, and ſerue them her ſelfe. Many things ſhe gaue to churches, and to poore people, ſhe liued godly, and religiouſly, and departed this life, being foureſcore yeare olde, her body was brought to Conſtantinople, called Nevve Rome and buried there with princely funerall.

And when as the Ethnicks affirmed, that the God Serapis, was he which made the riuer Nilus to ouerflowe, and to water the countrey of Aegypt, becauſe that a certaine elle was brought into the temple of Serapis: the emperour commaunded, that elle to be conueyed into the churche of Alexandria. When that it was noyſed, that Nilus woulde no longer ouerflowe, becauſe the God Serapis tooke greate indignation, that he was thus abuſed: the yeare followinge, the riuer did not onely ouerflowe (after his wonted maner) and from that time forth kept his courſe, but alſo thereby declared vnto the worlde, that Nilus was accuſtomed to ouerflowe, not after theire ſuperſtitious opinion, but by the ſecret determination of the deuine prouidence. Although the Sarmatians, Barbarians, and Gotths, at the ſame time, aſſayled the right of the Romayne empire: yet for all that, the emperours care and induſtry for the buyldinge of churches, was not ſlacked, but diligently with great aduiſe, did he prouide for both. For he valiantly ouercame theſe nations, vnder the banner of the croſſe, which is the peculiar cognizance of chriſtian profeſſion, ſo that not onely he depriued them of the tribute, which the emperours of olde, were wonte to pay vnto the

                        Barbarians: but alſo they beinge aſtoniſhed at this ſtraunge victory, yelded themſelues then, firſt of all, wholly to embrace chriſtian religion, by the meanes of the which, Conſtantine had preſerued himſelfe. Conſtantinus againe applied himſelfe to the buyldinge of other churches, and one he erectedGenſ. 18. in the okegroue of Mambre where holy ſcripture reporteth, the Angels to haue bene harbored by Abraham. When that he was certified, that altars were erected at that oke, and that the Ethnicks offred ſacrifice and incenſe in that place, to theyr fayned Gods, he ſharply rebuked Euſebius biſhope of Caeſarea, by his letters, becauſe that through his ſlackenes in executinge his office, that wickednes was committed. He commaundeth therefore the altars to be turned vpſide downe, and a church harde by the oke, to be builded. He commaundeth an other church to be builded in Heliopolis of Phoenicia, and that for this cauſe. What lawe maker the Heliopolits had of olde, I am not able to ſaye, but the lawes, and cuſtomes of the cytie doe manifeſtly declare, what kinde of man he was. By the cuſtome of their countrey, they haue all women in common, &amp; thereforeConſtātinus abrogated the moſt filthie lawes of the Heliopolits and brought thē to the chriſtian faith. of the children, there can no certainty be had. Amonge them there is no difference, ether of father or ſonne. They geue their virgins to ſtraungers, which come amongſt them, to be defloured. The emperour endeuored wholly to abrogat this old and rotten cuſtome of theirs. For when he had taken away this brutiſhe, and beaſtly kind of behauiour, he made a ſacred, and a ſeuere lawe: that kindreds, and families ſhoulde be knowen amongeſt thē, and ſeuered one from the other. To be ſhort, when he had buylded churches amonge them, he haſtened to conſecrate them a biſhop, &amp; to ordaine the holy company of clergy men. Thus the ſtate of the Heliopolits, after the remouing of theire former filth, was reformed into modeſte behauiour. In like maner he ouerthrewe theThe temple of Venus ouerthrowen. temple of Venus in Aphaca, ſtanding at the foote of mount Libanus, and rooted out al the wicked rites, and ceremonies which were wont to be done there both impudently, &amp; vnreuerently. What ſhall I ſpeake of the familiar deuell, and the ſpirite of diuination the which he foyled in Cilicia, &amp;The deuell was faine to flye out of the Idole. The tente of Conſtantine like the tabernacle of Moſes. Exod. 33. commaunded the Idole in whoſe cloſettes, he had craftely hid himſelfe, to be deſtroyed? furthermore he was ſo feruent in promoting chriſtian religion that when he ſhould haue warred againſt the Perſians he made him a tente much like the tabernacle of Moſes in the deſert, in forme and figure, reſembling the churche of God, and the ſame of a chaūgeable colored vaile, the which he caried about with him, that in the waſte wilderneſſe, and deſerte places, he mighte alwayes finde readye an holy Churche, to ſinge hymnes, and deuoutly to ſerue the liuinge God. But the ſame battaile wente not forewardes, the Perſians feared the power of the Emperoure, and ſo all iniuries were putte vp, and peaceably ended. That the Emperoure alſo imployed greate laboure, and trauell; in buyldinge townes, and Cyties, and that of diuerſe peltinge villages, he made princely Cyties, (for example Drepane after his mothers name, and Conſtantia in Palaeſtina, after the name of his ſiſter Conſtantia) I thinke it preſently, not needefull to committe in wrytinge, for the poſterity. For it is not our drifte to declare the other famous actes of the Emperoure, but onely thoſe whiche appertaine vnto chriſtian religion, and ſpeciallye the eſtate of the churches. Wherefore in as much as the famous actes of the Emperoure, tend to an other purpoſe, and require a proper and a peculiar kinde of handlinge; I leaue them for others, whiche bothe knowe, and can ſufficiently diſcourſe thereof. I of mine owne parte, woulde neuer haue layde penne to paper, if the Church had beene at vnitie and concorde within it ſelfe. For where there is no matter miniſtred to wryte there the wryter ſeemeth to be fond, and his trauell fruſtrat. But in as much as the ſubtletye of ſophiſters, fonde quirckes, and fallacies of Satan, depraued in thoſe dayes the Apoſtolick, and ſyncere Character of Chriſtian religion, ſeuered alſo, and as it were vnioynted the membres of Chriſt: I thought good to ſaye ſomethinge of them, whereby the eccleſtaſtical affayrs, may not fall into the duſt of obliuion. For the knoweledge thereof is much ſett by, amonge moſte men, and ſettleth for experience, the minde of ſuche a one, as is well ſeene therein. For when any vaine controuerſie riſeth about the ſignification of a worde, it teacheth him to haue a ſtayed heade.

But the midle India, inhabited of many barbarous nations, varying among themſelues alſo in language: was not lightened with the worde of God, and the fayth of Chriſt afore the raygne of Conſtantine. And what drowe them to embrace the faith I am nowe about to declare. Meropius a certaine Philoſopher, borne in Tyrus, longed to ſee, &amp; was very deſtrous to trauell into the Indian countrey, as I am perſwaded, he was allured thereunto by y• example of Metrodorus the philoſopher, who aforetime, had throughly traueled that countrey. Meropius thē, taking with him two yong mē, that were his coſins, which alſo were ſkilfull in the Greeke tonge, tooke ſhip, and ſayled to the ſame countrey. And when as he had enioyed his full deſire, &amp; nowe againe longed to be at home, beinge pinched with want of neceſſarie foode, he arriued at a place, where there was a ſure &amp; a ſafe hauen. It fell out, at the very ſame time, that the leage concluded betwene the Romains &amp; the Indians was broken. The Indians then, laid hands vpon the Philoſopher, and ſuch as ſailed with him, &amp; ſlewe them all, the Philoſophers two yonge coſins onely excepted. The children they pitied, becauſe of their tender yeares, &amp; being ſaued, they are geuen for a preſent vnto the King of India. The King liking very well of their yong coūtenances, made the one whoſe name was Aedeſius his cuppbearer, to attend vpon his cupp at the table: and the other whoſe name was Frumentius, he made maiſter of the Kings rolles. not longe after, the King died, leauing behind him a ſonne, that was very yong, &amp; the ſcepter of his kingdome vnto his wife, manumiſing alſo Aedeſius &amp; Frumētius. The queene being very careful ouer this yong prince, requeſted them both, to take y• gard &amp; gouernement of him, vntill he came to lawefull yeares, &amp; mans eſtat. Theſe yong men, according vnto her requeſt, diligently applie themſelues, about the princes affaires, but ſpecially Frumentius, who was in chiefeſt authority. This Frumentius enquired earneſtly of the Romaine marchants, which did trafficke in y• countrey, whether there was any chriſtian in there company. When he had found certaine, &amp; ſignified vnto them his companiōs eſtate, &amp; his owne, he praied them to chooſe vnto themſelues ſeuerall places, where after the maner of the chriſtians, they mighte poure out prayers vnto the liuinge God. In proceſſe of tyme, Frumentius builded a churche for prayer. And thoſe chriſtians ioyne vnto them certaine Indians, whome they inſtructed in y• principles of the

But when as the king, &amp; his mother earneſtlye entreated them to tary &amp; cold not preuaile, being very deſtrous to viſite their natiue ſoyle, they take their leaue, &amp; bid farewell. Aedeſius went to Tyrus, for to ſee his parēts &amp; kinsfokes. Frumentius got him to Alexandria, &amp; opened the whole matter, &amp; all the circumſtances vnto Athanaſius, who a fewe dayes before, was there ſtalled Biſhop. He told him what happened in his iorney that there was good hope, that the Indians would receaue the faith of Chriſt.

are, hauing theyr originall of the Iberians, which inhabite Spayne. This woman being a captiue, &amp; hauinge her conuerſation with Barbarians, gaue her ſelfe wholly to godlines. For ſhe exerciſed very muche the diſcipline of continencye, ſhe vſed a ſeuere kinde of abſtinence, and allwayes aplied her ſelfe to feruent prayer. The which thinge when the Barbarians perceaued they wondered at the ſtraungenes of the Act. It fell out that the kinges ſonne, of very tender yeares, fell into a daungerous diſeaſe. The queene (after that countrey maner) ſent the childe vnto other women for phiſicke, to trye if experience had taught them any medicene that might cure that malady. When as the nurce had caried aboute the childe vnto euery woman, and coulde purchaſe remedy of none, at length he is broughte vnto the woman that was captiue. Shee in the preſence of many women although ſhe layde thereunto no ſalue, or remedy in the worlde (for of trueth ſhee knewe none) yet tooke ſhee the childe, layde her ſackecloth vpon him, and ſayde onely theſe wordes: Chriſt which healed many, will alſo heale this infante. When ſhee had vttered theſeThe kinge of the Iberians child is cured wordes, and prayed vnto God for ayde and aſſiſtance the childe forthwith recouered, and thenceforth enioyed perfecte health. The fame of this act was bruted abrode, amonge all the Barbarian wiues, and came at length vnto the queenes eare, ſo that her name was famous, and the captiue woman muche ſpoken of. In a while after, the queene her ſelfe fell ſicke, and this ſimple woman was ſent for. Shee refuſed to goe, leſte that peraduenture ſome violence, contrary to the modeſtye of her nature, were offred vnto her. The Queene then is conueyed vnto her. Shee practiſeth the like, as ſhe had done before vnto the childe. Forthwith the Queene is riddThe queene of the Iberiās is healed of her diſeaſe, ſhee thanketh the woman. But the woman anſwered: it is not my doinge, but Chriſtes, the ſonne of God, and the maker of heauen and earth. She exhorteth the Queene to call vpon him, and to acknowledge him for the true God. The kinge maruelinge that this malady, whiche raygned among the Iberians, was ſo ſome cured, made inquiſition who healed his wife, and commaunded the captiue woman ſhoulde be bountifully rewarded. Which made anſwere: that ſhe wanted no riches, but eſteemed godlynes, as greate treaſure: and that the kinge ſhoulde receaue a precious Iewell, if that he woulde acknowledge that God, whome ſhe profeſſed. With theſe words ſhe ſent backe the rewardes. The kinge layde vp theſe ſayinges in his breſt. The next day after, as the kinge went a hunting, ſuche a thing happened. The hilles, and foreſt, where his game laye, were ouercaſt with darke cloudes and thicke miſt, the game was vncertaine and doubtfull, the waye ſtopt and intricate, the kinge beinge at his witts ende not knowinge what was beſt in this caſe to be done, called earneſtly vpon the Gods whiche he accuſtomed to ſerue. But when his calling vpon them, ſtoode him in no ſteede, it came to his mind, to thinke vpon the God of the captiue woman, vnto him then he turneth, and crieth for helpe. As ſoone then as he had prayed vnto him the cloude was diſſolued, the miſte ſcattered it ſelfe, and vaniſhed awaye. The Kinge wondered, returned whome ioyfullye and tolde his wife all that had happened. Immediatly he ſendes for the captiue woman, when ſhee came, he demaunded of her what God it was whome ſhe ſerued?

To them he rehearſed the manner of his ſonnes curinge, the healinge of his wife, and what happened vnto him as he wente a huntinge. He exhorted them to ſerue the God of the captiue woman. They preache Chriſte to bothe ſex, the Kinge to men, and the Queene to women. As ſoone as he had learned of the captiue woman the forme and faſhion of Churches whiche the Romaynes vſed, he cauſed a Church to be buylded, and gaue charge, that with all ſpeede, prouiſion ſhould be made for buyldinge. To be ſhorte the houſe of prayer is erected. As ſoone as they wente aboute to lifte vp the pillours, the wiſedome of God euen in the worke it ſelfe, ſetled the mindes of the people, and drewe them to Chriſte. It fell out that one of the pillours remayned immoueable, and colde by no deuiſe be remoued, the ropes breake, and the engines cracke in peeces. The workemen deſpaire, and returne euery man to his home. Then the fayth of the captiue woman made it ſelfe manifeſt. For in the night ſeaſon, when no man perceaued, ſhe came vnto the place, and continewed in prayer all night longe, by the deuine prouidence of God the pilloure is winded vp in the ayer, ouer the foundacion, and there hangeth leuell wiſe, without ether proppe or butreſſe. At the breakinge of the daye, the Kinge beinge a carefull man, not forgetfull of his buſines, came to ſee the buylding, and behouldeth the pillour hanginge in the aer, leuell ouer his place. He wondereth at the ſighte, and all that ſawe it were aſtoniſhed. In

a litle ſpace after, before their faces, the pilloure came downe, and faſtened it ſelfe in his proper place. Whereupon they all ſhowted, the kings faith is helde for true, &amp; the God of the captiue woman was extolled with prayſes. Thenceforth they ſtagger not at all, but with chearefull mindes they rayſe the reſt of the pilloures, and in a while after they finiſhe the buyldinge. After this they ſende Embaſſadors vnto Constantine, requeſtinge league thenceforthe to be concluded betwene them and the Romaynes, they craue a Byſhope, and Clergie men to inſtructe them, they proteſt theyre ſyncere and vnfayned beleefe in Chriſte.

Then went Manichaeus about, couertly to conuey into the Church of God, the doctrine of Empedocles, the heathen philoſopher, of whome Euſebius Pamphilus made mention in the 7. booke of his eccleſiaſticall hiſtory, yet not exquiſitely handlinge his doinges.

But theſe men for all that, abuſed their libertie, and made more ſturre in the worlde then euer was before. Two things droue them therevnto: the deteſtable hereſie of Arius, which helde their mindes of a longe time, and the deadly hatred they bare vnto Athanaſius. Becauſe he valiantly withſtoode them as they diſputed in the Councell of Nice, firſte of ſpite they chalenge his degree and vocation, ſaying: he was no fitt man for the rowme of a biſhop, next that he was elected by vnlawfull perſons.

He was thought with ſilence to haue ouerſhipped the cauſes, for that he had determined with him ſelfe not to ſubſcribe vnto the decrees of the Nicene Councell. But as we haue learned manifeſtly by diuers epiſtles the which, byſhops wrote priuately one to an other after the Councell: the clauſe of One ſubſtance, troubled exceedingly their mindes, and whyleſt that they ſifted, and ſearched out the

It ſeemed that nere nother ſyde vnderſtoode well, the cauſe that made them to reuyle eche other.

Wherefore there was a Councell ſummoned at Antioche, where Eustathius, for fauouringe the hereſie of Sabellius, more then furtheringe the Canons of the Nicene Councell, was depoſed,

                        ut diuers do report that there were other matters of no ſmall importance, and leſſe honeſtie, layde to his charge and cauſes of his depriuation, yet do they not openly rehearſe them. For it is the maner amonge byſhops, to accuſe them that are depoſed, to pronounce them for wicked perſons, yet to conceale the particular faults. Georgius byſhop of Laodicea in Syria, one of them that reiected the clauſe of One ſubstance, in his booke of the prayſe of Euſebius Emiſenus, writeth him ſelfe to haue reported, that the biſhops depoſed Eustathius the Sabellian hereticke, Cyrus biſhop of Berrhaea, beyng his accuſer. But of this Euſebius Emiſenus we minde to ſpeake in an other place. Georgius writeth, that Eustathius the Sabellian, accuſed by Cyrus: and agayne Cyrus him ſelfe, conuicted of the ſame hereſie, to haue bene both remoued out of their byſhoprickes. But howe can it be that Cyrus, beyng him ſelfe infected with the foule hereſie of Sabellius, ſhould accuſe Eustathius of the ſame? Therefore it ſeemeth, that Eustathius was depoſed for ſome other cauſe. After this there was kindled in Antioche ſuch a fierye flame of ſedition, that in maner the whole citie was therewith turned vpſide downe. The faction was twofold▪ the one went about to trāſlate Euſebius Pamphilus byſhop of Caeſarea in Palaeſtina, to Antioche: the other woulde needes bringe againe Eustathius.

The Emperour had to his ſiſter one Conſtantia, ſhe was the wyfe of Licinnius, who ſometyme was fellowe Emperour with Constantine, but afterwardes for his tyrannie was put to death. This Constantia had greate acquaintance and familiaritie with a certaine prieſt of the Arian ſect, whome ſhe made very much of who through the perſwaſion of Euſebius, and others his familier and deare friendes, made ſute vnto her, in the behalfe of Arius, ſignifyinge that the ſynode had done him iniurie, and that he was not of the opinion he was reported to be. Constantia hearinge this, beleeued the prieſt, but durſt not make the Emperoure priuye therevnto. It fell out that Constantia was viſited with greate ſickneſſe, ſo that the Emperour came very oft to ſee her. When the woman perceaued her ſelfe to be daungerouſly ſicke, and wayted for no other then preſent death, ſhe commendes vnto the Emperour this prieſte, ſhe prayſeth his induſtrie, his godlineſſe, his good will and loyalitie vnto the imperiall ſcepter. In a ſhort whyle after, ſhe departeth this lyfe. The prieſt is in greate authoritie with the Emperour. And creepinge euery day more and more into better eſtimation, breaketh the ſame matter vnto the Emperour, as before vnto his ſiſter▪ that Arius was of no other opinion, then the councell had decreed: and if he would voutchſafe him his preſence, that he would ſ

This report that the prieſt made of Arius, ſeemed very ſtraunge vnto the Emperour, who gaue agayne this anſweare: If (ſayth he) Arius he of that minde, and (as you ſaye) agreeth with the fayth confirmed by the Councell: I wyll not onely geue him the hearinge my ſelfe, but alſo ſende him with honor to Alexandria. When he had thus ſpoken, immediatly he wrote vnto him as followeth.

Arius in a while after the receate of the Emperours letters came to Conſtantinople, there accompanyed him Euzoius, who had bene a deacon, whome Alexander depoſed the ſelfe ſame tyme together with the other Arians. The Emperour bydds them welcome, and demaundeth of them, whether they would ſubſcribe vnto the Nicene Creede: they anſwere the Emperour that they would do it with a good will. The Emperour bidds them quickly lay downe in writing their creede.

                        How Arius by the commaundement of the Emperour returned to Alexandria, whome Athanaſius would in no wiſe admitt, againſt Athanaſius Euſebius and his confederats patched diuers crimes, and preſented them vnto the Emperour, ſo that in the ende a ſynode was ſummoned at Tyrus, to pacifie theſe quarells.
                     
                     WHen that Arius had perſwaded the Emperour in ſuch ſorte as we ſayde before, he returnes to Alexandria, but yet he could not with all his wiles treade downe the trueth,Athanaſius would not receaue Arius into the church of Alexandria. the which he had ſo egregiouſly diſſembled. Athanaſius would not receaue him into the church of Alexandria after his returne, for he deteſted him as a monſter of the worlde. Arius neuertheleſſe whileſt that he priuely ſowed his peſtilent opinion, goeth about to ſett the whole citie on an vprore. At what time Euſebius both him ſelfe wrote vnto Athanaſius, and procured alſo the Emperour to commaunde him by his letters, to condeſcende vnto the admiſſion of Arius and his cōplices. Athanaſius for all that, would not receaue them into the church, but wrote backe againe vnto the Emperour: that it was not lawfull for ſuch as had made ſhipwracke of their faith, and had bene held for accurſed of the church▪ after their returne and conuerſion, to receaue their former dignities. The Emperour was in a great chafe, and conceaued great diſpleaſure againſt Athanaſius

For if I vnderſtand, that any one (vvhich deſired to be made a member of the church) hath by any meanes through thee bene hindred, or his entrāce ſtopped: I vvill forthwith ſend one of mine officers, who by authority from me, shall both depoſe thee of thy bishopricke, and alſo place an other in thy rovvme. This the Emperour wrote reſpecting the commoditie of the church, &amp; the vnitie of the councell, leſt that through variance it were diſſolued. Euſebius then, who hated Athanaſius with deadly enmitie, thought no time fitter thē that, to bring his purpoſe to effect (for he had the Emperour incenſed againſt him, which was meate and drinke for Euſebius) and therefore he rayſed all that troubleſome ſturre, to the ende he myght cauſe Athanaſius to be depoſed of his biſhopricke.

Mareôtes is a contrey of Alexandria, in it there are many villages, and the ſame well peopled: within the ſame alſo, there are many Churches, yea of greate fame, all which are vnder the Biſhop of Alexandria, within the iuriſdiction of his ſeae and biſhopricke. In this Mareôtes, one Iſchyras (for ſo they called him) practiſed priuely ſuch aIſchyras a falſe miniſter forging orders vnto him ſelfe. kinde of offence, as deſerued a hundreth kindes of death, for when as he had neuer taken orders, he called him ſelfe a miniſter, and preſumed to execute the function of a prieſt. Who when he was taken with the maner, fledd away priuely, and gott him ſtraight to Nicomedia, to the faction of Euſebius as a ſure and ſafe refuge. They, for hatred they owed vnto Athanaſius entertayned him for a prieſt, and promiſed to make him Biſhop, if he would accuſe Athanaſius, ſo that hereby I meane by the falſe reports of Iſchyras, they tooke occaſion to ſclaunder Athanaſius. for Iſchyras blaſed abrode,Athanaſius is falſly charged with the miſdemeanure of his clergy. that vpon a ſodaine they brake in vpon him, and dealt with him very contumeliouſly: that Macarius beat the altar with his heeles, ouerthrewe the Lordes table, brake the holy cuppe, and burned the bleſſed bible. They promiſed him for theſe his malicious accuſations (as I ſayd before) a biſhoprick, for they were fully perſwaded, that the crime layd to Macarius charge, was of force ſufficient, not onely to diſplace Macarius, that was accuſed: but alſo to remoue Athanaſius who had ſent him thither. This ſclaunder was compaſſed againſt him in a while after. Afore that tyme, the complices of Euſebius, had forged agaynſt him an other accuſation, full of ſpite and cankered malice: whereof I will preſently entreat.

And although this was the chiefeſt thing, that was layd to Athanaſius charg: yet as it falleth out in ſuch kinde of dealing, other men charged him with other things. for they which ſpited him vnto the death, went then about to worke all meanes poſſible, to miſchieue him. When theſe thinges were told the Emperour, he wrote vnto Dalmatius the Cenſor, who was his ſiſters ſonne, and then abode at Antioch in Syria: that he ſhoulde call ſuch as were accuſed before the barre: that he ſhoulde heare the matter, and execute the offenders. He ſent thither Euſebius, and alſo Theognis, that Athanaſius might be tryed in their preſence. Athanaſius being cited to appeare before the Cenſor, ſent into Aegypt, to ſeeke out Arſenius, for he vnderſtoode that he hidd him ſelfe. but he could not take him, becauſe that he fledd from place to place. In the meane while, the Emperour cutt of the hearing of Athanaſius matter before the Cenſor, for this cauſe. Cap. 28. a

Athanaſius would not come to Tyrus, not diſinayed ſo much with the ſclaunderous reportes that were layd to his charge (for his conſcience accuſed him of nothing) as he feared greatly, leſt that they woulde bring in ſome innouation, preiudiciall to the decrees of the Nicene councell. but becauſe that the angry lynes and threatning letters of the Emperour, moued him not a litle (for he had written vnto him, that if he came not of his owne accord, he ſhould be brought thither with a vengeance) he came of neceſſitie vnto the councell.

                        How Arſenius (whoſe hand they ſaid had bene cutt of) was found out, and brought before the barre, to the confuſion of Athanaſius accuſers, which then fledd away for ſhame: and how that Athanaſius being otherwiſe parcially dealt withall of the councell, appealed vnto the Emperour.
                     
                     THe diuine prouidence of God brought to paſſe, that Arſenius alſo came to Tyrus. For he quite forgetting the leſſons geuen him by thoſe falſe accuſers, that bribed him for the purpoſe, came thither as it were by ſtelth, to knowe what newes there were in thoſe coaſts. It fell out that the ſeruants of Archelaus a Senator, hearde ſay in a certaine tipplinghouſe, that Arſenius whome they reported to haue bene ſlayne, was there and hidd him ſelfe in a certaine houſe of the towne. When they hearde theſe thinges, and eyed well the authors of this report, they reueale the whole matter vnto their lord and maiſter. He forthwith laying all delayes aſide, ſought out the man, being ſought founde him, being founde he layd him faſt by the heeles, and biddes Athanaſius be of good cheere: that Arſenius was come thither aliue. Arſenius being in holde, denieth him ſelfe to be the man. But Paulus Biſhop of Tyrus, who knewe him of olde, affirmed plainely that he was Arſenius in deede. Theſe thinges being thus rightly diſpoſed by the wiſedome and prouidence of God: Athanaſius not long after is called before the councell, in whoſe preſence, the accuſers bring forth the hande, and charge him with the haynous offence. He behaueth him ſelfe wiſely and circumſpectly, and demaundeth firſt of them all that were preſent, and alſo of his accuſers: whether any of them did euer knowe Arſenius. When that diuers of them had aunſwered, that they knewe him very wel, he cauſed Arſenius to be brought before them, with his hāds couered vnder his cloke, and then againe demaundeth of them: Is this fellowe that Arſenius which loſt his hande? at the ſight of the fellow, ſome of them that were preſent (except them that knew whence the hand came) were aſtonied: ſome others thought verily that Arſenius wanted a hande, and gaue diligent eare, to ſee what other ſhift Athanaſius had to ſaue him ſelfe. But he turning vp the one ſide of Arſenius his cloke, ſhewed them one of his handes. Againe when ſome did ſurmiſe that his other hande was cutt of: Athanaſius at the firſte pauſed a while and in ſo doing brought their mindes into a greate doubt: but in the ende without any more adoe he caſteth vp vpon his ſhoulder, the other ſide of his cloke, and ſheweth them the ſeconde hande, ſaying vnto all that behelde it: you ſee that Arſenius hath two handes, now let mine accuſers ſhewe vnto you, the place where the thirde hande was cutt of.

This treachery of theirs toutching Arſenius, being thus come to light, the dealing was ſo ſhamefull, that the accuſers coulde finde no where as much as viſards to couer their faces. Achaab otherwiſe called Iannes, the accuſer of Athanaſius, crept by ſtelth from the barre, thruſt him ſelfe among the throng, and priuely ranne away. Thus did Athanaſius cleare him ſelfe of this ſclaunder, vſing exception agaynſte no man. for he doubted not at all, but that the very preſence of Arſenius woulde aſtoniſh the ſclaunderers, to their vtter ſhame and ouerthrow. * But for the wiping awayCap. 31. in

And firſt of all he excepteth againſt Euſebius and his adherents, as open enemyes, ſaying: by lawe it was not permitted for the enemyes to be iudges. Secondarily he requireth that they ſhewe vnto him, whether Iſchyaas the accuſer, had lawfully receaued orders and prieſthoode, for ſo it was layd downe in the bill of enditement. But the iudges conſidered nothing of theſe circumſtances, the lawe proceedeth againſt Macarius. When the accuſers were to ſeeke for proofe, the ſute is delayd vpon this conſideration, that certayne choſen men ſhoulde goe in commiſſion to Mareôtes, and there ſitt vpon this matter. When that Athanaſius perceaued, ſuch as he had excepted againſt, to haue bene pricked in the commiſſion (for Theognis Maris, Theodorus, Macedonius, Valens, &amp; Vrſacius were ſent) he exclaymed, that there was deceat, &amp; double dealing in the handling thereof. He pronounced that it was open wrong, for to keepe Macarius the Prieſt in fetters and cloſe priſon, and to ſuffer his accuſer, to accompany ſuch iudges as were knowen to be his profeſſed enemies. He ſayd moreouer, that it was for no other ende, but that records, and the doings of the one ſide might be knowen, the other vnknowen: the one quitted, the other condenmed. When that Athanaſius had ſounded out theſe and the like ſentences: when that he had both called the whole aſſembly to wittneſſe, and alſo opened this lamentable plight before Dionyſius the Senator, and no man pityed the caſe: he pryuily conueyed him away. Such as were

ſent into Mareôtes recorded onely the Actes of one ſide, and looke what the accuſer reported, the ſame was iudged to be moſt true. Cap. 32. in the Greeke. As ſoone as, Athanaſius was gone and ſtraight way taken his iourney to the Emperour: he was firſt of all condenmed by the councell, the party being abſent, and the cauſe vnknowen. Next, when as the dealings in Mareôtes were ioyned with theſe, they agree vpon his depoſition: many ſclaunders are contumeliouſly fathered vpon him, at the recitall of the cauſes, which moued them to depoſe him: but not a worde of the ſclaunderers, for they runne them ouer with ſilence that of malice falſely accuſed him, and were ſhamefully foyled them ſelues, Arſenius who afore was reported to haue bene ſlayne, is nowe entertayned of them. And he who afore time was counted a Biſhop of the Meletian ſect, euen then ſubſcribed to the depoſition of Athanaſius, and called him ſelf Biſhop of Hypſepolis. And that which ſeemeth incredible, he that was ſaid to haue died vnder the handes of Athanaſius, is now aliue, and depoſeth Athanaſius.

And how that the Emperour by his letters cauſed the councell ſummoned at Tyrus, to meete at Conſtantinople, that in his preſence the trueth toutching Athanaſius cauſe, might the more narrowely be ſifted out.

Therefore the biſhops laying all other matters aſide, do leaue Tyrus, and take their iourney to Ieruſalem. A ſolemne feaſt is there held, for the conſecration of thoſe places: Arius with his confederats is admitted into the Church. for the biſhops ſayd, that in that behalf, they would ſatisfie the Emperours letters, wherby he had ſignified vnto them, that he allowed very well of the ſayth of Arius, and Enzoius.

Of the ſelfe ſame things likewiſe, they wrote vnto the Emperour. While theſe things were in handling, there came eftſones other letters from the Emperour vnto the councell, ſignifying that Athanaſius was fledd vnto the Emperour him ſelfe, and that of neceſſity they muſt meete at Conſtantinople about his matters.

no other wiſe the power of God, then the locuſts and flyes, are ſayd in Moſes to proceede from the handie worke of God, and other ſuch lewde reaſons. This Aſterius kept company with Biſhops, and ſpecially of the damnable ſect of Arius. He frequented vnto their aſſemblies, for he longed after ſome biſhoprike or other.

Marcellus after that, recouered his biſhoprike againe in the councell helde at Sardice, where he ſayd: they vnderſtoode not his booke, and therfore ſuſpected him, that he had ſauored of the opinion of Paulus Samoſatenus. but what opinion we may conceaue of this man, we will declare in an other place.

Wherefore being now buſied with this controuerſie, he layd aſide the quirks of logicke, and fledd for ayde, and aſiſtance vnto Almighty God: he gaue him ſelfe to continewal faſting, and left no prayer vnrepeated. ſuch a kind of ſeruice &amp; deuotion he ſolemply embraced. He got him into the Church of Peace (for ſo they called the Church) he locked in him ſelfe, and finiſhed ſuch kinde of ſeruice as pleaſed him beſt: he gott him to the Altare, and downe he fell on his bare knees, before the communion table, praying vnto God wt teares that trickled downe his cheekes: in which kinde of order he continewed many dayes and many nights. He called for helpe at the handes of God, and his petition was graunted.

He was ignorant of his baniſhment into Fraunce, &amp; of many other miſeryes that happened vnto him. But we imitating his opinion, and cenſure, in diſcourſe of the Eccleſiaſticall affayres: haue written the firſt and ſeconde booke of our hiſtorye▪ from the thirde vnto the ſeuenth booke, by borowing ſome out of Ruffinus: by picking and culling other ſome out of ſundry other writers: alſo by laying downe ſome thinge, we learned of others who as yet be aliue: we haue ſett forth the hiſtorye in a moſt abſolute and perfect maner.

But this they knewe full well, they coulde not bringe to paſſe, if Athanaſius came agayne to Alexandria. They went about to compaſſe their drift very craftely, vſing the Prieſt (by whoſe meanes we ſayd before Arius returned from exile) as an inſtrument to their purpoſe. But the maner of the handling thereof, I thinke very needefull to be layde downe. This Prieſt preſented vnto Constantius the Emperours ſonne, the laſt will and teſtament and the bequeathed legacies of the Emperour deſeaſed. He perceauing yt to haue bene laid downe in his fathers wil, which greatly he deſired (for byy• wil, he was emperour of the Eaſterne parts) made very much of the prieſt, graunted him great libertie, charged him to vſe his pallace, freely and boldly at his pleaſure. After this libertie was graunted him by the Emperour: he forthwith acquainted him ſelfe with the empreſſe, with the Eunuches and chamberlaynes. At the ſame time there was an eunuch, by name Euſebius, chiefe of the emperoursOne rotten ſheepe infecteth an other. chamber, who through perſuaſion of this lewde Prieſt, became an Arian, and infected alſo the other eunuches of his company. And not only theſe, but the Empreſſe alſo, through the entiſement of the Eunuches, and the aduiſe of the Prieſt, fell into the peſtilent hereſie of Arius. In a while after, the Emperour him ſelfe called the ſame opinion into controuerſie, and ſo by a litle and a litle, it was ſpredd euery where. And firſt the Emperours garde tooke it vp, next it occupied the mindes of the multitude, throughout the city. The Emperours chamberlaynes euen in the very pallace it ſelfe, contended with women about the opinion, in euery houſe and family throughout the city they brawled and went together by the eares. This infection ſpred it ſelfe quickly, ouer other contries and regions: and the controuerſie much like a ſparcle of fire, riſing of ſmall heate or ſcattered embers kindled the mindes of the hearers with the fiery flame of diſcorde and diſſention. For euery one that deſired to knowe why they made ſuch a tumulte, by and by, had an occaſion geuen him to reaſon, and euery one was not ſatisfied with queſtioning, but contentiouſly woulde argue thereof▪ thus the heate of contention turned all vpſide downe, and troubled the quiet eſtate of the Churche.

After that the heate of contention was blowen abroad, and burned euery day more and more: the faction of Euſebius tooke this tumult, to be a furtherance to their purpoſe: for ſo they hoped it would come to paſſe, that ſome Biſhop or other woulde be choſen of Alexandria, which woulde maintayne the ſame opinion with them. But at the very ſame time, Athanaſius by the meanes of Conſtantine the yongers letters, who was one of the Caeſars, and ſo called after his fathers name: returned to Alexandria, the letters were written by the Emperour vnto the people of Alexandria from Triuere a citie of Fraunce, in forme as followeth: Cap. 3. in the Greeke.

I hope it is not vnknowen vnto your diſcreete wiſedome, that Athanaſius the profeſſor of ſacred diuinitie, was for a tyme baniſhed into Fraunce: leſt that through the miſchieuous dealing of lewde men (for bloodeſuckers and cruell beaſtes, ſought to bereue him of his life) his innocent perſon shoulde of neceſſitie be conſtrained, to take his deaths wounde.

The accuſation was ſo odious, that the Emperoure being therewith incenſed againſt Athanaſius, draue him out of Alexandria.

Who, and what he was, Georgius Biſhop of Laodicea, who then was preſent at the councell, ſheweth vnto vs. For in the booke he wrote of his life, he declareth that Euſebius came of a noble family of Edeſſa in Meſopotamia: from a litle one to haue bene trained vp, in holy ſcripture: afterwards to be inſtructed in prophane literature, by a profeſſor which then taught at Edeſſa: laſt of all to haue ſucked y• right ſenſe, &amp; vnderſtanding of holy ſcripture, at the lips of Euſebius &amp; Patrophilus, the one biſhop of Caeſarea; the other biſhop of Scythopolis. After this to haue gone to Antioch, where it fell out that Euſtathius being accuſed of the hereſie of Sabellius, by Cyrus biſhop of Beroea, was depoſed of his biſhoprik. Thēceforth to haue accompanied Euphronius, the ſucceſſor of Euſtathius: and becauſe he woulde not be prieſte, to haue gott him to Alexandria, and there to haue ſtudied philoſophie. After that, to haue returned to Antioch, where he acquaynted him ſelfe with Placitus, the ſucceſſor of Euphronius. Thēce to haue bene called by Euſebius biſhop of Conſtantinople, to be biſhop of Alexandria: but (ſayth Georgius becauſe that Athanaſius was greately beloued of the people of Alexandria, he went not thither but was ſent into the city Emiſa. Where when there was much adoe made among the citizens of Emiſa about the election (for he was charged with the ſtudy of the mathematicks) he fledd away &amp; came to Laodicea vnto Georgius, who reported many notable ſtoryes of him. Georgius brought him to Antioch, &amp; by y• meanes of Placitus &amp; Narciſſus, cauſed him to be conueyed to Emiſa, where againe he was accuſed of the hereſy of Sabellius. But of the circumſtāces of his election, Georgius
                        
diſcourſeth more at large: laſt of all he addeth, howe that the Emperour going into Barbary tooke him thence, and that he knewe full well, many wonders &amp; miracles to haue bene wrought by him. So farre of the things which Georgius remembred of Euſebius Emiſenus.

Theſe things being done, they labour to alter the faith: who althoughe they colde reproue nothinge of the thinges decided in the Nicene Councell, yet verelye wente they about through theyr often aſſemblyes, to peruerte and ouerthrowe the creede contayninge the clauſe of One ſubſtance, and otherwiſe to eſtabliſhe of theyr owne, that by a little and a litle they mighte ſoke men, in the filthie ſincke of Arius.

The whiche you may eaſilye perceaue by that whiche followeth. For we haue learned from the beginninge, to beleeue in one vniuerſall God, the creator and maker of all things, both viſible and inuiſible, and in one Sonne, the only begotten Sonne of God, who was before all wordes, and had his beinge together with the Father, which begott him: by whome all things, both viſible, and inuiſible were made. VVho in the later days according vnto the ſingular good will of the father, came downe from heauen and tooke flesh of the virgine mary.

VVe beleue alſo in the holy Ghoſt. And if that you will haue vs to add more: we beleue the reſurrection of the fleshe, and the life euerlaſting. After that they had wrytten theſe things in theyr former epiſtle, they ſente it to the churches throughout euery cytie. But continewinge at Antioch a while longer, they in maner condemned the forme of fayth that wente before, and wrote forthwith a newe one, in theſe wordes:An other Creed of the Arian byſhops which is to be rede waryly.

For vnto that tyme, the cytie of Conſtantinople receaued, about eyght hundred thowſande meaſures of grayne, that was caryed thyther from Alexandria. The Emperour differred to nominate Macedonius their byſhop, for he was wonderfully incenſed, not onely agaynſte him, in that he was choſen without his aduiſe and counſell: but alſo in that through the ſturre and tumult rayſed betweene him and Paulus, not onely Hermogenes his captayne, but alſo manie others beſide, were ſlayne.

For when as he had remoued Nouatus out of the churche of Rome, they neither reſiſted, neither contraryed his doinges. This in effect was that which the biſhops of the Eaſt wrote vnto Iulius biſhop of Rome.

He gaue out a commiſſion vnto Philip the preſident, who was of greater authoritie then all the other his liuetenāts, &amp; called the ſecond perſon in the empire: to remoue Paulus, and to appoynt Macedonius in his ſteede. Philip then, fearinge the rage and tumult of the multitude, circumuenteth Paulus very ſubtlely, couertly he concealeth the Emperours pleaſure. He fayneth the cauſe of his comminge to be for the common affaires of the citie, he getts him ſtraight vnto the publicke bathe called Ze

                        maundement. The biſhop taketh paciently his ſentence, although vniuſtly decreed againſt him. But the gouernour ſtanding in great feare of the furious rage of the multitude, and ſuch as ſtoode in compaſſe about him (for many by reaſon of the ſuſpicious rumor flocked vnto the publicke bath) gaue commaundement, that one of the backe windowes of the bath ſhould be opened: that Paulus ſhould be let downe at the ſayd windowe into a ſhippe, readily appoynted for the purpoſe,

and thence be conueyed to exile. The gouernour had commaunded him, that he ſhould ſaile thence ſtraight to Theſſalonica, the head citie of Macedonia (for thence his auncetors came) and there make his abode: that it was lawfull moreouer for him, freely and without daunger to frequent y• cities of Illyrium: but he would in no wiſe geue him leaue to come nigh the countries of the Eaſt. To be ſhort, Paulus thinking litle or nothing of all this, is both depriued his church, baniſhed the citie, and forthwith brought to exile. Philip the Emperours debitie gott him with ſpeede from the publique bath, into the church. Macedonius accompanyed him (for it was ſo concluded before) ſitting by his ſide in the waggon, in the face of the whole multitude: the ſouldiers garded them with naked ſwordes, ſo that the multitude in compaſſe was amazed thereat, and ſtrocken with ſodaine feare. All ranne to the church, ſuch as defended the creede contayning the clauſe of One ſubstance, flocked to the church, as well as the Arian hereticks. As ſoone as the gouernour together with Macedonius was now come nygh the church, a maruelous great feare amazed both the multitude and the ſouldiers them ſelues. There was ſo great a multitude gathered together, that there was no paſſage for the gouernour to leade Macedonius, the ſouldiers were faine to thruſt the people of this ſide, and that ſide, but the throng was ſo great, and the rowme ſo narowe, that they coulde not geue backe, neither recoyle. The ſouldiers ſuppoſinge the multitude had ſet them ſelues againſte them, &amp; of ſet purpoſe ſtopped their walke, that the gouernour might haue no paſſage theraway: drewe their ſwords, let flye amongeſt them, and layd on luſtyly. The report goeth, that there fellThe greate ſlaughter which the Arians cauſed at Conſtantinople, about the placing of Macedonius the hereticke about three thouſande, one hundred, and fifty perſons, whereof ſome were ſlayne by the ſouldiers, ſome other ſtyfled in the throng, &amp; cruſhed to death. But Macedonius after all theſe famous acts, as if he had committed no offence, as if he were innocent, and gyltles toutching all this haynous and horrible ſlaughter: is ſtalled in the biſhops ſeate, more by the cenſure of the gouernour, then the canon of the church.

About that tyme the Emperour buylded a goodly churche, nowe called The church of wiſdome, and ioyned it vnto the churche called by the name of Peace, the which beyng of ſmall compaſſe, his father afore him had both in bygnes enlarged, and in beautie ſett forth and adorned.

                        Athanaſius is falſely accuſed. which forged out ſuch an accuſation agaynſt him as followeth. Constantinus the father of theſe Emperours had geuen a good whyle before certaine grayne for almes, to the reliefe of the poore within the churche of Alexandria. This they ſayde that Athanaſius had ſoulde, and turned it to his owne lucre and gayne. The Emperoure taketh their ſclaunderous reporte for trueth, and threatneth him with death. Athanaſius then vnderſtandinge of the Emperours hygh diſpleaſure againſt him, fled away, and hidd him ſelfe in a ſecrete and obſcure place. Iulius biſhop of Rome, hearing the moleſtation and iniuries the Arians offred Athanaſius: and nowe hauing receaued the letters of Euſebius, who lately had departed this lyfe: vnderſtandinge of the place where Athanaſius hydd him ſelfe: ſent for him, willinge him to repayre to Rome. At the ſame tyme he receaued letters from the Councell aſſembled at Antioch, and other letters alſo ſent vnto him from the byſhops of Aegypt, which playnely affirmed, that all ſuch crymes as Athanaſius was charged withall, were meere falſe. Wherefore Iulius by ſendinge of contrary letters, anſwered at large the byſhops which aſſembled at Antioche, and firſte he ſheweth what griefe and heauines he conceaued by their letters: ſecōdly that they had tranſgreſſed the canon of the church, in not callinge him to the Councell, in ſo much the canon commaundeth, that no decree be thruſt vpon the church without the cenſure of the biſhop of Rome: moreouer that they had couertly corrupted the fayth: alſo that they concluded by mayne force, and double dealing, ſuch things as of late they had lewdely handled at Tyrus, in that they of ſpyte had procured the relations of one ſide duely, to be regiſtred at Mareôtes: and that their forged leaſinges of Arſenius were meere ſclaūders, &amp; falſe reports. Theſe &amp; other ſuch like thīgs, Iulius layd downe in his letters vnto y• biſhops aſſēbled at Antioch. we would haue layd downe here y• epiſtles vnto Iulio, &amp; his vnto others

were it not that the length of their writings, and the tediouſneſſe of their diſcourſe, perſwaded vs to the contrary. Sabinus the fauourer of Macedonius his fond opinion (of whome we ſpake before) though in his booke intituled The collection of Councells, he omitted not y• epiſtle of the biſhops aſſembled at Antioche vnto Iulius, yet layde he not downe the letters of Iulius vnto them agayne. It was his accuſtomed maner ſo to doe. for what epiſtles ſo euer were written by any Councells, either altogether diſanullinge, or at leſt wiſe paſſing ouer with ſilence the clauſe of One ſubſtance, them he carefully cyted, and collected diligently: looke ſuch as were of the contrary, them of ſett purpoſe he ouerſkipped.

In like maner ſuch as ſay impiouſly and blaſpheniouſly, that Chriſt vvas begotten neyther by the counſell, neyther by the vvill of the father, attributinge to God the father a counſell tyed to neceſſitie, and an eſſence intangled vvith the vvant of free vvill, ſo that he begatt the ſonne of cō

VVe knowe that God is of his owne power, &amp; that he enioyeth his free will, and we beleue godly and reuerently that he begat the ſonne of his owne accord, &amp; free will. VVe beleue &amp; that godly, which is ſpoken of him: The Lorde made me theProuerb. 8. beginning of his wayes, for the accōplishing of his works, yet we vnderſtand no

                         frō the faith of the catholicke church, to liken the creator vnto the creatures which he shaped: or to thinke that he had the like maner of begetting with other thinges of different nature. The holy ſcriptures do informe vs, onely of one onely begotten ſonne, vnfainedly and truely begotten. Moreouer when as we ſay that the ſonne hath his being of him ſelfe, that he liueth &amp; ſubſiſteth in like ſort with the father: for all that, vve ſeuer him not from the father, neither do we imagine corporall vviſe, certaine ſpaces, and diſtance betvvene their coherencie. For vve beleeue that they ioyne together vvithout pauſe or diſtance put betvvene, and that they can not be ſeuered aſunder: ſo that the father compriſeth, as it vvere in his boſome, the vvhole ſonne: and the ſonne is ioyned and faſtened to the vvhole father, and reſteth continevvally, onely in his fathers lappe. VVe beleeue furthermore in the abſolute, perfect, &amp; moſt bleſſed Trinitie: and vvhen vve call the father God, &amp; the ſonne God, in ſo doing we ſay not, there be two gods, but one God, of equall power &amp; diuinitie, and one perfect coniunction of raygne: and euen as the father beareth rule &amp; exerciſeth authoritie ouer all things, &amp; ouer the ſonne: ſovve ſay that the ſonne is ſubiect vnto the father, and that he gouerneth beſides him, immediatly and next after him all thinges vvhich he made: and that the ſaincts, by the vvill of the father, receaue the grace of the holy Ghoſt aboundantly poured vpon them.

                        Of the generall Councell ſummoned at Sardice.
                     
                     WHen as the Emperour had written againe, that Paulus and Athanaſius ſhould be reſtored to their former rowmes and dignities, and his letters had taken no place by reaſon of the ciuill diſſention &amp; diſcord as yet not appeaſed among the multitude: Paulus &amp; Athanaſius make humble ſute, that an other councell might be called together, to the end their caſes ſhould be the better knowen, &amp; the faith ſhould be decided in a general coūcell, for they proteſted y• their depoſitiō was wrought, to the end y• faith might be deſtroyed. Wherfore by y• cōmaundemēt of both y• Emperours, (the one ſignifying y• ſame by his letters, the other whoſe dominiōs lay in y• Eaſt, willingly cōdeſcending thervnto) there was proclaimed a generall councell, that all ſhouldThe coūcell of Sardice was held An. Dom. 350. meete at Sardice a citie of Illyrium. The eleuenth yeare after y• deſeaſe of Coſtantinus, the father of theſe Emperours, in the conſulſhip of Ruffinus &amp; Euſebius, the councell of Sardice was ſummoned. There mett there (as Athanaſius ſayth) about thre hundred biſhops of the weſt churches, and (as Sabinus declareth) onely ſeuenty ſix biſhops out of the Eaſt, of which number was Iſchyras biſhopThe Arians were loth to come to the coūcel, therfore they diſſemble and fayne excuſes. of Mareôtes, whome y• depoſers of Athanaſius preferred to be biſhop of that place. Some alleage for them ſelues their infirmitie of body: ſome cōplaine that their warning was to ſhort, &amp; therfore they blame Iulius biſhop of Rome: when as ſince the date of the proclamation, &amp; the leaſure of Athanaſius cōtinewing at Rome, &amp; expecting y• meeting of the councell, there rame a whole yeare &amp; ſix moneths. After that y• biſhops of the eaſt came to Sardice, they would not come into y• preſence of y• biſhops which inhabited y• Weſt, but ſent thē this meſſage, that they would not talke, neither reaſon with them, vnleſſe cōditionally they would barre Athanaſius and Paulus their cōpany. But when Protogenes biſhop of Sardice, &amp; Oſius biſhop of Corduba a citie (as I ſayd before) of Spaine, could in no wiſe brooke that Paulus and Athanaſius ſhould be abſent: the Eaſterne biſhops forthwith depart: and cōming to Philippi a citie in Thracia, they aſſemble a priuate coūcell among thē ſelues, &amp; beginne thenceforth openly to accurſe the creede, cōtaining the claule of One ſubſtance: &amp;The Acts of the councell of Sardice. to ſowe abrode in writing their opinion, that the ſonne was not of one ſubſtance wt the father. But the aſſembly of biſhops which cōtinewed at Sardice, firſt cōdemned them which fled from the hearing of their cauſe: next depoſed from their dignities the accuſers of Athanaſius: afterwards ratified the creede of the Nicene coūcell, &amp; abrogated the hereticall opinion which ſaid, that the ſonne was of a different ſubſtance from the father: laſt of all ſett forth more plainely the clauſe of One ſubſtance, for they wrote letters therof, &amp; ſent them throughout the whole world. Both ſides werePaulꝰ biſhop of Cōſtantinople, Athanaſius biſhop of Alexādria, Marcellꝰ. b. of Ancyra, are by the councell reſtored to their churches. pleaſed with their owne doings, and euery one ſeemed to him ſelfe, to haue done right well: the biſhops of the Eaſt, becauſe the Weſterne biſhops had receaued ſuch as they had depoſed: the byſhops of the Weſt, becauſe the Eaſterne biſhops being depoſers of others, had departed before y• hearing of their cauſe: the one for that they mayntained the Nicene creede: the other for that they went about to condemne it. Their biſhoprickes are reſtored to Paulus and Athanaſius, likewiſe to Marcellus biſhop of Ancyra in the leſſer Galatia, who a litle before (as we ſayd in our firſt booke) was depoſed, who alſo then endeuoured with all might to diſproue, and confute the ſentence pronounced againſt him, ſaying that the phraſe and maner of ſpeach, which he vſed in his booke, was not vnderſtoode, and therefore to haue bene ſuſpected by them, as if he mayntayned the hereſie of Paulus Samoſatenus. Yet we may not forget that Euſebius Pamphilus wrote three bookes, to the confutation of the booke of Marcellus, where he citeth the words of Marcellus, and refuteth them, plainly declaring that Marcellus no otherwiſe then Sabellius the Aphrick, &amp; Paulus Samoſatenus, thought that the Lorde Ieſus was but onely man.

                        An Apologie, or defence in the behalfe of Euſebius Pamphilus, that he was no Arian, as diuers malicious perſons wrote of him.
                     
                     BEcauſe that diuers haue bruted abroade ſclaunderous reports of Euſebius Pamphilus, affirming that in his workes he ſauoured of the hereſie of Arius, I thinke it not amiſſe, preſently

to laye downe in fewe wordes, what of trueth we may thinke of him. Firſte of all he was both preſent at the Councell of Nice, and ſubſcribed vnto the clauſe of One ſubſtance. In his thirde booke of the lyfe of Constantine, he hath theſe wordes of that Councelll: The Emperoure
                        Euſeb. de vit. Conſtantini lib. 3. 
                        dealt ſo farre vvith them, for the reducinge of them vnto concorde and vnitie, that he lefte them not, vntyll he had brought them to be of one mynde and of one opinion, toutchinge all that afore tyme vvas called into controuerſie, ſo that vvith one voyce, they all embraced the fayth decided in the Councell of Nice: If Euſebius then, mentioninge the Councell ſummoned at Nice, doth ſaye that all quarells and queſtions were there ended: and that all were of one minde, and of one opinion, howe is it that ſome dare preſume to charge him with the ſpotte of Arianiſme? The Arians them ſelues alſo are foulie deceaued, if they take him for a fauourer of their opinion. But ſome man peraduenture wyll ſaye, that he ſeemed to ſmell of Arianiſme, in that he vſed often tymes in his bookes this phraſe: By Christ. Whome I anſwere, that not onely he, but alſo other eccleſiaſticall writers, yea and the Apoſtle him ſelfe, who was neuer once ſuſpected to be the author of any lewde opinion, vſed this phraſe before them, which wrote ſuch kinde of ſpeache, and ſundrie other ſortes of ſentences, for the liuely ſettinge forth and expreſſinge of the order and maner of our ſauiours humanitie. But what Euſebius thought, when Arius taught that the lonne was a creature, and to be accompted as one of the other creatures, nowe vnderſtande, for in his firſt booke agaynſt Marcellus he writeth thus: He alone, and none other, is both called, and is in deede
                        Euſeb. lib. 1. contra Marcellum. 
                        the onely begotten ſonne of God. VVherefore they are vvorthy of reprehenſion, vvhich are not ashamed to call him a creature, and to ſay that he beganne of nothinge, as other creatures did. Hovve shall he be the ſonne, or after vvhat ſort may he be called the onely begotten of God, vvhen as he hath (as they ſay) the ſame nature vvith other creatures, and is become one of the vulgare ſort of men, to wete: hauinge the like beginninge vvith them, and beyng made partaker vvith them of the creation vvhich is of nothinge? But the holie ſcriptures (Ivvis) teache vs no ſuch thinges of him. And agayne a litle after he ſayeth: VVhoſoeuer then ſayeth: that the ſonne vvas begotten of nothinge, or that the principall creature beganne of nothing: he attributeth vnto him vnaduiſedly the onely name of the ſonne, but in very deede, and in trueth he denyeth him to be the ſonne. For he that is begotten of nothinge, can in no vvyſe be the true ſonne of God, no more can any other thinge that hath the lyke beginninge. But the ſonne of God truely begotten of the father him ſelfe, is to be termed the onely begotten, and the vvelbeloued of the father. and ſo he shall be God. For vvhat other thinge is the budde or branche of God, then that vvhich reſembleth the begetter. The kinge is ſayde to buylde or make a cytie, but not to begette a cytie: and ſo he is ſayde to begette a ſonne, but not to buylde or make a ſonne. In reſpect of the vvorke he vvrought, he is not called a Father, but a cunninge vvorkeman, and in reſpect of the ſonne he begatte, he is not called a vvorkeman, but a father. VVherefore the God of all vniuerſalitie, is worthely to be called the father of the ſonne: yet the framer and maker of the worlde. Although it be once found written in a certaine place of holie ſcripture: The Lord made me the beginning of his wayes, for the accomplishing of his workes,
                        Prouer. 8. 
                        yet (as I am minded immediatly to interpret) it behoueth vs to skanne narowly, and to ſift out with diligence, the ſenſe &amp; vnderſtanding thereof, &amp; not after the maner of Marcellus, with one word, to shake the chiefe principles of chriſtian religion. Theſe &amp; many other ſuch like reaſons, hath Euſebius alleaged in his firſt booke againſt Marcellus, to y• cōfutation of his opinion. In his third booke he hath expounded how this word Made or created is to be vnderſtood as followeth: Theſe things being after this ſort, it remaineth that we cōſider of this ſentence: The Lord made
                        Euſeb. lib. 3. contra Marcellum. me the beginning of his wayes, for the accomplishing of his works, which is no otherwiſe to be taken, then the other thinges we expoūded before. For in caſe he ſay that he is made, he ſayth it not, as if he became ſomething, of nothing: or that he was made after the ſelfe ſame maner with other creatures, of that vvhich is not (as ſome haue levvdely imagined) but that he had beynge and lyuinge, that he vvas, and ſubſiſted before the foundations of the vvorlde vvere layde, and therefore appoynted by his father, vvho is Lorde of all thinges, the prince of all this vniuerſalitie: ſo that the vvorde Made in this place is no othervviſe to be taken, then Appoynted, or Ordayned. Peter alſo the Apoſtle calleth Princes and Magiſtrates plaine creatures, vvhere he ſayeth: Submitt your ſelues vnto euery humane creature, for the Lords ſake, whether

                            the ſpirite when he shevved by him, his Chriſt vnto all men (he vvas not then nevvely proclaymed vnder heauen, for he vvas and ſubſiſted before) but he ſent him, what time the Apoſtles were aſſembled together: when the ſound in the likenes of thunder came downe from heauen,
                        Act. 2. 
                        as if it had bene the comming of a mighty winde, and filled them all with the holy Ghoſt: and thus he shevved his Chriſt vnto all men, according vnto the prophecie which ſayd: beholde he ſetteth the thunder, he shapeth the ſpirite, and shevveth his Chriſt vnto men, laying dovvne the worde ſhapeth, for ſendeth or ordaineth, and the word thunder
                         in an other ſenſe, for the preaching of the Goſpell. Dauid alſo vvhen he ſayde: Create me a cleane harte O God: he ſayde it not, asPſal. 50. though he wāted a hart, but he deſired a pure hart to be put in him, &amp; made perfect. In like ſenſeEpheſ. 2. 
                        alſo is that ſpoken: that he shoulde create two, into one newe man, that is: he shoulde couple. Se likewiſe this, whether it may be taken after the ſame maner: to put on the new man which is created after God. Againe: If there be any new creature in Chriſt: &amp; ſuch like phraſes the which with diligent ſearche we may finde in the holy Scriptures. Maruell not then if the Scripture metaphorically doe vſe this kinde of ſpeach: the Lord made me the beginning of his wayes, made that is, appoynted or ordayned. theſe were the reaſons of Euſebius in his bookes againſt Marcellus, and cited of vs to this ende, that the mouthes of ſuch as vnaduiſedly do ſclaunder him, and contumeliouſly report of him, may therwith be ſtopped. They are not able to proue (although the wordes of the order and maner be vſually and commonly founde throughout his workes) that he aſſigned vnto the ſonne of God, a beginning of eſſence: for all that he was a great follower and fauorer of Origens workes, where, whoſoeuer can attaine vnto the ſecrete and hidd ſenſe of Origens bookes, he ſhall finde euery where, the ſonne to haue bene begotten of the father. thus haue we vſed digreſſion, for to ridd Euſebius out of the ſclaunderous mouthes of ſuſpicious heads.

                     AFter that both the Biſhops aſſembled at Sardice, and alſo the biſhops aſſembled at Philippi a citie of Thracia, in their ſeuerall councells had decreed ſuch things as ſeemed good vnto them ſelues, they returned euery man to his owne home.

Immediatly after, the Emperour of the Weſt parts of the world, certified his brother Conſtantius, of the things decided in the councel of Sardice: &amp; requeſted him to ſee Paulus &amp; Athanaſius placed in their biſhoprikes.

ſent for Athanaſius vnto him. In the meane while, Conſtans the Weſterne Emperour had ſent Paulus honorably, together with two Biſhops, with his owne letters, and with the letters of the councell for the more ſuretie, vnto Conſtantinople. When Athanaſius feared &amp; doubted, whether he were beſt goe or no vnto Conſtantius (for the falſe reports of ſclaunderous perſons troubled him very ſore) the Eaſterne Emperour Conſtantius by name, ſent for him not once, but the ſeconde and the thirde time, euen as his letters turned out of the latine into the greeke doe declare, and by tranſlation as followeth.

                              Conſtantius the puyſant &amp; noble Emperour vnto Athanaſius the Bishop ſendeth greeting. Although by our former letters, vve haue ſignified vnto thy vviſedome after the plaineſt maner, that with ſecure mind &amp; ſafe conduyte, thou shouldeſt come vnto our courte, becauſe we were fully determined to reſtore thee vnto thy former dignitie: for all that, vve haue ſent theſe letters alſo, vnto thy holines, that thou hire a common vvaggon, and remouing all timorous thoughts from thy miſtruſtfull minde, thou ſpeedely repaire vnto vs, to the ende thou mayeſt the ſooner enioy thy long vvished deſires.

                              Conſtantius the puyſant and noble Emperour vnto Athanaſius the Bishop ſendeth greeting. Being of late at Edeſſa, vvhere there vvere alſo of thy prieſtes then preſent, it ſeemed good vnto vs, to ſend one of them vnto thee, that thou shouldeſt haſten vnto our court, and after thy comming into our preſence, vvithour delay returne into Alexandria. And for as much as it is novve a greate vvhile agoe, ſince thou receauedſt our letters, and haſt differred thy iourney: therefore novv alſo vve thought good to putt thee in remembrance, that vvithout delay thou come vnto vs, and ſo thou shalt poſſeſſe the libertie of thy contrey, and thy long vvished eaſe and quietnes. To the ende thou mighteſt fully perſvvade thy ſelfe of all the premiſes, vve ſent vnto thee Achetas the Deacon, of vvhome thou shalt vnderſtand, both vvhat our purpoſe is, and alſo hovv that thy harty deſires shall preuaile. Athanaſius bing at
                               Aquileia (for he had remoued thither from Sardice) receaued theſe letters. thence he went in poſt to Rome, ſhewed the letters to Biſhop Iulius: and recreated very much the Church of Rome. for Conſtantius the Eaſterne Emperour ſeemed to be of the ſame fayth and opinion with them, when he ſent for Athanaſius home. Iulius certified the clergy, and layetie of Alexandria in his letters of Athanaſius as followeth.
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           The epistle of Iulius Biſhop of Rome, vnto the Priestes and people of Alexandria.
                           
                              Iulius Bishop of Rome vnto the prieſtes, deacons &amp; people inhabiting Alexandria, welbeloued brethren, ſendeth greeting in the Lorde. I doe greatly reioyce vvith you (vvel beloued brethren) that henceforth you may behold with your eyes, the frute of your faith. that truely is to be

ſeene in my brother &amp; fellowe Bishop Athanaſius: whome God hath reſtored vnto you, partly for his ſyncere &amp; godly life, &amp; partly alſo by the meanes of your prayers. hereby it may eaſily be coniectured vvhat pure and feruent prayers, you haue alvvayes poured vnto God. For when you called to remembrance the heauenly promiſes, &amp; the entire affection you beare vnto them, all which you learned of my foreſaid brother: you vnderſtood plainly &amp; through the right faith ingraffed in your mindes, you were fully perſvvaded, that Athanaſius (whome in your godly mindes you behelde preſent) shoulde not alwayes be abſent, and continually be ſeuered from you. VVherfore I neede not vſe many words vnto you, for whatſoeuer I ſay, the ſame hath your faith preuented: &amp; whatſoeuer commonly you all hartely deſired, the ſame through the grace of God is now fully come to paſſe. And that I may repeate the ſame againe: I doe greately reioyce vvith you, that you haue continevved ſo firmely and ſo ſtedfaſtly in the fayth, that by no meanes you could be vvithdravven from it. Moreouer I doe no leſſe reioyce at my brother Athanaſius, vvho, notwithſtanding the manifold calamities &amp; ſundry miſeries he endured, yet remembred almoſt euery houre, your entire loue &amp; great longing for him. &amp; although for a ſeaſon he ſeemed to be abſent from you in body: yet liued he alwayes as if he had bene preſent with you, in the ſpirite. I thinke verily (welbeloued brethren) that all the temptations &amp; paines he endured, are not voyd of their praiſe &amp; commendation. for by this meanes both your faith &amp; his, hath bene knowen &amp; made manifeſt vnto the whole worlde. If he had not bene tryed with ſuch great and lamentable temptations, who euer would haue thought ſo ſtayed a cenſure to haue reſted in your minds, or ſo feruēt loue &amp; affection to haue faſtened your minds vpon ſo notable a bishop: or that he was the man that excelled in ſuch rare gifts, by the meanes whereof he is made partaker of the hope which is layd vp for vs in heauen. VVherefore he hath attayned vnto a notable teſtimony of his faith, not only in this life but in the life to come. For by the pacient ſufferance of much aduerſity, by ſea &amp; by lande, he hath trampled &amp; trodd vnderfoote, all the malicious treacheries of the Arians. Oftētimes by reaſó of the aduerſaries ſpite, he ſtood in great hazard of his life, yet made he no accompt of death: but for all that, through the grace of almighty god, &amp; the power of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, he eſcaped their hands: wherby he conceaued good hope, that in the ende he should quit him of his aduerſaries, &amp; be reſtored to the comfort of you all, &amp; beare away together with you the victorious garland; of good workes &amp; well doing: in that he is already famous euen to the endes of the world: highly cōmended for his good life: renowmed for his free &amp; conſtant perſeuerance, in the defence of the chriſtian &amp; heauenly faith, &amp; regiſtred by the cenſure of you al to immortall memory, for the ſinguler loue &amp; affection he shewed towards you. VVherfore he is returned vnto you, bedecked with greater excellēcy &amp; renowm, thē before his departure. If the fire accuſtomed to try exquiſitly the purity of fine &amp; precious mettall, as of golde or ſiluer: what can be ſpokē of ſo notable a mā, in reſpect of his worthines, who after the quēching of ſo many fiery flames of ſedition: after the recouering of ſo many daūgerous perills &amp; greuous downfalls, is now reſtored vnto you &amp; foūd innocent not only by our determination, but by the decree &amp; cēſure of the whole councell? Entertaine therfore (welbeloued brethren) your bishop Athanaſius, &amp; alſo ſuch as haue bene partakers of his affliction, with all reuerēce, ioy &amp; gladnes. Reioyce in that you haue obtained your deſires: in that you haue as it were fed, &amp; quēched with your letters the thurſt, of your sheepheard, hūgering &amp; thurſting in his abſence, after your godly zeale. for in ſo doing, during his abode in foraine &amp; farre cōtries, you comforted him not a litle: &amp; while he was toſſed toe &amp; fro, with the ſtormes of perſecution, &amp; intangled with the ſnares of his malicious aduerſaries, you mitigated his grief &amp; ſorow, by ſending vnto him tokens, of your faithful &amp; feruent minds towards him. VVhen that I thinke with my ſelf, &amp; caſt in my mind the cōceaued ioy of you all, at his returne: the flocking multitude ful of religion &amp; godlines: the ſolemne feaſt of ſage perſons aſſembled together: what kind of day the returne of my brother vnto you is like to be: I can not chuſe but conceaue wonderful ioy. ſpecially for that the ſchiſme &amp; diſcord which raigned heretofore is now plucked vp by the rootes: for that his honorable return according vnto your owne harts deſire, hath replenished you with incredible ioye &amp; gladnes. ſo that the ioye for the greatnes thereof, hath reached vnto vs, to whome it is geuen from aboue, to haue acquaintāce &amp; familiarity with ſo excellent a man. It ſeemeth good that we end our epiſtle with a prayer▪ god almighty, &amp; his ſóne our lord &amp; Sauiour Ieſus, geue you alwaies of his grace, &amp; graunt you of his mercy the rewarde of ſo noble a faith, the which you haue shewed towards your Bishop, with ſo worthy a teſtimony: that both you and yours, may, not only in this world,

but alſo in the life to come, enioy farre more excellent giftes, vvhich neither eye hath ſeene, neither1.

                        Athanaſius hauing gott theſe letters, came into the Eaſt. Conſtantius the emperour, although at that time he receaued him not vnwillingly: yet geuing eare vnto the crafty ſleights of the diſpitefull
                         Arians, went about to begile him, reaſoning with him in this ſort: For all thou art reſtored vnto thy bishoprike by theThe conference of Conſtantius and Athanaſius. decree of the councell &amp; our ovvne determination: yet becauſe there are in Adexandria certaine people differing in opinion from thine, &amp; ſeuering them ſelues from thy communiō, my requeſt is that thou permitt them one church for them ſelues. Athanaſius made anſwere vnto his requeſt very wittely &amp; ſayd:
                         O Emperour it lieth in thee to do as pleaſeth thee beſt: to commaunde &amp; to execute the commaundement. I alſo vvil craue of thee an other thing for recompence, my humble requeſt is that thou graunt it me. When the emperour made anſwere, that with moſt willing minde he woulde condeſcende thereunto, Athanaſius immediatly ſayd: Mine humble ſute is that I may obtaine that vvhich thou vvouldeſt haue had at my hands, to vvete: that thou vvilt graunt one Churche throughout euery citye, for ſuch as communicate not vvith the Arians. The Arians perceauing that the requeſt of Athanaſius was not vnreaſonable, made anſwere yt it behoued them to differre that matter vnto an other time, and conſider better of it. they hindred not the emperour, but ſuffred him to do that which pleaſed him beſt. Wherefore the Emperour reſtored Athanaſius, Paulus, Marcellus, Aſclepas biſhop of Gaza, and Lucius Biſhop of Adrianopolis, euery one to his owne biſhoprike againe. theſe two hindemoſt were admitted by the councell of Sardice: Aſclepas for that he ſhewed records, wherby it appeared that both Euſebius Pamphilus &amp; ſundry others, vnderſtood fully of his caſe, and reſtored him to his dignitie: Lucius for y• his accuſers fledd away. by the emperous edict they all receaued their owne ſeaes, the cities were commaunded to entertaine them wt willing &amp; cheerefull mindes. At
                         Ancyra there was no ſmall ſturre, by reaſon that Baſilius was remoued and Marcellus reſtored in his place, ſo that the aduerſaries tooke therby occaſion, to ſclaunder Marcellus againe. The citizens of Gaza receaued Aſclepas willingly. At Conſtantinople, Macedonius for a ſeaſon gaue rowme vnto Paulus, &amp; had ſeuerall meetinge &amp; conuenticles at a certaine church of the city. But as toutching Athanaſius, y• emperour ſent letters vnto the biſhops, vnto the clergie and laytie of
                         Alexandria, that they ſhould receaue him both louingly &amp; willingly. he commaunded moreouer by his letters y• ſuch acts as were recorded agaynſt him in their courts and ſynods, ſhould be blotted out▪ his letters in the behalfe of both the aforeſayd are theſe.
                     
                     
                        
                           The Epiſtle of Conſtantius in the behalfe of Athanaſius the Biſhop.
                           
                              Conſtantius the puyſant, the mighty &amp; noble Emperour, vnto the Bishops and Prieſtes of the catholike church ſendeth greeting. It appeareth euidently, that Athanaſius the reuerend bishop, vvas not deſtitute of the grace &amp; goodnes of God. although by the iudgment &amp; cenſure of men he vvas iniuriouſly dealt vvithall, &amp; vniuſtly condemned for a litle vvhile: yet the diuine prouidence of almighty God, the beholder of all things, pronounced of him the iuſt ſentēce of innocency, ſo that by the vvill of God and our decree, he recouered both his natiue ſoyle, and proper church, vvhere the holy Ghoſt had aſſigned him gouernour. He is to receaue at our handes, ſuch things as our clemency, being led by right and reaſon shall think conuenient for him, ſo that all vvhatſoeuer hath bene heretofore decreed againſt ſuch as communicated vvith him, be henceforth quite forgotten: that all ſuſpicion raiſed of him, be henceforth remoued: &amp; that his clergy (reaſon ſo requiring) may enioy ſuch liberty, freedome &amp; priuiledge as they haue done in times paſt. Moreouer of our ſoueraigne benignity tovvards him, vve haue thought good to adde this alſo, that as many as are allotted into the ſacred ſenate of the clergy, may vnderſtande of trueth, that vve haue graunted ſafety &amp; good leaue, to as many as cleaue vnto him, be they Bishops or vvhat other degree ſoeuer of the clergy. euery ons firme &amp; ſure conſent in this behalfe, shalbe a ſufficient ſigne or token of his faithfull minde &amp; purpoſe. VVe haue commaunded that ſuch as embrace his communion, addicting them ſelues vnto the ſounder opinion &amp; better ſentence, all alike novv, by our permiſſion, as heretofore by the prouidence of God may enioye the benefitts beſtovved vpon them from aboue.

                              Conſtantius the puyſant, the mighty and noble Emperour, vnto the people of the Catholike

church of Alexandria ſendeth greetinge. In as much as vve laye alvvayes before our eyes your good and politike gouernement, as a marke to shoote at, or looking glaſſe to behold our owne eſtate, and ſeinge that you were bereued of your Byshop Athanaſius, a man approued both for ſounde learninge, and honeſt liuinge: we determined with our ſelues, to ſende him vnto you againe. Receaue him therefore honorably, after your accuſtomed maner: ioyne him with you as an helper in your prayers vnto God: endeuer alwayes to retayne amongeſt you cōcord &amp; peace both fit for your owne perſons, and gratefull vnto vs, accordinge vnto the ſacred decrees of the church. For it is not requiſit that diſſentiō &amp; debate should moleſt &amp; diſquiet the peaceable eſtat of theſe our proſperous dayes. Our deſire is that ſuch a plague be purged farre from amōgſt you: our requeſt is (welbeloued people of Alexādria) that in your prayers, where you craue (after your wōted cuſtome) the aid &amp; aſiſtance of the ſpirit of God, you take Athanaſius for chiefe, or (as I ſayd before) an helper: to the end, according vnto your happy &amp; proſperous ſucceſſe, the Hethenishe nations as yet ſnared with the erroneous ſeruice of Idols, may haſten with moſt willinge mindes to embrace the profeſſion of our moſt holy fayth. VVe counſell you this alſo, that you perſeuere in the things we rehearſed before: that you entertaine willingly your Bishop, ſent vnto you by the mighty power of God &amp; our louing pleaſure: &amp; that you count him worthy all curteous ſalutatiō. For a of ſurety this is comely for you &amp; cōuenient for our highnes. VVe haue alſo charged the iudges &amp; gouernours of thoſe prouinces by our letters, that they should weede all the tares of ſpite &amp; cōtention, out of the minds of malicious perſons, &amp; punish ſeuerely ſeditious &amp; buſy bodies. wherfore ſeing that you vnderſtād all theſe circūſtances, that our pleaſure is agreable with the will of God: that we haue care ouer you for the maintenance of concord &amp; vnity: that we haue aſſigned punishmente for troubleſome and ſeditious perſons: obſerue diligently the things whiche are correſpondent vnto the ordinances of the church, &amp; the ſeruice of God, embrace this Athanaſius with all honor &amp; reuerēce, &amp; poure out prayers vnto God the father, who gouerneth all thinges, both for your ſelues &amp; alſo for the concorde &amp; quietenes of the whole world.

If any thing be founde decreed and recorded heretofore, to the preiudice, hurte, or damage of ſuche as comunicate with Athanaſius the Bishop, our will is that the ſame wholly be abrogated &amp; diſſanulled. Our pleaſure is moreouer that his clergie shall enioy the like francheſſe &amp; liberty, as in times paſt: we will haue this cōmaundement put in vre, as that Athanaſius the bishop is reſtored to his ſeae: ſo all the clergie of his communion, may recouer and poſſeſſe the like libertye, with other eccleſiaſticall perſons, and ſo beinge, liue at hartes eaſe.

He got him thence to Ieruſalē, &amp; opening vnto Maximus both y• coūcel of Sardice, &amp; alſo y• Emperoure Conſtatius agreement &amp; conſent therein, he procured a ſynod of Biſhops to be aſſēbled there. For Maximus without all delay, cited thither certaine Biſhops out of Syria &amp; Palaeſtina. The aſſembly being gathered together, he gaue Athanaſius y• cōmunion, &amp; aſſigned vnto him his dignity. The councel being diſſolued, wrote &amp; ſignified by their letters, vnto the people of Alexādria, vnto y• biſhops of Aegypt &amp; Libya, all their decrees &amp; canōs toutching Athanaſius, wherefore all y• aduerſaries of Athanaſius cried out againſt Maximus, becauſe y• aſoretime he had ſubſcribed to his depoſitiō, nowe againe repenting him of his folly, as if he had not thē done well, he became of his faith, &amp; awarded him both y• cōmunion &amp; his dignity. Whē 
                        Vrſacius &amp; Valens who afore time were earneſt followers of Arius, vnderſtood of this, they condemned their former doings &amp; got then to Rome: there they exhibit vnto biſhop Iulius, their recantation &amp; repētance in

writing: they ſubſcribe vnto the creede contayning the clauſe of One ſubſtance, and they wryte vnto Athanaſius, that thenceforth they will cōmunicate with him. Vrſacius &amp; Valens being thus wonne with the proſperous ſucceſſe of Athanaſius his affaires, agreed (as I ſayde before) vnto the clauſe of One ſubstance. But Athanaſius trauelinge by Peleuſium, the ready way to Alexandria, preached in euery citie where he came, and exhorted them to eſchewe the Arians and to embrace ſuch as confeſſed the faith of One ſubſtance. And in diuers of the churches, alſo he ordayned miniſters, whiche gaue occaſion vnto the aduerſaries, for to accuſe him againe, that he preſumed to make miniſters in other mens prouinces.

                        Of Magnentius and Bretanion the tyrantes, and of the death of Conſtans theCap. 25. in the Greeke. westerne Emperoure.
                     
                     IN the meane while the quiet eſtate of the common weale was not a litle out of ſquare, whereof I will briefly entreate and runne ouer ſuche thinges as I haue determined with my ſelfe to laye downe. After the death of Constantine who buylded Conſtantinople, his three ſonnes (as I haue ſayde in my firſt booke) ſucceded him in the Empire. Of which numbre we haue to vnderſtande, that Conſtantinus, ſo called after his fathers name, was one, and raygned together with the reſte of the Emperoures, whome the ſouldiers ſlewe, after he had raygned a very litle while, &amp; as Conſtantius cōmaunded not he ſhould not be ſlayne, ſo againe he forbad not the ſlaughter. But how that Conſtātinus the yonger, breaking out into the borders of his brothers dominions, loſt his lif, whileſt that he fought hande to hande with the ſouldiers, I haue oft mentioned before. After whoſe death there roſe warres betwene the Perſians &amp; y• 
                        Romains, where Conſtantius had but ill fauored ſucceſſe. For the campe beinge pitched in the night time, about the boundes of the Romaine and Perſian dominions, the Perſian hoſte ſeemed then to preuaile, and for a time to haue the vpper hand. Then alſo the eccleſiaſticall affaires went very troubleſome, for there was great contention in the Church about Athanaſius, and the clauſe of One ſubſtance. Theſe things being at this point, Magnentius the tyrant became a rebell in the Weſt partes of the worlde, and throughe treaſonMagnentius the tyrant is of Futropius called Maxē

This beinge wrought there enſued great and grieuous warres. Magnentius the tyrant inuaded all Italie, ſubdued Aphrick and Libya and tooke alſo Fraunce.

The Emperoure who aforetime was addicted vnto the Arian hereſie, wreſted all the things he had lately decreed, into the contrary parte. And firſt of all he baniſheth Palus Biſhop of Conſtatinople, whome the meſſengers or guydes that brought him to exile, ſtifled very lewdly at Cucuſum a citie in Cappadocia.

Yet Athanaſius was not ignorant of the Emperours greate rage, but being quickely made priuey thereunto, fled away &amp; ſo auoyded the Emperours threates.

As many as cleaued vnto y• Creede containinge y• clauſe of one ſubſtance, were not onely cut of from y• churches, but alſo baniſhed altogether the cities.

                        mitted then at Alexandria, by Georgius the Arian, for he was preſent and felte himſelfe ſome parte of the lamentable afflictiō. In the Apologie which he wrote in the defence of his flight he declareth the behauiour of the Arians in this ſorte: There came to Alexandria certaine people
                        Athanaſius Apollogie. 
                        which ſought vs out, to execution, ſo that the ending was farre worſe then the beginninge. The ſouldiers vnwares beſet the church: in ſteede of deuout ſeruice of God, they take in hand deſperat ſwords. Thē 
                           Georgius that was ſent by them frō Cappadocia, cōming in lent time, added of his owne vnto the lewd practiſes which he learned of them. After that the Eaſter weeke was ended, the virgins beganne to be clapt in priſon: the Bishops were bound &amp; led by bands of ſouldiers: the fatherles and widowes were diſpoſſeſſed of their houſes: the families were rifled: the Chriſtians were violently trayled and lugged out of their houſes: theyr dores were nayled vp: the clergie mens bretherne were in greate daunger of theyre liues, for theyr brethernes ſake.
                        
                        theſe thinges ſeemed very grieuous, but the afterclaps were farre ſorer. The week after whitſontide, the people did faſt, they got thē therefore into the churchyarde for to pray becauſe they all abhorred the cōmunion of Georgius. But whē this paſſing lewd man vnderſtood of it, he ſtirred vp againſt thē on Sebaſtianus a captaine, who alſo was a Manichee. He forthwith together with
                        Sabaſtianusa captaine, yet a Manichee and a greate blood ſucker 
                        a great troope of ſouldiers, all in armour, hauinge naked ſwords in their handes, bowes and arrowes prepared, ranne vpon the people as they were a praying on the ſonday. VVhen he found there but a fewe (for the hower being paſt the greater parte was gone away) he comitted ſuche haynous actes as became very well his perſon. He ſette on fire a greate company of fagottes: he made the virgins to ſtande nigh the burninge flame▪ he went about to conſtraine them to confeſſe the Arian faith. But when he peceaued they woulde not yelde, and that they deſpiſed the burninge heate of that horrible fire: he ſtripped them ſtarke naked: he buffeted them about the head and the face, ſo that of a longwhile after, they were ſcarſe knowen of theyr owne friendes. Moreouer he tooke fortie perſons, and plagued them with a newe kinde of tormēt neuer heard of before. Theyr backs and ſides were ſo ſcurged and rente with palme twigges newely pluckt of the trees, hauinge on their prickinge knobs. So that diuers becauſe of the ſtumpes that ſtucke in the fleshe of their backes, were conſtrained often times to repayre vnto ſurgions: others ſome not able to endure ſuche terrible payne dyed of their wounds. As many of the men, as remained yet aliue, together with the virgins, were exiled, and ledde by the ſouldiers to Oaſis. The deade carkaſſes not yet fully colde, were denied the friendes of the deſeaſed: being throwen here and there and lying vnburied (for that liked them beſt) the ſouldiers hidde them, as if they had bene neither culpable neither fauty in committinge ſuche horrible crimes. This did they, hauing their mindes ouershadowed with the furious rage of frentike hereſie. And when as the deare friendes and familiars of the deade, reioyced at the bold proteſtation of their faith, yet ſorowed becauſe their carkaſſes were not couered with earth: the ſauadge impietie and beaſtlye cruelty of theſe ſouldiers, reuealed it ſelfe with greater shame and infamie. Moreouer they banishe forthwith certaine Bishops of Aegypt and Libya, namely Ammon, Thmuis, Gaius, Philon, Hermes, Plinius, Pſenoſiris, Nilammon, Agathon, Anagamphus, Marcus, Dracontius, Adelphius, Athenodorus, a ſeconde

                         Theſe were y• practiſes of Georgius at Alexandria, by the reporte of Athanaſius. The Emperoure marched forewardes with his hoſte to Illyrium, for thither of neceſſity was he conſtrained to goe, and there it was that Bretanion was proclaimed Emperor. As ſoone as he came to Sirmium, truce beinge made, he came to parlee with Bretanion. In the meane while he endeuored to winne againe the ſouldiers, which had refuſed him for their Emperoure, after he had ſo done, they proclaimed Conſtantius alone, both their Auguſtus, their kinge, &amp;The clemē

In this their proclamation there was no mention of Bretanion, who ſeinge himſelfe betrayed, fell downe proſtrate at the Emperoures feete, and craued for mercy. Conſtantius taking from him his princely ſcepter, and purple robe, lifted him vp by the hande very curteouſly, and exhorted him, after the callinge of a priuate man, to leade a quiet and peceable life. He ſayde moreouer, that it was fitter for an olde man ſuche as he was, to embrace a trade of life that were voyde of all trouble &amp; care, thē to gape after a vaine title of honor, full of diſquietnes &amp; moleſtatiō. Thus it fared with Bretanion in the ende. The Emperoure commaunded that all his charges ſhoulde be geuen him of the publique tribute, afterwardes he wrote vnto him ſundry letters to Prouſa a citie in Bithynia, where he made his abode: ſignifyinge what ſingular pleaſure he had done vnto him, in riddinge him from cares &amp; troubles, ſhewinge alſo what miſerie, oftentimes befalleth to raigne and gouernement: and that of his owne parte he had dealte vnaduiſedly in not geuing to him ſelfe that which he graunted to an other. So farre of theſe thinges.

                         two others in the Latine tongue, agreeing neither in word neither in compoſition, neither in ſenſe neither in ſentence, either with thēſelues, or with that which the Bſhop of Arethuſa wrote in Greeke. One of the Latine formes I will here lay downe, immediatly after the Greeke forme of Marcus. The other afterwards rehearſed at Sirmium, I will referre to his proper plate.

But his purpoſe tooke no proſperous ſucceſſe. for nere nother of y• Councells agreed▪ within them ſelues, both was deuided into ſundry factions. For neither could the biſhops which mett at Ariminū
                         in Italy, agree amonge them ſelues, neyther the biſhops of the Eaſt among them ſelues, for they rayſed a newe ſchiſme at Seleucia a citie of Iſauria, but howe all this came to paſſe, I will hereafter rehearſe in proceſſe of our diſcourſe, if that firſt I ſay ſomewhat of Eudoxius.

The Emperour litle thinkinge what fetches he had in his heade, gaue him his paſport.Eudoxius. b. of Antioche. He through the ſute and furtherance of the Emperours chamberlaynes, left his owne citie, and crept through wyle and ſubtletie into the byſhopricke of Antioche: he endeuoureth to restore Actius agayne into the church: and goeth about to ſummone a Councell of byſhops, and to make him Deacon agayne. But his lewde dryft was longe in brynginge about, becauſe the hatred owed vnto Actius was of more force to repell him, then the hartie good wyll and furtherance Eudoxius vſed to reſtore him. but of this we neede no more wordes. Of them which aſſembled at Ariminum, the Eaſterne byſhops not mentioninge the buſineſſe aboute Athanaſius, ſignified that the cauſe of their comminge was to diſcourſe of other matters.

                           Ʋalens, who at the firſte were Arians, and afterwards exhibited a recantation vnto the byſhop of Rome, ſubſcribing (as I ſayd before) vnto the clauſe of One ſubſtance: ſtoode them in great ſtead, for theſe two, continewally cleaued vnto the ſtronger and the ſurer ſide.

Euery one of them hauinge reſpect vnto their ovvne hereticall doctrine, haue layde dovvne their ſeuerall cenſures. Furthermore vvhen they take penne in hand to pronounce vvhat they thinke of the Lorde, they name vnto them ſelues an other Lorde, to vvete, Constantius. for it vvas he that opened them the gapp vnto impietie. And vvhile they denied the ſonne of God to be aeternall (for they fell into ſuch outragious impietie, they became deadly foes vnto the Chriſtia faith) yet they intitled the Eniperour ſempiternall. But peraduēture they tooke example of the holie prophets, vvho noted vnto vs the times they lyued in, for to intitle their creeds with the names of Conſulls. If they preſume to alleage them as a preſident to their doynges, they are foully deceaued, and bevvray very much their owne ignorance and folly. For though the Prophets made mention of the tymes they lyned in, as vve reade in Eſay and Oſeas, who lyued in the dayes of Ozia, Ioathan, Achaz, and Ezech
                                 •

It vvas long before their times, it vvas from enerlaſting, it vvas before the foundacions of the vvorld vvere layd, the which verily God him ſelfe, by Chriſt hath prepared for vs. The tymes vvhen theyr fayth had her originall▪ they dyd not ſignifie, for there had bene faithfull men longe before them: but thoſe vvere the dayes vvhen ſuch promiſes of God &amp; prophecies of thinges to come vvere preached by them. The promiſes verily concerned chiefly the incarnatiō of our ſauiour: the circumſtances thereof and ſuch thinges as vvere annexed therevnto, ſignified plainely the thinges that should happē both to Iewes &amp; to Gentils. Moreouer in the aforeſayd ſpecified times, their faith (as I ſayd before) had not her firſt foundatiō &amp; beginning but the prophets thē ſelues: for they liuing thē foreshewed ſuch things to come. But theſe our fouthſaiers, neither writing of ſtories, neither prophecying of things to come do write, This Catholicke faith was publiſhed: adding immediatly thervnto the names of the Conſulls, the moneth of the yeare, &amp; the day of the vveeke. Euen as the holy men of old haue declared both the times of the matters they wrote of, and the yeares of their owne miniſterie: ſo theſe men haue noted vnto vs the dayes when their faith firſt beganne. I would to god they had only vvritten their owne beliefe, for now they haue aſſigned an originall or beginninge of their faith, and they fall a reaſoninge of it, as if it had neuer bene heard of before. They vvrite not, This is our beliefe, but in this fort, This Catholicke faith was publiſhed. VVherfore their bold &amp; preſſipteous enterpriſe bewraieth their barren &amp; wirles braines:
                        
                        and their nevve founde faith is no othervviſe, in playne vvordes, then the Arian hereſie. So they vvrote, then they beganne to beleeue, from that tyme forth they determined to reueale theyr faith in no other ſenſe then vve reade in Luke the Euangeliſt: There vvas geuen out then
                        Luc. 2. 
                        a commaundement from Augustus Caeſar, that the vvhole vvorlde should be taxed. that commaundement vvas not geuen before, but then tooke place from thoſe dayes forth, and vvas published by him vvhich vvrote it. So vvhen theſe men doe vvryte: This faith is nowe publiſhed, they shevve theyr errour nevvly inuented, and not to haue bene before. But if they adde the vvorde Catholicke, they plunge them ſelues vnvvares in the hereticall pudle of the Cataphrygians: ſo that they ſinge after theyr note: The Christian faith was reuealed vnto vs, The Christian faith beganne of vs. And as they tooke Maximilla and Montanus for theyr Lorde, ſo theſe men in ſteede of Chriſt haue choſen Constantius. If the fayth beganne in thoſe dayes, in the tyme of theyr Conſulships, vvhat shall become of the auncient fathers and bleſſed martyrs? VVhat shall become of them, vvhome theſe men them ſelues inſtructed in the fayth, and departed this lyfe before theſe Conſulls? Hovve shall they rayſe them from the deade, to roote out of theyr mindes their former religion, and to plant afreshe their late inuention of faith? They are ſo ſenſeleſſe and ſo voyde of vnderſtandinge, that they can doe nought elſe ſaue forge out fayned cauſes: the vvhich beynge as they are both fonde, ſlender, &amp; vpon ſlippery foundations, may caſilie be confuted and ouerthrovven. Theſe were the contents of Athanaſius his epiſtle the which he ſent vnto ſome of his familiar friendes, the ſtudious may at theyr pleaſure examine it with them ſelues, and knowe throughly ſuch thinges as he hath diſcourſed of, both ſubtly and ſubſtantially.

Wherefore takinge their depaſition impaciently, they runne vnto the Emperour, and ſhewe him the forme of faith that was read in the Councell. The Councell alſo wrote vnto the Emperour an epiſtle, wherein they ſignified vnto him what they had decreed, the which beynge tranſlated out of the Latine into the Breeke tongue, is vſually read as followeth.

Although it is not vnknowen vnto your holines, that vve haue alvvayes great care and conſideration of the diuine, the reuerend, and ſacred religion of Chriſt: yet had vve as yet no leaſure to talke vvith the tvventy Bishops, whome your wiſedomes ſent in embaſſie vnto vs. For vve haue hitherto bene vvholy occupied about the expedition we made againſt the Barbarians. And requiſite it is (as you knovve very vvell) for him that vvill deale in matters of religion, to be voyde of all care and troubleſome affayres. Therefore vve haue vvilled the Bishops to vvayte for our comming at Adrianopolis, ſo that vvhen vve haue rightly diſpoſed the common affayres of the publique weale, we may then geue care and wey diligently afterwards ſuch things as they shall lay before vs. In the meane vvhile let it not grieue your vviſedomes to expect their returne, that after their departure hence and the bringing of our anſvvere vnto you, ye may finish and conclude ſuch thinges as shalbe for the vſe and furtherance of the Catholicke Church. When the Biſhops had receaued theſe letters, they wrote backe againe vnto the Emperour in this ſorte. VVe haue receaued your maieſties gracious letters (moſt godly Emperour)The reſcript of the councell held at A

Your clemency moreouer knovveth as vvell as vve, hovve heauy and hovve lamentable a caſe it is, ſo many churches in the time of this your moſt bleſſed raigne, to be bereaued of their Bishops. And therefore vve are humbly to craue againe and againe (moſt holy Emperour) that before the sharpe and nipping ſeaſon of vvinter (if it ſo ſeeme good vnto your highnes) you wil licence vs to returne home vnto our Churches, to the ende vve may poure out together vvith the people our accuſtomed prayers vnto God the father Almighty and to our Lorde and Sauiour Chriſt, his onely begotten ſonne, for proſperous eſtate of your raigne, euen as we haue accuſtomed in times paſt, and yet ceaſe not to doe.
                        
                     
                      
                        After they had written thus and continewed there a while longer, when as the emperour voutchſafed not to anſwere them, euery one returned to his owne home. The Emperour becauſe he had purpoſed with him ſelfe to ſowe the Arian opinion throughout euery Church, &amp; endeuored with might and mayne euery where to preferre the ſame, tooke hereby occaſion at the Biſhops returne, to bring about his baynous offence: and ſayd, that in contempt, and deſpite of him, contrary to his will they had diſſolued the councell. Wherefore he gaue 
                              Ʋrſacius authoritie, freely at his pleaſure to practiſe all miſchiefe agaynſt the Churches of God: and commaunded him moreouer, to ſend into the Churches of Italie the forme of fayth that was read in the councell of Ariminum: and ſuch as would not ſubſcribe vnto the ſame ſhoulde be depoſed, and others placed in their rowmes.

Wherfore all the Weſterne partes of the worlde by reaſon of theſe newe deuiſes, were at great diſcorde and tumults, while that ſome were by force depoſed and ſent to exile, ſome other ſubſtituted in their rowmes, theſe thinges were wrought by vertue of the Emperours edicts ſent into the Weſt contries.

                        ſayd before) into the greeke tongue: to publiſhe and ſett forth the ſame with glorious titles as agreed vpon by a generall councell, calling it the Nicene fayth, to the intent that thereby, in vſing the name of Nice he might ſnare the ignorant, the rude and ſimple people. For they thought verily that it was the ſame forme of fayth, which of olde was confirmed at Nice a citie of Bithynia, but their forged pretence was no long furtherance vnto them. For in a ſhort while after their treachery was reuealed, and the authors thereof derided for their labor. So farre of ſuch thinges as were done in the Weſt.

                        The crueltie of Macedonius the Arian, and tumults rayſed by him at Constantinople and elſewhere.
                     
                     NOwe that we haue ſufficiently diſcourſed of the Weſt Churches, let vs turne our talke and direct our penne into the Eaſt, and there firſt beginne with the Arians: The Arian Biſhops being puffed vp with pride and confidence they put in the Emperours edicts, preſumed more boldly to bring their purpoſes to effect, but in what ſorte they ſommoned the councell I will afterwards declare, when that firſt I haue runne ouer their lewd practiſes before the councel. Acaius &amp; Patrophilus as ſoone as they had depoſed Maximus biſhop of Ieruſalem, placed Cyrillus
                        Cyrillus b. of Ieruſalem an Arian. The hainous practiſes of Macedonius the Arian. in his rowme. Macedonius went about vtterly to ouerthrow y• contries &amp; bordering cities of Conſtantinople, vſing his ſeruants &amp; miniſters as fit inſtruments to the defacing of the church of God. he made Eleuſius biſhop of Cyzicum: Marathonius
                         biſhop of Nicomedia, who afore time had bene deacon vnder Macedonius him ſelfe, &amp; very carefull about the affaires of men &amp; women, y• were addicted vnto monaſticall &amp; ſolitary life. But now heare how Macedonius went about to ouerchrow y• contries &amp; cities within y• prouince of Conſtantinople. This man, aſpiring (as I ſaid before) vnto y• biſhoprick, plagued infinitely ſuch as were determined to perſeuere in y• opinion contrary to his, &amp; thruſt out of the church not only ſuch as in y• councell ſeemed to vary from him, but alſo y• 
                        Nouatians (for he knew of ſuerty that they embraced the creede containing the clauſe of one ſubſtance) &amp; cruelly tormented them. Agelius their biſhop was faine to flie away for to ſaue his life. Many excellent &amp; notable men were then apprehended, and grieuouſly plagued, becauſe they refuſed to be partakers of their communion: yea after torments they were conſtrayned by force to communicate with them. for they ſtretched wide open and gagged their mouthes, they popped in the myſteries: ſuch as were thus handled tooke it farre more grieuous then all the other torments. they trayled women &amp; children by maine force into their communion. if any refuſed or gayneſayd their doings, immediatly they were ſcurged, after ſtripes impriſoned, and in the ende compelled to endure more bitter torments. Whereof I will alleadge one or two examples, whereby the woodnes and crueltie both of Macedonius, and alſo of others, who at that time were renowmed and famous for ſuch lewde feates, may euidently appeare vnto the whole worlde. Of the women that denied toThe cruelty of the Arian hereticks. communicate with them, ſome were layd along in cheſtes and at the lidds, their breaſtes ſawed of: ſome other had their papps burned with ſearing irons glowing hott, and with egges laid therunto that were roſted ſo harde, that they ſcalded for heate. Theſe newe kinde of torments neuer heard of before among Pagans &amp; Ethnicks were practiſed of theſe men which profeſſed chriſtianitie. Theſe things I my ſelfe haue heard Auxanon (of whome I ſpake in my firſt booke) reporte, being a very old man: who though he was a prieſt of the Nouatian Church, yet ſuffred he very much of the Arians, before he had entred into orders. He reported how that together with Alexander Paphlagon, who led a very ſtraict and ſeuere kinde of life, (after the ſame ſorte with him) he was impriſoned, ſcurged and endured many torments: that Alexander after the grieuous laſhes of the whipp dyed in priſon, and was buried nigh the ſea ſhore on the right hand as ye goe to Byzantium hauen, called Ceras, by interpretation an horne, where there is a Nouatian Church bearing the name of Alexander. They deſtroyed at the commaundement of Macedonius not onely other Churches in other cities, but alſo the Nouatian Church within the citie of Conſtantinople, nigh the ſigne of the ſtorke. but why I made mention of this ſeuerally, at this tyme, as I hearde with mine owne eares of Auxanon an olde graybearde: now I am about to declare. By the commaundement ofA lawe againſt the churches of God, made by Arians. the Emperour, and the cruelty of Macedonius, it was proclaymed that the churches of ſuch as embraced y• creede containing y• clauſe of one ſubſtance ſhould be throwen downe, euen to y• foundations. this law being ioined wt y• violēce of Macedonius proceaded to y• ouerthrow alſo of this church ſuch as were appoynted to bring theſe feates to paſſe, buſily occupied their braynes and promptly

diſpatched them. I can not chuſe but greatly maruell at the Nouatian ſecte, to ſee what ſinguler affection they bare vnto their Churche: and what charitable minde ſuch as then were depoſed by the Arians, but nowe enioy their Churches in peace, ſhewed towards them. For as ſoone as the commiſſioners for the ſuppreſſing of Churches had geuen the onſett, immediatly a great number of Nouatians, and diuers others which maintayned the doctrine of one ſubſtance, pulled downe that Church, remoued it to an other place, and there erected it againe. The place is ſituate right ouer againſt the citie, and at this day called Sycae, it is the thirtenth porcion of the prouince of Cō
                           ſtantinople. The church was remoued in a very ſhort ſpace, by reaſon that ſo great a multitude of people with great good will and promptnes of minde ſett to their helping handes. for one caryed the tyles, an other the ſtones, the thirde the timber, others conueyed other ſtuffe into Sycae. The women alſo and the children were a furtherance to the buylding, for they thought their prayers woulde be the ſooner hearde, and to profitt them ſelues very much, in that they imployed their labor and induſtrie to the conſecration of buylding vnto the Lorde. In that ſorte the Church of the Nouatians was tranſlated to Sycae, but after that, Conſtantius being dead, Iulianus the Emperour commaunded that the place where the Church aforetime had bene buylded, ſhoulde be giuen to the Nouatians. The people againe, in ſuch ſort as before, went about the buylding of the Church, and the tranſlating of the ſtuffe into the place where it ſtoode at the firſt, and being builded farre more gorgeous then it was at the firſt, they called it after the name of the reſurrection. That Church (as I ſayd before) was the thirde time buylded in the raigne of Iulianus. At that time both the true Catholiks and the Nouatians were a like handled. And becauſe the true chriſtians abhorred the temples where the Arians frequented, they reſorted together with the Nouatians vnto three other Churches (for the Nouatians had ſo many Churches permitted them in that city,) and there they deuoutly ſerued God together: litle there was to the contrary but that they had bene linked together in the bonde of vnitie and concorde, had the Nouatians not refuſed to retayne their olde mind, from the which they had fallen. But as toutching other matters ech embraced other, with ſuch ſinguler affection &amp; entire loue, that one was ready to hazard his life for the other. They were moleſted together not onely at Conſtantinople, but alſo in other cities and prouinces. In a while after Eleuſius who lately had bene placed Biſhop of Cyzicum, imitating the ſteppes of Macedonius,
                        Eleuſius a cruell Arian Biſhop. Macedonius an Arian &amp; a 
                              •
                           reat murtherer of the true Chriſtians. armed him ſelfe againſt the Chriſtians, afflicted them euery where &amp; tormented them grieuouſly: he made the Nouatian Church which was at Cyzicum euen with the grounde: and Macedonius gaue the laſt ſtroke and finall concluſion to the haynous offences which he committed. For vnderſtanding that there were many both at Paphlagonia and Mantinium of the Nouatian opinion, which coulde by no meanes commodiouſly be remoued by Eccleſiaſticall authoritie: he procured that foure bands of ſouldiers at the Emperours commaundement ſhould be ſent into Paphlagonia, to the ende the inhabitants might be terrified with the great ſhewe of gliſtering armour, and thereby brought to embrace the Arian hereſie. But ſuch as inhabited Mantinium, being kindled with an earneſt zeale towards Chriſtian religion, went agaynſt the ſouldiers with chearefull mindes and valiant courage: after they had muſtred together a greate hoſt, they all marched forwards to battell: ſome had taken in their hande long hedging bills, ſome axes, ſome other mett by chaunce with ruſty armour. When they ioyned together and came to handygriping, many of the Paphlagonians were beaten downe, the ſouldiers (fewe onely excepted) were ſlaine euery one. Although there be many of the Paphlagonians which preſently can report y• ſame, yet haue I heard it of a certaine huſbandman of Paphlagonia, who had bene preſent him ſelfe at the ſkirmiſhe and borne away many blowes. And though Macedonius had wrought many ſuch notable feates (as he thought) in the behalfe of religion, where ſlaughter, and battell, and bondage and ciuill diſſentions fell out: yet that haynous offence of his procured vnto him and that moſt iuſtly, great hatred, not onely among them which then bare away incurable woundes (he being the cauſe thereof) but alſo among his owne familiar and deare friendes, ſo that the emperour alſo had him in diſple aſure and alienated his minde from him, partly for this thing, and partly for an other cauſe, which was as followeth. He went about to pull downe the temple where the tombe of the Emperour Conſtantine lay, and put the people which prayed within, and ſerued God deuoutly in great feare of their liues. Macedonius had purpoſed to tranſlate the Emperours bones, leſt the tombe with the falling of the temple ſhould breake, and deface y• monument. The people vnderſtanding of this withſtoodeThe tranſlatiō of bones and reliques is forbidden as an vnlawfull thing by the true chriſtians, but the Arians did practiſe it his enterpriſe, affirming it a thinge vnlawfull to tranſlate the Emperours bones, that it was in maner nothing elſe but the digging of him vp againe, out of his graue. The people was deuided

into two parts: the one iudged the deade carkaſſe in no wiſe to be iniuried with remouing: the other thought that wicked offence might lawfully be done. They which maintained the faith of one ſubſtance with generall conſent reſiſted the deede: but Macedonius making no accompt of the gainſayers, tranſlated the carkaſſe into y• church where Acacius the martyr had bene buried. This was no ſoner done, but the multitude of the contrary ſide ranne thither in all the haſt, they ſet them ſelues one againſt the other, &amp; without any delay they went together by y• eares. ſo great a ſlaughter was committed, that the body of the Church was aflote with ſtreames of blood, and yet not only there, but alſo from the Church porch vnto the ſtreete, the way was all blood and deade carkaſſes croſſing one an other. When the Emperour vnderſtoode of this woefull and lamentable caſe, he was wonderfully incenſed againſt Macedonius, partly for that he murthered ſo many men, and partly alſo that he durſt preſume without his conſent to tranſlate his fathers bones. After that he had committed the gouernment of the weſterne dominions vnto Iulian (whome lately he had made Caeſar) he returned into the Eaſt. but how Macedonius in a ſhort while after, was depriued of his biſhoprick, and receaued ſo ſmall a puniſhment for ſo greate an offence, I will declare in an other place.

                        Of the councell helde at Seleucia a city of Iſauria.
                     
                     NOwe I beginne to diſcourſe of the other councell reſembling the councell of Ariminum,
                        The councel of Seleucia held Anno Domi. 363. ſummoned alſo by the Emperours edict in the Eaſt. Although it pleaſed him at the firſt that the Biſhops ſhoulde meete at Nicomedia in Bithynia: yet the greate earthquake which ſhooke the countrey and ouerthrewe Nicomedia, was a let ſo that they coulde not aſſemble there. This came to paſſe in the conſulſhip of Tatianus and Cerealius the eyght and twentyeth of Auguſt. They conſulted for to remoue the councell into the citie of Nice which was not farre of, but altering their ſentence they appoynted to meete at Tarſus a citie of Cilicia. neyther yet coulde they all agree vpon that, and therefore they aſſemble at Seleucia a citie of Iſauria called Roughe. Theſe things were done in one and the ſame yeare, when Euſebius &amp; Hypatius were Conſuls. The number of Biſhops which met there was a hundred and threeſcore. There was alſo with them one Leônas a man of great autoritie &amp; fame in the Emperours court: in whoſe hearing it wasLeônas. commaunded by the emperours edict they ſhould reaſon of the faith. Lauricius alſo, captaine of theLauricius. garriſon in Iſauria, was commaunded to ſupply and miniſter vnto the Biſhops, whatſoeuer they wanted. The biſhops being met together the eight and twentieth of September diſputed to &amp; fro, their diſputation was laid downe in writing by publick notaries, for there were ſcriueners preſent of ſwift pēning &amp; great exerciſe, ready for to note their obiections, reſolutions, &amp; what other thing ſoeuer was vttered. All which thinges are at large ſet forth in the booke of Sabinus, intituled the collection of councells where the ſtudious Reader may peruſe them at his pleaſure: but I of my part will therfore runne ouer briefly the chiefe pointes therof. The firſt day of their aſſembly, Leônas commaunded, that euery one ſhould freely propoſe what pleaſed him beſt. but they that were preſent affirmed it was not lawful, to call any thing into queſtion before they came whoſe preſence was required in the councell. For Macedonius Biſhop of Conſtantinople, Baſilius
                         biſhop of Ancyra &amp; ſundry others were looked for of the councell: who miſtruſting their cauſe &amp; ſuſpecting they ſhould be accuſed of hainous crimes, abſēted them ſelues of ſet purpoſe. Macedonius pleaded ſicknesThe Arians abſent them ſelues with excuſes. for him ſelfe: Patrophilus, that he was ſandblinde, troubled with dropping &amp; bleare eyes: and by reaſon of the aforeſayd cauſes that of neceſſitie they were conſtrained to ſtay in the ſuburbes of Seleucia the reſt alleadged other cauſes of their abſence. And when Leônas ſaide they might propoſe queſtions for all they were abſent: the Biſhops anſwered, that it was not meete any thinge ſhould be reaſoned of, before they had firſt diligently examined the liues and conuerſation of ſuch as were accuſed. for Cyrillus biſhop of Ieruſalem, Euſtathius
                         biſhop of Sebaſtia in Armenia, and diuers others had hainous crimes laide to their charge. Wherefore there was great contention betwene them that were preſent whileſt y• the one part would firſt examine their liues, the other part reaſon and queſtion of the faith. The doubtfull and darke ſentence of the Emperour was cauſe of that hurlyburly. For the letters which he wrote vnto the councell commaunded one while one thinge, an other while an other thinge firſt to be handled. The varience that roſe among them that were preſent ſo deuided them, that it miniſtred occaſion vnto the councell of Seleucia to parte them ſelues into two factions: vnto the one ſide there cleaued Acacius Biſhop of Caeſarea in

                        Palaeſtina, Georgius
                         Biſhop of Alexandria, Vrſacius
                         Biſhop of Tyrus, Eudoxius
                         biſhop of Antioch together with thirty others: of the other ſide there were Georgius Biſhop of Laodicea in Syria, Sophronius
                         Biſhop of Pompeiopolis in Paphlagoma, Eleuſius
                         Biſhop of Cyzicum, together with many others. When that that ſide preuayled which firſt woulde haue had them reaſon of the faith: the Complices of Acacius motioned that the Nicene creede ſhoulde be abrogated and that a new forme of fayth was to be layde downe: the contrary part (being moe in number) approued all other thinges of the councell of Nice, the clauſe of one ſubſtance onely layde aſide. And when as they had thus brawled amonge them ſelues from morning to night, at length Siluanus Biſhop of Tarſus cryed out amonge them, that it was not their parte to laye downe a newe forme of fayth, but to retayne vnuiolably that which was decided at Antioch, at the dedication of the Churche. He had no ſooner ſpoken, but the confederats of Acacius roſe vp and gott them away: the other ſide bring forth the creede concluded vpon at Antioch, they reade it, and immediatly the councell was diſſolued. The day after, meeting together at the Churche of Seleucia, they barre the doores, and ratiſie with their ſubſcriptions the forme of fayth that was read the daye before. In their ſteede which were abſent, their readers and Deacons ſubſcribed, for they had ſignified before, that they woulde by their Deputies approue the aforeſayd creede.

                        Howe that Acacius of Caeſarea rehearſed an other creede in the councell of Seleucia: alſo how that he and his complices after the Emperours returne out of the weſt mett at Conſtantinople and procured the councell of Ariminum to be ratified adding thereunto of their owne.
                     
                     
                        ACacius and his complices founde great fault with the canons of that councell, becauſe they ſubſcribed when the Church doores were ſhutt▪ for (ſayth Acacius) the thinges which are done in huckermucker, as they ought not to be approued, ſo are they not voide of ſuſpicion. This he ſayde becauſe he caryed in his pockett an other forme of fayth ready to be offred vp. he read it in the preſence of Lauricius and Leônas that were noble men: and bent his whole might to haue onely the ſame confirmed. theſe thinges were done the ſeconde daye of the councell, and beſides nothing. The thirde day Leônas went about to call both partes together, at what time Macedonius Biſhop of Conſtantinoplē, and Baſilius Biſhop of Ancyra were preſent. When both theſe men mett together and preſented them ſelues, to wete of the contrary ſide vnto Acacius, his conſederats woulde not ſhewe their faces in the councell, but ſayde that it was requiſite they ſhould be baniſhed the aſſemblie, who of late had bene depoſed, and then alſo were accuſed. After much adoe when this ſide had the vpper hande, they that were accuſed left the councell, in whoſe rowmes Acacius together with his company ſucceded. Then Leônas ſtoode vp and ſayde that Acacius had preſented vnto him a booke: yet knewe they not that it was a forme of fayth, which confuted ſometymes priuely, ſometymes openly and playnly the opinion of the contrary ſide. When that all made ſilence and gaue diligent eare, thinking nothing leſſe then that it had bene a forme of fayth: at length, Acacius read his creede or fayth, with a certayne preface written before it as followeth: VVe vvhich by the Emperours edict mett yeſterday, that is the fift of the kalends of October at

VVe haue ſpoken theſe things to this end, that you may vnderſtand we reiect not the forme of fayth that vvas published &amp; confirmed in the dedication at Antioch: but vve bring forth the ſame preſently, ſithence that we knowe for ſuerty that the fathers then agreed vpon this controuerſie which concerned the faith. but in as much as the clauſes of vnity in ſubſtance, &amp; equality

VVe confeſſe playnely the likeneſſe the ſonne hath with the father, imitating the Apoſtle vvhere he ſaith of the ſonne, who is the image of the inuiſible God. VVe proteſt therefore and beleeue in one God, the father almighty
                        Acacius creede an Ariā biſhop. 
                        maker of heauen &amp; earth, of viſible and inuiſible things. VVe beleeue alſo in his ſonne our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, begotten of him before all vvorlds vvithout affection, God the vvord, of the only begotten God: the light, the life, the trueth, the vviſedome: by vvhome all things vvere made both in heauen and in earth, be they viſible or inuiſible. VVe beleeue that he in the latter dayes tooke flesh of the bleſſed virgine Mary, to the ende he might take avvay the ſinnes of the worlde: that he vvas made man, that he ſuffred for our ſinnes: that he roſe againe, aſcended into the heauens, ſitteth at the right hande of the father, and that he shall come againe vvith glorie to iudge both the quicke and the deade. VVe beleeue alſo in the holy Ghoſt, vvhome our Lorde and Sauiour called the comforter, promiſing after his departure to ſend him to his diſciples, vvhome alſo he hath ſent: by whome he ſanctifieth the faithfull in the Churche, and ſuch as are baptized in the name of the father, and of the ſonne, and of the holy Ghoſt. all thoſe that beſides this fayth shall publishe any other, vve doe excommunicate out of the holy and Catholicke Churche. This was Acacius creede, whereunto both he and his complices (as many in number as I reported before) ſubſcribed. The creede being reade, Sophronius Biſhop of Pompeiopolis in Paphlagoma, ſtoode vp and ſpāke agaynſt it in this maner, for I will vſe his owne wordes: If that the nevve deuiſes and dayly inuention of your brayne, be layde dovvne
                        The words of Sophronius vnto the Arians. 
                        for creedes: it can not othervviſe fall out, but that shortly, vve shall be founde vvithout one grayne of fayth. Theſe as I haue learned were the wordes of Sophronius. In my opinion if that his auncetors and ſuch as liued then with him, had ſo ſettled their myndes as toutchinge the Nicene councell, all this ſturre and tumultes had quite bene taken away, all this hurlyburly, this raſhe and vnaduiſed ſedition had neuer raygned in the Churche. but to what paſſe theſe thinges are nowe come, let them iudge that can better diſcerne and geue ſentence thereof. When they had reaſoned toe and fro of this matter, and of them that were accuſed, and brawled together a longe whyle, at length the councell brake vp. The fourth daye they aſſemble agayne, and a freſhe they chide one with an other. In circumſtance of talke Acacius gaue forthe this verditt as followeth: If the Nicene creede was once altered of olde, and afterwards often▪ what can you ſaye to the contrary, but that preſently a newe forme of fayth without any preiudice at all, may be eſtabliſhed of vs? whereunto Eleuſius made anſwere: We are not nowe come to this aſſemblie for to learne that which we learned before: neyther to receaue the fayth which we haue not receaued before: but to walke in the fayth of our forefathers, and not to fall from the ſame vnto our lyues ende. This was Eleuſius anſwere vnto Acacius, calling the creede of Antioch, the fayth of the fathers. but a man may here replye and ſaye thus: Howe O Eleuſius calleſt thouThe reply of Socrates in the name of the indifferēt reader. ſuch as aſſembled together at Antioch, fathers: and yet denyeſt their auncetors to be fathers? for the Biſhops of Nice and the eſtabliſhers of one ſubſtance, ought more properly to be called fathers, partly for that they were more auncient, and partly alſo becauſe that the Biſhops aſſembled together at Antioch were conſecrated and promoted by them vnto the reuerend office of prieſthoode. If that the Biſhops which aſſembled at Antioch were founde to be ſuch as cutt their fathers throtes, theſe men of their progenye, without good aduiſement doe treade the trace of murtherers. And howe (I beſeeche you) doe they allowe of their electing and laying on of handes, as ſufficient and lawefull, when as they cancell their faythe, and abrogate their canons for vnperfect and corrupt doctrine? If they had not the holy Ghoſt, which lighteth vpon euery one that entreth into holy orders: theſe men receaued not the function of prieſthoode. for how coulde they receaue of them which had it not to geue? theſe thinges in my opinion may very well be vrged agaynſt Eleuſius. Agayne there roſe an other controuerſie among them for when as the complices of Acacius had affirmed in the creede read before them, that the ſonne of God was like vnto the father, they demaunde wherein the ſonne was like vnto the father? Acacius maketh anſwere:By this anſwere of Acacius we may ſee the double dealing of the Arians, how vnder faire &amp; ſmoth wordes they cloked the poyſon of their hereticall doctrine. that the ſonne was like vnto the father not in ſubſtance, but onely in will and mynde. but they on the contrary ſide affirmed playnely that he was in ſubſtance like vnto the father. they

reaſoned all that daye of this queſtion. Acacius being ſufficiently confuted, when they demaunded of him the reaſon why in his bookes he had written and auoutched the ſonne in all thinges to be like the father: and nowe denied that the ſonne was of one ſubſtance with the father? made this anſwere: No man that euer was eyther of olde tyme, or of late dayes, is wont to be tryed by the bookes whiche he wrote. After they had diligently ſifted out this queſtion of bothe ſides, and coulde not agree thereupon, Leônas roſe vp and diſſolued the councell, this was the ende of the councell which was helde at Seleucia. The next daye after, when they made ſute for the proroging of the councell, he woulde not ſitt with them agayne, but tolde them flatly, that the Emperour had ſent him to be preſent at an vniforme and peaceable councell, but in ſo much that diuerſe of them be at diſcorde and debate amonge them ſelues, I can not away (ſayth he) with your company. Goe your wayes therefore, dally and brawle ye at home in your owne Churches. This being done, the conſpiracie of Acacius ſuppoſing nowe they had gott their deſired excuſe, abſented them ſelues and woulde not ſhewe their faces agayne before the councell. The other ſide mett againe at the Churche, and cited Acacius with his company to appeare before them for to decide Cyrillus matter who was Biſhop of Ieruſalem. Here we haue to learne thatCyrillus b of Ieruſalem was an Arian and depoſ

As ſoone as he was depoſed he ſent an appellation in writing vnto the depoſers, appealing from them vnto the Iudges of the higher court. Constantius the Emperour admitted his appellation. Cyrillus was he that firſt of all and alone gaue forth a preſident preiudiciall vnto the practiſe of the eccleſiaſticall canon, as if the matter had bene decided before laye Iudges. At length he came to Seleucia for to haue his cauſe heard, and therefore the Biſhops ſent for Acacius and his company, to the ende they might not onely heare Cyrillus cauſe, but alſo examine ſuch as were accuſed and had fledd vnto the faction of Acacius. but in the ende when they had oft cited them and they appeared not: they depoſed Acacius him ſelfe, alſo Georgius Biſhop of Alexandria,

                         Biſhop of Tripolis in Lydia, and Eudoxius who firſt had bene Biſhop of Germanicia, and afterwards crept by wiles into the biſhoprick of Antioch in Syria, laſt of all they depoſed Patrophilus for diſobedience and ſtubburne behauiour. Dorotheus the Prieſt had accuſed him, they cited him, but he appeared not. Theſe onely were depoſed. They proceeded further &amp; excommunicated Aſterius, Euſebius, Abgarus, Baſilicus, Philus, Philedius, Euthychius, magnus, and Euſtathius, and decreed they ſhoulde remaine in that ſtate vntill they had anſwered for them ſelues and cleared them of the crimes laid to their charg. When they had brought theſe things to this paſſe, and ſent letters vnto the Churches of ſuch as were depoſed, certifying them what they had decreed in their behalfe: they ordaine Amanus biſhop of Antioch in Eudoxius rowme, whome the faction of Acacius apprehended and deliuered to the hands of Leônas and Lauricius, they forthwith ſend him to exile. This being done the biſhops which ordained Anianus, made a long plee, and diſcourſed at large before Leônas and Lauricius againſt Acacius &amp; his confederacy, where they ſignified in playne words, what extreme wronge the cenſure &amp; ſentence of the councell ſuſtained. but when as they preuailed nothing, they tooke their voyage into Conſtantinople for to certifie the Emperour what they had decided in y• councell. Cap. 41. in the greeke. The Emperour was then come thither from the weſt, &amp; had taken away y• office of proconſulſhip, &amp; in ſteede thereof ordained at Conſtantinople a certaine gouernment the which he endowed with the title of honor: but Acacius had preuented them &amp; laid grieuous accuſations to their charge before the emperour, perſwading him y• their forme of faith was in no wiſe to be admitted. Wherfore the emperour being grieuouſly incenſed againſt them, determined to cutt them of: he made a lawe, y• as many as were Magiſtrats &amp; bare office in the common wealth ſhould be brought back agayne to embrace a populare &amp; priuate kinde of life. for of the biſhops ſome were called to gouerne the common wealth: ſome were SenatorsThe Biſhops then were Magiſtrats &amp; of

While this ſturre raigned, Acacius and his complices remained at Conſtantinople, &amp; calling vnto them y• biſhops of Bithynia they held there an other councell. They were all fifty in number, Maris alſo Biſhop of Calcedon came vnto them: they confirmed the forme of fayth that was read at Ariminum, at whoſe beginning and title, the Conſuls were written. I woulde thinke it a ſuperfluous thinge to repeate the ſame here, had they not added therunto of their owne: but in ſo much they haue written

This only begottē ſonne of God vve knovve to haue bene ſent frō the father, to haue come dovvne from heauē as it is vvritten: to haue bene conuerſant vvith his diſciples: &amp; after the accōplishing of his meſſage according vnto the vvill of his father to haue bene crucified, dead, &amp; buried: to haue deſcended into hell at vvhoſe preſence the infernall povver trembled: to haue riſen againe the third day from the dead, &amp; againe to haue accōpanied his diſciples: &amp; after forty dayes vvere expired to haue bene taken vp into heauē, vvhere he ſittteth at the right hande of the father &amp; shall come at the generall reſurrectiō vvith the glorie of the father, to reward euery one according vnto his vvorks. and vve beleue in the holy ghoſt, vvhom the only begottē ſonne of God himſelfe, our Lord &amp; God promiſed to ſend mankind a comforter, as it is vvrytten, the ſpirit of trueth, whome alſo he ſent after his aſſumptiō into heauē. The clauſe of ſubſtāce being of diuers ſimply layd downe, becauſe the ignorant people vnderſtood it not, gaue greate occaſion of offence. It ſemed good therefore, in as much as there was no mentiō thereof in holy ſcripture quite to take it away, &amp; henceforth not to reaſon thereof, becauſe the word of God hathe no where remembred the ſubſtāce of the father &amp; of the ſonne. For the ſubſtance or ſubſiſtēcie of the father, of the ſonne, &amp; of the holy ghoſt may not be once named or reaſoned of. we therefore as we are taught by holy ſcripture doe affirme, that the ſonne is like the father. All hereſies whatſoeuer, either heretofore condemned, or lately ſprong vp, if they be found contrary to this faith, let them be held for accurſed. Theſe things as you ſee were then decreed at Cōſtantinople.

Nowe hauing at length runne ouer the confuſe multitude of Creeds &amp; formes of faith, let vs once againe briefely repeate the number of them. After the Creede that was laid downe by the Nicene councell, the Biſhops framed two others at Antioch when they aſſembled to the dedication of the church: the third was made in Fraunce of the biſhops which were with Narciſſus, &amp; exhibited vnto the Emperoure Conſtantine: the fourth was ſent by Eudoxius vnto the Biſhops throughout Italie. Three were publiſhed in wryting at Sirmium, where of one being gloriouſly intitled with the names of Conſulls, was red at Ariminum. The eight was ſet forth at Seleucia &amp; procured to be red by the complices of Acacius. The ninth was geuen abroade with additions at Conſtantinople,
                        Vlphilas Biſhop of the Gotthes became an Arian in his later dayes. there was thereunto annexed that thenceforth there ſhould be no mention made of the ſubſtance of ſubſiſtencie of God. Whereunto Vlphilas Biſhop of y• 
                        Gotthes then firſt of all ſubſcribed. For vnto that time he embraced the faith eſtabliſhed by the councell of Nice, and was an earneſt follower of Theophilus ſteps, Biſhop of the Gotthes, who had bene at the Nicene councell &amp; ſubſcribed vnto the Creed. But of theſe things thus much.

                        ACacius &amp; Eudoxius together with their faction made foule tumults &amp; greate ſturre at Conſtantinople, fully purpoſing to remoue frō their biſhopricks ſome of the contrary ſide. And here alſo we may not paſſe ouer with ſilence, howe that both parts inuēted cauſes of depriuatiō not for piety &amp; religion ſake, but of priuat malice &amp; quarellous ſpite: for though they varied in the faith, yet in depoſing one an other they charged not ech other with their beleefe: but ſuch as were of Acacius ſide, tooke the Emperours diſpleaſure (who purpoſed among diuers other to reuenge him of Macedonius) as a fit occaſion, &amp; firſt they depoſe Macedonius frō his biſhoprick, partly for that he had bene the cauſe of great ſlaughter, &amp; partly alſo becauſe he admitted into the communion a certaine deacon that was taken in adultery. They remoued Eleuſius Biſhop of Cyzicū
                         for baptizing one Heraclius a ſacrificing prieſt of Hercules at Tyrus who was knowē to be a great coniurer &amp; preferring him to the order of deaconſhip: they depriued Baſilius otherwiſe called Baſilas, who was made Biſhop of Ancyra in Marcellus rowme, for that he cruelly tormented &amp; impriſoned a certaine man, for becauſe he forged ſclaundres &amp; diſcredited diuers perſons, and laſtly for moleſting the quiet eſtate of the churches in Aphricke by his epiſtles: they ſuſpended Dracontius
                        
for leauing Gallacia &amp; remouing to Pergamus: they diſplaced moreouer Neonas Biſhop of Seleucia where y• coūcel was held: Sophronius biſhop of Pompeiopolis in Paphlagonia: Elpidius
                         biſhop of Satalum in Macedonia: Cyrillus

                         &amp; many mo, for ſundry other cauſes.Cap. 43. in the Greeke. Euſtathius was not ſuffred to ſpeak for himſelfe, his faults were ſo haynous and ſo wel knowen. Neither had Euſtathius Biſhop of Sebaſtia in Armenia licence permitted him, for to purge himſelfe, becauſe that a little before he had bene depoſed by Eulauius his owne naturall father, who was Biſhop of Caeſarea in Cappadocia, for apparelling himſelfe in ſuch weede as was not decent for the dignity &amp; order of prieſthood. In this Euſtathius rowme, Meletuis (of whome I mind hereafter to ſpeake) was made Biſhop. Moreouer Euſtathius was afterwards condemned by the councell held at Gangra that was ſummoned for the hearing of his matters, becauſe that after his former depoſition in the councell of Caeſarea, he had attempted many things, cōtrary to the canons &amp; cuſtomes of the church. He forbad mariadge &amp; ſet forth precepts of abſtuēce. He parted aſunder diuers that were coupled together in wedlock, &amp; perſwaded ſuche as refrained the churches &amp; publick aſſembly, to raiſe conuenticles &amp; brotherhood in their priuat houſes. He tooke ſeruāts frō their maiſters vnder colour of religion. He himſelfe vſed the Philoſophers habite &amp; conſtrained his followers to vſe a ſtraunge kind of Atyre. He cauſed the women to be ſhauen. He forbad the accuſtomed &amp; preſcribed faſting dayes, &amp; commaunded abſtinence on the ſundays. He abhorted y• prayers that were made in maried mēs houſes. He deteſted the offring and the communion of the maried prieſt, who when he was a lay man had lawefully coupled himſelfe in the bonde of wedlocke. This Euſtathius when he had taught and ſet abroch theſe and many other ſuch lewd precepts, was (as I ſaid before depoſed by y• councell held at Gangra in Paphlagonia, and his doctrine accurſed. But theſe things were done a good while after. When that Macedonius about y• time was remoued, Eudoxius ſuppoſing the ſeae of Antioch, to be farre inferior vnto y• Biſhoprick of Conſtantinople, was proclaimed Biſhop of Conſtantinople by Acacius &amp; his adherents, who made lawes &amp; put them in practiſe contrary to their owne former decrees. For after y• depoſition of Dracontius they made Eudo xius Biſhop of Conſtantinople who nowe the ſeconde time had tranſlated himſelfe from one ſeae vnto an other, &amp; in ſo doing they were founde farre contrary to thēſelues. After this they ratifie y• forme of faith that was read at Ariminum together with y• additiōs and gloſſes as a very abſolute thing, &amp; ſend it abroade into the whole world, commaunding y• whoſoeuer refuſed to ſubſcribe vnto the ſame, ſhould, by vertue of the Emperours proclamation be condemned to perpetuall baniſhemēt. They ſignified this their purpoſe vnto many of the Caſt churches, which maintained yt ſame hereticall opinion with them &amp; to Patrophilus Biſhop of Scythopolis, who from the councell of Seleucia got him ſtraight to his owne citie. When Eudoxius was ſetled Biſhop of the noble citie of Conſtantinople, y• great church calied after the name of wiſedome was honored w the ſolempne feaſt of dedication, in the tenth Conſulſhip of Conſtantius, the third of lulianus Caeſar &amp; the fifteneth day of the moneth of February. Eudoxius

When he had thus interpreted his mind, the contentious multitude quieted themſelues and in ſteede of the hurlyburly the whole churche was ſette on laughter. His fonde ſaying vnto this day is counted a famous ieſt. The authors of error and ſchiſine occupiyng their braine about ſuch trifling quircks, about ſuch fond and friuolous words, haue broken aſunder the bonde of vnitie and concorde retained in the church of God. The councell held at Conſtantinople had ſuch an end as I haue ſhewed before.

                     NOwe it remaineth that according vnto our former promiſe, we ſay ſomewhat of Meletius. This man after the depoſition of Eustathius (as I ſayd before) was firſt choſen Biſhop of Sebaſtia in Armenia, afterwards was he taken thence and tranſlated to the biſhoprick of Beroea a citie of Syria. After he had bene at the councel of Seleucia, and ſubſcribed vnto the forme of faith which the faction of Acacius had framed and exhibited vnto the councell, immediatly be re turned to Beroea, the Antiochians after the ſummoning of y• councel at Conſtantinople, vnderſtā
                        ding for certaine y• 
                        Eudoxius had made light of their church, &amp; for greater lucre crept vnto the Byſhopricke

of Conſtantinople, ſent to Beroea for Meletius and made him Biſhop of Antioch. He in aMeletius was after Eudoxius Biſhop of Antioch, he was by the Emperoure depoſed for maintaining the Nicene creed againſt the Arians &amp; Euzoius placed in his rowme. good while after his comming, medled not with high matters and my ſteries of faith, but deliuered onely vnto his auditors ſuch things as concerned maners, good life and godly conuerſation: yet in countinewance of time he expounded thē the faith and the clauſe of one ſubſtance. The Emperour hearing of this, commaunded him to exile and gaue charge that Euzoius (who afore time had bene depoſed together with Arius) ſhoulde be ſtalled Biſhop of Antioch.

The reporte goeth that Macedonius was not the firſte founder of this blaſphemous opinion, but Marathonius who longe before his time had bene Biſhop of Nicomedia, and thereupon ſuch as maintayned yt opinion to haue bene called Marathonians. Unto theſe mens company it was that Euſtathius (who for the cauſe aboue ſpecified lefte Sebaſtia) linked himſelfe. When Macedonius denied that the holy Ghoſt was equall and partaker of the godhead whiche is in the bleſſed Trinitie: Eustathius made anſwere, I of mine owne parte (ſaith he) doe not minde to call the holy Ghoſt God, neyther yet dare I preſume to tearme him a creature.

Many of thē after theyr meeting, call into queſtion ſuch things as they had decreed in tymes paſt: they affirme that the Clauſe of likeneſſe by the Councell of Ariminum, and the Councell helde at Conſtantinople, is quite to be abandoned and not once to be named againe: they clocke their opinion no longer, but pronounce with open mouthe that the ſome was altogether vnequall and vnlike the father not onely in ſubſtance but alſo in will, and alſo that he had his beinge (as Arius dreamed) of nothinge. Suche as then alſo were at Antioch of the ſecte of Aetius, intangled them ſelues in the ſnares of this peſtilente opinion. Therefore beſides that the Arians
                        Anomoioi. were called Anomoioi whiche ſignifieth that they affirmed the Sonne to be vnlike the Father: they were of the Antiochians, who defended the faythe Of one ſubſtance and then were deuided for the foreſayde cauſe of Meletius called Exoucoutioi, ſignifying they had affirmed theExoucoutioi.

to ſay that he was vnlike the father and had his beinge of nothinge: they wēt about to bleare their eyes with a ridiculous kind of fallacie. Whereas we affirmed (ſaye they) the ſonne to be God of God, we meante it in that ſenſe as the Apoſtle wrote where he ſayde, that all thinges were of God. Therefore the ſonne is of God in as muche as he is included in the worde all. And for this cauſe we layde downe in our Creedes the Clauſe: accordinge vnto the Scriptures. The author of this lewde and fonde Gloſſe was Georgius Biſhoppe of Laodicea, who beinge ignorante and vnſkilfull in ſuche kinde of phraſes, perceaued not howe Origen in tymes paſte had playnely interpreted ſuche ſiguratiue kinde of ſpeaches contayned in the Epiſtles of Paul.

At Laodicea a ciue of Syria there were two men, the father and the ſonne of one name, for both was called Apollinarius, whereof the one I meane the father was a prieſt, the other, that is the ſonne was a reader. Both were profeſſors of humanity. The father caught grammer, the ſonne Rhetorike. The father beinge borne at Alexandria, firſt kept ſchoole at Berytus, afterwardes remouinge to Laodicea, he got him a wife, on whome he begate Apollinarius. They both floriſhed at Laodicea in the time of Epiphanius the ſophiſt, and hauing greate familiarity with him they were neuer ſeene out of his company. Theodotus Biſhop of that ſeae, fearinge greatly leſt their familiarity with him ſhoulde bringe them from the faith, and ſo fall to embrace paganiſme, forbadde them his company. They made no accompt of the Biſhops commaundement, but kept ſtill company with Epiphamus. In proceſſe of time Georgius the ſucceſſor of Theodotus hauinge oft aſſaied, and ſeinge he coulde by no meanes ſeparate them from Epiphanius, excommunitated them bothe, hopinge thereby with puniſhment to perſwade them to the contrary. But the yonger Apollinarius ſtomaking this dealinge, put conſidence in his painted figures of Rhetorike, and inuented a newe opinion, the whiche at this day after the name of the author is called the hereſie of Apollinarius.

Now therfore in as much as I haue determined wt my ſelfe to diſcourſe of this Emperour Iulian, a mā paſſing eloquent, let none of his friends looke at my hāds for curious &amp; lofty ſtile, as though it behoued my penne to coūteruaile y• excellēcie of y• perſon.

Wherefore entring to diſcourſe of him we purpoſe to proceede in this order, after our preamble hath vſed a litle digreſſiō, &amp; fet a ſmall cōpaſſe, for to lay downe his kinred, his nurture, &amp; the maner how he attained vnto y• emperiall crowne, Conſtantinus y• Emperour who chaūged y• name of Byzantiū, &amp; termed it Cōſtantinople, had two brethren of one father, but by diuers mothers, the one was Dalmatius y• other Coſtantius. Dalmatius had a ſonne of his owne name: Conſtatius alſo had two ſōnes, Gallus &amp; Iulianus. When as after the death of Cōſtantinopls foſider, y• yōger Dalmatius had ben ſtaine of y• ſouldiers: theſe orphanes likewiſe bereaued of their naturall father, eſcaped narowly the vnlucky ſucceſſe of Dalmatius, for they had bene cut of &amp; diſpatched, had not ſickneſſe &amp; diſeaſes (as it was thought incurable) ſaued Gallus life &amp; youthly age of eight yeare old preſerued Iulianus aliue, &amp; kept him from y• tyrāts clawes. But after yt the Emperour was appeaſed, &amp; his furie withdrawen frō raging againſt thē, Gallus was trained vp vnder ſchoolemaiſters at Epheſus in Ionia, where their auncetors had left either of thē great legacies.

Whē he had profited very much in good diſcipline &amp; godly literature, y• fame wēt of him amōg yt people, yt he was a man both able &amp; fit to gouerne &amp; beare office in the cōmon wealth. The which thing afterwards being then rife in euery mans mouth, diſquieted y• Emperour not a litle. Wherfore he cauſed him to be remoued from y• princely citie of Cōſtātinople into Nicomedia, &amp;Iabanius the Sophiſt. charged him not to treade in y• ſchoole of Iabanius y•

profeſſed paganiſme and heatheniſhe literature: yet for all that, was he ſo in loue with his works, that he procured them vnto him ſecretly and by ſtelth, and peruſed them with greate labor and diligence. When he had taken good ſucceſſe and great profit in Rhetorike, it fell out that Maximus

                              •

                         whome the Emperour Valentinianus afterwardes founde to be a coniurer, and recompenced him with preſent death▪ but that (as I ſayde before) fell afterwards. At that time there was no cauſe that draue him thither, but the fame of Iulian. Of this man it was that Iulian learned the precepts of philoſophie: but as for religion he had ſuch a maiſter as inflamed his minde to aspire vnto the imperiall ſcepter. When theſe thinges came to the Emperours eares, Iulian nowe muzinge betwene hope and fearefull hatred, howe he myght be voyde of ſuſpition, who of late had bene a true Chriſtian, but nowe an hypocriticall diſſembler, ſhaued him ſelfe, andIulian a coū
                           terfeyte ſhauching. counterfayted a monkiſhe life. For all that, priuely he applyed heatheniſhe and philoſophicall diſcipline, but openly he read holy ſcripture, ſo that he was made reader in the church of Nicomedia. Thus craftely vnder cloke of religion did he appeaſe the furious rage of the Emperour incenſed agaynſt him. Theſe things did he of feare, yet not diſpayring of hope, for he ſticked not to tell diuers of his familiar friends, that it woulde be a happie worlde if he were made Emperour. When it went thus with him, Gallus his brother was created Caeſar, who taking his iourney into the Eaſt came by Nicomedia for to ſee him. After that Gallus in a while after was ſlayne, immediatly from that time forth Iuliamus was had in greate ſuſpicion of the Emperour, and therevpon commaunded that he ſhoulde be ſtraightly looked vnto, he eſpying fitt opportunitie to eſcape his keepers, conueyed him ſelfe away and ſaued his life. At length Euſebia y• Empreſſe, finding him by chaunce lurking in ſome ſecret and obſcure place, intreated the Emperour in his behalfe, that he would not onely doe him no harme: but alſo graunt him his lawfull fauour for to repaire to Athens for further knowledge in philoſophie. To be ſhort he ſent for him: made him Caeſar: gaue himIulianus was made Caeſar, and ſent into Fraunce. his ſiſter Helen to wife: and ſent him into Fraunce for to wage battaile with y• barbarian nations which rebelled agaynſte their Chriſtian Emperour. For the Barbarians whome the Emperour Conſtantius had hyred a litle before to geue battaile vnto Magnentius the tyrāt, when as they preuayled nothing againſt him, they fell a ranſacking and ſpoyling of the cities within the Romaine dominions: and becauſe Iulian had but a greene head and of no great yeares, the Emperour gaue him charge to enterpriſe nothing without the aduiſe and counſell of his ſage &amp; expert captaines. When y• they hauing this large commiſſion waxed negligent, ſo y• the Barbarians had the vpper hand: Iulianus permitted the captaines to banquet, to take their paſtime &amp; pleaſure, &amp; layd downe a ſett and certaine reward for euery Barbarian that was ſlayne, whereby he did the more incourage the ſouldiers. By this meanes it fell out that the power of the Barbarians came to nought, and that he him ſelfe was greatly beloued of his ſouldiers. The fame goeth that as he entred into a certaine towne, a greene garland hanging by a corde betwene pillours (wherewith commonlyA garlande foreſhewing the crowne of the empire they are wont to trimme their houſes, and ſett forth the beautie of their cities) fell vpon his head, and ſitted him very well, inſomuch that all the people then preſent, gaue a great ſhout thereat▪ for it was thought that the falling garland prognoſticated vnto him the glory of the imperiall ſeepter following after. Some ſay that Conſtantius ſent him againſt the Barbarians, hoping that in ſkirmiſhing with them he ſhoulde there be diſpatched▪ but whether they report truely or no I knowe not. For after that he had maryed him to his ſiſter, if then he ſhoulde pretende him friendſhip and practiſe miſchiefe towards him, what other thing were that then to procure vengeance to lyght vpon his owne pate. but whether it be thus or otherwiſe, lett euery man iudge as he thinkes beſt. When Iulian had ſignified vnto the Emperour the careleſſe and ſ

                        outhfull diſpoſition and negligence of the captaines, he ſent him an other, that was valiant, ſeruiceable, and a man for Iulianus owne vayne. Iulian after his comming fought manfully with the Barbarians: who ſent an embaſſadour vnto him ſhewinge the letters patents and commiſſion of the Emperour that commaunded them to go into the borders of the Romaine countries. But Iulian layd their embaſſadour in hold, waged battaile with the multitude, ouercame the enemy, and ſent the king of the Barbarians captiueIulianus of the ſouldiers proclaymed Emperour, &amp; crowned with a chaine of golde. vnto the Emperour Conſtantius. After this lucky and proſperous ſucceſſe, the ſouldiers proclayme him Emperour. The emperiall crowne was not then preſent, but one of his trayne tooke a chayne of golde from about his necke, and compaſſed his head therwith in ſteede of the crowne. In this ſort it was that Iulianus beganne his raigne. What he did in time following, whether it became a philoſopher or no, let other men iudge that ſhall heare thereof. For he determined with

him ſelfe thenceforth to ſend no embaſſadour vnto Conſtātius, neyther to doe homage, or to honor him as his ſuperiour, patrone, or wellwiller: but to deale in all matters accordinge vnto his owne will and pleaſure. He altered the preſidents throughout euery prouince, he diſcredited Constantius in euery citie by reading openly and ſko

For as he paſſed throughout euery citie he ſet wide open their temples and idoll groues, he ſacrificed to pictures, and entitled him ſelfe an high prieſt: ſo that the pagans celebrated afreſhe their heatheniſhe &amp; abhominable feaſts. When theſe things were thus brought to paſſe, he tooke occaſion to raiſe ciuill warrs againſt Coſtātius, &amp; procured (as much as lay in him) all miſerie, calamitie, &amp; miſchiefe which accuſtome to follow warre, to be committed. Neither truly could this philoſophers mind haue bene throughly knowē without great ſlaughter &amp; bloodſhedīg, vnleſſe God (who is the only iudge of his owne ſecret coūcell) had without y• calamitie of others cut of frō his purpoſe y• other aduerſary. For as Iulianus cōtinewed amōg y•

                         great many. For the aforeſayd cauſes he baniſhed theſe kind of men out of his pallace. He turned out diuers of the notaries to their former trades, and vnto ſome he cōmaunded that the ſtipend dew vnto ſcriueuers ſhoulde duely be payed. Moreouer he cōmaunded that the ordinary cariadge prouided for neceſſaries, ſhoulde no more be by Mules, Oxen, and Aſſes: but permitted that in ſuch publique affaires the onely vſe of horſes ſhoulde be retayned. There be but fewe which commende theſe his doinges, and ſure I am, there be many that diſcommende them: becauſe that in remouing the admiration and glorie of the emperiall treaſure and ſumptuous magnificence, whereat many dyd wonder, he brought the Empire into an abiect porte, and contemptuous kinde of ſtate. In the nyght he made orations, and pronounced them the day followinge in the Senate: ſo that he alone of all the Emperours from the raygne of Iulius Caeſar, vnto his tyme was hearde to ſound orations in the Senate. Although he fauoured greately and bare ſingular good wyll vnto all learned men and paynefull ſtudents, yet aboue all others he eſteemed ſuch as profeſſed philoſophie, ſo that the fame thereof beynge bruted abroade, all ſuch kinde of men bragginge not a little of theyr profeſſion frequented vnto the Emperours pallace, of which number manie attyred in mantells, were more reuerenced for theyr peltinge habite then theyr profeſſed doctrine. All theſe ſorte of men became heauie friendes vnto the Chriſtians, as lewde varletts they alwayes applyed them ſelues to the Emperours relygion. The Emperoure him ſelfe beynge puffed vp beyonde all

meaſure with the ſwellinge pryde of vayne glorie, wrote a booke the which he intituled Caeſares, wherein he bitterly inueyed againſt all the Emperours his predeceſſors. Beyng alſo of the ſame minde, and hauing his ſtomacke diſtempered with the cancred poyſon of malice, he made declamations and inuectiues againſt the Chriſtians. In that he baniſhed Cookes and Barbours out of his courte, we haue to gather that therein he played the parte rather of a philoſopher then of an Emperour: and in that he opprobriouſly taunted and reuyled his auncetors, he ſhewed him ſelfe playnely to be neyther philoſopher, neyther Emperour. For both thoſe ſortes of men are voyde of malicious backbytinge, and deſpitefull enuie. For euen as it behoueth the Emperour to ſeeke after thoſe precepts of philoſophie which tende to the moderation and modeſtie of minde: ſo the Philoſopher if he imitate the Emperour in all thinges, he ſhall paſſe the boundes of his callinge, and forgett his profeſſion. Thus much briefly of the Emperour Iulians linage, his bringinge vp and diſpoſition, alſo howe he came to be Emperour: nowe let vs returne to diſcourſe of the eccleſiaſticall affayres within that tyme.

                        Of the commotion riſen at Alexandria, and the death of Georgius.
                     
                     IT fell out vpon this occaſion at the beginninge, that there roſe a greate vprore at Alexandria. There was a certaine place within the citie, which of old time lay all waſt and open, full of all filth and vncleaneſſe, where the Ethniks (with rites and ceremonies done to the honor of Mithra) accuſtomed to offer vp men for ſacrifice. This platt of ground ſeruing to no vſe or purpoſe,The Perſians worſhipped the ſonne, which they called Mithra. 
                        Conſtantius gaue to the church of Alexandria. Georgius
                         purpoſing with him ſelfe to founde there a church, cauſeth the ground to be ridd, and the filthe to be caryed away. Hauing purged the place, there was found a chauncell of great heyghth where the Ethniks had layd vp the reliques of their myſteries. There was alſo found therein an infinite number of dead mens ſkulles, both of yonge and olde, the which as we are geuen to vnderſtande, were ſlayne when the Pagans vſed bowells and intraylls for diuination and deueliſh ſouthſaying, thereby to daſell and bleare the eyes of ſimple and ignorant ſoules. When theſe were found in the veſteryes and ſecret cloſets of Mithra, the Chriſtians went about to diſcloſe vnto the world their practiſes, to the end their fond ceremonies myght be derided of all men. They cary about the bauld ſkulls of the dead for the people to gaze vpon. The Pagans inhabiting Alexandria perceyuing their drift▪ ſtomaked the Chriſtians, boyled within them ſelues for anger, tooke that which firſt came to their handes, ſett vpon them, and ſlewe of them euery kind of way: ſo that ſome were runne through with ſwords, ſome other brayned with clubbs, other ſome ſtoned to death, ſome ſtrangled with halters about their necks, ſome other were nayled to the tree, caſting in their teeth the death of the croſſe. In the end, as cōmonly it falleth out in ſuch hurlyburlyes, they held not their hands, no not from their deareſt friends: one friende fell vpon an other, the one brother ſought the other brothers lyfe, the parents put theyr children to death, and to be ſhort the one cutt the others throte: ſo that the Chriſtians were fayneThe death of Georgius biſhop of Alexandria. to ceaſſe from rydding the filth and foule cloſetts of Mithra: and Georgius was of the gentils pulled out of the church by the eares, tyed to a camell, torne in peeces, and burned to aſhes, together with the beaſt.

                        Howe that the Emperour taking grieuouſly the death of Georgius, rebuked ſharply in his letters the people of Alexandria.
                     
                     THe Emperour beyng wonderfully moued with the death of Georgius, wrote bytter letters vnto the people of Alexandria. The reporte goeth, that ſuch as conceaued diſpleaſure agaynſt him in the quarell of Athanaſius, committed theſe thinges agaynſte Georgius, for to diſpatche him out of the way. But in my opinion they that be at variance amonge them ſelues, moſt commonly holde together when neceſſitie conſtrayneth them, in tumultes and ſeditions to withſtand the violence of deſperate and damned perſons. Wherfore the Emperours epiſtle chargeth not the Chriſtians ſeuerally, but all the inhabitants of Alexandria. Georgius
                         (as it is very lyke) had diuerſly moleſted and greeued them all, and therefore the people was furiouſly ſett on fiery ſeditiō. that the Emperour wrote generally vnto y• whole multitude heare out of his epiſtleThe epiſtle of Iulian the Apoſtata vnto the inhabitants of Alexandria. as followeth. The Emperour Caeſar Iulianus, Maximus, Auguſtus, vnto the people of Alexandria
                        
                        ſendeth greetinge. Although it falleth out amongeſt you that there is no reuerence geuen vnto Alexander the founder of your citie, or (that vvhich is greater) if ye ſtand in no avve of the great and moſte holie God Serapis: yet doe I greately maruell that you vvere ſo voyde of common reaſon, naturall affection, and honeſt ciuilitie and that (vvhich with modeſtie I may add therevnto) you had ſo little conſideration of our perſon, vvhome not onely the greate God Serapis but alſo all the other godds haue thought vvorthie to be Emperour of the vvhole vvorlde, vnto vvhome it shoulde haue bene your parte to haue had recourſe, and to haue geuen vs the hearinge of all ſuch iniuries vvhatſoeuer you had ſuſtayned at the handes of levvde and diſobedient perſons. But peraduenture the boylinge heate of anger, and the furious motion of the mynde, ouershadovved your vvytts, and blynded your eyes, the vvhich moſt commonly beynge remoued from the ſeate of reaſon, is vvont to committe ſuch cruell and haynous actes. And though the fonde humour of ſedition feedinge on malice, vvas hyndered a little: yet for all that it brake out to the contempt and ouerthrovve of the lavves. You therefore ſeynge ye are numbred amonge the people and inhabitants of Alexandria, vvhome neyther reaſon coulde perſvvade, neyther shame vvithdravve from attemptinge the thynges, for the vvhich you myght haue iuſtly deteſted them: I charge you in the name of Serapis tell mee, vvhat vvicked fiende hath thus furiouſly prouoked you to ſeeke the death of Georgius? you vvyll ſaye peraduenture he incenſed agaynſte you the moſt bleſſed Emperour Constantius: that he procured a bande of armed ſouldiers to be brought into your ſacred citie: that the Liuetenant of Aegypt ranſacked and kept from you the moſt holie temple of God, caryed avvay thence the images, the monuments, &amp; glorious ornature prouided for the ſolemnitie of ſeruice: and alſo that vvhen you not digeſtinge thoſe haynous acts, endeuoured (and that not vvithout iuſt cauſe) to maynetayne the quarell of your god, yea rather to retayne the glorious ornaments of your greate god, the ſame Liuetenant contrarie to all reaſon both vniuſtly and vvyckedly ſett vpon you vvith armed ſouldiers, vvho fearing more the diſpleaſure of Georgius the byshop, then of Constantius the Emperour, thought beſt in ſuch ſorte to ſaue him ſelfe. For novve of a longe vvhyle he had behaued him ſelfe more orderly and ciuilly then tyrannically diſpoſed tovvardes you. For the vvhich cauſes you vvere incenſed agaynſte Georgius the open aduerſarie of the godds, and haue thus defyled vvith conſpiracie and ſlaughter your holie citie, vvhen as you myght haue ſued him in the lavve, and brought him to his tryall, and the ſentence of the Iudges. In ſo doinge this haynous offence had not broken out into bloodshedinge and horrible murther: but vvoulde haue pacified the matter in aequall ballaunce and preſerued you vvithout harme or domage: it vvoulde haue sharpely punished the authour of ſuch levvde practiſes, and kept vnder all them vvhich not onely deſpiſe the gods, but alſo ſette at nought ſuch noble cities and famous aſſemblies, ſuppoſinge the crueltie they exerciſe vpon them to be a furtherance vnto their povver and authoritie. Conferre this my epiſtle vvith that vvhich of late I ſent vnto you, and weye diligently the difference betvvene them. In the former I haue highly commended you, but novve in the later I take the immortall godds to vvitneſſe, vvhen that I endeuour (as duetie requireth) to prayſe you, the horrible offence vvhich you committed, ſtoppeth my mouth, and ſtayeth my penne. VVhat? dareth the ſubiect as a madde dogge pull man in peeces vvith his teeth? ought not he be ashamed of ſo haynous an offence? Is this to purifie and clenſe the handes, and to holde them vp ſtreatched vvide vnto the gods, as if they vvere not polluted vvith the blemishe and infamie of murther? But Georgius had no other then vvas devve vnto his deſert, and peraduenture I my ſelfe might iuſtly haue affirmed that by all ryght he shoulde haue ſuffered farre vvorſe. But you vvill ſay, that he deſerued it for his dealinge tovvards you: and therein I am of your opinion. But if you ſay that it behoued you to punishe him, that vvill I in no vvyſe graunte. You haue lavves, the vvhich ought greatly to be honored and embraced of all men both publiquely and priuately. But notvvithſtandinge though it commonly fall out, that manie be founde faultie and ſeuerall treſpaſſors, yet ought vve to fauour the publique ſtate of the common vveale, to obey the lavves, and in no vvyſe to violate the auncient and godlie decrees.

But I for the aforeſayd cauſes doe applie vnto theſe your ſores moſt gentle and tollerable ſalues, to wete exhortation and curteous language: vvhervnto I am certainely perſvvaded you vvill yeelde, if you be the men I take you for, deſcendinge of the auncient ſtocke of the Graecians, &amp; retaining in your breaſts that noble &amp; valiant courage, hauing alſo all the properties of curteous and ciuill life (I ſpeake vnto you my louinge citizens of Alexandria) impreſſed in the ſecret cloſets of your mindes. This was the epiſtle of the Emperour.

                        Cap. 5. in the Greeke. In the meane whyle Lucifer and Euſebius by the Emperours edict were called home from baniſhment. Lucifer was byſhop of Caralitanum a citie in Sardinia: Euſebius
                         (as I ſayde before) was byſhop of Vercellae a citie of the Ligurian Italians. Both they returninge from the hygher countries of Thebae, conſulted together by what meanes they myght recouer their byſhoprickes without preiudice to the canon and decree of the churche. Cap. 6. in the greeke. Wherefore after aduiſement taken it ſeemed good that the one of them (I meane Lucifer) ſhoulde goe to Antioche in Syria: the other, that is Euſebius, ſhoulde take his voyage to Alexandria, where by the meanes of Athanaſius a Councell myght be called together, and the canons of the church therein confirmed. Lucifer ſent thither a Deacon, ſignifyinge by him that he woulde ſubſcribe vnto the decrees of the Councell. He him ſelfe went to Antioche, where he founde the ſtate of the churche very troubleſome. For the multitude was deuided, and the congregations at variance, not onely by reaſon of Euzoius hereticall opinion, but alſo (as I ſayde before) becauſe that the ſect of Meletius, for the ſingular fauour they bare vnto him, ſeuered them ſelues from the faithfull. Lucifer therefore when he had ordayned Paulinus to be byſhop of that ſeae, departed thence.

But ſuch things as of old were inioyned by eccleſiaſticall decree, and layd downe vpon good conſideration by ſuch as were wiſe, learned, and zelous Chriſtians. For thus did the elders of old tyme reaſon of this matter, and deliuer in writinge vnto the poſteritie.

Moreouer the biſhops which mett in the councell of Alexandria, haue diſcuſſed the controuerſie of the clauſe of eſſence and ſubſtance.

But at that tyme there was not a worde of this matter in the Councell of Nice: for afterwards when diuers contended and reaſoned among them ſelues hereof, this councell tooke order toutching the clauſes of eſſence and ſubſtance, and decreed: that in handling the diuinitie of God there ſhould thenceforth no mentiō be made of theſe words: affirming y• the word eſſence was not founde in holie ſcripture, and that the Apoſtle in deliueringe the grounde of doctrine, was conſtrayued of neceſſitie to vſe the word ſubſtance. But they decreed farther that in an other ſenſe, to the end the opinion of Sabellius might be rooted out, theſe words were to be admitted: leſt that through the want of proper wordes we ſhould be compelled to imagine the thinge of three names to be as one, but that the ſeuerall names of the bleſſed Trinitie ſignifie and ſett forth God, to ſubſiſt by him ſelfe in proper ſubſtance. Theſe were the things decided in that Councell. I ſee nothinge to the contrarie, but that preſently alſo we may laye downe what we learned and read of the wordes eſſence and ſubſtance.

                        Ioh. 7. his houre vvas not as yet come. Yea before this came about, he ſayde vnto his mother: MineIoh. 2. 7. houre is not as yet come. He ſpake alſo vnto them that vvere called his brethren: my tyme is not yet come. Agayne vvhen the houre vvas come, he ſayd vnto his diſciples: ſleepe on novvMatth. 26. 
                        and take your reſt, beholde the houre is at hande, the ſonne of man shalbe betrayed into the handes of ſinners. Therefore neyther ſuffred he him ſelfe to be taken before his tyme vvas come: neyther hid he him ſelfe, vvhen the houre vvas at hande, but yelded him ſelfe vnto the enemie. In like ſorte the bleſſed Martyrs in the great heate, and troublſome ſtormes of perſecution vvhiche often came to paſſe, being purſued by men fledde avvay, and hid them ſelues in ſecret and ſolitary places, but being taken they valiantly encountred vvith the aduerſaries &amp; ended the combatt vvith martyrdome.

                        Euſebius after the councell held at Alexandria was broken vp, returned to Antioch, where he founde the people at variance by reaſon that Paulinus was there choſen Biſhop: and when that he coulde not preuaile among them with exhort ations to peace and vnitie, he gott him home to his owne biſhoprick of Vercellae.

Paulinus
                         had but one litle pariſh within the citie, of the which Euzoius did not depriue him, becauſe of the reuerence he owed vnto him. Meletius had his conuenticles in the ſuburbes without the walls of the citie. For that time, when the affayres went in this ſorte, Euſebius tooke his leaue of Antioch. Lucifer
                         vnderſtanding that Euſebius miſliked with that election of his,Impaciency bringeth hereſie. tooke it very contumeliouſly and was altogether impacient. He refuſed therefore to communicate with Euſebius, and being kindled with the fiery flame of contention, he reiected the canons of the councell. theſe thinges falling out in thoſe heauy tymes and tempeſtuous ſeaſons for eccleſiaſtical affayres miniſtred occaſion that many fell from the fayth: ſo that a newe ſect called the Luciferian hereſie then firſt ſprange vp. but Lucifer coulde not haue his fill, neyther ſatisfie him ſelfe with anger,The hereticall ſect of the Luciferians. becauſe that he bounde him ſelfe with his owne promiſes, ſent vnto the councell by his Deacon (who ſubſcribed thereunto in his name) to geue his aſſent. Wherefore hauing agreed (though againſt his will) vnto the canons of the church, he gott him vnto his owne biſhoprick in Sardinia. But they which fretted within them ſelues no leſſe then he, as yet doe remaine out of the Churche. Euſebius paſſing throughout the contries of the Eaſt cured and confirmed like a cunning Phiſicion ſuch as were weakelings in the faith: reſtored them to their former health, and inſtructed them in the doctrine of the Church. Thence he went into Illyrium &amp; comming into Italie in like ſort he diligently preached the worde of God.

Hilarius being endued with the gift of eloquence wroteHilariꝰ wrote 12. bookes of the trinity the which are to be ſeene in latine among his workes. in the latine tonge: expounded the canon contayning the clauſe of one ſubſtance: proued it ſufficiently and confuted the arguments of the Arians. but theſe thinges were done a litle after their returne from exile. Nowe we may not runne ouer with ſilence, howe that in the very ſame tyme the followers of Macedonius, Eleuſuis, Euſtathius and Sophronius, (all theſe were called Macedonians) had their priuate and often conuenticles: called vnto them ſuch as were of their opinion in Seleucia, and accurſed the contrary faction to wete, of the Acacians: reiected the fayth that was ſet forth at Ariminum, and confirmed the creede that was read in the councell of Seleucia. It was the ſame which a litle before (according vnto that we wrote in our ſeconde booke) was eſtabliſhed at Antioch. Theſe men being reaſoned with in this ſorte: you that are called Macedonians if ſo be that ye differ in opinion from the Acacians, howe is it that you coulde finde in your hartes to communicate with them euer vnto this day as if they had bene of one opinion with you? Sophronius Biſhop of Pompeiopolis in Paphlagonia, in the name of the reſt made thereunto this anſwere:The opinion of the We churches. The opinion of Aëtius. the Biſhops of the Weſt Churches haue in maner doted ouer the fayth of one ſubſtance:

They vnaduiſedly and without diſcreete iudgement ioyned in one the diſtinct and ſeuered ſubſtances of the father and of the ſonne, linked it (not well) together vnder the name of coeſſentiall or one ſubſtance: but this Aetius parted and deuided the proprietie of nature which the ſonne hath together with the father terming it the vnlikeneſſe or diuerſitie of ſubſtance. And in ſo much that both theſe fellThe opinion of the Macedonians. into contraries, and meare extreamities, we thought good to walke in the midd way and holde the meane betwene both, to retayne the true and godly opinion, that the ſonne is of like ſubſtance with the father. This was the anſwere of the Macedonians (as Sabinus writeth in his booke intitled the collections of the councells) exhibited by Sophronius vnto their demaunde. In that they charge Aetius as autor of the diuerſitie of ſubſtance in the father and the ſonne, and not the Acacians, they craftely diſſemble and cloke the trueth: in ſo doing they partly oppugne the Arians, andThe Macedonians proued them ſelues Neuterans. partly the opinion of ſuch as maintaine the clauſe of one ſubſtance. but they ouerthrowe them ſelues with their owne wordes, for in diſplaying and opening both opinions, they laye downe a newe of their owne. So farre of theſe thinges.

Maris a litle after anſwered the Emperour ſomewhat freely, I thanke God (ſayth he) which made me blinde leſt that euer I ſhould ſet mine eye vpon ſo vngracious a face as thine is. Wherunto the Emperour made no anſwere but handled the Biſhop roughly. When he perceaued that the Chriſtians did highly reuerence and honor ſuch as ſuffered martyrdome vnder the raigne of Diocletian: when he learned alſo for certayntie, diuerſe men to be ſo well diſpoſed, that willingly they woulde ſuffer martyrdome: he going about to depriue the Chriſtians of ſo great a benefitt, deuiſed an other way to afflict them. And although he let paſſe the vnſatiable tyranny practiſed in the tyme of Diocletian, yet ceaſed he not altogether from perſecuting. In mine opinion he is a perſecutorWho is a perſecutor. which moleſteth any kinde of way ſuch men as leade a quiet and peaceable liſe. Iulian in this ſorte afflicted the Chriſtans not a litle. he made a lawe that the Chriſtians ſhoulde not be trayned vp in prophane literature. for (ſayth he) ſeeing they haue the gift of vtterance ſo readily, they ſhall eaſily be able to ouerthrowe the quicks of Logick, wherewith the Gentils doe vpholde their doctrine.

Of which number was Ionianus, Valentinianus &amp; Valens, who afterwards were crowned Emperours. Other ſome that were counterfeit Chriſtians, who thought that the ritches and honor of this worlde was true felicity it ſelfe, without any delay fell to ſacrifice.

He laye alonge at the porche of the Church and cried vnto ſuch as came in: treade me vnder foote for that I am the vnſauery ſalt. Ecebolius as he was light and vnconſtant, ſo he continewed vnto the ende. It came to paſſe about that tyme that the Emperour purpoſed to reuenge him of the Perſians for the iniurie they had done him by inuading ſome part of the Romaine dominions, and determined to take his iourney into the Eaſt through the coaſtes of Aſia. When that he pondered with him ſelfe howe many euills and inconueniences appertayned vnto warres, what greate ſummes of money were needefull thereunto, and howe that without it, it was vnpoſſible to bring his purpoſe to effect, he deuiſed a certaine ſleyght to wring money from the Chriſtians. for he ſett a great fine vpon the heades of ſuch as woulde not ſacrifice, and the taxe was very grieuous and duely demaunded of the Chriſtians ſo that euery one rateably was ſeaſed at a certaine ſumme and the Emperour him ſelf in a ſhort while was wonderfully enritched with the iniurious heapes of money vniuſtly exacted.

                     THere was at Meris a citie of Phrygla a certaine gouernour whoſe name was Amachius,
                        Amachius an Heathen magiſtrate. who commaūded that the Idolatricall temple of the Ethnicks which ſtood in yt citie ſhould be ſet wide open, that the foule heapes and filthy corners of a long time vnfrequēted ſhould be made cleane, and fell himſelfe a worſhipping of the Idols. Which act of his pricked not a litle in conſcience the zealous chriſtians. Wherefore one Macedonius, Theodulus and Tatianus beinge kindled with fetuencie of loue towardes the chriſtian fayth, coulde in no wiſe away with ſuch horrible practiſes: but in the burninge zeale of their godly inindes, brake in the nighte ſeaſon into the temple, threwe downe theyr Idols, and ſtamped them into pouder. Whereat when the gouernoure was wonderfull wroth and purpoſed to execute diuerſe of the citizens whiche were gilteleſſe and innocente perſons, the authors thereof preſented themſelues of their owne accorde before him and choſe to dye themſelues for the trueth, rather then any other for their ſakes ſhould be depriued of their liues. After they were layde in holde the gouernoure commaunded that they ſhould cleare thēſelues by ſacrificinge vnto the Idols and threatned them if they refuſed he would ſeuerely puniſhe them. They beinge of a noble minde &amp; valiant courage, ſet nought by his threats, made themſelues redy to ſuffer what tormente ſoeuer were layde vpon them, for they counted it farre better to looſe their liues then to defile their ſoules with thoſe impure ſacrifices.

And to the end they might valiantly encoūter vnder the glorious garlande of victory, they reaſon thus with the gouernour: If thou longe (O Amachius) after broyled meate, turne vp the other ſide of vs, leaſt in the eatinge we ſeeme rawe vnto thee and the bloode runne aboute thy teeth. This was the ende that theſe men had.

The ſonne an eloquente Rhetorician, broughte the wrytinges of the Euangeliſtes and workes of the Apoſtles into Dialogues, as Plato vſed amonge the Heathens. Althoughe their laboure and induſtrie ſeemed auaylable and greatelye to ſette forthe the ſeruice of God, in

ſo muche that thereby the lewde drift of the Emperoure was ſtopped from takinge effect: yet the prouidence of God did farre exceede both their carefull ſtudie and daſhed alſo the Emperours wiked deuiſe. For immediatly the Emperours lawe (as hereafter it ſhall more manifeſtly appeare) was abrogated and theyr workes were as muche ſpoken of, as if they had neuer bene wrytten. But here peraduenture ſome man will ſaye vnto me: why then doe ye attribute bothe the aforeſayde vnto the prouidence of God? As toutchinge the ſhorteninge of the Emperoures dayes it is knowen well inoughe howe auaylable it was vnto chriſtian religion: but in that the Po

                        trye of bothe the Apollinariuſes was neglected, and that the chriſtians freely applied the Philoſophicall ſciences of the heathens, there is no man will graunte that it furthered the ſeruice of God, and the faith of Chriſt. For it can not be without daunger that the chriſtians maye wade in the doctrine of Ethnickes, in ſo muche it teacheth that there be many Gods. Vnto theſe things which aptely may be obiected vnto vs we will preſentely frame ſuche anſwers as we can. The doctrine of the Gentiles is allowed neither by Chriſt neither by his Diſciples as inſpired from aboue: neither altogether reiected for daungerous. And I take y• to haue come to paſſe not without the ſpeciall prouidence of almightie God. For there were many heathen Philoſophers which were not farre from the knowledg of God: ſuch as by publique diſputation confuted the Epicures and other contentious Philoſophers delited with the quirckes of logicke and ouerthrewe their palpable error and ignorance. And thoughe they coulde ſtande the fauorers of chriſtian religion in greate ſteade for their furtherance of learninge, yet attained they not vnto the grounde &amp; principall point of our religion inſomuch they vnderſtoode not the myſtery of Chriſt which was concealed the cō

                        and iniquitie of men which withholde the trueth in vnrighteouſneſſe. For the thinge that may be knowen of God is manifeſt amonge thē, becauſe God hath shevved it vnto them. For his inuiſible thinges beinge vnderſtoode by his workes, are ſeene through the creation of the world, that is, both his eternall power &amp; godheade, ſo that they are without excuſe, becauſe that when they knewe God, notwithſtanding they glorified him not as God. VVherefore they knowinge the trueth which God reuealed vnto them were worthie of death, becauſe that whē they knewe God they glorified him not as God. Therefore ſithence that the Apoſtle forbadd not the knoweledge of the Gentils doctrine, he gaue free licence and libertie vnto euery man at his choice and pleaſure to wade in the vnderſtandinge of them. Let this ſuffire for one reaſon to the ſatisfiynge of the former doubts. The ſeconde is as followeth. The holy Scriptures inſpired from aboue deliuer vnto vs diuine precepts and myſticall doctrine: they graffe in the mind

But the chriſtians enioyed not this benefit by the workes of bothe the Apollinariuſes. This was it that the Emperoure Iulian ſhotte at when as he made a lawe that the chriſtians ſhoulde not be ſchooled in the doctrine of the Gentils. He knewe full well that the fables contained in the works of the Hethen wryters being paiſed in the equall balance of indifferent iudgement would quickly be founde light and ſubiect to reprehenſion and diſcredit: the which fond inuention of theirs when Socrates their principall philoſopher had diſſalowed, the Iudges condemned him, as if he had gone about to diſproue or deſtroy their Gods, nay rather theyr deuells.

The Antiochians an impatiente kinde of people, ſoone prouoked to anger and reuengemente coulde not away with this plague (which they tooke for no other) without any more adoe they goe to meete the Emperoure, they crie out agaynſt him, they inueye at hisThe bearde and coyne of Iulian. doinges, and playe with his bearde (it was a longe thrumme bearde) they bidde him goe ſhaue his bearde and make halters thereof: they bringe him in remembrance of his coyne, wherein there was a bull conqueringe the worlde with his hornes. For the Emperoure beinge wholly geuen to ſuperſtition, ſacrificed bulls vpon the Idols altare, and therefore gaue charge that bothe the Alter and the bull ſhoulde be ingrauen in his coyne. The Emperoure beinge incenſed with theſe ſkommes, threatned he woulde plague the people of Antioch. He remoued thence into Tarſus in Cilicia, as ſoone as he had prouided there ſuche neceſſaries as he ſtoode in neede of, heThe oratiōs of Libanius. went on his iorney. Whereupon Libanius the Sophiſt tooke occaſion to wryte the oration intitled of his embaſſie, where he entreated the Emperoure for the Antiochians, and alſo the oration vnto the people of Antioch where he layde before them the diſpleaſure which the Emperoure had conceaued agaynſt them. The reporte goeth that the Sophiſt wrote the ſayde Orations and yetThe oration of Iulian againſt ſuche as ſlouted his bearde. they neuer were ſeene abroade: and that the Emperoure was appeaſed not by reuenginge him of ſuch as had flouted his beard, but requitinge them with like cōtumelious ſkommes. For he defamed the citie of Antioch for euer in the oration which he entitled Antiochian or Miſopogon directed againſt the deriders of his bearde. So farre of theſe things.

                     NOwe let vs ſpeake of the iniuries which the Emperoure at that time did vnto the Chriſtians at Antioch. Whē he had commaunded that the Idolatricall temples of the Ethnicks ſhoulde be ſet wide open at Antioch, the Emperoure made haſte to the Oracle of Apollo which was in Daphne a litle out of Antioch. But the Deuell whoſe dwellinge was in that denneBabilas the martyr. trembled for feare of Babilas the martyr (whoſe corps laye interred not farre from the place)

and woulde geue the Emperoure no anſwer, the Emperoure perceauing the cauſe, commaunded that the martyrs tumbe ſhoulde thence be remoued with ſpeade. When the chriſtians of Antioch vnderſtoode of this they aſſemble together with women and children, they reioyce and are glad, they ſinge Pſalmes, they tranſlate the corps from out of Daphne into the citie of Antioch.

Then the Emperours diſpoſition which was hid and cloked afore time was made manifeſt vnto the whole worlde. For he who alitle before was a profeſſor of Philoſophie, nowe breaketh out, and fretteth within himſelfe at y• Pſalmes that were ſonge in deriſion of the Gentils, and determineth to torment the chriſtians as Diocletian had done in a while before. But when his expedition againſt the Perſians permitted no leaſure to bring his purpoſe about, he gaue out a commiſſion vnto Saluſtius who was Liuetenante of that prouince, for to ſee that ſuch as had ſonge the Pſalmes in deriſion of the Ethnikes ſhoulde ſeuerely be puniſhed. The Liuetenant althoughe he were a panyme yet was he altogether vnwillinge to execute his commiſſion. But he ſeing there was no other choice attached many of the chriſtians, ſent many to priſon. But one that was a yonge man by name Theodorus and appeached of the Paganes, he tormented with ſundry kindes of puniſhments, and rent the fleſhe all his body ouer with the laſhe of the whippe: and in the ende he commaunded that he ſhould be let looſe when in very deede he was thought not poſſibly able to liue. Yet God reſtored him to his former health, for he liued many yeares after that confeſſion which he yelded in torment. Ruffinus who wrote the eccleſiaſticall hiſtory of his time in the latine tongue reporteth that he had conference a longe time after with this Theodorus and demaunded of him whether he had not felt great payne when the laſhe of the whip rebounded from his body: And that he anſwered him againe that the torments were not ſo grieuous as ſome men thought: that there ſtoode by him a yonge man which wiped away all the ſalte droppes of that ſwettinge combat, confirmed him in the fayth, and that the houre of torment was vnto him rather a delectable pleaſure then a dolefull paine. This much ſhall ſuffice of the renowmed Theodorus. At that very time there came Embaſſadors from the Perſiās vnto the Emperour Iulian, requiringe him to proclaime open warres, he ſent them backe againe with this anſwere. you ſhall ſee me ſhortely in mine owne perſon and therefore I ſhall not neede to ſende any in embaſſy vnto you for this matter.

                     FVrthermore when the Emperoure endeuored an other way to vexe the chriſtians, he ſette for the his owne ſuperſtition to be derided of all men. For when he tooke greate pleaſure in ſacrifice, he did not onely feede his owne fonde humor with the ſhedinge of bloode, but alſo inioyned penalties for ſuche as recreated not themſelues with the like. When he perceaued that he coulde finde but a fewe men of his diſpoſition, he calleth for the Iewes and demaundeth of them the cauſe why they did not ſacrifice, ſeinge that Moſes had commaunded them ſo to doe? after they had anſwered that it was not lawefull for them to execute that functiō in any other place ſaue at Ieruſalem: he commaunded that in all the haſt the temple of Solomon ſhoulde be buylded vp againe. After this he taketh his voyage againſt the Perſians. The Iewes who of a longe time had dreamed they ſhoulde ſee the day when theyr temple ſhoulde be buylded againe for ſacrifice, nowe thinkinge that the houre was come, occupied their heads buſily about the buyldinge: they putte the chriſtians in great feare: they inſolentely crowed ouer them: they threatned them the like entertaynement, as they themſelues had of olde at the Romaynes handes. When by the Emperoures commaundemente the coſte and charges was awarded out of the publicke treaſory, all neceſſaries were prouided: as timber, ſtone, bricke, claye, lyme, together with other things that are required in buyldinge. At what time Cyrillus Biſhop of Ieruſalem remembred the prophecie of Daniel, the which Chriſt had confirmed and prognoſticated vnto many: that the timeThe prophecy of Cyril. Math. 24.

of the temple and turned all downe to the grounde, together with the houſes which adioined therevnto. The Ievves at the ſight thereof were taken with a ſodayne feare, the fame thereof brought many which dwelled in farre countreyes to ſee it. Agayne not only this but alſo many that were preſente ſawe with theyr eyes an other wonder. For there came downe fyre from HeauenFire frō heauen burned the inſtruments of the Iewes. whiche burned all theyr tooles and inſtrumentes. Then mighte a man haue ſeene theyr hammers, grauing irons, ſawes, axes, hatchets and all ſuche thinges as the workemen occupied in the buyldinge, conſumed with fire. The fire ceaſed not to burne the ſpace of a whole daye. The Ievves againe beinge in maner aſtonyed at this ſtraunge ſighte, confeſſed agaynſte theyr wills that Chriſte was an omniporente God: yet yelded they not vnto his will and pleaſure but were helde backe with the ſtubburne opinion of Iudaiſme that was rooted in theyr bones. Neyther coulde the thirde wonder whiche enſued after conuerte them vnto the true fayth. The night followingCroſſes were printed in the clothes of the Iewes that coulde not be wiped away. there were formes of croſſes marked in their garments which ſhined like the ſunne beames: in the morninge when they ſawe them and coueted to wipe and rubbe them of, they coulde not by any meanes. Wherefore beinge blinded as the Apoſtle wryteth, they baniſhed the goodneſſe of God from amonge them. To conclude the temple at that time in ſteede of rayſinge vp was ruynouſly throwne to the grounde.

                     THe Emperour vnderſtanding the maner of the Perſians that in winter they are very weake,The Perſiās &amp; Medes can not abid cold of ſmale power and ſimple courage (for they are a kinde of people that can not awaye with colde: the Mede alſo as it is commonly ſayde, all winter tyme, neuer pulleth his hande out of his boſome) knowinge alſo that the Romayne ſouldiere is of power and force, thoughe the weather pinche neuer ſo much: marched forewardes a litle before winter and led his army into Perſia. Firſt he deſtroyed the countrey, the villages, threwe downe theyr caſtells afterwardes he fell a ranſackinge of their cities. He beſieged Cteſiphon that greate citie of Perſia, and pinched therein the kinge of Perſia very ſore, ſo that he ſente vnto him many Embaſſadors humbly requeſtinge him to take from him ſome parte of his kingdome, to ende the fielde, to rayſe the ſiege and ſo goe his way. But Iulian was nothinge moued therewith: pitied them not at all: neither remembred he the common ſayinge: To conquere is prayſe worthye but inſolentely to triumphe ouer the cōquered is a deſpiteful Act: he put confidence in fond coniectures of ſouth ſaying, he truſted to much fantaſticall dreames, the which Maximus the Philoſopher then preſent put in his heade: he hoped verylie to counteruayle or rather to ſurmount the greater glorie and noble proweſſe of Alexander the Greate, ſo that he ſette noughte by the humble ſute of the Perſians: he dreamed accordinge vnto the opinion of Pythagoras and Plato that by the tranſmigration of the ſoules from one body into an other, the ſoule of Alexander was crepte into his carkaſſe: or rather that he was Alexander himſelfe in an other body. The whiche opinion led him into a foule error, and cauſed him to make light of the kinge of Perſia his requeſte. The kinge vnderſtandinge that his embaſſie was to no purpoſe, beinge broughte to a narrowe ſtraicte and ſore plunge gathered his power the daye after this embaſſie and ioyned with the Romayne hoſte face to face. The Romaynes althoughe they founde greate faulte with theyr Emperoure for refuſinge the offer and fallinge to bloodſhed, yet doubted they not to deale with the Perſians who nowe were come forthe to meete them, ſo that in the ende they putte them to flighte and wonne the fielde. The Emperoure himſelfe was a horſebacke at the battell to the ende he mighte animate and incourage the ſouldiers: but truſting to much to his proſperitie and thinkinge himſelfe cockeſure wente into his campe without complete harneſſe. Therefore an arrowe beinge ſoddaynely ſhotte at him, pearced throughe his arme and ſtucke in his ribbes whiche gaue him his deathes wounde, but who did it, was neuer knowen. Some reporte that he was wounded by a fugitiue Perſian: ſome other that he was ſlayne by one of his owne ſouldiers, whiche is rife in euerye mans mouthe, yet Calistus one of the Emperours houſholde garde, who wrote his life in Heroycall verſe, and the battell whiche he gaue then vnto the Perſians, ſay the that it was a wicked fiende or Deuell that runne him throughe, whiche peraduenture is fayned after the maner of Poeticall inuention, and yet it may very well be true, for we learne that the furies of Hell haue often times recompenced ſuche lewde perſons with extreme puniſhmente. But

howe ſo euer it was euerye man knoweth that for his headye raſheneſſe he was ſubiecte to daunger: for his eloquence, and gifte of vtterance he was deſirous of vayne glorie: and for his counterfete grauitie he was contemned and derided of all men. Thus he ended his life inIulian dyed Anno Dom. 367.

                        Iouianus is created Emperoure. A notable confutation of Libanius the Heathen Rhetorician.
                     
                     THe ſouldiers beinge doubtefull, knowinge not what was beſt to be done, the nexte day after the death of Iulian, without any further deliberation, they proclaime Iouianus a manIouianus was created Emperour Anno Dom. 367. of valiante and noble courage theyr Emperoure. This man beinge a tribune, when Iulian by proclamatiō gaue the ſouldiers in choice eyther to doe ſacrifice or to leaue warefare: choſe rather to throwe awaye his ſwordegirdle then to ſatisfie the wicked and deteſtable edicte of the Emperoure. For all that, Iulian, when the neceſſitie of the warres then in hande conſtrayned him, retayned him in the number of his Captaines. But Iouianus beinge nominated Emperoure refuſeth the crowne and beinge compelled thereunto agaynſte his will by the ſouldieres breaketh out into lowde ſpeache, ſayinge: In that he was a Chriſtian he woulde not be Emperour where Ethnickes ſhoulde become his ſubiectes: yet when all with one voice confeſſed themſelues to be Chriſtians, he yelded and was crowned Emperour. Beinge in Perſia and ſodainely put to his ſhiftes, his ſouldiers alſo being almoſt famiſhed to death: vpon certaine conditions he ioyned in league with the kinge of Perſia and ſo ended the warres. The couenantes as the Romaynes thoughte were vnlaweful, yet conſideringe the caſe of that preſente time they were not to be miſliked. For he was contente to looſe the dominion of Syria and to deliuer the Perſians Niſibis a citie in Meſopotamia. When theſe tidinges were blaſed abroade the Chriſtians conceaued no ſmall ioye at the departure of Iulian: the whole armie alſo miſliked very muche with his vndiſcreete and headye raſheneſſe and laye to his charge that the boundes of the Empire were cutte ſhorte. For be beinge deceaued by a Perſian that was a fugitiue, ſette afire certaine veſſells vpon the ſeaes whiche broughte them corne, and thereof it roſe that the famine grieued them ſore. At that time Libanius the Sophiſt made a funerall oration where he be wayled the death of Iulian and entitled it Iuliana or the Epitaph of Iulian. In the whiche he paynted forthe his life with loftye ſtile in prayſe of his perſon and to his further commendation reporteth of the bookes he had wrytten agaynſte the Chriſtians, and howe that in them he had proued theyr doctrine for triflinge and ridiculous ſtuffe. If this Rhetorician had extolled the Emperoure onely for his other Acts, I would haue proceeded with ſilence to diſcourſe of that which remayneth of the hiſtorie: but in ſo muche he hath mentioned the bookes of Iulian, and like a graue and wiſe orator inueyed bitterly againſte Chriſtian religion, therefore I haue thoughte good to ſaye ſomewhat thereof, and firſte I will laye downe his owne wordes Cap. 23. in the Greeke. Libanius the Sophiſt in his funerall oration vpō the death of Iulian the Apoſtata. 
                        In the vvinter ſeaſon (ſayth he) vvhen the nights are ſomevvhat longe, the Emperoure peruſing thoſe bookes vvhiche affirme that the man vvhoſe originall vvas in Palaeſtina is bothe God and the ſonne of God, confuted them vvith manye reaſons and ſtronge argumentes and condemned them for ridiculous doctrine: affirmed moreouer that the glorious religion, highly eſteemed of them was full of toyes and trifles, vvhere he proued himſelfe to be farre vviſer then the olde grayberde of Tyrus. VVherefore let the olde man of Tyrus (he meaneth Porphyrius) conceaue no diſpleaſure at all but patientely vveye vvherein his childe doth preiudice his creditte. Theſe are the wordes of Libanius the Sophiſte. Truely I will ſaye no leſſe, but that he was a notable Rhetorician and I am verelye perſwaded that if he had not conſented vnto the Emperours religion, he woulde haue had no other ſpeache in his mouthe then the Chriſtians haue at this day, and that by all likelyhoode, beinge an excellent Rhetorician, he woulde haue extolled Chriſtian religion vnto the ſkies. For he wrote in the prayſe of Conſtantius while he liued, after his deſeaſe he wrote to his diſprayſe and made inuectiues agaynſte him. Wherefore if Porphyrius had bene Emperoure, he woulde haue preferred his workes before the wrytinges of Iulian: againe if

                        Iulian had bene a Sophiſt (as he wrote of Ecebolius in his funerall oration of Iulian) he would haue called him a

                        e Rhetorician. In as muche as then he beinge of the ſame religion with the Emperoure, beinge a Rhetorician, beinge alſo his friende wrote his pleaſure of him: we alſo after our habilitie will fall to anſwere his ſclaunderous workes. Firſt he ſayth that in the winter ſeaſon the nights beinge ſomwhat longe he tooke great paines in peruſing the chriſtians bookes He ſignifieth by taking of paines in this place, that his trauell was greate in wrytinge of inuectiues, as Rhetoricians doe vſe, when they traine vp youth to the knoweledge of their art. A good while agoe he read thoſe bookes in deede, tooke greate paynes, diſcourſed at large, not as Libanius ſayth with ſtronge argumentes, but with weake, in ſomuche they were contrarie to the trueth, and endeuored ſkoffinge wiſe to refell ſuche thinges as of themſelues were of force inoughe. For whoſoeuer diſputeth with an other, laboureth to foile his aduerſarie, ſometime by corrupting and peruerting, ſome other time by concealinge of the trueth. Whoſoeuer alſo he be that oweth ſpite and hatred vnto any man, he will endeuer like a deadly enemy not onely to doe, but alſo to ſpeake the worſte of him: he will alſo wreſte all the miſchiefe whiche the enemy deuiſeth agaynſt him, vpon his aduerſarie. Their owne bookes doe manifeſtly declare, that bothe Iulian and Porphyrius (whome he calleth the gray bearde of Tyrus) were raylers and ſkoffers. For Porphyrius in his booke intitled the liues of Philoſophers, wrytinge of Socrates the chiefe of all the reſte, inueyeth againſt him bitterly: and wryteth to his contumely raylinge ſpeaches and farre more opprobrious languages, then Melitus or Anytus who of olde ſclaundered him alike, euer durſte to reuile Socrates with all. I meane that Socrates whome the Gentils haue in greate admiration for his temperance, iuſtice and others his vertues: whome Plato the deuine Philoſopher, whome Xenophon with the whole Senate of Philoſophers doe greately reuerence. But Iulian followinge his fathers ſteppes in all thinges, reuealed vnto the worlde that corrupte humor whiche troubled his heade (wherewich he reuiled all the Emperours and Caeſars that were before him) in ſo muche that he ſpared not, no not his deare friende the Philoſopher Marcus. Wherefore lette theyr wrytinges be iudge whether bothe Porphyrius and Iulian were reuilers and ſclaunderers or no. Neyther haue I neede of greate and weyghtie argumentes to confirme this my aſſertion: but the opinions of diuerſe ſage perſonages grounded vpon good coniectures the whiche I minde to alleage ſhall ſtande for ſufficiente proofe. What Gregorie Nazianzen hathe thoughe of Iulian, lette vs firſt of all ſee out of his owne wordes. For in his ſeconde Oration agaynſt the Gentils he wryteth thus. Althoughe bothe his raygne and

                        alſo experience hathe taughte other men that theſe thinges vvere moſte true in him: yet perceaued I them longe a goe ſince the time I vvas aquaynted vvith him at Athens. For he came thither vvhen the Empereſſe had procured licence of the Emperoure for his voyage, vvhen alſo his brother Gallus had conſpired the deathe of Constantius the Emperoure. There vvere tvvo cauſes that moued him to repayre vnto Athens. The firſt tollerable, the ſeconde of ſmale honeſtie: the firſt to ſee Grece and the ſchooles that florished therein: the ſeconde (vvhiche vvas more ſecrete and knovven vnto fevve) for to conſulte vvith ſouthſayers and ſacrificers about his affayres in time to come, becauſe it vvas not then openly permitted for the authors of ſuche impiety to practiſe ſuche Deuelishe inuentions. And I my ſelfe in coniecturinge of him at that time (although I am not of the number of Propheciers) vvas not much deceaued: for his vvauering mind and frenticke diſpoſition, made me a Prophet good inough. He vvich goeth neareſt the marke by coniecture, is commonly called the beſte Prophere. I ſavve not one ſigne

                        in him that gaue me any hope of him that euer he woulde become an honeſte man. He had a runninge heade: his shoulders did neuer lynne vvagginge, and lay ſlatte or ſtipe vviſe: he had vvinkinge eyes that continevvally rolled in his heade: his countenance vvas ſtaringe: he had a ſlidinge, ſlippery and limpinge pace: his viſage vvas ſcornefull: he had a flyringe face of his ovvne, the which his immoderate laughter and continevvall ſkorninge did declare: his maner vvas without all good order to ſay and vnſay: his vvords came tumblinge out vvith vehemencie and ſtoppes, the ſentence broken in the middes: his queſtions and obiections were rashe and foolish, his anſvvers vvere litle better which oftentimes follovved one after the other, and as there vvas litle holde of them, ſo were they propoſed vvithout order. But what neede I to runne ouer all particulers. I foreſawe in him before he was created Emperour that which aftervvardes proued to be moſte true. If there were preſentely in place any of my familiars vvhiche hearde me thus diuininge of him, I am ſure they woulde teſtifie this to be no othervviſe then
                        
                        I doe reporte it: in vvhoſe hearinge alſo at the foreſight of theſe thinges I vttered theſe vvordes: O good God vvhat a monſter the Empire of Rome doth nourishe. VVhen I had vttered theſe vvordes I deſired of God that in this behalfe I might be founde a lyer. For that had bene farre better, then that the vvhole vvorlde shoulde haue bene viſited vvith ſo many miſchiefes, then that ſuche a monſter shoulde euer haue beene ſeene amonge men, vvhen the like thereof had neuer bene remembred before: ſeing there happened many deluges and floodes ouerflowing the countreys, the vvhich both yong and olde at this houre doth remember: great loſſe by fire: terrible earthquakes and gapinge of the grounde, and men alſo of a ſtraunge shape vvere ſeene borne into the vvorld, of mixte and compound natuers halfe man halfe beaſt. But he purchaſed vnto himſelfe ſuche an ende as his frentike diſpoſition by all right deſerued. Theſe thinges did Gregorie reporte of Iulian. Becauſe that Porphyrius and Iulian bothe, in many their raſhe allegations to the ſclaunder of Chriſtian religion haue done greate iniurie to the trueth, partely by peruertinge certaine places of holy Scripture, partly alſo by reconcilinge of others after theyr owne fooliſhe iudgement, with applyinge of them to their owne purpoſe: many withſtoode them, confuted and ouerthrewe their Sophiſticall poſitions, yea aboue all the reſt, Origen, who floriſhed a long tyme before the raigne of Iulian, ſifted out ſuch places of holy Scripture as ſeemed to bring the readers into doubt, layd downe the obiections together with the anſwers, &amp; ſatisfied the captious &amp; vayne doubts of wicked perſons. If Iulian and Porphyrius had diligently peruſed theſe his workes, they woulde (I am ſure) not onely haue approued the ſame but alſo applyed all theyr giftes to other matters and neuer ſette theyr mindes to wryte Sophiſticall fallacies full of blaſphemous impietie agaynſt the maieſtie of God. It is manifeſt hereby that the Emperoure vſed theſe cauillations amonge rude and vnlearned people, and not in the hearinge of ſuch as had learned the manifeſt trueth out of holy Scripture. For when he had heaped together many wordes of holy Scripture whiche are neceſſaryly ſette forthe after a common and vſuall kinde of fraſe to expreſſe the Oeconomie, the order in doinge or diſpenſation of God, in the ende he ſayth thus: Verely theſe places euery one vnleſſe the ſentence hath ſome ſecret or hid myſtery (the whiche
                        Iulian lib. 3. contra Chriſtian. 
                        I take to be moſt true) contayne as farre forthe as the vvordes geue vs to vnderſtande manye blaſphemies againſt God. This was one amonge other of his argumentes layde downe in his thirde booke againſt the Chriſtians. In his booke intitled Cyniſme while he endeuoreth to inſtructe vs howe farre forthe it may be lawefull for vs to proceede in framinge of holy fables or diuine comedies, his opinion is that in the handelinge of ſuche matters it behoued vs to conceale the trueth, his wordes are theſe: Nature had leuer be vnreuealed, the hidde alſo,
                        Iulian lib. Cyniſ. 
                        and the intrecate eſſence of the Gods vvill not in any vviſe ſuffer it ſelfe to be beaten vvith playne and manifeſte vvordes, into the defiled eares of men. Wherefore the Emperoure as farre forthe as we can gather by his wordes, ſeemeth to be of that opinion toutchinge holy Scripture, becauſe the wordes are myſticall and contayne ſecrecie: but it grieues him that all men be not of his minde and therefore he ſcorneth at ſuch Chriſtians as vnderſtande the ſayd myſteries ſimplie. Yet he ſhoulde not haue ſo derided the ſimplicitie of the common people: neyther therefore to haue inueyed againſt holy Scripture: neither to haue abhorred and deteſted the ſenſe and notable ſentences compriſed in the ſame, becauſe all men did not vnderſtande them as he thoughte good. Nowe as it is very euidente the like happened vnto Porphyrius. This Porphyrius
                        Impatiencie brought Porphyrius into Apoſtaſie. beinge rebuked of certaine Chriſtians at Caeſarea in Palaeſtina, beinge altogether impaciente throughe boylinge choler, and burninge heate of furious rage fell from the Chriſtian faythe and raſhely tooke penne in hande (becauſe of the hatred he owed vnto them, whiche reprehended him) for to wryte bookes where he inueyed bitterly with contumelious ſtile againſte all Chriſtians: as I reede in the bookes of Euſebius Pamphilus whiche he wrote to the confutation of his workes. The Emperoure alſo ſettinge vp him ſelfe inſolencely agaynſt the Chriſtians in the hearing of vnlearned perſons, and being prouoked thereunto by the ſelfe ſame frentike and raginge humor fell into the like Apoſtaſie with Porphyrius. Wherefore bothe of them, fallinge of theyr owne accorde into extreme impietie, and priuye in conſcience to theyre blaſphemous practiſes receaued puniſhment due vnto theyr deſeruinge. Furthermore when Libanius the Sophiſte ſkornefully derided the Chriſtians, in theſe wordes: they take the man that was borne in Palaeſtina for God and the ſonne of God: me thinkes he forgetteth himſelfe when asLibanius in

Agayne a little after: O thou ſcholar (ſayeth he) of the deuells: O thou diſciple of the deuells: O thou aſſiſtent and aſſociate of the deuells. Although he vnderſtoode this otherwiſe, yet in ſo much he eſchewed not the equiuocall worde which compriſed alſo the Deuell, he ſeemed to vtter no leſſe then the Chriſtians accuſtomed to doe in reproche. Wherefore if he had determined with him ſelfe to extoll any man, he ſhoulde haue auoyded euery ambiguous worde in ſuch ſorte as he reiected an other phraſe beynge reprehended for it, and blotted it out of his bookes. Howe that man in Chriſt is made God: howe that he is both man openly, and God in myſterie, howe that alſo both theſe thinges may be iuſtifyed, the holie bookes of the Chriſtians doe declare. The Ethnickes before they beleeue, are not able to comprehende it. For the ſaying of the Prophete is true: If you beleeue not, ye shall not be able to vnderſtand. Wherefore they are not aſhamed to number many mortall men in the catalogue of the gods. I would to God they had offended herein onely in takinge them for godds who were vertuous lyuers, iuſte men, and temperate perſons: but they haue preferred ſuch as were impure, vniuſt, and dronken ſortes: I meane Herculeans, Bacchians, Aeſculapians, whome Libanius doeth veryHercules.

Moreouer when Alexander king of Macedonia came to Aſia, the people Amphictiones brought him preſents, of whome the Oracle of Apollo in Delphos made this anſwere, and charged the people as followeth:

                     Theſe were the words which the deuell out of the breaſt of Pythia vttered of Alexander. The ſame Oracle to the ende he myght flatter greate perſonages and Princes of greate power, numbred them in the catalogue of the gods, and peraduenture this anſwere was no other but a flatteringe of Alexander. To what ende ſhall I write of Cleomêdes the wraſtler, of whome to the endeCleomêdes was a wraſtler of exceeding ſtrēgth &amp; greatneſſe of body, who beinge put beſide the price at the game of Olympus, fell madde.

                        Diogenes Cynicus and Oinomaus the philoſopher, condemned the Oracle of Apollo for this aforeſayde follie. The people Cyciceni called Adrianus the thirtienth god: Adrianus him ſelfe counted Antinous his dearlinge in the catalogue of the gods. Yet Libanius woulde not once open his lyppes to the reprehenſion of theſe ridiculous toyes and meere follie. Neuertheleſſe though he peruſed theſe Oracles, and read ouer the booke of Adrias, intituled The lyfe of Alexander,

I tell you truely I cā not away wt contention, but ſuch as embrace vnitie &amp; concord, I doe both honor &amp; reuerence them.

Theſe men aſſemble them ſelues at Antioch in Syria together with Meletius, who a litle before had ſeuered him ſelfe from their communion, they creepe to familiaritie &amp; conference with him. The cauſe that moued them therevnto was, for that they ſawe him in great eſtimation with the Emperour, who then made his abode at Antioche.

Vnto our moſt holy and gratious lorde Iouianus, victorious, puiſant, Auguſtus: the councell of bishops aſſembled at Antioch out of ſundry prouinces, ſend greeting in the Lorde. VVe haue experience &amp; tryall ſufficient (moſt holy Emperour) howe that your graces highnes with great induſtrie endeuoureth to eſtablishe peace &amp; vnitie in the church of God: neither are we ignorant howe that your prudent aduice thinketh no leſſe then that the forme of the catholicke faith will preuayle very much to the furtherance and confirmation of the aforeſayde vnitie and concorde. Therefore leſt we should be numbred among the corrupters of the true and ſyncere character of Chriſtian doctrine: we thought good to let your maieſtie vnderſtand that we both allowe and retaine vnuiolably the Creede confirmed of old in the holy &amp; ſacred councell of Nice: ſithence that the clauſe of One ſubſtance (according vnto ſome mens thinkinge vnaduiſedly layde downe) is very well interlaced of the fathers, interpreted and expounded both with commodious phraſes, and fitt epithetons: the which expoſition sheweth forth the ſonne to be begotten of the fathers ſubſtance: to be like vnto the father according vnto his ſubſtance: that
                        
                        no paſſion ought to be conceaued in his inexplicable generation: that the word Substance was not vſed of the holie fathers in that ſenſe which the Graecians take it, but to the ouerthrowe of the poyſoned doctrine which the blaſphemous mouth of Arius endeuoured to eſtablishe, ſaying that Chriſt had his originall of nothinge: that alſo theſe Anomoians affirming (by interpretation) the ſonne to be vnlike the father, who lately ſtept vp, auoutched more impudent and levvde doctrine to the ouerthrovve of the eccleſiaſticall peace and vnitie. VVherfore vve haue thought good to annexe vnto this our ſupplication, vvherein our cenſure and opinion is layde

The Emperour who determined with him ſelfe to pacifie with gentle and curteous languages all quarelles and contention, made anſwere that he woulde not moleſt any, what faith or religion ſoeuer they profeſſed, but aboue all others that he woulde honour and reuerence ſuch as ſhewed them ſelues peacemakers, and went about to mayntayne the bonde of vnitie and concorde. Themistius the philoſopher dothFlatterers are likened vnto the ſea Euripus which ebbeth and floweth ſeuē times a day. report theſe thinges in this ſort of him. For in the oration intituled Conſul, the which he wrote of him, he extolleth him vnto the ſkies, becauſe that in grauntinge euery man free choyce and libertie to profeſſe this or that kinde of religion, he ſtopped the mouthes of all flattering paraſites and ſycophants, which kinde of men (ſayeth he nyppinge wyſe) as it is knowen vnto the whole world, worſhip not the kinge of heauen, but the earthly crowne and ſcepter, much like vnto Euripus caryed headlong ſome times this way, ſome times that way.

For though before that tyme vnder the raygne of Iulian, the one beynge Tribune, I meane Valentinian, the other beynge of the ordinarie garde and dayly about the Emperour, I meane Valens, they both declared vnto the worlde the zeale they bare vnto Chriſtian religion (for beynge conſtrayned to ſacrifice, they choſe rather to flinge from them their ſworde gyrdels, then forſake the faith of Chriſt, ſo that the Emperour Iulian depoſed nere nother of them from their dignities, no more he dyd not Iouian, who immediately ſucceeded him in the Empire, perceauinge they were profitable members of the common wealth) yet afterwardes hauinge gotten the ſupremacie &amp; the emperiall ſcepter, notwithſtandinge their diligence and care was alike in the adminiſtration of the publicke weale at the beginninge of their raygne, for all that toutchinge the faith (as I ſayde before) they varyed one from an other, and ſhewed a contrarie and a diuers countenance vnto the profeſſors of Chriſtian religion. Valentinian as he honored and reuerenced the fauourers of his faith and opinion: ſo he moleſted the Arians not at all: yet Valens endeuoured not onely to encreaſe the numbre of the Arians, but alſo (as hereafter ſhall more manifeſtlyLiberius.

                         was ouer the congregations which addicted them ſelues vnto the faith of One ſubſtance: but ouer the Arians was Lucius, whome the heretickes choſe to their biſhop immediatly after the deſeaſe of Georgius. The Arians inhabitinge Antioch had Euzoius to their byſhop. Such as maynetayned there alſo the faith of One ſubſtance, were deuided into two partes, ouer the one was Paulinus, ouer the other Meletius. Cyrillus was then biſhop of Ieruſalem, and Eudoxius the Arian, biſhop of Conſtantinople. The defenders of the creede which contayned the clauſe of One ſubſtance, were fayne to meete in a litle chappell within the ſayd citie, and there to celebrate their wonted ſolemnity. The ſect of the Macedonians which varied from the Acacians in Seleucia, enioyed their churches throughout euery citie. And thus went the affayres of the church in thoſe dayes.

                     THe Emperour Valentinian tooke his iorney with all ſpeede into the Weſt, whither he was conſtrained by reaſon of earneſt buſines to remoue. But Valens as he remayned at Conſtantinople was viſited of the Biſhops which were of the ſect of Macedonius, and requeſted to ſummone an other ſynode for the eſtabliſhing of the true faith. The emperour thinking verily they were of one opinion with Acacius &amp; Eudoxius, gaue them licence to call a councell together. They from euery where cited the biſhops to meete at Lampſacum. But Valens with all celerity gott himThe councell of Lampſacum gathered together of Macedonian hereticks. to Antioch in Syria, fearing leſt the Perſians ſhould breake the league of thirty yeares made in the raygne of Iouianus, and inuade the Romaine dominions, where he founde that the Perſians were quiet and meant no harme. The Emperour therefore liuing in peace and enioying quietnes raiſed great and grieuous perſecution againſt them which embraced the faith of one ſubſtance. And although he moleſted not Paulinus the Biſhop, for his rare vertues and ſinguler giftes, yet baniſhed he Meletius. but others of the Churches of Antioch that woulde not communicate with Euzoius, he vexed diuerſly and plagued with ſundry penalties and puniſhments. It is reported moreouer that he threwe many into the riuer Orontes which runneth by the citie, and there drowned them.

Againe they gaue ſentence againſt Acacius and Eudoxius, as of right deſeruing to be remoued. Eudoxius Biſhop of Conſtantinople could in no wiſe reſiſt their doings, the commotion and warres then in hande rayſed by the tyrant Procopius, was a cauſe and let that he coulde not reuenge him of them. Wherefore Eleuſius Biſhop of Cyzicum hauing gotten the vpper hande, maintayned for a while together with his complices the Macedonian opinion, the which alſo a litle before was diſcloſed and made more manifeſt at the councell of Lampſacum. I ſuppoſe verily the ſayd councell to haue bene cauſe why Helleſpontus (for Lampſacum is a towne on the ſea ſide of Helleſpontus towards Aſia) is ſo full of the Macedonian hereticks. The aforeſayd councell was ended as you reade before.

                     THe Emperour being puffed vp with his proſperous and lucky ſucceſſes, turned himſelfe againe to moleſt &amp; perſecute the chriſtians becauſe he determined with him ſelf to preferre euery where the Arian opinion. And firſt of all the councell held at Lāpſacum lay on his ſtomacke not onely becauſe they depoſed the Arian Biſhops and depriued them of their Churches, but alſo becauſe they accurſed the forme of faith lately eſtabliſhed at Ariminum. Wherefore after his comming vnto Nicomedia a citie of Bithynia he called before him Eleuſius Biſhop of Cyzicum, who as I ſayde before was of the Macedonian opinion. The Emperour called together a councell of Arian Biſhops, and compelled Eleuſius to ſubſcribe vnto their faith. Who though at the firſt he denied vtterly that he woulde agree thereunto, yet afterwards being fore threatned of the Emperour with baniſhment and confiſcation of all his ſubſtance, he yelded vnto the Arian opinion: Immediatly after his ſubſcription he was in a great agony and torment of conſcience: he returned thence to Cyzicum: In the face of the congregation he made a pitifull complaint with relation of the iniurie which the Emperour had done vnto him: how he had condeſcended not with his will, but by compulſion vnto the Arian hereſie: he requeſted they woulde get them an other bishop, becauſe that he was conſtrayned to deny his owne opinion, but the inhabiters of Cyzicum for the great loue and affection they bare towards him, neyther woulde acknowledge an other biſhop ouer them, neyther yeld vp the gouernment of their Church. Wherfore they both tooke him for their ſuperior, and kept ſtill their former opinion.

Whereupon the fauorers of Eleuſius buylded them a church without the walls of the citie, and there had their priuate conuenticles. but of Eleuſius ſo farre. And

                           ck. now let vs returne vnto Eunomius. This Eunomius was a ſcribe of Aetius, who was ſurnamed the Atheiſt, of whome we ſpake before. And liuing with this Aetius he learned of him captious fallaces and quircks of Logick, the which Sophiſters doe highly embrace and exerciſed him ſelf therin continewally. Moreouer he was delighted with vayne ſpeaches and epithetons: he learned vnaduiſedly

to frame ſophiſticall arguments: he tooke great pride therein and ranne headlong into open blaſpemy. he embraced the hereſie of Arius and impugned the trueth in Chriſt. And although he was in maner ignorant as toutching holy Scripture and the vnderſtanding thereof: yet was he able to decline the words and vary the phraſe, but he coulde neuer attaine vnto the marke he ſhot at, as his ſeuen bookes of commentaries vpon the epiſtle of S. Paul vnto the Romaines
                         fooliſhly written doe declare. When he had vttered many dayne and friuolous expoſitions of that epiſtle, his capacity could not compriſe neither attaine vnto the drift of the Apoſtle. There are extant certaine other bookes of his not vnlike the former, the which if any be diſpoſed to peruſe, he ſhall finde many words, but litle matter. It was this Eunomius that Eudoxius preferred to the biſhopricke of Cyzicum. When as he after his wonted maner fedd the eares of his auditors out of the pulpitt wt ſophiſticall arguments and reaſons of Logick, he amazed his auditory, ſo that thereupon there was rayſed a great tumult at Cyzicum. for the citizens of Cyzicum when they coulde not away wt his arrogant and inſolent maner of preaching, they baniſhed him their citie. Thence he gott him to Conſtantinople, liued with Eudoxius and playd the Biſhop no longer. Yet leſt we ſeeme in the way of ſclaunder onely to report theſe thinges of him, let vs heare the blaſphemous wordes of Eunomius him ſelfe, wherewith moſt impiouſly after his Sophiſticall maner he derogated from the maieſty of Almighty God. he ſayd as followeth: God of his owne eſſence vnderſtandeth no moreThe blaſphe mies of Eunomius the heretick. then we doe, neither is the ſame better knowen or vnderſtoode of him then of vs: and whatſoeuer we knowe of it, the ſame knoweth he, and looke what his capacitie reacheth vnto, the ſame thou ſhalt finde in vs. Theſe and many other ſuch lewde fallacies linked Eunomius together, but after what ſorte he fell from the Arians, I will hereafter declare.

                        Of the oracle that was founde ingrauen in a ſtone, when the Emperour Valens vpon diſpleaſure ouerthrewe the walls of Chalcedon.
                     
                     THe Emperour vpon diſpleaſure gaue commaundement that the walls of Chalcedon lying ouer againſt Byzantium ſhould be ouerthrowen. for he tooke an othe that if he gott the vpper hand of Procopius the tyrant, he would do it becauſe y• citizens of Chalcedon tooke Procopius part and reuiled him as he paſſed by the walls of their citie with ſpitefull and contumelious languages, and ſhutt vp their gates againſt him. ſo it fell out that the walls of the citie by the commaundement of the Emperour were throwen downe to the grounde. the ſtones there of were caryed to the common baths at Conſtantinople called Conſtantianae. In one of the ſayd ſtones there was an oracle founde ingrauen the which of olde lay in ſecret, &amp; then firſt came to light. Whereby it appeared that the walls ſhould be taken to the vſe of the baths, when great plēty of waters were ſeene in the citie: and that when infinite of the Barbarian nations inuaded the Romayne dominions, they ſhoulde wonderfully moleſt the empire of Rome, and in the ende be ouerthrowen them ſelues, there is no cauſe to the contrary but that the reader may haue the oracle layd before him.

                     The oracle is in this ſort. for not long after the conduyt which 
                           Ʋalens made, yelded great plenty of water vnto the citie of Conſtantinople: at the ſame time alſo (as hereafter ſhall more manifeſtly appeare) certaine of the Barbarian nations tooke armour againſt the empire of Rome. yet y• oracle may otherwiſe be vnderſtoode. for Clearchus the Lieuetenant of the city after y• conueyance of the conduyt, made a great pipe in Theodoſius market the which was called the plentifull pipe, where alſo for ioye thereof the citie kept a ſolemne feaſte, and this peraduenture was it which the Oracle meant when he ſayd:

                     But theſe circumſtances &amp; knowledge of the oracle fel out afterwards. When ye walls of Chalcedon were a throwing downe, y• citizens of Conſtantinople made humble ſute vnto ye Emperour yt he would not ſo deface the city of Chalcedon. y• like did y•

who by chaunce then were at Conſtantinople. but the emperour being throughly incenſed againſt them, tooke their ſute in very ill part: &amp; to the end he might kepe his othe, he commaunded the wal ſhoulde downe and the foundation ſhould be filled vp with litle pelting ſtones, ſo that as yet there is to be ſeene in ſome places of the wall, how ſclender and what newe building of no accompt was raiſed vpon ſo auncient and ſubſtantiall a foundation. but of the walls of Chalcedon ſo much ſhall ſuffice.

                     THe Emperour moreouer ceaſed not from perſecuting ſuch as embraced the creede contayning the clauſe of one ſubſtance, but baniſhed them out of Conſtantinople, and together with them the Nouatians who addicted them ſelues vnto the ſame opinion: their Churche doores he commaunded to be nayled vp: their Biſhop Agelius a man that led a preciſe life, and ruled the Church euen from the raigne of Conſtantine he exiled. This man all his life tyme went barefoote and according vnto the commaundement of the Goſpell, he had but one coate. At that tune Martianus who ſometime was a ſouldier in the Emperours pallace, a zealous and an eloquent man, appeaſed the diſpleaſure of the Emperour conceaued againſt the Nouatians. He was then a Prieſt of the Nouatian Churche, and trayned vp Anaſtaſia and Caroſis the Emperours daughters in the precepts of Grammer: in whoſe name the common bathes buylded by Valens at Conſtantinople were conſecrated, the which as yet are there to be ſeene bearing the name of the Emperours daughters. Wherefore by reaſon of his ſute and becauſe of the reuerende opinion which the Emperour conceaued of this prieſt, the Nouatian Churches being ſhutt vp for a while, were ſet wide open and frequented a newe, yet were they not ridd of the Arians nor deliuered from their perſecution. The Arians abhorred them becauſe they loued entirely ſuch as embraced the faith of one ſubſtance. The ſtate of the Eccleſiaſticall affayres then was at this point. This one thing we may not leaue vntoutched, how the battell betwene the Emperour and Procopius the tyrant was fought about the latter ende of May. in the conſulſhip of Gratianus and Dagalephus. In a while after the ſayd battell, the aforeſayd men being Conſulls, the Emperour 
                           Ʋalentinianus had a ſonne borne him in the Weſt, whome he called after his owne name, for his ſonne Gratianus was borne before he was crowned Emperour.

                           Ʋalens was nothing moued to incline vnto piety and right reformation of true religion. for they obſerued no meane but furiouſly raged againſt all ſuch as helde the contrary faith and opinion. Theſe earthquakes were no otherwiſe to be taken then for manifeſt tokens of the ſchiſme &amp; tumults then rayſed in y• church. And though many of the prieſtly order were depriued of their dignities, yet of all the reſt Baſilius Biſhop of Caeſarea in Cappadocia, and Gregorius Biſhop of a ſmall and meane citie bordering vpon Caeſarea, by the prouidence of God for their great pietie were not baniſhed their natiue ſoile.

Of whome I ſhall haue occaſion hereafter to diſcourſe more at large.
                  
                  
                     CAP. XI.
                     
                        How the ſect of Macedonius being put to their ſhifts by reaſon of the Emperours diſpleaſure, ſent their letters vnto Liberius Biſhop of Rome, where they ſubſcribed vnto the fayth of one ſubſtance.
                     
                     WHen as at that tyme ſuch as cleaued ſtedfaſtly vnto the clauſe of one ſubſtance being the true Chriſtians, were vexed aboue meaſure: the Macedonians alſo were purſued of the wicked and godleſſe perſecutors. Theſe men partly for feare and partly for their fayth being brought to their witts ende, wrote letters and ſent meſſengers from their biſhopricks one vnto the other, ſignifying that of neceſſity they muſt flie for refuge both vnto the Emperours brother and to Liberius Biſhop of Rome, and ſubſcribe rather vnto their fayth then condeſcende to communicate with Eudoxius the Arian. Wherefore they ſende Euſtathius Biſhop of Sebaſtia, one that had bene often times depoſed: Siluanus Biſhop of Tarſus in Cilicia, and Theophilus Biſhop of Caſtabala a citie likewiſe of Cilicia: theſe men are charged not to diſagree as toutching the faith with Liberius, but to communicate with the Churche of Rome and to ratifie by their ſubſcriptions the faith of one ſubſtance. When theſe men had receaued their letters which impugned the faith at Seleucia, in all the haſt they poſt to olde Rome. They ſhewe not them ſelues vnto the Emperour (for he was in Fraunce, buſily occupying him ſelfe about the battell againſt the Sarmatians) but deliuer their letters vnto Liberius. Liberius refuſeth to geue their letters the reading, he tolde them they were Arians and therefore in no wiſe to be entertayned of the Church, becauſe they had abrogated the creede of the Nicene councell. Unto whome they make anſwere that his words were true, yet that they repented them afterwards of their folly: that they acknowledge the trueth: that of late they had condemned the opinion which affirmeth the ſonne to be vnlike the father: that they confeſſed the ſonne in all thinges and in all reſpects to be like the father, and that the clauſe of likenes differed nothing from the ſenſe of one ſubſtance. When they had made this proteſtation by word of mouth, he requireth them to doe the ſame in writing. They immediatly exhibite vnto him a ſupplication where in the forme of faith publiſhed and eſtabliſhed by the councell of Nice was compriſed. And leſt that I ſeeme ouertedious vnto the reader, my purpoſe is to omitt the letters they wrote from one company to an other, namely from Smyrna in Aſia, from Piſidia, Iſauria, Pamphilia and Lycia: onely here to lay downe the ſupplication which Euſtathius ſent from his lodging vnto Liberius, it was written as followeth:
                     
                        
                           Vnto their Lorde and brother their fellow minister Liberius, Euſtathius, Theophilus &amp; Syluanus ſende greeting in the Lorde.
                           To the ende vve may remoue all ſuſpicion of hereſie and partaking vvith ſects vvhatſoeuer,The hereticall Biſhops of Macedonius ſect, now doe recant &amp; exhibite this ſupplica tion vnto Liberius biſhop of Rōe. which heretofore haue moleſted the quiet eſtate of the catholick church: preſently we do allow of the ſynods &amp; aſſemblies of bishops which mett at Lampſacum &amp; Smyrna, &amp; at ſundry other places maintaining the right &amp; ſoūd faith. that theſe our words may ſeeme for no other thē our true meaning, we are legats &amp; haue brought letters vnto your holines, vnto al the bishops of Italie &amp; to the other churches whatſoeuer of the weſt contrey, whereby it shall manifeſtly appeare that vve are of the Catholick faith: that vve defende the ſacred Canons of the Nicene councell eſtablished in the happy raygne of the holy Emperour Constantine by three hundred and eyghteene Bishops, the which vnto this day haue bene continewally obſerued and vnuiolably retained: where the clauſe of one ſubſtance was godly enterlaced to the ouerthrowe of the poiſoned opinion of Arius. for by ſubſcribing with our owne hands we doe plainly proteſt that we are of no other opinion then theſe fathers were of: but that heretofore &amp; preſently alſo we embrace the ſame faith with them &amp; mind firmely to continew therin vnto our laſt houre. Moreouer we cō
                              demne Arius, his deteſtable opinion, his diſciples, his complices: the whole hereſie of Sabellius, all the Patropaſſians, Marcioniſts, Photinians, Marcelliās, &amp; to be short the wicked ſect of Paulus Samoſatenus. VVe pronounce theſe mens doctrine for accurſed together with all that holde with them, all hereſies like wiſe which are contrary vnto the aforeſayd ſacred faith, generally &amp; godly framed by thoſe holy fathers aſſembled in the city of Nice. VVe accurſe alſo the forme of

faith that was repeated at the councell of Ariminum, partly for that it repugneth the Nicene Creede, &amp; partly for that diuers vvere fraudulently brought to ſubſcribe vnto the ſame at Conſtantinople, through vviles &amp; periury miſtaking the title, for they tooke Nice a city of Thracia, for Nice in Bithynia. The beliefe &amp; faith vve are of, &amp; of them likewiſe vvhoſe legats vve are, is as followeth: VVe beleeue in one God the father almighty, maker of all things viſible &amp; inuiſible,The Nicene Creede. &amp; in one onely begotten God our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt the ſonne of God, begotten of the father, that is of the ſubſtance of the father: God of God, light of light: very God of very God begotten not made: being of one ſubſtance with the father by whom all things were made, either in heauen or in earth, who for vs men &amp; for our ſaluation came downe from heauen, was incarnate &amp; made man, he ſuffred &amp; roſe againe the third day, he aſcended into heauen &amp; shall come againe to iudge both the quicke &amp; the dead. And we beleue in the holy Ghoſt. ſuch as ſay there was a time when he was not: or that he was not before his incarnation: or that he hath his being of nothinge: or that he conſiſteth of any other eſſence or ſubſtance then of the fathers: or that the ſonne of God is conuertible and mutable, them I ſaye▪ the holy and Catholick Churche vnder heauen doth holde for accurſed. I Euſtathius bishop of Sebaſtia, Theophilus &amp; Siluanus legats of the councells of Lampſacum, Smyrna, with others, haue voluntarily with our owne proper hands ſubſcribed vnto all the premiſſes &amp; to euery parcell within compriſed. If any man after this our proteſtation commenſe any ſute or accuſe either vs or them whiche ſent vs, let him come with your holineſſe letters vnto ſome of the catholick Bishops whome you thinke beſt, &amp; there pleade with vs in their preſence &amp; ſo let the punishment light vpon his heade that is faulty.

Your letters (welbeloued brethren &amp; mē that are bedecked with the bright beames of fayth) we haue receaued by the reuerend brethren &amp; bishops Eustathius, Siluanus &amp; Theophilus, containing quietnes &amp; concord of the catholick church, which confirmed in vs fully out deſired ioy &amp; gladnes. And firſt of all becauſe that therby we perceaued your faith &amp; opinion to be in all pointes agreeable both with mine which am the meaneſt of you all, with the other bishops of Italy &amp; the reſt of the weſt contreyes: nay not only this but alſo your legats haue confirmed it with the teſtimony of their owne handes. This Catholick &amp; Apoſtolicke faith we doe acknowledge which from the councell of Nice hitherto hath firmely &amp; vnuiolably continewed. This was the faith that your legats proteſted: in this faith with notable corage they haue accurſed all the croked ſteppes of cankred opinions, &amp; quenched all the fiery ſparcles that ſlashed thereof. This faith not onely by preaching vnto the people but alſo by penning of it in paper they haue published vnto the worlde. The coppy whereof we thought good to annexe vnto theſe letters, leſt the hereticks finde meanes hereby to cauill: euen as ſome heretofore haue gotten lighter occaſion then this to leueale at the church of God the darts of their diſpiteful minde &amp; the flaming firebrands of contention for our moſt reuerende brethren Euſtathius, Siluanus &amp; Theophilus confeſſe the ſame, and withall them ſelues, together with your fatherhoode, to haue bene euer of this fayth, &amp; nowe with free purpoſe to continewe firme in the ſame vnto the laſt houre: that in the faith which was approued of three hundreth &amp; eyghteene Catholick Bishops aſſembled in the city of Nice: which containeth the abſolute and perfect trueth: which ſtoppeth the mouths of hereticks and vtterly ouerthroweth their counterfeit doctrine. Neither came it to paſſe by happ hazarde that ſo great a heape &amp; multitude of bishops met together: for it was the will &amp; prouidence of Almighty God that aſſembled them to the ſuppreſſion of the fury &amp; rage of the heretick Arius. It was with the ſame nūber that bleſſed Abraham ouercame through faithGen. 14. ſo many millions of mē. The which fayth being compriſed in the force &amp; vertue of one ſubſtance, is ſo firme &amp; inuincible a bulwark that it foyleth all the ſleights &amp; crafty inuention of the Arian hereſie. And although the curſed &amp; abominable Arians cauſed all bishops from euery where to

aſſemble at Ariminum, to the ende that eyther through perſvvaſion or rather (to tell the trueth) by the commaundement of the Emperour, that vvhich vvas the principall point of the creede might by them be blotted out, or at leaſt vviſe levvdly peruerted: yet for all their ſpitefull deuiſes, they preuailed not. For all the Bishops in maner vvhich mett at Ariminum, and vvere eitherThe councel of Ariminū recanteth &amp; accurſeth Arius. allured by their fradulent enticements, or compelled by force, and ſo fell at that time from the faith: novv hauing remembred them ſelues better, accurſed the faith ſett forth by the Bishops at Ariminum: ratified by ſubſcription the Catholick &amp; Apoſtolick faith confirmed by the bishops of the Nicene councell, and now they communicate together vvith vs: once I ſay againe all they preſently are earneſt &amp; zealouſly bent againſt the hereticall opinion of Arius and his followers. The vvhich thing vvhen your legats had throughly examined &amp; deepely vveyed vvith them ſelues, they freely ſubſcribed in your names, &amp; accurſed Arius together vvith the canons concluded vpon at Ariminum contrary vnto the Nicene faith, vnto the vvhich ſometimes you your ſelues being trained through fraude &amp; vviles haue by othe ſubſcribed. VVherfore it ſeemed good vnto vs to write vnto your louing brotherhoode &amp; to aſiſt you in ſuch reaſonable requeſts: eſpecially ſeing we are geuē to vnderſtād by the proteſtatiō of your legats that the bishops of the caſt are novv come into the right vvay &amp; embrace one faith together with the Catholick Bishops of the vveſt. Neither vvould vve haue you ignorant that they vvho ſometime vvere craftely &amp; violently dravven from the trueth to eſtablish the blaſphemous decrees againſt the maieſtie of the ſonne of God at the councell of Ariminum: novve haue vvholly &amp; vnfainedly condemned the ſame, &amp; with vniforme conſent of them all to haue embraced the Nicene creede. Moreouer you haue to certifie all men by your letters, that they vvhich heretofore vnvvittingly ſvvarued from the faith &amp; now wander in the waſt deſert &amp; darke miſte of hereſie may at length returne vnto the bright &amp; celeſtiall beames of chriſtian liberty shining in the vvorlde to the comfort of their ſoules. All vvhich let them knovve for ſuertie that if they vvill not after this damnable councell purge them ſelues &amp; vomit out the deadly poiſon of this deteſtable doctrine: if they will not remoue from among them all the blaſphemies of Arius: if they wil not abhorre him from the hart roote &amp; accurſe him for euer: that they them ſelues are cutt of &amp; excōmunicated from the communion of the faithfull as aliens &amp; forayners, (for the Churche norisheth no baſtards) together with Arius &amp; his diſciples, &amp; all ſuch vipers broode as the Sabellians, Patropaſſians &amp; all other hereticall opinions whatſoeuer. God haue you in his tuition welbeloued brethren.
                        
                     
                      
                        The legats of Euſtathius cōpany hauing gotten theſe letters tooke their iourney into Sicilia: where after that

When they had alſo procured theſe biſhops letters toutching the ſame matter together wt the epiſtle of Liberius vnto y• eaſt churches, ſtraight way they returne home. The eaſterne biſhops after the receat of Liberius epiſtle, ſent legats into euery city of them which defended the fayth of one ſubſtance, requeſting them with one conſent to aſſemble at Tarſus in Cilicia: partly for to ratifie the Nicene creede, and partly for to remoue all ſchiſme and contention raiſed in the Church ſince that time. The which peraduenture had bene done, if that Eudoxius the Arian Biſhop who was in great fauor with the Emperour had not withſtoode it: who alſo for the ſummoning therof was wonderfully incenſed, ſo that afterwards he diuerſly vexed them. Sabinus alſo in his booke intitled the collection of the councells, reporteth in like ſorte that the Macedonians communicated by their legats with Liberius, and ratified the Nicene Creede.

                        How Eunomius the heretick fell from Eudoxius the Arian: how by the procurement of Eudoxius, Athanaſius was faine to ſlie &amp; to hide him ſelfe, ſo that there roſe a great tumult, and to appeaſe the ſame, the Emperour wrote louingly vnto the people of Alexandria, &amp; commaunded that Athanaſius ſhoulde quietly enioy his biſhoprick.
                     
                     ABout that time Eunomius deuided him ſelfe from Eudoxius, &amp; rayſed ſeuerall conuenticles:The one heretick fallen out with the other. becauſe that after he had made longe and tedious ſute vnto Eudoxius in the behalfe of his maiſter Aetius, he woulde not receaue him into the Church. Neither did Eudoxius that of him ſelfe (for he miſliked not at all with the opinion of Aetius, in ſo much that his owne differed not from his) but all the whole faction of Eudoxius abhorred Aetius for one that was of a contrary opinion vnto them. It is knowen very well that this was the cauſe which moued Eunomius
                        
to diſagree and vary from Eudoxius, for we learned of a trueth theſe thinges to haue thus fallen out at Conſtantinople. But at Alexandria the writt that was ſent thither by the gouernours, through the procurement of Eudoxius moleſted wonderfully the quiet eſtate of the Church. Athanaſius miſtruſting the heady and raſhe motion of the common people, fearing if any miſchiefe were wrought by them that it woulde be laide to his charge: hid him ſelfe in his fathers priuey cloſſet, the full ſpace of foure moneths. The Emperour hearing that the people was all on an vprore at the departure of Athanaſius, for the loue and longing they did for him, was wonderfully incenſed and ſignified vnto the people of Alexandria by his letters that his pleaſure was that Athanaſius ſhoulde quietly as they wiſhed them ſelues enioy the biſhoprick. by this meanes it came to paſſe that the Church of Alexandria had peace and tranquillity vnto the death of Athanaſius. but howe the Arians poſſeſſed that Church after his death we will hereafter declare.

                        How that after the death of Eudoxius, the Arians choſe Demophilus biſhop of Conſtantinople: the Catholicks choſe Euagrius whome Euſtathius Biſhop of Antioch did conſecrate, but by the commaundement of the Emperour Ʋalens they were both exiled▪ ſo that afterwards the true Chriſtians were wonderfully afflicted. Of the foureſcore prieſtes that were burned in the ſhip, &amp; the great famine that fel in Phrygia.
                     
                     THe Emperour Valens haſtening againe to Antioch left Conſtantinople &amp; comming to Nicomedia in Bithynia, was faine to make there his abode for a while, the cauſe was as followeth. Eudoxius the Arian Biſhop hauing enioyed the biſhoprick of Conſtantinople the ſpace of nyneteene yeares departed this life immediatly after the emperours remouing out of the citie, in the third Conſulſhip of Valentinianus and Valens. Wherefore the Arians placed Demophilus in his rowme. but ſuch as embraced the faith of one ſubſtance, ſuppoſing now they had got fitt opportunity, choſe Euagrius a man of their owne opinion. He was conſecrated biſhop by Euſtathius, who of olde had bene biſhop of Antioch, and then lately had bene by Iouianus called home from exile &amp; at that time by chaunce remained (though in ſecret) at Conſtantinople for to confirme ſuch as were of the faith of one ſubſtance. 
                        Cap. 15. in the greeke. This being done the Arians begonne againe with furious motion to perſecute the faithfull chriſtians, ſo that tydings therof came quickly to the Emperours eares▪ he fearing greatly leſt the ſeditious tumult of the vulgar ſort ſhould ouerthrow the city, ſent out of Nicomedia into Conſtantinople great power of armed ſouldiers: &amp; commaunded withall that both the conſecrator and the conſecrated biſhop ſhoulde be baniſhed one to one place, the other into an other contrey. Wherefore Euſtathius was exiled into Bizya a city of Thracia, &amp; Euagrius was conueyed into an other city. When the world fauored the Arians in this ſort, they ſet vp them ſelues, they crowed inſolently ouer the true chriſtians, they ſcurged, reuiled, impriſoned, mearced they layd vpon them all the greeuous and intollerable burthens they could deuiſe. The true Chriſtians being thus oppreſſed with extreme dealing, went vnto the Emperour, beſought moſt humbly of him, that if not altogether yet at leaſt wiſe he woulde eaſe them of ſome part of their troubles: but where they thought to haue founde fauor, there were they fouly deceaued, inſomuch they hoped to obtaine iuſtice at his hands which was their deadly foe and the cauſe of all their woefull calamity. Cap. 16. in the Greeke. For when as thoſe godly &amp; religious men of the prieſtly order being in number foureſcore and ſent in the name of all the reſt into Nicomedia, (namely as the moſt famous, 
                           Ʋrbanus, Theodorus, and Menedemus) made ſupplication vnto the Emperour, opened vnto him their grief, certified him of the iniuries they ſuſtayned at the hands of the Arians: he although he was then wonderfully incenſed againſt them, yet concealed his diſpleaſure vntill that priuely he had commaunded his Lieuetenant Modeſtus to lay them in hold, and puniſh them with death. The kind of death inſomuch it was newe and ſtraunge, I thinke beſt to paint it forth in paper to the knowledg of the poſteritie in tyme to come. The Lieuetenant fearing greatly leſt if he woulde execute them in the open face of the Citizens, the common people woulde be on an vprore and ſett vpon him: made them beleeue that he would baniſhe them the contreye. They tooke the threats of exile in good part. The Lieuetenant commaunded them to haſten vnto the rode, to goe on borde, and take ſhipping as if they were to be conueyed into foreyne and farre contreyes: yet charged he the maryners, then when as they came into the mayne ſeae they ſhoulde ſett the ſhip afire, ſo that dying

returned home. There roſe by chaunce a mightie Eaſterne winde which draue the ſhip with violence, ſwiftely for to ſulcate the ſeas and continewed ſo longe vntill ſhe arriued at the hauen called Dacidizus: where in the ende together with thoſe godly men ſhe was vtterly conſumed to aſhes▪ Yet the reporte goeth, and rife it is in euery mans mouth that this cruell and horrible act was not longe after vnreuenged. For immediatly all Phrygia was plagued with a ſore and a lamentable famine: ſo that many of the inhabitantes of that countrey were conſtrayned of neceſſitie to flie vnto Conſtantinople and to other prouinces for neceſſarie food. The city of Conſtantinople though it find and relieue an infinite multitude of mē, yet there is great plentie &amp; abundance of all things partly by reaſon that all neceſſaries are caried thither by ſeae, and partly alſo that Euxinus is ſo nighe and conueyeth thither greate ſtore of grayne.

                           Ʋalens weyed not at all this grieuous famine, went forth on his iorney to Antioch: and continewing there purſued with deadly hatred ſuch as deteſted the Arian opinion. He depoſed of theyr churches for no other crime then becauſe they were enemies vnto y• 
                        Arians, all that embraced the faith of one ſubſtance, not onely throughout all the Eaſterne parts of the world: but alſo not ſatisfied with this puniſhemente, tormented them with diuerſe grieuous deuiſes and executed a farre greater number then we ſpake of before, with ſundry kindes of death but ſpecially with drowninge of them in the ſurginge waues of the ſea.

And while the Liuetenant haſtened with greate power of armed ſouldieres vnto the temple, to the ende he might delay the boyling heate of the Emperours ſtomacke which breathed out anger and diſpleaſure: a ſimple woman leadinge a childe in her hande all in haſt brake the raye and thruſt her ſelfe in the throng of armed ſouldiers to paſſe on her voyage. The Liuetenant being moued therewith calleth the woman before him, reaſoneth with her in this ſorte: thou fond and vnfortunat woman, whether runneſt thou ſo raſhly? thither (ſayde ſhe) where others doe haſten. Haſt not thou hearde (ſayth he) that the Liuetenant will execute as many as he finds there? I heard it (ſayd ſhe)Ruſtinus reporteth this ſtorie lib. 2. cap. 5. eccleſ. hiſt. and therefore I goe thither in all the haſt that I may be founde there. But whither (ſayd he) leadeſt thou this childe? that he alſo (ſayd ſhe) may be accompted in the number of Martyrs. When the Liuetenant heard this he coniectured thereafter of the reſt. Thereupon he got him vnto the Emperour, and geueth him to vnderſtand that all from the higheſt vnto the loweſt prepared them ſelues to die in the quarell and in defence of their faith: he aded moreouer that it was verye raſhe and without all reaſon that ſo great a multitude in ſo ſhorte a ſpace ſhoulde ſo ſoddainely be executed, in ſo ſaying he fell a perſwading of the Emperour ſo long vntill that his wordes preuayled, &amp; the Emperour was with reaſon appeaſed.

                        Of Ammon the monke and diuerſe religious men inhabiting the deſert.
                     
                     IN ſo muche that we haue made mention of the monaſteries in Aegypt, there is no cauſe to the contrarye but that we maye diſcourſe ſomewhat thereof. The places commonly called religious houſes, though peraduenture the originall of them was many yeares before: yet were they very much augmented &amp; amplified by Ammon an holy man. Who though in the prime of his floriſhingAmmon a Monke yet maried. youth he diſdained of wedlock: yet at the entreaty and earneſt requeſt of his deare friendes which exhorted him not to inuey ſo bitterly againſt mariadge but to take a wife, he yelded vnto thē &amp; was maried. Immediatly he led the newe maried ſpouſe by the hand out of the parlour, with the wōted pompe &amp; ſollemnity, into the wedding &amp; ved chamber: whē their friends were gone he tooke the newe teſtament in his hand: read the epiſtle of Saynct Paul vnto the Corinthiās: expounded vnto his wife out of the Apoſtle ſuch doctrine as concerned wedlock: interlaced many other exhortations borowed out of other wryters: layd before her the diſcōmodities of mariadge howe heuye a caſe was the company of man &amp; wife together, what bitter panges &amp; griping griefs women great with child haue at the deliuerance of their burthen. He added moreouer vnto theſe the care &amp; ſorow incident to the education &amp; bringing vp of childrē: laſt of all he rehearſed the vertues &amp; cōmodities annexed vnto virginitie: howe the pure life, the vndefiled &amp; vnſtaunched veſſell was free frō all the aforſayd annoyance &amp; cumbrances: &amp; that virginitie commended vs highly &amp; preſented vs next vnto God. When he had vſed theſe &amp; the like reaſons with his wife as yet being a virgine: they preuailed ſo much yt ſhe was perſwaded before their cōming together to forget the wonted familiarity of man &amp; wife. wherefore both they hauing cōcluded among themſelues toutching the premiſſes, got thē immediatly vnto the mounte Nitria, where for a ſeaſon they led a monaſticall life in a blind cottage, without reſpect of ſex, not thinkinge either on man or wife, for they were as the Apoſtle ſayth, one body in Chriſt. In a while after the new maried ſpouſe, the vndefiled virgine reaſoneth thus wt 
                        Ammon. It becometh not you in ſo much you haue vowed tēperancie and chaſtity to haue a woman in your ſight in ſo narrowe and ſtraict a rowine. Wherefore if you thinke my aduiſe any thing to yt furtherance of cōtinency &amp; vertuous life, let vs both ſeuerally lead ſolitary and monaſticall liues. Thus they agreed amonge themſelues, they parted a ſunder one from the other and ſo ſpent out their dayes, bothe abſtained from wine and oyle, their foode was drie breade, they faſted ſomtimes one whole day, ſomtimes two, ſome other times more. Antonie who liued in thoſe dayesAntonie. (as Athanaſius biſhop of Alexādria wryteth in his life) ſawe the ſoule of Ammon after his deſeaſe caried vp of the Angells into heauen. Wherefore many became earneſt and zealous followers of Ammons trade of life: ſo that y• mount Nitria and Scitis were full of religious mē, whoſe liues ſeuerally to penne would require a peculier volume. But in ſo much there were of thē many ſinguler &amp; rare men, renowmed for their monaſticall diſcipline and partly alſo for their Apoſtolicke trade of life, famous alſo for many notable acts and ſage ſentences worthy of immortall memory: It ſhall not be amiſſe in my opiniō to cut out &amp; here lay downe diuers things, which may ſeeme cōmodious for the profit of y• ſtudious readers. The report goeth that Ammon neuer beheld his naked body: &amp; yt he was wōt to ſay: that it was a shamefull thing in a monk to delight himſelfe with the ſight of his bare skinne. Of y• ſame man it is reported y• goinge about by chaunce to paſſe ouer a riuer, and very loth to ſhift himſelfe, to haue prayed vnto God yt he might not be foyled neither hindred of hisDidymus. enterpriſe: an Angell to haue come &amp; cōueyed him ouer vnto y• further bank.

Arſenius of the ſame vocation was neuer wont to excommunicat y• yonger ſort whē they had offended, but ſuch as profited very much in ye monaſticall diſcipline. his reaſon was this: A yōg man whē he is chaſticed (ſayth he) with excommunicatiō, forthwith he will diſdaine &amp; take the matter in a ſnuffe: but he that profiteth will quickly perceaue the griefe &amp; be ſore pricked with punishment. Pior

other that aſked of him the like, he gaue this anſwere: My behauiour is as you ſee, leſt the mind by pamperinge of the carkaſſe, be pufte vp vvith fleshelye pleaſure. Iſidorus
                         affirmed that forIſidorus. the ſpace of fortie yeares, his minde had not conſented to ſinne, that he had neuer yelded to fleſhly luſt, or furiouſe anger. Pambo a ſimple and an vnlearned man, came vnto his friende for toPambo. learne a Pſalme, and hearinge the firſte verſe of the thirtieth and eyght Pſalme, which is thus reade: I ſayde I vvill take heede vnto my vvayes, that I offende not in my tongue, woulde notPſal. 38. heare the ſeconde, but wente awaye ſayinge: This one verſe is inoughe for me if I learne it as I oughte to doe. And when as his teacher blamed him, for abſentinge himſelfe wholle ſix monethes, he anſwered for himſelfe, that as yet he had not well learned the firſte verſe. Many yeares after that, when as one of his acquayntance demaunded of him, whether he had learned the verſe: ſayde againe: that in nyneteene yeares he had ſcarſe learned in life to fulfill that one lyne. The ſame man when as one deliuered him moneye to the reliefe of the poore, and ſayd tell the ſumme: made anſwere: vve neede no counters but a ſound mynde and a ſetled conſcience. The reporte goeth that at the requeſte of Athanaſius the Biſhop he came from the deſerte into Alexandria, and ſeing there a certaine light woman, ſumpteouſly attyred and gorgeouſly arayed to feede the eyes of fonde people, to haue burſt out into teares. And beinge demaunded what the cauſe was and wherefore he wept, to haue anſwered, that two things moued him to lamente very ſore. One was that he ſawe the gaye and painted woman to runne headlonge into deſtruction: the other was that he was not ſo carefull and earneſt in pleaſinge of God, as ſhe buſied to bayte &amp; entrappe men, already burthened with ſinne and iniquitie. An other ſayd: the monke that liued

Amonge the aforeſayde religious men of that time there were two of equall fame, and renowne, of like piety and vertue, of one name &amp; appellation, either was called Macarius, the one of the vpper parte of Aegypt, the other of Alexandria it ſelfe: bothe floriſhed2.

He mingled auſtere ſeueritie, with temperate reuerence and grauitie towardes them which reaſoned or dealt with him. The Alexandrian Macarius
                         although in all other thinges he fully reſembled him, yet in this one point was he farre from his diſpoſition, for he behaued him ſelfe cheerefull and pleaſaunt towardes all them that talked with him, ſo that with his curteous ciuilitie, and comely mirth he allured many yonge men vnto the monaſticall trade of liuinge. Euagrius was a diſciple of theyrs, who at the firſt was a Philoſopher in word, but afterwardes in dedeEuagrius. and trueth it ſelfe. This mā was firſt made deacon at Cōſtantinople by Gregorie Naziāzen: thence together with him he went into Aegipt and there had conference with the aforeſayd religious men: he became an earneſt follower of theyr trade of life, and wrought as many miracles as bothe the Macariuſes before him. He wrote learned bookes, one intitled: the monke, or of that trade of life which conſiſteth of practiſe, an other called Gnoſticus of ſcience or knowledge, deuided into fiftie chapiters, a third Antirreticus, that is a confutation collected out of holye Scripture againſt the temptation of Deuells, deuided into eyght partes, reſemblinge very fitly the number of the eight deuiſes or imaginations of mās mind. moreouer he wrote ſix hundreth problemes to the vnderſtanding of things to come. Unto theſe are added two bookes inverſe, one vnto the mōks inhabiting the monaſteries &amp; publicke aſſemblies: the other vnto him that leadeth a virgine life, what ſinguler books theſe are, I referr it vnto y• iudgemēt of the reader.

Of which number one ſayde that a drie and ſpare kinde of diette, at all tymes preciſely kept, (mingling brotherly charitie and loue vvithall) woulde quickly purge mans minde, of all perturbation and fonde humor of humane and earthly affection.

Furthermore vvhen I came vnto the holie father Macarius, about noone tyme in the heate of the daye, beynge ſore athurſt, and requeſted of him a draught of vvater: be content (ſayeth he) vvith the shade, for manie that trauayle on earth, and manie that trafficke by ſea, haue not that.

The lyght of the Sunne (ſayeth he) vvanteth forme and fygure, yet by reaſon of the vvindovves and chinkes through the vvhich it pearceth, it is ſayde to haue a figure. It is reported of him, that vnto an other Monke he ſayde thus: I doe therefore cutte of all occaſion and baytes of fleshly pleaſure, to the ende I may expell euery humour that tendeth to heate of anger. I am veryly perſvvaded that this heate of Anger contendeth for pleaſure, diſquieteth the quiete diſpoſition of my minde, and bereaueth my vnderſtandinge of her force.

The office of Fortitude is firmely to perſiſt in the trueth, and though therefore thou ſuffer grieuous torment, yet it is thy part neuer to yeelde vnto falſehoode. The office of Temperance is to receaue ſeedes of the higheſt and ſupreme husbandman, and to put him by, that poppeth in any other ſeede.

                        Of the religious men that were exiled, and howe that God wrought miracles by them, and drewe all men vnto him.
                     
                     WHen the Emperour Valens had proclaimed againſt all them that maintayned the faith of One ſubſtance throughout Alexandria and all Aegypt, that they ſhould looke for no other then fire and fagott, and deadly foes: all was deſtroyed, whileſt that ſome were brought before the barre, ſome clapt in priſon, ſome others diuerſly tormented, for they vexed thē wt ſundry puniſhments which lead a peaceable &amp; quiet life. When theſe things were practiſed at Alexandria accordinge vnto Lucius his pleaſure, when that Euzoius alſo was come backe from Antioche, the captaine with great power together with the companie of Lucius the Arian (who was nothing behinde, but without all pitie and compaſſion vexed theſe holy men farre more grieuous then the ſouldiers did) marched forwards towards the Monaſteries of Aegypt. When they came to the place, they founde the men after their wonted maner powringe out of prayers vnto God, curing of diſeaſes, caſting out of deuells. Theſe men making no accompt of miracles, would not ſuffer them in their accuſtomed places to accompliſhe their vſuall lyturgie, but chaſed them away. Neither were they content with this, but they proceeded forwardes in the raginge furie of their minde, and ſet vpon them with the heady and raſhe troope of ſouldiers. This, Ruſſinus reporteth him ſelfe to haue ſeene, and to haue bene partaker with them of the ſame calamitie. Furthermore the things ſpecified in the Apoſtle, ſemed in them to be fulfilled anew. For many of thē were

ſett at nought, ſcurged, ſpoyled of their rayment, fettered in priſon, cruſhed with ſtones, beheaded with bloody ſwords, ſhut vp in the deſert, couered with ſheepe &amp; goats ſkinnes, deſtitute of ayde &amp; ſuccour, grieuouſly afflicted, wōderfully troubled wt aduerſity, whome y• world was not worthy to enioy, neither y• earth to beare ſo holy a burthē: many wādred in deſerts &amp; daungerous waies, they hid thē ſelues in mountaines, in denns, in caues, &amp; hollow rocks. Theſe afflictions they ſuffred for their faith, for their works, for their gift of healing y• which God miraculouſly wrought by them. Yet as we haue to cōiecture, it pleaſed y• prouidēce of almighty God, that they ſhould endure ſuch great calamittes, to y• end their miſerie might be a medicine to reduce other vnto y• health of their ſoules, purchaſed by God him ſelfe, y• end proued y• the premiſſes were no leſſe. for after that theſe notable men through their inuincible pacience &amp; ſufferāce had ouercome theſe ſundry &amp; manifold torments, Lucius being deceaued of his purpoſe, perſwaded y• captaine to exile the fathers &amp; ringleaders of theſe religious mē, by name Macarius y•

                        Alexādriā. Theſe men were baniſhed into an iſle where there was not a Chriſtiā. In this Iſle there was an Idoll groue &amp; a prieſt, whome all y• inhabitāts worſhipped for their god. whē theſe holy mē came thither all y• deuels y• were conuerſant there, began to trēble for feare. At y• time ſuch a miracle as followeth is ſayd to haue bene wrought. The prieſts doughter was ſodainly poſſeſſed of a deuell, ſhe raged out of meaſure, &amp; kept a foule ſturre, neither could her furie any kinde of way he mitigated, but ſhe exclaimed &amp; cryed out againſt theſe godly men, ſaying: Why came ye hither to chace vs away? then the holy men reuealed &amp; made manifeſt vnto all thoſe inhabitants y• gift which God had beſtowed vpon them. For they caſt y• deuell out of y• maide, they deliuer her ſafe &amp; ſound vnto her parents, &amp;A miracle. cōuert both prieſt &amp; people vnto y• Chriſtian faith. Immediatly they chaunged their religion, and were baptized, and willingly embraced the ſeruice of almightie God. Wherefore thoſe holy men beīg grieuouſly perſecuted for y• faith of One ſubſtāce, were proued, &amp; ſufficiētly tried thē ſelues, miniſtred both health and ſaluation vnto others, and alſo cōfirmed that holie and reuerende faith.

                     ABout that time God rayſed in the world an other rare &amp; ſingular man, by whoſe meanes heDidymus. made the faith to floriſhe. for Didymus a notable mā, excelling in all kind of literature, was famous at that time. who being a yong man, &amp; entring into the principles of learning, was wonderfully plagued wt ſore eyes ſo long, vntill y• at length he was bereaued of all his ſight. But God in ſteede of the outward ſenſe of the eye, endued him of his goodnes with rare gifts &amp; vnderſtanding of the minde. For looke what he could not attaine vnto by the eye, that got he by the eare. Becauſe that of a child he was of great towardnes, ſharpe witted, and ſingular capacitie, he farre excelled all the famous witts of his time. For he was quickly ſeene in all the preceptes of grammar: Rhetoricke he runne ouer ſooner then the other: it was a wonder to ſee in how ſhort a ſpace he profited greatly in philoſophie: firſt he learned Logike, next Arithmetike, then Muſicke, afterwardes the reſte of the liberall artes, the which he ſo applyed, that he was able to encounter with them, who by the helpe of their eye ſight had profitted very much therein. He was ſo perfect in the old and newe teſtament, that he made therevpon many cōmentaries. He publiſhed three books of the Trinitie. He interpreted the bookes of Origen intituled Of principall beginnings, left commentaries thereof, cōmended the bookes highly, condemned for fooles ſuch as not vnderſtanding what he wrote, found fault with the works, &amp; accuſed the writer. Wherefore if any be deſirous to knowe y• profound ſkill &amp; great ſtudy of Didymus, let him peruſe his works, &amp; there he ſhalbe fully perſwaded. The report goeth, that Antonie a good while agoe in the time of the Emperour Valens comming out of the deſert, becauſe of the Arians, into the citie of Alexandria, had conference with this Didymus, and vnderſtandinge of his great ſkill and knowledge, he ſayde vnto him: Let it not grieue thee at all (ô Didymus) y• thou art bereaued of the corporall eyes &amp; carnall ſight, for though thou want ſuch eyes as cōmonly are geuen to flies &amp; gnatts for ſafetie, yet haſt thou greatly to reioyce, that the eyes wherwith the Angells do behold, wherwith God him ſelfe is ſeene, wherwith the cleare ſhining of the celeſtiall godhead is cōprehended, are not dygged out of thy head. Theſe, as they ſay, were the wordes of Antonie vnto Didymus. At that time Didymus was a great patron and defender of the true faith againſt the Arians: he withſtoode them, he diſſolued their captious fallacies, and confuted their lewde and falſe arguments.

                        Of Baſilius biſhop of Caeſarea in Cappadocia, and GregorieCap. 26. in the greeke. byſhop of Nazianzum.
                     
                     EUen as Didymus by the appointment of God him ſelfe withſtoode the Arians at Alexandria, ſo in other cities did Baſilius of Caeſarea, &amp; Gregorie of Nazianzū, of whome now fit opportunitie is miniſtred to diſcourſe. Although the fame of them is ryfe in euery mans mouth, and the great profitt that riſeth by their workes, is of greate force to their prayſe and commendation: yet ſeeinge that then the Chriſtian faith was greately furthered by them as by two greate lightes, it is our parte to ſay ſomewhat of them. If in caſe that any will compare Baſilius with Gregorie, and with longe diſcourſe conferre the life and learninge of the one with the other, it will be longe ere he ſhalbe able to diſcerne whether to preferre of them both. They were both equally matched for right trade of life, for both kinde of knowledge, diuine and prophane. Beynge yonge men in the floure of their youth, they hearde at Athens the famous Rhetoricians, Hymerius and Proaereſius: afterwardes at Antioche in Syria, they frequented the ſchoole of Libanius, in the ende they excelled in Rhetoricke. When they were thought worthie men to deliuer vnto the worlde the preceptes of philoſophie, and were entreated of many to take that function vpon them: when as alſo others perſwaded with them to become Orators: they ſett nought by both thoſe trades, they deſpiſed the maner a

                        d guiſe of Rhetoricians, and gaue them ſelues vnto ſolitary and monaſticall life. Wherefore as ſoone as they had ſufficiently profited in philoſophie, vnder a certaine reader, who then was a profeſſor at Antioche: they prouided for thē ſelues the cōmentaries of Origen (who then was famous throughout the worlde) and learned out of them to expounde and interprete the holy and ſacred ſcripture. beynge exerciſed in them, they valiantly encountred with the Arians. And when as the Arians alleaged out of Origen for the confirmation of their hereticall opinion, they refuted their ignorance: and ſhewed by plaine demonſtrations that they vnderſtoode not the minde and meaning of Origen. For Eunomius a fauourer of that ſect, and as many Arians as were of greateſt reputation, and accompted the profoundeſt clerkes in reſpect of all the reſt: when they diſputed with Gregorie and Baſil, proued them ſelues ſtarke fooles, and vnlearned perſons. Baſil firſt of all being ordained Deacon of Meletius biſhop of Antioche, afterwardsBaſil biſhop of Caeſarea in Cappadocia. Gregotius firſt biſhop of Nazianzum, afterwards of Cōſtantinople. biſhop of Caeſarea in Cappadocia, where he was borne: gaue him ſelfe wholly to the furtherance and profit of the churche of God. When he feared greately leſt the newe deuiſe of Arius brayne would creepe throughout the prouinces of Pontus, he got him into thoſe parts in all the haſt, and ordained there the exerciſe of monaſticall life, inſtructed men in his opinion, and confirmed the waueringe minde of weakelinges in the faith. Gregorie alſo being made biſhop of Nazianzum a meane citie of Cappadocia, (wherof his father had bene biſhop before him) did y• like vnto Baſils doings. As he paſſed throughout yt cities, he cōfirmed y• faynt &amp; weake in the faith: by oft viſiting of Conſtantinople, he ſetled with his graue leſſons and great learning the minds of all them that embraced the faith of One ſubſtance. Wherefore in a ſhort while after, he was by the voyces and conſent of many biſhops, choſen biſhop of Conſtantinople. When the fame of them both was

He was no ſoonerBaſil reaſoneth with the Arian preſident of Antioche. come, but the Emperour charged he ſhould be brought before the tribunall ſeate of the preſident. When the Preſident demaunded of him, why and wherefore he liked no better of the Emperours religion? Baſil vnfaynedly and freely ſpake his minde of the Emperours opinion, yet highly cō
                        mended the faith of One ſubſtance. When the Preſident threatned him wt preſent death: I would to God (ſayth Baſil) it woulde fall out ſo well of my ſide, that I might leaue this carcaſſe of mine in the quarell of Chriſt, in the defence of my head and captaine. Whē the Preſident aduiſed him, againe and againe to remember him ſelfe better, the report goeth that Baſil ſayde vnto him. As I am today, ſo ſhalt thou find me tomorow, but I pray God thou alter not thy minde. Then lay Baſil in priſon that whole daye. In a whyle after the Emperour Valens ſonne, by name Galates, of youthly and tender yeares, fell to ſo daungerous a diſeaſe that the phiſicions gaue him vp, and deſpaired of his recouery, whoſe mother Dominica the Empreſſe tolde her huſband the Emperour, that the ſame nyght ſhe was wonderfully diſquieted in hir ſleepe with vgleſome ſhapes, &amp; dreadfull viſions of deuells and wicked ſpirites: that the child was viſited with ſickneſſe, becauſe of the cōtumelie and reproche he had done vnto Baſil the biſhop. The Emperour marking diligently the

words of his wife, muzed a while, &amp; pondered them wt him ſelfe, at length reſolued him ſelfe what was to be done, ſent for Baſil, and becauſe he would know y• trueth, reaſoned thus with him: If thy faith and opinion be true, pray that my ſonne die not of this diſeaſe. Then Baſil anſwered, If thouThe cōferēce of Baſil and the Arian Emperour Valens. wilt promiſe mee to beleue as I doe, and if thou wilt bringe the churche vnto vnitie and concord, thy childe no doubt ſhall lyue. When the Emperour woulde not agree vnto this, let God (ſayeth Baſil) deale with the childe as pleaſeth him. Immediatly after this conference Baſil was ſette at libertie, and forthwith the child dyed. Thus much haue we runne ouer of both theſe mens doings. They both left behinde them vnto the poſteritie many notable bookes, wherof Ruffinus reporteth him ſelfe to haue tranſlated ſome into the Latine tongue. Baſil had two brethren Peter and Gregorie. Peter lead the ſolitarie life, after the example of Baſil: Gregorie was a teacher, and finiſhed after the deſeaſe of his brother, the Cōmentaries which Baſil had left vnperfect, vpon the Six dayes vvorks. The ſame Gregorie preached at Conſtantinople a funerall ſermon vpon the death of Meletius biſhop of Antioch. There are extant many other notable orations and ſermons of his.

                     INſomuch that many are deceaued, partly becauſe of the name, and partly becauſe of the works attributed vnto Gregorie: we haue to learne that there was an other Gregorie borne in Neocaeſarea a citie of Pontus, who was the diſciple of Origen, and farre more auncient then the former men we ſpake of euen now. This Gregorie is much ſpoken of not onely at Athens, and at Berytus, but throughout Pontus, and in maner throughout the whole world. As ſoone as he had left the famous ſchoole of Athens, he gaue him ſelfe at Berytus vnto the ſtudy of the ciuill lawes: hearinge there that Origen profeſſed diuinitie at Caeſarea, got him thither in all the haſt. When he had bene the auditor of the heauenly doctrine of holy ſcripture, made no accōpt of the Romaine lawes, butGregorie. b. of Neocaeſarea. Gregorie. b. of Nazianzū Gregorie the brother of Baſil.

Beinge a laye man he wrought many miracles, he cured the ſicke, he chaſed deuells away by his epiſtles, he conuerted the gentils and Ethnicks vnto the faith, not only with words, but wt deedes of far greater force. Pāphilus Martyr made mention of him in his bookes written in the defence of Origen, where the oration of Gregorie in the praiſe of Origen is layd downe in writing. To be ſhort, there were foure Gregories: firſt this auncient father, the diſciple ſome times of Origen, next Gregorie Nazianzene, thirdly Gregorie the brother of Baſil, and the fourth of Alexandria, whome the Arians after the exile of Athanaſius, choſe to their biſhop. Thus much of theſe men.

                        The originall of the Nouatian hereticks, and how that as many of them as inhabited Phrygia, celebrated the feaſt of Eaſter after the Iewiſhe maner.
                     
                     ABout that time the Nouatians inhabiting Phrygia, chaunged the dayes appoynted by the councell of Nice, for the celebration of Eaſter, but howe that came to paſſe I will declare, if that firſt I lay downe the cauſe &amp; originall why ſo ſeuere a canon of the Nouatian church preuailed ſo much with the Phrygian and Paphlagonian nations. Nouatus the prieſt ſeuered him ſelfe from the church of Rome, becauſe y• 
                        Cornelius the biſhop receaued into the communion after repentance the faithfull that fell from the church, &amp; ſacrificed vnto Idols in the perſecution vnder Decius the Emperour. When he had deuided him ſelfe from y• church for the aforeſayd cauſe, firſt he was made biſhop of ſuch biſhops as were of his opinion: next he wrote epiſtles vnto all churches euery where, that they ſhould not receaue as meete partakers of the holy myſteries, ſuch as had ſacrificed vnto Idolls, but exhort them vnto repentance, referring y• forgeuenes and remiſſion vnto God, who is of power and authority ſufficient to remit ſinne: when the letters were brought into euery prouince, euery one iudged thereof as pleaſed him beſt. Becauſe Nouatus had ſignified that ſuch as after baptiſme committed a ſinne vnto death, were not afterwards to be admitted vnto the communion: the publiſhing of that canon ſeemed vnto ſome toe ſeuere, vnto others but right &amp; reaſon, auailable alſo for the direction of godly life. Whē this controuerſie was toſſed toe and fro, the letters of Cornelius were ſent abroade, ſignifying that there remained hope of pardon for ſuch as had ſinned after baptiſme. They both wrote contrary letters, and cōueyed them vnto the churches abroade. And whileſt that both went about to confirme his opinion with teſtimonies of holy

ſcripture, euery man (as the maner is) looke where affection lead him, there he addicted him ſelfe. For ſuch as were geuen to ſinne, tooke occaſion by the libertie and fauoure that was graunted them, went forewardes headlonge into euery ſhamefull crime. The Phrygians are a nation farreThe Phrygians. Scythians. Thracians. Paphlagonians. more temperate and modeſt then others, for they ſweare very ſeldome. The Scythians and Thracians are hotter &amp; more prone vnto anger. For they that are nearer vnto the riſing of the ſunne, are ſet more vpon luſt &amp; concupiſcence. The Paphlagonians &amp; Phrygians are inclined to nere nother of theſe perturbations. For at this daye they vſe no running at tilte, no ſuch warlike exerciſe, neither doe they vſe to paſtime them ſelues with ſpectacles and ſtage playes. Wherefore theſe kind of men in myne opinion, draw neereſt vnto the drift &amp; diſpoſition of Nouatus letters. Adulterie is counted among them for a deteſtable and horrible ſinne. It is well knowen that the Phrygian andAdulte

                        Paphlagonian trade of lyfe is farre modeſter, and more chaſt and continent, then any other hereticall ſect whatſoeuer. I coniecture that they ſhott at the ſame modeſt trade of lyfe, which inhabited the weſt parts of the worlde, and leaned to Nouatus opinion. Nouatus him ſelfe though he varyed from the church of Rome, by reaſon of a certaine ſeuere trade of liuing: yet altered not he the tyme appointed for the celebration of Eaſter. For he alwayes obſerued the cuſtome of the Weſt churches▪ and celebrated it as they did. For ſuch as lyue there, ſince they were Chriſtians kept alwayes that feaſt after the Equinoctiallſpringe. And though Nouatus him ſelfe was putt to death in the perſecution vnder 
                           Ʋalerianus: yet ſuch as in Phrygia are ſo called of him, for all they are fallen from the faith of the Catholicke churche, were licenced to become partakers of his communion, at what time they altered the celebration of Eaſter day. For in the village Pazum, where the ſprings of the floode Sangarius are founde▪ there was a Councell ſummoned of fewe, and theA Councell o

This haue we learned of an olde man who was a prieſts ſonne, and preſent at the Councell with his father: whereat Agelius the Nouatian byſhop of Conſtantinople was not, neyther Maximus of Nice, neither the Nouatian biſhop of Nicomedia, neyther the biſhop of Cotuaium, who was of the ſame opinion with the reſt, for theſe were they that chiefely layde downe the canons of the Nouatian churches. Theſe things were of olde in this ſort.

Vrſinus Deacon of that church, in the vacancie of the ſeae, made ſute for him ſelfe agaynſt Damaſus toVrſinus a Deacō of the churche of Rome, aſpired vnto the biſhopricke. be choſen biſhop. Who ſeeing that Damaſus was preferred, and him ſelfe put backe, ſeeinge alſo that all his canuaſſe was to no purpoſe: fell from the church to rayſinge of priuate and particular conuenticles, and perſwaded certaine baſe and obſcure biſhops to conſecrate him biſhop. Wherfore they created him not in the open church, but in an odde corner of the cathedrall church, called Sicona. This being done, the people was all on an vprore. the tumult was not toutchinge y• faith, or hereſie, but whether of them both by ryght ſhould be biſhop. The heat of thronging multitudes was ſo grieuous, and the contention ſo greate, that it coſt many their liues. For which ſchiſme and rebellion many both of the laytie and cleargie were grieuouſly tormented by the cōmaundement of Maximmus the gouernour, and ſo was Vrſinus foyled, &amp; the enterpriſes of his factiō ſuppreſſed.

                        After the death of Auxentius the Arian byſhop of Mediolanum, when there roſe a great ſchiſme about the election of a biſhop, the which Ambroſe Liuetenant of that prouince ſuppreſſed, he him ſelfe by the voyce of all that were preſent, and by the conſent of the Emperour Ʋalentinianus was choſen Byſhop.
                     
                     
                        ABout that time an other ſtraunge act fell out at Mediolanum. When Auxentius, whome y•

The tumult beinge rayſed, Ambroſe Liuetenant of the citie, who alſo was a Conſull, fearing greatly leſt that ſchiſme woulde breéde miſchiefe in y• citie, came purpoſely into the church for to appeaſe the ſedition. After that his preſence had preuayled very much with the people, after that he had geuen them many notable exhortations, after he had mitigated the rage of the heady and raſhe multitude: all of a ſodayne with one voyce andS. Ambroſe was choſen byſhop of Millayne an. Dom. 378. with one mouth nominated Ambroſe to their byſhop. For in ſo doinge there was hope that all woulde be reconciled, and that all woulde embrace one faith and opinion. The biſhops that were preſent, thought veryly that the vniforme voyce of the people, was the voyce of God him ſelfe. Wherefore without any further deliberation they take Ambroſe, and baptize him (for he was a Catechumeniſt) and ſtall him biſhop. But when Ambroſe came willingly to the baptiſme, yet denyed vtterly he would be biſhop, they make the Emperour Valentinianus priuie to their doings. He wonderinge at the conſent and agreement of the people, ſuppoſed that which was done, to be the worke of God him ſelfe, and ſignified vnto the biſhops that they ſhoulde obey the will of God, who commaunded they ſhoulde create him biſhop, that God rather then men preferred him vnto this dignitie. When that Ambroſe was thus choſen biſhop, the citizens of Millayne, who aforetime were at diſcord among them ſelues, thenceforth embraced peace and vnitie.

                        Of the death of Ʋalentinianus the Emperour.
                     
                     AFter the aforeſayde ſturre was ended, when the Sarmatians aſſaulted the Romaine dominions, the Emperour rayſed great power, and made expedition againſt them. The Barbarians vnderſtanding of this, and foreſeeing their owne weakenes, that they were not able to encounter with ſo great a power, ſent embaſſadours vnto the Emperour, crauinge of him that he would ioyne with them in league, &amp; eſtabliſhe peace betwene them. As ſoone as the embaſſadours had preſented them ſelues before him, and ſeeynge that they were but abiects and raſkalls, demaunded of them, what be the reſt of the Sarmatians ſuch men as you are? When the Embaſſadours had anſwered: yea O Emperour, thou ſeeſt the chiefeſt of the Sarmatians before thee, 
                           Ʋalentinianus was wonderfully incenſed againſt them, and brake out into vehement language: that the Empire of Rome had yll lucke to fall into his handes, vnder whoſe raygne ſo beggerly and ſo abiect a kinde of Barbarians coulde not quiete and content them ſelues with ſafetie within their owne boundes, but they muſte take armour, rebell agaynſte the Romaine Empire, and ſo boldely proclayme open warre. He ſtrayned him ſelfe ſo muche in exclayminge agaynſte them, that he opened euery vayne in his bodie, and brake the arteries aſunder. whereof there guſhed out ſuch a ſtreame of bloode, ſo that he dyed in the Caſtell commonly called Bergitium, in the thirde Conſulſhippe of Gratianus, together with Ecoetius the ſixtienth of Nouember. He lyuedValētinianus dyed Anno Dom. 380. foure and fiftie yeares, and raygned thirteene. The ſixt daye after the deſeaſe of Valentinianus, the ſouldiers of Italie proclaymed Emperour 
                           Ʋalentinianus the yonger, ſo called after his fathers name, who was of very tender yeares, at Aconicum a citie in Italie. The reſt of the Emperours vnderſtāding of this, tooke the matter very grieuouſly, not becauſe Valentinianus, who was y• ones brother, the others brothers ſonne, was choſen Emperour, but becauſe he was appointed without their conſent, vnto whome it belonged to create him Emperour. But both gaue their cōſents that he ſhoulde be Emperour, and thus was Valentinianus the yonger ſett in the emperiall ſeate of his father. We haue to learne that this 
                           Ʋalentinianus was gott vpon Iustina, whome his father maryed for all that Seuera his firſte wyfe was alyue, and that for this cauſe. Iustus the father of Iustina, who a good while agoe in the raigne of Constantius the Emperour, was Liuetenant of Picenum, ſawe in his ſleepe that his right ſide was deliuered of the emperiall purple robe. When that he awoke, he tolde his dreame to ſo many, that at length it came to the Emperour Conſtantius eare. He thereby was geuen to coniecture, that there ſhoulde one be borne of Iustus, which ſhoulde be Emperour, and therefore he ſent from him that ſhoulde diſpatche Iustus out of the waye. Wherefore Iuſtina nowe bereaued of her father, contineweth a virgine. In proceſſe of time ſhe became acquainted with Seuera the Empreſſe, and had often conference with her. When that

there grewe greate familiaritie betweene them, they vſed both one hath for to bayne them ſelues, Seuera ſeeyng the beautie of this virgine as ſhe bayned her ſelfe, was wonderfully in loue with Iustina, ſhe tolde the Emperour alſo what a goodly mayde ſhe was: that the daughter of Iustus paſſed for beautie all the women in the worlde, that ſhe her ſelfe, though ſhe were a woman, yet was wonderfully enamored with her ſweete face. The Emperour printinge in his harte the wordes which ſeemed onely to pearce but the eare, deuiſed with him ſelfe howe he myght compaſſe this beautifull Iustina to his wyfe, not diuorcinge Seuera▪
                         vpon whome he had gotten Gratianus, whome alſo he had made Emperour a little before. Wherefore he made aA wicked lawe. lawe, that as many as woulde myght lawfully haue two wyues, the which he proclaymed throughout euery citie. When the lawe was proclaymed, he tooke Iustina to his ſeconde wyfe, vpon whome he gotte 
                           Ʋalentinianus the yonger, and three daughters, Iusta, Grata, Galla. Of the which, two lead theyre lyues in virginitie, the thirde Galla by name, was maryed to Theodoſius Magnus, on whome he gotte his daughter Placidia. For he gotte Arcadius and Honorius of Placidia his former wyfe. But of Theodoſius and his children in an other place.

                        After that Themistius the Philoſopher had made an Oration in the hearinge of Valens, the Emperour relented from perſecuting of the Christians: and howe the Gothes in the tyme of Ʋalens embraced the Christian faith.

Although he beganne to be ſomewhat the meeker after theſe and other ſuch like perſwaſions which the philoſopher vſed, yet layde he not aſide all his venemous ſpyte and anger: for in ſteede of death he puniſhed the cleargie men with exile and baniſhment ſo longe, vntyll that his miſchieuous enterpriſe was ſtopped vpon ſuch occaſion as followeth. Cap. 33. in the greeke. The Barbarians inhabitinge beyonde Iſtrum, commonly called Gotthes, by reaſon of ciuill warres, were deuided into two partes: the one ſyde was lead by Phritigernes, the other by Athanarichus. When that Athanarichus ſeemed to gett the vpper hande, Phritigernes fledde for ayde agaynſte the enemie vnto the Romaines. 
                              Ʋalens
                         the Emperour vnderſtandinge of this, commaunded the ſouldiers of Thracia to ayde the one ſide agaynſte the other. The ſouldiers puttinge the enemie to flyght, foyled Athanarichus, and gott the victorie. Which was a cauſe that many of the Barbarian nations receaued the faith of Chriſt. For Phritigernes to requite the Emperoure for the curteſie ſhewed vnto him, embraced his religion, and perſwaded his ſubiects to the ſame. Wherefore many Gotthes, who then addic

                        ed them ſelues into the Arian opinion, partly for to feede the Emperours vayne, and fully to pleaſe him, neuer left it vnto this daye. Then alſo Vlphilas byſhop of the Gotthes
                        Vlphilas trāſlated the Bible into his owne tōgue. founde out the Gotthicke letters, and as ſoone as he had tranſlated holye ſcripture into that tongue, he determined with him ſelfe, that the Barbarians ſhoulde learne the bleſſed worde of God. Immediatly after that Vlphilas had inſtructed in the Chriſtian religion, as well the faction of Athanarichus, as the followers of Phritigernes, Athanarichus tormentedthe differēce betwene Arius and the Ariā Gotths grieuouſly many that profeſſed the Chriſtian faith, as if his countrey lawes and ordinances had bene corrupted by their meanes: ſo that diuers Barbarians of the Arian ſect then ſuffred Martyrdome. Arius becauſe he coulde not withſtande the erroure of Sabellius the

                        Aprick fell from the right faith, ſaying that the ſonne of God was but lately created: but theſe men receauing the Chriſtian faith with ſimplicitie of minde, ſticked not to ſpende their liues in the quarrell. Thus much of the Gothes conuerted as afore vnto the faith of Chriſt.

                        How the Gothes being driuen out of their owne contrey fled vnto the Romaine dominions, who being entertayned of the Emperour fell out to be the ouerthrowe of the empire, and the deſtruction of the Emperour him ſelfe &amp; howe the warrs with the Gothes wrought quietnes to the true Chriſtians.
                     
                     IN a ſhort while after, the aforeſayd Barbarians being reconciled and at one amonge them ſelues, were ouercome by other Barbarians their owne neighboures called Hunni, and driuen out of their owne contrey, ſo that they were faine to flie vnto the Romaine empire, they crooched vnto the Romaines, they proteſted loyaltie and ſubiection. 
                           Ʋalens vnderſtanding of this not ſoreſeeing what was like to enſue thereof, commaunded they ſhoulde curteouſly be entertayned, &amp; herein onely ſhewed him ſelfe clement. Wherefore he appointed them certaine contreyes of Thracia to inhabite, and thought him ſelfe happy for their comming. he thought to haue of them at hande alwayes ready an exerciſed army and ſpeedy hoſt againſt the enemy: Moreouer that the Barbarian watch woulde be a greater terror vnto the aduerſary then the Romaine ſouldier. Thenceforth be neglected the trayning of Romaine ſouldiers in feates of armes: he ſet at nought olde wether beaten warriers, valiant and couragious captaines. In ſteede of the ſouldiers which were muſtered and pricked throughout euery village of the ſeuerall prouinces he required money, commaunding that for euery ſouldier they ſhoulde pay foureſcore crownes. This he did when that he had firſt releaſed them of their tribute. This was the originall cauſe that ye 
                        Romaine affayres proſpered not in a long time after. Cap. 35. in the Greeke. Thus dealt the Saxons with the Brittaines. For the Barbarians now poſſeſſing Thracia, and enioying with eaſe and ſecurity the Romaine prouince, were immoderatly puft vp and ſwollen with proſperitie: they tooke armour againſt the Romaines which had bene their deare friendes, and benefitted them diuerſly: they beganne to ouerrunne and deſtroy all the contreyes about Thracia. When 
                           Ʋalens hearde of this, it was high time for him to leaue exiling of the true chriſtians, and to turne him ſelf vnto theſe rebells. Now muſed he, and caſt doubts with him ſelfe, immediatly he left Antioch and got him to Conſtantinople. By this meanes the heate of perſecution kindled againſt the Chriſtians was wholly quenched. Then alſo died Euzoius the Arian Biſhop of Antioch, the fift Conſulſhip of Valens, the firſt of Valentinianus the yonger: in whoſe rowme Dorotheus ſucceeded.

                        How the Saracens vnder the raygne of Mauia their Queene, tooke one Moſes a Monke, a godly &amp; a faithfull man to their Biſhop and embraced the Chriſtian faith.
                     
                     WHen the Emperour had left Antioch, the Saracens who before time were fellowes, friends, and in league with the Romaines, then firſt beganne to rebell: being gouerned &amp; guyded by a woman called Mauia, (whoſe huſband had departed this life a litle before) they tooke armour againſt them. Wherefore all the prouinces of the Romaine dominions that lay towards the Eaſt had then wholly bene ouerrunne by the Saracens: if the diuine prouidence of God had not withſtoode their enterpriſes. The meanes were theſe. Moſes a Saracene borne, lead in the deſert the monaſtical trade of life: for his zeale &amp; godlines, for his conſtant faith, for the ſtraung miracles wrought by him he was famous among all men. Mauia Queene of the Saracens required of the Romaines this Moſes to be her Biſhop, and in ſo doing ſhe woulde caſt of armour and ioyne in league with them. The Romaine captaines hearing of this, thought them ſelues happy if peace were concluded vpon ſuch a condition: laying all delayes aſide, they bid the Queene bring her purpoſe to paſſe. Moſes was taken from the wildernes and ſent to Alexandria for orders. When Moſes was come in the preſence of Lucius who then gouerned the Churches ofMoſes the Monke reaſoned thus with Lucius the Arian Biſhop. 
                        Alexandria, he refuſed his ceremonies and laying on of handes, reaſoning with him in this ſorte: I thinke my ſelfe vnworthy of the prieſtly order, yet if it be for the profitt of the common weale yt I be called vnto the function, truely thou Lucius ſhalt neuer lay hand vpon my heade. for thy right

hand is imbrued with ſlaughter and bloodſhed. When Lucius ſayd againe that it became him not ſo contumeliouſly to reuile him, but rather to learne of him the precepts of chriſtian religion, Moſes anſwered: I am not come preſently to reaſon of matters in religion, but ſure I am of this that thy horrible practiſes againſt the brethren proue thee to be altogether voyd of the true principles of Chriſtian religion. For the true Chriſtian ſtriketh no man, reuileth no man, fighteth with no man: for the ſeruant of God ſhoulde be no fighter. but thy deedes, in exiling of ſome, throwing of others to wilde beaſtes, burning of ſome others, doe crye out againſt thee: yet are we euer ſurer of the thinges we ſee with our eies then we heare with our eares. When Moſes had vttered theſe and other ſuch like ſayings, his friendes brought him vnto a certaine mountaine to be made Prieſt of ſuch as were there exiled. After that Moſes had thus bene conſecrated, the Saracen warre ended. Mauia thenceforth was in league with the Romaines, and maried her daughter to captaine Victor. Thus much of the Saracens.

The people boldning them ſelues vpon the ſight of theſe letters, thruſt Lucius out of the biſhopricke and placed Peter in his rowme.

                        After the returne of Valens into Conſtantinople, being reuiled of the people becauſe of the Gothes, left the city and went againſt the Barbarians, He ioynsd with them at Adrianoplis a city of Thracia, and was ſlayne the fiftieth yeare of his age, &amp; the ſixteeneth of his raigne.
                     
                     THe Emperour Valens entring into Conſtantinople in his ſixt Conſulſhip and the ſecond of Valentinianus the thirtieth of May found the citizens in great heauines. For the Barbarians who lately had ouerrunne Thracia, now beganne to ſet vpon the ſuburbes of Conſtantinople, becauſe there was then no power already prepared to repell their violence. When the Barbarians were come nigh vnto the walls, the citie was wonderfull ſory, they lamented their caſe: and forthwith they ſteppe vnto the Emperour and charge him that he entertained within his owne dominions ſuch as nowe were ready to cutt his owne throte: they blame him that he withſtoode them no ſooner: they condemned him becauſe he proclaimed not open warres againſt them. As they runne at tilt and exerciſed ſuch warlick and triumphāt game, all with one conſent runne vnto the Emperour and cryed out againſt him that he had ſet ſuch exerciſe at nought, ſaying: geue vs armour and we our ſelues will deale with them. While they exclame in this ſorte, the Emperour beganne to boyle within him ſelfe for anger, he left the citie the eleuenth of Iune, threatning them that if he returned home againe ſafe and ſound, he would plague the city of Conſtantinople, partly becauſe they reuiled him, and partly alſo for the treaſon they committed againſt the empire in ayding the rebell Procopius. When he had threatned he woulde vtterly deſtroy the citie, make it euen with the grounde, turne it to eareable lande for the plowe to paſſe through the bowells therof: he tooke his voyage againſt y• 
                        Barbarians, made them recoyle &amp; geue back farre from y• citie: he draue them as farre as Adrianople a citie of Thracia lying in the confines of Macedonia. As he ioyned there with the enemy he was flayne the nynth of Auguſtin and the aforeſayd Conſulſhip, the fourth yeare of the two hundreth eyghty and nynth Olympiade. Yet ſome ſay that as he fledd into a certaine village the which was ſett on fire by the Barbarian enemy, he was burned to aſhes. Some other ſay that he threwe aſide the imperiall robe and thruſt him ſelfe among the thronge of footemen, and when the horſemen had yelded without any great fighting, the footemen after the breaking of the raye as they ſtoode confuſely to haue bene all ſlayne, the Emperour alſo after

throwing away of the princely habite, when none coulde diſcerne who he was, to haue layen amonge them and not knowen. He departed out of this life the fiftieth yeare of his age, after that he had raygned thirteene yeares together with his brother and three yeares after his deſeaſe.

                        AT Antioch in Syria about that time there was raiſed a great tumult and ſeditiō about Meletius, the occaſiō was as followeth. We ſayd before howe that Paulinus Biſhop of Antioch becauſe he was a graue and a godly father was not exiled: y•

In proceſſe of time the people were reconciled vpon ſuch cōditions as followe. All that ſtoode for the Biſhopricke were ſix in number whereof one was Flauianus, being called together they depoſed them vpon a booke that none of them ſhoulde aſpire vnto the Biſhopricke during the liues of Paulinus and Meletius, and when ether of them departed this life, the Biſhopricke to remaine vnto the ſuruiuer of them both. When the oth was miniſtred the people were quiete and thenceforth made no ſturre at all. The fauorers of Lucifer were offended with this maner of dealing and fell from the church becauſe that Meletius being ordered of the Arians was admitted to the gouernemente of that ſeae. At that time when the affaires of Antioch were thus out of frame Gregorie by vniforme conſent of all the Catholick Biſhops was tranſlated from the Biſhopricke of Nazianzum vnto the ſeae of Cōſtantinople.

He meante it otherwiſe and thenceforth raiſed conuenticles without the walles of the citie. There departed together with him Lucius, who us I ſaid before was baniſhed Alexādria, enioyned to liue in exile, and then lead his life at Conſtantinople. Wherefore the Arians which helde the churches for the ſpace of forty yeares, refuſinge the vnitie and concorde which Theodoſius the Emperour exhorted them vnto, departed the citie in the fift Cōſulſhip of Gratian and the firſt of Theodoſius the ſixt and twentieth of Nouember.

The chiefe of all the Macedonian Biſhops was Eleuſius Biſhop of Cyzicum and Marcianus Biſhop of Lampſacum.

They ſayde flatly rather then they woulde ſubſcribe vnto the faith of one ſubſtance, that they would hold with the Arians. When they had made this anſwere they left Conſtantinople and ſent theyr letters abroade into euery citie that they ſhoulde in no wiſe conſent vnto the fayth of the Nicene councell. The Biſhops that were of the other ſide continewing at Conſtantinople cōſulted together about the election of a Biſhop.

                     ABout that time the corps of Paulus the Biſhop (whome as I ſaid before Philip the Emperours Liuetenant throught the procurement of Macedonius ſent to exile vnto Cucuſum a citie of Armenia &amp; there ſtifled to death) was conueyed by the Emperours commaundemēt from Ancyra to Cōſtantinople, and there receaued with great honor in the church which beareth his name vnto this day: the which church was vnto that time frequented of the Macedonians who ſeuered themſelues from the Arians, but then were thruſt out by the Emperour becauſe they refuſed to be of his faith &amp; opinion. At that time Meletius Biſhop of Antioch fell ſicke &amp; died, Gregorie the brother of Baſil preached at his funerall. His corps was caried of his friends into Antioch &amp; there interred. Againe the fauorers of Meletius would not be vnder Paulinus iuriſdiction but choſe Flauianus to their biſhop in the rowme of Meletius. Whereupon the people again were at diſcorde and fell to raiſing of tumults and diſſentiō. And becauſe of that, the church of Antioch was deuided againe, not about the faith but about their fond contention in chooſinge of Biſhops.

                        Howe the Emperour when his ſonne Arcadius was created Auguſtus ſummoned together a Synode of all ſectes and opinions: He baniſhed all heretickes the Nouatians onely excepted becauſe they embraced the fayth of one ſubſtance.
                     
                     WHen the Arians were baniſhed the churches the flame of tumult and ſchiſme flaſhed about in euery congregation. I can not chuſe but wonder at the Emperours aduiſe and pollicy therein. For he ſuffred not this ſeditiō to raigne very long throughout y• cities, but with ſpeede he ſummoned a councell charging that all ſects &amp; opiniōs whatſoeuer ſhould meet together, ſuppoſinge verily that by conference and communication had betwene them ſelues they would at length be brought to eſtabliſh one faith and opinion. The which drift and good meaning of his as I ſuppoſe was cauſe &amp; directer of all his proſperous ſucceſſes. For then it fel out through the prouidence &amp; procurement of almighty God that all the Barbarians were at peace within his dominions, rebelled not at all but yelded themſelues vnto the Emperiall ſeepter, for example Athanarichus the valiaunt captaine of the Gotthes came in withall his power &amp; ſhortly after died at Conſtantinople. The Emperour created Arcadius his ſonne Auguſtus in y• ſeconde Conſulſhip of Merogandus &amp; the firſt of Saturninus the ſixteenth of Ianuarie. ſhortly after all biſhops of euery ſect out of all prouinces came thither in y• ſayd Cōſulſhip but the moneth of Iune. The Emperour ſent for Nectarius Biſhop of Conſtantinople, reaſoned with him howe he might rid y• Chriſtiā religiō of y• diſcorde &amp; diſſention, howe it were poſſible to reduce y• church vnto vnitie: he ſayd further that y• controuerſies &amp; quarells which moleſted y• quiete ſtate of y• church &amp; rent aſunder y• membres of Chriſt were to be ſifted out &amp; y• puniſhments to light vpō their pates y• were founde the authors of ſchiſme and diſturbers of peace &amp; quietnes. Nectarius hearing of this was wonderfull ſadd &amp; penſiue: he called vnto him Agelius the Nouatiā
                         Biſhop who embraced together wt him y• faith of one ſubſtāce &amp; opened vnto him y• mind &amp; purpoſe of y• Emperour. He although otherwiſe a rare &amp; ſinguler man yet was he no body in controuerſies of religion &amp; diſputation of eccleſiaſticall matters

but appointed Siſinius a reader of his church to reaſon with them in his ſteade. Siſinius an eloquent man, well experienced in all thinges, aſkilfull interpretor of holy Scripture, a notable Philoſopher, knowinge full well that diſputations woulde not onely not reconcile ſchiſmes, but alſo fire the ſlymie matter of contention raygning in the rotten bowells of heretickes: therefore he aduiſed Nectarius in this ſorte: that it was not beſt to deale with them logicall wiſe with the frubuſhinge of ſchoole pointes, but to lay flat before them the formes of faith eſtabliſhed by our auncetors (he knewe of a ſurety that the Elders had taken heede leſt they ſhould aſſigne vnto the ſonne of God a begininge of eſſence, becauſe they were of the opinion that the ſonne of God was coeternall with the father) and that the Emperour ſhoulde demaunde of the ringleaders of the hereticks whether they made any accompt of thoſe aunciente fathers who gouerned the church godly and prudentely before the ſchiſme and diuiſion, or whether they condemned thē as aliens and farre eſtraunged frō the Chriſtian faith? If they reiect them, then let them boldely pronounce them accurſed: &amp; if they preſume ſo bolde an enterpriſe, then will the common people crie out againſt them. This beinge done the trueth after ſuch triall no doubt will preuayle. If they reiect not the auncient fathers thē let vs alleadge theyr workes and wrytinges and confirme the matter in controuerſie out of them. Nectarius beinge thus counſelled by Siſinius gotte him with ſpeede vnto the Emperoures pallace, made the Emperour priuey vnto theſe circumſtances. He thinketh well of the aduiſe and compaſſeth the matter circumſpectly. At the firſt he concealed his drift &amp; required of them to tell him whether they eſteemed and allowed of the fathers which gouerned the churche before the diuiſion, or no? When as they confeſſed as much in effect and ſayd that they highly reuerenced them for their maiſters: the Emperoure demaunded of them againe whether they woulde be tried by theyr teſtimonies toutchinge the true and right faith? the ſectes and factious Biſhoppes together with the Logicians then preſente (for they had broughte with them many well prepared for diſputation) hearinge this, knewe not what anſwer to make. They were deuided amonge themſelues, while that ſome helde with the Emperoure and ſome other affirmed that it was altogether contrarye to their mind and purpoſe, for y• diuerſe opinion they conceaued of the aunciēt fathers diſtracted their mindes one from the other. So that not onely the opinion was diuerſe among contrary ſects, but ſuch as were of one opiniō were deuided among themſelues. Wherefore theyr linked malice was no otherwiſe then the confuſe language of thoſe auncient Giaunts and the turret of theyr ſpitefull

                           . 11. muention was turned downe to the ground. When the Emperour vnderſtoode of their manifolde diſſentiō &amp; that they buylded not vpon y• auncient fathers expoſition of the faith, but truſted to their ſophiſticall quirckes of Logicke, dealt an other way with them, &amp; bad euery ſect lay downe theyr faith and opinion in wrytinge. Then the principall of euery ſecte tooke penne in hande and wrote his opinion. There was a daye appointed for the purpoſe. All the Biſhoppes beinge called mette at the Emperours pallace. There came thither Nectarius and Agelius fauoringe the faith of one ſubſtance: Demophilus
                         of the Arians: Eunomius
                         himſelfe in the name of the other Eunomians
                        The zeale of the Emperour Theodoſius for the ſiftinge out of the trueth. and Eleuſius Biſhop of Cyzicum for the Macedonians. Firſt of all the Emperour ſaluteth them rurteouſly: next he receaued euery ones wryting: then he went a ſide &amp; lockt in himſelfe: ſell downe vpon his knees and prayed vnto God that he woulde aſiſt him in the choice and reuealing of the trueth. Laſt of all hauing peruſed euery ones opinion he condemned and tore in peeces all ſuch Creedes as derogated from the vnitie which is in the bleſſed Trinitie: he allowed &amp; highly commended onely of all the reſt, the Creede containing the clauſe of one ſubſtance. This was the cauſe that the Nouatians were fauored and thenceforth ſuffred to celebrate their wōted aſſemblies within the walles of the citie. The Emperoure wonderinge at their conſente and harmonie toutching y• faith, made a lawe that they ſhould enioy their owne churches wt ſecuritie, and y• their churches ſhould haue ſuch priuiledgs as the other churches of the ſame opinion &amp; faith were wont to haue. The Biſhops of other ſectes becauſe there raigned amonge themſelues mutuall diſcorde and diſſentiō they were ſet at nought of the people committed to their owne charge. Who though at their departure they were all ſoroweful &amp; penſiue, yet fell they a cōforting of their charge by letters: exthorting them not to ſhrinke at all from them becauſe many had left them and fell to embracinge the faith of one ſubſtance. For many were called but fewe choſen. This they vttered not when y• greateſt parte of the people cleaued vnto the higher power and zealouſly embraced their faith. Yet for all this were not they which held the faith of one ſubſtance voyd of diſturbance and moleſtation. For the controuerſie that ſell out in the churche of Antioch deuided ſuch as were of the councell into two, factions for the Aegyptians, Arabians, &amp; Cyprians held together, &amp; thought

good to remoue Flauianus out of the Biſhops ſeae of Antioch: but the Palaeſtinians, Phoeniciās, &amp; Syrians tooke his parte. The iſſue &amp; end of this controuerſie I will lay downe in an other place.

                        Nouatian biſhop finiſhed the mortal race of his naturall life. The yeare following being the firſt cōſulſhip of Arcadius Auguſtur &amp; Vadon, after y•

                        Arians ſent for Marinus out of Thracia a man of their owne crue &amp; appointed him their biſhop. Marinus in whoſe time y•

The Emperoure leauing his ſonne Arcadius at Conſtātinople marched forewards to geue battail vnto Maximus. As he came to Theſſalonica he found the ſouldiers of Valentinianus all diſmayed &amp; quite diſcouraged: becauſe y• neceſſitie had conſtrained them to take the tyrant Maximus for an Emperour. Theodoſius ſhewed himſelfe openly to ſeeme of nere nother ſide. For whē 
                        Maximus had ſent embaſſadours vnto him he neither receaued neither reiected thē: yet was he ſory y• the Empire of Rome ſhould be oppreſſed with tyranny vnder colour of the Emperiall title.

Men commonly are wōt to fitten and faine leaſings of things they know not and if that by chaunce they get hold of any tale forthwith they brute abroade falſe rumors and reports according to their fond vaine and fooliſhe deſires, euer chatting of newes and harkeninge after chaunge. The which then was ſeene in the citie of Conſtantinople. For of the warres that were ſo farre of, they blaſed abroade of theyr owne braine one this thing an other that thinge: hoping in their traiterous hartes that y• godly Emperour had euery daye worſe ſucceſſe then other.

He liued not many dayes &amp; after him there was none choſen to y• rowme: for Flauianus through his deuiſe brought that to paſſe. As many then as deteſted Flauianus for the breakinge of his othe, had theyr priuate conuenticles. But Flauianus rolled (as commonly we ſay) euery ſtone, put euery deuiſe in vre

to the end he might bring them within his iuriſdictiō, the which not long after he brought to paſſe. For the ſpite and grudge betwene him and Theophilus biſhop of Alexādria was layd aſide and by his meanes Damaſus Biſhop of Rome was reconciled vnto him. They had bothe bene offended with him not onely becauſe he forſwore himſelfe: but alſo for that he had broken the league concluded betwene them, and the linke of peace and vnity.

For all iointly ranne vpon a head, they ſet vpon the Chriſtians, they ſought to diſpatch them euery kind of way: the Chriſtians went about to withſtand their violence, they defend themſelues and ſo miſchiefe was heaped vpon miſchiefe, the ſkirmiſh was ſo ſore and the fraye continewed ſo longe vntill ether ſide was wery, had their fill of bloodſhed &amp; manſlaughter &amp; could nowe kill no longer. There died but a fewe of y• Ethnicks, yet a great number of the Chriſtians, of either ſide there was wounded an infinite number. When all was ended the Ethnicks were wonderfully affraid of the Emperours diſpleaſure. Wherefore hauing committed ſuch lewde acts as their horrible wickednes led them vnto: and hauing quenched their boyling rage and fury with running ſtreames of bloode and wounded bowells they runne away and hid themſelues ſome in one place ſome in an other. Many gaue the ſlip out of Alexandria &amp; beinge diſperſed led their liues thenceforth in diuerſe other cities: of which number were Helladius

The Aegyptiās worſhipped the Ape. &amp; Ammonius both Grammariās, whoſe ſcholer I my ſelfe was at Cōſtantinople in my youthly yeares. Helladius was ſayde to be the prieſt of Iupiter &amp; Ammonius the prieſt of the Ape which they worſhipped for God. Therefore the ſlaughter beinge thus ended the gouernour of Alexandria &amp; the captaine of the hoſt came to ayd Theophilus in the ouerthrow of their temples▪ the temples went downe, the Idols of the Gods were turned into cawdrons and into other neceſſarie veſſell for houſhould ſtuff. For the Emperour had geuen the images of the Gods throughout all the Idolatrical temples of Alexandria to the reliefe of the poore. Theophilus going about to deface all the pictures of their Gods commaunded that one of ſome certaine God ſhould be reſerued and ſet vp in ſome publique place of the citie to the end the Ethnickes in proceſſe of time ſhould not be able to deny but that ſometimes they worſhipped ſuch Gods. I haue knowen Ammonius the grammarian to haue bene very much offended with that act &amp; to haue ſayd that the religion of the Graecians ſuſtained great iniury &amp; reproch becauſe y• one image was not in like ſort trāſlated, but kept of ſet purpoſe to the contumely of their religion. Helladius boaſted in y• hearing of many how y• in y• ſkirmiſhe he ſlewe nine men with his owne handes. Theſe were then the broyles at Alexandria.

                        Of the hieroglyphicall letters found engrauen in the temple of Serapis, letters they were which yelded no ſenſe by coniunction of ſyllable or knitting of ſentence, but were to be conſtrued by the ſignification of the beaſtes which they reſembled.
                     
                     IN the temple of Serapis nowe ouerthrowē and rifled throughout there were found ingrauen in the ſtones certaine letters which they call Hieroglyphicall. The maner of their ingrauinge reſembled the forme of y• croſſe. The which when both Chriſtians &amp; Ethnicks beheld before them euery one applied them to his proper religion. The Chriſtians affirmed y• the croſſe was a ſigne or token of the paſſion of Chriſt and the proper cognizance of their profeſſiō: the Ethnicks auoutched that therein was contained ſomthing in cōmon belonging as well to Serapis as to Chriſt: that the ſigne of the croſſe ſignified one thinge vnto the Ethnicks an other vnto the Chriſtians. While they contend thus about the interpretation of the letters many of the Ethnicks became Chriſtians for they perceaued at length the ſenſe and meaninge of the Hieroglyphicall letters, that they prognoſticated ſaluation &amp; the life to come. The Chriſtians perceauing that this made very much for their religion made great accompt thereof &amp; were not a litle proud of it. When as by other Hieroglyphicall letters it was gathered that the temple of Serapis ſhoulde go to ruine when the ſigne of y• croſſe therein ingrauē came to light (by that, life to come was foreſhewed) many more embraced Chriſtian religion, confeſſed their ſinnes &amp; were baptized. Thus muche haue I learned of y• croſſe But verily I am not of the opinion, that the Aegyptian prieſts foreſeeing that which ſhould come to paſſe of Chriſt ſhould ingraue in ſtone the ſigne of the croſſe (for if the myſterie of Chriſts incarnation was hid from the begining of the world &amp; from many generations as the Apoſtle wrytethColoſſ. 1. and concealed from the deuell the prince of all impiety, howe much more from the Aegyptian prieſts his miniſters) but that in ſifting out of y• ſenſe &amp; vnderſtāding of thoſe characters it came to paſſe by the prouidence of God as in times paſt with the Apoſtle Sainct Paul.

                        Howe the Emperour Theodoſius duringe the time of his abode at Rome did the citie muche good by remouinge the theeuiſhe dennes of the bakehouſes and the infamous ringing of bells at the deed doing in the ſtewes.
                     
                     THe Emperoure Theodoſius althoughe he continewed but a litle while in Italie, yet in that ſpace did he much good vnto the Citie of Rome, partely by geuinge that which was good and takinge awaye that which was ill. For as he ſhewed himſelfe bountifull and liberall towardes her in many thinges, ſo hathe he remoued two thinges whiche were greate blemiſhes vnto that Citie. The one was in this ſorte. There was at Rome a huge and a greate houſeA bakehouſe vnder grounde. of aunciente buyldinge where all the breade that ſerued the Citie was baked. The mayſters of this houſe the Romaynes called in theyre owne tongue Mancipes, ſuch they were as ſerued all with breade by Greate, who in proceſſe of time turned thoſe large rowmes to dennes of theeues. For by reaſon the bakehouſe that belonged vnto that buyldinge was vnder grounde and becauſe that on euery ſide there were vittailers, tauernes and tippling houſes full of harlots and naughtypackes:Blinde alehouſes. many that reſorted thither partely for foode and vittails and partly alſo for the ſatisfieng of theyr filthye luſte were craftely ſpoyled of all they had and moſte commonlye diſpatched, ſo that their friendes could neuer heare tidinges of them againe. A certaine priuie conueyance there was deuiſed to throw thē downe headlong from thoſe bawdy tauernes into the blind bakehouſe, by this meanes many eſpecially of the ſtraūgers which inhabited Rome were caſt away. For aboue they were ſpoyled &amp; beneath they were made bondſlaues and conſtrained to grind in yt bakehouſe: moſt of them were neuer permitted to departe but continewed their life time in drudgery making their

friends beleeue they were not in this world. It fell out that one of the Emperour Theodoſius ſouldiers was throwen into this hole, being in the cloſe bakehouſe, and couldnot get licence to depart, he drewe out his dagger and ſlewe them which ſtopped his paſſage, the reſt being afraide of their liues, let the ſouldier goe. The Emperour vnderſtanding all the circumſtance, ſent for the millers and bakers, puniſhed the maiſters with extreme torment, ouerthrewe thoſe blinde houſes which were receptacles of theeues and harlots. and thus ryd he the princely citie of this one ſhamefullTheodoſius tooke awaye this filthie lawe, &amp; ſuppreſſed the ſtewes. dealing. The other was as followeth. If a womā were taken in adulterie, the Romaines vſed ſuch a kinde of puniſhment as remoued not the ſinne, but encreaſed the vice. For they ſhutt her vp in narrowe ſtewes, and compelled her beaſtly without all ſhame to playe the harlott, yea they procured ringinge while the deede was adoing, that the neighbours might vnderſtand of it, and that by the ſounde of the tinglinge bells all might be made priuie to that filthie and ſhamefull kinde of correction. When the Emperour hearde of this horrible cuſtome, he thought it in no wiſe to be winked at, but cauſed Seſtra (for ſo were the ſtewes called) to be ouerthrowen and ſuppreſſed, and made other lawes for the correction of adulterers. Wherfore Rome by the benefit of Theodoſius y• Emperour was deliuered from both theſe beaſtly and foule acts. After that he had ſet other things in order, he left the gouernment of that citie vnto Valentinianus, tooke thēce his voyage together with his ſonne towards Conſtantinople, and came to his iourneys end at that time, when Tatianus and Symachus were Conſuls, the tenth of Nouember.

                     ABout that time it ſeemed good vnto the churche to take awaye the office of ſuch prieſts as were appoynted throughout euery church to receaue penitents after the confeſſion of their ſinnes into the company of the faithfull, and that for this occaſion.

Neither did the Nouatians at the beginninge allowe of this addition: yet the biſhops which nowe adayes gouerne the churches, although they retayned this cuſtome of a longe tyme, notwithſtandinge remoued it out of the churche in the tyme of Nectarius byſhop of Conſtantinople, by reaſon of an haynous offence committed in the churche in ſuch ſort as followeth. A noble woman came vnto the Prieſte whoſe office was to heare penitents, and confeſſed orderlyThe remouing of confeſſion and ſhriuing out of the church the ſinnes ſhe had committed after baptiſme. The Prieſt enioyned her to geue her ſelfe wholly to faſtinge and continewall prayer, that together with her confeſſion in worde, ſhe myght ſhewe forth the workes of repentance in deede. As ſhe continewed a whyle longer a ſhriuinge, ſhe accuſeth her ſelfe of an other crime, and declareth that a certaine deacon of that church had abuſed her bodie▪ for which offence by this meanes come to light, the Deacon was baniſhed the churche, andA deacon abuſed a certaine matron of Conſtantinople. therevpon there was much adoe amonge the people. They were wonderfully incenſed, not onely becauſe of the haynous offence that was committed, but alſo that thereby the churche was blemiſhed with reproche and infamie. When the prieſts were ſharply rebuked, and the aforeſayd crime obiected vnto them, Eudaemon miniſter of that churche by byrth of Alexandria, counſelled Nectarius the byſhop to take awaye the function of the ſhriuinge Prieſt, and graunt free libertie vnto euery one as his conſcience ſerued him, to become partaker of the holy myſteries. For in ſo doinge there was hope that the churche ſhoulde no longer be ſclaundered. Inſomuch that I heard theſe thinges of Eudaemons owne mouth, I doubted not to annexe it vnto this our hiſtorie. For as I haue often admoniſhed the reader, it was euer my dryft and purpoſe to learne the hiſtories of ſuch as knewe them very well, and diligently to ſyfte out the trueth, leſt that at any tyme my penne ſhoulde paſſe the boundes of a faithfull hiſtoriographer.

                     I Thinke it neceſſarie to laye downe in writinge ſuch thinges as fell out amonge others alſo, I meane the Arians, Nouatians, Macedonians, and Eunomians. For the church being once deuided, reſted not vpon one ſchiſme and diuiſion, but men fell out amonge them ſelues, one ſeuered him ſelfe from an other, vpon lyght and tryflinge occaſion they brake aſunder the bonde of loue and amitie. Wherefore how, when, and vpon what occaſion they varyed, I am nowe about to declare. Firſte of all we haue to learne, that Theodoſius moleſted none of all the aforeſayde ſects, Eunomius onely excepted: whome the Emperour exiled becauſe he rayſed conuenticles at his priuate houſe with in Conſtantinople, publiſhed abroade certaine lewde bookes of his owne, and infected many with the filth of his hereticall opinion. He diſquieted not the reſt, neither conſtrayned them to his communion, but licenced euery of them to frequent ſeuerall conuenticles, to embrace what opinion liked them beſt in chriſtian religion. And as he gaue leaue vnto all other ſects for to erect them churches without the walls in the ſuburbes: ſo he commaunded that the Nouatians (as we ſayde before) maintayninge together with him the faith of One ſubſtance, ſhoulde freely without diſturbance and moleſtation, enioy and recouer their former churches within the cities of whome nowe occaſion is miniſtred to vtter a fewe lynes, the which I will briefly runne ouer.

                        Agelius was byſhop of the Nouatian churche at Conſtantinople the ſpace of fortie yeares, that is (as I ſayde before) from the raygne of Constantine, vnto the ſixt yeare of Theodoſius. At his laſt ende he appoynted Siſinius to ſucceede him in the biſhopricke, a prieſt of his owne church, and a man very well ſeene in prophane literature, trayned vp in philoſophie together with Iulian the Emperour vnder Maximus the philoſopher.

In a while after, although he was very weake, yet went he into the church, and ſayd thus vnto the people: Immediatly after my deſeaſe you ſhall haue Marcianus to your biſhop, after Marcianus, Siſinius. When he had ſayde thus, he tooke his leaue of them, and not longeSiſinius. after dyed. But Marcianus beyng byſhop of the Nouatians, their church was deuided vpon ſuchSabbatius. an occaſion as followeth. Sabbatius a certaine Iewe embraced Chriſtian religion, whome Marcianus preferred to the function of prieſthood, notwithſtanding his conuerſion and preferment he ſauored of the old infection, and addicted him ſelfe vnto Jewiſhe obſeruations, neither was he onely cōtented with this, but nedes he would be made a biſhop. Wherfore after that he had gotten of his ſide a coople of prieſts, men of like diſpoſition and aſpiring mindes, by name Theoctiſtus and Macarius, he went about to reuiue the time and maner of ſolemnizing the feaſt of Eaſter, euen as (according vnto our former relation) the Nouatians attempted vnder Valens at Pazus, a peltinge village of Phrygia. And though at the firſt he ſeuered him ſelfe from the church, vnder pretence &amp; colour of the monaſticall trade of life, affirminge that certaine men were ſtumbling blocks vnto his conſcience, whome he thought vnworthy of the holy myſteries: yet in proceſſe of time whileſt that he raiſed priuate conuenticles, his drift was manifeſtly perceaued. Marcianus vnderſtandinge of this, miſliked very much wt him ſelfe that he had not taken better aduiſement in geuing of orders, y• he had preferred ſuch vayneglorious perſons &amp; aſpiring minds vnto the function of prieſthoode: he fretted within him ſelfe for anger, and wiſhed that his hāds had bene ſet vpon pricking thornesA Councell of Nouatian biſhops at Angaris. when they were layde vpon Sabbatius heade.

him the Canon contayninge a matter of indifferencie, that it was not a ſufficient cauſe to part aſunder the vnitie of the church about the celebration of Eaſter: and that their aſſemblie at Pazus, was no preiudice vnto the generall canon. They ſayd moreouer that the elderswhich immediatly ſucceeded the Apoſtles, varied among them ſelues about this feaſt, yet brake not aſunder y• bonde of vnitie: and that the Nouatians inhabitinge the princely citie of Rome, for all they neuer retayned the maner of the Iewes, but alwayes kept Eaſter after the Aequinoctiall ſpace, yet communicated notwithſtanding with ſuch as were of the ſame faith, &amp; obſerued a contrary cuſtome. When they had vſed theſe and other ſuch like reaſons to the ſame purpoſe, at length they concluded, that the canon of Eaſter was an indifferent matter: that it was lawfull thenceforth for euery one to celebrate that feaſte euen as he had aforetyme determined with him ſelfe: moreouer there was a prouiſo layde downe for the remouinge of diſſention, that if ſome varyed about the celebration of Eaſter, notwithſtanding they ſhoulde be at vnitie and concorde in the churche of God. Theſe thinges were then in this ſort layde downe of them for the rootinge out of variance from amonge them about the celebration of Eaſter. Sabbatius
                         beynge bounde with an oth, for all the celebration of that feaſte was variable and diuers, was before hande with them alone for faſtinge and vigils, for he kept Eaſter vpon the ſaturdaye: yet mette he the daye followinge with others in the churche, and was partaker together with them of the holie myſteries. That dyd he for the ſpace of many yeares, and therefore coulde not be concealed from infinite multitudes of men. By occaſion whereof many ſimple and ignorant ſoules, eſpecially in Phrygia and Galatia, hopinge verylie to be iuſtified thereby, became earneſt followers of him, and obſerued in ſecrete his celebration of Eaſter. In the ende Sabbatius rayſed priuate conuenticles, and forgetting the othe he had taken, was choſen byſhop (as hereafter ſhall more manifeſtly appeare) of ſuche as addicted themſelues to his kinde of diſcipline.

The which may euidently be gathered, when as there is no lawe eſtabliſhed by Chriſt in the Goſpell, whiche alloweth of the obſeruation of Jewiſhe rites: nay the Apoſtle hath in playne wordes forbidden it, where he abrogated circumciſion, and exhorted vs not to contend about feaſts and holydayes.

The driſt of the Apoſtles was not to lay downe canons and decrees concerning feaſts and holy dayes, but to become paterns vnto vs of pietie, of good life, and godly conuerſation. I am of the opinion, that as many other things crept in of cuſtome in ſundry places: ſo the feaſt of Eaſter to haue preuayled among all people of a certaine priuate cuſtome and obſeruation, inſomuch that (as I ſayde before) not one of the Apoſtles hath any where preſcribed to any man as muche as one rule of it. The ſucceſſe and euents haue manifeſtly declared vnto the worlde that of olde time it was obſerued not by canon, but of cuſtome. The greater part throughout the leſſer Aſia haue ſolemnized this feaſt of olde vpon the fourteenth day of the moneth, without any accompt made, or heede taken of the ſabaoth day. For all that, while they did ſo they were not at diſcord with ſuch as retayned a contrary obſeruation of that feaſt, afore that Victor biſhop of Rome through boyling heat &amp; choler had excō
                        municated all Aſia. I meane ſuch as obſerued the feaſt of Eaſter the fourteenth day of the moneth. For which act Irenaeus biſhop of Lions a citie in Fraunce, inueyed bitterly in his letters againſte Victor, rebuked him for his fu

Some (as I ſayd before) in the leſſer Aſia, doe celebrate that feaſt the fourteenth daye of the moneth: ſome againe inhabiting the fartheſt parts of Aſia eaſtwards, vary in the moneth, yet hold the feaſt vpon the ſaturday: they thinke that the Iewes are herein to be followed, for all they curiouſly marke not the time of the feaſt: theſe men doe ſolemnize it after the Aequinoctiall ſpace, yet doe they deteſt the time limited by the Iewes for the celebration therof: for they thinke that Eaſter is euer to be kept when the ſunne is in Aries, after the Antiochians in the moneth Xanthicus, but wt the Romaines in Aprill. That alſo therein they followed (as Ioſephus writeth in his third booke of Iudaicall antiquities) not the Iewes of the later age, who foully erred therein, but the eldeſt and moſt auncient. And as theſe men varied thus among themſelues about the obſeruation of the feaſt of Eaſter: ſo is it manifeſt that all other contreys throughout the weſt parts of the world, whoſe bankes are beaten with the ſurging waues of the Ocean ſea, of old tradition &amp; preſcribed cuſtome haue celebrated this feaſt after the Aequinoctiall lime. And for all that theſe contreyes, theſe nations, and languages thus varyed one from the other, yet they neuer deuided the communion of the church, neither brake they aſunder y• bond of vnitie. Neither is y• true which is rife in the mouthes of malicious men, that the councell ſummoned in the time of Conſtantinus Magnus, peruerted &amp; ſet quite out of order the maner and cuſtome retayned about the celebration of this feaſte. For Conſtantinus him ſelfe wrote vnto ſuch as varied from others, exhorting the fewer multitude to follow the greater number, the which epiſtle of the Emperour thou ſhalt finde wholly in Euſebius thirde booke of the lyfe of Constantine.

I my ſelfe haue preſumed ſo muche vpon your diſcrete vviſdomes, that vvhat cuſtome ſo euer is obſerued vvith vniforme conſent in the cytie of Rome, Italie, Aphricke, and all Aegypt, Spayne, Fraunce, Brittayne, Libya, and all Greece, in the prouinces of Aſia, Pontus, and Cilicia, you moſte vvyllingly vvoulde approue the ſame: vveyinge vvith your ſelues aright that there are not onely more churches, but a greater number of people in thoſe partes, and that all of duetie shoulde vvishe and earneſtly deſire that thinge to be moſte religiouſly eſtablished vvhich ryght and reaſon requireth, vvhich alſo hath no fellovvshippe vvith the open periurie of ſtubburne and ſtifnecked Iewes. This is a peece of the Emperours epiſtle. They that keepe Eaſter the fourteenth day of the moneth, bring forth Iohn the Apoſtle for their author: ſuch as inhabite Rome, and the weſt partes of the worlde, alleage Peter and Paul for them ſelues, that they ſhould leaue them ſuch a tradition. Yet there is none that can ſhew in writing any teſtimonie of theirs for cōfirmation &amp; proofe of their cuſtome. And hereby I do gather, y• the celebration of y• feaſt of Eaſter came vp more of cuſtome thē by any law or canon. Euery ſect &amp; religiō hath ſūdry &amp; diuers rites &amp; ceremonies, yet cōceaue they no worſe opiniō of others therfore thē of thē ſelues.

for they whiche are of one faythe and opinion, varye amonge them ſelues in rites and obſeruations. Wherefore occaſion is nowe miniſtred to diſcourſe of the diuerſitie of ceremonies and cuſtomes throughout all contreyes and Chriſtian congregations. The maner of faſtinge vſuallyLent. obſerued before Eaſter as it appeareth vnto the whole worlde hath diuerſly bene obſerued. Such as inhabite the princely citye of Rome doe faſte three weekes together before Eaſter, exceptinge the Saturdaye and the Sundaye: Illyrium, all Greece together with Alexandria, beginne their faſtinge dayes ſix weekes before Eaſter, and that ſpace they call forty dayes faſtinge or Lent. Others ſome contrary to the aforeſayde cuſtomes beginne to faſt ſeuen weekes before Eaſter, yet in all that whyle they vſe abſtinence but onely fifteene dayes, pauſing betweene euery of them, and theſe fewe dayes they call forty dayes faſtinge or Lent. ſo that I can not chuſe but maruell for all that they differ in the number of dayes, yet all ioyntly doe call euery of their obſeruations forty dayes faſtinge or Lent. Others ſome haue deriued the Etymologie of this worde as it pleaſed them beſt, and accordinge vnto the inuention of their owne brayne. Neyther is this difference onely about the number of the dayes, but alſo a greate diuerſitieDiuerſitie of meares in faſting. in the kindes of meate. For ſome doe abſtayne from euery liuinge creature: ſome other, of all the liuinge creatures feede onely vpon fiſhe: others together with fiſhe, feede vpon the foules of the ayre, affirminge as Moſes doth write, that their originall is of the water: othersGen. 1. ſome eate neyther nutts, neither aples, neyther any other kinde of fruite, nor egges neither: ſome feede onely vpon drye breade, ſome other receaue no not that. There are ſome that when they haue faſted vntill nyne of the clocke, they refreſhe nature with diuerſe ſortes of meates. Other nations haue other cuſtomes, the maner and cauſes are infinite. But in ſomuch there is no man able to ſhewe a preſident or recorde thereof in writinge: it is playne that the Apoſtles left free choyce and libertie vnto euery man at his owne diſcretion without feare, compulſion and conſtraynte to addicte him ſelfe vnto that whiche ſeemed good and commendable. Wee knowe for moſte certayne that this diuerſitie of faſtinge is rife throughout the worlde. AgaineThe communion toutching the Communion there are ſundry obſeruations and cuſtomes. for though in maner all the Churches throughout the whole worlde doe celebrate and receaue the holy myſteries euery Sabaoth daye after the other: yet the people inhabitinge Alexandria and Rome, of an olde tradition doe not vſe it. The Aegyptians adioyninge vnto Alexandria together with the inhabitours of Thebais, vſe to celebrate the Communion vpon the Sundaye, yet doe they not receaue the Communion as the maner is among the Chriſtians. For when they haue banquetted and crommed them ſelues with ſundry delicate and daynty diſhes, in the Eueninge after ſeruice they vſe to communicate. Agayne at Alexandria vpon the Thurſdaye and Frydaye the Scriptures are read, the Interpretours expounde them, all the ſolemnitie for the Communion is accompliſhed, yet the Communion then not receaued. And this is an olde and an auncient cuſtome at Alexandria. It is well knowen that Origen floriſhed in thoſe dayes in the Churche, who beinge a wiſe and diſcreete Doctor and Expounder of holy Scripture, perceauing that the preceptes of Moſes lawe coulde in no wiſe be litterally vnderſtoode, gaue forthe of the Paſſeouer a myſticall and more diuine kynde of interpretation: that there was but one onely true Paſſeouer or Eaſter, the whiche our Sauiour effectually ſolemnized at his naylinge to the tree, when he encountred with the power of darkenes, and triumphed ouer the Deuill andReaders. all his workes. Agayne the Readers and Interpreters of holy Scripture at Alexandria be they Cathecumeniſts or baptized it forceth not: when as the cuſtome in other contreyes and Churches is to admitt none into that function vnleſſe he be firſte baptized. I remember my ſelfe an other cuſtome which preuayleth and is of force in Theſſalia: that if there he whiche is a Prieſt after the receauinge of orders doe keepe company with his wife the whiche he maryed beinge a laye man he is forthewith depoſed of the miniſterye: yea when as all the famous PrieſtesThe lawfull mariage of Prieſtes. througheout the Eaſterne partes of the worlde, and the Biſhopes alſo refrayne the company of their wiues at their owne choyſe without lawe or compulſion. For many of them notwithſtandinge the adminiſtration and gouernement of their Biſhoprickes, begett children alſo on their lawefull wiues. The autor and ringeleader of that cuſtome in Theſſalia was Theodorus a Prieſte of Triua a citye of that contrey, the wryter of thoſe wanton and amorous bookes the whiche he made in the pryme of his floriſhinge youthe, and intituled Aethiopica. They retayne the ſame obſeruation and cuſtome at Theſſalonica, Macedonia and Hellas in Achaia. I remember they haue an other cuſtome in Theſſalia, that is, they baptize onely on theBaptiſme.

Euen ſo doe the Macedonians in Helleſpontus, and ſuch as throughout Aſia doe celebrate the feaſt of Eaſter the fouretenth day of the moneth. The Nouatians throughout Phrygia allowe not of ſeconde mariages: ſuch as of them inhabite Conſtantinople, doe neither receaue it neither reiect it: againe ſuch as are in y• Weſt partes of y• world admit it wholly. The originalls and autors of ſo great a diuerſitie were Biſhops which gouerned the Churches at diuerſe and ſeuerall times. ſuch as like of theſe rites doe commende them vnto the poſteritie for lawes. But to penne in paper the infinite and diuerſe ceremonies and cuſtomes throughout cities and contreyes woulde be a very tedious peece of worke and ſcarſe nay vnpoſſible to be done. This much already layd downe may ſeeme a ſufficient treatiſe for to proue that the celebration of the feaſte of Eaſter beganne euery where more of cuſtome then by commaundement either of Chriſt or any Apoſtle. Wherfore their talke ſauoreth not of the trueth, their report is to no good purpoſe which ſay that the Nicene Councell ſett the maner of celebrating this feaſt out of ſquare. For the biſhops of that aſſembly endeuored with all might poſſible to reconcile the leſſer number with the greater which varied from them. Neither were the Apoſtles times without ſuch broyles and diſſentions, neither were they themſelues ignorant hereof as it appeareth by the Acts of the Apoſtles. for when the Apoſtles vnderſtoode of the tumult and ſturre raiſed amonge the faithfull through the variety and contention of the Gentils, they all aſſembled together: they layde downe a certayne holy lawe the which they publiſhed vnto the worlde in forme of an epiſtle, deliuering the faithfull from the heauy yoke of bondage, from the vayne and friuolous contention riſing thereof. They haue taught them a ſure and a certaine rule for the direction of good life, preſcribing them onely ſuch thinges as were neceſſary to be obſerued. And for all the epiſtle is to be ſeene in the Acts of the Apoſtles, yet there is no cauſe to the contrary but that the reader may find it among theſe our hiſtories.

Farevvell.
                         Theſe thinges were agreeable with the will of God, for ſo the epiſtle teſtifieth: It pleaſed the holy Ghoſt not to burthen you further then vvith the obſeruation of theſe neceſſaries. But ſome neglecting theſe things account of fornication as a thing indifferent, yet they contende about holydayes as it were for life and death: they deſpiſe the commaundements of God and eſtabliſh them Canons of their owne: they ſet at nought, they make no accompt of the law publiſhed by the Apoſtles, and ſo vnaduiſedly they put in practiſe contrary decrees vnto the will of God him ſelfe. Furthermore although I coulde preſently diſcourſe more at large of the feaſte of Eaſter and proue with manifeſt demonſtrations that the Ievves them ſelues obſerued not diligently neither as they ought, either the time or the maner of the celebration, and that the Samaritans a ſect of the Ievves, kept it alwayes after the Aequinoctiall ſpace: yet becauſe it requireth a ſeuerall title and a long treatiſe, I will here cutt it of.

Matth. 21. types and figures, it behoueth them to vary from them▪ no (as commonly we ſay) not the breadth of a nayle. for if they addict them ſelues vnto ſuch preciſe obſeruations, of neceſſitie they muſt not onely obſerue dayes, and moneths, and yeares: but alſo whatſoeuer Chriſt did after the Iewiſh maner for the fulfilling of the lawe, or the iniuries he vniuſtly ſuſtained of the Ievves, or the things he vttered in figures and parables to pleaſe all generally. For example, he taught in the ſhip, he commaunded the Paſſeouer ſhoulde be prepared in an vpper chamber or parlour, he charged them to looſe the aſſe that was tyed, he gaue the man bearing the pitcher of water in his hande for a ſigne vnto ſuch as went to prouide the Paſſeouer, and infinite other ſuch like examples written in the Goſpell. Yet they that hope them ſelues iuſtified by the obſeruation of this feaſte, endeuour not at all to fulfill any of theſe after the externall maner and literall vnderſtandinge. Not one of them euer preached out of the ſhip vnto the people: not one celebrateth the Paſſeouer in a parlour: not one firſt tyeth a ſhe aſſe, then looſeth her againe: not one of them appoynted the cariage of a pitcher of water for the fulfilling of all circumſtances appertaininge vnto theſe myſteries. They thinke that theſe thinges belonge rather vnto the Ievves then vnto the Chriſtians. For the Ievves retayne ſuch ordinances more with the outward and corporall obſeruation, then with the inwarde and ſpirituall vnderſtanding. Wherefore they are helde accurſed becauſe they thinke that Moſes law conſiſteth rather in figures and types then in trueth and the thinges them ſelues. Such as fauor the Ievves although they conceaue theſe thinges after a myſticall and diuine kinde of interpretation, yet raiſe they a foule ſturre about dayes and monethes, and treade vnder foote, nay they drowne of wilfull ignorance the vndoubted and ghoſtly trueth ingraffed within them, and therefore of neceſſitie they are in this point to be condemned alike with the Ievves, for they purchaſe vnto them ſelues the ſentence of curſe &amp; condemnation.

                     NOw let vs returne vnto our former purpoſe and drift mētioned a litle before, that is to diſcourſe howe the Churche being once deuided reſted not with the firſt diuiſion, but ſuch as were ſeuered into ſundry ſects and ſchiſmes fell from their felowes and vpon light and trifling occaſions diſagreed among them ſelues. The Nouatians as I ſaid before were deuided aboutNouatians. the obſeruation of the feaſt of Eaſter, neither yet were they content with one diuiſion. for throughout ſundry prouinces they ſometymes iarred and ſometymes ioyned together not onely about the moneth, but alſo the day of the weeke, and other ſuch like matters of ſmall importance. The Arians
                        Arians. were deuided vpon ſuch an occaſion as followeth. Continewall arguing and broching of intricate quircks, brought their diſputations to very abſurd and horrible opinions. Wheras y• church beleeueth that God is the father of the ſonne who is the worde, they call into controuerſie whether God might be called a father before the ſonne had his being. And becauſe they were of the opinion that the worde of God was not begotten of the father but had his being of nothing, erring in the chiefe and principall, no maruell though they plunged into abſurde opinions. Dorotheus whome they had tranſlated thither from Antioch ſaid, that the father could be neither in eſſence neither in appellation, if the ſonne had no being. Marinus whome they had called out of Thracia before Dorotheus time (ſtomacking that Dorotheus was preferred before him) ſuppoſed now y• it was highe time for him to worke his feate, ſet him ſelfe oppoſite &amp; maintained y• contrary opinion. Wherfore they were diuided &amp; by occaſion of the vaine &amp; friuolous queſtion propoſed among them they parted companies: Dorotheus wt his followers continewed in their former rowmes, Marinus wt hisMarinus the ariā thought that the father was a father when there was no ſonne.

Theſe followers of Marinus were called Pſathyriani becauſe that one Theoctiſtus a wafrer, borne in Syria was an earneſt maintainer of y• ſide. Of y• opinion was Selenas biſhop of y• 
                        Gotths, a mungrell, by father a Gotth, by mother a Phrygian, and therefore was he able to preach in y• Church in both thoſe languages. This ſect alſo not long after was diuided: for Marinus contended wt 
                        Agapius, one, whom he him ſelf had lately aduaunced to the biſhoprick of Epheſus. The controuerſie was not of religion but of primacie, they ſtroue whether of them ſhould be chief. The Gotths went of Agapius ſide. Wherfore many clergy mē vnder theſe

Who after their reconciliation and agreement made a lawe that the queſtion which was the principall cauſe of that ſturre ſhoulde neuer againe be called into controuerſie. Yet for all they coulde doe, that decree of theirs coulde take no place ſaue at Conſtantinople▪

                     THe Eunomians were alſo deuided. for Eunomius him ſelfe firſt fell from Eudoxius who hadEunomians. choſen him biſhop of Cyzicum, the occaſion he tooke was becauſe he woulde not admitt his maiſter Aetius lately excommunicated into the Churche. others alſo called after his name parted them ſelues into ſundry ſects. And firſt of all one Theophronius a Cappadocian, trayned vpTheophronius. in captious fallacies and quircks of logick vnder Eunomius, had Ariſtotles praedicaments
                         and perihermenias at his fingers endes, wrote bookes &amp; entitled them the exerciſes of the minde. Wherfore he was hated of his owne ſect and counted of them an Apoſtata: he raiſed thenceforth priuate conuenticles and left behinde him an hereſie intitled with his appellation. Agayne at Conſtantinople one Eutychius vpon light and trifling occaſion fell from the Eunomians, and vnto this dayEutychius. frequenteth ſeuerall meetings. The followers of Theophronius were called Eunomothephroniani, and ſuch as were of the ſect of Eutychius were termed Eunomieutychiani. what vaine and fond thinges they brawled about, I thinke it not needefull to laye downe in writing leſt we ſhoulde digreſſe from the hiſtory we haue in hande. Yet in ſomuch they haue corrupted baptiſme, I muſt in no wiſe runne that ouer with ſilence. They baptize not in the trinitie but in the death of Chriſt.

Theſe men gaping after promotion and dignities being promiſed faire, fell vpon the Emperour as he ſlept andValentinianꝰ the Emperour was ſtifled Anno Dom. 396. ſtifled him to death. Eugenius hauing gott the ſupremacy in the weſt parts of the worlde, behaued him ſelfe after the wonted guyſe of tyrants. Theodoſius the Emperour vnderſtanding of this was ſory at the hart: he thought it high time for him now to make expedition for the ſeconde battell, for the firſt he had waged with Maximus. Wherefore gathering together a great army, and creating

Emperour his ſonne Honorius in his thirde Conſulſhip and the firſt of Abundantius, the tenth of Ianuary, he tooke his iorney towards the Weſt partes of the worlde, leauing both his ſonnes the Emperours at Conſtantinople. As he went to wage battell with Eugenius, many of the Barbarian nations inhabiting the contreyes beyonde Iſtrum, came of their owne accorde to ayde the Emperour againſt the tyrant. ſhortly after he came into Fraunce with great power, for there the tyrant had gathered infinite multitudes of ſouldiers and fortified him ſelfe. the campe was pitched and the battell was fought by a certayne riuer called Phrigdus. 
                        Here the greeke was vnperfect. As the battell was doubtfull where the Romaines dealt hand to hand with the Romaines, ſo agayne of the Barbarians which came to ayde the Emperour Theodoſius, Eugenius had the vpper hand. The Emperour ſeeing the Barbarians foyled and ouerthrowen was wonderfull penſiue, he fell downe proſtrate vpon theThe Emperour Theodoſius prayeth vnto god for ayde. grounde, prayed vnto God for ayde and aſiſtance and obtayned his ſute. for Macurius his captaine put on venturous and valiant courage got him to the ſide where the Barbarians were foyled, came to the ſtandard, ioyned with him the chiefe captaynes, encountred with the enemy and brake the aray, In the ende made them to flie which purſued after the flight.

                     THe Emperour Theodoſius by reaſon of the trauell and great toyle he had taken about thoſe warres, beganne to be very ill at eaſe. And when that his diſeaſe gaue him to vnderſtande that the mortall race of his naturall life was then to be finiſhed, care and doubts appertayning vnto the gouernment of the common weale troubled him more then the frayle departure or the feare of death, yea when he conſidered with him ſelfe how many calamities do commonly happen vnto the empire when the Emperour and the ſcepter be parted aſunder. Wherefore he ſent in poſt haſt for his ſonne Honorius to Conſtantinople, purpoſing to eſtabliſh through him peace and tranquilitie in the Weſt partes of the worlde. At the comming of the ſonne to Millayne the father was ſomewhat recouered and beganne to celebrate exerciſe of triumphe for ioye of the victory gotten of the tyrant. In the morning he felt him ſelfe ſo well that he honored the triumphe with his preſence. In the afternoone he was ſo ſodainly taken with his diſeaſe that he was not able to goe &amp; beholde the ſolemnitie, but charged his ſonne to ſee all the royaltie accompliſhed, the nightTheodoſius died Anno Domini. 397. following he departed this life. It was when Olybrius and Probinus were Conſuls the ſeuenteneth of Ianuary, the firſt yeare of the two hundreth nynety and fourth Olympiad.

But I woulde haue you knowe afore ye reade them, that I haue not curiouſly addicted my ſelfe vnto lofty ſtile, neither vnto a glorious ſhewe of gay ſentences: for ſo peraduenture in running after words and phraſes I might haue miſt of my matter and fayled of my purpoſe and intent, had I attayned, yet was it not in my reache to laye downe that forcible kinde of ſtile vſed of auncient wryters wherewith they amplifie and diminiſh, they extoll and debaſe at their pleaſure. Agayne ſuch a penning profiteth very litle the vulgare and ignorant ſorte of people who deſire not ſo much the ſine and elegant phraſe as the furtherance of their knowledg and the trueth of the hiſtory. Wherfore leſt that our ſtory ſhoulde halt of both ſides and diſpleaſe the learned in that it doth not counteruade the artificiall ſkill and profounde knowledge of auncient wryters: the vnlearned in that their capacitie can not comprehende the ſubſtance of the matter by reaſon of the paynted Rhetorick and picked ſentences, I haue tyed my ſelfe vnto ſuch a meane, for all the handling is ſimple, the trueth is ſoone founde and the effect quickly vnderſtoode. Furthermore nowe entring into diſcourſe of our ſixt booke I muſt needes tell you the trueth that I am euen in maner diſmayed whenHe beginneth the hiſtory of his tyme. I take penne in hande to paynt for the vnto the poſteritie the famous acts of theſe our floriſhinge dayes, leſt it fall out that we laye downe in writinge ſuch thinges as may offende ſome kinde of men, or (as commonly we ſaye) leſt trueth be conſtrayned to trye her friendes: when as we publiſhe not with prayſes and commendations the names of ſuch as they like well of, or extoll not vnto the ſkies the fame of their noble and famous acts. The fauorers of Prelats and patrons of clergy men will blame vs for not intitling the Biſhops, moſte godly, moſte holy, and ſuch like epithetons. Other ſortes of men, ſomewhat more curious then the reſt, will miſconſtrewe our meaning for not calling the Emperours Lordes, and moſt vertuous, with other ſuch like honorable titles vſually geuen them of men. But ſeeing that I am able to proue and iuſtifie out of auncient wryters that the ſeruant in their bookes hath called his Lorde and Maiſter no otherwiſe then after his chriſtened name: I will laye aſide theſe lofty titles and tye my ſelfe as my bounden duety requireth vnto the trueth of the hiſtory: and keepinge my ſelfe within the compaſſe and limites of faythfull Hiſtoriographers which couet a ſimple and a playne kinde of ſtile, I will nowe to the matter and write of ſuch thinges as I haue partly ſeene, and partly learned of ſuch as ſawe them with their eyes, the which I haue better liking of becauſe the reporters varied not amonge them ſelues. I had much adoe and greate labour in ſifting out the trueth, becauſe that ſundry men of diuers fortes made relation thereof vnto me: wherof ſome affirmed that they had bene preſent, ſome other that they had occaſion to ſearche out all circumſtances.

And when ſome thought on this man ſome on that man, after longe aduiſement and deliberation, in the ende it ſeemed good vnto them to ſende for Iohn a prieſt of Antioch: for the report went of him that he was a profounde Interpretor and a notable Rhetorician. Wherefore not long after the Emperour Arcadius with the generall conſent both of Prieſt and people ſent for him. And to the ende his conſecration might be of more authoritie by the commaundement of the Emperour there were preſent many other Biſhops and namely Theophilus Biſhop of Alexandria, who went about by all meanes to diſcreditt Iohn and to preferre vnto the biſhopricke one Iſidorus a Prieſt of his owne Churche. Theophilus made very much of this Iſidorus, becauſe that for his fake he had taken a perilous peece of worke in hande. And what the ſame was I am nowe about to declare. When the Emperour Theodoſius waged battell with Maximus the tyrant, Theophilus ſent preſents by Iſidorus vnto the Emperour together with two letters, charging him with all to preſent him that had the vpper hande with the gift and one of the letters. Iſidorus being carefull of his buſines went diligently about this feate, gott him to Rome, and harkneth after the victory. but his fetch was not longe ere it was founde out. for his Reader that kept him company ſtole away his letters. Wherupon Iſidorus being afraide to be taken with the maner, tooke his heeles in all the haſt to Alexandria, this was it that made Theophilus to labour ſo earneſtly for Iſidorus. but all that were of the Emperours court preferred Iohn to the Biſhopricke. And afterwards when as many charged Theophilus with haynous crimes and preſented vnto the Biſhops then preſent libells and articles agaynſt ſome for this thinge and ſome for that: Eutropius one of the Emperours chamber came by the articles and enditements, ſhewed them to Theophilus, bad him chuſe whether he woulde create Iohn Biſhop or ſtand at the barre and holde his hande to the crimes that were layd to his charge. Theophilus was ſo affrayde with this, that by and by he conſented to the ſtalling of Iohn. He was conſecrated to execute the prieſtly function of a Biſhop and ſtalled in the ſeae of Conſtantinople, the ſix and twentieth of February, the Conſulſhip following when as the Emperour Honorius gouerned the common weale of Rome, and Eutychianus the Senator in the Emperours ſteede ruled Conſtantinople.

Iohn was borne

in Antioch a citie of Caeloſyria, his father was cleped Secundus, his mother Anthuſa, he deſcended of the noble race of Senators, he was the diſciple of Libanius the Sophiſt, and the auditor alſo of Andragathius the Philoſopher. When that he purpoſed with him ſelfe to apply his minde vnto the lawe and publique affayres of the common weale, and perceaued howe lewde and howe vnrighteous a trade of life they leade which buſie them ſelues therein: he left that troubleſome trade and transformed him ſelfe vnto a quiet and ſolitary kinde of life. the example of Euagrius as I thinke allured him thereunto, who being brought vp vnder the ſame teachers &amp; ſchoole. maiſters, addicted him ſelfe a litle before vnto a ſolitary life voyd of all trouble &amp; moleſtation. Immediatly he chaunged both habite and behauiour and gaue him ſelfe wholly to the ſtudy of the ſacred Scriptures: he deuiſed with him ſelfe howe by all meanes poſſible be might become a profitable member in the Churche of God: he perſwaded Theodorus and Maximus his fellow ſtudents,Theodorus Maximus. who together with him frequented the ſchoole of Libanius, to forſake that trade of life which was wholly ſett on lucre and gaine and to followe that which was ſatisfied with a litle: of theſe men the one was afterwards Biſhop of Mopſieſtia a citie in Cilicia, the other was biſhop of Seleucia in Iſauria.

He was a man by reaſon of his maruelous great temperance, in life very auſtere and (as one that knewe him from his youth vp did report) more ruled by choler then geuen to curteous ciuilitie. A man he was of no great forecaſt, he made no accompt of the worlde, and becauſe of his plaine and ſimple meaning he was ſoone deceaued. He was very copious and free of ſpeach with all ſuch as had conference with him, &amp; as he was very painfull to the ende by teaching he might reforme the maners and liues of his auditors: ſo againe of ſuch as were not acquainted with his behauiour he was accompted in his exhortations very arrogant and inſolent.

And in fewe wordes to confeſſe the trueth Serapion deacon of that church made him incurre all that diſpleaſure, who in preſence of all the clergie ſayde thus vnto him. O Biſhop thou ſhalt neuer be able to rule all theſe as thou wouldeſt, vnleſſe thou make them all taſte of one whipp. the which ſaying of his procured greate hatred vnto the Biſhop.

The reportes that went of him, to wete: that he woulde neuer eate or drynke with any man, and beinge laued to a banquette he

would not come, perſwaded the herers. So that the ſclaunder raiſed of him increaſed more &amp; more Why and wherefore he would not fede in company with other men there was no man that knewe certainelye.

But howe ſoeuer it went theſe excuſes were of force not ſufficient to wipe awaye the hainouſnes of the crimes wherewith he was charged of the aduerſaries. For all that, the people were wonderfully affectioned towards him &amp; loued him entirely, becauſe of the notable ſermones he made in the opē audiēce of the church, wherefore they made no accompt of the accuſations &amp; ſclaunders that were laide to his charge.

For Eutropius the Eunuche and chiefe of the Emperours chamber made great ſute vnto the Emperour, for to haue a lawe made by the Emperours y• none might take the church for his ſanctuary but that ſuch as fled thither for refuge might be pulled out by the eares.

Againe for other matters he inueyed freely againſt other magiſtrats of the common weale which turned in the end to his great diſpleaſure. Theophilus alſo Biſhop of Alexandria immediatly after he had conſecrated him biſhop beganne buſily to deuiſe howe he might worke him miſchiefe.

                        The tyranny of Gainas the Gotth, the ſedition raiſed of him at Conſtantinople and of his ende.
                     
                     NOwe I goe about to declare a certaine hiſtorie of that time whiche is worthie of memory amonge all poſterity in time to come, I will (declare howe the citie of Conſtantinople it ſelfe &amp; the proſperity of the Romaine Empire were deliuered out of extreme peril &amp;

vtter ouerthrowe by the wonderfull prouidence of almighty God. Nowe harken to the circumſtance. One Gainas by birth a Barbarian yet a ſubiect of the Empire of Rome, was ſo trained vp in warlike exerciſe, and feates of armes, that at length through the dayly creditte he purchaſed by valiant actes he was of the Romaines made captaine both of the horſemen and footemen. When he had gotte vnto his perſon ſuch honor and ſo great a power at his becke and commaundemente he forgate himſelfe, he could not moderate the aſpiring pride of his ſwelling ſtomacke, but deuiſed euery waye and rolled as commonlye we ſaye euery ſtone for to bringe the Romaynes vnder his girdle. And therefore he ſent for all the Gotths out of their countrey determininge with himſelfe to entertaine and ſtay with him as many as were fitte for feates of armes. Tribigildus tribune of the ſouldiers in Phrygia being ſomewhat a kinne vnto him and alſo of his conſpiracye ſubdued all the Phrygian nation: Gainas then made earneſt ſute vnto the Emperour in his owne behalfe that he woulde make him Liuetenant of Phrygia. The which Arcadius the Emperour without foreſighte of that which was like to enſue, graunted vnto him with a willinge minde. He immediatly (as they reported) wente to geue battaill vnto Tribigildus, but as trueth was to playe the tyrantTribigildus. &amp; brought at his tayle thouſands of the barbarous Gotths. He was no ſooner entred into Phrygia but all the contrey yelded vnto him. The Romaines were in a woefull plight partely becauſe thatPhrygia ſub dued. ſo greate a multitude of Barbarians followed after Gainas, and partely alſo becauſe that the Eaſterne parts of the empire were in great daunger of inuaſion. Then the Emperour yelding vnto y• neceſſity of y• time, aduiſed himſelfe, dealt ſubtlely with y• 
                        Barbariā, ſent vnto him Embaſſadours, and ſought by all fayre meanes to pacifie him. And when that he requeſted the Emperour to ſend vnto him Saturninus and Aphelianus who were Conſuls &amp; head Senatours whome he ſuſpected to be hinderers of his enterpriſed conſpiracy: the Emperour though vnwilling, yet becauſe of y• time yelded vnto his requeſt. They being of a noble &amp; valiant courage, deſirous alſo of death in the qua rell and defence of theyr countrey obeyed the Emperours commaundement. To be ſhort they met the Barbarian in a playne greene, where they vſed to iuſt and runne at tilt a good way of Chalcedon, and redy they were to endure what torment ſo euer were layde vpon them. But he did them no harme, for he diſſembled his drift &amp; got him to Chalcedon, there Arcadius the Emperour mett him. The Emperour and the barbarian being together in the temple where the corps of Euphemia the martyr lyeth interred, ſware one to the other that nere nother would conſpire neither procure the others death. But although y• Emperour a man both godly &amp; zealous made great accōpt of his oth and kept it vnuiolably: yet Gainas forſware himſelfe, brake the league and ceaſed not toGainas

Wherefore Conſtantinople vp reaſon of the infinite number of Barbarians which abode there became in maner a Barbarian citie, of the citizens and inhabitants there was no other accompte made then of captiues and bondeſlaues. The citie was in ſo great a daūger that a wonderfull great Comet reachingA comet. in maner frō y• ſkie vnto y• earth (the like whereof was neuer remēbred to haue bene ſeene before) prognoſticated the ſame. Gainas firſt of all laing ſhamefaſtnes aſide &amp; ſteeling his face with impudencye purpoſed in his minde to rifle the ſhoppes of the bankers and exchaungers. But when as the report thereof preuented his lewde purpoſe and the bankers remoued theyr exchaunginge tables and conueyed awaye theyr money: he endeuored to compaſſe an other miſchieuous act, for he ſent in the nighte ſeaſon a multitude of Barbarians to fire the pallace of the Emperoure. At what time it appeared vnto the wholl world how carefull God was ouer that citie. For an iufinite nūber of Angells reſembling men of monſtrous bodies all in gliſterng armour were ſeene of theſe rebelsConſtantinople was ſaued by Angells. that went about to ſet the pallace on fire: the Barbarians ſuppoſing they had bene a greate armie and a mightie hoſt, were aſtonied and ranne away. Gainas hearinge of this thought it a thinge incredible. He knewe for certaintie yt ſo great a power of Romaine ſouldiers coulde not poſſibly be there, for they were appointed ſeuerally throughout euery citie. The night followinge he ſent thither others &amp; that not once neither twiſe whē as y• ſouldiers being oftē ſent of him reported y• ſame (for the Angells of God were alike in the ſight of the traitors) at length he went thither himſelfe with great power for to knowe the certainety of the wonderfull ſight. He perceauinge of a ſurety that it was an army of ſouldiers, hiding themſelues in the day time and withſtanding his violēce in the night ſeaſon, went about to compaſſe a crafty feate as he thought, whereby he might greatly hurt the Romaynes, but as the euent declared, it auayled them very much. He fained himſelfe to be poſſeſſed of a Deuell and therefore he got him to the Church of Saynct Iohn the Apoſtle which

was not farre frō the citie there for to pray. The Barbarians went forth wt him conueying armour priuely in tunnes and veſſells, coueringe them alſo with other ſleyghtes and deuiſes. When the watch &amp; porters of the citie gats perecaued theyr wile &amp; treaſon, they commaunded them to carye forth no weapons: the Barbarians hearinge this drewe theyr ſwords and diſpatched thē euery one. Immediately all the citie was on an vprore and death ſeemed to ſtande at euery mans dore. Yet for all that, the citie was ſafe the gates on euery ſide beinge ſhutte and well fortified. The Emperour aduiſinge himſelfe in tyme proclaimed Gainas a traitor and an open enemy 
                           •
                         he commaunded that the Barbarians which remayned in the citie ſhoulde be ſlayne euery one: this was the day after the death of the porters: the ſouldiers within the walls of the citie nigh the Gotthicke church (for there all the Barbarians were aſſembled together) dealt hande to hande with the Barbarians ſet the Churche on ſire and ſlewe manye of them. Gainas hearinge that as many of his complices as he left behinde with in the citie were executed, and perceauing that his traiterous conſpiracye had no proſperous ſucceſſe, left his hypocriticall prayers &amp; got him to the coaſts of Thracia. And comming into Cherroneſus he tooke ſhippinge thence in all the haſt to Lampſacum for to ſubdue from that place forewards all the Weſterne partes of the worlde. When the Emperour had preuented him in thoſe countreyes by ſending thither great power both by ſea and by land: it fel out y• God of his prouidence ſhewed there his wonderfull power the ſecond tyme. For when the Barbarians wanted ſhippes, they fell a framinge of newe veſſells and ſo to tranſporte ſouldiers in them. The Romayne nauye came thither and ariued at the very pinche or as commonly we ſaye in the nicke for they had winde and ſayle at will, the Weſterne Zephyrus blewe on theyr ſide. And as the Romayne power conueyed themſelues thither with eaſe and pleaſure: ſo the greater parte of the Barbarian nauye, bothe horſe and man ſhippes and all were toſſed to and fro, ſcattered one from the other and ſuncke in the deepe gulphes of the ſurginge waues of the ſeaes. Diuerſe alſo of the Romaines were drowned alike. And thus there was then an infinite number of the Barbarians deſtroyed.Gainas was ſlayne Anno Dom. 404. But Gainas remouinge thence taking his flight by Thracia lighted by chaunce into the hands of the Romaine ſouldiers which diſpatched both him &amp; alſo as many Barbarians as were in his company. This muche by the waye of Gainas. If any be diſpoſed to knowe all the circumſtances of that battaile lette him reade the booke of Euſebius Scholaſticus intitled Gainias, who at that tyme was the diſciple of Troylus the Sophiſte. This man beinge preſent in the warres wrote in Hexameter verſe all that there in was done &amp; deuided it into foure bookes. And becauſe the acts thereof were freſhe in memorye his poeme was of greate price and eſtimation. Ammonius alſo the Poete of late dayes wrote the ſame argumente in verſe, the whiche he reade in the hearinge of the Emperoure aboute the eleuenth Conſulſhippe of Theodoſius the Yonger the which he enioyed with Fauſtus, and therefore was highely commended. This battaile was ended in the Conſulſhippe of Stilichon and Aurelianus. The yeare followinge Phranitus was made Conſul, who thoughe he were a Gotth borne, yet was he greatly beloued of the Romaynes, he behaued himſelfe ſo valiauntly in that battaile that the Romaynes thoughte him worthye the dignitye of a Conſull. The ſame yeare and the tenth daye of Aprill the Emperour Arcadius had a ſonne to wit: the good Theodoſius.

There was a queſtion broched a litle before, whether God were a bodye and made after the likeneſſe and forme of man? Or whether he were without bodye and not onely without the forme of man, but alſo (as I maye vtter the wholl in one worde) voyde of all corporall ſhape? Hereof there roſe ſundry contentions and quarells whileſt yt ſome affirmed this, other ſome that. Certen of the rudeſt &amp; vnlearned ſorte of religious mē thought y• God was corporeal &amp; that he was of the forme and figure of man, but the greater parte condemned them with theyr hereticall opinion,

affirming that God had no corporeall ſubſtance, that he was voyd of all bodly ſhape. Of the which opiniō was Theophilus Biſhop of Alexandria ſo that in the hearing of the wholl congregation he inueyed bitterly agaynſt ſuche as attributed vnto God the forme of man where he proued that he had no bodye at all. The worſhippers of Aegypt vnderſtandinge of this lefte theyre religious houſes, came to Alexandria, flocked about Theophilus, condemned him for a wicked perſon and foughte to bereaue him of his life. Theophilus beinge made priueye vnto theyr conſpiracie was wonderfull penſiue, deuiſed with himſelfe howe he mighte eſcape theyr handes and ſaue his life. As ſoone as he came into theyre preſence he ſaluted them curteouſlye and ſayde thus vnto them: When that I laſten myne eyes vpon you me thinkes I doe ſee the liuely face of God. With theſe words the raſh heat of the vnruely monkes was delayed. Againe they replie in this ſorte: If that be true that thou ſayeſt that the countenance of God is no otherwiſe then ours, why then accurſe the workes of Origen. For diuerſe of his bookes doe impugne our opinion. But incaſe thou refuſe to doe this, aſſure thy ſelfe to receaue at our handes the puniſhment due vnto the impious and open enemy of God. Nay ſayth Theophilus I will doe that which ſhall ſeeme right well in your

When he had thus appeaſed the monkes he ſent them away quietly. This queſtion peraduenture had layen in the duſt vnto this daye, had it not bene blowen vp &amp; reuiued vpon an other occaſion in ſuch ſorte as followeth. The religious houſes in Aegypt were ouerſeene of foure worthy men, Dioſcorus, Ammonius, Euſebius and Euthymius. Theſe men were naturall bretherne and by reaſon of the goodly ſtature of theyr taule bodies they were called Longe. Men they were of greate fame for theyre doctrine and godly trade of life. And therefore at Alexandria they were muche ſpoken of. Theophilus Biſhop of Alexandria loued them entirely and made muche of them. Wherefore one of them whoſe name was Dioſcorus he in maner conſtrayned to leaue the deſerte and made him Biſhoppe of Hermopolis, two of the other he entreated to leade theyr liues with him. The which he coulde hardely with fayre meanes obtayne yet as Biſhop he compelled them. The men makinge a vertue of neceſſitye in ſo much they coulde not otherwiſe chooſe applied themſelues about the eccleſiaſticall affaires: yet it grieued them very much that they coulde not at theyr pleaſure adict themſelues vnto the ſollitary life and the wonted exerciſe of true Philoſophie.

And moreouer he beganne to ſpite Dioſcorus theyr brother whome he had made Biſhop of Hermopolis.

But Theophilus for all that he was himſelfe of that opinion: yet to the end he might reuenge him of his enemies ſticked not to oppugne their ſyncere opinion &amp; ſound doctrine: yea he perſwaded many Monkes ſimple and plaine ſoules ſuch as were idiotes and diuerſe alſo of them which were altogether vnlearned to cleaue vnto his ſide. He ſent vnto the religious houſes of the deſert that they ſhoulde obey neither Dioſcorus neither his brethren in ſo much their opinion was that God had no body. For God (ſaith he) as holy ſcripture doth witneſſe hath eyes, eares, handes and feete euen as men haue. Dioſcorus and his followeres (ſayth he) are of a wicked opinion: they denye with Origen that God hath eyes, eares, feete and handes. With this ſubtle and crafty ſleighte he allured to his ſide many of the religious men: ſo that there roſe much adoe and great diſſention among them. Such as were not be witched but guided themſelues

The cōfederats of Theophilus called their brethren Origeniſts &amp; wicked men: againe, the complices of Theophilus were called Anthropomorphits, by interpretation ſuch as attribute to God the forme of man, ſo that there roſe no ſmall bickering among the monkes, nay it fell out to be a deadly battaile. Theophilus perceauinge that his fetches framed at length after his will, went with great power towards the mount Nitria, where their religious houſes ſtoode, and ayded the monkes both againſt Dioſcorus, and alſo againſt his brethren. The religious men being beſet with great daunger, had much adoe to ſaue their liues.

The Arians as we ſayd before, had their conuenticles without y• walls of the citie in the ſuburbs. Wherfore when the feſtiuall meeting throughout euery weeke was come, I meane the Saturday, and the Sunday, vpon which dayes the Chriſtians are wont ſolemnly to aſſemble in the church, they (I meane the Arians) gathering thē ſelues together in the porche of y• citie gates, ſonge interchaungeably ſuch ſonges as they had made them ſelues, and ſauoured of the Arian opinion, and this they did almoſt throughout the whole night. Firſt of all they were wont at the dawning of the daye to goe out at the gates, and to ſinge Antemne wiſe ſuch lewde ſongs through the midds of the citie, vntill they came to the place of their aſſembled congregation. But in ſo much they ceaſſed not to ſounde out contumelious ſentences agaynſt ſuch as fauored the faith of One ſubſtance, (for among diuers others this was one: Where be theſe felowes which affirme three to be but one power?) Iohn fearinge leſt any of the ſimpler ſorte ſhoulde be ſnared, and leſt theſe opprobrious rymes woulde be ſtumblinge blockes and occaſions to fall from the faith: ordayned of the contrary certaine of his owne people, which in like ſort ſhoulde occupie them ſelues in the nyght in ſinginge of hymnes, partly for to quell the inſolencie of the Arians, &amp; partly alſo for to confirme their owne ſide in the faith. And for all the meaninge of Iohn was good, and his dryft auaylable, yet the ende proued very troubleſome and perillous. For when the hymnes extolled the faith of One ſubſtance, and purchaſed greate maieſtie and reuerence, becauſe of the melodious concent and ſweete harmonie in the nyght ſeaſon (for there were ſiluer candleſticks after the maner of croſſes, deuiſed for the bearinge of the tapers and waxe candels, all which Eudoxia the Empreſſe founde vnto them) the Arians flocked together, burned with emulation, and for to reuenge them ſelues, ſett vpon their aduerſaries. And becauſe that a little before their ſide had preuayled and gott the vpper hande, they were then ſwollen with pride, and egerly bent to take armour, and made no accompt at all of ſuch as fauoured the faith of One ſubſtance. Wherefore without further deliberation, on a certaine night they made an vprore. In this ſkirmiſhe Briſo an Eunuch of the Empreſſe, and a fauourer of the hymnes that were ſong in the commendation of the clauſe Of one ſubſtance, was taken in the forehead with a ſtone. diuers of the common ſort were ſlayne of ether ſide.

Ignatius biſhop Antioche in Syria, the thirde biſhop by ſucceſſion from Peter the Apoſtle, who was conuerſant and had great familiaritie with the Apoſtles, ſaw a viſion of Angells, which extolled the bleſſed Trinitie with hymnes that were ſonge interchaungeably: and deliuered vnto the church of Antioche the order and maner of ſinging expreſſed in the viſion. thereof it came to paſſe, that euery church receaued the ſame tradition.

                        Of the Monkes that were called longe, and howe that about them Theophilus biſhop of Alexandria purſued Iohn byſhop of Constantinople with deadly hatred, and fought to depoſe him: howe Epiphanius biſhop of Cyprus, being wonne through the wiles of Theophilus, called a Councell at Cyprus, condemned the workes of Origen, and reprehended Iohn for peruſinge of them.
                     
                     SHortly after the Monkes left the deſert, and came together with Dioſcorus and his brethren vnto Conſtantinople. There came thither alſo with them Iſidorus, the great friend ſomtime of Theophilus, but then his deadly foe, &amp; ſo became vpon ſuch an occaſion as followeth. Theophilus conceauing great diſpleaſure againſt one Peter head prieſt in the church of Alexandria, determined to baniſhe him the churche: he charged him that he had receaued into the communion a woman of the hereticall ſect of the Manichees, before he had conuerted her. But when Peter auoutched that he both withdrewe her from that hereticall opinion, and admitted her alſo into the churche with the conſent of Theophilus, makinge him priuye therevnto: Theophilus ſtomaked the dealing, as if Peter had done it in ſpite of him. For he ſayde that he knewe nothing of it. Wherfore Peter called Iſidorus to witneſſe, that Theophilus the biſhop knewe of the womans admiſſion. Iſidorus then was at the princely citie of Rome, for Theophilus had ſent him vnto Damaſus biſhop of Rome, for to reconcile vnto him Flauianus biſhop of Antioche. For as many as were of Meletius ſide, fell from Flauianus, becauſe he kept not his othe, as we ſayde before. Iſidorus then immediatly after his returne from Rome, beyng called of Peter to beare wittneſſe, affirmed playnly that the woman which had bene of the Manichees opinion, was receaued by the conſent of Theophilus the byſhop, and that he him ſelfe had miniſtred the communion vnto her. Theophilus hearinge this, fretted within him ſelfe for anger, and thruſt them both out of the church. This was y• cauſe that made Iſidore to accompanie Dioſcorus into Conſtantinople: that both in preſence of the Emperour and Iohn the biſhop, the ſleyghts and wyles which Theophilus practiſed againſt them myght be reuealed. Iohn vnderſtanding theſe circumſtances of them, entertayned the men with great reuerence, made them partakers of their common and publique prayers, but he woulde not receaue them into the communion, before that firſte he had throughly examined their cauſe. When theſe thinges were thus come to paſſe, it was falſely reported vnto Theophilus, that Iohn both receaued them into the communion, and was alſo ready to take their part. Wherefore Theophilus endeuoured with might and mayne, not onely to reuenge him of Dioſcorus and Iſidorus, but alſo to thruſte Iohn beſides his biſhopricke, and therevpon he ſent letters vnto the biſhops throughout euery citie, where he concealed his principall drift, pretending onely vnto them, that he miſliked with the works of Origen, whence Athanaſius before his tyme borowed teſtimonies to the confutation of the Arians. 
                        Cap. 10. in the Greeke. Epiphanius ſome tyme thought that God had a bodie. Moreouer he reconciled and lynked him ſelfe with Epiphanius biſhop of Conſtantia, a citie of Cyprus, with whome aforetyme he had iarred and bene at variance. For Theophilus had charged him a litle before, that he thought of God baſely and abiectly, attributing to him ye forme or ſhape of man. And for all that Theophilus was of this opinion, and accuſed them which beleued that God had the figure of man: yet for the hatred and ſpite he owed vnto others, he denyed openly in word that which he beleeued ſecretly in minde: and linked vnto him Epiphanius in the league of friendſhip, who lately had bene his foe, but then as it were repented him of his folly, ioyned withA Councell held in Cyprus, where of ſpite through the procurement of Theophi

Through his ayde and furtherance he purpoſed to ſummone a Councell at Cyprus, for the condemning and rooting out of Origens workes. Epiphanius beinge a vertuous and a godly man, was eaſily perſwaded therevnto by the letters of Theophilus. To be ſhort, the biſhops of that Iſle aſſembled together, and decreed that thenceforth none ſhoulde reade the workes of Origen: moreouer they write vnto Iohn biſhop of Conſtantinople, exhortinge him to abſtayne from peruſinge the bookes of Origen, requeſting him alſo to ſummone a Councell, and to ratifie the ſame with vniforme conſent of them all. When Theophilus had ſnared Epiphanius (a man of greate fame and renowme) to his ſide, and perceaued that his fetches nowe framed according vnto his owne deſire, he dealt more boldly, &amp; ſummoned a ſynode within his owne prouince, where (euen as Epiphanius had done before) he condēned the works of Origen, which had departed this life about two hundred yeares before him, this was not his principall drifte, but he purpoſed verely to reuenge him this waye of Dioſcorus and his brethren. Iohn made ſmall accompt of the

thinges which Epiphanius and Theophilus had ſignified vnto him by their letters, for he occupyed him ſelfe to the furtherance and profit of the churches, and therin he excelled: as for the conſpiracie &amp; miſchiefe intended agaynſt him, he made very light of it. As ſoone as it was openly knowen and manifeſtly perceaued, that Theophilus bent all his myght to depoſe Iohn of his biſhopricke, diuers that bare Iohn ill will fell a deuiſinge and a forginge out of falſe crimes and accuſations agaynſt him. Many of the cleargie, ſundry alſo of the magiſtrates which were in great fauour with the Emperour, ſuppoſing now they had gotten fit opportunitie to reuenge them of Iohn, determined with them ſelues partly by writinge of letters, and partly alſo by ſendinge of meſſengers to ſummone together at Conſtantinople a great Councell of byſhops.

                        Of Seuerianus and Antiochus the Syrians: howe, and vpon what occaſion they fell from Iohn.
                     
                     AN other thinge gaue occaſion to encreaſe the hatred and ill will owed vnto Iohn, in ſuche ſort as followeth. There were two biſhops by byrth Syrians, which floriſhed at one tyme, the ones name was Seuerianus, the other Antiochus: the one was biſhop of Gabale in Syria, the other of Ptolemais in Phoenicia, both excelled in the gift of vtterāce, but Seuerianus although he were learned, yet pronounced he not the Greeke tōgue diſtinetly neither ſkilfully, for he ſpakeAn olde cuſtome to take money for preaching, if the gayne were not ſweete I warrant you at this day the cuſtome would be leſt Greeke as a Grecian, yet pronounced it like a Syrian. Antiochus
                         cōming from Ptolemais to Cō
                           ſtantinople, continewed there a while, and preached with great diligēce: after that therby he had got vnto him ſelfe good ſtore of money, he returned home to his owne church. Seuerianus hearing that Antiochus had got much money by preachinge at Conſtantinople, was very deſirous to doe the like him ſelfe. He exerciſed him ſelfe diligently, he patched together a great companie of booſome ſermons, and came to Conſtantinople. Being there friendly &amp; louingly entertained of Iohn, he applied him ſelfe craftely for a while to pleaſe Iohn, and gott greate fauour by flatterie. He was much ſet by, and in great eſtimation: and as he was highly cōmended for preaching, ſo in like maner purchaſed he vnto him ſelfe great credit with the chiefe magiſtrates and wt the Emperour. In the meane ſpace becauſe that the biſhop of Epheſus was departed this life, Iohn of neceſſitie was cōſtrained to take his voyage into Epheſus for to chuſe there a biſhop. After his comming thither when that ſome would haue this man, &amp; ſome that man preferred to the rowme, and thervpon fell to bitter words &amp; contention, whileſt that euery one would haue his friend aduaunced to the dignitie: Iohn perceauing that they were all ſet on tumults, and that by no meanes they would be ruledHeraclides. b. of Epheſus. by him, endeuoured to ende the quarell without offending of either ſide. He aſſigned one Heraclides a deacon of his church, yet borne in Cyprus, to be biſhop. With that both parts were pleaſed, and gaue ouer contention. Iohn was faine for this matter to continewe a greate while at Epheſus. In his abſence Seuerianus had brought his auditors at Conſtantinople to beare him farre better good will then euer they did before, neyther was Iohn ignorant of this, for it was tolde him quickly. When Serapion, of whome I ſpake before, had ſignified vnto Iohn, that Seuerianus had deuided the churches, he forthwith was kyndled with the flame of contention. Wherefore when as he had not fully ended all ſuch thinges as he determined with him ſelfe (for he had depriued 
                           •
                        oth the Nouatians, and ſuch as celebrated the feaſt of Eaſter the fourteenth day of the moneth, of many churches) he returned to Conſtantinople, and applyed him ſelfe after his vſuall maner vnto the ouerſight of the eccleſiaſticall affayres. The inſolent diſdayne and hautie ſtomacke of Serapion was intollerable, for he bouldened him ſelfe vpon Iohn, and inueyed contumeliouſly without all modeſtie and ſhamefaſtneſſe agaynſte all men, which turned to the encreaſe of the ſpite and hatred borne vnto Iohn. Moreouer when Seuerianus on a certaine tyme came to the placeSeuerall functions haue ſeuerall reuerence. where Serapion ſate: Serapion gaue him not the honor and reuerence dewe vnto a biſhop, neyther roſe vp, in ſo doing he declared that he regarded not the perſon of Seuerianus. This contempt and diſdayne of Serapion was not taken paciently of Seuerianus, for he exclaimed againſt him in theſe wordes: If Serapion dyeth a Chriſtian, then was Chriſt neuer incarnate. Serapion tooke this as a fitte occaſion miniſtred vnto him, made Iohn to become his foe, whileſt that he concealed the firſte ſentence, to wete, If Serapion dyeth a Chriſtian, and repeated the later, to wete, that Chriſt was neuer incarnate, affirming y• he heard it of Seuerianus owne mouth. And to the end he woulde iuſtifie the reporte, he brought forth men of his owne degree and callinge to teſtifie that they

heard the words. To be ſhort, Iohn without any more adoe baniſhed Seuerianus the citie. Eudoxia the Empreſſe vnderſtanding of the circumſtance founde great fault with Iohn, cauſed Seuerianus to be ſent for out of Chalcedon in Bithynia, who came immediately. Iohn kept him ſelfe ont of his companie, he woulde not be brought with any mans entreatie and perſwaſion to become friendes with Seuerianus. At length when that Eudoxia the Emperours mother in the Apoſtles churche, had throwen her ſonne Theodoſius the Emperour (who though he were then of tender yeares, yet gouerned he ye common wealth with good ſucceſſe, and proſperous ouerſight) at the feete of Iohn, and craued of him with ſolemne proteſtations, that of all loue and friendſhip he woulde not denye her requeſt: with muche adoe he was wonne to embrace Seuerianus agayne. But for all that outwardly they bare a ſhewe and a countenance of friendſhip: neuertheleſſe inwardly they continewed their ſpite and hatred one towards the other. The cauſe that deuided Iohn and Seuerianus was in ſuch ſort.

                        Howe that Epiphanius comming to Constantinople, celebrated the communion, &amp; gaue orders without the licence of Iohn, therein to gratifie Theophilus.
                     
                     SHortly after, Epiphanius the biſhop came from Cyprus to Conſtantinople, at the requeſt of Theophilus, and brought thither with him the decree of the biſhops, where he had not excommunicated Origen, but onely condemned his bookes. Wherefore after his comming into the church of Sainct Iohn, which was not farre from the walls of the citie, he celebrated the cōmunion, made a deacon, went forth out of the churche, and came to Conſtantinople. When that Iohn had inuited him, requeſting he woulde take a peece of a lodging with him, he for to feede the humor of Theophilus, refuſed his curteſie, and tooke vp an Inne by him ſelfe. After that he had called together the biſhops which then by chaunce were at Conſtantinople, he read in their hearinge the decree, where he had condemned the works of Origen. Of the bookes I haue nothing to ſay, but thus muche, that it pleaſed Epiphanius and Theophilus to condemne them. Of the byſhops ſome for reuerence of Epiphanius ſubſcribed vnto the decree: ſome other denyed it vtterly. Of which number Theotimus biſhop of Scythia made Epiphanius this anſwere. I of myne owne part, ô Epiphanius
                        
                        Theotimus biſhop of Scythia. 
                        will not ſo much iniurie the man, who is departed to reſt many yeares agoe: neither dare I preſume once to enterpriſe ſo haynous an offence, for to condemne the bookes whiche our auncetors haue not condemned, ſpecially ſeeyng I vnderſtande not as yet, neither read any parcell of the doctrine within contayned. And when that a certaine booke of Origen was brought forth, he read it, and ſhewed there the interpretation of holy ſcripture, agreeable vnto the faith of the catholicke churche: laſt of all he concluded with theſe wordes: They that reprehende theſe things, doe no leſſe then miſlike vvith the matter vvhereof theſe bookes doe intreat. This was the anſwere of Theotimus vnto Epiphanius, a man he was of great fame both for ſound doctrine, and godly conuerſation.

Obſcure men, odde felowes, ſuch as haue no pythe or ſubſtance in them, to the ende they myght become famous, goe about moſte commonly to purchaſe vnto them ſelues glorie and renowme by diſprayſing of ſuch men as farre excell them in all rare and ſingular vertues. Of which ſort of backebiters firſt I remember Methodius biſhop of Olympus, a citie of Lycia: next Eustathius, who for a while was biſhop of Antioch: thirdly Apolinarius: laſt of all this Theophilus. This meſſe of raylers (if I may ſo tearme them) fell a ſclaūdering of Origē, neither yet all for one thing. One charged him with this, an other with that, wherby they all ſeuerally declared vnto the world, that they allowed wholly all ſuch thinges in him as they had not reprehended by name. For in as much they blamed him ſeuerally for ſeuerall doctrine, it appeareth they tooke that for trueth in him, which they concealed and miſliked not withall: and they approued in very deede that which they denyed not in worde. Methodius though at the beginning he inueyed bitterly againſt Origen, yet afterwardes as it were by way of recantation he extolled him vnto the ſkies in that dialogue, which he intitled Zeno. Their reuiling in myne opinion encreaſed the renowne &amp; fame of Origen.
                        
For while they charged him with haynous crimes, as they thought, and yet findinge no faulte with him as toutching the bleſſed Crinitie: they are witneſſes them ſelues that he was of y• right and ſound faith. Euen as theſe men being not able iuſtly to accuſe him, beare witnes wt him of his true beliefe: ſo Athanaſius voyd of all parcialitie, a zealous maintayner of the clauſe Of one ſubſtance, alleageth him for a witneſſe of his faith in the orations which he wrote to the cōfutation ofAthanaſius teſtimony of Origen. the Arians, citeth his words for teſtimonies among his works, &amp; ſayth thus of him. That notable man &amp; that paynfull writer Origen, confirmeth in plaine words the faith &amp; opinion we haue of the ſonne of God, in that he auoutcheth him to be coaeternall with the father. Wherefore ſuch as goe about to reuile Origen, they vnwares doe ſclaunder Athanaſius, which hyghly commended him. Thus much by the way of Origen, and nowe againe to the ſtorie.

                        How that Iohn ſent for Epiphanius to come vnto him, and charged him that he had behaued him ſelfe contrary to the canons of the church: after they had brawled a while together, Epiphanius returned homewards.
                     
                     
                        IOhn at the firſt tooke not the matter very grieuouſly, for all that Epiphanius contrary to the canon had made a Deacon in his church: but requeſted him to accept as a ſimple lodging a peece of the byſhops pallace. Epiphanius anſwered him in this ſorte: I will neyther lye with thee, neyther praye together with thee, vnleſſe thou both baniſhe Dioſcorus with his brethren out of the citie, and alſo ſubſcribe with thine owne hande vnto the decree which condemneth the works of Origen. When that Iohn pauſed vpon the matter, and ſayde that he ought not raſhly, neyther without good aduiſement determine any thinge of that matter, afore that he had generally examined, and that narrowly, the whole circumſtance: the aduerſaries of Iohn ſet Epiphanius otherwiſe on worke. For at the celebration of the bleſſed and holie Communion in the churche commonly called the Apoſtles, they ſette Epiphanius in the myddeſt: they cauſe him in the open audience to condemne the workes of Origen, to excommunicate Dioſcorus and his brethren, laſte of all to rebuke Iohn for takinge of their parte. When Iohn hearde of this, he ſent vnto Epiphanius, who the daye followinge was at churche, this meſſage by Serapion: Epiphanius, thou doeſt
                        
                        The meſſage which Chryſoſtome ſent vnto Epiphanius. The cōtention betwene two aunciēt fathers, Epiphanius. b. of Cōſtantia in Cyprus, and Iohn Chryſoſtome. b. of Conſtantinople. 
                        manie thinges contrarie to the Canons: firſte in that thou haſt preſumed to make miniſters vvithin my Dioceſſe: ſecondly in that thou haſt miniſtred the Communion of thyne ovvne heade vvithout my licence: agayne in that thou dyddeſt refuſe it vvhen I requeſted thee, and novve thou doeſt it of thy ſelfe. VVherefore take heede leſt the people ſtomacke thy dealinge, and be ſett on an vprore, if ought come amyſſe thou haſt thy remedie in thy hande. Epiphanius
                         receauinge this meſſage, was ſtrucken with ſodayne feare, left the church, inueyed bitterly agaynſt Iohn, and tooke ſhippinge towards Cyprus. The reporte goeth, that as he went downe to the rode to take ſhipping, he prophecied thus of Iohn: I hope thou shalt neuer dye a bishop,
                         &amp; that Iohn anſwered him thus againe: I hope thou shat neuer come aliue into thy contrey. Whether they that told mee theſe things, reported truely, I am not able to ſay: but ſure I am that it fell to ether euen as eche one wiſhed to the other. For neyther came Epiphanius aliue to Cyprus, (he dyed on the ſeas by the way) neyther dyed Iohn a biſhop, for he was depoſed and baniſhed the church, as hereafter ſhall more manifeſtly appeare.

                        Howe that after the departure of Epiphanius, Iohn made a ſermon agaynſt allwomen, which made both the Emperour and the Empreſſe to ſummone a Councell at Chalcedon, where Iohn was depoſed: In his abſence the people made much adoe, &amp; to appeaſe them Iohn is called home to Conſtantinople againe.
                     
                     AS ſoone as Epiphanius had hoyſed vp ſayle, reporte came vnto Iohn that Eudoxia the EmpreſſeChriſoſtom made a ſermon againſ all women. had bolſtered Epiphanius againſt him, he beinge very hot and a haſty man of nature, euer ready, for his gift of vtterance did ſo ſerue him, immediatly went vp into the pulpitt, made a whole ſermon in the diſpraiſe of all women. The multitude tooke it in the worſt part, as if therby he had determined ſecretly to pay home y• Empreſſe. The ſermon was borne away of illwillers and brought to the Emperour: the Empreſſe alſo hearinge therof, complayned vnto the

Emperour, that therein ſhe was contuineliouſly dealte withall, and that the reproche thereof redounded alſo vnto him. Wherfore ſhe worketh through Theophilus to ſummone a councell againſt Iohn, Seuerianus likewiſe went about the ſame, neither was the dealing of Iohn towards him as yet gone out of his ſtomacke. Shortly after Theophilus came thither, who called together at the Emperours commaundement many biſhops out of diuers cities. But aboue all other men they came thither apace, which for diuers quarells owed Iohn a diſpleaſure. They alſo came thither whome Iohn had depoſed &amp; put by their biſhopricks▪ for he had depriued many of the biſhops in Aſia in the voyage he made to Epheſus, at what time he made Heraclides biſhop. wherfore wt one cōſent theyThe coūcell of Chalcedō for the depoſing of Chryſoſtome. meete all at Chalcedō
                         a citie of Bithynia. At that time Cyrinus an Aegyptiā
                         borne, being biſhop of Chalcedō, inueyed bitterly againſt Iohn in preſence of all y• biſhops, he reported of him y• he was a wicked mā, that he was an arrogāt &amp; a ſollyne biſhop. the reſt of y• biſhops were glad of that. But Maruthas biſhop of Meſopotamia trode againſt his will on Cyrinus foote, and hurt him ſore. The broiſe ſo encreaſed &amp; pained Cyrinus ſo much, y• he could not goe wt the reſt of the biſhops to Cōſtā
                           tinople, but taryed behind at Chalcedō, the reſt ſayled to Cōſtantinople. When as none of y• clergie of Conſtantinople went forth to meete Theophilus, neither exhibited vnto him the accuſtomed honor and reuerence, (for then all beganne to hate him) the matiners of Alexandria, who then by chaunce were there, and had brought corne to Conſtantinople, went to meete him, and receaued him with gladſome ſhoutes. He went not to the houſe of prayer, but vnto the Empreſſe pallace called Placidia. Then the aduerſaries of Iohn went about to forge many falſe accuſations agaynſt him, they brabble no longer about the bookes of Origen, but they take other abſurde matters in hande. When theſe thinges were thus adoynge, the Biſhops aſſembled together in the ſuburbs of Chalcedon in a place called the Oke: immediately they cite thyther Iohn for to anſwere vnto ſuch crimes as he was charged withall.

When Iohn had excepted agaynſt ſuch as had cited him thither, as his open enemies, he appealed from them vnto a generall Councell: they without any other circumſtance called him foure tymes. And ſeeyng that he would not come, but ſent them ſtill the ſame anſwere: they proceeded againſt him, they condemned and depoſed him of his biſhoprick, for no other crime but becauſe he being cited would not appeare. When tydings thereof about euentyde were brought to Conſtantinople, the whole citie was on an vprore. Wherefore they watched all nyght, they would not ſuffer him to be thruſt out of the churche, they exclaimed that his cauſe ought to haue bene hearde in a greater aſſemblie of Biſhops. But the Emperours commaundement was, that as ſoone as he were remoued, he ſhoulde be conueyed to exile. This beyng knowen for certayntie, Iohn the thirde day after his depoſition, about noone vnknowinge to the multitude (for he was loth there ſhoulde be any adoe forChryloſtome e

The people were all ſette on fyrie ſedition, and as it commonly falleth out in ſuche hurlyburlies, many of them which aforetyme purſued him with deadly hatred, then chaunginge theyre mind, pitied his caſe: many others who lately deſired to ſee his depriuation, reported then that he was craftely dealt withall, and falſely accuſed. Many cryed out agaynſte the Emperour, and exclaimed at the Councell: but aboue all others they inueyed agaynſt Theophilus, who was knowen to haue bene the author of all that treacherie and malicious ſclaunders rayſed of Iohn. For the cō

Seuerianus alſo as he preached in the church, thought now he had fit opportunitie geuen him to inuey againſt Iohn: he ſayde playnely though Iohn were conuicted of no crime, yet was he iuſtly depoſed for his inſolent and hautie behauiour: that all ſinnes were to be forgiuen, yet as holy ſcripture bare witneſſe, that God reſiſted the proude. With the hearinge of theſe and ſuche lyke contumelious phraſes recited, the people was the more prone to contention. Wherefore the Emperour in all the haſt cauſed Iohn agayne to be ſent for, and to returne to Conſtantinople. Briſo

When that he lyngered from returnynge into the Cytie, the multitude tooke it grieuouſlye,

and forthwith fell a reuilinge of the Magiſtrates. Wherefore of neceſſitie he was conſtrayned to come home: the people went forth to meete him, they bring him to the church wt great reuerence, they requeſt him to continew their biſhop, and thenceforth after the vſuall maner to praye for the peace and proſperous eſtate of the church of God. When that he refuſed ſo to doe, and pleaded for him ſelfe, that it muſt not ſo be afore his cauſe were hearde of indifferent Iudges, &amp; the depoſers had chaunged their mind &amp; abſolued him: they were the more deſirous, for they longed to ſee him ſtalled againe in the biſhops ſeae, and preache afreſhe vnto the people. To be ſhort the people cō
                        pelled him ſo to doe. When that Iohn was placed in the biſhops ſeate, and prayed after the accuſtoined maner for peace vnto the people and congregations throughout the worlde: he was conſtrayned alſo to preache. The which thinge miniſtred occaſion vnto the aduerſaries to accuſe him againe, although for a while they ſuffred it to lye for deade.

                        Howe that when Theophilus woulde haue Heraclides matter hearde in his abſence, and Iohn reſisted it: the citizens of Constantinople and Alexandria went together by the eares, ſo that Theophilus with other biſhops was fayne to leaue the citie and flye away.
                     
                     IN the meane ſpace Theophilus went craftely aboute for to call into queſtion the conſecratinge of Heraclides: to the ende he myght thereby, if it were poſſible, finde matter to charge Iohn afreſhe, and ſo to depoſe him the ſeconde tyme. Heraclides for all he was not preſent, yet they proceede againſte him: they laye to his charge, that he had iniuſtly puniſhed certaine perſons, impriſoned them, laſt of all lead them throughout the open ſtreetes of Epheſus to be ignominiouſly derided. When Iohn made anſwere, that of ryght no man ought to be iudged in his abſence, without the preſence of the partie, and the hearinge of his owne cauſe: the people of Alexandria brged very earneſtly that the accuſers of Heraclides were to be hearde, for all he him ſelfe were abſent. Herevpon there roſe greate ſtrife and contention betweene the citizens of Conſtantinople, and the inhabitants of Alexandria. And while they ſkirmiſhe one with the other, many were ſore wounded, and diuers alſo preſently diſpatched. When the heade of this combatt was paſt, and the trueth come to light, Theophilus gott him in all the haſt to Alexandria, the other biſhops ranne likewiſe away, fewe onely excepted which helde with Iohn, and repaired euery one to his owne biſhopricke. After that theſe thinges were thus come to paſſe, euery man was readie to ſpeake ill of Theophilus. The hatred grew and increaſed agaynſt him dayly, becauſe he ſticked not ſtudiouſly to peruſe the workes of Origen ſecretly, though openly he condemned them. And being demaunded why he made ſo much of the bookes he had lately condemned: his anſwere was, that the bookes of Origen were like meddowes clad with euery kinde of flowers: therefore (ſayeth he) if I finde in them ought that is good, I cull it out, if otherwiſe bryers or brambles, I ſett nought by them, becauſe of their prickes. This was the anſwere of Theophilus, when he called not to remembrance the ſaying of the wiſe man: that the wordes and counſells of ſages reſemble very much prickingeEccleſiaſtes. 12 thornes, and that ſuch as are toutched therewith, ought not to kicke agaynſte the pricke. The aforeſayde cauſes made Theophilus to be hated of all men. Dioſcorus Biſhop of Hermopolis, one of theſe religious men which commonly were called Longe, departed this lyfe ſhortly after the departure of Theophilus into Alexandria, and enioyed an honorable funerall at the Church called the Oke, where the Councell was ſummoned for the hearinge of Iohns cauſe. Iohn gaue him ſelfe wholly to teache and to preache vnto the people: he made Serapion, who had procured vnto him great hatred, biſhop of Heraclea a citie of Thracia.

                        Howe the picture of Eudoxia was erected all of ſiluer with playes and ſpectacles: Iohn reprehended the authors that did the whole, &amp; was therfore baniſhed.
                     
                     SHortly after ſuch things as followe enſued. A ſiluer picture (couered with a mantell) of Eudoxia the Empreſſe was ſet vp vpon a pillour of redd marble. The place of this erected pillour was not very nygh the church called VViſdome, neither very farte of, onely the broade ſtreete went betwene the picture &amp; the church. There were cōmon playes &amp; ſhowes (as the maner

was) celebrated. Iohn ſuppoſing verely that theſe things redounded to the great ſclaunder and infamie of Chriſtian religion, not forgetting his wonted audacitie and libertie of ſpeache, prepared him ſelfe for the authors therof: and in ſteede of the exhortation he ſhould haue vſed to the perſwaſion, or rather the reformation of the princes and magiſtrates, he ſkoffed with nipping tauntes at ſuch as had cauſed thoſe vanities to be ſolemnized. The Empreſſe likewiſe applying theſe things to her ſelfe, ſuppoſing that all was vttered to her diſgrace and reproche, procured an other Councell of biſhops to be called together agaynſt him. Iohn vnderſtanding of this, made that famous &amp; notable ſermon in the church, which beginneth in this ſort: Herodias rageth afreshe, ſtomacketh
                        
                        A Councell aſſembled at Conſtantinople for the depoſition of Chryſoſtome 
                        anewe, daunceth againe: ſeeketh as yet the head of Iohn in a platter. This ſermon made the Empreſſe mad, ſet her on fire againſt him. Not long after the biſhops met there together, Leontius biſhop of Ancyra in Galatia the leſſer: Ammonius biſhop of Laodicea a citie in Piſidia: Briſo
                         biſhop of Philippis in Thracia: Acacius
                         biſhop of Beroea in Syria, wt diuers others. The accuſers which lately charged Iohn with haynous crimes, are nowe brought forth before theſe biſhops. Iohn truſting to the iuſt dealing of the biſhops, requireth of them that the accuſations may indifferently be examined. By that time the ſeaſt of our ſauiours natiuitie was come on which day y• Emperour went not to the church after the wonted maner, but ſent Iohn this meſſage: that he would not communicate wt him, before he had cleared him ſelfe of the crimes layd to his charge. And when as the accuſers ſeemed to miſtruſt them ſelues, &amp; that Iohn through the vprightnes &amp; equitie of his cauſe boldened him ſelfe: the biſhops then preſent affirmed they ought not to examine any other offence ſaue only whether he of him ſelfe had takē poſſeſſion of the biſhoprick after he was depoſed, without the ſentence &amp; admiſſion of a councell. When Iohn made anſwere y• he had the conſent of fiftie biſhops which cōmunicated wt him, Leontius replied againſt him. but more (ſaith he) in the coūcell withſtoode thy admiſſion. Againe when Iohn ſayd that the canon which cōtained ſuch a clauſe appertained not vnto their churche, but was to be executed where y• 
                        Arians did raigne (for ſuch as aſſembled at Antioch to roote out y• faith of one ſubſtance, layd downe y• canon againſt Athanaſius) they neuertheleſſe makinge no accōpt of his anſwere, proceeded &amp; gaue ſentence againſt him, not weying with thēſelues that ſuch as were authors of this canon were alſo depoſers of Athanaſius. Theſe things were done a litle before Eaſter. Then alſo the Emperour ſent vnto Iohn, y• he had no authoritie to go into the church, inſomuch he was depoſed &amp; condemned in two ſeuerall councells. Wherefore Iohn gaue ouer executing of the eccleſiaſticall function, &amp; refrained from going into the church. Immediatly alſo ſuch as fauored him departed y• churche, they keepe Eaſter in the cōmonSuch as cleaned to Iohn Chryſoſtome were called Iohannits. bathes called Cōſtantianae, together with many biſhops, prieſts, &amp; other eccleſiaſticall perſons, who thenceforth becauſe of their ſeuerall conuenticles were called Iohannits. For the ſpace of two moneths Iohn was neuer ſeene abrode, vntill y• by the Emperours cōmaundemēt he was brought to exile. &amp; ſo at length being baniſhed the church, he was bereaued of his contrey ſoyle. The ſame day certaine of ſuch as were called Iohannits, ſet the church on fire, with that the eaſterne wind being vp, blew the flame into the ſenatours court, &amp; ceſſed not from burning, vntill all was cōſumed to aſhes. This was done the twentieth of Iune, in the ſixt Conſulſhip of Honorius, the which he enioyed together wt 
                        Ariſtanetus. For which conſpiracie &amp; treaſon what heauy penalties &amp; grieuous puniſhments Optatus gouernour of Conſtantinople, in religion a pagane, and therfore a ſore plaguer of Chriſtians made them endure, I thinke it beſt to ouerſkip them with ſilence.

                        ARſacius an old man aboue the age of foureſcore yeares, who ſometime gouerned the biſhopricke of Conſtantinople before the dayes of Iohn, was ſhortly after made byſhop of that ſeae. In his time when as the church enioyed greate eaſe and quietneſſe, by reaſon of his ſingular modeſtie and meeke behauiour: Cyrinus biſhop of Chalcedon, whoſe foote Maruthas biſhop of Meſopotamia had trode on and hutt againſt his will, had ſuch infortunate ſucceſſe, yt his foote rotted of the broiſe, and therfore of neceſſitie he was cōſtrained to ſaw it of. Neither ſuffred he that once, but twiſe and oftenner toe. For the putrefaction ranne ouer his whole bodie, and fell at length into his other foote: then was he fayne to loſe both. I haue therefore remembred theſe

thinges becauſe it was rife in euery mans mouth that Cyrinus ſuffered this plague or puniſhmentCyrinus was plagued for reuiling of Chryloſtome. Great haile in token of Gods wrath. for reuiling of Iohn, and terming him (as I ſayd before a ſtuburne Biſhop. Againe when as great haile (the bigneſſe whereof was not remembred to haue bene ſeene before) fell in the ſuburbes of Conſtantinople y• thirtieth day of Septembre &amp; the aforeſayd Conſulſhip: y• report likewiſe went that it was a token of Gods wrath for the depoſition and baniſhment of Iohn. The death of the Empreſſe which followed immediatly after confirmed this rumor, for ſhe departed this life the fourth day after the fall of this haile. Some there were alſo which ſayd that Iohn was iuſtly depoſed: becauſe that in the voyage when he made Heraclides Biſhop of Epheſus, he thruſt many out of their Churches, namely the Nouatians, and ſuch as celebrated the feaſt of Eaſter the fourteeneth day of the moneth with many others both in Aſia and in Lydia. But whether Iohn was iuſtly depoſed as they ſaid which bare him ill will: whether Cyrinus was plagued for his opprobrious languages and ſclaunderous reports: laſt of all whether the haile and the death of the Empreſſe were ſignes of Gods high diſpleaſure for baniſhing of Iohn: or whether they happened for ſome other cauſes God alone knoweth which ſearcheth the ſecrets of mans hart, and pronounceth here of the right ſentence of iuſt iudgement. I of myne owne parte committed to writing ſuch things as then were rife in euery mans mouth.

I can not verily but wonder at him, why he addicting him ſelfe ſo much to temperance, taught in ſome ſermons that temperance was in maner to be ſett at nought. for when as by the councell of Biſhops there was admiſſion left and pardon graunted for ſuch as had once fallen after baptiſme to be receaued againe after repentance into the Church: he ſtickedThe ſaying of Chryſoſtome. not to ſay, If thou fall a thouſand times &amp; repent thee of thy folly come boldly into the Church. for which doctrine beſides that he was miſliked of many his familiars: yet was he ratled of Siſinius the Nouatian Biſhop which wrote a booke againſt that ſaying of his. but theſe thinges were done a litle while agoe.

                     HEre occaſion is offred to ſay ſomewhat of Siſinius. A man he was (as I haue remembred often times before) very eloquent and a profounde Philoſopher: and as he was a ſkilfull diſputer ſo was he alſo a cunning interpretor of holy ſcripture, ſo that for his notable witt Eunomius the heretick refuſed oftentimes to reaſon with him. He was no ſpare man of diett but liberall and a great ſpender, yet with good order and temperancie. He ſeemed riotous &amp; to exceede in ſenſualitie partly in that he arayed him ſelfe in white, and partly for bayning him ſelfe twiſe a day. When he was demaunded on a certaine time why he being a Biſhop bayned him ſelfe twiſe a day, his anſwere was: becauſe I can not doe it the thirde tyme. At an other time going of reuerence to viſite Arſacius the Biſhop, one of Arſacius familiars aſked of him why he vſed ſuch atyre as was vncomely for a Biſhop? and where he founde written that a Prieſt ought to weare white?

tell thou me (ſayth he) firſt where it is written that a Biſhop ſhoulde weare black. And when as the other muzed what anſwere he ſhoulde make, Siſinius preuented him and ſayd: thou art not able to ſhewe me that a Biſhop ought to goe in black, but I am able to alleadg Solomon for my ſelfe where he ſayth: let thy garments be white.

                         and Helias clad in white. With theſe and other ſuch like anſwers he brought all that heard him into great admiration. When that Leontius Biſhop of Ancyra in Galatia the leſſer had depriued the Nouatians of a certaine Church and then as it fell out remayned at Conſtantinople, Siſinius
                         went vnto him requeſting him to reſtore them their Church againe: Leontius in a great chafe made him this anſwere: It is pity that you Nouatians ſhoulde enioy ere a Church inſomuch you take away repentance and depriue men of the benefitts which God hath beſtowed vpon them. After that Leontius had vttered theſe with other ſuch like ſentences to the reprehenſion of the Nouatians, Siſinius
                         replied: no man repenteth more then I. why ſayth Leontius and how doeſt thou repent? becauſe ſayth Siſinius that euer I ſaw thee. Againe when Iohn the Biſhop had taunted him and ſayde that one citie coulde not holde two Biſhops, his anſwere was, no more it doth not. Iohn taking this anſwere in ill part ſayd againe, I ſee thou wilt be Biſhop alone: Not ſo (ſayth Siſinius) but with thee alone I am not Biſhop though others doe ſo take me. Iohn being grieued with this anſwere tolde him againe: I will forbid thee to preache for thou art an hereticke. Siſinius replyed mearily in this ſorte: then will I doe thee a good turne if thou eaſe me of ſo great a labour. Iohn was ſomewhat pleaſed with that anſwere and ſayd: Nay then I will not ſtay thee from preaching if it be a griefe vnto thee. ſo witty and ſo pleaſaunt was Siſinius in his anſweres, it were to longe to rehearſe all his pithye ſayinges and ſage anſwers. Wherefore I thinke it ſufficient in theſe fewe lynes to declare what kinde of man he was. Thus much further I am able to auouteh that by the report of all men he excelled for learning all the Biſhops which ſucceeded him, count all one after an other: and therefore was he much made of and in great eſtimation, yea the chiefe Senatours made great accompt of him and had his vertues in admiration. And for all he wrote many bookes and furniſhed them with rhetoricall phraſes and poeticall ſentences: yet was he commended more for pronouncinge then for penning. for he had a notable grace in his countenance, voyce, behauiour, &amp; loke, with all other his bodily geſtures for the which he was honored of all ſeets and religions, but aboue all others of Atticus Biſhop of Conſtantinople. So farre by occaſion of Siſinius.

                        Of the death of Arcadius the Emperour.
                     
                     SHortly after the death of Iohn, the Emperour Arcadius departed this life, a quiet and a curteous man he was, who in the latter ende of his life was thought to be a very godly man, vpon ſuch an occaſion as foloweth. In Conſtantinople ther is a great pallace called Carya, &amp; in the porche there ſtands a hazell on the whiche, report goeth that Acacius the Martyr was hanged. Wherefore there was a Church erected at that tree: the Emperour paſſing by was deſirous to ſee it, went in, and after he had ſayd his prayers came forth againe.

He was a painfull ſtudent for he beſtowed great labour, he ſpent the greater part of the night in reading ouer the works of auncient wryters, in ſo doing there was no grounde of philoſophy, no quirck in ſopiſtrie that coulde blanke or aſtoniſh him.

In proceſſe of tyme by dayly exerciſe and greate diligence he ſo boldned him ſelfe that he preached ex tempore, his maner of teaching was very plaine. his Sermons were ſo ſimple that the auditors thought them not worthy the bearing away, neyther the writing in paper to the knowledge of the poſterity following.

Whileſt that Theodoſius the Biſhop made friends at Conſtantinople for the furtherance of his ſute: Agapetus whome I tearmed the Macedonian Biſhop was conuerted and fell to embrace the right and ſound faith. For after he had aſſembled together all the clergie and layty within his iuriſdiction, he perſwaded them to receaue the faith of one ſubſtance. This being done he went with ſpeede together with a great multitude, nay with the whole citie, into the church where after prayers and ſolemne ſeruice he gott him into the ſeate of Theodoſius. Immediatly after the linking of the people together in the bonde of loue and vnitie, thenceforth he maintayned the faith of one ſubſtance ſo that he obtayned the gouernment of the Churches belonging vnto the dioceſſe and citte of Synada. Shortly after Theodoſius came home to Synada, and brought with him autoritie from the Lieuetenant whereof he bragged not a litle, and being ignorant of all the thinges that were done in his abſence ſtraight way he gott him into the Church, there he founde but ſmall welcome for the dores were made faſt againſt him, and after that he vnderſtoode of their dealing, againe he poſteth to Conſtantinople. There he be wayled his ſtate before Atticus the Biſhop, and openeth vnto him how that he was iniuriouſly thruſt beſide his biſhoprick. Atticus vnderſtanding that all fell out to the great profitt and furtherance of the Church of God, beganne to pacifie him with milde and curteous languages, exhorting him thenceforth to embrace a quiet life voyd of all trouble and moleſtation and not to preferre his owne priuate gaine and lucre before the profit and commoditie of the whole Church: he wrote moreouer vnto Agapetus willing him to enioy the biſhoprick and not to feare at all the diſpleaſure of Theodoſius.

Atticus was immediatly made priuey vnto this his deuoute minde and godly diſpoſition: he inſtructed the Iewe in the principles and articles of Chriſtian religion, he layd before him the hope that was to be had in Chriſt Ieſu, he bidds that Iewe bed and all ſhoulde be brought vnto the font and place appoynted for the miniſtration of baptiſme.

                     IT fell out in thoſe dayes that Rome was taken of the Barbarians. For one Alarichus a Barbarian
                        Alarichus. being in league with the Romaynes and ſometime ayded the Emperour Theodoſius in the battaill agaynſt the tyrant Eugenius and therefore was aduaunced into great honour by the Romaines, when he could not paciently content him ſelfe with the proſperous ſayle of fortunate ſucceſſes, although he aſpired not vnto the Emperiall ſeepter, yet left he Conſtantinople and poſted in all the haſt into the Weſte partes of the worlde. He was no ſooner come into lllyrium but he ſubdued vnto him all that contreye. As he went forewardes on his iorneye the Theſſalians withſtoode him aboute the entries of the riuer Peneus, the readye waye by Mounte Pindus vnto Nicopolis a citie of Epirus: the ſielde beinge there pitched the Theſſalians ſlew aboue three thouſand men. After that bloody ſ kirmiſhe the Barbarians which accompanied Alarichus ranſackinge and ſpoylinge both towne and coutrey as they went, tooke at length the citie of Rome. They rāſacked the citie: They defaced and fired many worthie monuments: they violently ſpoiled the citizens of theyr money, they executed many of the Senatours with ſundry kindes of tormente. Alarichus to the ende he might bring the Royall porte and maieſtie of the Emperiall ſcepter into contempt and deriſion, proclaymed Emperour one whoſe name was Attalus: this man by his procuremc̄tAttalus. walked abroade the ſpace of one wholl daye with a garded troope of ſouldiers, the next day after, in the attyre and habite of a ſeruant. When theſe things preuailed then in ſuche ſorte as you heare Alarichus tooke his heeles and ranne away: for the reporte that was bruted abroad of Theodoſius y• Emperours great power marching to geue him battaill, aſtonied his mind and put him in great feare.

This man baniſhed the Nouatians out of Rome, depriued them of their Churches and conſtrayned Ruſticula their Biſhop priuely to rayſe priuate conuenticles. For vnto that time the Nouatiās floriſhed at Rome, enioyed many churches &amp; had vnder thē great cōgregatiōs. but they were thē hated out of meaſure whē as the biſhop of Rome (no otherwiſe thē the biſhop of Alexandria) paſſing the boundes of his prieſtely order preſumed to chalenge vnto him ſelfe ſecular power and authoritye. Therefore thoſe biſhops permitted not ſuch as held wt thē y• faith of one ſubſtāce freely to frequēt

their wonted aſſemblies: and although they commended them for theyr vniforme conſent as toutching the faith, yet they depriued them of all theyr ſubſtance. But the Nouatians which inhabited Conſtantinople were not ſo dealt with all. For the Biſhops of Conſtantinople beſides that they embraced them for theyr vniformity in faith, they ſuffred them (as I ſayde before) to haue theyr Churches within the citie.

                        Of Chryſanthus Byſhop of the Nouatian Church in Conſtantinople.
                     
                     AFter the deſeaſe of Siſmius, Chryſanthus the ſonne of Marcianus, who was the predeceſſor of Siſmus in the Nouatian Biſhopricke, was in maner compelled to be their Biſhop. This man almoſt from his youth vp was a ſouldier in the Emperours court: afterwardes in the raigne of Theodoſius Magnus, Liuetenant of Italie: againe the Emperours vicegerent in the I ſles of Bryttaine where he purchaſed vnto him ſelfe greate commendation for his politicke gouernemente. Beinge well ſtrucken in yeares he came to Conſtantinople and labouringe to be gouernour or Magiſtrate rather in that citie, then in farre and forayne contreyes, he was conſtrayned againſt his will to be biſhop of the Nouatians. For when Siſimus being at the point of death, made mention of him as a ſitte man to ſucceede him in the rowme: the Nouatian people taking the cenſure of Siſimus as a canon or lawe compelled him to be their Biſhop. But when Chryſanthus had conueyed him ſelfe out of the way leaſt he ſhould take vpon him y• function: Sabbatius thinking verily y• nowe he had found fit opportunitie for to creepe into the biſhops ſeae: deſpiſed the dreadfull proteſtations he had ſolemnly auowed, and the oth he had taken: got him a company of obſcure biſhops to conſecrate him, and forth he ſteppes a Biſhop. One of the conſecrators was Hermogenes whome he him ſelfe had afore time excommunicated for the blaſphemous bookes which he publiſhed vnto the worlde. But all the fetches of Sabbatius framed not aright. For the people deteſting his corrupt and intollerable ambition (there was no waye vnaſſayed of him for to attaine vnto the biſhopricke) ſought out both coaſt and contrey for Chryſanthus, when they had found him lurking in Bithynia they forced him thence and ſtalled him Biſhop. He was a man that excelled all others not onely in politicke wiſedome, but alſo in modeſt behauiour: by his meanes the Nouatian churches in Conſtantinople floriſhed exceedingly. He was the firſte that of his owne ſubſtance gaue Golde vnto the poore: He tooke nothing ſaue onely two loues euery ſundaye of the bleſſed breade: he was a man that was very diligent in his eccleſiaſticall function: he tooke Ablabius the Rhetorician a very wiſe man of the Nouatian Church, out of Troilus the Sophiſts ſchoole and made him miniſter. There are extant notable and excellent ſermons of this Chryſanthus. Ablabius was afterwardes made Biſhop of the Nouatian Church at Nice, where alſo he profeſſed Rhetorick.

                     ABout that time the Ievves were baniſhed Alexandria by Cyrillus the Biſhop vpon ſuche an occaſion as followeth. The people of Alexandria aboue all other men are prone to ſchiſme and contention: for if that any quarell at any time riſe amonge them, immediatly hainous &amp; horrible offences are wonte to enſue, the tumult is neuer appeaſed without greate bloodeſhede. It fell out that y• greate throng and multitude of people contended among themſelues not about anyDaūcing vſed in Alexad
                              •
                           ia on the ſatturdayes. neceſſarie matter, but who coalde approche nereſt vnto the dauncers, which lewd cuſtome is now crept into all cities. For a great multitude aſſembled together on y• ſaturday to paſtime thē ſelues with the beholding of a certene dauncer. And becauſe the Iewes ſpent not that daye in the hearing of their lawe being theyr ſabaoth day, but gaue them ſelues wholly vnto the bearing of comedies and enterludes, to the beholdinge of ſhowes and ſpectacles, that daye was the occaſion of greate ſchiſme and diſſention among the people. And though the tumult was partly appeaſed by y• Liuetenant of Alexandira yet neuertheleſſe the Iewes gaue not ouer theyr quarell nor the ſpite they owed vnto the one parte of the faction. For the Iewes as they were alwayes found deadly foes vnto ſuch as proſeſſed the Chriſtian faith: ſo then aboue all other times they were incenſed againſt them becauſe of the dauncers. Wherefore when as Orestes the Liuetenante of Alexandria had

nayled vpon the theatre the wrytte of politicke gouernance (for ſo doe the people of Alexandria tearme the publicke proclamations of the Liuetenant) ſome of Cyrillus y• Biſhops familier friēds ſtepped forth to examine what the Liuetenant had wrytten. Of which number one was Hierax a ſchoolemaiſter and profeſſor of grammer, a dligent auditor of Cyrillus the biſhop and one that was greatly delited with his ſermons. The multitude of the Iewes ſeeing this Hierax vpon the ſtage exclaimed immediatly againſt him y•he came thither for no other cauſe, but onely to ſet the people together by the eares. Oreſtes although heretofore he enuyed y• authority of Biſhops becauſe thatTemporall and worldly Magiſtrats are grieued that the Church ſhoulde haue any authority or preeminence. the credit and power which the Emperours graunted the Magiſtrates and Liuetenantes was by reaſon of them abridged and cut ſhort: yet thē he ſpited him aboue all other times becauſe that Cyrillus would prie into his wrytings and curiouſly ſift out the contents &amp; meaning thereof. Therefore he cauſed Hierax openly to be apprehended in the mideſt of the theatre and to be puniſhed extremly. Cyrillus vnderſtanding of this warned the chiefe of the Iewes to appeare before him, tolde them plainely if they woulde not geue ouer their rebellion and traiterous conſpiracie agaynſt the true Chriſtians he would puniſh them according vnto theyr deſerts. The Iewes ſtomakinge the Biſhops threates, fretted the more and boyled within them ſelues for anger, they fell to deuiſinge of ſleights for to miſchiefe the Chriſtians, which in the end cauſed all the Iewes to be baniſhed Alexandria. The circumſtance was in ſuch ſort as followeth. The Iewes after conſultation layinge downe a ſigne for ech of them to knowe the other to wit: the carieng of a ring made of the rinde or barke of the palme tree, purpoſed to ſet vpon the Chriſtiās in the night time. Wherefore on a certaine night they ſente abroade throughout the wholl citie ſuche as ſhoulde crie fire, fire, and where ſhould it be but in the church called Sainct Alexanders, The chriſtians hearing of this roſe vp, left theyr houſes, ranne to ſaue the church from burning, ſome out of this ſtreete, &amp; ſome out of that. thē the Iewes ſtepped forth ſodainely from vnder the pentiſes, ſet vpon y• Chriſtiās &amp; ſlewe them. And as they endeuored to keepe theyr hands y• their rings might not be ſeene: ſo they diſpatched out of the way as many chriſtians as met them. When the day appeared &amp; y• ſunne was vp the authors of this horrible murther were knowen well inough. Cyrillus vnderſtanding of y• circumſtance was wonderfully incēſed againſt them: got him ſtraight with great power into y• ſynagoges of y• 
                        Iewes (for ſo were their churches called) &amp; executed preſently ſome of the Iewes, ſome other he baniſhed the citie, other ſome he bereaued of their ſubſtance. Wherefore the Iewes which inhabited Alexā
                           dria ſince the raigne of Alexander king of Macedonia, were then baniſhed the citie &amp; diſperſed ouer all contreyes. Adamantius a phiſicion one of the ſcattered Iewes got him vnto Atticus BiſhopAdamantius. Oreſtes. of Conſtantinople, became a chriſtian &amp; dwelled afterwards in Alexander. Oreſtes
                         the Liuetenāt of y• citie tooke in very ill part y• deede of Cyrill: was very ſory y• ſo noble a citie ſhould be depriued of ſo great a multitude of men. Wherefore he certified the Emperour of all the doings there: Cyrillus like wiſe painted forth in paper the traiterous conſpiracy of y• 
                        Iewes &amp; ſent it in wryting vnto the Emperour: yet neuertheles he laboured to become friends wt 
                        Oreſtes, for ſo y• citizens of Alexandria did aduiſe him. But when Oreſtes woulde not as much as once heare the motion of recō
                        ciliation betwene them, Cyrill reached into his hand y• newe teſtament ſuppoſing verely he would reuerence the booke &amp; remember himſelfe the better. When y• the mind of Oreſtes could not be turned neither any good moode found in him but y• deadly enmity grew betwene thē ſuch a calamity enſued thereof as I mind hereafter at large to declare.

                     DIuerſe of the Monkes inhabiting the mounte Nitria being feruently diſpoſed &amp; lately alſo tried when as Theophilus the Biſhop had armed thē againſt Dioſcorus &amp; his brethren gaue themſelues contentiouſly to partakinge &amp; purpoſed of theyr owne accord to maintaine the quarell of Cyrill. Wherefore to the number of fifty Monkes leauing their monaſteries, came toAmmonius the Monke wounded the Liuetenant of Alexandria with a ſtone. 
                        Alexandria, compaſſed the Liuetenant as he rode in his charriot, conferred with him, called him a ſacrificer, an Ethincke, with ſundry other contumelious languages. He ſuppoſing with himſelfe y• 
                        Cyrill had wrought this conſpiracy againſt him cried out that he was a chriſtian &amp; that Atticus, biſhop of Conſtantinople had baptized him. But when as the Monks weyed not his words one of them whoſe name was Ammonius tooke the Liuetenant on the heade wt a ſtone. The Liuetenant

being ſore wounded with the blowe, the bloode ranne about his cares. The ſergeantes and ſuch as garded the perſon of the Liuetenant ſeeing the ſtones flie about their eares fled away, fewe onely excepted and held downe their heads among the multitude. In the meane while the people of Alexandria came about them and in the Liuetenantes behalfe ſet vpon the Monkes, in the ende theſe Monkes ranne all away Ammonius onely excepted. Him they tooke and brought before the Liuetenant. He openly according vnto the lawes, reaſoneth wt him of the matter, pronounceth againſt him the ſentence of Iuſtice and tormented him as longe as breath remained in his body. All theſe circumſtances ſhortly after were opened vnto the Emperours, Cyrill alſo certified him of the ſame matter though in an other ſorte. He tooke the corps of Ammonius and buriedit in a certaine church calling him not Ammonius but Thaumaſius. In the church he extolled the noble courage of this mā the great combat he endured for godlines and commaunded he ſhoulde be called a martyr. But the modeſt and grauer ſorte of chriſtians allowed not of Cyrills doings herein, for they knew yt 
                        Ammomus died not in torment becauſe he would not deny Chriſt, but ſuffred dewe puniſhmēt for his raſh enterpriſes. Wherefore Cyrill him ſelfe ſuffred at length this hainous offence by a little and a litle to fall into the duſt of obliuion, Neither was the cōtention &amp; quarel betwene Cyrill and Oreſtes put vp as yet, for there enſued an other calamytye not much vnlike this the which I am nowe about to declare.

                     THere was in Alexādria a womā whoſe name was Hypatia y• daughter of Theon the PhiloſopherHypatia a woman of great learning. which profited ſo much in profound learning, y• the excelled all the Philoſophers of y• time: and not onely ſucceeded in Plato his ſchoole the which exerciſe Plotinus continewed, but alſo expounded vnto as many as came to heare her the precepts &amp; doctrine of all ſorts of Philoſophers. wherefore as many as gaue their ſtudie to the knoweledge of philoſophicall diſcipline flocked vnto her leſſons from euery contrey. Moreouer for her graue courage of minde the which ſhe gathered out of the fountaines and bowells of philoſophicall literature, for her modeſt and matronlike behauiour ſhe ſticked not to preſent her ſelfe before Princes &amp; magiſtrates. Neither was ſhe abaſhed to come into the open face of the aſſembly. All men did both reuerence and had her in admiration for the ſinguler modeſty of her mind. Wherefore ſhe had great ſpite &amp; enuy owed vnto her, and becauſe ſhe conferred oft and had great familiarity wt 
                        Oreſtes, the people charged her that ſhe was the cauſe why the Biſhop &amp; Oreſtes were not become friends. To be ſhorte certen heady &amp; raſh cockbraynes whoſe guide and captaine was `Peter a reader of y• church, watched this woman cōming home frō ſome place or other: they pul her out of her chariot: they hale her into the church called Caeſarium: they ſtrip her ſtarke naked: they raſe the ſkinne and rent the fleſh of her body wt ſharpe ſhells vntill breath departed out of her body: they quarter her body: they bring the quarters vnto a place called Cinaron and burne them to aſſes. This hainous offence was no ſmall blemiſhe both to Cyrill and to the church of Alexandria. For the profeſſors of chriſtiā religion ſhould be no fighters, they ought to be farre frō comitting of murther &amp; bloodſhed wt other ſuch horrible offē
                        ces. Theſe things came thus to paſſe the fourth yeare of Cyrills conſecratiō, the tenth conſulſhip of Honorus and the ſeuenth of Theodoſius in the moneth of March and on the ember dapes.

                     SHortly after, the Iewes for their horrible practiſes againſt the profeſſors of the chriſtiā faith ſuffred puniſhment dewe for their deſert, in a certaine place called Inmeſtar betwene Chalcis and Antioch in Syria. At the time of their playes and enterludes they committed many abſurd and ſhamefull acts: at length through frenſie and furious motion they remoued reaſon out of her ſeate, much like madd men they contumeliouſly derided in their playes not onely the Chriſtians but alſo Chriſt Jeſus him ſelfe: they ſcoffed at the croſſe and mocked as many as put theyr truſt in him that was crucified thereon. The maner was as followeth. They lay hold on a child ofThe Iewes crucified a boye in deriſion of all Chriſtians. the Chriſtians, they nayl him to a tree and lift him vp on high.

For this haynous offence there was muche adoe betweene them and the Chriſtians. Moreouer the Emperours were certified what an horrible acte the Ievves had committed, which

wrote againe vnto the Liuetenante and Magiſtrates of that prouince, that they ſhould make diligent ſearch and inquiſition for the authors and workers of ſo greate a miſchiefe and puniſhe them ſeuerely.

                         Biſhop after he had gouerned ſuch congregatiōsChryſanthus as were vnder him the ſpace of ſeauen yeares departed this life in the Conſulſhip of Monaxia &amp; Plyntha the ſixt and twentieth of Auguſt, whome Paulus ſucceeded. This Paulus aPaulus. good while ago was ſchoolemaiſter and reader of the Latine tongue, afterwards he left that kind of ſtudie and framed himſelfe to the Monaſticall life. He founded a monaſtery of ſuch men as gaue them ſelues to the ſtudy of vertue and godlines, not vnlike vnto the Monaſteries of the Monkes inhabiting the deſerte. I knewe the man my ſelfe to be ſuche a one as Euagrius wryteth the religious men liuing in y• wilderneſſe ought to be. For he imitated his precepts, he gaue him ſelfe to cō
                        tinewall faſting: he ſpake litle: he accuſtomed to abſtaine from liuing creatures &amp; oftentimes from wine &amp; oyle: he was very carefull in relieuing of the poore: he viſited cōtine wally ſuch as lay in fetters and cloſe priſon: he was a great futer vnto temporall magiſtrats for the afflicted and ſuccourleſſe, which alwayes with willinge mindes graunte him his requeſt for the greate reuerence, and ſinguler opinion of godlines they cōceaued of him. But what neede I vſe many words in the recitall of his vertues? one notable act of his I am nowe about to declare which ſhall ſufficein ſteade of many, &amp; worthy it is to be printed in Marble to y• memorie of all poſteritie in time to come. A certē diſſembling Iewe, fayning he would embrace the Chriſtian fayth was often baptiſed, through the which wiles he got much money. After that he had guilefully deceaued many men of ſundry ſects and opinions (for he had bene baptiſed of the Arians &amp; Macedonians) he had no more whoſe eyes he might bleare, at length he commes to `Paulus the Nouatiā
                         Biſhop and proteſteth vnto him that gladlye he woulde be baptiſed and prayeth him that he may obtaine it at his hande. Paulus liketh well of his ſute, but he ſayd vnto him that he woulde not baptiſe him afore he had learned the articles and principles of the fayth, and geuē him ſelfe to faſting the ſpace of many dayes. The Iewe againſt his will was conſtrained to faſte, he called vpon them euerye daye to be baptiſed. `Paulus ſeeing that he was ſo earneſt and would needes be baptized thought beſt not to diſpleaſe him with delay, made all thinges ready for baptiſme. When he had prouided for him a white garment and cauſed the font to be filled with water, he ſent for the Iewe thither to be baptized. But all the water by a certen diuine power &amp; ſecret operation which the outward eye could not attaine vnto, was ſodainely dried vp. When as neither Biſhop neither ſuch as were alſo then preſent perceaued the maner howe it was gone, but thinkinge that it ranne through the hole in the bottome of the fonte (where at other times they were wont to let the water goe) filled the fonte a freſh and ſtopped all the holes and chinkes on euery ſide. But when the Iewe was brought the ſecond time and hanged his heade ouer the fonte, the water againe vaniſhed away euery drop. Paulus ſeeing this ſayd vnto y• 
                        Iewe O man either thou diſſembleſt egregiouſly, or elſe thou haſt bene baptiſed vnwittingly. In the ende when as the rumor and report of this miracle cauſed many to runne vnto the place, one by chaunce amonge the reſt knewe the Iewe by his fauour and affirmed that he ſawe him baptized of Atticus Biſhop of Conſtantinople. This miracle was wroughte vnder the handes of Paulus the Nouatian Biſhoppe.

                        Howe that after the deſeaſe of Iſdigerdes king of Perſia the league was broken betweene the Romaines and the Perſians and howe that the Perſians in the ende were foyled and the citie preſerued.
                     
                     AFter the deſeaſe of Iſdigerdes kinge of Perſia which in all his life time perſecuted not the Chriſtians inhabitinge his dominions, his ſonne Bararanes beinge crowned in his fathers ſteede, was driuē thereunto through the perſwaſion of Magicians and ſouthſayers, ſo that he vexed the Chriſtians out of meaſure and puniſhed them with ſundrye torments after the maner

                        of Perſia. wherefore y• chriſtians which dwelled in Perſia were cōſtrayned to flie vnto y• 
                        Romains for refuge, they humbly craue of them that they will pitie theyr caſe, that they will not ſuffer them in ſuch ſorte lamentablye to be oppreſſed. Atticus the Biſhop entertained thoſe ſuters curteouſly: furthered their ſute as much as in him laye, and opened vnto the Emperour Theodoſius their caſe. The Romaines at the ſame time were offended with the Perſians for an other matter, the quarell was as followeth. The Perſians had borowed of the Romaines certaine ſearchers and diggers of gold mines, theſe men they would not only not deliuer backe againe but ſpoyled alſo the Romaine marcha
                           ••
                        rs of theyr wares and marchandiſe, the refuge of the chriſtians augmented the vnkindnes and increaſed the diſpleaſure. For immediatly after theyr flight the kinge of Perſia ſent Embaſſadours requiring them backe againe as fugitiue perſons. The Romaines becauſe they ranne vnto them for ſuccour would not reſtore them: nay they purpoſed not onely to aide thē which were ſimple ſuters but alſo with all might poſſible generally to maintayne the quarell in the behalfe of chriſtian religion. Wherefore they choſe rather to wage battaill with the Perſians then ſuffer the chriſtians ſo miſerably to periſh. To be ſhorte the league was broken &amp; open warres proclaimed, but in mine opiniō it ſhall not be amiſſe briefly to runne ouer ſome things thereof. The Emperour of Rome firſt of all ſent an hoſt of armed ſouldiers a parte, one from the other againſt the Perſiās, whereof Ardaburius was generall captaine: he paſſinge through Armenia entred with force into the Perſian dominions &amp; deſtroyed the prouince called Azazena. Narſaeus
                         the king of Perſias captaine went forth to meete him with great power of Perſian ſouldiers: they ioyned together: y• field was fought: Narſeus was foyled and fled away to ſaue his life. Afterwardes when he ſawe his tyme he determined to enter vnlooked for into the Romayne dominions throughe Meſopotamia where there was no power to reſiſte them and purpoſed ſo to reuenge him of the Romaynes. But the Romayne captaine was quickely made priuey vnto the pollicie and fetche of Narſaeus, for he ſacked and rifled Azazena with all ſpeede and got him in poſt haſt to Meſopotamia. Wherefore though Narſaeus had gathered a wōderfull great power together, yet could he not inuade the Romayne contreyes. When he came to Niſibis a citie of Perſia, yet ſituated iuſte in the middeſt betwene the Romayne and Perſian dominions, he ſent vnto Ardaburius that he would gladly come to parle with him, toutchinge the time and place, when and where the battaill ſhoulde be foughte. Ardaburius anſwered the legats in this ſorte: tell Narſaeus from me that the Emperours of Rome vſe not to wage battaill at Narſaeus his pleaſure. Wherefore the Emperour of Rome vnderſtanding that the kinge of Perſia had gathered a greate army together for to wage battaill with him, put his wholl truſt &amp; confidence in God: he ſent of the contrary a great hoſt againſt him. And hereby it will euidently appeare vnto the wholl worlde that the Emperour enioyed immediatly a ſinguler benefitte for caſting his care &amp; affiance vpon God. For when as y• citizens of Conſtantinople were very ſad &amp; heuy, miſtruſting the doubtful end of the variable chaunces incident to warrs, a company of Angells appeared vnto certen in Bithynia, whoſe neceſſary affayres conſtrained to trauell into Conſtantinople &amp; willed them to ſalute the citizens of Conſtantinople &amp; bid them be of good cheare: exhorting them to pray &amp; to put theyr truſt in God: that the Romaines ſhould foyle the enemy &amp; become conquerours and that God had ſent them as gouernours and ſoueraigne captaines of the warres. this being heard not only the citie was recreated, but alſo y• ſouldiers harts were lighted &amp; the more encouraged to fight. Whē the campe was remoued &amp; y• warres trāſlated out of Armenia into Meſopotamia, the Romaines got the Perſian ſouldiers into the citie of Niſibis and there beſieged them: they ſet to the walls wodden turrets reſembling ladders rolled vpon wheeles and winded vp: they ſlewe many of them whiche fought on the walls, defended theyr citie &amp; withſtood their ſkaling. Bararanes king of Perſia vnderſtāding that his contrey Azazena was deſtroyed and that his ſouldiers were ſhutte vp of the Romaynes and beſieged within the citie Niſibis, wente him ſelfe with all his power agaynſte the Romaynes. But becauſe he feared greatly the force of the Romayne ſouldiers, he craued ayd of the Saracens, whoſe gouernour then was Almundarus a man of valiaunte courage and noble proweſſe, whiche broughte with him an infinite multitude of Saracens and encouraged the kinge of Perſia and promiſed moreouer that in a ſhorte while after he woulde not onely conquere the Romaines, but alſo take Antioch and Syria &amp; deliuer it into his hands. But his promiſe was not performed, it preuayled not accordinge vnto his deſire, for God vpon a ſodaine ſo terrified &amp; aſtonied the Saracens that they imagined the Romaine ſouldiers were vnawares come vpō them: &amp; whileſt that they beſturred thē ſelues for feare &amp; knewe not where to flie they caſt thēſelues headelonge as they were all in armour into the riuer

                        Euphrates, where the number of one hundred thouſand was drowned. ſuch a miſfortune befell vnto the Saracens. The Romaines which layde ſiege to Niſibis, hearing that the king of Perſia was comming againſt them with a great number of Olyphants, were wonderfully afrayde, gathered together all the engines they had prepared for ſiege, and burned them, afterwards returned backe to their cōtrey. But what battailes were afterwards fought: how Areobindus an other captaine of the Romaines, ſlew a mightie Perſian dealing with him hand to hād: how Ardaburius diſpatched through wiles and ſtratagemes ſeuen of the nobilitie of Perſia, and how that Vitianus a third captaine of the Romaines, foyled the remnant of the Saracens power: I thinke it my duty to ouerſkip them with ſilence, leſt I ſeeme to make toe long a digreſſion from the purpoſe.

                     THe aforeſayde newes were quickly brought vnto the Emperour Theodoſius, but howe he coulde ſo ſoone vnderſtande of matters done in contreyes ſo farre diſtant, I am now about to declare. He had a man whoſe name was Palladius, one that had rare gyftes bothe outwardly in bodie, and inwardly in minde. He was able in three dayes to ryde in ſuch poſte, as was to be wondered, vnto the furtheſt places and boundes of the Romaine and Perſian dominions, and backe agayne in ſo many dayes to Conſtantinople. Moreouer he went with maruelous greate ſpeede throughout the worlde whyther ſo euer the Emperour had ſent him, ſo that a wiſe man ſayde once of him: This fellowe with his celeritie maketh the Empire of Rome, which is very wyde, to be narrowe and ſtrayght. When the king of Perſia heard the ſame of him, he coulde not chuſe but wonder. So farre of Palladius.

                     THe Emperour of Rome abydinge at Conſtantinople, and vnderſtanding for trueth of the victory that was geuen him, behaued him ſelfe ſo graciouſly, that he deſired greatly the enioyinge of peace and quietneſſe, for all that his ſouldiers had ſuche proſperous ſucceſſe in all their aduentures: Wherefore he ſent Helion, one that was in greate creditte with him, in embaſſie vnto the kinge of Perſia for to conclude a league betweene them. Helion comminge to Meſopotamia, and the place where the Romaines had trenched them ſelues, ſent Maximinus a valiaunt man, and felowe captayne with Ardaburius, as Embaſſadour to entreate for peace. As ſoone as he had preſented him ſelfe before the kinge of Perſia, he ſayde that he came not from the Emperour, but from his captaines, to ſee whether it woulde ple
                           ••
                        e him to make truce: that the Emperour was ignorant of all the circumſtance and euents of that battaile▪ and if peraduenture it were told him, he would make but ſmall accompt of it. The king as he purpoſed with him ſelfe to receaue this embaſſie with moſt willinge minde (for his army was almoſt famiſhed to death) the order of the ſouldiers whome they call Immortall (the number moūted to tenne thouſand of moſt ſtronge and valiaunt men) came and perſwaded the kinge that he ſhould not confirme any league, before that they firſte of all had aſſaulted and ſodainly ſett vpon the Romaines, who nowe as they thought, were vnprouided. The Kinge yeelded vnto their aduiſe and councell: deliuered the Embaſſadour in the meane while to be kept in holde: and ſent thoſe Immortall ſouldiers for to aſſault the Romaines. They went on their voyage, and deuided their cōpany into two armies, purpoſing to beſet and compaſſe ſome part of the Romaine hoſt. The Romaines when as they might ſee but one onely army of the Perſians, ſet vpon them: for the other had not as yet appeared, but ſodainly ruſhed in vpon y• 
                        Romaines. But as they ſkirmiſhed together, a Romaine captayne y• was ſent by Procopius for the purpoſe, looking downe (as God would) from the top of a hill, behelde his felow ſouldiers in great peril, went behinde the Perſians and kept them in: ſo y• they which a litle before beſett the Romaines, were now beſette them ſelues. Wherefore the Romaines when as in ſhorte ſpace they had foyled theſe foremen, they turned them ſelues backe towards them which ruſhed in vpon them through wyles, and in like ſort diſpatched them euery one. Thus it came to paſſe that they which called them ſelues immortall, proued them ſelues mortall: and thus Chriſt reuenged him of the Perſians, becauſe that they had executed many godly men and holy ſaints which ſerued him deuoutly. The king of Perſia vnderſtanding of this ſlaughter and ouerthrow, fained he knewe of nothing: accepted of the embaſſie and reaſoned thus with the embaſſadour: It is not for the Romaines
                        
ſake that I now aſſent vnto peace, but only to gratifie &amp; pleaſure thee whome I have tried by experience to be for pollicie and wiſdome of the chiefeſt among the Romaines. To conclude by this meanes the warres which the Romaines held with the Perſians in the quarell and defence of the perſecuted Chriſtians, were ended in the thirteenth Conſulſhip of Honorius, and the tenth of Theodoſius, the fourth yeare of the three hundreth Olympiad: and alſo the fiery flame of perſecutiō kindled there againſt the Chriſtians, was wholly quenched.

When he had uſed theſe &amp; other ſuch like reaſons, he cōmaunded that the treaſure ſhould be caſt &amp; trāſlated, he made money therof, &amp; ſent the wholl price partly for to redeeme the captiues out of priſon, and partly for to relieue thē, that they periſhed not wt famine. Laſt of all he gaue thē their coſtage, to were neceſſary prouiſion for their voyage, and ſent them back to their king. This notable act of y• renowmed Acacius brought the king of Perſia into great admiration, that the Romaines endeuoured to winne their aduerſaries both wt warrs and wt well doing. The report goeth moreouer y• the king of Perſia deſired greatly y• ſight of Acacius, &amp; coueted y• preſence of his perſō: &amp; that the Emperour Theodoſius cōmaūded Acacius y• biſhop to gratifie the king therin.

                        Patience. Curteſie. Clemencie. Furthermore he excelled all men in pacience, curteſie &amp; clemencie. The Emperour Iulian for all he profeſſed the ſtudy of philoſophie, yet coulde he not put up the hatred of ſuch as reuiled him at Antioch, but puniſhed extremely one of them whoſe name was Theodorus: as for Theodoſius, he layd aſide the ſubtilities &amp; quircks of Ariſtotle, &amp; practiſed dayly in life the profeſſion and ſtudy ofGood life. true philoſophie. He learned to bridle anger: to take griefe and ſorow paciently: to reuenge him of none that did him iniurie, nay there is not the man that euer ſaw him angry. When that one of his familiars had demaunded of him, why he neuer executed any y• had done him iniurie, his anſwere was: I would to God it laye in me to reuiue them that be dead. Unto an other that demaunded of him the like, he ſayd: It is no hard matter to bereaue a man of his life, but when he is gone, thereMercie. is no man be he neuer ſo ſory for him, that can reſtore him to life againe, ſaue God alone. He was alwaies of y• mind, that if any cōmitted treaſon, he would not ſuffer him to go as farre as the gates of the citie towardes the place of execution, but of his clemencie he called him backe againe. The ſame man againe, when he publiſhed ſpectacles on a certaine time at Conſtantinople, wt the bickering and fighting of beaſts in cōpaſſe of the theatre, and the people ſhouted vnto him requiring that one of the ſtrōgeſt men ſhould be turned vnto the ſauadge beaſt which rainged about, his anſwere was in this ſort: Doe not you know that we can not away with cruell ſpectacles? When theHumanitie. people hearde this, they learned thenceforth to refraine from cruell ſhowes. Moreouer he was ſo religious, that he honored all the prieſts of God, but ſpecially ſuch as he knew did excell in godleneſſe.Religion. The report goeth, that he made ſearche for the ſackcloth which the biſhop of Chebrū
                         wore that died at Conſtantinople, aud being found, they ſay he more it how homely ſoeuer it was, thinking verely to gett vnto him ſelfe thereby ſome of the deade mans holineſſe. As he ſoleminzed on a certaine tempeſtuous and ſtormie tyme of the yeare, (the people requiringe the ſame) the vſuall and wonted ſpectacles and ſhowes in the place called Circus, enuironed with a wall and galeries round about, when the rowme was full of people, and the tempeſt waxed ſore, there fell vpon them ſodainly a great cloude of ſnow, then the Emperour renealed vnto the worlde what affection andZeale and feare of God zeale he bare towards God: he willed the bedells in his name to ſay thus vnto the people: It is far better for vs to lay aſide theſe ſowes and paſtime, and with one voyce to fall a praying vnto God that he will deliuer vs out of this preſent ſtorme. The words were no ſooner ſpokē, but all ioyntly fell downe to the ground, and poured out earneſt &amp; zealous praiers vnto God, ſo y• the whole citieHumilitie. was become like one church.

Aſpar alſo y• ſōne of Ardaburius ſeing both his father taken captiue, &amp; alſo hearing for certainty y• an infinite power of Barbariās wēt to ayde the rebell, knewe not what to doe, he was at his wittes ende. To be ſhort y• prayers of y• godly Emperour thē alſo proued thē ſelues againe to be very effectuall. for an Angell of God in y• forme of a ſhepherd guided Aſpar on his iourney, &amp; led his army by a lake adioyning vnto Rauēna (for there it was that the tyrant kept captaine Ardaburius in hold) which way as fame goeth, there was neuer man y• found paſſage. But God opened a way vnto Aſpar where as it is thought others coulde not goe. He led then his armie through the lake, which then as it fell out was dryed vp by the handy worke of God: he ruſhed in at the gates of the citie which lay wide open, &amp; diſpatched the tyrāt. At what time the moſt godly Emperour vnderſtanding of the tyrāts death, as he celebrated thoſe ſhowes and ſpectacles in Circus, made manifeſt his ſingular zeale &amp; pietie godwards, for thus he ſpake vnto the people. Let vs geue ouer this vaine paſtime and pleaſure: let vs rather repaire vnto the church and ſerue God deuoutly, pouring vnto God zealous prayers, &amp; yelding vnto him harty thankes, who with his owne hande hath bereaued the tyrant of his life. He had no ſooner made an end of ſpeaking, but ther gaue ouer their ſpectacles and ſhowes: they ſet all at nought: they paſſed throughout the theater ſounding out thanks geuing with one voyce together with the Emperour: they went ſtraight to the church, and ſpent there the whole day, ſo that all the citie ſeemed to be as one church.

                     WHen the tyrant was diſpatched out of the waye, Theodoſius began to conſider with him ſelfe whome he ſhould proclaime Emperour of the weſt parts of the worlde. He had to his kinſeman one Valentinianus a very yong gentleman, begotten on Placidia his aunt, for ſhe was the doughter of Theodoſius Magnus the Emperour, and ſiſter to Arcadius and Honorius the Emperoures. Constantius that was made Emperour by Honorius, and gouerned the empire with him a very ſhorte ſpace (for he dyed immediatly) was the father of 
                           Ʋalentinianus. Theodoſius made this his coſin Caeſar, ſent him into the weſt, and put his mother Placidia in truſte with the emperiall affaires. Afterwards whē he determined to go him ſelfe into Italie for to proclaime his Coſin Emperour, and in his owne perſon to counſell the Italians that they ſhoulde not lightly geue eare vnto tyrants and rebelles, he came as farre as Theſſalonica, and there he was hindred with ſicknes, ſo that he could goe no further. Therefore he ſent the emperiall ſcepter vnto his Coſin by Helion the Senatour, and returned him ſelfe backe againe to Conſtantinople. But of theſe things thus much ſhall ſuffice.
                  
                  
                     CAP. XXV. Of Articus biſhop of Conſtantinople, &amp; how he gouerned the churches. Alſo howe he cauſed that the name of Iohn Chryſostome ſhould be canonized among the ſaincts of that church.
                     
                     
                        ATticus the biſhop was a great furtherer of the eccleſiaſticall affaires, for he gouerned with great wiſdome, and exhorted the people diligently with heauenly doctrine to vertuous and godly liuinge. When he ſawe the church deuided, and that the Iohannits vſed their priuate meetings and conuenticles, he commaunded that the memoriall of Iohn ſhoulde be ſolemnized at ſeruice time as the maner is of other Biſhops that are deſeaſed. for by that meanes he hoped veryly it woulde come to paſſe that many of them woulde returne vnto the Church. He was ſo bountifull and liberall that he prouided not onely for the pouerty of his owne Church, but alſo ſent money vnto the next Churches for to ſupply the want of the needy. for he ſent vnto Calliopius miniſter of the Church of Nice three hundreth peeces of golde and withall letters contayning this forme.

                        Aiticus vnto Calliopius ſendeth greeting in the Lord. I am geuen to vnderſtand that there is an
                        
                        Atticus b. of Conſtantino ple vnto Calliopius miniſter of Nice. 
                        infinite number in your city ready to perish with famine &amp; ſtand in neede of the almes &amp; charity of godly &amp; weldiſpoſed perſons. VVhere I write an infinite number, I meane a great multitude, the certayne nūber wherof I do not readily knowe. Therefore ſeeing I receaued money of him which beſtoweth aboundance and plenty of ritches vpon them which vſe it a right: ſeeinge alſo dayly experience teacheth vs that ſome do want to the end that ſuch as be welthy &amp; miniſter not vnto them, may throughly be tryed: my will is (welbeloued brother) that thou receaue from me theſe three hundreth peeces of golde, and diſtribute them at thy diſcretion among the poore people of thy parish, ſee that thou deale the ſame not among ſuch as reſpect only the belly, &amp; make a liuing or trade throughout their life time of begging, but among ſuch as are ashamed to begge. Neither vvoulde I haue thee herein to reſpecte any opinion o
                              •
                            ſect vvhatſoeuer, neither to preiudice them which practiſe in doctrine a contrary faith vnto vs, but onely to haue conſideration of this, that thou relieue them which hunger &amp; thurſt &amp; haue not vvherevvithall to helpe them ſelues. Thus was he carefull of the pouerty of ſuch as dwelled from him in farre &amp; forayne contreyes. Againe when he vnderſtood y• ſuch as ſeuered them ſelues from the Nouatians
                        Atticus endeuored to bring the Nouatians from Idolatry. about y• keeping of Eaſter, had tranſlated the corps of Sabbatius out of the Iſle Rhodos (for there he died in exile) buried it ſolemnly and praied vpon his tumbe: he ſent certaine thither in the night time, charging them to remoue the corps of Sabbatius &amp; bury it in an other ſepulchre. ſuch as vſed to frequent the place when they ſaw the graue digged vp, ceaſſed thenceforth to honour the tumbe of Sabbatius. The ſame Atticus did paſſe in aſſigning of proper names to things. for the rode in y• boſome of Pontus Euxinus which of old was called poyſon, he called Medicen, leſt he ſhould there raiſe an aſſembly &amp; appoynt thereunto a place called after a foule name. Moreouer he tearmed a peece of the ſuburbes of Conſtantinople, Argyrople vpon ſuch an occaſion as followeth. Chryſople is a rode in y• head of the ſea Boſphorus. Many auncient writers make mention therof, namely Strabo, Nicolaus Damaſcenus &amp; the famous writer Xenophon, who both in y• ſixt booke of Cyrus expedition &amp; in the firſt of y• famous acts of y• 
                        Grecians remembreth the ſaid towne, y• 
                        Alcibiades wal led it about &amp; how there is a place therein aſſigned for y• paiment of tyth &amp; tribute. for ſuch as looſe out of the maine ſea &amp; ariue at y• place doe vſe there to pay tyth. Wherfore Atticus ſeeing the place ouer againſt him had ſo worthy a name, procured this rode thenceforth to be called Argyrople. As ſoone as he ſpake y• word, the name was immediatly chaunged. Againe when as ſome men ſaid vnto him y• the Nouatians ſhould not haue their conuenticles &amp; aſſemblies wt in the walls of the citie, what do ye not remember (ſaith he) what troubles &amp; vexations they endured, when we were toſſed wt the grieuous ſtorme of perſecution in y• raigne of Conſtantius &amp; Valens, &amp; howe y• at ſundry other times they teſtified together wt vs the true faith which we maintaine? Moreouer for all they were of old deuided from the church, yet attempted they to eſtabliſh no noueltie as toutching y• fayth. Againe this Atticus being at Nice about the ordayning of a biſhop, &amp; ſeing there Aſclepiades a Nouatian biſhop who was a very old man, he aſked of him how many yeares he had bene a Biſhop? when the other had anſwered fifty yeares: thou art truely a happy man (ſaith he) in y• God graunted thee to enioy ſo worthy a function, ſo long a time. he ſaid againe vnto Aſclepiades: verily I doe commende Nouatus, but I allowe not of the Nouatians. Aſclepiades
                         maruelling what he ſhoulde meane in ſo ſaying, replyed: how ſo O biſhop? Atticus made anſwere: I do commend him (ſaith he) for refuſing to communicate wt ſuch as had ſacrificed to Idols, for I would haue done no leſſe my ſelfe. But I like not of the Nouatians, becauſe they exclude from the communion ſuch as of y• layty haue lightly offended. Aſclepiades replied againe vnto theſe things: beſides y• ſinne of ſacrificing vnto Idols there are (as holy Scriptures do witnes) many other ſinnes vnto death: for the which you depriue onely the clergie &amp; we the layty of the communion, referring vnto God alone y• power of remitting their ſinne. The ſame Atticus had the foreknowledge of his death. for taking his leaue of Nice he ſayd vnto Calliopius the miniſter of that Church: make haſte to Conſtantinople before Autumne that thou mayſt againe ſee me aliue, for if thou linger &amp; make delayes thou ſhalt ſee me no more in this world. In vttering theſe wordes he hitt the trueth on the head, for he departed this life the one and twentieth yeare of his conſecration, the tenth of October, in the eleuenth Conſulſhip of Theodoſius, and the firſt of Valentinianus Caeſar. Theodoſius the Emperour returning from Theſſalonica came ſhort to his funerall, for Atticus was buried the day before the comming of the Emperour into Conſtantinople. Shortly after, the creation of 
                           Ʋalentinianus the yonger was proclaymed, to wit the three and twentieth day of the ſame moneth.

                        Of Siſinius the ſucceſſor of Atticus in the biſhoprick of Conſtantinople.
                     
                     AFter the deſeaſe of Atticus there was great contention in the Churche of Conſtantinople about the election of a Biſhop▪ for ſome woulde haue Philip a miniſter, ſome other Proclus who alſo was a miniſter preferred to the rowme: but all the people with vniforme conſent deſired Siſinius. He was like wiſe a prieſt, not of any of the Churches within the walls of Conſtantinople, but of Elae a Church in the ſuburbes ouer againſt the citie, where all the people of Conſtantinople are wont to celebrate the feaſt of our Sauiours aſcention. All the laytye laboured by all meanes to haue him to their Biſhop, partly becauſe he was counted a very godly man, &amp; partly alſo for that he endeuored to relieue the poore beyond the reach of his ſubſtance. To be ſhort the layty got the vpper hande and Siſinius was conſecrated the eyght and twentieth of February in the twelſe Conſulſhip of Theodoſius, and the ſeconde of 
                           Ʋalentinianus Auguſtus the yonger. Philip the miniſter ſeeing that Siſinius was preferred before him, ſtomacked the matter wonderfully and inueyed bitterly agaynſt his conſecration in the worke which he wrote and intitled the Chriſtian hiſtory. While he inueyeth againſt Siſinius that was conſecrated, agaynſt the Bishops who were conſecrators, and eſpecially agaynſt the laytye who were electors, he wrote ſuch thinges as I am loth to report, for I can not chuſe but blame him greatly that euer he durſt be ſo bold to lay downe ſo raſh and vnaduiſed reaſons. yet in my opinion it will not be amiſſe preſently to ſay ſomewhat of him.

                        PHilip of whome we ſpake before was borne at Sida a citie in Pamphilia, where alſo Trophilus the Sophiſt had his original, of whome Philip boaſted not a litle that he was his kinſman. This Philip being a Deacon and of great familiaritie with Iohn, the Biſhop was as it were driuen to beſtowe great labour and diligence in the ſtudy of good learning, ſo that he wrote many bookes of diuerſe ſortes. his ſtile was aſiaticall, proude, and lofty, and to the ende he might confute the workes of luhan the Emperour, he compiled a volume and intitled it The Chriſtian hiſtorie, the which he deuided into ſix and thirty bookes, euery booke hath ſundry tomes, the number of all mounteth very nigh to a thouſande, the argument prefixed to euery one is in maner as bigge as the tome it ſelfe. this worke he entitled not the Eccleſiaſticall but the Chriſtian hiſtorie, where he patched together many matters for to let the worlde vnderſtand that he was ſeene in Philoſophy. Wherefore he alleadgeth very oft precepts and rules of Geometrie, Aſtronomie, Arithmetick &amp; Muſick. Moreouer he deſcribeth Iſles, mountaines, trees, with other thinges of ſmal importance, ſo that it grewe to a huge volume full of bumbaſt and vayne oſtentation. In my ſimple iudgement it is a worke that is proſitable neyther for the learned neyther the vnlearned. For the learned will condemne the often repetition of the ſame wordes which is ri
                           •
                        e throughout the booke: the vnlearned haue not the capacitie to comprehende the inſolent ſtile and affected ſentences of his arrogant minde. but let euery one iudge of his owne doings as he ſhall thinke good. I dare affirme that the order he followed in laying downe of the times is both confuſe &amp; farre from good order. for when he had runne ouer the raygne of Theodoſius, back againe he getts him to diſcourſe of Athanaſius the Biſhops tymes▪ the which I note to be his vſuall maner. but of Philip ſo farre. Now to the hiſtory of Siſinius tyme.

                        Howe that Siſinius made Proclus Biſhop of Cyzicum, whome the Cyziceni woulde not receaue.
                     
                     AFter the deſeaſe of the Biſhop of Cyzicum, Siſinius
                         appoynted Proclus to be their Biſhop. The citizens vnderſtanding of his comming preuented him and choſe Dalmatius a religious man to gouerne the biſhoprick. This they did neglecting the lawe &amp; canon which commaundeth that no Biſhop be appoynted and ordayned without the conſent and autoritie of the Biſhop of Conſtantinople. They made no accompt of that canon becauſe it commaunded namely (as they thought) that the ſayd autoritie ſhoulde be geuen vnto Atticus alone. Wherefore Proclus being not admitted to execute the function of a biſhop in the Church where he was ordayned, continewed at Conſtantinople, where he occupied him ſelfe in preaching, and purchaſed vnto him

ſelfe thereby great fame and commendation. but of him I ſhal haue occaſion of ſpeake more hereafter. Siſinius had ſcarſe bene Biſhop two yeares when he died, it was in the Conſulſhip of Hierius and Ardaburius, the foure and twentieth of Decembre. He was a man highly commended for temperancie, for godly and vertuous life, and to be ſhorte for his liberalitie beſtowed vpon the poore. He was a man both gentle and familier, playne without fraude or guyle, and therefore he neuer moleſted any in his life. he was a great enemie to buſie bodyes and to quarellers, and therefore taken of many for a cowarde.

                        After the deſeaſe of Siſinius Biſhop of Constantinople Neſtorius was ſent for to Antioch for to enioy the biſhoprick, who immediatly reuealed him ſelfe what kinde of man he was.
                     
                     IT ſeemed good vnto the Emperour after the deſeaſe of Siſinius becauſe ofdiuers vaine glorious perſons to chuſe none of that Church to be biſhop (though many made ſute for Philip, and many againe for Proclus) but determined with him ſelfe to ſend for a ſtraunger out of Antioch. there was in thoſe dayes there a man whoſe name was Neſtorius, by birth he was a Germaine, a loude voice he had and an eloquent tongue, and therefore as it was thought a fitt man to preach vnto the people. They put their heades together, they ſent for Neſtorius and brought him from Antioch to Conſtantinople three moneths after: who though his temperance was highly commended of many, yet the wiſeſt ſort and ſageſt people perceaued well inough his other conditions when he firſt beganne to preach. for immediatly after his ſtalling in the biſhops ſea the tenth day of Aprill &amp; the Conſulſhip of Felix and Taurus, he gaue forth in the hearing of all the people ſuch a ſaying as followeth, at the pronouncing of his oration before the Emperour: Reſtore thou vnto me O Emperour the earth weeded &amp; purged of hereticks, and I will render heauen vnto thee: ayde thou me in 
                           •
                        oyling of the hereticks and I will aſiſt thee in the ouerthrowing of the Perſians. Although ſuch as deteſted the hereticks tooke theſe words in good part: yet ſuch as by his outward behauiour gathered the inward diſpoſition of his minde, could not chuſe but eſpie his hautie ſtomacke, his haſty &amp; running braine, his fooliſh feeding on vaine glory, ſpecially ſeeing yt by and by he bolted out ſuch raſh &amp; vnaduiſed ſayings. Nay we may ſay (as the common prouerbe goeth) that the citie had not drunke before he beganne to blowe the ſmoke and the burning flame of perſecution. for the fift day after he was choſen biſhop, when he determined with him ſelfe to ouerthrowe the church of the Arians where they had their ſeruice priuely and by ſtelth, he ſo troubled and diſquieted their mindes that when they ſaw their Church muſt needes downe, they put to their owne hands &amp; fired it them ſelues, the which fire fell vpon the next houſes and burned them to aſhes, ſo that there was much adoe in the citie, and the Arians roſe vp to reuenge them of their enemies. But God the defender and conſeruer of the citie ſuffered not that peſtilent infection of rankor &amp; malice to runne any further. from that time forth not onely the hereticks but ſuch as were of his owne faith and opinion called Neſtorius a firebrande. Neyther reſted he with this but deſtroyed as much as in him lay the whole citie while he went about to miſchiefe the hereticks. Againe he fell a moleſting of the Nouatians onely becauſe Paulus their biſhop was famous and much ſpoken of for his zeale and godlines. but the Emperour bridled and withſtoode his enterpriſe with ſharp admonitions &amp; nipping words. I thinke it beſt to runne ouer with ſilence the vexations and iniuries he did vnto ſuch as celebrated the feaſte of Eaſter the foureteeneth daye of the moneth throughout Aſia, Lydia and Caria, and how many were caſt away in the ſedition which he rayſed at Miletum and Sardis. But as for the plague and puniſhment he ſuffered partly for the aforeſayd cauſes, and partly alſo for his malapert tongue, I will lay it downe in an other place.

                        Howe that in the raygne of Theodoſius the yonger the Burgonions receaued the fayth in Christ.
                     
                     NOwe am I about to declare a worthy hiſtorie which happened at that time. there is a certaine barbarous nation inhabiting beyond the riuer Rheyne whome we commonly do call Burgonions. theſe people leade a life farre frō magiſtracy &amp; gouernment of y• cōmō weale, for they are all carpenters and thereby get their liuinge. The people called Hunni breaking often

tymes into their regions, haue deſtroyed their contrey and diſpatched very many at ſundry tymes out of the way. Wherefore they determine wt them ſelues not to fly for refuge and ſuccour vnto any mortall man or liuing creature, but to yeld themſelues wholly vnto ſome god or other. And when they called to mind y• the God of the Romaines neuer ſayled ſuch as feared his name and put their affiance in him, ioyntly with one hart and minde they turned them ſelues to embrace the fayth in Chriſt: they tooke their voyage into a certayne citie of Fraunce, and there they require of the Biſhop to baptize them in the Chriſtian faith. The Biſhop hauing enioyned them to faſt ſeuen daies, and inſtructed them in the principles of Chriſtian profeſſion, did baptize them the eyght day following and bid them farewell. They put on valtant courage and went on boldly to encounter with the tyrants, neither was their hope fruſtrate neither did it fayle them in the ende. For the Burgonians (when 
                           Ʋptarus King of the Hunni crommed him ſelfe with vittaills on a certayne night vntill he burſt in the midle) ſet vpon the Hunni nowe wanting a heade and captaine, fewe of them againſt many of the other, to witt three thouſande againſt tenne thouſande, they fought valiantly &amp; gott the victory. From that time forth the ſayd nation was a zealous maintayner of the Chriſtian fayth. About that tyme Barbas the Arian Biſhop died, it was the thirtienth Conſulſhip of Theodoſius. the thirde of

                        Howe Neſtorius vexed the Macedonians.
                     
                     
                        NEſtorius inſomuch he practiſed many things preiudicial vnto the quiet ſtate of the church, procured vnto him ſelfe great hatred euen as the ende of his doings proued ſufficiently vnto vs. Antonius Biſhop of Germa a citie in Helleſpontus, feeding the humor and crueltie of Neſtorius in the rooting out of hereticks, beganne to vexe the Macedonians out of all meaſure, and for to cleare him ſelfe he fayned that the Patriarck to wete, the Biſhop of Conſtantinople had commaunded him the ſame. Wherfore the Macedonians although they ſuffered for a while griefs and vexations, yet ſeeing that Antonie kept no meane but exceeded in crueltie, they coulde no longer beare the weight of ſo intollerable a burthen of iniuries, but in the mad furye of their minde preſerring the raſhe motion of reuengement before all right and reaſon, procured the death of Antonie to be done by ſuch men as they had ſent for to worke the feate. This haynous offence which the Macedonians committed was an occaſion to kindle and ſett on fire the crueltie of Neſtorius. for he perſwaded the Emperour to depriue them of their Churches. Wherefore the Macedonians were put by one church which lay without the olde walls of Conſtantinople. by an other at Cyzicum, beſides many others throughout Helleſpontus, ſo that many of them returned into the Church and embraced the faith of one ſubſtance.

                     COmmonly we ſay that ſuch as are geuen to drunkenneſſe are neuer to ſeeke for the cupp, and buſie bodies neuer want woe: Neſtorius who endeuored with might and mayne to bereaue others of their Churches was by chaunce thruſt out of the Churche him ſelfe, the occaſion was as followeth. Anaſtaſius the prieſt who came with him thither from Antioch: kept himAnaſtaſius. alwayes companye: was highly eſteemed of him and his chiefe counſelour in all his affayres, taught on a certaine tyme in the Church that none ought to call Marie, the mother of God,
                         becauſe that ſhe was but a woman and that God could not be borne of a woman. Theſe words of his diſquieted out of meaſure the mindes both of clergie and laytie. for they had learned of olde that Chriſt was true God and not to be ſeuered becauſe of the miſterie of his incarnation, as man alone from his diuinitie, and that according vnto the minde of the Apoſtle where he ſayth: Although we
                        2. Corinth. 5. 
                        haue knowen Chriſt after the fleshe, yet novve doe vve knovve him ſo no more. Wherefore for this cauſe let vs ceaſſe to reaſon any longer of Chriſt, but let vs endeuer to attayne vnto his perfection. When as ſchiſme and contention was hereof riſen (as I ſayd before) in the Church, Neſtorius going about to confirme the opinion of Anaſtaſius (for he woulde in no wiſe haue him whome he made ſo much of to be rebuked as one that had vttered blaſphemies againſt Chriſt) diſcourſed very oft of that matter as he preached in the Churche: layde downe very contentiouſly certayne

poſitions and condemned vtterly the clauſe that ſignified the bearing of god. And becauſe that diuers men to a diuers ende &amp; purpoſe diſputed of this queſtion, the church was deuided &amp; the members parted aſunder. for much like blind folded perſons &amp; men brawling and fighting in the darke they were caried here and there, now they affirmed this, anone they ſayd that, and loke what they auoutched a litle before, the ſame they denied immediatly after. Many thought that Neſtorius was of the opinion that Chriſt was but onely man and that he went about to reuyue and to rayſe vp a freſh the hereſie of Paulus Samoſatenus and of Photinus. there was ſo much adoe about this matter that the ſummoning of a generall councell ſeemed needefull for the deriding of the controuerſie &amp; the appeaſing of the people. I of mine owne part by peruſing the works of Neſtorius, doe finde the man ignorant and altogether vnlearned, I ſpeake this from the hart and vnfainedly. far it is not of hatred I owe him that I fall a ripping of his crymes and infamie, neyther haue I determined by flattery and feeding of ſome mens humors to report leſſe of him then I founde true. Neſtorius in mine opinion followeth neither Paulus Samoſatenus, neither Photinus, neither thinketh he that ourThe opinion of Neſtorius the heretick. Lord Ieſus Chriſt is onely man: but onely auoideth this clauſe the mother or bearing of God as a ſraying ghoſt. This befell vnto him for his palpable error and ignorance. for though of nature he had a ſmoth and an eloquent tongue and therefore was thought learned, yet to ſay the trueth he was altogether vnlearned. Moreouer he diſdained to peruſe the works of the auncient fathers. he ſo vaimted him ſelfe with his rolling congue and eloquent ſpeach, that in maner he contemned the olde writers and preferred him ſelfe before them all. Againe he was ignorant of that which was1. Ioh. 4. written in the olde coppies of S. Iohns Catholick epiſtle: euery ſpirite which deuideth Ieſus is not of God. As many as went about to ſeuer the diuinitie from the humanitie of Chriſt, ſticked not to raſe and blot this ſentence out of the auncient coppyes. Wherefore the olde writers ſignified no leſſe then that certaine men had corrupted that epiſtle, to the ende they might deuide the humanitie of Chriſt from the diuinitie of God. his manhoode is ioyned with the godhead, neyther are they two but one, in which ſenſe the aūcient writers were not affraid to call Marie, the mother of god,
                         Euen ſo wrote Euſebius Pamphilus in his third booke of the life of Conſtantine. God among vs was

VVherefore Helen the moſt holy Empreſſe hath ſet forth the trauailing of the mother of God with goodly ornaments, &amp; bedecked that hollowe rocke with ſundry notable monuments. Origen
                         hath written no leſſe in the firſt come of his commentaries vpon the epiſtle of S. Paul vnto the Romaines, where he diſcourſeth at large of this matter, and alleadgeth the cauſe why Marie was called the mother of God. Therefore Neſtorius ſeemeth neuer to haue read the wor
                           •
                        s of the auncient fathers, and therefore he inueyed only (as I ſaid before) agaynſt this clauſe the mother of God. For he ſaith not that Chriſt is onely man as Photinus and Paulus Samoſatenus affirmed: neither taketh he away y• ſubſiſtencie of the ſonne of God but confeſſeth euery where that he hath his being and that he is in the trinitie: neither denieth he his eſſence as Photinus and Samoſatenus did (ſo did alſo the Manichees and Montaniſts) as it appeareth by the ſermous which he publiſhed vnto the world. But though I finde that Nestorius was of that opinion, partly by his bookes which I haue peruſed, and partly by the report of his familier friendes, yet his fooliſh and fonde doctrine diſquieted not a litle the whole worlde.

                     WHen theſe thinges were done in ſuch forte as I ſayd before, a certaine haynous offence was committed in the open church and face of the whole people. for ſome noble mans ſeruants, by birth Barbarians, when they had taſted of their Lord &amp; maiſters extreame truelty and coulde not paciently away with the rigor thereof, ranne for refuge vnto the Church, and got them vnto the altare with ſwordes hanging by their ſides. being requeſted to depart they woulde not in any wiſe but diſturbed and hindred deuine ſeruice. Moreouer for the ſpare of many dayes they held their naked ſwordes in their hands ready to diſpatch whoſoeuer came vnto them. Wherefore when they had killed one of the Prieſts and wounded an other, in the ende they ſlewe them ſelues: with the ſight hereof one of them that were preſent ſayde that the profanation of the Churche prognoſticated ſome calamitie to enſue, and repeated two Iambick verſes out of ſome olde Poete to iuſtifie his ſaying.

Cyrillus biſhop of Alexandria to the ende he might moleſt Neſtorius (for he thought very ill of him) vſed certaine preambles of diſputation. When many confirmedNeſtoriꝰ denieth Chriſt

Immediatly after he had ſpoken this he went aſide &amp; ioyned him ſelfe with the Biſhops which held with his opinion▪ ſo that the biſhops then preſent were deuided into two parts▪ ſuch as of the councell held wt 
                        Cyrillus, called Neſtorius before them, he came not but anſwered that he would differr the hearing of his cauſe vntill the comming of Iohn biſhop of Antioch. Wherfore Cyrillus together with the other Biſhops of the councell after they had read ouer the Sermons of Neſtorius the which he had preached vnto the people and gathered out of them that in good earneſt he had vttered open blaſphemies againſt the ſonne of God, depoſed him of his biſhoprick. This being done the Biſhops which helde with Nestorius aſſembled together ſeuerally by them ſelues and depoſed Cyrillus and Memnon Biſhop of Epheſus. Shortly after Iohn Biſhop of Antioch was come, who vnderſtanding of all circumſtances, blamed Cyrillus greatly, as the autor of all that ſturre, and becauſe that vpon a head, he had ſo ſoone depoſed Nestorius. Cyrillus taking Iuuenalis on his ſide for to reuenge him of Iohn, depoſed him alſo. When the contention grewe to be very trouble ſome, when alſo Nestorius perceaued that the poyſoned infection of diſcorde was ſcattered farre and nighe amonge the common

                         his wordes were theſe: Let Marie be called the mother of God, and I pray you conceaue no longer diſpleaſure. But no man thought that he ſpake this and repented from the hart, therefore as yet he dwelleth in Oaſis, both depoſed of his biſhoprick and baniſhed his contrey. Thus was the councell of Epheſus at that tyme broken vp, it was in the Conſulſhip of Baſſus and Antiochus the eyght and twentyeth of Iune. Iohn
                         Biſhop of Antioch after his returne vnto his proper ſeae, called many Biſhops together and depoſed Cyrillus who nowe was gone to Alexandria. Shortly after for all that, they layde aſide all ſpyte, grudge and enmitie, they became friendes and reſtored eche to other their biſhoprickes againe. After the depoſition of Nestorius, there roſe a greate ſchiſme in the Church of Conſtantinople, for the vayne and fooliſh doctrine of Nestorius parted the people aſunder. All the Elergie with vniforme conſent accurſed him openly, for ſo we Chriſtians doe call the ſentence which we pronounce againſt the autor of blaſphemie, whereby we minde to make it ſo manifeſt vnto the worlde as if it were ingrauen in a table, and nayled to an open poſt.

Wherfore three moneths after the depoſition of Neſtorius, Maximianus was choſen Biſhop, a man he was which led a monaſticall life, by degree a Prieſt, one that of late had purchaſed vnto himſelfe a good name and was thought to be a godly man, becauſe he had buylded vpon his owne coſtes and charges the ſepulchres and tumbes where

godly men ſhoulde be interred▪ he was a man altogether vnlearned, who determined with him ſelf to leade a quiet life void of all care and moleſtation.

It was an indifferent matter of olde time among the auncient fathers as oft as the Eccleſiaſticall affayres ſo conſtrayned to tranſlate biſhops from one ſeae vnto an other. If it be any thing auaileable to annect the canon decreed in this behalfe vnto this our preſent hiſtory, let vs ſee howe ſhameleſſe theſe men were who therefore thruſt Proclus beſides the biſhopricke of Conſtantinople, and how vntruely they reported of the canon, for it is read as followeth. If any Bishop

Theſe be the wordes of the Canon. But that it may appeare more euidently that many Biſhops were tranſlated from one citye vnto an other vpon neceſſary and vrgent cauſes, I wil here lay downe the names of ſuch as were remoued. Perigenes being choſen biſhop of Patras in Achaia and refuſed by the citizens of that place, was byPerigenes. the commaundement of the Biſhop of Rome placed in the Metropolitane ſeae of Corinth to ſucceedeGregorie Nazianzene. the late deſeaſed, where he continewed all the reſt of his life.

                     NOwe I thinke it not amiſſe to write a fewe lynes of Siluanus whome we ſayd a litle before to haue bene tranſlated from the biſhoprick of Philippopolis in Thracia vnto Troas. This Siluanus firſt ſtudied Rhetorick in the ſchoole of Troilus the Sophiſt: who though he was an earneſt embracer of Chriſtian religion and exerciſed the monaſticall trade of liuing, yet wore he ſtill the philoſophicall habit. In proceſſe of tyme Atticus the Biſhop ſent for him and made him Biſhop of Philippopolis. who hauing continewed in Thracia the ſpace of three yeares when he coulde no longer away with the pinching colde of that contrey (for he had a thinne and a weake bodye) he requeſted Atticus to ſubſtitute an other Biſhop in his rowme, proteſtinge that he left Thracia for no other cauſe but onely to auoyde the extreame colde. Siluanus then hauing procured

an other biſhop to ſucceede him, remayned at Conſtantinople and exerciſed continewally the monaſticall trade and diſcipline▪ he was ſo farre from pride and hautines of ſtomack that often times in the thick aſſemblies and ſolemne meetings of the citizens he wore ſcandals and buſ kin
                           •
                         of twiſted haye Shortly after the Biſhop of Troas departed this life, and immediatly the people Troes came to Conſtantinople for to ſeeke a Biſhop. Atticus muzing with him ſelfe whome he might prefere to the rowme, Siluanus by chaunce came by: as ſoone as Atticus eſpied him, he ceaſſed to bethinke him ſelfe and turned vnto Siluanus with theſe wordes: thou mayſt no longer excuſe thy ſelfe but of neceſſity thou muſt take vpon thee the gouernment of the Church, for in Troas there is no chilling colde, beholde God hath prouided for the infirmitie of thy body a delectable and pleaſant ſoyle, make no more adoe brother but in haſt get thee to Troas. To be ſhort Siluanus went thither. Here I thinke very well to lay downe the miracle which he wrought. A greate ſhip or hulke (for the bredth thereof called plate) being fraighted and laden with great pillours &amp; newely made vpon the ſhore or rode of Troas, could not be drawen from the land to take ſea, no, for all the Pilote together with a greate multitude of men drewe her with cable ropes ſhe woulde not moue. When they had the ſpace of many dayes aſſaid what they could doe and nothing preuayled, they thought verily that ſome deuill helde the hulke from mouing. Wherefore they went vnto Siluanus the Biſhop and requeſt him to pray in that place, for ſo they hoped it woulde come to paſſe that the ſhip might be drawen into y• ſea▪ but he excuſed him ſelf very modeſtly, ſayd that he was a ſinner, &amp; told them that he could not helpe them, that it was the office of a iuſt man. But ſeeing they were ſo importunate vpon him that they woulde not be anſwered, he came to the ſhore, there he prayed vnto God, tooke the rope by the ende and bad the reſt doe their endeuour. The ſhip being ſhaken with a litle violence was brought by a litle and a litle into the mayne ſeae. This miracle which Siluanus wrought allured many of that prouince to embrace with feruent zeale the chriſtian faith. Siluanus alſo expreſſed no leſſe in other acts and dealings of his the good motion of his godly mind. When he perceaued that the clergie reſpected nothing but gaine in deciding the controuerſies of their clients, he ſuffered thence forth none of the clergie to be iudge, but tooke the ſupplications and requeſts of ſuters: appoynted one of the laytie whome for certainty he knewe to be a iuſt and a godly man: gaue him the hearing of their cauſes and ſo ended quietly all contentions and quarells▪ for the aforeſayd cauſes Siluanus became renowmed and famous among all men. Thus farre of Siluanus, &amp; though we may ſeeme herein to haue digreſſed, yet haue we remembred ſuch things as may tende to the profitt &amp; commoditie of the reader. But now let vs returne where we left. When Maximianus was choſen Biſhop of Conſtantinople in the Conſulſhip of Baſſus and Antiochus, the church enioyed peace and quietnes.

A certayne Iewe being a ſubtill knaue fayned himſelf to be Moſes and ſaid that he came downe from heauen for to leade the Ievves which inhabited that Iſle through the ſeae into the firme and mayne lande: that he was the ſame who of olde did ſafe conduyte Iſrael through the redde ſeae. For the ſpace of one whole yeare he did nothinge elſe but wander from one cytye to the other throughout the Iſle, vſinge all meanes poſſible to perſwade the Ievves which dwelled there to creditt him, and exhorting them to leaue all their wealthe and ſubſtance behynde them▪ for he promyſed to brynge them through the ſeae drye footed into the lande of promiſe. When that he had bewytched them with ſuche vayne and deceatefull hope, they left their worke and trade of life: they ſett nought by their wealthe and ſubſtance: and they gaue lycence to him that lyſted for to poſſeſſe them. When the daye appoynted of the falſe Ievve for the voyage was come, he led them the waye, all the reſt beganne to followe after together with women and children▪ he brought them to a certayne mountayne whiche laye as it were an elbowe into the ſeae warde and thence he bad them caſte them ſelues into the ſeae. Wherefore ſuch as firſte came vnto the fall did ſo, wherof ſome were cruſhed tumbling downe the hyll, ſome other were drowned in the ſeae and dyed immediatly, it woulde haue coſt many more theyr liues had not the prouydence of God prouyded better for them. For as God

would there were nigh them many Chriſtians whereof ſome were fiſhermen, and ſome other marchants, they drewe vp ſome which were almoſt choked vp with water &amp; ſaued their liues who being in this lamentable plight acknowledged their folly: they ſtayd others frō plunging thēſelues in the waues of the ſeae, laying before their eyes ye death of the Iewes which leade them the daūce. They perceaued then the guyle, they blamed them ſelues for being ſo credulous, they went about to kill the counterfait Moſes.

                        Howe the Church of the Nouatians was ſet on fire.
                     
                     SHortly after Paulus the Nouatian biſhop although aforetime counted a very godly man, yetAnno Dom. 437. then ſpecially it fel out y• men conceaued a farre better opinion of his piety thē euer they did before. At Conſtātinople there happned ſuch a fire y• like whereof was not remebred before. For the greater parte of the citie was conſumed to aſſes, the famous graynard, the market houſe called Achilleus were quite burned. Laſt of all the fire crept into the Nouatian church which adioyned vnto the ſigne of the Storck. Wherefore Paulus as ſoone as he perceaued the churche to be in great daunger, fell proſtrate before the Altare, referred vnto God in his prayer the preſeruatiō of the church, neither ceaſſed he to inculcate as well the remembrance of the citie as of the church. God as it proued in the end gaue eare vnto his prayers. For all ye fire flaſhed into the church both by dore and by windowe, yet was there no harme done: nay though the buylding round about was on fire, though the church was inuironed wt burning flames by the power of God the church was preſerued and ouercame the furie &amp; rage of the fire. It was not quenched the ſpace of two dayes &amp; two night,s the citie burned all that while, In the end though many partes of the citie were vtterly come to nought, yet the church (as I ſayde before) eſcaped that lamentable ouerthrowe. And that which was more to be wondred at, no ſigne of the ſmoke, no ſcorching of the flame, no parching of the heat could be ſeene vpon the timber, beames, or walls. This came to paſſe the ſeauenteenth of Auguſt in the fourteenth Conſulſhip of Theodoſius and the firſt of Maximus. The Nouatians ſince that time doe yearely keepe holyday the ſeauenteeneth of Auguſt in remembrance y• their church was then miraculouſly preſerued from fire, at what time they render vnto God harty thankes: all men doe reuerence that church for the miracle, and not only the Chriſtians but alſo ye Ethniks doe honor it as an holy place. So farre of that.

At what time Theodoſius the Emperour plaid a very wiſe part. For leſt that tumult &amp; diſſention ſhould be raiſed againe in ye church, wtout any further delay, while as yet ye corps of Maximianus was aboue groūd he procured the biſhops then preſent to ſtall Proclus in the Biſhops ſeae. To this end the letters of Celeſtinus biſhop of Rome were brought vnto Cyrill biſhop of Alexandria, vnto Iohn biſhop of Antioch &amp; vnto Ruffus biſhop of Theſſalonica, certifieng them that there was no cauſe to the contrary but that one either alredy nominated biſhop of ſome certaine citie, or ſtalled in ſome proper ſea might be tranſlated vnto an other biſhopricke. As ſoone as Proclus then tooke poſſeſſion of the biſhoprick, he ſolemnized the funerall of Maximianus and interred his corps.

                     NOwe fit oportunity is offred to ſay ſomewhat of Proclus. This Proclus from his youth vp was a reader, he frequented the ſchooles and was a great ſtudent of Rhetoricke. When he came to mans eſtate he had great familiarity with Atticus, for he was his ſcribe. Atticus
                        
ſeeing his forewardnes in learning &amp; good behauiour in life made him Deacon. But whē he was thought worthy the degree of a prieſt, Siſinius (as I ſayd before) made him Biſhop of Cyzicum. But theſe things were done a good while before. At that time as I ſaye he was choſen Biſhoppe of Conſtantinople. A man he was of a maruelous good life, for being trained vp vnder Atticus he became an earneſt follower of his vertuous ſteps. As for paciēt ſufferāce he farr excelled Atticus. Euen as Atticus as time and place required could terrifie the heretickes: ſo he behaued him ſelf tractable towardes all men &amp; perſwaded him ſelfe that it was farre eaſier for him by faire meanes to allure vnto the Churche then by force to compell them vnto the faythe. He determined to vexe no ſecte whatſoeuer: but reſerued and reſtored vnto the Churche that renowmed vertue of meekeneſſe required in Clergie men. Wherein he imitated the Emperourē 
                        Theodoſius. For euen as it pleaſed him not to execute the Emperiall ſworde agaynſte ſuche as committed haynous crimes and wrought treaſon: ſo Proclus made no accompt at all of ſuche as were of the contrary fayth and opinion.

But howe he brought that to paſſe I will now declare. When he had firſt perſwaded the Emperour, he cauſed the corps of Iohn bnried at Comanum, to be tranſlated to Conſtantinople fiue and thirty yeares after his depoſition and ſolemnly with great pompe and reuerēce to be iuterred in the Apoſtles Church.

This was done in the ſixteenth Conſulſhip of Theodoſius the Emperour, the eight and twentieth of Ianuary.

                     NOt long after they had interred the corps of Iohn in the Apoſtles church, Paulus the Nouatian departed this life, it was in the aforeſayd Conſulſhip y• one &amp; twentieth of Iuly. His hearſe reconciled in maner vnto y• church all the varieng ſects &amp; opinions. For all came together to his buriall &amp; brought his corps to y• graue wt ſinginge of pſalmes. He was the man that was greatly beloued throughout his life time for his ſincere and vpright behauiour. And inſomuch he did a worthye acte a litle before his departure I thoughte good to penne it in this our preſente hiſtorie to the profitte of the ſtudious reader in time to come. That he vſed his wonted dyete of the Monaſticall diſcipline all the while he was ſicke, without any chaunge or alteration thereof, that he ceaſſed not to praye continewallye I haue determined to runne ouer with ſilence, leaſte while I linger aboute the recitall of theſe I maye ſeeme anye kinde of waye to deface the Acte of his bothe worthye (as I ſayde) of memorye and the profitte of the Reader. It was as followeth. Paulus beinge ready to departe out of this life called the Prieſtes within this iuriſdiction before him, and ſayde thus vnto them: prouide you a Biſhoppe while as yet there remayneth breath in my bodye leſt after my departure the Churches be ſette on tumultes and diſſention. When they had anſwered, that the election of a Biſhop was in no wiſe to be referred vnto them (for they ſayd, one of vs is of this minde, an other of that mind, and therefore it is vnpoſſible we ſhould agree vpō
                        
one man, but we would haue thee to name him whome thy pleaſure is we ſhoulde chuſe) after the hearing of their reaſon he replied▪ why then deliuer me this your promiſe in wryting, that you wil elect whome ſoeuer I ſhall nominate. When the bonde was made and ſubſcribed vnto with theyr hands, firſt he lifted him ſelfe a litle out of his bed, nexte he wrote ſecretelye within the bonde vnknowē vnto thē that were preſent the name of Marcianus who was a prieſt, and had bene trained vp vnder him in the Monaſticall diſcipline, but then as it fell out was not preſente. Laſte of all he ſealed it, he willed y• chiefe prieſts to doe the ſame, he deliuered it vnto Marcus the Nouatiā
                         biſhop of Scythia who thēwas in the citie &amp; ſayd vnto him as followeth▪ If it pleaſe God that I may reconer and lengthen my dayes yet a while longer in this world, deliuer me this bond which I geue thee to keping, but if his pleaſure ſo be that I muſt needes depart and finiſh the race of this frail &amp; tranſitory life, thou ſhalt finde his name written in this bonde whome I haue nominated to be my ſucceſſor in the biſhoprick. Theſe words were no ſooner vttered but he gaue vp the Ghoſt. Three days after his departure out of this life the bond was opened in the preſence of a great multitude, when they found that Marcianus was therein nominated, all with one conſent lifted theyr voices &amp; ſayd he was a fit man for the function, and immediatly they ſent to ſeeke him out. When they had happely met with him at Tiberiopolis a citie in Phrygia, they take him and bring him thence, in ye end he was placed in Paulus rowme y• one and twentieth day of the aforeſaid moneth. But of theſe things thus much ſhall ſuffice.

                     HItherto (Christian reader) haue I tranſlated Euſebius &amp; Socrates, vvhich continevved their hiſtories from the birth of Chriſt vnto the raigne of Theodoſius Iunior. I vvould haue thee knovve that at one tyme vvith Socrates there vvrote tvvo other Grecians, Sozomenus and Theodoret, beginninge vvhere Socrates beganne, and endinge their hiſtories vvith him at Theodoſius Iunior. Their argument is one, to vvit: The Eccleſiaſticall hiſtorie, their language one, they vvrote all in Greeke, their yeares one, for they florished the ſame tyme. Little difference there is betvvene them in ſubstance, ſauinge vvhere the one is longe the other short, vvhere the one is obſcure, the other playne, vvhere the one is taedious, the other pleaſaunt. To tranſlate them all three, vvoulde not in my opinion be ſo profitable as paynefull, the volume both vvoulde be toe huge, and the reader ſoone vvearyed vvith the oft repetition of one thinge. Caſſiodorus the Senatour and compiler of the Tripartite historie, preuentinge this inconuenience, and ſeeyng that theſe three vvriters agreed in ſubstance, deuiſed vvith him ſelfe hovve to eaſe the reader of ſo greate a labour, and hovve to rydde him from ſo taedious a ſtudie. He made an Epitome or briefe collection of them all three, I meane Socrates, Sozomenus, and Theodoret, and called it the Tripartite historie. The creditt of the Epitome and collector doeth not counteruayle the authoritie of the author, Antiquitie vvith the trueth is to be preferred. Therefore in tranſlating, I thought farre better thou shouldest ſee, not the authors to auoyde repetition and vveariſome reading, but the author him ſelfe, I meane Socrates alone, in ſteede of the tvvo other, vvhome I haue choſen as the ſoundest vvriter, the faithfullest hiſtoriographer, and the abſolutest delyuerer of the historie in all poyntes vnto the posteritie. VVherefore if ought be vvell done, geue the prayſe vnto God, lette the paynes be myne, and the profit the Readers.

                     WHē I cal to memorie (right vvorshipful) the ſaying of the holy Apostle S. Paul, that God according vnto his vnſearcheable vviſedome choſe not many vviſe men according vnto the fleshe, not many mightie men, not many noble men to plant the principles of his Goſpell amonge the nations vnder heauen: I can not chuſe but honor ſtudious nobilitie, and reuerence vertue vvhere I finde her for the rareneſſe thereof. hovve precious is a litle ſiluer amonge a great deale of droſſe: one fruitfull tree in a vvide barren forest: one ruddye roſe amonge manie pricking thornes: one pearle though founde in a puddle of mire: one tvvinkeling ſtarre through manie thicke and mystie cloudes: one Lotte in Sodome: one Helias in Iſrael: one Iob in Huſſe: one Tobias in Niniue: one Phoenix in Arabia: and one Euagrius a noble gentleman, imploying his trauell to the furtherance of the Eccleſiasticall affayres? Dionyſius byshopp of Alexandria vvritinge a booke of repentaunce ſent it to Conon byshopp of Hermopolis, vvho by repentaunce had renounced the idolatrie of pagans, and zealouſly cleaued to the Chriſtian profeſsion, as a fit reader of ſo vvorthy a theame: Origen vvriting of martyrs ſent his treatiſe vnto Ambroſe and Protoctetus miniſters of Caeſarea, ſuch as had endured great affliction and grieuous croſſes vnder Decius the emperour, vvhere they might haue a vievv of their valiant and inuincible courage: The philoſophers of Alexandria &amp; Aegypt, ſuch as in thoſe dayes excelled in prophane literature, vvrote great volumes of their profound ſkill, and ſent them vnto the famous philoſopher and Christian doctor Origen, the great clarke of Alexandria: Of mine ovvne part (right vvorshipfull) not attributing vnto my ſelf, ſuch excellency of vvit, &amp; ſingularitie of giftes as raigned in the aforeſaide vvriters, vvhen I had finished the tranſlation of the former histories, I meane Euſebius and Socrates, &amp; dedicated them vvhere duety did binde me vnto the right honorable and my very good Lady, the Counteſſe of Lyncolne, I thought good to ſend this preſent tranſlation of Euagrius vnto your vvorship, a noble Gentleman, vnto a vvorshipfull Eſquier, a lieuetenant of Antioch, vnto the Shiriffe of Sommerſet, a learned hiſtoriographer vnto on that is no leſſe ſtudious, of great fame vnto one that is of as good report, a furtherer of religion vnto a fauourer of ſuch as profeſſe the ſame. It is tolde me of trueth, nay I haue found my ſelfe ſufficient triall of your curteſie and vertuous diſpoſition. VVhen I trauelled novve tvvo yeares agoe at the requeſt of a deare friende and kinſman of mine in your countye of Sommerſet, and ſavve the good vvill you bare vnto your neighbours and tenauntes, the entire loue and affection they ovved vnto you againe, I called to remembraunce the ſayinge of Eberhardus Duke of VVittenberge in the Parlament helde at VVormes of all the princes of Germanie, in the time of Maximilian. Euerie of the nobylitie commended his ovvne cuntreye, the Princes of Saxonie prayſed their myne pittes and quarries, their precious mettalls: the Dukes of Bauaria ſette foorth the maiesticall buyldinge and portly Cyties vvythin their dominions: the Duke Palatine extolled the fertylitie of his ſoyle, the plentifulneſſe of his grape, and the pleaſauntneſſe of his vvyne: Duke Eberhardus holdinge

his peace &amp; harkning to the rest, vvas requeſted of Friderick Duke of Saxonie to ſay ſomevvhat for his ovvne cuntrey. I knovve not (ſaith he) vvhat commendation I shoulde geue my cuntrey, but ſure I am of this one thinge, that I may ſafely lay my heade and ſleepe in the lappe of any ſubiect vvithin my dominions, by day or by night, at home or abroade. as muche to ſay he gouerned his cuntrey ſo vertuouſly that the commonalty vvould liue and die vvith him, the vvhich ſying of his by the cenſure and opinion of all the princes deſerued the greatest prayſe. If I may ſpeake vnfainedly vvhat I thought, I tooke his caſe to be yours, the iudgment he gaue of his dominions to be the report you giue of your cuntrey, and novve I thinke the godly rule of his people thē, to be preſently the politick gouernment of your shiriffvvike, you remember I am ſure (naye I ſee it in you my ſelfe) hovve the painter ſetteth forth the portracture of the emperours of Germanie, holding a booke in the right hand &amp; a ſvvord in the left. the booke betokeneth knovvledge of the lavve, the ſvvorde execution of iuſtice. many there are novve a dayes vvhich ſue for ſuche offices, in mine opinion they are not the fittest men, they reſpect not the afore ſaide conditions but their ovvne lucre and the making vp of their bags for that yeare. Iouianus refuſed the empire of the vvhole vvorld vvhen it vvas offred him: Ambroſe vvoulde in no vviſe be made byshoppe of Millaine: Euſebius could not be perſvvaded to take the byshoprick of Antioch, Conſtantinus magnus vvrote of him that in ſo doing he vvas vvorthie to be byshop of the chiefest Churche vnder heauen: it vvas against your vvill that you tooke the office vpon you, I knovve it full vvell, therefore you deſerue the greater prayſe and commendation. Novve that you are in office hearken vvhat a learned Poët ſeeing his friende choſen magiſtrate, vvrote vnto him, it vvas in ſuch ſort as follovveth:
                  Da, capias, quaeras, plurima, pauca, nihil.
                  By interpretation, geue much: take litle: ſeeke nothing, he meant by extortion. Ariſtotle bad Alexander remember that gouernment vvas not inſolencie, oppreſsion and iniurie, but execution of iustice, helping vvith counſell and maintaining of right. Erneſtus Duke of Luneburge vvas mindefull of his calling, vvhen he cauſed a burning candle to be ſtamped in his coyne vvith theſe letters in compaſſe. A. S. M.

I preſume that of your good nature you vvill take the premiſes in good part, conſidering they proceede of good vvill and frendly remembrance for the great curteſie I haue receaued. It is the part of a friende not onely to be thankefull for the benefits beſtovved vpon him, and to commend vertuous diſpoſition vvhere he findeth the ſame, but alſo exhorte his friende to goe on in vvell doing and vvish the continuance thereof. If that herein I haue diſcharged ſome part of my duetie, take it vvell in vvorth &amp; accept it vvith as louing a minde as the Tranſlator vvas vvillinge to take penne in hand to commende it vnto you vvith a preface.

                        EVagrius a noble man of Antioch a learned writer and continewer of this Eccleſiaſticall hiſtorie may not lightly be ouerskipped with out commending of his prayſe and vertues to immortall memorie, and rehearſing of them to the encouragement of all ſtudious nobilitie, to the profite of the louing reader, and the furtherance of chriſtian profeſſion. his honor was nothing impaired, his blood nothing blemiſhed at all, in that he being a tēporall man acquainted him ſelfe with eccleſiaſticall affaires. Sabellicus writeth that Bartolomevve the ApoſtleSabellicus. came of a noble race, forſoke the brauery of courtiers, and became the follower of Chriſt.

Aſtyrius a Senator of Rome, thought it no ſtaining of his honor, to take vp on his ſhoulders the deade bodie of a bleſſed martyr, and prouide for it a funeral. Iouianus, Valentinianus and Valens, noble men and afterwards Emperours one after the other, threwe away their ſword girdles, left their offices, departed the court of Iulian the Apoſtata, rather then they woulde deny Chriſt. Yet S. Paule ſaith that not many wiſe men according vnto the fleſhe: not manie mightie, not manie noble men are called. true it is in reſpect of a greater number of the contrary, or rather we may ſay that theſe were not fleſhly minded, their diſpoſition was not carnall, their wiſedome was not worldly. how great a comfort is it vnto chriſtian profeſſion when princes become foſterers, when Queenes become nurces, and noble men become fauourers of the chriſtian faith? In ſome countries we ſee that noble men moſt of all ſpend their time in ſtudie and learning. It is not decent in ſome countries for the peſants ſonne, the farmour, the frankline, or howſoeuer ye terme him to forget his fathers ruſticall toile, &amp; forthwith addict him ſelf to the gentlemans trade. The Pope moſt commonly calleth noble men to his colledge of Cardinals, Dukes and Earles yongeſt ſonnes, he vſed to make Cardinals ſometimes in their cradles. Biſhops and Archbiſhops in many countreis deſcende of noble houſes. Oſorius Biſhops of Luſitania in Portingall writing againſt M. Haddon, ſticked not to giue vs an inklinge of his parentage.

I ſee that Euagrius vvho in the time of Tiberius Conſtantinus was Quaeſtor, and in the time of Mauricius Tiberius was maiſter of the rolles, together with diuers others occupied themſelues about Eccleſiaſticall affaires, but I highly commend ſuch as ſhewe forth tokens of their nobilitie by ſtudie of vertue, politicke gouernement of their countrey, noble proweſſe, valiauntneſſe of courage, maintenance of the trueth, and furtheraunce of the Goſpell. ſome thinke it is inough for them to bayte at the vniuerſitie, there ſteale a degree and forth with be counted gentlemen: or to be in commons in one of the Innes of court, where there are many wiſe, zealous, and learned gentlemen: or to get into ſome noble mans ſeruice, and by vertue of the cognizance to be called a maiſter: or to purchaſe for a piece of money a coate armour: or to begge a farme, and by vertue of the valuation in the queenes bookes to become a gentleman. Euery one thinkes not I am ſure, that theſe ſorts of men are to be numbred among the auncient &amp; noble houſes, though in proceſſe of time antiquitie ſeeme topreuaile very muche with ſuche kinde of men, long poſſeſſion is a great matter in lawe and an olde deede though it be forged will further the matter very much.

Amaſis king of AEgypt being baſely borne, made his image of gold, ſet it vp to be worſhippedAmaſis. Smerdes. that the people might reuerence him the more. Smerdes a ſorcerer becauſe he was in perſon like Smerdes the brother of Cambyſes King of the Aſsyrians (whoſe death Cambyſes procured fearinge he woulde aſpire vnto the kingdome) made the worlde beleeue he was the man in deede, ouercame Cambyſes and was crowned King, but his wife and bedfellow with clipping and other wonted familiarity, felt his head, found that Smerdes had no eares, reuealed it abrode, and ſo was he betrayd and depoſed his kingdome.

This Phocas murthered the Emperour Mauricius, obtayned the Empire through treaſon, a fitte man to be founder of ſo worthie an acte. Note I beſeeche you howe that in his time God ſeemed vtterly to withdrawe his bleſſing: Fraunce, Spaine, Germanie, Lumbardie, and the greateſt part of the eaſt fell from the Empire for euer, ſuch a wrecke to the ſtate as neuer had bene ſene before.

                           EVſebius ſyrnamed Pamphilus, a man without all peraduenture as in other thinges profounde ſo in penninge excellent, is of ſuch efficacie in his works, y• although he can not make the readers perfect chriſtians, yet can he ſo draw them by perſwaſion that with prompt and willing mindes they will embrace the Chriſtian fayth. Euſebius, Socrates, Sozomenus, &amp; Theodoret haue written moſt exquiſitly of the incarnation of our moſt louing ſauiour, of his aſcention into the heauens, of the famous acts of the Apoſtles, of the combats and perſecutions of y• holy martyrs, &amp; what other thing ſo euer was thought worthy the noting, or otherwiſe vnto ſome part of Theodoſius iunior his raigne: In ſo much therefore ſuch thinges as enſued after ſeeme nothing inferior vnto the reſt, and haue bene hitherto recorded in no perfect order, although alſo I my ſelfe ſeeme vnfitt by reaſon of my ſmale habilitie to take ſo great an enterpriſe in hand, yet I take it to be my duetie to imploy what labour and induſtrie lieth in me for the compyling of this worke, and to put my whole truſt and confidence in him which indued the fiſhermen with heauenly wiſedome, and filed the rough tongue for readie deliuerie and ſoundinge of euery ſyllable, to thend I may reuiue the famous actes which nowe doe ſlumber in the duſte of forgetfulneſſe, ſo ſturre them with my penne and print them to immortall memory, that not onely euerie man may know what hath happened vntill this our age, when, where, in what ſort, againſt whome, by what men, but alſo that no worthie act through recheleſſe ſecuritie, and languiſhinge ſlouthfulneſſe the ſiſter of obliuion, be cleane put out of remembrance. Wherefore by the helpe of almightie God there will I beginne to write where the aforeſaide writers made an end of their hiſtories, when the outragious crueltie of Iulian had ſucked his fill of the bleſſed ſainctes and martyres blood, when the mad furie of Arius falſe and counterfeit doctrine was bridled with the ſounde canons of the Nicene councell, when both Eunomius and Macedonius were ſore pricked at Bosphorus with the power of the holy Ghoſte and vtterly foyled at the famous Cytye of Constantinople, when the holy Churche had purged her of her filthe and infection the whiche ſhe lately receiued and now recouered her former glorie, being as it were all layde ouer with gliſtering golde, and gorgeouſly araid for her louer and bridegrome: Satan the ſworne aduerſarie to all godlineſſe, becauſe he could not away with theſe graces and benefites beſtowed from aboue, raiſed againſt vs a ſtraunge battaile contrarie to the courſe of nature. And when he ſawe the idolatrie of pagans was trode in the puddle of contempt, &amp; that the ſeruile and abiect opinion of Arius was quite baniſhed the Churche, although he ſtaggered and ſtaide openly from oppugninge the chriſtian faith, ſpecially ſeeing it was confirmed and fortified by ſo many auncient and godly fathers (for in beſieging and aſſaulting of it, his power was very muche diminiſhed) ſecretly and byThe polli

Whereas a foretime he had one aduerſarie, now craftely he ſeemed to reuerence and in maner to embrace the ſame: his deuiſe and endeuour was not to withdrawe the Church generally from the whole faith, but to ſee whether he might poſſibly corrupt one worde or ſyllable compriſed therein. Wherefore being wrapped in his owne malice he craftely went about to alter, yea one letter which ſeemed to appertaine vnto the ſenſe and vnderſtanding of the ſentence▪ but how in pronunciation he ſeuered the tongue from the trueth of the worde, ſo that the ſounde and ſenſe of the phraſe might not iointly laude God and extoll him with diuine prayſes, moreouer into what iſſue neither of them did

Anastaſius a certain prieſt of a corrupt and peruerſe opinion, an earneſt maintainer of the Jewiſhe doctrine of Neſtorius, and his companion in the voyage he tooke from Antioch to be byſhop of Conſtantinople, whē he heard the leude reaſons and conference which Nestorius had with Theodolus at Mopſouestia in Cicilia, he fell from the right fayth, and as Theodorus writeth of that matter in a certaine epiſtle, he preſumed in the open audience of the Church of Constantinople in the hearing of ſuch people as ſerued God deuoutly to ſay theſe wordes: let no man call Marie, the mother of God,
                         for Marie (ſaithThe fonde eaſon of Anaſtaſius. he) was a woman, and it is vnpoſſible that God ſhoulde be borne of a woman. when the religious people miſliked with his reaſons and counted not without cauſe of his doctrine as of blaſphemie: Neſtorius the ringleader of his impietie not onely not forbad him, neither maintained the right opinion, but firſt of all confirmed his ſayings to be true, and was very earneſt in the defence of them. Wherefore after he had annexed and lincked thereunto his owne opinion, and the deuiſe of his owne braine, when he had powred into the Church of God the venome of his poyſoned doctrine,The blaſpherie of Neorius. he endeuoured to eſtabliſh a farre more blaſphemous ſentence to his owne deſtruction. he ſaid as followeth: I verily will not call him God who grewe to mans ſtate by two monethes, three moneths and ſo forth, euen as Socrates Scholaſticus and the former councell helde at Epheſus haue informed of him.

                        Howe Neſtorius the hereticke was depoſed by the councell of Epheſus in the abſence of Iohn byſhoppe of Antioch,
                     
                     When the day appointed for their meeting and fifteene dayes ouer were expired, the byſhops which aſſembled at Epheſus thinking verily that the eaſterne byſhops would not come, or if peraduenture they came it woulde be long ere they mette together, when as Cyrill alſo moderated the councell in ſteade of Celeſtinus who (as I ſaid before) gouerned the ſeae of Rome, called Neſtorius before them and willed him to aunſwere vnto the crimes that were laid to his charge. And when as the firſt day he promiſed to come if the caſe ſo required, and being afterwardes thriſe cited to appeare, made light accompt of his promiſe, the byſhops that were preſent called the matter into controuerſie, and began to reaſon thereof. Wherefore after that Memnon byſhop of Epheſus had numbred the dayes that were paſt ſince the preſcribed time, to wit, ſeuenteene: after they had reade the epiſtles of the reuerende Cyrill vnto Nestorius, and ſuche as he wrote vnto Cyrill againe, together with the holy epiſtle of the renowmed Celestiniu ſent in like ſort vnto Nestorius: after that Theodotus byſhop of Ancyra, and Acacius byſhop of Melitina, had made relation of the blaſphemous ſentences whiche Nestorius bolted out at Epheſus: and after that many notable ſayinges to the iuſtifying of the ſincere fayth were vttered in that aſſembly ofThe ſentence of the councell of Epheſus pronounced againſt Neſtorius the heretick. holy and learned fathers interlacing ſometimes the vnaduiſed and blaſphemous phraſes of Nestorius, the holy councell pronounced this ſentence againſt Nestorius in maner as followeth: Omitting other hainous crimes of the reuerend Nestorius, in ſo much he was cited and would not appeare, neither entertaine the moſt holy and religious byshops which we had ſent vnto him, vve were driuen of neceſſitie to ſifte and examine his leude and wicked doctrine: And ſeeinge vve founde him to haue belieued impiouſly and to haue taught heretically, partly by peruſing of his bookes and epiſtles, and partly alſo by the blaſphemous ſentences he vttered of late in this noble citie, we were moued both by the canons of the Church and the graue cenſure of the moſt holy father &amp; our College Celestinus byshop of Rome (yet not without sheding of many teares) to pronounce againſt him this ſeuere and sharpe ſentence.

Then Cyrill and Memnon were abſolued, and Iohn with his clergie excommunicated

and depriued of al prieſtly autoritie. but when Theodoſius (who at the firſt miſliked with the depoſing of Nestorius, yet afterwardes vnderſtanding fully of his blaſphemous opinion conſented thereunto) had ſent his gracious and godly letters vnto Cyrill of Alexandria, and to Iohn of Antioch, they became friends and ratified the ſentence pronounced againſt Nestorius.

Neither is it poſſible that God shoulde lye, which ſaith: As truely as I liue, I doe glorifie them which glorifie me▪ but when the Lorde our brother, and moſt godly fellovve byshop Paulus came to Alexandria, I was vvonderfull glad, for I coulde not otherwiſe chuſe: becauſe that he being a notable man became a meane, laboured in preaching beyond the reache of his ſtrength, to thende he might ouercome the enuie of Satan, couple together in loue the looſe and ſeuered members of the Churche, and reduce our Church in like ſort with yours vnto peace and vnitie. Immediately after he wrote as followeth: Now I am fully perſwaded that the quarrell which roſe in the Church was fond, and beganne vpon light occaſion, in ſo much my moſt vertuous Lord Paulus the byshopp brought letters vnto me, compriſing a ſound and ſyncere proteſtation of the faith, the which he auoutched to haue bene written of your holineſſe and of the moſt godly byshops whiche are of your prouince. The forme and phraſes of Cyrills epiſtle were as is aforeſayde, but toutching the clauſe which ſignified the mother of God, there was written as followeth. VVhen we had peruſed the godly ſentences and clauſes within contained, and perceaued plainely that you were of one minde and opinion with vs (for there is but one Lorde, one fayth, one baptiſme) we rendered vnto God diuine prayſes who is the conſeruer of the whole worlde: and preſently we conceaue exceeding ioye, ſeeing that as well your Churches as ours being driuen thereunto partly by the force and power of the holy ſcriptures, and partly alſo by tradition deliuered vnto vs of our moſt holy fathers doe embrace one faith and opinion.

When Eutyches was ſent for and come, he was founde in reaſoninge to maintaine the aforeſaideEutyches the hereticke and his opinion condemned. error. for I confeſſe (ſaith he) that our Lorde conſiſted of two natures before the diuinitie was coopled with the humanitie, but after the vnitinge of them I affirme that he had but one nature. he ſayd moreouer that the bodie of the Lord was not of the ſame ſubſtance with ours. Wherefore he was vnminiſtred, yet at his humble ſute vnto Theodoſus (he reported that Flauianus had forged records againſt him) the firſt councell of Constantinople was called together of the borderinge byſhopps to ſitte vpon that matter, where not onely the councell, but alſo diuers other byſhopps ſifted out the doinges of Flauianus. there the records beinge founde true were confirmed, and a ſeconde councell ſummoned to meete at Epheſus.

                        The Apologie of Euagrius touching the varietie of opinions among the Chriſtians, and of the ridiculous vanitie of the heathen godds.
                     
                     I Would haue none of al the ethniks which dote ouer their idolatricall ſeruice to deride vs chriſtians becauſe the latter byſhops haue abrogated the ſentence of their predeceſſors and ſeme alwayes to add ſome thing vnto the forme of our faith. for we of our part though we ſifte out with great care the long ſufferance of God which may neither in worde be expreſſed, neither in deede be found out: yet are we ſo affectionated though we leane either to this ſide or to y• ſide, yt we always honor it &amp; extol it aboue al other things. Neither was there any one of al the heretickes among the chriſtians that of ſet purpoſe at any time would vtter blaſphemy &amp; fal of his owne accord to reuile the maieſty of God, but rather perſwaded him ſelf in auoutching this or that opinion, that therein he was of a ſounder doctrine then the fathers that went before him. As touching the ground &amp; principles of Chriſtian religion whiche alwayes ought vnuiolably be retained we are all of one opinion. for the godhead which we adore is the trinitie &amp; the perſons whom we ſo highly praiſe are in vnity: the word of God alſo was begotten before y• fundations of the world were laid, &amp; we beleeue that in theſe latter dayes he tooke fleſh becauſe of the fauour and compaſſion he had on the worke of his owne hand. If in caſe that any nouelty be founde out as touchinge other matters they come to paſſe freely of mans owne accorde ſeeing it pleaſeth God ſo to diſpoſe of thē and to graunt them liberty to thinke as it pleaſeth them beſt to the ende the holy, Catholicke, and Apoſtolicke Churche may reforme what is found amiſſe, determine of both ſides, guyd vnto the true godlines, and direct her ſelfe according vnto the plaine character of ſound and ſincere doctrine. And therfore it was ſaid of the Apoſtle: It muſt nedes be that hereſies doe raigne among you, that they vvhich are perfect amonge you may be knovven. Herein verily we haue to wonder at the ſecret wiſedome of God1. Corin. II 2. Corin. 12 which ſayth thus vnto S. Paule: My ſtrength is made perfect in vveakeneſſe. For looke what the

things be which deuide the members of the Churche of God, euen out of the ſame, ſound doctrine is culled out, void of al reprehenſion, poliſhed more curiouſly, &amp; laid vp more ſafely: the Catholicke church encreaſeth therby more &amp; more euery day &amp; is extolled in manner vnto y• ſkies. But the ethniks fauourers &amp; foſterers of error which imploy no labour &amp; induſterie for y• ſifting out of y• trueth in God, neyther to vnderſtande of his care and prouidence ouer mankinde: theſe men I ſaye doe aboliſhe both their olde decrees and their newefounde conſtitutions, ſometimes by inuentinge newe Gods one after the other, ſome other times by conſecratinge for Gods their vayne immaginations, and the fonde affections of their mindes attributinge vnto them the names of Gods, and to be ſhort by fatheringe vpon the Gods the practiſinge of ſuche thinges to thende their intemperate deſires may eſcape vnpuniſhed.

The ſame God folded himſelfe in other infinitt blemiſhes verye odious to the ſeeminge of the vulgar ſort of people. for by takinge vpon him the forme of euerye vnreaſonable creature, he became both male and female, and though his wombe bare no burthen, yet they ſaye he cauſed by the acte of venerie that ſuche a thinge ſeemed to haue bene done by him contrarye to nature. Bacchus the ſonne of Iuppiter was an Hermaphrodite. They ſaye that Bacchus was his ſonne, and that he was alſo Androgynus both man and woman, a great ſclaunder to both ſexe, the ringleader of dronkenneſſe, quaffinge, ſurfettinge, vomitinge and all the miſchiefe that enſueth thereof. Iuppiter thruſt Saturnus his father out of heauen. They report of this Aegiochus and thunderinge Ioue an other haynous acte, that he murthered his father, whiche crime ought ſeuerely to be puniſhed of all the nations vnder heauen. Saturnꝰ the ſonne of Caellus (as the Poēts do fayne) fearinge leſt his father shoulde get more children to inherite, cutte of his fathers pryuie members and caſt them into the Sea, thereof roſe a froth and of the froth Venus was borne.

This Symeon being in the fleſhe imitated in lyfe the trade of the Angellicall powers, withdrewe him ſelfe from worldly affayres, forced nature whiche of her ſelfe leaneth downewardes and followed after loftie thinges: beinge placed as it were in the middeſt betweene heauen and earth, he ſought conference with God, he prayſed him together with the Angels, he lifted the prayers of men vp from the earth vnto heauen, and offered them to God, he brought the goodneſſe of God from heauen to earth, and made the worlde partaker thereof. his life is written by one whiche ſawe him with his eyes, alſo by Theodoritus byſhoppe of Cyres, who amonge other thinges omitted this one hiſtorie which I haue founde recorded amonge the inhabitaunts of the holye deſert, and learned of them for certayntie, when this Symeon who liued on earth as an Angell and in the fleſhe muche lyke a citizen of the heauenly Ieruſalem had begonne this trade of life both ſtraunge and ſuche as the worlde was not before acquainted withall, the religious men of the deſert ſent a meſſenger vnto him for to demaunde of him what he meant by that newefounde and vnknowen kinde of lyfe, and wherefore he forſooke the wonted trade, the ſteppes and traces of the ſainctes whiche went before and deuiſed to him ſelfe a forraine and vnknowen waye: they exhorte him moreouer by their meſſenger to come downe from his lodging and to followe the holy fathers which were his predeceſſors. They had moreouer commaunded their Legate that if he ſawe him yelde and come downe, heThe ſpirit of Symeon was tried by obedience. ſhoulde licence him to goe on ſtill in his owne way (they perſwaded them ſelues that his obedience woulde declare whether God had guyded him to leade ſuche a life, and to take vpon him in this worlde ſo weightie a combatt for to chaſtiſe his carcaſſe) but if he ſtubburnely reſiſted, if he were frowarde and wilfull, not yeldinge with all ſpeede vnto their counſell and aduiſe he ſhoulde pull him downe with a vengeance. When the meſſenger came to him, exhorted him as the fathers had willed, and ſawe that immediatly he beganne to riſe, yeldinge vnto their exhortation, he permitted him to proceede on and continewe as he beganne, ſayinge vnto him as followeth: be of good cheare and behaue thy ſelfe manfully, thy manſion no doubt is ordayned of God. Theſe thinges though other writers haue omitted them, yet haue I thought them worthie the penninge vnto the knowledge of the poſteritie. The grace of God beinge reſiant in the cloſſet of his breſte, was ſo feruent that he wrote freely vnto the Emperour Theodoſius, who had made a lawe that the Iewes inhabitinge Antioch ſhoulde enioye againe ſuche ſynagogs as the Chriſtians had taken from them, rebuking him ſharply (for he feared only God who was his emperour) that Theodoſius for to pleaſe the Chriſtians called in his proclamations, depoſed the magiſtrate which put in his head the reſtoringe of the ſynagogs, entreated this holy man and namely Erius the martyr to pray for him vnto God, &amp; to make him partaker of his bleſſing. This Symeon leading ſo auſtere a life, continued his mortal race ſix and fiftie years. for he liued nine years in the monaſterie where he was trained vp in the diuine precepts of vertuous life: in Mandria, (ſo was the place called) ſeuen and forty yeares: tenne of theſe he ſpent in a very narrowe rowme: ſeuen in ſtraicter pillours, and thirtie yeares in a pillour of forty cubits. After his deceaſſe his holy corps was brought to Antioch in the raigne of Leo the Emperour and Martyrius byſhop of Antioch, vnto that time Ardaburius captaine of the Eaſterne gariſon remained in Mandria, together with his power, keepinge the corps of holye Symeon leſte the borderinge cities ſhoulde by force carie it away. Wherefore the holye corps of Symeon is brought to Antioch after the workinge of manye miracles by the way: the whiche Leo the Emperour afterwardes requeſted of the people of Antioch, but the Antiochians of the other ſide made humble ſute vnto the Emperour in ſuche ſort as followeth: In ſo muche our citie is not inuironed vvith vvalles (the Emperours furiousIt is not a dead corps but the liuing God that is protector of town and cuntrei

                     NOwe I am about to write a certaine thing whiche I ſawe with mine owne eyes. I was wonderfull deſirous to ſee the Churche of holy Symeon, it ſtandes at the furtheſt from Theopolis that is Antioch, three hundred furlongs, ſet vpon the top of a hill. the cuntreymen call that place Mandria borowinge the name as I ſuppoſe of the ſeuere diſcipline and auſtere trade of life exerciſed by Symeon therein, the hill riſeth in height to a twentie furlongs. the buildinge of the Church is after the manner of a croſſe notably ſet forth with porches of foureſquare. The porches haue pillours annexed vnto them finely wrought of freeſtone which lift vp the roufe on high and that very artificially. The entire that is to the middes of the temple is wide open very cunningly wrought where the aforeſaide pillour of forty cubites ſtandes, in the which the earthly and corporeal angel ledde an heauenly life. The porches haue as it were lattiſes on high the which they cal windowes, fallinge both towardes the entrie and porches them ſelues. At the left hand of the pillour in one of the lattiſes, I my ſelf together with many cuntrey men aſſembled together, and compaſſing the pillour, ſawe a ſtarre of a wonderfull bigneſſe running and wandringe hither and thither throughout the chinkes and clefte lattiſes twinkelinge in the eyes of the beholders: neither that once, twiſe or thriſe, but oftener, and the ſame oftentimes fading and vaniſhinge away, afterwardes immediatly appearinge againe, the whiche is commonly ſcene on this ſainctes holiday.

                     THe bigger ſort of bones which the beaſts left vndeuoured vnto holy Ignatius, (after the bleſſed martyr as Iohn the Rhetorician with others doe recorde had according vnto his deſire enioyed the bowells of beaſtes in ſtede of his reſting graue at Rome in the theatre and ſtage ſtriuing of rauenous beaſts) were tranſlated into the Churchyard of Antioch in the raigne of Theodoſius which was a long time after his martyrdome. for it was almightie God no doubt that inſpired Theodoſius with that good motion, highly for to reuerence that godly martyr, and to conſecrate the temple whereof old deuells were honored, called y• temple of the goddeſſe of fortune vnto Ignatius the holy martyr. That which of olde was dedicated vnto fortune is nowe become a ſanctuarie and a famous temple to celebrate the memore of Ignatius, whoſe holy bones were caried in a chariott with great ſolemnitie and buried within the temple. for whiche cauſe there is an holy day kept with great ioye euen at this day, the which Gregorie the byſhop hath ſet forth with greater royaltie. Theſe thinges came there to paſſe in ſuch ſort as you heare, becauſe God would haue there the memoriall of his ſaincts celebrated with honor and reuerence. for the impious and wicked tyrante Iulian the Apostata being emperour and requiringe an aunſwere of the oracle of Apollo (who prophecied in Daphnis and ſpake by vertue of the fountaine Castalia) whiche had not the power to open his mouth (holy Babylas the martyr whoſe corps was hard by interred, had tyed his iawes together) Iulian I ſay againſt his will and as it were forced thereunto, tranſlated verie honorably the corps of Babylas and builded a goodly Churche which ſtands at this day without the the gates of Antioch: this he did to thende the dettells afterwarde might accompliſhe their wonted treacheries euen as reporte goeth they promiſed before vnto Iulian. but this came to paſſe through the prouidence of God partly that the force and vertue of martyrs may be ſene of all men, and partly alſo that the holy bones of this bleſſed martyr ſhould be buried in hallowed ground and beautified with ſo gorgeous a building.

Furthermore in the time of the aforeſaid Theodoſius raigne there was a marueilous great earthquake, the ſtraungeneſſe whereof exceeded all the wonderfull earthquakes that euer were before, which ſtretched it ſelfe in manner throughout the whole worlde: ſo that many turretts within the pallace were turned downe to the grounde: the longe wall of Cherroneſus came to ruine: the earth opened and ſwallowed vp in her gulphes many villages: many woefull miſchaunces befell vnto mankinde both by ſea and by lande, many welſpringes were dried vp, againe where fountaines were neuer ſeene before it flowed out: manie trees were plucked vp by the rootes: the valleis became high mountaines: the ſea threwe out fiſhes for dead: many Iſlands were drowned, the ſea ouerrunning the bankes and ouerflowing the cuntreys: many ſhipps ſulcating in the maine ſeas were ſeene on ground, the ſea falling backe not yelding his wonted ſtreames: many cuntreys throughont Bithynia, Hellespontus, and both Phrygia endured ſuch calamities that they were vtterly vndone.

An other thing yet I will rehearſe which for all it ſeemeth to paſſe all the reſt I had almoſt forgotten. Although there be not many in number of this ſort, yet ſome there are who being voyde through vertuous diſpoſition and free from all perturbations of the minde, come abrode into mens companies, mingle them ſelues with the thronging multitudes and faine they are madde and ſo they treade vayne glorie vnder foote, which the ſoule (according vnto the ſaying of wiſe Plato) vſeth to ſhake of as the laſt couer of ſhame and reproche. They take ſo litle delight in feeding of them ſelues and therein vſe ſuche Auſtere diſcipline that if neceſſitie conſtraine them to hoſt at a tippling houſe or in the ſtewes they neither reiect the place, neither couer their faces, neither thereat bluſhe at all. moreouer they bayne them ſelues very oft, and moſt commonly they are conuerſant with women and bath together and ſo they ſeeme voyde of all carnall affections as if they had brought nature captiue vnto them: in ſo much they can not be led neyther with the wanton lookes, neyther with the toying and daliance, neither with the amorous clipping and embracing of a woman to the naturall motion of venerie. but with men they are as men and with women

they liue like women, and for all they refuſe not the company of both ſex, yet know they onely the vſe of one. To be ſhort in this moſt holy and diuine kinde of life, vertue hath preſcribed lawes for nature, and made peculiar decrees for her ſelfe, to witt: that not one of them all haue their full of neceſſaries, for by their lawe they muſt hungre and thirſt, &amp; thereafter to attyre them ſelues as neceſſitie conſtraineth. their trade is ſo meaſured with ſuch ſinguler commendation, and their diet ſo moderate that if they fall into the contrary part and farre different from the other, they feele in them ſelues no chaunge at all. contrarieties are ſo tempered in them, the grace of God maketh ſuch a commixtion of repugnancie, and againe diſſolueth the ſame, that life and death, two thinges in nature and effect farre ſet one againſt the other, ſeeme to ioyne hands together, &amp; dwell in them: and looke wherein perturbations doe raigue in others, in them they are pluckt vp by the rootes and lye for dead: and where continual prayer is to be made, there they ſeeme of ripe yeares, ſtrong bodyes, and ſtrength inuincible. Theſe men liue both wayes, partly as it were by ſhaking of the fleſh they ſeeme to liue for euer, partly againe by companying with men, and applying medicines vnto their bodies, they call to God for mercie, &amp; runne ouer ſuch deuout ſeruice as may fitly agree with y• former life. yet want they no neceſſaries, neither are they boūd to one place, for almay heare alike, &amp; company alike, they vſe oftē, nay they kneele cōtinually, againe y• weariſome ſtanding they make, refreſheth age, &amp; the voluntary weakenes they brought them ſelues vnto. They are champions without fleſh on their backes, they are wraſtlers, yet haue they no blood in their faces, who though in ſteede of daynties and ſet dinners they vſe ſolemne faſting, yet had they leuer take nothing, if in ſo doing they could poſſibly liue, then cromme them ſelues with delicacies. And againe if it ſo fall out, that a ſtraunger come among them though it be very early in the morning, they entertaine him very curteouſly offring him both meat and drinke, ſo that they deuiſe an other kinde of faſting, that is to eate by compulſion, and in ſo doing men haue them in great admiration, who though they want many thinges to the ſuſtentation of nature, yet are they contented with litle, being enemies to their owne will, and to nature. they reſemble in their doings the will and pleaſure of their elders, in bridlinge the baytes of fleſhly luſt, the ſoule hath the maſtery, committeth ſuche thinges as are pleaſinge and acceptable vnto God with great diſcretion and diligence, but in the meane while, happie are they, and happier when they depart hence, for they bende thither all their might and haſten to enioy their wiſhed deſires.

                        Of Martianus the Emperour, and the ſignes which foreſhewed his raigne.
                     
                     
                        IN the firſt booke goinge before we haue diſcourſed the Actes done in the raigne of Theodoſius the Emperour of famous memorie: nowe it remaineth we take penne in hand and paint forth vnto the poſteritie, the vertues of the renowmed Martianus the noble and puyſant Emperour of Rome, his cuntrey, his linage, and howe he attayned vnto the Romane empire. In obſeruing this methode we ſhalbe able the ſooner to contriue euery his famous acts in their fit and conuenient place. Patriſcus Rhetor, with many others hath written at large of the life of Martianus. By birth he was of Thracia, the ſonne of a valiant captaine: who being wedded to his fathers trade of life, got him ſtraight to Philippopolis &amp; there was entertained in the number of ſuch as exerciſed them ſelues in the feats of armes▪ It fell out in his voyage as he tooke his iourneye thitherwardes that he ſawe on the way a deade corps whom death had newely bereaued of his life. he ſtood ſtill and was amazed thereat (for as he was vertuouſly enclined euery way, ſo was he prone to compaſſion) he continewed there ſo long vntill he had finiſhed all thinges what ſo euer belonged vnto the hearſe and funerall. but when ſuche as dwelled in compaſſe, had ſeene his doinges they made relation thereof vnto the magiſtrates of Philippopolis. They layd hands vpon Martianus, and charged him with y• inurther. but when ſignes and contectures preuayled more with the magiſtrates then the trueth or the proteſtation of Martianus, denyinge that euer he had murthered the man: and when Martianus was nowe readie to endure the penaltie of an homicide, vpon a ſuddaine vnlooked for (God no doubt of his goodnes prouidinge for him the beſt) the autor of that haynous acte was found, confeſſed the fact, was imediately executed and Martianus proued innocent. beinge thus wonderfully deliuered out of trouble he got him vnto a certen garriſon not farre of, &amp; requeſted they woulde entertaine him among them, and regiſter his name in their catalogue. They had the man in admiration, and prognoſticated of him by certen geſſes that he would proue a worthy man: recea
                           •
                        ed him with willing mindes, matriculated his▪ name in their booke: neyther placed they him in the loweſt rowme as a late commer after their law and cuſtome, but preferred him to an honorable office, the which one whoſe name was Augustus, enioyed before him, but then was lately deceaſſed, and entitled him Martianus Augustus, ſo that together with his preferment he receaued the Emperiall title (for the emperours are called Augusti) before be was proclaimed Emperour. Neither truely coulde the name reſt in him without the dignity, neither againe did the Emperiall title require any other name to expreſſe the worthineſſe thereof, ſo that the ſelfe ſame name was both proper and appellatiue, and beinge once ſounded it gaue forth the ſignification, both of the dignitie and the borowed name, An other thinge moreouer happened which foreſhewed vnto Martianus the emperiall ſcepter. When together with Aspar he warred againſt y• 
                        Vandalls, Aspar being ouercome of thē, Martianus with many others was takē &amp; brought wt other captiues into a plaine greene where Genzerichus would needs ſee thē aliue. being brought together Gēzerichus as he ſate in an vpper rowme tooke great delight in beholding the nūber of captiues. The captiues as long as it pleaſed euery one continued in the greene, for Gēzerichus had cōmaunded their keepers to knock of their ſhackles. wherefore as they all ſpēt the time diuerſly, Martianus laid him downe on the ground &amp; toke a nap on a ſunny bank, which burned more vehemētly then y• ſeaſō &amp; time of y• yere did require. As he ſlept an Egle flew ouer him, ſet her ſelfe betwene him &amp; y• ſunne, ſpred abrode her wings, ſhadowed him as it had bene a cloud, &amp; in ſo doing eaſed him greatly, ſo y• 
                        Genzerichus wondering at y• circumſtance coniectured a right of the things that were to befal him, he called Martianus vnto him, reſtored him his liberty &amp; bound him with an othe, if euer he came to be emperour yt he would ioyne in league with the 
                           Ʋandalls, and neuer take armour againſt them, the whiche (as Procopius writeth) Martianus
                        
performed in deede▪ but omitting ſuch things as may ſeeme impertinēt, let vs returne vnto the hiſtorie. This Martianus as he excelled in pietie towardes God, ſo he paſſed in iuſtice towardes his ſubiects. he deemed that to be richeſſe, not which conſiſted of treaſure and raiſing of tribute: but onely that whiche ſupplyed the want of the needy, and yeelded a ſafe and a ſecure life vnto ſuche as enioyed great poſſeſſions. he was a terror vnto his people, not in puniſhing offēdors, but in threatening, leaſt at any time they ſhould offend: and therefore the empire was vnto him no inheritance but the hire of vertue, the which he obtained with the generall conſent of all, both Senatours, ſubiectes, and all ſorts of people, when as Pulcheria the Empreſſe perſwaded them to doe no leſſe, whom he entertained in his pallace as an Empreſſe, yet knewe her not as man knoweth his wife, for ſhe continewed a virgine vnto her laſt houre. Theſe things were done before that Valentinianus the Romaine Emperour ratified the election of Martianus, who afterwardes vnderſtanding of his vertuous diſpoſition condeſcended thereunto. Martianus laboured with al might poſſible that all men ioyntly ſhould laude God, and the lipps whoſe languages impietie had confounded, ſhoulde deuoutly nowe at length cloſe together, and ſounde out with harmonie and concent, the prayſe of the liuing God.

                        Of the councell of Chalcedon and the occaſion why it was ſummoned.
                     
                     WHen Martianus was of the diſpoſition mentioned before, there came vnto him Legats frō 
                        Leo byſhop of old Rome, ſignifyinge y• 
                        Dioſcorus had made light of the decree which Leo had laid down in the councel of Epheſus agreeable with the true &amp; rightfayth: there came others alſo reporting what iniuries &amp; contumelies Dioſcorus had done vnto thē, requeſting y• a councell might be called together for the hearing of their cauſes. The which ſute as chiefe of all others, Euſebuis byſhop of Dorilaeum made vnto the emperour &amp; followed hard, opening vnto him how that both he and Flauianus were depoſed of their byſhoprickes through the fraude and wyles of Chryſaphius one ſometime of Theodoſius garde: y• 
                        Flauianus (at what time Chryſaphius ſent vnto him requiring golde for his admiſſion into the byſhopricke) ſent vnto him the holy veſſell of the Church for to make him throughly aſhamed of his demaunde: and that Chriſaphius wallowed alike in the hereticall puddle and blaſphemous impietie of Eutyches. he certified him moreouer that Flauianus was piteouſly put to death by the procurement of Dioſcorus, thruſt by him violently out of the Church, and diſdainfully pounced with his feete. The councel of Chalcedon was ſummoned for the hearinge of the aforeſaide accuſations. Legats and poſts were ſent into euery prouince, the holy clergie were called together by letters, containing graue and godly matter, firſt of all to meet at Nice, ſo that Leo byſhop of Rome wrote vnto them by Paſcaſianus, Lucentius and others whome he ſent thither to ſupply his rowme in ſuch ſort as followeth: Vnto the byshopps aſſembled at Nice, Leo
                         ſendeth greeting: afterwardes at Chalcedon a citie in Bithynia, where Nestorius was cited to appeare, as Zacharie Rhetor doth fauourably report of him. But it is plaine it could not be ſo, for Nestorius was commaunded vnder paine of an accurſe not to ſhewe his face in the councell. The which thing alſo Eustathius byſhop of Berytum writeth plainely in the letters which he ſent to Iohn the byſhop &amp; to another Iohn the prieſt, of the canons laid downe by that councel. his words are theſe. There came to this councell ſuch as diligently ſearched out for the reliques of Nestorius
                        
                        Euſtathius epiſt. ad Ioh. 
                        and with open mouthes they exclaimed vpon the councell: what reaſon and conſcience is there that holy men shoulde be accurſed? So that the Emperour was greatly incenſed againſt them and commaunded his gard they should ſend them packing with a vengeance. Wherefore I can not ſee how Nestorius after his deceaſſe ſhould be called to the councell.

Furthermore this temple ſtands right ouer againſt Conſtantinople ſo that the beholdinge of ſo worthie and ſo noble a citie bringes vnto it great maieſtie, this temple is of three fortes of goodly and large buylding: the firſt lieng wide open with a long porch receauing the tempered a

                        r of the ſkie ſett vp with goodly pillours on euery ſide. The ſecond in length and breadth like vnto y• former adornedlikewiſe with litle pillours differing only in height, &amp; y• lifted ridge. Of the North ſide of which ſecond building there is a rownd Ile &amp; the great windowe vnto the Eaſt, the pillours within are cunningly wrought bowewiſe, of the ſame ſtuff and one biggenes after the forme of a circle. Underneath theſe there is a loft ouercaſt with the like rouffe where it is lawefull for euery one to pray vnto the Martyr &amp; to be preſent at the holy myſteries. Within the Ile Eaſtwards there is a veſtry artificiallie builded where the reliques of the holie martyr are cheſted in a longe coffer cunninglie made of ſiluer, the which ſome men for the length thereof doe call Longe as if the proper name were ſo. The miracles wrought at certen times by this bleſſed Martyr are knowen I am ſure of euerye Chriſtian. For oftentimes either ſhe appeareth vnto the Biſhops in their ſleepe which orderlye ſucceede in the gouernemente of that Church, or ſheweth her ſelfe vnto ſome other that are of great fame for their vertuous life and godlines charging them to celebratea feaſt in that Church of daynty &amp; delicate foode. The which thing being ſignified vnto the Emperours, vnto the chiefe Prieſte and wholl citie, all ranne thither both Prince, Prieſt, and people to become partakers of the myſteries. After all this in the ſight of the wholl aſſembly, the Biſhop of Conſtātinople accompanied with his clergie gott him into the veſtry where the corps of this holy Martyr (aboue named) was interred. There is on the left hande of this coffin and cheſted corpsWhat iniury was this vnto the deade corps? It is better for the faithfull Chriſtian to become partaker of the blood of Chriſt which redeemed him from death and damnation. as it were a litle wickett very ſtrongly made of litle latiſes through the which they vſe to let down a longe iron with a ſponge tyed about the end, they dipp and ſoke it round about in the dead corps after wardes pull vp the ſponge all embrued with cogeled drops of blood. The people ſeeing this, worſhip God immediatly and magnifie his holy name. There are ſo many drops of cōgeled blood drawen vp that they ſuffice the religious Emperours, the wholl aſſembly of prieſts gathered ther together, &amp; all the flocking multitude not onely to participate thereof them ſelues, but alſo to ſend vnto the other faithfull throughout the world, that full fayne would be partakers with them. But the congeled drops continew ſtill the ſame, neither doth the holy blood chaunge the hewe or colour thereof at all. All which things are not to be ſeene at any certaine, ſpeciall, or appointed time but thereafter as the Biſhop of that place is in life and as it agreeth with his vertues. For they report when any ſingular man of godly diſpoſition is choſen Biſhop of that Church, that then moſt commonly this miracle is to be ſeene: but when a leude perſon is crept to enioy the rowme that theſe things very ſeldome come to paſſe. An other thing yet I will rehearſe which is ſtayed and hindred neither by time neither by occaſion, neither maketh any difference betwene faithfull and infidell but ſheweth it ſelfe alike vnto all men. When any cometh into the veſtry where the coprs of this holy martyr is cheſted he is ſo rauiſhed with ſuch fragrant odours that all other perfumes in compariſon of that ſeeme worth nothinge. For it is like neither the ſweete ſmelling flowres culled in the greene medowes, neither any other redolēt ſauor whatſoeuer neither ſuch as is made of pleaſant oyles: but it is a ſtraunge and paſſing all the reſt breathing out of the Martyrs dead body.

                        Of the things handeled &amp; decided by the councell of Chalcedon, howe after they had depoſed Dioſcorus b. of Alexandria they reſtored Theodoritus and Ibas to theyr Biſhopricks.
                     
                     IN the aforeſayde place deſcribed of vs at large the Councell of Byſhoppes mette together where Paſcaſianus and Lucentius Byſhopps, and Boniface a Prieſt, legats (as I ſayd before) of Leo Byſhoppe of olde Rome: Anatolius Byſhopp of Conſtantinople, Dioſcorus
                        
byſhopp of Alexandria, Maximus byſhopp of Antioch, and Iuuenalis byſhopp of Ieruſalem, with the prieſtes of their ſeuerall prouinces were preſent. There ſate with them the chiefe ſenators vnto whome the ſubſtitutes of Leo ſayde that Dioſcorus ought not to ſitt with them in the councell, that Leo their byſhopp had charged them no leſſe, and if they woulde not yeelde vnto it, that they woulde leaue the Churche and bidd them farewell. When the Senators demaunded what crimes Dioſcorus was to be charged withall, their aunſwere was, that he who contrarye to all right and honeſtie playde the part of a Iudge, was to▪ abide the ſentence of iudgement him ſelſe for the cenſure he had pronounced of others. Theſe thinges beinge ſpoken, and Dioſcorus alſo beinge appointed to ſtande in the middeſt, Euſebius byſhopp of Dorylaeum requeſted that the ſupplication he had ſent vnto the Emperour might be openly reade in their hearing, and withall he added theſe wordes. I proteſt vnto you that Dioſcorus hath iniuried me not a litle, he hath alſo brought our religion into great infamye, he procured the death of Flautanus the byshopp, and wrongfully depoſed him together with me. cauſe I beſeeche you my ſupplication to be reade. When he had made an ende of ſpeakinge his ſupplication was reade, contayninge ſuche a forme as followeth.

But nowe let vs proceede on in the things which we haue chiefely purpoſed to handle, that is to ſaye, howe Dioſcorus bewrayed him ſelfe, partly by reiecting the Epiſtle of Leo byſhopp of old Rome, and partly alſo by depoſing Flauianus byſhop of newe Rome, all which he did in one day, and craftely deuiſed that the byſhops whiche aſſembled together ſhould ſubſcribe vnto a blancke, where afterwards he cauſed the depriuation of Flauianus to be written. when theſe thinges were done, the ſenators decreed as followeth.

VVherefore ſeeinge that Flauianus the byshopp of worthie memory and Euſebius the moſt reuerende byshopp of Dorilaeum were founde not to haue erred in the fayth after we had ſearched the actes and decrees of the councell, and alſo by the report of ſuche as were chiefe in the councell, and therefore vniuſtly to haue beene depoſed (for they confeſſed them ſelues ſowly deceaued and wrongfully to haue depriued Flauianus and Euſebius) It ſeemeth good vnto vs, and no doubt God approueth the ſame, that Dioſcorus the moſt reuerend byshop of Alexandria (if it ſo pleaſe our Lorde the Emperour) Iuuenalis the moſt reuerend byshop of Ieruſalem, Thalaſſius the moſt reuerend byshop of Caeſarea in Cappodocia, Euſebius the moſt reuerende byshop of Armenia, Euſtathius the moſt reuerend byshop of Berytus, &amp; Baſilius the moſt reuerende byshop of Seleucia in Iſauria (who were then of autority and chief of the councell) should be punished alike, depoſed of their byshopricks, by the cenſure &amp; iudgemēt of the councell, as the canons of the church doe require, &amp; be at the emperours pleaſure. Immediatly there were other bils exhibited againſt Dioſcorus both of the crimes he committed, and the money he had receaued: but when Dioſcorus being called y• ſecond &amp; the third time of y• councel, ſent fained excuſes for him ſelf &amp; came not, y• Legats

And that we may omit many other things, this man of his owne autority cōtrary to the canon of the church receaued Eutyches into the cōmunion, an heretick of the ſame opinion with him, &amp; one that was iuſtly depoſed by his owne proper byshop, to wit, the moſt holy father, and our byshop Flauianus: &amp; this he did before he shewed his face in the councel which he held with the moſt holy byshops at Epheſus. but the Apoſtolicke ſeae pardoned the byshops becauſe they were conſtrained againſt their wills to doe that whiche they did: who yeelded them ſelues vnto this preſent houre both to Leo the moſt holy byshop, &amp; to the whole ſacred &amp; general aſſembly of byshops, &amp; therefore as men of one opinion with him, he receaued thē into the cōmunion.

Although he was priuey to ſuch lewde practiſes, yet haue we aſſēbled together, to thend we might deale ſomewhat fauourably both vvith him for all his former leudnes, and alſo in like ſort with the other godly byshops which were not of equall autority with him in iudgment. but ſeing that his later miſdemenure exceeded his former impiety, for he ſticked not to excōmunicate Leo the moſt holy and moſt religious archebyshop of Rome, moreouer whē shameful bills were exhibited againſt him, &amp; he him ſelf being cited once, twiſe, &amp; the thirde time as the canon of the church hath cōmaunded by the godly byshops to appeare before the councel, yet would be not come, for his owne cōſcience accuſed him, but entertained cōtrary vnto law ſuch as were iuſtly depoſed by diuers councells &amp; ſet at naught ſundry cōſtitutions of the church condemning as it were him ſelfe with his owne doings: once againe ſeeinge theſe are found to be his later practiſes, Leo the moſt holy archebyshop of great &amp; olde Rome, by vs and this ſacred aſſembly together with the moſt bleſſed Apoſtle S. Peter, who is the rocke, the grounde of the Catholicke Churche, and the fundation of the true fayth bereaued him of all dignitie that belongeth to a byshop, and depriued him of the prieſtly function▪ wherefore let

this holy councell geue the ſentence of Dioſcorus (of whom we haue hitherto ſpoken) according vnto the canons of the Church. When theſe things were ratified by the councell, and certen other things decided, y• byſhops that were depoſed with Dioſcorus at y• requeſt of the councell, &amp; the conſent of y• emperour were reſtored to their byſhopricks: againe when they had annexed certē things vnto their former conſtitutious y• conncell pronounced ſuch a ſentence as followeth.

(Imediately after when they had read y• creed eſtabliſhed by the councell of Nice, with y• forme of faith agreed vpon by a hundred &amp; fiftye godly fathers aſſembled at Conſtantinople, they procede on in theſe words) that diuine &amp; holy creed containing the abundance of the grace &amp; ſpirit of god is ſufficient both to bring men vnto a perfect knowledg of the faith, &amp; alſo vnto a ſure cōfirmation of the ſame▪ for it inſtructeth vs moſt exquiſitly in ſuch things as we muſt neceſſarily know of the father, of the ſonne, &amp; of the holy ghoſt, and ſetteth forth after the plaineſt maner the incarnation of our Lord Ieſus for them that with faith wil embrace it. but ſeeing that certen leud &amp; godles perſons endeuoring with their erronious opinions, to root out true religiō haue brought into the world many vaine fantaſies of their idle braines, of which number ſome were not affraid to corrupt the true vnderſtanding &amp; the miſtery of the manhood, our Lord Ieſus toke for our ſakes &amp; to deny the mother or bearing of God which is attributed vnto the virgineAgainſt Neſtorius.

Againe this councell annexeth thereunto not without good conſideration the Epiſtle of Leo the moſt holy archebyshop of old Rome, which he wrote vnto Flauianus the moſt holy archebyshopp for the remouinge and rooting out of the Churche of God the fanaticall opinion of Eutyches, as aThe epiſtle of Leo vnto Flauianus allowed. worthie tract agreeing with the conſeſſion of Peter that great Apoſtle, and as it were a ſtronge pillour and fortreſſe to vpholde the true and ſincere doctrine againſt all erronious opinions. for he valiantly encountreth with ſuch as endeuored to deuide the myſtery of the incarnation into two ſonnes: he excommunicateth ſuche as dare preſume to ſaye that the diuinitie of the onely begotten is patible: he manfully withſtandeth ſuche as confounde or make a commixtion of both the natures in Chriſte: he ratleth ſickebraines and frentike fooles, who affirme that the shape of a ſeruant which he tooke of vs, was of a celeſtiall or ſome other kinde of ſubſtance: laſt of all he accurſeth ſuche as vaynely haue fayned that before the couplinge of the naturesThe creede of the councel helde at Chalcedon. there vvere tvvo, but after the vnitynge of them that there vvas but one onely nature in the Lorde.

Moreouer this councell commaundeth ſuche as preſume to deuiſe any other fayth, or to bringe forth, or to teache, or to publishe any other creede vnto ſuche as turne eyther from paganiſme, or from Iudaiſme, or from any other ſecte whatſoeuer, vnto the knowledge of the trueth, if they be byshops, that they be depoſed of their byshoplike dignities: if prieſts, that they be vnminiſtred: if monks and lay people, that they shoulde be accurſed. After the reading of theſe decrees, Martianus the Emperour, who was preſent at the councell of Chalcedon, who made there alſo an Oration, returned to Constantinople.

                           SEinge the diuine and celeſtiall grace of God (moſt holy emperour) hath ordained your highneſſe as a levvell and treaſure for mortall men: you ceaſſe not (we ſpeake vnfainedly) imediately and next after God continually to prouide for the ſafety and profit of the common vveale. In a while after they ſay. when the peace which raigned among the godly people, both here with vs and with in the citie of Alexandria, was remoued, out of the Churche of God, Timotheus then beinge a prieſt, gott him imediately after the councell of Chalcedon vvas diſſolued onely with foure or fiue byshopps, together with a fevve monks, fell from the fayth, and deuided him ſelfe from the Catholicke Churche. Theſe his companions were infected with the pernicious doctrine of Apollinarius, &amp; the peſtilent error of Timothee him ſelfe: al they were then depoſed of their prieſtly dignities according vnto the canon of the Churche both by Proterius of worthie memorie, and the councell of byshops helde in Aegypt, and alſo exiled by the Emperours, whoſe diſpleaſure they had procured. Againe after a fewelines. The ſame Timothee, at what time Martianus the Emperour of famous memorie chaunged this fraile life for blisfull reſt in the celeſtiall paradiſe, ſticked not moſt impudently to reuile him with raylinge and opprobrious languages, as if he had bene ſubiect to no lawe: he ſtaggered not like a shameleſſe caytiffe at accurſing the ſacred and generall aſſembly of byshopps which mett at Chalcedon: he ledde after him a multitude of chaungelings and ſeditious people: he ſet vp him ſelfe againſt the holy canons, the decrees of the Churche, the common weale and lawes: he intruded him ſelfe into the holy Churche of God, which had both a paſtor and a teacher, to witt, our moſt holy father and archbyshopp Proterius, as he celebrated the wonted myſteries, and offered vp the ſacrifice of prayer vnto Chriſt Ieſus the ſauiour of vs all for your holy Empire, and for your chriſtian and religious pallace. Againe they ſay. The next day after, as Proterius the moſt holy father executed (as the manner is) the function of a byshop, Timotheus tooke vnto him two byshopps depoſed of their dignities with ſome banished prieſts, as we ſaide before, and was conſecrated byshopp by two of them, when as none of all the Catholicke byshops throughout the prouince of▪ 
                              Aegypt (as the vſe is in conſecrating the byshopp of Alexandria) was preſent: and ſo tooke poſſeſſion as he perſwaded him ſelfe of the archebyshopps chaire, but verily it was nothing els ſaue plaine whoredome againſt the ſpouſe of Chriſt, and the Churche of God whiche had an huſband of her owne, that celebrated therein the holy myſteries, and gouerned the ſame according vnto the canons of the Churche. When they had enterlaced a fewe lines, they went on as followeth. Bleſſed Proterius could doe no other then (as it is written) geeue place vnto wrath: &amp;Rom. 12. to thende he might eſcape the furie of ſuch as ranne headlong to diſpatche him out of the way, he made his refuge vnto the reuerend fonte: the whiche place of all others, yea the Barbarians and bruitish people being altogether ignorant of the vertue and grace which ishueth thence are loth to prophane. yet theſe men purpoſing to performe in deede that which from the beginning they had deuiſed for Timothee, ſaued not the life of Proterius, no not in thoſe priueledged places of the temple: reuerenced not the religious place: honored not the time (for it was on the high feaſte of Easter) ſtoode in no awe of holy priſthood, which is a mediation betweene God and man: ſlew him being innocent and diſpatched with him ſix others for company, They brought with them the wounded carcaſſe, they lugged it throughout the citie, they ſet it out piteouſly to be ſkorned at, they cruelly rent with the lash of the whipp the ſenſeleſſe corps, they vnioynted the members throughout the body, neither refrayned they after the manner of bruite beaſtes to taſt of his bowells whome they lately tooke for a mediator betweene God and man. laſt of all that which remained they burned to ashes ſcattering and hurlinge into the aer the ashes thereof exceeding therein the ſauadgneſſe and crueltie of bruite beaſtes▪ the autor and ringleader of all theſe miſchiefes was Timotheus.

                     THere fell moreouer at Conſtātinople a calamity not much vnlike the former nay farr more grieuous, it beganne in that part of the city which lay to the ſea &amp; is called the Oxe Cauſei The reporte goeth that a deſpitefull and wicked deuell in the forme of a woman or a poore woman through the inſtigation of the deuell (both is reported) went about candel light with a candell in her hand vnto the market for to buy ſome ſaltfiſh, left her candell vpon the ſtall and went away. When the candell had waſted to the ende of the wike, it roſe into a great flame and ſtroke immediatly in the buylding ouer heade which burned at the firſt, it tooke hold alſo of the houles that were next not onely ſuch as eaſily might be ſet on fire, but alſo the ſtony buylding and burned them to aſhes. They ſay this fire laſted the ſpace of foure dayes, no man was able to quenche it, it flaſhed throughout the middes of the citie, conſumed from the north part to the ſouth end all houſes, fiue furlungs in length and fourteene in bredth, left no buylding either publique or priuate, no pillours, no ſtony arches or vaultes in all that tyme and in all that compaſſe vnburned to the fundation, but to haue perced the flinte ſtone and harde mettall as if it had bene ſtuble or ſtrawe. Of the north part of the citie where the hauen lieth this lamentable deſtruction reached frō the Oxe-Cauſei (ſo is the place called) vnto the old temple of Apollo: in the ſouth ſide frō the hauen of Iulian vnto the temple of Concorde: in the middeſt of the citie frō 
                        Conſtantines market vnto the market of Taurus, a pitiefull ſhewe and dredfull to behold. The goodly places &amp; gorgeous high buyldings that had bene within the citie, the coſtly carued tymber yelding heretofore great maieſty vnto the eye of man, both publique and priuate were then become like craggy hills and rocks that no man could paſſe through, confuſed heapes of filth and all kind of ſtuff full of deformity, that the owners of them them felues could not diſcerne the bounds of theyr poſſeſſiō neither ſay this or that place ſtoode thus before the fire conſumed them.

                        PAſcaſianus and Lucentius the byſhopps, and Boniface the prieſt ſupplyed in this councell the abſence of Leo byſhopp of olde Rome: Anatolius alſ byſhopp of Constantinople, Dioſcorus byſhopp of Alexandria, Maximus byſhopp of Antioch, Iuuenalis byſhopp of Ieruſalem with their ſeuerall clergie, were preſent at the councell. There ſate with them the chief ſenators

vnto whome the ſubſtitutes of Leo ſayde that Dioſcorus ought not to ſitt in the councell with them, that Leo their byſhop had charged them no leſſe, and if they woulde not yeelde vnto it, that they woulde leaue the Churche and bidd them farewell. When the Senators demaunded what crimes Dioſcorus was to be charged withall, their aunſwere was, that he who contrarye to all right and honeſtie playde the part of a Iudge, was to abide the ſentence of iudgement him ſelfe for the cenſure he had pronounced of others. Theſe thinges beinge ſpoken, and Dioſcorus alſo beinge appointed to ſtande in the middeſt, Euſebius byſhop of Dorilaeum requeſted that the ſupplication he had ſent vnto the Emperour might be openly reade in their hearing, and withall he added theſe wordes. I proteſt vnto you that Dioſcorus hath iniuried me not a litle, he hath alſo brought our religion into great infamye, he procured the death of Flauianus the byshop, and wrongfully depoſed him together with me. cauſe, I beſeeche you, my ſupplication to be reade. When he had made an ende of ſpeakinge his ſupplication was reade, contayninge ſuche a forme as followeth.

The occaſion of our cōplaint is as followeth. In the councel lately held at the famous city of Epheſus (I would to God it had neuer bene called together, then had it not brought into the whole world ſuch horrible miſchiefe and hurliburly) the aforeſaid Dioſcorus who trode right &amp; reaſō vnder foot, who ſet the fear of God farre out of his ſight, who maintained one abſurd opinion with Eutyches that vaine &amp; hereticall varlett, who of a longe whyle reuealed not vnto many the venome of his cankred ſtomacke, yet bewrayed him ſelfe in proceſſe of time partly by occaſion of the crimes we laide to Eutyches his charge, &amp; partly alſo by occaſion of the ſentence which Flauianus the byshop of worthy memorie pronounced againſt him: gathered together a great multitude of ſeditious perſons, raiſed with his money no ſmall power, laboured as muche as laye in him to ouerthrowe the catholicke religion and godly fayth of the auncient fathers, and to eſtablishe the blaſphemous opinion of Eutyches the monk whoſe opinion was euer condēned of the holy fathers from the Apoſtles time vnto this day. wherfore ſeing the haynous offences he committed both impudently to the derogation of the Chriſtian faith &amp; vncharitably againſt vs, be of no ſmal importāce, we are moſt humbly to craue vpon our bare knees of your graces, and to requeſt that by vertue of your autority the moſt reuerēd byshop Dioſcorus may be inioyned to aunſwere vnto ſuche crimes as we haue laid to his charge, to wit, vnto ſuch practiſes of his, &amp; records as he broughtforth againſt vs in the holy councell, wherby we shalbe able plainly to proue that he is eſtraunged from the catholicke faith: that he maintaineth an opinion which is nothing elſe but blaſphemy it ſelfe: that he both depoſed vs vniuſtly &amp; iniuried vs diuerſly beſides. we beſeeche you moreouer to vouchſafe the ſending of your gracious letters vnto the holy &amp; general councel of the moſt godly byshops, to thend both our doings &amp; his may indifferently be heard, &amp; that your highnes may be certified againe of al that is handled by the councel, hoping that therein we shall pleaſe our immortal head Chriſt Ieſus. If we may obtaine (moſt holy emperours) this our humble ſute at your maieſties hāds, we will not ceaſſe day &amp; night to pray for the proſperous ſtate of your empire, and the continuaunce of your raigne.
                                 
                              
                           
                        
                     
                      The canons concluded vpon by the byſhops in the ſecond councell of Epheſus were openly read at the requeſt as wel of Dioſcorus as of Euſebius, where it appeared that the epiſtle of Leo was not read at all, yea though ſome had ſpoken of it againe, &amp; againe. Dioſcorus being demaunded why it was not read, aunſwered for him ſelfe, that he had moued the byſhops and that oftentimes to doe it: Iuuenalis byſhop of Ieruſalem, and Thalaſſius byſhop of Caeſarea in Cappadocia, who together with Dioſcorus challenged vnto them ſelues autority in

the councell of Chalcedon, required that all ſhould be read &amp; reuealed. Iuuenalis auoutched and ſaid plainely that the emperour admoniſhed Dioſcorus by his letters to read the epiſtle of Leo, yet afterwards that there was not a word ſpoken of it. Thalaſſius pleaded in like ſort for him ſelfe, yt he hindred not the reading of it, &amp; that he had not ſo much autority of him ſelf as to cōmaund the reading of it. wherfore the acts of the councell being read, ſome of the byſhops eſpied therein certaine fayned and counterfeit handes, and among the reſt Stephan byſhop of Epheſus was demaunded of the councell who they were that ſubſcribed with exceptions, he made aunſwere that Iulian (who afterwards was made byſhop of Lebidum) and Criſpinus had done ſo: for all that ſuch as ſubſcribed at the requeſt of Dioſcorus, not to haue ſuffred it ſo to ſtande, but to haue wrung the fingers of ſuch as wrote &amp; directed their pens to their great ſhame &amp; infamy. In the end Stephan cōfeſſed that the depriuation of Flauianus was ratified with ſubſcriptions the ſame day. for Acacius byſhop of Ariarathia compelled all the byſhops by force, &amp; made them of neceſſity to ſubſcribe vnto a blanke, moleſting thē infinitly with ſoldiers, who ſtood by with naked ſwords redy to diſpatch them if they yelded not. Againe they reade an other accuſation whereunto Theodorus byſhop of Claud
                              ••
                           opolis made aunſwere y• there was no ſuch thing ſpokē. As they proceded on ſtil in reading the acts of the councel where any thing was motioned which concerned Eutyches &amp; ſuch as affirmed y• the fleſh of God our lord &amp; ſauiour Ieſus chriſt came downe from heauen, they brought forth the records of the councell, where Euſebius had aunſwered, y• 
                        Eutyches had ſaid in deed from heauen, but not to haue added whence he toke it: y• 
                        Diogenes byſhop of Cyzicum vrged him at y• time, in this ſort, tel vs thē whēce toke he flesh? and y• they were not ſuffred to reaſō further therof. After al this they brought forth the records, then Baſilius byſhop of Seleucia in Iſauria ſaid: I adore our one lord Ieſus Chriſt the ſonne of God, yt only God y• word, who after his incarnation &amp; the vniting together of y• diuinity &amp; humanity is thought to conſiſt in two natures. y• byſhops of Aegypt cried out againſt this in ſuch ſort as followeth: Let no man deuide him into parts that can not be parted. we muſt ſay there is one ſonne, not two ſonnes. they y• byſhops of y• eaſt cried: curſed be he that parteth chriſt, curſed be he that deuideth him. the ſame records did teſtifie y• 
                        Eutyches being aſked whether he thought y•
                        The hereſie of Eutyches. chriſt had two natures, made aunſwere y• according vnto his knowledge before y• cōiunction of his diuinity &amp; humanity together, chriſt conſiſted of two natures, but after y• vniting of thē to haue had in him but one nature. And y• 
                        Baſil ſaid then: if he confeſſe not y• there were two natures after y• coniunction of yt natures which can neither be ſeparated, neither confounded, then bringeth he in both a confuſion &amp; a cōmixtion: but if he ſay that the diuinity being incarnate put on humanity, &amp; ſo vnderſtand y• incarnation in ſuch ſort as Cyrill doth: then ſaith he no other then we doe. for the diuinity which was with the father is one thing, &amp; the humanity which he tooke of his mother is an other thing. when y• councell demaunded of them why they had ſubſcribed to depoſe Flauianus, y• records doe declare y• the byſhops of the Eaſt cried out: we haue all done amiſſe, &amp; therefore we all craue pardon. Againe going forwardes in peruſing of y• records, it appeared y• byſhops were aſked why they admitted not Euſebius into their company &amp; conference, when he requeſted it of them, whereunto Dioſcorus aunſwered that Elpidius brought letters to warne them, &amp; that he proued vnto them how Theodoſius the emperour charged them they ſhould not permit him to come into the councell, the acts doe witneſſe yt 
                        Iuuenalis made the ſame aunſwere. Thalaſſius ſaid y• ſuch things as the emperours had cōdemned, were of no force &amp; autority after the condemnation, yet y• he ſaid not ſo as in defence of the faith. whereupon the records doe declare yt 
                        Dioſcorus reprehended their doings with theſe &amp; ſuch other like words: I pray you what maner of canons are now obſerued? when Theodoritus came in amonge them, it is reported the Senate ſhoulde ſay that he came in for an accuſer: and that Dioſcorus aunſwered, he was to take the rowme of a byſhop. The Senate then replyed that both Euſebius and Theodoritus were to ſtande in the rowme of accuſers, no otherwiſe then Dioſcorus was to ſtande at the barre and to be arrayned. All the actes of the ſeconde councell helde at Epheſus were reade and the ſentence whiche they had pronounced againſt Flauianus and Euſebius. vntill they came to a certayne clauſe, at the hearinge whereof, Hilarius the byſhop beganne to ſpeake. The byſhops of the Eaſt and ſuche as were of their ſide, cryed: Let Dioſcorus be accurſed.
                        The byſhops of the Eaſt cryed thus againſt Dioſcorus. 
                        In the verye ſame houre Chriſte depriued Dioſcorus, when Dioſcorus depoſed Flauianus. O holye Lorde we beſeeche the chaſtiſe thou him, and thou O Catholicke Emperour, be reuenged on him, God graunt Leo may liue manye yeares, God ſende the Patriarche a longe lyfe. Laſte of all when the actes were reade, whiche declared that all the byſhops aſſembled at Epheſus had ſubſcribed vnto the depriuation of Flauianus and Euſebius, the moſt ſage and worthie

Senators ſayde as followeth. The nexte daye after when the councell aduiſed them ſelues
                        The ſenators gaue their ſentence in theſe words. where it appeareth that laye men were of great autoritie in the councels. 
                        ſomewhat better, we doe perceaue that they reaſoned more exquiſitly of the true and Catholicke fayth. VVherefore ſeeinge that Flauianus the byshop of worthye memorye, and Euſebius the moſt reuerende byshop of Dorilaeum, were founde not to haue erred in the fayth after we had ſearched the actes and decrees of the councell, and alſo by the report of ſuche as were chiefe in the councell, and therefore vniuſtly to haue beene depoſed (for they confeſſed them ſelues fowlye deceaued, and wrongfully to haue depriued Flauianus and Euſebius
                        ) It ſeemeth good vnto vs, and no doubt God approueth the ſame, that Dioſcorus the moſt reuerend byshop of Alexandria (if it ſo pleaſe our Lorde the Emperour) Iuuenalis the moſt reuerend byshop of Ieruſalem, Thalaſſius the moſt reuerend byshop of Caeſarea in Cappadocia, Euſebius the moſt reuerend byshop of Armenia, Eustathius the moſt reuerend byshop of Berytus, &amp; Baſilius the moſt reuerende byshop of Seleucia in Iſauria (who were then of autoritye and chiefe of the councell) shoulde be punished alyke, depoſed of their byshoprickes, by the cenſure and iudgement of the councell as the canons of the Church doe require &amp; be at the Emperours pleaſure.
                         When their ſentence was reade the byſhops of the Eaſt cryed: That iudgement is iuſt. Then the byſhopes of Illyrium ſayde wyth lowde voyces: VVe haue all done amiſſe, and therefore we all craue pardon. When the byſhops of the Eaſte cryed agayne: That ſentence is iuſt, Chriſt depoſed the murtherer, Chriſt reuenged the martyrs, The Senators commaunded that euerye one of the byſhopes then preſent ſhoulde wryte his fayth ſeuerallye: perſwadinge them ſelues of a ſuretye that the moſte holye Emperour beleeued accordinge vnto the forme of fayth publyſhed at Nice by three hundred and eyghteene fathers, and agreeable vnto the creede framed at Conſtantinople, by a hundred and fiftye byſhops, and no otherwiſe then the Epiſtles of the holye fathers: Gregorie, Baſil, Hillarie, Athanaſius, Ambroſius, and the two Epiſtles of Cyrill reade in the firſt councell of Epheſus haue directed him: and that Leo the moſt reuerende byſhop of olde Rome, depoſed Eutyches for the contrarye. After the breakinge vp of this ſeſſion in ſuche ſort as you heare, when the holy byſhops had mette agayne and ſate together, Euſebius byſhop of Dorilaeum exhibited vnto them bils of complaynt, both in his owne name and in the perſon of Flauianus, where he charged Dioſcorus that he maintayned one hereſie and opinion wyth Eutyches, and that he had depoſed them of their prieſthood. He added moreouer that Dioſcorus had falſified the recordes by layinge downe certaine wordes which were not at all vttered in the councell then aſſembled together: that through wiles and craft he had procured blanks for them to ſubſcribe vnto. he made ſute vnto them againe that all the actes and canons of the ſeconde councell helde at Epheſus by their ſentence and autority might be abrogated: that they would reſtore them vnto their prieſtly function: that they would accurſe the deteſtable doctrine of Eutyches, and laſt of all he requeſted that after the reading of the records, his aduerſary might be brought before the councell. when this was graunted, Aetius the head notary ſtood vp and ſaid that he had bene with Dioſcorus as with the reſt, and that Dioſcorus had aunſwered him, that his keepers would not licence him to come vnto the councell. It was ſaide moreouer that Dioſcorus was ſought for before the councell ſate and could not be found, &amp; that Anatolius byſhop of Conſtantinople ſhould aunſwere he ſhould both be warned, and come vnto the councell. This being done ſuch as were ſent vnto him returned ſaying from Dioſcorus: My keepers wil not let me come, if they will licence me, let them ſpeak. but when y• meſſengers replied y• they were ſent not vnto the maiſters of y• ward, but vnto him, y• report goeth he aunſwered thus: I am redy to come vnto the holy &amp; generall councel, but I am ſtaid.

Dioſcorus beinge therein perſwaded, Iuuenalis, and Thalaſſius came thither. Eustathius bolted out ſuche thinges as were to no purpoſe, whereunto as it is recorded, Dioſcorus made aunſwere, and requeſted of the moſt religious Emperour that the preſidents and ſuche as had geuen iudgement with him in the councell, ſhoulde be ſent for thither. The meſſengers that were ſent vnto him aunſwered him againe, that Euſebius complayned vpon him alone, and that it needed not accordinge vnto his motion, to cite all to appeare. Dioſcorus replyed that by right as many as were Iudges with him in the councell ſhoulde be preſent, that Euſebius had no priuate action againſt him, but onely an accuſation agaynſt ſuche thinges as they all had decided and iudged. When the Legats vrged him with the ſame, Dioſcorus aunſwered: I tolde ye once what ye may truſt toe, I knowe not what I shoulde tell you agayne. After the relation of the aforeſayde, Euſebius byſhop of Dorylaeum proteſted that he charged no man with ought ſaue Dioſcorus alone, and requeſted that Dioſcorus might be called the thirde time.

The haynous offences whiche Dioſcorus late byshop of the noble citye of Alexandria, committed agaynſt the canons of councells, and the Eccleſiaſticall Diſcipline are throughly knowen of vs all, partly by ſiftinge out ſuche thinges as were hearde in the former ſeſſion, and partly alſo by examininge ſuche thynges as we decyded this daye. And that we may omitt manye other thinges, this man of his owne autoritye contrarye to the canon of the Churche receaued Eutyches into the communion, an hereticke of the ſame opinion wyth him, and one that was iuſtly depoſed by his owne proper byshop, to witt, the moſt holy father and our byshop Flauianus: and this he did before he shewed his face in the councell, whiche he helde with the moſt holy byshops at Epheſus. but the Apoſtolicke ſeae pardoned the byshops, becauſe they were conſtrained againſt their wills to doe that whiche they did: who yeelded them ſelues vnto this preſent houre both to Leo the moſt holy byshop, and to the whole ſacred and generall aſſembly of byshops, and therefore as men of one opinion wyth him he receaued them into the communion. As for this Dioſcorus he
                        
                        ceaſſeth not as yet to glorye of the thinges for the vvhiche he ought to mourne, lament and lye grouelinge vpon the grounde in ſackcloth and ashes. Not onely this but alſo he forbadd the readinge of holy Pope Leo his Epiſtle written vnto Flauianus of godly memorye, yea beinge oft intreated of the Legats, nay when he him ſelfe had promiſed with an othe that he woulde procure it to be reade. The defaulte in not readinge of whiche Epiſtle hath beene both an offence and hindrance vnto the holye Churches vnder heauen. Although he was priueye to ſuche levvde practiſes, yet haue vve aſſembled together to thende vve might deale ſomewhat fauourably both with him for all his former levvdeneſſe, and alſo in lyke ſort with the other godly byshopps whiche were not of equall autoritye with him in iudgement.

VVherefore let this holye councell geue the ſentence of Dioſcorus (of whome we haue hytherto ſpoken) accordinge vnto the canons of the Churche. When Anatolius, Maximus, with the reſt of the byſhops (thoſe onely excepted whome the Senators had depoſed wyth Dioſcorus) had confirmed the aforeſayde ſentence, the councell certified Martianus the Emperour of their decrees, and ſent a depriuation vnto Dioſcorus

Becauſe thou haſt deſpiſed the holye canons of the Churche: Becauſe thou haſte not obeyed this holye and generall councell: Becauſe thou art moreouer conuinced of manye other haynous crimes: Becauſe thou beinge thriſe called of this famous aſſemblye to aunſwere vnto ſuche thinges as were layde vnto thy charge, cameſt not, knowe that for all the aforeſayde, thou art depoſed by this holye and generall councell the thirteenth daye of this preſent October, of thy byshopricke, and bereaued of all Eccleſiaſticall right and title. Theſe thynges beinge regiſtred and ſent alſo vnto the godlye byſhops of the moſte holye Churche of Alexandria, and the decree agaynſte Dioſcorus openly proclaimed, that ſeſſion brake vp and ſo ended. But afterwards they ſate againe, and firſt they aunſwered the ſenators who had deſired to be ſatiſfied as touchinge the true and right faith: next they affirmed that there was nothinge to be done concerninge Eutyches, for the byſhop of Rome had made a

VVherefore our requeſte is, that the creede of the three hundred holye fathers and of the moſte holye Leo may be reade. Beinge reade all the councell cryed: This is the fayth of the true profeſſors, we are all of this fayth. This is the fayth of Pope Leo, this is the fayth of Cyrill, thus hath the Pope interpreted. Againe when they had reaſoned amonge them ſelues for the readinge of the fayth which the hundred and fifty holye fathers publyſhed in the councell helde at Constantinople, it was alſo reade. Then the whole councell cryed agayne. This is the fayth of the true profeſſors, thus we doe all beleeue. After the finiſhinge of all the premiſes Aetius the Archedeacon ſayde, I haue here at hande the Epiſtle of holye Cyrill, written vnto Nestorius, the whiche all the byſhopes in the councell helde at Epheſus confyrmed wyth their ſeuerall ſubſcriptions: I haue here alſo an other Epiſtle of the ſame Cyrill, written vnto Iohn byſhope of Antioche, and confirmed lykewyſe, will it pleaſe you to geeue them the hearinge.

Againe after a fewe lines he ſaith. The holy and famous councel affirmeth that he which is naturally begotten of God the father, is the onely begotten ſonne, true God of true God, light of light, by whom the father made all things: that he came downe from heauen, that he was incarnate and made man: that he ſuffred, roſe againe the third day &amp; aſcended into the heauens. It behoueth vs to yeelde and condeſcend vnto theſe articles, vnto this doctrine, and to ſearch out with al the gifts we haue, what is ment by being incarnate, &amp; what is vnderſtood by ſaying that the worde of God became flesh. for we doe not ſay that the worde of God by chaunginge the nature thereof became flesh, neither by conuerſion into wholl man which conſiſteth of body &amp; ſoule: but this rather, that the worde according vnto the ſubſiſtēcy or being therof, coupling vnto it ſelfe liuing flesh endued with a reaſonable ſoule, became man: in ſuch ſort as may neither be expreſſed in worde, neither conceaued by thought: &amp; that he was called the ſōne of man, not according vnto will onely, or in that it ſo pleaſed his goodnes, neither onely by taking vpon him the perſon, or becauſe contrarie natures were coupled together in true vnitye: but that one Chriſt and one ſonne conſiſted of two natures: not that the difference of the natures was taken away by reaſon of the vnity, but that the diuinitye and humanitye after an vnſpeakeable and ſecret couplinge and meetinge together made one Lorde, Chriſte, and the ſonne. After the enterlacinge of certayne other thinges he annexed thereunto as followeth. Becauſe he came of a woman and coupled mans nature vnto him ſelfe according vnto his ſubſiſtencie, and that for our ſake, and for our ſaluation, therefore is he ſaid to haue bene borne after the fleshe. for he was not firſt of all (after the common generation) borne of the virgine Mary, &amp; then the worde of God entred into him. but was coupled with the flesh in the matrix, and is ſaid to haue bene borne after the flesh, as one that made the birth of his flesh proper to him ſelfe. In like ſort we ſay that he ſuffred, roſe againe, not that God the word ſuffred in his owne nature either ſtripes, or the print of nayles, or other vexations, (for the godhead being without body is impatible) but that the body being made proper vnto him ſuffred, and ſo is he ſaide to haue ſuffred theſe thinges for our ſakes. for there was in the bodye which ſuffred, that which coulde not ſuffer.
                           
                        
                     
                      But ſo muche out of the firſt epiſtle. touchinge the ſecond we layde downe a good part thereof in the firſt booke of our Eccleſiaſticall hiſtorie which went before in the epiſtle of Iohn byſhopp of Antioch. there is ſuche a proteſtation layde downe as followeth, and confirmed with the teſtimonie of Cyrill.

After the readinge of theſe Epiſtles, they that were in the councell cried in this ſorte:: we are all of that fayth: Leo the Pope beleeueth ſo: curſed be he that deuydeth Chriſte, that confoundeth his natures: this is the fayth of Archebyshoppe Leo: thus beleeueth Leo, Leo and Anatolius are of this fayth. VVe are all of this fayth: Cyrill is of this fayth. Let Cyrill
                         neuer be forgotten.
                        
                        Let the epiſtles of Cyrill be euer had in memory. This is our opinion, thus we both haue beleued and doe beleue. Thus doth Archbishop Leo beleue, thus hath he wryttē. They reaſoned a while whether the epiſtle of Leo ſhould be read, in the ende they read it with the interpretation annexed thereunto, which is extant among the actes of the councell. When the reading was ended and the Byſhops had cried, this is the faith of the fathers, this is the faith of the Apoſtles, we are all of this faith, the true profeſſors are of this faith, curſed be he which beleueth not thus, Peter
                         in the perſon of Leo ſayde thus: thus haue the Apoſtles taught, Leo hath godly and truely taughte theſe things, Cyrill hath taught thus, Leo and Cyrill haue taught alike, curſed be he which holdeth not this faith, this is the true faith, this is the opinion of the true profeſſors, this is the faith of the fathers. why vvere not theſe things read in the councell of Epheſus, what meant Dioſcorus to conceale theſe things.

Againe out of the Epiſtle of Leo they read thus. Both natures accompanied together doth that which is proper to either of them: the word bringeth to paſſe ſuch things as belonge vnto the vvorde, the body vvorketh ſuch thinges as appertaineth vnto the body, the one vvorketh miracles the other ſuſtayneth reproches. Againe when the Byſhops of Illyrium &amp; Palaeſtina doubted alſo of this ſentence the ſame Aetius reade the words of Cyrill as followeth. Some
                        Cyrill. 
                        phraſes of holye Scripture whiche concerne the Lorde doe beſte agree vvith his diuine nature, ſome other vvith his humane nature, and ſome other the middle betvvene both, affirming that the ſonne of God is together both God and man. After all this when they doubted againe of an other parte of the aforeſayd epiſtle of Leo the Byſhop, which was read in this ſorte, Although in
                        Leo. 
                        very deede there is one perſon of God and man in the Lord Ieſus Chriſt: yet there is one thinge vvherein either of them doth participate in contumely and an other thinge vvherein they both communicate in glory, It is of vs that his humanity, is inferiour to the father, &amp; of the father it is that his diuinity is equall vvith the father, Theodoritus
                         remēbred him ſelfe that Cyrill had wryttenCyrill. the ſame thing almoſt in y• ſame wordes. when he was made man, he laid not a ſide his propriety but continevved as he vvas: and the one nature dvvelled in the other that is the diuine nature in the humane. Theſe things being expounded, when the worthy Senators had demaunded if any among them doubted any further, all made anſwere that they were fully reſolued. After this Atticus Byſhop of Nicopolis requeſted they might all haue a day geuen them to deliberate, to the end they might with firme and ſettled mindes eſtabliſhe ſuch things as were pleaſing vnto God and agreable with the doctrine of the fathers: he craued moreouer the epiſtle whiche Cyrill wrote vnto Neſtorius wherein he had exhorted hym to yelde vnto the twelue poincts of the fayth that were cō
                        firmed of all the Biſhops. The Preſidents conferred of this matter among thē ſelues &amp; graunted them fiue dayes to deliberate, that then they ſhould come togither with Anatolius biſhop of Conſtantinople, this being done they all agreed and ſayd with one voice: vve beleue thus, vve all beleue thus, as Leo beleueth ſo beleue vve, there is not one of vs that doubteth, we haue all ſubſcribed. Vnto theſe things they replied againe in this ſorte. It is not needefull that all ſhould come togither, but in ſomuch it ſeemeth very expedient that ſuch as wauer &amp; are not as yet reſolued may be confirmed, let the moſt reuerende Byſhop Anatolius appoint whome he ſhall thinke good of thē that haue already ſubſcribed to ſatisfie and confirme the reſt. After this the councell ſayd: we craue of the Fathers that the Preſidents and chiefe of this councell doe entreate the Emperour and the Empreſſe for vs, we haue all done amiſſe, let vs be pardoned. The clergie of the Church of Conſtantinople cried: fewe doe crie we heare not the wholl councell ſpeake. Then the Byſhops of the Eaſt lifted theyr voyces ſaying: let the Aegyptian be depoſed. And when the Biſhops of Illyrium requeſted the ſame, the clergy of Conſtantinople cried: let Dioſcorus be banished, let the Aegyptian be exiled, let the hereticke be ſent avvay, Chriſt hath depriued Dioſcorus.
                         Againe the Byshops

of Illyrium and ſuch as were of theyr ſide, cried: vve haue all offended, we beſech you pardō vs. Rid the councell of Dioſcorus, avvay vvith Dioſcorus out of the Churches. After they had toſſed theſe and other ſuch like things to and fro, they roſe vp. The next ſeſſion followinge when the Senate had reaſoned among them ſelues about the publiſhing of theyr actes and decrees, Conſtā

                        them ſelues ſomwhat better, we doe perceaue that they reaſoned more exquiſitly of the true and Catholicke faith. VVherefore ſeeing that Flauianus the Byshop of worthy memory &amp; Euſebius the moſt reuerend Bishop of Dorilaeum were founde not to haue erred in the fayth after we had ſearched the acts and decrees of the councel, &amp; alſo by the reporte of ſuch as were chief in the councell, and therefore vniuſtly to haue bene depoſed (for they confeſſed them ſelues fouly deceaued, &amp; wrongfully to haue depriued Flauianus and Euſebius) It ſeemeth good vnto vs &amp; no doubt God approueth the ſame, that Dioſcorus the moſt reuerend Bishop of Alexādria (if it ſo pleaſe our Lord the Emperour) Iuuenalis the moſt reuerend Bishop of Ieruſalē, Thalaſſius the moſt reuerend Bishop of Caeſarea in Cappadocia, Euſebius the moſt reuerend Bishop of Armenia, Euſtathius the moſt reuerēd Bishop of Berytus and Baſilius the moſt reuerend Bishop of Seleucia in Iſauria (who were then of autority and chiefe of the councel) should be punished alike, depoſed of their Bishopricks by the cenſure &amp; iudgement of the councel, as the canons of the church do require &amp; be at the Emperours pleaſure.
                         After other things were read the byſhops then preſent beinge demaunded whether the Epiſtles of Leo were agreable with the fayth of the three hundred &amp; eighteene holy Fathers aſſembled of old at Nice in Bithynia, and with the Creed of the hundred and fifty fathers in the councell held at Conſtantinople?

Immediatly the councell cried: we are all content, we doe all allowe the ſame, we are all of one faith, we are all of one opinion, we doe all be leue ſo. Thus haue the Fathers which are preſent in the councell beleued, thus haue they ſubſcribed. God graunt the Emperour a long life, God graunt the Empreſſe a long life, God graūt the Fathers of the councell many yeres, God preſerue the liues of ſuch as are of one faith &amp; opinion with the councell.

Cōcerning thoſe things we haue ſent vnto y• moſt holy, &amp; our moſt religious Lord the Emperour &amp; nowe we wayt for his highnes anſwere. Againe when ſome told them in this ſorte: your reuerence and wiſedomes haue to render an accompt vnto God for Dioſcorus, whome you haue depoſed vnknowen vnto y• Emperours moſt excellent maieſty, vnknowen vnto vs in like ſorte, and for all the things you haue complayned of, &amp; for the actes of this councell, they cried: God hath depriued Dioſcorus, Dioſcorus is iuſtly depoſed, Chriſt hath depriued Dioſcorus.
                         After all this when the Preſidēts had brought forth Martianus the Emperours anſwere where he had ſignified vnto them his pleaſure toutching the biſhops that were depoſed, the Biſhops requeſted and ſayde: we pray you as many as be of one opinion, as many as hold with the councell, as many as ſubſcribed in the councell vnto the Epiſtle of Leo, come into the councell, immediatly in they came, and downe they ſate.

Then all yt were in the councell cried: why haue not theſe men accurſed the opinion of Eutyches? let them ſubſcribe vnto the Epiſtle of Leo, and let thē accurſe Eutyches with his hereſie, let them condeſcend vnto the Epiſtle of Leo: peraduenture they goe about to deceaue &amp; beguile vs. The Biſhops of Aegypt made anſwere that theyr prouince had many Biſhops, and that they would not take vpon them to anſwere for ſuch as were abſent: they requeſted of the councell to ſtay for theyr Archbiſhop, that according vnto theyr maner &amp; cuſtome they may vphold his cenſure and opinion. They ſayd moreouer that if they would decide ought afore theyr Metropolitane were elected, the biſhops of Aegypt would make an inſurrection againſt them. When they had oft intreated and the councell withſtoode them, motion was made that the

Biſhops of Aegypt ſhould haue time vntill theyr Archbiſhop were choſen. Next the ſupplications of certaine Monks were brought forth, the ſumme whereof was yt not one of thē would take penne in hand to ſubſcribe before the generall aſſembly met which the Emperour had determined to call together, and before they vnderſtoode theyr decrees. With the reading thereof Diogenes biſhop of Cyzicum remebred that Barſumas was one of them which made an inſurrection and murthered Flauianus &amp; that he had cried, kill him. And nowe not hauing his name in the ſupplicatiō contrary to order, to haue preſumed to come vnto the councell. All the Biſhops cried at this, Barſumas hath peruered all Syria &amp; raiſed againſt vs a thouſand Monkes.
                         When it was moued that as many as were there ſhould waite the councells pleaſure and decree, the Monkes required that theyr ſupplications might be read. The effect of them was that Dioſcorus &amp; the Biſhops of his opinion might be preſent at the councell. All the councel was moued with this and cried: Let Dioſcorus be accurſed,
                        A company of cockebraine and hereticall Monks would be ruled neither by Biſhops nor by councell. 
                        Chriſt hath depoſed Dioſcorus, out with theſe Monkes, remoue shame frō the councel, take away force and iniurie, let not theſe impious and levvde ſayings come to the Emperours eares, let not the councell be diſcredited, away vvith infamy. The Monkes hearinge this cried of the contrary: take away contumely from the Monaſteries. When the councel had the ſecond time repeated the former exclamation, they conſulted that the reſt of the ſupplications were to be reade, where it was ſayde that Dioſcorus was iniuriouſly depoſed and that it behoued them of neceſſitie ſeeing the controuerſie toutching the fayth was to be decided, to haue his preſence in the councel: &amp; vnleſſe they would doe this that they would ſhake of the duſt from their feete and forſweare the cō

After they had made an end of ſpeaking, Aetius the Archdeacon read them the canon that concerned ſuch as deuided them ſelues from the Churche. Againe when the Monkes would not geue eare, neither be ruled by the moſt holy biſhops, neither by yt entreaty of Aetius the Archdeacon, when the one halfe of the councell woulde needes pronounce Neſtorius and Eutyches accurſed, and the other halfe withſtoode them, the Preſidents thought good y• the ſupplication of F

Agaynſte whome there were ſundry poincts of Eutyches doctrine toſſed to &amp; fro and diſcuſſed in preſence of the Princes. In the fift ſeſſion the Senators commaunded them to ſet forth the decrees and canons of religion after the playneſt ſorte. Aſclepiades Deacon of Conſtantinople read a certen canon the which they thought beſt not to be recorded, whereunto ſome gaue their conſents &amp; ſome other would not. when they had ſuppreſſed y• contrary voices, the Senators affirmed vpon Dioſcorus owne reporte, that he had depoſed Flauianus for ſaying there were two natures in Chriſt, &amp; that the decree bore wittnes that he cōſiſted of two natures. Then replied Anatolius: Dioſcorus was not depoſed for hereſie, but becauſe he excommunicated Leo, and being thriſe called vnto the councell would not come. After this y• Senators would haue the Epiſtle of Leo layd downe among the decrees, but the biſhops ſayd no, it ſhould not be, they would not drawe any other forme, for that was perfect inough, in the end they referred that vnto the Emperour, who commaunded that three biſhops of the Eaſt churches, three out of Pōtus, three out of Aſia, three out of Thracia and three out of Illyrium together with Anatolius and the ſubſtitutes of the Biſhop of Rome ſhould meete at the Church and orderly reaſon of the fayth, that either they ſhould lay downe theyr ſeuerall Creedes, or els knowe of a ſurety y• he would call a councell to decide that controuerſie in the Weſt. Beinge demaunded whether they would hold with Dioſcorus who affirmed y• Chriſt conſiſted of two natures, or ſubſcribe with Leo, who ſayd that there were two natures in Chriſt? they cried that they beleued with Leo &amp; held ſuch as ſayd y• contrary for Eutychians. The Senators replied y• 
                        Leo him ſelfe affirmed there were two natures ſo coupled in Chriſt, that they could be neither chaunged, diuided, nor confounded, with this ſaying they went into the temple of Euphemia accōpanied with Anatolius, the ſubſtituts of Leo, Maximus biſhop of Antioch, Iuuenalis biſhop of Ieruſalem, Thalaſſius
                         biſhop of Caeſarea, in Cappadocia and many others. Being ſet, the canon of the councell was read: Our Lorde &amp; Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt &amp;c. as we haue wrytten before. After it was read they cried: This is the faith of all the Fathers, we are all followers of this, we are all of this opinion, Then ſayd the Senators: the decrees and canons of the Fathers are to be referred vnto the Emperours moſt excellent maieſty▪ 
                        Martianus the Emperour was preſent at the ſixt ſeſſion, made an oration of peace &amp; vnity vnto the Biſhopps, and commaunded Aetius Archdeacon of Conſtātinople to read in his hearing that which was decided, whereunto they ſubſcribed euery one. Thē the Emperour aſked

them whether the decree was eſtabliſhed by their generall conſent, they all the ſecond time anſwered, yea. Againe the Emperour made vnto them two orations which were highely commended of them all. In the end the canons by the meanes of the Emperour were confirmed, and the ſeae of Chalcedon was made an Archbiſhopricke: the Emperour moreouer commaunded the Biſhops to continewe there three or foure dayes, and to propoſe before the Princes and Senators what euery one thought good to be decided, &amp; that they ſhould decree that which ſeemed expediēnt. Then the ſeſſion brake vp. There were other decrees and other canons eſtabliſhed, and there was an other councel held by Iuuenalis &amp; Maximus where it was decreed that the biſhop of Antioch ſhould haue either of both Phaenicia and Arabia annexed vnto his prouince, &amp; the Biſhop of Ieruſalem, all the three Palaeſtinas, the which after conſultation had both by the Preſidents and Biſhops was confirmed. In the ninth ſeſſion the cauſe of Theodoritus was heard who accurſed Nestorius in theſe words: curſed be Nestorius &amp; whoſoeuer beſides him denieth Marie the virgine to be the mother

                         After deliberation had amonge them ſelues, they reſtored him vnto his Biſhoprick. In the tenth ſeſſion the ſute of Ibas was heardIbas. and the ſentence which Photius Biſhop of Tyrus and Euſtathius Biſhop of Berytus had pronounced againſt him was read, but the finall end was differed vnto the next day. In the eleuenth ſeſſiō when many Biſhops would haue him reſtored, diuerſe Biſhops were againſt it and ſayd, that his accuſers were at the dore and redy to come in. At lēgth they read what they had decreed toutching him. Yet the Senators moued the councell that the Actes of the councell held at Epheſus whiche concerned Ibas ſhould be read, and that all the acts of the ſecond councell of Epheſus ſhoulde be abrogated, the creation of Maximus Biſhop of Antioch onely excepted: they intreated therein the Emperour that nothinge whatſoeuer was decreed ſince the firſt councell of Epheſus where holye Cyrill Byſhop of Alexandria was chiefe ſhoulde be of force and they gaue ſentence that Maximus ſhould enioy his Biſhoprick. In an other ſeſſion Baſianus the Biſhop of Epheſus matter was called, and decreed that Baſianus ſhould be remoued out of his Biſhopricke, and Stephan placed in hisBaſianus. rowme. In the thirteenth ſeſſion Eunomius Biſhop of Nicomedia and Anaſtaſius Biſhop of Nice were called, for they contended among them ſelues about their cities. The foureteeneth ſeſſion was helde for the hearinge of Baſianus. Laſt of all it was decreed that the ſeae of Conſtantinople ſhould enioy the next prerogatiue after Rome.

He was ſo odious vnto his ſubiectes who by right deteſted his abhominable life: he had no ſtomacke at all, no ſhewe of a noble mynde, but all luſkiſh and lither of a naughty condition the whiche his ſenſualitye declared bearinge rule ouer his cowarde minde and ſlouthfull diſpoſition. Wherefore this Zeno together with Ariadne his wife whome he had with him, who alſo had fledde awaye from her mother (and if there were any other that bore him good will) gotte him into Iſauria where he had bene broughte vp and there he was beſieged. Thus Baſiliſcus came to be Emperoure of Rome, proclaymed his ſome Marcus, Caeſar, and layde downe a platforme of gouernemente farre contrary both vnto the maner of Zenos raygne and ſuch as were Emperours before him.

Shortely after Timothee died, Iohn gaue a peece of money (as Zacharie doth wryte) neglected the othe he made vnto the Emperour, and was choſen Biſhop of Alexandria. When this was knowen the Emperour baniſhed him Alexandria, wrote by ſome mens procuremente an Epiſtle vnto the people of Alexandria, of vnitye and concorde, and commaunded that Peter ſhoulde be reſtored vnto the Byſhopricke condicionally if he ſubſcribed vnto the Epiſtle and receaued into the communion ſuche as helde with Proterius.

Whereupon Peter receaued the Epiſtle and ſubſcribed vnto it: promiſed moreouer to admit his aduerſaries into the communiō.

                     ZEno Emperour Caeſar, Pius, Victorious Triumphant, chiefe Lord, perpetual Auguſtus vnto the moſt reuerend bishops throughout Alexandria, Aegypt, Libya &amp; Pentapolis with the Prieſts, Mōks &amp; laye people, ſendeth greeting. In ſomuch we are certenly perſwaded that the originall cōfirmation, continewāce, ſtrēgth &amp; inuincible fortres of our Emperiall ſcepter is only vpheld by the ſincere &amp; true faith (the which three hūdred &amp; eighteene holy fathers deliuered vnto vs by the inſpiratiō of the holy Ghoſt in the councell of Nice, &amp; was alſo confirmed of a hundred &amp; fifty godly Bishops in the councel held at Cōſtantinople) we haue labored day and nighte not onely by prayer but with all endeuer and vvyth publishinge of lawes, amply and aboundantly to ſill vvith it the holy, Catholick, and Apoſtolick Church of God ſcattered far &amp; vvide ouer the face of the earth, being the immortall and ſempiternall parent of this our raygne and principalitye: that the deuoute people of God continewinge the diuine peace and quietnes

may poure vnto God the acceptable ſacrifice of prayer, together with the moſt holy Bishops &amp; ſacred clergy, with the gouernours of Monaſteries &amp; Monkes them ſelues for the preſeruatiō of our proſperous raygne. For in caſe that almighty God and our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt, who tooke flesh of the virgine Mary the mother of God &amp; was borne into the worlde would allowe of the general praiſes &amp; worship we geue vnto him &amp; receaue the ſame with willīg minde &amp; redines, then no doubt not onely all ſorts of enemies woulde vtterly be foyled, but alſo all other nations vnder heauen would be brought ſubiect vnto our Empire, &amp; willingly ſerue vs next &amp; immediatly after God: then alſo peace &amp; the profit annexed therunto, ſeaſonable tēperature of the aer, plenty of all ſorts of fruite, with all other things required for the vſe of mā would abūdantly be miniſtred. Nowe therfore ſeing it appeareth vnto all men howe both we our ſelues &amp; the Empire of Rome is preſerued vnder the wing of the true faith; the holy gouernours of the monaſteries &amp; heremits with other religious mē exhibited vnto vs ſupplicatiōs, exhortīg vs very earneſtly that the moſt holy churches may enioy peace, that the mēbers may be coupled together whiche the deuel enemy to honeſty hath labored of a lōg time to part aſunder, for he is fully perſwaded that if the body of the church being ioyntly knit together in the bond of vnity encountred with him, he would quickly be ouerthrowē. by reaſon the mēbers were ſeuered, it came to paſſe that infinit multituds of mē, now many hundred yeres ago departed this world, ſome without baptiſme, ſome other without the cōmunion being void of charity (the dynt of death is ineuitable) it cauſed moreouer infinit ſlaughters &amp; bloodshed, not only the earth but the aer alſo was infected with ſtreames of blood is huinge out of the tender bowells of men. And who is he (I pray you) that wisheth not for reformatō &amp; redreſſe of theſe things? wherfore we haue done our indeuor for to certifie you, that not onely we our ſelues but all the churches euery where haue not had in times paſt, neither preſent, will not haue herafter, neither knowe any other that haue any other faith or doctrine, then the creede (ſpoken of before) deliuered by three hūdred &amp; eighteen Byshops &amp; confirmed afterwardes by a hundred &amp; fifty fathers. But if any man haue any other creede we take him not to be of the church. For we beleue that through this faith only it cometh to paſſe that our Empire doth florish: that the people by embracīg of the ſame are inſpired with the holy Ghoſt &amp; washed in the ſacred fountaine of baptiſme: it was this faith that the holy fathers in the councell of Epheſus ſubſcribed vnto, which depoſed wicked Neſtorius of the Eccleſiaſticall miniſtery &amp; as many as fauored his hereticall opinion whome we alſo doe accurſe together with Eutyches (for both of them impugned the aforeſayde faith) and approue the twelue pointes of the faith layde downe by Cyrill of worthy memorye, late Archbishop of the Catholicke church of Alexandria. For we confeſſe that the onely begotten ſonne of God our Lord Ieſus Chriſt is truely incarnate, of one ſubſtance with the father accordinge vnto his diuinity, &amp; of one ſubſtance with vs accordinge vnto his humanity: that he came downe from heauen: that by the holy Ghoſte he tooke fleshe of the virgine Mary the mother of God: that he is one and not two. For we ſay that the miracles he wrought &amp; the vexations he endured in the flesh belonged vnto one perſon. we doe condemne for euer ſuch as deuide, or confound his natures, or ſay that he had a phantaſticall body. For he was truely incarnate of the mother of God without ſpott or blemish of ſinne. The Trinity remayneth neuertheleſſe though one perſon of the Trinity, to wit, God the worde be incarnate. VVherfore ſeing we learne of ſurety that all the holy and Catholicke Churches euery where, that all the godly Preſidentes and gouernours thereof, and that our Empire neither hath allowed neither will retayne any other creede or forme of faith, then that we ſpake of euen nowe, let vs ioyntly without any more a doe be reconciled and embrace vnity and concorde. Theſe things haue we wrytten vnto you, not to innouate ought as toutching the faith, but fully to ſatisfie you therein. VVe doe accurſe whoſoeuer hath beleued or doth beleue the contrary, either nowe or at other times, either in the councell of Chalcedon, or in any other councell whatſoeuer▪ but ſpecially of all others we doe accurſe Neſtorius, Eutyches and their cō
                        plices. VVherefore hold with your Ghoſtly mother the Churche, and celebrate therein together with vs the one holy cōmunion according vnto that one fayth of the three hundred &amp; eighteen holy fathers. For your moſt holy mother the Church groneth after you and deſireth to embrace you which are her naturall children, moreouer she longeth to heare your ſweete voyces. Get ye thither in all the haſt. If ye doe this ye shal not onely purchaſe vnto your ſelues the fauour of our Lord &amp; Sauiour Chriſt Ieſus, but alſo the cōmendation of our highnes. This epiſtle being read, all the people of Alexandria returned vnto the Catholick and Apoſtolicke Church.

For he made reporte that they depoſed him of his biſhoprick for maintaining the decrees of Leo and the councell of Chalcedon, and that there was an other placed in his rowme, which impugned the ſame. Simplicius Biſhop of olde Rome hearing of this, was wonderfully moued, and wrote in his behalfe vnto the Emperour Zeno: but Zeno anſwered him againe, accuſed Iohn of periurie and that therefore and for no other crime he was depoſed.

Yet afterwardes this Calandio was baniſhed into Oaſis for holdinge with Ilus, Leo and Pampreps, againſt Zena. Peter ſirnamed Cnapheus who was Biſhop of Antioch before Calandio &amp; Stephan, recouered his biſhopricke againe, ſubſcribed vnto Zenos Epiſtle of Concorde &amp; wrote ſynodall letters vnto Peter Moggus Biſhop of Alexandria. Acacius
                         Biſhop of Conſtantinople was afterwardes reconciled vnto this Peter, Martyrius likewiſe Biſhop of Ieruſalem wrote ſynodall letters vnto him.

VVherfore beinge holpen with your prayers, we haue deuiſed theſe letters, as a ſalue for this miſchief, which derogate nothing at all from the councell of Chalcedon, fully ſatisfyinge our ſelues that there was no noueltie eſtablished therein.

The meſſengers that brought this Epiſtle vnto Acacius were the paynefull and vigilant monks called Acoimetoi. Zacharie is the

Wherefore I my ſelfe will now write the ſtories as they were in deede.

                        FElix wrote not onely vnto Zeno, but alſo vnto others, where he brought them into remembrance partly of the councell of Chalcedon, and partly alſo of the perſecution in Aphrik in the raigne of Theodorichus. He wrote an other Epiſtle vnto Acacius, but Zeno wrote backe againe,

and tolde him that he fought with his ſhadowe, in geuing eare vnto Iohns report, and in contendinge with his aduerſaries: for he was the man that bound him ſelf with an othe, that he would neuer be Byſhop of Alexandria, yet afterwardes was founde periured, and to committe euerye kinde of ſacrilege: that Peter was aduaunced vnto the prieſtly function, not wythout good tryall of his faythe, that he ſubſcribed wyth his owne hande, and approued the faythe of the hree hundred and eyghteene holy fathers in the councell of Nice, which fayth was afterwardesZeno the Emperour vnto Felix b. of Rome. ratifyed by the councell of Chalcedon. Theſe were the wordes of Zeno: VVe woulde haue you aſſure your ſelfe that our highneſſe with moſte holye Peter (mentioned before) and all the Chriſtian congregations doe embrace and reuerence the ſacred councell of Chalcedon, which councell is one in effect with the Nicene creede.
                         There are Epiſtles to be ſeene amonge the actes of the aforeſayde councell, partly of Cyrill (mentioned before) and partly of other gouernours of the monaſteries of Conſtantinople, and of the byſhops and clergie within the prouince of Aegypt vnto Felix byſhop of Rome, againſt Peter as an heretick, and againſt all them that communicated with him. As many of the vigilant monks as came to Felix rebuked Miſinus and 
                           Ʋitalis becauſe that vntill their comminge to Conſtantinople the name of Peter was ſecretely vſed to be reade in the holy catalogue, but ſince that time continually vnto this preſent houre Miſinus and 
                           Ʋitalis communicated with Peter. The Epiſtle whiche the Byſhops of Aegypte wrote ſignified this muche of Peter, and that Iohn was of the true fayth, and conſecrated accordinge vnto the canons of the Churche: that Peter was ordered onely by two Byſhops infected with the ſame exror with him, and that immediately after the flight of Iohn he left no puniſhment vnpractiſed vpon the true profeſſors. All which circumſtances are ſaid to haue bene ſignified vnto Acacius and that Acacius ayded Peter in all what ſo euer he went about.

                     THe aforeſayd accuſations were augmented at the report of Symeon one of the vigilant monks whome Cyrill had ſente vnto Felix. For Miſinus and 
                           Ʋitalis were reprehended of him becauſe they communicated with heretickes, ſpecially ſeeing the name of Peter the hereticke was openly reade in the holy catalogue: and that in ſo doing many ſimple men were ſnared of the hereticks, who ſticked not to bragge that the Byſhop of Rome receaued Peter into the communion. Symeon ſayde moreouer that when certaine interrogatories were demaunded, Miſinus and his company woulde not conferre with the true catholickes, would not receaue their writin̄gs, neither exquiſitly ſift out ſuche thinges as were done, and greatly did preiudice the true fayth. Syluanus the prieſte who accompanied Miſinus and

In the ſame decree this alſo was compriſed: It appeared euidently that Acacius byshop of Conſtantinople was greatly to be blamed, becauſe for all he wrote vnto Simplicius and called Peter an hereticke, yet he would not make Zeno priuey thereunto, when as in verie deede, if he had borne good will vnto Zeno he should haue done it. And rather he should haue pleaſed the Emperour then prouided for the fayth. But let vs returne to diſcourſe of the hiſtorie.

                        WHen the ſchiſme waxed hotte, and the ſedition grieuous within the citie of Alexandria, Peter
                         perſwaded certaine Byſhops and gouernours of monaſteries to communicate with him. There he condemned and accurſed the decrees of Leo, the actes of the Chalcedon councell, and ſuche as woulde not receaue the bookes of Dioſcorus and Timothee. Manye others he baniſhed their monaſteries when he could not allure them to his hereticall opinion. wherfore Nephalius tooke his voyage to Conſtantinople, reuealed the wholl vnto Zeno, who therefore was wonderfull ſorie, and ſent thither Coſmas one of his garde for to threaten and rebuke Peter verie ſharpely, partly for coutemninge the Epiſtle of Zeno intitled of concorde, and partly alſo becauſe that through his rough dealinge ſo great a ſedition was rayſed. But when Coſmas could preuaile in nothinge ſaue onely that the expulſed monks were reſtored by his meanes vnto their monaſteries, backe againe he got him to the Emperour. Wherefore the Emperour the ſeconde time ſent Arſenius lieuetenant of Aegypt, and captaine of the garriſon amongeſt them, who together with Nephalius went ſtraighte to Alexandria, entreated them to keepe the peace: but when he could not obtaine his purpoſe, he ſent ſome of them to Conſtantinople. And for al there was great reaſoninge in the preſence of Zeno about the councell of Chalcedon, yet was there nothinge concluded, for neither did Zeno wholly cleaue vnto it.

He wrote letters of amitie vnto Peter, but Peter aunſwered him againe, and inueyed bitterly againſt the councell of Chalcedon. This Phranitas continewed Byſhop no longer then foure moneths but he died and left Euphemius to ſucceede him. When Peter wrote vnto him alſo letters of amitie, and Euphemius perceaued that in them he accurſed the councell of Chalcedon, he was all out of quiet, and woulde in no wiſe communicate with Peter. Both their Epiſtles are extant, Phranitas vnto Peter, and Peter vnto Phranitas, the whiche I will omitte, becauſe they are longe and tedious. When Euphemius and Peter contended among them ſelues, and while they purpoſed to call ſynods together one againſt the other, it fell out that Peter departed this life, in whoſe rowme Athanaſius ſucceeded, which laboured with all might to reconcile ſuche as were at diſcorde and diſſention, but he could not preuaile becauſe their mindes were ſo drawen into diuers and different opinions. The ſame Athanaſius wrote afterwardes letters of amitie vnto Palladius the ſucceſſor of Peter in the byſhopricke of Antioch, ſpecially concerning the councell of Chalcedon. So did Iohn the ſucceſſor of Athanaſius in the ſeae of Alexandria. Moreouer when Palladius Byſhop of Antioch had departed this life, Flauianus ſucceeded him, and ſent Solomon prieſt of Antioch to Alexandria with letters of amitie vnto Iohn, requiringe an aunſwere by the ſame meſſenger. After the deceaſſe of Iohn, an other Iohn ſucceeded him in the byſhopricke of Alexandria.

We our ſelues haue ſeene theſe gates retayninge as yet not onely the name, but alſo relyques of the auncient bewtie, in that there are now ſtones there which were caried thither out of the Iſle Proconneſus, where with the floore is paued.

And after he had condemned thoſe men with his owne hand he wrote vnto the Emperour, for theſe men had ſet him vp againſt Flauianus, as if he had beene patrone of Nestorius hereſie. Neyther was Xenaias ſatisfied with this, but agayne required Flauianus to condemne both the Councell and ſuche as affyrmed there were two natures in Chriſte, the one humane, the other diuine, who for refuſinge to doe this, is charged a freshe wyth Nestorius opinion. Laſt of all after much adoe, when the patriarch had published a forme of faith where he had vnfainedly geuen to vnderſtand that the councell as toutching the depriuation of Nestorius and Eutyches was to be approued, but not for their decree of the faith &amp; doctrine: they threaten to take him in hand againe, as one that ſecretly ſauored of Nestorius, vnleſſe he woulde accurſe both the Councell it ſelfe, and them that affirmed there were two natures

In the meane ſpace they requeſted the Byshop of Ieruſalem to laye downe his fayth in writinge, the whiche he did, and ſent it by the faction of Dioſcorus vnto the Emperour. This

But the byshop of Ieruſalem charged them they had corrupted his faith, wrote an other where there was no ſuche accurſe: But no maruell at all, for they haue corrupted oftentimes the bookes and writinges of the holye fathers, by chaunginge their titles and inſcriptions, and fatheringe the workes of Apollinarius the hereticke vpon Athanaſius, Gregorie the renowmed, and Iulius, ſnaringe many of the ſimple people with theſe their wiles and ſubtlety in their hereticall opinions. They craued alſo of Macedonius they might ſee his beliefe in writinge, who proteſted he onely allowed the fayth published of olde at Nice by three hundred and eyghteene holye fathers, and afterwardes ratified at Conſtantinople, accurſinge Nestorius, Eutyches, wyth ſuche as ſayde there were two ſonnes, or two Chriſtes, or deuided the natures: yet ſpake he not a worde of the Epheſine Councell, whiche depoſed Nestorius, neyther of the Chalcedon Councell, whiche depriued Eutyches. VVherefore the Monkes of Conſtantinople were wonderfully moued with this, and deuided them ſelues from Macedonius. All this while Xenaias and Dioſcorus hauinge linked vnto their ſide manye other Byshops, behaued them ſelues intollerably towardes ſuche as woulde not accurſe whome they woulde haue accurſed, in ſo muche they procured diuers, becauſe they woulde not yeelde vnto them, to be banished. Thus they made Macedonius, Iohn Byshop of Platum, and Flauianus to leaue the countrey. So farre of the monks letters.

                     THe thinges which ſecretly vexed the minde of Anastaſius were farre otherwiſe. For when Ariadne purpoſed to preſent Anastaſius with the Emperiall robe, Euphemius the Byſhop would in no wiſe cōſent to his coronation vntill y• 
                        Anaſtaſius deliuered him his hand writing confirmed with an othe, where he plainely declared if he were Emperour, he would maintaine the true faith, &amp; bringe no nouelty into the Church of God, whiche hand writinge he gaue Macedonius the treaſurer to keping. Euphemius did this becauſe Anastaſius was ſuſpected to be a Manichee. When Macedonius was aduaunced to the reuerende office of prieſthood, Anaſtaſius called for his hand writing, It is (ſaith he) a great diſcredit vnto our ſcepter, that our hand ſhould be kept to teſtifie againſt vs, or that we ſhoulde be tyed to penne and paper. But Macedonius denyed him very ſtoutly, and affirmed plainely it ſhoulde neuer be ſaide of him that he betrayed the fayth: therefore Anaſtaſius the Emperour deuiſed howe to worke him miſchiefe, to thende he might colourablye depoſe him. At length there came forth yonge men ſclaunderinge both them ſelues and Macedonius alſo of an haynous offence: they founde him to haue wanted the member of generation, then proceded they to eſpy other holes in his coat, neither reſted they vntil at length through y• fetches of Celer maiſter of y• hauliers, they had priuely wrought his depriuation.

When Flauianus tooke the matter verye grieuouſlye, and the monkes vrged him wyth violence: The citizens by reaſon of that greate ſturre and ſedition, made ſuche a ſlaughter of the monks, that manye of them, naye an infinit number in ſteede of quiet earth and ſtill graue, were buryed in the ſwifte waues of the riuer Orontes.

This Seuerus was borne in Soxopolis a citie of Piſidia, before they made him byſhop, he pleaded lawe at Berytus. But as ſoone as he was baptized in the Churche of Leontius the holy martyr, whom Tripolis a citie lyinge on the Sea coſt of Phoenicia doth honor, he tranſlated his ſtudye from lawe vnto monaſticall life the whiche he led in a monaſtery, lyinge in the middes betweene Gaza and Maiuma. Where Peter the Iberian, Byſhope ſometime of Gaza, and the companion of Timotheus Aelurus, both in ſuſtayninge of baniſhment, and ſubſtance of doctrine, was muche ſpoken of. Furthermore Seuerus (of whome I purpoſe to entreat) conferringe with Nephalius (who ſometime was of one religion with him, to wit, that there was one nature in Chriſte, yet afterwardes helde wyth the Councell of Chalcedon, and ſuche as ſayde there were two natures in our Lorde Christe Ieſus) was expulſed the monaſterye by Nephalius and his complices, together with manye others of his opinion. Thence he went ſtraight to Conſtantinople, both for him ſelfe and in the name of all the reſt that were expelled with him, and ſo became acquainted with the Emperour Anaſtaſius, as it is reported by him that wrote Seuerus life. Wherefore he wrote letters vnto the patrons of his opinion of their mutuall loue and agreement, where by name he condemneth the Councell of Chalcedon. This whiche I ſpeake of, is layde downe by the monks in their Epiſtle vnto 
                           Alciſon.
                           The monks of Palaeſtina vnto Alciſon The Epiſtle whiche Timothee nowe Byshope of Conſtantinople, wrote vnto the monkes here in Palaestina of mutuall loue and agreement was receaued: But the depriuation of Macedonius and Flauianus, together with the letters of Seuerus was reiected. The meſſengers that brought the letters, were as they deſerued contumeliouſlye entreated (for the citizens and monkes conſpired their deathes) that they were fayne to runne awaye for to ſaue theyr lyues. And thus it went with vs in Palaeſtina. But of the prouinces of Antioch, they were partly ledde into error wyth others, namelye Martinus Byshope of Berytus, and partly conſtrayned to ſubſcribe vnto Seuerus letters of mutuall loue and agreement, whiche accurſed not onely the Councell, but alſo who ſo euer affirmed there were two natures in Chriſt, the one diuine, the other humane. But ſuche as were compelled to geeue theyr conſent, repented them afterwardes, and returned vnto the Churche, namelye the Byshopes throughout the prouince of Apamia. There were other ſome that woulde in no wiſe agree, of whiche number Iulianus Byshope of Boſtra was ſayde to be, Epiphanius Byshope of Tyrus wyth other Byshopes. The Iſaurians after repentaunce condemned theyr former error and follye, and accurſed Seuerus wyth all that fauored him. Other Byshopes and prieſtes wythin Seuerus iuriſdiction, forſooke their Churches, namelye Iulianus Byshope of Boſtra, Peter Byshope of Damaſcus, who lyue here wyth vs: Mamas alſo wyth one of the two Dioſcorians, who affirmed there were two natures from the beginninge, whoſe wilfull frowardneſſe made Seuerus whether he woulde or no to condemne them.

Coſmas Byſhope of our Epiphania vpon the ryuer Orontes, &amp; Seuerianus byſhop of Arethuſa a bordering citie, being very muche offended with Seuerus letters of mutuall loue and agreement, firſt of all deuided them ſelues from his communion, nexte ſent vnto him a Libell of depriuation, for all he gouerned the Byſhopricke of Antioch, deliueringe it vnto Aurelianus chiefe Deacon of Epiphania: who becauſe he feared Seuerus, and reuerenced the autoritye of ſo worthye a Byſhopricke, at his firſte comminge to Antioch, arayed him ſelfe in womans attyre, and ſo got him to Seuerus: He behaued him ſelfe ſo ſoftlye, &amp; ſo effeminatly, that they tooke him to be a woman in deede: He muffled him ſelfe and pulled the veyle ouer his heade as farre as his breſte: He whined wyth a ſhrill and pitifull voyce, he ſighed deepelye: He crooched lyke a poore ſuter, and as Seuerus paſſed by, he reached into his hand the bill of depriuation, when he had ſo done, he priuelye conueyed himſelfe awaye from the traine that followed Seuerus, and ſo was out of theyr reach ere Seuerus coulde learne what was contayned in the Libell, But Seuerus though he receaued the Libell, and perceaued what they had written therein, continewed neuer the leſſe in his Byſhopricke vnto the death of Anastaſius the Emperour. When Anastaſius vnderſtoode of the circumſtances whiche happened vnto Seuerus (I can not chuſe but recorde in this place the good nature and clemencie of Anastaſius) he charged Aſiaticus Lieuetenant of Libaeeſa in Phoenicia, to remoue Coſmas and Seuerianus from theyr Byſhoprickes, becauſe they ſent vnto Seuerus the Libell of depriuation. After his comminge into the Eaſte, and perceauinge howe that manye were of Seuerianus and Coſmas opinion, and that they defended theyr cityes manfullye, he wrote backe vnto Anastaſius thatThe clemencie of Anaſtaſius. there was no diſplacinge of them wythout ſlaughter and bloodſhed. Wherefore there was ſo muche mercye and pitye in the minde of Anastaſius, that he ſignifyed vnto Aſiaticus in playne wordes he woulde haue no enterpriſe taken in hande, were it neuer ſo noble, or ſo worthye, if it did coſte him as muche as one droppe of bloode. In this ſtate were the Eccleſiaſticall affayres duringe the raygne of Anastaſius, whome ſome men haue blotted out of the ſacred catalogue as enemy vnto the councell of Chalcedon, for at Ieruſalem he was accurſed.

                        The b. of Apamia a rebell. marched forwardes to battayle. There came to ayde him the Byſhope of Apamia in Syria. Shortlye after the battayle was ended, partlye becauſe the Iſaurians whiche fought wyth Longinus were foyled euerye one, and partlye alſo becauſe the heades of Longinus and Theodorus were ſent of Iohn the Scythian to Conſtantinople, and there by the commaundement of the Emperour ſtickt vp on polles beyonde the water, ouer againſt Conſtantinople, in a place called Sycae. It was a goodly ſight vnto the citizens of Conſtantinople, for Zeno and the Iſaurianꝰ had grieuouſlye vexed them diuers tymes before. A ſeconde Longinus ſyrnamed Selinuncius one of theLonginus.

This tribute was ſette (omittinge diuerſe ſorts of people) vpon ſuche as lyued by fylthye lucre and gayne, vpon naughtipackes whiche made ſale of ſhamefaſtneſſe, haunted brothelhouſes, and proſtrated them ſelues in blynde corners of the citye: To be ſhort, vpon all ſuche as were not aſhamed to committee whoredome: Who iniured nature not a litle, and brought the common weale to great reproche and infamy, in ſo muche

that the filthye gayne gotten thereby allured thereunto ſuche as burned wyth bruitiſhe luſte and concupiſcence, no otherwyſe then a lawe or proclamation. Agayne the gatherers of this impious and abhominable tribute acrueinge by reaſon of ſuche haynous offences brought it euerye fourth yeare vnto the chiefe magiſtrate, ſo that it was thought to be one of the chiefeſt tributes that belonged vnto the crowne, and layde it vp in the Gardiuiance or priueye coffers. The ceaſſers were not of the ſimpleſt ſort, and meaneſt perſons, neyther the office numbred amonge the baſeſt in the common weale. Anastaſius vnderſtandinge the whole made the Senate priueye thereunto, tolde them what an haynous and an horrible acte it was, commaunded it ſhoulde quite be taken away, and burned the rolles whiche directed them vnto the ceaſſed and taxed polls. Furthermore when he purpoſed with him ſelfe to offer ſacrifice vnto God in rootinge out that filthe and abhomination, to thende it might be vnpoſſible for any after him to reuiue thoſe olde dregges of Lecherye: He fayned him ſelfe to be in a greate agonye, accuſed him ſelfe of raſhe dealinge, and meere madneſſe, ſayinge he was toe vayne glorious, and by that meanes weyed not the vtilitye and profitte of the common weale, in that he had taken awaye both fooliſhlye and wythout aduiſement, ſo large a tribute, begonne ſo manye yeares agoe, and continewed ſo longe a time not foreſeeinge the diſcommodityes that enſued, by reaſon of the wante thereof, the charges for mayntenance of ſoldiers, the ſtrength of the common weale, The tribute beinge as a fortreſſe to defende it, the liberalitye riſinge thence, and turned to vpholde the ſeruice of God. Laſte of all makinge no man of his counſell, he proclaymed that his will was the tribute ſhoulde be wholly reſtored againe: therefore he called vnto him the olde receauers, he tolde them that he was ſorye for the burninge of the recordes, that he knewe not what to doe, howe to excuſe his folly, neyther what to deuiſe, ſeeinge their regiſteries were conſumed to aſhes. When as they vnfaynedlye and from the very heart bewayled their loſſe, and the want of the ill gotten goods which came thereby into their hands, and tolde him playnely that it was in manner vnpoſſible to reſtore the tribute againe: he requeſted them to doe all their indeuor, and to ſearche if happely they might finde amonge all the recordes that were in anye place preſerued, the order of demaundinge the taxe and tribute. Wherefore he ſent vnto euerye one of them his charges for ſearchinge the countreys and recordes, and commaunded that euerye deede or ſcrole which made mention thereof, where ſo euer it were founde ſhoulde be brought vnto him, to thende this taxe might be reſtored agayne in ſuche good order that it coulde neuer fall afterwardes into decaye. Shortly after when theſe meſſengers of truſt brought tydings what they had founde, Anastaſius was wonderfull glad, and ſeemed to tickle at the heart for ioy, he reioyſed in deede becauſe now he had brought about that which troubled him ſo muche. What (ſayth he vnto them) haue ye founde any recordes? where found ye them? be they to any purpoſe? doe ye thinke there are any where any more left behinde? they aunſwered that their trauell had bene greate, that they rode about daye and night, that they had ſearched both towne and countrey, and ſwore by the life of the Emperour, that there was not left in al the empire of Rome, not as much as a patch of any ſcrole that was not brought vnto him. then the Emperour commaunded a pile to be made, all the papers, regiſters, recordes, bills, and baudy notes to be ſet thereon, and burned to aſhes. when the fire had done his part, he gaue commaundement they ſhould throwe water vpon the aſhes, either quite to drowne them, or to driue thē away with the ſtreame, purpoſing fully by this means for euer to tread vnderfoot the ſcroles of the baudy tribute, that neither ſparcle, neither aſhes, neither letter, neither any memoriall ſhoulde remaine after the firing of the records. But while we commend Anaſtaſius ſo highly for baniſhinge this ſhamefull tribute, leſt we ſeeme ignorant what diuers men of old being wedded to their owne affections haue reported of him, we thought good here to lay downe their ſayinges, and conuince them with their owne words.

Remember I beſech thee howe about the time of the incarnation of our Sauiour Chriſt Ieſus many of the Macedonians were by the Romaynes ſubdued: Albania, Iberia, Colchi and the Arabians: moreouer the Frenchmen, the Germans, the Brittanns, in the hundred twenty &amp; third Olympiade after Caius Caeſar had ouercome them with greate and grieuous battaills, and made the fiue hundred cities which they inhabited, tributaries (as hiſtoriographers doe wryte) vnto the Empire of Rome. This Caius was the firſt which after the Conſulls gouerned the Empire alone, he made the way ſure for the ſetting vp of the glorious Monarchie, and in ſteede of the populare and common regiment, brought into the worlde that kind of raigne. No doubt it came to paſſe through the prouidēce of God, becauſe that the Monarchie of Chriſt was ſhortly after to take place. All Iudaea beſides, and the bordering countreyes were annexed vnto the Empire of Rome, ſo that the firſt taxing where Chriſt alſo was to be taxed, then firſte beganne, and Bethleem likewiſe layde before theyr eyes, howe that which of olde was prophecied of her, was then fulfilled.

But Hypatius being betrayed of his owne ſouldiers, taken aliue, and ranſomed with a greate ſumme of money: Cyrillus made expedition agayuſt him, fought a daū
                        gerous and a doubtfull fielde, ſo that many beganne to flee. Agayne when Cyrillus by purſuing after the enemy &amp; calling agayne his owne ſouldiers ſeemed to haue the vpper hand, Vitalianus turned him vnto Cyrill and as the ſouldiers recoyled of ſpite, he tooke him in Odyſſus. Laſt of all be inuaded the wholl cuntrey vnto Sycae, deſtroying with ſword and conſuming with fire all that lay in his way, purpoſing fully to take Conſtantinople and to be crowned Emperour. As he pitched his campe in Sycae, Marinus Syrus
                         (mentioned before) went from the Emperour with a great nauy to geue him battaill. Wherefore whē theyr armies came nigh together the ones front was towards Sycae, the others towards Conſtantinople. Firſt &amp; that for a while they ſturre not, next they ſkirmiſh and floriſh vpon the water no otherwiſe then daliaunce, In the ende they cloſe theyr nauies &amp; fought a ſore battaill about Bytharia where Vitalianus hauing loſt the greater parte of his power was altogether diſcouraged, and tooke his flight. Away went his ſouldiers with all ſpeede ſo that the day after there coulde not one of the ſouldiers be ſeene either paſſing ouer the ſeaes, or wandering about the city. The reporte goeth that Vitalianus abode a while in Anchialus and there liued quietly. Furthermore an other ſorte of Barbarians, who likewiſe liued abroade cut ouer the ſeae and inuaded Pylas a city in Cappadocia. About the ſame time Rhodos on a certaine night now the third time was ſhaken with a wonderfull great earthquake and in manner all ouerthrowen.

Not long after Anaſtaſius died.
                     
                     ABout that time there was among the citizens of Conſtantinople a ſore tumult and ſediciō, becauſe the Emperour had added vnto theyr Triſagium, who was crucified for our ſakes, as if the interlacinge of that clauſe had bene an ouerthrowe vnto Chriſtian religion. The

captayne and ringeleader of this hurlyburly was Macedonius with the Prieſts of his dioceſſe, as Seuerus wryting vnto Sotericus doth remember. This Seuerus was not then made prieſt, but liued in the Emperours pallace being not expulſed his monaſtery with the reſte as I ſayde before. I take that Macedonius was baniſhed not onely for the crimes he was falſely charged withall, but alſo for this preſent ſedition.

                        Of Zozimas and Iohn Chuzubites who were famous about that time for theyr life and miracles.
                     
                     SEing we haue remembred the aforeſayde calamities nowe we thinke beſte to annexe therevnto certaine other things worthy of memory, credibly reported vnto vs by ſuch as ſawe thē with theyr eyes. One Zoſimas a Phoenician borne in Sinda a village vpon the ſeae coaſte of Phoenicia not twenty furlōgs of Tyrus, leading a monaſtical life, had y• grace of God ſo abundantly beſtowed vpō him partly by abſtinence from meates &amp; partly by receauing of them, wt other vertuous and godly liuing, that he not only foreſawe things to come but was voyd of all perturbation. When by chaunce he was in companye at Caeſarea in Palaeſtina with a noble Senatour and wiſe man by name Arceſilaus, one that was of greate honor and renowne, euen in that very momente when Antioch fell, vpon a ſuddayne he beganne to mourne &amp; to lamente, to fet ſobs and ſighes frō the hart roote: he ſhed teares ſo infinitly that the earth was moyſtened therewith: next he called for a ſenſar and filled the quire where they ſate with the ſauor of the inſence: he fell grouelinge vpon the ground ſeeking to pacifie the wrath of God with earneſt and zealous prayer. Arceſilaus ſeing him in this takinge ſayd vnto him, what is the matter y• makes you ſo much out of quiet? Oh (ſayth he) the ratling ſound of Antioch falling to ruyne hath nowe perſed mine eares. Arceſilaus wt as many as were preſent hearinge this were amazed, wrote the houre he ſpake it and ſounde it to be true as Zoſimas told them. There are many other ſtraunge thinges wroughte by him, but the greater parte of them I will paſſe ouer with ſilence (for they can hardly be numbred) and ſome I will lay downe for the knowledge of y• poſterity. At y• very ſame time whē 
                        Zoſimas floriſhed, there liued one with Zoſimas of equall vertue &amp; renowne by name Iohn of Chuzica laura, (a place in the further vale vpon the northſide of the high way which goeth ſtraight from Ieruſalem to Iericho) one that led a monaſtical life ſeuered from all worldly affaires and gouerned the Byſhopricke of the aforeſayd Caeſarea. This Iohn Chuzubites hearinge that the wife of Arceſilaus (ſpoken of before) had one of her eyes ſtrucke out with a weauers ſhittell wherewith he throweth yarne into the web, came immediatly vnto her for to ſee y• wound, when he eſpied y• the apple of y• eye was fallē &amp; quite remoued out of his ſeate, he called to one of the Phiſicions then preſent for a ſponge, bad him put in the fallen eye agayne as well as he could and to tye the ſponge that was layd thereto. Arceſilaus was not thē at home, for he was with Zoſimas in his monaſtery ſtanding in Sinda at the furtheſt fiue hundred furlongs from Caeſarea. There went meſſage in all the haſt to Arceſilaus to certifie him thereof, as the meſſenger came Arceſilaus ſate with Zoſimas, and ſpente the time in communication. Hearing of the circumſtance he beganne to lament, to pull the heare of his heade and

throw it into the aer. As Zoſimas demaunded of him the cauſe of his heauynes, Arceſilaus with many a ſobb and ſheding of many teares told him the wholl. Immediatly Zoſimas left him, gott alone with ſpeede into his chamber, where (as it is lawefull for ſuche kinde of men) he called vnto God very familiarly. In a litle while after, he came forth vnto Arceſilaus, pleaſauntly diſpoſed with a modeſt kind of laughter ſaying: get thee home merely, go on thy way, the gift is geuen vnto Chuzubites, thy wife is healed, ſhe hathe both her eyes wholl, that misfortune coulde not ſticke by her ſeing it ſo pleaſed Chuzubites. Both which miracles were wroughte at one time by theſe two iuſt men. Moreouer as Zoſimas on a certaine time tooke his iourney towardes Caeſarea driuing before him an aſſe wt a fardell of neceſſaries vpō his backe, there met him a lion, which tooke frō 
                        Zoſimas his aſſe &amp; went his way. Zoſimas purſued after the lion through y• middeſt of y• thicket, ſo long vntil the lion had eaten his fill of the aſſes carkaſſe and beholdinge him with a cheerefull and ſmilinge countenance he ſayde: O friend thou haſt nowe hindered my iourney for alltogether, I am heauy &amp; olde, not able to beare the burthen layd vpon the aſſes backe. Wherefore come thy ways contrary to thine owne nature, for of neceſſity thou muſte beare me this burthen, if thou wilt haue Zoſimas to go hence: yet afterwardes thou ſhalt returne againe vnto thine olde fierce &amp; ſauadge nature. Thē the lion laing aſide his rage and fury beganne to faune and very gently to come vnto Zoſimas profering him his ſeruice. Zoſimas layde the aſſes burthen vpon the lions backe and led him vnto the gates of Caeſarea, to the ende he might declare the power and might of God, and that all thinges were for the vſe and ſeruice of man, ſo long as we behaued our ſelues after his will and abuſed not the grace and gift he hath beſtowed vpon vs. But leſt I ſeeme ouer tedious in rehearſinge of theſe thinges, I will returne where I lefte.

About the ſame time Edeſſa that noble &amp; bleſſed citie of the Oſroenians was ouerflowen with the ſtreames of the riuer Scirtus which ſlided by, in ſo muche that many houſes were caried away with the violence there of and infinite multitudes of men were drowned with the water.

                     WHen Iuſtinus had raigned eight yeares, nine moneths and three dayes he called Iuſtinianus his ſiſters ſonne to be his fellowe Emperour, and proclaimed him the firſte dayIuſtinus died An.

For Anthimus was Biſhop of Conſtantinople and Theodoſius of Alexandria who both maintained that in Chriſt there was one nature.

                     EVen as Iuſtinianus was a great fauorer of the Chalcedon councell and the decrees thereof:Theodora

                           nhereticke. ſo his wife Theodora held with ſuch as affirmed that in Chriſt there was one nature. Whether they were throughly of this opinion (for when the faith is called into controuerſie, We

ſee that the father is agaynſte the ſonne, and the ſonne againſte the father, the wife agaynſte her huſbande, and the huſbande agaynſte his wife) or of ſette purpoſe had couenaunted amonge them ſelues, that he ſhoulde defende ſuche as ſayde there were two natures in Chriſt our God after the vnitinge of the diuinity and humanity: and that ſhe ſhoulde holde with the maintayners of one nature, ſure I am of this that the one woulde not yelde vnto the other. For he was very earneſt in defence of the Chalcedon councell: and ſhe of the other ſide was verye carefull for the Patrons of one nature, in ſo much that ſhe louinglye and friendly entertayned her owne faction, ſpecially her owne cuntrey men: if they were ſtraungers ſhe ſent them preſentes and giftes, nay ſhe perſwaded Iuſtinianus to call home Seuerus from exile.

                        Seuerus the hereticke corrupted Anthimus Byſhoppe of Constantinople and Theodoſius Byſhop of Alexandria, but the Emperour depoſed them and placed other in theyr rowmes.
                     
                     THere are extant Epiſtles which Seuerus wrote vnto Iustinianus the Emperour and Theodora his wife, where we may learne howe that at the firſte when he fled from the Byſhopricke of Antioch, he went not ſtraight to Conſtantinople, but in a good while after: that beinge at Conſtantinople he conferred with Anthimus, found him of his owne opinion and perſwaded him to leaue his Byſhopricke. He wrote of the ſame matter vnto Theodoſius Byſhop of Alexandria where he glorieth that (as I ſayd before) he had perſwaded Anthimus to make more accompt of that opinion then of worldly honor and Biſhoplicke dignity. There are moreouer to be ſeene toutching that matter, the Epiſtles of Anthimus vnto Theodoſius, and of Theodoſius againe vnto Seuerus and Anthimus, all which I purpoſely doe omitte leſt I ſeeme to ſtuffe this preſent volume with toe many ſuch allegations, leauinge them for ſuche as are deſirous to ſifte them out them ſelues. Bothe theſe Byſhops when they had withſtoode the Emperours edictes, and reiected the canons of the Chalcedon councell were depoſed of theyr Byſhoprickes: in the ſeae of Alexandria, Zoilus
                         did ſucceede, and Epiphanius in the Byſhopricke of Conſtantinople, to the end from thence forth the councell of Chalcedon mighte openly be preached in all Churches, and that none durſt be ſo bold as to accurſe it, and if any were found of the contrary opinion they were by all meanes poſſible to be perſwaded. For Iustinianus publiſhed an edicte where he accurſed bothe Seuerus and as many as helde with him, and enioyned greate penalties, for ſuch as maintayned theyr opinion, to this ends that from that tyme for the there mighte no diſſention take roote in any of all the Churches throughout the worlde, but that the Patriarchs of euery prouince mighte hold together, and the Byſhops of euery city obey theyr Archebyſhops, and that the foure councells, the firſte helde at Nice, the councell of Conſtantinople, the firſte helde at Epheſus and the councell of Chalcedon ſhoulde be preached in the Churches. There was a fifte councell ſummoned by the commaundemente of Iuſtinian, whereof what ſhall ſeeme conuenient I will declare when occaſion ſhall ſerue. In the meane ſpace we haue ſeuerally to diſcourſe of the worthy actes done about thoſe tymes.

But when he coulde by no meanes bring his purpoſe about, Proclus one that was alwayes conuerſante with Iustinian, and by office his Quaeſtor, was the cauſe that there roſe greater enmytye betwene the Romaynes and Perſians then euer was before. Furthermore the ſayde Procopius diſcourſeth at large of the Romayne and Perſian affayres, of the bloodye battaills that were betwene them, when Beliſſarius was captayne of the Eaſterne power. And firſte he reporteth howe the Romaynes had the victorye at Daras and Niſibis, what tyme Beliſſarius and Hermogenes were chiefe ouer the Romayne Armyes. Vnto theſe he annexeth the ſtate of Armenia and the miſchiefe whiche

                        Alamundarus captaine of the Barbarians called Scenetae, wrought in the borders of the Romane Empire, how he tooke Timoſtratus the brother of Ruſſinus aliue together with his ſoldtours, and afterwardes tooke for them a great raunſome, and let them goe.

                        Of Alamundarus and Azerethus, and the ſedition at Conſtantinople, where the people had this watchword Nica, that is, ouercome.
                     
                     THe aforeſaid author handleth very learnedly, how Alamundarus (ſpoken of before) and Azerethus inuaded the marches of the Romaine dominions: how as they returned into their countrey, Beliſſarius was compelled of his armie to ioyne with them a litle before Eaſter day, beſide Euphrates: how the Romaine power, for not following Beliſſarius counſell, was vtterly foyled, and how Ruſſinus and Hermogenes concluded a perpetuall league with the Perſians, ſo that he moueth the reader very much. Immediatly he entreateth of the popular ſedition raiſed at Conſtantinople, called Nica, by interpretation ouercome. For that was the watchword which they had choſen to diſcerne and know their friend from their foe. In which inſurrection Hypatius and Pompeius were of the people conſtrained to rebell, yet after the rebelles were ouercome, Iuſtiman commaunded they two ſhould be beheaded and throwne into the ſea. Procopius wryteth, that in that ſkirmiſh there were ſtaine thirtie thouſand perſons.

Honorichus the ſucceſſor of Genzerichus in the kingdom, being an Arian hereticke, raiſed great perſecution againſt the Chriſtians which inhabited Libya. For ſuch as maintained the ſound and ſincere faith he compelled to embrace the Arian hereſie, and ſuch as would not yeelde, he burned to aſhes, and executed with ſundrie kindes of lamentable death, pulling out from ſome their tongues: Of which number, after their flight to Conſtatinople, Procopius ſayth, he ſawe certen of them with his owne eyes, and that they ſpake as if they had had no ſuch miſchaunce, and for all their tougues were pluckt vp by the rotes, yet talked they very plaine and diſtinctly, which was very ſtraunge and in maner incredible. Of theſe kinde of people there is mention made inIt may ſeme ſtraūge how men coulde ſpeake vvithout tounges. the Edict of Iuſtinus, two of them (ſayth Procopius), loſt their ſpeach, for immediatly after they went about to talke to women, their voyce was taken from them, and the Martyrs gift remained no longer wyth them.

He ſayeth that Cabaon was gouernour of the Mauruſians, inhabiting about Tripolis. This Cabaon, (I wil vſe the proper wordes of Procopius, who orderly diſcourſed heereof) as ſoone as he perceaued that the Vandals tooke armour againſt him, did as followeth. Firſt, he commaunded all the ſubiectes within his dominions, to refraine from all vnrighteouſnes, to abſtaine from ſuch meates which prouoked to ſenſualitie, and ſpecially to forgoe the companie of women. Next, he made two trenches, pitching in the one his owne tent and pauillion, with all his men: In the other he ſhutte vppe the women, threatning that who ſo euer repaired vnto the womens trench, ſhould die the death. Afterwardes he ſent to Carthage a ſkoutwatch, commaunding that as ſoone as the Vandals made expedition, and proſaned any Chriſtian temple worthy of honour and reuerence, they ſhould marke well what was done, and them ſelues after the Vandals departure, purge and rid away the filth with reuerence of thoſe temples: the report is moreouer, he ſhould ſay that he knew not the God of the Chriſtians, yet that it was very like, if he was ſo mightie as Fame went of him, he would be

reuenged on them that contumeliouſly dealt with him, and that he woulde ayde and aſſiſte his ſer uauntes and ſuch as honored his bleſſed name. The ſkoutwatch comming to Carthage labored to knowe throughely the Vandals expedition. And when the Vandals marched towardes Tripolis the eſpies came draglinge after in beggers weede and baſe attyre.

For they fell a purginge of the temples, they caried out the dunge, they lighted all the tapers, they honored the Prieſts, they behaued themſelues honeſtly, laſt of all they gaue money vnto the poore which ſate about thoſe temples. This beinge done they trudged after the Vandals in all that voyage, as the Vandals continewed in theyr haynous actes, no leſſe did they in theyr humanitye and Godlie deedes. Comminge nighe to Tripolis, the eſpies preuented them, with all ſpeede they tell Cabaon what bothe the Vandals and them ſelues had done as toutchinge the Chriſtians temples, and that the enemye was at hande. Cabaon hearinge this made readye for battaill, in the whiche many of the Vandals were ſlayne, many taken by the enemy, &amp; very fewe returned backe to bringe tidings of the battaill. Thus did the Mauruſians plague Thraſymundus, who after he had raigned ouer the Vandals ſeuen and twentye yeares departedThraſymundus kinge of the Vandals. this life.

Moreouer the ſayd author reporteth certaine thinges toutchinge Cyprian the Martyr whiche neceſſarily muſte be enterlaced in this our hiſtorie, he wryteth thus: All the people of Carthage euery one doe honor the moſte holye martyr Cyprian, and haue dedicated vnto him a worthye temple without the walls of the citye vpon the ſeae shore, and beſides other godlye reuerence, they yearely kepe holy daye in remembrance of him, whiche they call Cypriana. The Mariners called the tempeſt which commonly roſe about the tyme, when the Libyans tooke this to their holyday, Cyprians showers. The Vandals in the tyme of Honorichus tooke by force this Temple from the Chriſtians, thruſte out the Prieſtes very contumeliouſly and thenceforth gaue it vnto the Ariās to enioy as theyr owne. VVhen the Libyans cōceaued no ſmall ſorowe &amp; were in great heauines therefore, the reporte goeth that Cyprian appeared vnto them in their ſleepe and ſayde the Chriſtians ought not to be ſory at all or penſiue therefore: that after a fewe yeares he would be reuenged of them for that iniurie, whiche prophecie tooke place in the tyme of Beliſſarius for the ſame Cyprian and martyr foretold that after the nyntieth and fifteyeare when Carthage was taken and ranſacked of the Vandals, it shoulde be conquered by Beliſſarius the Romayne captaine, the Vandals vtterly foyled, the Arian opinion rooted out of Libya and the Chriſtians reſtored vnto theyr temples.

                        BEliſſarius the valiaunte captaine, after his retourne to Conſtantinople, and the victorye he gotte of the Vandals, ledde about the Citye the ſpoyle and captiues, and Gelimeres him ſelfe captayne of the Vandals: rode aboute Circus in Triumphe with greate pompe and

admiration. Of theſe ſpoyles there were very precious monuments to wit of Genzerichus, who had rifled (as I ſayd before) the palace of Rome, when as Eudoxia wife to Valentinianus Emperour of the Romaines inhabiting the Weſt dominions of the worlde, loſt her husband through the treaſon of Maximinus, was her ſelfe very contumeltouſly defloured, ſente for Genzerichus and promiſed to deliuer the citye into his handes. Then came Genzerichus, ſet Rome on fire and broughte Eudoxia with her daughters into Vandalia. At the ſame time together with other monumentes he tooke away ſuch thinges as Titus the ſonne of Veſpaſian after the winning of Ieruſalem had caried to Rome, that is to ſay ſuch monumēts as Solomon had cōſecrated vnto God, whome he honored greatly. All which Iuſtinianus ſent backe againe to Ieruſalē, for to ſet forth the ſeruice of chriſt our God, and there in verely (as it was very meete) he did God good ſeruice, ſeinge they were conſecrated to him before. Procopius remembreth that then alſo Gelimeres fell proſtrate vpon y• ground before Iuſtinianus the Emperour where he ſate, behelde all that was done and repeated in his mother tongue that diuine ſentence of 
                           Solomon. Vanity of vanities and all is but vanity.

                        PRocopius wryteth of an other thinge worthye the memorye and of greate admiration, whiche was not wrytten before his time. He ſayth that the Mauruſians a Libyan nation were driuen out of Palaeſtina and came to Libya: that theſe were the Gergeſits Iebuſits with other natiōs, whome holy Scripture teſtiſieth to haue bene ouercome by Ioſue the ſonne of Naue: that it may be iuſtified for trueth by the epigramme, he ſawe with his owne eyes engrauen in Phoenician letters, harde by a fonte where there ſtoode two pillours of white ſtone. The wordes were theſe: VVe are they whiche fled from the face of Ioſue the robber, the ſonne of Naue.
                         Thus it came to paſſe, that theſe thinges were forgotten when Libya the ſeconde time was ſubdued of the Romaynes and payed yearely tribute, as in tymes paſte. It is reported that Iustinianus repayred againe a hūored &amp; fifty cities, of whiche number ſome had bene vtterly deſtroyed, ſome other for the moſt parte gone to ruyne: that he ſet them foorthe with ſuch maieſtie, with ſuch ornamentes and with ſuch workemanſhip both of publique and priuate buyldinge, inuironinge them with ſtronge walls and other goodly buylding, wherewith cities are adorned and the diuine Godheade honored in his throne of maieſtye, laſte of all with ſo many conduites partely for profitte and partely for ſhowe, whereof ſome were then firſte erected and ſome other repayred, that nothinge could poſibly be done more excellente. Nowe I come to diſcourſe of the affayres in Italie, whereof ſome parte is artificially handeled by Procopius Rhetor. As ſoone as Theodorichus (mentioned before) tooke Rome, vanquiſhed Odoacer the tyrante, gouerned the Romayne Empire for a while and departed this life: Amalaſuntha his wife gouerned the common weale in ſteede of Astalarichus her ſonne whome Theodorichus begate vpon her, and ſo ruled the Empire with ſuch circumſpection that in her doinges ſhe ſeemed rather a man then a woman. She firſte of all perſwaded Iuſtinianus to be ſo willing to warre with the Gotths, and ſent Embaſſadours vnto him toutching the conſpiracye that was wroughte agaynſte her. But when Astalarichus, being of very tender yeares departed this life: Theodatus the kinſman of Theodorichus obtayned the Weſterne Empire. He at the comminge of Beliſſarius into the Weſte, deliuered vp the crowne for he had more minde to ſtudye then ſkill to wage battaill. At that time alſo 
                           Ʋittiges a valiaunte man was captayne of the Romayne power in the Weſte dominions. Yet we haue to learne by the hiſtorye of Procopius that when Beliſſarius came to Italye, Vittiges
                         lefte Rome: that Beliſſarius came with his armye into the citye of Rome: that the Romaynes opened theyr gates and receaued him moſte willingelye, for Siluerius the Byſhop had broughte this to paſſe and had ſente as toutching that matter Fidelius the Surueior of Astalarichus vnto Beliſſarius.

                         was broken, that Iuſtinianus at the firſte ſente Embaſſadours vnto Choſroes entreatinge him not to breake the perpetuall league that was concluded, neyther to diſſolue that linke of loue and peace that was knit betwene bothe cuntreys, but if there were any raſhe enterpriſe committed or any quarelous occaſion geuen, it mighte friendely and louingely be put vp. That Choſroes of ſpite and malice whiche boyled within his breſte, woulde by no meanes be broughte to any good order, but gathered a greate armye and aſſaulted the marches of the Romayne dominions in the thirteenth yeare of Iuſtinianus raygne. He wryteth moreouer howe that Choſroes tooke Surus a citye vpon the ſhore of Euphrates, who couenantinge with them one way dealte with them an other waye and that moſt leudly, for looke what he promiſed that woulde he neuer performe, he wonne that citye more with falſehoode and ſubtletie then by force of armes. He ſette Beroea on fire, he came with violence againſte Antioch when Euphraemius gouerned the Byſhopricke (but lefte at that tyme the citye becauſe none of the eſpies whiche he had ſente forthe were returned vnto him) whoſe politicke foreſighte as reporte goeth preſerued the Churche and all that belonged thereto. For he adorned her with goodly monumentes hopinge that waye to recouer the violence of the enemye. The ſame author declareth with a vehemente ſtile eaſie to moue any reader, howe the ſayde Choſroes tooke Antioch, deſtroyed all with ſworde and fire, and howe afterwardes he came to Seleucia, then to Daphne the ſuburbes thereof, laſte of all to Apamia, whoſe Churche gouerned Thomas a man very famous bothe for life and for learninge. This Thomas ſticked not to accompany Choſroes vnto the Theater and there beholde the runninge at tilte (for all the canon of the Churche forbad it) to the ende in ſo doinge he mighte vſe all meanes poſſible to mitigate and aſwage his fury. The reporte goeth, when Choſroes demaunded of him, woulde you ſee me in your city? that he anſwered: I ſpeake vnfaynedly and as I beare fayth vnto God, I woulde not gladly ſee you there. Choſroes marueled at his liberty of ſpeache, and reuerenced the man highly as he deſerued for the trueths ſake.

                     SEinge that by diſcourſe of our hiſtorye we are fallen to entreate of this matter, it ſhall not be amiſſe here to remember a certayne miracle worthye the notinge and wroughte at Apamia. As ſoone as the Citizens of Apamia hearde ſaye that Antioch was ſette on fyre, they requeſted Thomas (ſpoken of before) to bringe forthe (althoughe it were contrarye vnto order and cuſtome) the wholſome and liuelye Croſſe and ſette it before them all, to the ende they mighte beholde and embrace it when theyr laſte houre came, for therein the onelye healthe of man conſiſted: and nowe takinge theyr voyage into an other worlde, they myghte haue the reuerende Croſſe for theyr wayefare to ſafeconduyte them into a better ſoyle. Wherefore Thomas did as they requeſted him, and after the limitation of ſome certayne time for the preparation thereof, he brought forth the liuely Tree of the Croſſe that all the neighbours mighte come together and participate of the health that proceeded thereof. Thither wente my parentes together with others and tooke me in theyr▪ hande beinge a childe and then

goinge to ſchoole. After we were licenſed to honor and embrace the reuerende Croſſe, Thomas
                        The curſe of ſinne was by Chriſt take away. This miracle was not by vertue of the croſſe, but b

But as Thomas paſſed from place to place, there followed him a great flame, not of burninge, but of ſhininge fire, in ſo muche that to mens ſeeminge all the place where he ſtoode and ſhewed vnto the people the reuerende croſſe, was inflamed. This was done not once, neyther twiſe, but oftener, when Thomas went about, and the people gatheringe together, requeſted him ſo to doe. Whiche ſight foreſhewed vnto the citizens of Apamia, the health and ſauegarde that was to enſue after. Wherefore there was a picture ſet in the roufe of the Sanctuarie, at the foote whereof this miracle was written for ſuche as were ignorant thereof. This picture was preſerued vntill that Adaarmanus, and the Perſians inuaded that countrey, and burned both Churche and citie. Thus ended all that circumſtance. Choſroes in that voyage of his, hauinge prophaned the holy league, committed at his pleaſure other haynous actes agreeable with his light and vnconſtant behauiour, yet not decent for a man endued with reaſon, muche leſſe fitte for a prince, whiche hath regarde of his worde and promiſe.

                        The expedition of Choſroes made against Edeſſa.
                     
                     FUrthermore the ſame Procopius hath layd downe in writing the thinges whiche of olde were remembred, touchinge Edeſſa and Agbarus, and how Chriſt wrote an Epiſtle vnto Agbarus: Againe how Choſroes made an other inuaſion, and determined to beſiege Edeſſa hoping to diſproue the report and fame that was ſpred farre and nigh of that citie, to wit, that no enemye woulde euer be able to ſubdue Edeſſa. Which thinge is not mentioned at all in the Epiſtle which Chriſte our God wrote vnto Agbarus (as it is to be ſeene in the hiſtorie of Euſebius Pamphilus, where the Epiſtle is layde downe worde by worde) yet it is not onely noyſed, but belieued of the faythfull, and his pretended euent confirmed the report to be true. For when Choſroes went about to take the citie, although he made many an aſſault, and rayſed a wonderfull great contremure, ſo that he might eaſily ſcale the walles of the citie with ſundrie other engines, yet went he away and coulde not preuayle. And howe it ſo fell out I will declare. Choſroes firſt commaunded his ſoldiers to carie thither a great pile of tymber, how ſo euer they were for to beſiege the citie, which was in maner as ſoone done as ſpoken. The tymber beinge framed rounde, and earth heaped in the middeſt, it was ſet right ouer againſt the walles, and rayſed by a litle and a litle with tymber and other fillinge ſtuffe, vntill it came to a great height, that the top thereof was higher then the walles of the citie. From thence they ſhotte at the citie, and at ſuche as hazarded their liues in defence of the walles, the citizens ſeeinge this contremure muche lyke an high mountayne to drawe nigh their citie, and that by all likelyhood the enemy woulde come in a foote, they got them very early and made a ditche ouer againſt their hillocke, threwe fire therein, that the flame might take holde of their timber, and make their contremure euen with the grounde. This beinge done and fire caſt in, it fell not out as they wiſhed, becauſe the fire coulde not breake out, and take into the aer for to conſume the pile of timber. Laſt of all, when as they ſeemed nowe to yeelde, deſpairinge of their ſafety, they bringe forth an Image whiche God himſelfe, and not the handes of man had ſhaped, the whiche Christe had ſent vnto Agbarus, when Agbarus deſired to ſee him. This holy picture they drewe through the ditche they had made, and conueyed in water, of this water they threwe vponAll that we done here referred vnto the p

For immediatly the vndermoſt wood toke fire, &amp; was quickely burned into coales, the flame flaſhed vpwards, and ſet the whole pile on fire. The Edeſſaeans being beſieged, and eſpiinge at length that both ſmoke and flame brake out, deuiſed this ſleight which followeth for to deceaue the enemy. They called for litle flagons, filled them ful of towe, hirds, brimſtone, with other kinde of ſtuffe that eaſily woulde take fire, and threwe them vpon the enemyes pile or contremure. The flagons beinge violently throwen and chafed, yeelded forth ſuche cloudes of ſmoke as darkened altogether the ſmoke and flame that roſe of the enemies pile, ſo that as many as were ignorant of the pollicie thought verilye there was no other ſmoke ſaue that which proceeded from the flagons. But the thirde day after, the flames were eſpied to flaſhe out of the earth, and then the Perſians
                        
which fought on the contremure, perceaued the danger they ſtood in. notwithſtanding al this, Choſroes going about to withſtand the might and power of God, brought the cōduits which were without the walles of the citie, vnto the pile, hoping thereby to quench the fire. But the fire receaued the water as if it had bene oyle, brimſton, or ſome other ſuch like thing, raged out of meaſure, burned all to aſhes, and brought the pile euen with the grounde. In the ende Choſroes deſpairinge altogether of his purpoſe, perceauing what reproche and infamye he had incurred, becauſe he determined to conquer God whom we honor and worſhip, returned home with ſhame inough.

Choſroes made preparation to aſſault this city alſo, &amp; to beſiege it, being come to the walles, the citizens within, and the enemy without

When theſe things were brought vnto Choſroes, he demaunded of the prieſt and Perſians which were ſent for that purpoſe, whether there were any more left behind? to whom, one whoſe lippes were not acquainted with the trueth, made aunſwere that there remained certen other monuments, which a few citizens concealed. Yet the meſſengers that brought away the treaſure with other iewels had left behind nothing that was gold or ſiluer, but ſome other mettall that was far more precious and conſecrated vnto God, namely the holy reliques of Sergius the valiant martyr of Chriſt, which lay in a long cheſt that was ouerlaid with ſiluer. wherefore Choſroes being perſwaded with the aforeſaid words, let his hoſt go to beſiege the city and to win it. TheVVhen a mā is either pricked in conſcience or otherwiſe fear full; any falſhood will ſeeme true, and a mouſe

                     NOwe I am about to declare a certaine hiſtory which was not penned vnto this day, it is of a certaine peſtilent diſeaſe which plagued mankinde the ſpace of two and fiftie yeares, andAnno Dom.

For it is reported that this contagious diſeaſe lighted vpon Antioch two yeares after the Perſians had taken the citie: in ſome part much like that which Thucydides hath deſcribed, in other reſpects farre vnlike: it beganne in Aethiopia, euen as that whiche Thucydides wrote of, and ſpred it ſelfe afterwardes throughout the whole worlde, neither was there almoſt any one that eſcaped the infection thereof. It raged ſo vehemently in ſome cities that all the inhabicantes thereof were diſpatched: with other townes, it dealt more gently and mildely. Neither began it at any one certen time of the yeare, neither did it ceaſſe and relent after one maner &amp; order: for in ſome places it entred with winter, in ſome other places about the end of the ſpring, in certen countreis about the mids of ſōmer, in cert

And yt which is moſt of al to be marueiled at, if any which inhabited ye infected cities fled into other countreis where ye ſicknes was not, they only were viſited, for al they remoued, hoping y• way to ſaue their liues out of y• contagious into ye clear aer. This calamity during ye terme &amp; compaſſe of theſe yeares, which they call reuolutions, paſſed through both towne and countrey, but the greateſt mortallitie of all fell vpon mankinde, the ſeconde yeare of the reuolution which compriſed

The age of Euagrius when he wrote this hiſtorie. to enterlace this that the conſequentes may agree with the premiſes) while as yet I frequented the ſchooles, was then troubled with an impoſtume or ſwellinge about the priuey members, or ſecret parts of the body. morouer in proceſſe of time when this ſicknes waxed hot, and diſpatched diuerſly, &amp; ſundry kindes of wayes, it fell out to my great griefe &amp; ſorow, that God took from me many of my children, my wife alſo, with diuers of my kinſfolkes, whereof ſome dwelled in the city, &amp; ſome in the countrey. ſuch were my aduentures, and ſuche were the calamities which the courſe of thoſe lamentable times diſtributed vnto me. When I wrote this I was eight and fifty yeare olde. Not two yeares before, this ſickeneſſe had bene foure times in Antioch, and when as at length the fourth reuolution and compaſſe was paſt, beſides my aforeſaide children God tooke awaye from me a daughter and a nephewe of mine. This diſeaſe was a compounde, and mixt with many other maladies. It tooke ſome men firſt in the head, made their eyes as red as blood, and puft vp their cheekes: afterwardes it fell into their throte, and whome ſo euer it tooke it diſpatched him out of the way. It beganne in ſome with a flixe, and voydinge of all that was within them, in ſome other with ſwellinge about the ſecret parts of the bodye, and thereof roſe burninge feuers, ſo that they died thereof, within two or three dayes at the furtheſt, in ſuche ſort and of ſo perfect a remembrance, as if they had not bene ſicke at all. Others died mad, and carbuncles that roſe of the fleſhe killed many. It fell out oftentimes that they whiche had this diſeaſe and eſcaped the firſte, and the ſeconde time, dyed thereof afterwardes. The order and manner that men came by this diſeaſe was ſo dyuerſe that it can not wyth penne be expreſſed. Some had it by keeping of company and lyinge together: ſome other onely by touchinge, and frequenting the infected houſes: ſome againe tooke it in the market. Manye of them whiche fledde out of the contagious cities, and were not viſited them ſelues, infected where they came. Others whiche kept companye with the ſicke, and toutched not onely the ſicke but the dead alſo, were not ſicke at all. Others ſome who gladly would haue dyed for the ſorowe they conceaued, becauſe their children and deare friends were departed, and therefore thruſt them ſelues among the ſicke, coulde not haue their willes, the ſickeneſſe did as it were flie away from them. This peſtilent diſeaſe as I ſaid before, raigned throughout the whole worlde the ſpace of two and fiftye yeares, and exceeded all the diſeaſes that euer had beene before. Philoſtratus wondred at the plague which was in his time, becauſe it continewed fifteene yeares. But the things that are to come, are vncertaine and vnknowen vnto men, and they ſhoot at the end which God hath appointed, who knoweth both their cauſes, and what ſhall become of them. Now let vs returne where we left, and proſecute the reſt of Iuſtinianus raigne.

He depriued manye, nay an innumerable ſort of people which enioyed great poſſeſſions, vpon falſe and fained cauſes of all that they had. If any harlot bore minde vnto any mans wealth, and fained that ſhe had had company and familiarity with him, immediatly all that belonged to law and iuſtice (ſo that ſhe made Iuſtinianus partaker of her ſhamefull booty) was of no force, and all his goodes whome ſhe had falſely accuſed was brought into her houſe. Furthermore he was ſo liberall and bountiful that he builded many holy &amp; gorgeous Churches, that he erected manye other houſes, where both men and women, old and yong, and ſuche as were viſited with ſundry diſeaſes, might be diligently looked vnto, and to bring theſe things about, he layd aſide great ſummes of money. he wrought many other good deeds, no doubt very holy, and acceptable vnto God, if that either he, or others whoſoeuer that bringe ſuch thinges to paſſe, cauſed or doe procure them to be done of their owne proper goods, and offered vnto God for ſacrifice their liues and conuerſation voyd of ſpot and blemiſh.

It pleaſed Iustinian ſo earneſtly to holde with the faction of them whiche were called Praſini, that it was lawfull for them without correction at noonday and in the middeſt of the citie to ſlay their aduerſaries, &amp; not only ſtood in awe of no puniſhment but alſo were thought worthy of great honor, ſo that in the end it fel out y• there were many homicides. It was lawful for them to ruſh into other mens houſes, to ſpoile thē of their proper treaſure, &amp; to ſel men leaſes of their owne liues. And what magiſtrat ſo euer went about to reſtraine thē, he did nought els ſaue heape coales on his owne head. Whereupon a certaine magiſtrate of the Eaſt going about to chaſtiſe theſe rebels, clapped gyues on their feet for to bridle their violence, was led him ſelf through the mids of the city &amp; grieuouſly tormented with fetters.

Hereupon it fel out that ſuch as were of the other faction being driuen to leaue their dwelling places, and could no where be lodged, but were ſhoueled here &amp; there as ſhamefull miſcreants, fell to aſſault trauellers, to rob &amp; to ſteale, &amp; to murther euery one y• met them, vntill it grewe vnto ſuch outragiouſnes y• all places ſounded of vntimely ſlaughter, of ſpoyling &amp; other ſuch like haynous offences. Yet at length ſome good moode was found in him that made him to chaunge his minde, and to execute ſuch kinde of men, ſuffering

the lawe to take place againſt them, whom he permitted afore time to rage throughout the cities like Barbarians and bloud ſuckers. But to diſcourſe of theſe things ſufficiently, time wil not ſerue, neither will my penne be able to paint them accordingly. By theſe few ye may coniecture of the other horrible actes which Iuſtinian committed.

This man led his life in a monaſterie hard by Gaza, although he were in the fleſh, yet bridled he the motions therof, in ſo much that he did many notable myracles. It is thought that he ſhutte vp him ſelfe in a certen caban, and ſince the time he went in for the ſpace of fiftie yeares and more, that he was neuer ſeene of any, neuer tooke ſuſtenance or any other thing on earth. When Euſtochius biſhop of Ieruſalem would not beleue it to be true, but toke it for a fable, he went and digged vp the caban where this holy man had pend him ſelfe, and as report goeth, there roſe out thence fire which almoſt burned ſuch as came thither with him.

                        Of Symeon the Monke, who fained him ſelfe to be a ſoole for Chriſtes ſake.
                     
                     THere was at Emeſa, a man whoſe name was Symeon, who laying aſide all deſire of vaine glory, although he was wiſe in euery reſpect, and repleniſhed with the grace of God, yet ſeemed he vnto ſuch as knew him not, as if he had bene a ſtarke foole. He liued for the moſt part a ſolitarie life, neither did he make any man priuie either when, or what he prayed vnto God, neither at what time he alone faſted or refreſhed nature by taking of ſuſtenance, ſometime when he walked in the open ſtreate or market place, he ſeemed farre from the common trade of liuing, nay, he ſhewed him ſelfe as though he had neither witte nor vnderſtanding. Againe, if hunger draue him into a Tauerne, he would feede vpon pottage, meate and whatſoeuer firſt came to his hand. If in caſe any did him obeyſance, and ſaluted him with the bowing of the head, he woulde ſtraight be angrie, and gette him thence with ſpeede, fearing left the common people would eſpie his vertue. Thus was Symeon wont to doe at his being in the market. Yet there were ſome with whom he made him ſelfe familier, and that vnfainedly. Of which number one had a maide that was rauiſhed and gotten with childe, and being compelled by her maiſter and maiſtreſſe openly to reueale the father and him that plaid ſo leud a part: made anſwere that Symeon had ſecretely layen with her, and that ſhee had conceaued of him, that ſhee would not onely ſweare it to be true, but alſoIt is meare folly, and a dishonor v

Symeon hearing of this, ſayd it was ſo in deede, that he was a man as other men were, and that the fleſh was a fraile thing. When the rumour thereof was noiſed abrode, and Symeon therefore as it was very likely defamed for euer, he gotte him out of ſight, and made them beleeue he was aſhamed. When the houre came that ſhe ſhould be deliuered, as the maner is, ſhe lay in, her labour was ſo grieuous, ſo great, and the paine ſo intollerable, that the poore ſeely wretch was ready to yelde vp the ghoſt, yet was ſhe not ridde of her burthen. Wherefore when Symeon (who of ſette purpoſe came thither) was entreated to pray vnto God for her, his anſwere was: that the woman was not like to be deliuered, before ſhe confeſſed truely who was the father of the childe. When ſhe had ſo done and named them the true father, immediatly the childe came ſpraulling out of her wombe, and truth played the office of the midwife. The ſame Symeon was ſeene on a certen time to goe into an harlots houſe, who ſhutte the doore afterThe ſimplicitie of old time deceaued many a

When ſhee had made this proteſtation, ſhe ſhewed them the fragmentes

whiche remained of Symeons vittailes. Furthermore the ſelfe ſame Symeon a litle before the earthquake which ſhooke in pieces Phoenicia, on the ſea ſhore (at what time Berytus, Biblium, and Tripolis were lamentably turned to the ground) tooke a whip in his hand, and beate many of the pillours which ſtood in yt market place, crying theſe words. Stand faſt, be ſure of your footing, ye are like to daunce shortly. Wherefore becauſe he was wont to doe nothinge vnaduiſedly, they that were then preſent, and behelde the circumſtance, noted diligently what pillours he ouerſkipped without ſtripes, whiche verily not longe after were ouerthrowen with the violence of the earthquake. Many other thinges are remembred to haue bene done by him which require a peculiar volume if they be ſufficiently handled.

                     ABout that time Thomas who had led a very auſtere life in Coeloſyria, came to Antioch, for the reliefe which was yearely geuen thence vnto his monaſtery. This Thomas had bene in times paſt made prieſt in that Church. Anastaſius byſhop of that ſeae, becauſe Thomas had at ſundry times wrought him great diſpleaſure and vexation, boxed this monke about the eares. When they that were then preſent, were ſory to ſee this combat, Thomas ſaide vnto them: that he would take that no more at Anastaſius hands, and that Anaſtaſius would neuer offer it him againe. Both which fell out to be true. For Anaſtaſius within one day after departed this worlde: and Thomas as he went home from Antioch, left this worlde, and poſted to immortall bliſſe, at the hoſpital in the ſuburbes of Daphne, and was buried in the ſepulchre that was prouided for ſtraungers. When they had buried one or two other dead carkaſſes in the ſame ſepulchre with him (God after his death wrought that great miracle) his corps was caſt vpermoſt, &amp; the other carkaſſes were ſeuered and puſhed farre aſunder: the men ſeeing this, had the Sainct in admiration, and reuealed the whole vnto Euphremius.

The mother burſt open the doores, and in ſhe went, ſhe was no ſooner in but ſhe eſpied her child in the middes of the hot burning coales, yet preſerued that the fire toutched him not. The childe being aſked whether he felt not great heate, and howe it came to paſſe that he was not burned to aſhes, made aunſwere ſayinge: A woman clad in purple came very oft vnto me, reached me water to quenche the firie flames which compaſſed my body, laſt of all gaue me meate as oft as I was an hungred. Iustinian hearinge of this, thought good that the boye with his mother

ſhoulde be baptiſed, and that the father which refuſed to become a Chriſtian, ſhoulde be hanged on the gallowes, at a place called Sycae. And ſo an end of that.

                        Euſtochius was Biſhop of Ieruſalem: Iustinianus
                         ſummoned the fift councell vpon ſuch an occaſion as followeth. When the patrons of Origens opinions preuayled in many places, but ſpeciallye at Newe Laura (ſo did they call it) Euſtochius imployed his wholl care and induſtry to the baniſhing of them. He made a voyage into Newe Laura, droue them all out of that coaſte, and in ſo doing, he ſeemed to put to flighte the common plague and deſtruction of them all. They beinge ſcattered abroade into ſundrye cuntreys perſwaded many to embrace theyr opinions. There fauored them Theodorus ſyrnamed Aſcidas, Biſhop of Caeſarea the heade citie in Cappadocia, who was continewally with Iuſtinian, one that was bothe faithfull and neceſſarie. When this Theodorus incenſed the Emperours courte, and pallace againſte Euſtochius makinge relation vnto them as of an haynous and horrible matter: Euſtochius ſente Rufus Abbot of Theodoſius Monaſtery and Conon Abbot of Saba, to Conſtantinople: bothe which partly for theyr vertue and excellency, and partly alſo for the biggeneſſe of theyr Monaſteries, were counted chiefe and principall of the Monkes which inhabited the deſertes. There accompanied them alſo, other religious men, not much inferiour vnto them for worthines. Theſe men as theyr ſpeciall drifte called into controuerſie the opinions of Origen, the behauiour of Euagrius and Didymus. But Theodorus Byſhop of Caeſarea in Cappadocia beinge deſirous to bringe them from that argumente, propoſed the cauſe of Theodorus Biſhop of Mopſoueſtia, Theodoritus
                         and Ibas: neyther did he this without the prouidence of almighty God, who diſpoſed all the circumſtances ſo notably, to the end euery prophane and wicked opinion, of whether ſide ſo euer it were, might be rooted out. Firſt of all when the queſtiō was propounded whether it were lawefull to accurſe the deade or no, Eutychius then preſente, a manEutychius. very well ſeene in holy Scripture, yet none of the famous perſonages, or of great authority, Menas was then aliue, whome he ſucceeded in the biſhopricke, and at that time he ſate to anſwere for the Biſhop of Amaſia: when he perceaued that the councell went not a right, but rather the wrōg way, he tolde them plainely there was nothinge to be doubted in that queſtion, neyther any thing that required deliberation at all. That kinge Ioſias not onely executed the Idol Prieſtes then aliue, but cauſed alſo the tumbes of ſuche as were lately deſeaſed to be digged vp.

My peace (ſaith the Lord Chriſt, who is our true God) I geue vnto you: my peace (ſaith the ſame Lord vnto the whole world) I leaue vnto you: which is no otherwiſe to be taken, then that ſuch as belieue in him should repaire vnto the one, and the onely Church: that they should be at vnity among them ſelues, in the true and ſincere faith of Chriſt, and deteſt from the hearte root ſuch as gaineſay, or vphold the contrary opinion. The chiefeſt point that appertaineth vnto mans ſaluation, is the free acknowledging, &amp; proteſting of the true faith. VVherefore as we are commaunded by the Euangeliſts, and as the ſacred creed, to wit, the doctrine of the holy fathers hath taught vs, we exhort al mē to embrace the one &amp; the only church &amp; diſcipline, belieuing in the father, &amp; in the ſonne, &amp; in the holy ghoſt: glorifying the coeſſētiall trinitie, the on godhead, to wit, nature and ſubſtance, one both in word and deed, one might, power, and autoritie in the three perſons, in whome we were baptized, in whome we belieue, and by whome we are coupled together in one.

                        of her: that he is equall to the father, &amp; to the holy ghoſt. For the bleſſed trinity alloweth not of any fourth perſon, as if God the word incarnat were ſo, who is one perſō of the trinity, one &amp; the ſame our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, of one ſubſtance with the father according vnto his diuinity, of one ſubſtance with vs according vnto his humanity, patible as toutchinge the fleshe, but impatible toutching the godhead we ſay not that God the worde which wrought miracles was one &amp; he which ſuffred was another: but confeſſe that the one &amp; the ſame our Lord Ieſus chriſt the word
                        Chriſt willingly ſuffred death for the ſaluation of mankinde. 
                        of God was incarnat &amp; truely made man, that both the miracles he wrought, &amp; the afflictiōs he voluntarily endured in the fleſh for our ſaluation, appertained vnto one &amp; the ſelfe ſame perſon. For it was no man that gaue him ſelf for vs, but it was euen very God the worde, who was made man without alteration of the godhead, &amp; of his owne accord both ſuffred &amp; died for vs. wherfore in acknowledging that he is God, we ſay not but that he is man, &amp; in cōfeſſing his māhood, we deny not his godhead. Againe while we affirme that the one our Lord Ieſus Chriſt conſiſteth of both the natures, diuinity &amp; humanity, we confound not the perſons in the vnity. for al he was made man accordinge vnto our nature, yet is he God notwithſtandinge: neither becauſe he is God after his owne nature, and hath a likenes not capable of our ſimilitude, doth he ceaſſe to be man, but contineweth as God in humanity, ſo no leſſe man, in the excellency of diuinity. Therefore both the aforeſaid is in one, and the ſame one, is both God and man, who is Emmanuel. Further when we graunt that the ſame one is both perfect God and perfect man, of whiche two things he conſiſteth, we ſeuere not the coniunctiō &amp; vnity of his perſon, but declare the differēce of the natures which is not taken away for all the coupling and knittinge together of them, for neither is the diuine nature chaunged into the humane, neither the humane conuerted into the diuine nature: but becauſe both of them is better vnderſtood, and ſooner appeareth in the perfect deſcription, &amp; order of the proper natures. Therefore ſay we that the confunction was made in the perſon. The coniunction which is in the perſon, sheweth that God the word, to wit, one of the three perſons in diuinity, was coupled not to mā, that was before, but in the wombe of Marie, our Lady, the holy &amp; glorious mother of God, &amp; perpetuall virgine, &amp; framed vnto him ſelf of her in his proper perſon, a body of one ſubſtance with ours, ſubiect to like affections with vs (ſinne onely excepted) and endued with a reaſonable ſoule and vnderſtanding▪ he had a being of him ſelfe, and was made man, and is one and the ſame our Lord Ieſus Chriſte of equall glory with the father &amp; the holy ghoſt, And while we imagine or conceaue his vnſpeakable copulation, we acknowledge vnfainedly that the one nature of God the worde was incarnat, and tooke flesh endued with a reaſonable &amp; intellectuall ſoule. Againe when we thinke vpon the differēce of natures, we affirme there are two natures &amp; yet deuide them not at al, for both the natures are in him, &amp; therefore we confeſſe one &amp; the ſame Chriſt, one ſonne, one perſon, or one proprietie of the diuine eſſence, both God &amp; man▪ wherefore as many as held contrary opinions vnto this, or preſently doe belieue otherwiſe, we pronounce thē to be held for accurſed, &amp; iudge thē to be farre eſtraunged frō the holy, catholick, &amp; apoſtolick church of God. And ſeeing the true &amp; ſincere doctrine deliuered vnto vs by the holy fathers, hath pearced our eares, and is now as it were imprinted in our breſts, we exhort you all, nay rather we beſeech you, in the bowels of Chriſt Ieſu to become one fold, to be of one &amp; the ſame catholick &amp; apoſtolick church. for we think it no impairing of our honor for all we are clad in this purple robe, and crowned with the Emperiall ſcepter, to vſe ſuch phraſes for the concord &amp; vnity of al chriſtiā congregations, to thend al with one voice may ſound out the praiſe &amp; glory of almighty God, and our ſauiour Ieſus Chriſt, that none henceforth contend about any queſtiō, or reaſon of the perſons of the trinity, or of any ſyllable compriſed therin, in ſo much as the ſyllables doe lead vs vnto one ſincere faith &amp; opinion, &amp; that one cuſtome, &amp; order in the holy, catholick, &amp; Apoſtolick Church of God, hath hitherto firmly bene retained without chaunge or alteration, &amp; is like hereafter to continue alwayes. Although al agreed vnto this Edict, &amp; confeſſed the ſame to be no otherwiſe then y• true faith did lead them vnto: yet the members of the Church which varied in opinion, were not reconciled, becauſe the Edict ſignified in plaine words, that the churches from the beginning had retained one cuſtome without chaunge or alteration vnto that time, and that there was hope they woulde ſo continue vnto the ende.

                        Of Gregorius who ſucceeded Anaſtaſius in the ſeae of Antioch.
                     
                     
                        GRegorius after the depriuation of Anaſtaſius, was preferred to the holye Byſhopricke of Antioch, a man of great fame for his gift in poetrie. He led a monaſticall life of a childe, behaued him ſelfe therein ſo vprightly, and ſo ſtoutly, that he was no ſooner come to mans eſtate, but he attained vnto the higheſt and moſt perfecte degree, and was made gouernour of the monaſterye in Conſtantinople, where he led a poore and an auſtere life. After that againe by the commaundement of Iuſtinus, he was appointed chiefe of the monaſterye in mount Sina, where he ſtood in great perill, by reaſon the Barbariās Scenetae, a nation of Arabia beſieged that place. And whē as by his meanes peace was there concluded, he was called from thence to be a Byſhop. He was a man that excelled and paſſed others, both for wiſedome and vertue, what thinge ſo euer he tooke in hand, that would he doe with great diligence, and as no feare could diſmay him, ſo coulde no other means allure him to contrary his owne ſaying, no not the threats &amp; autority of the higher power▪ furthermore he was wont to diſtribut ſuch large ſumms of money (his liberality, &amp; bountifulnes extended vnto euery man) that whither ſo euer he went, a marueilous great multitude beſides his ordinarie traine followed after him, &amp; they that either heard or ſawe, he would go to any place, came flocking after. this one thing againe may be added as a ſecond ornament vnto his dignity &amp; calling, that the people were oftentimes very deſirous of them ſelues, either to beholde his goodly perſon, or to heare the notable grace he had of vtterance and pronunciation, he was of all others the man yt ſooneſt could bringe men in loue with him, reaſoned they with him of what matter ſo euer they would, he had an amiable &amp; a gracious face, his talke very gētle &amp; pleaſant. And as he was quick witted to perceaue any matter, were it neuer ſo profound, ſo paſſed he in wiſe counſel &amp; graue iudgement, belonged it either to him ſelfe or to others. And thereof it came to paſſe y• he compaſſed ſo many noble acts, he was the man y• would poſt ouer no buſines vnto the next day. he made not onely y• emperours of Rome, but alſo y• kings of Perſia to haue him in great admiratiō becauſe he knewe howe to vſe all men, as both neceſſity conſtrained, &amp; occaſion which he neuer omitted did require. euery his rare &amp; ſinguler acts can teſtifie this which I ſay to be no leſſe then true. He was very ſeuere &amp; ſometimes angry, againe ſomwhat, nay very gentle and meeke, yt the witty ſaying of Gregorie the diuine was liuely expreſſed in him, to wit, the ſeuerity was ſo tempered with ſhamefaſtnes yt nothinge coulde take hurt by reaſon of either of them, but both, becauſe both were iointly linked together, purchaſed great commendation.

                        How the nation called Perſarmeni being perſecuted of the Perſians for their faith in Christ, yeelded them ſelues vnto the Empire of Rome.
                     
                     IN the firſt yeare that Gregory was biſhop, the nation inhabiting the greater Armenia, of olde ſo called, but afterwards Perſarmenia, which ſometime was vnder the Romaines, &amp; deliuered by Philip the ſucceſſor of Gordianus vnto Sapor, &amp; as Armenia y• leſſe was ſubiect vnto y• Empire of Rome, ſo all the reſt was held of the Perſians, the nation I ſay inhabiting Armenia y• great, profeſſing y• chriſtian faith, were grieuouſly afflicted by y• Perſians, &amp; ſpecially for their religion &amp; conſcience. Wherefore they ſent Embaſſadours ſecretly vnto Iustinus, requeſtinge they might become ſubiectes vnto the Empire of Rome, that thenceforth they might freely ſerue God without let or hinderance. When Iuſtinus had entertained &amp; accepted of the embaſſie, when certen articles were explicated in the letters he ſent backe vnto thē, &amp; when the league was ſolemnely concluded, yt

                        Rome. Not onely they, but the borderinge countrey inhabited partly of that nation, and partly of forainers (whoſe captaine was 
                           Ʋardan, one both for his noble parentage, and proweſſe in martiall affaires, was honored of them for their prince) offered their ſeruice and loyaltie vnto the Emperiall ſcepter. When Choſroes king of Perſia charged the Emperour with theſe iniurious dealinges, Iustinus put him of with this aunſwere, ſayinge: that the date of the league was expired, and the dayes out, that it was not for the profeſſors of the Chriſtian fayth, to leaue ſuccourleſſe ſuche Chriſtians as fledde vnto them for ayde in time of warres, but to relieue and cheriſhe them. For all that Iustinus gaue Choſroes this aunſwere, yet made he no preparation for battaile, but wallowed him ſelfe in his wonted ſenſualitie, and preferred pleaſure before all.

                     IN the meane while he ſent captaine Martianus his kinſman into the Eaſt, not furniſhing him with ſoldiers and armour, and other neceſſarie prouiſion to giue the enemy battaile: ſo that he came into Meſopotamia, not without plaine daunger and wrecke to the ſtate, hauing with him a fewe naked ſoldiers, of which number ſome were tributarie dichers and carters. He gaue certaine Perſians a very ſclender battaile (God wot) about Niſibis, while as yet the other Perſians were not in armour, and by chaunce getting the vpper hand, he beſieged the citie. But the Perſians thought good not to ſhut their gates at al, they reuiled very contumeliouſly the Romaine hoſt, they made no accompt of them, as if they had there beene ſet to keepe ſheepe. For all this there were manye ſtraunge monſters ſeene about that time, whiche prognoſticated the calamities that were ſhortly to enſue, and amonge others a calfe newly calued, was ſeene to haue two heades, yet but one necke.

                        Howe Choſroes when he had ſent captaine Adaarmanes against the Romaines who vexed them aboue all meaſure, went him ſelfe to Niſibis.
                     
                     
                        CHoſroes being now furniſhed to battaile, brought Adaarmanes on his way as farre as the other ſide of Euphrates, which was with in his owne dominions, ſent him with an armie into the marches of the Empire of Rome, and commaunded him to breake into the towne Circeſium, Circeſium is a town very conunodious for the Romaines, ſituated in the furtheſt parts of the Romaine dominions, not onely fortified with ſtrong walles, raiſed vp to a marueilous great height, but alſo inuironed with two riuers, Euphrates and Aboras, and become by reaſon of them as it were an Iſle. Then he him ſelf went with his power ouer the riuer Tigris, &amp; got him ſtraight to Niſibis. But the Romaines of a longe time vnderſtoode not of theſe voyages, and Iuſtinus was made a foole. For he belieued a flimflame reporte that was blaſed abrode, howe Choſroes was either dead, or at the point of death. They ſay againe that he was ſore diſpleaſed, becauſe the ſiege of Niſibis was lingered, and that he ſent certaine men for to egge Martianus forwardes, and with all ſpeede to bring him the keyes of the citie. When their affaires tooke no proſperous ſucceſſe, but Iuſtinus bore away greate ſhame and reproche, becauſe he woulde ſeeme to attempt that which was vnpoſſible for him to doe, that is to beſiege ſo great and ſo wide a citie, ſpecially with ſo ſimple an armie: firſte of all Gregorie Byſhop of Antioch, was certified of the whole. For the Byſhop of Niſibis was his deare friende, and liberally rewarded of him, and therefore beinge very ſory that the Chriſtians ſuſtained ſuch loſſes, and ſuch vexations of the Perſians, beinge alſo deſirous that the citie whereof he was Byſhop, were part of the Romaine dominions, ſignified vnto him all that was done about Niſibus, without the boundes of the Empire of Rome. Gregorius
                         wrote immediatly of theſe tidings vnto Iustinus, and tolde him with all ſpeede how Choſroes inuaded the countreis. But he wallowinge ſtill in the filth of his wonted voluptuouſnes, neyther gaue eare vnto Gregories letters, neyther belieued them, thought that onely to be true, which his owne ſicke braine had conceaued. For he immitated the maner of intemperate and riotous perſons, who as they are lither and recheleſſe, ſo they build toe much vpon proſperous ſucceſſe and fortune, and

if any thing happen contrary to their minde, they will in no wiſe be brought to beleeue it for true. Wherfore he wrote backe again vnto Gregorie, reiecting his letters for falſe reports. if they were true, that the Perſians ſhould not win the citie and raiſe the ſiege before his power came, or if they won it before, they ſhould be met withall ere they left the cuntrey. Afterwards he ſent Acacius a proud man, of a diſdainefull condition vnto Martianus, with this commaundement, that if Martianus had before put one foote in the Citie and recoyled backe, he ſhould put him beſide his honor and dignitie. The which he did in all the haſt to the great hurt of the common weale, and all for to ſatiſfie the Emperours will. For he went into the Romaine campe and tooke Martianus being out of the Empire, and depriued him of all martiall dignitie, vnknowing vnto the armie. The captaines of the bands &amp; Centurions after their watch was ended, vnderſtanding that their captaine was put out of office, ſhooke of their armour, ſtole away priuely, ſcattered them ſelues here and there in their flight, and left the ſiege to the great laughter of all men. Adaarmanes therefore who had a mightie armie of the Perſians and Barbarians called Scenetae paſſing by Circeſium, deſtroyed all the Romaine Countreis before him with fire, ſword, and euery other ſort of lamentable inuaſion, ſhewed no mercy at all, neither in word, neither in dede. He tooke caſtels &amp; many villages, and no man wt ſtoode him, firſt, becauſe the Romaine hoſt wāted a head or captaine: next for yt 
                        Choſroes had beſet all the ſoldiers about Daras, and therfore the countrey was ouerrun and deſtroyed freely without feare at all. furthermore Choſroes inuaded Antioch by his ſoldiers onely, for he him ſelfe was abſent, who loſt their labour and were driuen backe thence, yea when as very few remained in the Citie, when as alſo the biſhop fledde away, and conueyed with him the holy treaſure of the Church, becauſe that the greater part of the wall lay on the ground, and the people as it falleth out at ſuch times was vp all on rebellion, and when they were gone, the Citie was left deſolate, neither was there any one that deuiſed engines to repell the violence of the aduerſary, or that was diſpoſed to reſiſt the enemie any kinde of way.

                     AFter that the aſſault of Adaarmanes toke no proſperous ſucceſſe at Antioch, and the Citie Heraclea, afterwards called Gagalica, was by him ſet on fire, he made his voyage ſtraight into Apamia, the which Seleucus yt ſonne of Nicanor builded, a citie ſomtime flouriſhing, yet by long tract of time falne to great decay and ruine. And when he had required the citie wyth certen couenants concluded betwene them, it booted not for the citezens to reſiſt, their walls were ſo old that they fell to the groūd, he burned the citie, bereaued them of all their ſubſtance, deſtroyed all, contrary vnto the couenants drawne betwene them, ſubdued not only the citie but the countrey about, went his way &amp; toke wt him not only the biſhop, but alſo the lieuetenant of the citie. Againe in his iourney homewards he wrought great miſchiefe without let or reſiſtāce, a few ſoldiers only excepted, whom Iuſtinus had ſent thither, whoſe captaine was Magnus, maiſter ſometime of the exchaunge at Conſtantinople, and afterwardes by the cōmaundement of Iuſtinus, put in truſt wt one of the Emperors palaces, the which ſoldiers were ſo diſcomfited, yt they fled away &amp; were almoſt taken. Theſe things being brought to this paſſe, Adaarmanes returned vnto Choſroes, who as yet had not taken ye citie which he beſieged. As they ioyned powers together, their armie became very ſtrong, the ſoldiers were animated, and laſt of all, the enemie terrified and altogether diſmaid. He found the citie trenched about, with a great contremure raiſed nigh the wals, all warlicke engins prepared for the winning of the citie, as the great holow catapelts, which ſhoote the dartes from a

Choſroes with theſe helpes wonne the citie by force in the winter ſeaſon, when as Iohn the Maior of the towne toke no thought at all how he might repel the violence of the enemie, nay rather he betraied the citie, for both is reported. Choſroes had beſieged the citie aboue fiue moneths, and in all that while there was not one that withſtode him, laſt of all,The win

                         when he had ranſacked the citie of all that was in it, and ſlaine many after a lamentable ſort, and taken many alſo aliue, he fortified the citie lying very commodiouſly both for him and his ſubiects, and ſo returned home.

For ſhe wrote letters vnto Choſroes, where ſhe lamented the wofull plight her huſband ſtoode in, and the lamentable ſtate of the commō weale wanting a head, that it ſtoode not with his honor to triumph ouer a ſeely widowe, to inſult ouer an Emperour that was ſicke and dedred, and to inuade a common weale that was deſtitute of aide and ſuccour. That he of old being diſeaſed had not onely the like humanitie ſhewed vnto him, but alſo of the beſt Phiſitions ſent vnto him from the Empire of Rome, which might eaſe him of his griefe. Choſroes being perſwaded with theſe circumſtances, although he had determined immediatly to ouerrunne the Romaine dominions, yet confirmed he a league for three yeares ſpace concerning the Eaſt countreys, and decreed withall that Armenia ſhould enioy the like benefite, that no battell ſhould be fought there, and that none throughout the Eaſt countreys ſhould be moleſted at all. While the affaires of the Eaſt ſtoode in this ſort, Sermium was taken of the Barbarians, a Citie of old inhabited of the people Gepaedi, and afterwards by them deliuered vnto Iuſtinus.

This Choſroes behaued him ſelfe ſo inſolently towards the Empire of Rome, that when the Emperour ſent Legates vnto him, he would not once voutchſafe to geue them the hearing, but very diſdainefully bad them follow him to Caeſarea, and that there he would ſitte and heare what they had to ſay. When he ſawe the Romaine hoſt (whoſe captaine was Iuſtinianus the brother of Iuſtinus, that was piteouſly murthered at Alexandria) all in armour comming of the contrary to meete him, the trumpettes ſowne to battaile, the armies ready to ioyne together, the clamour of the ſouldiers pearcing the cloudes in the ſkie, orderly placed in the front in battaile aray, foming out with great furie preſent death. Laſt of all, when he eſpied ſo great and ſo goodly a troupe of horſemen, as none of the Emperours before euer thought of, he was greatly aſtonied, and by reaſon it ſo fell out vnlooked for and vpon a ſodaine, he ſighed heauely and would not geue the firſt onſette. As he deferred the battaile, lingered ſtill, ſpent time idlely, and craftely went about to deceaue them, Curs a Scythian, Captaine of the right wing of the battaile ſet vpon him,Curs a Scythian. and when the Perſians could not withſtand his violence, but quite forſooke the front of the hoſt, Curs made a great ſlaughter of the ennemies. Laſt of all he purſued the ſouldiers at their backs, where the artillarie and preparation of Choſroes, and of his whole armie lay. He tooke all the kings treaſure and Iewelles, all his ordinance for warre, yea when Choſroes both ſawe and ſuffered it, thinking that to be farre better, then that Curs ſhould ſette on him. Curs with his ſouldiers gotte great ſpoyle and ſummes of money, and tooke away their beaſtes loded with fardelles and packes, where alſo the fire lay which Choſroes king of Perſia worſhipped for his God, thus hauingA wiſe God, that could be taken in warres. foiled the Perſian armie, and ſounding a hymne to the praiſe of God, he returned in the Euening about candlelight vnto his companie, who by that time had left the aray they were ſette in. Choſroes in all this while ſtirred not, neither as yet was the battaile begonne, but only light ſkirmiſhes, one while of this ſide, an other while of that ſide, as the maner is. Choſroes ſette a mightie beacon on fire in the night, and purpoſed then to geue the ennemie battaile: the Romaines hauing two armies: he ſet about midnight on that hoſt which lay in campe of the Northſide, they being ſodainly taken and vnprouided, recoyled and gaue backe, he went forwardes, tooke Melitina a

Citie not farre of, that was deſtitute of a garriſon and Citizens to repell his violence, ſette all on fire, and ſought to cutte ouer the riuer Euphrates. When the Romaine armies ioyned together &amp; purſued after him, he fearing him ſelfe, got vp on an Olyphant, and paſſed ouer Euphrates▪
                         but the greater part of his armie in ſwimming and conueying them ſelues ouer, were drowned in the deapth of the water. He vnderſtanding of this miſfortune, got him away with all ſpeede. Wherefore Choſroes in the ende being thus plagued and recompenced for his inſolencie and diſdaine towards the Romaines, returned into the Eaſt with as many as were left him aliue. There the league was of force, that none ſhould aſſault him. Iuſtinianus after all, ouerrunne the marches of the Perſian dominions, continued there all winter long, without let or anoyance.

He would very ſeldome graunt his preſence vnto any, yea and yt toe, whē he were earneſtly beſought vnto, he ſtopped his eares from hearing of idle talke, not wt waxe (as the Poet coūſaileth) but wt wiſdom and reaſon, which was vnto him in ſteede of a key, both to open and to ſhutte them as time and occaſion did require. Ignorance the mother

This Mauricius waging battaile in foraine countreys, tooke both cities and caſtels that lay moſt commodious for the Perſians, and caried thence ſo great a pray, that he filled with the captiues he had brought with him, Iſles, townes and countreys, that lay of a long time deſolate and not inhabited: the land alſo that was vnmanured, he cauſed to be tilled and made arable ſoyle: of theſe men he had to ſerue his tourne great armies, which both valiantly and couragiouſly fought againſt other nations, and laſt of all he ſtored euery familie of ſeruauntes, for then there were captiues great ſtore, and cheape inough.

                        Mauricius foiled both Choſroes and Adaarmanes, which led the Perſian armies.
                     
                     FVrthermore, the ſame Mauricius waged battaile with the head and chiefeſt of all Perſia, namely, Tamochoſroes and Adaarmanes, which ledde great armies to the field. but after what ſort, when, and how proſperouſly his enterpriſes went forwardes, either we geue other men leaue to commit them to letters, or peraduenture we our ſelues (ſeeing that in this preſent volume we haue promiſed to diſcourſe of other matters) will entreat of them in an other ſeuerall worke. yet thus much will I now ſay, that Tamochoſroes was ouerthrowne in the front of the hoſt, not with the fortitude of the Romaine armie, but with the onely pietie of the Captaine, and his faith in God: that Adaarmanes was foyled with plaine force of armes, and after great loſſe of his power put to flight, yea and that not onely when Alamundarus captaine of the Barbarian nation, called Scenetae▪
                         betrayed Mauricius, in that he would not come ouer the riuer Euphrates, and ayde him againſt Scenetae, which fought againſt him (theſe Scenetae are ſo ſwifte on horſebacke, that they can hardly be taken, yea though their paſſage be ſtopt, but when it ſtandes them vpon, they farre outrunne the ennemie) but alſo when Theodorichus Captaine of the Scythians durſt not tarye within their reache, but ſhewed them immediatly a faire paire of heeles together with his ſouldiers.

                     THere were ſignes which went before, and foreſhewed that Mauricius ſhould be crowned Emperour. As he offered frankencenſe very late in the night, within the chauncell of S. Maries Church, which the people of Antioche doe call the temple of Iuſtinian, the curteine or canapie was all ſette on fire, and therewith he fell into ſuch a dumpe, that he feared the viſion exceedingly. Gregorie Biſhop of that Citie ſtanding by, ſayd that without all peraduenture the viſion was ſent from aboue, and foreſhewed the brightneſſe of glory, and the great renowne that was to befall him. Chriſt moreouer appeared towardes the Eaſt, ſeeking vengeaunce on the ennemies. In that viſion alſo was the raigne of Mauricius plainely prognoſticated. for of whom (I pray you) ſought he that, vnleſſe it were of the Emperour, and of ſuch a man as ſerued him in holineſſe? As I ſearched out the truth and certainetie of theſe things, his parentes tolde me other things worthie of memorie and the knowledge of the poſteritie in time to come. His fatherThe dreame of Mauricius father. remembred that what time Mauricius was conceaued, he ſawe in his ſleepe a mightie Vine to burgeine out of his chamber, and that there hunge thereon infinite cluſters of ripe grapes. Hys mother tolde, that when ſhee was deliuered, the earth breathed vppe of her ſelfe a redolent ſauour, that was ſtraunge, and varied it ſelfe by turnes. Alſo that a grieſly ghoſt, commonly called a Goblin or a Hegge, tombled the infant from place to place, as though he would deuoure him,

order of the haule and pallace. all they bare in their handes burninge torches, ſtoode verye maieſtically in the ſight of all men, vpholding the glory of that gorgeous ſpectacle, ſo that there was neuer ſene among men a more excellent, &amp; a more roial ſhew. Plutarchus Chaeroneus (ſaith Damophilus a Romaine hiſtoriographer) ſaid very well, that the puiſance &amp; proſperous ſucceſſe, the fauor &amp; fortune of Rome ioined hands together, but I had rather ſay, that true piety &amp; felicity ſo met together in Mauricius alone, that true piety forced felicity to be preſent, &amp; would in no wiſe ſuffer her to be foyled &amp; ouerthrowen. Theſe things being finiſhed, Mauricius couered not onely his head with the crowne, &amp; clad not onely his body in purple, but alſo his minde with precious ornamēts. for in maner he alone of all the Emperours fell a gouerning of his owne perſon, and ſo became an Emperour in deede: firſt he droue from his minde the popular ſtate of affections, next placinge the order of his peeres and nobilitie in the ſeate of reaſon, he made him ſelfe a liuely paterne of vertue for his ſubiects to immitate and followe after.

For he was of the opinion, that if he vſed litle familiaritie, he might doe what him ſelfe liſted, and that his ſoldiers vnderneath him woulde ſtand in awe of him, and the ſooner obey his commaundement. But comming on a certaine time vnto his armie with high lookes, and hauty diſdaine, with his whole body ſet vpon toe arrogant geſtures, he made them an oration of ſoldiers patience in perill of warres, of fine and picked harneſſe, and laſt of all, of the rewardes they were to reape of the common weale for their trauell and ſeruice: they knowinge of theſe thinges as well as he, beganne openly to reueale their wrath, and conceaued diſpleaſure againſte him, and ruſhinge in thither, where he had pitched his tent, as if they had bene Barbarians, They ſpoyled him of all his ſumptuous ſtore and precious treaſure: not onely this, but without doubt they had alſo diſpatched him, had not he with al ſpeede taken horſe, and fled vnto Edeſſa.

While he refuſed the office, and they vrged it vpon him, there roſe great contention of either ſide, for he would not be conſtrained, and they would needs compell him, they threatned to execute him, vnleſſe he would willingly accept of the dignitie, he of the contrary proteſted openly he was neither affraide, neither woulde yelde one iote. At length they went about to laſh him with whips, &amp; to maime the members of his body: which torments they perſwaded them ſelues verily he would not endure, that there was not in him more hardneſſe to beare away ſtripes, then nature and yeares gaue them to vnderſtande. they tooke him in hand, &amp; knowing well inough what he was able to ſuffer, dealt very circumſpectly, leſt they wounded him ſore, vntil in thend they forced him to condeſcend, and with anoth to promiſe them his faith and fidelitie. Wherfore thus they compelled him whom they had ruled to rule, and whom they had gouerned to gouerne, and whom they led captiue to become their captaine. furthermore they diſplaced all other officers, as captaines, tribuns, centurions, decurions, and placed in their rowmes whom pleaſed them beſt, &amp; reuiled the empire with railing ſpeaches. And though they bore them ſelues towards ſuch as were tributary milder then the common vſe and maner is of Barbarians: yet were they altogether alienated from their companions, &amp; members with them of one common weale. For they tooke not their wayfaring vittailes by weight and meaſure, neither were they pleaſed with ſuche lodginge as was appointed for them, but tooke their owne luſt for lawes, and pleaſure for preſcribed order.

                     THe affaires of the common weale lying at this poynt, Gregorie byſhop of Antioch returned from Conſtantinople, after the ending of a bitter conflict the which I am now about to declare. when Aſterius was lieuetenant of the eaſt, &amp; contention riſen betweene him &amp; Gregory, firſt, all the head citizens tooke part with Aſterius, next the artificers ſtuck vnto him, ſayinge that Gregory had iniuried them euery one, laſt of al it was permitted for the common people al to reuile

Therefore Asterius was depoſed of his Lieuetenantſhip, and Iohn elected to ſucceede him, whom the Emperour charged diligently to examine the circumſtances of that ſeditious controuerſie.

For your fathers and aunceſtors beinge gouerned by Conſuls and Emperours haue through obedience and noble proweſſe, brought the wholl vvorlde ſubiecte vnto them. VVhat shoulde I bringe you in remembrance of Manlius Torquatus who executed his owne ſonne (although heManlius Torquatus. 
                        had done many feates and noble actes) for diſobedience and rebellion? For notable and worthy deedes are moſt commonly wrought by the vviſe counſaill of politicke captaines, and willinge obedience of ſouldiers. But when either of theſe two fayleth, the counſaill halteth, the enterpriſe falleth vnto the ground &amp; hath ilfauored ſucceſſe: and no maruell at all, ſpecially when two thinges which shoulde be linked together are looſed and parted aſunder. Let there be no delay in you (I craue it vpon my knees) yeld vnto me foorthwith, let a Bishop this once pleade &amp; preuaile betwene the Emperour and his armie, let all the worlde vnderſtande that in you there is no ſigne of rebellion, but that you had good cauſe for a time to be diſpleaſed with your captaines which offended you. If it ſo fall out that ye embrace not in time this wholſome counſail, yet will I take vpon me the perſon of loue owed vnto the Empire of Rome and of friendeship and harty good wil borne vnto you, and marke well what I haue to ſaye vnto you. Doe ye ſee what endes tyrantes and rebells moſte commonly haue? Ponder I pray you with your ſelues howe ye can compaſſe ſuche thinges as ye goe about, ſeeinge (in my opinion) it is vnpoſſible, for you to continewe all together. For howe can either the foules of the aer, or fishe vvith other foode whiche the ſeae bringeth to land be tranſported vnto you vnleſſe ye will shed the bloode of Chriſtians in battaill and your ſelues be ſlaine to, which is both a great shame and reproche? And what I pray ye will become of you? Verily you will be ſcattered here and there and conſtrayned to leade miſerable liues, Immediatly after, vengeance will enſue, ſo that ye shall neuer be pardoned. VVherefore geue me your handes and let vs louingly conſult together what shall be expedient for vs our ſelues &amp; for the profit of the commō weale, ſpecially ſeeing we haue the feaſte of our Sauiours paſſion and of Chriſts moſt holy reſurrection as it were in maner aſſiſting and alluringe vs to reconciliation.

When they replied that herein alſo they woulde yelde vnto him, he fell a pacifienge of God with prayers and ſupplications. He diſtributed vnto them the immaculate body of Chriſt, it was vpon maundy thirſday, the number of them was about a two thouſand, he entertayned them all that night, made them couches in the greene graſſe, returned home the next daye after, and decreed they ſhoulde aſſemble together where it pleaſed them. Wherfore he ſent for Philippicus who then abode at Tarſus in Cilicia, that with all ſpeede he ſhould repaire to Conſtantinople. He made the Emperour alſo priuey vnto theſe circumſtances, and layde downe in his letters the requeſtes and demaundes of the armye as concerninge Philippicus. When Philippicus ſhortly after came to

Wherefore vnder colour of the Romaynes the Perſians were broughte in, and tooke the citye, which lay wonderfull commodious for the Romaynes: many women that were in the prime of theyr flouriſhing yeares they kepte within the citie, all others (a fewe ſeruantes onely excepted) they droue out. Immediatly vpon this, Philippicus came thither and beſieged the city. And although he wanted neceſſaries for the ſiege, yet he encountered with them, with ſuch thinges as he had. He caſt vp certaine ditches and ouerthrewe one of theyr turrets, yet coulde not he take the citye, becauſe the Perſians watched all nighte and repayred againe ſuche thinges as were battered to the grounde. When the Romaynes made many an aſſaulte and had the repulſe (for the dartes were ſore diſcharged at them from highe turrettes, and they them ſelues without had more harme, then they coulde worke vnto the enemye within) they rayſed theyr ſiege, remoued a litle of and there pitched theyr campe, takinge diligente heede onelye to this, that no other Perſians ioyned with them that were in the city. Gregorie by the commaundemente of Mauricius the Emperour wente to the campe and perſwaded with them to returne to beſiege the citye. But they coulde not preuaile, becauſe they wanted engines of warre for the winninge of cityes. Therefore the armye was ſente abroade to winter, leauinge manye garriſons in the caſtells about, leaſt the Perſians came on a ſodayne and ſtepte into the city. The next ſommer followinge there was greate power gathered together, and a ſore battaill foughte with the Perſians about Martyropolis. And althoughe Philippicus had the vpper hande in that ſielde and many of the Perſians together with one of theyr captaines ouerthrowen, yet there eſcaped to many of them into Martyropolis, for that was one of theyr principall driftes to be ſure of takinge that citye vpon them. From that tyme the Romaynes deſpayred of winninge the citye by ſiege (it was poſſible that mighte woulde ouercome it) they wente a ſeauen furlonges of and buylt an other citye ouer againſte it vpon the toppe of an hill well fortiſied of it ſelfe, there to inuente engines and to aſſaulte Martyropolis. This they did in ſommer, but in winter they diſſolued the armie.

The Perſians which were left aliue, hauinge loſte all their captaines ranne away and tooke Niſibis vpon them. And becauſe they feared to returne vnto their king (for he had told them they ſhould looſe their heades vnleſſe they broughte theyr captaynes ſafe and ſounde agayne) they fell a conſpiringe againſte Hormisſda: Barames alſo a Perſian captayne who was newly come with his army from the warre againſt the Turckes, perſwaded them to doe no leſſe. In the meane while Comentiolus beſieginge Martyropolis lefte there the greater parte of his power and wente him ſelfe with certaine choſen ſouldiers to take Ocbas, a ſtrong caſtell vpon the further banke ouer againſte Martyropolis lienge vpon a ſteepe rocke, where he might viewe the wholl citye of Martyropolis.

And firſt of all, Sittas the traitor was deliuered vnto him, next y• people of Martyropolis ſtoned him &amp; laſt of all they hanged him on the gallowes. The citye of Daras was alſo geuen vp vnto him, after that the Perſians had priuely ſtolen away, and after that the Romaines alone had foiled Barames in one battaill and he fled awaye alone with greate ignominye, Choſroes was reſtored vnto his kingedome.

But he had not his deſire. This Symeon for his rare giftes and excellente vertues paſſed all the men of his time: he led in a pillour a ſeuere life euen from his tender youth, in ſo muche that he chaunged his teeth in that manſion. He was perſwaded to liue in a pillour vpon ſuche an occaſion as followeth. Beinge of tender yeares, playinge, leapinge and ſkippinge to and fro about the toppes of hilles and greenes as the maner is of children, he lighted by chaunce vpon a Lybard, tooke his girdle and tyed him about the necke, led the beaſte whiche nowe had put of his fierce nature by the girdle as if it had bene a bridle, and broughte him home to his Monaſtery. His mayſter who ledde his life in a pillour ſeeinge this, enquired of him what he had in his girdle, the boye anſwered it was a catte. His mayſter gatheringe hereby, that he woulde proue hereafter a worthye man trayned him vppe to leade his life in a pillour. In whiche pillour together with an other alſo ſtandinge vpon the toppe of an hill he liued threeſcore and eyghte yeares, repleniſhed with all graces from aboue: He caſte out Deuells, he cured euerye diſeaſe and infirmitye, he ſawe thinges to come as if they had beene preſente. He foretolde Gregorie that he ſhoulde not be preſente at his deathe and that he knewe full litle of the thinges which were like to enſue after his death. And when as I alſo muzed with my ſelfe after the loſſe of my children and examined what the cauſe was, whye the Gentiles whiche had children at will were not viſited in like ſorte: Symeon althoughe I vttered my ſecret

This beinge done, immediatly the milke came runninge out as if it had bene a ſtreame and wet all the womans garmente. Vnto theſe that wente before we may adde this alſo, howe certaine trauelers in whoſe company Symeon was, lefte behinde them a childe about midnighte: a Lion came and tooke vp the childe on his backe and brought him to Symeons Monaſtery. Symeon bad the ſeruaunts go forth and take in the childe which the Lion had caried thither. He did many other notable actes, which haue neede of an eloquente tongue, leaſure conuenient, and a peculiar volume, all which are well knowen and rife in euery mans mouth.

He vvas expert in the chiefe diſcipline of the Grecians, by nature an Eunuche, ſo diſpoſed from his natiuitye. For vvhich cauſe the Emperour for rareneſſe thereof appropriated him, placing and preferringe him to be magiſtrate in the citie of Tyrus, and to ouerſee the dieing of purple.

                  THE TRANSLATOR VNTO THE READER TOVTCHING DOROTHEVS AND THE LIVES HE WROTE OF.
                  
                     BY this ſhort treatiſe of DOROTHEVS (Chriſtian reader) we may take occaſion to beholde the prouidence of God ouer his Churche, ſcattered farre and nigh ouer the face of the earth, and to praiſe him therefore: in ſo much that of his great care and entire loue, the inheritors of the kingdome of heauen, his choſen people, the Sainctes of God whoſe names were written in the booke of life, were neuer left deſolate without guides and teachers. Adam in Paradiſe hearde the voyce of GodGeneſ. 3. himſelf, there followed him ſuch as called vpō the name of God, erected diuine worſhip, and taught their poſteritie the ſame, namely, Abel, Seth, Enos, Cainan, Malalael,

                     Iared, Enoch, Mathuſalem, Lamech, and Noe, whome Peter calleth the eight perſon after Seth the ſonne of Adam, and a preacher of righteouſnes. When as the olde worlde and the firſt age numbred from Adam to Noe, I meane as many as liued in hisGeneſ. 7. time were drowned for the ſinnes &amp; iniquities of the whole world, yet ſaued he eight perſons, to reueale his will vnto all nations, to vphold his Church to multiply and to1. Pet. 3. encreaſe the world. In the ſecōd age of the world, after Noe there liued Sem, Arphaxad,

In the third age of the world after Abraham liued Iſaac, Iacob, otherwiſe called Iſrael, with the twelue patriarchs, Ruben, Simeon, Leui, Iuda, Zabulon, Iſſachar, Dan, Gad, Aſer, Nepthali, Ioſeph, &amp; Beniamin. Threeſcore and fiue yeares after the death of Ioſeph, Moſes was borne. He gouerned Iſrael, he guided theExod. 4. Exod. 20. Iudic. 3. 8. 9. 10, 12. 16. Act. 13. 3. Reg. 2. 11. 6. 14. 12. 20. 4.

After theſe came in the kings good &amp; bad, Saule, Dauid, &amp;c. In the fourth age of the worlde there raigned after kinge Dauid, Solomon ouer Iſrael, ouer Iuda Roboam, Abia, Aſa, Ioſaphat, Ioram, Ochozias, Athalia, Ioas, Amaſias, Azarias, Ioathan, Achaz, Ezechias, Manaſſes, Amon, Ioſias, Ioachaz, Ioacim, Iechonias, Sedechias, vnder whome the captiuitie befell, both citie and temple were deſtroyed, &amp; the people led into Babylō. Yet during the ſeuenty yeres of their captiuity, there wanted not ſuch as taught them, ſuch as prophecied vnto them of their deliuerance,1. Eſdr. 5. 1. Eſdr. 2. &amp; comforted them in their miſery. In the fift age of the worlde after the captiuitye the Iſraelites were gouerned by Zorobabel, Reſa, Ioanna, Iudas, Ioſephus, Abner, Semei, Mattathias, Aſer, Maath, Nagid Arphaxad, Agar, Heli, Maſbot, Naum, Amos, Sirach, Mattathias, Siloa, Ioſeph, Arſes, Ianneus, Hircanus, Iudas Machabaeus, Ionathas, Simon, Ionathas, Iohannes Hircanus, Ariſtobulus, Alexander, Hircanus, Antigonus, Ariſtobulus, and Herode the Aliene, in whoſe time Chriſte Ieſus was borne in the fleſhe. Theſe are the ſucceſſions of Magiſtrates and Gouernours of all ſortes, as well of the vvicked to

chaſtiſe, as of the godly to cheriſhe, whom God appointed to gouerne his people, to vpholde the trueth, to extoll vertue, to roote out vice, and to praiſe his holye name. From Aaron vnto the byrth of Chriſt there were prieſts ordained to offer ſacrifice vnto God, to pray for the ſinnes of the people, and to preach the word of trueth. Whoſe names as I reade in the Eccleſiaſticall hiſtory of Nicephorus are theſe. Aaron, Eleazer,

From the byrth of Chriſte (as it is to be ſeene in the Chronographie following) vntill the deſtruction of Ieruſalem vnder Titus, there were theſe high prieſts: Matthias, Ioſephus, Ioazarus, Eleazar, Ieſus ſea, Ananus, otherwiſe Annas, Iſmael, Eleazar, Simon, Caiphas, Ionathas, Theophilus, Simon, Ionathas, Matthias, Elioneus, Ioſeph, Ananias, Ionathas, Iſmael, Ioſephus, Ananus, Ieſus Dannaeus, Ieſus the ſonne of Gamaliel, Matthias, and Phanes, in whoſe time the citie of Ieruſalem was taken, the temple ſet on fire, and the high prieſts ceaſſed. There were alſo from the beginning of the worlde vnto the birth of Chriſt, prophets, foreſhewing (as Dorotheus writeth) the promiſes of God made vnto the fathers, wherin he promiſed to bleſſe all nations in the ſeede of Abraham, through the ſaluation that was to come by our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt. Ioſephus in his Iudaicall Antiquities, writeth thatIoſph. ant. Iud. lib. 1. cap. 4. Iude Epiſt 
                     Adam prophecied and foretolde his ſonnes, the worlde ſhoulde be twiſe deſtroyed: firſt by water, afterwardes with fire. Iude in his Epiſtle ſpeaketh of Enoch, the ſeuenth from Adam, that he prophecied, ſayinge: beholde the Lorde ſhall come with thouſands of Saincts, to geue iudgement againſt all men, and to rebuke all that are vngodly among them, of all their vngodly deedes which they haue lewdly committed, and of all their cruell ſpeakinges whiche vngodly ſinners haue ſpoken againſte him.  
                     Iacob prophecied that his poſteritie ſhoulde be deliuered out of Aegypt: of the commingeGen. 48. 49 of Chriſt, that the ſcepter ſhould not depart from Iuda, and a lawgeuer from betweene his feete vntill Siloh, that is, the Meſsias came Ioſeph foretolde likewiſe the children of Iſraell of their deliuerance out of Aegypt, ſayinge: I die, and God will ſurely viſit you,Gen. 50. and bring you out of this land, vnto the lande which he ſware vnto Abraham, Iſaac, and Iacob. God will not faile but viſite you, and ye ſhall carie my bones hence. Moſes the great worſhipper of the high God, prophecied of the creation of the worlde, and of ſuche thinges as were done vnto his time, the ſpace of two thouſande yeares before he was borne, againe of Chriſte he ſayde (as Peter hath alleadged him in the Actes of the Apoſtles) A Prophete ſhall the Lorde your God rayſe vp vnto you ofAct. 3. your brethren lyke vnto me, him ſhall ye heare in all thinges, whatſoeuer he ſhall ſaye vnto you. Samuel was both a iudge ouer Iſrael, a prieſt and a prophet. Dauid &amp; Solomon alſo is ſayde to haue bene endued with the ſpirite of prophecie, though Dorotheus be of the contrary opinion. Both olde and late writers doe thinke no leſſe then that he was a prophet. Antoninus hath a tracte intitled, De prophetijs Dauid &amp; Solomonis,

liues this autor hath briefely runne ouer. Theſe prophets in ſome places of holy ſcripture are termed Seers, in ſome other places the men of God, againe in other places3. Reg. 18. the ſeruāts of the moſt high God. In the time of King Acab, Obadias the gouernour of his houſe, one that feared God, hid an hundred prophets in caues, yet their names are not knowen. of al the prophets generally, Peter the Apoſtle writeth in this ſort: It is of1. Pet. 1. the ſaluatiō of your ſoules that the prophets haue enquired and ſearched, which prophecied of the grace that ſhould come vnto you: ſearching when or at what time the ſpirit of Chriſte which was in them ſhoulde ſignifie, whiche ſpirit teſtified before the paſſions that ſhoulde happen vnto Chriſte and the glorie that ſhoulde followe after. vnto which prophets, it was alſo declared that not vnto them ſelues but vnto vs, they ſhoulde miniſter the thinges which are now ſhewed vnto you of them. Such was theHeb. 1. goodneſſe of God towardes mankinde, that in times paſt (as S. Paule ſaith) he ſpake at ſundry times, and in diuers ſorts vnto the fathers by prophets, alſo by the miniſtery of Angells ſent forth for their ſakes which ſhalbe heires of ſaluation. In theſe later dayes being the ſixt age of the worlde beginning at Chriſt, and continewinge vnto the day of iudgement, that is vnto the ſeuenth age, and the Sabaoth of reſt, we haue had the twelue Apoſtles, Peter, Andrevve, Iames, Iohn, Philip, Bartholomevve, Mathevve,

of their feete was heard throughout the world. theſe be they which fedde with Angelles, and became themſelues foode for wilde beaſtes, they ſpared not their liues vnto the death, they quenched the heate of fire, they turned the edge of the ſworde, they ſtopped the mouthes of furious beaſtes, they confounded the tyrants, and foyledde the ennemies of the truthe. I may ſay of them, as Cyprian ſpeaketh of the true Chriſtians and Martyrs, occidi poterant, ſed vinci non poterant. Well they might be ſlaine, but it was vnpoſſible to ouercome them. And yet when the ennemie triumpheth, that at leſt wiſe he ſeemeth to haue brought his purpoſe about, we may comfort our ſelues with this ſaying: Sanguis martyrum, ſemen Eccleſiae, the bloude of the Martyrs is the ſeede of the Churche. Chriſt him ſelfe foretolde that whoſoeuer woulde be his diſciple, muſt take vppe his croſſe and followe him. Theſe Prophets and theſe Apoſtles, and theſe Diſciples haue done no leſſe. Abel was murthered by Cain. The children of Iſrael were oppreſſed vnder Pharao. Elias was perſecuted by Iezabel. The Prophet Ioath was threatned by Ieroboam, and ſlaine of a Lion. Zacharie the ſonne of Iehoida was ſtoned to death. Micheas was throwne downe, and his necke broken. Amos was ſmitten with a clubbe on the temples of the heade, and ſo brained. Eſaias was ſawed aſunder in two partes with a wodden ſawe. Ionas was in the whales bellie, yet hauing eſcaped that daunger, was he not without miſerie. Ieremie was perſecuted oftentimes, impriſoned very ſore, throwne into the deepe dungeon where he ſtoode in mire vnto the eares, at length ſtoned to death in AEgypt. Ezechiel was ſlaine at Babylon by the Duke of the people. Daniel was throwne among the hungrie Lions, yet God preſerued him. The three children were throwne into the firie fornace, but the fire did them no harme. Baruch was faine to flie away to ſaue his life from king Ioachas handes. The Prophet Vrias was ſlaine with the ſworde by king Ioacim. Iohn the Baptist was beheaded of Herode the Tetrarche. Steuen was ſtoned to death. Iames was beheaded by Herode Agrippa. Peter was crucified at Rome vnder Nero, with his heade downewardes. Paule was likewiſe beheaded at Rome vnder Nero. Andrevv was crucified by AEgeas king of Edeſſa, at Pataras a Citie in Achaia. Iames Alphaeus, that was Biſhop of Ieruſalem, was throwne downe from an high, and brained with a fullers clubbe. Thomas was ſlaine at Calamina, a Citie in India: the Painims ranne him through with a dart, the which ſome doe call a ſpeare or iauelin. Philip was crucified at Hierapolis in Aſia. Bartolomevv was flaine aliue in India: his ſkinne pulled ouer his eares, and after all, beheaded. Mathevv vvas runne through vvith a naked ſworde in AEthiopia. Simon was crucified. Iude vvas ſlaine. Iohn was ſcurged, and often perſecuted, it is ſaide that Domitian the Emperour cauſed him to be throwne into a tunne of hotte ſkalding oyle, yet tooke no harme. Matthias was knockt on the heade with an axe, and immediatly beheaded. Marke the Euangeliſt had a rope tied about his necke, and by that dravvne throughe the ſtrete of Alexandria, that his fleſh vvas rent in peces, the ſtones coloured with blud, and in the ende he vvas burned to aſhes. Barnabas had a rope about his necke, and there vvith pulled to the ſtake and burned. This is to beare the croſſe of our Sauiour, this is to drinke of one cuppe vvith Chriſt, this is it which S.

This preſent treatiſe of Dorotheus hath moued me thus to vvryte, and the matter it ſelfe is ſo copious, that I can hardly holde my penne, yet I hope the reading of theſe briefe ſtories vvil not ſeeme tedious vnto any. As for the liues following, I would haue thee (gentle reader) to know that where Dorotheus ſeemed vnperfect, and to haue ouerſkipped certen liues worthie

the noting and the knowledge of the poſteritie, I haue either borowed the ſame of ſome other auncient vvryter, or gathered it my ſelfe out of holy ſcripture. This is the marke to diſcerne the one from the other. Where anyone life is altogether of Romaine letters, the ſame is none of Dorotheus. If thou thinkeſt I haue done vvell, geue the praiſe to God, if in thine opinion it ſeeme othervviſe, ſuſpende thy ſentence, and be not ſinguler in reprehending that, vvhich peraduenture after aduiſement taken, may frendly be interpreted.

Reg. 1. 2. 3. 7. 8. 9. 10 13. 15. 16. 25. in the dayes of Heli, Saule and Dauid. His father was called Elkana, his mother Henna. she was of a long time barren, and praying vnto God, made a vowe that if she bare a man childe, she woulde dedicate him to the Lord all the dayes of his life. She conceaued, bare a ſonne, and called his name Samuel, who being a childe was girded with a linnen Ephod, and miniſtred vnto the Lord. All Iſrael knew him for the true Prophet of God, he rebuked the ſinnes of the people, he exhorted them to turne vnto the Lord, he tolde Heli the high Prieſt, that God would plague his houſe. VVhen the people cried vnto him for a king, he vſed all meanes to perſwade them to the contrary, and ſeeing they would not be anſwered, he tooke Saul, and anoynted him king to raigne ouer them. This Saul was a wicked king, and becauſe of his impietie the Lord ſent Samuel vnto him, for to tell him that his raigne should not laſt long, but Samuel was ſorowfull, and mourned ſo long ouer Saul, vntill the Lord was angrie with him for it. Afterwardes God ſent him to anoynt Dauid king ouer Iſrael. In the ende this Samuel waxed olde, and died in the time of Dauid king of Iſrael, and was buried at Rama.

He inſtructed this king in the law of the Lord, and foreſaw that Dauid would offend with Beerſabea. when he made ſpeede to admoniſh the king, Belial ſtaid him. for as he went, he found by the way a dead horſe all bare, and becauſe of that, continewed there a while. This Nathan died, and was buried in Gabaon his owne land.

Eccleſ. 47. in Gabath a Citie of Galilee, liued in the time of Dauid, and taught him the lawe of the Lord. he foreſaw that Dauid was too farre in loue with Berſabea, and therfore immediatly left Gabath, and gotte him towardes Ieruſalem, for to ſtaie the king from committing ſo hainous an offence. And beholde Beliar ſtopt him. for when he found him dead, and lying all bare on the high way, he ſtayed as long as he was a buryinge of him, leſte the carkaſſe of man shoulde vnreuerently be torne in peeces of brute beaſts and rauenouſly deuoured. In the ſame night vnderſtoode Nathan that Dauid had committed that horrible offence, wherefore he mourned out of meaſure, and went backe againe to Gabath with great lamentation. VVhen Vrias, the husbād of Berſabea, was ſlaine by the procurement of Dauid, the Lord ſent Nathan vnto him, that he should rebuke him sharply for his offence. Then at length Dauid remembring him ſelfe, was aſtonied and trembled for feare of the Lord, becauſe he perceaued plainly that the Lorde was highly diſpleaſed with him for his adulterie. Dauid knew moreouer that the Prophet Nathan was inſpired with the holy Ghoſt, he honoured the man and reuerenced his perſon as the true meſſenger of God. This Nathan became olde, and died, and was buried at Gabath his owne land.

This is that Prophet which prophecied of Salomon the ſonne of Dauid, that he woulde fall from the Lord. He rebuked Ieroboam, ſaying, that when he came to be king, he woulde deale vnfaithfully with the Lord. He ſawe in a viſion a yoke of oxen deſtroying the people, and aſſaulting the prieſtes. He prophecied vnto Solomon, that women woulde withdrawe his minde from the Lord. This Ahias became ſo olde that his ſight was dimme, he died not farre from the Oke in Silo, and there was buried.

                        Roboam would haue fought with Ieroboam, the word of God came vnto Semeia, ſaying: ſpeake vnto Roboam the ſonne of Solomon, king of Iuda, and vnto all the houſe of Iuda and Beniamin, and to the remnaunt of the people, ye shall not

                        Epiphanius wryteth thus of Ioath, whom he calleth Ioam.
                        THe Prophet Ioam was of Samaria, a Lion mette him by the way, and ſlewe him. This is he that reprehended Ieroboam for the goldē calues he erected, that tooke away alſo that wicked oblation and ſacrifice. VVhen Ieroboam ſtretched forth his hand againſt him, his hand was withered. Immediatly after, an olde prophet deceaued this Ioam: for when he had conſtrained him to eate breade, and to drinke water otherwiſe then the Lord had commaunded Ioam, a Lion met him and killed him, without any harme done to his aſſe. He was buried in Bether, harde by this olde falſe prophet. VVhen that shortly after this falſe prophet died, he requeſted of the prieſts he might be buried where Ioam was laide, becauſe he had deceaued him, and that either of them was to receaue at the reſurrection, according vnto their doings. VVherefore they were both laide in one ſepulchre.

When Ionas died, God raiſed him to lif by Elias, for he would haue him then know that he coulde not flie from the hand and power of God. After the famine was ended, Ionas left that countrey, and gotte him to the land of Iuda, and when his mother died by the way, he buried her by mount Libanus.

This Ieremy was of Anathoth, the people ſtoned him at Taphnis in Aegypt, and ſo he dyed and lyeth buried there where Pharaos pallace ſtoode. The Aegyptians beinge greatlye benefited by him, did him that honor. For he had prayed for them when certayne Adders and beaſtes that were bred in the water moleſted them ſore, ſuch as the Aegyptians called Menephoth, and the Grecians, Crocodils. And at this day alſo the faithful thereabouts do praye in that place, &amp; take vp duſte from thence for to cure ſuche as are hurte of thoſe beaſtes. Manye of them alſo doe vſe therewyth to chaſe away theſe venemous creatures into other waters. We our ſelues haue learned of ſome that were of the line of Antigonus and Ptolomaeus, auncient and elderlye men, that Alexander king of Macedonia, comming vnto that place where the Prophet was buried, and hearing of the miſteries therof, tranſlated his tumbe &amp; reliques into Alexandria, placed them there with great pompe &amp; glory on euery ſide, &amp; ſo that kinde of ſerpent was baniſhed that land alſo, and that water in like ſort. thus were the ſerpents whom they call Argolai, that is Liſards put away, being brought out of Peloponneſus, ſo that the people there are called Argolai, that is laſy loubers. their ſpeach is nice &amp; fine, but altogether infortunate. This Ieremy gaue the prieſts in Aegypt, warning that their Idols muſt be broken and throwen to the grounde by a ſauiour, that was a babe that ſhoulde be borne of a virgine and layde in a Manger. And therefore at this day they ſette a virgine in bed, and an infant in a Manger, and adore them. And when as of old, king Prolomaeus demaunded of them why they did ſo, their aunſwere was that their aunceſtors had deliuered them that myſtery, and receaued it of the holy prophet. before the temple was taken this prophet tooke out the Arke of couenant &amp; all that was laid vp therin, and hid it in a certen rocke, ſaying vnto ſuch as were preſent. The Lord from Sinai is gone vp into heauen, &amp; againe the lawgeuer ſhall come out of Sion with great power, and the ſigne of his comming ſhalbe vnto you when all nations ſhal honor a tree. he ſaid moreouer, no man ſhall take away that Arke except Aaron, and no man ſhall ſee the tables laide vp therein, be he prieſt or be he Prophet, except Moſes the choſen of God. And at the reſurrection the Arke ſhall firſte riſe and come forth out of the rocke, and it ſhall be layde on mount Sina, and thither vnto it will all the Saincts aſſemble together lookinge for the Lord, and flying from the enemy which would haue deſtroyed them comming vnto this rocke. he ſealed vp this Arke with his finger writing thereon the name of God, the forme of it was like the ingrauing of iron, and a light cloud ouer ſhadowed and couered the name of God, neither knew any man this place, neither could any man reade the ſealinge vnto this day, neither ſhall vnto the end. This rock is in the deſert where y• Arke was made at the firſt, betwene two mountains where Moſes &amp; Aaron lie buried. And in the night time a cloude muche like fire couereth this place euen as it did of olde. The glory of God can neuer be awaye from the name of God. Therefore God gaue vnto Ieremy the grace that he ſhould finiſh his myſtery, &amp; become companion with Moſes &amp; Aaron who are ioyned together vnto this day. For Ieremy came of the line of the prieſts.

And as for the king of Iuda which ſent you to enquire of the Lord, ſo shall ye ſay vnto him. thus ſaith the Lorde God of Iſrael, concerning the words which thou haſt heard, becauſe thine heart did melt, and thou didſt humble thy ſelfe before God whē thou heardeſt his words againſt this place, &amp; againſt the inhabiters, &amp; humbledſt thy ſelf before me, &amp; cariedſt thy clothes &amp; didſt weep before me: I haue heard it alſo ſaith the lord. behold I wil take thee to thy fathers, &amp; thou shalt be put in thy graue in peace, &amp; thine eies shall not ſee all the miſchiefe that I will bringe vpon this place, and vpon the inhabiters of the ſame.

What ſo euer he prophecied of, the Angell of the Lord was ſeene then to inſtruct him▪ euen as it came to paſſe in the days of old when there was no Prince as it is wrytten in the booke of Iudges. He died in the prime of his floriſhing yeares and was laid to his fathers in his owne field.

                  THE PREFACE OF THE AVTOR to the Reader toutching his Chronographie.
                  
                     SEeing that hitherto (gentle Reader) in the tranſlation of theſe auncient Hiſtoriographers, Euſebius, Socrates, Euagrius, and Dorotheus, I haue imployed great labour and induſtrie, referring the paynes to myne owne perſon, and the profit to the furtherance of thy ſtudie &amp; knowledge: I haue determined yet once agayne to gratifie thy louing minde with this Chronographie followinge, a worke which with more eaſe thou mayeſt runne ouer and peruſe, and the ſooner committe to memorie then the former, though my paynes herein were nothinge aſlaked, but aequiualent with the other trauayle. I hope the treatiſe will be acceptable, inſomuch the Engliſhe tongue hath not at this day extant any Eccleſiaſticall Chronographie continewed from ſo long a tyme. Well we may haue catalogues of kings, recitall of Biſhops, pedegrewes of our gentries▪ with other priuate &amp; particular ſummaries ſeuerally handled by ſundry men: yet the generall Antiquitie, the ioynte contriuing, the relatiō to the foūtaine, the ſearching of the original out of farr &amp; foraigne countreyes (ſeeing the Goſpell vvas not firſt preached heere in England) I find not extant in our mother tongue. Therefore orderly to proceede as the aforeſayd learned vvriters haue layd dovvne their example I vvill beginne vvith the birth of Chriſt pē
                     ning in the firſt colume ſuch vvorthy actes as the Euangeliſts haue recorded of him during his abode here on earth, aftervvardes the yeares of his incarnation. The nextLuk. 2. 3. rovvme is an abridgement of the raygne of▪ the Emperours. Luke the Euangeliſte thought good euen in the very entrance of his diſcourſe to laye dovvne the birth of Chriſt in the raygne of Auguſtus the Emperour, and the preaching of Iohn the baptiſt to haue begonne the fifteenth yeare of Tiberius Caeſar. Socrates in the fift booke ofSocrat. eccl. hiſt. lib. 5 proem. his eccleſiaſtical hiſtory tooke the catalogue of the Emperours to be one of his principall drifts, his reaſon vvas becauſe the eccleſiaſtical affayres ſeemed alvvayes to depende very much of the Emperours and Princes. The thirde place contayneth the famous men vvith the fauorers of the trueth▪ the Martyrs and Sayncts of God. The gladſome tidings of the glorious Goſpell vvas not firſt reuealed vnto Princes &amp; Preſidents, vnto the mighty &amp; vviſe of this vvorld (for God needed not their ayd &amp; povver) but vnto the vveake, ſimple, ignorant, fooliſh and contemptible in the ſighte of men, ſuch as were ſheperds, fiſhermen, tolegatherers and tentmakers. The fourth riglet contineweth the raigne of the kings of Iudaea. Mathevv and Luke beganne their Goſpells vvith the raigne of Herode. But they laſted not very long. In the dayes of Herode Chriſt vvas borne in the fleſh, after him came Archelaus, the third was Herod the tetrach vvhich beheaded Iohn the baptiſt, the fourth vvas Herode Agrippa vvhich beheaded Iames the brother of Iohn vvith the ſvvord and dyed miſerably him ſelfe. The laſt vvas Agrippa minor before vvhome Paul pleaded in the Actes of the Apoſtles, inIoſeph. Intiq. lib. 18. cap. 11. Ioſeph. Antiq. lib. 20. cap. vlt. vvhoſe dayes Ieruſalem vvas deſtroyed. Anno Dom. 73. Ioſephus vvriteth that vvithin the compaſſe of one hundred yeares all the progeny of Herode vvas rooted out. The fift order is of high prieſts neither haue I omitted them ſeeing both the Euangeliſtes and the Hiſtoriographers mentioned ſuch as vvere in the time of Chriſt. They ende

likewiſe with the kings of Iudaea and the deſtruction of Ieruſalem. I remember Ioſephus wryteth that frō 
                     Aaron which was the firſt highprieſt vnto the laſt at the ouerthrowe &amp; burning of the temple vnder Titus there were highprieſts to the number of foureſcore and three. The ſixt diuiſionis of councells, ſometimes of the wicked as of the Phariſes and heretickes, ſome other times of the godly as of the Apoſtles and Apoſtolickmen. where it appeareth manifeſtly vnto the wholl world that the biſhop of Rome had as litle to doe therein as other biſhops, for Emperours, princes, &amp; ſomtimes the biſhops of ſome prouince or other within thēſelues, haue ſummoned coū
                     cells, called biſhops together &amp; decided ſuch matters as were called into controuerſie without the aduiſe of the biſhop of Rome. For ſaith Socrates the chiefeſt councelsSocrat. lib. 5. eccl. hiſt. proem. were ſummoned &amp; are vnto this day called together by the commaundement &amp; conſent of the Emperours. Beſides all the aforeſaide I haue laid downe the ſucceſſion of biſhops in the foure moſt famous churches, as Ieruſalē, Antioch, Rome, Alexādria. Though other writers addict them ſelues wholly vnto the Catalogue of the churche of Rome, omitting no not one, Ioan the ſhe Pope onely excepted Some will maruell why I preferre Ieruſalem and Antioch before the ſeae of Rome, the reaſon is becauſeEuſeb. eccl. hiſt. lib. 2. cap. 1.

                        drinus wryteth that Iames called the brother of Chriſt was immediately after the aſſumption of our Sauiour choſen biſhop of Ieruſalem by Peter, Iames and Iohn the Apoſtles. Againe as Luke reporteth the Antiochians were firſt called chriſtians. Paul &amp; Barnabas preached there one wholl yeare and if fame fayle vs not of the trueth Peter the Apoſtle was biſhop there ſeuen yeares and ſpente ſeuen other about Ieruſalem &amp; the Eaſterne contreyes afore his comminge to Rome.

                     aes otherwiſe then all Chronographies in what language ſo euer vnto this day extant haue done, I doe it not of any ſingularitie for theſe auncient Hiſtoriographers Euſebius, Socrates, and Euagrius haue followed the ſame order though other Chronologers and Chronographers haue not imitated them. Laſt of all I haue placed the hereticks by themſelues ſo that the reader may eaſily ſee whē they liued, who they were, what they haue taught, by whome they were condēned &amp; the end of moſt of them as farre forth as the lines might be contriued within the colume &amp; the long tediouſnes auoyded.

The cauſe was as they ſayde, in the defence of the virginitie of Marie. The virgins had a ſeuerall place in the tēple to pray. Marie after the was deliuered &amp; knowen to haue had a ſōne, reſorted thither neuertheles. the Phariſies withſtoode her. Zacharie affirmed ſhe was a virgine, therefore was he flame. Ioſeph. bell.

                           There vvas a councell of prieſts gathered together at Ieruſalem a litle before Chriſt reuealed him ſelfe, to chuſe a Prieſte in the rovvme of one that vvas deſeaſed. Looke hovv many letters there are in the Hebrevv tongue, ſo many prieſtes there vvere in the tēple: to vvere 22. the maner vvas to regiſter in a certaine boke reſerued in the temple, the day of the election, the name of the elected, the name of his father, of his mother, &amp; of his tribe. whileſt that they thought ſome on one mā, ſome on an other, there ſtepped forth a prieſt one of the multitude, &amp; ſayd: My vvill is that IESVS the ſonne of Ioſeph the carpē
                              ter be elected prieſt, vvho though he be yōg in yers, yet paſſeth he in vtterāce &amp; vviſdome, &amp; maners. I thinke truely there vvas neuer ſeene in Ieruſalem ſuch a one, both for eloquence, &amp; life, &amp; maners, the vvhiche I am ſure all that inhabit Ieruſalem do knovve as vvell as I. The vvhich vvas no ſoner ſpoken, but vvas allovved of. &amp; the partie, I meane Ieſus, choſen to be a prieſte. They doubt of his tribe, agayne they vvere therein reſolued. They call for his parentes to regiſter theyr names. The prieſt that fauored Ieſus made anſvver that Ioſeph his father vvas deade, yet Marie his mother vvas alyue. She vvas brought before them, she affirmed that she vvas his mother, &amp; that Ieſus vvas her ſonne, but she ſayde moreouer that he had no father on earth, that she vvas a virgine, &amp; that the holy Ghoſt had ouershadovved her. They ſent for the midvviues &amp; alſo for ſuch as had ben preſent at the birth. She vvas founde to be a virgine, in the end they concluded vvith one voyce that he shoulde be regiſtred Ieſus the ſōne of God, &amp; of Marie the virgine. VVe remēber moreouer Ioſephus to haue ſaid that Ieſus ſacrificed in the temple together vvith the prieſts. Heerevpon alſo it fel out that as Ieſus entred into the ſynagogue of the Ievves, the boke vvas deliuered vnto him vvhere he read of the prophet Eſai: vvhereby vve gather that if Ieſus had not bene prieſt amōg the Iewes▪ the booke vvoulde not haue bene deliuered vnto him. Neither is it permitted amongeſt vs Chriſtians for any to reade holye ſcripture in the opē aſſemblie, vnleſſe he be of the cleargie. So farre Suidas as he learned of a Ievve.
