            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

                  HIpponicus the Sonne
of Hippias, a citizen
of Athens, hauing
decreed and appointed
to erect and dedicate a certaine
Image vnto his natiue soile,
as a testimony and manifestation,
of his ardent loue, dutifull affection,
and gratitude towardes the
same, was counselled and importunately

perswaded by his friends
and kinsfolks (who did heare of
his immutable determination
thereunto) to giue out the same
to be framed &amp; made by Polycletus,
(an excellēt grauer of Images
in those times) but he greatly disassenting
from their opinion, and
reiecting their importunate perswasions,
answered them; that in
doing so, he should exhibit to the
eyes of Athens, an image or representation,
rather of the excellent
Art of Polycletus, the Image
maker, then (according to his intention)
the image &amp; manifestation
of his owne loue, regard, and
affection; &amp; that likewise it might
bee that Athens so should rather
respect the one, then perceiue so
well or regard the other: and
therefore hee had decreed, to manifest
his own affection or heart,
by his owne hand, perswading

himselfe, that the whole, to wit,
the manifestation howsoeuer, as
his loue manifested, proceeding
both from himselfe, would bee
more acceptable to his Athenians,
then the exact arte of expert
Polycletus; and that not hauing
great occasion to fixe their eyes
onely vpon the exquisite worke
of the image or representation, to
say, who wrought it? they would
onely behold the ardent affection
represented of him who dedicated
the same: So likewise with
Hipponicus, after long and earnest
wishing of an occasion, whereby
I might in some sort also, manifest
and testifie my dutifull affection,
regard, remembrance, and
gratitude; which I owe to the
Athens of my birth &amp; education,
as a small riuer returning to his
Ocean. I haue decreed to erect
and dedicate vnto the same, as an

image and plainer manifestation
of my loue, (being a young man
my selfe) this image and representation
of a godly and Christian
young man, trying his waies,
and by earnest inquiring in consolatiō
with God, shewing whereby
or how to redresse the same, to
wit, in taking heede thereto, according
to Gods word. vnto the which
examplar, I wish that euery yong
man may (as he should) cōforme
himselfe; &amp; being inuaded or neuer
so little stung, with the poisonable
&amp; serpentine lusts of youth,
whereof this wildernesse is so ful,
he may vnto this image, erected
in Gods word, lift vp his eyes,
thereby &amp; therein beholding his
dutie, and the safetie of his soule,
which (with Hipponicus) I perswade
my selfe likewise, that it
shall be so in loue accepted of my
natiue Athens and Athenians, as

in loue, and a testimonie of my
loue, I dedicate the same vnto
them. In the framing whereof,
albeit the exact arte of Polycletus
be wanting, and is not to bee expected,
yet with him, without
any suspecting of the contrarie, I
doe assure and perswade my selfe,
that the loue of the Dedicatour
with his intention to manifest &amp;
testifie hereby the same, will bee
more respected and weighed in
the ballance of reciprocall loue,
(which couereth many infirmities)
then the Image thereof dedicated,
or manner of testification
howsoeuer. In the which assurance
and perswasion, I doe rest,
repose, secure &amp; satisfie my selfe;
desiring withall, and earnestly
wishing, that the almightie God
of Israel, who neither slumbereth
nor sleepeth, may euer bee
the watch-man and wall of the

Citie, with the s
                  •
               nne of his loue,
and sincere trueth of his Sonne,
that hee may euer shine in and
vpon it, that the Candlesticke
thereof may neuer bee remoued,
nor the Chariots and Horsemen
thereof taken away, but his blessings
may bee vpon his people
externally, internally,
eternally,
Amen.

his way? In taking heede
thereto, according to thy word.
            
            
               COncerning the Author
of this Psalme, amongst
writers there
is no concordance,
and agreement, in certaintie
of any nominated particular;
but as the tree is knowne by his
fruites, so it is euident by this Psalm,
and the manifold comfortable matter

therein contained, that he was a
singular sanctified &amp; holy Prophet
of God, who wrote the same, by the
speciall inspiration of Gods holy
Spirit. And it appeareth more particularly
that the certaine Author
thereof was Dauid, being then a
young man in Sauls Court, then
greatly corrupted (as by his collation
verse, 100. appeareth) and that
hee did meditate this Psalme not1. Sa. 17. 49.
long time after the slaughter of Goliah,
               1. Sam. 18. 9. being presently thereafter notwithstanding,
laied open to the narrow
marking and hatred of Saul
himselfe,Ps. 119 161. and to the malice of his
wicked seruants, as also beset and
pursued with the temptatiōs of thePsal. 119. 157
inticing pleasures and manifold alluring
vanities of youth. Which desiring
to auoide, and to institute his
life and waies according to the law
of God, that so hee might haue
Gods loue more encreased towards
him to encounter the vniust
hatred of man, and his strength
more confirmed in his heart, to ouercome

the manifold temptations
of fraile youth. He therefore imploreth
Gods helpe and the assistance
of his Spirit,Verse.

               to open his eyes that he may
see the wonders of his law, to make him
vnderstand the way of his precepts,
               27. 
               to direct
him therein,
               35. 
               to incline his heart to his
testimonies,
               36. 
               to turne away his eyes from
regarding vanitie, and to quicken him in
his way,
               37. 
               to direct his steppes in his word,
and let no iniquitie haue dominion ouer
him,
               133. 
               to deliuer him from the oppression of
men, that he might keepe his statutes, and
to let his louing kindnesse and saluation

            The title prefixed before this
Psalme is, Halleluiah, an Hebrew

by Dauid, Psalm. 76. as also by the
glorified spirits and Angels in heauen

word importeth in it selfe, incommunicable
to any other. As for the
signification therof, it is compounded
of two words, Hallelu, a verbe
in the imparatiue moode signifying
Praise, and Iah, the glorious
name of God, retained so in the originall,
Psalm. 53. vnexpressed by
any other word: so that by this signification,
the reason of the intitulation
thereby, of this Psalme, is
this; that in the same great matter
of praising Gods holy name, is set
before our eyes, who in his loue to
man, hath manifested his will in his
powerfull word, by the keeping
whereof, and walking in the same,
we are made truly happy &amp; perfitly
blessed, vers. 1, 2. Whereby yong
and olde may redresse, purifie, and
make straight their sinful, vncleane
and crooked waies, reforming and
conforming them by the same to
his will. Which as it is the word of
him, who is the resurrection &amp; the life, so
it quickens euery dead soule in sin,Ver. 25. 50. 39.
raising it vp to newnesse of life; a

coūsellor to the simple,Verse, 24. a delight to
the godly, a lanterne to our feete in

the night;Ver. 11, &amp; 28 a comfort in trouble,
which raiseth, and saueth from sin,
and preserueth from eternall confusion,
as verse, 6. So that for this
great and excellent benefit, and for
such an inestimable Iewell, in this
Psalme reuealed vnto vs, wee are
bound with that wise Marchant in
the Gospel, to reioyce exceedingly
in our heart, and to expresse and
manifest our ioy in hearty praise
and thanksgiuing to God the giuer
thereof. And so forth for the signification
of the title of this Psalme,
or inscriptiō, with the reason thereof,
and vse made in this place. As
for the further etimologie, according
to the Latine orthographie
thereof:Ha. l

as it is aboue all other most pleasant
and delectable; so this Psalme containing
the same, as in length, so in
excellencie it surpasseth the rest, as
the Sunne doth the small glistering
starres in glory and brightnesse of
light, shewing and setting forth to
the eyes of all men, the inestimable
worth and rare vertue of GODS
word, with the most blessed &amp; happie
estate of all those whose delight
is therein, and who maketh it a rule
to conforme all their actions thereby,
and their way wherein they wil
walke.
            The Psalme it selfe, according to
the forme therof, is of a mixed kind
of stile, containing diuers exhortations
to all men, who would attaine

vnto true happinesse to seeke after
Gods word, and embrace the same
with their whole heart, walking
therein, and practising the same in
their life and conuersation, with
sundry and sweete comforts to
the godly that are afflicted any
way; also confessions of his owne
delight, earnest desire, estimation,
ardent loue, and carefull obseruation
of Gods precepts and word,
fearefull threatnings to the wicked,
who despiseth the same, and many
earnest prayers to God to confirme
him in his trueth, to establish his
feete in his waies, and to take away
all impediments whatsoeuer might
hinder his course in this path of saluation.
            The diuision of the Psalme is in
22. sections called octonaries, according
to the number of the letters
of the Hebrew Alphabet, being
so many. Euerie section or octonarie
containing 8. seuerall and distinct
verses, beginning all in the originall
Hebrew text, with one seuerall

letter, wherein some will
haue a mysterie included. But there
are three chiefe reasons rendred
thereof: the first is, that it is done
and composed so, for the greater
ornament of the Psalme, the matter
thereof being so excellent. The second
is, that the excellent doctrine
and matter of the Psalme may bee
the more diligently noted, &amp; greater
delight &amp; estimation had thereof.
And thirdly, that these excellent
doctrines abounding so in euerie
part and verse of the Psalme, being
many, diuers, and so necessarie by
this forme of composition and order,
they may more easily be comprehēded
in our memory. But Ambrose
vpon this same Psalme, yeeldeth
a fourth reason &amp; vse, diuerse
from the former of the notation of
this Psalm so, which is thus; Vt paruulorum
Ingenia primis literarum elementis
legendi vsum addiscunt: ita nos buiusmodi
elementis vsum viuendi: As the Ingines
or wits of little children (saith
he) by the first elements of letters

learneth the vse of reading, so let
vs by these Elementes learne the
vse of liuing.
            The full Alphabet whereby this
Psalme is noted, noteth to vs the
fulnes of the matter therein contained,
and that wee with our whole
affections should fully embrace the
same, and with all our heart and
soule desire it, and delight therein.
            The diuersitie of the letters sheweth
the diuersitie and plentie of
matter, that is set before our eies; as
so many pleasant &amp; holesome delicate
dishes, at a bountifull bāquet.
            The vnitie of all the verses in euery
octonarie beginning with one
letter, doth demonstrate the vnitie
of the matter therein contained, to
the delight whereof, if wee will vnite
our hearts, it is able to vnite vs
with God our Father in loue.
            By the octonar number in euery
section is declared,Leuit. 12. that as the purification
of vncleannesse, and the
celebration of Circumcision (whereby
the fore-skin of the flesh was

taken away) by Gods law, was obserued
the eight day; euen so by the
embracing of these doctrines and
obseruing of Gods holy Lawe
(whose excellencie and powrefull
effects are set downe in these octonaries)
our hearts shall be purified,
and made cleane before God, hauing
thereby the fore-skin of our
heart, which barreth out Gods spirit,
that king of glory from entring
into it, and our carnall affections taken
away, our drossie &amp; vncleane
corruption, by the fire of that
word and spirit burned vp, and
consumed, and the Image of God,
Iesus Christ, that second Adam restored
to vs; with whom wee must
rise in righteousnesse, as by sinne
in that first Adam, we al did fall and
lost that glorious Image of our
Creator, and God.
            As for the Argument of the
whole Psalme: In the same the holy
Prophet of God exhorteth all
the faithfull, and members of the
true Church of Christ, carefully to

retaine, keepe and obserue the
word of God in all sinceritie &amp; puritie
of truth, eschewing all addition,
or mixture of mans wisedome
(which is foolishnesse) thereunto,
and worshipping God, as hee hath
commanded and warranted vs, in
his word onely. As also that not
onely wee retaine the same in the
sinceritie thereof, worship GOD
onely according thereunto, but also
we make it a rule to all our actions,
practising the same dayly:
night and day delighting and meditating
therein: laying and hiding
it vp in our hearts: and by the
sanctificatiō of our life, to shew the
pietie of our heart, thought, word,
and deed agreeing therevnto. And
because to vnderstand Gods word
(in respect of our naturall ignorance)
and in our life to practise
the same (in respect of the dominion
of sinne, that he hath gotten ouer
vs) is not of the strength of man,
but must be the power, &amp; worke of
Gods holy spirit, therefore he mixeth

often prayers; to open his eyes; to
make him vnderstand the way of his precepts,
               Vers. 18.
               to direct his steps therein,
               27. 
               and to let
no Iniquitie haue dominion ouer him:
               37. by
this example teaching vs the like133.
dutie. There are ioyned also
thanksgiuings of the Prophet, that
already (as he confesseth to Gods
glory &amp; the incouragement of the
faithfull) hee had found and perceiued
in his heart, the beginnings
of true faith, comfort, and new obedience
to be kindled, which earnestly
he craues to bee augmented
and confirmed in him, thereby also
in his person teaching vs our dutie,
to enquire if wee can, or haue
found Gods graces begun, sowed
or rooted in our hearts; if not as yet
to desire the same earnestly, if alreadie
to craue the increasing and
confirmation further thereof, and
be truely thankfull for that we haue
receiued.Vers. 25. 28. 81. &amp; 120. Hee complaineth also,
shewing the heauinesse, faintnesse,
griefe, and feare that he hath conceiued
for the horror of his sinnes:

notwithstanding comforting himselfe,
and all the godly, that are inwardly
or outwardly afflicted, by
relying in faith vpon Gods promise,
and saluation reuealed and
made to him, and to all those that
beleeue in his name; which is, and
must be, the onely ease and comfort
to any afflicted soule. As also of the
multitude,Vers. 157. 161. 93. greatnesse, and crueltie
of his enemies, that despising Gods
lawe themselues, did seeke likewise
to hinder him from walking
therein, for whom his eyes notwithstanding,
did gush out with riuers
of water, because they kept
not the same, desiring God therefore
to represse their crueltie, and
wicked enterprise, and the more
they did seeke to drawe him away
from his law and obedience, that
hee would in his mercie the more
confirme and establish him in his
statutes; shewing thereby the many
hinderances, that the godly hath euer
had, and shall continually haue
cast in their way by Sathan, to hinder

their iourney to that spirituall
Canaan, with their Ioshua, Iesus: and
our dutie therein, to bee sorie for
their aberring, and desire our owne
confirmation; likewise, as hee did
shew that they were blessed who
walked in Gods law, so to the wicked
hee sheweth their condition,
and that their portion is shame and
confusion, if they will not returne
and walke also therein: so setting
before euery mans eies, with Moses,
life and death to choose.
            The diuision of the Psalme (according
to the matter therein contained)
may be in foure parts.
            In the first whereof, he sheweth
the true felicitie and happinesse of
the godly, to be placed and consist
in the studie, beliefe, and obedience
of the will of God reuealed &amp; manifested
vnto vs in his word, which
(in respect of the excellencie thereof,
the desire and estimation wee
should also haue of the same in our
heart) is adorned with many titles
proper thereunto.
            
               In the second part, the Prophet
(for an example to the faithfull)
earnestly desireth God, to informe
and confirme him in the knowledge,
studie, beleefe &amp; obedience
of his reuealed will, by the operation
of his powerfull spirit, who may
inlighten his vnderstanding, reforme
and conforme his will to his
owne, sanctifie his affections and all
the members of his body, seeing the
same is not in the power of man to
doe, neither can flesh and blood reueale
the same to vs.
            
            In the third part, he desireth God
to deliuer him from all impediments,
whether of his owne flesh, of
sinne, the world, Satan, or his outward
enemies, which might hinder
or stay him any waies from walking
more freely in the paths of saluation
and his word.
            And in the last and fourth part,
being priuie to his own conscience,
of the institution of his former life,
and equitie of his cause, hee imploreth
Gods constant assisting grace,

in the administration of the rest of
his life, committing and commending
to his eternall protection, for
euer, himselfe and his cause.
            So farre in generall, concerning
the Author, Intitulation, Notation,
Argument, and Diuision of this
Psalme, for an Induction to the
specials following.
            Now concerning the speciall
notation, argument, and diuision
of this second octonarie, or section.
The first verse whereof, by the assisting
grace of Gods spirit, shall
be by vs handled.
            The notation of this second octonarie,
is by the second letter of the
Hebrew Alphabet, 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                
               Beth: wherewith
euery verse in the originall,
contained in this section is noted,
and beginneth.
            The signification thereof (as all
Hebrew letters signifie, and therein
excelleth all other letters) is
double, for it is either Confusio, as
Ambrose turneth it, and so, the reason
why this octonarie is noted

therewith, is thus; that whosoeuer
redresseth his way by Gods word,
seeketh him with his whole heart,
wandereth not from his commandements,
hideth his promise in his
heart, that he sinne not against him,
declareth the iudgements of his
mouth, delighteth in the way of his
testimonies, meditateth in his preceps,
and forgetteth not his word:
whosoeuer (I say) obserueth these
eight things, contained in this octonary,
of eight Verses, shall neuer
see Confusion. This same reason and
promise is set downe more briefly
in the 5. &amp; 6. verses of this Psalme,
the words whereof are these, O that
my waies were directed to keep thy statutes
this is the wish or conditiō; the promise
by way of inferēce followeth;
Thē should I not be confounded: the condition
repeated; When I haue respect
vnto all thy commandements. But wee
must vnderstand that there is a
two-fold confusion, for there is, Cō
                  fusio
damnationis; a confusion of condemnation,
inflicted vpon the reprobate

by God in his iustice, for
iust desert and punishment of their
sinnes, of the which the Prophet of
God, in this place meaneth: and
there is confusio contritionis, a confusion
of repentance proper to the
godly, which proceedeth of humilitie
and sorrow for their sinnes,
wherewith God in his mercie moueth
their heart, that so hee may accept
them in his fauour, raise
them by the comfort of his spirit,
and forgiue them their iust desert
for their offences, which euery one
must haue, who would escape that
eternall and fearefull confusion of
euerlasting destruction.
            The other signification of this
Letter 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                
               Beth, is Domus; a house
(whose figure it representeth) and
so the reason is thus, that whosoeuer
would bee counted as one of
Gods house, and so bee saued; As
God (the Master of the house) is
pure and cleane; his house and seruants
cleane likewise: so thou who
would adioyne thy selfe in thy

youth to their societie, and eate at
his table: thou must be cleane also;
Cleansing thy waies according to his word:
putting on that white cleane robe
of the righteousnesse of Iesus Christ,
that wedding garment, &amp; seruing
him in his Family, in purity &amp; holinesse
of life, by obseruing these
doctrines which are here set down
in this section to doe the same.
            The Argument of this Section
is this, as in the former generally to
all men hee commended the desire
of godlinesse, and keeping of Gods
word, shewing the estate of such
to be blessed, and that to be the only
way to attaine to true &amp; perfect
happines for euer: so now in this
octonarie, and first verse thereof:
particularly hee commendeth the
same desire of pietie, and obseruation
of Gods word, vnto young
men first, and that for two chiefe
causes moouing him. Whereof the
first is, because that age, placeth a
man vncertaine, betweene two
wayes, what course of life to chuse,

(as Xenophon reporteth of Hercules
out of Prodicus; and Cicero in the
first of his Offices saith, Imprimis autem
constituendum est qui nos, &amp; quales
esse velimus, quae deliberatio est omnium
diffic
                     •
                  ll
                     •
                  na. Wee must first appoint
what men, and of what sort or
calling wee would bee, which aduisement
of all other is hardest
and most difficult, in such an hard
&amp; doubtfull deliberation: therfore
the Prophet here sheweth that no
better nor surer counsell can bee,
then to follow Gods word,Vers. 24. as our
counsellor which may both direct
and retaine vs in a good course of
life, and therefore not to delay time
till olde age: but to beginne in our
youth, which whosoeuer neglecteth,
and therein hardens his heart
in sinne, that man hardly is, or can
be recalled and brought (except it
be by the extraordinarie mercie of
God) to repentance and a good life
hereafter.
            The second reason is, because
youth is carried with a more headlong

force vnto vice, lust, and vaine
pleasures of the flesh: Therefore it
hath neede of straiter discipline,
more carefull watching, and harder
brydling, and more diligent instruction
by the word of God, which
except it be adhibited timely, there
is great perill, and it is to be feared,
lest head-longs in the vehemencie
of their course, they bee carryed
suddenly into vtter destruction,
which lamentable experience hath
too often taught to be true.
            The diuisio
                  •
                of this octonar is in
three chiefe parts. The first whereof,
is contained in this first Verse,
which God willing shall be entreated
of; wherein (being to shew the
excellent effects of Gods word, in
this whole Psalme) is, that it keepeth
from sinne, it quickneth, it
bringeth peace, and gladnesse to
the heart, it giueth vnderstanding
&amp;c. (thereby the more to induce
and mrue euery man, to a greater
desire and loue thereof) He setteth
downe heere the first particular

and cheife effect of Gods word, as
to all ages and men, so chiefly and
more particularly, commending
and commanding the study, exercise,
and desire thereof; to youth
(the firstage, capable of the same)
for the reasons and causes aforesaid.
            The second part of this octonarie,
is from the 1. Verse thereof to
the 15. wherein hee setteth downe
his owne example, for confirmation,
and further moouing of yong
men, to embrace his former exhortation,
and it containeth foure seuerall
confessions made vnto God.
The first, of his great desire to
Gods word,Vers. 10. in seeking him with his
whole heart; with a prayer to confirme
him the more therein. The
second, of his great care and estimation
he had thereof,Vers. 11. 
               in hiding it
in his heart▪ for the end, that hee should not
sinne against him.
               Vers. 13. The third of the
declaring of the iudgements of his mouth
with his lippes:
               Vers. 14
                     •
                  . and the fourth, of the
great delight he had therein, as in all riches.
               
In the middest of his confessions,
vers. 12. interponing a thanksgiuing
and prayer. Blessed art thou
O Lord, teach me thy statutes.
            
            The third part, is in the 15. and
16. Verses, containing a foure-fold
promise further, according to his
foure-folde former Confession,
which are; first,Vers. 15. Meditation in his
preceps: secondly, consideration
of his wayes:Vers. 16. thirdly, delight in
his statutes: and fourthly, remembrance
of his word.
            The first part of the octonarie
contained in this first Verse thereof,
is diuided againe in two parts, a
question, and answere made therevnto,
(albeit there bee some who
make all the Verse a question onely,
thereby denoting the difficultie
(chiefly in yong men) to liue according
to Gods law, &amp; framing it so,
according to the Hebrew: Whereby
shall a yong man cleanse his way, that
he may keepe the same, according to thy
word?
            
            
               The Question.Wherewith shall a yong man redresse his
way?
            
            In this question there are foure
things to be considered. First, the
person concerning whom this
question is mooued, described by
his age; A yong man. Secondly, the
matter of the question; A yong mans
way. Thirdly, an action is set down;
Redressing, or cleansing thereof; in futuro,
of the contrary, thereby signifying,
the present estate thereof to be vncleane
and vnredressed in it selfe.
And the fourth meanes; Wherein?
or wherewith? this action should bee
performed, by way of interrogation
denoting the difficultie thereof.
            The answere hath reference vnto
the question propounded so:
Wherewith shall a yong man redresse his
way? In taking heed thereto, where the
actions of redressing, and taking heede
hath their reference: the rule of

both is, according to thy word.
            
            The translation of the question,
according to the originall in the
Hebrew is, 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                
               in quo mundabit,
&amp;c. Wherein shall a young man
cleanse his way?
               Gen. 6. 5. as if hee would say;
seeing the way of all men is defiled
with many enormities, and much
filthinesse of sinne in all ages, but
chiefly youth is polluted with
great iniquitie, and vncleannesse of
the burning lustes of the carnall affections:
therefore (sinne in them
being most strongest, and so most
seuerely and soonest to bee repressed)
wherein or in what manner
shall a young man purge the vncleannes
of his youth, and redresse
these strong enormities of his life?
The vulgar translation is wherewith,
or by what way or meanes may, or
shall a yong man redresse and rectifie
his way and course of liuing? All to
the same sense and meaning.
            First, that this admonition and
exhortation of young men in this
verse is propounded questionwise,

               Wherewith? &amp;c, It teacheth vs,
first the difficultie of the redressing
the way of our youth, both in respect
of the peruerse and aduerse
nature thereof, from hearing good
counsell and the godly graue instructions
of our elders, as also of
the vnaptnes of this age, to follow
or to embrace the same, except by
Gods speciall grace it be assisted &amp;
seconded, which is plainely manifested
in the examples of those in
the primitiue world, that despised
old Noahs instructions, of the Sodomites,
and chiefly the two sonnes
in law of old Lot, to whom hee appeared,
to mocke when wisely and
louingly hee warned them to flee
Gods iudgementes, of the two
sonnes of olde Eli, who despised
their fathers reproofe and warning
to abstaine from the filthy lustes
and sinnes, with sundry others,
whose ende was euer fearefull destruction
and ouerthrow, for youth
like an vntamed or wild colt, can
hardly heare or will obey, the strait

bridle that restraineth libertie, it
cannot away with graue counsell
of his Elders: but as foolish Rehoboam,
despised his fathers olde counsellors,
and heard the furious and
hote yong men that were brought
vp with him. So they thinke olde
age, doting, and willingly hath a
ready eare open to the intising Syrens
of their owne affections and
youthly lusts, who are their young
counsellors, and Placebos, hearing
and beeing seduced by them: till
many of them haue lost a greater
kingdom then Salomon could leaue
to his sonne, euen that kingdome of
heauen, which Christ hath purchased
by his blood; they will followe
whether they draw them, and saile
as they blow in their sailes, till on
the pernitious rockes of fearefull
destruction, many of them make
ship-wracke, they will not be recalled
nor awake, but lye asleepe vpon
the deceitfull knees, of the delaying
and dallying Dalilah, of the filthy
lustes and vaine poysonable pleasures

vntill they haue lost their
strength, Gods graces and benefits
bestowed vpon them, become
a mocking stocke for their enemies,
and a ready prey for Sathan,
that greedie deuouring Lyon.
Therefore let all yong men, (considering
that the difficultie of youth
is such, to heare or obey good and
graue instructions, whereby their
wayes may bee redressed,) desire
and entreat earnestly of God Almightie,
to giue them his grace
and the assistance of his spirit, that
their eares may bee willingly and
readily open to heare his word, and
the godly admonitions of their Elders,
to giue them hearts to vnderstand
aright, that it is for their great
&amp; only good, to follow the same, to
shut their eares and hearts, to all
entising of sin or vice, &amp; to direct
their foot-steps into his holy way:
that by his grace they may the
more easily walke from grace to
grace: &amp; truly such difficulty resisted
&amp; ouercome, maketh a greater

and more glorious victorie to euery
yong man, who hath Gods feare
before his eyes.
            The second thing which wee
note, by the interrogatiue setting
down, of this exhortatiō of youth,
is, not onely the fore-named naturall
difficultie, in them for redressing
of their wayes: but also
the dutie of all Youth, as the Prophet
here in the person of a yong
man plainly sheweth: which is that
euery one should enter into a diligent
examination &amp; inquisition of
his wayes, and that, not consulting
with flesh and blood, for then many
excuses and delayes shall bee,
but with the Prophet heere, with
and before God alone, enquiring
of his waies according to his word.
The further cōmand of this duty,
beside the prophets example here,
is plainly set downe in the old testament:
Lam. 3. 40. Let vs search and
trie our wayes and turne againe vnto the
Lord: the neglect and incommoditie
whereof, the same Prophet

complaineth greatly vpon: Iere. 8.
6. I hearkned, &amp; heard, but none spake aright;
no man repented him of his wickednesse,
saying, What haue I done? (the
incommoditie followeth) euery one
therefore turned to his race, as a horse russheth
into the battell. In the new Testament,
also the Apostle commandeth
the same dutie: 2. Cor. 13. 5.
Prooue your selues whether you are in the
faith,
               1. Cor. 11. 28. 
               examine your selues; know you not
your owne selues? how that Iesus Christ
is in you, except you bee reprobates. So
that this triall and diligent examination
must be in the heart of euery
true Christian, yong and olde;
and indeed it is the very first step
to saluation: Marie Magdalen, before
euer she could come neere to
Christ, or found any comfort in
him, she tryed and with mourning
considered; What are my wayes? what
haue I done? Peter, ere euer Christ
looked comfortably vpon him againe,
after his deniall, with bitter
teares he cōsidered; what haue I done?
            
            The Prodigall child, and true

paterne of a conuerted sinner, before
euer he saw his fathers face or
house: his first step, was, he considered
with sorrow and tryed; What
haue I done? Paul, before his co
                  •
               uersion,
heard from heauen and considered
in his heart; What hee had
done, before he said, Lord, what shall I
doe?
            
            The Iewes at Peters Sermon were
pricked in their consciences, and
with griefe of minde considered;
What they had done, before they
could say: Men and brethren, what
shall we doe? For this triall is the first
step and embracing of Gods mercie.
For from serious tryall commeth
true acknowledging, from
true acknowledging, commeth
humble confession, and from humble
confession proceedeth the assurance
of absolution, and comfort of
Gods spirit: if we iudge our selues,
we shall not bee iudged (saith the
trueth) and how can we iudge before
triall and knowledge? Therefore
let euery yong man learne to

trie himself and his wayes: What he
hath done, according to Gods word:
For without this first 
                  •
               nquisition
to find out the errour &amp; impuritie
of our waies, we shal neuer attaine
to the second, to enquire Wherewith
they shal be cleansed, redressed, or
rectified,
            The 3. thing which is to be noted
by this inquisitiue manner of the
Prophets speach, and which may
be called the second step to saluation
is, that after such diligent and
earnest enquirie of our wayes,
What wee haue done, wee must also
ioyne a true acknowledging and
humble confession of our errour
&amp; transgression, proceeding from
an inward griefe, with an heartie
desire of redressing; for how can
a yong man inquire and desire of
God, that his waies may be redressed,
or cleansed, except hee first
try them and acknowledge the errour,
and vncleanes thereof? Can a
man turne to walke in the right
way, except first, hee find and acknowledge

himselfe to bee in the
wrong? Can a man seck for a Physitian
except first he finde and acknowledge
himself to be diseased?
Therefore if we would returne or
be conuerted, we must first by tryal,
acknowledge and confesse with
Isaiah, 53. 6. All wee like sheepe haue
gone astray: we haue turned euery one to
his owne way. And except with the
Prodigall sonne we acknowledge,
first, that wee haue gone in a farre
countrie from our father, wee can
neuer resolue to draw nere againe,
except we cōfesse humbly, first vpon
the knees of a sorrowfull soule,
that wee haue sinned against heauen,
and before him, not being any
more worthy to be called his sons.
Verily, we shal neuer be imbraced
in the armes of his mercie, nor receiue
the comfortable kisse of his
loue: thou must say, Lord, forgiue
me the sinnes and rebellions of my
youth, before he say to thy conscience
that they are pardoned: thou
must first acknowledge thy wayes,

to be polluted with the filth of sin,
and lusts of thy youth, before thou
can inquire, Wherewith they may be
redressed, or obtaine that the Lord
would cleanse and purge them in
his mercie, the poore Publican acknowledged
first that hee was vnworthie
to lift vp his eyes to heauē
in respect of his offences, before he
went home iustified before God,
the theefe vpon the crosse confessed
that he dyed and suffered iustly
for his sinnes, before he receiued
that comfortable promise and assurance
from Christ, to bee with
him that same night in Paradise.
Dauid first confessed to the Prophet
Nathan, that hee had sinned
indeede, before he receiued the answer
that his sinnes were forgiuen
him. With many such examples,
shewing that young and olde, wee
must al confesse our guiltinesse before
that great Iudge and King of
all Kings, before wee receiue our
pardon: before earthly Kings and
Iudges, confession &amp; acknowledging

of the fault maketh present
cōdemnation; before God almightie,
confession and acknowledging
of our sinnes with sorrow, maketh
present absolutiō. Therfore let euery
man, &amp; chiefly youth (whose errors
cōmonly are greatest (professe
&amp; confesse in all submissiō of hart
before God the enormities, vncleannes,
&amp; iniquitie of their waies, that
the God of all mercy &amp; loue, may
at his good will and pleasure, reforme,
redresse, and purge the
same, to his glory and our eternall
comfort.
            The fourth &amp; last obseruatiō that
may be gathered by this interrogatory
proposition of the Prophet in
person of a young man, and which
may be truely called the third step
to saluation, is not onely to try our
waies, and to acknowledge the erroneous
course thereof with sorrow,
but to make a further and second
inquisition of the right way
with a harty desire to walk therin,
I must not only examine my waies

and course of life hitherto, nor
thinke it enough to bee sorrowfull
and grieued for the erronious going
astray therein, which I deprehend
and acknowledge, but also
I must ioyne this inquirie &amp; desire
to know, Whereby shall a yong
man redresse or purge his way? It is not
enough to know that I am out of
the way, except I labor to know also,
how I may come into the same
again. It is not enough for a man to
know that he is sick, except he study
also, to know whereby hee may
attaine to his perfect health againe.
When a man is in a great danger or
peril, his chiefe deuising is how to
come out of it. It is not enough to
know that I am in prison, except I
labor how to be freed: Youth for
the most part walketh &amp; loueth to
walke in that broad &amp; by-way of
liberty, where there is no restraint
or curbing of the affections, and
lusts of the flesh for a time delighting
in vaine and transitorie pleasures,
which carieth a momentary

sweetnesse with them to the flesh,
but leaueth behind them eternall
bitternes to the soule, this way is a
strait and darke prison in the end.
It is a by-way that bringeth wearinesse
to the soule, the walking
therein, is in great perill, and the
foote-steps thereof woundeth the
conscience, therefore it is not enough
to know &amp; see that it is euil,
erronious and vncleane, but they
must also earnestly seeke after the
right way and follow it, Whereby
they may redresse and purge their wayes.
The Prophet of God, Ierem. 6. 16.
commandeth and sheweth this dutie
to old and yong, in these words:
Thus saith the Lord, Stand in the wayes
and behold, and aske for the olde way,
which is the good way, and walke therein,
and ye shall find rest for your soules. Paul
obserued this, when hee said, Lord,
What shall I doe? The yong man in
the Gospell that came to Christ, obserued
this also, when he said; Master,
What shall I doe to obtaine eternall
life? The Iewes that were pricked in

conscience at Peters sermon obserued
this, when they inquired one
another; Men and brethren what shall
we doe? The Iailer, Act. 16. 30. obserued
this, when he fel downe before
Paul and Sylas, and asked them; Sirs,
what must I doe to be saued. And Christ
Iesus the way it self, teacheth vs the
same duty, whē he cōmādeth; Search
the Scriptures, for it is they that testifie of
me. Let all young men therefore,
who desire to bee esteemed true
Christians, and hauing a name to
be alive in Christ, not to bee dead,
inquire of their owne waies, carefully,
narrowly, &amp; vnpartially, acknowledging
truely and in most
submissiue manner confessing before
the throne of almighiy God,
their errors and manifold enormities,
with an earnest and hearty desire
to know and practise, wherewith
they may redresse and purge
their waies, and walke in the immaculate
and holy waies of God
and his commandements, and for
all, propone and set before their

eyes the example of that forenamed
young man onely in the Gospel,
that imitating him they may
addresse themselues in prayer and
meditation to Iesus Christ and his
word, making it their chiefe care
and inquirie to know and practise,
how they may attaine vnto eternall
life. Blessed is the condition
of such a young man who doth so,
and who in all humilitie doth daily
prostrate himselfe vpon the knees
of his heart before the throne of
the maiestie of God, earnestly desiring
and wishing with the same
Prophet in the 5. verse, O that my
waies were directed to keepe thy statutes
O Lord. Happy is the estate of such
a young man, and farre happy shal
it be hereafter, whose delight is in
Gods word, &amp; care to reforme and
conform his waies according thervnto.
As woful &amp; dangerous is the
conditiō of the contrary of all such
who like vnbridled horses, vntamed
colts, &amp; swine wallowing in
the mire &amp; puddle of vncleannes,

onely rauished in the hote furie of
the lustes of their affections, and
led by the fearefull hand of sinne,
and vaine pleasures of the flesh:
vntill blindlings (as the Oxe is led
to the slaughter, or the foole to the
blocke) they bee drawne downe
the staires of perdition, and headlongs
precepitat in the deepe gulfe
and p
                  •
               t of vtter destruction, because
in time of their youth they
neither enquired, obserued, nor examined
their wayes, nor by Gods
word sought to redresse and purge
the same.
            Now concerning the first thing
particularly to bee considered in
the question, or first part of this
Verse, which is the person concerning
whom the same is mooued.
He is set downe to be a Yong
man, so described by the adiunct of
age, (albeit, some others (as Augustine)
meaneth a newe or regenerate
man hereby, albeit decrepite
in age, as Aristotle in his Ethicks distinguisheth
betwixt Iuuenis etate,

therefore &amp; indefinitely, without
limitation or exemption of any,
that the person concerning whom
this question is propounded, is
saide, to bee a yong man, whither
poore or rich, noble or ignoble,
mightie or impotent, the princes
or the beggers sonne, or what
soeuer he be, we learne; First, that
this exhortation (as al Gods word)
is indifferently spoken to all yong
men▪ 
               For with God there is no respect of
persons: and therefore that all yong
men, great or smal, should hearken
thereunto, and apply the same particularly
to their owne consciences.
For from the kings sonne to the
poore beggers, all are his creatures
alike, and God their only Creator,
their beginning is all one, for out
of the dust were they taken, and
their end equally, shal be al one, for
to dust they shall returne: all came
equally, naked out of the wombe,
and all shall goe the same way, to

the graue and corruption. Sickenes
cōmeth alike, &amp; Deaths Sythe
cutteth downe both as grasse equally:
all liue one naturall life vpon
the earth, and draw their breath
equally; and all liue one supernaturall
life in Iesus Christ equally, the
naturall food of the mortall bodies
of both, is the same, to wit, meate
and drinke; the supernaturall food
of the immortall soules of both, is
likewise the same, euen the body
and blood of Iesus Christ, who hath
redeemed both alike by his death,
and sanctifieth both alike by his
viuificating spirit, vnto the life of
righteousnesse: one Iudgement abideth
both, without respect, and
one reward is to both, the pledges
of the kingdome of God, which
are his Word and Sacraments, are
alike offered, and should be alike
administrated to both: the mightiest
Monarch as the poorest begger,
boh are equally the sonnes of
the first Adam, &amp; the poorest begger,
aswell as the mightiest Monarch

is equally the sonne and
member of the second Adam Iesus
Christ, if in him he obey Gods wil,
and apply to his soule his promises
by faith; as in the first Adam he disobeyed
Gods wil, by misbeleeuing
of his threatnings; yea, as Lazarus
was preferred before Diues, so are
many outcasts of the world, before
the mightiest Powers and Princes
thereof, Gods law equally bindeth
both great &amp; small, his threatnings
for sin, appertaine equally to both,
and are alike executed vpon them
without any exception or exemption
of persons, as his sweet promises
of mercy belongeth also and are
equally offered to both. All are alike
admonished in his woorde
taught, and rebuked by the same,
and before all mens eies indifferently
is set downe therein life and
death to choose. Therefore let no
man, rich or poore, exempt himself
from the exhortations, admonitions,
reprehensions, or any part of
the word of God, but as they are
spoken to all, so particularly let

euery one apply them to his owne
soule and conscience, they are the
King of kings statutes, binding
and pertaining to all his subiects,
as well of highest as of lowest place
and degre; and especially let euery▪
               yong man (whatsoeuer he be, hearken
to this Exhortation of Gods
word and spirit, in this place; and
learne, Whereby to redresse his wayes?
            
            The second obseruation, and Lesson
here-upon,The 2. vse. which the Prophet
would haue euery one to marke
and consider, is this: That in our
youth and first age, we must begin
then to serue God, in vprightnes
and holines of life, without any
further delay or procrastination of
time; not sacrificing our childehood
or youth to the idoll of our
owne affections, and the deuill (as
these Idolaters did their children
to Molech) and thinking that God
will accept of our decrepite, cold
old age, when coldly we shall offer
the same vnto him: but as hee will
haue the euening sacrifice of age,

so wil he haue the morning oblation
of youth, as he hath giuen life to
al ages, so by all ages he wil be serued,
and being all to all, by all, in all
he wil be worshipped. The Lord is
Alpha, and Omega, the first and the
last, the beginning and the end: he
will be honored therfore as well in
the Alpha or the beginning of our
youth and first age, as hee will in
the Omega, or end of our last olde
age: hee is strength, and giueth
strength to all; in this our strength
then of youth, we must not rise against
God, and runne with the diuill,
but as Gideon in his strength
was commanded by Gods angel to
rise against the Midianites, &amp; fight
against his enemies: so by Gods
owne word, and the holy messenger
of his spirit, euery yong man is
commanded in the strength of his
youth to rise against, fight and subdue
his owne corrupt affections,
which are enemies to God and his
own saluation, so that in our youth
we must begin and serue God, amend

and redresse our waies according
to his word, not excluding,
but in euery age wee haue
neede and must doe so, and the rather
(seeing a maiori ad minus) if
Gods word serue to redresse a yong
mans way, who burneth in his lusts
and affections, much more serueth
it to redresse a man in ripe age, his
affections being thē more cooled:
but chiefly in youth we haue most
neede by Gods word to cleanse
and redresse our waies, for sundry
reasons.
            First, because our nature
then (which contraries grace) is
strongest; and so wee are more apt
and readie to bee led away by our
lustes, and to bee drawne in the
chaine of our affections by Sathan
into a farre countrie of sinne, from
our owne fathers house with that
prodigall sonne, to abuse and riotously
to consume Gods liberall
giftes and manifolde graces bestowed
vppon vs in pouertie, nakednesse,

and famine of all
goodnesse, feeding our filthy
vncleane lustes of the flesh, and
greedily feeding and eating with
them. Therefore in most dangerous
estate wee must take the
best and straitest heede, when
our enemie is within walls, then
most strongly and couragiously
must hee bee resisted, when
wee finde our nature most inclining
to obey sinne, then must
wee striue and wrestle with
GOD in most earnest prayers,
and hold him fast, vntill hee
giue vs his blessing, and the
strength of his Spirite to striue
also and preuaile with sinne, that
our nature by his grace may bee
reformed, our will made conformable,
and inclining to his, and
that in soule and bodie wee may
bow in obeying his Commaundements.
            Secondly, our youth is the
beginning of our pilgrimage,

and in it, we must enter in, either at
the broad way which leadeth vnto
euerlasting destruction, or at the
narrow way which leadeth vnto euerlasting
ioy and saluation. The
true way is Iesus Christ, and his
righteousnes: (I am the way, the veritie
and life) who as he is the way, so
he is the end of the way, eternall saluation;
as he is God, so he leadeth vnto
God, and to the kingdome of God,
his father: and is the ease and rest of
all that commeth loaden or wearie
vnto him. Therefore in thy
youth, and entring in thy pilgrimage,
see thou enter in this way,
and if thou wouldst finde this way
to walke therein, desire God to opē
thy eies, that thou mayst see this
narrow way: Search the Scriptures,
(saith the way it selfe) for they are
that testifie of me. When thou hast
found him in his word, and known
him by his word, (as the sheepe
doth the true sheep-heard) apply
him then by a liuely faith to thy
soule, and take hold of the way.

and hauing found, knowne, applied,
and taken hold of him, then apply
thy whole course of life, in
thought, word and deede vnto this
way, euer walking therin, Be you holy
as I am holy (saith he;) Learne of me,
for I am humble and meeke. Moses was
commanded to pull off his shooes,
because the ground hee did stand
vpon was holy. If thou stand t
                  ••
               n
vpon that holy ground, &amp; ground-stone
Iesus Christ, &amp; walke in that
sacred pure way, thou must seperate
and cast from thee all filthinesse
of sinne and corruption. If
thou wouldst walke with that vnspotted
Lambe, thou must walke
clothed with that white long robe
of sanctitie &amp; righteousnesse, purchased
and washed in his blood:
beleeue Christ Iesus in thy heart,
confesse Christ Iesus with thy
mouth, and shew Christ Iesus and
him image in thy life and conuersation;
so hast thou enterd, so doost
thou walke, &amp; so shalt thou attaine
to the end of this true and ioyfull

way. All other waies are by-waies,
the leader and ladder Sathan, a
manslaier, a lyer from the beginning;
and the end of al such is Gods
fierce wrath and eternall perdition,
hee leadeth thee from the true
Citie of Ierusalem in his deceitfull
by-waies, to rob thee of the good
gifts of God bestowed vpon thee,
and to kill body &amp; soule, and cast
it into vtter darkenesse: like a wise
Vlisses harken not to this Syren, who
would allure and draw thee so, to
no sweete harmony, but to destroy
the ship of the body, and precious
loading of thy soule, (for which
christ shed his precious blood) vpō
the rocks of eternal destruction, to
be his pray. Auoide this Scylla and
Carybdis, and hold constantly forward
in the true way Christ, enter
and perseuere in it in thy youth, &amp;
when thou art aged thou shalt bee
at the end thereof, that thou maiest
see with the holy Apostle,2. Tim. 4. 7. when
the time of thy departing is at
hand, I haue sought a good fight, and

haue finished my course. I haue kept the
faith: for henceforth is laid vp for mee the
crowne of righteousnesse, which the Lord
the righteous Iudge shall giue mee at that
day; and not vnto me onely, but vnto a
                     •
                  l
them that loue his appearing. Lorde
grant that euery one of vs may in
our youth enter in this course, constantly
continue therein t
                  •
               ll our

                  ••
               ues end, and at our last dissolution
we may haue this sure and comfortable
perswasion.
            Thirdly, we should serue God in
our youth, chiefly obeying his wil,
and abstaining from sinne, because
our youth is as the fat, most pleasant
vnto God, not sinning in it
when we may sinne, and therefore
let vs sacrifice the same vnto him,
not offering vp the fat morning
sacrifice of our youth to Molech, the
diuell and our sinfull corrupt affections,
and thinking that the God
of Israel wil accept of our leane and
lame colde euening sacrifice of
weake olde age, and so bee serued
with the worst after his enemie Sathan.

In our youth wee must not
runne with the diuell, and in age
thinke to returne vnto God, neuer
forsaking our lusts, nor ceasing to
fulfill them in our youth, till then
in age they forsake vs, with the
strength to accomplish them; whē
we are strongest wee are weake enough
to follow Christ: much
more vnable when wee are weakest.
Therefore as Dauid killed Goliah
in his youth, so let vs seeke to
slay that manslayer Sathan, in resisting
him, and kill that Goliah of sin
and our corrupt affections, which
hee vseth as weapons against vs,
putting off all fleshly armour, and
arming body and soule with the
strength of Gods Spirit, putting
our trust and sure confidence in Iesus
Christ, (who as by former experience)
he did ouercome his tentations
in his owne person, and in
the persons of all the Saints, his elect
members, so likewise of his
constant loue, vnfallible trueth,
and vnfaileable strength, hee will

assist and persist with vs, vntill wee
haue likewise troden him vnder
foote. As Dauid being young, did
pull out a Lambe out of the mouth
of the Lyon and the Beare, so by
resisting that cruell raging Lyon
Sathan, who daily seeketh how to
deuoure our soules and bodies,
which the Lambe of GOD hath
bought to himselfe. Let vs by the
strength of Gods Spirit, redeeme
our selues frō his destroying iawes,
and in our youth shewe Gods
strength in vs, and while wee are
young men, let vs cast off the olde
man of sinne, and concupiscence of
the flesh, and put on Iesus Christ
the new man, walking with him in
righteousnesse &amp; holinesse of life,
a glorious garment, and blessed
companion. As Sampson being a
young man, killed the Philistims,
the enemies of God and his people;
so in our youth, let vs endeuour
by the speciall assistance of
Gods grace, &amp; strength of his powerfull
Spirit, to kill, ouercome, and

subdue the cruell enemies of God,
and our owne soules saluation, sin
and our corrupt affections, whom
we beare about in our mortall bodies,
and who dippeth in the platter
with vs, yet like so many Iudases
seeking to betray vs in the
hands and power of our malitious
and cruel enemie Sathan: they giue
vs their sweete milke to drinke, but
for our destruction: they make vs
sleepe vpon their knees, but to abrace
our strength, and to make
God abrace our name out of the
booke of life, to betray vs trecherously
into the hands of our persecuting
enemie, and to cut off our
heads in the midst of our drunken
sleepe of sinne, yea they sleep with
vs, as a snake in our bosom to sting
vs to eternall death: suspect then
their venome, and the
                  ••
                deceitfull
wicked purpose; let them not keep
thee vnder the yoake of their slauerie,
but keepe them vnder thy
commandements &amp; rule, and subjugate
thy necke vnder the light

and easie yoake of Iesus Christ, to
obey him in all the powers of thy
soule, and members of thy body,
that so here on earth, thou maiest
be a member of his body militant
and suffering, &amp; in heauen hereafter
a glorified &amp; triumphant member
in eternal ioyes, &amp; so thou shalt
be happy &amp; reioyce that euer thou
didst suffer the yoake in thy youth.
Saul, Dauid, Salomō, with many others
in the Scripture, were called to be
Kings, being yong men; but wee
in our youth are called to a more
ample, glorious, and permanent
a kingdome, to bee kings and coheyres
with Iesus Christ, the onely
begotten and welbeloued Sonne
of God, in that eternall kingdome
of his Father, which hee hath prepared
for vs, taken possession himselfe
before vs, and granted vs here
on earth, the pledge of his holy
Spirit to begin our ioyes, and his
holy Sacraments as seales of his
kingdome: who will then deny
such a honour in his youth, to be a

glorious King with Iesus Christ?
Salomon in his greatest glory, was
not so gloriously clothed, as one of
the white Lillies of the field; but,
when thou shalt bee cloathed with
the white long robe of the righteousnesse
of Iesus Christ, crowned
with an incorruptible crowne of
glory and life, in euer-permanent
ioyes eternally to remayne, to behold
the glorious face of the lambe
of God, associated to the blessed
Angels and infinite companies of
the glorified spirits &amp; Saynts, praising
continually, and extolling his
iustice, and the infinite mercy and
loue of the Lambe, before his
Throne in light perpetuall, in glory
vnspeakeable, &amp; ioyes that cannot
be expressed, how blessed and
happy shall bee thy estate in this
kingdome? to day thou art called
to it yong, to morrow thou knowest
not if thou shalt enter by the
passeouer of death in full possession
thereof; while then it is offred,
possesse thy selfe to day with the

pledge and rights of it, walke in
the true way to it, that at thy iourneyes
end, thou mayst be crowned
an immortall King: procrastinate
therefore no time; it is a gift, and a
great gift, when God holdeth out
his hand in thy youth, to offer thee
the rights and pledges of his kingdome,
the sooner thereby to thy
greater comfort, to possesse thee
with them; and yet in the meane
time, thou pull in thy hand from receyuing
them, vntill thou prooue
the diuels slauerie: verily, when he
hath pulled in his hand agayne, frō
offering, albeit thou neuer so oft
put out thine to receyue, when thou
shalt seeke it, thou shalt not find it:
but as thou refusedst of God in
thy youth to be a king, and accepted
of Sathan to be a slaue: as thou
refusedst to remaine in thy fathers
house, and to eate at his table, but
wandring in a farre countrie, yeelded
to be a Farmers hyreling, and
to eate with swine: so, except Gods
extraordinary mercy, &amp; the beams

of his vnsearchable loue shine vpon
thee, thou maiest expect in age,
but terrour and fearefull torment
of conscience, and hereafter to receyue
the iust reward and hyre of
thy slauery in the bottomlesse sinck
and deepe pit of perdition, in endlesse
and easelesse torments, with
Sathan thy master. In thy youth,
then accept to be a king of God,
receyūe the rights and pledge of
the Kingdome in thy heart, shew
that thou hast them by thy speeches,
thy workes, and an holy life,
speake the language of the Kingdome,
&amp; learne it dayly, more and
more, which is prayer and praysing
of God: the kingdome, whereof
thou art made an heyre, is Heauen,
wilt thou know thy selfe, and make
others also know, if truely thou belong
to this Kingdome, let thy
thoughts bee heauenly, thy words
be heauenly, gratious to God and
man, and offensiue iustly to none,
thy works and actions also heauenly
and vpright before God &amp; man,

doing good according to thy power
to all, euill or the least iniury to
none, no, not to thy enemy; but
good for euill in word and worke;
let all thy conuersation and course
of life, priuate and publike, be heauenly,
as a lampe shining before others,
that resembling thy Fathers
conditions, and bearing his image
in thy life, thou maiest bee knowne
to be a childe and sonn of the King
of heauen, and sometimes to bee a
crowned king there thy selfe, when
thy father shal call thee home from
thy trauelling, to thy natiue country
and kingdome, as on earth in
good example thou shined as a
lampe before others, so then in heauen
to shine in glory as a bright
lampe before his throne.
            But some would thinke, that this
exhortation of redressing our waies,
had beene fitter for olde men then
for youth, because they are nearer
death, &amp; giuing of account of their
waies where young men seeth that
they may die, they 
                  •
               ee that they

die, and youth must haue it owne
course, and therefore their faults
are not so much to bee obserued,
seeing they are rather 
                  
                     •
                  tatis then
hominis, and so in time enough
they may returne from their yong
courses when age breaketh them,
and become good and graue men
at last.
            To such I answere, that such
excuses as these, are but impostures
of Sathan and the flesh: age
hath neede to see they end well, the
claudite of their life, with a ioyfull
plaudite of the assurance of Gods
fauour; and youth must take
heede also that they beginne well
the fable of their life: if they bee
all vppon their pleasures in the
beginning and first part, it is like
to prooue a Tragedie, with a
lamentable and sorrowfull ende
in the last parte. If thy youth
bee a battle, and troublesome at
the beginning to subdue thy rebelling
affections against Gods
Spirit, surely thy age, the ende

of the Comedie shall bring rest,
ioy, victorie, and peace vnto
thy soule. And therefore saith
Ieremie, It is good for a man to beare
the yoake in his youth.
               Lam. 3. 27. When Christ
came many thousand yeares after
hee was promised,Gen. 3. and did
cast out Diuells,Mat. 8. 29. yet they saide;
hee did torment them before the time: so
whensoeuer thou euen in thy olde
age, goest about to dismisse thy
sinnes and pleasures, they will
say notwithstanding, that thou
dismissest them before time. Sathan
is a lyar from the beginning,
in saying to Eu
                     •
                  , Thou shalt not die:
so when in thy youth hee saith;
that it is not time as yet to dispossesse
him out of thy heart, and dismisse
thy sinnes and vaine pleasures
of youth, hee is a lyer, beleeue
him not. Hee saith; Reioyce
O young man in thy youth, and
let thy heart cheere thee in the daies of
thy youth, and walke in the waies
of thy heart, and in the sight of thy eyes,
eate and drinke (with the rich foole)

               follow thy pleasures and bee secure, for
thou hast many yeares before thee, thou
shalt not die. But the trueth of God
warneth thee, that thou must know for
all these thinges God will bring thee to
iudgement:
               Eccles 11. 9. 
               therfore take away that griefe
out of thy heart, and cause euill to depart
from thy flesh, for childhood and youth are
vanitie. Sathan counselleth vs to remember
our selues and our owne
lusts in our youth; but the spirit of
God saith; Remember thy Creatour in
the daies of thy youth: shewing that all
the sinnes of our youth, proceedeth
from our forgetfulnesse of
God, as all our obedience commeth
from this remembrance of
him, considering that God created
vs for this end, that in righteousnes
and holines we should onely serue
him here on earth for a while, and
eternally hereafter with himselfe
in heauen enioy euerlasting felicitie:
he created vs out of the dust of
the earth, and wee know not now
how soone wee must returne thither
againe in childhood, youth,

middle or olde age: therefore in all
ages we must remember our Creator
&amp; the end of our creation, all
things were created for our vse &amp;
comfort, and wee onely for Gods
glory: therefore let vs so shine before
others, that they seeing our
good works, God may be glorified
by vs. No child can forget his
father, God is our father, &amp; therefore
none too yong to remember
him; this thing the naturall child
and sonne of God, Iesus Christ,
taught vs to remember, when hee
commaunded vs to say, Our Father,
&amp;c. Shall wee say so in our
mouth (being yong) and not shew
him to be so in our life; as we pray
so to God, so we must professe before
man. Why call ye me, Lord, Lord,
and do not those things which I command
you? (saith Christ:) Therefore as
Abraham, beeing commanded by
God,Gen. 22. 3, did rise earely in the morning,
to sacrifice his yong sonne
Izhac; so in the morning of thy life
earely, (as thou art commanded

likewise by Gods word) thou must
offer vp thy selfe being yong, a liuing
sacrifice vnto God, hauing
the life of Christ, which is true
righteousnes in thee, God requireth
the first borne for his offering,
so God requireth thee when
thou art first borne, from thy birth,
with Samuel to bee offred and consecrated
to his seruice and obedience.
So soone as thou art borne,
thou art baptized in the name of
Iesus Christ, shewing, that when
thou art scarce out of the house of
thy mothers wombe, he will haue
thee entered in his house and family,
when thou canst not goe vnto
him, thou shouldest creepe vnto
him, seruing him (as thou mayest)
in all ages. In the fayth, wherein
thou art baptized, thou sayest, I beleeue,
&amp;c. not, I will beleeue hereafter.
If then in thy youth, thou
wouldest not bee counted an infidell,
but a true beleeuer in Iesus
Christ, thou must shew thy true
faith by workes and holinesse of

life: hast thou receyued Christs
name vpon thee, see if thou hast
Christs nature? otherwise thou
pertaynest not to him. In thy Baptisme,
thou vowedst and sworest to
serue him in holinesse all thy life,
and receiuedst his name &amp; badge:
wilt thou then presently after, in
thy youth, mocke God? keepe still
his name, but serue the diuell in
thy affections and lusts, which thou
promisedst then to mortifie? The
first fruits were for Gods seruice:
in thy youth thou must also bestow
thy first fruits vpon the seruice
of God, and, not giuing the
first sommer fruit that is sweet, to
the diuell; and the last winter fruit
which are sowre grapes to God:
when wee pray as Christ hath
taught vs, we say first: Hallowed be
thy Name: thy kingdome come: thy will
be done in earth, as it is in heauen, before
that we desire, this day our dayly
bread: if then wee seeke Gods
glory, and that Gods will may bee
done by vs, before wee aske that

food, by which we are preserued,
and liue, how much more should
wee seeke the same, before our
pleasures and the accomplishment
and fulfilling of our lustes and

                  •
               innes, whereby we perish and die:
Christ saith, First seeke the kingdome
of heauen, and all other things shall bee
cast vpon you. Philosophie saith;

                  
                     •
                  rimum quaerite bona animi, catera aut
aderunt, aut certe non oberunt: First
seek the goods of the mind (which
is vertue &amp; piety) and other things
shall eyther be present, or, if absent,
they shall not hinder you: if
then by Christs commandement,
we must first seeke after the kingdome
of God, and by Philosophy
to seeke after vertue and pietie to
be planted in our minds, shall wee
then first in our youth, seeke after
our owne pleasures, the kingdome
of Sathan, and to root in our hearts
all vice and vngodlines? God forbid:
when Christ sayeth to vs, Follow
me; with his Disciples, leauing
our nets and deuises in the sea of

the world, to catch profit or pleasure,
we must obey and follow him
straight, if euer we would be coū
               ted
his Disciples: when he asketh
vs, with Peter, if we loue him in our
youth, we must answere, Yea, Lord,
I loue thee, and not say, when I haue
fulfilled the lusts of my youth, then
I wil loue thee. This is the acceptable
time,2. Co
                     •
                  . 6, 2. this is the day of saluation,
today, if we will heare his voyce:
for whosoeuer commeth not at
Gods callings, whatsoeuer he say,
it is impossible that hee should resolue
to come hereafter when hee
pleaseth; for, beeing euill, can
hee resolue to bee good? A dry
dead tree, which is withered, and
bringeth no fruite in the Sommer,
nor buddeth in the Spring,
can it bring forth pleasant and
sweet fruit in the cold winter? so,
eyther nowe in our youth let vs
serue God, or neuer exspect that
wee can hereafter being hindred
by many abstractions and cares of
the world: but if now resolutely we

begin; that same God who gaue
the will and the begining, will also
giue perseuerance &amp; a perfect end.
Therefore now or neuer, now &amp;
euer: life and death is set before
our eyes. How soone soeuer as the
Lord distributed his talents, hee
commaunded his seruants immediately
to vse them, and giue them
out to vsury. Now who is so yong
but God hath giuen him some talent;
to vse the same, to his glorie
and honor, which if it be vnlawefull
to hide in the earth, how much
more to abuse and consume it to
the dishonor of his Maister, and
his owne destruction. When God
had created the heauen and the
earth, the first thing hee did afterwardes,
was, that he separated the
light from darknes, that we might
learne to separate good from euill,G
                     •
                  n. 1. 14.
before wee should confound and
make our good become euill. Sathan
is the prince of darknes; sinne
is darknes it selfe: wilt thou then
cōuert Gods graces into this darknes?

and yet thinke thou canst retaine
the light of God? There is no societie
betwixt God and Belial.
Darknes &amp; light cannot remaine
both in one place: therfore in thy
youth loue the light, embrace the
good, and abstaine from all apparance
of euill.
               1. Thes. 5. 22. Dedicate thy youth to
God, who reneweth the same, as the
Eagles.Vers. 103.

               Prou. 23. 26. The way to heauen is
like Iacobs Ladder, &amp; it hath foure
steppes. First, to beginne betime,
following Christs example in this,Matur

                  .
as in al the rest; seeing as in heauen
now he is our patron, so then on
earth he was our paterne, to which
we must conforme all our life. At
twelue yeares of age, he was found
in the Temple of Ierusalem doeing his
Fathers busines,
               Luke. 2. 46. in hearing &amp; asking
questions of the learned Doctors:
so his first step to heauen, was, in
his child-hood he began to do his

Fathers will; and 
                  〈◊〉
                would follow
his foot-steps, to come likewise
to heauen, wee must also in
our child-hood and youth, learne
the knowledge of God, and to
practise the same, in our life and
conuersation.
                  Properè Psal. 119. 32. The second step to
heauen, is, to hasten &amp; make speed;
herein also following our Masters
example, who in the short time of
his life here, spake and did more
things, then (if they were written)
the world could cōtaine the books
thereof, as testifieth St. Iohn: as we
shold also aboūd in good &amp; godly
works.I

                The third, to perseuere and
keepe the right way: for hee said,
Who can accuse me of sinne? And albeit
many false witnesses came against
him, they could finde nothing
to accuse him of justlie; as
we should take heed, that we suffer
not by euill doeing, but bee vnblameable
before all men.Constanter. And
fourthly, stedfastlie to continue:
for as hee was the Lambe of God,
so he dyed innocently, and meekely
as a lambe; praying for his enimies:

and whosoeuer constantlie
continueth with him, faithfull vnto
death, as hee hath promised, so
he will giue them,Reu. 2. 10. the crowne of
life. This is the way, by which, the
way it selfe, hath gone before vs to
heauen; so he, as our Captaine, and
his footesteps, as our directions, we
must follow, if wee looke for any
portion in his glorious kingdome
with him. Therefore, let all youth
learne to begin betime, and tread
his first footesteppe to heauen, not
thinking that in youth, he may run
downe with Sathan, to the lowest
step of the staires of sinne and perdition,
and in age hee may creepe
vp from thence, &amp; flie to the highest
step of Iacobs Ladder. Neither
that in youth he may take his pleasures,
delaying and dallying with
them a while, thinking all sinnes of
youth to b

               e veniall: no, the holy
Prophet Dauid desireth God earnestly,
and importunately intreateth
him; that he would not Remember
the sinnes of his youth, (being a

man according to Gods own heart)
&amp; he calleth thē, his rebellions; shewing
as rebelliō is highest treason vnto
earthly Princes, so the sins of our
youth, is highest treason &amp; rebelliō
to God our Father, being most strongest,
as our naturall corruption is so
thē, of which they proceed; &amp; therfore
most offensiue. And truly, if the
dedicatiō of our youth to Gods seruice
be most pleasāt to him, thē the
dedication of the same to the diuels
seruice, is most displeasant and grieuous
in his sight: God is that foūtain
&amp; wel-spring of all true wisedome.
In our youth then let vs desire that
true wisedome with Salomon, to dwel
in our hearts, and honour &amp; riches
shal euer accōpanie the same, as the
shaddow doth the body inseperably.
Wisedome saith; They which seeke me

                  rly shal find me:
               Prou. 8. but to thē which delaieth
seeking of her till age come
vpō them, she saith; Ye shal seek me, but
you shall not finde mee: seeke her then,
and take hold of her in thy youth,
that thou maiest reape the fruites
thereof in thy age. It is written,

whē Christ heard the yong mā
in the Gospel answere him; that he
had kept all the Commandements
from his youth, that Christ began
to loue him, to shew how well
Christ loueth these timely beginnings,
when in our childhoode and
youth wee cleaue to him as our
Nurse, and sucketh the milke of
godlinesse from his breasts. Manna
was gathered in the morning
before the hot rising of the Sunne,
which would melt it away: so early
in the morning of our youth, we
must gather &amp; eate of Iesus Christ,
that true Manna, the foode of our
soules, wee must learne true godlinesse
and vertue, before the hoat
sunne of our lustes and pleasures
make it to melt away faster thē we
can gather the same. We must bee
like the wise yong Virgins, to prepare
our oyle, and dresse our lamps
in time, not knowing in our youth
or age, when the Bridegroome
shall call vpon vs. It is said, that a
new vessell euer sauoureth of that

liquor wherewith it is first seasoned,
according to the Latine prouerbe,
Quod noua testa capit, in
                     •

Test

                   diu.
            
            In our youth therefore we must infuse
in our harts, &amp; season thē with
such liquor, as may make vs in
age, smell well in the nosthrills of
God our father, (as Esaus garments
did to Isaac) that so we may obtaine
that euerlasting blessing: and this
liquor is godlinesse and sanctification,
thorow the blood and garment
of the righteousnesse of Iesus
Christ our elder brother and Sauiour.
Samuel began to serue God
in his infancie, and continued still:
Sampson was a Nazarite, consecrated
to God from his birth:2. Tim. 3. 15. 
               Timothie
is praised of Paul; That hee did know
the Scriptures of a child, which were able
to make him wise vnto saluation, through
the faith which is in Iesus Christ: Iohn the
Baptist, as he grew in yeares, so he
waxed strong in spirit.Luke. 
                     •
                  . 80. So likewise,

euery yong man must striue to do,
to consecrate himselfe from the
wombe to the graue, in the seruice
of God, and to deserue that good
commendation of Timothy, from his
childhood to know the holy Scriptures,
which may teach &amp; instruct
him in righteousnesse, as a Master;
which may improoue and correct
his faults, as a Father, and make
him a man of God absolute &amp; perfite
vnto all good works.
            The third lesson and obseruation
is to fathers of youth,The 3. Vse. as the first
was to youth it selfe: and it is, that
as young men in their youth must
learne and practise godlinesse, in
redressing of their waies according
to Gods word: so the fathers
of all youth, must beginne to teach
the same vnto them, and go before
their children in good example of
life while they are tender, and as
new vessells fit to receiue and
be seasoned with piety. Gods commaundement
in his word concerning
this dutie of parents, is, Deutronomie,

4. 9. But take heede to thy
selfe, and keepe thy soule diligently, that
thou forget not the thinges which thine
eyes haue seene, and that they depart not
out of thine heart all the daies of thy life,
but teach them thy sonnes, and thy
sonnes sonnes. Againe, Deutronomie,
6. 7. where hee saith; And thou shalt
re

                  earse them continually vnto thy children,

                  riestin thine house, and as thou walkest
by the way, and when thou liest downe,
and when thourisest vp. Moreouer,
Deutronomie, 32. 46. in Moses last
exhortation to Israel; Then hee saide
vnto them, Set your hearts vnto all the
wordes which I testifie against you this
day, that you may command them vnto
your children, that they may obserue and
doe all the words of this Law. Likewise
the Apostle, Ephes. 6. 4. And yee fathers
prouoke not your children to wrath,
but bring them vp in instruction &amp; information
of the Lord. So Psal. 78. 5. How
he established a testimony in Iacob, and
ordained a law in Israel, which hee commanded
our fathers that they should teach

their children. Also the practise of all
the godly hath euer been so, according
to this cōmandemēt of God.
Adam taught his sonnes to sacrifice
and offer to the Lord. The
three Angels that came to Abraham,
they reuealed vnto him the
destru
                  •
               tion of Sodome, because
the Lord did know that he would
teach this his iudgement for sinne
to the posteritie after him.Gen. 18. 17. 19. 
               And the
Lord said, shall I hide from Abraham that
thing which I doe? For I know him that he
will command his sonnes and his houshold
after him, that they keepe the way of the
Lord, to doe righteousnesse and iudgement,
that the Lord may bring vpon Abraham
that he hath spoken vnto him. Isaac being
a young childe, yet was well
instructed in the typicall seruice of
God, and things pertaining vnto
the sacrifice of the old Law, when
he asked his father; Behold the fire and
the wood,
               Gen. 22. 7. 8. 
               but where is the lambe for the

                     •
                  urnt offering? And he answered; My
sonne, God will prouide him a lambe, &amp;c.
His exercise also when hee was a

young man, by his fathers instruction
and example was,Gen. 24. 36. 
               And Isaac
went out to pray in the field toward the euening,
&amp;c. So Ioshua in his last commandement
&amp; exhortation to Israel,
saith vnto them; And if it seeme euill
vnto you to serue the Lord, choose you this
day whom you will serue, &amp;c. but I and
my house will serue the Lord. With sundry
such examples in the Scripture,
where we may see the practise
and care of all the godly, to haue
beene euer in instructing &amp; bringing
vp their children in the knowledge
and feare of God, which all
godly Christian parents in this
age must follow likewise: for if
God hath established his couenant
betweene vs and our seed after vs,Gen. 17. 7.
to be our God for euer: how carefull
should wee then be, that our
seede and children may be instructed
in the true and perfect knowledge
thereof, that as hee is their
God, so they may bee his people;
as hee is their father, so they may
proue his children by dutifull loue

and obedience to his commandements.
It is said, that Alexander had
children borne and brought vp in
military discipline and exercise,
from their infancie in his Campes,
which made him so victorious and
prosperous in battell: euen so let all
parents bring vp their children
from their infancie and cradle, in
the knowledge and exercise of the
Christian warfare of this life, in all
godlinesse &amp; vertue, that they may
proue couragious and good souldiers
vnder their victorious King
and Captaine Iesus Christ. And
seeing youth is as tabula rasa, a new
vessell, a young tree, or Oliue plant
(as Dauid calleth them) like soft
waxe to receiue any print, inconstant
and wauering, and most inclining
by their owne nature to sinne
and vaine pleasure, which euen
godly Iob suspected in his children,
albeit well and godly brought vp,
when he went to sacrifice for them
daily, fearing it might haue beene
that his sonnes in their banquetting

had sinned, and blasphemed
God in their hearts. Therefore let
all fathers, as God hath giuen them
children of his grace: so with Hannah,
Samuels mother, dedicate and
giue them againe vnto the Lord
and his seruice, in bringing them
vp carefully in the feare and reuerence
of his holy name: season their
tender hearts in their youth, with
the liquor of godlinesse, and the
true knowledge of the blood of Iesus
Christ, which must be their life:
print them with the glorious
image of Christ, which is true pietie,
that as he was the resemblance
of his father, so they may here represent
him also in purenes &amp; sanctitie
of life, while they are as yong
tender twigges and Oliue branches:
bow them that way as you
would haue them stand, when they
are growen and olde, which is to
the obedience of Iesus Christ, in
whom they must beare fruite, and
receiue fatnesse: write and ingraue
the knowledge of his will &amp; commaundements

in their hearts and
mindes, that with all their hearts,
soules, and mindes, they may
honour and serue GOD, in all
feare and loue, a band to holde
out all 
                  •
               inne, and so place and
set them in the right way, see
that they constantly continue and
perseuere therein, and ioyne seuere
and strait animaduersion for
repressing of their vices, as
also of cherishing of Gods good
graces in them, that so they may
bee liuely stones in Sion, to the
glory of God, the comfort of
his parents, and their owne soules
saluation. So parents making them
dutifull to God their heauenly Father,
he will make them dutifull also
and reuerent to them againe: otherwise
with Elias sonnes, they
will be a griefe to their hearts, and
the meanes to bring their gray
haires in sorrow to the graue, and
with Absolon, prooue vnkinde and
vnnaturall children: for being Dauids
darling, he proued Dauids traitour:

                  y; Why hast thou done so? I remember
one example in the Scripture,
of children carelesly &amp; euilly
brought vp, which may make all
fathers tremble &amp; quake, to heare
the fearefull punishment thereof,
and may teach them by carefull
and godly education of their children,
to preuent the like wrath &amp;
iudgement of God, for hee is the
same in all ages, both in iudgement
and mercy.2. King. 2. When the Prophet of
God Elisha was comming vp to Bethel,
there came out of the City certaine
children, and mocked him,
calling him, Balde head, balde
head▪ therefore God in his wrath
sent out Beares out of the wildernesse,
at the Prophets desire, and
they tore &amp; rent 42. of these children
in peeces: a lamentable spectacle,
young children before their
tender parents eies, to be so deuoured
and torne of wilde beastes. But

consider their carelesse and loose
educatiō, which deserued this, they
were not kept in at vertue or learning,
but suffered to runne abroad
in the streetes idlie, they were not
brought vp in the reuerence, neither
of God, his word, or his Prophets,
but to mocke Gods seruants,
and scornefully to ieast at old age,
which they should rather beene
taught to honour and reuerence in
all dutie, and in all persons: therefore,
because their parents neglected
to correct them in time, and to
take no more care for their instruction,
God sent wilde Beares out of
the wildernes (to teach them more
humanitie) and at the Prophets request,
whom they so mocked and
contemned, to bee their correctors
to their destruction. There are too
many such carelesse and indulgent
parents nowadaies, which maketh
so many proue wilde and vndutifull
children, both to God &amp; them;
and their owne wicked and vuruly
affections, oft times proueth these

wilde beares, which Sathan hunteth
out, and God suffereth to teare
their soules (more precious and lamentable
to see) and at last to bring
body &amp; soule to a most miserable
estate, both here by pouerty &amp; dispaire,
&amp; hereafter by death &amp; endlesse
condemnation. The Lord auert
such iudgments from many, &amp;
conuert their hearts to him againe,
that they may preuent his fierce
wrath, while the acceptable time is,
&amp; to day while we heare his voice:
and as yong men should not, so neither
let their parēts think the faults
of youth to be but small, and rather
to be imputed to the nature of the
age: the former searefull example
teacheth the contrary, they being
but children, and their fault mocking,
yet their punishment most
greeuous that God inflicted vpon
them: as Dauid also calleth the sins
of his youth, not smal, but rebellions,
which is highest treason against
our God, the King of Kings, and
Prince of all Princes. Therefore let

all parents be carefull, in the good
and godly education of their children.
Euery tree is knowne by his
fruite: the fruite of the parents, is
their Oliue branches; their children.
Let them shew then their
godlinesse and religion, in the
godly education of their children,
prouing thereby, that themselues
are the good tree, by sending forth
liuely branches, to bee ingrafted
(as themselues are) in the stocke
Iesus Christ, not being too indulgent
to them, nor wincking in a
manner at their faultes: neither
with olde Eli, saying onely; My
sonnes, doe so no more: but to shewe
their loue to their children, in correcting
them for their faultes: For
whom the Father loueth, him hee chastiseth:
               Prou 13. 24.
and, hee that spareth the rod,
hateth his sonne; but hee that loueth
him, chasteneth him bet
                     ••
                  e. Therefore,
as the Wiseman counselleth;Prou. 29. 17.
               Correct thy sonne, and hee will
giue thee rest, and will giue pleasures to
thy soule.
            
            
               And as the vessel which a man maketh
most of, and deareliest esteemeth,
that vseth he oftest to scoure
and make cleane, from the least
spot or staine: so a wise and louing
father, will not suffer his sonne to
be polluted with the least spot of
vice, for chastising is the fathers
honour, and the life of the childe:
So that correction is like Ionathans
arrowes, not in anger, but in loue;
not to harme, but to warme, not to
put in perill, but to preserue from
perill, not to deforme, but to reforme,
like a good corrasiue to eate
away the rottennesse of vice, and a
bitter potion to make their childrē
vomit out from their soule &amp; heart,
the poison of sinne, lest hauing taken
deepe roote, and growing vp
with them, they be so indured and
hardned therein, that they breake
first by finall destruction, before
they will bow by timely instruction,
or holesome correction. Therefore,
so plant them in vertue, and
vertue in them, while they are tender

and flexible in youth, that in
the haruest of age, their tops may
bow downe in Gods obedience,
loaden with the pleasant fruite of
godlinesse and good workes. Teach
a childe in the trade of his way (saith Salomon)
and when he is olde,
               Prou. 22. 6. 
               hee shall not
depart from it. Youth is the seede
time, in the spring wee must not
sowe popple, and in haruest looke
for good wheate; but as wee sowe,
so we shall reape. The Nurse frameth
the body while it is young &amp;
tender; so must parents their childrens
minds, while they are greene
and flexible. If we see a fault or euill
manners in any man, we iudge
that he was euill brought vp; and if
he haue vertue, we adiudge it to his
good education: yea in an old prouerbe
we say, that nurture changeth
nature: as Lycurgus proued before
the Lacedemonians to be true,
by taking two young whelpes of
a like nature, and of one damme,
and bringing vp the one according
to it owne nature in a kitchin,

and the other, besides it proper nature,
to hunting; so that at a certaine
solemne assembly of the Lacedemonians,
Lycurgus brought
forth his two dogges before them,
placing before the one, who was
brought vp to hunting, a pot, and
before the kitchen dog, a hare; but
the hunting dogge in sight of them
all, refused the pot, and ranne after
the hare; where the other, according
to his education, refused to
follow the hare, betaking himselfe
to licke the pot. Whereby it was
shewed, the altering power &amp; efficacy
of educatiō, which is a second
nature (as it were) vnto a mā: for by
euil educatiō, a good nature may be
corrupted, as by good, an euill nature
may be rectified: a good groūd
vnplanted with wholsome hearbs,
or vnsowed with good seed, in time
doth soonest bring forth vnprofitable
and euill weedes; where, on
the contrarie, a barren ground wel
laboured and sowed, produceth
pleasant flowers, and sauorie fruits.

The right blessing, which Parents
should bestow vpon their childrē,
is, when bringing them vp in the
feare of GOD, they make God
blesse them also; for if thou blesse
thy child, &amp; God curse him, what
auayleth thy blessing? but, if thou
bring him vp in the true knowledge
and obedience of Iesus
Christ, to thy blessing, God and
Angels shall say, Amen, and hee
shall heape, both vpon thee, and
thy seede after thee, manifold and
great blessings, as hee blesseth all
those, who doe his will, and curseth
them that keepe not his commandements:
as God hath commanded,
in the first precept of the
second Table of his Law, that children
shall honour theyr Parents,
with a double promise, of this life,
and the life to come: then command
thou likewise, and instruct
thy children, to honour God also,
and let this be thy first and chiefest
care in the table of thy heart, &amp; so
shew thy selfe thankefull to God agayne.

When Salomon was to trie,
whose was the liuing childe,1. King. 23. 6. for
which the two women stroue, to
find out the same, by the naturall
affection of the true mother, hee
commanded the child to bee diuided
in two; wherewith, as the true
mother was much moued and displeased,
so the wrong mother cared
not, but was cōtented it should
be so; and so the veritie for the adjudging
did appeare: It is euen so,
with godly &amp; wicked parents, and
by this they may be knowne; the
wicked parents, not hauing any
conjunction with God thēselues,
they cannot know nor apprehend
the ioyfulnesse thereof in others, as
in their children, &amp; therefore they
care not, though they be destroyed
by sinne, and diuided asunder from
the body of Iesus Christe but godly
and true parents, feeling in their
owne hearts, the sweet ioy of that
blessed vnion with God through
Christ, they endeuour onely, so to
bring vp their children in the true

feare and loue of God, that they
may be partakers also of that vnspeakeable
comfort &amp; ioy of that
conjunction with themselues, and
so haue true life in them; yea, before
they should bee diuided from
that comfort and life, which they
haue in that conjunction with Iesus
Christ, they rather would giue
ouer that naturall title and right of
comfort, which belongeth iustly
vnto them as parents, as they did
naturally beget them in sinne, by
the seed of man in the flesh, to their
owne image; so their chiefe care
and desire is,Psal. 51. 
                     •
                  . Ephes. 2. 3. that they may be begotten
of a new, supernaturally, in
the spirit vnto righteousnesse, by
the spirit of God, to Gods image,
and by the immortall seed of the
word of Iesus Christ, God &amp; man,
and as they did dwell together on
earth, so for euer in heauen also
they desire together to remayne.
This, I say, is the wish, care, and
note of all godly and true parents,
and which euery one should haue

or be knowne by; and truely, wee
see oftentimes, that children take
example of their parents, and walketh
in their footsteps, pressing to
imitate them, that they may the
more be loued by them: so that if
the father bee carefully and godly
disposed, his sonne will feare, lest
the contrary disposition be deprehended
in him, (at least by his father;)
if he see, that his father hate
and detest drunkennesse, fornication,
swearing, or such sinnes, surely,
if hee bee a naturall sonne, and
not a castaway, hee will bee loth to
commit any such, or at least to his
fathers knowledge or face; and, if
he haue grace in him, hee will doe
that rather, which hee knoweth to
be liking and acceptable in his fathers
sight: the example whereof,
first consider, in a truly godly &amp; obedient
sonne Iacob, who knowing
that the daughters of Canaan displeased
Izhak and Rebekah,
               Gen. 27▪ 46. his parents,
he would not ioyne with thē
in mariage, but with his owne kindred,

commanded by his fathee; as
also, the like after a maner, in a
counterfeit cast-away, Esau his
brother,Gen. 28. 6, 7, 8. who seeing, that to marry
with the daughters of Canaan (as
hee had notwithstanding already
done) was displeasant and grieuous
to his parents, and that his
brother Iacob had obeyed his father,
to doe otherwise, in going to
Padan Aram, he went also, &amp; tooke
Ishmaels daughter to wife, of his
own kindred, (albeit a bastard generation)
such was the care (albeit
hypocriticall) euen of this castaway,1. Sam. 2. 23.
to please his parents. Elies
wicked sonnes also, seeing their fathers
godly disposition, durst not
before him commit such enormities
as they did, or to his owne
knowledge, vntill by the people, it
was reported so vnto him; so that
the good inclination of the father,
is a great awe band vnto the sonne,
as of the contrary, the nature of
the sonne, is more apt to follow a
lasciuious and impious father to

wickednesse and vanitie, then a
godly graue father to piety and
true wisedome. Concerning this
aptnesse of children, to imitate
their parents example, in good or
euill, Christ himselfe also saith to
the Iewes;Iohn 8. 39. 44. 
               If ye were the sonnes of Abraham,
ye would doe the workes of your
father Abraham, but ye are of your fafather
the diuell, and the lusts of your father
ye will doe: therefore let all fathers,
in the good education of
their children, be as lampes themselues
in their life, that they may be
followed by them; and doe such
things, that therein, they would
desire their childrens imitation. It
is a great delight to parents, to
heare, that their children are like
vnto them, but if they be like them
in godlinesse, it is a great ioy and
comfort to others also. For then
they represent and resemble the Image
of Iesus Christ, the common
Sauiour and Father of all men, as
he was the character and expresse
Image of his Father, in Iustice,

Mercy, and Holinesse; so they, being
likewise, the image of Christ
againe, in holines and sanctity of
life, being holy as he is holy, and
hauing that honour, to be like the
King of all kings; &amp; thereby brother
to the Prince of princes, of
whose kingdome it may be truely
said,
His ego met as nec tempor a pon
                     •
                  .
without limitation or prescription
of time, Ioy infinite, and Eternitie
without end.
            In the 127. Psalme, Dauid calleth
children by three titles; First, Behold
(saith he) children are the inheritance
of the Lord; to shew, that they
should bee educated and brought
vp by their parents with such care,
as though they were not the children
of men, but of God; and consider,
what care a man hath and respect
vnto his inheritance, that it
be not abused any way, or spoyled;
the like, &amp; greater care, hath God
our heauenly Father, that our children,
which are his inheritance,

(for of these is the kingdome of
heauen) be not negligently or euilly
brought vp, to dishonour his
name, who should honour him.
The heyre of a king and kingdom,
must be so educated, that hee may
be found worthy of the crowne.
The children of the faithfull, are
heyres to the King and kingdome
of Heauen. Therefore their parents,
as tutors, to whom they are
concredit for a time, must trayne
them vp so carefully, in pietie, and
and the obedience of God their
heauenly father, that they may bee
found worthy of the inheritance,
of that Kingdom, and Crowne of
glory, purchased by the blood of
Iesus Christ our Lord, &amp; their parents
may bee found faithfull, so in
discharging their dutie therein, to
God and them. Secondly, Dauid
calleth children the Lords Reward,
shewing, that as God of his grace,
doth giue to parents children, as a
testimony of his loue, to their
earthly pleasure, comfort and seruice,

so they should (as it were) reward
God, by giuing and dedicating
them againe, with Hannah, vnto
his seruice, and pleasing of him,
by an immaculate and pure life, as
a token and testimony of their loue
to God againe.
            And thirdly, Children are compared
to arrowes in the hand of the
strong man; who, if they bee well
and godly brought vp &amp; framed,
they wil shoot at their parents enemies,
and be a griefe to their heart,
to see them prosper so, in the feare
of God, by his blessings; and blessed
is the man that hath his quiuer full of
them: but, if they be carelesly and
too indulgently broght vp, as Elies
sonnes, and Absolon, they will be the
darts to pearce their fathers heart,
with griefe and bitter sorrow to
them.
            In Latine, Children are called
pigno
                     •
                  a, and pueri, the one, because
they are the pledges of Gods fauour
to the parents, as also naturall
pledges of the mutuall loue of the

parents betwixt themselues, (beeing
the surest bond in marriage, to
knit and continue the loue of man
and wife betwixt thēselues, which
Leah well did know, when beeing
conceyued, shee said, Now my husband
will loue me.) If therefore, they
be the pledges of Gods loue, to
their parents, in giuing them of his
grace, for their worldly pleasure;
then, by their good education, let
them be the pledges of the parents
loue to God likewise, in giuing and
dedicating them againe, vnto his
heauenly pleasure and seruice, as an
vnspotted and cleane sacrifice, being
puri, sicut pueros dec
                     •
                  t, and in the
meane time, let parents be aware,
to esteeme or loue the pledge or
gift, more then God, the giuer
thereof: for if they loue their children
too much, dallying and delighting
onely with the gift, God
the giuer, will eyther make them of
a blessing in his loue, turne to a
curse in his anger, or else separate
them one from another, in making

eyther the father childlesse shortly,
or the child fatherlesse, which experience
oftentimes proueth manifestly:
let children therfore be only
as cords, to draw the parents hearts
more and neerer vnto God, in increase
of loue and thankefulnesse
to him, and God wil heape his blessings
more abundantly on them
both, &amp; also let their parents chiefe
care bee, to trim and adorne their
hearts and minds so with pietie and
vertue, as becommeth a gift or reward,
which is to bee presented to
the King of al kings before whose
eyes, no vncleane thing can stand:
therefore Christ, once beeing to
shewe, who should inherite the
kingdome of heauen, tooke for example,
a little childe, and set him in
the middest of his disciples, saying,
Whosoeuer receyueth not the kingdome of
heauen as a child,
               Luke 18. 17. 
               he shal not enter therein:
thereby shewing, that our children
should be so innocent, so humble,
and voyd of all euill, that they may
be takē for example of the sonnes

and heires of God▪ not as many are
now (wofull to see) made proud in
their cradle, learned to curse and
sweare, before they can well speak
or aske their parents blessing, and
full of euill, before they haue reason
to discerne good or euill: therefore
set tender and wise parents not
excuse their childrē in their faults:
saying, They are tender, or haue no
wit to doe otherwise; if they bee
tender, let not the worme of sinne
so sticke vpon them, for the danger
is the greater, lest the sooner it eate
thorow their heart; and it is fearefull,
when they haue wit to doe or
speake euill, and goe in the wrong
way, before they haue wit, or are
taught to speake or doe well, and
enter in the right way. As they
were before compared to arrowes,
we know, as the arrow is directed
at the first, so it flyeth all the way,
ouer, or vnder, or beside, but it neuer
commeth vnto the right marke
or butte vnlesse it be directed right
at the first, in the letting foorth out

of the Bow: so it is, that except frō
the first comming forth out of the
wombe, children be directed in the
right way, they shall hardly or neuer
attayne to the end of the way,
which is true happinesse in Iesus
Christ; we know also, if our children
bee deformed in their youth,
we neuer expect that they will bee
well fauoured in their age; and,
when a yong Plant sprouteth vp,
if there bee a worme, that lyeth at
the roote thereof, we know, except
we remoue and kill the same, the
tender Plant will neuer thriue, nor
grow forward; doe we know and
beleeue so, in respect of our childrens
bodies? &amp; plants of our gardens?
then let vs know and beleeue
the same in respect of their minds:
if sin grow be
                  •
               ore pietie, the weed
will smother the good corne, if vice
be sowen and appeare before vertue
in youth, no appearance of a
good or ioyfull haruest in age: remoue
and kill the worme of sinne
from the tender plant of childhood,

lest it gnaw out the life thereof,
ere thou be aware: kill the serpent
in the egge, lest whē he is hatched,
hee kill thee who is the parent,
with griefe, and thy child with
his poyson: yea, we teach a dogge
while hee is a whelpe; wee tame a
bird while it is yong; wee breake a
horse, while he is a colt; and bow
the tree, while it is a twig, so, with
wise Salomon; Teach thy child in his
youth, that he may remēber it when
hee is olde: the birdes of the ayre
teach parents their dutie, they flie
before their yong ones, to teach
them to follow; as parents should
by good example and godly education,
teach their children to flie to
God also, by faith and holinesse of
life: wee haue a care to feede our
beasts, &amp; see their education carefully,
who, if they starue or die, we
haue onely lost a carkas; but, when
carefully we ouersee not the education
of our owne children and
seed, the feeding of their soules by
instruction, &amp; curing of their sores

of vice by correction, wee loose
their bodies and soules, which is
more precious then all the worlde,
and their blood shall be required at
our handes, and of this vice complayneth
Isaiab, 1. 3. that the oxe &amp;
the asse were taught to know their
masters, but his people did not
know him, as Gods Ministers may
now also iustly complayne of the
same. Wee haue three notable examples
of parents, for good education,
in the Scriptures: 1. King. 2.
wee haue Dauid, instructing his
sonne. Gen. 34. Iacob reproouing
and correcting his sonnes: and
Iob. 1. Iob praying for his sonnes;
put these three together, instructing,
correcting, &amp; praying, they will make
blessed children, and thrice happy
parents; and as it was a sweete and
comfortable thing, to see children
goe before Christ to the Temple of
Ierusalem, singing Hosanna to the most
highest, that it might be fulfilled, that
out of the mouthes of babes and sucklings,
Gods prayses should sound: so it shall

be to the great ioy and comfort of
their parents hearts, when in the
temple and congregation of the
faithfull, they shall see their childrē
(beeing well brought vp) singing
prayses to God on high, and setting
foorth the mercy of Iesus Christ
their Redeemer: and as their children
shall bee a ioy to their heart in
that present, so also their God, and
the God of their children, shall
send a blessing vpon them, as Genes.
18. 17. vpon Abraham, with
whom they shal be worthily called
Fathers of the faithfull; God shall
auert from them that shame &amp; sorrow,
that proceedeth to parents
from their childrens liberty, whereof
the wise man speaketh, Pro. 17.
21. &amp; 29. 15. and commandeth the
contrary, Giue not the waters any passage,
no, not a little: and the diuturnitie
of the good of such education,
shall be euer vpon them, and their
children, when after them they shal
proue good fathers of faithful and
godly children also, and at last, receiue

both, a crowne of glory in
life eternall, with God our heauenly
father, and Christ his sonne our
Sauiour. And so for the dutie and
admonition of parents, let this obseruation
suffice, to teach their children,
being yong, how to redresse
their wayes. The matter, concerning
which the question is propounded,
is, a yong mans way, that
is, his course of life, which must be
redressed. And it is a Metaphore
taken from pilgrimage or iourneying,
wherein a man, if hee would
come to the right end of his iourney,
must keepe the true and right
way, without declining, eyther to
the left or to the right hand, that he
aberre not, nor goe astray; so that
our life here, beeing a pilgrimage,
(as old Iacob confessed to Pharaoh▪
               
and the Apostle, 1. Pet. 2. 11. exhorteth,
saying, Dearely beloued, I exhort
you, as strangers and pilgrim
                     •
                  s, abstaine
from fleshly lusts, which fight against the
soule.) wherein wee haue many bywayes,
which leadeth to the wrong

end, to wit, destruction; but one
onely true way, which leadeth to
the right ende, to wit, Saluation,
which is Christ Iesus, and a young
man beeing the pilgrime, beginning,
or hauing newly begun his
way, hee must diligently take heed
and trie, in what way hee insisteth,
and whether he treadeth the right
or the wrong path; and seeing in a
yong mans way, Sathan the leader
and way to perdition, on the one
side, is busiest to cast before him
many lets and hinderances of the
affections, and alluring lusts of the
flesh, with the pleasures of youth,
thereby to hinder his course, or
draw him backe from the right
way, (as the Syrens would Vlisses)
and to precipitate him headlong
from the high rockes of sinne and
despaire, in the fearefull and deepe
gulfe of vtter destruction: and on
the other side, of all ages, Youth,
(hauing newly begun, and vnacquainted
with these terrifying lets)
being easiest by nature to be drawn

away, and perswaded to the inticing
&amp; sweet pleasures of the flesh,
the world, and of sinne, and so in
most perill to yeeld: therefore a
yong man must the more earnestly
enquire and desire of God, (the
way it selfe, the leader, and ende
thereof) that of his grace, he would
so direct and confirme him in his
pathes, and giue him grace and
strength, whereby to redresse his
owne wayes, and ouercome all the
impediments of Sathan, that insisting
therin, he may euer constantly
persist and continue, vntill hee
come to the ioyfull and happy end
thereof, where is true rest, from all
labours, &amp; glory infinite for a perpetuall
reward.
            The reason, why a yong man, in
his youth, and first steps of his walking,
should examine and redresse
his wayes, is this; we know by experience,
in a iourney, that the farther
wee are gone from the right
path, which leadeth to such a
place, it is the harder and laborious,

eyther by comming backe againe,
to find the right high way,
which we foolishly lost, or to come
neere the place, which wee wish to
bee at; and thererefore that it is
best, at the beginning of our iourney,
to enquire, and bee instructed,
what way to keepe, by them who
know, and haue tread the fame before
vs, and by their directions in
walking forward, to trie and examine
our selues, if we hold likewise
in the right way or no; or if not, in
time to returne, while wee are not
farre off. So, in the iourney of this
life, we haue a place which we aime
at, to wit, Heauen▪ we haue but one
true way to it, which is Iesus Christ
and his righteousnesse, out youth
is the beginning, or first step of our
iourney, therefore in it, wee must
know and be instructed what way
to keepe, and how to walke therein,
by the example of Iesus Christ,
and the faithfull, who know and
haue tread the same before vs, and
by the directions and touchstone of

Gods word, we must euer bee trying
and examining our selues, if we
hold in the right way, or no? and
if not, in time shortly to returne,
while we are not farre gone astray
in age, not running in the by-waies
of iniquitie in a strange countrie,
farre from our fathers house, while
wee are yong, and in feeble age,
thinking wee can returne and find
the right way againe, to walke
therein, let no man presume so, that
in the day of his youth, while he is
able, he may runne halfe way with
the diuell to hell, and in the night
of his age, when he is vnable, that
hee may returne easily from Sathans
hold, and the slymie pits of
sin, to walke the whole way with
Christ to heauen.
            The second reason, why a yong
man thus, in the first steppes of his
way, must so take heed thereto, and
redresse the same, is, because the
time, of the walking in the way of
this life, is so short and vncertaine,
and therefore that wee should not

trust thereto; for wee see some die
in the bud of infancie, some in the
flower of youth, some in the ripenesse
of mid-age and strength, and
some in the fall of weake rotten old
age. The sunne of the life of some
goeth too shortly, as in the winter
day; and of others, it maketh longer
delay, as in the summer. Our
life is compared to a shaddow, and
we know, at mid-day, when the
Sunne is verticall, and in his greatest
strength to vs, the shaddow vseth
to be least, so, oftentimes when
we are in the greatest strength and
vigour of youth, the shaddow of
our vnconstant &amp; short life is least,
and when wee thinke vpon many
yeeres to come, as the rich Glutton
did, commonly the sentence of vnexpected
death commeth, &amp; warneth
to remoue. Therefore in
youth, and euery age, yea, euery
day and houre thereof, wee haue
need to suspect the vncertaine and
short way of life, and therein carefully
and strictly examine and trie

if our wayes and walkings bee in
the way of the Lorde, the ende
whereof, is eternall saluation, and
if not, to day, while wee heare his
voyce, and the acceptable time offereth
it selfe, to redresse &amp; cleanse
our paths and walkings, and conforming
them vnto his. For as all
riuers and springs, that come from
the sea, returne againe; so all men
that are made of the dust of the
earth, shall thither also returne, but
of the time, who can say? this drop
of the riuer, at such a time or houre,
shal returne into the Ocean? or the
returning of such a man vnto the
earth, shal be at such a determinate
speciall time or age? No, our returning
is vncertaine, onely then,
being as a drop of a great Riuer,
let euery man commit the same to
God, and endeuour, as he came salt
with originall corruption from the
earth or Ocean, so to walke in
Gods wayes, and the way of this
life, that hee may returne fresh and
purged by Christs blood, to the

Ocean of the graue, and so drinke
of that fresh springing riuer which
proceedeth from the midst of the
throne of God, in that heauenly
new Ierusalem for euer.
            Our whole life is limitted but to
80. yeares, and in one of these, as in
a poisonable cup, or dish of meate,
death surely lurketh: of all then if
thou shouldest taste and drinke,
knowing this, wouldst thou not
suspect euery one? diuide againe euery
yeare in 12. moneths, thou
knowest not in what month or parcell
of meate the poison of death
lieth, euery moneth againe in so
many weekes, and euery weeke in
so many daies, yea euery day also
in so many houres, in which houre
or moment thereof, sleeping or
waking, canst thou secure thy selfe
from this secret &amp; vncertaine poyson?
suspect then all, and liue so alwaies,
as to die alwaies, night or
day, being prouided, and being neuer
so yong, remember thou knowest
not but the poison may bee in

the first drop of the cup, and yeare
of thy youth, as well as in the dreg
or last dish of olde age, when thou
art first set at the table of the carefull
banquet of life, the sword of
death is so soone hanged in a small
haire aboue thy neck, suspect then
the same at euery morsell, that it
fall not heauily vnawares vpon
thee, but euer haue an eye vpwards,
thou knowest not if it will
fall at thy first sitting downe▪ more
then at thy last rising vp; as it euer
threatneth then, so bee thou euer
prepared, and in time seeke to redresse
thy waies▪ 
               Mans breath is in
his nosthrels; which is the life or combination
of soule and body, whose
dissolution is death. Be thou neuer
so young then, nor so strong, when
thou letteth out the same, thou
knowest not certainely if euer thou
shalt draw it in againe. Let therfore
thy soule breath vnto God, and thy
desire be, to walke in his waies, and
to redresse thine owne. All flesh is as
the grasse of the field; now greene, and

presently blasted: whilest thou art
then as the greene plant in thy tender
youth, expect euer, and suspect
this withering blast of Death,
whose sythe shall send thee with
withered age alike, to the graue;
and in the short inconstant way of
this life, walke in his way who is
true and eternall life.
            This life is a swift post, running
fast vnto death, whose certaine
steps thou canst not marke nor obserue.
Let thy soule then begin
with him in thy first youth, and of
the contrary run swiftly vnto life,
and in the way of life, which is Iesus
Christ. Our life is a dreame,
now present, and presently gone,
wherein who lieth longest, and is
most pleased, commonly (being awaked)
riseth faintest and most
sorrowful. Doe not assure thy selfe
therefore of the length thereof, but
suspect the shortnesse: in it there is
no solide trueth nor rest; apprehend
therefore in the beginning
thereof, and in thy youth: let thy

soule wake and walke in the way
of trueth, Iesus Christ, in whom
true rest is onely to be found. Pythagoras
the Philosopher, did set out
the double course of this our life
by the letter Y. expressing thereby
with Christ the double way thereof:
the one whereof hath a straight
passage &amp; narrow gate at the first,
and fewe they are that enter in
thereat: but in the end, there is
great comfort and rest, for it leadeth
vnto eternall happinesse and
saluation. The other, wide &amp; large
at the beginning, whereat many
doe enter; but in the end, they finde
great trouble and straightnesse, for
it leadeth vnto eternall miserie
and destruction. Both these waies
are set before the eyes of euery
young man, as Biuium Herculis, or as
life and death to choose.
            This narrow way which leadeth
vnto eternall life and saluation, (in
the which euery yong man should
walke in the pilgrimage of this life,
&amp; redresse his own waies of youth,

according therunto) is Iesus Christ
himselfe. I am the way, the veritie and
life, aad no man commeth to the Father
but by me. Our walking in him and
with him, must be in righteousnesse
and holinesse of life, being holy as
he is holy. The gate of this way is
narrow, and the passage straight;
for the liberties of flesh and blood
must bee restrained, our affections
bridled, and the whole man captiuated
vnder the yoake of the obedience
of Iesus Christ. And as
through many tentations hee entred
into the kingdome of heauen;
so wee must the same way follow
him, denying our selues, with our
crosses taken vp, till wee come to
the end of our way, which is true
life, and eternall saluation.
            The other broad way which leadeth
to destruction, and whereat
many doe enter, is sinne and Satan,
who is that deceiuing way vnto eternall
death (&amp; which euery yong
man should abhorre and flie, to enter
thereat neuer so little, or walke

therein neuer so few footesteps in
youth). The walking in him, and
with him, as hee is an vncleane spirit,
must be in the impurity and impietie
of all sinne and filthinesse.
The gate of this damnable way, in
the beginning is broad, &amp; the passage
easie, but the end is vtter perdition
and straightnesse. Where in
following Christ, wee must subiect
the flesh vnto the Spirit; they who
follow him, must abandon, subiect,
and banish Gods cleane Spirit out
of their hearts, and be subiects and
slaues themselues, to the libertine
concupiscence of the flesh, and the
vncleane licentious lusts and affections
thereof. They must refuse the
light yoake of the obedience of Iesus
Christ, to follow him to life, &amp;
take on the heauy yoake of al kind
of sinne, that may presse downe
their soules to the lowest hells, and
follow Sathan their way and guide
vnto eternall torments of fire and
brimstone; for as hee is a condemned
spirit himselfe, so the end of

the way wherein he leadeth captiuated
soules, vnder his heauy yoake
of slauerie and sinne, is death and
eternal condemnation; for the reward
of sinne is death.
            
            Therefore let euery young man,
beholding these two waies, choose
that which leadeth vnto a glorified
eternall life in heauen, by a sanctified
life for a time on earth, and
walke with, and in him, who is the
resurrection and the life, to all them
that are saued. If thy walking heretofore
hath beene in the by-waies
of sinne, and that broad way of Sathan,
giuing liberty and full head
to thy youthly affections, and lusts
of the flesh. Seeke how to redresse
these thy waies, &amp; hereafter striue
violently to enter in at that straight
way, which leadeth to saluation;
presse hardly to thrust in at that
narrow gate, lay off, and cast away
far from thee, all the impediments
of sinne, and the intising vanities
and pleasures of youth, and let thy
onely care be with thee, first to see

thy Sauiour, the way is narrow that
leadeth to him; delay not then till
it be full, but striue to be foremost;
the way is narrow that leadeth to
life, therefore not soone found: in
the beginning thē of thy life, timely
begin, and search carefully and
narrowly for it; the true way is narrow
and straight, therefore thy
steppes therein (when thou hast
found it) must be strait and narrow,
thou must make a couenant with
thy eye, that it behold no vanitie,
thou must shut the gates of thy
eares, that thou heare no vaine prophane,
or idle speeches, offensiue
to God, thou must not harken to
them; but let the sound of Gods
word, and healthfull admonitions,
be pleasant only vnto thy hearing:
thou must haue a watch-man before
thy lips, and Gods feare a bar
vnto thy heart &amp; tongue, that thou
vtter nothing, but may be to Gods
glorie, thy owne comfort, and the
edification of those that doe heare
thee, abstaining from swearing,

cursing, lying, backebiting, slandering,
iudgeing, idle or corrupt speaking,
and from all things that hath
but the appearance of euill: thou
must exercise thy handes to doe
good only, thy feet to prosecute the
same, thy will must be made cōformable
to thy Sauiours, thy vnderstanding
to perceiue and apprehend
vertue, and Gods mercy towards
thee, thy memorie to thinke
vpon his iudgements, to thine amendement,
vpon his mercy, to thy
comfort, and his manifolde blessings
and vndeserued benefites, for
encrease of thankfulnesse in thee.
Thy whole body and all the members
thereof, which is a member of
Iesus Christ, must no wise be made
a member of Sathan by sinne, or
polluted, to bee the member of an
harlot, thy soule and heart, with all
the powers and faculties thereof,
must be the temple and tabernacle
of Gods sanctifying and holy spirit,
&amp; not a lodge for that vncleane
spirit of sinne, and his fellowes of

thy filthy lusts and carnall affections:
in body and soule thou must
walke so warily and narrowly, in
feare and trembling working out
thy saluation. The way is narrow,
feare then, neuer so little, to depart
from the paths of the Lord; this
straight passage and path to saluation,
is soone lost by negligence,
but not so easily found out againe,
without great diligence: care not
for the scornefull and diuelish slander
of the world, to bee called precise,
but daily more and more, labour
so to be indeede; striue to liue
a pure and vnspotted life, without
an hypocriticall and externall
shew onely thereof. It is saide in a
diuelish prouerbe, A young Saint, an
olde diuell: but endeuour thou, being
young, to be a Saint of God, and to
dedicate thy youth to him, and his
seruice onely, walking in this strict
and narrow path, &amp; the same God
who hath giuen thee beginning,
shall also giue thee constancie and
a ioyfull end, that thou maiest liue

an old Saint also (as well as young)
on earth, and in heauen he shal glorifie
thee a blessed Saint for euer
with himselfe. It is saide, and that
most truely; Temporis praeteriti, bene impensi
suauis est memoria: The memorie
of time by-past, which was well bestowed,
is sweete and ioyfull to the
minde of man. And let any young
man consider with himselfe, if God
bring him to age, what greater ioy
and comfort hee can haue, then to
remember that hee hath borne the
yoake in his youth, (as the Prophet
saith) that hee entred, and walked
then in the narrow &amp; straight way,
and now is come to the easie passage,
and out-going thereof, to receiue
that promised reward of eternall
ioyes, and euerlasting life:
where hee seeth others, who then
entred a contrarie course, giuing
loose liberty to their flesh, fulfilling
their lusts, and neuer caring to redresse
their waies, in their olde age
to bee punished with pouertie, punished
with infamie and disgrace,

ouercome with sicknesse, humbled
greatly, despised, expelled out of
all good companie, a patterne of
all miserie, in great straightnesse
(the end of the way) and compelled
with the prodigall Sonne, after
they haue spent all, &amp; abused Gods
gifts, to liue in a lamentable estate,
and to flie from Citie to City, from
Countrey to countrey, wrestling, if
they may to come out of their
straightnes, but falling from pit to
pit, from Scylla to Charybdis. And except
God their father giue them a
minde at last to returne to him aright,
and halfe way run and meete
them; that is to be feared, they bee
cast into an euerlasting straightnes
of eternall death and condemnation,
which by their walking in that
broad way of carnall libertie, they
iustly haue promerited. What ioy
(I say) shall this be to an aged man,
to remember his happy estate he is
in? And this wofull condition hee
hath by Gods grace escaped, when
for age hee cannot so well eate his

meate, this remembrance, that hee
remembred his Creatour in the
daies of his youth, and redressed
his waies according to his word,
shall be a continuall banquet vnto
him; this peace of a good conscience,
and ioy of an vpright heart,
shal be a staffe to vphold his soule,
when hee beholdeth the greene
field, and pleasant fruites and flowers
of his well spent youth, greater
solace shall bee to his minde, then
the pleasure of the finest decked
garden of the world could bee to
the eye, his soule shall flow with
comfort, and his heart pant and
leape with ioy; an infinite treasure
shall he possesse &amp; see continually,
which shall neuer make him carefull,
or the feare of the losing thereof,
put sleepe from his eyes: but
from death to life it shall passe with
him, and leaue a perpetuall fame
thereof in the world, when he shall
die in the Lord, his works shall follow
him. Let euery yong man then
spend and bestow his youth so, in

walking in this narrowe way and
straight passage, circumspectly,
precisely, and as purely as hee can,
redressing his waies according to
Gods word, that in the haruest of
old age, he may pull and eate of the
fruit of his youth, and find refreshment
after wearinesse, rest after labour,
victorie after the battel, easinesse
after straightnesse, and infinit
eternall ioy, after momentaneall
mourning and teares for a season:
assuring himselfe, that his fasting
from sinne in youth, shall be a feasting
of comfort in age, his sowing
in teares, shall bee a reaping of ioy.
And Christ, the way, the truth, and
the life, who hath promised the reward,
is faithfull, willing, and sufficient
to performe:Reu. 2. hee saith; To him
that ouercommeth, will I giue to eate of
the tree of life, which is in the midst of the
Paradise of God. He that ouercommeth,
shall not bee hurt of the second death; to
him that ouercommeth, will I giue of the
Manna that is hid, and I will giue him a
white stone, and in the stone a new name

written, which no man knoweth, sauing he
that receiueth it. He that ouercommeth;
shall bee clothed in white aray, and I will
not put out his name out of the Booke of
life, but I will confesse his name before my
Father, and before his Angels. Lo
                  •
               , many
rewards, diuers recompences,
great liberality, vnspeakeable mercy,
and infinite matter of comfort,
and encouragement in thy youth
to walke in this narrow way, that
in age thy ouercomming may bee
fulfilled and finished. Christ, who
promiseth, hee is the way that cannot
erre, walke in him, hee is the
trueth that cannot deceiue, walke
by himselfe, and hee is the life that
hath swallowed vp death, walke
therefore to him, make him wholly
thy whole way, and wholly holily insist
and persist in him, redressing all
thy owne waies according to his.
Be importunate with Moses, that the
Lorde would shew himselfe vnto
thee, wrestle with Iacob for the blessing,
that thou maiest preuaile with
God, and by his grace, he may preserue

&amp; direct thee in all thy waies
                  •
               
according to his own way: striue to
enter in at the straight gate, as Christ
the way cōmandeth thee: pray with
Paul 7. times, yea 70. times 7. times,
and be instant that his grace may
suffice thee: with the widow weary
the Iudge of al flesh, that iust &amp; willing
Iudge to heare thee, and grant
thee thy desire: with the poore Samaritane
woman, begge earnestly
at Christ to cure thy owne sicke
soule, to redresse thy waies, to direct
thee in his, and to giue thee of
the childrens bread, that hid Manna,
to eate. The kingdome of heauen,
and end of the straight way,
suffereth violence; inferre violence
therefore to enter in at the same,
neither delay any time. Iacob was
desired by Ioseph, to make his iourney
speedily to come to the kingdome
of Egypt, where hee was second
person. Iesus Christ our brother,
whom we sold by our sinnes,
desireth and willeth euery young
man to make his iourney speedily

likewise, in the right way to come
to the kingdome of heauen, where
he is the second person also. Iacob,
except that he had made haste to
get the blessing of his father, hee
had beene in perill to loose it; for
presently, as hee went out from the
presence of his father, his brother
Esau came in: so, except thou make
speed in thy youth to obtaine the
blessing of God thy heauenly Father,
by redressing thy wayes and
walking in his, thou art in great perill
to loose the same: this narrow
and strait gate of grace is opened
before thy eyes, then striue that
thou maist enter in thereat, bee not
slow then, but make speede in thy
way here, lest hereafter, with the
foolish Virgins, thou call and
knocke, at the gate of glorie,
but bee not admitted to that Ioy:
say not in thy youth, with sluggard,
Pro. 6. 10. Yet a slumber, and
vnfolding of hands, but vp, and
walke with Iesus Christ in the way
of godlinesse, at the first call, according

to the rule of Gods word,
purge &amp; redresse thy wayes: when
that cloudy pillar warneth thee, to
goe forward, goe and walke, hauing
it before thy eyes, in the way
of holinesse; and when it warneth
thee to stay, then stay thy course,
in repressing thy affections, brideling
thy lusts and their precipitate
course, redressing thy wayes, restrayning
the liberties of the flesh,
conforming thy will to Gods will,
and walking in a strait and narrow
way of life: follow young Abell,
who walked innocently and holily
before God, offering the first fruits
of his flocke, as thou must of thy
youth, to the Lord; and not the
broad way of Cain, in murther,
wrath, and despising of God; or of
Lamech, in vaunting and bragging
of thy strength in youth to commit
sinne, (as many yong men do.)
Follow godly Noah in the strait
way of holines, and of curbing the
liberties of the flesh, who in that
generall corruption of time, was

onely found iust, and found fauour
in Gods eyes, when the rest drinking
and eating, taking of those
whom they liked best, reioycing
and walking in the broad way of
iniquitie and libertie of the flesh,
were destroyed with all flesh, in
that generall Deluge. Follow iust
Lot in this true way, who remained
onely vndefiled with the filthie
lusts of the Sodomites, and in vprightnesse
of conuersation, walked
onely before GOD, afflicting his
soule euery day, for their abominations,
and eschued the broad way
of their vncleannesse, whoring, oppression,
drunkennesse, &amp;c. wherewith
yong &amp; old was infected, and
cryed downe from heauen feareful
destruction vpon them. Follow
Abraham, who obeyed and beleeued
God: godly Izaak, who in his
youth was diligently occupied in
prayer in the field, and liued chastly
in the feare of God, vntil a lawful
wife was prouided for him. Follow
plaine Iacob, who esteemed

Gods blessing better then all the
world, and did cast all his care vpon
God (as the Apostle commandeth)
and serued in a painefull seruice,
long and truely, without sleep
in the cold frost of the night, and
burning heat of the day; also suffered
many iniuries, and euer rewarded
good for euill. Follow yong
vpright Ioseph, who beeing greatly
tempted, to enter in that broad way
of liberty and lust, by his mistresse,
refused to commit that vild sinne
of adultery with her, and chose to
walke on in the strait path of holinesse,
he walked so wisely, that he
found fauour in all mens eyes, and
was loued greatly for his gentle
and courteous behauiour, and at
last was promoted, by Gods prouidence,
to be the second person in
all Egypt, after his straitnesse in
prison there. Follow faithfull Moses,
&amp; enter in at this strait gate with
him, who chose rather to suffer aduersitie
with the people of God,
(walking in the narrow way) then

to enioy the pleasures of sinne for
a season, (walking in the broad
way) esteeming the rebuke of
Christ greater riches, then the treasures
of Egypt, (the reason is) for
hee had respect vnto the recompence
of the reward, (the end of
this narrow way.) Israel whom hee
did leade, went out of Egypt to Canaan
the land of their rest, thorow
much straitnesse, and a narrow passage;
as the true Israel of God must
go out &amp; from the Egypt of this
world, to that spirituall Canaan,
the land of their eternal rest. Follow
couragious Ioshua, who went
thorow a narrow passage ouer
Iorden, vnto the land of Canaan,
with Gods Arke before him, &amp; by
many battels ouercame and obtayned
the same; as thou must by many
battels, betwixt the flesh &amp; the
spirit, obtaine that eternal Canaan,
walking towards it in a narrowe
passage, and hauing Gods worde
continually before the eyes of thy
heart, to redresse and conforme thy

wayes according thereunto. Yong
Dauid, after he was elected king of
Israel, hee walked in this narrow
path, thorow many tentations, to
draw him from Gods feare and seruice,
and thorow much straitnesse,
before he came to the possession of
the kingdome; as after thy election
to that euerlasting kingdome of
heauen, in this world, during that
Prince of darkenesse raigne, thou
must passe and ouercome many
temptations of Sathan &amp; the flesh
likewise, &amp; walke in the strait and
narrow way of holinesse &amp; sanctification,
before thou come to the
easie and spacious end of thy way,
to the full possession of that heauenly
kingdome, and eternall glorification
through Christ Iesus:
thou must bee in labours, before
thou rest from labours; thou must
liue in the Lord, before thou canst
die in the Lord; thou must liue the
life of the righteous, if thou wouldest
wish to die the death of the
righteous, and thy last end to bee

like theirs. All the holy Patriarks,
Prophets, Saints, and Martyrs of
God, haue trode this narrow way,
before they obtayned the recompence
of their reward, vnto which
they had respect: if therefore thou
haue any respect vnto the same,
and by hope looke for that, which
they fully now possesse, follow and
insist in their footsteps; if thou
wouldest tryumph and glory with
them, thou must also couragiously
fight with them, against the diuell
and thine owne corrupt affection
                  •
               
and concupiscence of the flesh,
which fayne would haue libertie,
and draw thee in that broad way
of destruction; but assure thy selfe
in thy youth, and in the way thereof,
that the greater liberty of thy
flesh and affections here, maketh
the most strait incarceration, and
feareful plunging of soule and body,
in endlesse and easelesse torments
of hell hereafter: which
thou mayest plainely behold and
learne, by the example of Diues &amp;

               Lazarus, whereof the one, in the
broad way, had his pleasures in
this life, but not a drop of water to
coole his tongue after death, (the
strait ende of his way:) the other
had his miseries here, without necessaries
scarce for the flesh, but after
death, (which opened the large
end of his way) he was carried into
Abrahams bosome, in eternall
ioyes for euer to remaine; in their
life, Lazarus was compelled to beg,
from Diues, crumbes of his bread;
at their death, Diues was compelled
to beg from Lazarus, a drop of cold
water, there did straitnesse follow
after ease, and ease after straitnesse,
in their seuerall wayes. Albeit the
rich man in the Gospell, walking in
the broad way, did bid his soule,
Eate, drinke, and take it ease, for it
had much laid vp for many yeeres,
yet God from heauen had decreed,
that the strait end of his way shold
be neerer then he thought, &amp; they
should fetch his soule frō him that
same night. Albeit Nebuchad-nezzar
               
(walking in the broad way also) in
the pride of his heart said, Is not this
great Babel that I haue built, for the house
of my kingdome, by the might of my power,
and for the honour of my Maiestie?
glorying so in the flesh; yet he was
cast into a great and wonderfull
straitnesse, while the word was in
his mouth, and driuen from men, as
a beast to eate the grasse of the
fields. Albeit Bel
                     •
                  hazzar likewise,
(walking in the same large way) in
the exaltation of his heart against
God, proclaimed a banquet, sitting
with his Princes, wiues and concubines,
pampring &amp; giuing all pleasure
to the flesh, drinking wine in
the vessels, consecrated onely to
Gods seruice, which were brought
out of Ierusalem, not glorifying
GOD, but praysing his Idols of
gold, siluer and stone, yet the end
of his way was this; the Hand declared
on the wall, that hee was
weighed, and found too light, his
kingdome was ended, and giuen to
others, and that same night he was

slayne presently; so when he was
highest, vpon the top of his reioycing
hill, most suddenly he did fall
lowest, in the valley of mourning,
and pit of teares, by lamentable
destruction, the vnexpected strait
end of his broad former way. The
Sodomites knew little how neere
fire and brimstone was neere them;
the primitiue world, how neere
them was the Deluge; and all such
that walke in this way of libertie of
the flesh, how neere, subuersion of
soule and bodie is at hand. Therefore
let vs walke in the right way,
if wee would sitte at Christs right
hand; let vs be sanctified here, if we
would be glorified hereafter; let vs
walke in the true path, if we would
attaine to the true end thereof; and
subdue the slesh with the affections
thereof, to the spirit and yoake of
Christs obedience, if in body and
spirit for euer, wee would raigne
with him. Let vs redresse our owne
wayes, and let euery one that calleth on
the name of the Lord,
               2. Tim. 2. 19. 
               depart from iniquitie:
               
as the Apostle commandeth
Timothie,
               2. Tim. 2. 22. and in his person all yong
men, Flie from the lusts of youth, &amp; follow
after righteousnesse, faith, loue, and
peace, with them that call on the name of
the Lord, for if any man purge himselfe
from these, hee shall bee a vessell vnto honour,
sanctified and meet for the Lord, &amp;
prepared vnto euery good worke.
            
            Seeing also, our course of life
here, is compared to a Way, which
wee must redresse according to
Gods word, therefore let vs walke
in this life, as in a way, warily, and
working out our saluation in feare
and trembling. Considering with
ourselues; 1. First, as in a way or
iourney, no rest is to be expected,
that is permanent, vntill wee come
to the end thereof; so neither must
wee looke for any permanent citie,
or solide rest, in the way or course
of this life, vntill we come to Iesus
Christ, being dissolued, to be with
him, who is the true end and rest,
of the true and narrow way, the
temple of that spirituall Ierusalem,

and Citie of all perfect light and
ioy. For the estate of his Church
here, is, as the Boat, wherein vpon
the sea hee was with his Disciples,
euer tossed vp and downe, in continuall
labour; so that, except hee
were our stay, our rest, and refuge,
wee should surely perish. Our life
here is a Warfare, our enemie is euer
pursuing, as a raging Lyon, seeking
to deuoure vs, therefore wee
must be in continual defence of the
life of our soules, by his strength
being armed, who gaue his life for
our soules, vntill vnder his defence,
hauing fought a good fight, and finished
our course, we be victorious
and tryumph with him, hauing receyued
that immortall and incorruptible
crowne of glory, which is
layd vp for vs, and for all them that
loue the comming of the Lord Iesus
in glorie, to glorifie vs with
himselfe. 2. Secondly, in a way,
we euer goe forward, and one step
followeth another, sicut vnda impelli,
tur vnda, as one waue is enforced by

another; so also in the way of this
our life, wee poast to our end, and
our dayes passe more swiftly then a
weauers shittle; our life is as a flower,
that now springeth vp, and with
a blast fadeth; as a water bubble,
now vp, and now downe with an
aire of wind; as a smoake, seene,
and gone presently; as the fat of
Lambes, which suddenly is dropped
away: so that whether wee
sleepe or wake, whether we eate or
drinke, whether we go or sit still, as
in a ship wee are caried speedily,
with full sailes, thorow the sea of
this turbulent world, to the port
and hauen of our graue, and our
refluxe is to that Ocean. Let vs
watch then carefully, and haue the
houre-glasse of the number of our
dayes, euer before our eies, that we
may apply our hearts to wisedom;
let vs looke diligently to the precious
and most deere loading of our
soules, once purchased by Christs
blood, suspect our weake vessels,
and clay tabernacles, acknowledge

that we are euer in danger of death,
and that there is little betwixt
vs and him: foresee carefully the
rockes and daungers before vs,
haue euer the Compasse of Gods
word before our eyes, to direct our
course and way according thereunto.
Behold still the Mappe and
Carde of that heauenly coast of
Canaan, towards the which wee intend
and attend our course, try and
spy out the markes, whereby wee
may know that wee are neere the
same, or in the right way thereto;
forget the things that are behinde,
and haue our eyes forward, still on
the further banke; and by continuall
and earnest praiers, desire almightie
God to saue vs, lest we perish,
to giue vs his spirit to bee our
guide and pilot, and by his infinite
mercy &amp; grace, to bring vs at last,
to that wished Land of our blessed
Canaan, with Ioshua our Iudge and
Captaine, through all the perills
and daungers of this darke desart.
And chiefly, let vs daily striue, as

in the way of our naturall life: so
likewise, that in the way of our supernatural
&amp; true life, Iesus Christ,
and his righteousnes, we may make
some progresse, &amp; so step forward
frō life to life, forgetting the world
and her whorish intisements behinde
vs, and bending our forces
directly to follow him onely.
            Thirdly, in a way also, we haue
euer certaine limitted bounds,3. We are limitted.
which wee must not transgresse
nor goe ouer. In the way of
this life likewise, wee haue Gods
word and Commaundements, as
walles on each side to enclose vs,
which wee must striue to containe
our selues within, and to redresse
our waies according therevnto.
Christs voice is the walls &amp; hedge
of his sheepfold, ouer which whosoeuer
passeth, wandreth astray in
the fearefull and darke desart of
sinne, a readie prey to that cruell
deuouring beare, and raging Lyon
Sathan: for God, as hee is iust and
mercifull, so hee hath declared and

manifested the same plainely in his
sacred word, his iustice chiefly in
the olde testament, his mercy in the
new; his iustice he hath set vp as a
wall on our right hand, that wee
may feare to sinne; his mercy as a
wall on our left hand, that if wee
sinne, we may know that wee haue
a Mediatour &amp; Sauiour, euen Iesus
Christ the man: therefore, seeing
we are set betwixt these two walls,
let vs walke warily, that on the one
side beholding Gods iustice, wee
despaire not, nor on the other, beholding
his mercy, wee presume
not, but with an equall eye beholding
both, and with an equall pace
walking betwixt both, in feare and
loue of him, wee may goe on our
way to our iournies end, and so
worke out the great worke of our
saluation.
            Fourthly, in a iourney way, or
race to bee runne,4. We take no burdens euery man, who
desireth to bee at the end thereof
soonest, wil make himselfe lightest,
and not take vp heauie burdens to

hinder and wearie him: So in this
way and race of our life, if we haue
eyes to see the reward, (being a
crowne of immortall glory) if wee
haue hearts to consider or vnderstand
the preciousnes thereof, or a
desire to attaine, or obtaine the
same, we must not take on, the heauie
and hindering burdens of this
world, and the wearisome vanities
thereof, to bee impediments in our
course, but cast off and disburden
our selues of these dangerous loadings,
vsing the thinges of this
world, as though wee vsed them
not: and in our youth begin &amp; take
vp the light and easie yoake of
Christs obediēce, &amp; with our crosses
follow him: in our hand wee
must take the staffe of his worde;
wee must gird our loynes with his
sanctitie and righteousnes, and in
the footesteps of pure vnspotted
innocencie, must wee follow him,
being holy as hee is holy: this is the
way, Sic itur ad astra.
            
            Fiftly,1. We desire not our way to be long. no pilgrime also will desire

his way to be long and wearisome,
but the sooner he may come
to the end of his iourney, the more
he will reioyce. In this way and pilgrimage
likewise of our life▪ let vs
not desire so much to liue long till
age, that our way may be prolonged,
but to liue well while wee are
young, that we may insist constantly▪
in the true way, and desire with
the Apostle, rather to bee dissolued
and be with Christ: and with olde
Simeon, after our eyes by faith haue
seene our saluation, &amp; in the armes
of our heart wee haue embraced
him, to desire to departe in his
peace, and enioy the reward &amp; fulnes
of our hope.
            And in the meane time,6. Our way dangerous. seeing
in our way chiefly of youth, wee
haue many impediments cast before
vs, many fetters and nets for
our feete, laide to insnare vs, manie
outward and inward enemies seeking
to destroy vs; and no wisedome
nor strength in our selues to
preuent or auoid them: therefore

let our continuall and humble petition
bee to that Lord of strength,
and wisedome of the Father, Leade
vs not into temptation, but deliuer vs from
all euill: and so in a way of this
life, let vs walke as in the way, according
to the word and way of Iesus
Christ, redressing our bywaies.
And hauing these considerations,
before our eyes, vntill by that true
and liuely way Christ, wee attaine
to the end thereof, eternall life and
endlesse rest for euer.
            The action set downe in this question
is, Whereby shall a young man redresse
his way? according to the
vulgar translation, but according
to the originall and Hebrew text,
it is, Whereby shall a young man cleanse
or purge his way? The first, to wit,
redressing, is a metaphore taken
from a house, which being vncleane
or out of order, vseth to bee
redressed and trimmed vp for the
guests it should receiue, according
vnto the Parable and wordes of
Christ, concerning the vncleane

spirit, who departed out of the
man whom he possessed, and wandred
in dry places, seeking rest, and
finding none: therefore he decreed
with himselfe, to returne backe againe
to his former lodging, and
tooke with him other seauen vncleane
spirits worse then himselfe;
who returning, found the house
dressed and wel garnished for them,
and there they aboade; so that the
last conditio
                  •
                of that man, was
worse then the first. And so truely
it is in all ages, but chiefly in youth,
that our soules and bodies, (which
should be the temple and tabernacle
of Gods holy and cleane Spirit,
who can abide no impuritie) is polluted
daily with the vncleannes of
sinne, and defiled with the filthie
Harpies of our lusts and carnall affections,
and so we harbour in our
heart (as it were) that vncleane spirit,
and dresseth vp the same as a
house or chamber for him to rest in
with his fellowes. Therefore in our
youth &amp; tender yeares, if we would

bee accounted, or any way esteemed
to bee the children of God, to
be the members of Iesus Christ, to
be temples of Gods Spirit, to haue
our names written in that booke of
life, or euer to exspect participation
or enioying of the endlesse and
infinite ioyes of heauen: then let vs
by the assistance and strength of
that stronger man Iesus Christ,
who hath ouercome and subdued
all, and by the speciall grace of his
blessed and powerfull spirit, striue
to binde &amp; expel that vsurping tyrant,
out of the precious house of
our soule, and to shut him out of
the gates and doores of our hearts,
that we be none of his possessions,
or vessells in his house, and with all
our strength, diligence and power,
seeke to redresse our soule and heart
againe, and make it fit and meete
for the habitation &amp; abiding place,
of that cleane and holy spirit of Iesus
Christ onely, being sanctified
by his grace, in all the members of
our body, &amp; faculties of our soule,

that the Lord of rest may giue rest
to our cesciences, &amp; rest by his cō
               fortable
presence in our harts cōtinually:
let vs lift vp the celestiall
and euerlasting gates of our
soules, and let the king of glory enter
in: walke in his waies, and redresse
by his grace, our vncleane
and enormous waies of sinne and
vnrighteousnes.
            The second word, to wit, cleansing,
according to the original word
in the Hebrew text, which is 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               
               mundabit, is taken likewise by a
metaphore, chiefly from vessells,
which vseth to bee made cleane
and purged, when they are foule or
polluted with any thing, according
to Christs words, Matth. 23. 25. in
reprehending of the hypocriticall
Scribes &amp; Pharises, who did make
cleane the outter side of the cup &amp;
platter, but within were full of hypocrisie
and iniquitie. So indeede,
all men, young and olde, wee are
Gods vessells, either of honour or
dishonour, appointed either continually

to remaine in his sight, or
eternally to bee reiected and banished
from his glorious presence:
there is no day also, but we are polluted
(chiefly in youth) and desiled
with some vncleannes of sinne, and
our filthy lusts and affections euer
doth infect vs: therefore continually
wee must endeuour, and seeke
with earnest praiers, that wee may
cleanse and purge (according to
Christs commandement) first,Matt. 23. 26. the
inside of the cup and platter▪ that
the outside of them may be cleane
also. In our youth, wee are as new
vessells in Gods house, if at any
time a vessell be esteemed of, or be
cleane, it is when it is new: &amp; therefore
in our youth let vs chiefly trie
and know if wee be vessells of honour▪
if we be, surely then we must
bee most cleanest, for a precious
vessell of honour, ordained to be in
the presence of the Prince, is neuer
defiled with filthines, nor suffered
to be put to an vncleane vse, chiefly
being as yet new; but if we finde

our selues polluted with filthines in
our youth and newnes, &amp; our soule
made the receptacle of stincking
lustes, and of all impuritie of
sinne, let vs feare and suspect that,
except God of his free mercy and
grace, create and frame vs of a new
againe, and purge vs from all our
iniquities, that wee can iudge our
selues to be no other but vessells of
reiection, impurity, and dishonour.
Therefore in youth, while the filth
of sin sticketh not so fast vpon the
vessels of our souls, nor the old mā
of iniquitie hath not taken so long
&amp; strong possessiō of the house of
our heart (as he may plead long custome
or defend it) let vs purge by
the teares of true repētance our filthy
blots, &amp; vncleannes of sin, and
desire that vnspotted Lambe by his
precious bloodshed, to purge vs
likewise from the guilt thereof: let
vs by the strength of his gracious
Spirit, expell that vncleane spirit of
sinne, and pleasures of the flesh,
and redresse the roome and house

of our soule, with open gates to receiue,
retaine, and entertaine with
ioy, that spirit of all cleannes, of
ioy, and endlesse comfort. As Iesus
Christ our Sauiour hath commanded;
let vs first purge &amp; make clean
the inside of the cup &amp; platter, that
the outside may be cleane also, that
is, let vs begin &amp; purge the worme
of sinne and corruption from the
roote of our hearts and the branches,
with the fruite of word and
deede, shall prosper the better; begin
and purifie the spring, and the
streames that runneth therefrom
shall be the clearer: Out of the abundance
of the heart the mouth speaketh:
and according as the affection of
the heart is, so the workes proceed,
and the members executeth their
command. This purifying is by true
repentance, with Marie Magdalen, in
sorrowing truly for our sinnes, and
in all humilitie washing his feete
with the teares of deepe remorse,
constantly endeauouring neuer to
sinne no more, and by a liuely faith

in the armes of our soule, embracing
and apprehending the blood
of Iesus Christ and his death, as our
onely righteousnes, obedience, and
propitiatorie sacrifice before the
Father, and by good workes and a
sanctified holy life, shewing our
faith and Gods mercy manifested
in vs, to our liues end, to the good
example of others, and our owne
soules saluation.
            This action of cleansing or redressing,
is set downe in the future time,
Qui nam mundabit, &amp;c. Wherewith shal
a young man cleanse his way. Noting
thereby the present estate thereof
to bee vnredressed and vncleane.
Whereby wee learne and may obserue,
first, that howsoeuer we flatter
or excuse our selues in any age,
but chiefly in our youth, that our
waies nor course of life is not so vncleane
nor worthy of reproofe, but
may be easily borne with, &amp; soone
redressed oramended, yet the spirit
of God in this place of his sacred
word dooth by the mouth of

his holy Prophet, shew vnto vs
that our waies are so vncleane and
filthy, that it is a very hard &amp; difficult
thing to redresse or cleanse
them, their pollutiō being so great:
which he would signifie by asking
interrogatiuely, how they shall bee
redressed? And therefore, that in all
humilitie and lowest submission of
heart in our youth, and in all ages,
wee should acknowledge the infinite
greatnes of our transgressions
and filthy vncleannesse of sinne,
which cannot bee cleansed but by
an infinite purgation, euen by the
blood of Iesus Christ, in his infinite
and vnsearcheable mercy shed for
mankinde, which wee should daily
begge, and continually thirst after
the same greedily, walking worthy
hereafter, as those who are redeemed
with so precious a price.
Secondly, wee may obserue here,
the markes and difference betwixt
a godly and vngodly young man,
the one consulteth and asketh at
God, Whereby he may redresse and purge

his waies? the other consulteth with
flesh and blood, and asketh counsell
at Sathan and his owne filthy
lusts and affections, whereby hee may
defile and pollute his waies? The onely
care and vigilant studie of the one
is, how to redresse vice, and ouercome
sinne in his mortal members,
that Gods free Spirit may make
his aboad and comfortable habitation
in his soule. The diligent care
of the other is, how to represse and
oppresse vertue and godlines, that
it take no roote in his soule, nor
bring forth no acceptable &amp; pleasant
fruit before God, but that as a
sinke of iniquitie, it may abound
and yeelde forth out of the aboundance
thereof, rotten and vnsauorie
smells, in thought, word, and
action. The one seeketh to purge
himselfe from the least spot of sin,
that might make him displeasing
in his fathers sight, yea hee abhorreth
from the very appearance of
euill, or the least meane that might
draw or perswade him any way

thereunto. The other seeketh the
foulest puddle or mire of sin, wholy
in body and soule, not caring to
tūble &amp; pollute himselfe as a filthy
swine thereinto, and as a dogge deuouring
sinne griedily, (which deuoureth
his soule) and returning euer
to his vomit, he embraceth all
occasions of sinne, hee headlong
runneth vnto the brinke of destruction,
&amp; as it were with cart-ropes
of iniquitie, he is swiftly carried, as
the oxe to the slaughter, or the
foole to the blocke, vnto the bottomles
pit of perdition. The one,
for the least sinne he committeth,
that stayneth his soule, hee heapeth
and powreth out tears vpon tears,
as a treasure to be laid vp in a bottel
before God, that thereafter hee
may reape the fruite of his seed sowed
in tears, in the ioyful and plentifull
haruest of the Lord, when he
shall find true rest and comfort to
his soule. The other, in his greatest
sinnes hee most reioyceth, and
with Lamech,
               Gen. 4. vaunteth of his vngodly

furie and crueltie, of impietie
inferred to his owne soule, hee
heapeth sinne vpon sinne, vntill the
day of wrath, as a treasure, and
with all griedines filleth the cup of
iniquitie to the full, til God in his
iust iugment giue to him also the
full cup of his fierce wrath and indignation,
and make him drinke
out the very dregs thereof▪ for as
he soweth, so he shall reape. The
one sort, being the children of the
light and the day, they walke in the
light, and doe the workes thereof,
therfore they shall enioy the cleare
and endlesse light of that heauenly
new Ierusalem, which is the bright
countenance of the Lambe. The
other being the children of darkenesse
and the night, they delight to
walke in the wayes of darknes, and
to doe the workes thereof; therefore
with the prince of darkenesse,
they shall bee at last cast into vtmost
darkenesse, where is weeping
and gnashing of teeth. Finally, as
euerie tree is knowne by his fruite, so by

their works you shal know and discerne,
betwixt godly, and vngodly
yong men; as a good yong tree
bringeth foorth best fruite in the
spring, while it is yong; so, a godly
yong man bringeth forth best fruits
of vertue and pietie, in his tender
yeeres, and spring of his youth, not
delaying, till the cold winter of old
age come, wherein eyther no fruit
at all, or if any, nothing but sowre
grapes are to be expected: but as
no man can gather figs of thornes,
nor seeke for honie out of the viper,
so, from those that consume
their best age and prime of youth,
in all lustfull licentiousnesse, &amp; outlaw
liuing in sinne, and slauish libertie
of iniquitie, nothing can be
expected, but that the haruest shall
be like the spring, wherin they shal
reape the fruit of their labours, and
their seed time of wickednes shall
bee rewarded, with the measure of
bitter &amp; seuere punishment; when
the axe shall bee put to the root of
the tree, and euery tree that bringeth

not forth good fruit, shall bee
cut downe, &amp; cast into vnquenchable
fire. The examples of both
these sorts of yong men, we haue
in the Scripture, set before the eyes
of all youthes in this age, to learne
by, and behold. Of the one, whom
they should follow, the examples,
of yong Abel, vprightly sacrificing
vnto God, the first fruits and fat of
the flocke; as they should the first
fruits and fat of their youth, in vprightnesse
and holinesse of life: of
yong Isaac, exercising himselfe in
prayer alone in the field: of yong
Iacob, in suffering many wrongs, obeying
the good counsell of his
parents, fearing their displeasure,
dealing faithfully, in an holy and
humble mind with all men: of yong
Ioseph, refusing the way of sinne and
adulterous lust, suffering patiently,
rewarding good for euill, and being
a comfort and reliefe to his old
father, and his whole family: of
Moses, refusing to bee counted the
sonne of Pharaohs daughter, to bee

esteemed the sonne of God, and a
faithful seruant in his whole house:
of yong Dauid, in trusting euer
stedfastly, and beleeuing in Gods
mercy towards him, suffring much
aduersitie, and still sticking fast vnto
the Lord, who deliuered his enemies
so oftentimes in his handes,
and his life out of theirs: of yong
Salomon, in seeking the true wisedome
of God, before honour or
riches: of yong Samuel, zealous and
faithfull in Gods sanctuarie in his
youth, there seruing him: of yong
Daniel, in walking with an holy and
vpright heart, before the almighty:
of yong Timothie, brought vp frō an
infantin the true knowledg &amp; feare
of God, a glorious starre &amp; painfull
instrument in his Church: of the
children of the elect Ladie, 2. epist.
Ioh. 1. 4. whō the beloued Apostle
of Iesus Christ found walking in
the trueth, as God had commanded,
and therefore reioyced: with
such like examples, which are set
before the eyes of all youth, according

thereunto, to reforme and cō
               forme
themselues in all things, that
they may obtaine that rich reward
of eternall life, whereof they are
already in possession. Of the other
sort, which wee should eschue
and abhorre, is malicious murdering
and hypocriticall Cain, who
was accursed of God: vaunting
Lamech bragging of his strength &amp;
furie to commit sinne in his youth:
Ham dishonouring &amp; contemning
Noah his father: Esau, in being a
griefe to his parents heart, a profane
A theist and persecutor of his
godly brother: Absolon, a bloodie,
vnnaturall, proud &amp; wicked sonne
to his father Dauid, whose end was
a shamefull and sudden death: Elies
two sonnes, who oppressed Gods
people, committed most vile filthinesse
in Israel, and were at last the
death and heart-break of their old
father, and their owne destruction:
Ammon, incestuous with his sister,
whose reward was cruel death and
sudden destruction: the young men

of Sodome, who in their filthinesse
were consumed with fire &amp; brimstone:
Zimri and Cozbi in their burning
lust, thrust thorow by zealous
Phineas: with many other such examples,
of those, who in the time of
their youth, fulfilled their owne
lusts, and wicked affections, til they
tasted of the full cup of Gods fierce
wrath, to their vtter destruction,
which was their s
                  •
               al end &amp; lamē
               table
conditiō; such therfore let vs
abhor with their course of wicked
life, as we would eschue their feareful
end &amp; most cursed death. R
                     •
                  hoboam,
by his yong counsellers, in obeying
them, lost a kingdom, to the
which he was called: by the wicked
and furious hote counsellers of our
lusts and affections in our youth, let
vs not also loose the glorious kingdome
of heauen, to the which wee
are likewise called by Gods word.
Neither (as the yong mans loue to
his riches, made him to forsake
Christ) let the vncleane loue, or
desire to follow our youthly pleasures,

or to fulfill our filthy lusts
and affections draw vs from following
Iesus Christ our Sauiour,
and these godly examples and patterns
of youth▪ which in his word,
wee haue here set before our eyes;
but with yong Samuel when the
Lord calleth vs in his Church, to
heare and do his word, let vs so oft
answere, Lord, here am I, thy seruant,
to doe thy godly will, speake,
for thy seruant heareth: while the
spring and seed time is, of our tender
yeeres, let vs so sowe, as wee
would reape; and so bud as wee
would ripen: our youth is the day,
to doe our works in; the night of
age commeth, wherein wee cannot
worke, in that time wee shall say
onely, I might haue bin learned, I
might haue bin so or so, if I had vsed
my time aright; but winter is
come, before I thought on seedtime,
and Times bald backe-side is
turned to mee, but the heary forehead,
which I might haue caught
holde by, is already past: therefore

the wise man saith, Remember
now thy Creator, in the dayes of thy
youth, whiles the euill dayes come not, nor
the yeeres approach, wherein thou shalt
say, I haue no pleasure in them, whiles the
sunne is not darke, nor the light, nor the
moone, nor the starres, nor the cloudes returne
after rayne, when the keepers of the
house shall tremble, and the strong men shal

                     •
                  ow themselues, &amp; the grinders shall cease,
because they are few, and they waxe darke
that looke out by the windowes, &amp;c. describing
so metaphorically, the infirmities
of old age. They, who
stept in first, when the Angel came
downe and troubled the waters of
the poole Bethesda, were cured of
their disease; so if we would be cured
of our soules disease, and leprosie
of sinne, wee must striue to
step in first, before others, in our
youth, without lingring, to be washed
with the blood of Christ, and
liue a pure vnspotted life. Ioseph before
the time of famine came, laid
vp aboundance of corne prouidently
for the same; so before the

leane and crinkled yeeres of age
come, we must prouidently, in the
Sommer of youth, with the Bee
and Ant, gather and lay vp food
for our soules, filling the store-houses
of our heart full with the knowledge
and true feare of God, to be
our comfort and ease in that time,
that here, &amp; in the world to come,
we may bee accounted among the
number, and of the sort of those
forenamed, who dedicated their
youth and first fruites thereof, to
God their heauenly Father, and
now do enioy the ioyful recōpence
of their labours with Iesus Christ,
in the presence of the Lambe for euer
to remaine.
            The answere that is made vnto
this question, is this; In taking heed
thereto, according to thy word: that is,
by these meanes, a yong man may
redresse his wayes and course of
life, if, according to the rule and
prescript of thy holy worde, O
Lord, hee take heed thereto, diligently
and straitly marking, examining

and iudging the same, and
rectifying all his waies and actions
by the direct line and rule of thy
commandements.
            This answere is made by way of
prayer or confessiō to God, or (as it
were) by resolution frō God: In taking
heed thereto,
               Vse. 
               according to thy word:
thereby shewing and teaching all
men, that to know, will or doe aright,
as God hath commanded, according
to his word, is not of our
strength, neither can flesh and blood
reueale it vnto vs, but our heauenly
Father, &amp; it is the gracious worke
of his glorious Spirit, who, as the
knowledge of Gods will proceedeth
of his speciall Illumination, so
the acting and doing of the same,
in an holy and vpright life, is of his
speciall grace and powerfull operation
also, who giueth thee knowledge,
will and power to doe the same. Velle &amp;
perficer
                     •
                  , by enlightning our vnderstanding,
reforming our wicked
will, and conforming the same vnto
the holy and perfect wil of God,

and with his cōmand to rise from
the sleepe and death of sinne, to a
new and sanctified life, giuing vs a
power and flowing light and life
from himselfe to doe so, as when
Christ our Sauiour said, Talitha cumi,
or, Lazarus arise, &amp;c. and at that
last day, when it shall be said, Rise
dead folke, come to iudgement: and so
in all Gods word, when hee commandeth
to repent, beleeue, bring
forth good fruit, or so, we must not
thereby thinke, because God commandeth
so, therefore that we haue
knowledge or free-will to doe, or
not doe so, but with the command
there floweth a concomitating power
and vertue from Gods spirit,
to the hearts of the faithfull predestinate
for saluation, to doe this
command; as a further induration,
to harden the hearts of the sonnes
of reprobation in their stiffe-necked
disobedience to Gods will, euen
as at the words of Christ, the
fig-tree withered: free wil then and
strength of our selues, to know and

doe euill, wee haue, for it is according
to our nature, for by nature wee
are the children of wrath, and all the imaginations
of our heart are onely euill
continually from our very infancie: and
it is the worke of our flesh, for the
flesh coueteth against the spirit: but to
know, will, or to do well, we haue
no power at all, but it is Gods sanctifying
Spirit, who giueth both,
and it is aboue nature, yea, it is the
worke of the Spirit, against nature.
Therefore let vs not trust to
our owne knowledge or wisedom,
for it is darkenesse &amp; foolishnesse,
nor thinke of our owne will or
strength, that we can doe, or truely
desire or know, that which is good,
being so peruerse and wicked, but
with the Prophet, after his example,
acknowledg al our knowledge
of his will, or of the right way to
saluation, to proceed onely from
the illumination of his good spirit,
and that the will or strength to doe
and performe the same, is onely his
owne free worke in mercie also,

and let vs by earnest prayers (as in
all ages, so chiefly in our youth) implore
his holy helpe, to teach vs,
according to his word, how to
walke in his wayes, and to take
heed to our owne, in greatest difficulties
consult with him, who is
true light and wisedome, and in
whom is no changing; in greatest
tentations, by continuall prayer, let
vs flie to him, that with his all-sufficient
grace, he may euer assist vs,
when Sathan would not only buffet,
but kill &amp; deuoure our soules,
with the poyson of sinne, and our
owne lusts, and in all things let him
be our onely refuge, resolution and
comfort continually.
            
               In taking heed thereto, &amp;c. this action
of taking heed to our wayes, in
the answere, hath reference to the
action of redressing or cleansing
the same in the question, as if hee
would say, by taking heed to his
wayes, according to gods word, a
young man may redresse or purge
the same.
            
               The purging therefore or redressing
of the waies of youth, whereby
euery yong man may insist &amp; persist
in the right way of holinesse to
saluation, must bee in marking
straightly, and in taking heed carefully
to the whole course of his
life, in thought, word, and deede,
directing and instituting the same
according to the rule and expresse
direction of the word of God, in
the which, night and day he should
meditate &amp; exercise himselfe continually,
that therby his whole life,
and all the waies thereof, may bee
kept spotlesse and cleane from all
corruption of sinne, and the filthy
lusts of the flesh.Vse. Therefore, let all
young men apply all the actions &amp;
waies of their life to this touchstone
of Gods word: let them take
diligent heede to thought, word,
and deede, marke them narrowly,
examine and iudge them diligently
and vnpartially, according to
this rule and square, that by God
himselfe, they bee not strictly marked

here, and seuerely examined,
iudged and rewarded in the world
to come. If they finde their waies
to bee in some measure conformable
to Gods word (for none are
perfite) desire Christ to helpe their
imperfection, praise God for his
mercy and this measure of sanctification,
desiring increase thereof
and confirmation. If by taking
heede vnto their waies, and due
examination thereof, they finde
them disagreeable vnto the word
of God, then humbly prostrate
themselues in true repentance and
contritenesse of a broken and rent
heart, before the tribunall of that
great King and Iudge whom they
haue offended; desire earnestly remission
and cleansing of their sinfull
waies by the precious bloodshed
of Iesus Christ; vow and performe
reformation and conformation
of their waies hereafter, according
to Gods word, by a renewed
and sanctified life; and to
that effect, beg importunately with

that poor widow, frō the iust Iudge
of all mē, his holy sanctifying spirit
to be their directer &amp; leader in that
way of saluatiō, to the end thereof.
This way of yong men, vnto which
they shold take heed according to
Gods word so diligently, is threefold.
1. Their way of particular and
lawful vocatiō. 2. Their way of christian
&amp; ciuill manners. And 3. their
way of true godlines, the perfectiō
of all. According to this rule of the
word of God, let euery young man
therfore (I say) take heed &amp; examin▪
First, his way of the ordinarie and
particular vocatiō, God hath called
him to, if in the same he hath behaued
himselfe vprightly, &amp; vsed aright,
the talent that God hath giuē
him for that effect: for to none of
his seruants, but God hath allotted
&amp; giuē some special talēt &amp; gift, fit
to be vsed in a special &amp; particular
vocation; wherby in some measure
they may be profitable to church &amp;
Cōmonwealth, from the Son of the
Prince that sitteth on his throne, to

the sonne of the poorest begger by
the hie way side: to some hee hath
giuen a quicke wit and diuerse inclination
to diuers kindes of learning,
as Diuinitie, the Lawes, Phisicke,
&amp;c. wherein seuerally by euery
one, his glory may bee aduanced,
and the Church or Commonwealth
in some measure profited:
to others hee hath giuen of his spirit,
in wisedome, vnderstanding,
and knowledge to worke in all
manner of workemanship, as hee
did to Bezaleel and Aholiab,
               Exod. 31. 3. fitting
them for seuerall mechanicall and
handiecrafts: and for some one particular
of these two kindes of vocation,
that God hath giuen euerie
one from his cradle, a naturall inclination
and speciall gift therfore,
(if education bee ioyned) it doth euidently
appeare by experience.
Let euery young man then, noble
or ignoble, consider &amp; take heede
vnto this way of vocatiō, according
to Gods word, that if God hath fitted
him by some speciall gift and

inclination, he loose not, spend, nor
hide his talent by idlenes, for feare
of the punishment that Christ hath
mentioned in his worde therevnto:
for idlenesse and delicacie was
the sin of the primitiue world that
drew downe that fearefull deluge
vpon thē; idlenesse was the sin that
c
                  •
               ied down fire &amp; brimstone vpon
Sodome.
               Prou. 6. 11. It is the impouerisher and
destroyer of a Kingdome, Citie,
house, or man, as industry is the enricher.
The one crieth for Gods
curse on a people or person: the other
for a blessing. Idlenes is the
doore to let in sinne and the diuell
euen in the godliest. When Adam
was idle from dressing the garden,
he was tempted to eate of the forbidden
fruit, and did fall, and wee
in him: when Dauid was idle, hee
was drawen in adulterie and murder:
when Sampson was idle from
the warres, he fell a whooring with
Dalilah, and fearefull destruction
came vpon him. The little vnreasonable
creatures of God condemneth

it: therefore Salomon, Prou. 6. 6.
referreth the sluggard to the Pismire,
to behold her wayes and bee
wise: and Virgil saith of the Bees;
Illae continuo saltus 
                     •

                     que
                   hyemis memores, aestate laborē
Experiuntur, &amp; in mediū quesita reponū
                  
                     •
                  
               
Not like the Grashopper, who singeth
all the sommer, but starueth
in winter: as many Gentlemens
sonnes in their youth are idlely
brought vp by their parents, but in
the winter of olde age must beg, or
try many vnlawfull shifts, because
they cannot frame themselues to
worke, nor were not in their youth
trained vp to vertue. It is a pittie
that such should liue in a Kingdome
or commonwealth, but haue
the Apostles Law; He that laboureth
not, let him not eate. And a greater pitty
it is to see or suffer such idle bringing
vp, or rather bringing downe
to pouertie and destruction, in a ciuill
or well instituted kingdome or
commonwealth. God our heauenly

father euer worketh, in propagating,
conseruing, and gouerning
of his creature, so that if once hee
should withdrawe his hand, all
should perish; our soule also which
resembleth him, is called by Aristotle,
               
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               : that is a continuall operation.
As God then is euer occupied
in doing of good, so should
we be; and in so farre as we are idle,
so farre wee depart from likenesse
to God, and our owne soule. The
blessed and holy Angels also are
euer occupied, either in continuall
praising of God their Creator, or
in doing his message, for preseruation
&amp; ministring to the godly, and
punishing of the wicked, whereof
many examples are in the Scripture:
the glorious Sunne in his swift
motion compasseth the earth continually:
and assure thy selfe, whosoeuer
thou be, that albeit thou bee
idle from applying thy minde, or
exercising thy selfe in vertue while
thou art young, the diuell hee is
not idle, who compasseth the earth

too and fro, to intice thy minde to
vice, and lay snares before age
come, to draw thee to destruction
and a shameful end. Neither think,
albeit thou be a Noble or Gentlemans
sonne or heire, that hath
landes or ample possessions, that
therefore thou needest not, nor
should apply thy minde to vertue,
or thy hand to worke: the truely
noblest that euer was, Iesus Christ,
God &amp; man, whose creatures and
worke all Nobles and Kings are,
wrought with his hands vnder his
supposed father Ioseph, in the craft
of carpentarie, in all subiection, till
the time of his publike ministerie
came, wherein hee behoued to goe
about his true Fathers businesse.
Iacob a great Patriarch, and borne
to great possessions, euē the whole
land of Canaan, which flowed with
milke and hony, yet sent to seruice
by his parents, who loued him
more deerely and wisely then many
who cocker vp their children
now, and thinke it an indignitie to

put them to handie-crafts or seruice,
being a great deale lesse able
to sustaine them, nor hauing so sure
a promise that God wil so prouide
for them: yet hee being so great a
mans sonne, thought no shame nor
griefe to serue full 21. yeares in the
colde frost of the night without
sleepe, and hote sunne burning of
the day, and when hee had many
seruants and goods, yet still serued
painfully, albeit vnder an vnthankfull
Maister. Moses sometime called
the sonne of King Pharao, was
called by God to bee the leader of
his people to Canaan, from keeping
of sheepe in the field: Gideon, sonne
to Ioash, father or chiefe of the Ezrites,
who had many seruants, as is
euident, Iudges, 6. 27. was found
threshing wheate himselfe, when
the Angell called him to bee Iudge
of Israel: Saul, who is called, 1. Sam.
9. 1. the sonne of a man of Beniamin,
mighty in power, named Kish, was sent
to runne through many countries,
with one seruant onely a foote, to

seeke his fathers Asses, that were
lost, with no great prouision of money
or victualls, as appeareth vers.
7, 8. and thereafter called to bee
King of Israel: Dauid likewise from
keeping of sheepe: Elisha that great
Prophet, called from the Plough:
Amos from keeping of cattell: many
of the Apostles of Iesus Christ,
who shall iudge the twelue Tribes
of Israel, and whose doctrines are
the twelue foundations of the wall
of that spirituall Ierusalem, were called
from painefull fishing: Paul a
man of great learning and authoritie,
yet a Tent-maker: and if thy
parents (how noble or gentle soeuer
they bee) thinketh thee better
then these, or thou thy selfe; then
indeede thinke shame to worke, or
to apply thy minde to some kinde
of vertue or vocation: neither trust
onely to thy lands or possessions,
for God may giue Sathan power,
as hee did concerning Iob, to try
thee and take thy goods from thee
many waies, vnexpected and neuer

thought of. Seeing also he hath
giuen them to thee freely, as sufficient
meanes to increase and imploy
thy talent: &amp; as Salomon saith,
Prou. 17. 16. As a price in thy hand to
get wisedome; if in idlenesse notwithstanding,
without any vocation,
thou suffer the same to perish, and
waste the means &amp; price improfitably,
they shall make thee (howsoeuer
for a time the more honored &amp;
acceptable before mē) yet the more
inexcusable and vile before God,
whō thou so dishonourest: for many
of these forenamed, had greater
possessions then thou canst haue,
yet laboured with their hands. It
is not thy landes that maketh thee
noble or gentle, it is onely vertue:
Nobilita
                     •
                   sola est at
                     
                        
                     
                     que
                   vnica virtus; and
thy predecessors obtained this title
only by some vertuous acts, which
is deriued to thee; increase therefore
the same by vertue, &amp; impaire
it not. We reade of an ancient custome
and most laudable amongst
the Romans, that none was suffered

to goe in the publike streetes
without some instrument in his
hand, to be thereby known of what
vocation he was of, to shew he was
not an idle drone in the bee-hiue of
the Cōmonwealth, &amp; to teach him
that whatsoeuer hee was, not
to be ashamed of his calling. And
amongst the Indians in these daies,
before they eate, they vse to take
an account what they haue earned
or wonne. Iustinian, the Emperour
of Rome, exercised himselfe in the
lawes, and perfited the law of Nations:
Mithridates king of Pontus, was
a Phisitian, who first found out that
excellent compound called frō his
own name, Mithridatum: Quintus Cincinnatus,
was called frō the Plough
to be Dictator of Rome. And we read
of Dyonisius, who being expelled
from his Kingdome, that by the
vertue he learned in his youth, hee
liued in teaching a few youths in a
schoole, and therefore onely was
called backe to his Kingdome againe.
Homer, in commendation of

               Vlisses, accounteth this as a note of
great honour, mentionating that
he could make his owne ships himselfe.
Quintus Fabius a most noble
Roman, with his owne hands painted
the walls of the Temple of Salus,
and not thinking shame thereof,
but rather coūting it a laudable
and auowable thing, agreeable
with his honour &amp; degree, affixed
thereto, &amp; vnder wrote his name.
Achilles is recorded to haue bin so
cūning in cookery, that he thought
it no dishonor at a certaine time to
shew the same, in dressing a royall
and sumptuous supper to certaine
Ambassadours who came to him.
Constantine the Emperour also had
his liuing a long time (
                  •
               as it is
reported) by drawing. And a certaine
learned Philosopher in Grecia
vaunted, that his cloake &amp; the ring
hee wore on his finger, were of his
owne making, esteeming it a great
praise he could doe so. Therefore,
take example of these, that by thy
owne vertue thou maiest rather

shine before thy predecessors, then
to glance onely by their light: studie
to bee called, not onely one of
such a race, which is by thy parents,
but a vertuous one, of such a
race which is by selfe. By trusting
to lands or possessions, oft times
vertue is neglected, and infamie or
no fame followeth: when poore
mens sonnes, not hauing lands to
trust to, but leaning only to vertue
and Gods grace, come to great honour,
riches, and renowne: both
which, experience teacheth to all
men. The pouertie of such as are
idle, without any vocation, commeth,
as Salomon saith, like a traueller
in the hie way, or the necessitie
of an armed man, which is suddenly
or hastily: and therefore it is, that
so many Noblemen or Gentlemen
make away with their lands, which
their antecessours by their vertue
and hard purchase obtained and
left to them, they by vertue got it,
they by idlenesse &amp; vice consume
it. Hence aso it is, that so many old

and young sturdie beggers are in a
kingdome or citie: education without
vocation. From idlenesse also
in youth it is, that so many miserable
spectacles are seene, of so many
that goe to the gallowes, who behoued
to steale, because they applied
not their minde to any vertue
being young; dum vires anni
                     
                        
                     
                     que
                   sinebant,
and now could doe nothing
else. Hence it is that so much wickednesse
aboundeth, and is committed
in the world, as in the time
of Sodome and the primitiue world.
Whereby wee may know, that the
second destruction by fire (as the
first was by water) is not farre of.
In this clay age hence also it is, that
many gentlemen being shooed in
their cradle, and now barefooted
(as we say) in the saddle, are forced
(when Fortune failes them, or rather
when God punisheth their idle
vp-bringing without vertue) to
haue the cruell warres as their last
and best refuge to goe to, and to be
set before the deuouring mouth of

the Canon, and vnder the sharpe
edge of the sword, when in their
youth, if they had betaken themselues
to some honest and lawfull
vocation, they might haue liued
quieter at home, done more pleasingly
to God, beene more profitable
to Church or Commonwealth,
in their Country or elsewhere,
beene a greater comfort to
their friends, and left a better fame
and memorie to the posteritie after
them, to Gods glory, and the honour
of their Countrie and themselues
for euer. To conclude, from
hence as from the roote, proceedeth
all vice and euill, as out of an
vntilled ground proceedeth nothing
but weedes; Otium enim 
                     •
                  omes
vitiorum est, otia mentem ad mala
multa trahunt: all kinde of sinne ariseth
from idlenesse (as Adams fall
did from idlenesse in his charge,
Gen. 2. 15.) all kinde of sinne is
nourished by idlenesse, and idlenes
bringeth (as sinne to perfection):
so man to the end of sinne, which

is finall and fearefull destruction.
For God decreed &amp; appointed mā
to labor from the beginning, both
in his innocencie, as in the forenamed
place, and after his fall. Gen. 3.
19. In the sweate of his face that he
should eate bread, till hee returned
to the earth. Therefore, let euerie
young man examine and redresse
this his way, in the ordinarie vocation
that God with his special gifts
hath fitted him for, In taking heede
thereto, without idlenesse, or iniust
dealing therein, according to Gods
word, that the necessities of life may
be supplied, and hee be found rather
helpefull then chargeable to
any.
            Secondly, according to the rule
of Gods word, let euery yong man
take heed vnto the way of his manners,
to redresse the same in a godly
and comely forme, reuerencing &amp;
honouring, first, his superiours any
way, and elders: secondly, his equalls:
and thirdly, his inferiours.
Concerning the honouring of our

superiours &amp; elders, according to
Gods word; the first precept of our
dutie towards our neighbour, in
Gods Law, commandeth all yong
men, Honour thy father and thy mother,
where not onely our naturall parents,
but our superiours, as Magistrates,
Pastours, &amp;c. and our Elders
are vnderstood also, Leuit. 19.
32. Thou shalt rise vp before the hoare-head,
and honour the person of the olde
man, and feare thy God, I am the Lord:
likewise, 1. Tim. 5. 1. &amp; 17. where
the Apostle cōmandeth yong Timothie,
to exhort elders as fathers, and
elder women as mothers, &amp; saith,
that Elders which rule well, are
worthy of double honour: Examples
of this, wee haue many
in the holy &amp; sacred scripture also:
The prophane Hittites, did know
&amp; acknowledge this dutie to olde
Abraham, Gen. 23. 6. Iacob to his elder
brother Esau, Gen. 33. 3. when
he bowed himselfe 7. times to the
ground, till he came neere his brother;
Hannah to old Eli, 1. Sā. 1. 15.

The children of the Prophets to
Elisha, 2. King. 2. 15. with many
such: the precept also of the Ethnicks
was, Seniores reuerere: for if our
Superiours and elders bee not honoured
and duely reuerenced by
youth, they shall not be regarded,
if not regarded, not obeyed, if not
obeyed, wicked libertie, rebellion
and oppression shall arise, as the
Prophet sheweth, Isai 3. 5. The people
shall be oppressed one of another, and euery
one by his neighbour, the children shall
presume against the ancient, and the vile
against the honourable; and so, all shal
come vnto miserable confusion,
and at last to lamentable destruction.
Concerning the mutuall honouring
of our equals, let vs take
heed thereto, according to Gods
word. Rom. 12. 10. The Apostle of
Iesus Christ saith, Be affectionated to
loue one another with brotherly loue: In
giuing honour, goe one before another; so
that honour amongst equals, is as
the daughter of loue, and likewise
the mother that begetteth &amp; nourisheth

loue amongst neighbours,
whereof, some examples there are
also, and experience sufficiently
proueth the same, &amp; truely, where
there is not such mutuall honour
and louing salutations amongst equals
and friends, by this rudenesse
(as of beastes) there proceedeth
mistrust and suspicion, from suspicion
dislike, from dislike hatred,
from hatred, vnchristian breaking
forth in open dissention vpon the
least occasion offred, and so the
bond of peace and christian loue,
which is the life of Religion, is altogether
broken, and cast off, liuing
so, not as Christians, but as
rude, sauage, and cruel wild beasts,
maligning, detracting, despising,
and seeking the mutual destruction
of one another, which all Christians
should abhorre and studie to
preuent. And lastly, of the honor
and reuerence wee owe also to our
inferiours, according to Gods
word; the Apostle Peter in his 1. Epistle
2. 17. commandeth vs to honour

all men, for in the meanest man
that is, the Image of God is represented
before our eyes, yea, oftentimes
the true Image of Iesus
Christ, which is holinesse and sanctification,
is most seene in such,
which with all reuerence, loue and
humilitie, we should honour in thē,
and in others also, knowing that
we honour God chiefely in so doing,
as by contemning such, wee
contemne and despise God and his
image, with the humble and low
estate of Iesus Christ in them, and
are a discouragement and scandall
vnto such, mouing God thereby to
despise and refuse vs likewise, because
we contemne so his best mē
               bers,
whom the world fauoureth
not, because hee hath selected and
separate them from the world, and
the condemnation therof, abiding
it. Let all yong men therefore, so
humbly and courteously behaue
themselues to all persons, and of al
conditions or estates, hie or low,
that in taking heed so vnto their

wayes according to Gods worde,
they may first purchase and obtain
Gods fauour and loue, who resisteth
the proud, and giueth grace vnto the humble,
who are vile in their owne sight, as also
they may gayne the loue and
good will of all men, of meane or
great condition whatsoeuer, whom
they in humilitie and dutie so reuerence
and honour, and so they
may grow in grace and fauour (as
Christ did) with God and man. In
conference, gesture, &amp;c. let euery
yong man also take heed vnto his
way of manners, to redresse the
same according to Gods word: In
conference, 1. speake aduisedly,
and that very sparingly, as Salomon
teacheth, Pro. 17. 27. Hee that hath
knowledge, spareth bis words: and as the
Ethnicks command was,

                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               : Audito multa, loquere pauca;
Heare many things, but speake
few. God hath giuen two eares, as
receiuers in; but one tongue onely,
to dispence moderately out againe,
and by much babling, a foole bewrayeth

and betrayeth himselfe.
2. Speake not commonly, (chiefly
amongst thy betters or elders) except
thou bee asked or spoken to,
for Salomon saith,Iob. 32. 7. Pro. 17. 28. that euen
a foole, when hee holdeth his peace, is
counted wise, and he that stoppeth his lips
prudent: therefore the wise man of
this age is pictured with a padlock
vpon his lips, for as of an arrow
vnshot, so of a word vnspoken (as
wee say) proceeded neuer harme.
3. Speake not before thy elders or
betters, but patiently wait, without
interruption or carping at their
speech, till they haue fully spoken,
according to the example of Elihu,
Iob. 32. 46. (now Elihu had waited
till Iob had spoken, for they were
more ancient in yeeres then he.) Therefore
Elihu the sonne of Barachel, the Buzite
answered, and said, I am yong in
yeeres, and yee are ancient, therefore I
doubted and was afraid to shew you mine
opinion, (suspecting and fearing his
owne wisedome, in humilitie, and
giuing place vnto his Elders, as all

yong men should) for I said, the daies
shall speake, and the multitude of yeeres
shall teach wisedome. The contempt
of this, when young men would
take vpon them to giue better coū
               sell
to Rehoboam, being wise in their
owne conceit, then the old beaten
counsellers of Salomon, 1. Kin. 12.
and the forsaking of the experienced
wisedome of these ancient and
graue men, for the rash vnexperienced
foolishnesse of these young
giddy heads, that were brought
vp with him, made him to loose
the kingdome of Israel to him and
his posteritie thereafter. Not excluding,
but sometimes more wisedome
may bee learned from the
mouth of a yong man, then of the
most ancient, as it pleaseth God to
distribute his gifts, extraordinarily,
or in greater mesure; as he did to
yong Dauid, Salomon, Daniel, &amp;c. and
sometimes, according to the Prouerbe,
Qui plus menti, non etiam plus
mentis habet; hee that hath the whitest
beard, hath not euer the ripest

wit, nor soundest iudgement, alwaies
let none that is ancient, bee
therefore despised, nor none that
is yong, so presume. 4. Speake, as
moderately, so modestly, and bee
not hastie or sudden therein, for of
them that bee hasty, Salomon saith,
Pro. 29. 20. that there is m
                     •
                  re hope of a
foole then of such; and as the wise man
hath commaunded, 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               .
ne lingua pracurrat
menti, let not thy tongue runne before
thy minde, seeing it should be
the minds interpreter onely, and
the mind should speake inwardly
to an ende, before the voyce expresse
outwardly the sense &amp; meaning
thereof, not setting the cart
before the horses, or the plough to
runne before the oxen. Periculosa temeritas,
rashnesse or hastinesse in
word or deed is perilous. And in
all thy speech or conference take
heed, according to Gods word, to
speake the trueth onely, abhorring
from lying, as from Sathan
the father thereof: to speake euill

of no man, albeit thou mayst
truely, and to abstaine not onely
from euill words, which corrupteth
good manners, as the Apostle saith,
but also from ieasting, which is not
comely, and all idle words, of euery
one whereof, wee must render account
at the day of Iudgement as Christ
the trueth testifyeth: speake all to
edification in knowledge or godlinesse;
giue to none the least offence
iustly by thy speech, and desire to
profite all men thereby, and so as
euery one is knowne to be such a
Countrie man or of such a Kingdome,
by his tongue or speech, so
by thy good speech and language
thou shalt be knowne to belong to
God the wel-spring of goodnesse,
and to the kingdome of Heauen,
the land and countrie of that spirituall
Canaan. To this effect desire
God by his holy Spirit, to purge
and sanctifie thy heart first, which
is the root, and out of the abundance
whereof the mouth speaketh, and then
with the Prophet Dauid, to set a

watch before thy lips, and a barre before
thy tongue: that as wel in thy speech
as actions, his will may bee done in
earth, as it is in heauen. In thy gesture
also take heed to behaue thy selfe
dutifully &amp; comely towards al mē,
according to Gods word, without
all rudenesse on the one part, or
curious affectation of apish noueltie
on the other part, rather to bee
contemned, then any way imitated
by any ingenious young man or
person whatsoeuer. 1. As thou art
commanded. Leuit. 19. 32. thou shalt
rise vp before the hoare-head, and honour
the person of the old man, not rudely
sitting, or not giuing place to them
whom God hath blessed with many
and good yeeres, but so doing
to them, and honouring such, as
thou wouldst be of thy yongers, if
God so long prolong thy life, and
respecting their infirmitie by weak
old age, with consideration of thy
better abilitie in thy yong &amp; strōg
yeeres, who may better stand then
they, as also before thy betters

thou shalt rise, or them, to whom
thou art bound in dutie, according
to Salomons example, 1. King. 2. 19.
2. Stand, where thy beters sit, according
to the example of Abraham,
Gen. 18. 8. And he tooke butter
and milke and the calfe which he had prepared,
&amp; set before them, and stood himselfe
by them, vnder the tree while they did
eate.; where, notwithstanding, i
                  •
                he
had pleased, hee might haue commanded
a seat for himselfe.
            3. When thou commest to appeare
before thy betters or elders,
in a comely fashion shew the reuerence
of thy heart towards them,
by bowing the knee of thy bodie
before them, according to the example
of sundry in the Scripture,
as Abraham, Genes. 18. 2. when hee
saw the Angels a farre off, he came
to them, and bowed himselfe to the
ground: also Gen. 23. 7. &amp; 12. And
he bowed himselfe before the people of the
land of the Hittites: so Lot to the two
Angels, Gen. 19. 1. Iacob to Esau,
Gen. 33. 3. Iosephs brethren to him,

Gen. 42. 6. Salomon to his mother,
1. King. 2. 19. with many others,
but ch
                  •
               efly, that example of the
yong man, who came to Christ,
Mark. 10. 17. And when 
                     •
                  ee was gone
out on the way, there came one running,
and kneeled to him, and asked him, Good
Master, what shall I doe, that I may possesse
eternall life? shewing so the honour
of his heart to Christ, by this
outward gesture of his body, and
reuerent speech of his mouth, in
calling him Good Master. 4. Set
not thy selfe downe in the chiefest
place any where, but rather take
the lowest roome, that those that
haue authoritie, may rather set thee
vp with honour, and thou be called
humble, then displace and set thee
downe with dishonour and shame,
and thou bee called proud: according
to the Parable of Christ, to
the guestes in the Pharises house,
Luke 14. 8. When thou sha
                     •
                  t be 
                     •
                  idden
of any man to a wedding, set not thy
selfe downe in the chiefest place, &amp;c. But
when thou art bidden, goe and sit downe

in the lowest roome, &amp;c. for whosoeuer exalteth
himselfe shal be brought low, and he
that humbleh himselfe shall be exalted.
Fiftly and lastly, as for the vncouering
of the head, and all other
points of good manners in Christian
and ciuill societie, according
to the rule of the Apostle generally;
Let all things be do
                     ••
                   decently, in loue,
without dissimulation: being as the
spring, from whence our reuerence
and honouring one of another
should proceede; and the end likewise
to bee loue out of a pure heart,
               1. Tim. 1. 5. 
               and
of good conscience, and of faith vnfa
                     ••
                  ed.
Thirdly and last of all, let euerie
young man, according to the prescript
rule of Gods worde, take
heede vnto his way of godlinesse
and religion, to redresse &amp; cleanse
the same, which indeed is the most
profitable vocation of all others:
for as the Apostle saith; Godlinesse is
great gaine,
               1. Tim. 4 8. 
               and for bodily exercise it profiteth
little: but godlinesse is profitable
vnto all things, which hath the promise of
the life present, and of that that is to come.

Salomon also, Prou. 14. 27. saith; that
The feare of the Lord is a well-spring of
life, to auoid all the snares of death: it is a
most precious jewell, the comfort,
glory, and value whereof, surpasseth
all vnderstanding: the straight
way whereof, albeit displeasant &amp;
hard to the flesh for a time, yet it is
most delectable &amp; pleasant to the
spirit and soule for euer. It is a tree
hauing (albeit gall in the roote) yet
hony in the top, whose fruit endureth
for euer.Prou. 14. 26. 
               And in the feare of the
Lord is an assured strength. Therefore,
seing it is more amply spokē of before,
I cease now with this exhortation
only of th' Apostle to al yong
men,Tit. 2. 12, 13. concerning the same; Let euery
one embrace the grace of God, that bringeth
saluation vnto all men, which hath
appeared, and teacheth vs that wee should
denie vngodlinesse and worldly lusts, and
that we should liue soberly and righteously,
and godly in this present world, looking
for the blessed hope and appearing of the
glory of the mighty God, and of our Sauiour
Iesus Christ, who gaue himselfe for

vs, that he might redeeme vs from all iniquitie,
and purge vs, to be a peculiar people
vnto himselfe, zealous of good workes, forgetting
that which is behinde,Phil 3. and endeuouring
our selues to that which is before,
and following hard toward the marke, for
the price of the hie calling of God in Christ
Iesus, hauing our conuersation in heauen
continually, from whence wee looke for the
Sauiour, euen the Lord Iesus Christ: counting
all thinges dung that wee may win
him, and may bee found in him, endeuouring
onely that wee may know him, and
the vertue of his resurrection, and the fellowship
of his afflictions, and bee made
conformable to his death, that at last we
may be fashioned likewise vnto his glorious
body, according to the working whereby
he is able, euen to subdue all things vnto
himselfe. In the meane time, whatsoeuer
things are true,
               Phil. 4. 
                     •
                  . 
               whatsoeuer things are honest,
whatsoeuer things are iust, whatsoeuer
things are pure, whatsoeuer things pertaine
to loue, whatsoeuer things are of
good report, if there bee any vertue, or if
there be any praise, let vs thinke on these
things to doe the same, and the God of

peace shall be with vs: here by grace,
and wee with him for euer hereafter
in glory.
            We must redres our waies the Prophet
saith here, In taking heede thereto
according to Gods word. We must not
then read, heare, or know onely the
word of God, but practise &amp; do the
same, in purging &amp; taking heed to
our waies according thereunto. It is
that good seed that Christ speakes
of, which must not only be receiued
with ioy, but must be retained and
laid vp in a good and honest heart,
to bring forth good fruite, according
to the measure of Gods grace.
We must doe as Israel did, Exo. 19.
7, 8. and 24. 3. when Moses proposed
Gods Commandements, vnto
them, they answered, All that the
Lord hath commanded wee will doe: not
heare or know them onely: So Moses
commandement and exhortation
to the people, Deut. 4. 6. Behold
I haue taught you ordinances and lawes,
as the Lord my God hath commanded me,
that yee should doe euen so, within the

land whither yee goe to possesse it: keepe
them therefore and do
                  •
                
               them, for that is
your wisedome, &amp;c. The peoples desire
to Moses againe was, chap. 5. 27.
Goe thou neare, and 
                     •
                  eare all that the
Lord our God saith: and declare thou vnto
vs all that the Lord our God saith vnto
thee, and wee will heare it and doe it.
The condition also that God maketh
by Moses, that hee will exalt &amp;
blesse them is, chap. 28. 1. If thou shalt
obey diligently the voyce of the Lord thy
God, and obserue and doe all his Commandements
which I command thee, then
the Lord thy God will set thee on high, and
all these blessings shall come vnto thee,
&amp;c. So 19. 9. Keepe therefore the wordes
of this couenant, and doe them, that yee
may prosper in all other thinges that yee
shall doe. So 30. 14. The word is very
neare vnto thee, euen in thy mouth, and
in thy heart, for to doe it. Iohn the Baptist,
Matth. 3. 8. said vnto the Pharisies
that which all men shoulde
doe; Bring forth fruits therefore worthy
of amendement of life. And now also is
the axe put to the roote of the trees, therefore

euery tree which bringeth not foorth
good fruite, is hewe
                     •
                   downe and cast into
the fire. And Christ our Sauiour
saith, Matt. 7. 17. Euery tree is knowne
by his fruites, for euery good tree bringeth
forth good fruit: and a corrupt tree bringeth
forth euill fruits. A good tree cannot
bring forth euill fruit: neither can a corrupt
tree bring forth good fruit. For doe
men gather grapes of thornes, or figges of
thistles? Therefore, so let our light shine
before men,
               Matth. 6. 
               that they may see our good
workes, and glorifie God our heauenly
father. For as in Morall Philosophie
it is said; Omnis virtus in actione consistit;
all vertue consisteth in action:
so truely in diuine and true Philosophie,
it may be likewise said, that
all Religion and Christian vertues
consisteth in practise, and not in
pratling of them onely. The figge-tree
that Christ accursed, had a
faire shew by his leaues a farre off,
that he was like to haue fruit also,
but because he had none, therefore
by Christs curse hee withered presently.
It is not a faire shew likewise

or pretence, and profession of
religion that God doth accept; but
wee must with our outward shew,
haue the inward substance and life
of Religion, good workes proceeding
of true faith and loue. Wee
must not onely professe in word,
but in deede and action also, imitating
not onely Christs sayings,
but his holy life and doings. Luke,
6. 46. hee saith, But why call you mee
Master, Master, and doe not these thinges
which I speake. A seruant not onely
acknowledgeth his Maister in
word, but must also in deede; hee
must not onely heare and know his
Masters will, but except hee doe it
also, hee shall be beaten with many
stripes. Luk. 12. Mat. 7. 21. Not euery
one that saith vnto me Lord, Lord, (saith
our Sauiour) shall enter into the Kingdome
of heauen, but hee that doth my
Fathers will which is in heauen. Many
will say vnto me in that day, Lord, Lord,
haue we not by thy name prophesied? and
by thy name cast out diuells? and by thy
name done many great workes? And then

will I professe to them I neuer knew you:
depart from mee yee that worke iniquitie.
Whosoeuer then heareth my words, and
doth the same, is like the wise man that
buildeth his house vpon a rocke, &amp;c. Seeing
God soweth the seede of his
word in our hearts, hee looketh for
a ripe haruest of good works: if he
hath planted vs as vines in his vine
                  •
               
yard, or oliue branches in the stock
Christ, he looketh that in him wee
should bring forth sweete grapes,
and shew that wee liue in him, by
bringing forth good and pleasant
fruit in him. Gal. 5. 25. If we liue in the
spirit, let vs walke also in the spirit. Wee
must not like that barren and vnprofitable
fig-tree, Luk. 13. 7. delay
to giue fruite to our Maister from
yeare to yeare, lest we be cut down
and throwne ouer the hedge for
euer, in his fierce wrath; but in our
youth and tender age, we must bud
and bring forth sweete &amp; pleasant
fruits, such as he expecteth. Christ
Iesus abolished the curse of the
Law by his comming; but hee came

not to take away the Law it selfe, and the
Prophets, but to fulfill them. As hee
therefore perfitly obeyed Gods
Lawe, so that there was no sinne at all
found in him: so must his members
here on earth, striue in some measure
to obey Gods Lawe, and to
come to that perfection that is here
permitted by Gods Spirit to the
elect to attaine vnto, and that there
be no sin found raigning in them.
For there is none, no not one man
in this world, but sinne is found in
him: neither was there euer any other
waies, (except Iesus Christ,
God and man) but wee must striue
and endeuour, by the powerfull
operation of Gods sanctifying Spirit
assisting vs, euery one of vs, that
if sinne abide in vs, and the law of
sin bee in our flesh, yet that it beare
not dominion or ouer-rule ouer
vs, but that in the spirit wee may
haue the law of righteousnesse subiugating
and weakening the other
daily more and more, till at the last
by grace, both soule and body bee

captiuated vnto Christs obedience,
and take on his yoake, that both
likewise hereafter may bee in and
with Christ, victorious and triumphant
in glory. Amongst Pastours,
Whosoeuer shall obserue and teach Gods
Commandements,
               Mat. 5. 19. their reward shall
be great, they shall be called great in the
kingdome of heauen: so amongst the
hearers and flocke,Luke, 11 28. 
               Blessed are they
that heare the word of God and keepe it.
The true Pastour maketh his voice
sound like Arons bells, before his
flocke: And the sheepe heare his voyce,
and hee calleth his owne sheepe by name,
               Ihon, 10.
               and leadeth them out. And when hee
hath sent forth his owne sheepe, hee goeth
before them, and the sheepe follow him, for
they know his voyce. Where, to see the
necessity of good works, &amp; doing
of Gods word therin, we may consider
the dutie both of the true Pastours
of Christ, and of the true
sheepe of Christ, with both their
markes, whereby so they may bee
easily knowne; the one not to bee
Woolues in Lambs skins, theeues,

robbers, and hirelings, the other
not to bee sheepe of another Pastour
or pasture. True Pastours
here then must goe before their
sheepe: first, by an incorrupt doctrine
or voyce: and secondly, by
the footesteps of an incorrupt conuersation
and life.
            Concerning the first, Christs
charge to Peter is; Louest thou me? t
                     •
                  en
feede my flocke. So that Pastours loue
to Christ, is approued before God,
to their owne conscience, and before
men, by feeding only his flocke,
the woe of the contrary whereof
is set downe plainely. Ezek. 24. 2. Wo

                     •
                  ee to the shepheards of Israel that feede
themselues; should not the sheepheards feed
the flockes? Also 2. Tim. 4. 1. Pauls
charge to Timothie, I charge thee therefore
before God, and before the Lord Iesus
Christ, which shall iudge the quicke and
the dead at his appearing, and in his kingdome;
Preac
                     •
                   the word, be instant in season
and out of season, improue▪ rebuke,
exhort, with all long suffering &amp; doctrine.
So here is Christs charge, and the

Apostle of Christs charge, the one
to Peter, the other to Timothy, and so
to all Ministers, that they should
make their flockes heare their
voice, and sound the same before
them. For as Iohn was a voice in the
wildernesse to prepare the way of
the Lord at his first comming in
humilitie: so they must bee now
voices, crying in the desart of this
world, to prepare the way against
the Lords second comming in glorie,
by Repent, bringing low euerie
high vnhumbled hill; and by Beleeue,
exalting and comforting
againe euery low valley and humbled
soule in Gods presence: so they
must loose and binde, open and
shut, set life and death before euery
one: and, W
                     •
                  e bee to them if they preach
not the Gospell:
               Iohn, 12. 
               or therein loue their owne
glory and praise of men, more then the
glory of God: seeing the King hath
sent them out to call all men to his
banquet, to eate of the fat calfe.
God hath made them Angells to
cry before that last day; Rise dead

folke in sinne, prepare to come to
Iudgement, cast off the corruption
of the lustes of the flesh, put on renouation
of the spirit, &amp; be sanctified
in body and soule, that in both
hereafter you may be also glorified,
they haue concredit to them
the trumpet of Gods voice, at
whose sound the high and proud
walles of the Iericho of euery mans
heart must fall, and therefore must
compasse them, &amp; blow the trumpets
diligently and often.Isa. 61. 2. 
               They are
sent that they should preach the Gospell to
the poore, heale the 
                     •
                  roken hearted, preach
deliuerance to the captiues, and recouering
of sight to the blind: that they should set at
libertie them that are bruised, and that
they should preach the acceptable yeare of
the Lord. This then is the voyce that
they should vtter, and this is the
voyce the true sheepe should follow
and know.
            Concerning the second marke of
true Pastours, to wit, their going
also before their flocke in good
example and holy life, according

to their owne voyce, doing the
same. Christs charge likewise to
his Apostles is, Matt. 5. 16. Let your
light so shine before men, that they may
see your good workes, and glorifie your
Father which is in heauen. The neglect
and transgression whereof, hee
sheweth in the Scribes and Pharisies,
(whose righteousnesse except
theirs exceeded,Mat. 5. 20. hee telleth his
Disciples they should neuer enter
in the kingdome of heauen) Matt.
23. 2. in these wordes, saying; The
Scrbes and Pharisies sit in Moses seate:
and therefore whatsoeuer they bid you
obserue, that obserue and do
                     •
                  , but after
their workes doe not, for they say, and doe
not, (as alas, too many such in these
our daies doe.) The Apostlte Paul
also, Rom. 2. 21. to this effect, saith;
Thou therefore that teachest another, teachest
thou not thy selfe? thou that preachest
a man should not steale, doest thou
steale? Thou that saiest a man should not
commit adultery, doest thou commit adulterie?
thou that abhorrest idols, committest
thou sacriledge? And therefore in his

charge to Timothy he saith; But thou
O man of God flee from these thinges,
(meaning pride, auarice, &amp;c.) and
follow after righteousnesse, godlines, faith,
loue, patience, and meekenes, &amp;c. Which
many men preaching onely to
others, may, and hath become notwithstāding
reprobates thēselues:
but the Apostle hauing in his own
life, first practised his own doctrine
to others, and like a Cocke,
wakened and raised himselfe, first
by his voyce; sheweth the like
dutie to all other Pastours, in a holy
li
                  •
               e to goe before their sheepe,
when he saith; Be ye followers of mee:
and in another place adding, as I
am of Christ. For as Aaron had vpon
his breast, Vrim &amp; Thumim, that is,
knowledge and holinesse: so must
euery true Minister haue the same
in his breast and heart, the one to
preach well, and goe before in
voyce; the other to liue well, and
goe before in good example: For I
will be sanctified (saith God) in them
that beare mee. And if they that

should be the light of their flocke,
be darknes, how great is that darknes?
For as Am
                     •
                  rose in Psalm. 119.
saith, Vita bona sine doctrina 
                     •
                  abet
gratiam, sed doctrina sine vita integritatē
non 
                     •
                  abet. And as Christ sheweth,
if that seruāt, that knoweth not his
Masters will, and doeth not the
same, shall bee beaten with fewe
stripes; what shall be to him, who
knoweth not his Masters will, and
yet in some measure doeth the
same? But he that knoweth it, yea,
teacheth others to know it,Rom. 2. 19. 
               and persuadeth
himselfe that hee is a guide to the
blind, a light of them that are in darkenes,
an instructer of them that lacke discretion,
a teacher of the vnlearned, &amp;c. and yet
doth not the same himself, but wilfully
runnes into the pit, truely hee
is worthie and shall be beaten with
many &amp; grieuous stripes one day:
Lorde graunt, many in this age
may preuent them. Iudas preached
Christ, yet sold him through couetousnesse,
and was a child of perdition.
Balam said, All what the Lord

shall command, that will I speake, yet
was a false couetous Prophet, and
likewise perished. Yea, the Diuell
himselfe could crie out, that hee
knew he was that Iesus the sonne
of God, and so gaue publike testimonie
of Christ, yet he persecuted
him, and now is condemned. Many
in that last day, with their true
preaching, shall plead miracles also,
yet because they wrought iniquitie,
they shall heare that fearefull
Away from mee, I know you not.
Therefore let all true Pastors goe
before the flocke in good and godly
example also, in life &amp; doctrine,
so shining as bright lampes and
starres in Christs right hand or familie,
saying and doing according
to the counsell of the same Ambrose
ibid. Nec. vita sit sine doctrina, nec doctrina
sine vita, sed vna adstipuletu
                     •
                   alteri:
and this is the second marke,
whereby true Pastors are knowne
by, Matth. 7. 17. For by their f
                     •
                  u
                     •
                  tes
(saith Christ) you shall know them, for
as from Vrim or knowledge must

proceed the ringing of the bels of
Gods word before the people to
heare; so from Thumim or holines,
must proceed the pomegranates, pleasant
&amp; sauory fruits of good works
to be seene and imitated of Gods
people, that as they are followers
of Christ, so they may be followers
of them againe (as the Apostle
saith of himselfe.) The Lorde of
the haruest, increase the number of
such painefull &amp; godly labourers,
who may not onely bee diligent in
preaching, but beeing zealous of
good works also, may shine in a
good life, before the flocke concredit
to their charge, and by these
two markes, bee knowne so to bee
true Pastours, &amp; in his owne time,
remoue these rauening woolues,
clothed in lambes skinnes, who vsurpe
like lords, ouer the Lords inheritance▪
seeking to feede themselues
and not the flocke, no waies
considering, that if Labans sheepe
were kept by Iacob so carefully in
the frost of the night without

sleepe, and in the burning heate
of the day; that much more the
sheepe of Iesus Christ, bought by
his owne heart-blood, should bee
with a carefull eye ouer-seene and
fed, tithing the mint &amp; cumming
seed, but omitting weightier matters;
stealing, killing and deuouring
Christs flocke, &amp; beating out their
fellow seruants: their separation
with hypocrites is at hand; the
Lord graunt they may speedily
preuent it.
            The two like markes of Christs
true Sh
                  ••
               pe and Sheepefolde,
are, First, they heare and know
their Pastors voyce: and Secondly,
as hee goeth before them in an
holy life, so they follow him; then
as hee is not dumbe to speake, so
they are not deafe to heare, they
heare then his voyce▪ they know it,
and will not follow the voyce of a
stranger; so that God giueth them
knowledge and discretion, not ignorance,
to bee a mother of their
deuotion, no
                  •
                fearefull simplicitie,

to be led euery where: if the scriptures
be hid, they are not to them,
but to those that perish: they search
the Scriptures, their chiefe Pastors
voice, which testifieth of himselfe,
they trie the spirits, if they bee of
God or no; and if an Angell from
heauen should lay any other foundation,
except that which is layd.
Iesus Christ the Lambe; or should
teach any other doctrine, then
that which the holy Apostles haue
taught, they should hold him accursed:
they are as liuely stones in
Sion, builded onely vpon the foundation
and doctrine of the holy Apostles:
they doe follow precisely
and onely the voyce and written
word of Iesus Christ, their chiefe
Pastor, and Shepheard of their
soules, which soundeth daily in the
middest of his Church and family,
accounting all other voyces to bee
of theeues, hirelings, and dissembling
woolues: they are in Christ,
who is the light of the world, and
in whom is no darknes,Io. 8. 12. and according

to the Apostles commaund,
they striue to grow in grace
                     •
                  ,
               Pet. 3. 18. 
               and in the
knowledge of our Lord and Sauiour Iesus
Christ: so true sheepe must heare
the Pastors voyce, receiuing the
seed that is sowen; they must know
his voyce, discerning if it be good
seed or no, wheate or popel that is
sowed. And thirdly, (which is
the second marke also of the true
sheepe) they must bring forth good
fruite thereby, according to the
measure of Gods grace in them.
The Pastor soundeth his voyce,
and they heare and know it, and he
goeth before them, and this must
be their following of him, by hearing,
commeth their faith, so by
their faith and from the same, as
the fruit and effect, (if it bee liuely
and true) proceedeth, and must
proceed, this imitation of good
workes, they must follow their Pastor,
as he is a follower of Christ,
but if hee bee not, according to
Christs counsell and command,
what he biddeth obserue, that obserue

and doe, but after his workes
doe not, (if hee say and doe not)
then follow the chiefe Pastor Iesus
Christ onely, who hath gone before
vs, in a most perfect and holy
example of life,; as for him, hee
riseth or falleth to his owne Master,
and is to be left to God, whose
seruant he is: For, that the hearing
and knowledge onely of Gods
voyce and word, is improfitable to
our saluation, without the practising
of the same in an holy life and
conuersation by a true faith in
Christ, the Apostle Paul testifieth,
Rom. 2. 13. For the hearers of the law
(saith hee) are not righteous before
God, but the doers of the law shall bee
iustified. And the Apostle Saint.
Iames 1. 22. giueth an expresse cō
               mandement
to all Christians, saying,
Be ye doers of the word, and not hearers
onely, deceiuing your owne selues: so
that we deceiue our selues greatly,
when we thinke that we haue done
our dutie, when we haue heard and
knowne Gods word, no, the diuell

and reprobates doe so also, but to
vs, who looke to bee saued, by
Christs blood &amp; passion, the word
of God must bee powerfull to saluation,
God working with it in our
hearts, begetting and increasing a
liuely and true faith in vs, which
must shew it selfe by the fruite of
charitie and good workes: when
God speaketh vnto vs, &amp; vttereth
his voyce by our ordinary Pastors,
we must take heed, if we haue that
inward feeling, which the Apostles
confessed they had at the hearing
of Christ, Luke 24. 32. (for the
same spirit which wrought in them
then, worketh so now also in the
hearts of the Elect) And they sayd
betweene themselues, did not our hearts
burne within vs, while hee talked with vs
by the way, and when hee opened to vs
the Scriptures? Let vs consider if we
haue this fire of the mouing and
quickning spirit of God,Mark. 13. who worketh
together with his word in our
hearts; let vs examine, if by this
powerfull operation of hearing

Gods word, faith and repentance
bee begotten or encreased in our
hearts. Let vs try againe, if this
repentance bee true, by abstaining
(by Gods grace) euer thereafter
from sinne, that it raigne not in vs;
and if our faith bee liuely (by not
onely abstaining and abhorring so
from euil) but also doing good and
godly workes, according to our
power, &amp; the measure of our faith,
and Gods grace in vs, following
the example of the poore widow,
albeit we haue but little, yet thereof
to impart somewhat to Christs
members, laying it vp so in his treasurie,
&amp; then we are the truesheep;
for the Pastour maye preach,
and we duely heare his voyce; but
except he goe before in a holy life,
and we follow after in a sanctified
conuersation, talke that wee haue
faith, as wee will, yea that thereby
wee could remooue mountaines,
cast out Diuells, and worke
many miracles (as many reprobates
shall pleade at that day) in

Christs name, wee are notwithstanding,
but as tinckling cimballs,
if wee haue not charitie and good
workes, and shal receiue that fearefull,
Away from mee, I know you not.
Christ is offered to vs in his word,
we must not onely take him in our
mouth, by hearing, but by a liuely
and true faith, wee must chew and
eate him, by vnfained loue &amp; charitie
digest him, and by our good
workes &amp; holy conuersation, shew
that we are renewed, ingrafted, and
growne in him: so that hee may be
not onely ours, but vs, and wee not
only his, but him: he is that fruitfull
vine, if we be then in him, we must
bee fruitfull branches: the fig-tree
was commanded to be cut downe,
because it did beare no fruit: the
naturall Oliues were reiected, because
they lost their fatnesse; if they
had beene the sonnes of Abraham,
they had done the workes of Abraham;
if we be the sonnes of God by
adoption, and true members of
Christ, wee must learne of him, for

hee was humble and meeke, wee
must be holy as he is holy, else wee
haue no parte in him. It is not
enough to heare the Kings seruants
message, but without excuse
wee must come to his supper and
eate of the fat killed calfe, in the
white wedding garment of holinesse
and a godly life. Hee that saith
that hee loueth God, and yet hateth his
neighbour, he is a lyar: and he that saith
that hee loueth God, and keepeth
not his Commandements, is a lyar
also; the reason is giuen by the Apostle
plainely, 1. Iohn, 5. 3. For this
is the loue of God, that we keepe his Commandements,
and his Command
                     •
                  ments
are not greeuous. And also, In this wee
know that wee loue the children of God,
when wee loue God and keepe his Commandements.
The thing that Iesus
Christ (the first &amp; the last) sheweth
that hee tooke notice and knowledge
of in the seuen Churches, to
whom he writes in the Reuelation,
(and vnder their name to his whole
Church militant to the end) is, I

know thy workes. Reuel. 2. 2, 9, 13. 19.
and 3. 1, 8, 15. Also when that glorious
Iudge of all flesh shall come,
and all his holy Angells with him,
and shall sit vpon the throne of his
glorie, there to iudge and reward
all the Nations of the earth, that
shall be gathered before him; hee
shall iudge euery one according
to his workes: for in that great and
last day, he shall say vnto the sheep
at his right hand; Come yee blessed of
my Father, inherit y
                     •
                  e the kingdome prepared
for you from the foundations of the
world: the reason, For I was hungred,
and ye gaue me meate; I thirsted, and yee
gaue me drinke; I wa
                     •
                   a stranger, and you
lodged me; I was naked, and you clothed
me; I was sicke, and you visited me; I was
in prison, and you came to me. And the
contrary shall hee say to the reprobate
goates at his left hand, who
did not the same, and must depart
into euerlasting paine. For albeit
it be most true, that faith onely iustifieth
before God, &amp; whosoeuer
beleeueth that Christ is the Sonne

of God shall bee saued; because
God he seeth the heart, and searcheth
the most inward &amp; deepest
cogitations thereof; and many hath
beleeued with the theefe at the last
houre, and in Gods mercy haue
beene saued so, onely by faith. Yet,
as the Apostle saith, Iam. 2. 24. Wee
see, that of workes a man is iustified, and
not of faith onely: because wee cannot
enter into the heart, to perceiue
and behold the inward faith: but
by the fruits wee see it onely, and
that a man by such a fruitfull, true,
&amp; liuely faith, is iustified: for good
workes (which alas in these daies
are rare, as faith &amp; loue their roote
is colde, and almost none left vpon
the earth) are the way wherein wee
must walke, to iustification, albeit
not the matter or cause thereof:
they are not the euidence of our
faith, as saith the Apostle, Iames, 2.
18. Shew me thy faith out of thy workes,
and I will shew thee my faith by my
workes. There is their nature &amp; vse,
they are the assurance to vs of our

election, and the makers sure of the
same, and whosoeuer hath time,
meanes, and opportunitie (as few
are but hath in some measure) to
doe good workes, (whereby their
election may be confirmed to their
owne conscience, their faith in
Christ shewed and testified before
the world, God their heauenly Father
thereby glorified, and his children
their brethren therby strengthened)
and yet notwithstanding
doth not: verily, howsoeuer they
say that they haue faith, Gods Spirit
&amp; word testifieth the contrarie,
and that it is a dead faith they brag
of, (which Sathan himselfe hath,
and trembleth, verse, 19.) which
being dead in it selfe, can neuer apprehend
nor apply that true life of
the soule, Iesus Christ and his righteousnesse,
the godlies onely comfort;
for faith worket
                     •
                   with, &amp; by works,
(as the fire doth by heate) &amp; through
workes is faith made perfit; as the Apostle
testifieth, and as hee reasoneth,
Iames, 2. 14. What au
                     ••
                  leth it my brethren,

though a man saith hee hath faith,
when he hath no workes; can the faith saue
him? For if a brother or a sister be naked,
and destitute of daily foode, and one of
you say vnto them; depart in peace, warme
your selues, and f
                     •
                  ll your bellies, notwithstanding
you giue them not those thinges
which are needefull to the body, what
helpeth it? Euen so the faith, if it haue no
workes, is dead in it selfe. And after confirmation
of this by the example of
Abraham &amp; Rachab, he concludeth;
For as the body without the spirit is dead,
euen so the faith without workes is dead.
Wee see then, that as workes without
faith iustifieth not, (For whatsoeuer
is done without faith is sinne) euen
so faith without workes, (being
dead) iustifieth no mā before God,
and that it is neither sufficient to
Pastour to preach and know Gods
word, except in practising it he go
before his flocke by good workes,
nor that it is sufficient to the people
or sheepe, who would bee accounted
of Christs sheep-folde, to
heare or know Gods voyce, except

they also follow and practise
the same by good workes, following
the holy and vnspotted
life of Iesus Christ the Lambe,
in whom they hope to bee saued.
Let therefore Pastor and people,
old and yong, from the highest to
the lowest; striue by a holy life,
and fruitfull, of good workes, to
shew themselues to bee true branches
in Iesus Christ the vine, and
liuely members of his blessed body,
and as he who hath called vs is holy,
so let vs be holy, in all manner of conuersation,
as becommeth the Gospel of Christ,
               1. Pet. 1. 15.
               zealous of good workes:
               Phil. 1. 27. Not hearing
or knowing our Masters will onely,
but in taking heed to our wayes,
to redresse the same according to
his word, and will reuealed therein,
executing and doing the same,
and when we haue done all that we
can doe, confessing and acknowledging
our selues to be vnprofitable
seruants, so shall we be assured
in our owne consciences, by Gods
spirit, that we are sheepe of his pasture,

and children of his inheritance,
so shall wee bee knowne by
the world, by our confession and
profession of Christ in an holy and
christian life, to be members of his
Church and Kingdome also, and
so at last, we shall be found worthy
in Christ, to walk with the Lambe,
when he, who gaue his life for vs
here, shall giue vs eternall life with
himselfe for euer hereafter.
            
               According to thy word, that is, making
thy holy word, O Lord, the
rule and square, according vnto the
which, we may take heed vnto our
wayes, and redresse the same. We
see then here, first, the excellencie
and great vertue and vse of the
word of God; It is a rule, according
vnto the which, wee may and
should redresse, purge and rectifie
our sinfull, vncleane and erronious
wayes: It is that breath of God,
which breatheth life in the face of
the soule of man, as by the word of
God in the first creation, was man
raysed out of the earth and placed

in the garden of Paradise, so by this
word of God, (which is neere vs in
our mouth and heart) is the new
creation and regeneration of the
heart of man, whereby his soule is
raysed from earthly and carnall affections,
and placed in the pleasant
garden of Christs church, to eate
of the tree of life, and liue with him
for euer. It is the voyce of God,
that is dayly heard in the garden
of his Church, not onely asking euery
Adamite and sinner, but shewing
him also, where and in what estate
he is by sinne and Sathan, calling
him not to a curse for sinne,
but a blessing, and inuiting him to
come to the seed of the woman,
to that tree of life, and second Adam,
Father and Sauiour of our spirits.
Gods word is a Lampe, that
shineth euer in the candlesticke of
his true Church, to direct our footsteps
in the path to life euerlasting,
with himselfe. It is that two-edged
Sword, that powerfully proceedeth
out of his owne mouth, which

pierceth thorow the inward cogitations
of the heart, to redresse the
same, and diuideth the marrow of
the bones, to giue fatnesse to the
soule. It is that seed, which beeing
sowed and layd vp in a good and
honest heart, maketh euery Christian
to bring foorth acceptable
fruit vnto Gods glory, and their
owne soules comfort. It is the
Power of God to saluation, to all
them who beleeue the same. It is
that Instrument or Spade, which
diggeth about the rootes of our
hearts, to make vs sweet and fruitfull
to our long suffering and patient
Master, lest we should be pulled
vp by the rootes, ere the axe of
Gods wrath should bee put to our
rootes, and wee be cut downe and
throwen ouer the hedge of the
vineyard into vnquenchable fire.
Gods word is that Snedding knife,
which cutteth away the rancke
leaues of sinne, which with their
darkenesse doe ouer-shadow our
soules, and keepe away that comfortable

ripening sunne of Gods
fauour, to shine vpon vs; that our
sowre grapes may become sweet.
It is a Hammer, to beat downe euery
high exalted hill,Iere. 23. 29. or proud
cogitation of the heart, that as Gyants
would rebell and fight against
God: It exalteth euer the low valley,
or humbled dejected soule, euen
to the throne of God in confidence
&amp; boldnesse. It is that s
                  ••
               ngstone
of the sonne of Dauid, whereby
euerie Christian and souldier of
Israel must kill that mighty Gyant,
the reuiler of God, and enemie of
his seruants, who seeketh not to
giue their bodies to the fowles of
the ayre, but their precious soules
to the hell-crowes of sinne, and
the deuouring vultures of eternall
torments. It is the knife whereby
the fore-skin of euery Christians
heart is circumcised and cut away,
before hee can be in the new couenant
of grace, or be counted a true
Israelite in spirit: it is the gladdest
tidings that euer came to the soule,

and the true testimony or witnesse-bearer
of Iesus Christ; search the
Scriptures, for they testifie of him:
it is a Christians life; My words are
life (saith light and life) and without
the comfort of the same, our
life is death, and our light Cimerian
darknesse. Gods word is a looking-glasse,
wherein we may see all
our spots, from the greatest to the
least, where they are, and how they
may bee wiped away, with the
blood of Iesus Christ, and teares
of true repentance. It is the sweet
Manna and foode of our soules;
Milke to the weaker; and stronger
meat for those who are more confirmed.
A Directer in prosperity;
an vpholder in aduersitie; and aboundant
comfort in both. It is a
Fire,Ier. 23. 2
                     •
                  . to purge our wayes, to burne
vp the earthly, or rather hellish
drosse of sinne and stubble of iniquitie,
&amp; to refine vs as pure gold,
to bee vessells of honour in Gods
house, before our heauenly Father.
It is that Raine or Dew that descended

from Heauen, and neuer
returneth vndone that, for which it
was sent; it fructifieth eyther the
heart, to bring forth pleasant fruit,
and softneth it to repentance; or as
water cast vpon Iron or Steele, hardeneth
the same; so it indureth the
obstinate and reprobate hearts of
them, who are inflamed and burned
in their owne sinfull lusts. Our
soules and hearts are made sauoury
Sacrifices, with all that proceedeth
therefrom, to present before the
nosthrills of God our heauenly Father,
by this preseruing Salt of his
word, whereby no stincking corruption
of the flesh and of sinne,
taketh hold vpon vs; but thereby
we are made sauourie meat, to bee
presented and accepted before our
heauenly Father, such as he euer loueth.
It is that Water of life, wherof,
whosoeuer drinketh, in his belly
shall spring riuers thereof aboundantly.
It is a Cloud, to refresh vs
in our iourney in the day, &amp; a firie
Pillar in the night time, to direct

our wayes by the light thereof, in
the darke desart of this world, and
to consume all our enemies, to thē
it shall bee darkenesse, but light to
the hoste of Israel: it shall bee hid,
and is so onely, to them that perish.
It is that bright Light, that shall
euer shine in the little G
                     •
                  shan of
Gods Church, when all the Egypt
beside of this world, with the Pharao
thereof shall be ouerwhelmed
with thicke darkenesse. It is the
Rudder of our Ship, which must
direct vs aright thorow the raging
beating waues of worldly persecutions;
and our Compasse, to keepe
our course by, vntill wee come to
the hauen of heauen, and port of
that new Ierusalem. It is that Rod,
which must diuide the redde sea of
temptations, thorow which narrowly
we must passe, to the spirituall
land of Canaan, when in them
we shall see the worldlings &amp; wicked
ouerwhelmed, and altogether
drowned. It is the Arke and couenāt
of God, at which we only must

aske counsell, and it must diuide
the Iorden of death to vs, making
a way, whereby wee must follow
our Ioshua Iesus, to the land of rest,
and our promised inheritance. It is
true Riches, and seuen times more
pure then the refined gold of Ophir;
It cannot corrupt, for heauen and
earth shall perish, before one iotte
of Gods worde perish. It is the
Keyes of the kingdome of Heauen,
whereby the gates thereof are
opened to euery penitent and beleeuing
soule, and shut to euery obstinate
and indured wicked heart.
It is the Sauour of life, vnto all
those that are appointed for life,
and hath the life of Iesus Christ to
righteousnesse in them. It is the
chiefe Shepheards Hooke, that
pulleth backe our straying soules
in the by-wayes of iniquitie, and
bringeth vs in the right way again,
subjecting vs to the obedience and
light yoake of Iesus Christ, in the
sheepefold of his Church. By it
wee are fished and drawne out of

the salt and stincking sea of this
world, to Iesus Christ. It is the
Sword, wherewith wee must fight
valiantly the Lordes battels: A
Trumpet, to encourage vs thereto,
at whose sound, the walls of euery
proud Iericho shall fall, and
which subdueth powers and scepters
to it selfe. It is our Pilgrims
staffe, which must vphold and defend
vs in our iourney. It is a most
bright Starre, which leadeth not
onely wise men, but fooles also to
Christ, where now he lyeth, not in
a kribbe, but sitteth on a Throne,
and happy are those starres or Ministers,
whom Christ holdeth in his
right hand, whose onely care is, by
preaching and practising this Star,
to shine before the flocke. And finally,
the Word of God is the
sound of that Trumpet, blowen by
the Angels of his Church, which
giueth vertue and power, quickening,
and resurrection, to euery
dead soule in sinne, to rise out of
the graue of securitie, &amp; put on a

sanctified bodie, that in bodie and
soule at the last resurrection of all
flesh to iudgement, they may passe
with Christ to eternall glory. It is
that Finger, which pointeth out
the Lambe of God, which taketh
away the sinnes of the world: and
as Andrew, brought Simon his brother;
&amp; Philip, Nathaniel; to Christ:
so the word of God bringeth and
leadeth vs by the hand, to him on
earth, and shall bring vs to eternal
glory with him in heauen for euer,
if we beleeue the same, and according
thereunto, take heede to redresse
our wayes.
            Secondly, seeing the excellencie
of Gods Word, is such of it
selfe, wee may learne what great
estimation and value it should bee
of, with euery Christian, as we see
the value thereof in it selfe, so our
estimation should bee corespondent,
wee should desire nothing so
much, esteeme nothing so much,
loue nothing so much, nor hunger
or thirst after nothing so much.

This estimation we may see in Dauid
to haue been great, and his loue

                  •
               eruent,Psal. 119. 14. 24. 40. 72. 93. 97. 103. he saith; I haue had as great
delight in the way of thy testimonies, as
in all riches. Also thy testimonies are my
delight and my counsellers. Behold, how I
desire thy command
                     •
                  ments. The law of
thy 
                     ••
                  uth is better to me, th
                     ••
                   thousands
of gold and siluer. I will neuer forget
thy precepts, for by them thou hast quickned
me. O how I loue thy law? it is my
meditatiō continually How sweet are thy
promises vnto my mouth? yea, more then
honie vnto my mouth. The Marchant
in the Gospell, when he had found
the Iewell in the field, he went and
sold all that he had, that hee might
buy that piece of ground, wherein
that Iewell was. Of all Iewels
that euer man could thinke vpon,
this of Gods word, is the most precious;
in it, is eternall light, euerlasting
life, continuall ioy, comfortable
contentment, &amp; infinite true
riches: Let vs therefore follow the
example of this wise Marchant, so
that we may haue it, and enioy the

comfort therein contayned, care
not what wee loose, if wee haue it,
we haue all things; if wee haue all
things, and want it, wee haue nothing.
It is not like other Iewels,
for cōmonly a man that possesseth
them not, can oftentimes know the
value of thē better then they who
possesse them, but with this Iewell
it is not so; the Marchant was neuer
in loue with it, vntill hee found
it; wee can neuer, nor will euer
know the estimation of it, vntil we
haue it in our hearts. Peter, when
Christ before his last Supper, came
to him to wash his feet, he refused;
no, Lord, thou shalt neuer wash my
feet: but whē Christ told him, that
otherwise, he shold haue no portion
with him, and had washed his
feet, then Peter, who refused before,
now beggeth, Lord, not onely my
feet, but my head and hands also:
so it is with vs, before wee taste of
the sweetnesse and refreshment of
Gods word, to our wearied soules,
and the ioy thereof to our wounded

and sorrowful consciences, we
esteeme of it, as Aesops Cocke did
of the Iewell, hee found in the
doung-hill, wee had rather haue a
grayne of Barley, or any thing that
testeth to the flesh, or is agreeable
to please our affections. Gods
word, is as it were pearles, cast before
swine, wee are rather ready to
turne backe, and teare them in pieces
that offered them vnto vs, then
to giue them any thanks: we refuse
then with Peter, the water of life,
but as soone as it hath touched our
hearts, and our soules haue found
the refreshing sweetnesse thereof,
then wee will begge and importunately
intreat, Lord, not onely this
measure, but a greater dayly of the
knowledge and comfort of thy
word, fill my whole soule with the
power thereof, and stuffe all the
corners of my heart, with the aboundance
of the same, let it not
onely be in my head, to talke of it,
but in my hands to doe it, and in
my feet also, in thy way to walke

according thereunto. This should
bee our desire and estimation of
Gods word: for if wee be sicke to
death (as it were) wee would esteeme
much of that Doctour, that
could tell and shew vs, what, and
from what cause our sicknes came,
and could giue vs a present remedy
to restore vs, to the perfect
health of our bodies, that wee
should liue long; but wee haue the
infectious and deadly sicknesse of
sinne, euery one of vs, in our soules.
Gods holy Word doth shew vs,
what our sicknesse is, and by what
way or meanes we came by it, it offereth
to vs present remedie, not
to restore the bodie to a kind of
health, that it may liue a miserable
momentaneall life, for a while, but
to restore the soule to perfect and
true health, that it may liue a blessed,
ioyfull, and eternall ioy in heauen,
with God and his blessed Angels,
how then should we esteeme
of this Physition &amp; Physicke? To
such a Physition of the body, wee

would thinke that we did owe our
life, who restored vs to the same: to
such a Physition of the soule then,
how much more do we owe this tē
               poral
miserable life for the defence
thereof? and how can we sufficiently
value or loue the same; we wold
account of him much, who would
giue vs such a right, whereby we
should possesse the whole kingdoms
of the earth peaceably, yea,
or to be heire to any one kingdom:
but so it is, that Gods word, if wee
beleeue the same, maketh vs heires
to the eternall Kingdome of Heauen,
and giueth vs sufficient right
and title, that wee shal bee peaceable
possessours thereof, in euerlasting
Ioy, and Glory infinite. In a
darke perilous way, wee esteeme
much of a Lanterne; such is Gods
word, to our wayes of this life: in
a dange
                  •
               ous long iourney, wee
would esteeme much of a faithfull
skilfull, vnburdenable and sufficient
guide, readie to ouercome and
encounter all perils or enemies of

ours; such is Gods word, in the
long, wearisome, and dangerous
iourney of this life, where, when
we meet with any temptatiō, if we
answere, It is written, and firmely
beleeue the same, in so resisting Sathan,
we shal ouercome his temptations,
and at last make him depart,
at least for a while, from vs, by the
strength of this our Guide. In a
great and doubtfull matter, knowing
our owne simplicitie and foolishnesse,
we would much esteeme
of a faithfull and wise counseller:
two wayes are set before our eyes,
one leading to death, another to
life, to the wrong we more naturally
encline, then to the other: therefore
in this great matter of life and
death eternall, and the doubtfulnesse
of these two waies, at one of
which enter wee must, wee haue
most great neede of this wise and
faithfull Counseller, whom wee
should much esteeme and follow
in all things. Moses sheweth Israel,
what the value of this worde of

God is, &amp; what value they should
esteeme it of, when hee saith, It is
your life and your wisedome, whereby
you excel all other Nations; therefore
hee exhorteth them, neuer to
let it depart out of their mouh nor
heart, but continually to talk of it,
going in, and comming out, at
home and in the fields, night and
day to meditate thereon, to make
it a signet vpō their finger, a frontlet
betweene their eyes, and to esteeme
nothing neere vnto it▪ nothing
equiualent to it, nor nothing
aboue it. Of the great estimation
of the word and trueth of God, we
haue one notable example in the
Scripture▪ of the good and godly
king Iosiah,
               2. King. 24. who, when the booke
of the Law of God, being found
by Hilkiah the Priest, and presented
to the King by Shaphan the Chanceller,
hee hauing heard the words
thereof, rent his clothes, and went
to the house of God, with all the
people of Iudah &amp; Ierusalem, small
and great, the Priests and Leuites,

and there, in audience of the whole
people, did reade the law himselfe
in their eares, shewing what estimation
and reuerence euery King
and people shold haue to the word
of God, we must heare and reade it
with great reuerence, as becommeth
the word of the King of all
kings, and Lord of all lords to bee
heard, with the hand of faith wee
must receyue it, and with all estimation,
wee must lay it vp in the
chest and coffer of our hearts, to
bring forth the fruit of obedience
thereunto, as becommeth good
subjects, naturall children, &amp; faithfull
seruants, in our life and conuersation.
It is the most precious
Iewell that a yong man can weare;
the greatest riches that he can possesse;
a chayne of gold about his
necke; true wisedome to his heart;
the faithfullest tutor to direct and
gouerne him; and the most delightfull
pleasure &amp; greatest profit that
euer he could wish; for godlines
is profitable vnto all things, and

hath a promise of this life, and of
the life to come. It is to the aged,
their greatest honour, their truest
wisedome and grauitie, when sicknesse
and age oppresseth them: it is
a comfortable salue to their soules,
and the best company they can
seeke to, or desire: it is the skilfulest
Doctor, that can best ease thē;
and it is the strong hand, that bringeth
them safe and sound thorow
all griefe, dolours, temptations,
sicknesses, and the passeouer of
death it selfe, vnto the kingdom of
God, &amp; the eternal ioyes of heauen.
Therefore let yong and old esteeme
of it greatly, and of the bearers
thereof highly, as of the ambassage
&amp; ambassadours of the Prince
of all Princes, and Lord eternall,
ouer all Lordes and Potentates in
this temporall and momentaneall
world, that receiuing it, and them,
with reuerent and dutifull estimation,
laying it vp in their hearts, &amp;
practising the same in their life and
conuersation, by redressing their

wais according therunto; they may
be crowned immortall and glorious
Kings in the world to come,
and raigne with Christ Iesus eternally,
world without end. For who
esteemeth of it, esteemeth of God,
(his worde and himselfe being all
one) as who contemneth it to heare
or doe the same, contemneth God
to heare or obey him: who receiueth
it and the Preachers thereof,
receiueth Christ, as himselfe testifieth:
and who reiecteth it or them,
reiecteth Iesus Christ, and the mercy,
benefites and loue of the Father
offered in him, willingly and wilfully
giuing ouer themselues to
darkenes, to the Prince of darknes,
and to the condemnation of, and
with, the Prince of darkenesse for
euer.
            Finally to conclude, seeing the
excellencie of Gods word is such,
and the estimation thereof and reuerence
in our hearts should bee
such, wee may perceiue the great
iniquity and fearefull offence of all

those who keepe the same secret,
and hide from Gods people, lest
they finding this iewel with the wise
merchant, should onely cleaue vnto
it, and hide it vp in their hearts
and soules: it is life, therefore they
from whom it is hid, walke in the
shadow of death: it is light, therefore
they to whom it shineth not,
walke in feareful darknesse: it is the
foode &amp; phisicke of the sicke soule
of a sinner onely, therefore they
who know it not, nor wil not know
it, must starue and die eternally: it
is our directer and counseller, to
whom then it is hid, they wander
astray in the paths of foolishnesse.
Except this seede be sowen, how
can we bring forth good fruit in a
true faith, to a ioyfull haruest? it is
the power of God to saluation to
all them who beleeue; and by faith
wee are made members of Iesus
Christ: but how can wee beleeue,
except wee heare, (for faith commeth
by hearing; and how can we
heare it except it bee preached.

Therefore, who taketh away diligent
preaching, they take away
carefull hearing, and who taketh
away hearing, they take away
the faith, in so farre as in them lieth,
and so sheweth themselues plainely
to bee enemies of Iesus Christ,
and of his crosse. By it, wee are digged
about the rootes, planted and
watered, and made fruitfull vines,
and sweete fig-trees in Gods garden
and vineyard; therefore, who
taketh away the same, maketh God
in his wrath to put to the axe to
the roote of the tree, to cut it down,
and cast it (being barren and vnfruitfull)
into eternall fire: being so
slow and backward, when wee are
often inuited to come to Gods
house &amp; banquet, how much slower
shall wee be without the hearing
of the inuitation of Gods worde?
Wee are too barren ground euen
when that raine and dew falleth
vpon our soules: but how much
barrenner shall wee be, and lesse
fructifie, when it doeth not fall?

Happy for euer is that Kingdome
or Citie, that retaineth the same in
the pure sinceritie thereof, without
addition, diminution, mixture, or
amission, as thrise woful is the same
that retaineth not the same so. The
most fearefull threatning wherewith
Christ Iesus, that Alpha and Omega,
threatneth any of the seauen
Churches, is that of the Church of
Ephesus: I will come against thee shortly,
and will remooue thy Candlesticke out of
               Reu. 2.
               his place, except thou amend. The most
fearefull famine that euer came vpon
any Land, Kingdome, Citie, or
soule, is the famine of the word of
God, when the staffe of the heauenly
bread thereof is broken. This
plague or the report thereof, may
make euery eare to tingle: for
where it is, it is neuer alone, but
with it, is the infectious plague of
the pestilence of sinne, suffocating
euery soule vnto death eternall, not
taking men out of worldly miserie
to eternall ioy, as the bodily plague
doth many: but from their temporall

ioy in sinne, vnto eternall miserie
of punishment. And euer with
it, or after also followeth the sharp
and seuere deuouring sworde of
Gods fierce wrath, and consuming
hoat displeasure. It is a fearefull
thing, when the watch or watchman
of Gods word in the head of
the Tower is dumbe, when there is
no barking about the sheepe, how
can the sheepe be safe. It is a wofull
thing to see godly Samuel remoued
from Saul, that he dares not speake
Gods word plainely, but must tarie
at home all his life, and mourne
onely for Saul and his doings, when
hee is compelled to answere God,
how can I goe? for if Saul heare, he
will kill me. It is wofull to see Ieroboam
the King, put out his hand
and bid, take holde of the Prophet
of God, because at the commandement
of the Lord, hee cried against
the Altar of Bethel. It is fearefull to
heare that the Lords true Prophets
must be hid in caues, and feede on
bread and water, being dumbe,

when Eliah knoweth none but himselfe
left alone, to plead Gods cause
boldly, and must bee faine to flee
from place to place, in great necessitie,
from the presence of Ahab and
his false Prophets, because he spake
Gods word truely, therefore hee
must bee called a troubler of Israel
and the estate. It is lamentable to
see, that Michaiah, for not speaking
of pleasant things, as the false Prophets
of Ahab did, shall bee beaten
by Zidkiiah, a false, deceiuing, and
flattering spirit, and sent to the prison
house by the King to eate and
drinke the bread and water of affliction:
to see bloody Iehoram send
for the head of Elisha in his wrath:
or Herod for the head of Iohn the
Baptist, for speaking the word of
God freely: because Vriiah prophecied
the trueth in the name of the
Lord, to be sent for by I
                     •
                  hoiakim the
King, and beheaded likewise: Ieremiah
for speaking of that, whereof
God commanded him not to keepe
a word backe, to bee apprehended

by the Priests and people, and to be
censured worthy to die the death:
to see Daniel cast in the Lions den:
and the three children in the fierie
furnace, for professing the seruice
of the Lord their God: is it not a
woful thing to see Iesus Christ persecuted
daily for proclaiming the
will of his Father, and that ioyfull
yeare of Iubile for the freedome of
mens soules? to see Steuen stoned to
death for the testimony of Iesus:
Peter and Iohn imprisoned, for the
preaching of the Gospel freely, and
with threatning, commanded that
they preach no more? to see the Apostles
beaten, and oftentimes incarcerated:
Paul stoned, smitten, apprehended,
bound? &amp;c. The beloued
Apostle of Iesus Christ exiled,
to an Ile Patmos, and Gods seruants
the bearers of this glorious iewell
of his word, by manifolde waies
to be troubled, onely for the testimonie
of the trueth and of a good
conscience, which the itching eares
of these last times cannot abide to

heare, albeit they shoulde most
desire the same: For where Gods word
is not preached, the people perisheth; as testifieth
the Preacher. And the chiefe
cause, that Gods word is so restrained
in many places, the mouths of
Gods seruants so shut vp, and the
veritie repressed and bound as it
were, is, Alexander the Coppersmiths
profite will cease, if Paul
preach; where Gods Arke commeth
in place, Dagon must fall: and
if Iesus Christ in such humilitie be
suffered to bee acknowledged the
Sauiour, the Hie Priests honour,
iurisdiction, and profit must cease:
if Daniel be suffered, hee will discouer
the Priests knaueries; and Elias
will shew that Baal is no God, nor
heareth not: when Moses commeth
with the Tables of the Law from
the mount, the golden calfe must
downe: if when Michaiah commeth
to speake the truth freely, he beleeued:
Zidkiiah &amp; the falsflattering Prophets,
with their hornes of yron,
should be put out of credit, fauour,

and authoritie: if Iohn the Baptist
should be obeyed, then Herod must
put away his Herodias. And where
Gods sincere and pure word only
getteh place and libertie, downe
must goe idolatrie, and not a relict
or hoofe thereof remaine: tyrannicall
authoritie of these, who with
Diotrephes, loueth the preheminence,
and to rule as lords ouer the Lords
inheritance, must bee trod downe
vnder the humble feete of Iesus
Christ, and of his word; who pratleth
against Gods true seruants
with malitious words; &amp; not therewith
content, neither they themselues
receiue the brethren, but forbiddeth
them that would, and thusteth
them out of the Church. The
triple crowne must yeelde to the
crown of thornes, &amp; al popish, ethnish,
&amp; apish ceremonies, must fall
downe before this Arke of Gods
pure worde: where the worde of
Christ, who came to serue, getteth
right place, gracious Lord, must
cease; Caeser must haue that which

belongeth to him: and all pastours
with Paul, must graunt themselues
to bee seruants onely to Christs
flocke for his cause: their right title
is the most honorable that they can
haue, euen the title which Iesus Christ
is called by; to bee Sheepheards of
soules: where Gods word shineth,
their shining before the flock must
not be in gold &amp; silkes, but in good
workes: where Gods word ruleth,
their rule and gouernement must
be onely by Gods word; their scepter,
that scepter which subiects
scepters to it selfe; their crowne,
their flocke: you are my crowne, saith
Paul: their sword, not temporal, nor
Caesars, but that two-edged sword
that is in Christs mouth, Gods; and
all their authority from Christs
commission onely, As my Father sent
me; so I send you: where Gods sacred
Law commeth, there they must not
worship the golden calfe of profit
onely: neither can Alexanders Diana
bee so fat vnto him, but with Moses
they must looke onely for the reward

of God: Christs kingdome is
not of this worlde, in it then they
must not looke for any recompēce:
Paul saith, I haue fought a good fight, &amp;c.
from henceforth is laid vp for me a crowne,
&amp;c. there is the reward hee looked
for. I goe (saith Christ) to my Father to
prepare a place for you: this is Christs
promise; For in the world you shall haue
affliction: and if you were of the world,
the world should loue you, but because you
are not, as I am not, therefore it hateth you.
In it then, nor of it, Pastours must
not thinke their reward to bee: and
if in the world, &amp; of the same, they
haue here their reward, it is to bee
feard that they shal neuer haue any
other; but as the world loueth thē, &amp;
they the world again, that their cō
               demnation
is like to bee with the
world also. Therfore, where Christs
word taketh place, worldly profite
and full bagges must depart: and
albeit the Minister must liue of the
Altar, to supply necessitie, yet
Christ, for Christ, and his glorie
onely, must bee preached, pride in

the hie Priests; and auarice in Iudas,
was the first betraier of Christ:
pride and auarice now is, and euer
shall be, the only betraier of Christ
and his cause, and they know little
the power of Christ in their heart
or soule, as they preach his name
with their mouth, who with Zebedeus
sonnes here, seeketh onely for
their prefermēt, because they haue
followed him: but they who truely
follow him, must denie here, se suos,
&amp; sua, take vp their crosse and follow
him. The same is his answere
to all Ministers, as it was to Peter,
who when hee asked what they
should haue, because they followed
him: he answered, that they should
sit on twelue seates with him, and
iudge the twelue Tribes of Israel: so
he saith to euery Minister, that followeth
him truely as they did, not
that hee shall be so or so powerfull
in the world, for hee hath chosen
the weake ones of the world; but
that hee shall sit at his right hand
with him in his kingdome, when he

shall iudge all the Tribes and Nations
of the world: they then who
pertaine vnto that kingdome, will
desire that great reward &amp; honour,
only more then all the honour and
kingdoms of the world, with their
glory, esteeming all as dung to win
Christ, &amp; many soules vnto Christ,
to know the power of his death &amp;
resurrection in themselues, and see
it in their flockes. But who pertain
not to this kingdome, they wil preferre
their owne profite before all
things: &amp; if the preaching of Gods
word hinder or take away their
profit, with Alexander; that Diana
goe not downe, they will stirre vp
kings, kingdoms, cities, rulers and
people, against Paul and his preaching;
and if thirtie pennies may be
had, Christ Iesus shall be betrayed
with a kisse: If this light and fire of
Gods word should come in place,
it would consume, like Moses rod or
serpent, the serpentine and profitable
fire of purgatorie: If it
were preached plainely vnto Gods

people, and to the soules of men,
that we must come onely to Christ,
who call
                  •
               th and commandeth vs;
aske of the Father, who can denie
vs nothing through him, according
to his will; and that the King, against
whom wee commit the offence,
onely can forgiue the same.
Where should the golden pardons
of the Pope goe, or the profit of the
confessors, if it bee preached, that
Christ the Master, had not a hole
to repose his head in, nor so much
mony as could pay tribute for him
and 
                  •
               or Peter? And if it be reported
how Peter, Acts. 3. said, Siluer or golde
haue I none; where shall the princely
pallaces of the seruants goe, &amp; the
great treasured heapes of golde
they lay vp? Paul soiourned in a
poore Tanners house that dressed
leather, and when hee sent for his
cloake and his scrolles, he maketh
no mention of any great treasure;
but hee laid vp his treasure in heauen,
where the moath, the canker,
nor the theefe coulde not come,

gaining and treasuring by his Talent,
many soules to God. Peter got
a great treasure, and conquesed
much, when at his Sermon so many
soules were conuerted to Christ, &amp;
ioyned to the Church. But these fat
woolues, and dumbe dogges, they
care not for such a treasure or conquest;
woe be to them, for they doe
not the worke of the Lorde at all,
let it be negligently, woe be to thē,
for they preach not the Gospell,
they feede themselues and not the
flocke. It is sufficient for them to
haue a Lambes skinne, the name of
a christian, although they neuer
felt the power of Christ to bee called
Bishop, or Pastour, albeit they
neuer ouer-see, nor can ouer-see,
not their flocke, but the flockes,
the sheepe neuer heard nor knew
their pastoral voice, but their thundering
tyrannical iurisdiction; they
call not, nor can they call their
owne sheep by name, because they
haue not any particular flock, they
leade them not out to pasture, neither

can their sheep follow thē, because
they goe not before, except
it be by wicked example, and giuing
offence, they come not in at
the doore, by Christ and his ordinarie
lawfull calling, but climbes
vp another way, by man
                  •
               pleasing,
briberie, simonie, honors, to theeue,
and to rob, kil and destroy, like that
wicked steward, drinking, eating,
and glutting thēselues with worldly
honours and riches, and with the
blood of the sheepe, but beating
out of Christs sheepfold and house,
their painefull fellow seruants, that
seeketh the life and feeding of the
sheepe onely: they will neither enter
themselues, nor suffer others to
enter; they will neither come nor
bring to Christ, neither will they
suffer others: many soules perish in
their default; and great shal be their
condemnation who doe so, in the
worlde to come; they haue the
sheep-hooke in their hand, but neuer
applies it to bring them into
Christs sheepfold; they haue the

forme of clouen tongues vpon
their heads, but not the clouen
tongue of Gods Spirit in their
heads or hearts, to diuide the word
aright, &amp; distribute the same vnto
Gods people.
            The world with the riches &amp; glory
thereof, which Sathan offered
to Christ, is sufficient to make
them fall downe and worship him,
the world &amp; the kingdome thereof,
soundeth sweetly in their eares,
because they are in loue one with
another, and their condemnation
is all one; but the word of God, It
is written, &amp; the voyce of the kingdome
of heauen, is as displeasant
vnto them, as the same It is written,
was to Sathan: Sell all and follow
me, was a hard saying to the rich
yonug man: they beeing of the
world, to bee selected from the
world, is as bitter a saying to them,
yea, more bitter to the worldly, thē
that potion, which the world gaue
to Christ on the Crosse, vineger
and gall mixed together. Flint

from flint may be sooner pulled asunder,
&amp; the hardest Adamant or
Diamond diuided, then to diuide
and diuorce them from their sweet
Dalilah the world, and to doe that,
Gods word shall neuer get place
by them. These are the causes, that
that bright Candle is put vnder a
bushell by them; that that glorious
Citie is placed in a low valley; that
that precious 
                  •
               ewell is hid vnder
the earth, lest it be found, and had
onely in estimation, to be hid in
mens hearts: for if so bee that the
stronger man enter, the vsurper
shall be bound, &amp; cast out straight;
if light come, darkenesse shal depart,
as the morning cloudes are
driuen before the Sun: set vp Gods
Kingdome and Lawes, and put
downe their kingdome and lawes:
God and Belial cannot be together:
the aduancement of the Throne of
Iesus Christ the Lambe, is the detruding
of these goates out of their
throne; the divulgating of his
word, is the falsifying of theirs;

therefore they striue to prolong
the night, as long as they may, that
the bright day-starre arise not, that
Light that shineth in darkenesse, to
discouer them and their workes.
The cause also, why many men,
chiefly yong men esteeme not, nor
take such delight in Gods word, as
they should; and care not much,
albeit it were hid, that they neuer
heard it much, is, because mans nature
chiefly in youth, affecteth libertie
of the flesh, which, it (being
the word of the Spirit) fighteth against,
and restraineth. It is the limits
of that narrow way, which
leadeth to life, and therefore will
not suffer libertie, to wander astray
in the wide &amp; wilde fields of sinne
to death: it is the knife that openeth
the soare, and will haue strictnesse
first, that ease may follow after:
when we sinne, neuer so little,
it will, like a good master, checke
vs, like a louing father, reproue vs,
and like a wise counseller, admonish
vs, which checking, reproofe

or admonishing, yea, for great offences,
youth can scarse abide. Iesus
Christ commanded the young
man in the Gospell, that he should
leaue all, and follow him, if hee
would haue eternall life; Iesus
Christ now, commandeth also in
his word, all yong men, that they
leaue all their pleasures, lustes of
youth, and vanities, and follow his
strict and holy life, if they would
haue eternall life, Knowing, that all
tbat are baptized into Iesus Christ,
               Rom. 6. 3. 4▪
                
               are
baptized in his death: and like as hee was
raysed vp from the dead, by the glory of
the Father, so wee also should walke in
newnesse of life. His word commandeth
vs to flie from the luste:
               2. Tim 2. 22. 
               of youth,
and follow after righteousnesse, faith, loue
and peace,
               1. Pet. 5. 5. 
               the yonger to submit themselues
vnto their elders, and euery one to another,
to decke themselues inwardly with lowlinesse
of minde, without fornication, adulterie,
drunkennes, whoredome, &amp;c. knowing▪
that they who doe so,Eph. 5. 3 4. 1. Thess. 4. 7. shall neuer
inherite the kingdome of heauen:
Eschewing all filthinesse, (for God

hath not called vs vnto vncleannesse, but
vnto holinesse) all foolish talking, neither
mocking or ieasting, which are things vncomely,
and giuing no place vnto the diuel,
putting away all bitternesse and anger,
with euill speaking, and all maliciousnesse,
being courteous one to another, and
tender hearted, forgiuing one another, as
God for Christs sake forgaue vs, and iu
all things being followers of God, as deare
children, glorifying him in body and in
spirit, for they are Gods. Which commandements
of Gods word, are
hard and vnpleasant vnto youth,
except it be seconded with grace.
Therefore all young men should
desire this assisting and renewing
grace of God.Eph. 5. 16. 
               Redeeming the time, for
the dayes are euill. And that considering
the season,
               Rom. 13. 11. 
               that it is now time, that
we should arise frrom sleepe for now is our
saluation neerer, then we beleeued it; the
night is past, and the day is at hand; let
vs therefore cast away the workes of darkesnesse▪
and let vs put on the armour of
light. So that we walke honestly, as in the
day: not in gluttony and drunkennesse

neither in chambering and wantonnesse,
nor in strife and eni
                     •
                  ying:
               1. Thes. 4: 7. 
               but put on the
Lord Iesus Christ, and take no thought for
the flesh, to fulfill the lust, of it: and 
                     〈…〉
                  ,
               2. Tim. 3. 21.
               as he who despiseth these things, despiseth
not man but God: So, if any man
purge himselfe from thes
                     ••
                   hee shall bee a
vessell vnto honour, sanctified &amp; meete
for the Lord, &amp; prepared vnto
euery good worke.
            
            Amen.
