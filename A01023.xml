            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

            A LETTER
SENT FROM SARIENT
MAIOR FORBES FROM THE KING
of Swethens army to his reverend father Mr. Iohn
Forbes, miniſter to the worſhipful Company of
Marchant Adventurers reſiding in Delft, touching
the great Battle fought by Lypſick betweene the
King of Swethen, the Duke of Saxons Army, and
the Emperours Army, and that commanded by Generall
Tilly, of the Catholique League the 7. of September,
1631.
            
            
               HOnored, and Loving father upon the
fourth of this month of September, it pleaſed God
that the Kings Army, &amp; the Duke of Saxons joyned
together, neere unto a Towne called Dieben
and marched forward towards Lypſick, which
Generall Tilly, had taken in, and laye with his Army
about halfe a mile from it, where he mett us,
with his army, and tooke up the beſt advantage of ground for his
men, and planted his ordinance upon the places, which he thought
fitteſt. The Kings Armie marched on the right hand of the Battle, and
the Dukes on the left, and ſo advanced in Battleray againſt out Ennemy,
who begann to playe d
                  •
               ſpitfully with his Ordinance upon us,
which wee cared not much for, but advanced forward with our ordidinance
likewiſe playing before us. They ſeing us marching towards

               
               
                  〈1 page duplicate〉
               
               
them, they advanced likewiſe towards us, and came ſo cloſe one to
an other, that joyning battalions together, wee came to puſhe of the
pike, and diſputed the buyſineſſe ſo longe, till it pleaſed God, that
wee routed them, and gaue us the victorie, by putting the Ennemy
to a retreate with the Kings owne Army, but the Dukes Army was
vily beaten back, and begann to make a ſhameful flight, ſo that wee
were forced to ſend our horſe men after theſe that were beaten, and
to relieve the Dukes men with our foote, which doing, wee putt all
the Ennemy at laſt to flight, and followed the execution very hotely
till it was darke night, &amp; till wee could not ſee to perſue them any
further, for which victorie immortal thankes be given to God. The
Ennemy was at leaſt 40000. allfighting men, and our Army, and
the Dukes cold make not aboue 36000 men horſe and foote. The
next day there was found dead on both ſides ſlayne upon the place
of battle 10000 bodies, whereof the moſt of them were the Ennemies,
beſides theſe that were ſlayne upon their flight &amp; execution
which were connted to be as great a number. There were taken in all
about 8000. priſonners, the moſt of them having taken entertaynment
of the King, and marches with our Army. There were diverſe
Collonells of note ſlayne, on both ſides. Generall Tilly was ſhott and
hurt three times, the Lord Marſhall Schoonburck ſlayne, and fiue other
Collonells. The Duke of Holſteyne taken priſonner, who afterward
dyed of his wounds, beſides divers other Lieutenants, Collonels,
Captaynes, and Officers, which would be too long to relate, of
our ſide there were ſlayne Collonell Divel, Collonele Hall, Colonele
Cullenburck, and Lieutenant Colonele Adercus. Colonele Turnill
hurt, and my Colonele hurt, beſides diverſe Captaynes, Lieutenants,
&amp; Enſignes: Wee haue taken two and twentie peeces of Canon,
whereof there are ſevē which were the King of Bohemias, loſt at
the Battle of Prage. Beſides great ſtore of powder, Bullets, match, and
munition of warre, 52 Coullours of foote, and 37. Cornetts of horſe
this is the truth of the great victorie wch God hath given us wch you
maye report for a certaine, for I write noe more unto you but that wch
I ſaw with my owne eyes. I wold haue writtē to diverſe others, but

I praye yow lett this letter ſuffice for all, and when any other occaſion
ſhall offer yt ſelfe, yow ſhall heare further from mee. Noe more at this
time, but my dutie remembred to your felfe my mother, and my
loue to my bretheren and ſiſters, and al other my freinds. I commit
you to the protection of him that hath given us this glorious victorie
and reſt.
            
               Your Loving Sonne. I. F.
               From the Kings Army at Hall the tenth of September 1631.
               
            
            
               The reſt of the Kings proceeding in the Countries and Towns
which he hath taken in ſince that battle as they followe in time.
            
         
         
            
               I take it this generation doe live in that age this prophecy
ſhal be fulfilled Revelation, 18: 20.
               
            
            O heavens rejoyce of hir, and ye holy Apoſtles and Prophets, for
God hath given your judgment on hir for your ſakes.
            Here the Holy-ghoſt doth deſcribe the joy and rejoycing of all the
faithfull for the deſtruction of the Romiſh ſuperſtition, and hunane
inventions.
            By heaven here is meant, the faithfull Profeſſours of the truth, becauſe
they belong to heaven, and have their meditations in heaven. By
Apoſtels and Prophets are not meant thoſe famous preachers which
lived in former ages, but are to be taken for thoſe faithfull teachers
which witnes Gods truth on earth in his millitant Church.
            As for our matters on earth they belong not to thoſe bleſſed ſoules
which are and have been reſting ſo long bleſſedly in heaven, for dead
men (ſaith the Scripture) know nothing anie more here Eccleſ. 9:5.
and therfore ſaith the Prophet, that Abraham is ignorant of us, and
that Iſrael knows us not Iſay. 63:16. Therefore this is the rejoycing
of all Gods people at the aboliſhing of all humane inventions in Gods
Worſhip, and they rejoyce at the advancing of all the inſtitutions of
Chriſt, that he may raigne as King in his church by his own laws and
ordinaunces as the Apoſtle teſtifyeth 1. Timo. 3:14. 15. and this he is
commanded to obſerve till the appearing of Ieſus Chriſt to judgment
the 6:14. therefore not in the liberty of earthly potentates to alter,
for Chriſt ſhall raign, Amen
