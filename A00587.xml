            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

the hearst

                     VVee haue lost a most pretious
iewell out of the Church.
But since your happy departure
from the Romish Synagogue,
and repairing to our
true reformed Church, wee
may say on the contrary, in
regard of you, We haue gained
a most pretious Iewell to the
Church. Such lowlinesse of
minde in such height of fortunes:
such Deuotion in such
distractions; such constancy
in such temptations, wee
blesse God for, in you; wee
pray God for, in others of your
Sexe and ranke. If to touch
vpon your modesty were not
to wound it, and to relate
your continuall practise of
Deuotion were not to interrupt
it, I should speake much
of it, yet no more then they
know to bee most true, who

are neerest to you, when you
draw neere to your Father in
secret. But because it is not
the least of your praises, that
you cannot endure praise,Fascinant laudando.
and there are many in England
(not onely in Africa)
who are bewitched by flattery;
I will drawe a veile before
those eminent parts which
my pensill cannot expresse.
And therfore ceasing farther
to blazon your vertues, I
humblie craue leaue of you
to preferre vnto you a seruant
to attend you in your closet;
I meane THE HAND-MAID
TO PRIVATE
DEVOTION; who vpon
her knee, tenders to your
Grace some helpes to your
Deuotion, together with the
Deuotion and prayers of the
Author to God for you, to

crowne you with the blessings
of this life, and the
blessednesse of the life to
come.
                  
                     Your Graces humbly
deuoted,

                  THE
PREFACE
to the Reader.
                  
                     CHRISTIAN READER,
                  
                  
                     IN the late dreadfull
Visitation,
when the waies
of Sion mourned,
because
none passed by
them; and the gates of the Sanctuary
lamented, because almost
none entred at them; Religion her
selfe for the most, forbearing the
Church, and keeping her closet, and
there finding sufficient employment
to complaine of, &amp; bewaile the danger
and desolation of her solemnest
assemblies: I fell into a serious consideration
of the vse and most vrgent
necessity of PRIVATE DEVOTION.
And to the end I might

accord with my brethren in their
groanes and cries, being smitten
my selfe with a dangerous (though
not infectious) disease; I gaue ouer
those waters of strife wherein I
had met with the Romish Fisher,
intangled in his owne Net; and
sought after the waters of Shiloah
that runne softly, which at that
season farre better relished with me
then the other. Not that I altered
my iudgement touching the studie
of controuersies, which (without all
controuersie) is not onely most needefull,
but delightfull also to them
that are therein exercised.
                  It is an easie taske, and almost euery
ones labour now a dayes to gather
flowers of Paradice, and make
Posies, or Garlands of them for
Christ's Spouse. But it is not for
euery hand to meddle with those
thornie difficulties, which yet must be
carefully handled by them who will
make a strong hedge or sure fence
for the Lord's Vineyard. The more
perplexed, and intricate the difficulty

is, the greater is the contentment in
beating out the truth in points of no
lesse consequence then difference.
Children are not so much delighted
with smiting flints one against the
other to see the sparcles, as mē of rational
vnderstāding &amp; discourse, by
collision of contrary arguments, to
strike out the fire of diuine Truth.
And this fire as well as that other
which the naturall heate of Deuotion
kindleth, yeeldeth much warmth
to the conscience euen of a dying
man. Witnesse Oecolampadius,
whose last words were these: Now
I goe cheerefully to the tribunall
of Christ, where it shall appeare,
that I haue not seduced God's
people, but haue sincerely taught
the truth of God. I might instance
likewise in Doctor Whitaker's
Cygnea Cantio, his swanlike
song before his death, wherein hee
warble
                        •
                     h sweetely vpon those at this
day most Vexed questions of vniuersall
grace and freewill. And his
contemporary, the eye of the other

Vniuersity, Doctor Reynolds, when
hee lay on his death bed, called for
Doctor Abbots (after the Lord
Bishop of Salisbury) Reply to W.
Bishop, then newly come forth, and
heard much of it read vnto him
with great contentment.
                  But being (as I said euen now)
out of tune in my body, I listed not,
nor in that shaking weakenes could
hold fast the peggs to streine and
tune the iarring strings of c
                        •
                     ntrouersed
opinions in point of Religion.
That which I then most desired, was
to settle my thoughts and affections,
and compose my soule to rest by listening
to the sweete songs of Sion,
set to Dauids well-tuned harpe, and
runs vpon in exquisite diuision by
some of our excellent Asaphs in their
pious Treatises, Soliloquies, Prayers,
Meditations, and Contemplations.
This heauenly musick so ranished
my senses, that I found by experience
in the twylight, betwixt
the day of life, and night of death,
that inlightened thoughts affoord

nothing like comfort to en flamed affections.
Now the oyle which feedeth
this sacred flame (next to the inspired
holy Scriptures) floweth most
abundantly in Treatises of Deuotion.
In which kinde of writings, the
Romanists for the most part exceede
in bulke, but our Diuines in weight.
The Church of Rome (like Leah)
is more fruitfull; but her Deuotions
(like Leah in this also) are blea
                           •
                        eeyed
with superstitiō. But the mother
of our faith (like Rachel) is not
altogether so fruitful, yet she is more
comely, and beautiful, and I hope wil
be also here after as fruitful. Verily
if euer Priuate Deuotions powring
thēselus forth in brinish teares,
were in season, now they are. Neuer
losses so great to be bewailed; neuer
iudgements so fearefull to bee auerted;
neuer hearts so hard to be mollified;
neuer consciences so fowle to
be rinsed by teares as now. Nature
hath prouided a soueraigne remedy
against the sting of the Scorpion
in the oyle of the Scorpion. When

thou feelest the sting, it is but bruising
the Serpent, and rubbing it on
the place, and the moisture presently
of the Serpent killed, destroyeth
the venome of that Serpent. I would
to God our soules were as deare to
vs as our bodies, and that we tooke
as much care for remedies against
sinne, as salues against enuenomed
wounds. Then would we, as soone
as we feele the sting of sinne in our
consciences, bruise the Serpent by
true contrition; destroy the sinne,
and apply the oyle of teares issuing
from it, to cure the wound before it
festered. But among other iust causes
of teares, this is not the least that
wee misspend our teares, and spill
that heauenly dew, and profane the
Font-water of our second baptisme
(as Saint Cyprian calleth it.) Wee
haue teares at our owne will in
worldly losses; but none at God's
command for the losse of his grace.
Wee take on for the death of our
friends departing frō vs; but cannot
wring out a teare for the spirituall

death of our soules departing from
God. Yet all our fretting and vexing,
all our weeping and howling
cannot fetch our friend backe againe,
or repaire our worldly losses:
whereas on the contrary (as Saint
Chrysostome piously noteth) the
afflicting of our soules, and serious
bewailing of our sinnes, by
God's grace, shall reuiue our
soules, and recouer all our spirituall
losses, and that with aduantage.
What pittie, nay what folly
is it, to powre costly eye-water out
of a Venice-glasse into a vile pot or
basen to wash our feete withall? Do
we not the like, when we turne godly
sorrow into worldly, and abuse
pretious teares to the bewailing of
vile &amp; base losses? haue we suchstore
of them? or such want of better employmēt
for them? See we not wrath
is gone out against vs, and the fire
long agoe kindled, and not yet quenched
by our teares? Lord, thou
hast shewed thy people terrible
things; thou hast giuen vs a

drinke of deadly wine, and hast
caused vs to suck out the dreggs
of it, because we (Moab like) are
setled vpon our Lees. As Pharaoh
saw the hugh of his bloodie
minde in the waters of Aegypt
turned all redd as blood: so
we may see the crimson colour of
our sins in the vialls of thy wrath
powred of late vpon vs. We trade
not spiritually for the pearle of
the Gospell, and therefore our
Merchant's returnes faile. Wee
would not weepe for our sins, and
therefore the heauens did weepe
for vs a long season in continuall
showers. We haue bin hard hearted,
and barren in good works,
and therefore thou madest heretofore
the heauen aboue vs as
brasse, and the earth vnder vs
as Yron. By drunkennesse and
gluttony, by euill perswasions
and worse examples, one soule
hath infected another; and therefore
thou hast sent a Plague
whereby one body infecteth another.

Such a Plag
                           •
                        
                        ▪ as our ancients
neuer heard of, and our posterity
will scarce belieue. The
chiefe of our Cities haue beene
ploughed vp, and sowed so thick
with dead corps's that one could
scarce lye by another. Against this
and all other iudgements which
thy law threatneth, and our sins
prouoke, wee haue no weapons to
contend with thy iustice but prayers
and teares. We haue no meanes
to clense the infected aire but our
sighs and groanes. O Lord remoue
our sins as a clowde, and
iniquities as a mist, and then
this dreadfull bloodie clowde
which lately powred downe, but
now onely droppeth, will vanish of
it selfe. Consummate the worke
of mercy thou hast begun, and
quite remoue this iudgement
through thy tender compassion in
the bowells of Christ Iesus, wee
beseech thee. But remoue this
iudgement in mercie, not in iudgement.
Take not thy hand off of vs

to fetch a greater stroake at vs.
Deliuer vs not from one Plague
as thou diddest Pharoh, to send
a worse in steede thereof. Put vs
not out of thine hands into
which we are fallen, to giue vs
ouer into the hands of our enemies.
Saue vs not from the
Sword to kill vs with Famine;
neither preserue vs from a corporall,
to starue vs with a spirituall.
Take not away one plaister, to apply
a smarter in the place; but
perfectly heale our wounds. Bee
absolutely reconciled vnto vs in
him, vpon whom thou hast already
layed the chastisement of
our peace. O remember not
our our old sinnes, but haue
mercy vpon vs, and that soone,
for wee are come to great misery.
Helpe vs, ô God of our
saluation, for the glory of thy
name; ô deliuer vs, and bee
mercifull to our sins for thy
names sake. O thinke vpon thy
congregation, and Mount

Sion wherein thou hast dwelt.
Looke vpon the hands of many
thousands that haue beene lifted
vp to thee in Publike, and many
more in Priuate, to iustifie thee in
thy Iudgements, and blesse thee
for thy mercies, and intreate thee
for this Land, and thy disconsolate
Spouse yet weeping in teares
of bloud in diuerse places.
                  
                  To strengthen and support the
weaker of these hands, and fill their
mouthes with continuall Deuotions,
I haue furnished and replenished
this Manuel, which I name
THE HAND-MAID To
PRIVATE DEVOTION, to
waite on her in her Chamber, or
Oratorie. The purtraying of her
Mistresse I leaue to the pensill of
some Diuine Apelles, whose taske
will be the harder, because she neuer
commeth abroade. All that my
intention aimeth at, and my endeauours
promise, is but to lay open a
priuate way, and set vp certaine
Stages for thy holy race, and pricke

thee on forward in it. Farre better
helpes in this kinde the pious charitie
and zeale of religious and learned
persons hath afforded thee; of
whom yet I may truely say, as Tully
spake of the Emperours that dealt
with Mithridates before Pompey,
Laudandum quod secerunt, ignoscendum
quod reliquerunt:
They are to be commended for
that they haue done, and pardoned
for that they left. What
they haue left, I labour to supply;
and if I cannot supply it, yet I
thought fit to implie and intimate,
that the Authors themselues, or
the Publishers of their workes,
might adde what they finde wanting.
                  
                      First my thinkes I see in their
bookes of Deuotion and prayers,
Salomon's temple, without the
gate called Bewtifull; I meane, exquisite
meditations, and orizons,
without an entrance thereunto by
preparation. With that part therefore
I begin; and it taketh vp the

more roome in my booke, because it
hath beene so scanted for place, or
rather quite excluded in theirs. In
it if thou finde some tertnesse, I intreate
thee (Courteous Reader) to
remember with me the precept of
the Lord Iesu, Haue salt, and haue
peace. If I haue salt, haue thou
peace, the rather, because Hymnes,
Prayers, and other religious exercises
are spirituall sacrifices; and euery
sacrifice by the Law was to be
seasoned with salt. Et quoniam
mel in Dei sacrificijs non offertur,
nimia dulcedo arte mutata
est, &amp; quâdam piperis austeritate
condita apud Deum nil tantum
suaue placet, nisi quod habet
in se aliquid mordacis veritatis.
It is S. Ierom's obseruation
vpon the legall sacrifices, that God
neuer appointed hony to be offered
vnto him. And the morall
truth vailed vnder that shadow, was
that in our spirituall oblations,
nothing pleaseth God that is
onely sweete, and hath not some

smacke 
                           〈◊〉
                         it of biting truth.
                  
                  
                      Next I haue much maruelled
what the reason might be that they
vndertaking to fit prayers and de
                        
                           ••
                        tions
to seuerall seasons, and
speciall occasions, baulked the Christian
faste and feasts. For albeit the
Saints dayes might fare the worse
with them, because Popish superstitiō
ouer cloyed them. Which yet is
an abuse of arguing to argue from
the abuse to the abolishing the right
vse. By this meanes they might
take from vs the vse of all Gods
creatures, because they haue beene
superstitiously or profanely abused
some way or other. But admit there
might be a legall caueat put in against
the Saints Plea, what haue
the feasts of our Lord and Sauiour
deserued, that they should be struck
out of their Callender, or sleightly
passed without the honour of a meditation,
Hymnes, or Prayer on
them? They cannot pleade want of
president, authoritie, or direction:
for they haue Coppies faire written

in golden characters by Chrysostome
in his Homilies, Chrysologus,
Leo, Augustine, Bernard, &amp;
other deuout Fathers in their Sermons
vpon these dayes. If they saw
not them, why did they not follow
the excellent patterne in the booke
of Common Prayer? Which laying
before me, I haue drawne formes of
exhortations, hymnes, and prayers,
carying throughout a manifest impression
of the feast to which they
are dedicated. And before them I
haue prefixed a Paralell of the Prophesie
of the old, and the Historie of
the new Testament compared together,
that thou mightest haue an
ocular demonstration of that
which S. Austine writeth concerning
both. The new Testament is
vailed in the old, and the old is reuealed
in the new.
                  After the feasts, or before as 
preparatiues to them, the Church
fasts should haue beene ranked. But
there being in their Deuotions no
spirituall dainties allowed for the

festiuals, I nothing maruelled at it
that Christian fastes were vtterly
vnprouided for, and (if I may so
speake) fast with them. Extraordinarie
fasts of humili

the ordinarie fasts of Deuotion,
they mention not at all. Yet certainely
the deuoute soule out of a
sympathie with her Sauiour cannot

                           •
                        oyce
with him, in some measure.
Fast with him on good-friday, as
well as feast with him, and for him,
on Easter day. If any teares of a sinner
are the wine of Angels, I am
perswaded they are those teares of
Deuotion, which after much fasting,
and Prayer, and meditation,
spring out of the serious apprehension
of Christs infinite loue testified
to man-kinde by his fasting, watching,
praying, weeping, bleeding, and
dying for vs on the Crosse. But they
wil say, these are the sacred fewell of
euery dayes deuotion. Yet it is more

proper to remember the 
                        •
                     orke of
the day, in the day wherein it was
wrought. And albeit the Iewes
were bound alwayes to remember
Gods wonderfull deliuerances; yet
more stricktly were they bound on
the very day for that end appointed
to be kept solemne. What though we
finde no expresse commandement
for them? The practise of the ancient
Church, and the religious constitutions
of the present, ratified by
Supreme authoritie, should sway in
a matter of this nature, according
to that golden rule of S. Bernard:
Obey him as God who is in the
place of God, in those things
that are not against God. These
fasts therefore should not haue bene
forgotten.
                  I come now in the last place to the
weekely Deuotions, wherein I finde
Prayers for each seuerall day of the
weeke. Yet as it is noted by the learned
of S. Gregories Comment vppon
Iob, that It is an excellent
Commentarie fraught with rich

learning especially in matter of
moralitie. But it might haue
beene wrote almost, as well vppon
any parcell of Scripture, as
vpon Iob. So you shall finde that
the Prayers for each day may serue
for any day as well as that to which
they are intituled. For example,
Munday's Prayer well fits Tuesday,
and Tuesday's Wednesday;
and all three, Thursday, Friday,
and Saturday. No day hath more
interest in the Deuotion for it
then another.
                  When Timothie found fault
with ALEXANDER for striking
a stroke amisse vpon the
Harpe, and Alexander demanded
of him; Is it not all one whether
I strike it this way, or that way,
with these fingers, or these?
True, answered Timothie, It is all
one to an Emperour, but not to a
Musitian, It is no error in stale to
strike as you doe; but it is an error
in art.
                  I confesse in like manner, it is

no error in Religion 
                        •
                      set a godly
Prayer for the day which hath no
interest or relation at all to the day;
yet it is an indecorum and blurre
in Art. It is all one as if they should
set a marke before them, and
shoote no more towards it then any
other white, To auoid this improprietie,
if not incongruitie, in the
Morning Hymne and Prayer, I
haue an eye to some worke of God
the Father in the Creation wrought
on that day: In the Euening Hymne
and Prayer to some worke of God
the Sonne wrought (or by the
Church remembred) on that day
in the Passion weeke.
                  
                     For the admonitions and exhortations
wherewith the Deuotions
are interlaced, I tooke my patterne
of them from S. CYPRIAN;S. Cyprian lib. de exhortatione Martyrij.

                  THE
PREPARATION
TO RELIGIOVS
exercises in generall.
                  
                     PAR. I. Of Deuotion.
                     
                        PRemeditation is the
preparation to priuate
prayer; priuate
to publicke; priuate,
and publicke to the hearing the
word; priuate, and publicke
prayer, together with the hearing
of the word to the worthie
participation of the holy Sacrament.
For the Sacrament receiues
strength and vigour from the
word preached; the word preached
from publicke prayer; publicke
prayer from priuate Deuotion;
and that from premeditation,

and consideration of the nature
of deuotion, and necessitie
of preparation it selfe to all holy
duties, in the immediate worship
of God.
                     
                     
                        Deuotion is the harts warmth,Of deuotion
or rather lifes bloud of religion: It
is a sacred bond knitting the soule
vnto God: It is a spirituall muskle
mouing onely vpward, and
lifting vp the hearts, eyes, and
hands continually vnto heauen.
And because it consisteth rather
in the feruour of the affections,
then light of the thoughts, of
blaze, or lustre in the words, it is
better felt then vnderstood, and
yet better vnderstood then can
be expressed. Especially, priuate
deuotion, which is the Saint to
whom I deuote this Treatise.
For priuate deuotion (to shunne
ostenta
                           •
                        ion, and hypocrisie in
heauenly things) alwayes shuts
her selfe vp in her closet, desiring
no eye to see her but her Fathers in
secret.
                        Math. 6. 6. Wounded she is (like the

spouse in the Canticles) with the
darts of diuine loue;
                        Greg. in Cant. and continually
bleedeth, but inwardly in
teares of compassion,Lachrimae sanguie animae, August.
                            compunction,
and excessiue ioy. There appeares
no externall orifez in the flesh to
be seene. Shee resembles the
strange plant in Plinie,Plin. lib. 21. c. 16. which
buds inwardly,
                        Flos nasc

                           tur non euidens sed in occulto, &amp; intùs germinatus, and shooteth forth
no bud, blossome, or leafe outwardly.
For if priuate deuotion
cometh once to be knowne, it
ceaseth to be priuate. The greatest
commendation of it is like
to that of the Garamantite,Plin. 37. c. 7. Garamantitis summa commendatio est, quod velut in translucido stillantes intus fulgent aur
                                 •

                        It is felt before it can be spoken
of, and it must be kindled in the
heart by the Spirit, before it can
be felt. It is the true Vest all fire
that should be still kept burning in

the heart;Val. Max. L

                           u. 
                        but if it go out (like
that of the Vestals) it must bee
kindled from heauen. 
                        To thee
therefore ô most holy Spirit I
addresse my prayer, to kindle
and keepe this fire in my soule
by thy heauenly blasts. Heate
my heart with the feruour of
true Deuotion, and touch my
tongue with a coale from thine
altar, that the words of my mouth
and meditations of my heart may
inflame all that reade these deuotions
with a loue of deuotion
it selfe, and true Zeale.
                     
                     
                        Lev's censure may seeme too
tart: He that is not more religious
in Lent then at other times hath no
religion as all. But I haue good
warrant to suspect the sinceritie
of their Deuotion altogether,
who are not more deuout in priuate
then in publike. For fire,
the closer it is kept, the hotter
it burneth; and the exhalations
which are violently detained
in cranies vnder ground,

and can haue no vent, are
of force to moue the earth it
selfe. It cannot be otherwise but
that the penitent, or compassionate
eye, which droppeth in
publike should runne and gush out
with riuers of waters in priuate.
The afflicted soule, which sometimes
stealeth a groane, and fetcheth
a sigh in the Church, offers
vp often prayers with strong cries
at home. He that is affected and
eleuated with spirituall ioy in
publike, is transported when he
is alone, and hath priuate communications
with God. S. Paul
spake words of truth and sobernesse
to the Corinthians,2. Cor. 5. 13. 
                        Whether we
he besides our selues it is to God, or
whether we be sober it is to you.

dayes (nay weekes) spent by
him in fasting and prayer, in the
end hee was rauished in spirit,
and seemed to haue priuate conuersation
and familiaritie with

quires of Angels. My intent is not
to detract any thing from publike
deuotion; but my desire is
to adde to priuate. Publike is
more solemne, but priuate ought
to be more frequent: Publike
makes more noise, but priuate
(for the most part) hath a deeper
channell. Our Sauiour diuideth
blessednesse equally betweene
them both; Blessed (saith he) is he
that heareth the word and keepeth
it: it is publike deuotion that
heareth the word preached, but
priuate that keepes it: Publike
gathereth Manna in greater aboundance;
but priuate is the
golden Omer that preserueth it.
The Hart doth not so pant and bray
for the riuers of waters, as the soule
of euery religious man longeth
for the waters of life, running plentifully
out of the golden spoutes
of the Temple, the Ministers of
the word; but priuate deuotion
it is that breedes this longing after
the publike Ministerie. Let

vs take a patterne of Deuotion
from our blessed Sauiour, to
whom all deuotions are due.
What commandeth hee by expresse
precept? When thou prayest
enter into thy closet:
                        Math. 6. 6. and what
commendeth hee most by his
owne practise? It is true, he calleth
his house the house of prayer;
and as we reade, that he was daily
preaching: so I doubt not but hee
was daily praying in the Temple;
yet ye shall find him oftener on
the Mount,
                        Math. 14. 27. or in the Garden,
                        Math. 26. 36. or in
some priuate solitarie place praying
alone,Ma
                              •
                           ke 1. 35. then in the Temple;Luke 6. 12.
yea,Luke 9. 8. 28 and continuing longer in
prayer,Luke 11. 1. 
                        spending sometimes whole
nights in it.Luke 22. 45. This practise of our
Sauiour hath bene a president to
all those whose names in the
Church of God are,Iohn 17. and haue
bene as a sweete ointment for daily
offering the sweetest incense of
prayer to God. Religious men
neuer are wanting in publike assemblies,
but they exceed in priuate

Deuotion. Publike exercises
of religion be their feasts, but
priuate their ordinarie. Where
find you Daniel but in his chamber
at his Deuotion looking towards
Ierusalem?
                        Dan. 6. 10. Where find you
Dauid but in his couch,Psal. 6. 6. watering
it with his teares,Psal. 77. 6. and communing
with his owne heart in the night?
                        Acts 10. 30.
Where find you Cornelius but in
his house in praying? Where find
you Saint Iohn on the Lords day
but in the Ile alone by himselfe
in the spirit.
                        Reuel. 1. 10. The powring out our
speciall complaints to God, our
vowes to refraine such companie
and such occasions of sinne; the
ripping vp of our whole life with
a particular confession of our sins,
aggrauated by all circumstances,
and all those parts of repentance,
or the soules discipline mentioned
by Saint Paul are most necessarie
exercises of religion,2. Cor. 7. 11. yet
cannot be so safely done, nor so
decently, nor so effectually in
publike as in priuate. These parts

are not to be acted on the stage,
but within the hangings.Commodius ista inter transiguntur. Ex. He that
actes these on the stage will haue
the person of an hypocrite put
vpon him for it.Luke 22. 44. Where was our
Sauiour in his agonie but alone
in Gethsemaine?
                        Math 26. 36. Where was hee
transfigured in his prayer but on
the holy Mount alone?Math. 17. 2.

our soules shall shine with all spirituall
graces, if we haue often
priuate conference with him by
prayer, but alwayes with due reuerence
and preparation before.

vncleane Spirit in the Gospell

we entertaine the most pure and
holy Spirit of God in an vncleane
roome in our soules? What
Courtier presumeth to come into
the Kings presence in stinking
and nastie cloathes, or with his
hands and face all besmeared
with dirt, or spotted with inke?
How dare we then appeare before
God with a foule and nastie
conscience; with a heart full of
malice; eyes full of adulterie; hands
full of the treasures of wickednesse;
mouthes full of deadly poyson of
Aspes? When wee haue defiled
our eyes with vnchast lookes,
shall we presently cast them vp
to heauen, and confidently looke
God in the face, who is a God of
most pure eyes, and cannot endure
the least spot of impuritie?
when we haue defiled our hands
with bloud or vncleannesse, or

telling our vse money, shall we
presently lift them vp in supplication
to God? when wee haue
defiled our tongues with corrupt
and rotten communication,

prayer? when we haue defiled
our bodies with beastly
lusts, and wallowed in the mire of
swinish pleasures, shall wee presently
present our selues as a sacrifice
vnto God in priuate or
publike deuotion? God by his
holy Prophet teacheth vs another
lesson;Esay 5. 6. 
                        wash you; make you
cleane; put away the euill of your
doings from before mine eyes; Cease
to do euill, learne to do well: Come
now let vs conferre and reason together.
                     
                     Secondly,2. Sequestration. he that will consecrate
his thoughts and affections
by priuate Deuotion vnto God,
must remoue and sequester them
from earthly affaires, and worldly
negotiations. For the cares of
this life, as they choake the seedes

of the word: so they stifle deuout
meditation in the wombe that
conceiueth them. It is not more
difficult to cast vp one eye to heauen,
and the other downe on the
earth at the same instant, then to
fixe our cogitations and intentions
at once, on God and the
world. Holinesse in the Greeke
implyeth a direct contradiction
to earthlinesse:

                        Hagios is deriued
from A: the priuatiue particle,
and Ge signifying earth as if you
would say vnearthlinesse. God is
a Spirit, and cannot be otherwise
seene of vs then in spirit.Math 5. 8. 
                        Blessed

see God. The soule of man is the
glasse most truly representing
Gods image. If a glasse be furd, or
soyled with dust or dirt, it reflecteth
no shape or proportion aright:Bern. de nat. dom. Tergat. speculum, mundet spiritum suum qui scitit videre deum.
but wipe the dust from the
glasse, and you shall see clearely.
So (saith Saint Bernard) rub thy
glasse, wipe away all dustie
earthlinesse from thy mind, and

thou shalt see God in thy soule,
and conceiue cleare and diuine
imaginations of him.
                     Thirdly, he that desireth that
God should haue respect to him,3. Preconsideration.
and to his spirituall offerings, must
bee more readie to heare the wise
man,Eccles. 5. 1. and looke to his foote, then
to make hast to offer the sacrifice
of fooles. What is it to offer the sacrifice
of fooles, but rashly, and vnaduisedly,
not to bring and lay
downe, but to throw his gifts on
Gods Altar without considering
what he offereth, or

whom? He that makes no more
of prayers to God then of speaking
with one of his companions,
nor of perusing inspired Scriptures,
then reading a peice of Aristotle
or Liuie, nor of participating
of the blessed Sacrament,
then taking a morsell of bread, or
drinking a cup of wine, can expect
no blessing for the vse, but
rather ought to feare a curse for
the abuse of these meanes of saluation.

These ordinances of God
sanctifie not such, but they rather
prophane them.
                     
                        Numa Pomphilius forbad any

haue forgotten the feare of the
Lord, euen in his presence, and

God is made so common in mens
mouthes, and his dreadfull Maiestie
so cheape in their estimamation,
that as they speake of
him without reuerence, so also
they speake to him without aduised

premeditation. They are
farre from Dauids modestie, who
went step by step,Suspenso gradu. and fetched
a compasse to come to Gods altar.Psal. 26. 6.

step to it. They suddenly and

they doe at their ordinary table,

                        My heart is indighting of a good
matter;Psal. 45. 1. 2. Psal. 39 3. my tongue is the penne of
a ready writer, saith the Kingly
Prophet, and againe, My heart
was hot within mee, while I was
musing the fire burned, then spake
I with my tongue: If this
sweete singer of Israel, first pricked
the notes in his heart before
he began to sing them; If he who
was inspired by the holy Ghost,
framed his Prayers, and Psalmes
of thanksgiuing in his minde, before
hee deliuered them by his
tongue; ought not we who are as
farre behinde him in his gifts, as
we are below him in condition,
much more meditate before we
vtter any thing to the Lord? I
speake not of pious 
                           •
                        iaculations,
which must needs be suddaine as
their occasions are, and the motions

of Gods Spirit within vs; but
of a set conceiued Prayer, wherein
we ought not onely well to
ponder the matter, but euen
weigh (if wee haue time) euery
word in the ballance, that they
bee not found too light,Eccles. 6. 5. 2. and
thereby our Prayers against sin,
be turned into sinne. Bee not rash
with thy mouth and let not thine
heart be hasty to vtter any thing before
God.Senec. Epist. Seneca obseruing how
bold men made with God, and
what strange petitions they blushed
not to preferre vnto him,
gaue this sage aduise, So deale
with men as if God saw thee, and
so speake with God as if men heard
thee.
                        Pers. introrsum obmurmurat ôsi ebullet patruij preclarii sumis, &amp; ôsi &amp;c. For many men vent such
vncharitable, enuious, and malitious
matters, such confused, and
vndigested stuffe, such impertinencies,
inconsequencies, &amp; absurdities,
especially in their priuate
extemporarie Prayers, as
they would be ashamed that any
man of quality or vnderstanding

should ouer heare them. It
would make a prophane man
laugh, but a Religious man
weepe to listen, and marke how
sometimes they court Almighty
God with idle complements;
sometimes they cast vp Prayers
with strong lines to heauen, hoping
thereby to drawe downe a
blessing from God; sometimes
they expostulate with God in a
sawcie, and sometimes pose him
in a ridiculous manner. Sometimes
they discourse profoundly
in their Prayer, as if they meant
in good earnest to teach Almighty
God what hee ought to doe;
Sometimes they are too tedious,
cloying his eares with bablings;
and vaine repetitions; and sometimes
againe they are too briefe,
curtayling their Orisens, and
breaking off in the middest. One
while they fly too high, and
meddle with counsells of State;
and another while they fall too
low, and tell God a Homely houshould

tale. If they heare a
strange Phrase, or an affected
straine of puf-past eloquence, this
they cull out carefully, and insert
into their garlands. Peter Moulin
iustly taxeth a Fryar for styling
Christ the Dolphin of heauen;
and I thinke he as well deserueth
blame who prayeth to
God that he may march to heauen
in perfect equipage, or come vnto
God, not with the soales of his foot,
but the foot of his soule: who layeth
open before God his manifold
defections, infections, imperfections;
his sinnes of an higher straine,
and deeper staine; and commendeth
to his gracious goodnesse al the Ministers
of the Church by what titles
soeuer they are signified, or dignified.
Giue me leaue to tell these men
in their owne language that this
is playing, not Praying; and that
in sending vp such prayers they
burne not incense to God, but incense
him rather: Or if they will
not heare me, let the graue high-Priest

among the ancient Romans
Schoole them as he did a Vestall
whom he obserued to be too curious,Sancte magis quam scite.
and neate about her work,
which was tending the holy fire.
Vergin doe your work holily rather
then handsomely; reuerently, rather
then trimly. There are a sort of
men in direct opposition to
these, who affect a kinde of Rhetorike
which weedeth out all
flowers of Rhetorike. They can
away with no Prayer, or meditation
which fauours of the lumpe,
though the oyle be sacred. Nothing
pleaseth them in this kinde,
but that which is spunne with
an ouer course thread. Coursnes

men in all other things like well
of art and wit, where the matter
is vile, and base; but in the
deliuery of heauenly conceptions,
vtterly abandon them. But
they should haue considered
better, that sharpnesse of wit,
and true eloquence are gifts of
God, and therefore best of all to
bee employed in holy things, as
gold and siluer are best bestowed
in adorning Gods house, so it bee
without superstition. Was not

Scarlet of as good▪ vse in the
Arke as Camels haire? Is not the
Queene brought into the spirituall

in Prayer are expressed
and prayed for.
                     HEauenly Father, whose gift
it is that I can aske any
good gift at thy hands, without
whose grace I cannot desire thy
healthfull and sauing grace: Infuse
into my heart the Spirit of supplication,
that in an awfull reuerence
of thy Maiestie, out of a true
sence and feeling of my wants
and infirmities, and a liuely faith
in thy promises; I may with
chearefulnesse of mind, and feruencie
of Deuotion, and constant
perseuerance lift vp a pure and
plaine heart vnto thee at all times:
humbly intreating thy souereigne
bountie for such things

onely as thou in thy eternall wisdome
hast pre-ordained to giue;
and calling vpon thee in such order
and manner as thou hast prescribed
me to aske in that absolute
patterne of all prayer set
downe in the Gospell by my
Lord and Sauiour Iesus Christ.
In whose name, mediation, and

Antidote against sinne, &amp;

the deadly poyson first entered.

Death stole in at the eare by suggestion
of the euill spirit, and
now life in the hearing of the
word passeth in at the same gate

of the soule, by the operation of
the holy Spirit. Hast thou an eare
(ô Christian by thy profession)
for the diuell, and none for God?
An eare to receiue poyson dropped
in, and not to receiue the
oyle of grace, and most pretious
balsame of Gods word instilled
by preaching? If thou art a sheepe
of Christ, and belongest to his
fold, shew his eare-marke: My
sheepe heare my voyce.
                     Heb. 10. 5. Where wee
reade in the Psalme according to
the Septuagint, and in the Epistle
to the Hebrewes,Psal 40. 6. 
                     A body thou
hast fitted or prepared me, it is in
the originall according to the
Hebrew, word for word, Mine
eares hast thou opened; to teach vs
that God fits vs and prepares vs
for his seruice, especially by boaring
our eares with those goades
and nailes that are fastened by the
Maisters of the assemblies, and are
giuen from one sheapheard: I socrates
aduiseth Demonicus to employ
all his leasure time in diligently

hearing the penned Orations
and speeches of eloquent
Orators, and graue Counsellers.
For so (saith hee) thou shalt get
that with much ease which cost another
man much paines. That
which a diuine Orator, and heauenly
Preacher hath beene many
weekes (perhaps yeeres) in laying
together, hee scattereth abroad
in an hower. Obseruest
thou not how the Manna which
he gathereth graine by graine, or
seede by seede hee deliuereth out
to thee in whole Omers, yea
and Ephaes too? Yea but thou
art well stored with this heauenly
prouision, and foode of Angels,
thy library is like a rich Granarie,
and why maist thou not then
as well or better spend thy time,
in perusing such writings then
repairing to the Church perhaps
a good way from thy house, to
heare a man of meaner gifts then
those were or are, whose works
thou hast in the last and best editions

by thee I perceiue by this
obiection that thou hast heard
much against hearing, heare now
a little for it.
                  First, as a great Master of the
Law was wont to say, that
Courts of iustice must not Clash
one against another: so it is most
certaine that duties of piety
ought not Clash, iustle, or any
way crosse one the other. Priuate
reading and publike hearing
must both haue their places, seasons,
and turnes. If thou art so
straightned in time, or ouerlaid
with businesse that thou canst not
allow a fit time for both, let the
priuate, voluntary alwaies giue
place to the publike necessary duty.
The cōmandements of God, &amp;
the Church wherein thou liuest
ought to ouersway thy priuate
opinion, fancie, or inclination; or
perhaps diabolicall tentation. If
thy Pastor be so strictly charged
to preach vnto thee, certainely
thou art necessarily bound to

heare him. For these duties are
linked together. Hath priuate
reading the like promises to publike
hearing the Word? Or is
it of like force and efficacie?
Where thou canst name one that
hath beene wonne to the Christian
faith and true godlinesse by
bare reading wee can produce
many thousands that haue beene
added to the Church by publike
Sermons: yea sometimes at one
Sermon. The holy Ghost in the
day of Pentecost came with the
sound.
                     Acts 2. 41. Where the sound is of the
Word Preached there goeth the
Spirit ordinarily. Yet I deny
not but that men in priuate reading
the Scriptures and other
holy books may &amp; do feele some
soft and sweet blasts of the holy
spirit; but in the publike Ministry
of the Word, the Spirit
commeth downe like a mighty
rushing winde filling the whole
roome, wee receiue then grace in
a fuller measure. Sermons preached

are compared to raine and
deaw, but printed to snow;
which though it lye longer on
the ground, yet it is much colder,
and doth not in like sort
pierce, moysten, and fatten the
ground as the other. Moreouer
those things that haue passed the
presse lye by vs; wee may at any
time haue, and vse them: but the
notes of a Sermon preached are
like the Manna that fell on the
Saturday which (if it was not
presently gathered) was vtterly
lost. There is much difference
betweene those generall Receipts
you finde in Physick
bookes, and a speciall potion or
Electuary made by a trusty Apothecary,
according to the direction
of a Learned Physitian, and
particularly applyed to thy peculiare
disease. Euery man hath not
the skill of the Apothecary to
make the confection, and fewer
haue the iudgement of an experienced
physitian to direct where

and how it ought to bee giuen.
And albeit thy preacher bee a
man of no very extraordinary
gifts, yet in regard he is an Ambassadour
sent from God vnto thee
if he faithfully (though perhaps
not so eloquently) deliuer his
message vnto thee thou oughtst
to heare it; and honour him for
his Masters sake. His feete cannot
but seeme beautifull to thee if they
be sho

certainly if thou bee not a drone
thy selfe, thou mayest sucke from
the mouth of the barrenest and
(as thou callest him) the dryest
Preacher, Doctrine sweeter then
the hony or the hony combe. Although
I assent freely to Lactantius
that the truth findeth easyer-entrance
into the soule when she commeth
armed,Lactan. instit diuin. lib. 1. c. 1. Potentius inanimos influit. &amp; visuâ instructa, &amp; luce orationis ornata. not onely with her
owne strength but also with the

best aide, wit, or art can afford. Yet
withall I affirme with Saint Paul
that faith standeth not in the entising
words of mans wisedome, but in
the demonstration of the Spirit,
and the power of God. Art may
moue affection; but nothing
but Gods Word and the grace
of the Spirit can remoue corruption.
Humane wit and learning
may tickle the eare, and (as Seneca
speakes of Chrysippus his acute
Sentences) pricke,Sen Epist. 1. ad Lucsliū. Pungst non penetrat. Heb. 4. 12. Peircing to the deuiding &amp;c.
                         but neuer pierce
the heart: that is the singular
prerogatiue of the Word of
God. What are Rams-hornes in

Yet when God commands and
appoints, the harsh sound of
them, shall demolish those strong

haue thy eares tickled, but thy

                     heart pricked, and make then no
doubt but that God will blesse
his ordinance and thy obedience;
and supply to thee by his Spirit
what may bee deficient in the
Preachers learning or language.
But then thou must come prepared
to the hearing of the Word
by such directions as are set
downe in the Word.

                     The Preparatory Prayer.
                     GRatious God who hast
appointed the opening of
the Scriptures by preaching
to bee the ordinary
meanes of saluation to all thy
chosen; blesse this thine ordinance

to me, and prepare me for
it. Grant that thy Word being
mixed with faith in me may bee
vnto me a sauour of life vnto life,
and not a sauour of death vnto
death. Direct and assist thy Minister
that hee may rightly diuide
it. Open vnto him the dore of vtterance,
that what he hath conceiued
in thy feare vpon thy holy
Oracles, hee may deliuer to thy
glory. Fill him with the holy Ghost
that his lips may bee full of grace,
and that he may speake instruction
to mine ignorance, correction
to my errors, comfort to mine
afflictions, and peace to my conscience.
Guide the sword of the
spirit in his hand that it may
meete with, and smite my speciall
corruptions and bosome sins,
knowne, or vnknowne; and giue
me patience to endure the iust reproofe
of them by his Ministry,
and loue him for it, and amend
by it. Open my heart that I may
attend to those things that belong

to my peace. Endue me with wisdome,
and spirituall vnderstanding
that I may descerne those things
that differ, and try all things, and
hold that which is good, and apply
it to my selfe for the subduing
of my fleshly members, and affections,
and building me vp in the most
holy faith of thine Elect. Quicken
me with thy spirit that I may
cheerefully, and willingly, and
constantly listen to the voice of
the heauenly charmer, that hee
may kill the venome of sinne in
my soule. Let the words of thy
Preacher drop as raine, and distill
as deaw vpon me, and into mee
to make my barren heart fruitfull
in holy affections &amp; desires;
my minde in heauenly thoughts
and conceptions; my tongue in
wholsome words, and graceful speeches;
my hands in all manner of
good workes, that I proue not an
idle hearer but a doer, of the Word,
&amp; constant practicer of al holy duties
to the honour of thy holy and

blessed Name, and the saluation
of my soule in the day of the Lord
Iesus, To whom with thee and
the holy Ghost, &amp;c.
                  
               
               
                  The Preparation to the
receiuing of the holy
Sacrament.
                  IT being reuealed to aged Simeon
that hee should see his
Sauiour in the flesh before
hee rendered vp his owne
Spirit;Ber. Serm. de purificatione Hodie dominus Templi ingressus est Templum Domini. when hee came into the
Temple of the Lord and there
found the Lord of the Temple, hee
was so ouer-ioyed there with
that hee tooke the babe into his
armes, embraced it, and began
his Swan-like song or Nunc dimittis,
saying, Lord now lettest
thou thy seruant depart in peace;
for I haue seene the Prince of
Peace. Mine eyes haue seene thy
saluation, and I desire to see no
more. Into thy hands ô sweete

babe whom I hold in mine arms I
commend my fainting Spirit, Embrace
my soule with thine armes
of mercy, as I embrace thy body
with these arms of flesh. This singular
prerogatiue of Simeon, (or
rather a farre greater) the Lord
vouchsafeth thee ô deuout soule,
when he biddeth thee to his holy
Table; euen to take into thy hands
thy Sauiour: To see with thine eyes,
&amp; handle with thy hands, yea and
taste with thy mouth the Word of
life. For by, &amp; with the sacred elements,
(though not in, or vnder
them) thou partakest of the flesh
and bloud of the Son of God spiritually,
(for his words are spirit
and life) yet truly, and in very
deede, for hee is the liuing bread
that came downe from heauen; his
flesh is meate indeede, and his blood
is drinke indeede. As at sumptuous
feasts where curious seruices
are, thou seest the proportion and
shape of the Deere or Fowle set
out in gold and colours on the

outside or lidde of those baked
meates which are truly contained
vnder it, and to bee eaten:
So vnder the holy formes of bread
and wine thou feedest on thy Sauiour.
That which is represented in
the signe to the eye of the body
is presented in the thing signified
to the eye of the soule and hand
of thy faith; what is shadowed
in the Sacrament is truly also exhibited
by it. Qui credit edit: If
thou belieuest that thou eatest, thou
eatest that thou belieuest: let no
hereticall Harpyes pluck from
thee thy heauenly dish or meate
as Celaeno did Aeneas's.
                  
                  Beware of two sorts of Hereticks
especially, which seeke to
beguile thee in the Sacrament, or
rather of it
viz the

                        Sacramentaries.
                        Papists.
                     
the one denyeth the signe, the other
the thing signified. The one
offereth thee a shadow without
the body, the other the body
without the shadow, and consequently

neither of them giueth
thee the true Sacrament which
in nature and substance cosisteth
of both. The Sacramentary
would robb thee of the Iewell,
the Papist of the Casket. Lay thou
thine hands on both, hold both
fast as thou seest the verity and
substance of the one, so beleeue
that verity and substance of the
other. As thou takest the one,
receiue the other: As thou handlest
the one, apprehend the other:
As thou feedest with thy mouth
on the one, feede in thy heart
on the other: And as truly as the
one nourisheth thy body to a temporall,
so the other shall preserue
thy soule to eternall life. For it
is the tree of Life which growes in
the middest of the Paradice of
God, his Church on earth. The
way to the mysticall tree in Paradice
was guarded by an Angel
wauing a flaming sword: The way
to this in like manner is fenced.
There stands an Angell at the

Table; Gods Minister brandishing
the sword of the Spirit, and
forbidding (vnder paine of
death) any to eate of this fruit,
that haue their teeth set on edge
with the apples of Sodome and
grapes of Gomorrah. Other fruits
and meate are prepared for vs;
but we must be prepared for this
before we eate it. The bread of
the earth cannot feed when thou
eatest it, till it bee changed into
thy body because thou art more
excellent then it: but this bread
which came downe from heauen
is more excellent then thou art,
and therefore thou must be changed
into it before it nourish
thee. All other meate is receiued
as it is in it selfe, and no otherwise:
but this is diuers as it is receiued.
Other meate affecteth
and altereth the taste, but heere
the taste altereth the meate. For
if it be worthily receiued it is the
body and blood of Christ; if vnworthily
it is but bare bread and

wine. If it meete with a spirituall
taste, and appetite, &amp; stomack
purged and prepared, it proueth
the food of life, nay of immortality:
if otherwise, it turneth into
deadly poyson:

and drinketh vnworthily, eateth and
drinketh damnation to himselfe not
discerning the Lords body. A learned
Physitian that tendreth the
health and life of thy body will
neuer minister strong physick
that will amend or end thee before
hee prepareth thy body accordingly.
This Sacrament is not
onely foode, but also physick to
cure thy soule; yea such strong
physick as will worke effectually
one way or other, to thy health
and saluation, or to thy death
and damnation. Bee carefull
therefore before thou takest it to
prepare thy selfe for it; and for
thy helpe peruse the Admonition,
Hymne, and Prayer following.

Communion.
                     GRacious Redeemer, who out
of thy pierced side openedst to
all that thirst for thy grace a double
fountaine for sinne and vncleannesse,
the one of water, the other
of bloud; the one to purge the
guilt, the other the filth of sinne,

and hast sealed these inestimable
benefits of sanctification and redemption
vnto all beleeuers by
the Sacraments of Baptisme and
of thy holy Supper, assist me by
thy Spirit in the sanctified vse of
these holy Mysteries and Symholls
of thy most blessed bodie
and bloud. Most louing &amp; bountifull
Lord, who hast prepared
such a table for me, giue me a
mouth and stomacke according,
that I may worthily receiue these
heauenly dainties to the glorie
of thine infinite goodnesse, and
the euerlasting comfort of my
soule. Cleare the eyes of mine
vnderstanding from all mists of
hereticall fancies &amp; carnall imaginations,
that I may rightly distinguish
the signes from the
things signified by them, and also
discerne thy bodie from common
meate. Sharpen my appetite
that I may hungrily feede vpon
this bread, of which whosoeuer
eateth shall neuer hunger; and

stily drinke of this cup, of which
whosoeuer drinketh shall neuer
thirst, O thou true foode of
my soule, receiue me who am
now to receiue thee. Quicken
me with thy Spirit, who wilt
feede me with thy flesh, vouchsafe
me thy grace, who communicatest
to me thy nature, that as
in and by these holy Mysteries, I
receiue life from thee: so I may
also receiue by them grace to liue
to thee: not seeking mine owne pleasure,
nor doing mine owne will, but
deuoting the remainder of my
life to thy seruice, and yeelding
my selfe wholly to the power of
thy sanctifying grace, to worke in
me alwaies that which is pleasing in
thy sight. So be it. Amen.
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                  Religious duties to be performed
at the time of the receiuing
the Communion.
                  
                     1. Prepare thy body by a decent
gesture.
                     2. Recollect thy mind, and fixe
thy thoughts wholly vpon this
most sacred action stir vp in thee.
                     3. Stirre vp
in thee.

                           
                              1 An holy feare out of this consideration,
that God is there
present in a speciall manner,
and his Angels attending on
him, and obseruing thee.
                              Say to thy selfe in the words
of Iacoh.
                              
                              O how fearefull is this place;
it is no other then the house of
God, and gate of heauen.
                           
                           
                              2 An holy astonishment or admiration,
out of this consideration
that the Lord thy
Maker and Redeemer, and
the high possessour of heauen
and earth, so farre humbles
himselfe as to bee thy
guest.
                              
                                 
Say to thy selfe in the words
of Salomon.
                              
                              Is it true indeed that God
will dwell on the earth? Behold
the heauen, and heauen of heauens
cannot containe him; how
much lesse the narrow roome
of my soule? 1. King 8. 27.
                              
                           
                           
                              3 An holy abashment or confusion,
out of this consideration,
that so vile a
worme, and sinfull wretch
as thou art should haue so
infinite a Maiestie, and holy
God to come and sup with
thee.
                              Say to thy selfe in the words
of the Centurion.
                              
                              Lord I am not worthy that
thou shouldest come vnder my
roofe: or with S. Peter, Depart
from me, for I am a sinfull
man.
                           
                           
                              4 An holy sorrow out of this
consideration, y• thy sins did
put thy Sauiour to these torments,
which are signified,

and liuely represented in
this Sacrament.
                              Say to thy selfe in the words
of Ieremiah.
                              
                              O that mine eyes were a
fountaine of teares to bewaile
those sinnes which drew so
much bloud from my Sauiour.
                           
                           
                              5 An holy ioy, out of this consideration,
that the infinite
debt of thy sins is discharged,
and the acquittance deliuered
into thy hands.
                              Say to thy selfe in the words
spoken of Zacheus.
                              
                              This day saluation is come
into mine house.
                           
                           
                              6 An holy desire of expressing
some kind of thankfulnesse
to God, out of this consideration,
that together with
the Sacramēt thou receiuest
Christ himselfe, and all the
benefits of his passion.
                              Say to thy selfe in the words
of Dauid.
                              
                              
                                 
What shall I render vnto the
Lord for all his benefits that
he hath done vnto me? I will
take the cup of saluation, and
call vpon the name of the
Lord.
                           
                        
                     
                  
                  4 Ioyne the signes with the
things signified.

                        Prepare me before
                        Assist me in
                        Comfort and confirme me after

                        4 Faith in thy promises.
                        5 Loue to thy members.
                        6 Thankfulnesse for
this inestimable fauour
thou vouchsafest
me inbidding
me to thine owne
Table.
                     
                  
               
               
                  A short thanksgiuing after
the Communion, to be vsed in
the seate or at the
Lords Table.
                  GRacious Redeemer, I most
heartily thank thee for these
pledges of thy loue, and tokens
of thy fauour, and seales of the
generall pardon for all my sins.
And I vow by the helpe of thy
strengthening grace from henceforth
euer to abstaine euen from all

appearance of euill, &amp; neuer willingly
to offend thee in thought,
word, or deed. How shou

                         sinne
against thee who hast died for me,
and washed my sinnes in thy bloud,
which I haue now receiued to
my vnspeakable comfort? Another.
                  Affect me with a taste of this
heauenly food, and continue the
rellish of it in the mouth of my
soule; &amp; make me for euer hereafter
loath the worlds delicacies,

                  Welcome blessed and heauenly
guest, my dearest Lord and
bountifull Sauiour. I bow the
knees of my heart vnto thee; I put
my hands vnder thy sacred feete
pierced with nailes for me; I lay
downe before thee the keyes of

                     How is it that my Lord is come
himselfe to visite me.
                     Vse also this forme. Can a sinfull
man expect of God such grace?
much lesse deserue it. Wilt thou
conuerse with Publicans and such
sinners as I am? Nay wilt thou not
onely eate with them, but suffer
thy selfe to be eaten of them? I
am astonished at this thy wonderfull
humilitie, and vnconceiueable
loue, Lord make me
for euer mindfull of it, &amp; thankfull
for it. Amen.
                  Glorie be to God on high,Or this. on
earth peace, and eternall comfort
in my conscience. I am fed now
with thy body, and my heart is

cheared with the cup of the new
Testament in thy bloud Now I am
incorporated into thy mysticall
body, and am made flesh of thy
flesh, bone of thy bone. Lord let nothing
be euer able to separate me
from this; but sith all things worke
for the good of thy chosen, let all
things more and more vnite me
to thee, that I may grow from
grace to grace, and strength to
strength, till I come to the fuu
measure of thy perfect age. Amen.
                  I haue now eaten of this bread
and drunke of this cup,
                     Or this. according
to thine holy ordinance: Lord
grant that I may feele in my soule
the effect of this spirituall refection,
by the confirming of my
faith, assurance of my hope, enlargement
of my loue, and my
increase in spirituall strength against
all tentations.
                  At my conception and birth
thou gauest me my selfe ô Lord,Or this.
and now according to thy promise

in the Sacrament thou hast
giuen me thy selfe, and by faith I
haue receiued thee. I can do no
lesse, and I would I could do
more then giue my selfe wholly
vnto thee. Refuse me not who
hast giuen thy selfe for me, and vnto
me. Take me into thy fauour
and seruice. Keepe mee in thy
Church which is thy house continually,
and protect me against
all my bodily and ghostly enemies.
               
               
                  A larger forme of Thanksgiuing
after thou returnest to
thy house or chamber from
receiuing the
Communion.
                  I Yeeld vnto thee, ô most bountifull,
gracious, and euerliuing
Lord and Sauiour, the greatest
thanks my heart can conceiue, or
tongue expresse, for this inestimable
fauour, that thou vouchsafest

to bid me to thine owne
Table, and there hast feasted my
soule with the true Manna that
came downe from heauen, the
foode of Angels, thine owne
blessed body and bloud. O knit
my heart, and affections for euer
vnto thee, who hast substantially
and inseparably vnited thy selfe
vnto mankind, by taking flesh
from vs in thine incarnation, and
giuing vs thy flesh in this sacred
institution. What shall be able to
separate me from thee, or from thy
members, who by thy Spirit and
vertue of this Sacrament, am truly
incorporated into thee, and
made a member of thy mysticall
body? How can I question thy
loue, who hast giuen me this
pledge of thy fauour? How can I
forget thy bitter death and passion,
whereof thou hast instituted
so liuely a memoriall? How can I
doubt of thy promises, whereof
thou hast giuen such a seale? How
should I distrust my future inheritance,
                     
whereof thou hast giuen
me this earnest? I know thou wilt
denie me no good thing, who hast
giuen me thy selfe. I know that I
shall liue eternally and blessedly,
because by thy faith working in
and through this Sacrament, I
receiue the seede of immortalitie;
I am truly made partaker of
thy naturall, yea and a liuely part
of thy mysticall bodie; and when
the head reigneth in eternall glorie,
the members must needs participate
of glorious eternitie.
What shall I offer vnto thee for
these so singular benefits, which
I receiue by the Sacrament? My
body is vile, my soule sinfull, and
worse then nothing in respect of
thy glorious and sacred flesh and
bloud. One drop of thy bloud
is more to be valued, then a thousand
worlds; which yet to testifie
the aboundance of thy loue,
thou pouredst out, and offeredst
plentifully for me vpon the crosse,
and now affordest to me in the

                     cup. Shall I not spend my dearest
hearts bloud in thy seruice, who
hast shed thine for me? Shall I
not willingly seale thy truth (if
need bee) with my bloud, who
haue now receiued the pardon
of all my sinnes, signed with it?
What shall I render to thee for
all thy louing mercies contained
in this conduit of thy grace? I
will take this cup of saluation, and
I will not refuse the cup of trembling
for thy sake, by the helpe of
thy grace I will more strictly
keepe my holy vowes which I
haue heretofore made, and now
renew. I will seeke to carrie my
selfe as a guest of so holy a table.
Hauing eaten Angels meate, I will
endeauour my selfe to leade an
Angels life. Hauing supped with
thee, I will rest with thee, &amp; haue
my conuersation in heauen, and
dwell with thee for euer. Amen.
                  
               
               
                  
                  THE PRACTICE
OF PRIVATE DEVOtion,
both ordinarie and extraordinarie,
in health and sicknesse,
and at the houre
of death.
                  
                     The scope of the Author and
reason of his method
and order.
                     
                        CHRISTIAN READER,
                     
                     
                        IN these Deuotions
which I first offered
(for the greater
part) to God
for my selfe, and
now offer to the presse for thy
vse, all that I intend, affect, and
labour for is, to expres
                           •
                        e in the
matter pious affection; in the
forme Scripture phrase and elocution.

For it seemeth to mee
most agreeable to speake to God
as neare as wee can in the same
language he speakes to vs, which
is the sanctified language of the
Bible. As for affected humane
eloquence (consisting instreined
conceits of wit, and swelling words
of vanitie) which, as it is puffed
vp it selfe, so it puffeth vp
those that vse it; I hold it altogether
vnfit for a Minister of the
Gospell, especially in meditations,
or exercises of this nature.
For in these we ought most of all
to denie our selues, and to captiuate,
not onely our thoughts to the
conceptions, but our tongs to the
words and phrases of the inspired
Oracles of God. As Menander
said of women, that they were fairest
who were not painted at all, and
Tullie of Atticus his booke, that
the grauitie of the stile, and neglect
of light ornaments was a gra
                              •
                           e
and ornament vnto it: So it may
be most truly auouched of holy

vowes, meditations, and prayers,
that sinceritie is best art, and simplicitie
their garbe, modesty their
trimming, and zeale their glorie,
when they are so conceiued and
vttered, that they shew most affection
and least affectation of
art, wit, or language. Sighs are
the figures that moue Almightie
God, and teares the fluent and
most current Rhetoricke before
him; for he that made the mouth
is not taken with words, vnlesse
they be such as proceed from his
owne mouth, and are warranted
by his word: such as carrie in
them a manifest print of that patterne
of sound or wholesome words
set before vs by the Apostles.
Now a swelling member is not
sound,Quint instit Orat. Tumor licet grandis contrarius est sanitati. neither is blowne meate
wholesome. The wisest among
the heathen could distinguish
betweene a Matrons and a Curtizans
attire and ornaments; a
loftie and a turgent stile; the
Asiaticke Superfluitie, and Attick

knife and modesty which pruned
the luxuriancy of pregnant wits,
&amp; flourishing styles running out
into superfluous stemmes, that
the presses of eloquence might abound,
not with leaues of words, but
iuyce &amp; sap of Sentences, as it were
grapes pressed together. Thus eloquently

                        Draw me saith the Spowse, we
will runne after thee, say her honourable
attendants, because of
the sweete sauour of thy oyntments.
The spowse of Christ delighteth
not in exoticall perfumes though
neuer so costly, because howsoeuer
they please thy smell, yet
they corrupt the braine, and oftentimes

poyson the spirits. But
the smell of Christs oyntments, who
was annointed with the oyle of
gladnesse aboue all his brethren, is
the sauour of life vnto life. Therefore
both the Spowse her selfe,
and all her maides of honour (i. e.
Virgins and chaste soules) runne after
it:Origen in Cant. And this my hand-maid
also followeth after them, yet as
Peter followed Christ, a farre off.
The path in which shee treads is
this.
                     From the generall she passeth
to particular, from extraordinary
to ordinary, from the chamber
and Closet, to the sicke and
death-bedds Deuotion.
                     
                        Haec erit admissa met a terendarota.
                        1 BEcause the morning and
euening were euery day
in the weeke I beginne with the
dayes Deuotion in generall, and
for morning and euening I frame

such Admonitions, Hymnes, and
Prayers, as may serue for any
day, Sabboth, or weeke day, festiuall
or common.
                        2. Next I furnish the Christian
Sabboth, because (as Ignatius
styleth it) it is the chiefe and soueraigne
day, and the Queene of
all dayes, and may rightly challenge
the precedency of all festiualls,
both in regard of Gods
strict command for the religious
obseruing it, and for that it is the
sampler of them, they being cut
as it were out of the dayes of the
weeke, otherwise dayes of labour,
according to the patterne
of the Sabboths rest.
                        3. The feasts peculiarly dedicated
to our Sauiour and the holy
Ghost succeede the Sabboth,
and precede the weeke dayes.
For whatsoeuer scruple hath bin
made of Saints dayes, the whole
world as farre as it is, or euer
was Christian, hath obserued religiously,
these feasts as Monuments

and a kinde of Sacraments
to refresh the memory of the
chiefe workes of our Lord, and
mysteries of our faith, to checke
and controle whose vniuersall and
vniforme practice, especially in a
matter of this nature is most insolent
madnesse.
                           Aug. Epist. ad Ianuarium. God (saith Paulinus)
hath garnished the Church
Calender with festiuall dayes, as
the heauen with Starres, or a garlād
with roses. Is not Christ the rose
of Sharon, and the bright morning
Starre? Doubtles then the festiualls
in speciall consecrated to
him, ought to bee as the fairest
flowrs in the round garland of the
yeere, and brightest Starres in the
Church-firmament. Wee neuer
reade of any (saith Caluin) that
were blamed for drawing too much
water out of the well of life: Neither
can wee possibly giue too
much honour to the King of glory.
                           Bern. Serm. de. Pent.
Saint Bernards consequence
is as sound as it is pious. If we celebrate
the Saints solemnities,

                           how much more ought wee to
keepe his who made them
Saints?
                        
                        In the Deuotion fitted to these
dayes, first I lay the ground out of
Scripture, and then descant vpon
it in the Admonition,
Hymne, and Prayer; all which
allude to the History of that
feast.
                        4. After these feasts, the weekdayes
come in their order. The
Saints, Martyrs, and Arch-angels
dayes I haue purposely omitted:
not that I dislike the keeping of
them; for I haue euer, and will
iustify, and maintaine the obseruation
of them, according to that
godly institution, and practice of
our Church. But I desired to
keepe my book within the compasse
of the title, which is a Manuell.
And albeit wee honour
Saints, and Martyrs, yet religious
Deuotion which is my Theame is
restrained to God by holy Dauid.
Whom haue I in heauen but thee ô

Lord. In the Church of Rome
there are many Deuotion
                                 •
                              
                            to
Saints, and more to our Lady
then to Christ, but wee acknowledge
no religious Deuotions, but
to him who charmed the old Serpent,
with that voice of his
Father! Him onely shalt thou
serue.
                        
                        In the weeke daies Deuotion,
those words of our Sauiour were
my loadestarre. My father worketh,
and I worke: For all the morning
prayers haue relation to
some worke of God the Father,
in the sixe dayes of Creation: and
all the euening to some worke of
God the Sonne, in the sixe dayes,
immediately before his glorious
resurrection. The admonitions
for morning and euening, containe
12 beatitudes, or blessednes;
8 mentioned by our Sauiour,
Mathew 5. and the rest out of
other choice Texts of Scripture.
All which blessednesses
I wish thee from my

heart, desiring thee to
afford me one Prayer,
who haue stored
thee with
many.

Morning.

word of Prophecie
whereunto ye do well
that yee take heede, as vnto a
light that shineth in a dark place,
vntill the day dawne, and the day
starre arise in your hearts. 1 Pet.
1. 19.

of Dauid (saith Christ)
and I am the bright morning
Starre. Reu. 22. 16.
                     
                        Awake thou that sleepest, and
arise from the dead, and Christ
shall giue thee light. Ephes. 5. 14.
                     It is now time to awake out of
sleepe, for now our saluation is
neerer then when wee belieued.
Rom. 13. 11.
                     The night is past, the day is at

hand, therfore cast off the works
of darknesse, and put on the armour
of light. verse 12.

redeeming the time, because
the dayes are euill Eph 5. 15.
                     Walke honestly as in the day,
not in rioting, and drunkennesse,
not in chambering, and wantonesse,
not in strife and enuying,
but put on the Lord Iesus, and
make no prouision for the flesh,
to fulfill the lusts thereof. Rom.

                     Teach me to number my dayes

Psal. 32. 9.
                     Teach mee thy way ô Lord,

                     A Prayer for the
Morning.
                     
                        GRacious Father, rich in
mercy to all thy children
that call vpon thee, accept
I beseech thee this my morning
Sacrifice of praise, &amp; thanks giuing,
which with a willing heart, and
deuout affection I offer vnto thee
in confidence of thy sonnes infinite
merits, and acknowledgement
of thine euerlasting loue,
and those inestimable benefits
which by him, and for him, and
with him thou conferredst vpon
me, and all thine Elect in him.
How deare are the thoughts of thy

mercies vnto me how great is the

                              •
                           umme of them? Who can value
the precious Pearle of thy
Word, and treasure of thy grace?
Who can raise his thoughts, and
desires to the high price of our 
                           
                              •

                           ble crowne of glory
layd vp for vs in heauen? Lord
fit me with thy grace, that I may
abound in thanksgiuing, and
praises for it. Enlarge my heart
with thy loue, that I may in some
sort comprehend with al Saints the
measure of thine infinite 
                           •
                        oue m
                              •
                           
                           nifested
to me in the faith of Iesus
Christ, and abundantly testified
by writing my name in the booke of
life before I was; and engrauing
me as a signet with thine owne
image at my creation; and when
I had defaced▪ and in a manner
quite raced it out, by renuing it
in me againe, and redeeming mee
that had sold my selfe as a bondslaue
vnder sinne, and death, not
with corruptible things, as gold,
siluer or pretious stones, but with

the inualuable, and incorruptible
blood of thine onely begotten son,
who gaue his life for my ransome,
and by his suffering, and death
hath purchased for me a crowne
of life. To whom therefore
with thee, and thy spirit
which sealeth all thy mercies vnto
me, and me vnto the day of redemption,
bee ascribed the whole
glory of my creation, redemption,
sanctification, and saluation.
For vnto me nothing belongeth but
shame, and confusion, who insteede
of embracing any mercy, and answering
thy loue, prouoke thy
iustice, and incense thy wrath,
and grieue thy spirit, and despight
thy grace, and as much as in me
lyeth, crucifie againe to my selfe the
Lord of life, and trample the blood
of the New Testament vnder foot.
Such is my peruerse nature, and
vngratious disposition, that the
better thou art to me, the worse
I proue to thee. What couldest
thou haue done vnto mee that thou

hast not done? Thou hast planted
me in a fruitfull country; thou
hast fenced mee with thy prouidence;
watered me with the former,
and latter raine of thy Word,
pruned me with milde, and seasonable
afflictions; and thou castest
continually the hot and
bright beames of thy fauour vpon
me; and thou lookest for grapes,
but behold nothing but wilde
grapes. What remaineth therefore
but that thou shouldest roote mee
out of thy vineard, and plant
another in my place that might
bring forth better fruits? Yet thou
sparest mee and striuest to ouercome
my euill nature with thy
goodnesse? Mine eyes gush out
like riuers of waters for my sin
and the sinne of this nation. Doth
not the land euen groane vnder the
heauy burden of our transgressions?
Haue not our infectious
sinnes long agoe deserued an
infectious disease, and our
rebellions against thee the sword;

and our barrennesse in good workes
a dearth; and our want of penitent,
and compassionate teares a
drouth; our ouerflowing luxury
a deluge, and our burning lusts
fier from heauen; and our loathing
the Manna of our soule a famine
of the Word? Notwithstanding
thy mercie triumpheth ouer iustice,
and contrary to mine and all
our deserts, and aboue hope of any
of vs thou sendest blessings for
curses; peace for trouble; plenty
for want; beauty for ashes; and
the oyle of gladnesse for the spirit of
heauinesse. Who is a God like vnto
thee that pardoneth iniquity, and
passeth by the transgression of the
remnant of his heritage? who considerest
not the euill that we do,
but the goodnesse which thou
art. This last night past for the
sinnes of the former day, thou
mightest most iustly haue taken
me away in the darke, and east
mee 
                           
                              •
                           nto vtter darknesse. But
thou coueredst my sins, and hiddest

me safe vnder the shadow of thy
wings, and I haue taken quiet, and
comfortable rest; and with ioy,
and cheerefulnesse, I behold the
day spring from on high come to visit
me. Lord let not these thy mercies,
because they are ordinary,
diminish, but rather because they
are continual, increase my thankfull
duties, and religious obsequies
vnto thee! As thou heapest
blessing vpon blessing, so still adde
grace to grace, that thy goodnesse
continued to me, may make me
continually better. And sith now
thou hast giuen mee a day more
to my life, grant that I may giue,
and consecrate it to thee, by
spending it wholly in thy seruice,
and the necessary duties of
my calling. Which that I may
more cheerefully performe, open
thy hand to fit mee with all those
good things I neede; and stretch
out thine arme to turne from me all
the euills I feare. Aboue all things
keepe mee from the vnprofitable

workes of darknesse, that my sins
turne not day into night, sith thy
goodnesse hath turned night into
day. Awake my soule from carnall
security, as thou hast my body
from sleepe, that I may stand vp
from the dead, and Christ may giue
me light, to walke honestly, vprightly
and circumspectly; as becommeth
the childe of the day. And that I
be not ashamed to walke naked
in the light, put vpon mee the
true wedding garment, and couer
me with the robes of thy sonnes
righteousnesse. And as the light of
the Sunne shineth before mee, so
grant that my light may shine before
men, that they may see my good
workes, and glorifie thee my heauenly
Father. And because thou
art the light which enlightneth euery
man that commeth into the
world, cast I beseech thee the
bright beames of thy fauour vpon
thy whole Church: Propagate
thy Gospell through the whole
world, and by the preaching of

thy Word, adde those daily to the
Church that shall be saued. Say to
the North Giue, and to the South
Restore, and speedily accomplish
the number of thine Elect, and so
Come Lord Iesu, come quickly.
More particularly I pray thee for
the prosperous, and flourishing
estate of the Churches of great
Britaine, and Ireland. Crowne
the Kings Maiesty with all royall
graces befitting his high calling.
Establish his Throne that hee may
aduance thy Kingdome. Blesse
our Queene, that she may bee a
nursing Mother to thy Spowse.
Blesse the Prince and Princesse
Palatine, and all the royall Issue,
that in their stocke the roote of
Iesse may spring vp and flourish ouer
the whole earth. Blesse the
Nobles, and Peeres of this
Realme, that they may maintaine
thine Honour, and support thy
Gospell. Blesse the Bishops, and
Ministers, that they may preserue
thy worship, and carefully feede

thy flocke. Blesse the Iudges, and
Magistrates, that they may execute
thy iudgements, and keepe thy
peace. Blesse the Captaines and
Soldiers, that they may fight thy
warres, and defend thy Church.
Finally, blesse all thy people, that
they may obey thy Gospell, and
enlarge thy Kingdome. And
giue mee grace in this my day to
learne, and follow the things that
belong to my peace; to accept the
saluation now offered vnto mee,
and bring forth fruits worthy of
amendment of life. So be it, deare
Father for the merits and Passion
of thy Sonne, by the powerfull operation
of the holy Ghost with
whose assistance I summe vp all
my requests, and tender them
vnto thee in that forme of Prayer
which thy Son hath taught
me, saying, Our Father which
art in heauen, &amp;c.

shine vpon me, and be gratious vnto
me! The Lord lift vp his countenance
vpon me, and giue mee peace.

Euening.
                     IF any man walke in the day
hee stumbleth not, because
hee seeth the light of this
world. Ioh 11. 9.
                     But if a man walke in the
night hee stumbleth, because there
is no light in him. verse 10.
                     Walke while yee haue the
light▪ least darknesse come vpon
you; for hee that walketh in
darknesse knoweth not whither
he goeth. Ioh. 12. 35.
                     
                        While ye haue the light beleeue
in the light, that yee may be the
children of the light. verse 36.
                     
                        
Worke while it is day; the
night commeth when no man
can worke. Ioh. 9. 4.
                     This is the condemnation, that
light, is come into the world, and
men loued darknesse rather then
light because their deeds were
euill Ioh. 3. 19.
                     For euery one that doeth euill
hateth the light; neither commeth to
the light least his deedes should
be reproued. verse 20.
                     He that hateth his brother is
in darknesse, and walketh in darknesse,
and knoweth not whither
he goeth, because darknesse hath
blinded his eyes. 1 Ioh. 2. 11.
                     Let not the Sunne goe downe
vpon your wrath. Ephesians 4.
26.
                     And haue no fellowship with
the vnfruitfull workes of darknes
but reproue them rather. Eph. 5.
11.
                     For it is a shame euen to speake
of those things which are done of
them in secret. verse 12.
                     
                        
Yee are all the children of
light, and the children of the
day; ye are not of the night, nor
of darknesse. 1 Thes. 5. 5.
                     Therefore sleepe not (in sinne,
and carnall security,) as doe others,
but watch. verse 6.
                     Watch yee, for yee know not
when the Master of the house
commeth, at euen, or at midnight,
or at the Cock-crowing, or in the
morning, least comming suddenly
he finde you sleeping. Mar.

                     A Prayer for the
Euening.
                     
                        GLorious Creator, eternall, infinite,
and incomprehensible
God, whose face obscureth the
Sunne, and darkeneth the Moone,
and shadoweth the Starres, and
dazeleth the eyes of the Cherubims,
to whom the light it selfe
(if it be compared) is but a darke
shadow, and the darkenesse is no
darkenesse, but the darkenesse and
light to thee are both alike, Enlighten
the darkenesse of mine vnderstanding
that I wander not in the
night of errour, and ignorance;
but continually walke, as becommeth
the childe of the day, in
the light of thy truth, and the
wayes of thy Commandements. And
though the Sunne hath withdrawne
his comfortable light
from my bodily eyes, yet let the
light of thy countenance, and the
bright beames of thy fauour still

                        shine vpon my soule in the middest
of thickest darkenesse, and the
shadow of death. Saue me ô Father
of lights from the powers of darkenesse.
Receiue me into thy gracious
tuition, and giue thine holy
Angels charge to pitch their tents
about me, that being secured on
euery side from all dangers, and
feare, I may quietly rest in thee
in whom I liue, and moue. And
whilest my bodily sences are surprized
with sleepe, keepe my
soule still awake, that I may be alwayes
readie to meete the Bridegroome
with my lampe in my hand▪
                        
Let the last trump sound shrill in
mine eares to driue away from
me the spirit of slumber, and carnall
securitie. O thou the keeper
of thine Israel, who doest neuer
slumber nor sleepe, watch ouer me
this night. Behold, into thy hands
I commend my soule and bodie,
and all things else wherewith
thou hast blessed me, being assured
that the thing cannot perish

thou vouchsafest to take into thy
custodie. Grant me I beseech
thee, safe, quiet, and comfortable
rest, voyde of cares &amp; feares,
free from distempers and diseases,
as also all dangers, dreames,
fancies, pollutions, and temptations.
And make it I pray thee
as profitable to my soule, as it is
necessarie to my bodie, that it
may not onely refresh, &amp; strengthen
my bodie to the better performance
of my daily labours
and trauels in my calling, but also
settle and quiet my soule in
the remembrance, and continuall
expectation of that sweete repose,
and blessed rest which they
enioy that die in thee. Let my
sleepe put mee in minde of my
death, my bed of my graue, my
lying downe of my buriall, my vncloathing
of putting off this tabernacle
of flesh, my rising againe of
my resurrection, my apparelling of
putting on the Lord Iesu. Like as
the night couereth and hideth all

things from the eyes of men; so
let thy mercy couer and hide my
sinnes, that they neuer come to
light, either to confound mee in
this life, or condemne me in the
life to come. Finally, as it is the
nature of sleepe to tye the outward
senses, and make fast, and
shut vp the organs of my body:
so let thy grace restraine my inward
senses, and barre vp all the
passages of my soule, that the diuell
may finde no place to enter
into me. Close vp the eyes of my
minde, that they behold not vanitie:
stop my eares that they heare
not follie, and my spirituall smell
that it let not in the sauour of
death. Set a watch before my
mouth, and seale vp the closet of
my heart, that nothing enter into
the one, or go out at the other, that
may defile me. Thus keepe me,
and guard me from my bodily
and ghostly enemies this night,
and as long as I abide in the
darke prison of my bodie; and

when thou deliuerest me out of
it by death, make me partaker of
the glorious inheritance of thy
Saints in light in the heauenly Ierusalem,
which needeth neither
Sunne, nor Moone, nor Starres to
shine in it, for the glorie of God enlighteneth
it, and the Lambe is the
light thereof. To whom with the
euerlasting Father, and most sacred
&amp; blessed Spirit be rendred
thankes, and praise now and for
euer. Amen.

                     Remember me ô Lord with the fauour
thou bearest thy people ô visite
me with thy saluation, that I may
see the felicitie of thy chosen, and reioyce
in the gladnesse of thy people,
and glorie with thine inheritance.

                     A Prayer for the Sabbath
Morning.
                     
                        BLessed Creator, and Author,
and finisher of the saluation of
man-kind; who in memorie of
thy glorious rest from both thy
noble workes hast blessed and
sanctified a day of holy rest vnto
thy selfe, sanctifie me for it, that
laying aside my accustomed businesse,
and sequestring my
thoughts from all worldly cares,
I may keepe it, and my selfe holy to
thee, by dedicating it and deuoting
my selfe wholly to thy peculiar
worship, and immediate
seruice. And to the end that this
my religious seruice may bee
more acceptable to thee, quicken
me with thy Spirit, that I may performe
it with all alacritie and
chearefulnesse, and may make
thy Sabbath my delight. Touch

my heart and tongue with a coale
from thine Altar, that from the
sweet incense of my meditations,
hymnes, prayers, and thanksgiuing
thou mayest smell a sauour of
rest. O holy Lord God of Sabbath
sanctifie thy rest vnto me, &amp; let thy
Spirit rest in me, that I may find
rest to my soule from all tentations,
troubles, and feares, and
may rest from my owne workes,
which are painefull and sinfull
trauels, and may employ this day
all the powers and faculties of
my soule and bodie in doing and
considering thy workes, in adoring
thy Maiestie, and admiring
thy wisdome, and acknowledgeing
thy power, and embracing
thy loue, and magnifying thy
goodnesse, and reioycing in thy
mercies, &amp; trembling at thy iudgements:
In visiting thy holy Temple,
and praising thee with thy
Saints, and offering vp the calues
of my lips: In diligently reading
thy Scriptures, attentiuely hearing

thy word, reuerently celebrating
thy mysteries, charitably relieuing
thy members, and zealously practising
all holy duties both publike
and priuate. O let me this
whole day walke with thee as Enoch
did, and talke with thee as
Moses did, and seeke thy face as
Dauid did: And grant that beholding
thine image in thine holy
word, as in a cleare and cristall
mirrour I may bee changed into
the same image euen from glorie to
glorie. Let this Sabbath put mee
in mind of thy rest from thy
workes, and assure me thereby
of an euerlasting Sabbath in heauen
from my works. Into which
rest that I may enter, stirre vp my
good desires in me; raise my
thoughts and affections to the
things that are ab
                              •
                           ue. Renew mee
according to the Image of thy
Sonne, and frame my life to a
heauenly conuersation. Enlighten
my vnderstanding, sanctifie my
will, moderate my desires, gouerne

my affections, mortifie my
fleshly members, and destroy the
man of sinne in me, and deliuer me
from this bodie of death. Worke in
me a feare of thy power, and loue
of thy goodnes, and zeale of thy
glorie, and thirst of thy grace, &amp;
an earnest desire, and constant
resolution as (much as in me lyeth)
to approue my selfe to thee
in all things, and frame all my
actions to the rule of thy word.
Heare me I beseech thee for my
selfe and for thy Church, and thy
Church for me, and Christ for vs
all, &amp;c. saying: Righteous Father
keepe them from euill, sanctifie
them with thy truth, thy word
is truth.

me, giue them, that they may bee
one, as thou and I are one. So bee
it, heauenly Father for thy Sonn's
sake, by the grace of thy holy

Spirit: To whom be all honour,
praise, glorie, and thanksgiuing

Euening.
                     REturne to thy rest O my
soule, for the Lord hath
dealt graciously with thee.
Psal. 116. 7.
                     
                     In Gods Word will I reioyce;
in the Lords Word will I comfort
me. Psal. 56. 10.
                     
                     The words of the Lord are
pure words, like as siluer which
from the earth is tryed, and purified
seauen times in the fire.
                     Blessed are they that dwell in
thine house, they will bee alway
praysing thee.
                     They will goe from strength
to strength, and to the God of

                        Gods appeareth euery one of
them in Sion. Psal. 84. 47.
                     
                     I will giue thankes to the
Lord in the Congregation from
the ground of the heart. Psal. 68

                     Vnto thee ô God I will pay
my vowes, vnto thee will I giue
thanks. Psal. 56. 12.
                     
                     Shew the light of thy countenance
vpon thy seruant, and

                     An Euening Prayer for
the Sabbath.
                     
                        HOly, holy, holy Lord God
Almighty which was, which
art, and which art to come,
hallow my nature, that I may hallow
thy Name. As thou impartest
thy goodnes to me whereby I liue
and moue in thee: so I beseech
thee communicate to mee some
measure of thy holinesse, that I
may liue and moue to thee. Let
thy Spirit of grace possesse my
body and soule, that the desires
of my minde, and thoughts of my
heart, and words of my lipps, may
be holinesse vnto thee. Sanctifie me
that I may glorifie thee. And first
with ioy and thankfulnesse I acknowledge
it a special testimony
of thy loue, that thou hast giuen
me liberty and meanes to keepe a
holy Sabbath vnto thee, to meete
in thy House, to offer vp my
ioynt-prayers and thanks-giuing

with thy holy congregation, to
confesse my sinnes, to professe
my faith, to lay open my wants,
to cheere vp my selfe by singing
the sweete songs of Sion, to heare
thy sacred Word read and Preached;
whereby my faith hath
beene strengthened in the misteries
of saluation, my hope established
in the promises of thy
Gospell, and my life set forward
in a setled course of holinesse and
righteousnesse, whereby the
Kingdome of sinne and Satan
is beate down and destroyed, and
the Kingdome of Christ built vp
in me, By this thy Word, the
carelesse sinner is admonished,
the ignorant instructed, the presumptuous
terrified, and the penitent
comforted, the power of
sinne is abated, the force of
temptations weakned, the motions
of the spirit quickned,
grace reuined, and my Election
assured by these insallible Marks,
and tokens thereof set before me

in holy Scriptures. Blessed bee
thy Name for it, this day thy
Word hath dwelt with me richly
in all wisedome. The dispenser of
thy misteries hath scattered many
Doctrines like so many pearles
among thy people.Here thou mayest insert the principale Doctrine which thou hast heard from thy Pastors mouth. 
                        Lord grant
that with Mary I keepe these, and
all thy sayings in my heart, and
make vse of them in my life, and
receiue comfort from them at
my death. And here I would
proceed to intreate at thy hands
the continuance and increase of
thy spiritual and temporall blessings
vpon mee, but my sinnes
lye at the doore of my conscience
and affright mee. My heart
smites mee for my failings in the
performance of the duties of thy
Sabbath. My deuout Meditations
haue bin stefled in the wombe
that bare them: my prayers haue
not beene without distractions,
my hearing without wearisomenesse,
nor my almes-deeds without
grudging. Pardon deare Father

my want of preparation before
I come to thine house, of intention
and Zeale at thy seruice,
and want of Meditation and Application
of those things which I
heard there since I came thence.
Bury I beseech thee these slips
and all other my sins, especially
of this weeke and day, in the night
of eternall obliuion. Ease me of
the burden of them, that I may
more securely repose my body
and soule vpon thy gracious protection,
to take their naturall refreshing
by sleepe, whereby I may
bee enabled and strengthened
to doe thee better seruice
the next day in walking carefully,
diligently, conscionably, and
constantly in the waies of thy commandements,
and the duties of my
calling.
                  
                  
                     
                     The close out of Scripture.
                     Now the very God of peace sanctify
mee throughout, and I pray
God that my whole spirit and soule,
and body, may bee kept blamelesse
vnto the comming of the Lord Iesus
Christ, Amen.

                  TO
THE RIGHT
HONOVRABLE
and Religious Ladie
the Countesse of
DENBIGH.
                  
                     May it please your Honour:
                  
                  
                     YOur conference
with me, about
my conference
with the Iesuites,
and your
gracious acceptation of the relation
and defence thereof, left
in me such an impression of the
Character of your Noble and

Religious disposition, that I euer
since desired the aduantage
of some good opportunitie to testifie
my dutifull respect to your
Honour. The truth of God receiueth
not onely support, but
great honour from the patronage
and countenance of great
Personages; and she much glorieth
in finding so strong a
Champion, euen in the weaker
sexe. Albeit the Sun-beames
are alwayes most bright in
themselues, yet they neuer appeare
so glorious to vs as when
they fall vpon crystall glasse,
or pretious stones: In like sort
Religion and vertue (the raies
of diuine light in the soule) although
they shine alwayes
brightly in themselues, yet
they neuer seeme so conspicuous
and resplendent, as when they
receiue some luster from the

subiect; when Nobilitie of birth
and minde concurre; when ornaments
of bodie and soule
meete; when eminencie of grace
&amp; eminency of conditions toyne
in one, and reflect mutually each
on the other. And verily if your
more then or dinarie fauour and
respect to the Ministers of the
Gospell, and to my selfe in particular,
had not made this my
voluntarie oblation a necessarie
obligation to your Ladiship;
yet your constancie in the
truth, and loue to Sion and her
solemne and sacred assemblies,
might iustly challenge to your
Honour the Dedication of this
part of my HAND-MAIDES
Taske, which is to furnish Christian
fastes and feasts with proper
MEDITATIONS, HYMNES
and PRAYERS. As our bodie
liues to the soule, by which it

liueth; so our soule should liue to
God by whom it liueth. And
no otherwise is the life of the
bodie preserued by heate and
moisture, then the life of the
soule is maintained and kept by
the heate of diuine loue, and radicall
moisture of teares bedewing
the heart roote of a true penitent.
To kindle the one and
feede the other, I Dedicate and
deuote the DEVOTION of
this part of my HAND-MAIDE
to your Honour. For the feasts
representing to your Religious
thoughts what Christ hath
done for you, will (through the
blasts of Gods Spirit) inflame
the heate of heauenly loue in
you: and the fasts admonishing
you what Christ hath suffered
for you, must needs yeeld aboundant
matter to supply the
springs of godly sorrow. In heauen

ioy taketh vp all times and
parts; in hell sorrow; on earth
they diuide. In heauen there is
ioy without sorrow; in hell, sorrow
without ioy; on earth sorrow
and ioy act their parts;
fasts and feasts haue their courses;
mirth and mourning their
turnes; and at euerie turne my
HAND-MAIDE is readie to
attend you, either with sackcloth
for the one, or the wedding
garment for the other. S.
Bernard taking his ground
from those words of the Prophet
Ioel, Rent your hearts &amp;c. and
returne to the Lord with your
whole heart; thus pleasantly
descanteth therupon:Non est ad Deum to
                           •
                        o corde redite, nisiscisso corde. We cannot
returne vnto the Lord
with our whole heart vnlesse
it be broken first with true contrition.
There is no whole
heart, but a rent heart; no

sound heart, but a broken; &amp; S.
Ierome according in the same
note, summeth vp the whole
practice of a deuoute soule in
her priuate carriage with God
in these wordsDolet, &amp; de dolore gaudet. She sorroweth
after a godly manner, and reioyceth
for that sorrow. Godly
sorrow for sinne, and holy ioy
for that sorrow, is the whole
Deuoute man. Madame, if my
Meditations vpon the fasting,
suffering, and death of our Sauiour
make you sad and sorrowfull,
remember out of S. Ierome
that you ought to be ioyfull
for such sorrow. If the piercing
Texts of holy Seripture in
the ADMONITIONS and
HYMNES appointed for the
Christian fasts, diuide betweene
your soule and spirit, and bruse
if not breake your heart with an
holy sympathy, remember out of

                     S. Bernard, that There is no
returning to God with a
whole heart, but by breaking
it. And if you find in the whole
Deuotion of Fasts, matter of
pensiuenesse and griefe; in the
Christian feasts, you shall haue
store of oyle to make you a cheerfull
countenance, and reuiue
your deaded thoughts. The
heart of a man is in continuall
motion; it alwayes either dilateth
it selfe, or contracteth: and
the hidden man of the heart in
like manner hath his Systole
and Diastole, (as the Anatomists
speake:) his heart continually
either enlargeth it selfe
by ioy, or contracteth it selfe by
sorrow. And no doubt, when
God bespeakes our hearts for
himselfe, he especially expects
and respects these motions
thereof and affections producing

them. He will haue vs
ioy in him, and sorrow and
long after him. Ioy in his fauour,
and sorrow in his displeasure.
Ioy in his promise, and
sorrow at his threates. Ioy in
the holy Ghost, and sorrow in
our owne spirits. Feast to him
in a thankefull profession of his
gracious goodnesse, and fast to
him in an humble confession of
sinfull wickednesse. Like the
Heliotropium, turne alwayes
to the Sunne; open when he
sheddeth abroade his beames,
and shut when he draweth
them in: Inlarge our hearts
with ioy at his gracious presence,
and sorrowfully shut and
contract them when he is, or
seemeth to be absent from vs.
Thus if our ioy be the interpreter
of our loue to him, and our
sorrow of our desire of him; if

our ioy be holy, and our sorrow
holy; if our feasts be feasts of
Deuotion, and our fasts be
fasts of contrition, our gracious
Redeemer will vouchsafe to
be present at both: he will
feast and fast with vs. At our
fasts he will weepe for our spirituall,
as he did for Lazarus his
corporall death. At our feasts he
will turne our water into wine,
and rauish our soules with heauenly
melodie. Our feasts shall
be as temperate and holy as
fasts, and our fasts as comfortable
as feasts. A good conscience
shall be vnto vs a continuall
feast here, and the Marriage
supper of the Lamb an euerlasting
feast hereafter. To both
which feasts, God by his Spirit,
which biddeth you, bring you for
his sake, who by his fasts and
sorrowes on earth hath purchased

for vs euerlasting feasts
and ioyes in heauen; In whom
I rest,
                  
                     Your Honour's

                     The Prayer.
                     GRatious Lord Iesus Christ
the Sonne of God and Sauiour
of man, the ioy of Angels,
and dread of diuels, the
Iewes Messiah, the Gentiles
starre, the hope of the liuing, and
resurrection of the dead, the way to
all that come vnto thee, the truth
to all them that know thee, and
the life to all them that belieue in
thee: Make good all thy glorious
&amp; gratious titles to me. Lord protect
me, Iesu saue me, Christ my
anointed King rule me, my anointed
Priest sanctifie me, my anointed
Prophet reueale vnto mee the
secrets of thy Kingdome. O Christ
whose name is an oyntment powred
out, annoint me with the oyle of
gladnesse, this day aboue others.
This is the day which the Lord hath
made, I wil reioyce and be glad in it;
nay I dare take the note higher,
This is the day in which the Lord
                        
was made, I will exult and triumph
in it. Thou which madest
all dayes, wert this day made of a
woman, and made vnder the Law.
From all eternity it was neuer
heard, that eternity entred into
the Kalender of time, supreame
Maiesty descended into the
wombe; immensity was comprehended;
infinity bounded; vbiquity
inclosed, and the Deity incarnated:
Yet this day it was seene;
for this day the Word became
flesh; God became man, and to
effect this wonderfull mystery, a
Virgin became a Mother. One
deepe calleth vpon another; one
miracle begetteth another: The
Sunne bringeth forth all other
dayes, but this day brought thee
forth the Sonne of righteousnesse.
If wee set our voices, and instruments,
and heart-strings to the
highest straine of ioy at the birth
of great Kings and Princes; What
ought I to doe this day, on which
thou the king of heauen wast born

vpon the earth. At the mariage
of great Personages, men giue
full scope to all manner of expressions
of carnall ioy euen oftentimes
to the very surfeit of the
senses with pleasure: How then
should I bee rauished with spirituall
ioy at this time when heauen
and earth, the diuine nature
and humane were married? The
contract was in heauen before all
times, but the marriage was this
day consummated in the vndefiled
bedde of the Virgin. Lord
who this day cammest downe to
me, draw me vp to thee, and
giue me accesse with more confidence
and bouldnesse; for now
thou art become my brother and
ally by bloud. The rayes of thy
diuine Maiesty will not dazle the
eyes of my soule, they being now
vailed with thy flesh. This day
thou diddest vnite thy selfe to
me naturally, and substantially
and becamest truly flesh of my
flesh, and bone of my bone. Vnite

me to thee this day spiritually,
and make me a true member of
thy mysticall body, that I may bee
flesh of thy flesh, and bone of thy bone.
Lord thou diddest this day participate
of my humane nature,
make me this day participate by
grace of thy diuine, as farre as I
am capable thereof; and impart
and communicate vnto mee the
merrit of all thy actions, and benefit
of all thy sufferings in this
thy nature. O my Lord &amp; my God
who by assuming flesh vnto thy
diuine person, hast sanctified it,
and highly aduanced it farre aboue
all creatures, keepe me from defiling
my flesh with sinfull
pollutions, or abasing and inthralling
it to Satan. O Sonne of
God, who by thy incarnate nature,
becamest the Sonne of
Man, make me the sinfull sonne
of man, by grace and adoption to
become the Sonne of God. And
as thou this day according to the
words of thine Angel wert borne

to me, bee borne also in mee that
from hence forth I liue not, but
thou in me. Let thy spirit quicken
me, thy flesh nourish me, thy wisdome
guide me, thy grace sanctifie
me, and thy Word instruct me.
Let the holy Ghost of whom thou
wast conceiued beget thee in mee,
by the immortall seede of thy
Word. Let my faith conceiue
thee, my profession bring thee
forth, my loue embrace thee, and
Deuotion entertaine and continually
keepe thee with mee till thy
second comming. So come vnto me
Lord Iesus, come quickly.

                     The Prayer for New-yeeres day.
                     MOst tender and compassionate
Lord, now first
knowne by thy name Iesu,
who being the true vine which
yeeldest the wine that gladdeth
the heart, wast pruned this day
with the sharpe knife of circumcision,
and bleddest for me; haue pitty
and compassion on mee, who
with weeping eyes and a bleeding
heart come vnto thee, beseeching
thee that those drops of
blood which fell from thee this
day may satisfie for the sinne of
my birth, and the whole streame
that ranne from all the parts of
thy body in the Garden, and on
the Crosse may expiate all my
numberlesse actuall sinnes; whether
they be sinnes of lighter tincture,
or of a Scarlet dye: Sinnes
like beames or sinnes like moates:
Sinnes conceiued in the heart
onely, or sinnes brought forth
into act: Sinnes in my beliefe, or

                        sinnes in my life: Sinnes once committed,
or often repeated: Sinnes
before, or after my calling: Sinnes
of impiety against thee, or sinnes
of iniquity against my neighbour,
or sins of impurity against mine
owne flesh: for of all these I
haue a great loade. They are more
in number then the haires of my
head, they are a burden too heauy
for me to beare. They lie vpon my
conscience like so many Talents
of lead, and would presse mee
downe to hell, did not thy mercy
take hold of the hand of my faith
to support me in hope euen aboue
hope. How should I hope if I
thinke vpon thy greatnesse?
How should I not hope if I think
vpon thy goodnesse? How
should I hope if I weigh my sinnes?
How should I not hope, if I
weigh thy merits? How should
I hope, if I consider my actions?
How should I not hope, if I consider
thy passions? How should I
hope if I number my transgressions?
                        
How should I not hope, if I
number thy blessings and fauours
towards mee? How
should I hope if I remember
how oft I haue refused grace
after it hath bin offered to
mee? How can I but hope if I
remember how oft grace hath
bin offered mee after I refused
it? And still hope I wil,
as long as thou reteinest thy
name Iesu, which this day thou
receiuedst when thou offeredst the
first fruits of thy blood for my sin,
without which thou couldest
not haue bin my Iesus. For so
fowle and festered were my
soares, that nothing could heale
them but a bloody knife. But why
should this bloody instrument be
applyed to thy purest, tenderest,
immaculate flesh made all of Virgins
blood? There was no superfluity
to be pared off in thee; no
ranke▪ blood to bee let out. The
superfluous skinne was on me,
yet the knife is on thee: The festered

sores were in my body, yet
the Launce is in thy flesh. Thou
hast the paine, I the ease; thou
the smart, I the cure. O wonderfull
cure! O more wonderfull
loue! Out of the mouth of babes
and sucklings as thou hast ordained,
so maist thou iustly chalenge
praise, who in thy infancy madest
such an assay of my redemption,
and tendered the earnest of thy
blood for me. Not nine dayes
old thou sheddest dropps of
blood for me, farre more precious
then so many drops of the richest
balsamom to cure my wounds.
Let all flesh praise thee who healedst
it by thy wounds. Eternall
thankes be giuen to thee for thy
circumcision, whereby thou hast
abolished circumcision it selfe, and
prouided mee an easier remedy
of originall sinne the sacred lauer
of regeneration. Water now serueth
insteede of blood, and a
gentle rubbing of the flesh for
cutting and wounding it. By the

                        circumcision of thy flesh thou hast
also merited for me the fulfilling
of thy fathers promise and condition
of his couenant to circumcise
the foreskinne of our hearts. By
this thy razor thou hast fitted
the tables of my heart: now
write thy lawes &amp; loue in them:
By receiuing this seale of the couenant
in thy flesh thou hast sealed
to me thy care of mee in thy
nonage. First ô Lord I am euerlastingly
to praise thee for taking
my flesh vp on thee; and next for
leauing part of it with mee as a
pledg of thy loue, thou bearedst for
me from thy mothers wombe. In
thy infancy thou bleddest for me;
in thy twelfth yere, thou arguedst
for me, in thy youth thou obeyedst
for me, and in thy ripe &amp; perfect
age thou sufferedst and dyedst for
me. To thee therefore as it is my
bounden duty I offer the budds
of my childe-hood, the blossoms
of my youth, and the fruits of my
age. As thou betimes didst set to

the worke of my redemption, and
and on those termes acceptedst
the name Iesus: so let me betimes
giue my name to thee, and enter
into thy seruice: Let mee beare
thy yoke euen from my youth.
Lord, who this day wert circumcised
in the flesh, circumcise me
in the heart, that I may in purity,
sincerity, and vprightnesse of heart
walke before thee all the dayes of
my life. Neither circumcise my
heart onely but my eares, eyes,
hands, heart, and feete, that no
superfluity of maliciousnesse nor
impurity remaine in me.
                     Now thou hast renewed the
face of the earth, renew this day
and repaire thy decaied Image in
me. Thou hast begunne a new
yeere, beginne in me a new reformation.
Make me I beseech thee
a cleane heart, and renew a right
spirit within me. The yeere like the
serpent hath cast off his old
skinne, and put on a new; let mee
also cast off my old man, and put

on the new man; and from this
day to my old age and death
walke in newnesse of life, that I may
be a fit guest to be admitted into
the new heauen, where dwelleth
righteousnesse, and to be entertained
at thy table, and drinke new
wine with thee in thy heauenly
Kingdome for euermore Amen.

                     A Prayer for Twelfe-day.
                     
                        FAther of lights, who didst
guide the heathen Sages by
a starre to seeke after, and
find thy sonne, the true light which
enlighteneth euery man that commeth
into the world; giue mee
grace to giue eare to the more sure
Word of Prophecie in the Scriptures
til the day dawne, and the day
starre arise in my heart. As thou
calledst the wise men obseruers
of the starres by a star, the sheepheards
lying abroad by an apparition
in the fields, Zachary the
Priest by a Vision in the Temple,
Peter the fisher by a draught of
fishes, Mathew the Publican at the
receipt of custome, and Saint Austin
enamourd with eloquence by
the lustre of Saint Ambroses stile
and enticing eloquence. I beseech
thee take the aduantage of
such seasons, and apply such
meanes for my vnfeigned conuersion
vnto thee as are most agreeable

to my inclination, disposition,
and condition. So will I come
vnto thee and fall downe before
thee, and present vnto thee gold,
frankinsence and mirrh; gold in
acknowledgement of thy kingdome,
frankinsence of thy Priesthood;
and mirrh of thy death. I will
offer willingly &amp; freely vnto thee
incense of praise &amp; thanksgiuing for
thy benefits; the mirrh of bitter
teares for▪ my sinnes; and gold (according
to my ability) for the
maintenance of thy seruice, and
adorning thy Temple. Lord who
by this rich present prouidedst for
the virgins wants to supply them
in her iourney to Aegypt, extend
thy goodnesse to mee in al necessities;
and establish my faith
and confidence in thee in al dangers
and difficulties whatsoeuer,
For thou hast promised neuer to
leaue nor forsake them that trust in
thee. The stony rocke shall yeeld
a fountaine of water; and a dry
cr
                              •
                           re a spring of oyle: the loaues
                        
shall multiply by spending; nay,
the Clouds shall be Store-houses
of Bread, and the winde serue in
Fowle, and the Rauens bring in
prouision; the Fishes pay tribute
of money, and Heathen Sages
from the East, (by the conduct of
a Starre) bring in costly presents
and New yeeres-gifts before thy
children shall want their necessary
maintenance or sustenance.
                     Blessed Babe, who at thy birth
didst presage thy death, and assayedst
the Crosse in thy Cratch,
and being excluded (as it were)
from all men, wast constrained
to take vp thy lodging with
beasts in a Stable, teach me what
I am to looke for in this world:
If it giue me course, and base, and
beastly entertainment, it gaue
thee worse; and the seruant is
not to expect better respect then
the Master. O King of glory, who
hadst no Palace in this world,
but an Inne; no Chamber of
Presence, but a Stable; no Tapestry,

but Straw; no Chaire of
estate, but a Cratch; no Scepter,
but a Reede; and no Crowne, but
a wreath of thornes; worke in me
an holy high-mindednesse to despise
this world which so despised
thee. Make the worldly greatnesse
seeme small, honour base,
estimation vile, and pompe vaine
vnto me. Let not the glittering
shew of gold, siluer, or precious
stones, or the luster of eminent
conditions dazell the eyes of my
minde, but let the beames of this
starre, light and guide me rather
to honour thee in a Stable, then
leaue thee to follow Herod in his
Palace vpon any hopes whatsoeuer.
The wise men, after they
had seene thee, neuer returned
backe to Herod, but went another
way to their owne home: so let me,
after thou hast called me to the
knowledge of the truth, and redeemed
mee from my vaine conuersations,
neuer returne backe to my
worldly courses, but take another
                        
way to my true home in heauen.
The wise men when they saw thy
starre in the aire were exceeding
glad; I see thy starre in the Scriptures,
nay I see the bright morning
starre in my heart; O let my ioy
exceede theirs as my knowledge
doth. The starre still lighted
them till they came to the place
where thou layest, and entered
into thy bed-chamber: So ô Lord
let the light of faith guide me all
the way of this life euen till I
come to see thee, not in a stable on
earth strawed with litter and
dung, but in a pallace in heauen
built with Saphyrs, and founded
vpon pearles; not receiuing a present
of gold from men, but wearing
a crowne of gold put vpon
thee by thy Father; not hauing a
quantity of frankinsence or mirrh
in thy hand, but a golden censor
full of sweete odours which are the
prayers of Saints. Among which
I beseech thee offer vp the prayers
of mee a sinner, that I may bee

a Saint after thou hast purged
mee from all my fil thynesse
in the royall
bath of thy blood
Amen.

                     An Hymne for Easter day.
                     OPen mee the gates of
righteousnesse, that I
may goe into them, and
giue thankes vnto the Lord.
Psal. 119. 19.
                     
                     This is the gate of the Lord;
the righteous shall enter into it.
verse 20.
                     
                     I will thanke thee, for thou
hast heard me, and art become
my saluation. verse 21.
                     
                     Thou wilt shew me the paths
of life, in thy presence is the
fulnesse of ioy: and at thy right
hand there are pleasures for euermore.
Psal. 16. 11.
                     
                     The same stone which the
builders refused, is become the
head Stone in the corner. v. 22
                     
                     This is the Lord's doing, and
it is maruellous in our eyes. v. 23
                     
                     
                        
This is the day which the
Lord hath made; wee will reioyce
and be glad in it. ver. 24.
                     
                     Why doe the heathen rage
continually, and the people imagin
a vaine thing. Psal. 2. 1.
                     
                     Then shall hee speake vnto
them in his wrath, and vexe
them in his sore displeasure saying,
                     Euen I haue set my king vpon
Zion mine holy Mountaine.
verse 5. 6.
                     
                     The Lord vpon thy right
hand shall wound euen kings in
the day of his wrath. Ps. 110. 5.
                     
                     Hee shall iudge among the
heathen; hee shall fill their places
with the dead bodies, and
smite in sunder heads ouer diuers
countries. verse 6.
                     
                     He shall drinke of the brooke
in the way, therefore shall hee
lift vp his head. verse 7:
                     
                     
                        
Be wise now therefore ô yee
kings; bee learned yee that are
iudges of the earth. Ps. 2. 10.
                     
                     Serue the Lord with feare;
and reioyce vnto him with reuerence.
verse 11.
                     
                     Kisse the sonne least hee bee
angry, and so ye perish from the
right way: if his wrath bee
kindled, yea but a little, blessed
are all they that put their trust
in him. verse 12.

                     A Prayer for Easter-day.
                     GLorious Sonne of righteousnesse
who this morning
didst preuent the
dawning of the day, by
sending forth the beames of
thy glorified body out of the
pit
                           •
                         of darknesse and A shadow
of death, shine vpon my soule
by the light of thy grace.
Inlighten my darke apprehension
of the misteries of

thy resurrection: Inflame my
cold affections and reuiue my
heart euen deaded with pensiue
thoughts vpon thy bitter passion.
O how did the surest ground
of faith shake the fastest Anker
of hope, loosen' at the
earthquake at thy death? what
smiting together of knees,
what wringing of hands, what
knocking of brests, what fainting
of hearts, what hanging
downe of heads, were
there at giuing vp of the Ghost
when thy head hung downe on
the Crosse? with thee the faith,
with thee the hope, with thee the
ioy, with thee the life of thy dearest
Disciples expired. What
should or could the prisoners of
death euer expect, when they saw
him, whom they thought to haue
bin their redeemer, the Lord of
life arrested by death, and kept
close prisoner in the graue so
long? O death how sharpe was
then thy sting? O graue how

fearefull was thy seeming victory?
But blessed bee the angell
which remoued the stone, and
thereby made way that the stone
which the builders refused might
be preferred to bee the head stone
in the corner. Blessed be the right
hand of thy Father, who in raising
thee out of the graue, raised
our hope out of the dust. For
where is our hope? Our hope is euen
in thee ô Christ, and thy resurrection.
Thou art the life and
the resurrection of all that belieue
in thee. Death (like a Hornet) by
stinging thee hath lost his sting,
and now may make a buzzing
noise to affright me; but can
thrust out no sting to hurt mee.
The graue by thy lying in it is
turned to a bedde, and a withdrawing
roome to retire my selfe
a while, to put off this ragged
flesh, and attire my selfe with
robes of glory. Now I dare insult
ouer death and hell, since thy
triumph ouer them. O death

where is thy sting? O graue where
is thy victory? O my soule where
is all thy comfort? If in this life,
thou art most miserable; if thy life
bee hid with Christ in God, then
when Christ which is thy life shall
appeare, thou shalt also appeare in
glory. What though I mourne
here? I shall be comforted. What
though I fast here? I shall bee
satisfied. What though I am
disgraced here? I shall bee glorified.
What though I am here
trampled vnder feete? I shall
there be crowned. What though
my flesh be eaten with wormes, and
these wormes turned into dust,
and that dust blowed by the
winde ouer the face of the earth?
Yet after thou turnedst man to destruction;
againe thou sayest: Come
againe yee children of men, I know
thou my Redeemer liuest, and shall
stand vp at the last day, and I shall
see them in my flesh with these eyes,
and no other. Lord establish this
beliefe in me: beate downe all

the forts that naturall reason reareth
against it. Grant that I may
euery day more and more feele
as the power of thy birth in my
regeneration, and of thy death
in my mortification; so also of
thy resurrection in my rising
from the death of sinne to the
life of Grace. Lord thou restoredst
life to three men: to one
in his bed, to another on the
beare, to the third in the graue.
They who conceiue sinne in
their hearts, are like him that
was dead in his bed; they who
bring it forth into action, are like
him that was brought forth dead
on his beare; but they that continue
in sinne and all impurity
and putrifie in the custome
thereof, are like him that was
foure dayes dead and stanke in
the graue. Such a one, or
worse am I; for I haue layen
not foure dayes, but scores
of yeeres in this loathsome
graue, and am euen deuoured

of the worme of conscience.
Yet Lord this day of thy glorious
resurrection, say vnto mee
as thou didst to him, Come
forth, awake thou that sleepest,
and stand vp from the dead, and I
will giue thee light. Make this
day of thy resurrection from the
death of nature, the day of my
rising from the death of sinne
and corruption first to the life of
grace, and after to the life of glory
Amen.

DAIE.
                     Wee
ought to
set our
affections
on
things
aboue;

                           1 Because there is the
source of our Soule
which is of a heauenly
and diuine nature.
                           2 Because there is our
Head.
                           3 Because there is the
nobler &amp; better part
of our bodie.
                           4 Because there is our
abiding Citie.
                           5 Because there is our
mansion house.
                           6 Because there is our
hope &amp; inheritance.
                           7 Because there are no
true ioyes nor durable
riches but there.

Image, Gen. 1. 27.

                        God formed him of the dust
of the earth,1 The source of our soules created according to God's Image. and breathed into
his nostrils the breath of life, Gen.
                     
                     
                        
Then shall the dust returne to
the earth as it was. Eccles. 12.

which corrected vs; shall we not

that are aboue, and not on things
on the earth. ver. 3.

                     The Prayer for Ascension Day.
                     
                        GLorious and gratious Redeemer,
Lord Iesus Christ,
who humbledst thy selfe, &amp;
didst become obedient to death, euen
the death of the Crosse, and therefore
thy Father highly exalted thee
aboue the graue in the resurrection,
aboue the earth in thy Ascention,
aboue the heauens in thy
session at his right hand, and then
he gaue thee a name aboue al names
that at the name of Iaesus euery knee
shall bow, both of things in heauen,
and in earth, and of things vnder
the earth. I humbly bow the
knees not onely of my body, but
of my heart and soule vnto thee.
I neuer heare of thee, or remember;

neuer thinke, or speake of
thee but with greatest reuerence,
and loue that heart can conceiue,
or tongue expresse. I admire the
mystery of thine incarnation; I
tremble at the horror of thy passion;
I adore the power of thy
resurrection; and I triumph in
the glory of thine Ascension.
My God and my Lord make me
wholly thine as thou art mine.
Thy birth was my life; thy life
my merit; thy death my ransome;
thy resurrection my deliuery out
of the prison of death (when thy
father layed thee vp for my debt)
thy Ascension my assurance and
takingp ossessiō of an incorruptible
and vndefiled inheritance reserued
in the heauens. O Sauiour if thou
haddest not been born, I had neuer
been borne anew, if thou hadst
not dyed for my sins I had dyed in
my sins: If thou hadst not risen from
the dead, my soule might haue bin
with thee in Paradice, but my body
should not haue rested in hope,
                        
neither should I haue euer seene
God in my flesh: if thou hadst
not ascended I might haue bin
freed from hell, but I should neuer
haue had a place prepared for
mee in heauen. O Lord when
thou camest to vs on earth, Iohn
was thy forerunner, but thou wert
my forerunner in thy returne
into heauen. Iohn prepared the
way before thee on earth: but thou
preparedst away before me into
heauen. That way &amp; those regions
in the aire which Lucifer defiled
&amp; cursed by his fall through
them from heauen thou hast clensed
and blessed by the marching
tryumphantly through them into
heauen. O blessed Creator and
repairer of nature, in thee not
onely all the kindreds of the earth,
but all creatures vnder the cope
of heauen are blessed, and therefore
they sigh and grone together
with vs; desiring feruently thy
second comming. The earth was
blessed and sanctified by thy
birth, and thy treading vpon it;

The water, by thy descending
into the riuer Iordan at thy baptisme,
and walking on the Seas.
Now the ayre, likewise, and fire
expected an honour and a blessing
from thee, and both receiued
it: the ayre by thy ascending
through it; the fire by sending
downe the Holy Ghost in the likenesse
of fierie Clouen Tonguer.
O Lord my Redeemer, how excellent
is thy Name in all the world!
                     
                     Creatures without voice praise
thee, as the heauens and earth:
without vnderstanding knowe
thee, as the starre that lighted
the Sages to thee: without will
obey thee, as winds and Seas: without
eares hearken to thee, as the
figtree which thou cursedst, and
it withered: without naturall affection
bemoan thee, as the stones
that claue, the vale that rent,
the earth that quaked at thy passion:
without will voluntarily
offer thee seruice, the Foale to
beare thee, the Doue to manifest

thee, the Fish to discharge thee,
the Sunne to hide thine ignominy
among men, and here the cloude
to vaile thee from mortall eye,
and transport thee into heauen.
O Lord my Redeemer how excellent
is thy name in al the world, who makest
the light thy garment, the Angell
thy messenger, the aire thy
race, the cloudes thy charriot, and
flyest vpon the wings of the winde
into heauen? Thou art ascended
vpon high, thou hast led captiuity
captiue. In thy Passion thou wast
Death's death, &amp; killedst it. In thy
buriall thou wast the Graue's
graue and destroyedst destruction;
                        Victoriā vicisti.
and now in thy Ascension thou
conquerdst conquest it selfe, and
ledst captiuity captiue, and receiuedst
gifts for men, for the whole
Church and euery Belieuer. O
Lord bestow these gifts liberally
vpon me, that I may grow in
grace, and the knowledge and loue
of thee. This day thou liftedst vp
thy body from the earth; lift vp

my heart from it. This day thou
transportedst thy body to heauen;
transport my desires thither.
This day thou setledst thy
selfe in thy Throne at the right
hand of thy Father, fixe my
thoughts, and settle mine affections
on thee in heauen, and on
heauen for thee. Amen.

                        INcomprehēsible Spirit the third
Person in the blessed and glorious
Trinity, who after the
Father had manifested himselfe to
the world in the works of Creation,
and the Sonne in the works
of Redemption, finished in the
flesh: diddest manifest thy selfe on
this day in a wonderfull manner
by the sound of a rushing winde, and
the light of fiery tongues. Manifest
thy selfe most powerfully and
gloriously in the vniuerfall
Church, by enlarging her
bounds, and making vp her
breaches and hallowing her
Assemblies, and furnishing her

Pastors, and knitting the hearts of
all her members in true loue the
bond of perfection. Perfect the
work of sanctification in all thine
Elect; manifest thy selfe also
graciously this day, and declare
thy gifts in the tongues
of the Preachers, and eares
of the hearers, and the hearts
of all the Congregation. Direct
the mouthes of the Preachers,
that they may skilfully
sowe the Seede, and open
the eares, and mollify the hearts
of the hearers, that they may receiue
it profitably, and bring forth
the fruits of the Spirit abundantly,
which are loue, ioy, peace, long suffering,
gentlenesse, goodnesse, faith,
meeknesse, temperance, &amp;c. O Eternall
and infinite holy Ghost, the
loue of the Father and the Sonne,
who diddest descend vpon our
Sauiour in the likenesse of a Doue
without gall, purge out of my
conscience all gall of malice and
bitternesse, and grant that with

                        meeknesse I may receiue the ingraffed
Word which is able to saue my
soule. O holyest Spirit, eternall
breath of the Father and the
Son, and former of the Word in
the wombe, who camest with a
sound, come down vpon me in the
sound of thy Word Preached;
though not in the extraordinary
gifts of Prophecy, tongues, and healing,
yet in the ordinary graces of
faith, hope, and charity, the Spirit
of supplication and Prayer, of
wisedome and spirituall vnderstanding,
of power and ghostly comfort.
O heauenly Spirit proceeding
from the Father and the
Sonne, who descendedst from
heauen like a mighty rushing
winde, throw mee downe to the
ground in humility, and prostrate
my heart and soule before thee:
Beate downe all strong holds of carnall
imaginations and worldly
thoughts resisting thy grace.
Chase away all cloudes of error
out of my vnderstanding: cleare

my will of all foggs of noysome
desires; coole and refresh me in
the heate of persecution, fill the
sailes of my affections, and
driue mee speedily into the faire
hauen where I would bee. O diuine
fire burning continually in
the hearts of the faithfull, and
consuming all our spirituall sacrifices,
who this day diddest
descend and appeare in the likenesse
of fiery tongues, bee a fire in my
heart and tongue, that I may be
feruent in my Meditations and
Prayers, and Zealous in the profession
and defence of thy Truth.
Inlighten the darknesse of my
vnderstanding, inflame the coldnesse
of my affections, purge out
the drosse of my corruptions, direct
me in all the affaires of this
life, assist mee in all the exercises
of Deuotion, strengthen me in al
the assaults of temptation, comfort
me in all the miseries and afflictions,
seale all thy gracious
promises of thy Gospell vnto

mee, and seale mee to the day of
redemption. So bee it.
Amen.

                     With siluer wings raise me aboue
                     My Sauiour Christ to see.
                  
               
               
                  
                  PART 1. SVPPART. 4. The Christian FAST'S Deuotion.
                  
                     
                        Of FAST'S in generall.
                        There is a 3-old fast

                              1 Fast from sinne.
                              2 Fast for sinne.
                              3 Fast against sin.
                           
                        
                        THe fast from sinne ought to
bee perpetuall. The fast for
sinne is extraordinarie, vpon speciall
occasions to auert some
dreadfull iudgement, or auoide
som imminent danger. The fasts
against sinne ought to be more
frequent, and according to the
customes of the ancient Church;
and the present practise of the
Church of England,
                        They are—

                              Weekly on the Fridaies.
                              Monethly, on the Holyday Eeues.
                              Quarterly, in the Ember weekes.
                              Yeerely in the Lent.
                           
                        
                        
                           
THe Doctrine of fasting hath
met with errors and superstitions
on both hands: Some
ascribing too much to it, and placing
the immediate and principall
worship of God in it: some
ascribing too little, and making
it no matter of Religion at all:
Some superstitiously obseruing;
and others out of a contrary superstition
scrupulously declining
the obseruation of all Fasts appointed
by the Church. To
steere the iudgement in a middle
course betweene these rocks on
both sides, conceiue thus of the
nature of Religious acts, the seuerall
kindes of Fasts, and the
vse thereof.
                        
                           
A Religious act or work may be
taken:
                        
                           1 In a larger sence for any
work commanded by Christian
Religion, in vvhich
sence all the duties of the
second Table may be called
Religious acts, or workes,
as well as the first.
                           2 In a more restrained acception,
for such workes and
acts in which Religion properly
taken for the worship
of God consists: And these are of two sorts:

                                 1 Principall as
 
                                       Believing in God,
                                       Praying &amp; the like
                                    
                                 
                                 2 Accessarie seruing as helps or preparations to the princi—pall as,
 
                                       Watching,
                                       Fasting and the like.
                                    
                                 
                              
                           
                        
                        
                           
FAsting is not to be esteemed
such an act of religion, as
wherein principally and immediatly
we worship God; for the
Kingdome of God (as the Apostle
reacheth) consisteth not in
meates and drinkes, neither in feasting
or fasting: and Tertullian's
censure is obseruable.Qui Deum per escas colit propè est vt Deum ventrem habeat. 
                           Hee that
worshippeth God by meates, or placeth
worship in them, is not farre off
from making his belly his god; yet
it may bee truly called not only a
good work, but also a religious,
i. e. a worke commanded by religion,
and tending to religion,
as a preparation and helpe thereunto.

                              1 The Spirituall or metaphoricall fast of the soule, which is the abstinence from the forbidden fruit of sin; and this Fast although it may truly be so termed, in regard of the restraint of our carnall appetites, which as greedily desire sinfull objects, as our stomake doth meate, yet it is indeed a Feast, as Salomon calleth it, A good conscience is a continuall Feast.
                              2 Corporall, when wee abstaine from bodily sustenance: and this is also 2 fold
 
                                    1 Constrained and inuoluntary, when
   
                                          Either we want meate to our stomake, as in famine.
                                          Or stomake to our meat; as in sicknesse.
                                       
                                    
                                    2 Voluntary, vndertaken deliberately, when we abstaine from meate, though wee could and might         eate: and this is 3 fold
         
                                          1 Medicinall, when wee forbeare either certaine meates▪ or all meate for a while, for the preuenting of sicknesse, or recouering health.
                                          2 Ciuill, when some kinde of meate is forborne for the profit of the Common-wealth.
                                          3 Religious, when our abstinence is for the mortifying of our flesh, and fitting and preparing   vs to religious duties. This also is either
            
                                                1 Priuate, in which euery man's conscience guided by Scripture and discretion must bee his law.
                                                2 Publike, for which there must be a command
             from lawfull authority. These publike fasts are either-
                 
                                                      1 Extraordinary, as in time of warre, plague or the like.
                                                      2 Ordinary, as the holiday Eues, Embers, an

                        Of the Lent Fast.
                        THe Lent Fast is a mixed
constitution; partly ciuill,
appointed by the King or
State, to preserue young cattell,
spend fish, and encourage fishermen:
partly Ecclesiasticall
ordered by the Church for religious
ends. As those that haue a
care of their bodily health vsualy
purge in the Spring: so the
Church of God hath thought fit
to prescribe this physick of fasting
for the soule in the same season
of the yeere, for these ends especially,
                        
                           1. To beate downe the flesh
at that season when (by reason
of the heate of the blood)
it vsually waxeth most wanton.
The ancient Romans vsed
to hallow a spring to God,
                              Ver sacrum facere. and
the Primitiue Church disdaining
to bee outstripped by
the heathen in any thing that

sauored of Deuotion, likewise
consecrated the spring to the
more strickt Seruice of God
by fasting and prayer then at
other times.
                           2. To conforme the members
to the Head. In this season of
the yeere our Lord's Agony
and bitter Passion were endured,
and are remembred:
and therefore most fit it is that
by fasting, watching, and
teares, wee expresse true remorse
and sorrow for those
our sinnes which were the
causes of those his sufferings.

                                 Godfrey of Bulloigne after he
had conquered the holy land,
and regained it from the Saracens,
yet would neuer bee
crowned there, saying That
it was not fit that the seruant
should were a crowne of gold
there where the Lord and Master
ware a crowne of thornes.
Neither would Christ's dearest
Spowse at that time of

the yeere crowne her selfe
with rose-budds in which
Christ ware that crowne of
thornes: nor lye in beddes of
downe when hee lay on the
hard bed of his Crosse: nor
fare deliciously, or drinke liberally
when hee had nothing
but gall giuen him to eate, and
viniger to drinke.
                           
                           3 To prepare vs to the celebration
of the Feast of Easter,
and the participation of the
Blessed Sacrament. VVhat
time fitter to call our selues
to an accompt for the whole
yeere, then at, or before the
time which the Church hath
appointed, &amp; is in it selfe most
proper for the most generall
and solemne communion
of the Lords Bodie and Bloud.
                           
                           4 To celebrate, and (as farre as
wee are able (to imitate our
Lord's fast of fortie dayes, at
least by some kind of abstinence
during that whole time

to imprint that miraculous
fast of our Sauiour for vs deeper
in our memories.
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           Question.
                           Doth the Church of England
keepe the Lent fast as religious,
or a meere ciuill constitution?
                        
                        
                           Answere.
                           Not as a meere ciuill, but also
a religious sanction: for (as it
appeareth in the booke of Common
Prayer) speciall Collects,
Epistles, and Gospells, with a
Commination are appointed for
diuers dayes in Lent.
                        
                        
                           Obiection.
                           Is it not Popery to keepe strictly the
Lent fast as a religious institution.
                           
                              An. It is not: for First, The religious
obseruation of Lent is far
more ancient then popery. There
are such euident prints and footsteps

of it in the Authenticall Records
of the Primitiue Church,
that he is altogether ignorant in
the writings of the Fathers, or
blinde that seeth them not.
                           Secondly, we keepe not Lent
as the Papists doe, but as the antient
Christians did before Popery
was hatched. As in other
things: so in this we purge away
the drosse▪
                               wee retaine the gold;
wee remoue the abuse; wee
preserue the vse. 1. Wee
place not Religion, or the substance
of Gods worship in abstaining
from any kinde of meate.
2. We renounce all merit by fasting.
3. Wee abstaine not from
flesh as being any way conceiued
by vs to bee more vnholy then
fish. 4. We doe not equalize humane
constitutions Ecclesiastical
or Ciuill to Diuine Lawes. The
one we teach directly and immediately
to binde the conscience,
the other but indirectly &amp; i

                              mediately.
5. We keepe it not by

vertue of any papal constitution, but in conformity
to the ancient Church, and obedience
to his Maiesties Ecclesiasticall Lawes.

                                 Moses was with

dayes, and fortie
nights; he did neither
eate bread,
nor drinke water.

strength of that
meate fortie dayes

                              And when he had fasted
fortie dayes and
fortie nights, afterward
he was an hungry,

in those daies he did eat
nothing, Luke 4. 2.
                              And the diuell tooke
him vp into an high
mountaine, ver. 5.
                              
                              
                                 
IVdicious Caluin,
                                 Obiect. 
                                 Videlius, &amp;
other excellent learned Doctors
of the reformed church
teach, that this Fast of Christ
was miraculous, &amp; so no patterne
for our imitation: and they put
Saint Chrisostome vpon it also,
whose words are:Hom. 49. in Mat. 
                                 Christ said,
Learne of mee, not that I fast, although
hee could haue sayd so, for
he fasted forty dayes; yet he saith not
that, but Learne of mee that I am
meeke and lowly in heart.
                              
                              The solution is not difficult,Answ.
for Christ's Fast may be considered
two waies,
                              First,1 as a miraculous demonstration
of his Diuinity, or an euidence
that hee was the true
Messias, because hee accomplished
the Types foregoing in
Moses and Eliah; and in this regard
it is to bee admired of vs,
but no way to be imitated: And
in this sence,Videl exercitat, in Ignat. 
                                 Caluin &amp; Videlius's
words may
                                    •
                                 passe, and Saint Chrisostome
                                 
must bee taken, vnlesse
thy will haue him contradict
himselfe.
                              Secondly, as a morall remedy
against tentation, or rather a spirituall
Armour which Christ
tooke vpon him when he was to
buckle with the Diuell: and
thus wee may and ought to imitate
Christ's Fast in the kinde,Pro modulo nostro.
though not in the degree. As
we cannot fast as Christ fasted,
so neither can we pray as Christ
prayed, whole nights and with
strong cries, and a bloody sweat:
yet no Christians euer doubted
but that we may and must follow
Christ in all religious exercises,
though not with euen paces, yet
as wee are able. And because
they appeale to S. Chrysostome, let
him be the Vmpire.
                                 Hom. 1. in gen. 
                                       〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                                    . Our Lord Iesus
Christ whē he entred into the
lists with Sathan, fasted forty days,
giuing vs an example how wee
ought to arme our selues against
the Diuel. Certainely if the Learned

Bishops, (afterwards Martyrs)
that penned our Booke of
Common Prayers had thought
Christ's Fast of forty dayes no way
to belong to our Fast, they would
neuer haue appointed the Story
of Christ's Fast for the Gospell,
the first Sunday in Lent, nor
touched vpon it in the Collects.

Christ's Fast.
                           For thy comfort apply the benefit
of it to thy soule.
                           For thy correction condemne
thy luxury, and consider
what great cause thou hast to
humble thy soule with fasting.

                     PVt mee not to rebuke ô
Lord in thine anger, neither
chasten mee in thy
heauy displeasure. Psal 38. 1.
                     
                     For thine arrowes stick fast
in mee: and thy hand presseth
me sore. verse 2.
                     
                     There is no life in my flesh
because of thy displeasure; neither
any rest in my bones by
reason of my sinne. verse 3.
                     
                     For my wickednesses are
gone ouer my head: they are
like a sore burden too heauy
for me to beare. verse 4.
                     
                     Lord thou knowest all my
desires: and my groaning is
not hid from thee. verse 9.
                     
                     Heare my Prayer, ô Lord, &amp;
consider my desire: ô hearken

vnto mee for thy Truth and
righteousnesse sake. Psal. 43.
1.
                     
                     And enter not into iudgement
with thy seruant, for in
thy sight shall no man liuing be
iustified. verse 2.
                     
                     My spirit is vexed within
me; and my heart within me is
desolate. verse. 4.
                     
                     I stretch forth my hands vnto
thee: my soule gaspeth vnto
thee as a thirsty land. verse 6.
                     
                     
                        Lord be mercifull vnto me:
heale my soule for I haue sinned
against thee. Psal. 41. 9.
                     
                     O remember not the sinnes
and offences of my youth; but
according to thy mercy thinke
vpon me, ô Lord, for thy goodnesse.
Psal. 21. 6.
                     I haue eaten ashes as it were
bread, and mingled my drinke
with weeping. Psal. 102. 9.
                     
                     
                        
And that because of thine
indignation and wrath, for
thou hast taken me vp and cast
me downe. verse 10.
                     
                     My dayes are gone like a
shadow, and I am withered
like grasse. verse 11.
                     
                     When thou with rebuke doest
chasten man for sinne, thou
makest his beauty to consume
away like as it were a moth
fretting a garment: euery man
therefore is but vanity. Psal. 39
12.
                     
                     What man is he that liueth &amp;
shall not see death, and shal deliuer
his soule from the hand of
the graue? Psal. 89. 47.
                     
                     When the breath of man goeth
forth he shall turne againe
to his earth, and then all his
thoughts perish. Psal. 146. 3.
                     
                     What profit is there in my
blood when I goe downe to the
pit? Psal. 30. 9.
                     
                     
                        
Shall the dust giue thanks
to thee? Or shall it declare thy
Truth? verse 10.

recouer my strength before I go
hence, and bee no more seene.

                     A Prayer for Ash-wednesday.
                     O Let not my Lord be angry
that I who am but dust
and ashes dare speake vnto
him: for my sinnes cry for vengeance,
and shall I be silent for pardon?
Gracious God either silence
them, or heare mee. If thou wilt
not heare the voice of my words,
heare the voice of my teares: if
thou wilt not heare them, heare
the voice of thy sons blood which
speaketh better things then the
blood of Abel. I confesse I haue
sorely displeased thee, but it
troubleth me that I haue so incensed
thee. I haue grieued thy spirit,
but it grieueth mee that I
should bee so gracelesse as to
grieue that Spirit of grace, which
sealeth thy chosen to saluation. I
deserue that thou shouldest euen
abhorre me for my sinnes; but I
ab
                              •
                           orre my selfe for them in dust
and ashes. I haue offended thee
in gluttony, but I now fast for it:

in pride, but I humble my selfe;
in laughter and sports, but I
weepe for it: in sinfull ioyes, but
I mourne for it: I haue wallowed
in filthy pleasures, but
I
                              •
                           wallow for it in dust and ashes:
haue broken all thy commandements,
but I haue broken my
heart in true contrition for it.
Thou didst not breake a bruised
reede, wilt thou grind to powder
a broken heart? What profit is
in my blood O Lord, when I go down
into the pit? Nay, what profit is in
thy blood O blessed Redeemer if
they for whom it was shed god
downe into the pit of destruction?
Shall the dust giue thankes vnto
thee O Lord, or the ashes and cinders
of hell praise the God of heauen?
H
                              •
                           are O Lord, and haue
mercie vpon me, thou that healest
those that are broken in heart, and
giuest medicine to cure their sicknesse;
raise vp my prostrate and
deiected soule. Why didst thou
hunger O Lord, but to satisfie

for my gluttony? Why didst thou
thirst, but to satisfie for my drunkennesse? Why didst thou weepe,
but to satisfie for my sinfull ioyes?
Why didst thou endure vnspeakeable
torments, but to satisfie
for my Iewd pleasures? Why
didst thou dye an ignominious
death, but to satisfie for my
shamefull life? Why didst thou
shed thy blood, but to satisfie for
my crimson sinnes? Adam our first
Parent did eat the forbidden fruit,
and all our teeth are set on edge,
but thy fasting forty dayes hath
fully satisfied for his eating. But
I renue my sinnes dayly, and thou
renewest thy mercies, The guilt of
my sinne is great, but the price of
thy blood is greater. I haue offended
an infinite Maiestie, but satisfaction
hath beene made by an
infinite Maiestie. My wickednes
cannot exceede thy goodnesse:
for my power of sinning is finite,
but thy facultie of pardoning
is infinite. Wherefore sith

my sins (bee they neuer so many,
neuer so weighty) fall within the
measure of thy mercy, and compasse
of thy goodnesse. And sith
it is all one with thee to giue
what I aske, and to ineite mee to
aske, to heale my wounds, and to
make mee feele the smart of
them: Lord who hast giuen mee
the one, deny mee not the other:
Rebuke the surges of temptations,
and quiet my soule. Thou
who in the dayes of thy flesh offeredst
vp prayers with strong cryes,
heare the strong lowd cryes of a
penitent sinner. Thou who tookest
vpon thee our infirmities,
take pitie vpon them: thou wert
in thine agony stricken with horror,
and vnutterable griefe, allay
the troubles of my affrighted
conscience. Thou who fastedst
forty dayes, accept of my humiliation
these forty dayes; and graunt
that my stomacke may not onely
fast from accustomed meates but
all my sences from their vsual delights,

and most of all, my
heart from worldly comforts
and contentments. Let no
fight delight mee, till I see my
sinnes remoued like a mist and
thy countenance shine vpon
mee. Let no sound or voice
delight mee, till I heare thee
by thy Spirit to speake peace to my
conscience, and say to my soule, I
am thy saluation. Let no pleasant
fields and gardens delight me, til
I haue gathered red flowers out
of that garden which was watered
with thy blood. Let no fruit
delight me till I haue fully tasted
the fruit of the tree of thy Crosse.
Let no meate delight me, till with
the sower herbes of sorrow and
anguish of heart for my sinne.
I haue eaten the Christian
Passeouer, the flesh of thee, that
immaculate Lambe, slaine from the
beginning of the world. Heare me
blessed Redeemer, and as thou
wroughtest in dust when thou
tookest the woman in adultery:

So I beseech thee write my sins
in dust, and bury them all
in the ashes of obliuion.
So be it.
                     Amen.

                     A Prayer for Good-friday.
                     DEarest Redeemer, the
Mediatour of Heauen
and Earth, who this day
werest placed on the Crosse betweene
them both, with thine
armes stretched abroad to embrace,
and thy head bowed downe,
as it were, to kisse all that come
vnto thee; I humbly prostrate
my selfe at thy feet, desiring in
vnfained repentance, with my
teares to wash those thy wounds
that bled for my sinne; and in a
liuely faith to touch the print of
thy nailes, and thrust my finger into

the hole of thy side, thereby to
take reall and corporall possession
of thee, that I may with Thomas
truely call thee, My Lord,
and my God; my dread, and my
loue; my surety, and my ransome;
my Sacrifice, and my Priest;
my Aduocate, and my Iudge; my
desire, and my contentment; the
life of my hope here, and hope
of my life hereafter. Before, I was
thine (for thy hands haue made
me and fashioned me:) but now
sith thou hast offered thy selfe to
be my pledge, and thy bloud for
my ransome, thou art truly mine,
My Lord and my God. O let the
Speare which ranne thee thorow,
fasten my heart to thy Crosse: Let
the nailes which printed thy flesh,
imprint thy loue in my soule:
let the thornes which pricked thy
temples not suffer the temples
of mine head to take any rest in
sinne: let the vineger which was
giuen thee, melt my adamantine
heart into sorrow: let the Spunge
                        
which was offered thee on the
Crosse, wipe out all my debts out
of thy Fathers Tables. Let others
goe on forward if they please; I
will stay still at the Crosse, and
take no other Lesson. for I desire
no other Pulpit then that
tree; no other Preacher then thy
crucified body; no other Text
then thy death and passion; no other
parts then thy wounds; no
other amplification then thy extension;
no other notes then thy
markes; no other points then thy
nailes; no other booke then thy
opened side. The first Adam did
eat the fruit of the forbidden tree;
therefore thou, the second Adam
hangedst vpon a Tree. By his
fall all mankinde were so sorely
wounded, that the whole head
was sicke, and the whole heart faint;
from the crowne of the head to the
sole of the foot, there was nothing
but wounds, and bruses, and sores,
full of corruption: therefore thy
whole head was pained, thy whole

heart wounded: from the sole of thy
foot, which was gored with nailes
to the crowne of the head, which
was pricked with thornes there
was nothing but cuts, and stripes,
and markes, and skars, and sores,
and wounds in thy whole body.
Because our heads plotted and
deuised wickednesse, on thy
head was platted a Crowne of
thornes. Because our eyes burned
with lust, thy eyes were bedewed
with teares. Because we belched
out blasphemies against God,
thy face was spit vpon. Because
our bodies haue beene stretched
want only vpon our soft beds, thy
body was stretched vpon the hard
Crosse. O Lord, our eares haue
offended thee by listening to
want on Musicke, prophane speeches
and songs, therefore thou
suffredst in thine eare by hearing
scoffes and blasphemous taunts.
Wee haue offended God in our
smell by luxurious perfumes, and
sweete odours, therefore thou

sufferedst in thy smell by the
stench of Golgotha. Our taste had
offended in gluttony and drunkennesse,
therefore thou sufferedst
in thy taste by gall and vineger.
Because our feet were swift to
shed bloud, thy feet were nailed to
the crosse. Because our hands
were defiled, thy hands were bathed
in bloud. Because all parts
of our bodies offended, thou
wast punished in all parts; in thy
temples with thornes, on thy
cheekes with buffets, in thy ioints
with straines, in thy flesh with
stripes. Lastly, because our hearts
most grieuously offended in vnchaste,
malicious, couetous, ambitious
thoughts, desires, and affections,
and piercing our selues
with worldly cares; therefore
thou wast most grieuously punished
in thy heart which was run
thorow with the Speare. If all
the sufferings of Martyrs since
the worlds beginning were put
in one skale, and thine in the

other, thy Passion would beare
them all down, for thou barest the
full weight of thy Father's heauiest
hand. Neuer were there sufferings
like thy sufferings, because
neuer such a Sufferer, the torments
being infinitely improued
by the Bearer. Neuer sweat like
thy sweat, because neuer any had
a burthen like to thine. Neuer
teares like thy teares, because shed
for them who thirsted for thy
bloud. Neuer torments like thy
torments, because neuer flesh so
pure and tender as thy flesh. Neuer
horrour like to thy horrour,
being forsaken of thy Father, because
neuer loue like to thy loue
of him. Neuer sorrow like to thy
sorrow, because neuer sense and
apprehension like to thy sense and
apprehension of the infinite displeasure
of God, for the sinnes of
mankinde. O my most bountifull
Redeemer, who bestowedst
largely, and wast bestowed liberally
for me, it concerneth mee to

know how much I stood thee
in. For how should I estimate
thy loue, if I cannot cast the
totall of the Debt thou diddest
discharge for mee? But no
heart can conceiue what sorrow
thou conceiuedst: no tongue can
expresse what griefe thou diddest
expresse by thy bloudy teares,
and those thy strong cries when
thou complainedst that thy soule
was heauy vnto death, &amp; prayedst
thy Father (if it were possible) to
let this 
                              〈◊〉
                            passe from thee. I am
appaled at thine agony, I am astonished
or thy feare, I am amazed
at thy patience, I am rauished at
thy loue. My heart riseth, my
veines swell, my bloud boiles
within me against thy Persecuters.
If it were in my power, I
would put them all to millions
of torments; I would inflict a
thousand deaths vpon Iudas that
betrayed thee, and Pilat that condemned
thee, and the enuious
Scribes and Pharisees that layed

snares for thee, and the periured
witnesses that gaue false euidence
against thee, and that execrable
rout that preferred a murtherer
before thee, and the barbarous
Souldiers that spit vpon thee and
buffeted thee, and the bloudy executioners
of the Iewish malice and
Romane cruelty that hanged, and
nayled, and goared thee. But
when I diue deepe into thy bloudy
passion, I finde my selfe as
deepe in the guilt of thy bloud-shedding
as they. They were in
that but accessaries, but I by my
sinnes was a principall in the
death of the Lord of Life. My
sinnes by their tongues and
hands did all this villany &amp; outrage
vpon thee. Their nailes and
speares pierced but the flesh, but
my sinnes pierced thy very soule.
My sinnes, my sinnes, O Lord by
their hands crucified thee; wherefore
I condemne mine eyes to
continuall teares, my heart to perpetuall
sighs, and my thoughts to

euerlasting pensiuenesse. What
shall I doe to wash away the
guilt of thy bloud which alone
can take away the guilt of my
sinnes? Verily I should bee vtterly
swallowed vp in this gulfe,
but that the price of thy bloud hath
satisfied (as for all other sins: so)
for the guilt of spilling it selfe.
And now my anger, and feare,
and trouble, &amp; anguish are all turned
into ioy, and comfort, and loue,
&amp; admiration of the infinite wisdome
of thy Father in prouiding
such a remedy, and his iustice in
requiring such a satisfaction; but
most of all thy infinite loue, making
so full payment of the infinite
debt of my sinnes. What can
I do, what can I suffer enough for
thee? Gracious God to all the rest
of thy blessings spirituall &amp; temporall
conferred vpō me, purchased
by thy sufferings, adde this
one aboue the rest, the special gift
of the remembrance of these thy
sufferings, that wheresoeuer I

am, whatsoeuer I doe, I may
haue thy passion in my heart and
thy wounds bleeding afresh in
my mind, with an infinite hatred
of sinne that procured them, and
loue of thy goodnesse who induredst
them for me. Thy Church,
since thou leftest her is a widdow,
and I am as one of her dead children,
not (as the Samaritan was)
halfe dead, but whole dead in my
sinnes and transgressions. Thou
Lord art the true Elias, who raisedst
and doest raise from death
this Widdowes children to life,
by stretching thy body ouer them.
O my gracious Lord, apply thy
Body stretched this day on the
Crosse to me. Lay thy head to my
head, thy hands to my hands, thy
feet to my feet, and thy heart to
my heart, that I may receiue
warmth from thy bloud, and ease
from thy stripes, and health from
thy wounds, and spirit from thy
breath, and strength from thy
grace to stand vp from the dead,
                        
and walke with thee from hence
forth in newnesse of life. So bee it,
Amen.

and earth, who createdst
the Euening and the Morning the
second day as wel as the first, Continue,
I beseech thee, vnto mee as
well the comfortable rest of the
Euening to refresh mee after my
labour and trauaile, as the most
needfull light of the Morning to
manage my affaires and businesses.

conscience, and the cleare light of
the Gospel; to guide my feete into
the way of peace. This light conuinceth

the errours of my vnderstanding,
the deprauation of my
will, the disorder of my affections,
the impurity of my thoghts,
the vanity of my desires, the deceitfulnesse
of my heart, &amp; the wickednes
of all my wayes. This light
sheweth mee what I was in my
birth, slime and filthinesse; what
in my life, vanity and folly; and
what in my death, stench &amp; rottennesse.
This light discouereth
vnto me that I haue nothing which
I haue not receiued; that without
Christ I can doe nothing; that in me
(that is in my body) dwelleth no
good; that I am not able of my selfe,
as of my self; think a good thought:
that I cannot desire to thinke,
nor haue wil to desire; nor grace
to will any good. My comforts
are rare; my crosses frequent; my
pleasures momentary; my paines
permanent; my gifts small; my
wants and infirmities great; my
helpes weake; my assaults
strong; my good deeds few, and

they tainted with imperfections,
my sinnes infinite. Let these considerations,
O Lord, humble me
in my selfe, that Christ may raise
me, wound mee in my selfe, that
Christ may heale me; burden mee
in my selfe, that Christ may ease
me; kill mee in my owne conceits
that Christ may quicken me;
make mee most vile in mine own
eyes that I may bee most deare
and precious in his. O Lord which
as vpon this day createdst the
clouds to raine vpon the earth;
showre downe thy graces abundantly
into my heart to mollifie
it, that the seede of the Word may
take deepe root downeward in humility,
and spring vpward in hope,
and spread abroad by charity, and
fructifie in all kindes of good
workes. Lord who this day separatedst
the waters from the waters,
separate, I beseech thee, and
distinguish betweene the waters
of teares which I shed for my
sinnes, and those others which I

                              shed for worldly crosses and calamities.
Cast away the one, and
put the the other into thy bottle.
Lord who this day madest the
heauens (or ayre) without which
I cannot liue naturally, no not
for a moment; infuse into my
heart the Spirit of grace, without
which spiritually I cannot
breathe in my prayers, nor sigh,
nor so much as moue any facultie
or part of soule or body vnto
thee. As oft as I take in, or let
out the aire which I breathe, let
mee receiue in grace from thee,
and breathe out praise vnto thee.
Amen.

and waters out of the
hard Rocks; thou driedst vp
mighty waters, verse 16.

                                 1 Petitions sutable to
the worke of the
day.
                                 2 Motiues to meeknesse,
agreeable to
the precedent exhortation.
                              
                           
                           O Lambe of God which takest away
the sinnes of the world,
who as vpon this day wert led
as a sheepe to the slaughter, and as
a Lambe before thy Shearers, openedst
not thy mouth; who gauest thy
back to the smiters, and thy cheeks
to the nippers, and thine armes to
the binders, and thy face to the
spitters; apply, I beseech thee,
vnto mee these thy meeke sufferings.
Make that profitable to
mee which thou enduredst for
me. Let thy bonds, O meeke Redeemer

set me free; let thy silence
pleade for me, let thy spittle
cure my blindnesse, let thy stripes
heale me, let thy nakednesse cloth
me, and let thy meekenesse in all
discipline me. If thou who in the
forme of God thoughtest it no robbery
to be equall with God, yet humbledst
thy selfe, &amp; didst become obedient
to death, euen the death of
the Crosse, shall not I meekely
submit my necke to the yoke?
If thou who art God didst empty
thy selfe and become of no reputation,
shall I that am but a worme
of the earth fill my selfe, and
swell with pride? If thou suff
                                    •
                                 
                                 redst
blowes, shall not I an affront?
If thou, the Beauty of Heauen,
enduredst spitting vpon, shall not
I endure the fome of a loose tongue?
Shall I for a word of disgrace
venter my owne life and assault
the life of my brother? Doe I
value the life of my body and
soule so low, that I will pawne
it for a toy, a triflle, a mocke, a

word? God forbid. Thy Law,
O God, commandeth meekenesse;
thine example (my Lord) perswades
meekenesse; my condition
requires meekenesse; my frame
and temper (after a sort) preacheth
meekenesse. Why hast thou
giuen me a soft skinne, but to patterne
in my body this vertue of
the minde? Why hast thou giuen
me a tender heart, but to receiue
deepe the impression of
compassionate griefe? Why hast
thou giuen me melting eyes but to
weepe for mine owne infirmities,
and my brethrens calamities?
Why am I brought into the
world disarmed, without any offensiue
Weapon, but to teach
me that I should not fight with,
nor hurt any? Thou, O Lord,
hast created me a Lambe, shall I
by rage and cruelty make my
selfe a Tyger? Thou madest me
as a soft rose of Sharon▪ and Lillie
of the Vallie, shall I turne my
selfe into a thorne and thistle? I

know Anger dis-figureth the body,
much more the soule. It hurteth
and endangereth others,
much more my selfe. It is very
offensiue to man, much more to
thee. Wherefore I beseech thee,
let thy peace alwaies rule in my
heart, and quell and subdue all
my rebellious affections, especially
this of wrath, the most violent
and impetuous of all the
rest. Weede out of my heart all
accursed Thornes and Thistles,
that the seedes of thy Word may
bring forth the fruits of righteousnesse,
which are sowne in peace
of them that loue peace. O let not
the Sunne goe downe on thy wrath
against me, or my wrath against
my brethren, but grant that hauing
made my peace with thee,
by faith in thy bloud, with my
brethren by forgiuing them from
my heart, and reconciling my selfe
to them, I may lay me downe in
peace and take my rest. And let
thy hand, O Sauiour, which shall

protect mee this night from all
perills and dangers, raise me the
next morning to serue thee in
my calling, and magnifie thy
goodnesse for all thy mercies and
fauours vouchsafed vnto me. So
be it. Amen. I

                              BLessing, honour, glory, and
power bee vnto him that sitteth
vpon the Throne, and vnto
the Lambe for euer and ouer,

waters vnder the Heauen
bee gathered▪ into one

place, and let the dry land appeare:
and it was so. Gen. 1. 9.
                           And God called the dry land
earth; and he called the gathering
together of the waters Seas: and
God saw that it was good, v. 10.
                           Then God said, Let the earth
bud forth the bud of the herbe
that seedeth seede the fruitfull
tree, which beareth fruit according
to his kinde, which hath
his seede in it selfe vpon the
earth: and it was so. ver. 11.
                           And the earth brought forth
the bud of the herbe, that seedeth
seede according to his kind;
also the tree that beareth fruit,
which hath his seede in it selfe
according to his kinde: and God
saw that it was good. ver. 12.

                           WHo is this that commeth

red garments from Bozrah? He
is glorious in his apparell, and
walketh in his great strength; I
speake in righteousnesse, and am

                           I haue troden the Wine-presse
alone, &amp; of all people there was
none with me: for I will tread
them in mine anger, and tread
them vnder foot in my wrath, and
their bloud shall bee sprinkled
vpon my garments, and I will
staine all my rayment. ver. 3.
                           And two dayes after followed
the Feast of the Passeouer, and
of vnleauened bread: and the
high Priests and Scribes sought
how they might take him by
craft, and put him to death. Mar.
14. 1.
                           But they said, Not on the feast
day, least there bee a tumult among
the people. ver. 2.

of Spikenard, very costly, and shee
brake the Box and powred it on his head,

song; sing cheerefully with
a loud voice, Psal. 33. 3.
                           
                           For the Word of the Lord
is true, and all his workes are
faithfull, ver. 4.
                           
                           He loueth righteousnesse and
iudgement; all the earth is full
of the goodnesse of the Lord,
ver. 5.
                           
                           Hee gathereth the waters
of the Sea together, as it were
vpon an heape, and layeth vp
the deepe, as in a Treasure-house,
ver. 7.
                           
                           Let the Earth feare the Lord;
stand in awe of him all yee that
dwell in the world, ver. 8.
                           
                           For hee spake and it was
done; hee commanded, and it

stood fast, ver. 9.
                           
                           He so layed the Foundations,
that it should not moue at
any time, Psal. 104. 5.
                           
                           He watereth the hills from
aboue; the earth is filled with
the fruits of his workes, ver. 3.
                           
                           Hee bringeth forth grasse
for the Cattle, and greene
herbes for the vse of men,
ver. 14.
                           
                           That he may bring food out
of the Earth, and Wine that
maketh glad the heart of man,
and Oyle to make him a cheerfull
countenance, and Bread to
strengthen mans heart, ver. 15.
                           
                           The Trees of the Lord also
are full of sap, euen as the Cedars
of Lebanon which hee
hath planted, ver. 16.
                           
                           Hee couereth the Heauens
with Clouds, and prepareth
raine for the earth, and maketh

the grasse to grow vpon the
mountaines, Psal. 147. 8.
                           
                           Which giueth to the beasts
their foode, and to the young
Rauens that cry, ver. 9.
                           
                           Praise the Lord vpon earth
yee Dragons and all deepes,
Psal. 148. 7.
                           
                           Mountaines and all Hills,
fruitfull Trees and all Cedars,
ver. 9.
                           Euery day will I giue thanks

Name for euer, Psal. 145. 2.
                           
                           Thou hast giuen me more ioy

I fainted in my mourning; I
cause my bed euery night to
swimme, and water my couch with

                                 Hezekiah humbled himselfe
for the pride of his heart, he and
the inhabitants of Ierusalem, and
therefore the wrath of the Lord
came not in the dayes of Hezekiah,Manasses. 2
Cro. 33. 12.

vnto him, out of Israel, a very
great congregation of men, and
women, and children; for the
people wept very sore, Ezr. 10. 1.

him,Peter. Before the Cocke crow
twice, thou shalt deny me thrice;
and he went out, and wept bitterly,

yea what feare, yea
what vehement desire, yea what
zeale, yea what reuenge, ver. 11.

Euening: composed of

                                 Petitions sutable to the
the sufferings of Christ
on this day.
                                 Motiues to seeke after
the meanes of our saluation,
agreeable to the
precedent exhortation.
                              
                           
                           BLessed Redeemer, who trodest
the wine-presse of thy father's
wrath alone, reconcile mee
to thy Father, and of a child of
wrath make mee a child of grace,
and sonne of desires. Thou who trodest
the wine-presse alone, no Arch-angell,
or Angel, or any creature
in heauen or in earth, being ioyned
with thee in that worke.
Giue mee a taste of the new wine
of thy Gospel, to cheere vp and
reuiue my drooping spirits, and
comfort my heauy and sorrowfull
heart. Thou which camest with thy
garments red from Bozra; yea, as

red as bloud. Cloath mee with thy
red garment died in thine owne
bloud. Couer my nakednesse, deformities,
wounds, and sores from the
sight of thy Father. Thy garment
is no narrow nor scanty garment;
it is large enough to couer thee,
and all thine Elect. It is the wedding
garment, without which
none shall euer be admitted into
the Kings Supper, but bee bound
hand and foot, and cast into outward
darknesse; where shall bee weeping,
and gnashing of teeth. And this
doome we all deserued; for wee
were borne naked and voide of
all good, and we lay a long time
wallowing in our owne bloud and
filth, and no eye pittied vs, till it
pleased thee of meere loue and
compassion to take vpon thee a
nature of infirmities, to cure all
the infirmities of our nature, and
to cloath thy selfe with flesh, that
thou mightest beare off our
blowes, and receiue the stroakes
of diuine iustice that wee should

haue endured, and deadded them
in thine owne body. O what shall
I returne vnto thee, by way of
thankefull acknowledgement of
such thy loue? I can render thee
nothing but that which thou hast
giuen me. I can render thee nothing
that is not thy due before. I
can render thee nothing but that
which thou puttest into my heart
to render it to thee. Wherefore I
hūbly beseech thee, by thy grace
to enflame my heart with thy
loue, to incite mee to perpetuall
praise &amp; thanksgiuing: to kindle
in me an euerlasting desire to approue
my self vnto thee, &amp; more
and more tie thy loue vnto me. O
let nothing be so precious to me
as thy fauour, nothing so fearfull
as thy displeasure; nothing so
hatefull as sin; nothing so desirable
as thy grace. Let me not now
like a little child run in the dirt, &amp;
soile my cloathes, and take many
a fal in pursuite of a Butter-fly, or
a bubble of Sope appearing glorious

in the aire, but suddenly
vanishing to nothing. Let mee
not be so foolish as to lay the
foundation of my happinesse in
sinking sands, or goe about to
chase a vanishing shadow. Let
me enter into a serious consideration
of the vanitie of the world,
and the deceitfulnesse of riches,
and shame of pleasures, and folly
of sports, and leuity of honours,
and danger of greatnesse, and
account of all. Perswade mee by
thy Spirit out of thy Word that
I haue heere no abiding Citie, but
seeke for one hereafter. That I am
a stranger and pilgrim here vpon
earth; and therefore howsoeuer I
haue heretofore mis-spent my
time, and mis-placed my affections,
and spilt my labours, and
lost my selfe in following earthly
vanities; yet let me now take
the right way to true contentment.
Let all my trauailes be towards
heauen, all my trade for
spiritual merchandise, all my labour

for the meate that perisheth not, all
my searching for the pearle of the
Gospell, all my seeking for the
Kingdome of God and the righteousnesse
thereof. Let mee desire
temporall blessings onely for spirituall
ends; wealth, that I may
he rich in good workes; preferment,
to aduance the honour of
the Gospell; health &amp; strength,
the better to enable mee to doe
thee seruice; length of dayes, that
I may praise thee in the Land of
the liuing. Lord, whose life was
sought this day to destroy it,
seeke thou mine to saue it. Lord
who this day w
                                 •
                              rt anointed to
thy death and buriall, anoint me
with thy Spirit to eternall life.
Saue mee from the hands of all
mine enemies, that I may serue
thee without feare, in holinesse and
righteousnesse all the dayes of my
life. Guard mee by thy prouidence,
that securely reposing my
soule on thy mercy for my absolution
from sinne, and my

bodie on thy power for deliuerance
from all dangers, I may so
by rest and sleepe refresh and
strengthen both, that I may rise
the next morning more cheerefully
to trauaile in the wayes of
thy lawes, and workes of thy commandements.
So be it. Amen.

aboundantly, aboue all
that I aske or thinke, according

in me, be glory in the Church,

                              O Lord, what is man that
thou art so mindfull of him,
or the sonne of man, that
thou so regardest him? Thou madest
so much of him, that thou
madest all creatures for him;
the Fowles of the Aire, Fish in
the Sea, and Beasts of the Field
to furnish his Table, and clothe
his nakednesse, and serue his vse.
The earth thou createdst to sustaine
him, the water to wash
and coole him, the aire to breath
him, the fire to warme him, the
Flowers to refresh him, the
Herbes to cure him, the Fruits

and Graines to nourish him, the
Mines to inrich him, the precious
Stones to adorne him; yea,
the glorious Lamps of Heauen,
The Sunne and Moone, to light
him, the one in the Day, the other
in the Night, and both to
measure his time, to direct his
husbandry, to recreate him in
his trauells, to ripen his fruits
and increase his store. Nay,
(which farre surpasseth the glorious
beames of the Sunne, and
his comfortable light) thou gauest
him a sure light of prophecy
before the day dawne, and the daystarre
arose in the Firmament of
the Church, and afterwards causedst
the Sunne of righteousnesse
to arise vpon him, to shine in his
heart in this life by grace, and in
Heauen by glory for euermore.
Shall I not reioyce in this light?
Shall I not open all the Casements
of my soule to let it in?
Shall I not account their feet
beautifull, and the ground happy

on which they tread, who bring
me tidings of this wonderfull
Light? Shall I not loue thee aboue
all things, who hast preferred
mee aboue all things?
Shall I not serue thee with all the
faculties of my body and soule,
who makest all thy Creatures
serue me? What pretext can I
haue for my ingratitude and disobedience
to thee, so gracious a
Lord and Master? I cannot
pleade ignorance of thy Deity,
for the Heauens declare thy glory,
and the Firmament sheweth thy
handy-worke. I cannot pretend
ignorance of thy Law, for thou
hast put thy Word into my mouth,
and written thy Law in my heart.
I cannot alledge that I neuer
heard of, or saw the Light of thy
Gospell, for the light came into
the world, and shined in the darkenesse,
and the darkenesse comprehended
it not. Neuer had any Nation
a more bright Sun-shine of
the Gospell then ours. But we

loue darkenesse more then light, because
our deeds are euill. And because
we loue darkenesse more then
light, thou mightest most iustly
haue already cast vs into outward
darkenesse. But there is mercy with
thee, that thou mayest be feared;
there is Balme in Gilead to cure
cur deadly wounds; there is Vnctim
in Christ; there is saluation
in Iesus; there is redemption in
his bloud; there is satisfaction in
his death; there is merit in his
perfect obedience; there is hope in
his resurrection and ascension; and
euerlasting comfort in his sitting
at the right hand of his Father, to
make intercession for vs. O Eternall
Aduocate, pleade my muse.
Thou, who out of thy pierced
side openedst to all the inhabitants
of the earth a Fountaine for sinne
and vncleannesse, wash mee from
my wickednesse, and clense me from
my sinne: grant me thy peace which
thou promisest thy chosen, that
my heart bee not troubled. Make

an atonement for mee, and bring
me into fauour, with thy Father,
and my Father, thy God, and my
God. And because all my hope
is in thy mercy, Lord let me imitate
that vertue in thee which I
implore. Let mee patterne that
grace in my life, which saueth
my life. Let mee from my heart
forgiue my brethren their trespasses,
compassionate their infirmities,
relieue their necessities,
ease their crosses, and beare their
burthens. Let the hungry haue
neuer a iust action against me at
thy Barre, for not giuing them
meate, nor the thirsty for not giuing
them drinke; nor the naked,
for not clothing them; nor the
sicke and imprisoned, for not visiting
them; nor the fatherlesse and
widowes for not protecting &amp; defending
them. Let me, who need
abundant mercy, shew abundant
mercy. Let me mete such measure
to my brethren as I expect from
thee. As a good childe, let mee

follow the example of my heauenly
Father, who (as on this
day) caused the Sunne to rise vpon
the Iust and the vniust. So let
the light of my knowledge, and
heat of my loue be extended to
all, but especially to those of the
houshold of faith. And as the Sun
shineth vpon my body, so make
thy countenance shine vpon my
soule. As the Sunne draweth vp
exhalations from the earth, so
raise thou my thoughts and desires
from earthy comforts to
heauenly obiects. As the Sunne
melteth Snow and Ice: so melt
thou my heart frozen in the dregs
of sinne. As the Snnne dispelleth
all mists of darkenesse, and
cleereth the Aire from all Fogs
and noysome Vapours: so let
thy Spirit disped all errors of my
vnderstanding, and cleere my will
from all fogs and fumes of noysome
lusts. Giue mee grace to
keepe a regular, constant, and
vnwearied course vpon earth, as

the Sunne doth in Heauen; and
to grow in grace, and increase in
heauenly wisdome, as the Sunne
ascendeth higher, and shineth
still brighter till it bee high
Noone. Lastly, the Sunne reioyceth
as a Gyant to runne his course:
So grant that I may cheerefully
runne and finish my race, and after
I haue finished it, receiue the reward
of the Righteous, who shall
shine as the Sun in the Kingdome
of the Father for euermore. Amen.

the sufferings of
Christ on this day.

God, who dwellest in
light which none may approach, I
miserable and sinfull creature, by
nature a child of the night, and of
darknesse; nay, very darknesse it
selfe, am ashamed and confounded
to lift vp mine eyes to heauen,
or looke towards the place where
thine honour dwelleth. For, I haue
sinned against heauen and against
thee, and deserue to be cast out for
euer from the sight of thy face,
and presence of thy glorious Maiestie
into vtter darknesse which

the diuel the Prince of darknesse,
and his Angels that are reserued
in chaines of darknesse, till the great
and terrible Day of thy wrath. For
that heauenly light which thou
hast kindled in my heart (though
I seeke to smother it neuer so
much) clearely conuinceth my
conscience, that I preferre the
pleasures of sinne which are the
workes of darknesse, before the glorious
inheritance of thy Saints in
light, hauing my very vnderstanding,
the onely light which is in
me, much darkened through the
ignorance that is in me, by reason of
the hardnesse of my heart. And
notwithstanding thou hast called
mee early and late, and stretched
thy hands all the day long vnto
mee, yet I haue walked still in
the vanitie of my minde, and wearied
my selfe in the wayes of
wickednesse, and haue not hearkened
to thy voice whereby I might
walke in thy lawes which thou hast
appointed for me. Or if for a short

time I haue reioyced in the light
of the Gospel, yet soone after I
haue quenched thy Spirt, and haue
giuen my selfe to wantonnesse, to
worke filthinesse with greedinesse.
Enter not into iudgement with thy
seruant, O Lord, for in thy sight shall
no man liuing be iustified. Though
thou shouldest drowne all my
former sinnes in the bottomelesse
sea of thy mercy; yet the sins
of this day alone giue sufficient
euidence against mee, to condemne
mee. My vnsanctified desires,
and impure thoughts, and
vaine imaginations, and idle words,
and vnfruitfull workes make mee
vnexcusable before thee. I cannot
answer for my abuse of the creatures,
mis-spending my time
which is most precious, &amp; ouerstipping
many occasions of doing
good. How negligent haue
I beene in the duties of my calling?
How cold and dull in my
exercises of Religion? How defectiue
in the confession of my

sinnes? How carelesse in applying
the soueraigne remedies of the
Word? My very prayers which I
make vnto thee for the supplying
of all my wants, and healing of all
my infirmities, are accompanied
with so many wants and infirmities,
that I haue neede to aske
pardon for these my imperfect
prayers. Lord giue mee a sense
of my stupidity and senselesnesse,
and a feruent desire of more feruency
and zeale, and true remorse
and sorrow for want of remorse
and sorrow for these my sinnes.
And because that I know not how
to pray as I ought, let thy Spirit
make intercession for me with sighs
and grones which cannot be expressed,
and let the bloud of thy Sonne
speake better things for mee then
the bloud of Abel. O let not the
glorious light of Heauen goe downe
vpon thy displeasure against me,
but for thy decre Sonne, Iesus
Christ his sake, who is the pr

                                 pitiation
for my sinnes, be reconciled

vnto mee while it is called to
day, that I may finde rest vnto my
soule this night, together with
the comfortable refreshing of my
body by sleepe. So shall I neuer
cease with a ioyfull heart, and
a cheerefull voice, to praise thee
for thine vnspeakable loue in electing
me to eternall life in Heauen,
before thou hadst laid the
foundations of the earth: Thy
goodnesse in creating mee after
thine owne Image; thy mercy in
redeeming mee with the bloud of
thine onely begotton Sonne; thy
grace in calling mee to the knowledge
of thy truth; and thy fatherly
care in safely protecting
me, mercifully correcting, and
liberally prouiding for me euer
since the day thou breathedst into
me the breath of life. Giue me yet
more, O Lord. What wilt thou
giue me? Giue mee a thankefull
heart for all these inestimable
fauours of thine infinite loue,
that I may continually blesse

thee for thy continuall blessings,
with the dew of thy grace
descending vpon me, alwaies beginning
the day with thy mercy,
and ending it with thy praise.
Blessed Redeemer, who wert this
day sold for thirty pieces of Siluer,
redeeme me from the thraldome
of sinne, and neuer suffer mee
with Ahab, to sell my selfe to worke
wickednesse against thee. Let the
heinousnesse of Iudas his sinne,
and the horrour of his punishment
deterre me from betraying
thy truth for any worldly aduantage
whatsoeuer. O Bread
of Life, which hungredst for my
sake; O Source of the Springs of
Libanon, who thirstedst for my
sake; O Ioy of all mankinde,
which sorrowedst for me; O Truth
it selfe and fidelity, which wast
by false trechery betrayed for my
sake; O the true Wedding garment
which wast stript for mee;
O the Redemption and ransome of
the world, who wert sold for

my sake; O the Life and Resurrection
of all that hope in thee, who
dyedst for me; imprint thy loue
so deepe into my heart, that neither
hunger, nor thirst, nor sorrow,
nor nakednesse, nor trechery,
nor thraldome, nor hope of reward,
nor feare of persecution,
nor life, nor death may race it
out. Was it not enough, O
Lord, to become man for mee,
but thou must become a seruant?
Was it not enough as a
seruant to bee scourged for me,
but must thou also, like a bondslaue,
bee sold for me, that am a
bond-slaue of Satan, sold vnder
sinne? Was it not too much to
be sold, but must thou bee sold
at so vile a price as thirty pieces
of siluer? Was no means thought
meane enough to abase thee?
The cheaper thou wert sold, the
dearer I cost thee; for thou
gauest not onely thy liberty
and life, but thy estimation
also for mee. The lower thou

wert abased, the higher thou
hast exalted mee. The lesse was
giuen for thee, the more I owe
thee, who wert content to bee
prized solow, and made of no reputation
for me. O strange ransome!
The Redeemer is sold, that
the sold bond-slaue may be redeemed.
O admirable iudgement!
The righteous is condemned, that
the vnrighteous may righteously
bee acquitted. O wonderfull
cure! The Physician is sicke, and
dyeth, that the Patient may liue.

                                 ke Sauiour, thou foresawest
that the Diuell would enter into
Iudas before hee entered. Thou
knewest that hee would betray
thee, yet thou chosest him: that
hee would lift vp his foot against
thee, yet thou shoddest him with
the preparation of the Gospell of
peace: that hee would sell thee,
yet thou trustedst him with thy
Purse: that the poyson of Aspes
was vnder his lip, yet thou sufferedst
him to touch thy Lips in

which there was no guile, and
seale them with a kisse; and
gently vnsealing them, thou
saidst no more to him but,
Friend, how camest thou hither?
Doest thou betray the Sonne of man
with a kisse? Sweet Sauiour, how
wilt thou entertaine thy friends,
when thou thus intreatedst thy
trecherous seruant? Thou who
wert so good to him, that was
so bad, as worse neuer was; how
will thy grace and goodnesse abound
to them that excell in
vertue. If thou sufferedst a Traitor
to kisse thee, thou wilt neuer
resuse to cheere vp the drooping
countenance of a penitent sinner
with a kisse. Thy Espouse
emboldneth me to beg that kindnesse
of thee which she did. Let
him kisse me with the kisses of his
lips. Kisse thou me with a kisse of
loue, but let me neuer kisse thee
with the kisse of Iudas. Let mee
neuer draw neere to thee with my
lips, and be farre from thee in my

                     Thursday's Deuotion, being
the fifth day from the
Creation.
                     
                        
                           The Father worketh. Ioh. 5. 17. The worke of Creation on this day.
                           
                              SO afterward God said, Let
the waters bring forth in abundance
euery creeping thing
that hath life: and let the Fowle
flye vpon the earth in the open Firmament
of the Heauen Gen. 1. 
                                    •
                                 0.
                           
                           Then God created the great
Whales, and euery thing liuing and
mouing, which the waters brought
forth in abundance, according to
their kinde, and euery feathered
Fowle, according to his kinde; and
God saw that it was good, ver. 21.
                           
                           Then God blessed them, saying;
Bring forth fruit &amp; multiply, &amp; fill
the waters in the Seas, and let the
Fowles multiply in the earth, v. 2
                                    •
                                 .
                           
                           So the Euening and the Morning
were the fifth day.
                        
                        
                           
                           And I worke, Ioh. 5. 17. The worke of Redemption on this day.
                           THen came the Day of vnleuened
bread, when the Passouer
must be sacrificed, Luke
22. 7.
                           
                           And be sent Peter and Iohn, saying;
Goe and prepare vs the Passouer,
that we may eat it, ver. 8.
                           
                           And they said, &amp;c. v. 9. Then he
said vnto them, Behold, &amp;c. v. 10.
                           
                           And say to the goood man of the
house, The Master saith vnto thee,
Where is the lodging where I shall
eat my Passouer with my Disciples,
ver. 11.
                           
                           Then he shall shew you a great
high Chamber, &amp;c. ver. 12.
                           
                           So they went, and found as hee
had said vnto them, and neade ready
the Passouer, ver. 13.
                           
                           And he tooke Bread, and when
he had giuen thankes, hee brake it,

and gaue to them, saying; This is
my Body which is giuen for you,
doe this in remembrance of me,
ver. 19.
                           
                           
                              Likewise also, after Supper hee
tooke the Cup, saying; This Cup is
the new Testament in my bloud,
which is shed for you, ver. 20.
                           And he came out, and went (as he
was wont) to the Mount of Oliues,
and his Disciples also followed
him, ver. 39.
                           
                           And when he came to the place,
he said to them, Pray, lest ye enter
into temptation, ver. 40.
                           
                           And he gate himselfe from them
about a stones cast, and kneeled
downe, and prayed, ver. 41.
                           
                           Saying, Father, if thou wilt,
take away this Cup from me: neuerthelesse
not my will, but thine
be done, ver. 42.
                           
                           And there appeared an Angell
vnto him from Heauen, comforting
him, ver. 43.
                           
                           But being in an Agony, he prayed
more earnestly: and his sweat

was like drops of bloud, trickling downe the
ground, ver. 44.

                              O Lord, how manifold are
thy workes, in wisdome
hast thou made them all; the
earth is full of thy riches, Psal.
104. 24.
                           
                           
                              So is the great and wide
Sea, wherein are things creeping
innumerable, both small
and great beasts, ver. 25.
                           There goe the Ships, and there
is that Leuiathan, whom thou
hast made to take his pastime
therein, ver. 26.
                           
                           These wait all vpon thee, that
thou mayest giue them their
meate in due season, ver. 27.
                           
                           That thou giuest, they gather,
thou openest thy hand, and they
are filled with good, ver. 28.
                           
                           Thou hidest thy face and

they are troubled; thou takest
away their breath and they dye,
and returne againe to their
dust, ver. 29.
                           
                           They that goe downe to the
Sea in ships, that doe their businesse

Lord, and his wonders in the

                           For hee commandeth, and
raiseth vp the stormy wind,
which lifteth vp the waues
thereof. ver. 25.
                           
                           They mount vp to the Heauens,

the depth; their heart is melted
because of trouble, ver. 26.
                           
                           They reele to and fro, and
stagger like, a drunken man,
and are euen at their wits end,
ver. 27.
                           
                           Then cry they to the Lord

in trouble, and hee bringeth
them out of their distresse, v. 28.
                           
                           He maketh the stormes to
cease, so that the waues thereof
are still, ver. 29.
                           
                           Then are they glad because
they are quiet; so hee bringeth
them to their desired Hauen,
ver. 30.

                           By these Springs shall the
Fowles of the Heauen dwell,

                              ONe depth calleth vpon another;
the depth of my
ignorance vpō the depth
of thy Wisdome; the depth of
my wickednesse, vpon the depth
of thy goodnesse; the depth of
my misery, vpon the depth of
thy mercy. O Lord, in the depth
of thy Wisdome finde meanes to
helpe my ignorance; in the depth
of thy goodnesse, to ouercome
my wickednesse; in the depth of
thy mercy to relieue my misery.
Inlighten mine vnderstanding,
that I may know mine ignorance;
rectifie my will, that I
may detest my wickednesse; and

mollifie my heart, that I may bewaile
my misery: and by faith
incorporate me into thy Sonne,
Iesus Christ, that I may be partaker
of his knowledge, righteousnesse,
and happinesse. As he
made my ignorance his ignorance,
and my sinne his sinne,
and my misery his misery▪ by taking
vpon him my guilt, and satisfying
for my punishment: so
make thou (I beseech thee) his
Wisdome my instruction, his
Righteousnes my sanctification,
and his Glory my happinesse.
Consider mee, I beseech thee,
not as I am in my selfe, defiled;
but as I am in him, washed; not
as I am in my selfe naked, but as
I am in him, clothed; not as I
am in my selfe wounded, but as
I am in him, healed; not as in my
selfe, a childe of wrath, but as in
him reconciled and at peace
with thee. And hauing my peace
made with thee by his chastisement;
grant that I may haue peace,
                              
as farre as it is possible, with all
men; especially, with all the children
of peace. Let mee euer remember
and consider, that thou,
my Father, art the God of peace;
and thy Sonne, my Sauiour, the
Prince of peace; and his Law, the
Gospell of peace; and his Seruants,
the Children of peace; whose duty
is the study of peace, and the
marke they principally aime at,
as the end of their faith, the peace
of God which passeth all vnderstanding.
O let mee striue and contend
against strife and contention,
as a thing most hatefull to
thee, hurtfull to my neighbour,
and most of all preiudiciall to
my selfe, by endangering my
person and state, disturbing the
quietnesse of my minde, hindring
me in the prosecution of my businesse,
and (which is worst of all)
making me indisposed, and altogether
vnfit for the performance
of diuine duties. Teach
me of what spirit I am or should

be, euen of that which descended
vpon thy Sonne in the likenesse of
a Doue without Gall: By this
spirit mortifie in me the lusts and
affections of the flesh, as enuy,
wrath, reuenge, and the like.
By the still voice, in which thou
spakest to Elias, let mee learne
that thou art not in the fire of my
rage, nor in the storme of my
passion, but in the saft gale of
grace. Lord, who on this day
replenishedst the Sea and Riuers
with fish, and Aire with Fowles
in shapes admirably various, and
in number almost infinite; stir me
vp by the consideration thereof,
to admire thy power &amp; wisdome
in thus storing, and (as it were)
peopling this vaste and fearefull
seeming solitude; and much
more to magnifie thy goodnesse
in thus richly and daintily furnishing
the tables of men. Blessed
Lord, who this day madest
the waters fruitfull, let thy Spirit
moue vpon the waters of my

teares, that they may abound in
the fruits of repentance, and bee
blessed in the encrease of spirituall
consolatious. Lord, who this
day commandest the Fowles to flye
through the aire, lift vp my soule
from the earth with the wings of
faith and hope, that she may flye
vp towards Heauen. Make mee
light and cheerefull after my heauy
sorrowes and grieuous afflictions,
that though I haue beene
as blacke and sad in my heart
and countenance, as if I had layen
among the pots, yet I may be,
by the grace of thy Spirit, which
descended in the likenesse of a
Doue, like that Doue, whose wings
are siluer, and her feathers like
gold. So be it. Amen.

who this day didst eate the
Passeouer, and went eating in thy
Supper; Suppe with me in the Euening
                              
of this life, and grant that I
may Dine with thee in thy day
of eternitie. Gracious Redeemer,
who this day gauest thy selfe to
me in the Sacrament, first instituted
by thee; and the day following
gauest thy selfe for mee
on the Crosse; giue me a speciall
saith to receiue thee, and retaine
thee, and applie continually thy
feare to embolden me, thine Agonie
to comfort me, thy nakednesse
to cloathe me, thy cōdemning
to quit me, thy bloud to clense
me, thy wounds to heale me, and
thy death to quicken me. O let
not the worke of thy hands bee
plucked out of thy hands. Let
not the purchase of thy bloud be
morgaged to the diuell. Let not
thy teares and bloud bee shed in
vaine. Let not thy sighes and
groanes be breathed out to no
purpose. Let not thine agonie and
sweate, let not thy taking and binding;
let not thy arraigning and
condemning; let not thy stripping

and scourging; let not thy buffetting
and being spit vpon; let not
thy pricking and goaring; let not
thy crucifying &amp; dying want their
effects in me. What should I not
do or suffer for thee, who wert
martired in all parts of thy body
and faculties of thy soule for me:
In thy minde by apprehension of
thy Fathers wrath, in thy affections
by feare and sorrow euen vnto
death; in thy inward parts by
thine agonie: in thy outward by
thy torments: in thy head by
thornes: in thy cheekes by buffets:
in thy face by spettle: in thy eares
by blasphemies: in thy smell by
the stench of Golgotha: in thy
taste by gall and vineger: in
thy handes and feete by nailes:
in thy bodie by stripes: in thy side
by the launce: and in thy ioynts
by the crosse. O Lord, who hast
called me to the knowledge of thy
truth, and by thy Spirit imprinted
thy loue in my heart by those
nailes which fastened thee to the

                              Crosse. Let nothing euer be able to
separate me from thy loue, not tribulation,
nor anguish, nor persecution,
nor height, nor depth, nor
things present, nor things to come,
nor life, nor death: for I know that
all things worke for the best to them
that loue thee. I cannot suffer the
thousandth part of that for thee,
which thou hast suffered for mee.
I cannot suffer the least part of
that which I deserue for my sins.
I cannot suffer any thing which
the Apostles and Prophets haue
not suffered before me. I cannot
suffer so much as may any way
counter-ballance the massie
crowne of glory prepared for me: for
my light and momentarie afflictions
are no way worthy the glorie
that shall be reuealed vpon me
hereafter. And for the present,
what are afflictions, or crosses, or
persecutions, or mockes, or disgraces?
but the common lot of thy
children, the discipline of thy
schoole, the physicke for my

soule, the pledge of thy loue, the
badge for my profession, the incentiues
of my deuotion, the triall
of my faith, the exercise of my
patience, the testimonie of my
constancie, the marke of my conformitie
with thee. When I am
thus chastened I am iudged of thee
that I be not condemned of the
world. Shall tribulation therefore,
or anguish, or bands, or imprisonment,
or stripes, or banishment, separate
me from thy loue? Nay,
sith I know they befall me by
thy prouidence, and are mitigated
by thy mercie, and directed
by thy loue for my greater good;
they shall rather vnite me faster
to thee. How shall I denie thee
who art the Lord that bought me

How should I grieue thy Spirit
which comforteth me in all my
griefes? How should I set that
bloud at nought which was the
price of my redemption? How shold
I euer willingly offend thee who
art my peace, &amp; hast reconciled me

to thy Father, and payed my ransome
with thy dearest hearts
bloud? How can I euer forget
thee who remembrest me at all
times in all places; in my iournies
by thy conduct; at home
by thy safe-guard; in my prayers
by thy assistance; in my afflictions
by thy comforts, in my
board by thy bountie; in my
bed by thy protection; and in all
my wayes by thy support. To
this thy gracious prouidence and
care which continually watcheth
ouer all thine Elect: I commend
my sleepe and rest this night, beseeching
thee so to order it and
me that whether I sleepe or wake,
whether I labour or rest, whether
I lye downe or rise vp, all

                     The Deuotion for Friday:
                     
                        
                           The Father worketh. The work of creation on this day
                           MOreouer God sayd, Let the
earth bring forth the liuing
thing, according to
his kind, cattell, and that which
creepeth, and the beast of the
earth, according to his kind, and it
was so, Gen. 1. 24.
                           
                           And God made the beast of
the earth according to his kind, and
the cattel according to his kind, and
euery creeping thing of the earth
according to his kind: and God saw
that it was good, ver. 25.
                           
                           Furthermore, God sayd; Let vs
make man in our owne Image according
to our likenes, and let him
rule ouer the fish of the Sea, and
ouer the Fowle of the Heauen, and

ouer the beasts, and ouer all the
earth, and ouer euery thing that
crcepeth, &amp; moueth on the earth,
ver. 26.
                           
                           Thus God created the man in
his Image: In the Image of God
created hee him; hee created them
male and female, ver. 27.
                           
                           And God blessed them, and God
sayd to them: Bring forth fruit,
and multiply, and fill the earth, and
subdue it, and rule ouer the fish of
the Sea, and ouer the fowle of the
heauen, and ouer euery beast that
moueth vpon the earth, ver. 28.
                           
                           And God sayd, Behold, I haue
giuen to you euery herbe bearing
seede which is vpon all the earth,
and euery tree wherein is the fruit
of a tree bearing seed that shall be
to you for meate, ver. 29.
                           
                           Likewise, to euery beast of the
earth, and to euery sowle of the
heauen, and euery thing that moueth
vpon the earth which hath life
in it selfe, euery greene herbe shall
be for meat; and it was so, ver. 30.
                           
                           
                              
And God saw all that he had made, and loe
it was very good. So the Euening &amp; the Morning
were the sixt day, ver. 31.
                           
                        
                        
                           
                              AND I WORKE The worke of Redemption on this day.

then the angels to crown him
with glory and worship, v. 5.
                           
                           Thou madest him to haue dominion
ouer thy workes, and
thou hast put all things in subiection
vnder his feet, v. 6.

                           GLOrious Creator and gratious
Sauiour of mankind,
I lift vp mine eyes &amp; hands
to thee, whose hands this day
made and fashioned me. I lift vp my
heart vnto thee, who

                              e heart was
this day pierced for my transgressions.
I lift vp my bodie and
soule to thee, who this day wast
lifted vpon the Crosse to offer an
infinite sacrifice for the expiation
of the sinnes of the whole world.
Let thy hands which fashioned and
formed me, sustaine and support
me: let thine armes which thou
stretchedst on the Crosse embrace
                              
me and hold me fast to thee that
nothing may seuer me frō thee,
Almightie and most wise Creator
who hast made me of nothing,
suffer me not to make my selfe
worse then nothing. Gracious
Redeemer, who hast saued that
which was lost, loose not that
which thou hast saued. Though
the malice of Sathan be great,
yet thy goodnesse is greater.
Though my sinnes be exceeding
many, yet thy mercies exceede
them, though my corruptions be
strong, yet thy grace is stronger.
Let it not be in my power
or the power of any creature, either
in heauen or in earth to
marre thy best worke; to deface
thine Image which first thou
stampedst in me; and after I had
slurried and almost raced it out,
thou hast by grace renewed it, according
to the first patterne, in
holinesse and righteousnesse. When
thou madest me light, I made my
selfe darkenesse, but thou hast

turned my darkenesse into light.
When I was freed, I enthralled my
selfe, but thou hast freed me:
when I was straight, I crooked my
will, but thou hast rectified it:
when I was whole I maimed my
selfe, but thou hast healed me:
when I was happie I made my
selfe miserable, but thou hast rest

me to my former blisse.
Nay I haue gained by my losses,
and am raised higher by my fall,
through thy infinite mercie,
which hath not onely ransomed
me from death, but purchased me
an eternall inheritance, and crowne
of life in thi

Sith thou hast done so
great things for me whereat I reioyce;
sith thou hast prepared such
things for me as neither eye hath
seene, nor eare hath heard, nor euer
entred into the heart of man to
conceiue; what manner of man ought
I to be in all holy conuersation?
How cleare ought those eyes to
be which shall see God? How

cleane those eares, which shall
heare words that cannot be vttered
How pure that heart which
shall be filled with those ioyes

hast created me art the holy one of
Israel. Thou ô Sonne, who redeemedst
me art the Holy one of God.
Thou, ô Spirit, which sanctifiest
me art the holy Ghost. Thou, ô Father,
hast created me according to
thine Image in holinesse and righteousnes:
thou, ô Sonne, hast redeemed
me to serue thee in holinesse
and righteousnesse all the dayes of
my life: thou, ô Spirit, hast freed
me from sinne and made me seruant
to God that I might haue my
fruite in holinesse, and the end euerlasting

                           MOst bountifull and mercifull
Lord God, who this
day createdst man and redeemedst
him; formedst and reformedst him,
inspiredst him with the breath of
life, and expiredst and diedst for
him, vpon the Crosse; shew thy
selfe a faithfull Creator in preseruing
thine owne workes, and a
faithfull Redeemer in houlding
thy deere purchase. O let not thy
hate of sinne extinguish thy loue
to thy creature. Let not any

thing that I haue done preiudice
thee in the merit of that which
thou hast suffered for me. My sins
deserued eternall wrath of thy
Father, but thou hast borne it.
My wonton delights and impure
pleasures deserued stripes and
wounds, but thou hast receiued
them. My hainous crimes deserued
death, but thou hast suffered
it for me. This day my first parent
Adam was made a liuing
soule; and this day thou the second
Adam wert made a quickning
Spirit. This day he sinned in a
garden, and this day thou sorrowedst
in the garden. This day he
tooke the fruite of the forbidden
tree, and this day thou wert hung
vpon the accursed tree. This day
he was cast into a dead sleepe, and
his side opened, and his wite Eue
formed of his ribbe, was flesh of his
flesh, and bone of his bone: this day
also thou wert cast into a deadly
sleepe, and thy side opened and thy
Spouse the Catholicke Church

                              brought foorth, not by water onely,
but by water and bloud, the water
of regeneration▪ and bloud of explation
and sanctification.
                           This day Adam brought the
curse vpon himselfe and all his
posterity; this day thou prouidedst
an euerlasting blessing for
thy selfe and all thy members.
That which he lost thou hast regayned
with aduantage: that
which he did, thou hast suffered
for: that which I owed, thou hast
discharged on the very day, by taking
all his and our debts vpon
thee, and laying downe an al-sufficient
price to satisfie for them.
O giue me an hand of faith to receiue
so much of this infinite sum
as may discharge my debt, and
strengthen this my hand, that I
may hold it fast, and tender it to
thy Father, and receiue from him
an absolute and generall acquittance
signed with thy blood, and
sealed with thy Crosse, bearing

God cannot be God if nature limit

All things past haue so come to
passe as the Oracles of thy truth
fore-shewed they should, and
how then can I doubt of things
future reuealed in them? The deluge
was foretold 120 yeeres before;
and at the prefixed time it
ouerranne the whole world. Thy

peoples bondage in Aegypt for
400 yeeres, and their after deliuery
is no otherwise described
by Moses, then it was in a dreame
many Ages before deliuered to
Abraham. Thou calledst thy Shepheard
Cyrus, and thine annointed
Iosias by name, to their functions
long before either of
them, or their forefathers, were
conceiued. The 4 famous Monarchs
pictured out in Nebuchadnezzars
Image, succeeded in
their order. The Assyrian represented
by the golden head, the
Persian by the siluer armes and
shoulders; the Grecian by the
thighs of brasse; and the Romane
by the leggs of yron. And do we
not see at this day, the stumpe of
that Image, and the feete, partly
yron in the Turkish, and partly of
clay in the Germane Empire?
Thy Birth and Death, ô Sauiour,
was fore shadowed in Types,
and fore-spoken of by Prophets,
euer since the world began; and

since thy comming into the flesh,
and finishing all things at thy
death in Ierusalem: Not a syllable,
or one iot of any of thy words
haue passed without their accomplishment.
Ierusalem is destroyed;
the Temple made euen with the
ground, and neuer could be built
againe. The Iewes are dispersed
into all nations. The Gospell is
preached through the whole
world: the man of sinne is euery
day more and more discouered;
and why should I not then
belieue as certainly that the heauens
shall passe away shortly with
heate, and the elements melt with
fire, and thy signe bee seene in the
clowdes; and those that are in their
graues be awaked with the sound of
the last Trumpe, and meete thee in
the aire? I belieue, Lord helpe my
vnbeliefe. Is it not as easy for thee
to raise mee out of ashes, as at the
first to reare me out of the dust?
to send backe my Spirit into my
body, as at the first to breathe it

in? I see the seede in the ground,
the plants in the garden, dye before
they rise and spring vp. I see
wormes, and flies, and diuerse
other creatures that spend the
winter season in a kinde of death,
reuiue in the Spring. I see my
selfe dead euery night, and aliue
in the morning. Why then
should I call in question this Article
of my beliefe, of all most
comfortable? Lord who this
euening dist cast Adam into a
dead sleepe, and thy selfe fellest asleepe
on the bedde of thy Crosse,
and awakedst him againe, and
raisedst thy selfe out of thy sleepe
of death; sanctifie my rest and
sleepe this night vnto me, that I
may by it not only be strengthened
in my body, and reuiued
from my bed of slumber to rise
to my labour and trauell the
next morning, but also more
confirmed in my faith touching
the resurrection of this my body
out of the bedde of the graue at

the last day, So bee it, Amen.

                           So God blessed the seauenth day,
and sanctified it, because that in it
hee had rested from all his worke
which God had created and made.

                           The Sonne resteth in the Sepulcher.
                           ANd when the euen was come,
there came a rich man of
Arimathea, named Ioseph, who
had also himselfe bin Iesus's Disciple.
Mat. 27. 57.
                           He went to Pilate and asked the
body of Iesus. And Pilate commanded
the body to bee deliuered.
verse 58.
                           So Ioseph tooke the body, and
wrapped it in a cleane linnen cloth.
verse 59.
                           And put it in his new Tombe
which he had hewen out in a Rocke,
and rolled a great stone to the doore
of the Sepulcher, and departed.
verse 60.
                           And there was Mary Magdalene,
and the other Mary sitting
ouer against the Sepulcher, verse
61.
                           Now the next day that followed,
the day of the preparation, the chiefe

Priests and Pharisees came together
to Pilate, verse 62.
                           Saying, Sir, we remember that
that deceiuer sayed while hee was
yet aliue, After three dayes I will
rise againe, verse 63.
                           Command therefore that the
Sepulcher be made sure vntill the
third day, left his Disciples come
by night, and steale him away, and
say vnto the people, He is risen from
the dead; so the last error will bee
worse then the first, verse 64.
                           
                              Pilate saide vnto them, Yee haue
a watch, goe your way, make it as
sure as you can, verse 65.
                           So they went, and made the Sepulcher
sure, sealing the stone, and
setting a watch, verse 66.

I haue cried day and night before

and prayed three times a day
Dan. 6. 10.
                              And they which went before
rebuked the blind man that he
should hold his peace;The blind man. but he
cried so much the more, Sonne of

him, saying; Send her away, for
she crieth after vs, ver. 23.

without ceasing, 1. Thess. 2. 13.

much almes to the people, and

doing;Hath certaine promises of reward. for in due season we shall
reape, if we faint not, Gal. 6. 9.
                              
                                 Hold that thou hast, that no
man take thy crowne, Reu. 3. 11.
                              For we are made partakers of
Christ, if we hold the beginning
of our confidence stedfast to the
end, Heb. 3. 14.
                              He that endureth to the end
shall be saued,

                                 Continue therein; for in doing
this, thou shalt saue thy selfe, and
them that heare thee, 1. Tim, 3. 8.
                              Worke out your saluation with
feare and trembling, Phil. 4. 12.

the full assurance of hope to the
end,
                                 Comfortable assurance. Heb. 6. 11.
                              To him that ouercometh I will
giue to eate of the tree of life,
which is in the middest of the
garden of God, Reuel. 2. 7.
                              
                                 
Let vs labour therefore to enter
into that rest, lest any man fall after
that same example, Heb. 4.

                              Let vs feare lest a promise
being left vs of entering into his
rest, any of you should seeme to
come short of it, Heb. 4. 1.

Luk. 22. 28.

Kingdome, as my Father hath appointed
vnto me, ver. 29.

will giue thee the crowne of life.

the latter end is worse
then the beginning, 2 Pet. 2. 20.
                              For it had beene better for
them neuer to haue knowne the
way of righteousnesse, then after
they haue knowne it to turne
from the holy commandement
deliuered vnto them, ver. 21.
                              But it is happened vnto them
according to the true Prouerbe;
The dogge is turned to his vomit

washed, to her wallowing in the

                           THE PRAYER FOR
Saturday Morning
                           
                              composed of

                                    Petitions sutable to the
rest, of the Father and the
Sonne on this day.
                                    Motiues to perseuerāce,
agreeable to the subsequent
exhortation.
                                 
                              
                           
                           ALmightie Creator of heauen
and earth, and all things
therein; who this day restedst frō
all thy workes, and blessedst it:
grant to me (after the painefull
laboures and trauailes of this
life are ended) a sweete, blessed,
and comfortable rest with thee
in heauen, where I may keepe a
continuall Sabbath, hold a perpetuall
feast, sing an euerlasting
song, weare an incorruptible
                              
crowne, possess an eternall inheritance,
and fully enioy thee in all
things, and all things in thee, in
endlesse quietnesse, ioy content,
and rest. This rest is the marke at
which all my desires aime; this is
the price for which all my endeauou
                                 •
                              s
runne; this is the hauen to
which (by the gales of thy spirit)
my christian course driues. For
in this rest there is perfect tranquillitie,
and in this tranquillitie
contentment; and in this contentment,
ioy and pleasure, and in this
ioy and pleasure, varietie, and in
this varietie securitie, and in this
securitie eternitie. This is the end
without end, to which all my
labours in thy seruice, and sufferings
for thee through my
whole life, tend vnto. Here I
haue labour without rest, there
shall be rest without labour; here
perturbations without tranquillitie,
there tranquillitie without
perturbations; here desire without
content, there content without

desire; heere paine and sorrowes,
without sincere pleasures
and ioy; there ioyes and pleasures
without all paine and sorrowes:
heere satiety of delights
without variety, there variety
without satiety; here feare without
safety, there safety without
feare; heere a sudden end without
ioy, there ioyes without end.
Wherefore I beseech thee heauenly
Father, loosen my desires
and affections from the things
that are belowe, and knit them
to the things that are aboue
Breake and dissolue the vnlawfull
contracts betweene my soule
and the creatures, and marrte her
to thee in righteousnesse. Breede in
me more and more the loathing
of the forbidden fruit; and a longing
for the fruits of the tree of
life. Let mee not leane vpon the
reedes of Aegypt which will
breake vnder me, and the splinters
run into my body. Let mee
not repose my selfe vnder Ion
                                    •
                                 s's
                              
worme-eaten gourd, but the sollid
wood of Christ's Crosse. Let
me not set vp my rest on this side of
Iordan, but passe ouer into the
celestiall Canaan. And because
death is the narrow passage betweene
this life and the life to
come, let mee not so much feare
this cut as I doe; for on this side,
I leaue labour, sorrow, sinne,
shame, vexation, anxiety, paine,
and mortality; and on the other
side, I finde rest, righteousnesse,
glory, contentment, pleasure,
and immortality. It is but
a short passage, and my Sauiour
hath made it safe. All thy Saints
either haue, or shall passe it ouer.
I lose nothing in this passage;
my soule is presently transported,
and though my body stay a
while heere, yet it shall follow
in due time. And no sooner this
darke world and the shadow of
it goes out of sight, but the glorious
light of heauen shineth vpon
me; I see streetes of gold, and

gates of pearle, and foundations
garnished with all sorts of pretious
stones. I shall behold thee the Father
in thy Maiesty, Christ thy
Sonne in his glory, the Spirit in
his sanctity, the Arch-angels
and Angels in their excellency,
and the Saints in their felicity. I
shall then hunger no more, I shall
labour no more, I shall trauell no
more, I shall feare no more, I shall
grieue no more, I shall desire no more.
I shall need no more any house,
for the heauen &amp; heauen of heauens
shall be my habitation; nor
Temple, for God shall bee my
Temple: nor light, for the Lambe
shall be my light. O Lord let the
hope and expectation of this
euerlasting rest and happinesse,
sweeten all my labours, and ease
my torment, and mittigate my
sorrowes, and comfort my heart,
that I faile not in my labour, nor
tyre in my trauell, nor sinke vnder
my burdens, nor fall vnder
my crosses, nor die for sorrow of

my wounds receiued in the
Lord's battailes; but hold on
cheerefully, strenuously, and valiantly,
till I ariue at the land of
promise, and there receiue the lot
of mine inheritance with the Saints
in light. So be it, Amen.

The right vse of Fasting consisteth
in the

                                 1 Manner, that it be sincere, not hypocriticall.
                                 2 Measure, that it be not immoderate.
                                 3 Cause or end, which must bee either
  
                                       1 To tame and subdue the flesh: such was Paul's fast, I beate
  downe my bodie.
                                       
                                       2 To testifie our humiliation, and sorrow for our sinnes; such
  was Ezra's and the Nineuites fast.
                                       3 To quicken zeale and deuotion: such was Hanna's fast
  Luke 2.
                                       
                                    
                                 
                              
                           
                           The abuse of Fast likewise is seene
in the

                                 1 Manner, if wee abstaine from one kinde of meate, and
feede daintily on another: forbeare one meale, and glut
our selues another.
                                 2 Measure, if we continue or fast so long, that we much impaire
our strength, or endanger our health.
                                 3 Cause or end- 
  
                                       1 If we abstaine from any kind of meat
out of an opinion and erroneous scruple
of conscience, that it is of it selfe
vncleane, as the Tatians and Encratites
did; or, as being now forbidden
vs vnder the Gospell, as some Iudaising
Christians at this day.
                                       2 If we abstaine from all or any kind of
meate to merit, or satisfie thereby;
as Papists doe.
                                       3 If wee keepe a Fast to colour any vngodly
or malicious purpose; as Iezebel
did.

The Lord is faithfull,

shall keepe you from euill.

soules to him who is a faithfull
Creator, 1 Pet. 4. 19.
                           I know whom I haue trusted,
and I am perswaded that he is able
to keepe that which I haue
committed vnto him against that
day, 2 Tim. 1. 12.
                           For this end Christ dyed and
rose,
                              Christ himselfe died, and by death entred into his glorie. and reuiued, that he might
be Lord both of the liuing, and
the dead, Rom. 14. 9.
                           In that hee dyed, hee dyed to
sinne once; but in that hee liueth,
hee liueth to God, Rom. 6.
10.
                           If we be dead with Christ, wee
belieue that wee shall also liue
with him, verse 8.
                           I was dead,And destroyed death. I am aliue,
and I liue for euer; and I haue
the keys of death and of hell,
Reu. 1. 18.
                           I am the resurrection and the

though he were dead yet shall he
liue, Ioh. 11. 25.
                           Christ hath abolished death,

                              Death is swallowed vp into
victory, 1 Cor. 15. 54.

O graue where is thy victory? v.
55.
                           The sting of death is sinne, and
the strength of sinne is the Law,
verse 56.
                           But thankes bee to God who
hath giuen vs victory through
our Lord Iesus Christ, verse 57.
                           Hee also tooke part of the
same,And changed it in that through death hee
might destroy him that had the
power of death, euen the diuell,

                           I Blesse and magnifie thy glorious
Maiestie, wisdome, and
omnipotencie, ô Lord, high
possessor of heauen and earth, as for
all thy wonderfull workes in the
sixe dayes, so also for thy holy rest
on this day, whereby thou assurest
me of eternall rest in heauen.
And I beseech thee of thy goodnesse
which answereth thy greatnesse,
to distill the dew of thy
blessings as vpon my daily labours,
so vpon my rest in the

night, that it may recouer my
spirits, and refresh my faculties,
and repaire my strength, and put
me in minde of that comfortable
rest which they enioy, who lie in
the bosome of Abraham, and
sleepe in Iesus, who this day lay
in his sepulchre, yet saw there no
corruption. For thy promise
thou madest good, not to leaue his
soule in hell, nor to suffer thine holy
one to see corruption. O Lord I
entirely desire thee to burie all
my sins, especially those (which
this day and weeke hath added
to the totall summe) in his graue;
and teach me by it to burie in the
pit of eternall obliuion. not onely
my brethrens trespasses against
me, but also all those sinfull
baites which haue heretofore allured
me to any kinde of vicious
leudnesse. Grant that I may more
and more feele the power, as of
Christs death in the mortification
of my fleshly members; and so of
his burial in the cōquering of the

horror of the graue. For as thou
hast threatned death saying, O
death I will be thy death; so thou
hast threatned the graue also,
saying, O graue, or corruption, I
will be thy corruption, or destruction
And what though my flesh be
all consumed to bones, yet thy spirit
blowing vpon dead bones can reuiue
them, and couple them againe with
sinnewes, and cloathe them with
flesh. What though these bones
be resolued into dust, yet thou
which madest it of nothing, canst
as easily restore it, and reare it
out of that which is as lirtle or
next neighbour to nothing.

from death, sha

my vile bodie, and make it like vnto
his glorious bodie, by that power
whereby thou art able to subdue all
things vnto thy selfe. Make my
heart hewen out of a harder
rocke them thy Sonnes sepulchre
was, a fit receptacle, not for dead,
but for liuing Iesus. As that sepulchre
                              
neuer receiued any but
Iesus; so let my heart entertaine
nothing but thee. Make me a
pure and chaste soule, that as thy
Sonne was borne of a Virgins
wombe, and lay buried in a virgine
tombe: so he may abide in
my virgin and vndefiled soule.
Remoue the heauie stone from my
heart, as thou diddest that great
stone from his sepulchre. As he
neuer returned to his sepulchre
after he came out of it: so grant
that when thou hast perfectly
raised me out of the graue of sin,
I may neuer returne to it againe.
And as he kept Sabbath in his
graue, and obserued thy statutes
in life and in death, and fulfilled
all righteousnesse: so grant I may
both in life and death accomplish
thy holy will. And as hee
neuer rested till he had cried out,
All is finished: so grant that I may
not be wearie of well-doing, nor
giue ouer my heauenly race of
godlinesse, till I may say, It is

finished. Endue me with power from
aboue, and gird about me thy
whole armour, that I may fight a
good fight against the world, the
flesh, and the diuell, and finish my
course in the full discharge of my
calling, and keepe the faith to the
end; and in the end receiue that
incorruptible crowne of glory which
thou the righteous Iudge wilt giue
to all that loue the second comming
of thy Sonne. And behold thou
commest with the cloudes, and
all eyes shall see, euen they that
nailed thee; and all kindreds of
the earth shall mourne before

punishments, and are the memorials
of Eue's transgression.

who may be members of Christ,
&amp; heires of saluation, asswageth
the paines for the present, and
the ioy for them afterwards extinguisheth
the memory of
them.
                                 4. That they haue daily experiments
of God's strange deliuerances;
especially in this kinde.

                        A Prayer for a woman in
time of her trauaile.
                        O Most righteous and mercifull
God who hast iustly
inflicted the sorrowes vpon
me, which I now endure for
the transgressions of Eue, the Mother
of the liuing; and yet in
iudgement remembring mercie
hast sanctified them to the propagation
of thy Church; and doest
graciously and wonderfully
strengthen and help thy seruants in
them both, to ouercome the
paines, and escape the danger. Haue
pitty vpon the feeble estate of thy
poore Hand maid, vnable without
thy speciall assistance to goe
through this great worke of patience
and labour. My first parent
did eate the sowre grapes, and
my teeth are set on edge;

and I now taste the bitternesse
of that forbidden fruit, and from
my heart loathe and detest it. I
confesse, gracious Lord, that both
my selfe &amp; my childe yet vnborne
haue deserued to perish in our
sin, originall or actuall; and I
humbly submit it and my selfe to
thy gracious will and pleasure:
yet my hope is in that blessed
seede of the woman that brake the
Serpent's head, that thou hast a
blessing in store for me, and that
I beare in my wombe; of which
I am as much in trauaile in my
soule to bring it forth to thee,
and make it thine, as I am in labour
in my body to bring it forth
to me and make it mine. Blesse
me deare Father in both workes,
that of nature, and this of grace.
Lord, punish not the childe for
the parents sake, but preserue
the parent for the child's sake,
that both may liue, and praise thy
Name. Sanctifie vnto mee these
paines and throwes, that they

may serue not onely as a corasiue
for sinnes past, but also as a preseruatiue
against sinne to come.
Blesse me in the vse of all ordinarie
meanes for my sake, bearing
and bringing forth my childe.
Comfort my fainting heart, and
strengthen my weake body, and
asswage my bitter pangs and
sorrowes, and sweeten them
with an assured hope of a happie
and speedy exchange of them
into comfort and ioy that a childe
is borne into the world. Lord,
who wert present with me at my
conception, be present with me
in the safe deliuery of that I haue
conceiued. Let thy hand which
formed and fashioned my babe in
my wombe, keepe all the parts
and members of it in due shape,
substance, &amp; proportion, that the
notes of the parent's sin bee not
seene in the markes, maimes,
and defects of the childe. It is my
labour, but it is thy work, ô Lord,
to make it a liuing instrument of

thy glory. Perfect, I beseech thee,
the worke thou hast begunne and
wrought in mee thine vnworthy
worke-house. Make it like all the
works of the creation; to which
thine own mouth gaue testimony,
that they were perfect good.
Deale not with me according to
my wickednes, but according to
thy gracious goodnesse. Carrie
such a hand ouer me in al time of
my labour &amp; grieuous paines, and
after my deliuery also, that I may
euer praise and magnifie thee for
the effects of thy grace in my patience,
of thy power in my strength,
of thy prouidence in my timely
deliuery, and thy great mercy in
my safety, and the preseruation
of my fruit; for which I humbly
beg a blessing from thee, and
both dedicate it and my selfe to
thee. Receiue both in and for
thy holy childe Iesus's sake, to
whom with thee, and the blessed
Spirit, be all honour, praise, and
thanksgiuing now and for euer,

THANKSGIVING
for safe Deliuery.
                        AETernall praises &amp; thanks
bee rendered to thee ó
Lord of my health and
strength, in whose hands
are the waies of life, and issues of
death. I looked for extreme danger,
and behold safetie; I looked
for out-cries of sorrow, but behold
shoutes of ioy; I looked for
sudden death, and behold present
life to me, and my sweete
babe. O that my heart were a
skilfull inditer, and my tongue as
the pen of a ready scribe, to write
downe thy praises, and record
the wonderous things thou hast
done for my soule. Thou hast deliuered
my life from death, mine
eyes from teares, and my feete from
falling. Thou hast dealt graciously
with mee aboue my desert, enabled

me aboue my strength, deliuered
me aboue my hope, and
therefore I will reioyce in thee
aboue measure, &amp; magnifie thee
without end. Thou hast shut the
mouth of the pit which would
haue swallowed mee, 
                              •
                           herefore
will I open my mouth in thy praises.
Thou hast made good thy
promises vnto mee, therefore I
will make good my vowes vnto
thee. Thou hast giuen mee the
fruite of my wombe, therefore
will I returne vnto thee the
fruite of my lippes. Now I haue
felt thy strength in my greatest
weakenesse, I haue tasted thy
goodnesse in my bitter pangs, I
will therfore cal vpon thee in my
troubles, and will praise thee in
my deliuerances, and depend
vpon thee as well in want as in
plentie, in sicknesse as in health,
in death as in life. Thou mightest
most iustly haue depriued
me of the benefit, and my infant
of the hope of life. Thou mightest

deseruedly haue cut off the
roote and the branch in the same
moment, for both were at thy
mercie, and liable to a curse; But
thy mercie is ouer all thy workes:
thou art good to them that are
bad; gracious to them that are
vngracious; mercifull to them
that are most sinfull. Thou desirest
not the death of a sinner, but of
sin. Thou wouldest that all should
liue, and here sowe the seedes,
and in heauen reape the fruite of
immortality. For to this end
thou breathedst into vs the life
of nature to make vs capable of
the life of grace, that thereby
we may attaine the life of glory.
Therefore doest thou bring vs
into the light of this world, and
set vs in the way: that walking
the paths of thy Commandements
we might in the end ariue
at our country in heauen. This life
of nature thou hast now giuen to
my childe, and continued to me;
adde now, I beseech thee, grace

to nature, and glory to grace
hereafter, that as we now liue in
thee by nature, so wee may liue to
thee by grace, and hereafter for
euer liue with thee in glory. Thou

                                 •
                              st ordained strength out of the
mouthes of babes and sucklings, and
iustly maist expect praise from
them. Gracious Lord, first
giue my infant strength, and then
receiue praises from it. The hidden
treasure which for many
moneths thou layedst vp in me, is
now safely taken out of me, and
deliuered me, therefore I now offer
it to thee in thy holy Temple. Accept
that from mee which thou
hast giuen to me. Receiue that
into thy hands which thou hast
put into mine armes. Wash it in
the Font of Baptisme; regenerate
it by thy holy Spirit; feede it with
the sincere milke of thy Word, till it
haue knowledge to choose the good
and refuse the euill. As it groweth
in yeeres, and stature, &amp; strength;
so grant that it may grow in thy

                           grace and fauour, and increase in
wisedome and in the knowledge of
our Lord &amp; Sauiour Iesus Christ.
So be it, Amen.

                        A Prayer for the Sicke.
                        
                           FAithfull Creator, and preseruer
of all men, especially of
thine Elect, whom thou
smitest in mercie, and chastenest
in loue, and correctest in tender
compassion, and wounding and
healing againe, killing and reuiuing,
bringing downe to the gates of
hell, and raising vp from thence
againe: Look downe, I beseech
thee, vpon thy poore prostrated
seruant grieuously punished, and
afflicted in body with the smart
of my paine, and much more
troubled and terrified in minde
with the sence of my sinne, and
feare of thy heauie displeasure.
My paines and pangs of my sicknes,

O Lord, are bitter, yet the
remembrance of my sin is more
bitter vnto mee, and the apprehension
of thy wrath far exceedeth
both. Whilest I enioyed
health and prosperitie, the ioy of
all my ioyes was in thy loue; and
so now in my misery &amp; sicknes,
the sorrow of all my sorrowes,
and anguish of all my paines, is
in the feeling of thy wrath. This
is the very venome of the arrow
that sticketh in me. It is gall to
my taste, and wormwood to my
mouth, and the sharpest vineger
in my festered sores, and a burning
fire in my bones. I confesse to
thy glory and my shame, that of
very faithfulnesse and goodnesse to
mee, thou hast layd this scourge
vpon me, to the end, that by the
stripes of my flesh, my spirit
might be healed, and saued in the
day of my Lord IESV. I fostered
snakes secretly in my bosome; I
cherished priuate sin in my conscience,
&amp; now they haue stung

me. I tooke too much delight in
worldly comforts, and therefore
thou hast sawced them with sorrowes.
My wanton flesh pampered
vp with ease and daintie
fare, spurned at thy word, and
grew head-strong against thy
Spirit, and therefore thou hast
tamed it with the sharpe whip.
I was in a kind of a spirituall
Lethargie, till thou didst awake
me with the stroke of thy hand.
There grew a Call ouer my conscience,
which this thy chastisement
hath plucked away. I felt
an Itch of impure lusts &amp; desires
in all parts of my soule, but thy
Rod hath killed it. I valued not
the benefit of health as I should
haue done; and therefore thou
hast taught me it by my paine. In
my prosperity, I remembred not
the afflictions of my brethren, and
therefore thou hast afflicted mee
like vnto them. I wept not for
the calamities of thy people, I
shed no teares for the publike

ruines of the Church, and therefore
thou hast drawne from mee
abundance of them for my priuate
griefes. I put from mee still
the euill day, and therefore thou
hast brought it neere vnto mee.
All this haue I done, and therefore
most iustly all this do I suffer.
And because I know that it
is good for mee thus to be disciplined
by thee; I humble my selfe
vnder thy mighty hand, and kisse
this thy Rod which imprints in
my flesh a sence of my sinne, and
a marke of thy loue, and maketh
my body black and blew; but I
trust (through thy grace) shall
make my soule appeare faire and
beautifull in thine eyes. Oh that
I could frame my selfe to perfect
patience, that my abiding thy
will might as wel please thee, as
my disobeying thy will hath displeased
thee. My spirit is willing,
but my flesh is weake. I striue
with the rebellions of my heart and
corruptions, but they are too strong
for mee.
                        
                        
                           
Faine would I silence all clamorous
passions, and let patience
haue her full worke vpon me; but
the loathsomenesse, and painfulnesse,
and tediousnesse of my disease
drowne all my ghostly comforts,
and make me euen rore for
the disquietnes of my heart. O Lord
thou knowest all my desires, and my
groanes are not hid from thee. Thou
knowest whereof I am made, thou
vnderstandest that I am but dust;
&amp; wilt thou contend with dust &amp;
ashes? O Father of mercy, and God of
all consolation, lay no more vpon
me then thou wilt giue me ability
to beare. Either asswage and
diminish my paine, or increase
my strength: either shorten my
sicknesse, or lengthen (I beseech
thee) my patience. I acknowledge
my many sins deserue many
strokes, &amp; grieuous sins smart
strokes; but my flesh is not of yron,
nor my sinews of brasse, nor my
heart of Oke, to endure so many
blowes and re-iterated cuts of

thy axe. Neither could my
sufferings (if I could endure as
much for sin as any of thy blessed
Saints and Martyrs haue suffered
for righteousnesse) thereby satisfie
for the least of my sins. For
thy Maiesty is infinite, and my
offences therefore infinite; thy
mercy toward me is infinite, and
my ingratitude towards thee
thereby made infinite. Thy law
eternall, and my gilt consequently,
for the breach thereof,
eternall. But thy Son a person
of infinite dignity, out of his infinite
loue to mankinde hath layed
downe his life, a price of infinite
value, to discharge the infinite
debt of my sins. Wherefore, I
beseech thee, looke not vpon my
sin, but vpon thy Son: weigh
not my transgressions, but his
merits. Thy iustice is fully satisfied
by him; O confirme thy
mercies vnto me. As I haue, in
the cup of trembling, tasted thy
iustice &amp; my sins: so grant that in

the cup of saluation I may taste thy
mercie, and my Sauiour's merits.
Blesse all the meates, and drinks,
and medicines, which I shall receiue
from the hand of the Physitian
to the repaire and recouery
of my bodily health; and sanctifie
all the bitter potions which
thou hast, and shalt minister vnto
mee to the restoring of my
soule's health. Comfort my fainting
Spirit, and strengthen my feeble
knees, and support my weake
hands, and reuiue my deaded
heart; and so powerfully assist me
with thy Spirit of strength, that
I may with confidence call vpon
thee, with patience endure this
tryal, with hope expect thy good
pleasure, with wisedome make
vse of this thy visitation, and
with thankfulnesse euer praise
thy goodnesse and mercy for my
safe recouery, if it may stand
with thy blessed will; whereunto
I fully submit, and wholy resigne
my selfe now and for euer, Amen.

                        A Thanksgiuing for recouery.
                        O Lord God of my health &amp;
saluation, who hast knowne
my soule in trouble, and
diddest make my bed in my painefull
&amp; dangerous sicknes, and hast
now raised me out of it to stand
before thee: I offer now vnto thee
the calues of my lippes, and the
sacrifice of my body and soule,
which thou first gauest, and now
hast restored vnto me. Because I
employed not the faculties of
my soule, and members of my
body, as I should haue done;
thou bereauedst mee of the
strength, and vigour, and vse of
them for a season. But now, because
thy compassiō failes not, thou
hast returned them to me againe.
Wherefore I consecrate and deuote
them perpetually to thy
seruice; no longer desiring the

vse of them, then they may bee
seruants vnto me of righteousnesse
vnto holinesse. What I vowed in
my sicknesse, by the helpe I will
carefully performe in my health.
As I am in the state of my body,
so by the power of thy renewing
grace, I will become in the estate
of my soule, a new man. My
broken heart which thou hast
healed, shall now entirely loue
thee; my feeble knees and loose
bones which thou hast setled,
shall day and night bowe vnto
thee: My enthralld mēbers which
thou hast set free, shall cheerefully
serue thee: My weake hands
which thou hast strēgthened, shal
continually be lifted vp vnto thee:
My tyed tongue which thou hast
loosened, shall vnfold thy mercies:
My deafe eares which thou
hast opened, shall heare thy voice:
My harsh, and hoarse, and faint
voice which thou hast cleared,
shall sing alowde, a song of mercy
and iudgement. For in thy former

mercies thou forgottest not
iudgement to make mee know
mine euil; and in the latter iudgement,
thou remembredst mercy, to
make me know thy goodnes. By
thy iudgement, thou hast taught
me to know my self, and by thy
mercies to know thee. Before I
was troubled I went wrong; but
now, sith thou hast set me right,
I will run the way of thy Commandements.
I will perpetually renew
and refresh the memory of
this singular benefit, whereby
thou hast renewed and restored
me, and by the smart of my paine
made mee vnderstand wisedome secretly.
Thy rod and thy staffe as
they haue comforted and supported
mee, so they haue beate many
profitable instructions into
me. By thy scourge which peirceth
the flesh, and entereth into
the heart and bowells, I learne
that thou requirest truth in the inward
parts, and searchest the reines
and the heart. By thy rod which

at once striketh all the parts of
my body, though it fall heauiest
vpon one particular, I learne, that
though sinne reigneth and rageth
in one kinde more then another,
yet that my whole soule is diseased.
The whole head is sicke, and the
whole heart is faint. My fits were
many, because my sins were multiplyed.
My paine increased, because
my sins were aggrauated.
My wounds stanke, and were corrupt
through my foolishnesse: the
insufferable anguish whereof, as
it gaue me a quicke touch of my
sin, so also a liuely sence of the
benefit of health. By my confining
to my chamber, thou taughtest
me what is the benefit of liberty;
by the weakenesse of my
limmes, what is the benefit of
strength; by my want of appetite,
what the benefit of a stomacke
is; by the missing my friends:
what the benefit of society is; by
my continuall watching, what the
benefit of rest, and repose is; by

the stupidity and deadnesse of al my
parts, what the benefit of the
senses is. Alas, what is a crowne
beset with rubies, to a man that
hath a carbuncle in his head?
What is a chaine of pearles to one
that hath a squinsie in his neck?
Or a collar of Esss to him that
hath an impostume on his brest?
Or a diamond ring to him that
hath the gowte in his finger? Or
the golden garter to him that
hath the crampe in his leg? What
are melodious songs to the deafe
                                 ••
                              
                           
Beautifull pictures to a blinde
man? Dainty dishes to a man that
hath lost his taste? What are
large reuenewes to him that
possesseth nothing but his bed?
What are all to him that is tormented
in body with the pangs
of death, or troubled in minde
with the horror of hell? I confesse
vnto thee ô Lord, that in my
health I often read in the Scriptures,
and heard this note from
the sweete singers of Israel, that

                           worldly delights and comforts were
vaine, and much like flaggs and
bulrushes which men in danger of
drowning catch to beare them vp,
but they sinke downe vnder water
with them. I cannot denie but
the golden bells of Aaron in thy
Sanctuarie, haue often rung this
lesson in mine eares, that the true
Heart's ease groweth onely in thy
Paradise; that the contents of the
large volume of this world is nothing
but vanitie: that one little fit
of an ague can dispossesse the happiest
man aliue of his temporall felicitie.
Yet till I learned by that
which I suffered; till thy rod had
imprinted it euen in my flesh, I
neuer deepely thought of it, nor
so throughly assented thereunto,
but I held the world (though not
in admiration, yet) in too great
esteeme. I secretly repined at
the wealth of the couetous, and
honour of the ambitious, and
pleasure of the voluptuous, and
accounted the liues of thy

Saints, miserable in comparison
of them: so foolish was I, and ignorant;
and euen as it were a beast
before thee: But in this schoole
of my sicknesse I haue perfectly
gotten by heart that which I did
but slubber ouer before and learned
by rote. In my fearefull visitation,
finding by mine owne
experience, that all earthly delights
and comforts, leaue vs in
our extremities, and cannot steed
vs when we most neede; nay
they rather increase then asswage
our paines: I beganne to distaste
them all; I grew out of loue
with this life, and entertained
death in my most serious
thoughts; and I perswaded my
selfe, that those thoughts of
death shall neuer dye in me, but
still liue in my memory, and vpon
euery good occasion bee stirred
vp and reuiued, to prepare
and dispose mee to my last end,
that so I may see that Basyliske
first, and kill it, before it see and

kill mee. O death, how bitter is
thy remembrance in the pride of
health? O life how bitter is thy
remembrance in the misery of
sicknesse? Verily I had vtterly
fainted vnder my Crosse, and my
soule had bin put to silence: I had
sowned, and giuen vp, not onely
my Ghost, but thy holy Spirit of
comfort, if thou hadst not stayed
me with flagons, and comforted mee
with apples, and in my hottest fits
cooled me with the sweete gales
of thy grace. I had fallen not
onely with Iob, to curse the day
of my birth, but to question
the truth of thy Promises.
But euerlasting thanks bee vnto
thee, who gauest me victorie ouer
that fearefull tentation; and by
thy holy Spirit didst call to my
mind all those sweet promises of
thy Gospell, whereby I receiued
comfort, and recouered strength.
And now I am assured, and more
then euer before, perswaded, that
neither height nor depth, nor principality,

nor power, nor paine, nor
pleasure, nor sicknes, nor health,
nor life, nor death, nor things present,
nor things to come, shall euer be
able to separate me from thy loue in
CHRIST IESVS.

corruption, for thou hast cast my sins
behind thy backe, ver. 17.

                              2 All thou sufferest is nothing to
what Christ endured for thee.
                              3 Other Saints and holy Martyrs
haue abided a harder tryall, and
more grieuous afflictions, &amp; many
more terrible conflicts, and yet

                              4 It is a thousand times better to be
corrected here (though neuer so seuerely)
then eternally tormented in
hell.
                              5 God wil not lay more vpō thee thē
he will giue thee ability to beare, &amp;
therfore will vndoubtedly asswage
thy paine or increase thy patience.
                              6 The extremity of thy paines wil be

take them from thee, by recouering
thee; or thee from them, by deliuering
thee out of the body.

                           If ye forgiue not men their trespasses,
neither will my heauenly
Father forgiue you, Mat. 6. 15.

                           So likewise shall my heauenly
Father doe also vnto you,from the heart. if yee

                              from your heart forgiue not euery
man his brother their trespasses,
v. 35.
                           O King, let my counsell be acceptable

breake through, nor steale, v. 20.
                           And I say vnto you, make vnto

If there bee a messenger with

                           He will pray vnto God, and he

let him call for the Elders of the
Church, and let them pray ouer

haue committed sinnes, they shal
be forgiuen him, ver, 15.
                           Verily I say vuto you, whatsoeuer

are remitted, vnto them; and whosoeuers
sinnes ye retaine, they are
retained verse 23.
                           Thy mercy is great aboue the

In whom we haue redemption

obtained eternall redemption for
vs, Heb. 9. 12.

                           If the blood of bulls and of
goates, and the ashes of an
heifer, sprinkling the vncleane,
sanctifieth to the purifying of

the flesh, Heb. 9. 13.
                           
                              How much more shall the blood
of Christ, who through the eternall
Spirit offered himselfe to
God without spot, purge our consciences
from dead workes? verse

Son clenseth vs from al sinne, 1 Ioh.
1. 7.
                           
                           If any man sin, wee haue an
Aduecate with the Father, Iesus
Christ the righteous, 1 Iohn. 2. 1.
                           
                              And he is the propitiation for
our sins, and not for ours onely,
but also for the sins of the whole
world, v. 3.
                           These haue washed their robes,
and made them white in the blood
of the Lambe, Reu. 7. 14.
                           Thou hast redeemed vs by thy
blood to God, Reu. 5. 9.
                           
                              I pray not that thou shouldest
take them out of the world, but
that thou shouldest keepe them
from the euill, Ioh. 17. 15.
                           
                              Sanctifie them through thy

truth; thy Word is truth, v. 17.
                           Neither pray I for these alone,

                           In that day ye shall aske in my
name, and I say not vnto you that
I will pray the Father for you,
Ioh. 16. 26.
                           For the Father himselfe loueth
you, because ye haue loued me,
v. 27.
                           Who is he that condemneth?
It is Christ that dyed, yea rather
that is risen againe, who is euen
at the right hand of God, who also
maketh intercession for vs, Rom.
8. 34.
                           Hee is able to saue them euermore
that come vnto God by
him, seeing hee euer liueth to
make intercession for them, Heb.
7. 25.

and preach the baptisme
of repentance for the remission of
sins, Mar. 1. 4.
                           
                              
According to his mercy hee
saued vs by the lauer of regeneration,
and renewing of the holy
Ghost, Tit. 3. 5.
                           The like figure whereunto
euen baptisme, doth now saue
vs by the resurrection of Iesus
Christ, 1 Pet. 3. 21.
                           Repent and bee baptized euery
one of you, in the name of the
Lord Iesus, for the remission of
sins, Act. 2. 38.
                           This is the Blood of the New
Testament,The vniuersality of promises to penitent sinners. which is shed for many,
for the remission of sins, Mat.
26. 28.
                           
                              Seeke the Lord while hee may
be found, call ye vpon him while
he is neere, Isa. 55. 6.
                           
                              Let the wicked for sake his way,
and the vnrighteous man his
thoughts, and let him returne
to the Lord, and he will haue mercy
vpon him, and to our God, and
he will abundantly pardon, v. 7.
                           For my thoughts are not your
thoughts, nor my waies your

waies, saith the Lord, v 8.
                           As I liue, saith the Lord God,
I haue no pleasure in the death of
the wicked, but that the wicked
turne from his way and liue,
Ezekiel 18. 22.
                           Turne you, turne you from
your euill waies, for why will yee
dye ô yee house of Israel? Ezek.
33. 11.
                           I haue no pleasure in the death
of him that dyeth, saith the Lord
God: wherefore turne your
selues, and liue, Ezek. 18. 32.
                           They shall know me from the
least to the greatest, saith the
Lord, and I will forgiue their iniquity,
and remember their sin no
more, Ier. 31. 34.
                           Thou shalt finde the Lord, if
thou seeke him with al thy heart,
and with all thy soule, Deut. 4.
29.
                           For the Lord thy God is a
mercifull God, he will not forsake
thee, nor destroy thee, v. 31.
                           If my people shall humble

themselues, and pray, and seeke
my face, and turne from their
wicked waies, then I will heare
from heauen, and will forgiue their
sinne, 2 Chro. 7. 14.
                           If thou returne to the Almighty,
thou shalt be built vp, Iob 22.
23.
                           I haue blotted out, as a thick
clowde, thy transgressions and as
a clowde thy sins: returne vnto
me, for I haue redeemed thee, Isa.
44. 22.
                           Cease to doe euill; learne to
doe well, Isa. 1. 17.
                           Come now, let vs reason together,
saith the Lord: though
your sins be as skarlet, they shall
be as white as snow; though they
be red like crimson, they shall bee
as wooll, Isa. 1. 18.
                           Goe, proclaime these words
to the North, and say, Returne
thou back-sliding Israel, saith
the Lord, and I will not cause mine
anger to fall vpon you, for I am
mercifull, saith the Lord, and

                              will not keepe anger for euer, Ier.
3, 12.
                           Onely acknowledge thine
iniquity, that thou hast transgressed
the Lord thy God, verse
13.
                           Come, let vs returne to the
Lord, for he hath torne, and hee
will heale vs; he hath smitten, and
he will binde vs vp, Hosea 6. 1.
                           I will heale their back-slidings,
I will loue them freely, Hosea 14.

                           Seeke the Lord, and yee shall
liue, Amos 5. 6.
                           Turne yee vnto mee, saith the
Lord of Hosts, and I will turne

                           Come vnto me all ye that are
heauy laden, and I will ease you,
Mat. 11. 28.
                           Likewise I say vnto you, There
is ioy in the presence of the Angels
of God ouer one sinner that
repenteth, Luke 15. 10.
                           The Son of Man came to saue
that which was lost, Luke 19. 10.
                           
                              
I came not to call the righteous,
but sinners to repentance, Luk.
5. 32.
                           That repentance, and remission
of sinnes should bee preached in his
name among all Nations, Luke
24. 47.
                           Repent ye therefore, and bee
conuerted, that your sinnes may
be blotted out when the time of
refreshing shall come from the
presence of the Lord, Acts 3. 19.
                           The Lord is not slacke as some
men account slacknesse, but is
long suffering to vs-ward, not willing
that any should perish, but that
all should come to repentance, 2 Pet.
3. 9.
                           If wee confesse our sins, hee is
faithfull and iust, to forgiue vs our
sinnes, and cleanse vs from all vnrighteousnesse,

Host of heauen,The example of Gods mercy in pardoning heinous and grieueus sinners. 2 Chron. 33. 5.
                           And he caused his children to
passe by the fire in the valley of
Hinnon; also he vsed Witch-craft,
                              
and dealt with familiar Spirits,
&amp;c. v. 67.
                           But when hee was in his affliction,
hee besought the Lord his
God and humbled himself greatly
before the Lord of his Fathers,
v. 12.
                           
                              And prayed vnto him, and he
was intreated of him, and he heard
his supplication, v. 13.
                           
                           He denied before them al,Peter. saying,
I know not what thou sayest,
Mat. 26. 70.
                           And againe he denyed him, v.
72.
                           Then he began to curse, and
to sweare, saying, I know not the
man, v. 74.
                           And the Lord turned, and
looked vpon PETER, and PETER
remembred the words of
the Lord, Luk. 22. 61.
                           And PETER went out and
wept bitterly, v. 62.
                           And behold a woman in the
City which was a sinner,

an al abaster box of ointment,
&amp;c. Luk. 7 37.
                           
                              
Her sinnes which are many, are
forgiuen her, for she loued much,
v. 47.
                           A woman which had bin healed
of euill Spirits and infirmities,
Mary Magdalene, out of whom
went seauen diuels, Luk. 8. 2.
                           The younger tooke his iourney
into a farre countrey,The prodigall. and
wasted his substance with riotous
liuing, Luk. 15. 13.
                           When he came to himselfe, he
said, &amp;c. v. 18.
                           I will arise, and goe to my Father,
and say, Father, I haue sinned
against heauen, and against
thee, &amp;c. v. 20.
                           And he arose, &amp; went to his Father;
but when he was yet a great
way off, his Father sawe him,
and had compassion, &amp; came, &amp; fell
on his neck,The theefe on the Crosse. and kissed him, v. 20.
                           And he said to Iesus, Lord remember
me when thou commest
into thy kingdome, Luk. 23. 41.
                           And Iesus said vnto him, Vetily
I say vnto thee; This day

shalt thou be with me in Paradise,
v. 43.
                           Him ye haue taken,
                              The Iewes that crucified, or consented to the crucifying of IESVS.
                               and by
wicked hands haue crucified and
slaine, Act. 2. 23.
                           Let all the house of Israel
know assuredly, that God hath
made that same Iesus whom yee
haue crucified both Lord and
Christ, v. 36.
                           Now when they heard this,
they were pricked in heart, and
said to Peter, and the rest of the
Apostles, Men and brethren,
what shall wee doe? verse
37.
                           Then Peter said, Repent, and
be baptized for the remission of
sins, v. 38.
                           Then they that gladly receiued
the Word were baptized; and the
same day were added vnto them
about three thousand soules, verse
41.
                           This is a faithfull saying, and
worthy of all acceptation, that
Christ Iesus came into the

world to saue sinners, of whom I
am chiefe, 1 Tim. 1. 15.
                           Howbeit for this cause I obtained
mercy, that in mee Iesus
Christ might first shew forth all
long suffering, for a patterne to
them which should hereafter
belieue on him to eternall life, v.
16.

                        wherein The humble and faithfull Christian

                              1 Layeth open his affliction
  
                                    In body.

                              3 Earnestly prayeth for 
  
                                    Audience.
                                    Sence of Gods fauour.
                                    Pardon for his sinne.

                              6 Commendeth his soule to God.
                              
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
O Lord God of my saluation,Layeth opē his afflictions in body and soule.
I haue cryed day
and night before thee, ô
let my prayer enter into thy
presence, Psal. 88. 1.
                     
                        For my soule is full of trouble,
and my life draweth nigh
vnto hell, v. 2.
                     
                     I am weary of my groaning;
euery night wash I my bed,
and water my couch with my
teares, Psal. 6. 6.
                     I am accounted as one that
goeth downe to the pit; I
haue bin as a man that hath no
strength, Psal. 88. 3.
                     Free among the dead like
vnto them that bee wounded,
and that lie in the graue, which
be out of remembrance, and cut
away from thine hand, v. 4.
                     Thine indignation lyeth
hard vpon me, and thou hast

                        vexed me with all thy stormes,
v. 6.
                     I am powred out like water,
and all my bones are out of
ioynt; my heart also in the
middest of my bowells is like
melted waxe, Psal. 22. 14.
                     My strength is dryed vp
like a potsheard, and my tongue
cleaueth to my gummes, and
thou shalt bring mee into the
dust of death, v. 13.
                     The sorrowes of death compasse
me, and the ouerflowings
of vngodlines make me afraid,
Psal. 18. 3.
                     The paines of hell come about
me; the Snares of death
ouertake me, v. 4.
                     Thine arrowes stick fast in
me, and thy hand presseth mee
sore, Psal. 38. 2.
                     There is no health in my
flesh because of thy displeasure;Confesseth.
                        
neither any rest in my bones
by reason of my sin, v. 3.
                     For my wickednesses are
gone ouer my head, and are
like a sore burden too heauy for
me to beare, v. 4.
                     If thou Lord wilt bee extreame
to marke what is done
amisse, ô Lord, who may abide
it? Psal. 130. 3.
                     
                        Out of the deepe haue I called
vnto thee ô Lord, Lord
heare my voice. v. 1.
                     
                     
                        O let thine eares consider
well the voice of my complaint,Prayeth for audience.
                        v. 2.
                     
                     
                        Lord,Sence of Gods fauour. why abhorrest thou
my soule, and hidest thy face
from me? Psal. 88. 14.
                     
                     I am in misery, and like to
him that is at the point to dye:
from my youth vp thy terrors
haue I suffered with a troubled
minde, v. 15.
                     
                        
Thy wrathfull displeasure
goeth ouer me; and the feare of
thee hath vndone me, v. 16.
                     Haue mercy vpon mee ô
God after thy great goodnesse;Pardon for his sin.
according to the multitude of
thy mercies doe away mine
offences, Psal. 51. 1.
                     
                        Wash me throughly from
my wickednesse, and clense me
from my sinne, v. 2.
                     
                        Cast me not away from thy
presence, and take not thy holy
Spirit from me, v. 11.
                     
                        O giue me the comfort of
thy helpe againe, and stablish
me with thy free Spirit, v. 12.
                     
                     Neuerthelesse I am alwaies
with thee,4 Acknowledgeth Gods mercies. for thou hast holden
me vp by thy right hand, Psal.
73. 23.
                     Thou shalt guide me by thy
counsell,5 Professeth trust. and after that receiue
me with glory, v. 24.
                     
                        
Whom haue I in heauen but
thee ô Lord? and I desire none
in earth in comparison of thee,
v. 23.
                     
                        Returne to thy rest ô my
soule,Desire of death. for the Lord hath rewarded
thee, Psal. 116. 7.
                     Thou hast put gladnesse in
my heart more then theirs,Ioy in the holy Ghost.
whose corne, and wine, and oyle
increaseth, Psal. 4. 8.
                     I will lay me downe,
                        Peace of conscience. and
take my rest; for it is thou Lord
onely that makest mee dwell in
safety, v. 9.
                     I will behold thy presence,
                        Assured hope of Eternall blisse.
and when I awake vp after
thy likenesse, I will bee satisfied
with it, Psal. 17. 16.
                     I shall be satisfied with the
plenteousnesse of thine house,
and thou shalt giue mee drinke
of thy pleasures as of the riuers,
Psal. 36. 8.
                     
                        
                        For with thee is the well
of life; and in thy light shall I
see light, v. 9.
                     
                     Thou shalt shew me the path
of life, in thy presence is fulnes
of ioy; and at thy right hand
there is pleasure for euermore,
Psal. 16. 12.
                     Into thy hands I commend
my Spirit,
                        6 Commendeth his soule to God. for thou hast redeemed
me ô Lord, thou God of
truth, Psal. 31. 6.
                  
                  
                     
                        A Prayer for the sicke lying at the mercy of God, and ready to depart.
                        AETernall, and omnipotent,
infinite, &amp; incomprehensible
God, Lord of
my life, and determiner of my
dayes: My body now is resoluing
into dust, and my soule returning
to thee that gauest it. O Lord most
holy, ô God most mighty, draw
neere vnto me, who make hast to

come vnto thee. Giue mee a
cleerer sight of thee, by how
much the neerer I am out of the
darke prison of my body. Giue
me also a quicker taste of the powers
of the life to come, that I may
more comfortably passe ouer
these last troubles of this present
life▪ O Lord, my soule is heauy euen
vnto death; for the weight of
al my sins aggrauated by the diuel
is at once vpon me; and I sink
and faint vnder this burdon which
is too heauy for me to beare. Neither
is there any meanes vnder heauen to
ease mee of it, but by laying it
vpon him that hath borne our infirmities
and carried our sorrowes.
O Father of mercy, and God of all
consolation, let not the guilt of my
sins or horror of thy iudgements,
or Sathans suggestions, or the
feare of death, or terrors of hell
driue me to desperation. I confesse
that for my vnmindfulnesse
of thee, and vngratefulnesse to
thee all my life, I deserue that

thou shouldest vtterly abandon
and forsake me now at my death.
But thy thoughts are not like our
thoughts, nor thy affections like
mine. Though a woman could forget
the fruit of her wombe, yet thou
wilt not nor canst not forget those
that trust in thee. Thy gifts and
graces are without repentance; and
whom thou louest, thou louest to the
end. Thou wilt not breake a bruised
reede, nor quench the smoking 
                                 •
                              lax.
Though thou hast seuerely corrected
me in this thy fearefull visitation;
yet thou hast not, and I
know wilt not giue me ouer to eternal
death. Deare Father, shew thy
strength in my greatest weakenes;
confirme thy mercy to me in my
greatest misery; apply thy comfort
to me in this my last extremity.
Asswage the paines of my
body with ghostly comforts; and
diminish the feare of death, by the
assured hope of a better life. Call
to my minde (whilest yet I
breathe) all the errors of my vnderstanding,

that I may timely
reuoke them; all the sins of my
will, that I may heartily bewaile
them; all the testimonies of thy
loue, that I may gratefully acknowledge
them; all the promises
of thy Gospell, that I may comfortably
embrace them; all my
holy vowes and purposes, that I
may finally confirme them; and
gracious Lord accept the will for
the deede. O let me that am now
returning to dust, and ashes, speake
but this once to my Lord &amp; maker.
With all my heart, soule, and
strength, I beseech thee, by all
that my Sauiour Iesus Christ hath▪
done and suffered for mee, I intreate
thee, speake peace to my soule
at her departing, and say vnto her,
I am thy saluatiō. Make my election
sure by my true repentance,
perfect charity, assured confidence,
constant patience, comfortable
perseuerance vnto the end,
and in the end.
                     
                     
                        
                        To the TRINITY.
                        GLorious Creator, gracious
Redeemer, euerlasting comforter,
Lord God Almighty,
send me ayde &amp; helpe from heauen
in this my last and most dreadfull
conflict with all the powers of
hell &amp; darknes. Arme me with thy
compleat armour, and endue mee
with power from aboue to vanquish
Sathan and his infernall
bands, and to quench all the fierie
darts of the wicked in the bloud
of my Redeemer. I am thine, ô
God the Father, by the right of
creation; I am thine, ô God the
Sonne, by the right of thy purchase;
I am thine, ô God the Holy
Ghost, by the right of thine inhabitation,
and possession. Saue
me, Father, by thy power: saue
me, Sonne, by thy merits: saue me
holy Spirit, by thy grace. O holy,
blessed and glorious Trinitie,
whose power no creature is able to

resist: Rebuke &amp; confound thine
enemy that goeth about to deface
thine Image in me; to spoile
thy creature; to destroy him
for whom thou, ô Sonne, offeredst
thy self on the Crosse by the
eternall Spirit to the Father. O
Father, be now to me a father in
my greatest need. O Iesus, be to
me a Iesus in my greatest danger.
O Comforter, bee to me a Comforter
in my greatest afflictions.
Holy &amp; Righteous Iudge eternall,
Sathan taketh aduantage of thy
fatherly chastising me; he grows
strong against mee by this my
great weaknesse. Now hee rageth
most furiously, because his
time is short. He assaulteth mee
euery way, by subtill suggestions,
by fearfull visions and apparitions.
Hee terrifieth my flesh
with the vgly shape of death; he
affrighteth my conscience with
the horror of the last iudgement,
and scorcheth my soule euen
with flashes of hell fire. O Father

of spirits, deliuer not the soule of thy
Turtle Doue (that mourneth to
thee day and night) as a prey vnto
him. Though neuer so deformed,
yet I am thy worke, O God my
Father; though neuer so vile,
yet I am thy purchase, ô God my
Redeemer: though neuer so polluted,
yet I am thy Temple, O
God my sanctifier. Faithful Creator,
preserue the worke of thine
hand; faithfull Redeemer, preserue
the purchase of thy bloud;
faithfull Sanctifier, preserue the
Temple of thine honour. I abhorre
my selfe in dust and ashes, and
I conceiue more grief then I am
able to expresse for abusing thy
workes, ô Father, thy Word and
Sacraments, ô Sonne, thy gifts &amp;
graces, ô Spirit Father forgiue
me all sinnes of infirmity against
thy power: Sonne forgiue me all
sinnes of ignorance against thy
wisedome; Holy Ghost forgiue
mee all sinnes of malice against
thy grace. Most mighty Father,
                           
giue mee thy protection; Most
mercifull Son, giue me thy peace;
Most gracious holy Spirit, giue
me thy comfort, that I may safely,
peaceably and cheerfully leaue
this vale of teares. Father, possesse
me of the kingdome which
thou, O Sonne hast purchased, and
thou, O Spirit, hast sealed vnto
mee. Into thy hands, O Father,
who breathedst into mee the Spirit
of life; Into thy hands, O Sonne,
who breathedst out thy Spirit for
mee; Into thy hand, ô Holy Spirit,
who renewedst a right spirit
within mee, and hast comforted
my spirit to the last gaspe, I now
commend my spirit, Amen.
                     
                     
                        
                        To the Lord IESVS, at the
howre of death.
                        VVElcom blessed houre,
the period of my pilgrimage,
the terme of
my bondage, the end of my
cares, the close of my sighs, the
bound of my trauels, the gole of
my race, and the hauen of my
hopes. I haue fought a long fight
in much weaknes; I haue finished
my course, though in great faintnesse;
and the crowne of my ioy
is, that, through the strength of
thy grace, I haue kept the true
faith, and now I dye in it. I willingly
resigne my flesh, I despise
the world, and I defie the diuell
who hath no part nor share in
mee. And now, what is my hope?
My hope, Lord Iesu, is euen in thee.
For I know that thou my Redeemer
liuest, and thou wilt immediatly
receiue my soule, and raise
vp my body also at the last day,
                           
and I shall see thee in my flesh with
these eyes, and none other. My
heart fainteth, my strength faileth,
my tongue faltereth. Lord let
thy Spirit of comfort helpe mine
infirmities, and make supplication
for mee with sighes and groanes
that cannot be expressed. I submit
my selfe wholly to thy will. I
commit my soule to thee as my
faithfull REDEEMER, who hast
bought mee with thy most precious
bloud. I professe to all the
world, I know no name vnder heauen,
by which I may be saued, but
thine my IESV, my Sauiour.
I renounce all confidence in merits
saue thine; I thankfully acknowledge
all thy blessings; I
vnfeinedly bewaile all my sinnes;
I stedfastly belieue all thy promises;
I heartily forgiue all mine enemies;
I willingly leaue all my
friends; I vtterly loath all earthly
comforts; I entirely long for
thy comming.
                        
                           
Come Lord Iesu; come quickly.
Lord Iesu receiue my Spirit.

                     GRacious Father,
who hast prouided
the sincere
milke of the Word
for New borne
babes in Christ; as
thou hast strong meate for them
that are of riper yéers, and iudgement,
and hast commended to the
dispensers of thy holy mysteries, as
well the care of feeding thy tender
Lambes, as thy well growne, and
stronger sheepe: Guide me by thy
holy spirit, that I may guide them
in the paths of righteousnesse, and
leade them to the waters of comfort,
flowing from the fountaine of
thy most pure and holy Word.

Season their tender yéeres with
true Religion; and powre into
these new vessels the new wine of
thy Gospell, that they sauour not
of the caske of the olde Man. Open
their hearts as thou openedst the
heart of Lydia, that they may attend
to those things that concerne
their eternall saluation. Sit thou
in the middest of vs here assembled,
as thou satest in the middest
of the Doctors in the Temple, opposing,
and answering them. Propound
such Questions by me, and
returne such Answers by them, as
may cleerely expresse to our vnderstanding,
and imprint in our memories
the necessary points of sauing
Truth, and foundations of
Christian Doctrine; and may
serue for the instruction of the
ignorant, admonition of the
learned, and the building
vp of vs all in our most
holy faith; So be it,
Amen.
