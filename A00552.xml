            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

               honor his name among the honor'd names
               
                  
Of beſt precedent Kings that euer ſtood,
               Renown'd for Wiſedome, and for doing good:
               Make him a ſecond Salomon, a peerleſſe Iemme,
               In theſe his Kingdomes, this his Ieruſalem:
               
               Lengthen his dayes, his treaſure ſtill increaſe,
               And let him liue, and dye, a King of peace.
            
            
               So bleſſe, O Lord, our high &amp; mighty Charles,
               
               And then the names of Barons, Peers and Earles▪
               
               The worthy Knights, and Gentry of this Land,
               That to this Worke doe ſet their helping hand.
               The Biſhops, Clergy, Citie, Country, All,

This Reu'rend Biſhop for his loue to vs,
               
                  Let him be famous as MAVRITIVS,
            
            
               Anno 1087. This Church of Saint Paul was much waſted by
fire; and worthy Mauritius here mentioned (then Biſhop of
London,) beganne a new foundation thereof, in manner as
now it is, vpon Arches and Vaults of ſtone, for defence of
fire. In which worke he continued a conſtant and a bountifull
Benefactor for 20 yeares together, and then dyed After
him (viz) Anno 1107 ſucceeded Biſhop 
                  
                     •
                  eaumer, who wonderfully
encreaſed the ſame Church for 20 yeares more, purchaſing
at his owne coſts the large Streets and Lanes round
about it, which he beganne to compaſſe about with a ſtrong
wall of ſtone, and Gates.
            
               
                  
Long liu'd as Nestor, and in euery way
               Happy and proſperous till his dying day;
               That ſtill he may this famous Church aduance,
               In gaining her both Coine and Countenance,
               Till ſuch a noble Regiſter be ſeene
               Of Benefactors, as hath neuer beene
               In any age or any worke before,
               And till he ſay, Enough, there needs no more.
               
            
            
               And cauſe no mourning in our ſtreets may be,
               With ſuch as feare demoliſhment to ſee.
               Lord for thy Names ſake, let it be thy pleaſure,
               The rather to encreaſe that pious Treaſure,
               
                  
That euery one may haue ſome ſatisfaction,
               To gaine their prayers in ſo good an action,
               And that two Noble workes together may
               Be brauely done, to all true Subiects ioy;
               And through the world this fame may euer ring,
               
                  Pitty did raigne in Biſhop, Lord, and King;
               
               
                  Mercy and Iuſtice were ſo met in one,
               
               
                  That Iuſtice (ſcarce) from Mercy could be knowne.
               
            
            
               
                  So, for a Nation pittifull and loyall,
               
               
                  Great Britaine ſhall winne praiſe paſt all deniall.
               
               
                  No man ſhall need to grieue, or to lament,
               
               
                  For's place of Cuſtome, or Demoliſhment:
               
               
                  
                  And bleſſings many will the Worke attend,
               
               
                  From the beginning to the very end.
               
            
            
               But yet, though pitty here we doe requeſt,
               That none may thinke themſelues too much oppreſt
               Let ſuch as muſt depart their houſes know
               No winde ſo calme or warme did euer blow,
               Nor euer was a Worke ſo good as this,
               But that with ſome it blew or went amiſſe.
            
            
               Then ſith herein the wind blowes ſomwhat ill
               For ſuch as ioyne to Pauls againſt her will;
               That haue impair'd her ſtrength by vaults &amp; cellars
               To make more roome for Buyers and for Sellers;
               
                  
Let them with patience endure ſome loſſe,
               And for the Worke ſake beare a little croſſe;
               Not grudgingly, or by pronouncing wrong,
               Cauſe ther's their Cuſtom, there they liued long

                  or though deſire of gaine's a grieuous Tempter
               There is a Prouerb bids them Caueat Emptor.
               
               And ne'retheleſſe their Cuſtome and their trade,
               This Houſe of God muſt new againe be made.
            
            
               Was it not example ſcurrilous and rude,
               At firſt to grant that trades ſhould there intrudel
               Nay are they not accurſed, that did yeeld
               To make Gods Courts a merchandizing field?
               
                  
May we not call them beaſts, euen to their faces,
               That like bruit beaſts defile ſuch ſacred places?

                  ous vſes,
               Is't fit that they ſhould ſuffer foule abuſes?
               Is there no ciuill difference or ods,
               Twixt cleane and vnclean things, mans houſe &amp; Gods?
               Shold Chriſtians bones be dig'd out of their graues
               And laid with dogs bones in the fields by knaues,
               That ſo more roome vnder the Church foundation,
               May be for A-iaxe in a beaſtly faſhion?
               No eaſment but againſt the Temple-wals?
               No other place to piſſe, or make Layſtals?
               
                  
No way to paſſe with burthens, but throgh Pauls
               
               wher burthend cōſciences ſhold eaſe their ſoules?
               And' cauſe ſhe is materiall, as men tearme her,
               Is it materiall therefore they ſhould harme her?
            
            
               Looke well about thee Reader, and then ſee
               Whether ſuch things as theſe ought ſo to be:
               And after due conſideration had, then tell
               If therewithall God can be pleaſed well:
               Or if there doe belong no curſe or woe,
               To ſuch as firſt gaue way to wrong her ſo:
               Or if it were a credit to our Nation,
               At all to grant ſo baſe a toleration:
               
                  
For we doe know thou wilt agree with vs,
               To hold it vile and ſacrilegious:
               And all good men that after looke vpon her,
               Will ſay, 'tis to this Land a great diſhonor.
            
            
               O that we had ſuch gifts of tongue and pen,
               As there is giuen to ſome ſonnes of Men;
               That by perſwaſiue reaſons we might winne
               Th' abuſers of Gods houſe to know their ſinne:
               That with their Soules they might no longer flatter
               But vnderſtand it is a haynous matter;
               And will be puniſhed before mens eyes,
               When all things wronged ſhall in iudgment riſe:
               
                  
But we are blockiſh yet, not paſt our letters,
               And (being diuine) we leaue it to our Betters.
            
            
               SO now you Workmen, liſten what we ſay,
               You are ſo call'd by work, and not by play)
               If euer you were Maſters of your Trade,
               Make this beſt Maſter-peece that ere you made.
               'Tis for the Church, and therefore doe not ſpare
               Your beſt aduice, skill, diligence and care:
               And as (ſome wayes) you ſtand on reputation,
               So labour now to get the commendation:
               
                  
Not for precedency, leſt then you erre,
               For all
                     〈◊〉
                  s one here, both Free and Forreyner;
               And as ſhe doth receiue all ſorts to prayer,
               So any Worke-man, any good Surueyor,
               She may retaine to gaine her Reparation,
               As for the Church is vs'd in euery Nation.
               And yet we hold it were both ſinne and pitty
               Sith Work-men liue in this renowned Citie,
               Good Artiſts, honeſt, paying ſcot and lot,
               If more then others they ſhould be forgot;
               But rather be preferr'd in ſome degree
               Before a Stranger, whatſoe're he be.
               
                  
And' cauſe our Writer a poore Free-man is,
               We hope theſe words no man can take amiſſe;
               For what he write's according to his oath,
               Which to infringe we know he will be loath;
               That is, the Cities honor to maintaine,
               And alſo to aduance Her honeſt gaine.
            
            
               So once againe we doe reuiue our Muſe,
               And to all workmen doe more counſell vſe;
               Learne by the Scriptures what you ought to doe
               Let them direct your hands and conſcience to;
            
            
               
                  Ezra, Ne'miah, Chronicles and Kings,
               
               And Haggai vvill ſhew you many things:
               
                  
How iuſtly men did worke about the Temple,
               Which there is Regiſtred for your example;
               And with what ioy and loue they did proceed,
               The Booke of God will ſhew you if you reade;
               For happy was that man that could deuiſe
               Moſt curious worke to grace that Edifice:
               Or hee whoſe purſe or perſon could preſent
               Ought that might help to make Her excellent.
               Lead, timber, ſtone, braſſe, iron, ſome men gaue;
               Some lyme, ſome ſand, ſome glaſſe, to make her braue▪
               
               And Laborers, like Bees, did labor truly,
               Obſeruing all their times and houres moſt duly.
            
            
               
                  
Then if your owne gaine you doe only plod,
               You are vnworthy for the Houſe of God;
               For if you worke by taske-worke, or by day,
               Your pay ſhall be as iuſt as ere was pay;
               And therefore 'tis expected you ſhould bee
               Not ſparing in your worke, but francke and free.
            
            
               Some men there are will maintain to ones face,
               (But ſuch we hold both lewd and very baſe)
               That in a worke for King or Church they may
               Trifle the time by loytring and delay.
            
            
               Some will be working hard, but when d'ee thinke?
               Iuſt when they haue no come, or truſt for drinke;
               
                  
Or when the Clocke is neare the ſtroke eleuen,
               And ſay they haue ſo wrought e're ſince 'twas ſeauen,
               Or when ſome Officer they doe eſpie,
               That otherwiſe caſhiers them preſently.
            
            
               Some with their Rules do fidle vp and downe,
               As if they did more worke then all the towne:
               But mark them wel, &amp; giue them their due check
               For one weeks work, almoſt three daies they lack
            
            
               Some ſpend much time in finding fault, and ſo
               To picke a thanke will nimbly runne or goe,
               Till at the laſt, the ſeed which they haue ſowne,
               Brings forth a fruit more fit to be their owne.
               
                  
Some haue the gift of working more then ſome,
               Vntill a holiday, or Sunday come.
               But then vvhat they haue got ſixe dayes before,
               They vvill conſume it, if'tvvere ten times more:
               Mean while poor vvines &amp; children liue ful bare
               Hoping vvhen husbands come of better fare,
               And they returne vvhen all the vvorke is done
               As poore as Iob, or as the 
                     Ʋnthriſt Sonne.
               
            
            
               Some haue their jobs to doe in other places,
               And ſo they vvorke like Ianus vvith tvvo faces;
               And from that taske that longeſt vvill remaine,
               They oftentimes an houre or tvvo vvill gaine.
               
                  
But hee that in this worke proues ſuch a lobber,
               Is but a kinde of Sacrilegious Robber.
            
            
               Others, at euery one that by them walke,
               Will to their fellowes haue ſome thing to talke:
               &amp; while their tongues are tatling, 'tis their courſe
               To hold their hands, and that is ten times worſe.
            
            
               So there are other ſome▪ that for a need,
               When hempe is ſcarce, will onely buy gape-ſeed,
               And looke about as if nought were their taske,
               But for to anſwer all that men will aske,
               And thinke it is a colour fit t'excuſe
               The precious time they wrongfully abuſe.
               
                  
Theſe, like ſome Schollers that are ſent to ſchools
               Haue a good conſcience, though not little fooles;
               And make Pauls-worke, the Prouerb true doth ſtand,
               Of euery little thing they take in hand:
               With whom to liue a faithfull Clarke ath' works,
               As good goe dwell with Saracens and Turkes.
               But now we thinke no man will be ſo rude.
               And thus in charitie wee doe conclude.
            
            FINIS.
         
         
            
            
            Pauls merrily,
yet modeſtly.
            
               IF Preachers now will ſpeake for me,
               In Pariſh-Churches where they be,
               And all good hearts agree in one,
               Then farewell my Complaint and moane.
            
            
               Our good King Iames, he hath begunne,
               And eke Prince Charles his onely Sonne:
               With many' a Noble Lord and Peere,

               O follow ſuch braue Leaders then,
               All you braue-minded Engliſh-men:
               For what you giue it is not loſt,
               But brings a bleſsing for your coſt.
