            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

                  That was a Roſe is than a thorne

                  His dome was nought ſo hard lad
                  For loue put reſon awey

                  The good men in erthe hym hate

                  Of that he ſemeth euer vnglad
                  He is not able to be had

                  That kynde may no proufyte wynne

                     And ſuche pyte within engendreth
                  And that hym was leuer for to cheſe
                  His owne body for to leſe
                  Than ſee ſo grete a mordre wrought
                  Vpon the blood which gylteth nought
                  Thus for the pyte whiche he toke
                  Al other leches he forſoke
                  And put hym oute of auenture
                  Al only in to goddes cure
                  And ſayth who that wol mayſter be

                  So ferforth he was ouercome

                  And bad vnto his treſorers
                  That they his treſour al aboute
                  Departe among the pouer route
                  And of wymmen &amp; of chyldren bothe

                  Withoute loſſe of ony greyne
                  Thorugh charyte thus he dyſpendeth

                  A lord wel may the man be Ryche
                  Whome that a kyng lyſt to ryche

                     And thus they maden wordes fele
                  Wherof this lord hath hede nome
                  And dyde hem both for to come
                  To the paleys where he ſhal ete
                  And bad ordeyne for her mete
                  Two paſteyes whiche he lete do make
                  And a capon in that one was bake
                  And in that other for to wynne
                  Of floreyns al that▪ may within
                  He lete do put a grete Rycheſſe
                  And euen as lyche as myght geſſe
                  Outward they were bothe two
                  This begger was commaunded tho

                  That other / whiche his felawe toke
                  But when he wyſt hou that it ferde
                  He ſeyth aloude that men it herde
                  Now am I certaynly conceyued
                  
                  That he may lyghtly be deceyued
                  
                  That tryſteth vnto mans helpe
                  But wel is hym that god wol helpe
                  For he ſtant on the ſyker ſyde
                  Whiche elles ſhold goo beſyde
                  I ſee my felawe wel recouer

                  And pouer he cam &amp; pouer he went
                  Of that he hath Rycheſſe ſought
                  His infortuue it wold nought

                  The chaunce is caſt vpon a dee

                     And nouȝt for loue as ſeyth the book
                  A ryche marchaunt of the lond

                  And ſet his honour fer behynde
                  Thus he whome gold hath ouerſet
                  Was trapped in his owne net
                  The gold hath made his wyttes lame
                  Soo that ſechend his owne ſhame
                  He rouneth in the kynges ere
                  And ſeyd that he wyſte where

                  For but yf it be thurgh grete beyete
                  Of gold he ſeyd he ſhold not ſpede
                  The kyng hym bad vpon the nede
                  That take an honderd pound he ſhold
                  
                  
                     And yeue it where that he wolde
                  Be ſo it were in worthy place
                  And thus to ſtonde in loues grace
                  This king his gold hath habandouned

                  IN grece whylome was a kyng
                  Of whom the fame &amp; knoulechyng
                  Byleueth yet &amp; peleus

                  To regne after his deceſſe
                  He had a broder netheles
                  Whos ryght name was Eſon
                  And he hath the worthy knyght Iaſon
                  Bygoten / in whiche in euery lond

                  In armes ſo that he the beſt
                  Was named &amp; the worthyeſt
                  He ſought worſhyp oueral
                  Now herkne &amp; I the telle ſhal
                  An auenture that he ſought
                  Whiche afterward ful dere he bought
               
               
                  There was an Ile whiche Colchos
                  Was cleped &amp; therof awos
                  Grete ſpeche in londe aboute
                  That ſuche meruayle was none oute
                  In al the wyde world nowhere
                  As tho in that Ile there
                  There was a ſhepe as it was told
                  
                  The whiche his flees bare al of gold
                  
                  And ſo the goddes had it ſette
                  That it ne myght a wey be fette
                  By power of no worldes wyght
                  And yet ful many a worthy knyght
                  At had aſſayed as they dorſt
                  And euer it fel hem to the worſt
                  But he that wold it nought forſake
                  But of his knyghthode vndertake
                  To doo what thyng therto belongeth
                  This worthy Iaſon ſore alongeth
                  
                     To ſee the ſtraunge regyons
                  
                     And knowe the condycyous
                  Of other / marches where he went
                  And for that cauſe his hoole entent
                  He ſet Colchos for to ſeke
                  And therupon he dyde▪ ſpeke
                  To Peleus his eme the kyng
                  And he wel payd was of that thyng
                  
                  And ſhope anone for his paſſage
                  Suche as were of his lygnage
                  With other knyghtes whiche he chees
                  With hym he toke &amp; Hercules
                  Whiche ful was of chyualrye
                  With Iaſon wente in companye
                  And that was in the moneth of may
                  When colde ſtormes were away
                  The wynd was good ye ſhyp was yare
                  They took hyr leue &amp; forth they fare
                  
                     Toward Colchos but on the weye
                  What hem byfelle is long to ſeye
                  Hou Lamedon the kyng of Troye
                  Whiche ought wel haue made hem ioyr
                  When they to reſt a whyle hym preide
                  Oute of his lond he hem congeyde
                  And ſo felle the dyſſencyon
                  Whiche afterward was deſtructyon
                  Of that cyte as men may here
                  But that is not to my matere
                  But thus this worthy folk gregoys
                  Fro that kyng which was not curtois
                  And fro his land with ſeyl vpdrawe
                  Then̄e went hem forth &amp; many a ſawe
                  They made &amp; many a grete manace
                  Tyl at laſt in to that place
                  Whiche as they ſought they arryue
                  And ſtryken ſeyle &amp; forth as blyue
                  They ſenten vnto the kyng &amp; tolden
                  Who were there &amp; what they wolden
                  Oetes whiche than was kyng
                  When that he herd this tydyng
                  Of Iaſon whiche was comen there
                  And of theſe other what they were
                  He thought done hem grete worſhyp
                  For they anone come oute of ſhyp
                  And ſtrayt vnto the kyng they went
                  And by the hand Iaſon he hent
                  And that was at the paleys gate
                  So fer on the kyng cam on his gate
                  Toward Iaſon to done hem chere
                  And he whom lakketh no manere
                  When he the kyng ſawe in preſence
                  Yafe hym ageyn ſuche reuerence
                  As to a kynges ſtate belongeth
                  And thus the kyng hym vnderfongeth
                  And Iaſon in his arme he caught
                  And forth in to the halle he ſtraught
                  And there they ſat &amp; ſpeke of thyngis
                  And Iaſon told hym tho tydyngys
                  Why he was come &amp; fayre hym prayde
                  To haſte his tyme &amp; the kyng ſayde
                  Iaſon thou art a worthy knyght
                  But it lyeth in no mans myght
                  To done that thou art come fore
                  There hath be many a knyght forlore
                  Of that they wolden it aſſaye
                  But Iaſon hym wold not eſmaye
                  And / ſeyd of / euery / worldes cure

                  Parauenter wel parauenter woo

                  It ſhal be with myn hond aſſayed
                  
                  The kyng tho helde hym not wel paid
                  For he the grekes ſore dredde
                  In aunter yf Iaſon ne ſpedde
                  He myght therof here a blame
                  For tho was al the worldes fame
                  In Grece as for to ſpeke of armes
                  For thy he drad hym of his harmes
                  And gan to preche hym &amp; to preye
                  But Iaſon wold not obeye
                  But ſayd he wold his purpoos holde
                  For ought that ony man hym tolde
                  When the kyng theſe wordes herde
                  And ſawe how that the knyȝt anſuerde
                  Yet for he wold make hym glad
                  After Medea gone he had
                  Whiche was his doughter &amp; ſhe cam
                  And Iaſon whiche good hede nam
                  When he hyr ſawe ageyn hyr goth
                  And ſhe which was hym nothing loth
                  
                     Welcomed hym in to that londe
                  And ſofte took hym by the honde
                  
                     And doune they ſeten bothe ſame
                  She had herd ſpoke of his name
                  And of his grete worthynes
                  For thy ſhe gan hyr eye inpreſſe
                  Vpon his face &amp; his ſtature
                  Aud thought hou neuer creature
                  Was ſo welfarend as was he
                  And Iaſon ryght in ſuche degre
                  Nc myght not withholde his look
                  But ſo good hede on hyr he took
                  That hym ne thouȝt vnder the heuene
                  Of beaute ſaw he neuer hyr euene
                  With al that felle to womanhede
                  Thus eche of other took hede
                  Though there was no word of record
                  
                  Here hertes bothe of one acord
                  Ben ſet to loue but as tho
                  There myghten be no wordes mo
                  The kyng hym made grete joye &amp; feſt
                  To al his men he yaf an heſt
                  So as they wol his thank deſerue
                  That they ſholde al Iaſon ſerue
                  Whyle that he wold there duelle
                  And thus the day ſhortely to telle
                  With many myrthes is dyſpent
                  Tyl nyght was come &amp; tho they went
                  Echone of other took his leue
                  When they no lenger myghten leue
                  A not hou Iaſon that nyght ſlepe
                  But wel I wote that of the ſhepe
                  For whiche he cam in to that yle
                  He thought but a lytel whyle
                  Al was medea that be thought
                  Soo that m many wyſe he thought
                  His wyt wakend or it was daye
                  Somtyme ye ſomtyme nay
                  Somtyme thus ſomtyme ſo
                  As he was ſtyred to &amp; fro
                  Of loue &amp; eke of his conqueſt
                  As he was holde of his heſte
                  And thus he roos vp by the morowe
                  And took hym ſeynt Iohn to borow
                  And ſayd he wold fyrſt begynne
                  At loue &amp; after for to wynne
                  The flees of gold for whiche he come
                  And thus to hym good hert he nome
               
               
                  Medea ryght in the ſame wyſe
                  Tyl day cam that ſhe muſt ryſe
                  Lay &amp; bythought hyr al the nyght

                  For yf he deyde of his bataylle
                  She moſt than algate fayle
                  To geten hym when he were dede
                  Thus ſhe vygan to ſette rede
                  And torne aboute her wyttes al
                  To loke hou it myght falle
                  That ſhe with hym bad a leyſer

                  And ſhe his tale goodly herd
                  And afterward ſhe hym anſuerd
                  
                  And ſeyd Iaſon as thou wylt

                  If thou wolt holde couenaunt
                  To loue of al the remenaunt
                  I ſhal thy lyf &amp; honour ſaue

                  Youre heſt whyle my lyf may laſt
                  Thus long he prayd &amp; at laſt
                  She graunteth &amp; hyght hym this

                  She wold hym ſende certeynly
                  Suche one that ſhold hym pryuely
                  A lone in to hyr chambre brynge
                  He thanketh hyr of that tydyng

                  A mayden fro Medea came
                  And to Chambre Iaſon ledde
                  Where that he fond redy the ledde

                  Kyng mynos had in his kepyng
                  A cruel monſtre as ſeith the geſte
                  For he was half man &amp; half beeſte
                  And mynotaurus he was hote
                  The whiche was bigoten in a ryote
                  Vppon Phaſyfe his owne wyf
                  Whiles he was oute vpon the ſtrif
                  Of that greete ſyege of Troye
                  But ſhe that loſt hath al ioye

                  And it felle that ſame tyme thus
                  There was a Clerk one Dedalus
                  That had ben of hir aſſent
                  Of that hir world hath myſwent
                  As he that made of his owne wyt

                  There was ſoo many a dyuerſe went
                  That he ne ſhall come oute
                  But go amaſyd al aboute
                  And in this hows to loke &amp; warde
                  Was mynotaurus put in warde

                  And in this wiſe many one
                  Of Athenys for truage
                  
                     Deuoured were in that rage

                  He was a knyght worthy with al

                  He ferd as though he took no hede
                  But al that euer he myght ſpede
                  With hym &amp; with his felauſhip
                  Forth in to grece he goth by ſhip
                  Where that the kyng mynos he ſought

                  And put hym in to diſciplyne
                  Of mynotaure to be deuoured
                  But Theſeus was ſo fauoured
                  
                  That he was kepte till at the laſt

                  And had herd the worthy los
                  Of Theſeus and of his myght

                  Bitwene Athenis &amp; hem of Crete
                  But now to ſpeke of that ſwete
                  The whos beaute was withoute wane
                  This fayre mayden Adryane
                  When ſhe ſaw Theſeus ſounde
                  Was neuer yet vppon this grounde
                  A gladder wyght than ſhe was tho
                  Theſeus dwellyd a day or two

                  Al pryuely bytwene hem twey
                  The firſt floure he took awey

                  And thus his purpoos he acheuyth
                  So that aſſured of his trouthe

                  Forgate within a litel throwe
                  So that it was al ouerthrowe
                  When that ſhe wend that it ſhold ſtonde
                  The ſhip was blowen fro the londe
                  Wherin they lay ſailend there
                  This Adryan had mochel fere

                  But that was nothyng for hir beſt
                  For when ſhe was to londe brought
                  The whiche at yt tyme thought nouȝt
                  But al trouthe &amp; took no kepe

                  But certes ſhe was euyl matched
                  And fer from all loues kynde
                  For more than the beſt vnkynde
                  Theſeus the whiche no trouthe kept
                  While that this yonge lady ſlept
                  
                     Fulfylled of his vnkyndeſhip
                  Hath forgeten al godeſhyp
                  The whiche Adryan had hym done
                  And he bad the ſhypmen ſoone
                  Hale vp the ſaile &amp; not abyde

                  He left his lady in the ſtronde
                  Slepend til that ſhe awoke
                  But whan that ſhe caſt vp hyf loke

                  Where ſo ſhe biheld the ſee at large
                  She ſawe no ſhip / ſhe ſawe no barge

                  This worthy knyȝt hath done &amp; wroȝt
                  I wend I had his loue bought
                  And ſo deſerued at nede
                  When that he ſtode vppon his drede
                  And alſo the loue he me behyght
                  It is grete wondre how he myght
                  Towardes me now be vnkynde
                  And ſoo to lete out of his mynde
                  Thyng that he ſaid his owne mouthe
                  But after this whan it is couthe
                  And drawen to the worldes fame
                  It ſhalle be hynderyng for his name
                  For wel he wote and ſoo wote I
                  He gaf his trouth bodyly
                  That he my honoure ſhold kepe

                  Hyr fair treſſes ſhe to drough
                  And with hyr ſelf ſhe took ſuche a ſtrif

                  Swounend lay ful oft among

                  Al though he were a noble knyght
                  For he the lawe of loues ryght
                  Forfeyted hath for alwey

               So that to fore ne behynde
               He ſeeth no thyng but as the blynde
               Withoute inſight of his courage
               He doth mecuayles in his rage
               To what thyng that he will hym draw

               Ful many a thyng he doeth
               That were better to be laft
               Among the whiche is ſuche craft

               Fro thie day ferth to take reſte
               That I nomore of loue make
               Which many a horte hath ouertake

               How to gouerne his owne eſtate

               Within hym ſelf &amp; can not leue
               And thus for thy my ſynal leue
               I take now for euermore
               Without makyng ony more
               Of loue &amp; of his dedely hele
               Which no phyſycyen can hele
               For his nature is ſo dyuers
               That it hath euer ſomme trauers
               Or of to moche or of to lyte
               That playnly may no man delyte
               For hym fayleth or that or this
               But thylke loue which that is
               Within a mannes herte affermed
               
               
                  And ſtante of charyte conformed
               Suche loue is goodly for to haue
               Suche loue may the body ſaue
               Suche loue may the ſelvle amende
               The hyghe god ſuche loue vs ſende
               Forthwith the remenaunte of grace
               So that aboue in thylke place
               Where reſteth loue &amp; al pees
               Our ioye may be endelees
