            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

            ¶ TO THE RIGHT honorable, Edward de Ʋere, Earle of Oxenford, vicount Bulbecke, Lord of Eſcales and Bladeſmere, and Lord great Chamberlaine of England.
            
               EXperience beareth ſuch a ſoueraigntie ouer all thinges humane and diuine, that without it the quality or power either of worde, deede, deuiſe, or matter, cannot make it ſelfe knowen to the vnderſtanding of mē: for the heauenly trueth iuſtifieth it ſelfe by the effects of his nature and power, made apparant to the eyes &amp; capacities of earthly creatures.
            
               Adam not well ſtaid vpō the trueth of Gods word, tranſgreſſed the cōmandement, &amp; feeling the plagues of his offence, had thereby experience of the power &amp; trueth of his Almightie Creator.
            The firſt worlde ouerflowing in wickedneſſe, was drowned in the flood of Gods vengeance: to geeue experience to the world that enſued, what it is to contemne his worde and Prophets.
            
               
               Noah beleeued the word of the Lord, and obeying his commandement, prepared the Arke &amp; was ſaued in the flood, he &amp; all his family: by experience wherof the world is made to vnderſtand the power and aſſurance of Gods trueth and fauour towarde his elect people.
            The Lord willed Moſes to denounce his plagues againſt Egypt, and in the effect of his power &amp; trueth he accompliſhed the ſame vpon man and beaſt, vpon fruit and tree, vpon earth and water: the experience whereof made Moſes and the Iſraelites ſo hardie in fayth, that they tooke their way through the red Sea, as through the fieldes on drie land.
            
               Pharao in the hardneſſe of his heart purſued the Iſraelites, and was drowned, he and all his armie in the pathes where Iacob went drye ſhod▪ whereby all the kings and princes of the earth had &amp; haue experience, what it is to contemne God, to perſecute his people, &amp; to deſpiſe his worde and miniſters.
            The like experience made Ioſuah bolde to lead Iſrael through the deepe waters of Iorden: where they paſſed on foot, and went dry ſhod to land.
            The Iſraelites breaking the couenant of the Lorde their God, &amp; ſtanding in their rebellion were deſtroied out of the land of Iudah, and Ieruſalem, and made ſlaues to the Chaldeans: whereby they were taught by experience (and ſo are wee by the ſame example) what it is to deſpiſe the Lord of hoſtes, and to ſtand in diſobedience againſt his maieſtie.
            The Lord reſtoring Iacob out of Chaldea to his inheritance againe, according as he had promiſed by the mouthes of his Prophets: doth teach vs by experience

how faithfull he is in his promiſes, that we therefore ſhould reſt vpon him without doubting.
            Chriſt our Sauiour wrought wonders before all Iſrael, that their eyes might ſee his diuine power and beleeue him for his works ſake: but they beleeued not their owne eyes, and are therefore confounded by the experience that teſtifieth againſt their owne conſciences.
            By examples of experience, the Lord Ieſus taught the Iewes, as by that of Diues and Lazarus, of the ſower of ſeed, of the euill Steward &amp;c. As by familiar demonſtrations.
            Our forefathers the olde Chriſtians, ſo polluted their Tabernacles with the workes of impietie, that they extinguiſhed the holy Ghoſt in the Sanctuarie, whereby they fell to ignorance and corruption▪ and were giuen ouer to ſuperſtition and Idolatrie. The experience whereof ſhould teache vs of theſe dayes, and our children to walke wiſely in the preſence of our God.
            Experience diſcouereth the effects of wiſdome and folly: and maketh demonſtration of the fruits of vertue and of vice, and teacheth to diſtinguiſhe, betwixt the righteous and the wicked, betwixt the foole and the wiſe man, &amp;c.
            Experience is the mother and nurſe of the policies and gouernements, ciuill and martiall, priuate &amp; publike, guiding the counſailes and doinges of men with orderly diſcretion.
            Experience of the inordinate iniquities of mē fuonded the lawes and the iudgement ſeat.
            The experience of the troubleſome furies of men

founded Armes, and aduaunced Militarie profeſſion, for the repreſſing and reſtraining of the tyrannies and noyfull malice of the wicked.
            The experience of the profit and value of lawe and armes, maketh al prudent ſtates and commonwelths, to embrace and to vphold them both with much care and endeuour.
            So to conclude, experience is the ordinarie companion and naturall ornament of reaſon, which maketh mē wiſe in knowledge, &amp; prudent in the direction and vſe of things. He therefore that iudgeth or directeth againſt experience, is not in deede a man, but a foole more ignorant then a beaſt.
            The experience of other mens harmes, warneth the wiſe to be ware.
            The experience of forren euils, warneth England to waken it ſelfe out of ſecuritie, and to be watchfull, and wiſely to take it ſelfe.
            Experience hath taught me to loue and to honour armes, and in the zeale of a good heart to couet the aduancement of martial occupation, which made me (an vnlettered man) to take vnto me a notarie to ſette downe in writing this drift in the defence and praiſe of warlike proweſſe, againſt al cōtemners of the ſame: for the benefite and encouragement of my countrie &amp; countrimen.
            And finally, the experience of the high noblenes &amp; honour of you, my ſinguler good Lord, doth enboldē me (in the loue of a faithful hart, to your renoumed vertues) moſt humbly to commend this litle work to your honorable protection, that vnder the ſhielde of your noble fauour and iudgement, it may ſtande in

grace before our nation, to ſome good effect. God graunt it. To whom be praiſe, &amp; to your good Lordſhippe, abundaunce of heauenly graces, and fatherly bleſſings, euen to euerlaſting life. Amen. London. 23 Decemb. 1578.

            ¶ The defence of Militarie Profeſsion.
            
            
               IT hath bene an old controuerſie in the opinions of the Engliſh nation, what profeſſion of life is moſt honorable in worldly ſtates.VVhat worldly eſtate moſt honorable They being Ilanders, what by their famous might and proweſſe, and what by the naturall ſafetie of the ſituation of their Soyle, (enuironed with the maine Ocean ſea, and dwelling in greater ſecuritie, then any one nation that inhabiteth the continent) they may reaſonably differ from the iudgement both of Greekes &amp; Romanes in diſcuſſing this queſtion. For it may well be granted, that the profeſſion and occupation that is moſt in vſe, and moſt neceſſarie for the maintenance and preſeruation of the common wealth, that the ſame ſhould be had moſt in honoure, ſtanding moſt in vſe and value. England therefore dwelling in ſafetie and commonly in peace, may ſéeme to giue the preheminence vnto the lawer: For by his wiſedome and trauel is iuſtice miniſtred, to the maintenance and aduauncement of ſouereigne authoritie: by the benefite of whoſe maieſty, Reuenge

and Tyrannie is forbidden in publique and priuate, euery iniurie and quarell committed to the iudgement and direction of the law: that the vnnaturall rage and furies of ye mightie, of the cruel, &amp; of the wicked, being reſtrained and repreſſed, ſociall vnitie and vniuerſall obedience may be nouriſhed and holden in the ciuil felowſhip of men: ſo that the Lambe may ſucke ſafely by the Wolfe, the Calfe by the Leoparde, and the Aſſe féede quietly by the Lion, &amp;c. And happie is the ſtate where this is accompliſhed by the induſtrie and prudence of the peaceable Lawyer. But foraſmuch as the thoughtes of man are wicked euen from his youth, and all his wayes naturally inclined to extreme euill, deſirous to ſatiſfie his owne luſts and affections with iniurie and crueltie, to reuenge, and to reigne in hisThe onely meane to vpholde the ſeat of Iuſtice, &amp; all other eſtates, is the profeſſion of Armes. owne will and power without correction, and yeldeth not vnto the obedience and direction of any other but for feare of ſtripes: There muſt bee therefore an other ſtate and profeſſion of men, whoſe power and prudence muſt comprehend the maintenaunce and defence, not onely of the Seate of Juſtice, but alſo of the Cowe and Plowe, of the Bed and Cradle, yea of the Altar and of the ſouereigne ſtate: which reſteth in the profeſſion neither of the Prieſt nor Lawyer, nor in the occupation of the Houſbandmen, Artiſans nor Merchants: but lieth in the proweſſe and value of them that profeſſe Armes. For when Preaching, proceſſe, Plee, or Perſwaſion cannot preuaile, in reforming the euils and outrages of the wicked: then muſt the ſword of violence be put in execution, by the hands of them that are able, and ſkilfull to abaſe and to extinguiſh the furies of tumults and Rebellions: and either to bring to obedience the diſordered multitude, or elſe to cut them off from the earth, that peace and ciuill iuſtice may poſſeſſe and rule all the lande, to the reſtitutiō and preſeruation of domeſtical concord and

Societie, without the which mankinde ſhoulde decay from the face of the earth, &amp; the reſt that remained in the worlde, ſhould be in more miſerable ſtate then the wilde beaſts of the deſert. And as it is proued by experience in all ages, that Juſtice and Ciuil pollicie is not ſurely ſeated without ye ayde &amp; attendance of Martial gard: So is it to be ſene, that where military proweſſe hath in any part of the worlde moſte preuailed, thereVVhere militarie proweſſe preuaileth iuſtice floriſheth &amp; al vertues hath orderly moſt flouriſhed, Juſtice, Nobleneſſe, Science and all manner of vertuous and commendable occupations both of body &amp; minde. Witnes of Greece, Italie, and France, and nowe laſt of Germany. Whereupon this is to be cōcluded, yt as Juſtice is not of it ſelf able to ſet vp it ſelfe in authoritie, and to exerciſe rule ouer the multitude of Adams rebellious and ſtiffenecked broode, without the friendſhip &amp; ayde of Armes: ſo muſt wee eſtéeme martial proweſſe, as the common fortreſſe, wherein ciuill Policie with all her partes and appendants, are hatched, nouriſhed, &amp; preſerued: for the orderly nouriſhment and preſeruation of Man and Beaſt, of Fiſhe and Foule, of Fire and Salte, of Earth &amp; Water. Where this benefit wanteth, there wanteth Science and gouernement, without which, the whole worlde woulde ſoone become a deſolate wilderneſſe, ewithout man to manure or to inhabite it. So that the wickedneſſe and tranſgreſſions of men being the founder and mother of humane lawes and pollicies, we muſt giue moſt honourable place to that profeſſion and occupation, that is moſte of force and value to chaſtiſe the wickednes of the wicked, and to vphold the righteous: to preſerue the weaklings &amp; little ones, and to giue frée paſſage and eſtimation to right, and vertue. And further, as man naturally is inclined to pride and emulation, and thereby infected with malice and couetouſneſſe, and looke how much mightier the perſon is that is poſſeſſed of the vices, ſo muche

the more hurtfull they are in worke and practiſe. And therefore are they moſte peſtiferous and noyfull in kinges and ſouereigne Princes, whiche as they are of hautie courage and ambitious, ſo are they daungerous and commonly full of quarrels &amp; troubleſome to their Neighbours. When ſuch are encouraged with a deſire to conquer and to bring to their obedience, them that are frée from their bondage, or to ſpoile them of liues, goodes, and habitations: they are not ruled ouer by the equitie of lawe, neither pacified by perſuaſions nor mollified with praying or preaching, but violence muſt be reſiſted with violence, and one lawleſſeNo ſtate in ſafety without Militarie profeſsion. iniurie ſatiſfied with an other iniurie, which without the force and terror of armes cannot be once offered, much leſſe accompliſhed. Euery ſtate therefore that wanteth the garde and aſſiſtance of martial proweſſe, lieth open to be ruinated by euery ſpoiler that will inuade it: whereby we finde that no ſtate, Kingdome, Empire, or common wealth, can ſtande in any aſſured ſafetie, either inward or outward but by the benefite of military profeſſion, the friend and nurſe of Lawes, of Religion and of ciuell concord. The neceſſarie vſe and high value whereof made the wiſe Grecians and valiant Romans, to commend all high courages to the vſe and exerciſe of Armes, as the nobleſt and moſt profitable occupation that a worthie minde ſhould deſire: whiche eſtimation it alſo holdeth continually and muſt in al eſtates kingdomes, and Empires of the continent of the world. And though the wickedneſſe &amp; infidelitie of the world, be generally puniſhed by ſworde fire, famine, ſpoyle, and murther, the ordinary workes of warre, Whereby the Juſtice of God is executed vpon the inhabitants of the earth: yet hath the Lord plā
               ted, mainteined, and reſtored, his trueth and religion, by the meanes and aſſiſtance of warlike force and policie, and practiſed his moſt eſpeciall Sonnes in the

knowledge of Armes. For Abraham being called toAbraham▪ had fyghting men▪
                receiue the promiſe of ſaluation to the whole worlde, and brought by the Lord his God to dwell in the land of Canaan, had of his owne family and aliance aboue three hundred fighting men, by whoſe power and courage, he not onely defended himſelfe and al his from the ſpoile and iniuries of the wicked, but alſo reuenged the wrong done to his neighbours, the Kinges of Sodom and Gomorha, and recouering their goodes from the ſpoylers, hee reſtored to euerye man his part that was loſt by the ouerthrow. For which famous deede of proweſſe, Melchiſedech the King of Salem bleſſed Abraham and prayſed the Lorde God, poſſeſſer of heauen &amp; earth in his behalfe.
            In the value of warlike proweſſe, Simeon and Leui, the Sonnes of Iacob, reuenged the violation of theirIacobs ſonnes. Siſter Dyna, vpon the ſonnes of Sychem.
            
            By force of Armes, the Iſraelites comming out of Egypt,
               The Iſraelites. made their way through the Amalekites, &amp; vanquiſhed the Kings of Heſbon and Baſan: and poſſeſſed their landes, their cities, and their riches: ſo did they vanquiſh and deſtroy the mightie Kings, and inuincible people of Canaan, and poſſeſſed their landes, and cities. By Armes their poſteritie defended their inheritance, and helde the ſame: for by Armes the Lorde God vanquiſhed and deſtroied the enemies of Iacob, and therefore is called the Lorde God of hoſtes. By Armes Cyrus conquered Chaldea, and poſſeſſed Babylon, giuingCyrus. libertie to Iſrael: yea, and through his great victories reſtored Sion and Ieruſalem, and the people to their inheritaunce againe. By Armes the Romanes enlarged their Empire ouer many nations, &amp; by vertue of theirThe Romanes. wiſdom and proweſſe they brought many barbarous countreis to ciuilitie and proſperitie: For where they gouerned, ther raigned Prudence and Juſtice, as ordinary companions to Martiall nobleneſſe.
            
               By the Armes of rude nations, the Goths, Hunnes, &amp; Vandalles: the Lorde viſited the proude Empire of the Romanes, for their pride and tyranny, &amp; confounded it.
            By the Armes and proweſſe of the Emperour Conſtantine the Lord relieued his church, and reſtored true religion amongſt many nations.
            By Armes, El Enfante de Pelago recouered the kingdom of Leon, and comforted Spaine, in the daies of cruell afflictions, when all the lande was harrowed and poſſeſſed by the Moores and Infidels.
            By Armes is the worthy kingdome of France garded and preſerued in a State moſte honorable: ſo is Spaine: ſo are the commonweales and principallities in Italy.
            
            By Armes, the Switzers purchaſed their freedome, and by Armes they defende and preſerue their limits and liberties, to their great fame and benefite.
            By Armes hath Germany made her might and prudence knowen to the whole worlde: by Armes they holde the maieſtie of the Empire in their power and election: and bytheir inuincible proweſſe, they mayntaine and preſerue their ſtates and honours, priuate and publike, and are terrible to the nations rounde about them.
            By Armes are the kingdomes of Denmarke and Polonia defended and ſaued from the power of the cruell Ruſsians and Muſcouites.
            
            So is Germany from the powers of the cruell and mighty ſpoylers of the world: the Turkes, Tartarians, Muſcouites alſo, and Ruſsians: and by Armes, they eſtabliſh peace amongſt thēſelues, and are preſerued at home and abroad.
            By Armes, Ferdinando the king of Spaine ſeazed into his power the Weſt Indias, and by Armes are the ſame

poſſeſſed and holden in obedience to the Scepter of Spaine.

            The Lorde our God vſeth no occupation of men in his works and proceedings vpon earth, like as he doth Militarie proweſſe: For by it hee executeth his wrath and Juſtice vpon the rebellious and faithleſſe people of the world.

And farther to amplifie vpon the praiſe of this occupation, what worke or volume can be ſufficient to expreſſe in orderly recital the nobleneſſe and particular vertues of the famoſe martialiſtes of the olde and later worlde, which ſtande renoumed in hyſtories: and for euery one left to memory by name, a thouſand of great worthines are paſt ouer without mentione. But this is generally toWarlike Princes. be noted in the warlike Princes and Nobilitie: that as they exceede in militarie proweſſe and worthines, ſo doe they excell in wiſedome and all nobleneſſe of

And the martialiſt that wanteth them, ſhall not proſper in warre, but ſinke in obloquie and diſhonor: neither is there anye ſtate or vocation of man that can worſe ſuſteyne, the infection and vſe of vices, then can an army gouerned in warlike maner. Fooliſhe therefore and beaſtely is the common ſpeach, vſed of the baſe and humble mynded ſort of our natione, that doe not onely ſaye, but alſo affirme in their doinges, that the worſt ſort of men, (and ſuch as for the vilenes of their conditiones the earth is not able to ſuſteyne) are fit for the warres: and accordingly doe call out the refuſe of the people to be ſoldiers for the ſeruice of their Prince and countreie, where in deede the worthieſt people ought to be choſen, and preferred: as to a ſtate moſt honorable, and of moſt credite and importance.
            But if Englande ſtood in the continent of the world enuironed with mightie nationes, that in the dayes of frendeſhip would moue diſcretion to feare their malice in the time of controuerſy: then ſhould it know ye value of a ſoldier, &amp; lick the duſt off the feete of her men of proweſſe: then would the lawer &amp; the marcheant humble themſelues to the warriers, &amp; be glad to geue honour &amp; ſalary to the martialiſt: and ſhew frendly grace to his page, and fauor to his lackye. And al be it our ſtate is better at eaſe and that we by the benefite of the ſeate of our lande, doe ſtande in more ſecuritie then the nations of the firme land: yet is not our aſſurance ſuch as may ſo deliuer vs vp in the time of peace, to ye careleſſe &amp; ſpitefull contempt of armes: as though the common

Yea and let them be aſhamed of their ignobilitie of harts, &amp; conſent with other nationes to geue vnto the people of proweſſe, and milytarie profeſſion, the honor that is due vnto them. For it is a rare age of the worlde, wherein the ſureſte Kingdome, and the ſafeſte ſtate and nation vpon earth, flieth not at one time or other to the couert and ſuccor of Armes, to ſaue it ſelfe either from inteſtine violence, or from forren depopulation, or elſe from both.
            Whoeſoeuer therefore will ſee the value of

martial proweſſe in preſeruing a kingdome, in vpholdinge the ſouereigne maieſtie of theire Prince, in redeming their countrie from the power of forren ennemyes mightie and warlike, in pacifyinge ciuil vprores, and in extinguiſhinge the moſt ragiouſe furies of any rebelles in the worlde: and in reducinge the gouernement to obedience, iuſtice, houſbandry, traffique, literal exerciſe, and all ciuill policies and ordinances to their places againe.

But that famous King (aided with the proweſſe &amp; fidelity of his approued martialiſtes:) neuer gaue ouer the fielde til hee recouered his kingdome and reſtored the common welth: which had bene ſo ſpoiled, waſted, and depopulat, that the fieldes and vineiards were growen to a wilderneſſe, their cities become heapes, and their habitationes deſolate.Peace and idleneſſe before conqueſts.
            
            When the Lord meaneth to plague a wicked natione for ſinne and to tranſlate them to the power and ſcepter of another nation: then he filleth them with the fatneſſe of the earth, and geeueth them peace that they may wax rotten in idleneſſe, and become of dulle wittes, ſlowe of courage, weake handed, and feeble kneede: that when the ſpoiler commeth, they may in al pointes be vnfurniſhed of warlike proweſſe, and

not able to reſiſte, but ſo made a praye to their ennemies. As the Perſians were to Alexander, the Greekes and Hungarians with many other natones to the Turkes: and the olde Brutes to the Saxons.
            
            And likewiſe when the Lord meaneth to aduanceGod maketh apt to warre, whome he will aduaunce. a nation and to make any people famous and honorable vpon earth: he ſtirreth them vp to high courage, and maketh their mindes and bodyes apt to the warre, and in all points ſufficient for the purſuite and accompliſhment of Militarie trauaile. As he did the Iſraelites for ye recouery of their promiſed inheritance, by ſubduing and deſtroying the mightye Canaanites. Cyrus

And againe, for the chaſtiſement and confuſion of them the Lord rayſed vp to Armes and warlike courage, the rude and barbarous multitudes of the Goths, Hunnes and Vandales. And ſo the Turkes of a ſmall people, andGoths, &amp;c of the ſauage Scythian kinde, to be the moſt cruell and noyfull ſpoylers and deſtroyers that euer were vpon earth, to ſubuert all ye ciuill ſtates and Empires of Aſia

ſerued to aduaunce the name and glorye of God, and to giue paſſage to his Goſpell, where it lay proſtrate and troden vnder the feete of Antichriſt and his conſorts. For when the time was come, in the yere of our Sauiour Chriſt 1517. that ye Lord ſet foote on earth to reſtore his Sanctuary, he beganne his buſineſſe by a poore miniſtrie vnder the couert &amp; protection of the moſt worthie prince Duke Frederick of Saxonie, and ſo encreaſed vnder the defence of the moſt noble Princes, Iohn DukeThe worthie actes of the Duke of Saxoni, Lantgraue &amp;c. of Saxonie, &amp; Philipe Lantgraue
                of Heſſe, &amp; of the famous and warlike cities, Augſborough, Straſborough, Vlmes Magdeborough. &amp;c. And when the champions of the kingdome of darkeneſſe (vnder the conducte of the moſt renowmed Emperour Charles the fifth) ſeemed to renge the hoſte of Iſrael vnder a terrible victory: then did the Lorde of hoſtes beſtirre himſelfe, and fruſtrating the counſailes, and diſperſing the forces of his enemies, he vanquiſhed the troupes of the Philiſtims by the Armed hand of his choſen captaine Maurice Duke of Saxoni: who vy the vertue of Martiall proweſſe ayded by the Lord God of hoſtes, brake the teeth of the vngodly, and reſtored the worde of God to a free paſſage throughout all Germanie. So did the Lorde preuaile by Armes in Surike: by vertue of which alſo, wydened the paſſage of his goſpell into France, and by the force and power of one poore towne, there holdeth poſſeſſion for his Sanctuarie, maugre the might and malice of all his enemies. This being the moſt glorious effects of Militarie induſtrie in theſe ſaide countreis, to the enlarging of Chriſtes kingdome for the ſaluation of many, and comfort of the whole worlde: praiſe the inuincible Arme of our God mighty and victorious in battell: and ſee yet a greater worke then all theſe, nowe a doing by force of Armes for the ciuill libertye, and for the freedome of true Religion in lowe Dutchelande: where the hande of the Lorde hath bene ſo apparant fauourable,

that in all the progreſſe and ſucceſſe of theſe warres it may be ſaide: This is the worke of the Lord our God, in the ſight of all the Heathen, and it is marueilous in our eyes. Let vs therfore examin ſome part of thoſe affaires, &amp; ſee how Iacob hath preuailed in his warres by ſlow and vnexpert ſouldiers, againſt the moſt famous, arrogant, &amp; implacable enemies of the goſpel of Chriſt: and then let the ſwiniſh fooles that contemne martiall profeſſion, ſtoppe their mouthes and be aſhamed. For the heauens doe reioyce, the worlde is comforted, and Iſrael ſhalbe glad through ye victories of God, purchaſed by the fidelitie &amp; proweſſe of his valiant men at armes.
            When King Philip had wearied his good ſubiects ofPhilip, vexed lowe Duchland low Duchland, with fained pacifications, in the aduantage wherof the defendants being taken vnprouided &amp; vnarmed, were daylie ſpoyled and murthered, they fell to armes for publike defence, &amp; ſtoode vpon their gard: but béeing ouercome by the falſe promiſes of the faithleſſe Regent, the Duches of Parma, they accepted conditions of agreement, and while they reſted vpon the ſame, came the Duke of Alua accompanied with choſenThe duke of Alua his force. forces, and tooke the countrey in charge, as Lieutenant to the King. He planted his bands of warre in all the ſtronge townes and holdes through out the Lowe countrey: he apprehended the Counties of Horne, and Degremont, and executed them as captains and chiefe pillers of the Mutiners. He builded the Caſtell of Antwerp for maſtering of that proude citie, and renged all the whole Lande vnder feare and oppreſſion, minding to bring the people vnder extreeme exactions, for the nouriſhment of their own plagues &amp; ſeruitude: I mean for the maintenāce of the kings forces &amp; fortifications throughout, for the holding of the people in ſubiection to what yoke or ordinances ſo euer ſhould be enforced vppon them: Wherein the Duke miſſed the Tracte of that wiſedome and pollycie that was famed to bée

in him. For this tirannous porpoſe coming to common apparance, then reuolted the Holanders and Zelanders,
               God by an vnlikely hoſte ſheweth his migt in an vnlikely ſtate to ſtande to theire cauſe. But the Lord God of hoſtes that had ſtirred vp this quarel, meaning to proue the force of his blowe by an vnlikly hoſt, againſt the troopes of the prowde and dredfull warriers his ennemyes,) did ſhewe himſelfe ſufficient, able to confounde the mightie by the weake, the prudent by the fooliſhe, the induſtrious by the ſlowe, the courageouſe by the cowarde, ye glorious by the vile, the noble by the churle, and the King by the vaſſale, the rich and imperiall by the poore and ſeruile multitude: For compariſon beinge conſideratly made of the Holanders
               Hollanders and zelanders againſt Philippe King of Spaine. and rude Zelanders with their King: hee mightie in powers both by lande and by ſea, ſtandinge in continual redines: they weak and vnprouided both for lande and water: he in renowmed armes, ſtronge, experimented, and politique: they naked, and of al other their Kings people and ſubiects, contemned for their natural ſlowenes, cowardiſe, ignorance, dronkeneſſe, and moſt vnwarlike ſpirites: the King infinite in artillarye, munitiones, treaſures, and eke in frends, lieutenantes, commanders, &amp; martiall bands of incomparable fame and approued value: the mutiners eaſye to be exhauſted of their monie, vnfurniſhed of all habilementes of warre, of trained Soldiers, and experimented Capteines, and hauinge their neereſt neighbours, yea and them of their kinred and alience, to bee their moſte fyerſe and noifull enemies. And in this vnequal match to entre warre, it woulde haue ſeemed a motion in the mutiners, proceedinge rather of a deſperat rage, then grounded vpon any reaſonable hope to preuaile to any other effect, then to the thraldome and confuſion of themſelues, and of their poſteritie. Howe be it the Lord that commandeth his Soldiers, and capteines that beare armes in the quarell of

trueth and righteouſneſſe, not to feare the multitude of their enemies: ſtoode by the Hollanders in their honeſt cauſe, and hath iuſtified their quarell, &amp; wil maintaine it to the ende, as it ſeemeth at this day. For hee hath in the behalfe of that contemned people (naye rather to make good the glory of his great name againſt the vanity of fleſh &amp; blood) brought impoſſible thinges to a marueilous prooffe: Els coulde it not haue come to paſſe, that poore litle and weake Vluſhing, ſhouldeLitle Vluſhing famiſhed ſtrong Middleborough. haue famiſhed and ſubdued the riche, large, and ſtrong Citie of Middlebourgh, aided by the riche and mightie townes of Antwerpe and Anſterdam, and eke of Tregoſe, and Barowe: and garded with 2000. approoued Souldiers, vnder the commaundement of that famous Gentleman, Mont Darragon, who was driuen by diſtreſſe of victuals (all the forces of the king being not able either to relieue him or to ſuccour him) to render vp the town, departing from it with 1400 men of war in armes: wherby the whole Iſland of Walkeren came entirely vnder the direction of the Prince of Orange, to the inſpeakeable comfort of the cauſe publike. For by the benefite of this victory, ye 
               Zelanders, vtterly vanquiſhed the kinges forces vppon the Sea and bet him quite from it: whereby the Brabanders and Flemings,
               The lowe countrie reuolted from the Spanyards were put from their fiſhing and traffike, other then vnder the courteſie of the Zelanders: which ſo endamaged all the continent of the lowe countrey, that the inhabitaunts finding themſelues preſſed in an extreeme wrenche, betwixt the warres of their neighbours, and the oppreſſion of the Spanyardes: they fell in concluſion to ioyne handes with the mutiners, in a more conuenient and a farre better policie, and in a more aſſured hope, that by a generall conſent in Armes, they might redeme their countrey frō the power of ye oppreſſers, and driue the Spanyards with their adherents out of the lande: then to nouriſh the warres againſt their

neighbours, in whoſe diſcomfiture and ſubuerſion ſtood the thraldome of them all: in whoſe victorie, the libertie and deſired reſtitution of the one and of the other ſhould reſt aſſured. Herevpon proceeded the generall reuolt of all the lowe cuntrie, yea rather enforced by the good ſucceſſe and proweſſe of the Hollanders and Zelanders, then willingly accepted of them of Flanders, Brabant,
               The good ſucceſſe of the Holanders and zelanders, cauſed the reſt of the countries to ioyne with them and of other Countries, for anye free zeale to the cauſe publike. But blinde were the heartes of them that did not ſee, that the Prince of Orange and his poore vnexperimented adherents, were the very Army of the Lord God of hoſtes, who will neuer faile to breake the Jawes of his aduerſaries, turning their wiſedome to folly, and their glory to ſhame: which was fully accompliſhed in the Duke of Alua, that dreadfull and renowmed chieftaine of the Papiſtes. For had not hée bene ouercome with a very tirannous madnes, hee woulde not haue entred his gouernement in Belgia with oppreſſion, murther, pillage, and intollerable decrees, vpon the people that were (by eaſier prouocations then theſe, ſtirred and ready to breake out in Armes) in mind rather to dye in the field for the defence of their ancient liberties (ſo dearly purchaſed and defended by the blood of their forefathers) then to yeeld themſelues and their poſteritie vnder the heauie yoke, and arrogant domination of ſo implacable people, as bee the Spanyardes: which might well haue bene conſidered in the wiſdome of the Duke of Alua, but that God blinded him with the might of his Prince, and the opinion of himſelfe, that if this whole Countrie of lowe Ducheland, ſhould in generall conſent fall to Armes, and withſtand their Prince by vyolence, and that they were not to bee reduced to obedience, but by extreeme warres, and infinit charges: after much blood and ſpoyle of the lande, the King ſhould reduce them to his yoke and ſubiection by the ſworde: that euen ſo, and by that weariſome and

cruell meanes, he muſt euer after reteine them &amp; their poſterity in his obedience: which would be an intollerable charge to him, and would ſet downe a continuall pillage and oppreſſion vppon the Subiectes: whereof ſhould enſue the orderly decaye of the common wealth, and nouriſhe a perpetuall malice in the people againſt their Soueraigne Lorde, and continually pricke them to tumultes: which at the laſt, ſhoulde eyther ſet them free and reiect their Prince, or els vtterly confounde them by the increaſe of their tyrannie and miſerable ſeruitude, which alſo would eate the king out of his inheritance. But had the Duke called to memorie howe apt this nation hath bene in olde time to fall to warre in quarell of their liberties, and for defence of their ancient compoſitions: and how they ſhooke of the tyrannous Soueraigntie of the French kings (yet more gentle and profitable then this of the Spanyards) and howe dearely and painefully the French kings haue in times paſt forced their obedience, and coulde not, but were at the laſt, after much warres and many bloody victories, quite ſhut out: he would haue endeuoured his wiſdome and labour to reconcile them by mollifying the gouernment, and by gratious gentlenes and bountie, rather then proudlye to preſſe downe the yoke that had alreadyTyranny abhored of God 
                     •
                   man. wearied them: which cannot proſper, nor long endure: for the Lord God in his Juſtice hateth tyrannie, and deſtroyeth tyrants from the face of the earth: and vſually deſtroyeth the roote and branche of euerye cruell grinder of the faces of the poore, and caſteth him of for euermore.
            And farther, he fell into this ouerſight: that he exceeded ſo farre in the proportion of the kings charges, by fortifications, and ſuperfluous ſupplies: aboue all the leuie and receiptes that were to come in, by all the pillage, dueties, and lones that he could deuiſe: that he ranne indebted to the men of warre, aboue xxxiij. Monethes

paye, whereby the ſouldiers became diſordered ſpoylers: &amp; at the laſt ſo mutinous, that the Spanyardes forced their pay, and bound the Duke to ſhamefull conditions, and for his laſt farewel he was forced to kéepe his lodging vnder gard, &amp; durſt not preſent himſelfe openly to the men of war at his departure out of Belgia, vntil the Commander Don Lewes de Requezes the new lieuetenant, had giuen his promiſe, in the wordes of the king, and ſet downe an order for the ſoldiers full pay.
            With theſe errors he ioyned many faultes in the direction &amp; purſuit of theſe wars: which turned to the aduauntage of the poore defendauntes, but much to the diſgrace &amp; diſcredit of himſelf.

            After he had reconciled the mutiners, &amp; ſet al things in order in Harlam, hee went forth to beſet Alkemer: where he arriued vpon ye day of a great faire holden in the towne: which was therefor filled with the countryThe duke of Alua by a tempeſt driuen from the ſeege of Alkemer. people yong &amp; old, &amp; with catle, without garde of men of warre, without ſtore of victuales, or of any other habilements of warr: ſauing ye Captein Richauor through great perill &amp; induſtrie entred ye towne with 500. men of warre. The Duke battered ye towne in ſoundry places, &amp; aſſaulted it fearcely, &amp; was repulſed: he cōmanded the ſeconde aſſault, &amp; as ye 
               Spaniards made towarde the wall, there fel a very terrible tēpeſt of haile rain wind and thunder, that ſo danted &amp; the Souldiers, that refuſing the ſeruice they turned vpō their Commanders, and would not forwarde: for the former attempts were deerely bought. The Duke ſeeing the Capteins to ſley their own ſouldiers for their diſobedience, commanded retrait, and ſo ye aſſailants returned to their lodgings, minding to gather better courage againſt ye next day: But the tempeſt continewed al that night, and powred down ſuch aboundance of raine, yt by ye morning, their cheef enchamping ground was al vnder water, &amp; moſt of the peeces that battered, lay ſuncken vp to the axiltree, &amp; for the ſoftnes of the ground might not then by no meanes be recouered. Wherevpō ye Duke diſlodged himſelf, &amp; encamped farther frō ye towne in a dry ſoile, from whence alſo within a few days he remoued quite away, after that hee had ſpente full ſixe weekes in that ſiege to his great loſſe &amp; diſhonor: for by that day that

hee gaue it ouer, the Towne was not victualled for ſixe dayes.
            This was the Dukes laſt attempt in Holland, and this his repulſe much hardened &amp; encouraged the Hollanders to ſtande faſt in their cauſe.
            Hee had ſo farre exhauſted the Kings Treaſure and his owne money, that he borowed. 12000. gylderns ofThe duke of Alua vnto his laſt trump his hoſt in Amſterdam, to bear his charges into Spaine. Thus this great Duke that came into Belgia ſo glorious and dreadful, is daunted &amp; returned into Spaine with ſhame and diſcredite.
            Then ſucceded in his charge, Don Lewes de Requezes greate Cōmander of Caſtile: who practiſing to mingle hypocriſie and bloud in one drift and policie, (that was to ſnare and to confounde the Prince of Orange) hee preuailed in both leſſe then he hoped. For he could no more preuaile againſt Iſrael, then did Fernando de Toledo.
                Duringe his gouernement, was the Kinges nauey and all his forces by ſea quite vanquiſhed and broken. Firſt as they relieued Midleburgh by Eſtecaple vnder the conduct of S. de Beuoys: in which exploit periſhed viii. or ix. ſhippes great and ſmall.
            At the conflict by Rhomers wall, the Papiſtes making forth to the fight, vnder the gouernement of Iulius Rhomero: they were diſcomfited with the loſſe of xvi. or xvii. boates of warre, &amp; aboue 1500. of their moſt choſen Soldiers: where that valeant Iulius flyinge the terror of the Zelanders, hardely ſaued his life, recouering to lande by a Scute, where alſo the Commander ſtoode lookinge on the fight with a croſſe in his hande, and a Frier at the right ſide of him, prayinge together for the good ſucceſſe of the batell: wherein it appered that the Lorde hearde them not, yet were the Zelanders ſore ſpente and weakened, with ix. weekes colde wynter lyinge on ſhippeboorde, thinnely clothed, &amp; as thinnely dieted, with browne bread, cheeſe, redde heringes and

ſmall beere, in all poyntes inferiour to their ennemies: but God was with ye poore, againſt the prowde and mightie: to him be the glorie and the praiſe.
            Upon Whitſondaye next folowinge, ye 
               Zelanders invaded &amp; ſpoiled the reſt of the Kings nauey in the riuer of Andwerpe. The Papiſtes once beſéeged the citie of Leyden for the ſpace of ſixe monethes, and preuailing not, they departed. Nowe being enformed that the Towne was vnfurniſhed of men of warre, and none woulde receiue, and vnſtored of victualles and none would prouide, but reiected the commandement of the Prince in both theſe pointes, they come agayne, and ſhut vp the vnarmed city with ſuch forces, that the prince and ſtates were not able to make any reſonable attempte to ſuccor the diſtreſſed Towne by land: which made them to fal in deuiſe to drowne the countrie, preparingé an Armada, of ſmall boates wel appoynted forThe Lord prouideth for the zelanders contrary to expectation. the purpoſe: whiche after dificult paſſage on the moſte part of their way, were ſtalled at Sonterwold xi. dayes in wanne hope for want of water to carie thē through their appointed voyage. The Admiral Boyſot hauinge one day diſpatched a poſt to the Prince lying at Delft, with letters to certifie his exellencie of the vntowardneſſe of their attempt: the beſeged in that while, deſtitute of al maner of victuals, were in an inclination to talke for compoſitiones with the ennemye. But the Lorde that woulde bring them to vnderſtande howe much he was on their ſide, and euer at hand with them that faithfully truſte in him, in the ſame very night next folowinge the ſaide diſpatch of the poſt with the Admirals comforteleſſe letters to the Prince, &amp; when that all their councelles were ſhutte vp in a hopeleſſe dungel, came a mightie wynde from the Northe Weſt, which draue the Ocean ſea to runne in at the ſluces &amp; breaches of the ſea walles ſo violently, that in the drift of one tide, the water was flowed vp three foote and a

halfe deepe, where it was not a ſhaftment déepe, at the diſpatch of the ſaide poſt. Then did the Admirall ſo beſturre him, that he the next forenoone diſlodged them of the firſt ſcoute, &amp; ſo them of Leiden Dam, and of Leiden Dorp: and ſo terrified all the ennemies diſperſed in ſcouts, to the number of 12000▪ men of warre, that they ranne away from all their ſtandinges, and abandoned the ſiege, in a flyinge feare. And the Admiral pourſuinge the occaſion with great induſtry and courage, arriued with his ſhallowe and vitorious nauie at the walles of the hungrie Towne. And forthwith ſent aduertiſements to the Prince of this moſt happie and vnlooked ſucceſſe, within xxiiii. howres of the former contrary letteres. And this was a wonderfull worke of God, by the hands of a people, earſt ſlowe, feareful and vnwarrelike: and nowe (by the exerciſe of Armes, and conduct of the General commander of all Armies) induſtrious, hardye, and vanquiſhers of the moſt warrelike. Here is to be noted for a wonderful worke of God alſo. In the verie nighte that the winde ſo ſerued the point, to driue the floodde ouer the lande, 200. paſes of the wales of the beſieged Citie fel into the ditch, with ſuch a noiſe as terrified ye ennemies, as it had bene the noiſe and ſturre of the aduerſaries cominge in a Camiſado, whiche made the Papiſtes to flie their places, to the diſcomfiture of all them that were in the farther ſcoutes, aſſaulted by the Admiral and his people, and ſo ranne all away without any reſonable cauſe why, other then the feare that God ſtrake in their hartes. God alſo prouided further for the miraculous preſeruation of that Towne: that where at the firſt pitchinge of the ſiege, they made proportion of their victualles but for two monethes, according to the nomber within: the Lord ſent a plague that diminiſhed of thē ſix thouſand and more: and ſo leauing not aboue ſeuen hundreth able men to weare Armes, the victuals ſerued for ſixe

monethes: but xv. dayes before the ſuccours came, they were vniuerſally without bread within the towne, &amp; two or three dayes without any maner of foode: yet were not ye faithfull &amp; valeant Bourgars weery of their partes: ſo deere is ciuil libertie, and ſo terrible &amp; odious is irkſome ſeruitude and oppreſſion to honeſt &amp; manly hartes. Then folowed, the ſurpriſe of Schonehouen, Olderkyrk. &amp;c. by the Papiſtes: and inuadinge alſo the Ilande of Zeland called Scowen, where at their entry, periſhed ye noble and faithful gentleman Charles Boyſot Generall gouernor for the Prince in Zeland, being hurt with the ſhotte of one of his owne people. They beſieged Bomenyer, a litle village fortified at the ſodeyne by the countrie men, who had to their aide and defence of the place, Capteyne Hooke and two hundreth Germanes, whoe together with the valiant Boores (newely made martialiſts) ſo approued their proweſſe and fidelitie, that they all (ſauing fiue men) ſpent their liues in reſiſtinge the fierſe aſſaultes of the ennemies, which at the ſixth aſſault recouered the place, where many a worthie Soldier of the Spanyardes periſhed, to the number of 3000▪ and vpwardes: amonge whiche were ſome ſuch ſpeciall Capteines and Gentelmen, as the loſſe of them brake the very hart of the famous Marques Vittello, wherevpon the Commander made a vowe, that he woulde neuer more attempt to winne towne in Hollande or Zelande by force of aſſault.
            
               Zurickeſea being alſo ſurpriſed by the Papiſtes (aZurikſea ſurpriſed, by the Papiſtes. towne full of corrupt Papiſtes, &amp; common whores) the Hollanders and Zelanders began to doubt of their matters: and greatly to feare the forewardeneſſe and ſucceſſe of their ennemies: and diſtruſting their owne ſtate and value, they laboured for to obteine aide and confederacie abrode: where they founde ſuch colde comfort, that they might well ſay. Non eſt Salus in filijs hominum. Whileſt they ſtoode yet reeling and coulde

not finde a ſure grounde to reſt vpon, the Lorde that in this maner doth vſe to trie ye faith of his people (and findeth litle in fleſhe and bloude but feare and diſtruſt in God) awakened, and wrought for himſelfe: and at a moment altered ſo the ſtate of thinges that the Commander being dead, the Duke of Arskot, the countie Meuſfeelde and Monſeur Barliamount, entred the Gouernement ciuil and martial, vntil the King ſent thither the Lorde Iohn of Auſtria: who at his firſt commingThe duke of Auſtria his fonde &amp; falſe deuiſe failed him. behaued himſelfe ſo ſweetely, that hee woulde ſeeme of faithfull intent and deuior to reduce the common welth to peace, concord, and obedience, by gentlenes &amp; liberal dealing: and vpon this deuiſe, paſſed couenantes of reconciliation through al: for the credite &amp; accompliſhement whereof, he forced himſelfe to ſwarue from al reſonable policies, in drawinge the Spanyardes and the bands of warr out of the ſtrong places, in abandoning the Caſtle of Andwerp, in remouinge the Kings forces out of al the lowe countrie, in executinge certeine Spanyardes, in concluding himſelfe to doe nothing without the conſent of the States, in the gouernement ciuil or martial, in ratifying the pacification of Gannt: In all which drifts he ment to illude the States, and to dare the Prince of Orange (as a lark) til he had ſnared them al in his power, and then to execute his bloudy intention: whiche the Lorde God fruſtrated, turning this wiſe platte of the Papiſtes, to the vtter ouerthrowe of theire porpoſe, and to the euerlaſting ſhame and diſcredite of the Lorde Iohn: who by this fondly fette deuiſe, ſhutte himſelfe out of all, and dying vanquiſhed by his owne foly and ſlowenes, he is for euer ſhrowded with this opinion amongeſt wiſe men, that hee was verye voide of depe policies, of martial proweſſe, and eke of militarie induſtrie, and ſo let him reſt with Don Lewys. Their boſting pride and malice is at an end, &amp; the Lord God of hoſtes procedeth in his warres, and ſo ſhall hee

confounde and conſume al his ennemyes from the face of the erth: proſper and aduance his name, his trueth, and glorie, and make the Crowne of his anointed to flooriſh, by the hands of his men of proweſſe, and by the value of his armed martialiſtes, by whoſe labour and induſtrie he hath wrought and done al thes thinges before our eyes, and wee behold them euen in our bedes. Praiſe God therefore, and geue honor to his faithfull Souldiers: &amp; let the coueteous merchant, and the ambitious lawier leaue of his drudgerie for greedy lucre, deſpiſe the delicacie of his belly, &amp; daſſh ye wantonnes of his eyes, and caſt his idol out of his ſeruil hart: that is, ſenſeles auarice, and put on Armes, &amp; furniſhe himſelfe with policie and warlike Proweſſe, yf hee will iuſtely be numbred amongſt the people of nobleneſſe &amp; honor.
            Hauinge ſaid ſomewhat concerning militarie profeſſion and militarie men in general, nowe behoueth it to deſcribe what kinde of man is worthy of the name of a martialiſt, what men did proffeſſe and exerciſe this occupation in old time, now doe, and hereafter muſt: and eke to diſtinguiſhe betwixt Souldier and Souldier:The qualities of militarie men. that the profeſſion in his ſelfe nature and qualitie may ſtand vnattaynted before the malignant &amp; fooliſhe aduerſary, &amp; walke freely deliuered from the ſcourfe and corruptions of ye lewd multitude yt vante themſelues of Souldierſhip, that throgh their vilenes, doe geue matter to the rotten &amp; idle bellies to depraue, &amp; ſo to deſpiſe martial Armes, that in their ſeruile diſcretion they iudge it a diſcredite for an honeſt man to be a ſouldier.
            The man that loueth right and honoreth iuſtice, is fit to be ye defendor of the ſame: he yt is merciful to ye poore, and pitieth the afflicted, is a meete man to ſuccour his countrie nation &amp; againſt the violence of tirantes and oppreſſors: he that loueth the habitationes of the iuſt, &amp; the proſperity of ye righteous: he yt tendereth ye widowe and the fatherles: he that delighteth to ſe ſcience, ſocial

amitie, and vertue to flooriſhe in his countrie, deuineWho is to be accomted a right ſouldier. honor aduanced, faith, peace, and equitie to reigne in euerye felowſhippe, and hateth couetouſnes, robbery, theft, extortion, brawlinges, ſtriffe, murther, fornication, idleneſſe and dronkeneſſe, that man is worthie and fit to be a Soldier. For the firſt foundation and vſe of Armes was erected of neceſſitie, to reſtreine and to repreſſe the violent crueltie, and beaſtly diſorder of men, and to eſtabliſhe ſocial peace and Juſtice vppon earth: which els coulde haue had neither ſeat nor poſſeſſion in the worlde, for that the nature of man is ſo euel, and his hart ſo peruerſe that there is no meane to bridle his furies, and to hold him any while in a peaceable order, but by feare of corporal puniſhement. For howe vnwillinge man is naturally to bee ſubiecte to the rule and direction of an other, and to ſuffer an examiner of his offenſes, and to miniſter ſtripes for the ſame, that woteth euery hart of fleſhe in his owne feeling and vnderſtandinge. The power therefore and wiſedom, to reforme &amp; to gouern people is abſolutly giuen of God, for the benefite and preſeruation of mankinde, eſtabliſhed &amp; vpholden by force of Armes, as the mean, iudged fitteſt in the heauenely wiſdome, to preſerue and to gouerne this rude and rebellious worlde.
            The cheefe man therefore of militarie order, is ech ſouereigne prince in his ſtate &amp; gouernement. Hee being a man complet in all the vertues &amp; condicions that are behoofull to one of that charge and proffeſſion: ſhall paſſe full fraighted of loue &amp; honor, and reſt in glorie &amp; prayſe vpon earth, as the Sunne in the firmament.
            The office &amp; charge of euery ſoueriegne maieſtie in general, is to miniſter iuſtice, for the maintenance of right and domeſticall peace amongeſt his people, &amp; eke to defende the ſame from inteſtine and forren violence. For the true accompliſhement whereof, this Prince or cheefteine, muſt be furniſhed with prudence to

conſider the ſtate and nature of all partes and particulars pertaining to the commodity and aduauncement of the health and wealth of his people, priuate, and publike: and accordingly to prouide to eſtabliſhe and to continue the ſame.
            For as hee is the heade of his people, ſo muſt he bee their wiſdom, their light, and their example: and lookeThe prince ſhould be an example to his people▪
                what equitie, what modeſtie, what temperance, what vſe and exerciſes of vertue he would ſhould raigne and dwell in his people, of the ſame muſt hee himſelfe bee the very ſpringing Fountaine, running in continuall ſtreames throughout all his Regiment: In vulgus enim manant exempla regentum. The Commons doe followe, as they haue their ruler for a guide. But ſeeing that corruption doth ſticke ſo faſt in fleſh and blood, that neither Prince nor vaſſall can be without imperfections: we muſt allowe more libertie of infirmities, in the citie then in the fielde.
            For as the Armed hoſte is the extreeme remedie to chaſtiſe, and to repreſſe the inſolencie, iniuries, and▪ offencesVices in ſoldiers muſt ſtrōgly be brideled. of others, ſo ſhoulde the regiment of warre be free from the ſame: &amp; euery vice in a Souldier ſtrongly bridled and extremely puniſhed. So did and doe all Cheiftaines that euer preuailed, or ſhall preuaile by Armes, and be renowmed in Militarie proweſſe. For where corruption and libertie is ſuffered in a Souldier, there is the ſhame and confuſion of Armes. Preciſe Diſcipline therefore, is the ordinarie nourſe of honorable warfare: whereby the Prouerbe (no leſſe wiſe then it is olde) is alſo profitable, as it is moſte true, He that is fitte for the Chappell, is meete for the fielde. And whereas Armes are moſt in vſe and bee beſt gouerned, there are the vertues and worthineſſe of the minde had moſt in exerciſe and honour. Whereof it followeth, that the Cheeftaine muſt be wiſe in counſaile, temperate in life, affable in ſpeach, faythful in words,

courteous in greeting, wakefull in charge, prouident in perill, abſtinent in dyet, continent in life, apt to traueile, prudent and couragious in Battell, conſtant in wiſdome, proweſſe, and vertue: bountifull to the worthie, amiable to the honeſt, ſeuere to the wicked, gratious to the afflicted, and mercifull to the Captiue, modeſt in victorie, and conſtant in magnanimitie, not fearing the frailetie of warlike ſtate and proſperitie, nor drowping vnder the alteration of the ſame: Such a prince is a compleat Martialiſt. Such was Iupiter
               Iupiter Belus: 
               Belus, that firſt repreſſed by force of Armes, the furious crueltie, and ragious inſolencie of men, and ſubdued many people to the authoritie of ciuill gouernement, laying thereby the foundation of the Empire of Syria: whereof proceeded ſuch a benefite to mankinde, that he was eſteemed and honoured as a ſoueraigne God amongſt the Gentils. So was Hercules of Lybia, that forHercules. to chaſtiſe the tyrannous Girones that vſurped and oppreſſed Spaine, tooke his voyage out of his countrie into Spaine and deſtroied them: And after his returne, came Cacus out of Italie and moleſted Spaine, which brought Hercules againe: who vanquiſhing the robber, redeemed the land and people, reſtoring them to ciuill peace and libertie: whereby he purchaſed deuine honour amongſt the heathen.
            Such alſo was Cyrus King of Perſia. Such was Alexander the great, til he began to waxe idle (as not hauing whereupon to exerciſe his proweſſe) and to giue ouer his life to drunkenneſſe and incontinency. Suche was Philippe the Father of Alexander. Such was Ageſilaus: Themyſtocles, Simon, Ariſtides, and other moſt famous Captaines amongſt the Greekes. Such were the Metelli, the Fabij, the Scipiones, &amp; ſuch was Pompeius: and many other moſt renowmed Cheefteynes amongſt the Romanes.
            
            Such was Mythridates the moſt valiant and warlike

king of Pontus: and ſuch was Pyrrhus king of Epyrus.
            
            Such was Iulius Caeſar, the moſt worthie and beſt renowmed martialiſt of the world. Such were alſo Octauius Augustus, Marcus Anthonius Pius, Alexander ſeuerus: and many other renowmed Emperours, kinges, and Cheefteins amongſt the olde heathen. And by theſe vertues they proſpered in Armes, and became great in the world: &amp; vnder the gouernment, nouriſhment, and protection of them, flowriſhed ſcience, honeſt exerciſes, and ciuill policies.
            Amongſt the Iſraelites and Chriſtians are alſo to be remembred in dutifull loue and honour, many Emperours, kinges and princes, endued with plentie of high and moſt noble vertues, and as they excelled inIſraelites that excelled in Armes. Armes, ſo were they riche in wiſdome and goodnes, to the great benefite of the world, to the euerlaſting praiſe of themſelues, and eke to the glorious reliefe &amp; aduancement of the knowledge and honour of God vpon earth: which without the zeale, induſtrie, wiſdome and proweſſe of noble princes had bene in hazarde to make vtter ſhipwracke many hundreth yeres paſt. And of theſe, are chiefly to be renoumed with ſacred reuerence, &amp; perpetual thanſgiuing to our good God, Moſes, the firſt ruler &amp; captaine of the ſpeciall people &amp; Army of the Lord God of hoſts. Then Ioſua. Othniel, Gedeon, Samſon, Iephthe Samuel, &amp; Deborah the woman. Thē 
               Dauid, the moſt acceptable &amp; worthy captain &amp; prophet, gods ſpecial &amp; choſen king ouer his people Iſrael, by whoſe mightie value &amp; martial proweſſe, ye Lord ſtretched forth the kingdom of Iacob, to the promiſed bounds: &amp; being a terror to the enemies of Iſrael abrode, &amp; a chaſtiſer of the rebels &amp; hypocrites at home he, ſtabliſhed peace &amp; Juſtice in Iſrael, and applied his wiſdom, zeale, trauaile and treaſure to aduaunce the honour, trueth, and true worſhipping of God &amp; his couenant in all the common wealth of Iſrael: which he purſued with ſuch indeuor &amp; integrity of hart,

that all things ſo proſpered in his hand to the glorie of the Lorde, and to the health and wealth of Iſrael: that (in that reſpect) the Lorde ſaide: that He had found Dauid his ſeruant, a man after his owne heart.
            
            Such alſo were Zedekiah, Ioſaphat, and Ioſias, renowmed in the Scriptures of God.
            With theſe are to bee numbred (though not in that preeminencie) many Princes of the Chriſtians, greatly endued with wiſdome, ciuill vertues, and proweſſe: which euer goe together, woorking the effecte of peace and proſperitie, in all places where they dwell in vſe and power. Amongſt ſuch are chiefly to be named Conſtantine the great, Charles the great, and manye more Emperours of the olde time: and nowe lately, Charles the fifth: neyther is the laſt Ferdinando caſt out of theKings of high proweſſe and vertues. Catalogue of good Princes: for he was very learned, deſirous of peace, méeke, and modeſt, and liberall to honeſt deſertes.
            Of the French kings, manye were of high proweſſe vertues and value, &amp; great nouriſhers of iberall Sciences. As were Charles martel, Lewes the pitious, Philip Auguſtus, the holy Lewes, Philippe the fayre, Philippe de Valois. Iohn, Charles the fift. Charles the ſixt, a very ſufficient Prince till he became Lunatike, Charles the ſeuenth, Lewes the eleuenth, Charles the eyghth, Lewes the twelfth, and Frances renowmed for his proweſſe, modeſtie, prudence, and for his affection and aduancement of lerning, commonly called, The Father of Sciences. Then ſucceeded his Sonne King Henrie, a prince of high value in Cheualrie, gratious to his people, and bountifull to his friendes, and very readie to gratifie the deſerts of men, and to aduance men of worthineſſe, and in Armes moſt valiant.
            And conſidering what rebellious and furious people the French are: it is to be wondered, that the prudence and induſtrie of their kinges was continually able to repreſſe

to refourm, and to reconcile ſo mutinous and rageous a natiō, as they haue alwais ſhewed themſelues to be, moleſting, vexing, and ſpoyling the King, the gonernement, and common welth, by peopetuall vprores, continuing in Armes. Pillage, murthers, horrible maſſachres and diſloyaltie (in ſome ages) three ſcore yeres together. As in the dayes of King Iohn, Charles the fifth, Charles the ſixth, &amp; Charles the ſeuenth, which approueth great fidelitie, proweſſe, and prudence, in the gentlemen, nobilitie, and bandes of warre: by whoſe value, ſo implacable and mad rebelles could be repreſſed and the ſtate reformed.
            Of the Kings of England bene alſo many renowmedRenowmed Kings of England. amongſt the good Princes: And hee of them that exceeded in military feates and proweſſe, the ſame verely (as I haue often ſaide) excelled alſo, in wiſedome, iuſtice, and ciuill vertues. As did Arthur amongſt the Brutes. Edmonde, Edgar, Athelſton, Edwarde
                and Edwarde amongſte the Saxons. And ſince the conqueſt: William the conqueror himſelfe, Henry the ſecond, Richard the firſt, Edward the firſt, Edwarde the thyrde, Henry the fifte, and Henry the ſeuenth, and Henry the eighte.
            Of Spayne King Pellaro: and ſome others: but laſtely and cheefly Fernando the fifth, the firſt entire Monarch of Spayne, that by his noble wiſedome and paſſinge value in Armes, recouered the kingdome of Granado from the Mores: tooke the kingdome of Naples, helde Sicilia in peace, and poſſeſſed the Indias.
            
            The Charles, that aduanced the honor and ſtate of Spayne to the full ſumme: by vertue of military induſtrie and martial prudence, became renowmed amonge the moſt warrelike Princes of the worlde.
            Now omittinge the famous Kinges and Princes of other countries and nations, for that I haue inferred

authorities ſufficient in force and number, to approoue and to magnifie the prayſe of Armes: and to auoide more tediouſneſſe then here needeth: I will ſumme vp the Catalogue of renowmed Princes, with the ſacred memory of them that are moſt worthie to be praiſed amongRenowmed princes of our age. the Chriſtians of theſe dayes, for the incomparable value of their proweſſe and warres, as due vnto the ſpeciall martialiſts of the Lord God of hoſtes, by whoſe Armes, he did put in foot to fight with Sathan in plain battell, for the recouerie of his holy Sanctuary, that lay many a tedious yeere trodden vnder the féete of Antichriſt: and earſt durſt not be attempted, till the Lorde had prouided his Army, and appointed his Cheefteynes of courage, fayth, and Militarie prudence, fitte for the wars of Iacob. As were Fredericke, Iohn, and Maurice, the renowmed Princes in honour, chiualrie, and vertues, Dukes of Saxoni: Philippe Lantgraue
                of Heſſe: Albert Marques
                of Brandenbourgh, Chriſtopher
                Duke of Wyrtembergh, the warlike and faythfull ſtates of Germany and Zurik. The Nobility of France, and aboue them al, William, Earle of Naſſau, the vertuous, good, and happie Prince of Orange. By vertue of the fayth, induſtry, and proweſſe, of theſe ſacred martialiſts, is the goſpell, and kingdome of Chriſt Jeſus, brought againe to their paſſage, &amp; fréely preached to the world, an inſpeakable comfort &amp; riches to al mankinde, and that ſpecially to the elect children of God, to whom be prayſe, Amen.
            Theſe Militarie men being the moſt renowmed, the moſt ſacred, beneficiall, and profitable perſonages of the world: to the worlde, and to all that dwell, and haue dwelled vpon earth, and that by warlike induſtrie: It muſt be granted, that al their aſſiſtants, and adherents: by whoſe labours, perils, blood, and valiancie, the great effects of Armes haue bene wrought: muſt bee comprehended in the fame, and honour of their Princes, as a matter iuſtly to be imparted to euery one, according to

the value of his worthines: wherein the Romanes vſed orderly diſtributions of aduancemēt, &amp; graces to ech on, as the proweſſe &amp; nobleneſſe of the Souldiers deſerued.
            The nature and due honour, of Militarie profeſſion being ſuch: what meaneth the vulgare multitude of the Engliſh Nation, ſo maliciouſly to contemne ſoldierſhip, and ſo brauely to deſpiſe the profeſſion of Armes, as a vile, and damnable occupation? Surely, bicauſe they are of ſeruile and vnnoble heartes: fooliſh in diſcretion, idle bellies, careleſſe of the common welth of their countrie, litle friendly to mankinde in generall, and leſſe zealous toward the glory and preſeruation of their Soueraigne Prince and gouernement. Nowe be it they may ſeeme to voide this rebuke with a ſleight, in denying to contemne Militarie profeſſion: for they honor the, profeſſion, and doe accordingly eſteeme of all them that worthily purſued the ſame: But to deſpiſe the common ſortDiſſolute ſoldiers ar worthely deſpiſed. of our Countrie men that go to warre, of purpoſe more to ſpoyle, then to ſerue: and as vnder colour of purſuite of Armes, they put themſelues to the libertie and vſe of ſwearing, dronkenes, ſhameles fornication, dicing, and Theeuery, in ſlowe warres, &amp; vnder loaſe gouernment in the tumultuous ſtate of a forein nation, where they thinke it a fooliſhe ſcrupuloſitie, to vſe either tendernes of conſcience, or yet any honeſt maners: So doe they returne into their Countrie, ſo much corrupted with all maner of euils, that they ſeeme rather to come from hel, then from the exerciſe of warlike armes, or frō the regiment of militarie diſcipline: &amp; therefore ſo venemous a broode to their natiue countrey (ſtanding in ciuill peace and gouernement) that they are rather to bee vometed out of the bulke of the common wealth, then to be nouriſhed in the ſame. To contemne ſuch (ſay they) yea, to abhor them as ye ſhame of martial armes, &amp; to cut them of, as ye moſt infectiue neſt of domeſtical ſociety, is both honeſt &amp; neceſſary by al ciuil, &amp; diuine policy, &amp; diſcretiō.

And as for thoſe that are worthely called martialiſtes, bearing the true forme and ſubſtance of military men, they (ſay our people) are highely to bee eſtemed and maineteyned as the honorable and neceſſary membres of the ſtate publique.
            If the contemners of martiall Armes did kéepe themſelues within the compaſſe of theſe reaſones and diſcretion, they coulde not bee iuſtely reproued: for the wicked in his wickednes is not to bee defended, bicauſe he profeſſeth chiualry, or bicauſe he is a diuine. Let the euil therefore beare the blame and ſhame of hisThe profeſſion of Armes is honorable though ſome profeſſours ſtand rightly vnreproued. owne treſpaſſe, and let the profeſſion that is honorable in it ſelf nature, goe vnuiolat, though al the profeſſors of the ſame ſhoulde ſtande rightly reproued. If all the Preachers of the word of trueth and ſaluation were corrupt bellies: yet ſtandeth the heauenly doctrine true and perfit in his own qualitie. Militarie occupation doth execute the high Juſtice of God vpon earth, though all the followers of the ſame were moſt horrible &amp; wicked (as the greater number of thē is) yet muſt the occupation by it ſelfe propertie ſtand honorable in the world, as the two edged ſworde of the Lord God of hoſts, to whom al Scepters &amp; ſwordes doe perteine, and by his power and direction are vſed to effect.
            Now let vs examine the matter to trie whether theſe contemners doe directly deſpiſe the verie ſelfe profeſſion of Armes, or noe. If they doe not, then doe they fauor it: and grantinge it to bee commendable and neceſſarie, they deſire to practiſe the vſe thereof in their domeſticall paſtymes and exerciſes: they couet the company of ſuch as can inſtruct them in the ſame: they are prouided of habilements for the purpoſe, they loue honeſt Souldiers, &amp; are frendely to them: they put themſelues forth to the publike ſhew &amp; practiſe before the preſence of the royal maieſty and the nobilitie: they ſtriue in emulation to excel in the redines &amp; knowledg

of Military order, and in the vſe of their weapons: they deſire to ſerue againſt the inteſtine diſturbers of the State publike, and couet to fight againſt the inuaders of their countrie: and are liberall in contributing to the charges of warres. But when the prince commandeth Muſters through the realme in citie, towne, and country, and to appointe ſelecte people to be numbred and deuided into bands, for to be practiſed and exerciſed in the vſe and order of Armes, that thereby the realme may bee the better furniſhed of Militarie men for the fielde, and thereby ſtand in the more aſſurance if neede of warre ſhall happen: for the hoſte of an vnſkilfull multitude in Armes, is before an Armie of experimented warriours, as a flocke of ſheepe before a troupe of wolues: which conſideration ſhould moue honeſt heartes feruently to deſire to be of profitable value for this occupation: wherein conſiſteth the preſeruation of the ſoueraigne maieſtie, and of the ſtate publike: and conſequently of euery particular ſtate and perſon comprehended in the ſame.
            If then I ſay, the rurall man, by bribes, by a liuerieContemners of Arme Coate, by franke laboured friendſhip, by counterfaite ſickenſſe, or by ſtarting from his houſe vnder colour of farre buſines, doth ſhifte himſelfe from the ordinances of the prince, in ſo high and prouident direction: hee is not onely to bee counted a contemner of Armes, but is alſo (whether he be gentleman, or yeoman) to be rebuked with diſcredit, eyther as a ſlouthfull cowarde, or els to be puniſhed with ſtripes, as a traiterous contempner of his ſoueraigne prince and country. If the citizen or towneſman, doe inlike wiſe put forth his apprentice, his ſeruaunt, or poore hireling, to ſupply his place, and to withdraweth his owne perſon from the royall ordinances being himſelf of cōmendable ſufficiencie in body had it an honeſt heart) he is to be noted, eyther a fearefull cowarde, and dare not deale with Armes, or els a

ſlouthfull beaſt, or els in the abundance of his welth, in the height of his proud countenance, or in the opinion of his grauity: a diſpiſer of ſo contemtible a ſtate, as to march with a Calieuer, or a Pike on his backe in the rankes of poore ſouldiers (men ſtripped in light clothes, bearing their tooles in their hands, ready at euery moment to be offered vp in the praiſe of martiall proweſſe, for the ſeruice of their prince &amp; countrye) &amp; conſequently, diſdaineth the profeſſion, and beareth a faint courage toward his ſoueraigne prince &amp; country: &amp; therefore not to be accepted amongſt the men of ſounde loyalty, &amp; honorableThe deſcription of them that be no louers of Armes. value: no thogh his riches be neuer ſo much. He (whatſoeuer ſtate or profeſſion he be of) yt hath liuer beſtow fiue poūdes on a ſuperfluous banket, to fill ye gluttoniſh wombs of greaſy ſwine ye are ouer fat, rather thē a ſhilling on a deſtitute ſoldier: he is no louer of Armes.
            He that will rather beſtowe ten thouſand pound on a purchaſe, then giue his xl. s. toward the furniſhing of an honeſt minded poore gentleman to the warres: the ſame is no louer of Armes.
            He that ſeeth a mā of good ablenes, diſtreſſed with nakednes, &amp; hunger, begging his relief, &amp; wandring in miſeries, without home or harborogh? &amp; rather then he wil comfort them with a Teſtone, would beſtow fiue pon̄ds on the lyning of a ſōmer gowne, &amp; fiue thouſand poūdes to purchaſe leaſes ouer the heads of the poore, &amp; to builde vp olde rotten tenements of the new, yt he may enhance the rents thereof: that fellow is no louer of armes, but a caterpiller in the orchards, and a noyfull ſwine in the meddowes of the common welth of his countrie.
            He that wil rather beſtow a hundreth poūds on building of a banketting houſe in his garden, then a hundreth ſhillings in a ſubſidie to ayde the charges of his prince in the affaires of his country: the ſame ſurely, (if any ſuch be in England) is no louer of Armes: neither hath he any fancie to militarie exerciſe.
            
               He that had rather hang twenty able men for ſmal offences (forced through the extréeme oppreſſion of miſerable want) then to relieue on diſtreſſed body, &amp; to plant him in ſtate to liue without euil ſhiftes: ſurely the ſame man is no louer of Armes. For he that loueth Armes, loueth men alſo: &amp; he that acknowledgeth the honor and value of warlike profeſſion, wil be tender ouer the liues of men: and will therefore open his purſe to helpe the diſtreſſed: leſt through want he fal to euill &amp; perdition.
            Looke ſo many of our nation as are tainted with theſe faults, &amp; ſuch like, are contēners of armes, &amp; conſequently no faithful friends or louers of their prince &amp; country, &amp; likewiſe improuident toward their own priuate ſtate:The eſtate of that countrey is ruinous that is not able to ſtand in Armes. for where ye common welth is in hazard, there ye coward &amp; the couetous are in one aſſurāce: &amp; where ye ſtate publike maketh wrack, there doth periſh ye louer of himſelf, &amp; the fooliſh contemner of armes alſo. For the ſtate &amp; nation that is not able to ſtand in arms, &amp; to vanquiſh the rage &amp; power of both inteſtine &amp; forrein violence, ye ſame is ſure to be reuenged vnder the oppreſſion &amp; luſt of the ſpoilers, at one time or other: &amp; then go al things to hauock, the gold of the couetous, &amp; the mony of the vſurer, the deintye wife, &amp; the tender daughter, ye delicate ſonne made a ſlaue, ye proud &amp; rich father loden with giues, clothed with vermin, &amp; fed with penury, &amp; beatē wt ſtripes, til he gree to redeeme himſelfe with a greater ranſome then he is euer able to ſatiſfie. The gay houſes with the winter parlours, and ſommer parlours, with the inner Chambers, and the vtter, conſumed with flames, and the whole Citie with fire: their ſtreetes and fieldes lying couered with the deade carkeiſes of them that contemned proweſſe, and had Armes in deriſion: the wiues and children wandering harbourleſſe without honour, or ſuccour, beſtowe their carkeiſes amongeſt the aſhes, and ruines of their deſolate habitations, and in the Buſhes, the infant likewiſe with his mother, ſtarue

with hunger and nakedneſſe. Theſe dreadfull matters, made ye wiſe Lacedemonians, to bring vp al their youth in harde diet, thinnely clothed, poorely bedded: extréemelyThe Lacedemonias bringing vp. holden in the practiſe of difficult feates, in labour of the bodie, in the feates of actiuitie, and vnder the practiſe and rudimentes of militarie weapons and orders: that in all points they might be perfectly faſhioned for the warres.
            The like conſiderations made the Romanes to purſue the exerciſe of warre (for many yeares at the foundation of their ſtate) without wages or ſtipende: and whileſt they did growe, there was neuer Citizen in Rome eſtéemed noble for his riches, but for his prudence &amp; proweſſe. Nay, the man of Rome that omitted armes, and became a merchant, for gathering of aboundance of riches, was rather reckoned amongſt the ſeruaunts, then eſtéemed as a very Romane.
            
            The French alſo do not eſtéeme a merchant worth thouſandes, ſo much as they do a valiant ſouldier not worth a Teſtone in wealth. So in Germany, &amp; likewiſe in Spaine, howbeit, the Lawier, and Merchant, the Ruſtique, and Clearke, that by honeſt bountie and frendly grace towarde Martialiſtes, doe ſhewe them ſelues to be louers of armes, and to honour warlike proweſſe: are in their vocation greatly to be worſhipped and prayſed. But the merchauntes and Lawyers of moſt countries in the continent, thinke not ſo to ſatiſfie the deſire of their owne credite and eſtimation, or ſo to accompliſhe their bounden loyaltie towarde the ſtate publique: that by their fauour &amp; liberalitie towards men of warre, it were ſéemely &amp; lawful for them to withdraw themſelues from the pollice and vſe of armes: and therfore doe labour to be ſkilfull in the vſe of warlike weapons, and in the pollicies eke, and orders of the warre, and ſtand) ech according to his ability) alway furniſhed for the feelde, as the merchants, &amp; Citizens in high Almaine,
               
are horſemen: the Artificers are footemen. Neyther doe the citizens of high Almaine, that are of ſegnioritie and worſhippe, euer walke abrode in the ſtreets, without their Swordes by their ſides: For where the men of chiefe rule and creditte in a citie, doe leaue of the vſual wearing of domeſtical weapons, within their owne iuriſdictions, there ſéemeth the ſtate or citie to be vanquiſhed and ſubdued to an Armed ruler, that for auoiding of mutinies and rebellions, forbiddeth the inhabitants to beare any Armorie.
            Well, this diſcourſe may ſeeme more tedious then auaileable: for it is harde to teache an olde horſe to manach: ſo is it nothing hopefull, to ſee the ſecure ruſtikes, and dayntie citizens of England, faithfully to fauour the purſuite of Armes, much leſſe to practiſe the vſe and ſkill thereof: For ſay they, it belongeth not vnto them, neither doth the ſtate of our Countrie (and as they hope it ſhall not) ſtand in any ſuch neede, that men of credit, of worſhippe, and of wealth, ſhould be driuen to enter the occupations of Souldiours: for their purſes ſhall ſerue the turne.
            If they will aunſwere men ſo, I will reaſon a litleThey that mak ſhifts not to beare armour are corrupted with three vices. farther with them, letting then to vnderſtande more plainely, the improuidence and ſtraightneſſe of their heartes: for theſe reproueable ſhiftes cannot proceede but from a minde ſpecially corrupted with three great faultes: the one is Auarice, the other is Selfe loue, the third is very diſdain, &amp; (as I haue ſaid) a very great contempt of the profeſſion it ſelfe: which haue no dwelling places, but in harts wanting wiſdome, and all the parts of high and vertuous nobleneſſe.
            If theſe men would lift vp their eyes from the greedy deſire of fleſhly luſt, and ſet their heartes at libertie from the wretched bondage of ſeruile loue to this preſent worlde and to the vanities thereof, and diſcreetly conſider the alterations and troubles of all the States,

kingdomes, and nations of the continent, throughout all the whole flower of the olde Romane Empire, and how things doe dayly more and more encliue to dangerous and dreadfull chaunges, and then conclude that England alſo (though in the middeſt of the great Ocean) is a worldly ſtate and kingdome, ſubiect (as the reſt are) to the vncertenty of peace &amp; proſperity, ſtanding renged withall the world, vnder the ſword of Gods high iuſtice: and therefore, doubt the fraile felicity of their Countrie, and accordingly haue care and regard to the ſame. Then would they vſe the endeuors of wiſe hearts, then would they loue vertue, embrace godlines, honor Armes, and conſequently prouide and furniſhe themſelues (eche one after his habilitie) of thoſe habilements yt are behoueful and neceſſary for couert &amp; defence, in the day when the Lord ſhall viſite the pride and ſecurity of men, powring out the tempeſt of is wrathfull indignation, eyther by forren: or inteſtine war, or els by both: which doth orderly fal at one time or other, vpon all and euery nation vpon earth, ſo yt not one citie of the whole worlde can ſcape the araignement of the moſt high, when hee ſetteth him down to iudge. The armour that ſaueth all men, and nations from the dint and dart of the enemy, is a ſure faith, an humble feare, ſounde loue and truſt in the Lorde God of hoſts, through Chriſt Jeſus our Lord, that great conquerour, king of kings, Lord of Lords. The wiſdom eke and proweſſe that doth make a man pollitike in warres, is heauenly contemplation, and a righteous hearte maketh the ſouldier inuincible in the battell: adding vnto theſe matters, the iron armour, the ſword, the ſpeare, the ſhield, and the horſe, the corſlet, and the pike, the murrian, and the caliuer, the bowe and the bill: with the requiſite ſkill, courage, induſtrie and agilitie that doe apperteine vnto the vſe of the ſame. The citie or kingdome that is ſtored of men, furniſhed with theſe habilements, may well ſet foorth an armie, compleate in armes, hopefull

of victorie, and aſſured of triumph.
            Of ſuch a ſuite of Militarie men, conſiſted the hoſtes of Moſes, and Iehoſuah, and Gedeons three hundreth, byThe Midianites vanquiſhed by Gedeon. whoſe proweſſe he vanquiſhed the mightie and dreadfull Armie of the enemies of Iſrael. When Iacob was appointed with any captaines, and bands of this Militarie perfection: then went the Lorde God of hoſtes with their Armies into the fielde: then were they ſure to vanquiſh their enemies, and to returne to their houſes with a ioyfull victorie: For one true Iſraelite was able to driue a thouſande Philiſtims to the flight. Such a Souldier was Ionathas, and ſuch was Caleb, and his ſonnes: ſuch was Dauid, and his worthie men, and ſuch was alſo Iudas Macchabeus and his brethren.
            Theſe were the good children of God: moſt valiant, and moſt famous in warlike proweſſe: For by vertue and armes, they became inuincible in the field, and moſt profitable in the citie. The chriſtā therfore, that deſireth to be worthily reckned amongſt the honorable, praiſed of the honeſt, &amp; eſtéemed with the wiſe &amp; faithful ſort: ye ſame muſt in martiall armes, &amp; eke in heauenly vertues, be a compleate Iſraelite. This being true, (as it is a heauenly trueth, and cannot be repugned, without the contempt of the high maieſty of the lord God of hoſts) let euery citizen &amp; rurall man, gentle or vngentle, noble or vnnoble, riche or poore, that meaneth to prooue himſelf a good chriſtian, a faithful Engliſhman, zealous toward the ſtate publike of his coūtry, of cōmendable integrity toward his prince and feruent in the loue and maintenance of Gods kingdome and glory vpon earth: let euery ſuch one I ſay, imbrace godlineſſe: honour, nouriſh, and exerciſe Armes, and learne with diligence, the ſkill and prudence that doe neceſſarily accompany the ſame.
            Though the purſes of the riche, doe ſufficiently ſerue ye turne in furniſhing forth others, to ſerue in their ſtéede in theſe warres, yt ſéeme rather voluntary or politike, thē

For if ciuill diſcord ſhould riſe, and the realme fall to Armes (as it is a rife matter) who were fitteſt to defende the Throne of the royall Maieſtie, the Judgement ſeate and the Citie, the Cradle, and Pulpit? Surely they that are likelieſt, of fayth, credite, and habilitie: therefore, are euen they to be committed to the practiſe and truſt of Armes: For in the day of tumult, the armed ſeruant wil be a cōmander of his vnarmed maſter, and the armed Sonne will be a terror to the vnarmed Father. Then wil the drudge and ſeruile man, the hireling, and fugitiue perſon, ſtarte from his Muſters, and ioyne himſelf with the mutiners: for vnto ſuch the hope of common ſpoyle, and the deſire of ruinous theft and libertie, is more delicate then the defence of ciuil gouernment, or the preſeruation of the weale publike: which ſhould moue them to preferre themſelues, and not their ſeruants, to the practiſe and profeſſion of Armes.
            Let London therfore, the royall Chamber, and head of the ſtate, appeare to loue Armes, and endeuor themſelues to aduance the knowledge &amp; practiſe of the ſame: and as they are more prudent, more honorable, more

mightie, &amp; more able then any ſtate, or particular countrey els within the Realme, and moſt conueniently aſſociated and vnited together, to enter, and to erect the familiar &amp; domeſticall practiſe of Military knowledge &amp; actiuity: ſo ſhuld they be an example &amp; an encouragemēt to al the reſt of ye cōminalty, to immitate thē with honeſt emulatiō, through the fauor &amp; authority of ye ſoueraigne maieſty, ye ſame being admited to ye people of honeſt ſtate &amp; credit, &amp; likelieſt in ciuil towardenes. So ſhoulde London be more honorable then earſt it hath ben, and the nation ſtrong and prudent againſt the day that thoſe vertues might happe to ſtande them in better ſtéede then much riches, and more auailable to the common welth, then al the lawe and merchandiſe in the lande.
            For methinketh that it is poore thing and a verie ignominiousCitizens ſhould be furniſhed and practiſed for the feelde. to ſee ſo large and rich a city, ſo populous of ſelect and paſſing manry, to bee ſo ignorante and ſo naked of warrelike adreſt and endeuours. The Frenche citizins are furniſhed and practiſed for the féelde, ſo are the youthes, their ſonnes and ſeruantes. The citizens of Italy doe ſtriue to excelle the nobilitie in the knowledge and feates of Armes. The citizines of Germany profeſſe Armes, and are accordingly exerciſed and furniſhed for the ſame.
            In the litle citie Geneua, are 5000. citiziens of ordinaryDefenced cities. bandes ſworne in Armes: redy at a call in euerye moment. In Strasbourgh are likewiſe 8000. citizens redye to Armes at a cal: the like in Auſburge, in Norynbergh, and after the ſame maner in all other cities of Germany, and the Eaſt Countries, ech in adreſt, and appointment of Militarie forces, according to their largeneſſe, &amp; habilitie. And is London ſo ſure that it needeth not the very ſimple knowledge of Armes? and is it ſo careleſſe that it deſpiſeth the exerciſe of the feelde, as a matter nothing apperteining vnto them? Such ſlouth, and ſecuritie hath brought many a famous citie of the worlde to ruine, deſolation, and ſeruitude. London
               
might often times (in her life dayes) haue bene brought to the ſame predicament, had not their kings bene at hand, to ſtoppe and to vanquiſhe the inſolencie of ragiousVVherefore the Maiors of London are adorned with knighthood. rebbels, by the force of Armes. The ſword of one noble, citizen wonne more fame and honour to the citie of London, in killing the arrogant rebbell Iacke ſtrawe, then euer it had afore: and for that worthie fact, the Maiors of London, are adorned with knighthood, which is an honour properly perteining to chiualry: not to marchandiſe, nor to any other occupation, nor yet to the aboundance of riches.
            If they then, and their anceſters, citizens of London, are beholding to Military proweſſe, for the chiefe honour &amp; ancient (yea, and newe) preſeruation of their citie: why do they not honour the profeſſion, &amp; deſire libertie of their prince, to practiſe armes, and to nouriſhe Militarie practiſe amongſt themſelues? Their approued loyaltie ſhall not faile to obteine that grace of their bleſſed Queene. Then ſhould London be martial againſt the day of war, and able vpon the ſodaine to put it ſelfe in armes (the ſoueraigne prince and nobilitie being farre of, and otherwiſe entangled) for the repreſſion of domeſtical mutinies if any ſhould happen nere them, or towarde them: As all rebels haue their chief purpoſe to make hauok of Lōdon.
            
            It were a ſmall matter for the citie of London to haue fiue thouſand citizens of ſpecial manry, trained in arms, booked, and deuided into bands, and ready at a moment, if néed were: in which number, ſhould no ſeruant nor fugitiue perſon bee admitted, but the very houſholders, and their ſonnes: neither were it much for them to haue fiue hundreth furniſhed &amp; exerciſed horſes for the field. Anthony Fugger, the great money maſter of all Chriſtendome,Anthony Fugger, kept alwayes fiftie horſes of ſeruice in his owne ſtables in Auguſta, and ſo many warlike choſen Reiſters of his owne family. This number of trained people being euer redy to be leuied out of one citie at the ſodeine commandement

of their prince vpon ſodeine occaſion, might ſerue to a greater purpoſe, then twenty thouſande long in gathering, and them of rude and ignorant rurall people.
            And to ſpeak in general, pity it is to ſee ſo worthy a nation as ours is (ſo valiant &amp; actiue in arms, when they be entred in ye exerciſe therof) to be ſo poorely inclined to follow wars, &amp; to cōtinue the purſuit of chiualry: ye puniſhment therfore of our idle people cannot be to extreeme: ſo that there were a ſufficient order ſet down for ye employment of them But to ſay truely, let the ſoueraigne maieſty &amp; the court of parliament, prouide &amp; eſtabliſh neuer ſo eaſie, &amp; neuer ſo profitable &amp; ſéemly means for the ſuccour of the poore, &amp; for imploiment of the able people, this nation wil not obſerue it: ſuch ſlouth &amp; corruption is in the Juſtices of the country, &amp; in the magiſtrates of townes &amp; cities, &amp; eke ſuch peruers obſtinacie in the merciles harts of rich folke, both of towne and country, that euery mans endeuor wholly tendeth to his owne priuate profit, that of al hands they neglect, yea, &amp; contemne ye publike welth &amp; honour of their country: much leſſe do they regard the preſeruation of the poore: ſo dul &amp; ſenſeles is the common ſort of this nation: neither will it bee remedied for any thing that can be deuiſed or commanded, til God himſelf do remedy it with a ſcourge of his owne making. Fiue perſons ſtanding at the barre condemned to dye vpon the ſtatute of Rogues, &amp; vpon no other matter, proclamation was made in the ful appearance of the country, that if any would come forth and take any one of the condemned, and reteine him in ſeruice, &amp; anſwere for his behauiour, he ſhould deliuer a man from death, in all the throngs of the people there was not one moued with compaſſion ſo to doe, then were all theſe miſerable wretches executed: ſurely a hard condition amongſt the people that profeſſe Chriſt: whoſe commandement it is, that as we are his, ſo muſt we loue one another as he loued vs.
            Chriſt committed his body to the ſhamefull Croſſe, &amp;

his ſoule to the tormentes of hell, for the redemption of trayterous Rebbels againſt the high Maieſtie of God, and to reconcile the wicked to grace: and willeth vs to be mercifull, as our Heauenly Father is mercifull. But how farre we are from theſe qualities, the Lord he knoweth it, and ſo doe the poore. God ſurely will iudge it with a heauie ſentence.
            But ſurely, this is a true concluſion, that the man, the people, or nation that fauour not the renowme and maintenance of Military proweſſe, nor imbraſe the high value of Armes, the ſame are enemies to all vertues, neyther haue they reſpect to godlineſſe: but all to their owne bellies, as the ſwine. If the nouriſhment and practiſe of Armes ſhould depende on the voluntarie charges and endeuours of the common multitude, Martiall profeſſion ſhould lye in the ſtreete, vntill it were trodden to dunge.
            In deede it is not a matter that doth properly apperteine to baſe &amp; ſeruile mindes, but doth belong to the noble and ambitious courages. Let them therfore that are truely noble, loue Armes, and let them that chalenge, or loue the name of honour, vertue, honeſtie, or worthines, put their hands to the vſe and aduancement of warlike knowledge and actiuitie: yea, the more noble, the more prudent, and honorable that men will bee eſteemed, ſo much the more friendly to Armes ought they to be, and the like delightfull in the practiſe and vſe of the ſame.
            And as they eſteeme of it, ſo to eſteeme of them that do applye the occupation thereof in the feelde, where they ſuſtein no wanton labour, but are in continual trauail of the body, aud eke of the minde, dayly preſented to the daungers of death: whoſe hourely appearaunce to the Martialiſt in Armes, ſhoulde make him to conſider the frailtie of his ſtate, and the fewneſſe of his dayes, and therefore to apply his heart to wiſdome, and vertue, and to be alwayes, as a man prepared, and ready to be ſacrificed?

yet when the ſecure bellie doth reſt vpon an aſſured hope of long life: and hating the remembrance of death, hideth himſelfe from the ſight of wiſdome, and geueth ouer his heart to luſt and couetouſneſſe, the mother and nourſe of all euils.
            If any tongues more malicious, then diſcreet, will diſable our martialiſts, and defame our ſouldiours, and then make a falſe concluſion, againſt the profeſſion it ſelfe: let thoſe malignant ſpirites confeſſe the renowmedEngliſhmen by training vp, the moſt valiant and famous in martiall feates and knowledg value of our nation in the olde time, and grant (in ſpight of their beards) that we are the ſonnes of thoſe our Fathers, whoſe ſtrength and courage in martiall actiuitie, neither Scots, French, nor Spanyards, were able to reſiſt: nor yet ſafely to ſtand within the compaſſe and induſtrie of the Captaines: and that this preſent generation of the Engliſh people, being trained and exerciſed vnder the like conduct, nouriſhment, &amp; gouernment as our kindred were vnder the moſte famous kings, Richard the firſt, Edward ye firſt, Edward the third, Edward the blacke Prince, Henry the fifth, the Duke of Bedford, &amp;c. wold ſhew it ſelf to be the rightfully begotten children of the olde Engliſh Fathers, moſt valiant and famous in Militarie feates and knowledge: yea, looke how much more ſubtile and perilous the warres at theſe dayes are, then they were in the olde time: by ſo much the more ſhoulde we exceede our anceſters in the affaires of the ſame, if wee were accordingly imployed and mainteined.
            Let therefore, the gratious Nobilitie of England (Fathers to their Prince, people, and common wealth) remember, that as martiall profeſſion muſt of neceſſitie bee vſed and nouriſhed, that euen the followers of the ſame muſt be likewiſe eſtemed and mainteined: and eke to ſet downe an arreſt, for the domeſticall practiſe of the ſame. 
                  Ʋſus enim promptos facit. And that being continued through the Realme by ſuch order and direction,

as may conueniently and ſufficiently be proportioned and ſtabliſhed: there ſhould be within a few yeres, many thouſandes of able Souldiers in England, that neuer ſaw enemie in the field: and that with ſmal charges to the Soueraigne Maieſtie.
            And as all Souldiers of worthineſſe and knowledge are to bee highly eſtéemed and mainteined, ſo are the gentlemen, and worthie people of our nation that haue purſued the defenſory warres in the lowe Countrie, ſpecially to be praiſed: for they haue approued that the olde Engliſh valiancy is not ſo extinguiſhed in the Engliſh nation through long ſecuritie, and corrupt idleneſſe, but it is ſoone ſtirred vp to a double force, when it hath a while acquainted it ſelfe with the exerciſe of the fielde.
            Record of their ſeruice in Brabant againſt the Spaniards, vpon Lammas day laſt: where the Commanders ſhewed commendable value of prudence and courage, and in likewiſe the common ſeruitours, honeſt hardineſſe, and worthy actiuity: and are therefore to be cheriſhed for their owne deſerts, and eke to bee eſteemed fo the encouragement of others.
            And for that I haue here made mention of the ſeruice of our nation in Brabant, that it may bréede further encouragement vnto others that are likewiſe wel minded vnto Martial occupatiō: I haue thought good briefly to ſet downe the maner of their ſeruice done at the ſame time, that the worthy acts of thoſe valiant &amp; worthy captaines and ſouldiers, may remain a proofe of the value of the Engliſh nation, and ſhew that they are not ſo far degenerate from the high courage and manlines of their aunceſtors &amp; forefathers, but that (if they were exerciſed and accuſtomed to the field &amp; practiſe thereof) they woulde ſoone attaine and deſerue their priſtinate valiantnes, and ſo become a terror to their enemies, as their forefathers in times paſt haue bene.
            
               It is to be noted, that the campe of the States of the lowe Countrie, lay entrenched in a great heath or ſandie ground, on the right hand of whoſe campe towards Loueine there was a ryuer ranne all along, and without the trenches on the ſame ſide, was the Engliſhe and Scottiſhe mens warde, wherein was a hill that the Spanyardes layd hard at to haue gotten, which if they coulde haue wonne, from the ſame they might haue diſcryed all their maner of dealing in the States Campe. On the other ſide of the campe toward Aſkot, was another hill, vpon the which, the horſemen of the States kept ſcoutwatch, and betweene theſe two hils was a great valley of champion grounde, with ſome ſmal ſandie hils at the entring into the plaine.
            On the farther ſide of the plain, were certain houſes, which the Engliſhmen ſet on fire, thereby to anoy the enemy. The horſemen of the States which lay in ſcoute vpon the hill, on the left hand, perceiuing the Armie of Don Iohn to approche out of the ſtreight into the plaine, ſent worde vnto the Captaines of the Engliſhmen and Scots, willing them to ſtande manfully to it that day againſt the enemie, and to doe their beſt, and they ſhoulde be aſſured that they woulde not forſake them, but liue and dye with them.
            Whereupon the Chiefe commaunders of the Engliſhe and Scottiſhe regiments went to counſell, to take aduice for the ordering of their companies, and howe they might endomage the enemie, fully purpoſing to trie the value and courage of their enemies, for that ſuch a brute had bene ſpreade ouer the worlde (but eſpecially in all the lowe Countries) of their inuincible proweſſe and knowledge in Martiall diſcipline, as though there were not any nation that durſt encounter them in the fielde. After good aduice taken, euerie Captaine &amp; officer was appointed to his charge for ye day, as ſome to ſtand in battel, ſome to lie in ambuſh, others to

relieue their fellowes wt freſh ſhot, and ſome to furniſh them that wanted ſhot and pouder: and the chiefe Coranels taking to them certaine valiant gentlemen, and a conuenient number of approued ſouldiers, determined to giue the onſet vpon the enemy.
            Betwixt nine and ten of the clocke in the morning, the horſemen of Don Iohn iſſued out of the ſtreight, into the plaine &amp; champion ground, whereupon the States horſemen (for what purpoſe, it was to vs vnknowne)The Engliſh and Scottiſhmen encounter the Spanyards at Pel Mel. retired within their trenches, and there abode vntill they ſaw which way the game went, and who had the better. The footmen alſo of the Spanyards, being entred into the plaine, the chiefe Coranels of the Engliſh and Scottiſhe regiments, taking to them thoſe looſe ſhotte which were before appointed, encoūtred the Spanyards vpō the plain, and delt ſo hotly and frankly with them at Pel Mel, that within thrée quarters of an houre they made them forſake the plaine, and retire ouer, into the fields, there nere adioyning: at the entrie whereof was many a man ſlaine, to the great diſcouragement of the whole Armie of Don Iohn, and the Spanyardes. Thus through the goodneſſe of God (in whoſe quarrell they fought) for the aduancement of his name and true religion, and by the proweſſe of thoſe valiant Engliſh men that there ſerued vnder the States (whoſe noble harts ſheweth forth a liuely patterne of the proweſſe of their progenitors) with the aide onely of a few Scottiſh men that ſerued there alſo: ſo terrified the harts of the Spanyards, that amongſt all the encounters that I haue ſene in al the time that I haue ſerued, for theſe xxij. yeares, I neuer ſawe enemies ſo danted with any loſſe or repulſe as the Spanyards were that day, in flying the fury of the people, they being of ſo great ſtrength, and our folke but a fewe looſe ſhot. Then iſſued forth the Graue van Buſſu, generall of the States armie, and ſtood vpon a litle hill, facing the horſemen of of Don Iohn, and vewing

the maner of the ſkirmiſh. After that the Spanyards were thus driuen to forſake the plaine, and to retire into the cloſes neere adioyning, ſeeing the inuincible courage of our men, durſt not any more come forth into the plaine, but now and then ſalyed out, and ſtraight wayes retired in againe. About foure or fiue a clocke in the after noone, the Engliſh and Scottiſh ſouldiers were ſo ſtirred vp, that they determined no longer to ſtande dallying with the Spanyardes, but purpoſed to forſake the plaine champion, and to follow the Spanyardes intoThe Spanyards put to flight. the fieldes, and there to haue them by the eares. Don Iohn ſeeing his footmen were put to the worſe, and fearing a further miſchief, was driuen of neceſſity to make a profer with his horſemen, but did not breake, which cauſed our men to ſtay their going ouer into the fields, ſo that in this meane while, the Spaniſh footmen (before the Engliſh &amp; Scottiſh men were a ware) were a quarter of a mile off, retiring in running maner ouer hedge and ditch with their enſigns, and ſo ended the ſkirmiſh. The Coranels and captaines both of the Engliſhmen and Scots did lead the ſeruice themſelues that day, with ſuch great boldneſſe, that it greatly imbaſed the glory and force of the Spanyards, and had vtterly ouerthrowen them, if the horſemen had done their endeuor halfe ſo well as did the footmen.
            Thus gentle reader I haue briefly deſcribed the ſeruice of our countrimen vppon Lammas day laſt paſt, whoſe valiant ſeruice, for the exalting of the worde of God, &amp; honor of their countrie, deſerueth the fauourable liberalitie of all honeſt and louing harts, yt where occaſion ſerueth and need requireth, they would reach forth their hands, and out of their plentie, relieue the neceſſitie of ſuch poore ſoldiers as haue aduentured their liues for the aduauncement of true religion: ſo ſhall others thereby be encouraged to imploy themſelues in the like ſeruice, and be ready, and preſt at all times to offer vp

themſelues and their ſeruice in the defence of the quiet ſtate and proſperitie of their prince and countrey: for theſe dayes are dangerous, and more dangerous will yet be.
            Honos enim alit artes.
            Let England therefore while it hath bleſſed reſt and leaſure, wiſe regiment, and God preſent in the Sanctuarie, waken it ſelfe out of ſenſeleſſe ſecuritie, and diligently looke to her Tacles: for a ſtorme will come, and a tempeſt will fall: for at this preſent houre, the hand of the Lord God of hoſtes is in the ſeconde time for gathering together of the remnant of Iſrael: the yeere of his redeemed is come, and euery kingdome that wil not ſerue the Lord, ſhal vtterly periſh from the earth: ſtand faſt therefore, O ye people of England, for the ſworde of the Almightie is drawne, and will not be put vp till hee hath confounded, and vtterly conſumed all the enemies of Iacob from the face of the earth for euermore. Euerie vaine and miſbelieuing ſoule is aduerſary to Iacob, and it ſhalbe cut of. Serue the Lorde therefore in trueth of heart, and remember the wonderful benefites and bleſſings of God ſo abundantly beſtowed vpon you, &amp; vpon your fathers, and be thankful: for you and they haue enioyed your countrey many yeres in vniuerſal peace, and in dayly increaſe of priuate and publike proſperity. The Lorde hath nowe twiſe deliuered you his Goſpell without blood, and in this ſecond reſtitution, he hath holden you twentie yeeres in the free occupation thereof, without murther or moleſtation: the Lord hath not ſo dealt with your neighbours, looke vpon the miſerable ſtate of France, and lowe Dutchland, and in the viewe therof conſider the goodnes and prouidence of your heauenly Father towardes you: for their troubles haue nouriſhed your reſt, and their miſeries haue continued your bleſſings. Sée into the procéedings of the Amighty,

and be wiſe hearted, leſt through lewde ingratitude you moue the Lord God of hoſtes to wrath, &amp; through your rebellious inſolencie, you prouoke the moſt high to forſake his Sanctuary in England: as they of Iudah and Ieruſalem through their wickednes draue him to abandon his holy mounte Sion in the dayes of Zedekiah. But if the Lord depart from you, woe ſhalbe vnto you, as it was to them of Iudah and Ieruſalem.
            
            Looke wiſely to your ſelues, and as ye loue the aduancement of Gods kingdome in England, ſo will you pray and labour for the prefermēt of the ſame amongſt the French &amp; Dutch: as that the Lord may ſet his ſanctuarie at reſt amongſt them as he hath done it amongſt vs, and that they may haue the grace ſo to receiue, and ſo to reteine the Lord their God, as he may haue delight to continue with them.
            As time draweth to his ende, and the corrupt world to her death, ſo ſhall all maner of euils abound amongſt men: and theſe laſt dayes ſhalbe troubleſome, daungerous and cruell, for the laſt drams of Sathan that muſt fill vp the meaſure of wickedneſſe to the brimme, ſhalbe moſt infectiue and peſtiferous: be wiſe therefore, and acquainte your ſelues with armes, both corporal and ſpiritual, that you may at al times and in all cauſes be compleat Iſraelites ready for the fielde. God grant▪ it
            The Lorde God of hostes bleſſe and preſerue our good Queene ELIZABETH, the Nobilitie, people, and comminaltie of England. Lord, Amen.
            FINIS.
