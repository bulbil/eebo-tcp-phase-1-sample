            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

kings of Rome were added; whereby the city, and the Pomoerium,
that is, the territories of the citie were enlarged:
and Rome was called vrbs ſepti-collis .i. the citie vpon ſeaven
hils. Vpon this Palatine hill alſo ſtood the Aſylum, or

ſanctuarie of refuge, which Romulus openedAlex. Gen. dier. l. 3. c. 20. in imitation
of Cadmus, who at the building of Thebes was ſaid to haue
opened a ſanctuarie of refuge, whither whatſoever malefactor
could eſcape, were he bond or free, hee was not to be
puniſhed. It was much like vnto a cuſtome of the people
in the citie Croton, who flying, vnto the altars of their
Gods, obtained the forguieneſſe of faults not voluntarily
committed. Whence theſe two phraſes are expounded alike,

                     De monte Capitolino.
                     THis hill was famous for three names: it was called
Capitolium, mons Tarpeïus, and mons Saturni. It was
named Saturnes hillRoſin. antiq. li. 1. c. 5. from the heatheniſh God Saturne,
who vouchaſafed to vndertake the protection of that
 place. It was named the Tarpeïan hillPlutarch. in Romulo. from Tarpeïa one
of the Veſtall Nuns, daughter to the chiefe-keeper of the
 Capitoll (this hill being the caſtle of defence for the whole
towne.) For this Tarpeïa betrayed the Capitoll into the enemies
hands, bargaining to haue the golden bracelets vpon
her enimies left hands for this her treaſon. Now the enimes
when they were admitted in did caſt not their brace
lets alone but their bucklers alſo vpon her, through the
weight whereof ſhe was preſſed to death: vpon which occaſion
the whole hill was afterward called the Tarpeïan
mount; but more principally a certaine rocke
of that hill called Tarpeïa rupes, from whence
malefactours were ſundry times tumbled head-long.
 The ſame hill was likewiſe called the Capitoll, becauſe
when the foundation of a certaine Temple, built in

the honour of Iupiter, was laid a mans head full freſh, and
liuely, as if it had bin lately buryed,Dion. Halicar. lib. 4. yea hot bloud iſſuing

of this man being aliue was Tolus, and hence from Caput
and Tolus the whole hill was called Capitolium.

                     THis hill being in former time called Agonalis, then
began to be called Quirinalis, whē certaine Sabines,
called in Latine Curetes, came and inhabited there,
(truce being made betweene the Romanes, &amp; the Sabines:)
though ſome woulde therefore haue it named Quirinalis,
becauſe there was a temple erected in the honor of Romulus,
called alſo Quirinus. It was called in the time of the
Emperours mons Caballus, that is, the horſe-hill, taking its
denomination from two marble ſtatues of Alexander taming
his horſe Bucephalus: which ſtatues Conſtantine the
Emperour brought to Rome, and placed thē in the middeſt
of certaine bathes, which he made vpon this hill. There do
appeare in this hill three riſings, or hillockes, the one being
called Salutaris, the other Martialis, &amp; the third Latiaris.

edifices, which for a time ſerved as his palace: but afterward

Rome retained the name Septi-collit .i. the city vpon 7.

                        FOrum hath diverſe acceptions: ſometimes it is taken
for a place of negociation, or marchandiſing, which
we call a market-place; and being taken in this ſenſe
it hath commonly ſome adiectiue ioined with it, as Forum
boarium, the beaſt-market, forum piſcarium, the fiſh-market,
Olitorium forum, the hearb-market. Other times it is
taken for any place, whereſoever the chiefe governour of a
province doth cōvocate his people togither, there to giue
iudgement according to the courſe in law: whence a man
is ſaid Forum agere,
                        Hubertus in Cic. lib. 3. ep. fam. 6. when he keepeth the Aſſiſes, and Forum
indicere, when he appointeth the place, where the Aſſiſes
ſhalbe kept. Thirdly it is taken for a place, where controverſies

in law are iudicially determined, and orations
are had vnto the people. And of this ſort there wereRoſin antiq. lib. 9. c. 7. fix
diſtinct Forums: One called Forum Iulium, becauſe it was 
built by Iulius Caeſar. A ſecōd was added by Octavius Auguſtus,
                        
called therefore Auguſti Forum. The third Forum
                        
was founded by Domitian the Emperour: but by reaſon
of his ſuddaine death Nerva had the finiſhing thereof.
It had the name of Forum Tranſitorium, the tranſitorie
Forum, becauſe there was tranſitus .i. a way or
paſſage through it into three ſeverall market places. A 
fourth was added by the Emperour Traianus, wherein was
erected a ſtately columne or pillar 140 cubites high, having
all the noble exploits performed by Traianus engraven
in it. Another was called Saluſtij Forum, becauſe Saluſt
                        
bought it with diverſe gardens adioyning, which ſince
haue beene called horti Salustini. The laſt Forum, which indeed 
was firſt built, and in all reſpects excelled the reſt, was
called Forum Romanum, and Forum vetus, or by way of excellēcy
the Forum, as if there were no other Forum. Where
we muſt vnderſtand, that as often as Forum is vſed in this
latter ſenſe, namely for a pleading place, it is ſo vſed figuratiuely,
by the figure Synecdoche: for in truth the pleading
place, wherein Orations were had, was but one part
of the Forum Romanum, namely that Chappell, or great
building, which they called Roſtra.

of many men, which were wont to walke vnder theſe Baſilicall
buildings, and therefore were called Subbaſilicani

for marchants to deale in their buſineſſes. Thoſe of chiefe

a great large hall of iuſtice, which for a long time
was open at the top having no covering, and for
that reaſon the aſſemblies were often diſſolved in rainy,
or vnſeaſonable weather. In it ſtood the Tribunal, being a
place erected vp on high in forme of our pulpits, but many
degrees larger, &amp; in the midſt therof the Sella Curulis .i. the
Ivory chaire, frō whence the chiefe magiſtrate adminiſtred
iuſtice; other inferior magiſtrats fitting on bēches on each

                     ANother part of the Forum was a ſanctuarie built in
the honour of Caſtor, and Pollux: theSueton. in Iulio Caeſare reaſon thereof
was becauſe they appeared vnto the Romans in
the Latine warre in the likeneſſe of two Angels ſent from
heaven to lead the Roman army, and to aſſiſt the Romans
againſt the Latines: who being vanquiſhed, they ſuddenly
were departed out of the field, none knowing how, &amp; even
in the ſame moment they appeared vpon their ſweating
horſes vnto the Roman citizens in the Forum, who taking
them for ſouldiers demanded what newes they brought
home from the campe: they replyed that the Romans were
conquerours: which newes being delivered, they ſuddenly
vaniſhed, and were ſeene no more. Vpon this occaſion did
A. Poſthumius being at that time Dictator, build a Temple
in that place of the Forum, where they were ſeen in honour
of them both. Although in the after ages it had the
name only of Caſtors Temple; Whence aroſe the ieaſt of M.

Bibulus againſt his fellow Conſul Iulius Caeſar, ſaying
that it fared with him, as it did with Pollux; .i. as this Temple
which was erected in the honour of both the brethren,
caried the name only of Caſtors Temple; ſo the great expēces
in exhibiting ſhewes in the time of their Conſulſhippe
though they went deeper on Bibulus his ſide, yet Caeſar caried
away all the thankes, and credit. Inſomuch that the
people being wont to ſubſcribe the names of both Conſuls
at the end of their deeds, and Charters, for a remembrance
of the yeare; that yeare they wrote, Such a thing
done not Bibulus, and Caeſar, but Iulius and Caeſar being

vp: whereof divers men coniecture diverſly. Alexander
Neop.
                        Alex. Gen. dier. l. 4. c. 15. ſaith, that Saturne found out the vſe of braſen mony:
and therefore this Temple might be thought the fitteſt
place for the treaſurie. Plutarch thinketh rather that the
making of the treaſurie in that place did allude to the integrity
of the time, wherein Saturne raigned, being the
worlds golden age.Alex. Gen. dier. lib. 2. c. 2. But the moſt receaued opinion is the
ſtrēgth of the place, whereby it was the ſafer from theeues.
This temple by reaſon of the vſe it was put vnto, was called
aerarium from aes .i. braſſe: which name now is common
to all treaſure houſes; for that the firſt mony vſed by the
Romans was of that metall, vntill the yeare of Rome 485

that before the vſe of braſſe they made money of leather:
whence Numa Pompilius is ſaid to haue given leather mony
in a dole vnto the people. Touching their order obſerved

in the treaſury, wee muſt vnderſtand that their care
in providing againſt ſuddaine dangers was ſuch, that they
laid aſide the twentieth part of their receits, which they
Alex. Gen. dier. lib. 2. c. 2. called aurum viceſimarium, Incenſimarium, and Cimiliarchiū,
into an inner chamber, or more ſacred roome, named

appointed that the twentieth part of certaine legacies
ſhould be laid vp to defray charges in extraordinary wars:
where it lay ſo priviledged, that it was a capitall crime to
vſe any of it, but in extreame, and deſperate neceſſitie. Notwithſtanding
howſoever it was vſed as a treaſure houſe,

their militarie enſignes, were contained there.Plutarch in ſuis problemat. vid. Franc. Sylviū in Catilinariam 4. And from

whereby one might go downe; and within it there was a
little couch with a burning lampe, and a few victuals: whither
the defiled Votary was to be brought through the
market place in a litter ſo cloſed vp with thicke leather,
that her mournings might not be heard to the moving of
pity. Shee being thus brought to the place of execution,
was let downe by a ladder into the hollow caue, and the

hole preſently ſtopped. And the reaſon why they ſuffered
ſuch a kinde of death, was becauſe they thought it not fit;
that ſhee ſhould be burnt with fire, which kept not the ſacred
fire with greater ſanctity. And it was thought vnlawfull
to puniſh them by laying violent hands on them, becauſe
they had in former time ſerved in ſo holy a function.

                        campus Martius, otherwiſe called Tiberinus, becauſe
it was neere the river Tiber was given vnto the
Romane people by Caïa Tarratia, a Veſtall Virgin: but
Tarquinius Superbus the laſt king of Rome did take it from
the people, converting it to his own private vſe: in ſo much
that he ſowed corne there, which, when he was depoſed,
the Romanes did caſt into the river Tiber, iudging it vnfit
that any man ſhould reape any commodity from ſo holy a
ground. In proceſſe of time the ſheaues of corn being ſtopped
in a ſhallow foard of the river, became firme ground,
and was called the holy Iland, or Aeſculapius his Iland.
And preſently after the expulſion of Tarquinius, this Campus
Martius was reſtored vnto its former vſe. Beſide the
naturall pleaſantneſſe of the place it ſelfe, it was beautified
with many ornaments brought out of the Capitol (the Capitoll
being too ful) as likewiſe with divers images of well
deſerving men. Hither did the younger ſort of Romanes
come to exerciſe al matters of chivaldry, namely the horſe-race,
the foot-race, wreſtling, fencing, vaulting, caſting the
bowle, the ſledge, the dart, vſing the ſling, the bow, with
ſuch like: &amp; vpon this occaſion it was dedicated to Mars,
and called by Strabo, the Romanes great ſchoole of defence.
In this field were men of beſt note burned, when they died.
Here were the kings, &amp; other magiſtrates at firſt created.
In thisServ. in Bucol. eclog. 1. field of Mars alſo was a place at firſt railed, like a

ſheepe-pen, called therfore Ovilia, or ſepta; but afterwards
it was mounted with marble-ſtone, beautified with ſtately
walkes, and galleries, and alſo with a tribunall, or ſeate of
iuſtice, within which precinct the people often times aſſembled
to giue their ſuffrages toward the election of magiſtrates.
The meanes of aſcending vp vnto theſe Ovilia
was not by ſtaires, but by many bridges made for that
time; every pariſh in the aſſembly of pariſhes, and every
tribe, or ward in the aſſembly of the tribes, and every hundred
in the aſſembly of cēturies having his bridge: whence
this proverbe was occaſioned, de ponte deijciendus .i. he is to
be barred from giving his voice,Ioan. Saxonius in orat pro S. Roſcio. Theſe bridges were not
made over any river, but over the dry land: whence men
were ſaid to be caſt, Non vt periclitarentur de vita, ſed ne
ſuffragarentur in Comitijs.

                     AMongſt other places where the Romanes exhibited
their plaies vnto the people, the moſt remarkeable
was the great Circque, or ſhew-place, called in Latine
Circus Maximus. It was a large peece of ground, lying
neere that part of the Aventine mount, where Dianaes tē
                        ple
ſtood. It was built by Tarquinius Priſcus with diverſe
galleries round about it, from whence the Senators, &amp; gentlemen
of the city did behold the running with great horſes
at liſts, the fire-workes, tumbling, the baiting, and chaſing
of wilde beaſts, &amp;c. In former time all did ſtand on the
ground, being ſheltred frō the raine by the helpe of boards
vpheld with forkes in manner of houſe-pentices: and this
cuſtome continued vntill the aforeſaid Tarquinius erected
thoſe galleries, called Fori, making thirty diſtinctious of
them, allotting every ward or company their ſeverall quarters

all the ſeats being able to containe one hundred fiftie
thouſand parties.Roſin. antiq. lib. 5. c. 4. Vnder theſe places were cels, or vaults,
where women did proſtitute their bodies, and would buy
ſtolne goods, and for this reaſon Horace calleth it Fallacem
circum .i. the deceitfull ſhew-place. There was at the one
end of the circque certaine barriers .i. places barred, or railed
in, at which place the horſes began the race; and at the
other end was the marke, whether the horſes ran: it was
called in Latin Meta, and the barriers carceres, à coercēdo.
Whence wee ſay à carceribus ad metam .i. from the beginning

afterward learned Poets compoſed Comedies, and Tragedies,
which were publikely acted in the city vpon a
ſtage: and although at the firſt it was counted infamous to
frequent them, yet afterward the Senators themſelues, yea
the Emperour, and all the chiefe of Rome aſſembled thither.

which ſtood behind, raiſed vp places with turfes of earth,
which gaue the people occaſion to call the place between
thoſe turfes, and the ſcaffold Cavea, .i. a caue, or den: yea
ſometimes the people that ſtood there were ſo called from

the place. Though the Theatre be now taken only for the
ſtage, yet then by it was vnderſtood all the whole roome,
where theſe plaies were acted: and it had diverſe parts,
ſome proper to the actors, ſome to the ſpectators. To the
actors belonged firſt the proſceniū

players came, where they apparelled themſelues, though
ſometimes it is taken for the ſcaffold, or ſtage it ſelfe: ſecondly
the pulpitum, that is, the ſtage, or ſcaffold vpon
which they acted: and thirdly the ſcena, that is, the

of hangings. Now that they might change their ſcene
according to their pleaſure, they made it eitherServius i

ſeeme to be put vp. And as I thinke, becauſe thoſe ſheepe-heards
did act no more at a time, then one of our ſcenes,
hence haue we diſtinguiſhed our playes into ſo many parts
which wee call ſcenes. The places which were proper to
the ſpectators were diſtinguiſhed according to their degree
and place: for the remoteſt benches were for the cō
                        mons,

of Rome, called therefore Equeſtria; the others,
wherein the Senators did ſit, were built betweene the Egueſtria,
and the ſtage in manner of a triangle, or a wedge
ſharpe towarde the ſtage and broad behinde, by reaſon
whereof thoſe ſeates were ſometimes called Cunei, but
more commonly Orcheſtra:
                        De Amphitheat. cap. 14. this may be collected out of
Lipſius. There was alſo another ſcaffold built quite round,
made as it were of two theatres ioined togither; It was
called Amphi-theatrum, &amp; differed from the theatrePancirollus lib rerum deperditarum cap. de amphitheat. only
as the full moone doth from the halfe, or a compleate rundle

maſters of fēce play their prizes. The area, or plot of groūd,
wherein theſe ſcaffolds did ſtand, was called cavea, for the
reaſon aboue-mentioned: &amp; it was alſo called arena, which
ſignifieth ſand, or gravell,Lipſius de Amphitheat. cap. 3. becauſe the ground was covered
with ſand, that the fencers, if any of them by chance fel
of the ſtage, might not hurt themſelues. And this gaue occaſion

whereof there is frequent mentiō in Comical authors.
It much reſembleth our bridewell, or place of correction,
being called in Latin piſtrinum à pinſendo, from pounding.
For before the vſe of mils was knowne the Romanes did
pound their corne in a greate mortar, calling the place
where they pounded it, piſtrinū. Wherevpon our hand-mil
hath retained the ſame name to this day: &amp; becauſe of the
great paines that men did ſuffer in pounding, hence grew a
cuſtome among them, that when a ſervant had offended,
his maſter would menace him in this manner, In piſtrinum
te dedam, I will caſt thee into Bride-well.

                     Moreover for the better vnderſtanding of claſſicall
autors, it will not bee impertinent to point at the
generall names, by which their religious places
were called: and to declare the proper acception of each
name. The names being theſe, Templum, Fanum, Delubrū,

                        This word Templum doth ſometime ſignifie thoſe

did quarter out with their crooked ſtaffe at their

commonly it doth ſignifie a Church, or Temple: in which

the ſpeaking of the Prieſt; but becauſe the people do there
ſpeake vnto God, and God againe to the people.
                     
                     
                        De Delubro.
                        Thirdly, a Church was called delubrum Synechdochic 
                           
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           
becauſe it was the principall part of the Church, namely
the place where their Idoll God ſtood; and it was called
delubrum from Deus:
                           Roſin. antiq. li. 2. ca. 2. as we call the place, where the candle
is put, candelabrum from candela. As concerning the
outward forme of the Churches, ſome were vncovered, becauſe
they counted it an hainous matter to ſee thoſe Gods
confined vnder a roofe, whoſe doing good conſiſted in being
abroad; Other-ſome covered, ſome round, ſome otherwiſe:
but within they much reſembled our great Churches.
They had their pronäon, or Church-porch, whereabouts
they were wont to haue the image of the beaſt
Sphinx, which was ſo famous for his obſcure riddles: ſo
that by this image was ſignifyed, that the oracles of the
Gods which were treated of within the Church were dark
and myſtical. They had certaine walkes on each ſide of the
body of the Church, which they called 
                              
                                 ••
                              rticus: &amp; in theſe
places it was lawfull for them to marchandiſe, make bargaines,
or conferre of any worldly buſineſſe; as likewiſe in
the baſilica, or bodie it ſelfe. But their quire called Chorus,
was counted a more holy place, ſet apart onely for divine
ſervice. The manner of hallowing it, was as followeth.

                           Roſin. ib. When the place where the Temple ſhould be built, had
beene appointed by the Augurs (which appointing, or determining
the place they called Effari templa, and ſistere
Fana) then did the party, which formerly in time of neede
vpon condition of helpe from the Gods had vowed a
Temple, call togither the Aruspices, which ſhould direct
him in what forme the temple ſhould be built: which being
knowne certaine ribbands, and fillets were drawne about
the area, or plat of ground with flowers, &amp; garlands
ſtrowed vnderneath, as it was probable to diſtinguiſh the
limits of this ground now to bee hallowed. Then certaine
ſouldiers marched in with boughes in their hands, &amp; after
followed Veſtall Nunnes leading young boyes, &amp; maides
in their hands, who ſprinkled the place with holy water.
After this followed the Praetor, ſome Pōtifie going before,
who after the area had beene purged by leading round about
it a ſow, a ramme, and a bull, ſacrificed them, &amp; their
entrals being laid vpon a turfe, the Praetor offered vp praiers
vnto the Gods, that they would bleſſe thoſe holy places,
which good mē intended to dedicate vnto them. This
being done the Praetor touched certaine ropes, wherewith
a great ſtone being the firſt of the foundation was tyed: together
with that other chiefe Magiſtrates, Prieſts, and all
ſorts of people did helpe to pluck that ſtone, &amp; let it down
into its place, caſting in wedges of gold, and ſilver, which
had never beene purified, or tryed in the fire. Theſe ceremonies
being ended, the Aruſpex pronounced with a loud
voice, ſaying, Nè temeretur opus, ſaxo, auróue in aliud deſtinato.
.i. let not this worke bee vnhallowed by converting
this ſtone, or gold into any other vſe.
                     
                     
                        De Aede ſacrâ.
                        Fourthly, a Church was called Aedes ſacra, an holy
houſe, becauſe of the ſacrifices, prayers, and other holy exerciſes
performed therein. Although (as Gellius hath long
ſince obſerved) every holy houſe was not a Church. For the

proper note of diſtinction betweene a Church, and a religious
houſe was this: that a Church beſide that it was dedicated
vnto ſome God, it was alſo hallowed by the Augures,
without which hallowing the edifice was not called
a Church, but a religious houſe: of which ſort was the Veſtall
Nunnerie, and the common treaſurie, called Aedes
Saturni. Wee may adde herevnto this word Pulvinar,

                              . which doth often ſignifie a church: the reaſon being taken
from a cuſtome amongſt the Painims, who were wont
in their churches to make certaine beds in the honour of
their Gods, and thoſe beds they called Pulvinaria from
pulvis, becauſe they were filled with duſt or chaffe.

                        Neere vnto diverſe temples ſtood certaine groues dedicated
to ſome of the Gods: they were called in Latine Luci à non lucendo, as diverſe ſay, by the figure antiphraſis. But
others are of a contrary opinion, giving it that name, becauſe
of the exceeding light it had in the night time by
reaſon of the ſacrifices there burnt.

                        The places vpon which they ſacrificed either in their
religious houſes, or their groues, were of three ſorts,
which we in engliſh tearme altars; but the Romans diſtinguiſhed
them by three ſeverall names, Scrobiculus, Ara,
and Altare.

                           Scrobiculus was a furrow, or pit containing an altar in
it, into which they poured downe the bloud of the beaſt
ſlaine, togither with milke, hony, and wine, when they ſacrificed
vnto an infernall God.
                     
                     
                        
                        De Arâ.
                        The ſecond kind of altar was called Ara, either ab ardendo,
becauſe their ſacrifices were burned vpon it: or from
their imprecations vſed at that time, which in Greeke they
called 
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           . It was made foure-ſquare, not very high from
the ground, or as ſome ſay, cloſe to the ground: and vpon
this they ſacrificed vnto the terreſtriall Gods, laying a
turffe of graſſe on the altar: and this gaue

                        The third ſort was called Altare, either becauſe it was
exalted, and lifted vp ſomewhat high from the ground; or
becauſe he that ſacrificed (by reaſon the altar was ſo high)
was conſtrained to lift vp his hands in altum, on high:Serv. in Bucolic. eclog. 5. and

                        Sigonius rendring
the definition of a Romane citizen, averreth that no man is
lege Optimâ .i. in full and compleate manner a citizen of
Rome, but he which hath his habitation there, which is incorporated
into a tribe, and which is made capeable of city
prefermēts. By the firſt particle thoſe which they terme
municipes; by the ſecond thoſe which they cal Inquilini; &amp;
by the third thoſe which they call Libertini are in a manner
disfranchiſed. But whereas Sigonius ſaith that they muſt
haue their habitation at Rome, he would not be ſo vnderſtood,
as if a Romane citizen might not remoue his habitation

to any other country: For ſaith he a Romane citizen
may be as long abſent from Rome, and the fields belonging
to Rome, as he pleaſe, ſo that hee ſuffer himſelfe to be ſeſſed
and taxed in common with others toward the ſubſidy paiments,
&amp; denieth to be incorporate into another city. For
T. Pomponius was a true citizen of Rome, though he dwelt
at Athens. The Romane citizens being by theſe priviledges
as by a more proper &amp; peculiar character diſtinguiſhed
from other people; and being planted in the city according
to the appointment of Romulus their king, it ſeemed
good vnto him to divide them intoSigon. de jure Rom. lib. 1. cap. 3. tribes, not taking the
note of diſtinſtion onely from the divers places they then
inhabited, as we read that Servius the ſixth king of Rome
did, making therefore fowre tribes 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        , locall, namely
Suburanam, Palatinam, Collinam, and Eſquilinam (which
number of locall tribes in proceſſe of time encreaſed vnto
the number of 35:) but dividing them according to the ſeverall
natiōs, which at the firſt were donati civitate .i. made
free denizens of Rome: (and they being in number thre. 1.

he made in all three tribes 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                         or nationall. After
that Romulus had thus devided the whole body of the Romanes
into three tribes, he then ſubdivided each tribe into
tenne leſſer numbers, which he called curiae, or pariſhes: &amp;
then followed fiue other diviſions in reſpect of their different
degrees, and callings: of which in their ſeverall order.

ſivè Clientes.
                     
                        
THe firſt diviſion of the Romans in reſpect of their degree,
and place was this. The elder, wealthier, &amp; graveſt
ſort of Romanes, were called ſometimes Patricij,
either becauſe of their age, and gravity; or becauſe they
had many childrē (for great priviledges were granted vnto
fathers of three children:) &amp; ſometimes Patroni, becauſe
they were as patrons, and fathers in helping and aſſiſting
the cauſes of the common people ſeeking to them. The
younger, poorer, and ſimpler ſort were called, as they had
relation to the Patricij, Plebeij .i. the commons; as they had
relation to their Patrons, they were named Clientes .i. Clients.
Betweene whomLazius de Repub. Rom. lib. 12. cap. 3. there was ſuch a mutuall, and reciprocal
entercourſe of loue, and duty, that as their Patrons
were ready to protect their clients, ſo the clients were
bound with all faithfulneſſe to cleaue vnto their Patrons:
and that not only to credit them with their attendance in
publike aſſemblies, but to disburſe out of their owne purſes
towards the beſtowing of their daughters, the paying
of publike mulcts, the giving of largeſſes in ſuing for offices,
&amp;c. Neither was it lawfull for either of thē to enforme,
to depoſe, to giue their voices, or to ſide with adverſaries
one againſt another without the guilt of treaſō: for which
crime of treaſon they were dijs inferis devoti .i. curſed to
hell, and the law gaue liberty for any man to kil them. Out
of the Patricij did Romulus elect 100. counſellers to aſſiſt
him in determining matters concerning the cōmō-weale:
to theſe did Romulus after adde another 100. and Tarquinius
Priſcus, as diverſe authors teſtifie, made them a cōpleat
300. which they called Patres, or Senatores, &amp; their ſonnes
Patricij. But in proceſſe of time the commons alſo were eligible
into a Senators place. Some ſay that Tarquinius
Priſcus added the ſecond hundred to the Senate out of the
commons,Martin. Ph

the number of the Senators: And likewiſeAlex. Gen. dier. l. 2. c. 29.

                     De ſecundâ diviſione Romanorum in tres ordines, Senatorium,
Equeſtrem, Popularem, ſeu Plebeium.
                     AFter that through Tarquinius Superbus his tyranny,
the very name of a king became odious to the Romanes,
not only the preſent king was exiled, but the
authority of a king ever afterward deteſted, and perpetually
abrogated: ſo that the office, which was before monarchicall
then was divided betweene two, called Cōſuls; neither
were they admitted for any longer ſpace then one
yeere. At which time of change, the Romanes were divided
into three orders, or ranges, 1. into Senators, of whom before.
2. into Gentlemen, called of the Romanes ordo Equeſtris:
by which we doe not vnderſtand thoſe 300. Celeres .i.
Penſioners, called ſometimes Equites, for that was a place
of ſervice, this a title and token of gentility. Who although
they were inferiour to the chiefe Senate, yet they were of
greate eſteeme among the Romanes: and although they
might not weare the ſame robe as the Senators did, namely
the laticlavium, or garment beſtudded with flowriſhings
of purple ſilke in manner of broad naile heads;Roſin. Ant. lib. 1 cap. 17. yet they
might weare the anguſti-clavium, a garmēt differing from
the former only in this, becauſe the purple ſtuddes, wherewith
it was purfled was narrower, and not ſo large as the
lati-clavium. They alſo at the time of their election received
from the Cenſors an horſe, called by them equus publicus,
becauſe of the yeerely allowance out of the common
treaſury to keepe him: it was alſo called equus militaris, becauſe
of their ſervice in warre (Lipſius de magnitud. Rom. l. 1. dial. 5. they having their horſes

kept as well in peace, as warre.) They received alſo a gold-ring,
Alexan Genial. dier. li 2. cap. 29. whereby they were diſtinguiſhed from the Populacie:
for it was not lawfull for any to weare a gold-ring vnder
the degree of a Senator, or a Gentleman. The eſtimation
and value of a Senators eſtateSuet. in Auguſt. vntill Auguſtus his time
was octingenta ſestertia, that is, 6000l.Plin. lib. 33. cap. 2. Of a gentlemans
eſtate it was quadringenta ſeſtertia, that is, of our Engliſh
mony 3000l. 3. The third order, or degree in the Romane
common-wealth was Populus, the populacy, or commons,
which ſhould exerciſe trading, manure the ground, looke
vnto the cattell, &amp;c. Where by the way we muſt vnderſtād
that the baſer ſort of the Romanes, which did wander vp &amp;
downe to and fro, not ſetling themſelues to any vocation,
were not contained within this diviſion: for vnto them
there was no name vouchſafed: but according to the Poet
they were ſine nomine turba; or as Livy ſaith, ignota capita,
men of no account, and therefore of no name.

                     De tertiâ diviſione in Nobiles, Novos, &amp; Ignobiles.
                     THis diviſion was taken from the right or priviledge
of having images; for they were accounted Noblemen,
which had the images of their predeceſſors:
Thoſe which had their owne images only were called Novi
.i. late-coyned nobles or vpſtarts. Salust vſeth this word
often in the diſgrace of Tully calling him Novum &amp; reptitium
civem, one that lately crept into the city. The thirde
ſort called ignobiles were thoſe that had no images, neither
of their predeceſſors, nor of thēſelues. Before we proceede,
we muſt vnderſtand, that it was not lawful for who would
to haue his owne image, if he ſo deſired; for none might be
thus priviledged, but thoſe alone to whō the right of riding
in a Curule chaire belonged; &amp; to theſe the right of images
was permitted, as wel for the credit of their houſe, as to incite
others to the like atchieuements, when they would
conſider the diverſe ceremonies vſed vnto theſe images in

an honourable remembrance of thoſe whom they did repreſent.
Whence it followeth, that Ius nobilitatis is nothing
elſe but Ius imaginis; inſomuch that this wordSig

doth oftentimes ſignifie Nobilitie: and the right of having
Images with them, was the ſame as the right of having
arms with vs.Alexan. Genial. dier. lib. 5. cap. 24. The ſuperſtitious cōceit which the Romans
had of theſe images was ſuch, that vpon feſtivall daies &amp;
all occaſions of ioy and mirth, thoſe images ſhould bee
beautified and adorned with garlands and flowers; vpon
occaſions of griefe and mourning they would take from
them all their ornaments, making them in a manner to partake
of their mourning. Some they kept in their private
cloſets,Barthol. Latomus in Verrin. 7. others they expoſed to the publike view of paſſengers,
placing them in the gates of their houſes together
with the ſwords, targets, helmets, ſhip-beakes, and ſuch other
ſpoiles as formerly they had taken from their enimies;
which it was not lawfull for any though they bought the
houſe ſo much as to deface.

                     THis fourth diviſion of the Romans hath beene occaſioned
through the faction &amp; ſiding of the Citizens.
Thoſe (according to the deſcription ofCic pro Sextio. 
                        Tully) were
Optimates .i. the beſt citizens, who deſired their actions
might be liked, and approved by the better ſort. Thoſe Populares.
.i. popular, who through a deſire of vaine-glory,
would not ſo much conſider, what was moſt right, as what
ſhould be moſt pleaſing vnto the populacy. So that here by
this word Popular wee vnderſtand not the commons, as
formerly we did,Geor. Merula in orat. pro. Ligario. but be he Senator, Gentleman, or inferiour,
if he doe more deſire that which ſhall bee applauded
by the maior part, then that which ſhal be approved by the
better part, him the Romanes called Popular .i. ſuch a one,
that preferreth the popular applauſe before the right.

                     De quintâ, &amp; vltimâ diviſione Romanorum, in Libertos, Libertinos,
&amp; Ingenuos: item de Manumiſſione.
                     THe difference of freedomes in the citie of Rome hath
given occaſion of this diviſion: For he, or ſhe that had
ſerved as an apprentice, and afterward was manumized,
was named Libertus, or Liberta. The ſonne whoſe father,
&amp; mother were once apprentices, was called Libertinus:
but that ſonne whoſe father and mother were both libertines,
or both free-borne,Iuſtin. inſt. lib 1. tit. de Ingenuis. vid. Franc. Sylviū in Catilinariam. 4. yea whoſe mother onely was
free, was called Ingenuus .i. free-borne. But after Appius
Coecus his Cenſor-ſhip, then began Liberti, &amp; Libertini to
ſignifie one, and the ſame degree of freedome: ſo that Liberti,
and Libertini were taken for thoſe which ſerved for
their freedome, and Ingenui were taken for thoſe which
were free-borne, whether their parents were Liberti, or
Libertini. Here is occaſion given vs to conſider the maner
of their freedome, and ſuch ceremonies which belonged
therevnto. The freedome of the city of Rome was three
waies obtained: Firſt by birth, both or at leaſt one of the
parents being free, and ſuch were called cives originarij.
Secondly by gift, or cooptation, when the freedome was
beſtowed vpon any ſtranger, or nation, and they were termed
civitate donati: and ſo wee read that Caeſar did take in
whole nations into the freedome. Laſtly by manumiſſion,
which was thus; when as the ſervant was preſented
by his maſter before the Conſull, or Praetor, the maſter laying
his hand vpon the ſervants head, vſed this forme of
words, Hunc liberum eſſe volo, and with that turning his
ſervant round, and giving him a cuffe on the eare, hee did
emittere ſervum è manu: The Praetor then laying a certaine
rodde or wand calledP. Ramus i

                           ctor or Seriant taking the wand did therewith
ſtrike the ſervant on the head, and with his hand bee

ſtroke him on the face, and gaue him a puſh in the backe,
and after this hee was regiſtred for a free-man. Moreover
the ſervant hauing his head ſhaven purpoſely at that time
receaued a cap, as a token of libertie: whence ad pileum vocare
aliquem, is, to ſet one at libertie, as likewiſe vindictâ
liberare. Here we may alſo conſider the two ſeverall kinds
of ſervants: the firſt were called ſervi, and they could never
attaine to any freedome without the conſent of their
Maſter:Dion Halicarn. lib 4. for thoſe that were thus ſervi were commonly
captiues, either beſtowed as a reward vpon this, or that
ſouldier, or bought ſub coronâ, or of other citizens, which
had gotten them one of thoſe two former waies. The ſecond
were called properlySigon. de iudiciis l. 1. cap. 31. 
                        nexi &amp; addicti, becauſe though
they were free, yet by reaſon of their debt, addicebantur,
that is, they were delivered vp vnto their creditors by the
Praetor to worke out the debt, ſo that after the payment
thereof either by mony or worke, they did recover their
libertie: whence they were ſaidMichael Toxita in orat. pro P. Quintio.

when they ſued for the payment were ſaid nomina exigere:

                        THough Satan had much blinded
the hearts of men in old time, yet
was not the darkneſſe of their vnderſtanding
ſo great, but that they
did eaſily perceiue, and therefore
willingly acknowledge, that there
was ſome ſupreame governour,
ſome firſt mover, as Ariſtot. ſaith:
ſome firſt original of all goodneſſe,
as Plato teacheth. So that if any made this queſtion, whether
there was a God, or no? he ſhould be vrged to confeſſe
the truth of that rather argumento bacillino, quàm Ariſtotelico,
rather with a good cudgell, then with any long
diſpute. But as they were moſt certaine, that there was a
God, ſo were they againe very blinde in diſcerning the
true God: and hence hath bin invented ſuch a tedious catalogue
of Gods, that as Varro averreth, their number hath
exceeded thirty thouſand, and proved almoſt numberleſſe.
Wherefore I ſhall omit to make any diſtinct treatiſe of the
Gods, intending obiter, and by the way to ſpeake of them,
which either had prieſts, or ſacrifices inſtituted for them.
Only I purpoſe to ſhew what is vnderſtood by thoſe generall
diſtinctions of the Gods, which diverſe authors haue
vſed. Tully lib. 2. de legibus reduceth all vnto three heads,

Gods celeſtial, which Varro calleth ſelect, and others haue
ſtyled Gods maiorum gentium .i. of the greater nations, becauſe
their power was greater then the others.Alex. Genial. dier. lib. 6. cap. 6. 
                        Alexander
Neapolitanus ſaith, that twelue of theſe were the Penates,
which Aeneas did take forth with him at the deſtruction
of Troy. Ovid calleth them Deos nobiles, noble Gods:
others call thē 
                        Deos conſentes, quaſi conſentientes, becauſe
Iupiter would do nothing without the conſent of all. Ennius
hath delivered them in this diſtich,

                           Iuno, Veſta, Minerva, Ceres, Diana, Venus, Mars,
                           Mercurius, Iovis, Neptunus, Vulcanus, Apollo.
                        
The ſecond ſort of Gods were called Semidei .i. Demigods:
Servius. in lib. Georgic. alſo Indigites .i. Gods adopted, or canonized; men deified.
For as the ſelect Gods had poſſeſſion of heaven by their
owne right; ſo theſe Gods canonized had it no otherwiſe
then by right of donation, being therefore tranſlated into
heaven, becauſe they lived as Gods vpō earth: but becauſe
their merit was inferior, and could not parallel the deſerts
of the Gods ſelect, therefore were they called Gods of inferior
note.In Aeneid. lib. 5. 
                        Servius would haue theſe called Divi; obſerving
this difference betweene Dij &amp; Divi, that Dij ſhould
ſignifie thoſe which had bin Gods perpetually, but Divi
ſhould ſignifie men made Gods, though commonly they
are vſed one for another. Whence they called all their Emperours
Divi, becauſe for their deſerts they thought them
worthy to be Gods. Now theRoſin antiq. l. 3. c. 18. manner how a man became
deified was this: The party to be canonized being dead, a
pile of wood was made in forme of a great tent, or tabernacle,
with three other leſſer tabernacles one vpon top of another,
the lower-moſt having in it dry combuſtible matter,
but in the out-ſide adorned richly with gold, Ivory, &amp;
painted tables: vpon the top of which was placed an eagle
made of ſome light matter, as paper, or thin wood. Hither
the dead corps was to be caryed with great ſolemnities;
the Senate, the gentlemen, and al the chiefe magiſtrats going
before, with hymnes and ſongs, and al kinde of honor,

which was to be performed even to the Gods themſelues.
He being in this manner brought, and laide within the ſecond
tabernacle, the fire was kindled, by reaſon of the
ſmoake and vapor whereof the Eagle was carryed vp into
the aire, and, as the Romanes thought, it did tranſport the
ſoule of the dead body into heaven, in ſo much that ever after
he was canonized amongſt the Gods, and worſhipped
as a God. And becauſe they were thus turned into Gods,
ſome haue called them Deos animales,
                        Serv. in Ae
                              •
                            lib. 3. 
                        quoniam animae humanae
verterentur in Deos. The third ſort were thoſe morall
vertues, by which as by a ladder men clymed into heaven:
and therefore did men ſtile them Gods, becauſe by their
meanes men became deified. Late writers perceiving that
all the number of the Gods could not bee reduced vnto
theſe three heads, haue added a fourth ſort, which they
Roſin. antiq. lib. 2. c. 19. call Semones, quaſi ſemi-homines, becauſe ancient writers,
as Roſinus hath obſerued, called men hemones, not homines.
In which point I ſhall willingly condeſcend vnto him; but
I ſhall leaue to the iudgement of others, to determin how
iuſtly he hath reſtrained the Gods minorum gentium of the
leſſer nations, only vnto this laſt claſſis: whereas my opinion
is, that the demigods, the morall vertues which haue
beene ſtiled Gods, and theſe Semones, may all of them bee
called Gods of the leſſer nations, ſtanding in oppoſition
with the Gods ſelect, which are called Gods of the greater
nations. But that we may vnderſtand what is meant by
theſe Semones, we muſt remember, that by them are ſignified
vnto vs not thoſe Gods, which doe appertaine to man
himſelfe, but to the neceſſaries of mans living, his victuals,
his cloathing, and the like: not to the being of a man, but
to the well being of him, of which ſort is Salus, Fortuna,
with others. We read likewiſe of other names given in cō
                        mon
to diverſe Gods, not as oppoſite members of a diviſion,
but as notes of diſtinction drawne from the diverſity
of helpe, which they ſeverally did afford vnto man. In this
eſpect ſome were called dij Patrij, or tutelares, ſuch as had

vndertaken the protection of any citie, or towne: which
opinion hath ſometimes beene entertained by our Engliſh-men,
and thence haue riſen theſe, and the like ſpeeches
S. George for England, S. Denys for France, S. Patricke
for Ireland, &amp;c. And the Romans being fully perſwaded of
the truth thereof, whenſoever they went about to beſeege
any towne, by certaine enchantments, or ſpels they would
firſt call out theſe Tutelar Gods; becauſe they deemed it a
matter impoſſible to captivate the citie, as long as theſe
Gods were within; or at leaſt they thought it a crime vnexpiable
to take the Gods as priſoners. And leaſt other nations
might vſe the ſame meanes in beſeeging Rome, therfore,
Sylvius in epiſt. virotū illuctrium. as diverſe authors haue thought, the true name of
the Romane citie was never knowne, leaſt thereby the
name of their Tutelar God might bee deſcryed. Others
namely the Tyrians haue tied faſt their God Hercules with
a golden chaine, thereby the more to ſecure themſelues of
his reſidence among them.Alex. Gen. dier. l. 6. c. 4. Others haue beene called Dij
communes, namely Mars, Bellona, and Victoria, becauſe
in time of war they are not bound to either ſide: but ſometimes
they helpe one ſide, and ſometimes the other. And as
they ſuppoſed ſome Gods to haue the protection of whole
countries, ſo did they beleeue that others had the charge
of particular men; and that ſo ſoone as any man was borne
two ſpirits did preſently accōpany him inviſibly, the one
tearmed the bonus Genius, or good angell, perſwading him
to that which ſhould be good: the other called the malus
Genius, or evill angell, tempting him to that which ſhould
be hurtfull: inſomuch that they thought all the actions of
man to be guided by theſe angels called Genij, ſo that if any
misfortune befell a man, they would ſay that the matter
was enterpriſed Dijs iratis .i. our Genius being diſpleaſed
with vs. Virgil calleth theſe bad Angels Manes, as it
appeareth by that, Quiſ

                            ſuos patimur manes,
.i. Every man hath his evil Angell .i. ſome misfortune. They
are therefore called Genij, becauſe they haue tuition of vs

ſo ſoone, as we are Geniti .i. borne, although every place
had alſo his genius, as hereafter ſhall appeare. This opinion
was the more confirmed by a viſion which appeared vnto
Plutarch. in Bruto. 
                        Brutus in Aſia neere vnto the time of his death: for Brutus,
watching vpon a certaine night in his pavillion, the
candle being nere ſpent, ſaw a fierce tragical perſon appeare
vnto him, ſomewhat bigger then a man, and hee preſently
being of an vndaunted ſpirit, demanded whether
he were a God, or a man? To whom the viſion anſwered,
Brutus, I am thy evill Genius, which haunteth thee, thou
ſhalt ſee me at the citie Philippi againe. And the ſame viſion
appeared vnto him, as he was fighting at Philippi: which
was the laſt fight that ever he fought. And becauſe that Iuno
was wont to be invocated in time of child-birth, therefore
many haue thought that every man hath not his two
angels, but one angell, and Iuno to obſerue him. This Genius,
as often as he is vnderſtood for the good or evil angel
which hath charge of a mans body, is painted in forme
of a man, as we read he did appeare to Brutus; though ſome
time he is painted as a young boy, ſometime as an old decrepite

which therefore was called genialis arbor. In the right
hand he held a platter over an altar garniſhed with flowers.
In the left he held a ſcourge hanging downe. The ſacrifice
that was performed vnto the Genius was wine, and
flowers: wherevpon (as if by wine, and fragrant odors were
ſignified all kind of pleaſures) certaine proverbial ſpeeches
haue beene occaſioned: as when we ſee a man giuen much
to his pleaſure, and daintie feeding, we ſay hee doth indulgere
Genio .i. pamper or make much of his Genius: on the
contrary he that is abſtemious, &amp; debarreth himſelfe of his
pleaſure is ſaid defraudare Genium, to defraud his Genius: &amp;

cuſtome after meals to haue a cuppe paſſe round the table,

                            genij. But the reaſon, why they would not ſacrifice

vnto their Genius by killing ſome hoſt, as they did
to their other Gods, was, becauſe they iudged it vnfit to
depriue any creature of his life vpon that day, when they
firſt begā their life. (For this ſacrifice was performed yearly
by every one vpon his birth day.) The other Genius,
which is ſuppoſed to haue chiefe power over high waies,
and places, being therefore called Genius loci, was pictured
in the forme of a ſnake, in which forme Virgil faineth
him to haue appeared to Aeneas, when hee performed the
funerall rites due vnto his father Anchiſes, Aenead. lib. 5.

Another ſort of Gods was ſuppoſed to haue the keeping
of mens houſes:Franc. Sylvius in orat. pro Sext. Roſcio Amer. which they painted in forme of a dogge:
becauſe thoſe to whom the charge of houſes is committed
ought to reſemble dogges, that is, to ſeeme fierce, and angry
towards ſtrangers, but gentle, and kind to thoſe of the
houſhold. They were named Lares, and becauſe of the
charge, they had over mens houſes, this word Lar is ſundry
times taken for an houſe it ſelfe, as parvo ſub Lare, Horat:
in a little cottage, Homo incerti Laris .i. a man that hath
no houſe to dwell in. Sen. in Med. And the cuſtome in ſacrificing
vnto them, was to eate vp all whatſoever was left
of the offering. For they thought it an heynous matter to
ſend any part of that ſacrifice abroad either among their
friends, or the poore: and therevpon when we ſee a glutton
leaue nothing in the platter, not ſomuch as the curteſymorſell,
we ſay, Lari ſacrificat .i. he ſacrificeth to his houſhold
God.

religion into Italy. He conſecrated groues,
gaue names vnto cities, erected temples,
ordeined ſacrifices, &amp;c. from whō the churches,
as ſome ſay, were named Fana. But after
Faunus, Euander comming out of Arcadia, and afterward
being king of Latium, he inſtituted, and appointed
many other ceremonies, which before were vnknowne to
the Latins. After him Aeneas comming from Troy, taught
many of the Troian ceremonies: by whoſe examples Romulus,
and Numa were incited to adde many other kindes of
holy rites, and at length reduced their whole religion into
a certaine order. My intent therefore is, to ſpeake firſt of
the God, in whoſe honor theſe holy rites were performed,
and then to deſcend vnto the prieſts, which were to performe
them, ſhewing withall the ceremonies they vſed in
the performance.

he tooke the name Inuus, or as ſome ſay Iunus. Concerning
the time, whē theſe ſacrifices were to be performed; it was
vpon thePlutarch. in Romulo. vnfortunate daies of the month February, which
hath his name à februando, from purging: whence the feaſt
or game is as a purification; though the Latin word ſignifieth
as much as a feaſt of wolues, in a memoriall that Romulus,
and Remus were nurſed by a ſhee-woulfe. This ſeemeth
very probable, becauſe the Prieſts, which were called
Luperci began their courſe at the foote of the mount Palatine,
called by the Romanes Lupercal .i. the place, where the
woulfe nurſedPlutarch. in Romulo. 
                        Romulus. The ceremonies were theſe: The
hoaſt (being two goates) was to be ſlaine; and two noble
mens ſonnes were to bee preſent, whoſe foreheads being
blouded with the kniues of them that had ſlaine the goats,
by &amp; by were to be dryed vp with wooll dipped in milke.
Then the young boyes muſt laugh immediately after their
foreheads were dry. That done they cut the goats skins, &amp;
made thongs of them, which they tooke in their hands, &amp;
ran with them all about the city ſtark-naked (ſaving they
had a cloath before their privities) and ſo they ſtrook with
thoſe thongs all they met in the way. The young wiues did
never ſhun them at all, but were well contented, to be ſtrikē
with them; beleeving it helped them to be with childe,
and alſo to be eaſily delivered. Moreover it is to be noted,
that a dogge was ſacrificed at this time, becauſe there is a
naturall antipathy, or contrariety of nature, betweene the
dogge and the woulfe: whereby Romulus thought to teſtifie
his gratefulneſſe vnto the woulfe for her paines in nouriſhing
him. The reaſon why the prieſts ranne vp &amp; downe
the ſtreetes naked, was, becauſe that Pan the God of this

ſacrifice was painted naked. As the feaſt, ſo alſo the place
from whence they came, and likewiſe the Prieſts had their
names à Lupâ which ſignifieth a woulfe. Some authors
haue obſerved three ſorts of the Luperci, ſome called Fabiani,
ſome Quinctiliani, from Fabius, and Quinctilius their
governours the third ſort, whichRoſin. antiq. lib. 3. c. 2.

of the day, and the Prieſts, which were only women
ran vp and downe with lamps in their hands in manner of
mad women; into whoſe temple none that was guilty of any
fault committed might enter: whoſe myſteries were to
be buryed in ſilence, and by no meanes to bee blabbed abroad.
And as it is to be ſuppoſed, that was the reaſon why
all wine was forbade in this ſacrifice. So that hencePlautus in Aulularia. we ſay

heards-mens complaint brought vnto Evander of
him, whom they accuſed to haue ſlaine their chiefe heardsman
Cacus, the hiſtory beingServ. Aen. lib. 8. thus. Hercules after his cō
                        queſt
over Geryon brought away with him certaine goodly
Oxen, and as well to reſt himſelfe, as to paſture his oxen,
he laid him downe to ſleepe in a greene field neere the river
Tiber. In the meane while a certaine heards-man called
Cacus happened to come that way, &amp; perceiving Hercules
to be in a ſound ſleepe, he ſtole away two of his oxen,
which he hid in a caue, or hollow rocke, pulling them in by
the taile back ward, thinking that Hercules whē he ſhould
looke his oxen, and ſee the print of the footſteps, would
eaſily beleeue, that his oxen had rather gone out from that
rocke, then into it, as indeed he did for a time beleeue: but
afterward by the bellowing of the oxen within, anſwering
their fellowes without, Hercules entred the rocke, &amp; finding
the theefe Cacus there with his oxen, he killed him,
by reaſon of which murder he was brought before Evander,
and after a while knowne to be the Hercules, of whō
the propheteſſe Carmenta had foretold vnto Evander, that
he ſhould be a God. Wherevpon Evander preſently ſaluted

him by the name of Hercules the ſonne of Iupiter, and
in honour of him cauſed an altar to bee built there in that
place: vpon which yeerely was to be offered vp an heifer
which had never borne yoke; and that this ſacrifice might
be had in the more eſteeme, two noble men well ſtroken
in yeares, and of good repute among the Romanes, one of
them being called Potitius, and the other Pinarius were appointed
as the Prieſts to performe theſe ſacrifices; from
whom ever after Hercules his Prieſts were called Potitij,

was not the ſur-name of this old noble-man, but a
name added vnto him, intimating his, and his ſucceſſours

Curates called Curiones, or Flamines curiales; which were

Neither was every one equally capable of this honour of

in what region the birds did appeare: Then killing
his ſacrifice, and offering vp certaine prayers called Effata,
he proceeded in manner as followeth. But firſt ſuppoſe we
for our better vnderſtanding hereof, that now the Augurs
were to reſolue the people, whether the Gods would aſſent
that Numa Pompilius ſhould be King. The Augur having
done as aboue is ſhewne, his Lituus being in his left
hand, he reached forth his right hand putting it vpō

to bee king of Rome, ſhew ſome manifeſt tokens within
theſe regions, or quarters, which I haue deſcribed. Then if
he obſerved lucky ſignes, and tokens, he preſently pronoū
                        ced
Numa Pompilius king of Rome: if he perceived vnlucky
tokens, then did he obnunciare, or gaine ſay, and ſhew that
the matter propoſed was not pleaſing to the Gods. Where
by the way we muſt note, that nothing was confirmed by
the Augurs without the appearance of two lucky tokens
one after another; neither was any thing gaineſaid by the
appearance of one only evill token. The diſtinctions of the
ſoothſayings haue beene taken, ſome from the event, and

thence are they called proſpera, lucky, or adverſa, vnlucky.

the Augurs would pronounce either good fortune, or bad

thereby Dei ira nobis innoteſcit, the Gods anger is
made knowne vnto vs. Now the things that in divining
time appeared on the left-hand were commonly tokens of

THis kinde of coniecting is called auſpicium coactum,

                        quoniam neceſſe erat offâ cadere fruſtum ex
pulli ore, cùm paſcitur, The word Tripudiumn is vſed
by a ſyncopation for terripudium, which is as much as terripavium
.i. a dancing or rebounding of any thing vpon the
ground: for pauere is the ſame with ferire.
                        Hubert. in lib. 6. Ep fam. Cic. Others ſay Tripudium quaſi tritio pedum It is here taken for a divining, or
coniecting of good or evill to come by the rebounding of
crums caſt to chickē in a coop or pen: whence the Augur
from theſe pullets or chicken was called Pullarius.
                        Alex. Gen. dier. l. 1. c. 29. The
manner in obſerving was this. As often as by this kinde of
conjecting they deſired to know the Gods pleaſure concerning
the enterprizing of any matter, early in the morning
thoſe that were skilfull in this kinde of obſervation,
repaired vnto the place where the chickē were kept, where
ſilence being commanded, and the coop opened they caſt
crumms of bread to the chicken. Now if the chicken either
came ſlowly, or not at all vnto the bread, or if they walked
vp and downe by it not touching it, then was it a token
that the matter to be enterprized was diſpleaſing vnto the
gods: but if contrarily the chicken did haſtily leape out of
the coop &amp; eat ſo greedily of the crums, that ſome ſhould
fall out of their mouthes againe, then the pullarius, that is,
the, Augur pronoūced that it was wel pleaſing to the Gods,
and encouraged the enterprizing of what they had intended
cheerefully: and this was called Tripudium ſoliſtimum.
This kinde of coniecting may ſeeme to haue its originall
from the Lycians,
                        Alex. ib. who as often as they deſired to foreknow
the ſucceſſe of any enterpriſe, they went vnto a foū
                        taine
dedicated to Apollo, into which they caſt in baites
for the fiſh: now if the fiſhes did eate them, it did betide
good lucke; if otherwiſe they neglected the baites, then it
did be token ſome, evill event.

THis kinde of ſooth ſaiers as they were called Aruſpices
ab aras aſpiciendo, from beholding the hoaſt vpon the
altar; ſo were they called Extiſpices, ab exta aspiciēdo, from
beholding the bowels, or entrals of the beaſt, called in Latine
Extra. In this kinde of ſooth ſaying the Aruſpex obſerved
in manner as followeth.Senec O

ſacrificed came vnto the altar willingly, without plucking,
and halling; whether he dyed without much ſtruggling, or
lowd bellowing; at one blow, or many; whether any vnlucky
obiect were ſeene, or heard by thē, whiles they were
ſacrificing. Againe after the beaſt was ſlaine, then would
they obſerue, whether the bowels were of an vnnatural color,
whether they were not vlcerous, exſiccate, or impoſtumated:
moreover they would divide the bowels into two
parts, the one they would call partem familiarem, from
whence they would fore-tell what ſhould befall thēſelues,
&amp; their friends; the other they would call partem hoſtilem,
whēce they gathered predictions touching their enemies.
Hence Manto inOedip. Act. 2. ſcen. 2. 
                        Seneca deſcribing the entrals of his killed
ſacrifice ſaith, Hoſtile valido robore inſurgit latus, meaning
by hoſtile latus, partem hoſtilem. Afterward when the
ſacrifice was, to be burned, they conſidered, whether the
flame of the fire was ſmoaky, whether the ſmoake rolled,
and tumbled in the aire, whether it were of any continuance
or no: for all theſe were vnfortunate tokens, as the
contrary did betoken a good and fortunate iſſue to their
deſignements. Theſe laſt which obſerved the fire &amp; ſmoak
were called by a more peculiar name Capnomantes ſmoakaugurers,

holy rites of religion, as civill buſineſſe▪ But Numa Pompilius
perecauing that forraine warres did often times occasion
the kings abſence, inſomuch that thoſe religious
ceremonies which he himſelſe perſonally ſhould performe
were of neceſſitie ſometimes neglected; herevpō he ordained
out of the Patricij three prieſts to performe that divine
ſervice vnto Iupiter, Mars, and Romulus, which hee
himſelfe otherwiſe ought to haue performed, calling the
firſt Flamen Dialis, the other Flamen Martialis, &amp; the laſt
Flamen Quirinalis, from Romulus, which was often called
Quirinus. In proceſſe of time twelue others choſen from
the commons were added vnto theſe, but with this note of
diſtinctiō, that the three firſt were had in greater eſteem. &amp;
were called Flamines maiores, high prieſts; the other of leſſe
note called Flamines minores, inferior prieſts. The chiefe of
al was the Flamē Dialis Iupiters high prieſt, &amp; wheras every
one did weare a certain b̄onet in forme of a mitre, which
ſometimes was called Pileum, ſometime by the figure, ſynecdoche
Apex, (wheras Apex doth properly ſignifie only
the top of the bonnet)Alex. Gen. dier. l. 6. c. 12. none might weare Albo-galerum,
.i. a white mitre, but only Iupiters prieſt, and that was to
be made of a white ſheep skin, after the ſheep had been ſacrificed.

Whatſoever malefactor could eſcape vnto this
Prieſt, he ſhould not be puniſhed that day. None was eligible into this office, but he that was maried: neither was
it lawfull for him to mary twice, but if his wiſe died, Flaminio
abibat .i. hee reſigned his ſacerdotall office. To him
was permitted a rich robe of ſtate, &amp; a curule-chaire: none
might fetch fire out of his houſe, vnleſſe it were to perform
ſome ſacrifice therewith.Servius Aen. lib. 1. None might barbe or pole him,
but a free-man: and that with a braſen ſciſſers. Many other

their Flamines.

wiues were called Flaminicae; Their miniſters (for they were
wont, whē they went to ſacrifice to take a boy or a maide
with thē) Flaminij, or Flamineae: And the Chiefe-flamens.
dwelling houſe was called aedes Flaminea, or Flaminia. But
as it ſeemeth probable Numa Pompilius, and ſo the other
kings ſucceeding him did ſtill reſerue their right &amp; authority
in holy matters ſo farre, that they would inſtruct other
inferior prieſts, yea &amp; perſonally performe ſome ſpecial ſacrifices
thēſelues: where vpō after that the kings authority
was abrogated amongſt thē, thē that theſe ſacrifices might
be continued, they choſe a certaine Prieſt, which they preferred
before the Flamen Dialis, but iudged him inferiour
to the Pontifex maximus, or Arch-Pontifie, and him they
called, Rex ſacrificulus, and Rex ſacrorum, the King prieſt.
To him once every yeare the Veſtall Nunnes repaired,Serv. Aeneid. 10. and

and to provide al things ncceſſarie for publike ſacrifices.
He was to inſtruct thoſe that ſought vnto him, the
cauſes of the holy daies, and to tell them what was lawfull
or vnlawfull every month, and vpon the fifth of the Ies dof

Ianuarie he ſacrificed a Ramme to Ianus. He was likewiſe
wont to offer vp a ſacrifice in the comitium or great hal of
iuſtice, which being finished, he ranne as faſt as hee could
out of the market place without delay. His wife was called
Rigina ſacrorum, the Queene-prieſteſſe, and was wont vpon
the Kalends of every month to ſacrifice a porker or a
lambe in her palace in the honour of Iuno.

remoue it: at that time a certaine braſen target, or ſcutc

nation did offer iniury vnto the Romane people, thē
did theſe Foeciales go as Embaſſadours vnto them perſwading,
and exhorting them to yeeld the Romans their right:
but if they continued thirty daies obſtinate refuſing to
yeeld vnto that, which ſhould be iuſt and right, then did
they preſently denounce warre againſt them, caſting forth
a dart in token thereof: which denunciation.wasServ. Aenci. lib. 10. called

opinion that whenſoever warre was denounced, this Herald

had done ought againſt his oath, theſe Foeciales by their
ſacrifice did avert the wrath of the Gods from him. The
chiefeſt of them was called Pater-patratus, a perfect father:

faciundis: itèm de Sibyllis.
                     THis prieſthood had his firſt inſtitution from Tarquinius
Superbus, whoſe office was as well to expound,
as to keepe the oracles of thoſe ten propheteſſes ſo
famous through out the world, called Sibyllae. Concerning
whō
                        Munſter in ſua coſmog. lib. 2. 
                        Munſter hath theſe words: In times paſt there came
a ſtrange woman to Tarquinius the king offering 9. books
full of the Sibylline oracles to be fold: But Tarquinius thinking
the bookes to deere, refuſed to buy them. The womā
departing burned three of theſe bookes, and came the ſecond
time vnto Tarquinius, demaunding as much for thoſe
ſixe bookes, as formerly ſhee had done for the 9. Tarquinius
then began to deride her, whereat the woman departed,
and burned three more, returning againe vnto Tarquinius,
and asking as much for the three left, as ſhee asked at firſt
for all nine. Then began Tarquinius more ſeriouſly to bethinke
himſelfe thereof, and ſent for his Augurs asking
counſell and adviſe of them. And they vnderſtoode by certaine
ſignes obſerved, that the king had refuſed ſome ſpeciall
goodneſſe ſent from the Gods: and for the books that
remained they adviſed that the woman ſhoulde haue what
ſhee asked: As ſoone as the womā had delivered her books
ſhee preſently vaniſhed, and was never ſeene againe, onlie
warning them to keepe the bookes as ſafe as poſſibly they
could. For the ſafe keeping of theſe, Tarquinius choſe two
of the noble men, or patricij, calling them Duumviri, appointing
them as wel by ſtudy to expound, as with care to
keepe thoſe oracles. In proceſſe of time the people obtained,

that tenne ſhould be appointed to this office,Feneſtel. de ſacerd. c. 13. fiue of
them being choſen out of the commons, &amp; fiue out of the
nobles: and then were they called the Decem-viri. Afterward
by L. Sylla, as it is thought fiue more were added, ſo
that they were then called the Quindecim-viri: nay the
number was encreaſed by Sylla vnto forty,Serv. Aenei. lib. 6. as Servius
thinketh, but ſtil called by the name of Quindecim-viri. Of
theſe women that had the ſpirit of prophecie ten were very
famous: the firſt was called Perſica, the ſecond Libyca,
the third Delphica, the fourth Cumaea, the fifth Erythraea,
the ſixt Samia, the ſeaventh Cumana, the eighth Helleſpontia,
the ninth Phrygia, the tenth Tiburtina. They a
                           •
                         prophecied
of the incarnation of Chriſt. The place where theſe
bookes were kept was within the Capitol vnder ground in
a cheſt of ſtone, where they remained ſafe vntill the burning
of the Capitoll, at which time they alſo were burned.
Notwithſtāding many of the prophecies haue bin known,
partly by tradition, and partly being takē out of other copies
in other countries. One of the prophecies concerning
our Saviour Chriſt was vttered by Sibylla Delphica in manner
as followeth:Munſter. in ſua Coſmog. lib. 2.

any copulation of the mother, even out of her wombe. It
was ſpoken at Delphos. All their prophecies, were of that
certainety, that when we would averre any thing to be vndoubtedly
true,Credite me vobis folium recitare Sibyllae. we vſe to ſay it is Sibyllae folium, as true as
Sibyllaes oracles. The Cumaea Sibylla did write her oracles
at the mouth, or entraunce of her caue in leaues of trees,
which the fierceneſſe of the winde did often times ſo ſcatter,
that they could hardly be brought in order againe: inſomuch
that when we would ſhew the great difficulty of
bringing things it order, we may vſeEpiſt. lib. 1. epiſt. 1.

Veſtall Nunnes. This good goddeſſe was ſuppoſed to bee
the wife of Faunus, and vpon a time to haue beene taken
drunke with wine by him, for which fault Faunus is ſaid to
haue beaten her to death with roddes of mirtle tree. But
afterward being ſory for that he had done, in amends hee
made her a goddeſſe: and as it were ever after deteſting the
mirtle-tree, he allowing all other hearbs, and flowers to
be vſed in theſe ſacrifices, for bad the mirtle-tree. Some ſay
ſhe was ſo chaſt, that ſhee never was ſeene by any man but
her husband, and in reſpect of his chaſtitie the mirtle-tree
is forbid, becauſe it was conſecrated to 
                           Ʋenus. But whereas
in this ſacrifice they vſed wine, they called it not by the

name of wine, but milke or hony:Alex. Gen. dier. l. 6. c. 8. whence they called the
veſſell wherein the wine was put, amphoram mellariam .i.
the hony veſſell. This ſacrifice became very famous by reaſō
of Clodius, who being in loue with Pompeia, Iulius Caeſars
wife came vnto theſe ſacrifices in womans apparell, &amp;
was found out by Aurelia, Iulius Caeſars mother. This
Clodius became ſo infamous for this, and other his adulterous
prancks, that hee occaſioned a common proverbe amongſt
the Romans, Clodius accuſat moechos, anſwerable to
which our Engliſh ſaying is, One theefe accuſeth another.

him turned him into a pine-tree. In remembrance of him,
ever after her Prieſts were gelded. Every yeare the Praetors
did ſacrifice vnto this goddeſſe. But the performance of
the holy and religious tites at that time did belong vnto a
Phrygian man, and Phrygian woman choſen for that purpoſe:
which according to the manner of their country being
apparelled with a party coloured garment called in
Latine Syntheſis, or amictus variegatus, and carying the
picture of their goddeſſe about with them in the ſtreetes,
they ſtroke their breaſts with their handes, keeping tune
with the tabers, pipes, and cymbals, which other people
following plaied vpon: and they were called Corybantes
from one Corybantus, which was one of her firſt attēdants.
And herevpon we call the cymbals aera corybantia. In this
manner dancing about the ſtreets they begged mony
of the people whom they met: and hence were they named

THis word Pontifex is commonly tranſlated a Biſhop
or Prelate, being called Pontifices in Latine, as alſo Pō
                        tifies
in Engliſh from one part of their office, which was
to haue the overſight of a great woodden bridge called in
Latine Pont ſublicius, being ſo great, that carts and waines
might paſſe over it; having no arches to vphold it, but only
great piles, and poſts of wood:Plutarch. in Numa. and that which is moſt remarkable
in it, was that it was 
                           •
                        oined together only, with
wooden pinnes, without any iron at all. Others are of opinion
that they were tearmed Pontifices quaſi potifices from
potis, and facio, of which opinion Lucane ſeemeth to bee,
according to that, Pontifices ſacri quibus eſt commiſſa poteſtas.
Concerning theFeneſt de ſacerd. number of them only foure were
appointed by Numa, all which then were to bee choſē out
of the Patricii: afterward foure more were added out of
the commons. Theſe were called Pontifices maiores, or
chiefe Pontifies, to diſtinguiſh them from ſeaven other,
which afterward Sylla added, andRoſin. antiq. lib. 3. c. 22. called them Pontifices
minores, inferiour Pontifies. The whole company of them
was called the college of Pontifies. This college is priviledged
from all allegiance, being not bound to render
an account of their doings either to the Senate, or Commonaltie.
They were to determine all queſtions concerning
religion, as well betweene their prieſts, as betweene
private men. They had authoritie to puniſh any inferiour
Prieſt, if he either detracted or added vnto thoſe religious
rites, which were preſcribed him. They had their great Pō
                        tifie,
whom they called Pontificem maximum. Theſe Pontifies
were wont to exceed in their diet, inſomuch that
when the Romanes would ſhew the greatneſſe of a feaſt,
they would ſay it was Pontificia coena, .i. according to our
engliſh phraſe a feaſt for an Abbot. Coena adijcialis is taken
for the ſame.

at the firſt were fowre, after 6. Virgins, or votaries
elected, whoſe office was chiefly to keepe the ſacred fire:
the extinction whereof proved ominous, and did portende
ſome evill event ſhortly to happen: And therefore for their
negligence herein, as for all other ſmall faults, they being
had into a darke corner, ſtripped naked; and a curtaine
drawne halfe way over them, the chiefe Pontifie ſcourged
them: neither was it lawful to kindle the fire once put
out, with any other fire, but from the ſun beams; for which
purpoſe they had certaine inſtruments namedPlutarch. in Numa.

which were formed in the māner of a pyramis, but hollow;
ſo that the beames being collected within the circumference,
&amp; meeting in the vertex did eaſily kindle any combuſtible
matter put vnto it; but chiefly if the matter was of
blacke colour: becauſe, as philoſophy teacheth, a darke colour
doth cōgregate, or collect the beames, wheras whiteneſſe
doth diſperſe them. A ſecond part of their office was

vpon an altar it had the name of a ſacrifice: and

Gods favour, or after warre in token of thankfulneſſe, they
did hoſtiam ferire .i. offer vp the ſacrifice. The ſecond difference
of ſacrifices haue beene occaſioned in reſpect of the
time, and ſo they haue beene called Praecidaneae, or ſuccidaneae,
quaſi praecedaneae &amp; ſuccedaneae. Thoſe ſacrifices which
were offered vp the day before any ſolemne ſacrifice,
were called Praecidaneae hoſtiae, fore-ſacrifices, as wee engliſh
praecurſorem, a forerunner: which fore-ſacrifices if by
any token they found vnlucky, then would they offer vp a
ſecond ſacrifice which they tearmed hoſtiam ſuccidaneam:
And becauſe theſe ſecond ſacrifices were to be offered only
in ſteed of the other, when they were vnlucky or faulty;
hence hath Plautus vſed this ſpeech Meum tergum ſtultitiae

The manner of ſacrificing was as followeth. Some certaine
daies before any ſacrifice was to be performed, the prieſt
was wont to waſh his whole body,Vid. Eraſ

feet, which if he had not waſhed, the ſacrifice was accounted
polluted: and alluding vnto this cuſtome we ſay a man
doth Acoedere ad rem illotis manibus, or illotis pedibus, as
often as he enterpriſeth any buſineſſe without due reverence
or preparation therevnto.

Macta eſt hoſtia .i. Magis aucta, more encreaſed &amp; made
more pleaſing vnto the Gods; as Virgil ſaith, Macte novâ
virtute puer .i. O good child which encreaſeſt in vertue.
And hence even from this tearme, wee may cōiect, that the
word Macto, which ſignifyeth to kill, &amp; ſometimes to ſacrifice,
hath had its originall, becauſe they did immediatly
after that voice, mactare hoſtiam, that is, ſlay the ſacrifice,
and that was done in thisRoſin. antiq. lib. 3. c. 33. manner. Firſt the Prieſt
did pluck off ſome of the beſts haires between the hornes,
&amp; caſt them into the fire, calling them his prima libamina
.i. his firſt offrings: Then did he turning his face toward the
Eaſt, draw a long crooked knife vpon the beaſts back, cō
                        manding
his vnder officers, which I called Popae (others
Cultrarij, from their knife; Victimarij, from the hoaſt; and
Agones, becauſe they ſtanding ready to giue the ſtroak, often
vſed this word Agon'? for Agóne .i. muſt I to my work?)
to kill the beaſt. The other people ſtanding by, ſome did
with veſſels ſaue the bloud, others did flea or skinne the
beaſt; others waſhed it. Anone ſome ſoothſayer or Prieſt

did obſerue the intrals, turning and winding them with a
knife which was called Seceſpita, à ſecando: for hee might
not touch them with his hand, they conce
                           •
                        ting that if the
ſacrifice had proved polluted, his hand would then haue
periſhed. Now after the ſoothſayer or prieſt had ſufficiently
turned the intrals, and found no

                        ll token therein, then
did thoſe Popae, or Church-butchers, cut off from every bowell
ſome portion, which after they had rolled in barly
meale, they ſent it in baskets to the prieſt, and the prieſt taking
it vp into a broad charger or platter called diſcus, or
lanx, laid it vpon the altar and burne it, &amp;Ioach. Camerar. pro Flacco. this was properly
tearmed litare, or Reddere .i. to ſatisfie by ſacrifice, or
to pay the ſacrifice, which was owen vnto the Gods. After
that the portion laid out for the Gods, had beene burnt,
then did al the people repaire vnto a common feaſt; where,
as they were eating, they ſung hymnes, and ſongs in the
praiſe of their Gods, and playing on cymbals, they danced
about the altars; intimating therby, that there was no part
of their body, but ſhould bee imployed in the ſervice of
their Gods. Now vntill all their ceremonies and myſteries
were finiſhed, it was not lawful for any to taſte of this feaſt:

vnto thoſe ſeveral appendices vnto religion;
namely the Romane yeare, their plaies, their
māner of feaſting, their ſeveral kinds of garments,
their Nuptials and Funerals. This
word Annus is ſo called quaſi Annulus, becauſe
(as the Greeke word 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

.i. in ſe convertitur annus: which was the reaſon why the
Egyptians in their myſticall cyphers (called literae hieroglyphicae)
did vſe the picture of a ſerpent, having his taile in his
mouth to ſignifie an yeare. The time or ſpace of this yeare
hath beene diverſe, according to the diverſity of nations.
Plutarch. in Numa. Some allowed no more daies to an yeare, then we doe to
a month; and thence they called it annum lunarem.
                        Plutarch. ib Some
allowed fowre monthes, ſome ſixe monthes, ſome ten: And
thus Romulus meaſured his yeare, counting that a ſufficient
time for an yeare, which was ſufficiēt for a womās travel in
childbirth: or for an womā to mourne for the death of her
husband.
                     
                        Quod ſatis eſt vtero matris dum prodeat infans,
                        Hoc anno ſtatuit temporis eſſe ſatis.
                        Per totidem menſes à funere coniugis vxor

Thus Romulus his yeare contained of monthes ten; of daies
three hundred and fowre: but after this, Numa,
                        Vid. Geor. Merulam in orat. pro Q. Ligario. or as ſome
ſaie, Tarquinius Priſcus perceiving that the monthes did
not alwaies fall out alike every yeare; but ſometimes the
ſame month would happen in the ſommer, ſometimes in
the winter, therevpon after long ſtudy and many inſtructions
from the Grecians finding the reaſon of this confuſedneſſe,
he added vnto Romulus his yeare fifty daies, ſo that
the whole yeare afterward was divided into twelue moneths;
becauſe the moone had finiſhed her courſe 12. times
in that ſpace; Beginning their yeare then at Ianuary: becauſe
then in his iudgemnt was the fitteſt time to beginne
the yeare, when the ſunne being fartheſt from vs did begin
to turne his courſe, and to come vnto vs againe; which is about
Ianuarie, the ſun being about the Tropicke of Capricorne.
Afterward vpon a ſuperſtitious conceite of the odde
number, Numa added one day more vnto Ianuary, ſo that
wheras at the firſt Numa his yeare did agree with the Grecian
yeare, both of them containing three hundred fifty
fowre daies; Now the Romane yeare contained three hundred
fifty fiue daies, which computation falling out too
ſhort for the true yeare by the ſpace of ten daies, and ſixe
howres yearly, it occaſioned every eighth yeare the interpoſition
of three whole months, which they called their
leape yeare:G Merula in orat. pro Q. Ligario. This confuſednes afterward Iulius Caeſar by
long ſtudy remedied, adding the odde ten dayes vnto Numa
Pompilius his yeare. And leaſt the odd ſix houres might
at laſt breed diſorder in their computation, hee appointed
that every fourth yeare a whole day ſhould bee inſerted,
next after the three and twentieth of Februarie; which inſerting
they called Intercalatio from an old verbe Intercalo,
and that day they called Intercalarem. Now the day following
being the foure and twentieth of Februarie, was
alwaies the ſixt of the Kalends of March,G. Merula in orat. pro Q Ligar. and therefore
becauſe of the interpoſition of that day, they called the
leap-yeare Annum biſſextilem .i. the yeare wherein there

falled out two dayes which they called Sext. Calend. Martij.
And the day thus interpoſed, was called dies biſſextus.
This computation which Iulius Caeſar found out wee haue
embraced, and do at this day follow, calling our yeare Annum
Iulianum,
                        Roſin. Ant Rom. lib. 4. and Annum magnum, having relation to
the monthly yeare called Annus Lunaris; and ſometimes
this great yeare is called, Annus vertens à vertēdo, becauſe
it is alwaies turning, and running on.Hubert lib. 3 epiſt. famil. 18. Moreover we muſt
remēber that the Romans did begin their yeare at March;
whence that month which ſince hath beene called Iulius
in the honour of Iulius Caeſar was by them called Quintilis,
becauſe it was the 5 month: and that month which ſince
hath beene called Auguſtus, in the remembrance of Auguſtus
Caeſar was by them called Sextilis, becauſe it was
their ſixt month. Thus then the great yeare being divided
into twelue months, every month was divided into three
parts .i. Calendas, Nonas, and Idus. For the better, vnderſtanding
of which, I ſhall inſert three common verſes.

                     That is the firſt day of every month is called the Kalends
of that month. The 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. and 7 of theſe foure months,
May, October, Iuly, and March, were called the Nones of
that month: but in all the other months the Nones contained
but the 2. 3. 4. and 5 day, ſo that the fifth day (for example
ſake) of Ianuarie was called Nonae Ianuariae, or Ianuarij,
the fourth Pridie Nonarum, or Nonas Ian. (For they
vſed alwaies to ſay Pridie Cal. Pridie Nonar. and Pridie Iduum,
in ſteed of ſecundo Cal. Non. Id.) The third day of Ianuarie,
they called tertium Nonarum, vel Nonas Ianuar.
the ſecond day of Ianuarie they called quartum Nonarum,
vel Nonas Ianuar. After the Nones followed the Ides,
which contained eight dayes in every month, ſo that the
15 day of the foure aforeſaid months, were called Idus
Maij, Idus Octob. Iaus Iulij, and Idus Martij. In all the other

months, the 13th day was the Ides: as to proceed in
Ianuarie, the thirteenth day was called Idus Ianuar. the
twelfth Pridie Iduum, vel Idus Ianuar. The eleventh tertio
Iduum, or Idus Ian. the tenth quarto Iduum, vel Idus Ian.
the ninth 5o 
                        Id. Ian. the eighth 6o 
                        Id. Ian. the ſeaventh 7o
                        Id. Ian. the ſixt 8o 
                        Id. Ian. After the Ides then followed the
Kalends of the next month. As the fourteenth of Ianuarie
was decimo nono Calendarum, or Calendas Februar.; the fifteenth
decimo octavo Calend. Feb. the ſixteenth decimo ſeptimo
Cal. Feb. &amp;c. Where we muſt note that as often as we
vſe Pridie, tertio, quarto, or any of thoſe numerals with an
accuſatiue caſe, as Pridie Calendas, &amp;c. the Grammarians
ſay that this praepoſition Ante is eclipſed. It followeth
now that I ſhould treate of the daies, which are the leſſer
parts of the yeare: where before we proceed wee will conſider
the parts which the Romanes divided their day into.

                     The day and night againe were each of them divided into
primam, ſecundam, tertiam, &amp; quartam vigiliā, every watch

containing three houres. The firſt of the night began at ſix
of the clocke in the evening, and the fourth ended at ſix
of the clocke in the morning.Alex. Gen. lib. 1. cap. 12. Theſe watches were diſtinguiſhed
by ſeverall notes and ſounds of cornets or trumpets,
that by the diſtinction and diverſity thereof, it might
eaſily be knowne what watch was ſounded. Moreover we
muſt vnderſtand that the Romanes, vpon a ſuperſtitious cō
                        ceit,
and obſervation of misfortunes and evill events falling
out on ſome daies, and more happy ſucceſſe vpon others,
haue called the former ſort of daies Atros dies, &amp; the
latter ſort Albos dies,
                        Vid. Eraſm Adag. vnione ſignare. borrowing the names from the Scythians,
who vſed to chalke out the fortunate daies in their
Kalenders with white characters, whence Horace ſaith,
Creſſâ non careat pulchra dies notâ.
Other-ſome, as their vnfortunate and vnlucky daies, were
noted with a coale or blacke character, according to that,
Nigro carbone notatus.
Againe their Kalender diſtinguiſhed ſome daies for Holydaies,
which they called Dies feſtos, feſtivall daies, or dies
Feriatos, &amp; Ferias, Holy-daies,Aſcenſius in epiſt. 3. illuſt. vir. lib. 2. becauſe they did vpon ſuch
daies Ferire victimas .i. offer vp ſacrifices. Others were diſtinguiſhed
for working daies, which they called Profeſtas
quaſi procul à feſtis. The third diſtinction was of halfe-holy-daies,
which ab intercidendo, they called Dies interciſos
as it were dayes cut aſunder: the one part of them being
allotted for worldly buſineſſes, the other for holy and religious
exerciſes.Roſin. antiq. lib. 4. c. 3. Theſe feriae were either privatae, and ſo
they belōged ſomtime to whole families, as Familiae Claudiae,
Aemiliae; Iuliae, &amp;c. ſometimes to private perſons, as
every one his birth day, particular expiations, &amp;c. or elſe
they were Publicae, ſuch as the whole commonwealth did
obſerue: and they were of two ſorts, the one called Anniverſaria,
which were alwaies to be kept on a certaine day,
Alex. Gen. dier. lib. 5. c. 7. and therevpon they were called feriae ſtatiuae; the other
conceptiuae which were arbitrarie, and ſolemniſed vpō ſuch
daies as the magiſtrates and prieſts thought moſt expedient,

whereof the Latinae Feriae were chiefe: which Latinae
Feriae were kept on moūt Albane to Iupiter Latiar, for the
preſervation of all the Latine people in league &amp; confederacy
with the Romanes, and were ſolemniſed in memorie
of the truce between thoſe two nations. Thoſe feriae which
were calledAlex. Gen. dier. lib. 5. c. 7. 
                        Imperatiuae &amp;

Praetor, or chiefe Pontifie, according to their pleaſure
imperabant, &amp; indicebaut has .i. commanded them, may in
my opinion be contained vnder that member of Feriae conceptivae,
in reſpect of the vncertaintie of them. Another diſtinction
of daies is found in the Roman Kalender, to haue
beene in Faſtos, whole court or leet-daies; Ex parte Faſtos,
Halfe court dayes; Nefaſtos, Non-leet daies: though this
word Nefaſtus be often expounded vnlucky, as in that of
Carminun. lib 2. Ode. 13▪
                         
                        Horace touching the tree, Ille &amp; nefaſto te poſuit die .i. He
plāted thee in an vnhappy time. Theſe daies were ſo called
à fando, frō ſpeaking; becauſe vpon thoſe daies which were
Faſti, the Praetor, or L. chiefe Iuſtice might lawfully keepe
court and adminiſter iuſtice, which was not done without
the ſpeaking of theſe three words, Do, Dico, and Addico;

Where by the way wee muſt note, that ſometimes theſe
court daies were alſo called dies comitiales, becauſe that

only comitialis dies doth ſignifie a law day, but comitialis

perſon.

                     De Ludis.
                     THis word Ludus hath diverſe acceptions, ſometimes
it is takē for a ieſt or ſcoffe, as vt me ludos facit? How
he ſcoffeth me? Sometimes for a place of exerciſe
where any feate is learned, as ludus literarius, a ſchoole for
learning; ludus gladiatorius a fence-ſchoole; and Aperire

ludùm, to ſet vp a ſchoole. Sometimes for any game, paſtime,
or ſport publiquely exhibited, either that thereby
the Gods might bee appeaſed, or the applauſe and favour
of the people gained. Theſe games from the diverſity
of the place where they were had, may be divided into ludos
compitales, circenſes, &amp; ſcenicos. Compitales were ſuch
asAlex. Gen. dier. lib. 6. c. 19. vſually were ſolēnzied in compitis. .i. in the croſſe-waies
and open ſtreetes. Circenſes were circque-ſhewes, taking
their appellatiō either frō the great circque, or ſhewplace,
called Circus Max: where the games were exhibited; or
from the ſwords wherewith the players were invironed, as
one would ſay Circaenſes. They much reſembled thoſe
Grecian games, called certamina Olympica, where the rū
                        ners
with chariots were hemmed in on the one ſide with
the running river, and on the other with ſwords pitched
point-wiſe, that they ſhould hold on the race directly, and
not ſwarue aſide without danger.Roſin. Ant lib. 5. cap. 5. Some haue thought thē
to be the ſame with ludi Gymnici, ſo called from

                        , naked;
becauſe that thoſe which did performe theſe kinde of
exerciſes did either put off all, or the greateſt part of their
clothes, to the intent that they might the more readily and
nimbly performe their games; for which purpoſe they did
alſo annoint their bodies with oile:Vid. Eraſm. adag. operam &amp; oleum pe

circque were diverſe; namely fifty-cuffes, fencing with
ſwords, ſhaking the ſpeare, dauncing in plaine ground, leaping, iumping, caſting the dart, wreſtling, running the race
with chariots, which was called certamen bigarum vel quadrigarum;
playing at whorle-bats, which was tearmed bel

though ſometimes this diſcus was made of yron or braſſe:
The players thereat were called 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                         from

                         and

                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        , to dart or caſt out any thing. The third ſort of plaies

were ludi Scenici, ſtage-plaies. The reaſon of this name ſcena
may be ſeeneVid. pag. 14. before.Lazius de Repub. Rom. lib. 10. cap. 11. The firſt inſtitution of them was
occaſioned by reaſō of a great ſicknes, which by no medicinary
help could be removed; The Romanes ſuperſtitiouſly
conceiting, that ſome new games or ſports being found
out the wrath of the Gods woulde thereby bee vnarmed.
Alex. Gen. dier. l. 6. c. 19. Wherevpon about the fowre hundreth yeare after the
building of Rome they ſent for certaine ſtage-players out
of Hetruria, which they called Hiſtriones frō the Hetruriā
                        
word Hiſter, which ſignified ſuch a player. Concerning
the diverſe kindes of ſtage-plaies I read of fowre, called by
the Grecians, Mimicae, Satyrae, Tragoediae, Comoediae: by the
Romanes Planipedes, Attellanae, Praetextatae, Tabernariae. In
Engliſh, Fables Mimicall, Satyricall, Tragicall, Comicall.
Theſe Mimicall players did much reſemble the clowne in
many of our Engliſh ſtage-plaies, who ſometimes would
go a tip-toe in deriſion of the mincing dames; ſometimes
would ſpeak ful-mouthed to mocke the country-clownes;
ſometimes vpon the top of their tongue to ſcoffe the citizen.
And thus, by their imitation of all ridiculous geſtures
or ſpeeches, in al kinde of vocations, they provoked laughter;
whence both the plaies and plaiers were named Mimi,
from 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                         an Imitator, or one that doth apelike counterfet
others: as likewiſe they were called Planipedes, becauſe
the Actors did enter vpon the ſtage planis pedibus .i.Alex. ib 
                        Excalceati
barefooted. The ſecond ſort of plaies were called
Satyrae,
                        Anteſignan in ſuis obſer. de metris comicis. Teren. praefixis. frō the laſcivious and wanton country-Gods called
Satyri, becauſe the Actors in theſe Satyricall playes, did
vſe many obſcene poems, and vnchaſt geſtures to delight
their ſpectators. Afterwarde theſe kinde of actors as wee
may coniect, did aſſume ſuch liberty vnto themſelues, that
they did freely and without controlement, ſharpely taxe &amp;
cenſure the vices even of kings, as wel as of the commons,
inſomuch that now wee call every witty poeme, wherein
the liues and manners of men are ſharpely taxed, A ſatyre,
or ſatyricall poeme.Vid Eraſm. adag.

                        Satyra mordax fuit &amp; ſalſum genus

carminis. Theſe ſatyricall plaies were alſo called Attellanae,
from the city Attella in Campania, where they were often
acted. The third ſort of ſtage-plaies, were called Tragoediae,
from 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                         a goat, and 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                         an ode or ſong; becauſe the actors
thereof had a goat given them as a reward. And likewiſe
they were called Praetextatae, frō 
                        Praetexta, a certaine
Romane robe, which theſe actors did vſe to weare in their
plaies. The fourth ſort were comoediae, frō 
                        
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        , which ſignifieth
villages, and 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        : becauſe theſe kinde of actors did
go vp and downe the country acting theſe Comedies in the
villages as they paſſed along. They were likewiſe called
Tabernariae à tabulis .i. from the boards or pentices wherewith
they were ſheltred frō the weather, whiles they were
acting. Theſe two laſt ſorts of plaies, namely Tragedies &amp;
Comedies being ſtill in vſe amongſt vs, it will be worth our
labour to conſider the communities, wherin they agree; &amp;
likewiſe the proprieties or notes of diſtinction by which
they differ. I finde three ſorts of parts, wherein they agree,
namely partes primariae, acceſſoriae, circūſtantes; parts principal,
acceſſory, and circumſtances, which are not ſo truely
parts, as accidental ornamēts added to beautifie the plaies.
The principal parts are 4. in reſpect of the matter treated
of. For as farre as the declaration or expoſition of the matter
in hand reacheth, without intimation of the event to
enſue, ſo farre reacheth the firſt part called 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        , which
word ſignifieth no more then a propoſition or declaration.
But when the play inclineth to its heate &amp; trouble, thē
enſueth the ſecond part called 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        , which ſignifieth
the intenſion or exaggeration of matters. The third part is
called 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                         .i. the ſtate and full vigour of the play. The
laſt part which is an vnexpected change into a ſuddaine
tranquillity and quietneſſe is called 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        : whence by a
metaphor it hath beene tranſlated to ſignifie the end, or
period of any other thing; or rather the inclination vnto
the end, as vitae, humanae cataſtrophe, the end of a mans life.
In reſpect of the players forſaking the ſtage, the parts were

fiue; namely the fiue Acts. For the Actors did fiue times in
every Comedie and Tragedie forſake the ſtage, and make as
it weare ſo many interruptions. The occaſion whereof is
ſuppoſed to haue been this, That the ſpectators might not
be wearied out with a continued diſcourſe or action, but
that they might ſometimes be delighted with variety intermixed.
For thoſe breaches and chaſmes betweene each
act, were made vp and ſupplyed, either by the Chorus, or
Muſicke. Where we muſt note, that every Tragedy and Comedie
muſt haue fiue Actus, and no more, according to
that of Horace.

Againe we muſt remember that it is not neceſſary that the

                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                         ſhould alwaies be cōtained in the firſt Act, though
many times it happeneth ſo: for in Plautus his bragging
ſouldier the Protaſis is found in the ſecond Act: and ſo likewiſe
haue the other three parts .i. Epitaſis, Cataſtaſis &amp; Catastrophe
their bounds vnbounded. Theſe Acts are divided
into ſeverall ſcenes, which ſometimes fal out more, ſometimes
fewer in every Act. The definition of a ſcene being

The partes acceſſoriae in a Comedy are foure, Argumentum,
Prologus, Chorus, &amp; Mimus. The firſt is the matter or ſubiect
of the Comedy: the ſecond is the Prologue, which is
either 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        , ſuch as doth open the ſtate of the fable, at
which time there needeth no argument; or elſe 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        ,
ſuch as cōmendeth the fable, or the Poet vnto the people;
or laſtly 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        , ſuch as ſhall refute the obiections and
cavils of adverſaries. The third is Chorus, which ſpeaketh
betweene each Act; and this Chorus may conſiſt either of

one, or many ſpeakers, &amp; that either male or female:Roſin. ant. cap. de trag. &amp; com. lib. 5. but
with this caution, that if a male be to be commended, then
muſt the Chorus conſiſt of males; if a female be to be commended,
then muſt it conſiſt of females. And alwaies whatſoever
the Chorus ſpeaketh, it muſt be pertinent vnto the
Act paſt, or covertly intimating ſomewhat enſuing.

                     The fourth and laſt acceſſory part, was Mimus the clowne
or foole of the play. Of all theſe parts 
                           〈◊〉
                         tragedy hath onely
a Chorus. The partes circumſtantes, or accidentall ornaments
were foure, common to both, Titulus, Cantus, Saltatio,
Apparatus .i. the title of the play, Muſicke, Dauncing,
and the beautifying of the ſcene. By the Scene in this
place, I vnderſtand the partition betweene the players veſtry,
and the ſtage or ſcaffold. This partition at the acting
of a Tragedy was vnderpropped with ſtately columnes &amp;
pillars, and beautified with paintings reſembling princely
buildings, and the images as well of Gods as Kings. At the
acting of a Comedy country-cottages and private buildings
were painted in the out face of the partition. In the
Satyricall plaies the painting was overcaſt with ſhadowes
of mountaines and woods: TheAlex. Gen. dier. l. 5. c. 16. firſt of theſe partitions
they called Scenam Tragicam, the ſecond Comicam, the
third Satyricam. The differences betweene a Tragedy &amp; a
Comedy which may be collected out ofAnteſig. in ſuis obſerv. de metris comicis Teren. praefixis. 
                        Anteſignanus are
theſe: firſt in reſpect of the matter, becauſe a Tragedy treateth
of exilements, murders, matters of griefe, &amp;c. a Comedy
of loue toyes, merry fictions, and petty matters, the one
being 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        ; the other 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        . In a Tragedy
the greateſt part of the Actors are Kings and Noble perſons;
in a Comedy private perſons of meaner ſtate and cō
                        dition.
The ſubiect of a Comedy is often feigned, but of a
Tragedy it is commonly true, and once really performed.
The beginning of a tragedy is calme and quiet, the ende
fearefull and turbulent; but in a comedy contrarily the beginning

is turbulent, and the end calme. Another differēce
which Anteſignanus hath omitted is behouefull for vs to
knowe, namely that the Tragedians did weare vpon the
ſtage a certaine ſhooe comming halfe way vp the legge in
manner of buskins, which kind of ſhooe was called by thē
                        Cothurnus, and from that cuſtome it hath beene occaſioned,
that Cothurnus is tranſlated to ſignifie a Tragicall and
loftie ſtile; as Sophocleo digna Cothurno, matters beſeeming
Sophocles his ſtile: &amp; ſometimes a tragedy it ſelfe. The Comediās
did vſe an high ſhooe cōming vp aboue the ankle,
much like a kind of ſhooes which plough-mē vſe to weare
to keepe themſelues out of the durt. This kinde of ſhooe is
called Soccus, by which word ſometimes alſo is ſignified a
Comedy, as

Tragicall, and Comicall, if they were acted according to the
Grecian rite and cuſtome, then were they called Palliatae,
from pallium, a certaine mantle which the Grecians did vſe
to weare: if according to the Romane manner, then were
they called from the Romane gowne Togatae. Another diviſion
of playes hath beene taken not from the place where
they were exhibited, but from the final cauſe or reaſō why.
Some were celebrated in the honour of the Gods, &amp; they
were named Ludi ſacri; others for the performāce of ſome
vow, being called therefore Ludi votiui; others for the
more ſolemne celebration of funerals, whence they were
called Ludi funebres: laſtly others for ſport and exerciſe
called therefore Ludi ludicri. Vnto thoſe ſacred or holy
playes belonged theſe; ludi Megalenſes, otherwiſe called
Megaleſia, which were ſports ſolemnized in the honour

The votiui ludi were alſo performed in the honour of ſome
God, but they were diſtinguiſhed from ludi ſacri, becauſe

theſe votivi were performed only vpon occaſion of ſome
ſpeciall vow made: for whenſoever the Romans did vndertake
any deſperate warre, then did ſome Roman magiſtrate
Vovere ludos vel templa, conditionally, that they got the
conqueſt.Aſcenſius epiſt. viror. illuſt. lib. 5. Whiles the magiſtrate vttered this his vow, he
was ſaid Vota nuncupare or facere vota .i. to make a ſolemne
vow vnto the Gods; The vow being thus made, hee
was ſaid to be votireus. .i. conditionally bound &amp; obliged
to the performance of this vow, ſo that the Gods might
challenge the thing vowed as due debt, if they granted his
requeſt. But the requeſt being granted, then was hee ſaid
damnatus voti, vel voto .i. ſimply bound to the performance
of it; ſo that by a conſequence Damnari voti vel voto, is to
haue ones deſire accompliſhed. The third ſort of plaies,
which wee called ludos funebres, was fencing and playing
of prizes, the cuſtome among the Romanes being, that at
the funerals of their friends, they would procure certaine
ſlaues and captiues to ioyne combate vpon the Amphitheatre,
vntil one of them had beene killed; whence thoſe fencers
were called Buſtuarij, from buſtum, the place where
dead mens bodies were burned. They firſt began their
fight with certaine cudgels, or yardes called Rudes &amp; after
ward went to naked weapons (&amp; that was termed dimicare
&amp; verſis armis pugnare, this word verſis ſignifying mutatis
according toSaturn. ſermon. l. 2. c. 19. 
                        Lipſius) whereat they fought till one was
killed; neither was the other ſo acquitted, but he ſtood liable
to vndertake another, &amp; ſo a third, vntil he had foyled
ſix or ſeaven combatants: and if his hap were to prevaile
ſo often, then did he receaue a garland or coronet of palme
tree, wound about with certaine woollen ribbands called
Lemniſci.
                        Fr. Sylvius in orat. pro Sex. Roſcio. The coronet it ſelfe was called therefore palma
lemniſcata: and hence figuratiuely hath palma beene tranſlated
to ſignifie the victory it ſelfe; andFr. Sylv. ib. ſuch a mā as hath
often gotten the prize, we ſay proverbially, that he is Plurimarum
palmarum homo. The reaſon why the palme tree
rather then any other tree ſhould bee given in token of

victory is rendred byAriſt. prob. 7. Plut. ſymp. 8 q 4. A. Gell. lib. 3. cap. 6. divers good authors to bee this;
becauſe the palme tree, though you put never ſo ponderous
and heavy weight vpon it, yet it will not yeeld, but
rather indeavour the more vpward. After hee had foiled ſix
or ſeaven, hee receaved one of thoſe ſtaues or cudgels alſo,
wherewith they began their combat, in token of libertie;
ſignifying thereby, that hee ſhould hence for-ward lead
his life free frō ſhedding of blood. Alluding vnto which
cuſtome this wordEraſ. Adag. Rudem accip.

plaies called Ludi ludicri, were either military to traine vp
young men in the knowledg of the art military, and thoſe
were called ludi caſtrenſes: or elſe they were only for exerciſe,

                     De menſis &amp; convivijs Romanorum.
                     BEfore we proceed vnto the deſcription of the Romane
tables, and manner of their feaſting, we will explaine
thoſe fiue tearmes Ientaculum, Prandium, Merenda,
Coena, &amp; Comeſſatio: which fiue words doe ſignifie the fiue
ſeveral feedings each day, which childrē, old men, ſervāts,
travellers &amp; ſuch like did vſually obſerue. Ientaculum ſignified
their break-faſt, and it had its name like as our Engliſh
word hath a Ieiunio from faſting. In former times it
was calledRoſin. Antiq. l. 5. cap. 27▪
                         
                        Silatum from Sile, with the root whereof they
were wont to ſeaſon that wine, which they had at breakefaſt.
For (asPlutarch. in ſymp. l. 8. q 6. 
                        Plutarch ſaith) their breakfaſt was nothing
but a ſop dipped in wine. In the ſame place hee likewiſe
ſaith, that in old time they had no dinner, but that which

we call prandium, was the ſame with them as ientaculum; &amp;
thus much the Greek word 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                         ſignifying a dinner doth
intimate. For it is ſo ſaid quaſi 
                        
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                         from 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        , which
Plutarch interpreteth the morning. And therefore, when
through Epicuriſme this dinner time called prandium crept
in as a diſtinct meale, it was called 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                         from 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        ,
which ſignifieth in continent, or one which cannot tē

ſignifying noone-tide. The third time of taking meat, was
called Merenda, becauſe it was takē 
                        poſt meridiem; we may
engliſh it our afternoones boever; it was called alſo Antecoenium,
becauſe it was taken a little before ſupper.Iuſt. Lipſ▪ ep cent. 1. ep 65.

Their fift &amp; laſt time of feeding, was called in latin comiſſatio

                        Ioannes
Tiſtinus ſaith that it is a boever takē after ſupper, or a night
drinking. But the chiefe feaſt whereatLazius de Repub. Rom. lib. 3 cap. 3. they gaue entertainement
being their ſupper, we will conſider theſe three
things therin. Firſt Accumbendi vel diſcumbēdi rationem .i.
the manner of their lying at ſupper (for they ſate not at table
as we do.) Secondly, the forme &amp; faſhiō of their table;
and laſtly the parts of their ſupper. The place where they
ſupped was commonly called coenaculum à coena, as our dining-chamber
is ſo called from our dinner. It was alſo called
Tricliniū
                         or Biclinium from 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                         a bed: for ſometimes
there were three beds, ſometimes but two about the table,
vpon which the gueſts did ſit, or rather ly along. In this dining
parlour was placed a table, ſometimes made quite
round; and for the common ſort of people it was made of
ordinary wood, ſtanding vpon three feet; but for men of
better faſhion, it was made of better timber, inlaid ſometimes
with wood of divers colours, ſometimes with ſilver,

and it ſtood vpon one whole entire foote made of yvory in
the forme of a great Lyon or Leopard, &amp;c. ſometimes this
table was made in the forme of an halfe moone, the one
part of it being cut in with an arch or ſemicircle, and then
it was called Sigma, becauſe it did much reſemble the letter
Sigma,
                        Iuſt. Lipſ. cent. 1. ep. 65. which (as it appeareth by certaine marble monuments)
was in old time made like a Romane C. If any mā
ſhould demand the reaſon why they cut their table in that
forme, I muſt confeſſe that I haue not read any reaſon in any
autor: but my coniecture is this. It is agreed vpon by all
autors, that in the round tables the one quarter was reſerved
void frō gueſts, that the waiters might haue a cōvenient
roomth to attend. Therevpon it ſeemeth not vnprobable
to me, that this crooked arch was made for the waiters.
I acknowledge that this Sigma hath beene tranſlated
diverſly by diverſe writers, as it appeareth byIuſt. Lip. ib. 
                        Lipſius. By
ſome it hath beene taken for the parlour or ſupping chamber;
(Lipſius in his Antiquities) by others for the ſupper, or
feaſt it ſelfe; ſo Coelius thought. By Lipſius ſince it hath bin
thought a certaine place erected in manner of an hemicycle,
or halfe-moone, againſt which they did place their
beds: but Brodaeus &amp; Ditmarus (in my opiniō) haue more
truely taken it for the table it ſelfe. About the table that
was perfectly round were placed three beds, covered with
tapeſtry or ſome other kinde of covering, according to the
wealth and ability of the perſon: and thus ſtrato diſcumbitur
oſtro, the beds being ready furniſhed the gueſts lay
downe on them in manner as followeth. Each bed contained
three perſons, ſometimes fowre, ſeldome or never
more, except at their great feaſts. Many times it fell out,
that each gueſt had his bed to himſelfe, whenceA. Gel.

                        A. Gellius
ſaith, that the nūber of gueſts ſhoulde begin with the Graces,
and end with the Muſes .i. they muſt not be fewer then
three, nor more then nine. This alſo hath beene the reaſon
of that Adage.Alex. Gen. dier. l. 5. c. 21.

If one onely lay vpon the bed, then he reſted the vpper

part of his body on his left elbow, the lower part lying at
length vpon the bed: but if many lay vpō one bed, then the
vppermoſt did lie at the beds head, laying his feet behinde
the ſecond his backe: the ſecond reſted his head in the others
boſome, having a cuſhion put betweene, laying his
feete behinde the thirde his back; in like maner the third &amp;
fourth did lie. They divided their ſupper into three partes;
which they called their firſt, ſecond, and third meſſe. In the
firſt meſſe commonly was ſerved mulberries, lettices, ſauſages,
and alwaies egges; as likewiſe in the laſt meſſe were
ſerved, nuts, figs, grapes, but alwaies apples:Pancirol. li re

ſay proverbially ab ovo ad mala, from the beginning of the
feaſt to the end, or ſimply from the beginning of any thing
vnto the end thereof. The middle meſſe was the maine ſupper,
and the chiefe diſh thereof was called caput coenae.

                     WE may obſerue in reading old autors, that as
well the Romanes as the Grecians had diverſe
diſtinct habits, or outward veſtimēts. The Grecians
had their Mantile called Pallium; the Romanes their
gowne called Toga, and by this different kinde of garment
the one was ſo certainly diſtinguiſhed from the other, that
this word Togatus was often vſed to ſignifie a Romane, and
Palliatus a Grecian.

                        Togati pro Romanis dicti, vt Palliati

this Toga was, &amp; then how many ſorts there were.Mic. Toxita in orat. Philippic. 2am. 
                        Toga à
tegendo dicta eſt. It was made commonly of wooll but according
to the worth and dignity of the perſon, ſomtimes
of courſer, ſometimes of finer wooll. As we may collect by
that of Horace,
                        
                           —Mihi ſit toga, quae defendere frigus

did weare the Romane gowne, but inſteede thereof did vſe

a garment called stola from 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

                        Sig. de iud. lib. 3. cap. 19. This toga
ſometimes was worne open and vntuckt; then was it called
Toga aperta: other times it was tuckt vp, &amp; then it was called
toga praecincta. This cincture or girding vp of the gown
was according toSig. ibid. 
                        Sigonius threefold; Cinctura laxior, Aſtrictior,
and Cinctus Gabinus. Cinctura laxior or the looſe
kinde of girding was ſuch, that notwithſtanding the tuck,
yet the taile trailed vpon the ground. Cinctura aſtrictior
the cloſe kinde of girding was ſuch, that after the
gowne had beene lapped or tucked vp, it ſhould not reach
ſo farre as the feet. The firſt kinde of theſe cinctures did argue
a remiſſe ſoft and effeminate minde; the latter did ſignifie
the promptneſſe or readineſſe of the perſon;Sig. ibid. 
                        Vnde,
Altè praecincti pro expeditis dicti ſunt. Thirdly, Cinctus Gabinus
was a warlike kind of girding, not ſo that the whole
gown ſhould be tucked vp about the midle, but that it being
caſt quite backward, the party ſhould gird himſelfe
with one skirt thereof.Serv. Aenci. lib. 7. This kind of girding was ſo called
from a certaine citie of Campania called Gabij, becauſe vpon
a time the inhabitants of this citie being at ſacrifice,
were ſet vpon by their enimies; at which time they caſting
their gownes behind them and girding one lappet or skirt
about them, went immediatly to warre, even from the
altars, and got the conqueſt.Alex. Gen. dier. l. 1. c. 14. In memory of which ever after,
the Conſul when hee would proclaime warre girded
himſelfe in like manner. Neither had the Conſul alone a peculiar
garment when he proclaimed warre, but every ſouldier
in time of warre did weare a different kind of garment
from the gown, which they called Sagum: we may engliſh
it a ſouldiers coat. Whence Tully vſeth this phraſe ad ſaga
ire, which Eraſmus hath paralleld with this, Ad certamen
ſe accingere, to buckle for warre. Inſomuch that Cedant ſaga
togae, is aequiualent to that of the Orators, Cedant arma

togae. Touching the difference of the Romane gownes I
finde them diſtinguiſhed bySig de iud. lib. 3. cap. 19. 
                        Sigonius accordingly as followeth;
in Togam Puram, Candidam, Pullam, Praetextam,
Paludamentum, Pictam, Trabeam. Togapura was the common
ordinary gown worne by private men at mans eſtate,
not by women at al, nor children, vntil the ſixteenth yeare
of their age, at which time they were ſaid Excedere ex ephebis
.i. to be paſt ſtriplings. Notwithſtanding the ſixteenth
yeare was not alwaies ſtrictly without exception
obſerved;Roſin. antiq. lib. 5. c. 32▪
                         for M. Aurelius was permitted to weare this
gowne being but fifteene yeares old; and Caligula did not
weare, it till the nineteenth yeare of his age. This kinde of
gowne beſides that it was called Pura, it was alſo ſometimes
called virilis, ſometimes libera. It was called pura in
reſpect of its pure white colour, being free from all admixtures
of purple or any other colour, &amp; therefore ſome haue
tearmed it 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        , al white, others 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        , void of purple.
It was called virilis, becauſe it was given to ſtriplings
now growing to mans eſtate. Whence wee vſe to ſay of a
ſtripling paſt 16 yeares of his age, virilem togam ſumpſit,
he is now become a man. Laſtly, it was called libera,
                        Roſin. antiq. Rom. lib. 5. c. 32. becauſe
then they did receaue ſome beginning of freedome,
as being about that time freed from their ſchool-maſters,
and overſeers.Aldus Manutius. vid. Roſin. ib. This kinde of gowne was not made open
but ſowed downe to the bottome, and alſo it was made
without ſleeues, ſo that if at any time they had occaſion to
vſe their armes, they would take vp their gowne and caſt it
quite behind them, or vpon their ſhoulders. But theſe ſtriplings
could not for one whole yeares ſpace, caſt back their
gownes in that manner for the liberty of their armes without
the imputation of immodeſty, as it appeareth byCic. in orat. pro Caelio. 
                        Cicero,
Nobis annus erat vnus ad cohibendum brachium togâ
constitutus. The like liberty it ſeemeth was denied thoſe
that ſtood for places of office;Sig de iud. lib. 3. cap. 19. &amp; thence is it, that Horace
wiſheth ſuch to hire them a ſervant —Laeuum
Qui fodiat latus, &amp; cogat trans pondera dextram
Porrigere—
                        
In which place by pondera is vnderſtood the Romane
gowne, asSigon. ib. 
                        Sigonius hath expounded that place. Now for
the vnderſtanding of Toga candida, we are to learne a difference
betweene this candida toga, &amp; the toga pura aboue
ſpoken of, which is often times called toga alba, both of
which were white, but differed in the degree of whiteneſſe.
The toga alba had only the naturall whitenes of the
wool; the toga candida had an artificiall white die: whereby
the glaſſe of the white was made more orient and intēſiue.
Or elſe asSigon. ib. 
                        Sigonius hath obſerued out of Iſidorus, Intendendae
albedinis cauſâ cretam addiderant .i. they chalked
it to encreaſe the whiteneſſe thereof. Whence Polibius calleth
it togam 
                        
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        , that is, ſhining or ſplendent. Moreover
whereas the alba toga was the ordinary Roman gowne
which commonly the Romane citizens did weare; this candida
toga was only worne by thoſe, which did ambire magiſtratum,
ſue for a magiſtracy or place of office who during
the time of their ſute were called from their gowne
candidati: and Quintilian borrowing his metaphor from
them, hath called an young ſtudent eloquentiae candidatum.
The third ſort of gowne which I tearmed togam pullam,
was a blacke gowne, and thereof was two ſeverall kinds;
the one cole-blacke, which was worne luctus cauſa, in token
of mourning, and the mourners were thence called Atrati
and as often as they did weare this gowne, they were
ſ
                           •

                        Sig. de iud. lib. 3. cap. 19. which phraſe in old autors doth ſignify
nothing elſe, but to goe in mourning apparell: The other
not cole-blacke, but only fouled or ſtained, and that
was worne reatus cauſa, in times of arraignement, &amp; thoſe
that wore it were called ſordidati, à ſordibus in veste, from
the ſpots or ſtaines in the gowne. Where wee muſt note,
that in proceſſe of time Togapulla became the ordinarie
gowne which the common people did weare; at which
time the ordinary gown, which the citizēs of better place
and eſteeme did weare, was the toga candida: wherevpon
there did then grow a diſtinction of the citizens vnknown

to the former age, ſaith Rofinus, namely that ſome were
tearmed candidati, others pullati. Candidati were thoſe, not
which became ſuiters for places of office (as in old time it
ſignified) but thoſe which did liue in better repute then others,
from whence it is, thatFeneſtella de mag. Rom. cap 3. hee whoſe office was to read
the Emperours letters in the Senate was called Candidatus
principis▪
                         or Quaeſtor candidatus. It did ſomewhat reſemble
the office of our King his Maieſties chiefe Secretary. Pullati
were thoſe of the commonalty or inferiour ſort. The
fourth ſort of gowne was the togapraetexta, ſo called, quia
eipurpura praetexta erat, becauſe it was garded about with
purple ſilke. This kinde of gowne at the firſt was vſed only
by the Romane prieſts, and chiefe magiſtrates: Neither was
it lawfull for ſuch as did weare that gown to be arraigned,
or ſentence to be giuen on them vntill that gowne was put
off. In continuance of time this togapraetexta was permitted
firſt to Noble mens children; afterward to all Romane
children in generall: where vponPet. Pellitarius in orat. pro A. Cae

is taken for childhood; and praetextati ſometimes
for magiſtrates, but commonly for young children. The
fifth ſort of gowne was called Paludamentum; It was a
military garment, whichAlex. Gen. dier. l. 5. c. 18. none but the L. Generall or the
chiefe captaines did vſe to weare.Sig. de iud. lib. 3. c. 29. 
                        Iſidorus ſaith it was not
only garded with purple, but with skarlet, and gold lace,
whence it was ſometimes calledSigon. ib. 
                        togapurpurea, ſomtimes
coccinea. It was much like the habit which the Grecian Emperour
was wont to weare called Chlamis; yea now it is
Roſin. antiq. li. 5. c. 31. called Chlamis; wee may engliſh it an Heralds coate of
Armes. The ſixt ſort of gowne was called togapicta,
                        Sig. de iud lib. 3. c. 19. becauſe
in it were embroadered goodly pictures with needle
worke: it was alſo called Purpurea, not becauſe of any purple
gard (in which reſpect the praetexta, and the paludamē
                           tum
were called purpureae) but becauſe it was all over with
a purple die. It was by ſome tearmed toga palmata, becauſe
in it many palme branches being the reward and token of

victory were wrought; whence by others it was called toga
triumphalis, becauſe Emperours in their triumphes did
weare ſuch gownes. The laſt ſort of gowne was Trabea,
whereof there wereServ Aenei. lib 7. three ſeverall kinds; the one woven
all of purple, which was conſecrated vnto the Gods; the
ſecond was purple woven vpon white, and this only kings
&amp; Conſuls might weare; the third was skarlet woven vpon
purple, and this the Augures only did weare.Alex. Gen. dier. li. 5. c. 18. This laſt
ſort was therefore called trabea auguralis, the ſecond trabea
regia, the firſt trabea conſecrata.

                     De Tunica.
                     THoſe coats which were worne vnder the gown were
called Tunicae; and that they were worne vnder the
gowne it appeareth by that Adage, Tunica pallio proprior
eſt .i. every one for himſelfe firſt; or according to our engliſh
proverbe, Cloſe ſitteth my ſhirt, but cloſer ſitteth my
skinne.Sig. de iud. lib. 3. cap. 20. This tunica was both narrower and ſhorter then
the gowne: at firſt it was made without ſleeues, afterward
with ſleeues, and by it, as well as by the gowne were the
citizens diſtinguiſhed. The firſt ſort of coats was made of
white cloath commonly,Salmuth in Pancirol. lib. rerum deperdit. cap. de fibula. but purfled over and embroadred
with ſtuds of purple in manner of broad nayle heads;
whence it was called Laticlavia, or Latus clavus; and the
perſons wearing this coat were Senators called thence La
ticlavij. The ſecond ſort belonged vnto the Roman knights
and it differed in making from the firſt, only that the purple
ſtuds or embroadred workes of this, were not ſo broad
as the former: whence the coat was called Anguſticlavia,
or Anguſtus clavus, and the perſons wearing it were called
Anguſticlavij. The third ſort belonged vnto the populacy
and poorer ſort of Romanes, it was made without any
purfled workes, being called Tunica recta. This coate
was given togither with the Virile gowne to ſtriplings
paſt ſixteene yeares olde, and to new maried women.

And as the recta tunica was given with the virile
gowne; ſo was the tunica clauatae given togither with the
toga praetexta: and the laticlavia, otherwiſe called tunica
palmata, given with the toga picta. The fourth and laſt ſort
belonged vnto women, being a long coate reaching down
vnto the heels; they called it ſtolam. Vpon it they did weare
an outward garmentRo

weare this kinde of garment. Beſides the Romane gowne &amp;

was the Penula, ſo called quaſi pendula, we may tranſlate
it a long hanging cloake. A third was called Mitra,
which ſometimes did ſignifie a certaine attire for womens
heads, as a coyfe or ſuch like; though this kinde of attire
was more properly called Calantica: other times it ſignified
a girdle, which more properly was called zona; This zona
chiefly ſignified a ſouldiers belt, or a marriage girdle:
The ſouldiers belt was lined within in the inſide, where
when they went to warre, they did put their mony▪ whence
Horace ſaith of a man that hath loſt his mony, zonam perdidit.

to haue a marriage girdle tyed about their middle, which

called Ceſtus, from whence commeth the latin word inceſtus,
and the engliſh word Inceſt: which in truth ſignifieth
all kinde of pollution committed by vndoing or vntying

of theſe ſhooes did diſtinguiſh the Romane people alſo. To
omit the difference in colours, we may reduce the chiefe
kindes to fiue heads, Mullei, Vncinati, Perones, Cothurni,
Socci. All theſe ſort of ſhooes were made halfe way vp the
legge, as the Turkiſh ſhooes are according to Ioſephus
Scaliger: and they were either laced cloſe to the legge, as
many of our bootes are now adaies; or claſped with taches
or haſpes. The firſt ſort called Mullei

thereby, that the number of the Senators (they onely being

hundred and no more. Vncinati calcei, were thoſe, which
the ſouldiers were wont to weare. Perones (as we may cō

were laced vp the legge; for Tertullian making but
two ſort of ſhooes, ſaith there were the Mullei called frō

                     BEfore we come vnto the ſolemne ceremonies vſed by
the Romanes in their mariages, we will firſt ſhew the
manner of their contracts,Salmuth in Panciroll. lib. rerum deperdi

                           s. which were called by the
Romanes, Sponſalia à spondendo; becauſe in their contracts
each did promiſe other to liue as man and wife. Now the
manner of contracting was commonly thus: They did for
the greater ſecurity write downe the forme of the cōtract
vpon tables of record, as it appeareth by Iuvenal. Satyr. 16.
                     
                        Si tibi legitimis pactam iunctam

                     Theſe tables were alſo ſealed with the ſignets of certaine
witneſſes there preſent, who were tearmed from the act of
their ſealing Signatores. Moreover before they would begin
the ceremonies of their contract, the mā procured one
ſoothſayer, and the woman another, with whom firſt they
would conſult. Whence Iuvenal.
                     
                     —Veniet cum ſignatoribus auſpex. The token or ſigne
which theſe ſoothſaiers in time of obſerving accounted
moſt fortunate was a crow:Alex. Gen. lib. 2. 
                        Ea enim cornicum ſocietas eſt,
vt ex duabus ſocijs alterâ extinctâ vidua altera perpetuò maneat.
The man alſo gaue in token of good will a ring vnto
the woman, which ſhee was to weare vpon the next finger
to the little of the left hand;Aul. Gell. becauſe vnto that finger alone
a certaine artery proceedeth from the hart. The word
nuptiae which ſignifieth mariage had its derivation a Nubo
                        Roſin. antiq. lib. 5. c. 37 which verbe in old time ſignified to cover: the cuſtome

being that the woman ſhould be brought vnto her husbād
with a vaile (called Flammeus) caſt over her face. Againe
becauſe of the good ſucceſſe that Romulus and his followers
had in the violent taking away of the Sabine women,
Sig. de iur. Rom. l. 1. c. 9. they continued a cuſtome that the man ſhould come and
take away his wife, by a ſeeming violence from the lap or
boſome of her mother or her next kinne. Shee being thus
taken away her husband did diſſever and divide the haire
of her head with the top of a ſpeare, wherewith ſome fencer
formerly had beene killed. This ſpeare was called by
them haſta celebaris,
                        Salmuth in Pancirol. lib. rerum deperdit. cap. de nuptiis. and the ceremony did betoken, that
nothing ſhould diſioine them but ſuch a ſpeare or ſuch like
violence. We muſt note thatFr. Silv. in orat. pro L. Flacco. three manner of waies a woman
became a mans lawfull wife vſu, cōfarreatione, coemptione.
A woman became a mans lawfull wife vſu .i. by preſcriptiō
or long poſſeſſiō, if that ſhe were wedded with the
conſent of her overſeers, and ſo did liue with the man as
with her lawfull husband a whole yeares ſpace, nullo interrupto
vſu .i.Sig. de iure Rom. l. 1. c. 9. ſhee beeing not abſent three nightes in the
whole yeare from him. And ſome haue thought that the
counterfeited violence in taking away the maide from her
friends was vſed onely in this kinde of mariage. A woman
became a mans wife confarreatione .i. by certaine ſolemnities
vſed before a Pontifie or chiefe-biſhop, when the woman
was given vnto the man vſing a ſet forme of words,
ten witneſſes being preſent and a ſolemne ſacrifice beeing
offred, at which the maryed couple ſhould eat of the ſame
barly cake, which formerly had beene vſed in ſacrifice.

the mariage it ſelfe Farracia, andCic. orat. pro Muraena. ſometimes ſacra ſimply;
the diſſolution of this kinde of mariage Diffarreatio.
A woman became a mans wife coemptione .i. by buying
and ſelling, when the woman did vnder a feigned forme of

wife to Tarquinius Priſcus: from whence ſprang a cuſtome
among them, that the new maried bride when ſhee
was brought home vnto her husbands houſe, was to vſe
this proverbe, 
                           Ʋbi tu Caius, ibi ego Caia; by which wordes
ſhee ſignifyed that ſhee was now owner of her husbands
goods as well as himſelfe: and therefore Eraſmus hath expounded
that ſaying by theſe words, Vt tu dominus, ita ego
domina. If any of theſe ceremonies were omitted,Hieron. Ferarius in Philippic. corat. then
was the mariage tearmed Nuptiae innuptae, in which ſenſe
we call our enimies giftes no giftes, 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        .
Theſe ceremonies being ended, towards night the woman
was brought home to her husbands houſe with fiue torches,
ſignifying thereby the need which married perſons
haue of fiue Gods or Goddeſſes .i. Iupiter, Iuno, Venus, Suadela,
and Diana, who often times is called Lucina (the reaſon
being rendred by Ovid:
                        
                           —Dedit haec tibi nomina lucus,
                           Aut quia principium tu dea lucis habes.)
                        
The matter whereof theſe torches were made, was a certaine
tree, from which a pitchy liquor did iſſue: it was called
Teda, and thence haue the Poets figuratiuely called
both the torches, and the wedding it ſelfe Tedas. When the
woman had beene thus brought to the dore, then did ſhee
annoint the poſts of the dore with oyle,Serv. Aenei. lib. 4. from which ceremony
the wife was called vxor quaſi vxor. This ceremony
of annointing being ended, the bridemen did lift her over
the threſhold and ſo caryed her in by a ſeeming force,
becauſe in modeſty ſhee would ſeeme not to goe without
violēce into that place where ſhe ſhould looſe her maiden
head: At her carying in al the company did cry out with a
lowd voice Talaſſio, Talaſſio: for which cuſtomePlutarch. vita Pompeii 
                        Plutarch
allegeth many reaſons; this being one. Among thoſe who

raviſhed the daughters of the Sabines, there were founde
ſome of the meaner and poorer ſort carying away one of
the faireſt women: which being knowne certaine of the
chiefe citizens would haue taken her from them, but they
began to cry out that they caried her to Talaſſius, a man
well beloued among the Romanes; at which naming of
Talaſſius they ſuffered her to be caried away, themſelues
accompanying hir, and often crying Talaſſio, Talaſſio. Frō
whence it hath beene continued as a cuſtome among the
Romanes ever after at their mariages to ſing Talaſſio, Talaſſio:
as the Greeks did Hymen, Hymenaee. From this cuſtome
of leading or bringing home the new maried bride, commeth
that comicall phraſe Ducere vxorem, to mary a wife.
Shee being thus brought home, receaued the keyes of her
husbands houſe, whereby was intimated that the cuſtody
of al things in the houſe was then cōmitted vnto her.Alex. Gen. dier. l. 2. c. 5. The
mariage bed was called Genialis lectus, as we may ſuppoſe
quaſi Genitalis. The next day after the mariage the bridewoman
receaued gifts from her friends, which the lawyers
termed Nuptialia dona.
                        Vid. Fr. Silv pro Clientio. But Cicero expoundeth theſe dona
nuptialia, to bee certaine tokens which the husband ſent
vnto his wife before the betrothing. If after the mariage any
diſcontent had fallen out betweene the man &amp; his wife
Sig. de iure Rom. l. 1. c. 9. then did they both repaire vnto a certaine chappell built
in the honour of a certaine Goddeſſe called Dea viriplaca
à viris placandis, whence after they had beene a whiles
there, they returned friends. We hauing thus ſeen the rites
and ceremonies which the Romanes vſed in their contracts
and mariages, it would not bee impertinent to annexe the
manner of their divorcements, which vpō iuſt cauſes were
permitted. ThereRoſin. Antiq. l. 5. cap. 38. were two manner of divorcements, the
one between parties only contracted; the ſecond between
parties maried. The firſt was properly called Repudium, in
which the party ſuing for the divorcement, vſed this forme
of words cōditione tuâ nō vtar. The ſecond was called Divortium,
wherein the partie ſuing for it vſed theſe wordes,

                        Res tuas tibi habeto: vel Res tuas tibi agito. Both theſe kinds
were tearmed Matrimonij renuntiationes, a renouncing or
refuſall of mariage. Where wee muſt note that inſteed of
this verb renunciare, divers good autors do vſe this phraſe
Mittere, or Remittere nuncium: As C. Caeſar Pompeiae nuncium
remiſit, C. Caeſar hath divorce Pompeia. And alluding
herevnto,Ep. fam. l. 5. 
                        Cicero ſaith virtuti nuncium remiſit .i. Hee hath
caſt off all goodneſſe, hee hath even divorced vertue. Secondly
we muſt note that this verbe Renuncio, doth not only
ſignifie to renounce or to refuſe, but many times in Tully
it ſignifieth to declare or pronounce a magiſtrate elected,
as Renunciare conſulem, praetorem, &amp;c.

After the body had thus deceaſed, they kept it ſeven daies
vnburied, waſhing the corps every day with hote water, &amp;
ſometimes annointing it with oyle, hoping that if the body
were only in a ſlumber and not quite dead, it might by
theſe hot cauſes be revived.

In theſe ſeaven daies ſpace, all the dead mans friendes met
together now and then making a great out cry or ſhout
with their voices, hoping that if the dead body had beene
onely in a ſwoune or ſleepe, he might thereby be awaked.
This action was tearmed conclamatio, whence when wee
haue done the beſt we can in a matter, and cannot effect it,
we ſay proverbially conclamatum eſt: for this third conclamation
or generall outcry (which was alway vpon the ſeaventh
day after the deceaſe) was even the laſt refuge, at
which if the body did not reviue, then was it caryed to burial
being inveſted with ſuch a gowne as the parties place
or office formerly had required. Thoſe who had the dreſſing,
cheſting or embaulming of the dead corps were called
Pollinctores: After they had thus embaulmed the corps,
they placed it in a bedde faſt by the gate of the dead mans
houſe, with his face and heeles outward toward the ſtreet,
according to that of Perſius.

This ceremony was properly called corporis collocatio: and
faſt by this bedde neere the gate alſo was erected an altar
called in LatineAlex. Gen. dier. lib. 3. c. 7. 
                        Acerra, vpon which his friendes did every
day offer incenſe vntil the buriall. The gate in the outſide
was garniſhed with cypreſſe branches, if the dead mā
were of any wealth or note: For the poorer ſort, by reaſon
of the ſcarcity of the tree, could vſe no ſuch teſtimony of
their mourning.Lucanus.

In theſe ſeaven daies ſpace certaine men were appointed
to provide all things in readineſſe for the funerall: Which
things were commonly ſold in theAlex. Gen. dier. l. 5. c. 26. Temple of Libitina,
from whence thoſe providers were tearmed Libitinarij;
though ſometimes this word Libitinarius doth ſignifie as
much as capularis an old decrepit mā, ready for the graue.
Vpon the eighth day a certaine cryer in manner of a bellman,
went about the towne to call the people to the ſolē
                        nization

of the funerall, in this forme of words:Roſin. Ant. ib. 5. 
                        Exequias
L. Titio L. Filio quibus eſt commodum ire. Iam tempus eſt.
Ollus ex aedibus effertur. After the people had aſſembled
themſelues together, the bed being covered with purple or
other rich coverings, the laſt conclamation being ended, a
trumpeter went before all the company, certaine poore
women called praeficae following after, and ſinging ſongs in
the praiſe of the party deceaſed. Where wee muſt note that
none but the better ſort had a trumpet ſoūded before thē;
others had only a pipe.Alex. Gen. dier. lib. 3. 
                        Senatoribus &amp; patricijs tubâ; minoribus
&amp; plebeiis tibiâ canebant ſiticines; this word Siticines
ſignifying either a trumpetter or piper, becauſe they did
both ad ſitos .i. mortuos canere. Againe, except it were one
of the Senators or chiefe citizens, hee was not caried out
vpon a bed, but in a coffin vpon a beere. Thoſe that caried
this bed were the next of the kinne, ſo that it fell often among
the Senators themſelues to beare the corps, and becauſe
the poorer ſort were not able to vndergoe the charges
of ſuch ſolemnities, therevpon were they buried commonly
in the duske of the evening; and hence à veſpertino
tempore, thoſe that caried the corps were tearmed veſpae or
vespillones. In the buriall of a Senator or chiefe officer certaine
waxen images of all his predeceſſors were caried before
him vpon long poles or ſpeares, together with all the
enſignes of honour which hee deſerved in his life time.
Moreover if any ſervants had beene manumized by him,
they accompanied the mourners lamenting for their maſters
death. After the corps followed the dead mans children,
the next of the kinne, and other of his friends atrati,
.i. in mourning apparell. The corps being thus brought vnto
their great Oratory called the Roſtra, the next of the kin
Suet. C. Iulius Caeſar. c. 6. 
                        laudabat defunctum pro roſtris .i. made a funerall oration
in the commendation principally of the party deceaſed,
but touching the worthy acts alſo of thoſe his predeceſſors,
whoſe images were there preſent. The oration being
ended, the corps was in olde time caried home againe in

manner as it was brought forth,
Sedibus hunc refer ante ſuis &amp; conde ſepulchro.
But afterward by the law of the twelue tables it was provided,
that no man beſides the Emperour and Veſtal Nuns
ſhould be buryed within the city; though ſome vpon eſpeciall
favour haue obtained it. The manner of their burial
was not by interring the corps, as in former times it had
beene, but burning them in a fire (Salmuth in Pancir. lib. rerū deperd. ca. de exequijs. the reaſon therof being
to prevent the cruelty of their enimies, who in a mercileſſe
revenge would at their conqueſts digge vp the buryed bodies,
making even the dead alſo ſubiects of their implacable
wrath.) This fire before the burning was properly called
Pyra; in the time that it burned it was called Rogus,
                        Servius Aeneid 5. 
                        quod tunc temporis Rogari ſolerent manes; after the burning
then was it called Bustum quaſi benè vſtum. This Pyra
was alwaies built in forme of a tabernacle, as it isSup. pag 30. aboue
more at large to be ſeene: whither after the dead mā had
beene brought, his friends were wont to cut off one of his
fingers, which they would afterward bury, with a ſecond
ſolemnity. The charges at funerals growing by this means
to be doubled, the law of the 12. tables provided in theſe
words Homini mortuo oſſa ne legito, &amp;c: that no mans finger
ſhould be cut off, except he died either in the warre, or
in a ſtrange country. Where we muſt obſerue, that lego in
this place doeth ſignifie as much as adimo or aufero, in
which ſenſe we cal him ſacrilegum, qui legit .i. qui adimit &amp;
aufert ſacra. After the dead body had beene laid vpon the
pyra, then were his eies opened againe to ſhew him heaven
if it were poſſible:Alex. Gen. dier. l. 3. and withall an halfe penny was put in
his mouth, they ſuperſtitiouſly conceiting, that that halfe-penny
was naulum Charontis, the pay of Charon, the ſuppoſed
ferry-man of hell, who was to cary mens ſoules in his
boate over the ſtygian lake after their deceaſe. About this
Pyra were firſt many boughes of Cypreſſe tree to hinder
the evill ſent of the corps to be burned. The dead body being
thus laid vpon the Pyra, the next of the kin turning his

face averſe from the pyra, did kindle the fire with a torch:
After this commonly certain fencers hired for this purpoſe
did combate each with other till one of them was killed;
they were tearmed buſtuarij frō 
                        buſtum. The bloud of thoſe
that were ſlaine, ſerved inſteede of a ſacrifice to the infernall
Gods, which kinde of ſacrifice they tearmed Inferiae.
                        Servius. 
                        Inferiae ſunt ſacra mortuorum, quae inferis ſolvuntur. Anon
after the body had been burned, his neareſt friends did gather
vp the aſhes &amp; bones, which being waſhed with milk
&amp; wine were put into certain pitchers called vrnae: whence
this word vrna is often vſed by Poets to ſignifie a graue or
ſepulchre, as
—Vna requieſcit in vrnâ. Ovid. Met. lib. 4.
                        Roſin. antiq lib. 5. Though properly ſepulchrum was in old time a vault or
arched-roofe, rounde about the wals whereof were placed
certaine coffines called loculi, within which thoſe former
vrnae were laid vp &amp; kept, namely two or three in each coffine.
Now theſe funerall ſolemnities were commonly towards
night, inſomuch that they vſed torches; theſe torches
they properly calledServius in Aeneid lib. 1. 
                        funalia à funibus cerâ circundatis,
vnde &amp; funus dicitur.
                        Hub. in Cic. ep. fam. lib. 4. Others are of opinion that funus
is ſo ſaid from the greeke word 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        , ſignifying death
or ſlaughter. The bones of the burned body being thus gathered
vp, then did the Prieſt beſprinckle the cōpany with
cleane water thriſe, and the eldeſt of the mourning womē
called praeficae, with a lowd voice pronounced this word,
Ilicet, thereby diſmiſſing the company, (the word ſignifying
as much as Ire licet;) Then preſently did the companie
depart taking their farewel of the dead body in this forme
of words: Vale, vale, vale: nos te ordine quo natura permiſerit
ſequemur. If any of theſe ceremonies had beene omitted
Hier. Ferrarius in Cic. orat. Philip. then was it tearmed ſepulitura inſepulta, in the ſame
ſenſe as nuptiae formerly were tearmed innuptae. The old &amp;
aged men were invited after the buriall to a feaſt, or funerall
banquet called ſilicernium
                        Servius in Aeneid. lib. 5. 
                        quaſi filicaenium .i. coena ſupra
ſilicem poſita, their cuſtome being to eate that feaſt vpon

an altar of ſtone, and becauſe this feaſt was onely eaten
at funerals, and by the elder ſort,Anteſig in Tere. Adelph. Act. 4. hence figuratiuely this
worde ſilicernium doeth ſometimes ſignifie an old creeple
ready for the graue. The poorer people inſteede of a feaſt,
received a dole or diſtribution of raw fleſh: this dole was
tearmed 
                           Ʋiſceratio. Moreover there was a potation or
drinking of wine after the buriall called Murrata or Murrhina
potio, which afterward the law of the 12. tables for
the avoiding of expences did prohibit: as likewiſe for the
moderating of griefe in the mourners it did prohibit the
vſe of this word Leſſum, [Neve leſſum funeris ergô habento]
for that word was often ingeminated in their mourning as
a dolefull eiulation, or note of inward ſorrow. This ſorrowing
or mourning was in ſome caſes vtterly prohibited, in
others limited;Alex. Gen. dier. lib. 3. c. 7. Namely an infant dying before hee was
three yeares old, ſhould not be mourned for at all; becauſe
hee had ſcarcely yet entered into his life. Neither might
children mourne for their fathers, or wiues for their huſbands
any longer then ten monthes, within which time
without ſpeciall diſpenſation or licence, it was not lawfull
for the widdow to marry another husband. Here we may
with Raeuardus obſerue a diſtinction betweene lugere and
Elugere. Lugere ſignified no more then to mourne ſome
part of the time preſcribed; Elugere to mourne the whole
and full time.

of ſome pontifie, ſome Augur, ſome Flamen, or
him that was called Rex ſacrorū, or for the making of their
wils &amp; teſtaments were called Calata comitia. Whence the
will that was made in theſe aſſemblies was called Teſtamentum

called Centuriae; or by wards, called Tribus. The
firſt ſort of aſſemblies they called comitia Curiata, the ſecond
comitia Cēturiata, the laſt comitia Tributa.

                        ner
of their proceedings in propounding caſes vnto the aſſemblies.
Philip. Beroaldus in orat. Phil. 11. The cuſtome was at firſt, that the Romanes
ſhould beſtow their ſuffrages Viuâ voce, but afterward
that every one might with freer libertie giue his voice,
they commanded certaine wooden tables, wherein the

names of thoſe that ſtood for offices were written, to bee
caried about, every ſuffrager receaving ſo many tables, as
there were ſuitors: then did the people giue backe that table
with whom they would ſuffrage. But if a law were to
be enacted, thē every ſuffrager receaued two tables, in the
one or which were written theſe two great letters V. R; in
the other was written a great Romane A. Thoſe who delivered
theſe tables vnto the people, did ſtand at the lower
end ofVid. pag. 13. thoſe bridges (which were erected vp for the ſuffragers
to aſcend vnto the ovilia) whence they were called à


diribendo .i. from diſtributing Diribitores. At the other end
of the bridges were placed certaine cheſts or little coffers,
into which the ſuffragers which did approue the law did
caſt in the firſt table; thoſe that diſliked it, did caſt in the
ſecond: for by thoſe two letters V. R. which were written
in the firſt, is meant Vti Rogas .i. Be it as thou haſt asked,
this word Fiat being vnderſtood. By A. in the ſecond table
was meant Antiquo .i. I forbid it, the word ſignifying, as
much as antiquum volo; I like the old law, I loue no innovations.
The tables being thus caſt into the cheſts, certaine
men appointed for that purpoſe in manner of Scrutators
(they called them Cuſtodes, and ſometimesPlin. l. 33. cap 2. 
                        Nongenti) did
take the tables out of the cheſts, and ſo number the voices
by making ſo many points or pricks in a void table, as they
found tables alike: which kind of accounting occaſioned
theſe and the like phraſes; Suffragiorum punctanō tulit ſeptem,
and Omne tulit punctum; where punctum is vſed for ſuffragium.
The voices being thus numbred, it was pronounced
by the common cryer what was decreed. Becauſe the
vſe of thoſe tables is now growne quite out of vſe, I ſhall
make bold to inſert that, which with much labour I haue
collected out of ſeverall autors touching theſe tables. It is
certaine that a long time the vſe of paper was not known,
whence men were wont to write ſometimes vpon the inward
rinds of trees, called in Latine Libri (ſo that to this
day we call our bookes Libri, becauſe in olde time they

were made of thoſe rinds of trees:) ſometimes they did
write in great leaues made of that ruſh Papyrus, growing
in Aegypt, from which we haue derived our engliſh word
Paper, and the latine word Papyrus, now ſignifying our
writing paper; but the Romans at this time did vſe to write
in tables of wood, covered with wax, called in latine ceratae
tabulae. They wrote their wills and teſtaments in tables,

were covered, cera is often vſed in the ſame ſenſe, as Haeredes
primae cerae .i. primae tabulae &amp; in primo gradu instituti; by
which words I think are vnderſtood ſuch heires asAlex. Gen. dier. l. 1. c. 1.

grounds doth thinke that Tully doth vnderſtand by Haeredes
ſecundi, ſuch heires as were nominated to ſucceed the
chiefe heire or heires if they died. They wrote their accounts
in tables, hence Tabulae accepti &amp; expenſi, ſignifying
reckoning books. They wrought their ſtatutes alſo in tables,
whence Tabulae publicae, are engliſhed ſtatute books,
or rather bookes of record. Thoſe writings or inſtruments

letters in tables, inſomuch that tabellae are expounded

carier of tables, is now vſed to ſignifie a letter-carier.Fr. Sylv. in orat. Catilin. 3. The
manner how they ſealed their letters was thus: they did
bind another table vnto that, wherein the inditement was,

whence from them we doe at this day call our bookes codices
à caudicibus, caudex ſignifying properly the truncke,
or ſtocke of a tree, whereof theſe tables or bookes were
made. We muſt note withall that they wrote not with inck
or quill, but with an inſtrument of ſteele or yron, having
Vid. Eraſm. Adag. a ſharpe point at the one end, and being broad, yet keene
and well edged at the other: with the ſharpe point they did
write what they pleaſed, with the broad ende they did
ſcrape out what they had written: whence ſtylum invertere
is to ſay and vnſay a thing, to turne his punch the wrong
end downeward, as it were to ſcrape out that which one
had formerly written. And as wee vſe this word Manus to
ſignifie the writing it ſelfe, according to that ofCic. orat. contra Catil. 
                        Tully,
cognovit manum, &amp; ſignum ſuum: ſo in the like ſenſe we vſe
this word ſtylus, to ſignifie the peculiar tenure or ſtraine
of phraſe, which any man obſerveth in the compoſing of
an oratiō, epiſtle, or ſuch like; in which ſenſe Tully vſeth it
as the antithetō

vſeth it to ſignify, if not a ſword yet a pocket dagger, as Etſi
meus ille ſtylus fuiſſet;
                        Mic. Toxita in orat. Philippic. 2. in which place stylus doth ſignifie
as much as pugio. Now that wee may returne to the matter
whence we haue digreſſed, wee will proceed to ſhew the
maner how they enacted their laws. Al the Romans had not
power and autority of preferring a law, but onely eight of
their magiſtrates which they called Magiſtratus maiores:
namely the Praetor, the Conſuls, the Dictator, the Interrex,
the Decemviri, the military Tribunes, the Kings, and the
Triumviri, vnto theſe eight was added one of thoſe whom
they called Magiſtratus minores, namely the Tribunus
Plebis. If any of theſe Magiſtrates thought it fit to preferre
a law, then did he firſt write it downe at home, and conſult
with ſome lawyer, whether or no it might be for the good
of the common wealth, whether it would not weaken anie

former law, or whether it was not formerly included in
ſome other law, &amp;c. Theſe and many other cautions were
to be conſidered, before it was preferred, yea ſome would
haue the approbation of the whole Senate after the adviſe
of their lawyer, though diverſe times that hath been omitted.
And the lawyer alone allowing it, the law was hanged
vp publiquely in the market place for the ſpace of three
market-daies, which kinde of publiſhing the law was tearmed
Legis Promulgatio quaſi provulgatio, during which
time of promulgation, reaſons were alledged pro &amp; con: by
the ſpectators: and all the people had ſo much time to conſult
of the conveniency thereof, and every one vpon iuſt
reaſon, had free liberty to admoniſh him that preferred the
law, either to amend it, or to ſurceaſe the propoſeall. After
the third Market-day, (for vnleſſe it were vpon an extraordinary
occaſiō, no aſſembly might be called vpon a market-day,
becauſe of the country folks buſineſſes, they alſo
having freedome of ſuffraging) the magiſtrate did convocate,
the people to that place where the law was to be propoſed:
there the Towneclarke or notary reading the law,
the common cryer proclaimed it, then did he which promulged
it make an oration vnto the people, perſwading
them that it might paſſe. Sometimes others of his friends
would ſecond him with orations in his behalfe, as likewiſe
others that diſliked it, would by orations diſſwade the people,
ſhewing the inconveniency thereof. After the orations
had been ended, an vrne or pitcher was brought vnto certaine
Prieſts there preſent, into which were caſt the names
of the tribes, if the comitia were tributa, or of the centuries
if they were centuriata, or of the pariſhes if curiata: then
ſortibus aequatis .i. the lots being ſhakē togither, they drew
their lots; and that tribe or centurie whoſe name was firſt
drawn, was called Tribus vel Cēturia praerogativa, à praerogando,
becauſe they were firſt asked their voices: that curia
vpon which the firſt lot fel, was calledRoſin. antiq. lib. 6. c. 7 
                        Principium, becauſe
that curia did firſt ſuffrage. Thoſe Tribes vpō whom

the other lots fel, namely the ſecond, third, fourth, &amp;c: were
tearmed Tribus Iurevocatae. From this diſtinction it is that
ſuch a man as hath the voices of the praerogatiue tribe, or
century, is ſaid to haue
                           
                              〈…〉
                           
                         
                        Omen praerogativum: which good
fortune whoſoever could attaine vnto, was in great hope
of obtaining the other voices of the Iurevocatae; for they
never or very ſeldome would ſwarue from the determination
of the prerogatiue tribe or centurie. Whiles the people
were buſie in their lottery, in the mean time if any
                           
                              〈…〉

he might be heard, &amp; the whole aſſembly therevpō
ſhould bee diſmiſſed: likewiſe they were diſmiſſed if either
he which firſt promulged the law did alter his opiniō, or if
the conſul commaunded ſupplications to bee offred vp in
the behalfe of their Emperour, or any of thoſe holy daies
called Feriae Latinae vel Imperativae to bee obſerved vpon
that day; or if any of the people aſſembled were taken with

the aſſemblies were diſſolved by reaſon of the ſoothſayings,
which kinde of diſſolution was cauſed either by the
civill magiſtrate his obſerving of ſignes and tokens in the
heaven, and that was called Spectio, and ſometimes de coelo
obſervatio; the very act of this obſervation, though no vnlucky
token did appeare diſſolved the aſſembly: or elſe it
was cauſed by the Augures, and civill magiſtrate promiſcuouſly,
whenſoever any evill token was ſeene or heard either
by the magiſtrate or Augur (amongſt which thunder
was alwaies counted the vnluckyeſt) at which time the aſſemblies
were in like maner to be diſſolved: this maner of
diſſolution was tearmed obnunciatio or Nunciatio.

of concluſiō vnto this tract, adde a iuſt difference to be obſerved

between theſe phraſes, Promulgare, Rogare, Ferre, et
Figere legem. Promulgare legem was to hang vp a law not
yet asked, to the publique view of the people, to be examined
by them touching the conveniencie thereof. Rogare
legem was to vſe a certaine oration vnto the people, to perſwade
the conveniencie of the law, which oration becauſe
it began with this forme of words, Velitis, iubeatisnè Quirites?
.i. O yee Romanes is it your wil and pleaſure that this
law ſhall paſſe or no? Hence was it tearmed legis rogatio.
Ferre legē
                         was when the law had beene approved of by the
people, then to write it downe vpon record, and ſo to lay it
vp into the treaſure-houſe;Fr. Maturā

                     De Comitijs Curiatis.
                     
                        COmitia curiata were thoſe, wherin the Romane people
being divided into thirty pariſhes did giue their
ſuffrages: they were ſo called from curia ſignifying
a pariſh. And vntill Servius Hoſtilius his time, who did firſt
inſtitute the comitia centuriata, all things which were determined
by the ſuffrages of the people, were determined
by theſe curiata comitia: But after the other two ſortes of
aſſemblies had beene eſtabliſhed, theſe curiata were vſed
onely either for the enacting of ſome particular lawes, or
for the creating of ſome certaine prieſts called Flamines.
For the better vnderſtanding hereof we muſt remēber, that

though at firſt theſe thirty pariſhes were parts of the three
Tribes (each tribe being divided into ten pariſhes,) yet in
proceſſe of time the encreaſe of the Romane people was
ſuch, that a great part of the Romane fields were filled with
buildings &amp; places of habitation, inſomuch that the tribes
of the Romanes were encreaſed to thirty fiue: but the pariſhes
(becauſe none that dwelt out of the citty were tied to
the rites and ceremonies of the Romane religion) did not
encreaſe, ſo that the pariſhes did not alwaies remaine parts
of the tribes. Hence it followeth that all the Romanes had
not power to ſuffrage in theſe aſſemblies, but thoſe alone,
who dwelt within the city: for no other could be of anie
pariſh. The place where theſe aſſemblies were held, was the
great hal of iuſtice called from theſe aſſemblies Comitium.
Before theſe aſſemblies were held, it was required that
ſome lawfull magiſtrate for ſome competent time before
hand ſhould ſolemnely proclaime them, and the thirtie ſerjants
(each pariſh hauing for that purpoſe his ſerjant)
ſhould call the people together; as likewiſe three Augures
or at leaſt one ſhould bee preſent to aſſure them by their
obſervatiōs, either of the favor or diſpleaſure of the Gods.
Vpon theſe premiſes the matter was propoſed vnto the
people, who if they liked it, thē they proceeded vnto their
election; if otherwiſe they diſliked it, then did the Tribunus
plebis intercedere .i. forbid their proceedings: wherevpon
their aſſemblies were preſently diſſolved.

                     De Comitijs Centuriatis.
                     AS thoſe former aſſemblies were called Curiata à curijs,
ſo were theſe called Centuriata à Centurijs. Servius
Tullius cauſed a generall valuation of every citizens
eſtate throughout Rome, to be taken vpō record together
with their age: and according to their eſtates and
age, he divided the Romanes into ſix great armies or bands
which he called Claſſes; though in truth there were but fiue

of ſpeciall note: the ſixt contained none but the poorer
ſort and thoſe of no worth or eſteeme. The valuation of
thoſe in the firſt Claſſis was not vnder two hūdred pounds,
and they alone by way of excellency were termed Claſſici:
and hence figuratiuely are our beſt and worthieſt authors
called Claſſici ſcriptores, Claſſicall authors. All the others
though they were enrolled in the ſecond, third, or any other
Claſſis, yet were they ſaid to be Infra claſſem. The valuation
of the ſecond band was not vnder ſeuen ſcore
pounds. The valuation of the third was not ſo little as an
hundred pounds; of the fourth not leſſe then forty pounds;
of the fifth not leſſe then twentie fiue pounds. The ſixt contained
the poorer ſort, whom Horace calleth Tenuis cenſus
homines, men of ſmall ſubſtance; and alſo they were called
Proletarij, à munere officio

                            prolis edēdae, as if the only good
that they did to the common weale, were in begetting of
children: and ſometimes they were called Capite-cēſi, that
is ſuch as paid either very little or nothing at all towardes
ſubſidies, but only they were regiſtred among the citizens
as it appeareth bySig. de Rom lib. 1. cap. 4. 
                        Sigonius. Theſe ſix great bands or armies
were ſubdivided into hundreths called in Latine Cē
                           turiae.
The firſt Claſſis contained foureſcore centuries of
footmen, and eighteene of horſemen: the ſecond contained
twentie centuries of footmen, and two of workemen,
which followed after to make military engins &amp; weapons:
the third alſo, as likewiſe the fourth contained twentie cē
                        turies
of footmen, but to the fourth were added two other
centuries of trumpeters, drummers, and ſuch like, who vpon
iuſt occaſion did Claſſicum canere, ſound the alarme and
vpon iuſt occaſion did againe receptui canere, ſound the retrait:
the fifth Claſſis contained thirtie centuries of footemen:
the ſixt or laſt Claſſis contained one centurie: ſo that
in all the ſix Claſſes were contained one hundred foureſcore
and thirteene centuries. Where we muſt note that al
the centuries of footmen did conſiſt the one halfe in every
Claſſis of the younger ſort, who were to make war abroad

vpon the enimies; the other halfe of old men, who remained
at home for the ſafety of the citie. All that hath beene
hitherto ſpoken of theſe Centuriata comitia, may be collected
out of Sigonius in the place aboue quoted. The chiefe
cōmander of every centurie was called Centurio; the rod or
tip-ſtaffe, wherewith he did ſtrike his ſouldiers to keep thē
in aray, was called by Pliny, Centurionum vitis. So then we
may perceaue, that thoſe Centuriata comitia were thoſe,
wherein the people did giue their voices by centuries, or
hundreds. Now the cēturies did not conſiſt of thoſe alone
which had their places of habitatiō at Rome, but of certaine
Municipall ſtates alſo, &amp; ſuch colonies or other ſtates, that
couldRoſin. Ant lib. 6. cap. 10. 
                        Plenum civitatis ius cū iure ſuffragij adipiſci.
                        Roſin. antiq. Rom, lib. 6. c. 16. Now
the cuſtome in old time was, that al theſe centuries ſhould
march in their armour after the magiſtrate which aſſembled
them, into the Campus Martius, there to giue their
voices. But this cuſtome continued not long, for thereby
they did diſarme the citie, and giue their enimies (if any
ſhould aſſayle them in time of their aſſemblies) the greater
advātage: for their greater ſecuritie therfore, they appointed
a flagge to bee hanged out vpon the mount Ianiculus,
ſome few armed men ſtanding there in watch &amp; ward for
the ſafegard of the citie: and when the aſſembly was to bee
diſſolved, then did the watch depart, and the flag was takē
downe: neither could any thing after that bee determined;
but if they cōtinued their aſſemblies, then did they proceed
to the giuing of their voices, in old time thus. Thoſe cēturies
of the firſt Claſſis being the wealthier had the prerogatiue
of ſuffraging firſt, and becauſe this firſt Claſſis contained
more centuries then all the reſt, therefore, if they could
agree among themſelues, the other centuries were never
asked their voices. This kind of ſuffraging being ſomwhat
partiall in as much as the richer and wealthier being placed
in the firſt Claſſis did overſway the elections againſt
the poorer ſort of people; thence did the after ages appoint
that that cētury ſhould haue the prerogatiue of ſuffraging

firſt, vpon whom the lot fell. The other centuries were all
calledRoſin. antiq Rom. lib. 6. c. 20. 
                        Centuriae Iurevocatae, and did giue their voices not
by lots (as the Tribus Iurevocatae did) but the elder and
wealthier centuries did ſuffrage next after the prerogatiue
centurie, accordingly as their place required.

                     De Comitiis Tributis.
                     FOR the better vnderſtanding of theſe aſſemblies by
Tribes or wards, it will bee needfull firſt to learne, that
this word Tribus in this place doth ſignifie a certaine region,
ward, or locall place of the citie, or the fields belonging
therevnto according to that,A. Gel. l. 15. cap. 27. 
                        Tributa comitia erant cùm
ex regionibus &amp; locis ſuffragabantur. It was ſo called either
à tributo dando every ſeveral region or quarter paying ſuch
a tribute; or quia primò tres tantùm fuerunt, the whole citie
being at firſt divided only into three regions, or wardes,
each nationall tribe having his ſeuerall region or locall
tribe to dwell in. The firſt nationall tribe called Ramnenſes
did in habit the mount Palatine, and the mount Coelius, &amp;
thoſe two hills made the firſt locall tribe. The ſecond nationall
tribe called Tatienſes did inhabite the Capitoll, and
the Quirinall mountaine, which two mountaines made the
ſecond locall tribe. The third nationall tribe did inhabite
the plaine betweene the Capitoll and the Palatine hill, and
that plaine was called the third locall tribe. Of theſe tribes
more is ſpoken in theVid. pag. 22. firſt diviſion of the Romane people.
Only here we muſt note thus much, that in proceſſe of time
after the citie was enlarged, and the number of the Roman
citizens encreaſed, theſe locall tribes were alſo augmēted,
ſo that they amoūted at the laſt to the number of 35. ſome
of them being called Vrbanae, others Rusticae;

                        Vrbanae ab
vrbis regionibus, Ruſticae ab agri partibus erant nuncupatae.
And of theſe two ſorts the Tribus ruſticae were accounted
the more honourable. Moreover wee muſt remember, that
a man might be reputed of this or that tribe, although hee

had no place or habitation therein. Concerning the place
where theſe Tributa comitia were had, ſometime they fell
out to be in the Campus Martius; ſometimes in their great
hall of iuſtice called Comitium; ſometimes in the Capitoll;
many times in other places, according to the diſcretion of
the magiſtrate which cauſed theſe aſſemblies.

many voices as the law doth require. The ſecond ſignifieth

not ſo many as the law requireth.

they might the eaſier procure the good will of the people,
Roſin. Ant. Rom. l. 7. c. 8 theſe foure things were expected from them. Firſt Nomenclatio,
the ſaluting of every citizen by his name; for the
better diſcharge of which, they had a certaine follower,
which ſhould, by way of prompting, tell every citizens
name as he paſſed by, and hence this prompter was ſometimes
called Nomenclator, which word doth properly ſignifie
a common crier in a court of Iuſtice, ſuch as call men
to their appearance, whence they had their name from Nomen
&amp; calo, an old latin word to call; ſometimes Monitor;
ſometimes Fartor ab infarciendo in aures. Secondly, Blanditia,
that is, a friendly compellation by the addition of
ſome complementall name, as well met friend, brother, father,

&amp;c. Thirdly, Aſſiduitas, that is, an hote canvaſing or
ſoliciting men without intermiſſion. Laſtly, Benignitas, a
bountifull or liberall largeſſe, or dole of mony called Cōgiarium
from the meaſure Congius containing a gallon, becauſe

                        WE being to treate of the Romane magiſtrates
will firſt ſee what the definition of a magiſtrate
is. A magiſtrate is heSig. de iur. Rom. l. 1. c. 20. who receiveth
by publique autority the charge and overſight
of humane affaires belonging to the
commō wealth. Theſe Romane magiſtrates
were either to be choſen only out of the better ſort of Romanes,
called the Patricij; or elſe onely out of the commonalty.
Sig. de iure Provinc. l. 3. cap. 1. The firſt were thence called Magiſtratus patricij,
the ſecond Magiſtratus plebeij. The Patricij had power to

                     De Rege &amp; Tribuno Celerum.
                     IN the infancie of Rome, it was governed by a king vntill
Tarquinius Superbus his time, who by maintaining that
ſhamefull act of his ſonne towards Lucretia did ſo incenſe

the people, that they did not only for the preſent exile
him, but decreed that their city ſhould never after that
be governed by a king. This king had abſolute rule &amp; governement
over the city. For the ſafety of his perſon he had
three hundred choſen young men alwaies to be attendant
about him, much like vnto our kings Maieſties Guard here
in England, or rather his Penſioners. They were calledPlutarch. in Romulo. 
                        Celeres
à celeritate, from their readines in aſſiſtance: ſometimes
they were called Troſſuli,
                        Plin. lib. 33. cap. 2. becauſe they alone without
the helpe of any foote-men did take a certaine city in
Etruria called Troſſulum. Other times they haue beene called
Flexumines, wherof as yet there hath beene no certaine
reaſon rendred. Each hundred of them had their ſeverall overſeer
called Centurio: and over them al there was one generall
overſeer and chiefe commaunder, whom they called
Praefectum vel Tribunum Celerum, his place being next to
the king. A ſecond ſort of attendants about the king were
called Lictores à ligando, according to that, Lictor colliga
manus. They did ſomewhat reſemble our Serjants there being
in number twelue of them. Their office was to carie
certaine bundles of birchen rods with an axe wrapped vp
in the middeſt of them: the rods in latin were called Faſces,
the axe Securis.
                        Ioac. Camerarius in orat pro Flacco. The reaſon why they carryed both axes
and rods was to intimate the different puniſhment that be
longed vnto notorious and petty malefactors. The reaſon
why they were wrapped vp togither was not onely that
they might be thereby more portable,Immedicabile vulnus Enſe recidatur &amp;c. but that the anger
of the magiſtrate might be ſomewhat allayed, whiles they
were vnbinding. Hence becauſe theſe Faſces virgarum &amp;
ſecurium, did betoken honour and chiefedome in place &amp;
autority, by the figure ſynecdoche this word hath beene vſed
to ſignifie honour and dignity, as Faſcibus ſuis abrogatis,
he being diſcharged of his magiſtracie or dignity.

them, and the diſtinction of them into Senatores maiorum

as likewiſeSup. p. 24. in the third diviſion hath been ſhewne the
habit or gowne, by which the Senators were diſtinguiſhed
from the Romane gentlemen. Here therefore it ſhall be ſufficient
for vs to vnderſtand, that every ſolemne meeting or
conſiſtory of theſe Senators was called Senatus. The foreman
of them (which could bee no other then ſuch as had
been either Conſul or Cenſor, was called Princeps Senatus,
and his opinion was alwaies firſt asked. Now among thoſe
that had borne thoſe foreſaid offices it was in the Cenſors
power to make whom he would fore-man. The decree of
this conſiſtory was called Senatus-conſultum. And manie
times it is written with theſe two letters onely S. C. The
place where this cōſiſtory was had they called Senaculum.

holding vp or beckning with their hands what ſide they
would take. Now if the maior part were eaſie to be diſcerned,

King, all the citizens in Rome aſſembled, and concluded
that the government of their city, which before
was in the hand of one alone governour, called their
King, ſhould now bee divided betweene two:Roſin. ant. Rom. l. 7. c. 9. whom at

the Romanes called Praetores, quod praeirent populo.

which was the reaſon that Iulius Caeſar was glad to forgoe
his triumph at that time, when hee was Conſul with
Bibulus. The ſignes or tokens of this Conſular dignitie
were the twelue Lictors carying their bundles of rodds &amp;
axesAlex. Gen. dier. lib. 3. c. 3. the firſt month before one Conſul, &amp; the ſecond before
the other; as formerly they had done before their
Kings.Feneſt. de magiſt. Rom. The reaſon why each Conſul had not twelue Lictors
alwaies, was becauſe the tyranny of the Conſuls might
then ſeeme to be doubled and to exceed the tyranny of the
Kings: another token was a certaine chaire of eſtate called
Sella

whereof it was made, andA. Gell l. 3. cap. 18. becauſe this chaire was commonly
caried about in a certaine coach or chariot, wherein

a chariot, it is alſo called Sella curulis: whereStadius i

                            Flor. l. 1. c. 5. note that
this word Curulis is ſometimes vſed ſubſtantiuely, &amp; then
it ſignifieth ſome chiefe magiſtracy or office amongſt the
Romanes. The gowne, by which they were diſtinguiſhed
from other magiſtrats or private men, was a certaine purple
gowne, which from the great embroadred workes was
called Trabea, and hee that did weare it was thence called
Trabeatus, according to that, Trabeati cura Quirini. It will
be worthy our obſervation to note, that the Romanes did
date their deeds and charters in old time by naming the
yeare wherein their citie was firſt founded; as to ſay Abvrbe
condita the twentieth, thirtieth, or fortieth yeare, &amp;c.
But in proceſſe of time their manner of dating was by ſubſcribing
the names of their preſent Conſuls: as to ſay, ſuch a
thing was determined L. Valerio, M. Horatio Conſulibus,
ſuch and ſuch being Conſuls. Whence Suetonius ſpeaking
of Iul. Caeſar, ſaith, he was appointed to be Flamen Dialis,
ſequentibus conſulibus .i. the next yeare following. Thoſe
alone who had borne the office of a Conſul, not every one
that was capeable thereof were ſaid to be

The reaſon of this chaſme, or interim betweene their deſignation

haue ſome time to enquire de Ambitu .i. whether there was
no vndirect and vnlawful meanes vſed in their canvaſſing.

                     THE Conſuls finding themſelues encombred with ſo
many buſineſſes of a different nature, did by conſent
of the Senate chooſe two peculiar officers called
Feneſt. de Magiſt. Rom. cap. 17. 
                        Cenſores à cenſendo; becauſe they ceſſed and valued every
mans eſtate, regiſtring their names, and placing them in a
fit century. For it did concerne the Romanes to knowe the
number, and likewiſe the wealth of their people, to the end
they might be informed of their owne ſtrength, &amp; ſo ſhape
their courſe accordingly, either in vndertaking warres,
tranſplanting Colonies, or in making proviſion of victuals
in time of peace. A ſecond and maine part of their office
was in reforming manners to which end they had power
to enquire into every mans life. This part of their autoritie
was noted out vnto vs by this phraſe being called Virgula
cenſoria. If any one had plaied the ill husband, &amp; neglected
his farme, or left his vine vntrimmed, the Cenſors tooke notice
thereof. They did Senatu &amp; Tribu movere .i. They did
depoſe Senatours, and pull downe men from a more honorable

Tribe to a leſſe honourable. They did puniſh Capitis

                     THe Conſuls by reaſon of their many troubles in war,
having no time to adminiſter iuſtice vnto the Romane
people, did for their better help therein create
two new officers for the executing of iuſtice, the one to
examine and iudge of matters within the city between citizen,
and citizen; the other to decide controverſies betweene
forreiners: The firſt theyPighius aequipet. comp called Praetorem vrbanum,
and Praetorem maiorem; the other Praetorem peregrinū,
&amp; Praetorem minorem: we may engliſh them Lord-chiefe-Iuſtices.
Where we muſt note that at the firſt there was only
the Praetor Vrbanus, vntill the caſes and ſuits in law became
ſo many, that one was not ſufficient to heare them
all:Alex. Gen. dier. l. 2. c. 15. yea at laſt the number of the Praetors came to ſixteene:
namely when thoſe two were added for the providing of
corne and graine: whence they were called Praetores cereales;

Conſuls; afterward by certaine appointed therevnto by the
people, being called from their inquiſition quaeſitores parricidij.
In continuance of time the examination and hearing
of theſe publique caſes was turned over vnto certaine magiſtrates,
who becauſe they were to continue their office a
full and entire yeare (whereas the others had their authoritie
no longer then they ſate in iudgement) were thence for
diſtinction ſake called Praetores Quaeſitores, and the caſes
were tearmed Quaestiones perpetuae:
                        Roſin. antiq. lib. 7. c. 11 becauſe in theſe caſes
there was one ſet forme of giving iudgement perpetuallie
to remaine; wheras in thoſe private or civil cauſes the Praetor
did commonly every yeare change the forme of giving
iudgement by hanging vp new edicts.Roſin Ant lib. 6. cap. 18. Here we muſt note
that theſe Quaeſitores Parricidarum, otherwiſe called Praetores
Quaeſitores, had not the examination of all publique
caſes, but ſometimes vpon extraordinary occaſions either
the Conſuls, the Senate, or the people themſelues would
giue iudgement. Now as thoſe former Praetors had a ſpeare
erected vp, whereby their court for private cauſes was
knowne; ſo had theſe Quaeſitores a ſword hanged out in token
of their court.Sig. de iud. lib. 1. cap. 7. 
                        Praetorum inſignia duo fuere, haſta, &amp;

The officers which did attend theſe Praetors were
Scribae .i. certaine notaries much reſembling the Clearkes
of our Aſſiſes, their offices being to write according as the
Praetors or chiefe Iuſtices did bid them, taking their name

their appearance. They much reſembled our bayleiffes errant.
The third ſort were lictores, of which before:Feneſt. de Rom. magiſt. cap. 19. The authority

following. And vnleſſe the people might be ignorāt of the
contents thereof, he cauſed it to be hanged vp to the publique

place now quoted doth tranſlate conſulum edicta, Mandatory
letters, that it might be diſtinguiſhed from other magiſtrates

And as Pighius obſerveth in the place aboue quoted, it
was called edictum perpetuum; not abſolutely, becauſe the

                        Salvius Iulianus collected an Edict
out of all the old edicts of the former Praetors, wherein almoſt
all the whole civill law was contained and this was
called properly Edictum perpetuū, becauſe that all the Praetors
ever after did adminiſter iuſtice according to that Edict
by the appointment of Hadrianus being then Emperour.
The edict being given out, the adminiſtration of iuſtice
conſiſted in the vſe of one of theſe three words, Do,
Dico, &amp; Addico .i.I. Camerar. in Cic. orat. pro. Flacco. 
                        Dat actionem, Dicit ius, Addicit tā res,
quàm homines. For explanation whereof we muſt knowe,
that this worde Addico is ſometimes verbum Augurale,
ſometimes Forenſe, ſometimes a tearme of art belonging
vnto the diſcipline of the Augures, and ſo the birds are ſaid
Addicere, when they ſhew ſome good and lucky token,
that the matter conſulted about is approved by the Gods;
the oppoſite herevnto is Abdicere. Sometimes this verbe
Addico is a tearme of law ſignifying asM. Toxita in orat. pro Pub. Quint. much as to deliver

vp into ones hands, or into ones poſſeſſion: whence we
doe not onely call thoſe goods that are delivered by the
Praetor vnto the right owner Bona addicta, but thoſe debtors
alſo which are delivered vp by the Praetor vnto their
creditors to worke out their debt, are tearmed ſervi Addicti:
yea moreover becauſe in all port-ſales it was neceſſary
that the Praetor ſhould Addicere bona deliver vp the goods
ſold: hence doth this word often ſignifie to ſell, as Addicere
ſanguinem alicuius, to take mony to kill a man, to ſell a
mans life. Touching the reaſon of their name they were
called Praetores à praecundo, quoniā iure prae

                     VVHen C. Iulius Caeſar had overcome Pompey his
ſonnes in Spaine, at his returne to Rome the Senate
welcomed him with new invented titles of ſingular
honour, ſtyling him Pater patriae, Conſul in decennium, Dictator
in perpetuum, Sacro ſanctus and Imperator: all which
titles were afterward conferred vpon Octavius Caeſar; and
all the Emperours ſucceeding deſired to be called Imperatores
&amp; Caeſares from him. Where we muſt vnderſtand that
this name Imperator was not altogether vnknown before,
for by that name the Romane ſouldiers were wont (even at
that time) to ſalute their L. Generall after ſome ſpecial cō
                        queſt.
Servius Aen. lib. 6. Theſe Romane Emperours were afterward called
alſo Auguſti from Octavius Caeſar whom when the Senate
ſtudyed to honour with ſome noble title, ſome were of
minde that he ſhould be called Romulus, becauſe he was in
manner a ſecond founder of the city. But it was at length
decreed by the adviſe of Manutius Plancus, that he ſhould
be ſtyled by the name of Auguſtus: which we may Engliſh
Soueraigne, and they counted this a name of more reverence

and maieſtie then that former name of Romulus,
becauſe all conſecrated and hallowed places were called
Loca auguſta. The authoritie of theſe Emperours was very
great, even as great as the Kings in former times.

Emperour of Germany, and ſo hath beene continued by his

called Rex Romanorum, who ſhould be ſo farre inveſted in
the title to the Empire by the meanes of the preſent Emperour,
that vpon the death, reſignation, or depoſition of
the then being Emperour, he immediatly ſhould ſucceed.

                        Romanes
appointed three men, namely thoſe who were reputed
the graveſt and wiſeſt amongſt them to goe to Athens
there to pervſe the Grecian lawes, to the intent that at their
returne, both a ſupply might bee made of thoſe lawes that
were wanting in Rome, and the other which were faultie
might thereby be rectified and amended. At the returne of
thoſe three men, the Conſuls were depoſed, and both their
authority and enſignes given vnto theſe Decemviri. The
lawes which they brought from Athens were written at
firſt in ten tables of braſſe: afterward two other tables were
added. At which time thoſe lawes began to be knowne &amp;
diſtinguiſhed from others by the name of Leges 12 tabularum.
And according to thoſe lawes iuſtice ever after was
adminiſtred to the Romane people. At firſt by theſe ten mē
appointed therevnto, whoſe autority was as large even as
the Kings and Conſuls, in old time only it was annuall: one
of them only had the enſignes of honor caried before thē;
one alone had the authoritie of convocating the Senate,
confirming their decrees and the diſcharge of all ſtate buſineſſes.
Roſin. ant. Rom. l. 7. c. 19 The other did little differ from private mē in their
habit; only when the firſt had ruled a ſet time, the others
ſucceeded by turnes. This kind of government did not
continue long in Rome, for in the third yeare all their power
was abrogated, becauſe of their tyranny and oppreſſion
vſed by them towards the Romane people.

Interreges: where we muſt knowe, that theſe ten did not
rule altogether, but each man ruled for the ſpace of fiue

paſſed through the firſt, then did they goe to lots to haue a
ſecond decury choſen, and ſo a third, &amp;c. This office of an
Interrex remained even in the Conſuls time, ſo that if by
ſome extraordinarie occaſion the Conſuls could not bee
created,Alex. Gen. dier. li. 5. c. 6. then they choſe one to whom alone they committed
the whole governement of the kingdome, and him
they called Interregem.

                     VVHenſoever the Romanes found themſelues encombred
with dangerous warres, or any other
eminent dangers, they preſently choſe a Dictator, to whō
alone was committed the authority and rule of the whole
kingdome, differing from a King onely in reſpect of his
name, &amp; the continuance of his office. Touching his name
he was ſo called, quoniam dictis eius parebat populus. His office
continued but ſix months and at the expiration thereof
if need required he was choſen againe for another ſix
months. He was alſo calledPighius in Tyrannif. 
                        Populi Magister, in as much
as none could make their appeale from him vnto the people.
As ſoone as himſelfe was eſtabliſhed in his office hee
choſe a ſubordinate officer whom he calledStadius in Flor. l. 1. c. 11. 
                        Equitum magiſter:
his authoritie much reſembled his whom they called
Vrbi praefectum: for as the Praefectus vrbi in the abſence of

the abſence of the king, ſo this Magiſter Equitum in abſence
of the Dictator had full and vncontroleable authoritie
of doing what he would.

                     De Tribunis militum.
                     THeſeRoſin antiq. lib. 7. c. 20. military Tribunes were of two ſorts. The one
had all power and authoritie, which beelonged vnto
the Conſuls; and thence were called Tribuni militum
conſulari poteſtate. The occaſion of them was this: The protectors
of the commons called Tribuni plebis did earneſtly
labour that the commonalty might bee made as capeable
of the cōſular dignitie as the Nobility:Roſin. ibid. This was followed
ſo hot that in the end though the nobilitie would not
graunt them way vnto that dignitie vnder the name of
Conſuls; yet in effect they would grant it them. Namely the
Conſuls ſhould be depoſed, and in their ſteed other magiſtrats
ſhould be choſen; part out of the the nobility, part
out of the commonalty, who though they were not
called Conſuls, but Tribuni, yet were they of Conſular authoritie:
By which they were diſtinguiſhed from the other
ſort of Military Tribunes, who had power and authoritie
only in matters military, and were known by the name of
Tribuni militum without any addition.Alex. Gen. dier. lib. 6. c. 18. Sometimes there
was one of theſe 3. words praefixed Rutuli or Rufuli, Suffecti
and comitiati; not therby to intimate vnto vs any diſtinction
of office or place, but to ſignify their manner of election.
For if they were choſen by the Conſuls, then were
they called Tribuni Rutuli or Rufuli, becauſe they had their
authoritie confirmed vnto them by vertue of an act or law
preferred by Rutilius Rufus, when he was Conſul. If they
were choſen by the ſouldiers themſelues in their campe,
then were they called Tribuni fuffecti .i. Tribunes ſubſtituted
or put in the place of another. Whence we may cōiect
that the ſouldiers were not permitted to make any electiō,
but in time of need, when their former Tribunes were taken

from them by ſome violent or vnnaturall death. The
laſt ſort called Comitiati were ſo called becauſe they were
choſen by the Romane aſſemblies called in Latine Comitia.
They were named Tribuni, becauſe at the firſt inſtitution
of them (whether we vnderſtand the Conſular Tribunes or
this latter ſort) there were but three of each. In proceſſe of
time notwithſtanding I find the number not only of thoſe
Conſular Tribunes,
                        Roſin. Ant. lib. 7. cap. 20. but of thoſe other alſo to haue beene
encreaſed to ſix accordingly as the thouſands in a legion
were multiplied. Theſe latter ſort of Tribunes, in reſpect of
their military diſcipline which was to ſee the ſouldiers being
faultie to bee puniſhed, wee may engliſh Knights
Martiall: In reſpect that their authoritie was over footmē
only, we may engliſh them Seriants maior: only this difference
there was, to every thouſand of footmen in any legion;
there were as many military Tribunes vnder their
chiefe commander called Imperator. But in our engliſh armies
there is but one Seriant maior, who alone vnder the
L. Generall hath command over all the footmeen, be there
never ſo many thouſands.

betweene Auguſtus Caeſar, Antonius, &amp; Lepidus.
For theſe three vnder the pretence of revēging
Iul: Caeſar his death obtained chiefe power and authority
for the ſpace of fiue yeares thorough out Rome,

that they would ſettle the common wealth, which at

order. Thoſe fiue yeares being expired, they refuſed to reſigne
their authority, exerciſing exceſſiue cruelty towards
all the Romanes of what degree ſoever.Suet Octa. Aug. cap. 27. This kinde of governement
remained but ten years, neither ever were there
any other then thoſe three aboue named. They had power
to enact any new law, to reverſe any former Act without

the conſent of the Senate, or commons. They might preſcribe
and banniſh any Romane at their pleaſure; and as often

publique Treaſurers, which collecteth the ſubſidies,
cuſtomes, mony, yearely revenues, and all other paiments
belonging to any ſtate or corporation. And hence
Feneſt. de Rom. mag. c. 3. 
                        quoniā publicae pecuniae quaerendae praepoſiti erant, they took
their name Quaeſtores: Sometimes they are called Quaeſtores
Ʋrbani, to diſtinguiſh them from the provinciall Quaeſtors,
which bare office in the Romane provinces: ſomtimes
they are called Quaeſtores aerarij, to diſtinguiſh them from
thoſe that were called Quaeſtores parricidij, or rerum capitalium,
of which you may ſee more in the tract de Praetoribus.

or Clarkes of the band, which did receiue the ſouldiers
pay from theſe city-Treaſurers, and ſo pay it to the
ſouldiers. The office of theſe city-Treaſurers (then being
at firſt but two) was to receiue al the city-accounts; to diſburſe
at all occaſions of publique expenſes; to take an oath
of him that the ſouldiers had ſaluted by the name of Imperator,
that he had truely informed the Senate both of the
number of enimies ſlaine, as alſo of the number of citizens
loſt: otherwiſe he might bar the Emperour of his triumph.
Moreover whatſoever ſpoiles were taken in warre they
were delivered vp vnto theſe citty-Quaeſtors, and they ſelling

Roſin. ant. lib. 7. c. 23. magiſtrats the protection of the commons was committed,
who becauſe they were at firſt choſen out of the Military
Tribunes, therfore did they alwaies retaine the name
of Tribunes, being called that they might be diſtinguiſhed
from the others, Tribuni Plebis, Protectours of the commons.
At the firſt inſtitution of them they were in number
but 2, asPighius in ſuo Tyranni fug. ſome haue thought:Pomp. Laetus. Others ſay fiue: afterward
(as it is yeelded by al writers) they encreaſed vnto tē. Their
autority at firſt conſiſted chiefely in this, that they had power
to hinder any proceedings in the Senate, which they
thought might proue preiudiciall vnto the commons; ſo
that they had not autority to enact any new decrees, as afterward
by abuſing their authority they did.Stadius in Flor. lib. 3. c. 2.

                     VVE may read of three ſorts of Romane magiſtrates
called Aediles; the two firſt had their names ab
aedibus curandis, having in their charge to repaire both temples
&amp; private dwelling houſes which belonged vnto the
city. The firſt ſort were called Aediles curules, â ſella curuli,
from the chaire of ſtate, wherein it was permitted them
to ride; and theſe were choſenPhilet. in l. 2. Cic. epiſt. fam. 10. out of the Senators. The
ſecond ſort were called Aediles plebeij, and they were added
vnto the former at the earneſt ſuit of the cōmons, they
being to be choſen out of them. Where we muſt note that
they were not ſo added that both ſorts ſhould rule at one
&amp; the ſelfe ſame time,Alex. Gen. dier. l. 4. c. 4. but that the Curules ſhould rule the
one yeare, and the Plebeij the other. To theſe Aediles it did
belong, beſide the reparation of temples and private houſes,
to looke vnto the weights &amp; meaſures in cōmon ſale:
for they had power to examine Actiones redhibitorias, that
is, ſuch actions, by vertue of which he that had ſold any
corrupt or ſophiſticated wares, was conſtrained to take
them againe. Moreover they had the charge of the publique
conduits or water conveyances, of proviſion for ſolemne
plaies, &amp;c. Of the third ſort there were alſo two,
who were in a manner Clarkes of the Market.Alex. Gen. Ibid. For vnto
them belonged the looking vnto the victuals ſold in the
market, and corne: Whence they were called by them Aediles
cereales; &amp;Pighius in ſuo tyrannif. by the Greekes

ought that can bee collected out of thoſe that treate of it,
differeth but little from his, whō the Romanes called Annonae
Praefectum; onely this, the Aediles Cereales were magiſtratus
ordinarij; the Praefectus extraordinarius, namely,
Roſin. antiq. l. 7. c. 38. ſuch as was choſē only in time of extraordinary dearths;
he having for that time larger authority then thoſe ordinarie
clarkes of the market. For as it appeareth by Roſinus in
the place now quoted, this Praefectus had power of himſelf

                     De Triumviris.
                     BEſide that Triumviratus Reip: conſtituendae, of which
we ſpake before, there were divers kindes of Triumvirates;
namely Triumviri capitales, three high Shireiffes,
who had the charge of priſons and were to ſee malefactors
puniſhed: for which purpoſe eight Lictors did attend
thē. There were alſoAlex. Gen. dier. l. 3. c. 16. 
                        Triumviri Menſarij, three mē,
we may tearme them Bankers, who had autoritie to pay
out of the common treaſury poore mens debts. Sometimes
there were appointed fiue to this office, whence they were
called alſoI. Camerar. in orat. Cic. pro Flacco. 
                        Quinqueviri Menſarij, both being called Mē
                           ſarij
from Menſa, a table, whereon they told their mony.
Another ſort of Triumviri there were appointed to
preſſe ſouldiers, whence they were called Triumviri conquirendi
iuvenes idoneos ad arma ferenda. Wee read alſo of
certaine Triumviri, which were elected as chiefe captaines
to guid and conduct the people in tranſ
                           •
                        lanting colonies;
and thence were they named Triumviri Coloniae deducendae:
but ſometimes for this purpoſe they elected ſeaven, ten,
or twentie, and ſo named them Quinqueviri, Septemviri,
Decemviri, and 
                           Ʋigintiviri Coloniae deducendae. Three other
ſorts of Triumviri remaine, which were offices of
ſmall account; as the Triumviri monetales, three Maſters

of the Mint, who thence were called Triumviri A.A.A.
F.F. .i. Auro, Argento, Aere, Flando, Feriundo; for they had
the charge of coyning the mony. Secondly, Triumuiri valetudinis,
Three Peſt-men, which were to overſee thoſe
that lay infected with any contagious ſickneſſe. Thirdly,

the towne at night, and to giue notice of fire.

citie to maintaine many bands of ſouldiers, which
ſhould alwaies bee in readineſſe for the defence of
the citie, deſired of the citie an yearly ſubſidie for the maintenance
of thoſe ſouldiers: but being denied it, hee built a
certaine Treaſure-houſe, which hee called Aerarium militare,
whereinto he caſt his mony for himſelfe, &amp; Tiberius;
and promiſed to doe ſo every yeare. Afterward when hee
ſaw the Treaſury not to be enriched enough, either by that
mony which himſelfe beſtowed, or by the contributions
of others, he appointed that the twentieth part of all inheritances
and legacies (except it were to the next of the kin,
or to the poore) ſhould fall vnto this Treaſurie. For the
charge &amp; cuſtody hereof he appointed three of thoſe ſouldiers,
which alwaies attended about him for the ſafegard
of his perſon, calling them Praefectos Aerarij.

                     ALL captaines and governours to whom the rule of
an army belonged were in ancient time calledPancirol. in notitiam imper. orient. cap 5. 
                        Praetores;
This word Praetor ſignifying then three chiefe
officers among the Romanes: Firſt a Conſul; ſecondly a L.
chiefe Iuſtice; thirdly a L. Generall in warre; all of them
being calledPighius in Aequipet. compoſ. 
                        Praetores, quaſi Praeitores qurniam iure &amp; exercitu
praeibant. Anſwerable to which threefold acception

this word Praetorium hath three ſeverall ſignifications:
ſometimes it ſignifieth a Princes palace or manour houſe;
ſometimes a great hall or place where iudgment was wont
to be given; and laſtly the L. Generall his pavilion in the
campe;Aſconius in Verrinam 3. from which laſt ſignification it is that thoſe ſouldiers
that gaue attendance about that pavilion for the gard
of their captaines perſon are ſometimes called Milites
Praetoriani, ſometimes Cohors praetoria;
                        Chriſtr Fr. Sylvius in Catil. 2am. and hee to whom
the overſight of theſe ſouldiers was committed was thence
called Praetorio praefectus.

                     FOR the right vnderſtanding of this office wee muſt
firſt note a difference betweene theſe two wordes,
Aerarium, and Fiſcus. Aerarium was a common treaſury
belonging vnto an whole ſtate or corporation, whēce
all publike and commō expences are to be ſupplied. Fiſcus
was the Kings or Emperors private coffers: it may be engliſhed
the Kings Exchequer. The keeper thereof was called
Advocatus Fiſci. There are many other pettie offices with
in the citie, which I haue purpoſely omitted, becauſe there
is but ſeldome mention of them in old autors; and as oftē
as they are mentioned, their names doe explaine their office.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. 22.
                     De praecipuis magiſtratibus provincialibus.
                     OVer the Provinces at firſt ruled certaine magiſtrats
ſent from Rome by commiſſion from the Romane
Senate, called Praetores, whoſe office was to adminiſter
iuſtice vnto the Provinciall inhabitants: yea, and if
occaſion ſerved, to make warre alſo vpon their enimies; &amp;
this was the reaſon that the number of the Praetors did ſo
increaſe alwaies, namely accordingly as the number of

Provinces did encreaſe. The warres and tumults in the
Provinces ſometimes were ſo great, that the Praetour was
not ſufficient both to manage warre and execute iuſtice:
wherevpon the Senate thought fit to ſend another magiſtrate
into the Provinces, whom they called a Conſul, becauſe
properly the managing of warre belonged vnto the
Conſul. So that there were at firſt two ordinary Provinciall
magiſtrates, a Conſul to manage warre, and
a Praetour, or L. chiefe Iuſtice to ſit in iudgement. And if
theſe two by a ſecond grant from the Senate did continue
in their office aboue the ſpace of an yeare, then were they
called Proconſules, &amp; Propraetores. But in proceſſe of time
this cuſtome was altered. For then none could bee Proconſuls,
but thoſe alone who had beene Conſuls in Rome; neither
could any be Propraetours, which had not beene Praetors
at Rome. Their manner being, that the next yeare after
the expiration of their offices in Rome they ſhould departe
into ſome certaine province to beare the ſame offices againe
being not called Conſules or Praetores as before, but
Alex. Gen. dier. l. 3. c. 3. 
                        Proconſules &amp; Propraetores; and for this cauſe alwaies, ſo
ſoone as the Conſuls had beene created, the Senate did appoint
certaine Provinces for the Conſuls, which being appointed
the Conſuls did either agree between themſelues,
who ſhould go to the one, who to the other; and that was
tearmed comparare provincias; or elſe they did decide the
queſtion by lots, and that was tearmed ſortiri provincias;
howbeit ſometimes the Senate did interpoſe their autority,
and diſpoſe the ſame. Vnder the Emperours the governours
of ſome Provinces were appointed by the Senate, &amp;
the people, and thoſe were called Proconſules, and the Provinces,
I. Camerar. pro L. Flacco 
                        Provinciae Conſulares, others were appointed by
the Emperours, and they were called Propraetores, and the
Provinces Praetoriae Provinciae. For all this, which hath bin
noted touching the Provinciall Magiſtrates, it is almoſt
verbatim tranſlated out ofRoſin. Antiq. l. 10. c. 24. 
                        Roſinus. To which we adde
this, namely that every Proconſul and Propraetor did vſually

chooſe a Lieuetenant ſuch a one as ſhould bee aſſiſtaunt
vnto him in matters of governement,Pomp. Laetus de magiſt. Rom. whom they called
Legatum. So that this word Legatus ſignified three ſeveral
Magiſtrates amongſt the Romanes, two whereof may bee
proved out ofSig. de iure Prou. l. 2. c. 2. 
                        Sigonius; firſt that it ſignified ſuch a Lieuetenant
or L. Deputy vnder a Proconſul or Propraetour in a
Province: ſecondly, that it ſignified ſuch a one as is imploied
in the delivery of a meſſage or embaſſage from one
Prince or State to another: we commonly call them Embaſſadors.
                        Roſin. ant. Rom. l. 10. c. 7. Laſtly it ſignified a Lieuetenant or chiefe captaine
in warre, whoſe place was next vnder the L. General.
Moreover every Proconſul and Propraetour had with them
certaine Treaſurers, called Quaeſtores Provinciales. Theſe
provinciall treaſurersSig. de iure Prov. l. 2. c. 3. were choſen by the Romane people
commonly, namely ſuch a number as the number of Provinces
did require. After the election they between themſelues
did caſt lots who ſhould go vnto the one, who vnto
the other Provinces:Sig. ibid. ſometimes extraordinarily by vertue
of ſpeciall Act or decree this or that ſpeciall man hath
obtained this or that Province without any lottery. By the
way we muſt note, that all Provinciall Quaestors could not
be called Proquaeſtores, as all Provinciall Conſuls and Praetours
were called Proconſules &amp; Propraetores.
                        Roſin. ant. Rom. l. 7. c. 45. For theſe
only were called Proquaeſtores, which did ſucceede theſe
Provinciall Quaeſtors, when they did either die in their office
or depart out of the Province, no ſucceſſor being expected
from Rome: at which times it was lawfull for the
Proconſul or Propraetor to chooſe his Proquaeſtor. Moreover
there were beſide theſe Legati &amp; Quaeſtores
                        Sig. de iure Prov. l. 2. c. 2. other military
officers; ſuch as are the Tribuni militum, Centuriones,
Praefecti, Decuriones, togither with other inferiour officers,
as their Secretaries, Baylieffes, Cryers, Serjants, and ſuch
like.

                        HAving ſpoken of the civill Magiſtrates, wee
will now alſo deſcende vnto the civill law:
where firſt we will note among other differences
betweene Ius and Lex principally
theſe. Firſt Lex ſignifieth only the law, but
Sig. de iud. lib. 1. cap. 7. 
                        Ius ſignifieth alſo that place, whereſoever
the law or iuſtice was adminiſtred; not only if it were adminiſtred
out of the tribunall in the Comitio, or great
hall of Iuſtice, which was tearmed by the lawyers Agere
pro Tribunali: but alſo if it were adminiſtred in a private
houſe, or in ones iourney; ſo that it were by a lawfull Magiſtrate,
and out of the curule chaire; and this was tearmed
by the Lawyers, Agere de Plano: and hence is it, that In ius
vocare ſignifieth to cite one into the court. Secondly Lex
ſignifieth onely the written law, but Ius ſignifieth equitie;
ſo thatFr. Sylv. in orat. pro Mil. 
                        Ius permaneat ſempèr, nec vnquam mutetur: Lex
verò ſcripta ſaepiùs. Notwithſtanding theſe two words are
vſed promiſcuouſly one for the other; &amp; therefore leaving
all curious differences between thoſe words (whether the
Romane lawes were truely Iura or Leges) thus much wee
may obſerue, that the laws vſed among them were of three
ſorts; either they were ſuch as were made by ſeverall Romane
kings, and afterward collected &amp; digeſted into a method
by Papirius,
                        Fr. Sylv. in epiſt. virorū illuſ. l. 5. ep. 1
                              •
                           . from whom it was called Ius Papirianū:
                        
or they were ſuch as the Decemviri brought frō 
                        Athens,
and were called Leges 12 tabularum: or laſtly they were
ſuch as the Conſuls, the Tribuni Plebis, &amp; ſuch Magiſtrates
did preferre, whence every ſeverall law bore the name of
him or them that preferred it. My purpoſe is to explaine only
this latter ſort; and that not all of them, but ſuch alone as
I haue obſerued in Tully, and that chiefly in his orations.
My proceeding ſhall bee firſt to ſhew the divers kindes of
iudgements; and then to deſcend vnto the lawes thēſelues,
beginning with thoſe which ſhall concerne the Romane
religion, and then proceeding to the others, which concerne
the common wealth.

                     De Iure publico &amp; privato.
                     THe Caſes to be decided by the law were either publike
or private; &amp; accordingly were the iudgemēts,
Sig de iure Rom. l. 2. c. 18. 
                        Velprivata, in quibus ius ſuum privatus quiſ
                              
                                 
                              
                              que
                            perſequebatur:
vel publica, in quibus iniuria quae reip. facta erat
vindicabatur. The private (as we obſerved before) belōged
vnto the Praetori vrbano &amp; peregrino .i. the L. chiefe Iuſtices,
who did either giue iudgement themſelues, and then
were they ſaid Iudicare; or they did appoint others to ſit in
iudgement, andSig. de Iud. lib. 1. cap. 7. then were they ſaid Iudicium dare: Yea
in their abſence there were ten called Decemviri Stlitibus
iudicandis .i.Roſin. ant. l. 7. c. 29. 
                        Super lites iudicandas, who in the ſame manner,
as the Praetor, might either giue iudgement thēſelues,
or appoint others; for they were even inAlex. Gen. dier. l. 3. c. 16. one place and in
ſteed of Praetors. Thoſe which either the Praetor or the Decemviri
did appoint to debate the caſes vnder them, were
taken out of the Centumviri .i.Pet. Ramus in 2am de lege Agrar. out of certaine Commiſſioners
choſen for that purpoſe; namely three out of every
Tribe or warde; ſo that in all the number of them amoūted
vnto an hundred and fiue, but in round reckoning they
went for an hundred; and from a certaine ſpeare that was
wont to be erected vp in token of this court, hence was the

                        Sig. de iud. lib. 1. c. 28. Court called either Praetoria Decemviralis, or Centumviralis
haſta. In ſome caſes their forme of acquittance was
thus,Sig. de iud. lib. 1. cap. 29. 
                        ſecundum illum litem do; whenceCic. pro Quin. Roſcio. 
                        Tully ſaith, Quo
minùs ſecundum eos lis detur, non recuſamus .i. wee doe not
deny, but they may be acquitted. Thoſe that were caſt in
their ſuit, were ſaid Lite vel cauſâ cadere. The publique Caſes
belonged ordinarily (except the Conſuls, the Senate, or
the people did interpoſe their authoritie) vnto thoſe whō
we called Praetores Quaeſitores. Some haueRoſin. antiq. lib. 2. c. 18 thought them
to be the ſame with thoſe, whom Roſinus calleth Iudices
Quaeſtionum, and that I thinke not altogether vpon vnſure
grounds: firſt becauſe moſt of theſe publique caſes, which
they tearmed Quaeſtiones, had theirSig. de iud. lib. 2. c. 4. ſeverall Praetors to
enquire them; whence they were called Quaeſitores, &amp; may
in my opinion be called Iudices Quaeſtionū, eſpecially ſeeing
that thoſe which would haue them bee different officers,
cannot well ſhew the difference of their offices. Now
as the Vrbane Praetor had an hundred cōmiſſioners vnder
him: ſo had theſe Praetores Quaeſitores certaine Iudges choſen
Sig. de iud. lib. 2. cap. 6. by the Vrban or forreigne Praetor, when he tooke his
oath, and that not according to his pleaſure as many as hee
would, or whom he would, but ſometimes more, ſomtimes
fewer, ſometimes only out of the Senators, ſometimes only
out of the order of Romane Gentlemen, ſometimes out of
both; ſometimes alſo out of other orders,Sig. ibid. according as
the law appointed, which oftē times varied in thoſe points.
The Iudges how great ſoever the number was,
                           
                              •
                            Sig. de iur. Rom. l. 2. c. 18. were called
Iudices ſelecti, and were divided into ſeverall companies
called Decuriae. Theſe iudges were vpon any citation
frō any of the Praetors, to giue their aſſiſtance in the Court
vpon the day appointed by the Praetor. Now the manner
how they did proceed in their iudgement followeth in the
expoſition of one of the lawes, and therefore I will referre
the reader thither. Only let him by the way vnderſtand,
that whereas Tully is quoted in every law, it is not ſo much
for the proofe of the law, as to ſignifie, that he in that place

maketh mention thereof. For the proofe of the lawes I referre
the Reader to Roſinus and Sigonius: touching the expoſitions
my marginall quotations doe proue ſufficiently.

heretofore the Romane Gentlemen did ſtand promiſcuouſly
with the Commons at their theatrall ſhewes, now there
ſhould bee fourteene benches or ſeats built for thoſe Romane
Gentlemen which were worth H-S. quadringenta .i.

                            of our Engliſh mony. As for other Gentlemē
whoſe ſubſtance was vnder that rate, they had a certaine
place allotted them by themſelues, with a puniſhment impoſed
vpon them, if they offered to come into any of thoſe
14. benches.
                        Here we muſt note that this character H-S ſtandeth for
a ſilver coine in Rome called Seſtertius, and is by Roſinus in
this place improperly vſed for Seſtertium. For this character
H-S is by our Printers falſe printed, the true character
Fr. Matur. in Philip. 2. being LL-S ſignifying duas Libras (as the the two LL
doe intimate) and Semiſſem which is intimated by the
letter S. Where if Libra doth ſignify no more then the Romane
coyne called AS, then is this opinion touching the
character LL-S eaſie to be confirmed. For divers authors

whom they would into the order of Prieſthood: but it

private ſuits in law, or gather vp his debts in that province

imperium retineret, quoad in vrbem reverſus eſſet: whereas
in former times his rule and governement was to be reſigned

Province aboue twelue monthes; nor Procōſull aboue two
yeare. The ſeverall heads or clauſes of his ſecond law could
not all be found out, but thoſe which haue come to light
are theſe. Firſt that Achaia, Theſſalia, and all Graecia ſhould
be free, neither ſhould any Romane Magiſtrate ſit in iudgment

Provinciall governours and their Comites .i. aſſiſtants or
attendants, ſhould haue hay, and all other neceſſaries provided
thē on the way, by thoſe townes &amp; villages through
which they paſſed. (Cic. in Piſon.) Thirdly, that the Provinciall
Magiſtrates at their departure, ſhould leaue a book of
their accounts in two cities of their province, and likewiſe
ſhoulde ſende a coppy of their accounts vnto the Romane

be lawfull for the people to beſtow, nor for the Provinciall
Magiſtrate to receiue Aurum eoronarium vnleſſe it
were in a triumph (Cic. in Piſon.) Laſtly, that it ſhould bee
vnlawful for the Provincial Magiſtrate without the allowance

to lead forth any army, to wage warre, or to go into
any forreigne country. (Cic. in Piſon)

of that phraſe, wee are to vnderſtand the manner of

thus. Thoſe things were rightly ſold in portſale,
which were publikely ſold Per praeconem ſub haſtu .i. by the
cryer vnder a ſpeare ſticked vp for that purpoſe, and ſome
Magiſtrate making good the ſale by delivery of the

ſale was tearmed Auctio; becauſe as Sigonius ſaith in the

                        For the better vnderſtanding of this law, wee muſt note
Sig. de iure Prov. l. 1. c. 1. a threefold tithe paid by the Provinces. The firſt was the
tenth part of the graine, growing in the Province to bee
paid in gratis, and that was properly called Decumae, or frumentum
decumanum, and thoſe that tooke this tithe to rent
were called thence Decumani. A ſecond ſort of tithes was
a certaine quantitie of corne taken vp for the L. Preſident
or chiefe governour of the province to keepe his houſe, &amp;
that was called Frumentum aeſtimatum .i. corne gathered
vp by way of taxation: for ſo this word aeſtimo comming

tithes, was when the Senate finding ſcarcitie of corne in

                           Rome, did inioyne the Provinces to ſell them a quantitie
of corne at a price ſet downe by the Senatours themſelues,
and this corne ſould vpon iniunction, if it was paid but
once in the yeare, it was tearmed Frumentum emptum: but
if in the ſame yeare a ſecond ſale was inioyned them, then
they called that ſecond pay Fr

                        Emancipati deſijſſent eſſe agnati] By the Roman law every
ſonne was in ſuch ſubiection vnto his father, that before
he could bee releaſed of this ſubiection and made free, hee
ſhould by an imaginary ſaleVid leg 12. tabul. be ſold three times by his naturall
father to another man, who was called by the lawyers

againe by the naturall father, and ſo manumiſed by him, &amp;
then he became free. The forme of this kinde of ſale or alienation
is ſet downe more at large in the explanation of
one of the laws that followeth, with an example not much
vnlike this. This imaginary ſale was called Mancipatio; the
children thus alienated from the father were tearmed Emancipati;
this forme of ſetting free was tearmed Emancipatio.

That when any goods did fall vnto a child thus alienated,

by the death of his father, then ſhould not the overſight of
this child fall vnto the next of the kinne tearmed Agnati,
but Quoniam deſiit eſſe agnatus .i. becauſe he had in a manner
loſt his aliance with his kindred, therefore ſhould the
overſight of the child belong vnto the father in truſt, tearmed
Pater fiduciarius, whence the gardianſhip it ſelfe was
called Tutela fiduciaria.

be overſeers appointed for thoſe which were diſtracted,C. 3. de offic. or
did prodigally waſt their patrimonie. For, as it appeareth
by the common adage, Ad agnatos &amp; Gentiles deducendus
eſt,
they did account al prodigals, mad men: they meaning
no more by that, then we do by our engliſh proverb, when
we ſay of a ſpend-thrift: let him be begged for a foole. The
reaſon of their adage was, becauſe if any were diſtracted,
by the Romane law his wardſhip fell Adagnatos &amp; Gentiles

                     BEfore we deſcend vnto the lawes themſelues, we will
explaine thoſe three divers ſorts of wils in vſe amōgſt
the Romanes. Namely Teſtamentum calaris comitijs,
which was ſo called, becauſe twice in the yeare in time of
peace the Romane people aſſembled themſelues together
to this end and purpoſe, that if any would make his will
the whole people might beare witneſſe there vnto: theſe aſſemblies
were tearmed Calata comitia. Secondly Teſtamē
                           tum
in procinctu .i. when a ſouldier in time of warre readie
to giue battle, did call out three or foure of his fellowes, &amp;
in the audience of them did by word of mouth pronounce
his laſt will and teſtament. Thirdly, Teſtamentum per emā
                           cipationem
familiae .i. by making over his goods and poſſeſſions
vnder a fained forme of ſale, vnto a ſecond party called
Haeres fiduciarius &amp; imaginarius .i. an heire in truſt, who

ſhould afterward reſigne them vnto the true and lawfull
heire: and this imaginary kind of ſale, was performed with
certaine ſolemnities circa aes &amp; libram: and alſo the ſale it
ſelfe was ſometimes called Nexus, as likewiſe Emancipatio.
Hence was the will ſometimes called Teſtamentum per
aes &amp; libram, ſometimes Teſtamentum per Nexum. For the
proofe of this, which hath beene delivered, touching the
three ſorts of wills I will referre the reader toSig. de iure Rom. l. 1. c. 12▪

                           Cenſus.] This word Cenſus doth ſometimes ſignifie all
ſuch as haue tendered the iuſt valuation of their eſtate vnto
the Cenſors: and then Incenſus is oppoſite to it, ſignifying
ſuch an one, as hath not tendred his eſtate or name to bee
regiſtred by the Cenſors. But in this place Cenſus is taken
for ſuch a rich man, whoſe eſtate was in the Cenſors booke
valued at one hundred thouſand Seſterces (Ʋid. Aſconium

be heire to more then one quarter of ſuch a rich mans
goods. For the right conceauing of this, we muſt note with

                           Latomus, that the whole inheritance (were it never ſo
great) was tearmed As, and that was divided into twelue
parts which the lawyers called Vnciae: Duae vnciae dicebantur
Sextans; tres quadrās, quatuor Triens, quin

Decunx, vndecim Deunx, Totum As, vt dictum eſt. Againe
every Vncia was divided into ſix parts called Sextulae:
Duae ſextulae Duellam, tres Semunciam faciunt. So thē according
to the lawyers (asAlex. Gen. dier. l. 1. c. 1. 
                           Alexander obſerueth) if there
were one heire alone inſtituted, he was tearmed Haeres in
Aſſem totum inſtitutus; if otherwiſe there were many coheires,
then was it according as the Teſtator did appoint.
Some were ex Deunce haeredes .i. heires to eleven parts of
his goods, there being but one part beſtowed from him:
ſome were haeredes ex quadrante .i. heires to one quarter of
his goods: others were Haeredes ex ſemuncia .i. they had the
foure and twentieth part: others were Sextula aſperſi .i.
they had the threeſcore and twelfe part of the whole As .i.
of the whole inheritance be it more or leſſe, &amp;c. Here wee
muſt vnderſtand that there is great difference betweene
theſe two phraſes. Inſtitui haeres in totum Aſſem, &amp; ex toto
Aſſe. For all thoſe, which were nominated Haeredes, whether
it were ex Dodrante, Quadrante, vel Semuncia, or howſoever,
yet were they tearmed Haeredes ex toto Aſſe .i. they
were not Legatarij, ſuch as receaued legacies. Now none

                           Sigonius, that this law was of force onlie
in the province of Sicilia: alſo that it is one thing ſcribere

to chooſe the Iudges, which was 30. daies after.

                        Though by vertue of Servilius his law the Senators were
made capeable of the office of a Iudge,Cic. de orat. l. 3. yet they were not
thereby equally capeable with the Romane Gentlemen: &amp;
therefore did M. Livius Druſus ordeine, that the Iudges
ſhould be elected equally out of both orders, namely three

hundred out of the Senat, and three hundred out of the
Gentry.

                           M. Plautius Sylvanus preferred a law,Cic. pro Cornel. that the number
of Iudges ſhould bee choſen not onely out of the Romane
Senators and Gentlemen, but out of the populacy alſo,
namely out of every Tribe fifteene Iudges.

                           Cn. Pompeius Magnus being Conſul ordained,Cic. in Piſon. that the
Iudges ſhould bee elected out of the wealthieſt Centuries,
tying the election notwithſtanding to thoſe three degrees

alſo he added that the number of Iudges to examine

                           Iudicum decuriae:] When the L. chiefe Iuſtice had taken
his oath, he choſe out ſome ex certis ordinibus, non ex omni
populo .i. out of ſuch degree and place, as the law required,
to ſit in iudgement in the triall of thoſe caſes, which
were tearmed cauſae publicae: and theſe Iudges he afterward
divided into leſſer numbers called Decuriae. vid. Sigon. de
iure Rom. lib. 2. cap. 18.
                        
                           E Centurionibus.] Centuriones were captaines over an
hundred footmen.
                        
                           
                           Anteſignanis.] This word Anteſignanus hath a double
acception in the Romane hiſtories. Sometimes Anteſignani
do ſignifie the third part of the Romane army: For all thoſe
ſouldiers, that fought before the banners or enſignes, as
they were called Haſtati in reſpect of their weapō, ſo were
they called Anteſignani in reſpect of their enſignes, before
which they fought. The ſecond part of the army as they
were called Principes in reſpect of their proweſſe and valour,
ſo were they called Subſignani, as fighting vnder the
enſignes. The third part, as they were called Triarij becauſe
they fought in the third, or rereward, ſo were they
called Poſtſignani, as fighting behinde the enſignes. Where
we muſt not think, that thoſe which were called Anteſignani,
&amp; Subſignani, were altogither deſtitute of enſigns amōg
themſelues (for every Maniple had his enſigne) But the
Eagle and other chiefe enſignes were caryed by the Subſignani,
and in reſpect had to them they had their names.
And hence ariſeth the ſecond acceptiō of this word, namely
that all thoſe ſouldiers of every Maniple, which ſtood in
front before their enſigne were called Anteſignani, &amp; thoſe
were commonly the beſt ſouldiers in the company. See the
ſeverall proofes of this. Lipſ. Milit. Rom. lib. 4. dial. 3.
                        
                           Alaudis.] Iul. Caeſar preſſed a legion of ſouldiers out of
Gallia Tranſalpina, all which afterwarde he made free of
Rome. This legion he called Legionem Alaudarum, frō the
forme of their helmets which did reſemble the head of the
Larke, called in french Alauda. Barthol. Latomus in Philip.

                        This law (made by Memnius) provided, that no action
ſhould be entred againſt thoſe,Cic. in Vatin. who were imploied abroad
in buſineſſes for the common wealth. An addition vnto
this law was, that whoſoever ſhould calumniari .i. forge an
accuſation againſt another,Cic. pro Sext Roſcio. a certaine letter ſhould bee
burnt in his forehead in token of infamy. This law is ſometimes
called Lex Rhemnia. Here we may withFr. Sylv. in orat. pro Cluentio. 
                           Fr. Sylvius
obſerue the difference of theſe three phraſes, Calumniari,
Praevaricari, and Tergiverſari. He which doth in his accuſation
forge faults never committed, is ſaid Calumniari. He
which vndertaketh ones ſuit, and either will not vrge reaſons
in the behalfe of his client, or anſwer the obiections
of his adverſarie when he is able, is ſaid Praevaricari .i. to
play the falſe Proctour. He which doth deſiſt in his accuſation,
and let his ſuit fal, is ſaid Tergiverſari.

                            Thoſe things were tearmed res Mancipi,
which were alienated from the ſeller Nexu .i. by ſuch a
forme of ſale as followeth. The forme was thus; At the leaſt
fiue witneſſes, all Romane citizens and of full age, beſides
one called Libri-pens (from holding of a paire of ballāces)
ſhould be preſent: and the chapman or buyer ſhould come
with a certaine braſſe coyne in his hand, and ſay (for example
ſake, if it were a bondſlaue to be ſold) Hunc ego hominem

coyne, he gaue it to him that made the ſale. This kinde of
chaffering was tearmed Nexus, as we may ſuppoſe a nectē
                              do,
becauſe it did bind the ſeller to make good the ſale:

that is in this maner ſolde; though ſometimes Mancipium
doth ſignifie the ſale it ſelfe: whence Cic. vſeth this phraſe,
Lex Mancipij, to ſignifie a clauſe or condition put in the
ſale. All things ſolde after this maner were tearmed Res

of theſe ballances, why they ſhould bee vſed in this kind of
bargaining, to be, becauſeAlex. Gen. dier. l. 4. c. 15. in olde time they did not bargaine
by paying coined mony, which was called Aes ſignatum,
but by paying a certaine weight of money, whence
ſuch mony was tearmed Aes graue. And hence it is, that
metaphorically we tranſlate Pendo and Rependo, to pay and
repay.

ſalute or attend vpon thoſe that ſtood for offices, were hired

they ſhould be liable to the cenſure of Calpurnius his law.
                     
                     
                        Tullia lex.
                        
                           M. Tullius Cic. made a law, that no man ſtanding for an
office ſhould cauſe any publike prize to bee plaid, within
two yeares that he either had ſtood, or ſhould ſtand for an
office, vnleſſe the day had formerly beene appointed by
ſome will. Item he ordained, that Senatours being found to
haue vſed vnlawfull meanes for the attaining of any office,Cic. pro Sext▪
                           
ſhould ſuffer ten yeares exilement. And the commonaltie

then ſhould he vndergoe a penaltie.
                        
                           Si morbum excuſaret.] So that Tully here ſeemeth to cut
of that libertie which the twelue tables permitted in theſe
words [Si Iudex alteruè ex litigatoribus morbo ſontico impediatur,

And vnleſſe ſome might thinke, that by morbus ſonticus

would gather together a certaine company of their
ſide or faction to follow them, tearming them Sodales: &amp;
theſe Sodales would as it were by violence force the people
to ſuffrage with them, whence the violence offered by
them was tearmed Sodalitia. Sig. de Iud. lib. 2. cap. 30.

read of three ſorts of Iudges among the Romanes, or rather
of three divers kinds of elections of their Iudges. For either
they were Lecti ſortitione, of which more may be ſeen
in one of the lawes following; or Editione, by nomination
or naming them, the manner thereof being thus; That
either the plaintiffe ſhould chooſe them all, and then were
they called Iudices edititij; or the plaintiffe ſhould chooſe
one halfe, and the defendant the other, and then were they
called Iudices alterni. Melancthon in Cic. pro Muraen.

                     FIrſt touching the word Repetundae, Sigonius ſaith, that
ſuch money was tearmed Pecuniae repetundae, quae poſſent
repeti, which might by the courſe of lawe bee recovered;
Namely ſuch money as any Magiſtrate, Iudge, or publike
officer, did either in the Provinces, or in the citie receaue
as a bribe, from the Allies and Aſſociates, or from the Romane
citizens for the adminiſtration of iuſtice, or the execution

of any publike dutie: &amp; this kind of bribe they tearmed
Pecunias Repetundas, pecuniam ablatam, captam, coactam,
conciliatam, averſam (Cic. in Ʋerrinis) But as it ſeemeth
very probable, theſe lawes againſt briberie were firſt
occaſioned, for the eaſe and reliefe of the Romane Provinces
and Allies, called in Latine Socij, who were much abuſed
in this kind by the Prov. Conſuls, Praetours, &amp; Quaeſtors,
&amp;c. Whence Tully calleth this law againſt bribery, Legem
Socialem.

For the right vnderſtanding of theſe two words [Ampliari
&amp; Comperendinari] we muſt conſider the ancient cuſtomes
and ceremonies vſed by the Romanes in handling
their ſuits of law. Firſt there was In ius vocatio .i. a citation
of one into the court. Secondly poſtulatio .i. a requeſt put vp
vnto the Praetour, that it might be lawfull for the Plaintiffe
to enter his action againſt the Defendāt; whence Poſtulare
aliquem de hoc vel illo crimine, is to accuſe one of this or
that crime. Thirdly Nominis delatio .i. the taking of the defendants
name into the court-booke: and this was tearmed
Intendere actionem, vel Litem; and Diem alicui dicere .i. to
enter an actiō againſt one. At which time the plaintiffe did
Vadari reum .i. demaund ſureties or bale frō the defendant,
that he would appeare vpon the day appointed by the Praetour,
which commōly was the third day following, called
properly dies perendinus, and ſometimes dies tertius ſimply,
as it appeareth by thoſe capitall letters. I. D. T. S. P. vſed to
be written in their actions: which lettersSig. de Iud. lib. 1. cap. 27. 
                           Probus expoundeth
thus. In diem tertium, ſiue perendinum. So that thē properly,
lis vel reus dicitur comperendinari, when the giving
of ſentence is differred til the third day. Moreover before
the Praetor would ſuffer the Action to be entered, he would
ſweare the Plaintiffe that he did not accuſe the Defendant
calumniandi cauſâ .i. falſely or maliciouſly, and this kind of
ſwearing was tearmed Calumniam iurare, calumniam deiurare,
and In litem iurare. Now if either party were abſent
from the court vpon the third day, except he were ſicke, he
was caſt in his ſuit, and the Praetor did graunt an executiō
called Edictum peremptorium, whereby he gaue autority to
his adverſary to ſeaze vpon his goods. Sometimes there
were two or three Edicts in manner of Proceſſes or writs
before the Edictum peremptorium could be obtained; ſome
times it was graunted at the firſt, and then was itSig. eiuſd. l. cap▪ 28. called
vnum pro omnibus.
                           Sig. eiuſd. l. cap. 21. Now if both parties came into the court
and did appeare, then were they ſaid ſe ſtitiſſe: ſo that this
word ſisto amongſt the lawyers did ſignifie to ſhew ones

ſelfe in the court. Vpon the third day the Praetor alſo with
the whole bench of Iudges did meete, and the Iudex Quaeſtionis
(whom Roſinus maketh a diſtinct officer differing
from the Praetor) did cauſe all the Select Iudges to pull out
certaine lots, out of an vrne or pitcher brought thither for
that purpoſe, &amp; thoſe Iudges vpon whom the lot fell were
to ſit in iudgment: This was called Sortitio Iudicum. Now
if either the Plaintiffe or Defendant did ſuſpect any of
thoſe, that they would be partiall, then might he except againſt
them, and that was called Iudicum reiectio: Then the
Iudex quaeſtionis would in manner aforeſaide chooſe other
Iudges into their places, and that was called ſubſortitio.
Which being ended, thoſe Iudges which were thus choſen
received every one of them from the Praetor three tables,
the one having this letter A written in it, betokening Abſolution:
whence Tully calleth it literam ſalutarem: The other
having this letter C written in it, betokening Condemnatiō:
the third having theſe two letters N. L. betokening
Non liquet. After the receipt of the tables, then did the
Praetor mittere vel dimittere iudices in cōſilium .i. ſend them
to caſt their tables into the vrnes, there being three vrnes
or little coffers purpoſely provided; the one for thoſe iudges
which were choſen out of the Senators, the other for
thoſe that were choſen out of the Gentlemen, the third for
thoſe which were choſen 
                              •
                           ut of the Martiall Treaſurers.
Now if they did caſt the firſt ſort of tables into the vrnes,
then the Praetor pronounced the defendāt abſolued; if the
ſecond, then he pronounced him condemned; if the thirde,
then hee pronounced Amplius cognoſcendum, that they
muſt haue longer time to enquire: And this is properly termed
Ampliatio, A repriue; and in ſuch maner it is ſaid, quod
lis vel reus dicitur Ampliari. The proofes for this manner
of proceeding in law may bee collected out of Roſinus lib.
antiq. 9. cap. 19. 20. &amp; 24. and out of Sigonius according to
the marginall quotations.

                           Cornelius Sylla being Dictator ordained a law,C. pro Cluen. that the

of Iudges, ſhould ſit vpon life and death on ſuch as had killed
a man; on ſuch as had with an evill intent ſet any place

kill or rob a man; on ſuch as had either made, bought, ſold,
had, or given any poyſon, thereby to kill a man; on anie
magiſtrate, whoſoever ſhould cauſe any conventicle or ſecret
aſſemblies, or ſhould giue their conſent to the ſuborning
of any man to accuſe another falſely, that thereby he
being innocent might be oppreſſed &amp; condēned by publique
iudgement. Moreover De eius capite quaerito, &amp;c. .i.
Let them ſit vpon life and death on that man, which ſhall

                           Parricidium.] This word doth properly ſignifie onely a
murthering of ones parents or kinsfolke, but in Numa Pō
                              pilius
his time it ſignified as much as homicidium .i. any mā

                        Si qui in iure:] Here we muſt note, that the cuſtome among
the Romanes in old time was, that as often as any
controverſie did ariſe touching the poſſeſſion of an houſe,
a field, or any ſuch like thing, the Praetor did goe vnto the
houſe, field, or the thing queſtioned, being accompanyed
thither with the Plainteiffe and the Defendant, togither
with others whom the law required to be preſent as witneſſes.
This place whereſoever it were, though in the open
fielde, during the time that the Praetor ſate there to giue
iudgement, was tearmed in Latin Ius, in Engliſh a Court.
Where in the preſence of the Praetor and the witneſſes, the

plaintiffe and Defendant did manum conſerere, that is, as
I. Camerar. pro L. Muraen▪

Let them take a turffe of the ground: for ſoSig. de iud. lib. 1. c. 21. 
                        Sigonius expoundeth
Vindiciae; though properly (as hee obſerveth) it
ſignified the poſſeſſiō of a thing, rather then the thing poſſeſſed.
This turffe being taken vp, was caryed to the Praetor,
and iudgment was given vpon that, as vpon the whole.
I do preſume that in other caſes, as in taking the poſſeſſion
of an houſe, &amp;c: ſome other thing in maner of the 
                           •
                        urffe
was preſented vnto the Praetor, vpon which as vpon the
whole he gaue iudgement. In Proceſſe of time, the Praetor
by reaſon of the multitude of other imployments, not finding
convenient leaſure to review every particular groūd,
or houſe called in queſtion,A. Gell. vid. Roſin. Ant. l. 8. c. 29. it was ordained contrarie to
the twelue tables, that the plaintiffe in ſuch caſes ſhoulde
come into the court, and challenge the defendant in this
forme of words, Ex iure manu conſertum te voco .i. I challenge
thee to goe out of the court into the field, to vſe one
towards the other that ſolemne forme of words which the
law enioyneth. Then did the defendant either yeeld the
poſſeſſion of the ground, or elſe he did reply, Vnde tume ex
iure manu conſertum vocaſti, inde ib
                              •
                            ego te revoco. Thē did
they both taking witneſſes with them without the company
of the Praetor inire viam .i. goe into the ground bringing
back a turffe thereof, vpon the which (as in maner ſhewne)
the Praetor gaue iudgement at their returne.
                     For the better vnderſtanding of this that hath been ſpoken
in the explanation of this law, we muſt note, that the
action tearmed Vindicatio was twofold: either the ſuit for
the poſſeſſion of a thing, or the ſuit for the Lordſhip or

right owning thereof. The poſſeſſiō of any thing was recovered,
either by a true &amp; real violence, or by a ſeeming violēce.
This ſeeming violence was twofold, either it was manus
cōſertio, which was ſhewne immediately before; or Moribus
deductio .i. a cuſtomary leading the vnlawfull poſſeſſor
out of the groūd thereby to enter poſſeſſiō. Vis ſimulata altera
à lege, altera emanavit à moribus; ſaithde iudic. lib. 1. cap. 21▪
                         
                        Sigon. The firſt
of theſe did ariſe from the Romane law, the other from a
cuſtome amongſt the Romanes: the firſt of theſe is to bee
ſeene in Tully his oration pro Muraena, the other pro Caecinnâ.
To theſe Sigonius addeth a third kinde of ſeeming violence;
which how iuſtly he hath tearmed a violence, I ſhal
leaue to the indifferent iudgement of the vnpartial reader.
The right of the Lordſhip or owning any thing was ſued
for in this maner: The plainteiffe did queſtion with the defendant
thus; firſt An auctor eſſet? .i. whether hee had not
covertly made away the poſſeſſion of the thing, thereby to
fruſtrate the action. Secondly, An sponderet .i. whether he
woulde put in a gage of mony into the court, which hee
would forfeit if he were caſt; which being done, the plaineteiffe
did alſo vpon the demande of the defendant put in a
gage of mony to be forfeited, if he prevailed not in his ſuit.
This gage of mony was tearmedSigon. de iu dic. lib. cap. 21▪

ſenſe, Tully pro Milone, ſaith, Iniustis vindicijs, &amp; ſacramentis
alienos fundos petunt, that is, they ſue for other
mens grounds, with vniuſt actions and gages of mony.
Thirdly, An ſatiſdaret, that is, whether hee woulde
put in ſurety, that during the triall in law, the ground or
houſe called in queſtion ſhould not be impaired. The ſolemne
forme of words vſed in the firſt demande, is thus to
be ſeene inCic. orat. pro Muraena &amp; pro Coecina.

to pay all coſts &amp; damages; if he profeſſed himſelfe
the preſent poſſeſſor, then did the plainteiffe proceed in mā
                        ner
as he ſhould for the poſſeſſion thereof; if he denyed it,
then did the Praetor ſay vnto the plainteiffe, Quando negat,

ſacramento quaerito: Therevpon ſaid the plainteiffe to the
defendant, Quando negas, te ſacramēto quinquagenario provoco,
ſpondesne te ſoluturum quinquaginta aſſes, ſi auctor ſis?
To whom the defendant replyed, spondeo quinquaginta aſſes
ſi auctor ſim. Tu verò spondesne idem, ni ſim? The plaineteiffe
anſwered, Ego quo
                              
                                 
                              
                              que
                            ſpondeo. Now in this kinde of ſtipulation,
the plainteiffe was ſaid ſponſione &amp; ſacramento pro
vocare, ſacramento rogare, quaerere, &amp; ſtipulari .i. to challenge
one to pawn a ſumm of mony for the trial of a ſuit in
law. The defendant was ſaid, cōtendere ex provocatione, cō
                           tendere
ſacramento, &amp; reſtipulari .i. to be ſued in ſuch manner.
This mony was tearmed ſacramentū,
                        Sig. de iud. lib. 1. cap. 21. becauſe when
it was forfeited, it was beſtowed in rebus ſacris &amp; divinis.

did cauſe any ſuſpicion of imminent danger) the
chiefe leader of the ſouldiers did go vnto the Capitoll and
bring forth two banners or flags, the one red, called therefore
vexillum roſeum, vnto which the footmen repaired; the
other sky-coloured called therefore coeruleum, which the
horſemen followed. The reaſon why the horſemens bāner
was sky-coloured isServ Aenei. lib. 8. rendred thus, becauſe it did moſt reſemble
the colour of the ſea, which colour they deemed
moſt acceptable to Neptune, who was both the God of
the ſea, and the firſt autor of horſes. Now becauſe the
ſuddaine daunger woulde not yeelde ſo much time,
that they might ſeverally bee ſworne, therefore did they
take their oath in common altogether; and thence
were they called Milites per coniurationem; as likewiſe
Lipſ. lib. 1. d
                              •

                        Milites ſubitarij in reſpect of their ſuddaine preſſe. The
third member may alſo be admitted, if we withLib. 1. de mil Rom. dial. 8. 
                        Lipſius vnderſtand
it in its true ſenſe, namely for thoſe ſouldiers who
by the L. Generall were added vnto the body of their army;
hee hauing autoritie to call out ſuch other ſouldiers,
who for their long ſervice were diſcharged from giuing in
their names at a muſter. And theſe are generally by all autors
tearmed Milites evocati; and Lipſius deemeth them
all one with thoſe whom Servius calleth Milites per evocationem.
The ſouldiers being thus preſſed, if they purpoſed
to make warre vpon their enimies, then did the L. Generall
ſummon them to prepare themſelues by a ſound of trumpets;
&amp; this was tearmed Claſſicum canere, à calando, which
ſignifieth to call. Which being done, a skarlet banner was
hanged out at the L. Generall his pavilion: from which ceremony
I thinke that that common adage did firſt ariſe,

                        conferre ſigna &amp; Collatis ſignis pugnare, to ioine battle. Immediatly
vpon this they did Barritum tollere, make a great
ſhout or noyſe with their voices to the greater terrour of
their enimies: and that the noyſe might be the greater,
they did Arma concutere, ruſtle together with their armour,
and claſh their ſwords. Theſe foure ceremonies are
to be ſeene more at large inLib. 4. de milit. Rom. dial 11. &amp; 12. 
                        Lipſius. Vnto which wee may
adde the fift obſerved byIn ep viror. illuſt. l. 4. ep 1 
                        Fr. Sylvius; namely that at the
removing of their campe, they did conclamare vaſa, giue a
great ſhout or cry in token that the ſouldiers ſhould truſſe
vp their bagge and baggage: and hence it is thatPlaut in Pſeudolo. 
                        Plautus
vſeth this phraſe, Colligatis vaſis to ſignifie as much as paratè
or expeditè. Now that they might be the readier for battle,
they did gird (as I ſuppoſe) their ſouldiers coates cloſe
vnto them: And a ſouldier thus girt was called Cinctutus .i.
(ſaithPigh. in ſua praef. ad lib. 1. ſeptim. 
                        Pighius) Cinctu tutus.

                     THE Romane forces were in olde time divided into
two ſeverall parts; namely in Legiones &amp; Auxilia,
into Legions and Auxiliarie bands. The Auxiliary
bands were ſuch forces as the neighbour and confederate
countries did ſend vnto the Romanes. The legions were taken
out of the body of the Romanes:

                         were
called Centuria, a centurie.Varro. vid. Roſin. ant. Rom. l. 10. c. 5 Theſe centuries were ſometimes
divided into leſſer numbers called Contubernia; every
Contubernium containing tenne ſouldiers beſides their

Where we muſt obſerue that Contubernium doth ſignifie
as well the pavilion or lodging it ſelfe, as the ſouldiers
lodging therein: and it may be ſo called quaſi Contaberniū,
frō 
                        Taberna ſignifying any ſlight lodging made of boards.
Thoſe that ruled over a thouſand footmen we may in Engliſh

cal Seriants maior. They called them Tribunimilitū.
Thoſe that governed over the centuries were called by thē
                        Centuriones, by vs in engliſh Centurions: and they had their
inferiour officers vnder them which were called Tergiductores,
or Extremi agminis ductores.
                        Veget. vid. Roſin. ant. Rom. l. 10. c. 7 Their office was to overſee
and looke vnto thoſe of the campe which were ſick,
who commonly came behind the army, Quaſi extremum
agmen, et tergum aciei. The horſemen were divided into ſeverall
troopes called Turmae, every Turma containing thirtie
horſemen. Againe every Turma was ſubdivided into
three leſſer companies called Decuriae, every Decuria containing
ten horſemen: whence their captaine was called
Decurio, and the captaines over the greater troopes, namely
over the ſeverall wings of the horſemen, were called Equitum
praefecti. Now the chiefe governour over the vniverſall
army was called cōmonly Imperator: we in Engliſh
call him a L. Generall. His Lieutenant or L. deputie was
called Legatus,
                        Lipſ. de mil. Rom. lib. 2. dial. 10. who in old time was ſent non tam ad imperandum,
quàm ad conſulendum imperatori. This word Imperator
in the Romane hiſtories hath a threefold acception.
Firſt it is taken for him; who by commiſſion from the ſtate
hath the managing of an army, being the ſame that Praetor
was in ancient time: and in this ſenſe it hath affinitie with
the office of our L. Generall. Secondly for ſuch a L. Generall,
who by his proweſſe having putBarth La tom. in Phil. orat. 14. one thouſand of his
enimies to the ſword, both his ſouldiers ſaluted him, &amp; the
Senate ſtyled him by the name of Imperator: But if hee had
ſlaine leſſe then one thouſand, he was not thought worthy
of this ſolemne ſalutation by that name. Laſtly it was takē
for a ſoveraigne Prince, King, or Monarch, in which ſenſe
it was the Praenomen of all the Romane Emperours frō
                        Iulius Caeſar forward. Now becauſe the ſouldiers in a Legion
muſt of neceſſitie differ much in eſtate, age, and experience,
ſome being welthier, elder, and of more experience
then others; hence was it requiſite alſo, that there ſhould
be a diſtinction of places in their armies, according to the

deſert and worth of each ſeverall perſon. We are therefore
likewiſe to vnderſtand,Lipſ. de mil. Rom. l. 1. dial. 3. that the Conſuls every yeare made
a generall muſter: at which time the military Tribunes
choſe out the youngeſt and pooreſt of all the reſt, &amp; called
them by the name of Velites. Their place in regard of the
other ſouldiers was baſe and diſhonourable, not onely becauſe
they fought a farre off and were lightly armed; but
alſo becauſe they were commōly expoſed to their enimies
as forelorne hopes. According toLip. de mil Rom. lib. 4. dial. 3. 
                        Lipſius theſe Velites did
commonly make vp the ſpaces betweene the Maniples of
the Pikemen; notwithſtanding they did like ſcouts run to
&amp; fro, caſting out their darts (as occaſion was offered) &amp; ſo
retire: whence when a man doth leape from one thing to
another in his talke, wee ſay hee doth Agere velitatim.
Having choſen out a competent number of theſe ſcoutes,
they proceeded to the choiſe of thē, which they called Haſtati .i. Pike-men: foraſmuch as they fought with a kinde of
iaueling, which the Romanes called Haſta. Theſe Pike-mē
fought in the firſt part or fore front of the maine army. The
third choiſe which they made, was of the ſtrōgeſt &amp; higheſt
bodiedmed men, who for the prime of their age were called
Principes: and hence was the ſecond place or warde in the
maine army called Principia, according toTerent. Eunuch. Act. 4. Scen. 7.

                            principia .i. I will followe the Principes,
thereby chooſing to himſelfe the beſt, and ſafeſt place. The
laſt ſort of ſouldiers, which ſtood in the third place or rereward,
were called Triarij. They were of al, the moſt approved,
and the very laſt helpe and refuge; ſo that if they failed,
all was loſt: and hence ariſeth that forme of ſpeech, Ad
Triarios ventum eſt,
                        Alex. Gen. dier. l. 5. c. 15. whereby we ſignifie that a thing is
come to the laſt puſh. As I ſuppoſe, the weapon, wherwith
theſe Triarij fought, was a dart with yron faſtened at the
end of it, called in Latin Pilum. The reaſons of this my cō
                        iecture
are theſe: firſt becauſe the firſt century of theſe Triarij
was called Primum pilum, and their centurion Primopilus,
and Primipilus, and Primus centurio, becauſe he was

the chiefe Centurion in a whole legion, as having the
charge of the chiefe banner called the Eagle;Lip. de mil. Rom. lib. 2. dial. 8. whence
Aquila is ſometimes vſed to ſignifie Primopilatum, the office
and place of the Primopilus. The ſecond Century was
called ſecundum pilum, &amp; their Centurion Secundipilus, &amp;c.
Secondly, they called the Principes, which marched in the
battle immediatly before theſe Triarij, Antepilanos: which
argueth that thoſe ſouldiers, which followed next ſhoulde
be the Milites Pilani; and by conſequence their weapon
ſhould be that kind of dart, which they called Pilum. Their
maner of embattelling was divers. Sometimes they would
make a winged army, ſo that the maine body thereof
ſhould be in the middle, &amp; on each ſide a leſſer company:
The maine body we in Engliſh call the Vauntgard, &amp; the
two leſſer companies we call Wings; as likewiſe in Latine
they called them Alas aciei, and dextrum vel ſiniſtrum cornu.
                        Pancir in notit. orient. &amp; occident imper. c. 32. 
                        Pancirollus calleth them Vexillationes, becauſe there
fought no more in either wing, then belonged to one banner
called in Latin Vexillum. The governours of theſe
wings he calleth Alarum Praefectos. Sometimes they embatled
ſo, that the forefront of the Army being ſmal, it was
enlarged bigger and bigger backwarde in manner of a triangle:
ByLipſ. milit. Rom. lib 4. dial. 7. 
                        Lipſius it is demonſtrated vnto vs vnder the
forme of the greeke letter 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        . He in the ſame place calleth
it caput porcinum, quia velut fodit &amp; ruit invadendo. Commonly
it was called Cuneus militū, the metaphor being borrowed
not only from the reſemblance it had with a wedg,
but alſo from the vſe of a wedge: for they never embatled
in that forme, vnleſſe it was to breake through their enimies,
the piercing angle being thicke compacted with targets.
Sometimes they did in a quite cōtrary maner enlarge
their army in the forefront, making it to end in an angle: &amp;
Lipſ. milit. Rom. lib. 4 dial. 7. this they called Forfex and Forceps militum. Sometimes
their forme of embatling was circular, and then was it called
Orbis vel globus militum. The banner or flagge was
properly called 
                           Ʋexillum, being a diminutiue of Velum. It

                     IF the ſiege of a towne ſeemed difficult and hard to compaſſe,
then did the Romanes vſe certaine meanes of policie
for the better effecting thereof. They invironed the
towne with a broad and deepe ditch, adding therevnto a
rampier, fortified with many caſtles and fortreſſes, whereby
they both kept the towne from any forraigne ſuccour,
and withall ſecured themſelues from ſallies and other ſtratagems.
This rampier did extend it ſelfe toward the wals of
the city, ſo that by making (as it were) a great hill, they
might overtop the city, and fight with the greater advantage.
Now that this great heape of earth might become
firme and well able to ſupport the buildings to bee erected
vpon it, they did caſt in much timber &amp; ſtones amongſt the
earth; and this heape of earth, ſtones, and timber when it
was reared, was properly called Agger; whence commeth

doth ſignifie a pole or ſtake, wherevnto vines are tyed; according
to that received adage, which we vſe when a ſpeciall
friend forſaketh one, Vallus vitem decepit. From the
firſt ſignification it is, that Vallum doth often ſignifie the
incloſure, or hedging in of trees and ſtakes, wherwith the
bulwarke is vpheld: Alluding wherevntoA Gel. Noc. Attic. l. 1. c. 15

defenſe, whiles they were making this their rampire, was a

and hurdles, running vpon wheeles, vnder which they
might reſt ſecure frō all ſtones and darts caſt from the wals
of the city: It was called Vinea. A ſecond engine was Muſculus:
The matter wherof it was made I haue not read: but
the vſe of it was, that vnder it the ſouldiers might approch
vnto the wals of the city, and vndermine them. Thus much
Lipſ. polior. lib. 1. dial. 9. 
                        Lipſius ſeemeth to inferre, when he rendreth the reaſon
of the name: Muſculus ideò dictus, quia inſtar eius animalculi
foderent ſub eo terram. A third meanes of their defenſe
was Militaris teſtudo. This word Teſtudo in the art Military
had a double acception, both being borrowed from the
reſemblance of the Tortoiſe ſhell, which is the true &amp; genuine
ſignification of this word. In the firſt acception Teſtudo,
                        Roſin. ant Rom. l. 10. c. 16 doth ſignifie a warlike engine or fenſe made with
boards covered over with raw hides, which ſerved againſt
fire and ſtones caſt at the ſouldiers: vnder this they might
ſafely aſſaile the wals.Stad. in Flor. l 4. c. 10. In the ſecond acceptiō it ſignifieth
a target-fenſe, which was a cloſe holding togither of targets
over head like a vault or roofe, wherewith the footemen
did defend themſelues from the thicke ſhot of arrows
or ſlinging of ſtones. Their rampier or countermure being
finiſhed, they vſed certaine great timber towers made vpon
wheeles to run to and fro, which they called Turres ambulatoriae,
moueable turrets. Theſe towers had many ſtories
one over the other,Roſin. ant. Rom. lib. 10. cap 16. wherein they carryed ladders &amp;
caſting bridges thereby to ſcale the wals. The engines hithervnto
haue been defenſiue, ſuch wherwith the Romanes

That the reader may receaue the more light in the vnderſtanding
of this obſcure deſcription. I haue added the very
words of Marcellinus. [Ferrum inter axiculos duos firmum

by Marcellinus in two lines, which I purpoſely did
not tranſlate in their place, becauſe I would continue the
ſenſe, without ſuch a long parentheſis. The reaſon is there
delivered thus; becauſe the violence and force of the erected
beame recoiling, after it had beene by the ſtroke diſcharged,
was ſuch, that it would ſhake in peeces the ſtrongeſt
wals, except there were ſome ſoft thing interpoſed,
whereby the forceable ſtrength of the recoile might bee by
degrees ſlacked. The Aries or Ram is deſcribed alſo by
Marcellin. in the ſame place. [The Ram was a great tree, or
beame like vnto a maſt of a ſhip, having a peece of iron in
maner of a Rams head, faſtned at the end thereof, wherewith
they did demoliſh and batter downe the wals of a city.
It was hung vnto a beam, which lay a croſſe over a couple
of pillars, and hanged thus equally ballanced, it was by
force of men pulled backward, and then recoiled vpon the
wals.] In lieu of theſe Rammes another engine was found
out, called Helepolis, ab invſitato 
                        
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

The forme of it is to bee ſeene alſo in Marcell. ibid.
[There was (ſaith hee) a Teſtudo, or vaulted frame made,
ſtrengthned with very long peeces of timber: it was covered
over with oxe hides, and greene wicker hurdles: the vpper
part or convexe ſur-face thereof was overlaid with
mud, to the end that it might keepe of the fal of fire and caſting
of weapons. Now there were faſtned in the front of it
certaine Cuspides tri

maſſy, in maner of the thunderbolts, which painters and
poets exhibite vnto vs. This great engine the ſouldiers ruling
within with divers wheeles &amp; ropes, with maine force
they thruſt it againſt the wals.] [Malleoli (ſaith the ſame
Marcellinus) were certaine darts faſhioned on this maner;
there was an arrow made of a cane, betwixt the head &amp; the

nocke whereof was faſtned an iron full of cle

                        ts; which arrow
like vnto a womans diſtaffe, on which linnen is ſpinned,
was finely made hollow within the belly, yet open in
many places: In the belly it receaved fire with fuell to feed
vpō. And thus being gently diſcharged out of a weak bow
(for with an over ſtrong ſhooting the fire was extinguiſhed)
if it tooke faſt hold on any place, it burned the ſame,
&amp; water being caſt thereon, the fire increaſed: neither was
there any meanes to quench it, but by caſting duſton it.]
Now if they could not prevaile by theſe engines called
Machinae, then did they make certain paſſages vnder groūd
which they called Cuniculi from Cuniculus ſignifying a cony-berry:
inſomuch that theſe two phraſes are oppoſite,
Machinis, &amp; Cuniculis oppugnare, as it appeareth by that
ofPlutarc. in vit. C▪ Caeſ.

                     ALbeit after the victory the Romanes inflicted divers
degrees of puniſhment, according to the malice
found in an enimie; yet were they alwaies compaſſionate,
and (as hiſtories teſtifie) more exorable then any other
nation. The puniſhments which we find them to haue
vſed toward a conquered nation are theſe. Either they puniſhed
them by death; or ſold them ſub coronâ; or diſmiſſed
them ſub iugum; or merced them in taking away their territories;
or made them tributarie ſtates.A. Gell. lib. 7. cap. 4. An enimie was ſaid
to be ſold ſub coronâ, when he being placed in the market
place, a crowne was put vpon his head in token of ſuch a
ſale: or therefore certaine capti
                           •
                        es were ſaid to be ſold ſub
coronâ, becauſe at ſuch times they were invironed about
with ſouldiers to keepe them together, and this circle of
ſouldiers, as likewiſe of all other companies, is called Corona.
When they diſmiſſed any ſub iugum,
                        Stad. in Flor lib. 1. c. 12. they erected two

ſpeares with a third lying a croſſe in maner of a gallowes:
then they cauſed them being di
                           •
                        armed, and their belt takē
away to paſſe vnder in token of bondage. When their territories
were taken from them, they were commonly conferred
vpon old beaten ſouldiers, in way of remunoration
for their faithfull ſervice. This tranſplantation was termed
Coloniae deductio; and the place ever after Romana Colonia
.i. a Romane Colonie. At which times they choſe out every
tenth man, viz. ſuch as were able and of beſt ſufficiencie to
make and eſtabliſh a publike councill,Sig. de iure Ital. l. 2. c. 4. whom they named
Decuriones. Whence wee may obſerue, that Decurio is not
alwaies taken for a captaine over ten horſemen, but ſometimes
it is vſed to ſignifie an Alderman, or chiefe Burgeſſe
in a Romane Colonie. Divers times the Romanes would bee
content after the conqueſt to grant to their enimies a
peaceable enioying of their lands and poſſeſſions, conditionally,
that they woulde yeelde all faithfull allegiaunce
vnto that L. Deputy, whōſoever the Senate of Rome ſhould
place over them. The L. Deputy was either ſtyled by the
name of a Propraetor, a Proconſul, or a Praefectus. Thoſe places,
where the two firſt ſorts of governours did rule, were
tearmed Provinciae; the other from the governour was termed
Praefectura. Where wee muſt obſerue that this word
Provincia hath a threefold acception. Firſt it is taken for a
country, which by the force &amp; power of armes is ſubdued
to the Romane empire, and governed by ſome Romane Deputie
ſent from the Senate: and this is the proper and primi

ſignification thereof, it being ſo called,Pig. lib. Tyrannif. 
                        Quod populus
Rom eam provicit .i. ante vicit. Secondly it is taken for any
region or country, where the L. Generall or chiefe captain
over a Romane army doth manage warre againſt any nation
by commiſſion from the Senate. Laſtly it ſignifieth any
publique function or adminiſtration of office, yea any private
dutie, charge, or taske either vndertaken, or impoſed;
according to that ofTerent. in Phor. 
                        Terence, Provinciam cepiſti duram .i.

be paid was either certaine, or vncertaine. The certain was

                           ipendiarij: and this
tribute was of two ſorts, either ordinarie, ſuch as was required
from every houſe yearely, even in the time of peace;
or extraordinary, ſuch as was levied by a law or decree of
the Senate towards vnexpected charges. The vncertaine
tributeSig. de iure Rom. l. 1. c. 16 properly called Vectigal, wasStadius in Flor. l. 3. c. 13. either impoſt-mony,

Portorium, or from Porta Portarium, and the receavers
thereof Portitores: or Tithe corne, namely the tenth part
of their graine, and that was called from Decem Decumae,
and the receauers thereof Decumani; though Decumanus
when it is an adiectiue ſignifieth as much as Maximus,
according to that of Ovid. lib. 1. de Triſt.

                            prior.
                     
                     The reaſon of this ſignification isFr. Sylv. in viror. illuſt. ep. 2. lib. 1. ſuppoſed to be, becauſe
in Arithmeticke amongſt ſimple numbers the tenth is the
greateſt: or laſtly that mony, which was paid by certaine
heardes-men for paſturing their cattle in the Romane fields
and forreſts. This kinde of tribute was called Scriptura, and
the paſtures Agri Scripturarij; becauſe (asSig. de iure Rom. l. 2. c. 4. 
                        Feſtus ſaith)
the bayliffe or receaver of this mony, called Pecuarius, did
Scribendo conficere rationes .i. keep his account by writing.
Where we muſt note, firſt that all theſe kindes of Tributes
were not only required in Provinces or Countries ſubdued,
but throught Italy, even in Rome it ſelfe. Secondly
though each collectour of theſe Tributes was diſtinguiſhed
by a peculiar name, yet by a generall name they were al
calledCic. de A ruſp. reſponſ. &amp; alias ſaepe. 
                        Publicani, in as much as they did take to rent theſe
publike tributes. The chiefe of them, which entred into
bond, as the principall takers or farmers of theſe tributes
Tully calleth Mancipes. The others which were entred in
to the ſame bond as ſureties, were tearmed Praedes. Many

times the Romanes did beſtow the freedome of their citie
vpon forraigne countries; &amp; the degrees of freedome was
proportioned accordingly as the countries were. Some
they honoured with the name of Romane citizens, but excluded
them from the right of ſuffraging, leaving them alſo
to be governed by their owne lawes and magiſtrates. This
ſtate they called a Municipal ſtate, in Latine Municipium,
becauſe they were Muneris huius honorarij participes.
                        Sig. l. 2. de iure Ital. c. 7. By
Munus honorarium in this place is vnderſtood nothing
but the bare title of a Romane citizen, whereby they were
privileged to fight in a legion as free deniſons, not in an
auxiliary band as the aſſociates. Now the firſt that ever obtained
this Municipall ſtate, were the Cerites, who for preſerving
the holy things of Rome in the time of the warre
againſt the Gaules, were rewarded with the freedome of
the citie, but without power of ſuffraging; From whence
it is, that thoſe tables, wherein the Cenſors inrolled ſuch as
were by them deprived of their voices, were called Cerites
tabulae; Horace calleth ſuch a table Ceritem ceram, for the
reaſon ſhewne before. But wee muſt withall obſerue, that
ſome Municipall townes haue either by deſert or inſtant
ſuit obtained the libertie of ſuffraging alſo, which occaſioneth
that receaued diſtinction, that there was Municipiū
ſine ſuffragio, and Municipium cum ſuffragio. Other countries
which could not bee admitted into the freedome of
the citie, haue obtained, and that not without ſpeciall and
deſerved reſpects to be Aſſociats and confederats vnto the
ſtate of Rome. The inhabitants of ſuch countries were ſometimes
called So

we commonly call it Induciae; and it differed from Foedus:
                        
                        Sigon. ibid. firſt, becauſe that Foedus is a perpetuall truce or league;
Secondly becauſe it was neceſſary, that one of thoſe Heralds
at armes called Foeciales, ſhould by a ſolemne proclamation
confirme this league called Foedus; neither of
which conditions was abſolutely requiſite in their truce
tearmed Pactio.

                     TOuching the puniſhments that the Romane L. General
vſed towards his owne ſouldiers when they were
faulty, they were commonly proportioned vnto the
fault committed. Sometimes they were eaſie, of which ſort
were al thoſe puniſhments which did only brand the ſouldiers
with diſgrace; other times they were heavier, ſuch as
did hurt &amp; afflict the body. To the firſt ſort belonged theſe;
Firſt Ignominioſa dimiſſio .i. a ſhameful diſcarding of a ſouldier,
when he is with diſgrace removed from the army. Secondly,
Fraudatio ſtipendij .i. a ſtopping of their pay: &amp; ſuch
ſouldiers which ſuffred this kinde of mulct were ſaid to be
are diruti,
                        Roſin. antiq. l. 10. c. 25. becauſe Aes illud diruebatur in fiſcū, non in militis
ſacculum. Thirdly, Cenſio haſtaria, whereby the ſouldier
was inioined to reſigne and giue vp his ſpeare: for as
thoſe which had atchieved any noble act, were for their
greater honour Haſtâ purâ donati: ſo others for their greater
diſgrace were enforced to reſigne vp their ſpeare.
Fourthly, the whole Cohors, which had loſt their banners,
were compelled to eat nothing but barly bread, being deprived
of their allowance in wheat; and every Centurion
in that Cohors had his ſouldiers belt or girdle taken from
him, which was no leſſe diſgrace amongſt them, then it is
now amongſt vs, that a knight of our order of the Garter,
ſhould be deprived of his Garter. Fiftly, for petty faults
they made them to ſtand barefooted before the L. General
his pavillion, with long poles of ten foote length in their

hands: and ſometimes in the ſight of the other ſouldiers to
walke vp and downe with turfes on their necks. In the laſt
of theſe they ſeemed to imitate their city diſcipline, whereby
malefactors were inioined to take a certaine beame reſembling
a forke vpon their ſhoulders, and ſo to cary it
round about the towne; whence from Fur

were tearmed Furciferi: It hath ſome affinity with our carting
of queanes here in England. In the firſt wee haue no
cuſtome, that doth more ſymbolize, then the ſtanding in a
white ſheet in the open view of a congregation. The laſt
of their leſſer puniſhments was the opening of a vaine or
letting them bloud in one of their armes:Alex. Gen. dier. l. 2. c. 13. which kinde of
puniſhment was vſed toward thoſe alone, which (as they
conceited thorow the abūdance of their hote bloud) were
too adventurous and bold. The heavier kinds of puniſhments
were theſe: firſt Virgis vel Fuſte caedi, to be beaten
with rods or with ſtaues and cudgils. None were ordinarily
beaten with cudgils, but thoſe who had not diſcharged
their office, in the ſending about that tablet called Teſſera,
wherein the watchword was written; or that had forſaken
their place, where they were appointed to keepe watch; or
thoſe who had ſtollen any thing from out the campe; or
borne falſe witneſſe againſt their fellowes, or abuſed their
bodies by women; or laſtly that had beene puniſhed thriſe
for the ſame fault: thoſe which were in this manner cudgilled,
were often killed in the place; but if they eſcaped aliue,
they were to liue in perpetuall exilement. The ceremony
vſed in this kinde of cudgilling was, that theTrib. milit. knight Martiall
ſhould lightly touch the party to be puniſhed with a
club, which being done, all the ſouldiers did beat him with
ſtaues and cudgils; whence we may ſay of one that deſerveth
a good cudgelling inCic. orat. Phil. 3.

out of order, then Virgis caedebatur .i. hee was ſcourged
with rods. Sometimes the knight Martiall vpon iuſt occaſion
would cauſe them to be ſold for bondſlaues, to be beheaded

to be hanged. All theſe puniſhments were perſonall
or particular; there remaineth one which was general,
namely when the fault was generall, as in their vproares,
conſpiracies, &amp;c. Vpon ſuch occaſions the ſouldiers were
called togither, and every tenth man vpon whom the lot
fell was puniſhed with that kinde of cudgilling aboue ſpoken
of; all the others eſcaped either without puniſhment,
or with very litle. The puniſhment it ſelfe was tearmed
Dec imatio legionis, and the reaſon of this kinde of puniſhment,
is rendred byCic. pro Cluent.

                     Cōcerning the rewards which were beſtowed in war,
ſome were by the Senate conferred vpon the L. Generall:
others were by the L. Generall conferred vpon
his ſouldiers. Thoſe honours which the L. Generall received
were three. Firſt Nomen Imperatoris, of whichVid. p. 176. before.
Secondly ſupplicatio .i. a ſolemne proceſſion continued
for many daies togither, ſometimes more, ſometimes fewer:
all which daies the Romane people did obſerue as holy
daies, offring vp dayly praiers and ſacrifice to the Gods
in the behalfe of their L. Generall: The cuſtome being that
after ſome notable victory, the ſouldiers having ſaluted
their chiefe captaine (whom I call their L. General) by the
the name of Imperator, then would he ſend letters vnto the
Senate dight with lawrell, wherein he required both that
name to be confirmed, and approved by them, as likewiſe
that they would Decernere ſupplicationes .i. appoint ſuch
ſolemne ſupplications. Thirdly, they honoured him at his
comming home alſo with a Triumph. Triumphus vel maior,
vel minor erat, ſaith Alexander. The leſſer kinde of triumph
was properly called Ovatio,
                        Salmuth. in Pancir. l.

                        ab ove, from a ſheepe,
which in this time of his triumph was led before him, and
afterward ſacrificed by him: As alſo in the greater triumph

(called properly Triumphus) the L. Generall ſacrificed a
bull. It differeth from the greater triumph firſt in the acclamation;
for in the leſſer triumph the ſouldiers following
did as it were redouble this letter O, and ſome are of opinion
that it was therefore called Ovatio. In the greater triumph
the ſouldiers followed crying Io triumphe, Io triumphe:
an example whereof may be ſeene inOde. 2. li. 4. 
                        Horace, where
he deſcribeth the triumph of Bacchus, the firſt autor of this
greater triumph; from whoſeSalmuth. in Pancir. l. rerū deperd. cap. de triumph. name alſo divers autors doe
deriue this word Triumphus, he being in greeke called 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        ,
which by a litle change is made Triumphus. Secondly
they differed, becauſe in the greater triumph, the L. Generall
did weare a garment of ſtate, called by ſome Trabea,
                        Alex. Gen. lib. 6. cap. 17. by others Triumphalis, Picta vel Aurata veſtis: likewiſe
a garland of lawrell, riding in a chariot, the Senators themſelues
with the beſt of the Romanes meeting him, his ſouldiers
with their coronets, their chaines, and other rewards
following after: But in the leſſer triumph the L. Generall
did weare a plaine purple gowne without any gold imbrodering,
and a garland of myrtle treeDion. Halicar. lib. 5. commonly going on
foote, ſometimes permitted to ride on a horſe; the gentlemen
and commonalty of Rome alone without the Senators
did meete him. Moreover for a perpetuall memory of this
their triumph in ſome publique place certaine trophies
were erected.Alex. Gen. dier. li. 1. c. 22.

there were ſtatues, columnes, and arches built in token of
triumph. Theſe arches though commōly they were known
by the name of Arcus triumphales, yet ſometimes they are

the Romane Generall himſelfe perſonally, did take away any
ſpoiles from the chiefe captaine of the enimies, then did
hee hang them vp in a temple conſecrated to Iupiter Feretrius,

                           e non poterat: theſe ſpoiles had the name of Opima ſpolia
.i. Royall ſpoiles. The rewards beſtowed vpon the ſouldiers
were divers: either places of office, as the place of a
Centurion, of a Praefectus, a Decurio, &amp;c. or their pay was
increaſed, the ſpoiles diſtributed amōgſt thē, or laſtly they
received certaine gifts tearmed Dona militaria. In ancient
times thoſe ſouldiers which ha
d beſt deſerved, receaved a
certaine meaſure of corne called by them Adorea;
                        Alex. Gen. dier. l. 4. c. 18. and
hence it is, that Adorea is now vſed to ſignifie ſuch laud &amp;
praiſe, as is due vnto a ſouldier. But after ages for the better
encouraging of the ſouldiers, haue found out more honourable
rewards, of whichSig. de iure Rom. l. 1. c. 15. theſe were the chiefeſt; Armilla
.i. bracelet for the hand-wreſt; Torquis, a chaine to
weare about their necke; Phalerae, horſetrappings; Haſtapura
.i. a ſpeare having no iron at the end of it; (Roſin. ant. lib. 10 c. 27. it is ſometimes
called Haſta donatica, and Haſta graminea:) Laſtly
Coronae, crownes, of which A. Gell. obſerveth theſe to haue
beene the chiefe: 1. Corona triumphalis, which in olde time
was made of Laurell, but afterward of gold, &amp; thence was
it called Corona aurea: it was ſent by the Senate vnto the
L. Generall in honour of his triumph; ſecondly Corona obſidionalis,
which was given by the ſouldiers vnto their Generall,
when they were freed from a ſiege: it was made of
graſſe growing in that place, where they were beſieged,
whence it had the name alſo of Corona graminea. Now the
reaſon why they made this crowne of graſſe growing in
the place where they were beſieged, was thereby to yeeld
vp their right in that place vnto their captaine: for by that
ceremony, asPlin. l. 22. cap. 4. 
                        Pliny obſerueth, they did Terrâ &amp; ipſa altrice
humo &amp; humatione etiam cedere. And hence it is, that
in races, and the like maſteries, hee that was overcome, did
gather ſome of the graſſe of that place, and giue it vnto the
conquerour, as a token that hee did acknowledge himſelfe
conquered.Salmuth. in Pancir. l. rerū deperd. cap. de coronis. This is the reaſon of that Adage, Herbam dare
                        
.i. to yeeld the victory. Thirdly Corona civica, which was
beſtowed only vpon him, which had ſaved a citizens life,
Pigh. l. Tyrannif. though in proceſſe of time it was alſo beſtowed vpō the
L. Generall, if he ſpared a Romane citizen, when hee had
power to kill him. It was commonly made of oake; whence
it was called Corona quernea. Fourthly Corona Muralis:
                        Dion. Halicar. lib. 10. He
only was honored with this, which did firſt ſcale the wals,
&amp; enter firſt into the enimies citie: &amp; hence this crown was
cut vpon the circlet or top like vnto the battlements. Fiftly
Corona Castrenſis: This the L. Generall beſtowed on him,
which firſt entred into the enimies tents; it did beare in it
the reſemblance of a bulwarke, or at leaſt of the mound,
wherewith the bulwark was ſtrengthned; which mound
was called in Latine Vallum, and thence the crowne it ſelfe
was often called Vallaris corona. Laſtly Corona navalis,
with which hee was honoured, which firſt entred into the
enimies ſhip in a battle vpon ſea: it was portrayd with many
ſhip-beakes called in latine Roſtra,
                        Pigh. lib. tyrannif. whence the crown
it ſelfe was often called Corona Roſtrata.
