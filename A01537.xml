            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

               RIght VVorshipfull, I stood obliged to the Stock you both sprang frō, before I was able to apprehend what such obligatiō meant. Your worthy Mother was one of those that presented mee to the sacred Laver,

Neither did her kindnesse towards me then and there expire; but as it was oft renewed in her life time, when occasion thereof was offered, so it ceased not untill her selfe deceased. Shee performed one of the first religious offices for mee soone after my birth: and it was one of her last pious workes to remember me, among others whom shee had performed the like office for, at the time of her decease. Some monument of my thankfull acknowledgement hereof being desirous to have extant, whom should I addresse it unto rather than yourselves; the onely two Principalls now left of that Family? Being therefore moved to make publike two of my weake Discourses, containing the explication of two portions of Scripture, of some neere relation the one to the other; the one of them relating a

memorable example of the performance of that that is promised in the other, to wit, of Gods blessing o

                those with temporall things, that are carefull to looke after the spirituall: This of the twaine I chose the rather to present your Worships withall; partly, because at the motion of the one of you,The Worshipfull Company of Haberdashers. being then Head of that worthy Societie, which I acknowledge my selfe also a debtor unto, it was by word of mouth at first delivered; and partly also, that it may helpe (for the best also, even 
                  Genes. 35.1. 
               Iacob himselfe, in this kinde need helps) to egge you on, whom God hath blessed with so large a portion of his bounty, unto those religious offices, that by occasion of Iacobs example, men of your rancke are therein encited unto, whether risen from meane estate, as with him here it had beene, or from the first largely and liberally endowed, as your selves. The Worke indeed is growne much larger, than at first was delivered, by reason that a Question betweene us and the Romanists, concerning Mans Merit, is therein now discussed, which

was then but touched upon and pointed at only; neither the streights of time admitting over-long discourse then, nor such matter of controversie so well befitting the occasion that then was. The rest, without any materiall alteration or addition, is the same for substance that then it was. Which recommending entirely, as now it is, to your Worships, together with my Love and Christian service to you both, and mine heartie Prayers to God for the well-fare, spirituall especially, of you and yours, with the rest of the Branches of that Family, wheresoever now transplanted; I take leave of you for the present, and rest

               THese Words are parcell of a Prayer conceived by the Patriarch Iacob,
               
                  Coherence.
                in a time of distresse, after his departure from Laban, when 
                  Verse 6. tidings were brought him that his Brother Esau was comming in armes against him, with foure hundred men at his heeles.

            There is in it;
            1. A serious Protestation concerning the ground of his journey, and his leaving of Laban, to wit, 
                  Tu dixisti. Vers. 9. 
               Gods owne Word: hee had not done what hee did of his owne head, but by 
                  Chap. 31.3, 13. 
               Gods special direction: a good argument to assure him that God would therein secure him, having his Word and Warrant for the ground of his Action. 
                  Summa est Deum sequi ducem securitas. Incedit tutus qui ducem sequitur Deum. Ambr. de Abraam, l. 1. c. 2. 
               Hee walketh surely, that walketh warily: Hee walketh warily, that walketh with warrant.
            
            
               
                  Part 2.2. An humble Confession and 
                  Vers. 10. acknowledgement of Gods goodnesse towards him; illustrate and amplified by his owne unworthinesse of it; and so 
                  Indignitatis agnitio, ingratitudinis amolitio.
                a secret insinuation of his thankfulnesse for it.
            
               
                  Part 3.3. An instant suite and Supplication to God, that he would vouchsafe to stand by him in his present distresse, and 
                  Vers. 11. deliver him out of the great danger that he was in at that instant, walking in no other way, than that God himselfe had set him in.
            
               
                  Part 4.4. An Allegation of 
                  Vers. 12. 
               Gods gracious promises 
               
                  Chap. 28.14, 15. formerly made him; which might seeme likely to faile, and to be utterly frustrate, if hee were now left to the mercie of his mercilesse Brother,

                who minded nothing but the destruction of him and all his.
            The words of my Text are the second Part: And therein are these Particulars;
            1. His owne Vnworthinesse; I am not worthy:
            
            
               2. Gods Goodnesse; laid downe,2. Gods Goodnesse.
               
            
            1. In the Grounds of it, Mercie, and Truth; Mercie in promising, Truth in performing:
               
                  Grounds 2.

                     1. Mercie.

            2. In a Fruit and effect of it; Iacobs present estate, now at his returne from Laban, compared with what it was, when he went thither:
                  
                     Fruit.

               Who delivered me then, and doth yet deliver me, and I trust that he will further deliuer me againe. And againe; 2 Tim. 4.16, 17, 18. 
               The Lord stood by mee, when all forsooke me: and I was delivered out of the mouth of that Lion: Yea the Lord will deliver me from everie evill worke, and preserve me to his everlasting Kingdome.

               God and our Parents, (saith the Heathen Man) cannot bee requited.
            
            
               
                  Psal. 116.12.13. Quaerebat quid retribueret, &amp; non inveniebat. Imò quasi aliquid invenit, remā sit in actione gratiarum: nam in relatione defecit. Gratias agere licet, referre non licet: non enim potes. Aug. in Psal. 44. 
               David sought sometime how he might; but but he could not devise how. 
                  Quid dicam aliud quam gratias gratiae ejus? Nos enim gratias agimus: non damus, nec reddimus, nec referimus, nec rependimus gratiam. Idem in Psal. 88. 
               Thankes alone hee could returne (a poore requitall) and no more.
            Where againe observe we a second Practise of Gods people;
                  Observ. 2.
               When the godly repaire to God for ought by Prayer, they are ever confessing and acknowledging their owne vilenesse and basenesse, their inabilitie and weaknesse, their indignitie and unworthinesse.

            1. Their vilenesse and abominablenesse by reason of Sinne. In regard whereof,

               Regard, O Lord, in me not my worke, but thine owne: for if thou regardest my work, thou damnest mee; if thine owne worke, thou crownest me. Since that whatsoever good I have, I have it from thee: and it is therefore rather thine than mine. For 
                  Rom. 7.18.

            2. Their poorenesse and unprofitablenesse even in the good that they doe or have.
            
            1. The poorenesse and imperfection of that grace and goodnesse that is yet in them, and of all that they doe consequently, while they live here. For our sanctification is here but in part. As 1 Cor. 13.9. 
               we know but in part: so we are purged but in part. 
                  Philip. 3.12. 
               I am not yet perfect, saith the Apostle. And, 
                  Prov. 21.9. 
               who can say, I have so clensed mine heart, saith Salomon,
               
                  Consider. 2. 
               that I am wholly free from sinne? Yea as

               the most that any know is the least of that they know not: so the most of the sanctifying Grace that wee have, is the least (for the most part) of that that wee want and should have. There are reliques and remainders of the old man still even in the best. They are not so

                  Psal. 7.3, 4, 8. &amp; 17.3. &amp; 26.1, 2, 3. just apologie, or

            And howsoever therefore we may likewise on the like occasions doe the like, so be we remember withall to doe it also in the like manner as they did: Yet 
                  Eccles. 5.1, 2. we must take heed how we offer to presse over-boldly and presumptuously into Gods presence; lest as Iacob speaketh else-where, and upon another occasion, 
                  Gen. 27.12. 
               we

bring a curse upon our selves in stead of a blessing. Rather

            Thirdly, this directly crosseth and controlleth that Popish conceit of Merit, properly so termed, of matter of worth and desert in Man. Non sum dignus; I am not worthy of ought;
                  Vse 3. saith Iacob: and 
                  Legatur Chrysost. in Matth. hom. 3. &amp; hom. 25. &amp; tom. 8. Serm. 16. it is the common and generall note (as you have heard) of Gods Servants. Whereas our Romanists teach their followers to plead to God for themselves, as the Iewes did sometime for the Centurion to our Saviour; 
                  Luk. 7.4. 
               Dignus est; He is worthy; he deserveth, that thou shouldest doe this for him. 
               
                  Apoc. 4.11. 
               Dignus es: Thou art worthy to receive honour and glory; sing the Saints of God to God. But, Digni sumus: We are worthie; doe they sing, and teach theirs so to sing: Wee are worthie, that God should conferre honour and glory on us: We deserve by our well-doing, not grace only, but glory too, even eternall glorie: And

                much more then any temporall benefits &amp; blessings whatsoever, that come farre short of either. 
                  Psal. 115.1. 1 Cor. 15.10. They give all to God: these take all to

themselves. There is on their parts nothing but indignitie with the one; nothing but condignitie with the other. Iacob deemeth himselfe unworthie of ought; and they esteeme themselves Worthy of the Crowne; worthie of the Kingdom; worthie of Heaven; worthie of Salvation; worthie of God himselfe; as meriting and deserving all this Rhemists on 2 Thess. 1.5. &amp; Apoc. 3.4. 
               worthie of any thing. There was nothing that he could; and there is nothing but that they doe, or can deserve it at Gods hands. He knoweth not how to requite what alreadie hee hath received: they are able not to requite it only, but to merit also much more. A strange presumption, whereby men dare arrogate &amp; ascribe that unto themselves, that none of Gods holy ones, whose stories are recorded in Gods word, ever did, or durst doe.
            Take we Example in this kinde, but by one of them for all. Iob, the only man of note in the time he lived in, for

                  Quoniam misericordia nobis necessaria est, August. in Iob 9. 
               For it is mercie that we stand in need of, saith Augustine: it is that that must stand us then in stead. Since that,

               All mans Righteousnesse will appeare to be but unrighteousnesse, saith Gregorie, if it should strictly be examined. And 
                  Prece igitur post justitiam indiget, ut quae succumbere discussa poterat, ex sola judicis pictate convalescat, Gregor. ibid.
                
               therefore for all a mans righteousnesse he had need yet to pray; that, that that might in such strict triall faile, may by his Iudges mercie alone hold out and be made good. For it is all one, saith he, as if Iob had there said, 
                  Velut si apertius fateatur dicens; Etsi ad opus virtutis excrevero, ad vitam non ex meritis, sed ex venia convalesco. Idem ibidem.

up and attaine to good workes, yet it is not of merit, but of mercie, that I doe atchieve life. And such

               Prayer therefore must we leane unto, even when we doe well, that even all our holy life may be seasoned with humilitie: Which the contrary presumption belike then of merit, desert, worth, and dignitie, is in Gregories judgement a great enemie unto.
            But so absurd and even sottish is the Popish Doctrine in this Point, that some of their chiefe Champions, as halfe ashamed of it, seeke sometime to qualifie it, and sometime flatly deny it.
            Sometime, I say, they seeke to temper, and to qualifie, and to correct it, as Apothecaries doe 
                  Nam &amp; ipsa venena inferūtur medicamentis. Isidor. Orig. lib. 12. cap. 4. 
               poisons, when in desperate cases they minister them, to trie Conclusions with forlorne Patients. Thus Bellarmine having at large discussed the Point; laid downe a good distinction for the cleering of the difference between us and them, when we say, that 
                  Calvinus docet nullam in proprijs meritis fiduciam esse locandam. Institut. l. 3. c. 12. §. 3, 4. 
               No Confidence is to be put in Mans Merits; and they say, 
                  Nos aliquam etiam in meritis poni posse docemus. Bellar. de Iustif. l. 5. c. 7. that some may be; to wit, that 
                  Aliud est fiduciā nasci ex meritis: aliud in meritis ponēdam. Bellar. ibid.
                it is one thing for Confidence to be put in them, and another thing for Confidence to arise from them: and with a trembling kinde of assertion affirmed the former, that not onely Confidence may arise from them; but that 
                  In bonis meritis, quae verè talia esse compertum sit, fiducia aliqua collocari potest, modò superbia ca

               some Confidence also may be placed in them, if men be certaine that they are such, and so that they be not proud of them: (And yet how sorteth this their doctrine, I pray you, with their Prayers, where they say;

               God, that seest that we trust in nothing that we doe? Or what is this then, but even to

mocke God to his face, when they tell him they doe not that, which indeed they doe?) At length hee commeth to conclude that wee have the safest course on our side. As 
                  Vtilissimū est coram Deo non justitiā praetendere, sed misericordiam postulare, Bern. ep. 41. 
               it is the best and behouefullest course; saith Bernard, not to pretend merit, but to request mercie: So it is the surest and the safest course, saith Bellarmine, not to trust in any worke or worth of our owne, but to rely wholly vpon Gods mercie. For, 
                  Propter periculum inanis gloriae, et incertitudinem justitiae nostrae; Tutissimum est fiduciam totam in sola Dei misericordia &amp; benignitate reponere, Bellar. de Iustis. lib. 5. c. 7. 
               In regard, saith hee, of the uncertaintie of our owne righteousnesse, and the jeopordie of vaine-glorie, it is the safest course for a man to repose his whole trust in the mercie and goodnesse of God alone. And hee produceth to this purpose the speeches and practises of diuers holy men of God lying vpon their death-beds: (as indeed the most, euen Papists also, yea and some Popes too, whatsoeuer they were taught or held otherwise while they lived, are glad (to preuent the worst) to die Protestants in this Point, and to renounce all their pretended merits, worth, and works then, when they should stand them most in stead:) For so Ambrose at point of death, saith hee, spake to his people; 
                  Non sic vixi, ut me pudeat inter vos vivere: nec mori timeo, quia bonum Dominū habemus, Paulin. in vit. Am.
                
               I haue not so lived among you, that I should bee ashamed to liue longer with you: nor am I afraid to die, because we have a good Master. Which speech of his Augustine used much to admire and commend; affirming that Ambrose so said, 
                  Ne crederetur praefidens de suis purgatissimis moribus praesumere, Possidon. in vit. Aug.
                
               that hee might not be thought presumptuously to put confidence in his course of life and carriage, though neuer so pure. So Augustine likewise himselfe to his Adversaries;

               I confesse, saith hee, that I am not worthy of, nor can by mine owne merits obtaine the kingdome of heauen: But my Lord Iesus Christ, who holdeth it by a double right, the inheritance of his Father, and the merit of his passion, contenting himselfe with the one, bestoweth on me the other. This then hath beene, by our Adversaries their owne confession, the ordinarie practice of Gods people, even the greatest, the godliest, the worthiest of them. And can we imagine

but that their Faith &amp; their Doctrine then at other times was correspondent thereunto? No undoubtedly. Thus they did, and thus they died themselues: and thus taught they their people to doe, and to die. Yea thus were our Ancestors here in England aboue fiue hundred yeeres agone taught to prepare themselves for death, by Anselme Archbishop of Canterburie, who then lived. Among other Questions hee willeth that this be demanded of the sicke man that lieth a dying;

               Doest thou beleeve and hope to bee saved, or to come to life eternall, not by thine owne merits, but by Christs? To which Question hee adviseth the sicke man to say, yea. And then turning his speech to him by way of instruction and exhortation;

And if God offer to iudge thee, say thou; Lord, I set the death of my Lord Iesus Christ betweene mee and thee, and thy judgement, and I will no otherwise contend with thee. If hee say, thou deservest damnation; say thou; I set the death of my Lord Iesus Christ betweene thee and mee and mine evill deserts: And I tender the merits of his most worthie passion in stead of the merit that I should have, but (alas) have not. This then was the Doctrine and practise of those Ancient Fathers; and this it was that our Ancestors &amp; Forefathers were taught, contrary to that that the Church of Rome teacheth and maintaineth at this day. Yea this, that fire-brand of the Christian world, Pope Hildebrand

               Mans merits are ordinarily very uncertaine; yea so uncertaine, that without speciall revelation a man can haue no assured certaintie of them. So that our fault belike herein is onely this then, that wee are not so venturous, or foole-hardie rather, as they are.
            2. Is it a sure, yea the surest and safest course that can be, to trust in Gods mercie alone? Then is Gods mercie alone belike able to save a man

               without merits. For in vaine were it to trust in it alone, if it alone were not sufficient to save: according to that excellent saying of Bernard, speaking of those words of the Psalmist;

            3. But why should they trust thus in Gods mercy alone? or why may they not trust safely enough in their owne merits also? For so his Assertion was, that in them men might trust to; and that there was ground good enough for them so for to doe.

               because a man may be mistaken in it, and imagine that he hath it, when he hath not. But certaine or uncertaine, how can mans merit be the ground of his salvation, if his salvation depend upon Gods mercy alone? Or how is Mans merit necessarily required unto salvation, if by Gods mercy alone he may be saved without it?

               All the Ancients with generall consent, saith Cassander, deliuer, that confidence for remission of sins, and hope of pardon and life eternall, is to bee placed in Gods mercy alone and Christs merits. To which purpose also he alledgeth a place of Pope Gregorie, to this effect; 
                  Non in fletibus &amp; actibus nostris, sed in Advocati nostri allegatione confidimus, Greg. in Ezech. hom. 1. 
               We trust not in our owne teares or deeds, but in our Advocates plea. And as for trust in ought else, saith Adrian of Vtrech, who was Bishop of Rome also afterward; 
                  Sunt merita nostra veluti baculus arundineus; cui dū quis innixus fuerit, confringitur, et perforat

               Our merits are but as a staffe of reed, which if a man leane to or rely on, it knappeth asunder, and runneth thorow his hand that relieth on it. It is the surest course, saith Bellarmine; it is the only sure course, say wee, to trust onely in Gods mercie. So said the Ancients before vs (as some of their owne, you see confesse) with vs. And to teach men in stead of it to trust in their owne merits, is to teach them 
                  Bain. spirit. Armor.
                to exchange a rocke for a reed. Nor can there be any safety at all in so doing; unlesse it bee safe to rely on so deceitfull and dangerous a stay as is sure to serue them all (by their owne Adrians confession) that trust thereunto, as

               such workes have a kinde of infinitnesse (or infinit worth) in them, and consequently an equalitie with the wrong, that they did God by their sinnes, in sundry places hee himselfe avoweth: which what is it but to merit remission of sinnes? For hath not hee merited remission that hath made such satisfaction?
            Yea the Obiection being made, that then 
                  Vel sunt duae satisfactiones simul junctae, una Christi, altera nostra; vel una tātum. Si duae, ergo bis punitur eadem culpa. Si una tantum, vel illa est Christi, &amp; tunc nos non satisfacimus; vel nostra, &amp; tunc excluditur Christus; aut verè di

               either there must be two joynt satisfactions, the one Christs, and the other ours; or but one only; and that either Christs, and then we doe not satisfie; or ours, and then Christs is excluded; or else wee divide the honour betweene Christ and our selves, that he pay for the fault, and we for the punishment: The Cardinall saith, that hereunto three Answers are given.
            For 1. some say 
                  Quidam asserunt esse unam tantum, &amp; illā Christi esse; ac nos propriè non satisfacere, sed solum facere aliquid, cujus intuitu Deus applicat nobis Christi satisfactionem. Ita Michael Baius de Indulg. cap. ult.
                that there is one only satisfaction, and that is Christs: and that we, to speak properly, doe not satisfie at all, but only doe somewhat in regard whereof God applieth Christs satisfaction to us: And 
                  Quod est dicere, Nostra opera non esse nisi conditiones, sine quibus non applicaretur nobis Christi satisfactio, vel ad summum, esse dispositiones.
                
               so, saith hee, should our workes

bee nothing but conditions, or dispositions at most, without which Christs satisfaction should not be applied to us. That which is indeed in effect the same that we say. But 
                  Quae sentētia erronea mihi videtur, Bellarm. ibid.
                this hee holdeth to be erronius.
            
            2. Some say, that 
                  Alij dicunt quod sunt duae, sed una ab altera dependens.
                
               there are two satisfactions, but the one depending vpon the other; the one Christs, and the other ours: 
               
                  Nam etiāsi una sufficiat, tamen ad majorem gloriam Dei, cui satis fit, &amp; majorem honorem hominis satisfacientis, placuit Christo conjungere nostram.
                
               for though the one were sufficient; yet for greater honour to us, God will have ours added to his. And 
                  Qui modus non videtur mihi improbabilis, Bel. ibid.
                this hee holdeth to be not improbable.
            
            3. Some say, and 
                  Tertius modus videtur probabilior; quod una tantū sit actualis satisfactio, et ea sit nostra, Bellar. ibid.
                that is the more probable, (and that therefore hee goeth with) that there is but one actuall satisfaction alone, and that ours. 
               
                  Et tunc Christus excluditur.
                
               And so Christ consequently is excluded, &amp; shut out at doores, as in the Obiection before was said. Yea hee saith moreover, that as 
                  Non erit absurdū si Sancti viri Redemptores nostri esse dicantur, cum aliquo modo passionibus suis delicta nostra possint redimere. Bellarm. de Indulg. l. 1. c. 4. 
               the Saints may well be tearmed our redeemers, because that by their sufferings they may redeeme or buy out our sinnes: So 
                  Homo sui ipsius Redemptor &amp; Salvator appellatur: nec propterea ulla fit Christo injuria. Idem de Purgat. lib. 1. cap. 14. 
               a man may well be said to be his owne Redeemer and Saviour, and yet no wrong therein done to Christ, when by his owne works 
                  Condignè satisfacit. Ibid. cap. 13. hee maketh condigne satisfaction to God in this manner for his sinnes.
            
            And now judge you, whether Philip Melanchthon lied or no, when he said (if at least he did so say) that they will men to merit remission of their sinnes by their workes. But let vs heare further how not Melanchthon, but Bellarmine lieth himselfe, where hee chargeth Melancthon
               
with lying.

               Wee teach not, saith hee, that by workes done without faith or Gods free helpe, men may merit remission of sinnes. 
               
                  Huc accedit, quod istis etiam operibus, quae fiunt ex fide et auxilio Dei, non tale tribuimus meritum, ut ei respōdeat ex justitia merces; sed meritum solum impetrationis, ut Augustinus loquitur, quod Scholastici meritum de congruo, non de cō
                     digno nominare solent. Bellar. ibid.
                
               Nor doe wee ascribe even unto those workes that are done of Faith and by Gods aid, such a merit, as that the reward doth of justice or right answer it; (that is, the merit of condignitie) but the merit of impetration onely, as. Augustine speaketh; which the Schoolemen are wont to call not the merit of condignitie, but the merit of congruitie.

Wherein Bernard singularly well expounding their meaning, and his owne too, where hee useth those and the like tearmes;

               ▪ that with such sacrifices God is delighted, or pacified, as Chrysostomes Commentarie hath it, (though indeed in Chrysostomes Cōmentarie, there no is such word, or any one word of exposition, but the same word it selfe onely) or is pleased, (well-pleased, it is word for word in the Originall) as Oecumenius expoundeth it. And

               it signifieth, saith he, that God is delighted in good workes, and is therewith conciliated, (that is, moved to befriend, as wee say) and induced thereby to doe good unto those that doe well. Which is that that wee meane, when wee say that workes are meritorous. Well it were indeed if they either meant or main-maintained no no more than is here said. Little

controversie would there then be betweene us and them.
            But to let these things passe, lest I be in this point over-long. Doe all Catholikes deny indeed even to workes done of faith and grace all merit of condignitie? And is there no difference at all among them herein? Yea doth not Bellarmine himselfe maintaine the

               ▪ And Bellarmine himselfe, though a little qualifying it, both alloweth and defendeth it, 
                  Si de reipsa agatur, admitti potest Imagines posse coli impropriè vel per accidens, eodem genere cultus, quo exemplar ipsum colitur, &amp;c. Bellar. de cult Sanct. l. 2. c. 23. that by accident, or improperly they may bee and are so worshiped; to wit, either

               as those Images are Gods or Christs Deputies, and so receiue for God or Christ himselfe the worship due to either; or

Because our Writers justly tax them for extreame arrogance therein: Bellarmine here flatly denieth it, and saith that none of them maintaine it, and wee doe but bely them in charging them with it.

                  ceede from charitie, and be done for Gods sake. So that not onely the whole course and tenour of a godly mans life uprightly and religiously led, being laid altogether in one lumpe, but every particular such action of it, considered alone by it selfe, should by this their doctrine deserve no lesse than heauen at Gods hands. And then belike so oft as they haue done any good worke meerely for Gods sake, so oft haue they deserved an heaven at least of him. It were absurd and senslesse for a sorry begger to imagine (that I may use Bellarmines owne comparison) that by weeding though a whole day in the Kings garden at White-hall, he had in regard of the worth of the worke done by him, deserved an hundred

Iacobusses, because his Majestie had promised for his dayes worke to give him such wages. 
                  Si opus aliquod sit multo inferius mercede ex conventione promissa, ut si Dominus vineae cō
                     duceret operarios, &amp; nō denarium diurnum, sed centum nummos aureos pro mercede promitteret, non esset meritum ex condigno ratione operis, Bellar. de Iustific. l. 5. c. 17. 
               Bellarmine himself wil not deny it. But it were much more absurd for such an one to imagine, that for every weed that in that his daies worke hee had pulled up (were it done out of never so much love to his Soveraigne) he had deserved, I say not an Earledome, or a Dukedome, but a Crowne at least or a Kingdome. And yet is there farre greater disproportion heere betweene the worke that we doe, and the reward that wee expect, than could there be betweene the worke and the wages: Since that

               though the godly have done a whole million of good deeds, saith Chrysost. yet that such a crowne, such an heaven, and so great honour should for so small pidling matters (in comparison thereof) be conferred on them, it is of Gods free grace, and (as he there also implieth) not of due debt, or of their desert. For,

               each (if they thinke at least as they teach) that a man may in much lesse than halfe a daies space doe that, that shall merit more than a thousand thousand yeeres, even an eternall abode in heaven. Chrysostome thought a man could not

with a million of good workes doe that, that they thinke they can doe with any one alone. For, so many thousands of them, saith he, cannot in justice deserve the Kingdome of Heaven. Any one alone, say they, of those that we doe, can doe it. Iacob deemed himselfe unable with all that hee had done or could doe, to requite those favors, even in his temporall estate, that God had conferred upon him: These men hold that they can by some one good deed of theirs alone, not requite God onely for what they have alreadie received of him, (for

            Thus we have seene, both what they hold, howsoever they seeme sometime ashamed of it, and therefore one while deny, what another while they affirme: As also how contrary their presumptuous conceits and positions in this kinde are to the humble confessions &amp; acknowledgements of Gods sincere Servants, as well recorded in the Word, as reported else-where, yea

            The Grounds of it are two;

            His mercie in promising what he had now performed; his truth in performing and making good what hee had promised.
            
               
               
                  Ground 1. Gods Mercie.
               First, his Mercie: where observe wee that whatsoever wee have or hope from God, it is all of meere mercie.

               Now this point, that all that wee either receiue or expect is of Gods mercie, howsoever it be by the former consideration sufficiently confirmed. For 
                  Vise August. supr. de verb. Ap. Serm. 2. if we be not worthie of ought, then is nothing of merit. And if nothing of merit, then all consequently of mercie.

                  The manner of Gods promises, and
                  The prayers of Gods Saints.

For which cause also he addeth, In Christ Iesus our Lord.

                  Rhem. in Hebr. 6.10. our Rhemists before affirmed that hee should.

                  Psal. 13.5. 
               I will hope in thy mercie: that I pleade and alledge, and that doe I hang all mine hope upon. And, 
                  Psal. 4.2. 
               Have mercy on me, and heare mee; and, 
                  Psal. 6.2. 
               Have mercy on mee for I am weake. And, 
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , Chrysost. in Psal. 6. 
               The same song, saith hee, have we need to sing every one of us, albeit we had done ten thousand times ten thousand good deeds, and attained even to the very highest pitch and perfection of righteousnesse:

               hee desireth to be heard, saith Cassiodore, not according to his merits, but for Gods mercie sake: whereon when our hope is fixed, pardon is the easilier obtained. And, 
                  Psalm. 119.41. 
               Let thy mercie also betide me, and thy salvation, according to thy Word.

               When hee saith, For thy goodnesse, his meaning is, and he would so be understood, Not for my merit; saith Cassiodore. Who thence also observeth that,

               No man without grievous errour, may presume at any time thereon. And yet againe; 
                  Psal. 31.3. 
               For thy Name sake guide and conduct me.

               For thy Name, not for my merit; saith Augustine, and Hugh the Cardinall after him:

               Not for my worth, desert, or dignitie, but for thy glory. And Hilarie on those words of his, 
                  Psal. 119.149.

               Whereas David after all his heartie crying, his night watchings, his early meditations, his continencie in his younger yeeres, his diligent enquirie into Gods Statutes, and his carefull keeping of his Testimonies, having attained to a perfection in all kinde of goodnesse, yet hath his hope wholly in God,

and expecteth all from his mercie, placeth all his hope in it, and desireth to bee heard according to it. And Chrysostome preaching upon the Prayer of Eleazer, entreating 
                  Gen. 24.12. 
               mercie and kindnesse for his Master Abraham; (See Sermon on Eleazers Prayer. and whose merits might better have beene pleaded than his?)

               Though we had done ten thousand good deeds, saith he, yet is it of grace that wee require to be saved, and of loving kindnesse, not of debt or desert that wee looke to receive this. So the Apostle; 2 Tim. 1.16, 17. 
               The Lord shew mercie to Onesiphorus his family. (The Lord shew him mercy, because hee shewed mee mercie.) For hee often refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chaines; but when hee was at Rome he diligently sought mee and found mee; and in how many things hee steeded mee (or supplied mee) at Ephesus, thou well knowest. And, 
                  Ibid. 18. 
               the Lord grant therefore, that hee may finde mercy with the Lord in that day.

               That as I found mercie with him, so may hee finde mercie with God; saith Chrysostome: And marke you, saith hee, how hee saith, 
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

                  , Chrysost. ibid.
                
               if Onesiphorus for

all these his good workes, wee (the most of us) much more. There is mercie as well for those that holpe him, as 2 Tim. 4.14, 16. Aliter enim de eis, qui ex malitia obstiterant; aliter pro eis, qui ex infirmitate deliquerant, uti &amp; Aug. observat in Josh. quaest. 30. 
               for those that forsooke him; as well mercy in rewarding the one, as mercie in pardoning and not punishing the other. So Daniel also, 
                  Dan. 9.18. Vide Hug. Card. in Iob 9.21. 
               We present these our prayers unto thee, not for any our righteousnesse, (that is, any righteous workes of ours;

               for we have none, saith Gregorie Nazianzene; such at least as we dare pleade the worth of) but for thy tender mercies. Whereupon also saith Aquinas, 
               
                  Impetratio orationis innititur misericordiae; meritum autē condigni innititur justitiae. Et ideò multa orando impetrat homo ex divina misericordia, quae tamen non meretur secundum justitiam, Tho. sum. part. 1a. 2ae. q. 114. a. 6. 
               Obtaining by prayer indeed resteth upon mercie; where as merit of condignitie resteth upon justice or righteousnesse: and therefore by prayer doe men obtaine many things of God in mercie, which yet in justice they deserve not. Yea so the Papists themselves in their Liturgie, (retaining yet still some broken relikes of Antiquitie) contrarie to their Schoole-learning, desire God 
                  Non meriti aestimator, sed veniae largitor, Missal. in post-commun.
                
               not to ponder their merits, but to pardon their misdeeds; and so consequently 
                  Psal. 65.3. 
               to be mercifull (as the Psalmist speaketh) to their sinnes. And, a Popish Writer commenting upon that place;

               What merit, saith he, can wee pretend or pleade to God, whom we owe all unto? Or how can we applaud our selves in our good deedes, when all our righteousnesse is but as a filthie ragge in Gods sight? Our merits therefore are none to God, whom all that we doe, is due unto, &amp;c. And it is a good Rule that Bernard giveth for

               Hee that commeth, saith hee, to aske ought of God, must in the first place have an eye unto this, that hee looke not to receive ought for his owne worth or merits, but hope to obtaine whatsoever he craves, onely of Gods mercie. And when we come to pray (saith Aquinas) we must

            It is all of mercie therefore, that God promiseth: It is all of mercie that Gods children pray for. It is

               They are the children, saith Iacob, that God hath of his mercie given thy Servant. And, 
                  Gen. 33.11. 
               God hath beene mercifull to me: and therefore have I all this. And heere in my Text; All the mercies, that thou hast shewed me. Even 
                  Iusti nihil tribuent meritis suis. Nō tribuent nisi totum misericordiae tuae, Aug. in Psal. 139. 
               the Iust, saith Augustine, will ascribe nothing to their merits, but give all onely to Gods mercie. For,

               All is taken from the one, that is ascribed to the other, saith Bernard.

               Truth hath here reference to a word of promise.
               
And wee may doe well to observe how these two are still coupled and yoaked together, Mercie and Truth. 
               
                  Psal. 25.10. 
               All the waies of God are Mercie and Truth, saith the Psalmist; and that even to those that keepe covenant with him. And, 
                  Psal. 36.5. 
               Thy Mercie, O Lord, reacheth unto the heavens, and thy Truth or Faithfulnesse unto the clouds. And, 
                  Psal. 40.11. 
               withdraw not thy tender Mercies from me, O Lord: but let thy Mercie and thy Truth alwaies preserve me. And, 
                  Psal. 138.2. 
               I will praise thee for thy Mercie and thy Truth, &amp;c. The one is the ground of Gods gracious promises: the other is the ground of the performance of what therein he hath promised. It is his Mercie that hee doth ought at first, and that he promiseth further to doe ought, And it is his Truth and his Iustice, (for 
                  Ephes. 4.24, 25. Veritas, sive veracitas pars est justitiae. Ex Cicer. de Invent. Thom. sum. part. 2•.2ae. q. 109. a. 3. 
               Truth is a part also of Iustice) that he performeth and maketh good what he hath promised.
            So that here is
            
               A second ground of Gods goodnesse,

                unto those whom by promise hee hath vouchsafed to tie himselfe unto,
His Word and his Truth.
            
            
               
                  Psal. 43.3. 
               Send forth thy light and thy Truth, saith the Psalmist, to bring mee againe to thine holy Hill. And, 
                  Psal. 54.5. 
               Destroy mine enemies in thy Truth. And, 
                  Psal. 89.24, 28. 
               My Mercie and truth, saith God, shall alwaies be with him: and my covenant shall stand firme with him for ever. For, 
                  Psal. 89.33, 34. 
               I will not breake my covenant; nor will I falsifie my Truth. And, 
                  Psal. 146.5, 6. 
               Blessed therefore is the man, whose hope is in

the Lord, who keepeth his Truth for ever. It is his Mercie that moveth him; it is his Truth that bindeth him. It is his Mercie, I say, that induceth him to promise: it is his Truth that obligeth him to make good what hee hath promised. A sure tie-all. 
                  Mark. 13.31. 
               Heaven and earth may faile sooner than Gods Truth; than 
                  Iosh. 23.14. hee should faile to make good ought that he hath promised to his.
            For first, it is against the very nature of God to doe otherwise.

               Popish writers are wont to abuse and produce for the justification of their pernicious Positions concerning mans merit, and the worth of mens workes. As if in those places Gods children pleaded unto God their owne merits, in regard whereof God in iustice might not deny them their suits, they requiring nothing but what by their owne righteous actions they had even in justice deserved at Gods hands: Or as if Gods justice it selfe so tied him to the rewarding of their workes, in regard of the very worth and dignitie of them, that God could not without some taint of injustice doe otherwise. But

            But what justice or righteousnesse will some say, then is it?
            I answer: It is sometime

            Sometime it is Gods justice and righteousnes, that is, his Truth, or his Faithfulnesse; which the Psalmist therefore 
                  Psal. 143.1. joyneth together, (it is

               truth or faithfulnesse is (as before was said) a branch and a limme of justice or righteousnesse. That which even our Adversaries themselves also confesse &amp; acknowledge, expounding some such places so also themselves. 1 Iohn 1.9. 
               If wee confesse our sinnes, saith S. Iohn, God is faithfull and just to forgive us our sinnes, and to cleanse us (how but by

               there seemeth to bee no promise at all extant in Scripture concerning remission of sinnes upon confession of them made unto God. In like manner where the Apostle saith, 
                  Hebr. 6.10. 
               For God is not unjust, to forget your worke and

labour of love, which you shew to his Name, in ministring to his Saints.

               He sheweth manifestly, saith Bellarmine, that hee should be unjust, if hee did otherwise. And therfore

               It is not his owne righteousnesse, but Gods righteousnesse, saith Bernard, that the Apostle here buildeth upon. For it is a just thing for God to pay that that hee oweth. And hee oweth that that he hath promised.

               God, saith hee, albeit hee be debtor to none, yet hath hee made himselfe a debtor to us. But how? Not by receit, but by promise. Not by receiving of ought from us; but by promising what hee pleased and thought good himselfe unto us. In regard whereof very pithily and piously saith Bernard, 
               
                  Ius meum voluntas judicis mei. Quid justius meritum? Quid ditus ad praemium? Bern. in Cant. 14. Et Chrysost. in Psalm. 143.

In the one, the ground of the debt ariseth from the worke or deed and desert of the partie that claimeth it: in the other, from the word and promise of him, of whom it is claimed,

            THE IVDGEMENT OF a great Schoole-man, concerning the Merit of mans workes; contrarie to that which the Church of Rome now holdeth▪ 
               Durandus in Sentent. lib. 2. dist. 27. quaest. 2.
            
               MErit of condignitie strictly and properly taken, is such a voluntarie action for which in justice or of right a reward is due to one, so that if it be not rendered, he that should render it doth wrong, and is simply and properly unjust. And such merit of condignitie is found among men, but is not in man towards God.
            That which hereby appeareth, because that which is rendered rather out of the liberalitie of the giver, than out of any debt due to the worke, commeth not within the compasse of Merit of condignitie strictly and properly taken.
            But whatsoeuer wee receive from God, be it grace

or glorie, or good temporall, or spirituall (whatsoever good worke done for the same goe before in us) we receive rather and more principally from Gods liberalitie, than rendered as due for the desert of the worke.
            And therefore nothing at all commeth within compasse of Merit of condignitie so taken.
            The Major appeareth by the definition of Merit of condignitie before assigned.
            The Minor is thus proved: because it is an easier and a lesse matter to make a full recompence for that that one hath received from another, than to make him a debtor. For to make him a debtor, it is necessarie that one returne him more than hee hath received from him, that so in regard of that overplus the other may become his debtor.
            But no man can fully recompence God; according to that which the 
                  Aristot. Ethic. lib. 8. cap. 14. Philosopher saith, That God and our Parents can never bee sufficientlie recompenced.
            Therefore much lesse is it possible, that by any worke of ours God should become debtor to us, so that hee should be injust, if he paid us not somewhat for it, that were due unto us for the same.
            The reason hereof is, because what wee are, and what wee have, be it good actions, or good dispositions, or the use of them, &amp;c. it is all in us of Gods liberalitie, both freely bestowing it on us, and freely preserving it in vs. And because by a free gift no man is bound to give more: but the receiver rather is thereby bound to the giver.
            Therefore by good dispositions, or good actions, or

the good use of either bestowed on us by God, God is not bound in any bond of justice to give us ought else, so that if hee should not give it, he should be unjust; but wee are rather thereby bound to God. And to thinke or say the contrary, is bold and blasphemous. And if God therefore to a man dying in grace should deny glorie, hee should doe therein no wrong: nor should hee be unjust, if hee should withdraw glory from one that alreadie hath it. And if any should complaine hereof, God might say unto him, as it is in the Gospell, 
                  Math. 20.15▪
                May I not doe as I will with mine owne? And the partie that should suffer it, ought to say as Iob did, 
                  Iob 1.21. The Lord hath given, and the Lord hath taken; hee hath done as he pleased: blessed be his Name. For since that every good thing is of Gods free gift, God is not bound thereby, because hee hath given some thing, to give other some also, so that hee should be unjust, if hee gave them not. And if any thing bee bestowed on us, or returned to us for our good workes, it is rather and more principally out of Gods liberalitie that giveth it, than out of any debt that is due to our workes.
            If any shall say, that albeit God become not a debtor by any worke of ours, yet hee becometh a debtor by his owne promise 
                  Iam. 1.12. expressed in Scriptur.
            It is of no force, for two causes:
            The first is, because Gods promise in Scripture implieth no such obligation, but importeth onely a liberall disposition in God.
            The second is, because that which is rendered, is

not rendered for the due desert of the worke, but for the promise precedent. It is not, I say, rendered, for the condigne merit of the worke, but onely or principally for the promise: And so it is not such debt, as we now speake of.
            Thus it appeareth that Merit of condignitie strictly and properly taken, to wit, for a voluntarie action, for which a reward is of justice due to the doer, so that if it be not paid, hee that should pay it, doth wrong, and is simply and properly unjust; is not in man towards God, yea that it is altogether impossible for any such to be.
            FINIS.
