            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

            TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFVLL SIR HENRY YELVERTON Knight, one of the Iustices of his Maiesties Court of Common Pleas.
            
            
               RIGHT WORSHIPFVLL;
            
            
               YOVR speciall interest in that worthy Seruant of Christ, whom this weak work concerneth, by your singular fauours to him and his deseruedly procured, cānot but giue you interest in the worke it selfe before any. Vnto your Worship therefore I addresse

and direct it, as to one that may iustly lay best claime to it: Not doubting but that, as you did in more than ordinary manner respect his person while he liued, so you do no lesse honour the memory of him now deceased. The worke I wish were worthy either you or him. But, how little time I had for the composing and peecing vp of these broken Meditations, cannot be vnknowne to those, &amp; from them may be made knowne to others, that either sent or brought me the first word of his decease, being newly allighted from a wearisome iourney, not aboue two daies before the Funerall was to be performed. Besides that so sudden and vnexpected tidings of the losse of so deare a Friend, causing much griefe and distractiō, could not but produce withall as great an indisposition to the minding of that that this office imposed on me did necessarily require of me; and defeat consequently that second

               oares, when the wind slacketh or scanteth) to redeeme the want of time with. That which made me (as conscious of the rawnesse of it) the more backward at

first to yeeld to the importunitie of those, (not a few) who both by letters and by word of mouth were very instant and vrgent for the publishing of it. Nor haue I had much loisure since to reuise and digest my confused notes; nor yet desire to adde or alter much, lest (to those that then heard it) it might seeme not the same. One short passage or two onely I haue inserted, that my memory then failed me in. Else the substance of all here was then deliuered. Which if, especially in the Testimony then giuē vnto him, whom this office was performed vnto, it seeme slight and slender, to that it ought or might haue beene: Besides the former considerations, which might well sufficiently excuse, let it be remembred; what a great Oratour sometime said, that Pictores pulchrā absolutam

Howbeit this may bide, when they are gone. Which whatsoeuer it is, presuming that your Worship will accept of, if not for it owne sake, yet for his, who liueth yet with you, and you desire (I know) should doe so also with others, I recommend it to your patronage, and your selfe with all yours to the protection of him who hath promised to be

If any demand proofe hereof: not to insist vpon his constant and incessant imploiments, with generall approbation and applause both of religious and iudicious, continued for so many yeeres (as was before said) together, not a Sabbath intermitted, wherein (if health serued) he preached not twise, either in his owne charge (where he was frequentest) or elsewhere abroad; besides his catechisings of the younger sort at certaine times in the weeke dayes, and other such offices as to the pastor all function are necessarily annexed, and are priuately to bee performed; wherein also he was no lesse diligent than in the execution of his publike Ministery.

And therfore also was this our Brother so desirous of recouery, that he might repaire to Gods house againe, that he might returne to Gods worke againe.

Ephes. 1. 11. his will appeareth by his worke) to put an end to his incessant labours here, and to translate him to the place of his endlesse rest else where. The gaine is his; the losse ours, min

            ABRAHAMS DECEASE.
            
               GEN. 25. 8.

                  good old age, an old man, and full of yeeres; and he was gathered to his people.
            
            
               BEfore was a long discourse 
               Abrahams Death. of Abrahams life: here is a report in few words of his death.
            
            Wherein (to come to Of it foure Particulars. them directly without further preface, because much time is already spent) wee may consider these particulars:

                  Quô, Whither. 
               Whither he went when he died.
            
               
               First, who died; Abraham. Particular

            For who might sooner or better haue expected to haue beene freed from it then Abraham? Abraham (I say) Gen. 20. 7.

            Now the reason why the godly die as well as the wicked, is,
            First, if we regard naturall causes, 
               Natural. 1.
            
            1. Because they are made of the same mould and mettall that others are: 2 Cor. 4. 7. 
               We haue this treasure (saith the Apostle) in

            2. Because they are subiect to the same casualties that others are. For, Eccles. 9. 2. Cuiuis potest accidere, quod cuiquam potest. P. Syr. Spirituall 2. 
               All things come alike to all: The same 
               
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   casus. 
               chance betideth the good and the bad; the cleane and the vncleane; 
               Malac. 3. 18. 
               the sacrificer and him that sacrificeth not; 
               Zech. 5. 3, 4. Spirituall 3.

               feareth to sweare, that maketh conscience of an oath.
            
            Secondly, if we regard spirituall respects.
            
            1. The godly die also that they may rest from their labours: For, Apoc. 14. 13. 
               They rest from their labours that are deceased in Christ.
            
            2. They die that they may receiue their reward; to wit, 2 Tim. 4. 7, 8. 
               the Crowne of righteousnesse; which they must 2 Tim. 2. 5. Iam. 1. 12. not expect, till they haue

               finished their race.
            
            3. They die, that they may be rid of sinne: 
               Rom. 8. 10. 
               they die for sinne, saith the Apostle: yet not to pay for it, as the wicked doe, but to be Rom. 7. 24. 
               freed from it: For, Rom. 6. 7. 
               He that is dead, is freed from sinne.
            
            4. They die, that they may be

            Now for the vse of the Point.
            
            First, it may serue to hearten and encourage vs against the feare and dread of death. For doe all, Vse 1. euen the godly and faithfull die? Why should wee be loath to come to that, that so many Saints of God haue come to before? As Phocion said to one that was to die with him;

               Art thou not glad to fare as Phocion doth? So, why should any be loath to doe as Abraham doth? Or why should we be afraid to goe that way, that all the holy men of God haue gone before vs? It is true indeed, there might be some colourable cause of feare, if wee were to goe some

            Now this satietie and fulnesse of life commonly befalleth such;
            First, when some speciall promises of God haue beene made good to them, or some speciall Omnino rerū omnium satietas vitae facit satietatem. Vitae autem satietas tempus maturum mortis assert. Cic. de sen. 
               blessings of God enioyed by them, correspondent to their owne desires. So Simeon, when he had liued so long (Luke 2. 26. which it was foretold him he should doe) as to see our Sauiour in the flesh, he hath euen enough of this life, he desireth not now to liue an houre longer. Luke 2. 29, 30. 
               Lord (saith he) now lettest thou thy seruant depart in peace; since that mine eyes haue once seene thy saluation, my Sauiour, and the Sauiour of all mankind. So Iacob, when he saw his sonne Ioseph againe, whom he had Gen. 37. 33, 35. &amp; 42 36, 38. giuen vp for dead and gone long agoe, not aliue only, but in honour, and not him alone, but his issue too; Gen. 46. 30. 
               Let me now die; (saith he) I haue liued long enough; I desire life now no longer; since I haue seene thy face, and that thou art yet aliue. For 
               Gen. 48. 11. 
               I made full account neuer to haue seene thy face; and behold God hath made me see thy seed.
