            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

            AMong many other laudable
cuſtomes of ye noble Vniuerſitie
of Louaine, this one is yearely
obſerued there, that in ye moneth of
December al ordinarie leſsons ceaſe
for the ſpace of one whole weeke, and
in place thereof ſome Learned man
is choſen by common aſſent to be the
Preſident of certaine Diſputations:
wherein he proponeth, to ſuch as are
thereto appointed, diuerſe frutefull
queſtions in Diuinitie, Law, Phyſik
Phyloſophie, Humanitie, and in all
probable matters, making argumentes
breefly for both partes of ye queſtions,
and then leauing to ye iudgemēt

of the Reſpondent to chuſe whiche
parte he liketh beſte (whereof thoſe
exerciſes haue theyr name) and the
next daye folowing in that place to
handle the ſame Rhetoricallie the
ſpace of two houres together wtout
interruption,Diſputationes Quodlibeticae. in preſence and hering
of the whole Vniuerſitie there then
asſembled. And in this maner twiſe
a day fower houres are ſpente that
weeke, with greate profite and vtterance
of many good and profitable
maters of learning worth the hering
and bering away, though litle thereof
commonly afterward come forth
in printe, to the ſight and vewe of
the world.
            Amonge diuerſe other, this laſte
December there, a learned man toward
the Law called M. Peter Frarin

borne in Andwerp made an Oration
againſt the Inſurrections of the
Proteſtantes and Sectes of our time,
not without greate commendation,
which, at the earneſt requeſte of his
frindes, he ſuffered to be afterwarde
printed. Anh becauſe I thought it no
leſse profitable and fruteful, that, as
that Oration is in Latine, and like to
be ſhortly in Doutch and Frenche,
ſo it ſhould be in Engliſhe alſo to
warne my deere Contremen of thoſe
mens malice and cruelty: I conferred
with him, and by his aduiſe traſlated
it into our Mother tong, with ſuche
notes and farther additiōs as for lack
of tyme, whē he pronounced it, were
omitted and leafte out in the Latine.
VVherein I toke ſuch leaue and lybertie,
as the Author, with whome I

conferred, might be bolde to vſe him
ſelfe in his owne doinges, or geue an
other man, and as the Vayne of our
Engliſſhe tong ſeemed beſte to beare
in ſuch kind of talke, leauing ſometymes
the preciſe wordes of ye Latin,
but neuer ſwaruing any whit from
the truthe. And for the aſſurance
and proufe of ye matter of this whole
Treatiſe, the Author proteſteth that
he vttered nothing in all this oration
againſte any man, but that either he
ſawe with his owne eyes, or harde of
credible perſons that were preſent
at thoſe maters, or read in approued
Writers, or in theyr owne bookes
whom he chargeth, or finally that is
notoriouſly knowen to whole Cities
and Countries.
            Take therefore, I beſeeche thee

Gentill Reader, in good parte this
faire warning thou haſte here to
take heede of theſe perilouſe pretended
Refourmers▪ and weighe rather
the mater, then my rude vtterance
in Engliſſhe. And if thou be a Gentelman,
learne here what theſe mens
intent and practiſe is againſte all
noble Stockes. They meane vtterlie
to roote out ye Nobilitie and al noble
Bloud, as they haue done alreadie at
Geneua, and in thoſe Cātons of Suitzerland,
where this fifte Goſpell
reigneth.Remonſtrances au Roy des deputes des trois eſtats de Burgoigne ſur l'edict de la pacification▪ part. 2. The deputies that repreſented
the three eſtates of Burgundie
in their Diſcourſe vppon the
Frenche Kings Edicte of pacification
are my Authors of this reporte.
If thou be a Ruler and in authority,

conſyder their conſpiracies and treaſons
againſt all Magiſtrates. If thou
be a mā of the Churche, marke here
their malice and extreme crueltie
againſt all Gods true Miniſters and
Vertuous Prieſts. If thou be a faithfull
ſubiecte amonge the Commons,
ſee theyr robberies, theyr pouling
and rifling, theyr vnmercifull extorſions,
theyr vnſatiable greadines
in gatheringe to them other mens
goodes. Finallie, if thou be a true
Chriſtian man, Abhorre and deteſte
theyr VVickedneſſe, Sacrilege,
horrible blaſphemies, and impietie
againſt God and all his holy Myſteries.
To be ſhort, I truſte no man
wilbe offended with the reading of
this Oration, but only ſuch as in their

owne conſciences feele them ſelues
guyltie of theſe cōſpiracies and treaſons
herein mentioned, and therfore
ſeeme to be touched nere the quicke.
And yet perhappes, by Gods grace,
this ſoure medicine, though it ſmart,
may worke in ſome of them alſo, firſt
ſhame, then repentance, and laſt amendement
of ſuche vngodly pourpoſes
and enterpriſes, and call them
backe againe thither, wherehence
they fell, to doe their former workes,
as the Spirit of trueth ſayeth,Apoca. 2. in the
fear of God, the vnity of his Church,
obedience of theyr Princes, and charitie
with theyr neighbours. But
ſure I am, it will litle pleaſe M. Iewel
and his Companiōs, who by wryting,
preaching and printing, Firſt
prouoked with great confidence and

brags the Catholikes to wryte their
mindes in matters of controuerſie
and queſtions about Religion, wiſſhing
that the Queenes grace, (for
whome we daily pray) woulde not
onlye licenſe them, but commaunde
them to wryte: And now that diuers
haue wrytten full learnedly to their
confuſion and ſhame (meddling nothing
with the affaires and politike
Gouernment of the Realme, but only
with poyntes of Doctrine) they
haue none other way to anſwere and
make their party good, but to turne
their tale, chainge their tune, and
report that the wrytinges of the Catholikes
are ſeditious, and tende to
the diſquieting and diſturbaunce of
the Common weale, that the authors
thereof are vnnaturall and diſordered

ſubiectes: and ſo by ſuche falſe
informations labour to procure the
meanes to ſtay and let to come into
the Realme ſuche Bookes as detecte
their Vntruthe, Falſhode, and Hereſies,
and are moſt profitable for all
good Chriſtians and true Subiectes
to reade, in theſe daungerous daies.
            If they practiſe the like againſte
this little diſcourſe made againste
Commotions for Religion, they ſhall
declare plainly and make the worlde
vnderstande, that they are not true
Subiects to the Queenes Maiestie,
nor yet faithfull to the Nobilitie,
nor frindefull to the Cōmons of their
owne natiue Countrie. For here is
nothing but a Detection of falſe and
wicked Treaſons againste Princes
and Rulers, and, as it were, a holeſome

Triacle for Magiſtrates and
faithfull Subiectes, againſt the contagious
infection and daūgerous peſtilence
of rebellion. Fare well Gentle
reader, and with the manners
and behauioure thou ſeeſt in our Ministers
at home compare and laye together
theſe Straunge doinges of
their Fellowes and Companions abrode
in other Countries. So ſhalt thou
perceiue, they are of one ſprite
and ſtampe,Math. 7. and (according to the
Counſell of Chriſt the ſonne of God)
know them by their workes, as ye tree
is knowen by his frute, and by that
meanes learne to auoid them, and
beware of them.

               TWo principall thinges
in euerie Cōmon weale
haue at all tymes bene
eſpecially eſteemed and
taken for the chief. both
which now in this our
age throughout al Chriſtendom
the deſperat boldnes of certaine
moſt wicked perſons hath diſturbed: I
meane, Religion, and Peace.
            The queſtion of God allmightie his
true Religiō prophaned, I leaue to thoſe
men to handle, to whoſe cuſtodie and credite
the holy Myſteries of Chriſtian Religion
are, by the diuine Authoritie of
Gods ordinance, committed: whoſe learning,
wit, and eloquence may further
muche the defenſe of ſo weighty a mater,
whoſe Profeſſion, Authoritie and vertue,

ought to be alwaies emploied about ſuch
Godlie affaires.
            The other argument, that is, of Peace
broken by Seditions, of Publike and
good Order troubled, of Magiſtrates,
vnder pretenſe of refourmation, contemned,
of God and mans law offended and
tranſgreſſed, yt cauſe and lamētable matter
I had alſo at this time gladly omitted,
leauing it to the handling of the eloquente
and wiſe, that are practyſed in
Publike affaires, grounded in knowlege
of the lawes, and weightie Policies of
Princes: had it not bene, that I was at
this preſent firſt moued to take the ruefull
Diſcours thereof in hand by the earneſt
requeſt of ſuch, to whome lightelie,
without iuſt excuſe, I may deny nothing:
then, lead (as it were) thereto by hope
and regard of your moſt courteouſe gentellnes
and patience (right worſhipfull
Audience) and finally drawen and driuen
to ſpeake by force of the hatred I
bare to ſo vile and villanouſe a mater,
leaſt, perhaps as by mine, ſo by all other
mens ſilence ſo hainouſe a thing ſhould
haue eſcaped quite vnſpoken of.
            
               
For in very deed when I conſidered &amp;
weighed the matter wt my ſelf, mine opinion
told me thus, That this right worthy
Seat wherin I now ſtand, was wōt
alwaies to be the place opē only to moſt
eloquent Oratours, occupied moſt commōlie
by moſt graue and auncient Doctors,
whoſe accuſtomed maner hath bene
to bring hither, and to poure into your
moſt learned cares nothing but ſuch ſtuf
as was inuented by great wit, framed wt
much diligence, archeiued &amp; finiſhed with
grauitie, iudgement, arte and eloquence.
And as for me, were it ſo yt I had al other
thinges requiſite to ſuch a one that worthely
might attempt this publike exerciſe
and entrie of cōmendation in matters of
learning: yet (to ſaie the verie truthe) I
thought myne age ſcarſe ripe enough for
the graue rome of this ſo worſhipfull a
Place. And withal, beſides theſe defectes,
this alſo did put me in verie great feare,
leaſt as ſomtymes Demoſthenes, yt cheife
Pere of al Greke eloquēce, framing hym
ſelf to ſpeake in ye preſence of Philip king
of the Macedons, happened in the very
beginning of his Oration to ſtay, to lack

vtterance &amp; wordes, being aſtonied with
the Royall Maieſty of ſo great a perſonage:
ſo in like ſort I, addreſſing my ſelfe
to talke in this ſo great an aſſēble of moſt
learned Audiēce, ſhuld haue peraduēture
the very ſame, or yt like chaūce &amp; fortune.
            But this needeleſſe doubt, and feare,
proceding of the fainte &amp; baſhfull ſhamefaſtneſſe
of youth, was at length ſomewhat
diſſolued by the comfortable exhortations
of my frendes, and is now at laſt
quite remoued and put away by the moſt
chearefull ſight of this your gentle preſence
and pleaſant countenances, wherewith
I fele ſenſibly my ſelf to be maruelouſly
now refreſhed &amp; prouoked, as it
were, to ſpeake boldly &amp; with good courage.
For who wold be afraid to ſpeak of
Seditions in the preſence of ſuche quiet
perſons? Againſt treaſons, before moſte
faithful Subiects? Who would doubt in
the hearing of Officers and Magiſtrates,
to talke againſt tumultes, robbing, ſtealing,
cōſpiracies, cutting of throtes, ſpoiling
of Countreis, burning of Cities,
ſacking of Churches, wicked ſacrilege, &amp;
moſt impiouſe contempt of thinges appertaining

to God, &amp; finally againſt the
very bane and peſtilence of all commendable
alliaunce and vnitie of Common
weales, &amp; the vtter ruine and deſtruction
of all Ciuill Policy and good Order? For
what one mā of you all (right honorable
&amp; worſhipfull) wold gladly or willingly
allow and beare ſuche &amp; ſo hainous enormities
in any Realme or Country?
            I wil therfore go forward in my matter
&amp; ſpeake: yea, &amp; now hauing gathered
courage by ye aſſured hope of your gentle
patience, I wil ſay boldly, that the Proteſtantes
of our time haue not done well
in putting them ſelues in armes vnder
colour of refourming Religion: yt they
haue done therein againſt all law, right
and equitie, not without intolerable
iniury, damage and wrong in euery reſpect
to ye Publike eſtate of Chriſtendome.
In this poynt conſiſteth ye whole weight
and cōtrouerſy of the queſtion yt was yeſterday
(according to the cuſtome of this
ſchole) proponed to be the argumēt of my
talke at this time.
            I will firſt open and declare vnto you,
yt there was no cauſe or iuſt occaſion, why

theſe men ſhuld riſe &amp; make inſurrection.
            Then,1 that they toke weapon in hand
without any authority, cōtrary to law, &amp;
in deſpite of al Magiſtrates and Rulers.
            Laſt and finallie,
                  
                     •
                  
                yt they vſed thēſelues
to cruelly, &amp; handled their ſwerd to bloudily,
to the greateſt damage, hyndrance &amp;
loſſe, that euer was felt in Chriſtendome.
            With theſe limites and boundes I
make, as it were, a trauerſe and cloſe my
ſelf within a circle, out of the cumpaſſe
whereof the diſcourſe and order of my
talke ſhall not ſtraie: that by theſe meanes
both I, out of infinite matter that
offreth it ſelf in the hādling of this cauſe,
may haue certen ſpecial pointes marked
and choſen wherof I may treat, and alſo
you, euen now before hand, may forſee &amp;
beare in mynd, in hearing what things,
your learned eares are lyke to be emploied
during myne Oration.
            I deny vtterlie, yt there was any good
or reaſonable cauſe, whie the founders &amp;
brokers of this new Goſpel ſhuld be driuen
or prouoked to put them ſelues in
armes againſt the Catholikes. This is ye
firſt poynt wherof I promiſed to ſpeake.

Whiles in few wordes I declare &amp; proue
this vnto you, I humblie requeſt you, wt
diligent attention to mark and geue ear.
            It behoueth alwayes, yt there be very
great cauſes proued why, before chainge
of lawes ſhuld be in any common weale
procured: &amp; in very deed it ought to be a
maruelouſe occaſion &amp; the greateſt cauſe
of all cauſes, whie the innouation of Religion
(being alway ye very backebone of
al Realmes both Chriſtian and Heathen)
ſhuld be attempted. But that either this
or that ſhould be don by force and armes,
by warre &amp; rebellion, by fier &amp; ſwerd, by
murder and bloudſhed of the good and
faithfull Subiectes, there can neuer any
reaſon or ſufficiente cauſe be alleged or
brought why and wherefore.
            I remēber, amōg many other notable
lawes, wherwith in times paſt the Lorrenſes
ruled their cōmon weale, it was
with great policy and wiſdom ordained,
yt if any mā wold go about to procure ani
thainge in the publike affaires of yt eſtate,
he ſhuld ſtand vp in a high place, &amp; there
hence ſpeake his minde frely to the people,
being then there aſſēbled about him:

               
                  〈1 page duplicate〉
               
               
               
                  〈1 page duplicate〉
               
               
but yet with this condition, that all the
while he ſpake, he ſhould haue a rope tied
with a riding knot looſe inough about
his neck, the which rope ſhould be ſo lōg,
that the other end therof might lie on the
ground betwene their feete that hard his
diſcourſe &amp; deuiſe: to this effect, that, if in
yt end of his tale ye people wer perſwaded
that it was for their cōmon cōmodity and
profit, to make that chainge and innouation
as he had ſaid, then he ſhoulde come
downe without any harme, and be dimiſſed
with muche commendation and
fauor: els the Audience out of hād might
pull the rope and reuenge with preſent
death the raſh attempt and ſeditious enterpriſe
of ſuch a one as wythout good
cauſe, beſtowed his buſy braine about
chainges and alterations.
            If it had pleaſed the Princes and Rulers
of ye world in this our time to haue
eſtabliſhed and practiſed this lawe, we
ſhould haue no nede now to ſighe at the
ſight of ſo miſerable a confuſion, diſorder
and troublous ruffling of all things. We
ſhould not haue ſene of late, and yet ſee
this ſo lamētable an eſtate of the world.

ſo many Warres, Tumultes, Slaughters,
Ruines, ſo many Churches ſuppreſſed,
ſo many Townes ouerturned.
finally we ſhould not now rue ſo many
wicked Sacrileges cōmitted in prophaning
of Gods Myſteries, &amp; ſacred things
appertaining to his Honor and Seruice.
            But alas it was free, without any
feare of the rope for theſe authors and foſterers
of Sectes, frankly and boldly to
perſwade with the people, and beſtowe
their wordes as they liſte. And would
God they had ſtaied there, and had diſburſed
nothing but verniſhed woordes:
they wente further from Woordes to
Woundes and Blowes. They hadde
the Word in their mouthes, the Sword
in their handes: their Word ſounded
peace, theyr Sword coyned war: their
peace ſerued for a guylful cloke to couer
crafte and deceyt, their war was employed
to execute violence, crueltie and
murder. Was there none other meanes
to plant that bluddy Goſpell, but to
attēpt Reformatiō in ye ſtate of ye Churche
by ciuil warres, inſurrections and Rebellion?
Put vp thy ſword in the ſheth,

ſaied Chriſt to S. Peter: Oute with thy
ſword for the Goſpell, ſayeth the new
Goſpeller. There was a Companie of
deſperat &amp; wicked perſonnes yt ran lyke
mad men vp and down the ſtreates of
Paris with gliſtering naked ſwordes in
theyr handes,Claud. de Sainctes du Saccagement des egliſes. fol. 57. and cried out, the Goſpel,
the Goſpell: when they meant nothing
els, but to bring a ſort of curſed Sectes
and wicked Hereſies into the Realme.
            It was not (I aſſure you honorable &amp;
worſhipfull) it was not the Goſpel they
brought, except they hold it for a Goſpel
to cut in pecies, to ſacke, ſpoile and
quite to ouerthrow wt blowes &amp; naked
ſword all ye ye Euangeliſtes buylded we ye
Word. It was not Gods quarell at all:
that bloudy bickering was neuer taken
in hand for Gods ſake. And in this behalf
I call to wittnes euen the ſelf ſame
man, that was our moſt earneſt &amp; fierce
aduerſarie in this queſtion, who was ye
occaſion of al our calāmitie, and was the
Author and maker of this lamentable
Tragedie. In this matter, I ſay, I call
thee, frier Luther to witnes. For out of
whoſe mouth (I pray thee) fell yt worthie

ſaieng in the noble aſſemble of ye learned
and honorable at Lipſia:Luth. i

               Neither was this
matter euer begonne for Gods quarell,
nother ſhalbe ended for Gods ſake. O
noble ſentence, and worthie in deed to
come out of his mouth, that would be
called ye heauenly Prophere, ye third Elias,
ye fifth Euāgeliſte. Was this matter,
ſay you, neuer begonne for Gods ſake?
I beleue it wel. What was then ye cauſe,
I pray you good ſyr. yt ye made ſo cruel,
ſo long, ſo deadlie warre againſt ye Chriſtians,
yt ye ſticked not to trouble al Chriſtendome
wt ciuil barayle, wt inſurrectiōs
&amp; vprores, wt tumultes, ſeditiō, &amp; rebellion?
yt ye could find in your hartes, to
fight againſt your own parētes, &amp; your
own childrē, againſt your Rulers &amp; magiſtrates,
yea &amp; againſt ye church of chriſt?
            War ought neuer to be made without
moſt waighty occaſion. For it is yt part of
a wiſe mā to try all meanes &amp; waies, rather
thē to lay hād on his weapon: but yt
mē ſhuld fight at home in their own coū
               trie
againſt their own felows, their own
neighbors, their own parēts, there is no
reſon nor cauſe yt euer cā be foūd for it: or

ſurely if any be, it is this, that it be don by
Cōmiſſion &amp; lawful authority for Gods
honor, for Gods ſake only, &amp; for none other
reſpect: &amp; you, ſir Luther, do flatly,
(and yet moſt truly) deny, that theſe your
doinges were for any ſuche reipect at all.
            If I were able to ſay nothing in this
matter, but this yt thou thy ſelf ſaieſt for
me, yet out of doubt, by yt verdict &amp; iugemēt
of al honeſt, wiſe, &amp; indifferēt men, I
ſhould preuail in this cauſe, and proue al
your ſect to be ſeditious, raſh, cruel, wicked,
traiterous againſt God &amp; man, for yt
without any iuſt occaſiō, ye haue ſo long
&amp; ſo cruelly troubled the whole eſtate of
Chriſtendō. But you ſay, y• faith was wel
nigh quite quēched, &amp; out of the Church.
It is a wonderous matter ye ſpeake of.
Chriſt praied for S. Peter, that his Faith
ſhuld neuer faile. And wil ye ſay, he praid
in vaine, loſt his labor, and could not obtain
his prayer? that were iniury and reproche
to the ſonne of God. The holye
Ghoſt came downe from heauen into the
Church here militant on earth, to teache
her al truth. Hath he not taught her? you
blaſpheme the holy Ghoſt, ſo to ſay.
            
               
But goe to: let it be graunted that, as
you imagine all maner of fonde &amp; abſurd
thinges, ſo you thought in this poynte
with no leſſe madneſſe, that the Chriſtian
Faith was loſt, or at leaſt that Chriſtian
Religion being nigh outworne and ſpēt
before your happy daies needed to be reſtored
by ſuch excellent, graue, godly, and
wiſe men as you were, repleniſhed with
all maner of knowledge, vertue and heauenly
giftes of the ſprite.
            To be ſhort, your purpoſe was, ye ſay,
to refourme the Chriſtian Faith. Howe
then? When you could not therin preuail,
nor perſwade the people, that was ſomewhat
ſtubburn and ſtiffenecked perhaps
as you iudged, did you thinke it the beſt
way by and by with gonneſhot, and bytels
to beat and driue the faith into their
heades?
            Who euer being in his right wit did
thinke, that any thing might be perſwaded
by force? Men vſe to perſwade the
minde and not the bodye: but it is moſte
certaine, that the minde, as it maye be
bent, led, and induced by reaſon, ſo by
ſtripes, blowes &amp; buffets it can neuer be

compelled and conſtrained. But it was
a carnal Religion yt theſe fleſſhly Goſpellers
brought and taught, &amp; therefore
they dyd what they could to driue it into
mens braynes with ſtrokes, and to
prick it into mens fleſſh with ſwordes,
dags, and daggers. It may be, ye were
muche offended wt the vitiouſe maners
and ill liuing of men now a dayes. In
good faith and ſo were we. there is no
honeſt Catholike man that euer was delighted
therwith. But yet when we ſaw
that it was very hard fully to cleanſe &amp;
purge anie one familie or how ſhold frō
all maner of ſynnes &amp; ſores, we thought
it a matter of far greater difficultie &amp; importance,
to amend the faultes &amp; heale ye
wondes of al the whole corps of Chriſtēdom
together. therfore of neceſſity, be
cauſe we could not remedie yt deſperat
caſe by reaſon of the multitude, we bore
wt yt cōmon and vulgare Deceaſes and
vices of al ſortes of men, the cure wherof
was more paſt hope, and did take them
patientlye, but yet ſurely not without
great greif and ſorow to ſee them &amp; open
preaching cōtinuallie againſt them. But

you (ſowr Checkmaſters &amp; moſt bitter
Controllers of maners) went about,
lyke Iudges ſent from heauen or Phyſitions
dropte owt of the ſkyes, to cōdēne
and cut of with ſword, &amp; burn with fire
and gunpowder all at a puſhe ye faultes
and folies of the whole world together.
            Yf ye had bene officers hauing Commiſſiō
and authoritie ſo to doe, yet your
Iudgement and proceſſe could not be excuſed
herein from exceding crueltie and
raiſhnes: but where it appeareth ye were
but flingbraynes &amp; light Iackſtrawes
hauing no authoritie at al, yt toke vppō
you, without any examinatiō, without
proceſſe of law, without any ſentence, to
condemne al Chriſtendome, to rack it, to
puniſh it, and with moſt greuouſe and
painefull tormentes to teare and turne
vpſyde down ye whole world: what ſhall
I call this but a bloudy Butcherie, a
haynous wickednes, a dyueliſh dealing,
an impietie neuer to be pardoned? O but
(ſay you) the Catholikes did lyue vitiouſly,
the Cleargie were out of order, the
Princes and Rulers ruled not as they
ſhould: yea &amp; there were manie ceremonies
in ye Churche yt we could not brook.
            
               
I aſſure you theſe be greuous &amp; weighty
Inditementes. Who laid them in, I
pray you? Who but you, the worſt men, &amp;
naughtieſt liuers y• euer trode on earth?
What blames the theefe Verres his mate?

                  •
               
ſtampe, who vnder colour of Religion
and hypocritical name and Title of Miniſters
and Goſpellers deceaue and beguyle
the whole worlde? To make few
wordes, the abiects &amp; outcaſtes, the moſt
wicked and baſe of all ſortes of men are
gon to this goſpellyſh Cōgregation like
chaf winowed out of Gods floore, or like
as vile filth &amp; ordure doth run &amp; flow in

to a ſtincking gutter or ſinke. But eſpecially
if we cōſider ye Patriarches of this
Synagog, the chief Authors, the makers
and Maſters of theſe Sectes: we ſhall
plainly ſee, as in part I haue declared of
the thre forenamed Captains, yt ther was
neuer in the Church of Chriſt ſuch wedes
ſprong vp, ſo lewd, ſo lecherous, ſo
proud, ſo arrogant, ſo ſpitefull, ſo malitiouſe,
ſo wicked. For they are ſo clad
with al manner of naughtines, that ther
is nor hand, nor foote voied of vice, nor
any one part of all theyr bodies vnſpotted,
nor any wicked acte abſent from
theyr whole ſynfull carcaſſes.
            O ye vertuous Refourmors, could ye
beare with all theſe abhominations in
your owne manners, &amp; could abyde nothing
amiſſe among Catholike mē? The
flame of your fyrie Charitie was ſo hot,
that ye dydde your beſte to burne vp
quite other mens faultes, yea, the men
themſelues, theyr Cities, houſes, dwellinges
and all. But ye would not ſo
muche as ſweale your owne Coates
with the leaſte ſparkle of that conſuminge
fyre.
            
               
If all they that had offended moſt, had
firſt ſuffered puniſhemēt proportionable
to their deſertes, you had gon to the potere
this: it had bene your lot, who euery
one of you haue moſte wickedly tranſgreſſed
God and mans law, to haue gon
firſt to the gallowes. Would God that
order of iuſtice had bene obſerued: there
had bene by this tyme not one of that
your wicked packe and Conſpiracie lefte
aliue to puniſh the Catholikes ſo cruelly
with warre, fire, and ſword, liued they
wel or yll.
            But you can ſpare your ſelues well
inough, &amp; are in ye meane time ſo ſtreight
laced, that ye cannot find in your cankered
conſciences to pardon any offenſe in
other men. Ye were ſo inflamed with
the zeale of the Goſpell and of Godes
houſe, that ye cried out againſt the Catholikes
and proclaimed them Superſtitiouſe,
Adulterers, Tirannes, Idolatres
&amp;c. If all be true, as you ſay, indeed
it is a weightie mater worthie to
be ſharpely loked vpon that ye lay in againſt
them. But if all theſe be but lyes,
fables, and falſe ſurmiſes of your owne

malitiouſe ſtomakes, as they be in dede,
then you vncharitable backbiters, you
moſt impudēt ſclaūderers, haue deſerued
to abide your ſelues the iuſt puniſhmēt
due to thoſe faultes,Poena Talionis ye falſly fathered
vpon other. But ye were wily foxes, ye
eſcaped well enough.Subſcriptio in crimen. For ye did not, I
warāt you, as y• law ordaineth, put your
names to the inditemētes &amp; accuſations
ſubſcribed with your owne handes to
bind your ſelues to be readie to receaue
the puniſhement of the faultes ye layed
againſt other, if ye failed in your proofs.
Yea, and ye behaued yourſelues yet more
impudently thē this, and more contrary
to all order, proceſſe, and forme of lawful
proceding: for in this your monſtrous
iudgement of Reformation, you wer the
accuſers your ſelues, and you, the ſelfe
ſame men, the witneſſes, the iudges, the
hangmen, and moſt cruell boutchers to
execute your owne vnlawfull &amp; wicked
ſentence. It may be, this touched you
neere ye quick and cauſed you to winche
and ſtrike, that becauſe of your profeſſion
and vow of perpetual chaſtitie, wherein
ye promiſed to liue chaſte during your

liues, ye were not ſuffred freely to mary,
to beguile poore ſimple women, to bathe
your filthy bodies in the ſtinking puddle
of carnall pleaſures. What then? It had
bene your parte to ſtande to your owne
promiſe,Fides hoſti ſeruanda. though ye had made it to your
mortall enemie: howe muche more had
it becomme you, to haue kepte the vowe
of Chaſtitie ye made to God almightie?
But twyſſhe: you were werie of your
vowe, it repented you that euer you
made it, ye dyd ſette naught by it, ye
were of that mynde peraduenture, that
ye had rather be damned for euer, then
to treade for a ſhorte ſpace the ſtreight
narowe way that leadeth to heauen.
            Wel, if it were ſo that nedes ye would
to it, and caſte your Vowe on the hedge:
yea needed not ſtreight wayes to fight
for the mater. For ye had the common
Stewes and brothell houſes open at all
tymes, and euery where at your pleaſure.
Lighte women maried, and vnmaried,
yea and Nunnes that had profeſſed
Virginitie, as you had done, were
ready by your lewd perſwaſions (more
was the pittie) to ſerue your filthye

luſtes, to keepe you companie, to goe
to the diuell arme in arme with you.
            But what if perhappes ſome of you
dwelled among good men in ſuche well
ordered Townes, where good Rule
was ſo narowly loked to, that by no
meanes they could be ſuffred to haue a
Miſtreſſe Candida for a veſſell of eaſement,
               It is Couerdales Phraſe.
as ye call it: was that a ſufficient
wrong and iuſte quarell for you to take
Pepper in the noſe, and ſworde in the
hande, and by and by bidde Battaile?
Were ye bound to ſtand ſo ſtoutly to Ladie
Lecherie, Dame Venus, to maintain
the liberties of her Kingdome and Goſpel
ſo ſtreightly, that if euery one of you
in euery place were not permitted freely
and without checke to cheriſhe his
carkaſſe wt a Whore, ye ſhoulde for reuenge
of her quarell trouble the Goſpell
of Chriſte, diuide with Sciſmes
the Churche of God, make ſuche a ſeedition,
ſuche a ſturre, ſuche an vprore in
all Chriſtendome, as neuer any Barbarous,
Rude, Sauage or Wild people
made the like?
            Some of your ſide ſuffred for ye Words

ſake, for ſo ye cal y• curſed goſpel of yours
Yea and well worthy to, I aſſure you.
For they neuer ceaſed to bark at Prelats
&amp; Princes, to worke al meanes to wring
the ſword out of theyr handes, to trouble
and diſorder ye ſtate of common weales:
Finally they neuer had theyr ful of theyr
ſundrie wicked practiſes againſt God,
of theyr raiſhe madneſſe and furiouſe
blaſphemies againſt the bleſſed Sacrament
of the Altar.
            Yea, but you ſaie it was the very true
worde of God they preached, they were
the men of God, the Martyrs of Ieſus
Chriſt, the Apoſtels of Chriſtendome.
Theſe be high Titles. Will they be any
higher? I wil ſpeake for them, to ſet thē
vp one ſteppe more. They were thoſe
that labored to clyme vp to the North, to
place theyr ſeates aboue ye cloudes of the
heauens, to be like Lucifer▪ Checkmates
with God himſelf. And what of al this?
Was it meete that becauſe they could not
freely and frankely preache the worde,
therefore by and by they ſhould lay hand
on the ſword?
            
               
The Apoſtles of Ieſus Chriſte were
wōt to ſuffer, not to geue blowes: to take
not to doe iniury. S. Paule was cōtent
rather to leeſe his head, and paciently to
ſuffer the ſword, then to ſtrike or cauſe any
to reuenge his quarell. S. Peter
was wrongfully crucified, and yet procured
no man to be troubled for it. Why do
not the new Apoſtles folow the olde Apoſtles
example?
            O Maſter Miniſters, it is a very hard
Word yt ye bring vs. for ye ſpeake gōneſtones,
your Goſpel is to hot, ye preache
fire and powder, your Religion is to
cruell, it breedeth bloud and murder. Ieſus
Chriſt was contented to ride on an
Aſſe, the Apoſtles thought it no ſkorne to
goe barefoote: and we embrace gladlye,
with reuerence their patience, humilitie,
vertue, and mild manner in planting the
Goſpel. But you ride to preach on barbd
horſes, &amp; put on the corſelet not of faith,
but of iron and ſteele, to ſet forward your
ſtrainge Religion. Al the world may ſee,
that, as the maner and order of your procedinges
is contrary to Chriſt, ſo all the
ſtuffe ye vtter, is likewiſe contrary to his

heauenly Doctrine. What? Could ye
not ſuffer Martyrdome gladly for the
goſpel? No forſoth: ye choſe rather to ſlay
thē to be ſlaine, &amp; no maruell. For ye loked
for none other commoditie by your
Goſpel, but a loſeneſſe and liberty to liue
at your pleaſure. And therfore ſuch Goſpellers
for ſuch a Goſpel were very loth
to leeſe their liues. The theefe wil neuer
gladly ſuffer deathe and ſpend his life in
defenſe of theft: for he purpoſeth to haue
none other frute and profite by theft, but
his ſweete life in this world maintained
at pleaſure. He that loſeth his life, ſayeth
Chriſt, preſerueth it into life euerlaſting:Io. 12.
but you were loth to loſe yours, for that
ye had no hope to haue any euerlaſting
life for it. Ye held it better to be Martyrmakers,
thē Martyrs: to do, then to ſuffer
iniurie: How be it, to ſay the truthe,
ye ſuffred no iniury whē ye ſuffred death
for hereſy, for ye deſerued no leſſe. But,
when ye murdred other, ye did great iniury,
whether they deſerued to die or no:
For that ye had no authoritye ſo to do.
            Hold ſtil your hands a little while,
lay downe your Swordes and priuye

Daggers, let your fury coole, and harken
to reaſon, and ye ſhall plainly perceiue,
that there is great oddes betwene
the order and due Miniſtration of Iuſtice,
that the Emperoure and Chriſten
Princes vſed to execute againſte your
wicked tranſgreſſions: and your impudent
boldneſſe, Traiterous Rebellion,
and Bloudy Cruelty againſt Chriſtendome.
By the authority of God allmighty
they beare the ſword,Rom. 13. and haue power
to puniſhe the wicked: but, as for you,
who made you, I pray you, rulers and
Iudges in Iſrael? O vnhappy dayes, O
wicked manners of our daies, maye we
crye at this time with more iuſt occaſion,
then in his age Marcus Cicero did.
            Bondſlaues refuſe to beare the yoke
vnder their Maiſters: Subiectes diſdaine
to obey the Commaundementes
and Rule of their Magiſtrates, Theues
would be Lordes and raigne ouer all.
Who be robbers, if you be Refourmers?
Yea, who then ſhall be called Spoilers,
Ennemies, Traitors, Tyrannes, and
Cruell Bouchers, if you be Giltleſſe and
Innocentes?
            
               
To conclude in fewe wordes, what
reaſonable cauſe doe ye alleage for your
ſelues, why ye made warres ſo wicked
and ſo abhominable, why ye prepared
fire and fagot to burne the whole world?
was it becauſe ye were ſometimes burned
for hereſie? Truly ye ſuffred not ſo
muche nor ſo often as ye deſerued: but if
perhaps, according to your deſertes, y
                  •
               
had gon oftner to the ſtake, yet ye ſhould
haue ſuffred it patiently for the Goſpels
ſake, if ye were Goſpellers (for ſo were
the Apoſtles wont to do) at leaſt wiſe ye
ſhoulde not haue reſiſted wyth force of
armes, becauſe ye were ſubiectes, and
were puniſhed by an order of law at the
commaundement of the Magiſtrats and
ſuperiour powers. Could not the freedome
of your Goſpell floriſhe and purchaſe
you the carnall freedome and looſe
libertie of the fleſhe by no meanes without
warre? In good ſoothe ye neded not
to repine for lacke of libertie. For euery
where ye were wont to ſet the vſuall and
accuſtomed faſtes of y• Church at naught,
and fill the Panche freely, to cary a ſiſter
wife about with you, to toule Nunnes

out of Cloyſters, and with filthy and ſacrilegious
Lechery to abuſe them: yea &amp;
moſt commonly euery Apoſtate Monke
had his Nunne at his taile. And ſo it agreed
wel, if god wold haue had it ſo: for,
            
               Holy Kate her holy mate,
               And like his like muſt loue:Sanctum ſancta docet, his artibus i
                        •
                     urad aſtra.
               
               By holy trade, a broode is made,
               To clime the Cloudes aboue.
            
            It was the Frier Apoſtles pleaſure,
that his Lady Venus Court ſhould be
franke and free. If thy wife, ſaith he, wil
not do it,Lutheri Ep ad Praepoſ. Luneburg. let thy maide ſupply her place:
the will of God commaundeth, and neceſſitie
bindeth as wel to haue carnal copulation,
and as to eat and drinke. Was
it your drift to redreſſe the vitious liuing
and looſe maners of theſe daies? It had
bene your part firſt to amend your owne
ſelues, who were the worſt in al ye packe,
and then hardely to lay to other mennes
charge what ye could. Or was this your
purpoſe to compell men to receiue your
Goſpell, and to poure it into their mouthes
ſpite of their teethe? So did neuer
Chriſt plant his Religion, but ſo Mahumet
ſtabliſhed his curſed ſect. Ye labored

in vaine, when ye trauailed to bring the
world to your Religion by Villany, railing
and dubble Cannons, as eaſily as
the Apoſtles did win men to the Goſpell
of Chriſt, by their good liuing, preaching
and miracles.Luther began his goſpell for malice againſte the Pope, as he confeſſeth. How be it in dede, it was
neither Religion, nor Goſpel, nor Gods
quarell that ye ment to further: euen he
him ſelf, who not for Gods ſake, but formalice
againſt the Pope begā this whole
Tragedy, is a currant witneſſe in this
poynt,Ep. ad Argētin. impreſſ. Hagan. 1521. and hath conſtantly ſo depoſed.
            Was it to reſtore the Chriſten Faithe,
(being as ye thoughte well nighe worne
out) that ye made ſo great ſturre? Your
labor was needleſſe: for the Churche of
God, the Seat and ſure Piller of Truth,
hath allwaies,1. Tim. 3. without force and battail,
moſt Reuerently and charely kepte the
Faith that was from the beginning cō
               mitted
to her Cuſtody. This Chriſt obtained
of his Father:Io. 17. this ſhall the Heauenly
Comforter the holye Ghoſte perfourm
for euer.Io. 14 How thē good ſirs? Was
this wel done ſo to turmoile and toſſe the
quiet ſtate and publike affaires of cōmon
weales, to make a mixture and confuſion
of whot and cold, high and low, to trouble

and turne vp and downe all thinges
appertaining to God &amp; man, ſo lightly,
ſo raſhly, ſo wickedly without any iuſt
occaſion, without any ſufficient cauſe,
without any good reaſon?
            Men that profeſſed Chriſtianity, haue
ſought cruelly and outragiouſly a longe
time againſt Chriſten men, haue ſought
their liues and goods, haue bereaued thē
of houſe and home; of Church and Chappell:
welthy and rich Cities are impoueriſhed,
ſacked &amp; ſpoiled, Church Veſtries
are voided, rifled &amp; robbed: And now if a
man call them to accomptes, &amp; aſke the
cauſe of al theſe their tragical &amp; cruel doings,
he ſhal haue a ſhort anſwer wt mum
budget, except they will peraduēture allege
this, yt the lofty Ambitiō, ye gredy Auarice,
the deſperat boldnes of certen w
                  •
               tō
&amp; loſe friers haue miniſtred iuſt occaſiō
of ſo horrible, wicked, &amp; hainous battel.
            Now I come (moſt gētle Audiēce) to
ye ſecōd parte of this matter,2 to ye poynt
wherin I promiſed to make diſcourſe of
their cōſpiracies and treaſons: to the end
ye may plainly perceiue, yt our Aduerſaries
were not only wtout cauſe offēded &amp;
raſhli moued to bēd their minds to fight,

but that alſo they toke weapon in hand,
and bad battaile traiterouſly: and that as
they attempted warre without iuſtice &amp;
right, ſo they proclaimed and purſued
the ſame without Authoritye and Commiſſion,
to omit nothing that ſhould help
to fil vp the meaſure of their ſo great and
execrable wickedneſſe.
            It is great pitye,2. in verye deede it is
muche to be pitied, that Chriſten Princes
doe make warre one againſt another ſo
often: yea and that, God wot, for light occaſion,
or wel nighe for none occaſion at
all. Deſire of raigne and ſoueraigntie, &amp;
light diſpleaſure taken vpon a word ſpoken,
Glory, Haſtineſſe, Emulation of
Rulers, haue bread vs many times long
and cruell battaile, ſo that a man mighte
wel now ſing as the Poet Horace did.
            
               When Kinges and Rulers kepe ill rule,
               The people paies for all:Quicquid dilirant Reges plectuntur Achiui.
               
               Their ouerſightes, the Commons ſighes,
               And feeles their wanton fall.
            
            The time ſhall come, Oh, I tremble
when I ſpeake it, the time ſhall come in
deede, when it ſhall repent them to late,
that by their lightneſſe and raiſh panges,

ſo much and ſo manie mens blood hath
bene ſhed. Yet to ſay the truthe in ſuche
warres, moſt commonlie, the ſouldiours
are excuſed for that theyr part is rather
to obey, fulfil and accompliſſhe their lawful
Princes and Capitains commaundement,
then deliberate, diſpute and reaſon
of the equitie of the cauſe wherefore they
fight. But in this domeſticall inſurrection,
in this moſtruous Tumulte, and
Sedition, that hath bene ſturred vp theſe
many yeres vnder pretenſe of refourmation
in maters of Religion, wherein nor
Capitaine, nor Magiſtrate, nor Prince,
nor Emperour biddeth any man ſtrike:
Where without anie Lieutenant general,
knight Martial, or deputie Captaine
all the whole hoſte is but an aſſemble of
priuate men, of common ſouldiours, or
rather of rouers, cutthrotes and moſte
cruell murderers, who is voide of hainous
offenſe? what one is free from maliciouſe
treaſon? Who of all this companie
is able to ſay, that he is in his conſcience
giltleſſe, innocent and vnſpotted?
            Priuate men that had no Authoritie

                  •
               t all, bad battaill them ſelues of theyr

owne headdes, and ſtyckte not, without
theyr Kynge and Soueraigne his
commandement, to bringe and receaue
into the Realme, forayners, ſtraingers,
hyred ſouldioures and enemies.
            I wyll aſke them nowe no more,
what iuſte Quarell, what reaſonable
Cauſe they had, to muſter and to proclayme
warre. Be it, that the Cauſe
was moſte iuſte and ſufficiente, becauſe
theyr pleaſure was ſo: But this I aſke
them, what lawefull Power, what lawe,
what Statute, what Right, what Cuſtome
or common Example of Antiquitie,
what Authoritie and Commiſſion
they had ſo to doe?
            Whereas they are but mere Priuate
men and Subiectes, called to no Office
nor Authoritie at all, nor placed in
anye roome or Dignitie in the Common
weale: yet they dare be ſo bolde,
as to Muſter, to Campe, to pytche a
Fylde, they take vppon them to myniſter
Iuſtice, and right (right? Rather
may I cal it moſte vnmercifull wronge)
they wyll needes be Rulers, yea and
rule al Rulers and the whole roſte them

ſelues alone.

you nowe, right Honorable Goſpellinge

Prince and moſte Reuerende Father

Deformed Churche in the Honorable

plainlye to confeſſe and graunte, that
ye are but priuate Subiectes, of no Iuriſdiction,
of no Place or Degree, called
to no Office or power to meddle with
the Publyke Affaires of Chriſtendome:
Finally that (for all theſe your ſtrainge,
maruelouſe, and monſterouſe Myſteries
which ye profeſſe and practice moſte
impudently and deſperately, takinge vppon
you to redreſſe the ſtate of all Chriſtendome,
and to Reforme matters of
Religion) ye haue no Authoritye at all,

neither ordinarie power in earth, nor extraordinarie

For ye ſhal neuer be able to proue either

            As for Martine Luther (or rather

and put in ſuch feare, that he determined
with him ſelf to forſake the world,
to enter into Religion: &amp; ſo out of hande
made him ſelfe an Auguſtine Friere. At
the laſte he was made Doctour in Diuinitie

with ſhame inough: for he came to
that degree with the money that was bequethed
to an other man, whome, with
the help of his Prior, he beguiled.Luther. in ſer▪ de deſtruct. Hieruſ. Luth. ad ver falſò nominat ſtat. Eccl &amp; li cōtr Reg. An. What

learne by any meanes. But in deede he
braggeth verie often, that he is wel aſſured,
that his doctrine and concluſions
are from heauen, and that he was ſent
from heauen to the Germans to be their
firſt Apoſtle that ſhould preache them the

a Licentiate in law, who taketh

ſo muche Poeticall licence, that in his

farre the wanton Pagan Poetes

ſpeake of Bernardinus Ochinus y• Italiane,
who laboreth to plante the beaſtly
Doctrine of Polygamie, that is, that
more then one wife at once may ioyne
 wt a mā in ye ſtate of lawful matrimony,
willing therefore and perſwadinge men
to be Manywiuers, as the Turkes are.
            What ſhall I tell you of Peter Martyr
the Renegate Moncke, or of Bernarde
Rotman an vnlearned Aſſe that
beganne to profeſſe learninge, and by
color of only Scripture, whiche he vnderſtode
not, expelled the Catholikes out
of the Citie of Munſter? Or of Ihon

was driuen a great while to liue

no more then they gaue her leaue:
yea, and in the meane tyme was euerie
daye and euery houre in greate perill &amp;

            I need not tell, that euery man knoweth,
how the Gētell men that were ſeduced
by thies new preachers rebelled

But I can not omit, to ſpeake of th

late treaſon and cruell conſpiracie of the
Hugonoes in Frāce, who could without
weeping teares abyde to tell, how thoſe
naughtie, falſe &amp; wicked ſubiectes were
not aſhamed, to ſtand in open field againſte
their own natural Soueraigne
in his own realme? To bid war and
fight againſte theyr lawfull King, during
his Nonage, to make a league and
confederacie wt ye enemies of his croune,
to ſell his Cities and townes to forayners
&amp; ſtraingers for mony? This holie
bataille (for the Goſpell a Gods name)
was fought againſte France by
Frenchemen themſelues: that is, firſt by
Caluin the Dictator and General of the
field, then by Beza the Lieutenant, and
Othomannus and Spifamius the petie
Captaines. Theſe were the cheife doers
in deed, though as they toke the coloure
of Religion &amp; pretenſe of refourmation
for cloke of their treaſon, ſo they vſed the
names &amp; ſeruice of certaine of y• nobilitie
of France whome they had ſeduced to
beare out the brunte of the Battaille,
the ſmarte of the ſtrokes, the enuie, the

infamie, &amp; all the outward face and po

of that buſy mater. Theſe were the

                  •
               naues that lay in y• ſtocke: as for other,
they were but theyr trumping Cardes.
            The preface of their tragedie was verie
calme and peaceable. They would
ſeeme to go verie orderlie to work. They
got an edict to be made forſooth for the
furtherance of theyr Goſpell, they got a
law by force and extorſion againſt y• king
and Magiſtrats wil and pleaſure.Claud. D. Sainct du Saccag. Fo. 58. The
highe Court of Parlemēt of Paris made
anſwer at the firſte, We can not, we wil
not, we ought not. But afterward they
were compelled to let the bill paſſe, &amp; the
Edicte of Ianuarie to be made, y• theſe
rakchels might preach without y• walles
by permiſſion, and as it were by vertue
of a law: whiche law to all honeſt good
men neuer ſeemed worthie to haue the
name of a law, as the whiche was obtained
by force, was laied vppon mens
neckes by the might and violence of
theeues and traitours that had taken &amp;
bound y• Common weale hand &amp; foote,
was written and penned againſte all
reaſon and equitie. But yet a law they

would needes haue, were it neuer ſo
vnlawfull, to be a cloke to couer theyr
outragiouſe ſedition.
            And in deed at the firſte they made
them ſelues verie humble and meeke.
When the King and the Honorables of
France were aſſembled about weightie
&amp; greate affaires of ye Realme at Poiſſie,
thither came the twelue Apoſtles of that
deformed Churche, of whiche number
eight or nyne were Apoſtates, Munkes,
and friers that had caſte of their habites,
broken their vowes, and forſaken theyr
profeſſion: ſuche ſmothe marchantes, y• in
outward talke and worde, in the preſence
of that honorable Audience, would
ſpeake of nothing, but of peace and concord,
of good faith and ſimple dealing:
whereas in deed they meante, they minded,
they wrought nothing els, but wicked
conſpiracie and treaſon, but ſacking
of 
                  ••
               urches, burning of cities, murdring
of Citiſens, and the vtter ruine and deſtruction
of that Realme. Yet that they
were ſo earneſt to haue a law for theyr
ſyde, and by publike authoritie to be ſuffred
to preache after their curſed faſhion,

their intent and purpoſe therein was
this: that vnder pretenſe of a law they
might vndoe the realme, and turne the
King out of his kingdom, as they did
before vnder colour of the word of God,
expell the Biſſhops wellnighe out of the
Churche.
            Wold you haue a law, that refuſe to
liue vnder a law? Who is ſo blind y• can
not plainlie ſee, that your crafte &amp; practize
is, to driue out (as it were) one naile
with an other: whiles vnder the ſhadow
of Religion and law, ye labor what ye
can, to banniſhe all law &amp; Religion out
of the world, to ouerthrow the Churche,
to roote all ciuill order and policie of tē
               porall
affaires out of all Chriſten Realmes,
countreis and Cities?
            But I pray you,Claud. D. Sainctes du ſaccag. Fo. 55. by what law made
you that wicked conſpiracie, when ye agreed
together to robbe &amp; ſpoile in one
night all y• Churches in France at ones,
if all things had framed &amp; fallen out according
to your phanſies &amp; purpoſe euerie
where, as they did in Gaſcoine &amp; diuers
other places of Fraunce, where according
to the appointement the matter

was put in practice in deed with mo
                  ••
               
deſperate boldnes, and wicked Sacrilege?
By what Religion or law did a
great companie of you flock together at
Challon in Burgundie,The three eſtats of Burgundie doe reporte this in the ſecond part of theyr Diſcours vppon the Frenche Kings Edict. &amp; there in your
Conuocation houſe made a Synodalle
decree, that euerie man ſhould endeuor
to his power to driue three Vermines
out of Chriſtendome, the Churche of
Rome, the Nobilitie, the publike order
of iuſtice? If ye denie it, your names are
to be ſeen yet in the Recordes of the
highe Court of Parlement at Paris,
where manie of you were accuſed for it
by y• Rulers and eſtates of Burgundie.
            When ye trauayled vnder a pretenſed
ſhew of Gods worde to diſſanull and
aboliſhe the Supremacie of the chiefe
Biſſhop of the Chriſtiās, who according
to y• commiſſion and charge geuen vnto
him by Chriſtes owne mouth, vſed euer
to feed &amp; rule bothe ye ſheep and lambes
of Gods flocke: then were theſe wordes
euer in your monthes, Honour the king,
obey the king as the higheſt:
               1. Pet 3. Tit. 3. 
               warne them
to hearken and obey Princes and Rulers.
But when ye conſpired and agreed together

at Geneua like villaines &amp; traitours,
to find priuie meanes, when time,
place, and occaſiō might ſerue you, to rid
out of the waie and murder the late vertuouſe
and good king of France Frauncis
the ſecond, the Queene his wife (who
now, God be thanked, hath gotten the
vpper hand ouer the rebelles and raigneth
in Scotland) the Quene Mother,
her children, all the nobles, and all the
Catholike and good Officers of Fraunce:
where was then your ſcripture and that
accuſtomed ſentence of yours, Honoure
the Kinge?
            
            Out of all doubt you meane nothinge
els by theſe wordes, but to thruſte your
ſword through the Biſſhoppes body in
to the Kinges harte. It was your Polycie
firſt to vanquiſh the Biſhop by the
worde, that ye might the more eaſely afterward
kill the King with the ſword.
            But here perhappes ſome one will
aſke, howe I knowe all this? To him I
make this anſwer,Defenſ. Reg. &amp; Reſig. Fol. 16. that this is ſet out in
printe in Fraunce vnder the Kings priuilege:
and therefore ſeing it is cōmon
in euerie mans hand, knowen to al men

and ſet out to the ſight of the worlde in
defenſe of the moſte Chriſtian King and
of the Catholike Religion, it can not be
vnknowē, alſo to me. Yea &amp; may it pleaſe
him to vnderſtād, that I know this alſo
that I read and ſaw with my owne eyes
y• laſte yeare at Orleans, I meane a libel
printed in ye name of all y• Hugonoes of
Fraunce to theyr Souueraigne Lorde
and King, wherein was nothinge ells
from the beginning to the ending, but
impudent boldnes, deſperate threatninges,
and ſhameful treaſon.
            The ſubiettes were not afrayed to
write to theyr King, yt he could not raign
ouer thē, that they would ſuffer his yoke
and obey his commaundement no longer,
excepte he would be contented to
rule his realme in ſuch ſort, and by ſuch
lawes and ordinances, as they ſhould
appointe him. That they plaied the
very fooles, when by his commaundemente
they layed doune theyr weapons:
that they woulde ſurely take them in
hand againe, excepte he woulde looke
well to hym ſelfe, and putte out of the
Councell of Paris certaine noble and

Honorable men, who as they ſayed,
were theeues Rouers, Butchers: and
place in theyr romes certaine of theyr
brethren in Chriſte.
            What coulde be ſpoken or inuented
more Proudelye, more Impudentely,
more ſeditiouſlie, and malitiouſly, then
that they vttered in this malaperte, ſtubborne,
and traiterouſe Libell? The
Printer of Orleans was kepte and feaſted
a fewe dayes with the Officers of
that Toune in theyr houſes, in ſteede
of a Priſon, for printinge this Oration:
and y• was al that was done to him
then for it.
            With the lyke Sprite one Goodman
an Engliſſhe man,Goodmās boke againſte y• monſtruous raigne of womē. an earneſte and hotte
Preacher of this Goſpell, for a grudge
and malice he bore againſte his Soueraigne
Ladie and Myſtreſſe Marye
the moſte hyghe and Honorable Queene
of Englande, dydde ſette out a monſtruouſe
Booke in deede a fewe yeares
agoe againſte the monſtruouſe Raygne
of Women, as he ſayed: yea, the impudente,
vile, and ſhameleſſe villaine

Traitor called that moſte noble and vertuouſe
woman Proſerpine (whome the
Poetes faine to be Quene of hel) and for
her ſake gathering choler and ſtomake
againſt all women, he railed at them all,
and reuiled them, &amp; like a common ſcolde
would by his wil ſet on a cookinge ſtole,
all the whole flocke and generation of
woman kinde.
            He ſaied it was neither law, nor right,
nor reaſon, that any woman ſhould be a
Ruler and ſyt in the Princelie Seate of
any Common Weale: that it might well
ſeeme a monſtruouſe rule, and contrarye
to nature, if men were compelled to obey
a woman: if womē were ſuffred to beare
the ſway and gouerne the publike eſtate
of any kingdome.
            If he wrote thus eſpecially for hatred
and malice he bare againſte women, he
ſwarued much from the common and accuſtomed
manner and faſſhion of his fellowes,
who doe atribute ſo much to women,
and are of ſuche a fonde and filthie
opinion, that they thinke it impoſſible for
a man to liue one daye without the companie
of a woman. Howbeit in deed they

be naughtie and lewde women, fit and
ready to the game only, that theſe fellowes
loue ſo much: but as for good womē
(emong whome this vertuouſe Queene
might be wel Quene &amp; Princeſſe in dede)
they can not abide, but doe vtterly deteſt
them, and hate them as muche as they
hate all good men.
            Out of doubt in one thing this Goſpeller
obſerued iumpe ye wonted practiſe
and beatē path of his companions: that
vnder pretenſe of ſpeaking againſte women
he endeuored to ſturre the people to
rebellion, and the ſubiectes to ſhrinke awaye
and forſake theyr liege and lawful
Soueraigne. And thys is euen the very
daily and cōmon cuſtome of all the packe
of ſuch new Goſpellers &amp; Refourmers,
who caſte theyr platte and are fully ſet, be
it right or wrong, by foraine battayle abrode,
or by rebellion at home, to trouble
and diſquiete the peaceable ſtate &amp; good
order of al common weales, when it ſerueth
their turne they are ſo ſkilful, yt they
cā put in vre both theſe myſteries of their
Goſpell at ones.
            When the Emperour of worthie memorie

Charles the fifte was entangled
and troubled at Oeniponte with theyr
tumulte and rebellinge, Soliman the
Greate Turke was in the meane tyme
requeſted in theyr behalfe to make war,
for the furtherance and Defenſe of theyr
fifte Goſpell.Defenſ. Staphil. contr. Il. Et Sleid. notat. The greate Turke, I
ſaye, (Oh horrible &amp; moſt impious acte)
was ſent for, that whyles they aſſaulted
the Emperour and kepte hym at a
bay in Germanie, Budenſis Baſſa the
Turkes Deputie ſhould ſette vppon his
brother Ferdinande in Hungarie. The
letters of that Conſpiracie were taken:
ſo that theyr crafte herein is open, theyr
falſhode can not be denied, theyr wickednes
and treaſon can by no coloure
be couered or cloked.
            It were an infinite matter (gentell
Audience) that might be here alleged, if
I would reckon vp all theſe Goſpellers
traiterouſe enterpriſes, and make full
diſcours of euery particular parte of
theſe haynouſe Conſpiracies. For in
deede they haue lefte nothinge vndone
that anie cruell Robbers, falſe Traitours,
or wicked Heretikes, could euer

committe, attempte or deuiſe, againſte all
good men, againſt Princes, againſt God
allmightie himſelfe. They haue iniured
and traiterouſly offended the Royall
maieſtie of all the Kings and Princes of
Chriſtendome, they haue diſturbed, impaired,
and broken all polityke order
and rule of all Common Weales. They
haue diſquieted, vexed and diſordered
the high Courte of the Imperiall Chamber,
they haue aboliſhed ye auncient lawes
and cuſtomes of the Emperours Supreme
Conſiſtorye, and haue appointed
newe of theyr owne makinge, ſo
that Iuſtice and Ryghte is banniſſhed
from thence: in ſuche ſorte that there remayneth
ſcarſe anye Signe or token of
Lawe and Equytie in that renounted
place,This writteth Brunus de Haero, lib. 2. and Imperall benche. for it ys
theyr pleaſure that all thinges be tried
&amp; decided by fyere and and ſworde. Yea
and what ſay ye by this, that many bookes
and Lybells of theyrs haue bene cō
               monly
found and ſeen abroade, wherein
they vttered theyr ſtudie &amp; declared theyr
attempt &amp; trauaile to alter and chainge al
ye order of iuſtice &amp; iudgementes of the

Empire, to take awaye and abrogate
all the Ciuill Lawes, and to make a new
Policie and Order of gouernement of
theyr owne phantaſtical deuiſe.
            And it was not inough in theyr opiniō,
nor ſufficient for the abſolute perfection
of theyr Goſpell to betraie euerie particular
Ruler, and to worke treſon againſt
euery king in his owne Realme: to fil vp
the meaſure of theyr malice &amp; wickednes
they became Traitors againſt the Pope,
the Emperour, the Biſſhops al at ones,
and fynallie without any reſpecte dydde
violate and ſet at nought the Mageſtie
and eſtate of all Spirituall and Temporall
Rulers aſſembled together in the
laſte Generall Councell at Trent. They
were not aſhamed to raile at that moſte
highe and honorable aſſemble of Chriſtendome
(the only name whereof ſhould
haue made them tremble, whoſe only
becke all Chriſten men, euer ſythens
Chriſten Religion begonne, reuerenced
and followed) at Chriſtes higheſte
Vycar in earthe, at all the Reuerend
Fathers, the Biſſhops and men of God,
at al the moſte high &amp; excellent Chriſten

Princes (emong whome were the renoumed
Emperours, firſt Charles the
fifth, then Ferdinande) and at a word to
call them all theeues.
            At what time the Princes and temporall
Rulers did ſet their heads together
to appeare and ſet at concord the ſtate of
Chriſtendome, and the Biſhops did purpoſe
and ſtudy earneſtly to expound and
declare the Articles of Religion y• were
in controuerſy, when that moſt holy and
high Parlement of al Chriſtendom was
called &amp; aſſembled together in one place:
theſe new Goſpelliſh Refourmers were
warned and warranted vnder Publike
aſſurance, to come thither, to tell their
mindes, and then to departe ſafely without
any harme or daunger. The general
letters Patentes, the ſufficient and lawfull
ſafeconduct of the Pope and the generall
Councel were Wrytten, Prynted,
and Proclaimed for their behalfe herein.
No man appeareth, not one of them maketh
any word or mention of Refourmation
there: the matter touching the Refourmation
of the Churche is diſputed
in the meane time, and debated amonge

them in the campe, in the field, in battaile
in Fraunce by force &amp; might, by ſwordes
&amp; daggers, by gonnes and dubble Cannons.
            And as for the Generall Councell,
which was of purpoſe called to redreſſe
and refourme all that was amiſſe, where
the lawfull place, authority, and meanes
of Refourmation was to be found, they
paſſed not for it: they were called, and refuſed
to come at it. They deſpiſed and cō
               temned,
they reſiſted and aſſaulted, they
mocked and reuiled with moſte impudent
ſcolding and railing that Generall
benche and Court of all the Churche of
Chriſte, that worthieſt and higheſt Conſiſtory
of Chriſtendome. And the more to
ſhewe their ſpite and deſperate malice,
Montanus the Germaine,Moline. Monta. Apolo. Eccl. Angl. &amp; caet. and Molinaeus
the Frenche man, and many other accompted
no ſmall fooles amonge them,
haue ſet forthe openlye in Printe in the
name of all theſe Goſpellers their cankred,
malitious, wicked, and diueliſhe
defiance.
            Whome ſhall we accompte for frantike,

madde, and furious men, but ſuche
as are ſo farre beſide them ſelues, ſo enraged,
ſo Bedlemlike, that they knowe
not men, they know no Law, no Magiſtrate,
no common Weale, no Church, no
Religion, no God?
            Ye haue hard (right learned audience)
how theſe deſperat and outragious caſtawaies
and Rebels had no Authority at
all to bid battaile, but conſpired together
like Theues, Cutthrotes and Traitors:
may it pleaſe you now to be aduertiſed
of that, which is by order the third and
laſt part of my talke, that is, howe little
furtherance, frute, or profit touching Refourmation,
as they call it, they gotte by
fighting, howe great and hurtfull loſſe,
iniury, and damage they did therby to all
the whole world, howe fearcely, cruelly,
and Tyrannically they vſed themſelues
in handling their bloudy weapons.
            And in this poynt I aſſure you in good
Faith I wot not what I may, nor what
I may not faye, nor where to begin,
ſo many and ſo manifold loſſes &amp; harmes
Chriſtendome hath had euery waye, and

on euery ſide, by the occaſion of this wicked
and cruell diſſenſion whiche began
firſt wel nigh fifty yeares agoe in Saxonie
about certaine Articles and queſtions
concerning Religion: but ſithens y•
time it hath bene maruelouſly ſpred abrode
and enlarged, and is now come to
this lamentable caſe, and tragicall ſtate
as ye ſee.
            It grieueth the very bottome of my
harte to call to remembraunce howe vnluckely,
how miſerably the worlde hath
gone with vs, how pitifully the eſtate of
Chriſtendome hath fallen to wracke, ſythens
the firſt beginning of theſe diſmold
and deadly diſcordes and battailes ſet a
broche and ſtirred at the firſt vnder pretenſe
and coloure of Religion.
            I can ſcarſe abſtaine from wepinge
teares, when I remember and conſider
ſo ruefull, heauy, and lamentable a caſe.
And as for the blowes, the woundes, the
ſmart, theſe Butchers beſtowed on mens
bodies: or the continuaunce of time may
eaſe them, or the diligence of cunning mē
may heale them, or the charitable patiēce

of Chriſtian hartes may forget them.
But that they haue baniſhed the Chriſtian
Faith and Religion out of ſo manye
Realmes, that they haue with deceit and
craft, with fire and Sword, beaten and
driuen away all Iuſtice, Chaſtity, Deuocion,
all good learning &amp; good nurture,
all feare of God almighty, all goodneſſe
and godlineſſe from the hartes &amp; mindes
of ſo many thouſandes Chriſten men,
that they haue rooted vp the Religion of
Chriſt, and planted in the ſteede thereof,
the Turkiſh Sect of Machomet, the ſuperſtitious
doctrine of the Iewes, or rather
y• Heathenniſh &amp; vnſenſible blindneſſe
of thoſe y• beleue in no God at all,
in many countreis that were ſometimes
the moſte floriſhing and nobleſt quarters
of Chriſtendome: theſe Iſay, theſe vntollerable
hurtes and dāmages are ſuche, as
neither may be amēded eaſely, nor reſtored
quickly, nor euer be aboliſhed &amp; put
out of mennes remembrance hereafter.
            They haue brought vs in ſtede of Religion
innumerable errors and dreames,
accurſed Sectes of old doting heretiks,

and monſtruous phanſies of wicked and
diueliſh braines: their chiefe purpoſe and
intent was quite to ouerthrow the Eccleſiaſticall
order of the Spiritualty, and to
bring the temporall eſtate of the Empire
and royall power of Princes to ruine &amp;
decay.Pomerā reporteth this of Luther in oratio ne fune. in exequiis Lu.
                They were not aſhamed moſt impudently
to ſay it. They were not afraid
moſt deſperatly to attempt it. What was
he that was wont whiles he was yet aliue
to rehearſe this verſe, and to ſaye it
ſhould be the Epitaph of his graue?
            Thy foe, O Pope, I was aliue,
My Death thy Death ſhall eke contriue.Hoſtis eram viuus, moriens tua mors ero Papa
            
            Who was ſo impudent to wryte to the
king of England and ſay: whiles I lyue
I wil be the Popes enemy, and when I
die, I wilbe his dubble enemy. Do what
ye can ye Hoggiſhe Thomiſtes, ye ſhall
finde Luther a Beare in your waye,Luth. li. contr. Re. Ang. a
Rampinge Lioneſſe in your walkinge
Pathe.
            And touching their doinges, who is
able to expreſſe in wordes, what coſt and
charges, what paines and trauayles,
what anguiſh and care of minde the noble
Emperour Charles the fift was put

vnto, by the occaſion of theſe Peſtilent
Sectes and outragious ſeditions? How
many Cities? How many Fortreſſes and
Caſteis? How many Abbeis? How many
Hoſpitals for poore people? How many
common Scholes and Colleges? How
manye honorable Palaices and Gentlemens
houſes? Howe many Religiouſe
places and Cloiſters hathe this Goſpelliſhe
Rebellion quite ouertourned and
ſacked?
            Theſe mennes Religion is altogether
Negatiue and denying: they denye in
word all thinges that appertain to Chriſtian
religion, to the furtherance of godlineſſe
and vertue.
            It is allſo deſtructiue, and euer deſtroying:
their deedes are alwayes employed
in caſtynge downe and ouerthrowing.
They builde nothing, they
affirme nothing: the denying and marring
of our Religion, is the foundation
and making of their Sects. The ſacking

examples of true Chriſtian Religion and
vertue were put to death and hanged vpon a galowes, that is yet to be ſeen in ye
market place of that Citie.
            An other old Religiouſe man night
foure ſcore yeares of age of the Abbey of
S. Euuerte there, when he had eſcaped
out of Orleans, and gotten a mile or two
from the Citie, was taken by the ſouldiours
of the Goſpell in a certaine Village
called Mareau, where he had receaued
his maker that morning preparing
himſelf to die, &amp; out of hād they ſtrip him
ſtarke naked, and caſte a rope with a riding
knot about his necke, and ſo pulled
him &amp; drew him a long the ſtreate. When
they ſaw he was now at deaths doore, &amp;
geuing ouer ſtruggling gaſped for breath
they toke awaye death from him leaſte it
ſhould eaſe him to ſone of his paine,
they vntied and looſed ye corde, they toke

theyr marke to ſhoote at with theyr harquebuzes
and gunnes, for exerciſe ſake
and practice of theyr feates of warre.

An others bealy they opened, &amp; wounde
out his guttes about a ſtaffe ſofte and
faire, he being yet aliue and looking on
his own entrayles.
            They came to an other good parſon of
a Village in the countree who laye ſore
ſick in his bedde, ſo worne &amp; ſpente with
ſicknes, that for very weaknes he was
not able to ſtād on his fete. They plucke
him out of his bedde by force, they hale
him in his ſherte bare headed, barefoote
and barelegd out into the ſtreate. &amp; after
they had ſported and mocked like mad
men about him a while, they pull him in
to y• Churche yt was there hard by, they
hoyſe him with a rope vp to the roode
that ſtode a highe ouer the quiere doore,
and there hanged him vp vppon the crucifix.
            I haue yet freſſh in my remembrance,
yea my thinke I ſee yet now before my
eies the teares of certaine honeſt men
in Orleans, who for weeping &amp; ſnobbing
could ſcante abide to tell me, how
miſerably how cruellie, how vnmercifully
a certaine vertuouſe mā a Prieſt,
withe whome they had been familiar
                  •
               
               
and acquainted in his life time) was handeled
&amp; murdred by theſe cruel butchers.
The poore honeſt man (as they told me)
got on a beggers cloke, and a ſcripp full
of cruſtes of old vinowed bread, &amp; ſcraps
of meate ſuch as beggars haue, &amp; being
ſo diſguyſed had eſcaped, as he thought,
out of all gunneſhot and danger, when
behold, ſodenlie Caluines ſouldiours
ouertake him on the waye being now
weerie and nighe out of breath. And, as
theſe kind of people are verie ſuſpiciouſe,
wel practized and experte in al miſchiefe,
they aſke and examine him verie diligētlie,
what he was, and whence he came.
When by long examination and muche
threatning they vnderſtood at length yt
he was a Prieſte, they brought the innocent
poore man bound like a theef into
the next Village, and there in the open
market they make an auction and ſale of
him, as if he had bene a bondman, and
aſke, if anie man would geue readie mony
for him.
            The inhabitāts there flocked together
&amp; were maruelouſlie amaſed &amp; aſtonied
at ſo ſtrange a caſe, they beginne to intreate

for him, they praye them, and holding
vp theyr handes to heauen they
beſeeche them hartelye, that they would
dimiſſe &amp; let goe the innocent &amp; harmeleſſe
man, and doe him no more harme:
that they would conſider, that he was a
Chriſtian man, the image of God and
anoynted prieſt. But it had been as good
they had told a tale to a tubbe, or whiſpered
in a deaf mans eare. For all Heretikes
haue ſtonie hartes, they can not be
mollified. It is the nature and propertie
of men, and not of diuelles, to be moued
with mercie and pitie towardes ſuche,
as are in miſerie.
            To be ſhorte, firſt they pull out both
his eies, then they cut of ye toppes of his
fingers whiche had been ſometimes anoynted
with holie oyle, and flea with a
knife the ſkynne of y• crowne of his head
whiche was ſhauen (according to the ancient
Cuſtome &amp; Cannons) Prieſtlike.
After they had thus mangled hym, to the
end the cruell butchers of the Goſpell
might haue ſome more paſtime in mockinge
and laughing at him, they leade
him along the ſtreat ſtark naked, ſauing

that he had a poore ſhurte on, to couer
his black, blew and blouddie bodie, and
diſioynted bones that were bruſed and
wel nigh all cruſſhed wt buffets blowes
and wondes. At laſt when euerie man
had his fyll of this vnmercifull, cruell,
and raging mad paſtine, they binde the
conſtant Martyr of Chriſte, with a rope
vpright againſte a tree, and with theyr
gunnes ſhot at him ſo often, that they
perced all his bodye throughe full of
holes.

with all their heartes.
            They thirſt after bloud, and can neuer
haue their fill of it, nor quench their thirſt
with it. They would faine that all good
men were rid out of the way and deade.
nor they thinke it ſufficient to haue them
all dead: they wold wiſh they died a hundred
times, if it were poſſible for a deade
man to reuiue and liue againe a hundred
times. They inuent and deuiſe incredible
faſhions and meanes of cruelty, ſuche
as neuer man hard of before, they are very
witty and expert in imagining newe

kindes of tormentes.
            There was betwene Paris and Orleaus
an honeſt man a Curate of a certaine
village: this man the Hugono
                  •
               es (as
they call them) drew in by force &amp; might
againſt his will into their Inne, where
they lodged. When they had him there,
the moſt wicked butchers firſt cut of his
priuie membrers, then they open his bely,
he being yet then aliue and loking on,
and with their bloudy hands pull out his
guttes and all his bowels, and caſte his
entrailes about all the houſe.
            If any man ſuſpect that I faine, and imagine
of my owne head this wonderful
cruel deede, and lie vpon them: I am able
to bring for witneſſe of this butchery yt I
tell you, a ſubſtantiall man both honeſt &amp;
worſhipfull, one of the Prebendaries of
the goodlye Cathedrall Churche of S.
Croſſe in Orleans. This man, (whome
I woulde here name to his worſhippe, if
I coulde call his name to my remembraunce)
all the while this vile and cruell
murder was a doing, laye hid in that
houſe ſhut vp in a cheaſt or benche, and
ſo eſkaped theſe Tyrannes cruel handes,

&amp; ſaw this ſorowfull &amp; lamentable ſight
through the chinks of the benche wherein
he laie.
            But what neede I bringe any witneſſe
for the profe of ſuch things as are notoriouſe
and manifeſte, as being committed
in the preſence and ſight of al the country?
Our aduerſaries are not aſhamed to cō
               feſſe
it them ſelues, they rubbe theyr forheaddes,
caſte awaie all ſhame and honeſtie,
and bluſſhe not a whit to graunt
that they haue done ſuch things in deede,
yea they laugh, and ieſte, &amp; make a mocking
game of it, &amp; do reioyce &amp; triumph
in theyr wicked crueltie. And ſome of thē
at theyr death (and God wil) do comforte
them ſelues eſpecially with ſuch deedes
of mercie and workes of charitie.
            There was one of theſe Butchers at
Paris the laſte yeare condemned to be
hanged for murder in the market place
called Place Maubert, and when the halter
was about his neck, he beganne to
reioyce in good earneſte, and to brag that
ſometymes he had worne about his neck
a coler made of prieſts eares. and wiſſhed
that other of his brethren in the Lorde

would followe that notable example of
his: and becauſe that, dying in ſo high degree
he had no authoritie by the lawe to
make his teſtament, this exhortation and
counſel ſtoode in ſteed of his laſte will &amp;
teſtament.
            They broke and burned the croſſe,An. 1453. Vide Dubitantiū Lindani. pag. 298. and
mocked at it euerie where as the Turkes
did ſometyme at Conſtantinople, neither
were they ſatiſfied with that: they toke
two innocent good Prieſtes and hanged
them vp on eche ſide of the Crucifix like
the two theeues for contempt &amp; reproche.
Other had theyr faces and fingers fleied,
theyr noſes, eares, and priuie members
cut of, theyr heades clouen with a ſword
at one ſtroke in two partes. Some they
burned aliue, and yet moſte commonly
they are wonte to pull vp the dead out of
theyr graues, yea and they toke maruelouſe
delight &amp; pleaſure to cut litle children
and babes in two at one ſtroke with
a ſword. And theſe were the ſtrainge and
wonderfull miracles that theſe Poſtles
wrought at S. Macaries.
            Now what they did to a notable vertuoſe
old man, a Religiouſe Prieſte at

Mans the chiefe Citie of Cenomania in
Fraunce, I am afraid, yea I tremble and
quake to rehearſe. That horrible Act don
emong Chriſtian men hath defamed and
blemiſhed the name, not only of all Chriſtians,
but allſo of Heathens, Turkes,
and all mankinde.
            Many excellent &amp; graue wryters haue
put in wryting manye a time and often,
that there be in ſome partes of the world
Anthropophagi, that is, ſuche people as
do eate mannes fleſh.Du ſacc. fo. 72. But that any wold
compell a man to eate and ſwalow down
the priuy partes of his owne body, being
cut of and broyled on a grediern, and thē

               mit
ſuch a dede ſo ſtrange, ſo abhominable,
ſo diueliſh wer neuer yet foūd or hard
of before theſe our daies of Reformation.
Such a deteſtable &amp; brutiſh acte was neuer
done or practiſed amōg any deſperate
&amp; wild people, among barbarous &amp; rude
natiōs, amōg moſt fierce and cruell brute

beaſts before this our vnhapy time. And
what was ye cauſe (I pray you) of this ſo
cruel &amp; ſtrainge puniſhment? What had
this mā offēded? what was his treſpaſſe?
            In the old time he that had killed his

him, was caſt aliue into the ſea, if it were
nigh, els into the next riuer. So yt being
yet aliue he loſt the vſe and ſeruice of al y•
foure elements at ones, the aier, the fire,
the earth, ye water, becauſe he had bereued
that man of his life, by whoſe benifite he
was brought to the world, and to the vſe
of all theſe.
            And this ſtrainge kind of moſt ſhameful
&amp; ignominious puniſhment &amp; death,
was executed only vpon thoſe yt had killed
their parēts, for their vnnatural, vile
and abhominable offenſe. But this mā, yt
was put to ſo ſtrainge, filthy, &amp; infamous
kind of moſt cruel death, who was cōpelled
againſt nature to eat his owne fleſh,
which euery man ſpareth and cheriſheth,

haue bene of likelihood giltie of ſuch, ſo
great, ſo vilanouſe a treſpace, that excepte
he had bene rydde out of the waye and
put to the moſte cruell death that coulde
be inuented, the whole frame of all the
world muſt nedes haue fallen downe and
peryſſhed. And yet to this miſerable
man, who ſhalbe ſpoken of hereafter to y•
worldes end, and be peraduenture the
rufull argument and lamentable matter
of tragicall ſtages, this only faulte was
laied, that he was a Chriſtian man, a Catholike,
a Prieſt.
            It was againſte theyr will that y• Miniſters
of the Goſpell puniſhed him ſo
cruelly, but yet for Reformations ſake
they could not chuſe but of neceſſity do it.
            For reformations ſake alſo I doubt not
(as the Reformed brethren in Chriſt doe
fondly beleue) they ſacked,The Author of this oration hath ſeen all theſe ruines. ſpoiled &amp; threw

of that noble and renoumed Citie,

they ſpared to put in their Harneſſe, Artiliary

chiefe Cathedrall Churche S. Croſſe,
which they reſerued ſtanding (but yet all
to rifled, raſed and mangled) to preach in
and to be the place of their dailye walke
for recreation.
            The Engliſhe men, who by the lawe
of armes, by manhode, princely proweſſe
and force of warre had conquered and
wonne well nigh all Fraunce, could neuer
ouercome and get the ſtrong, mighty,
and moſt defenſed walles and rampiers
of Orleans. But this Goſpelliſh Refourmation
in this laſt Inſurrection in
Fraunce, hath filled vp the Ditches with
earth, ſtones, and rubbell, hath throwen
downe to the ground, the ſureſt towres,
the ſtrongeſt Bulwarkes, all the defenſe
of the Towne, and all the ſtronge holdes

The moſte Chriſtian king Lewys the
eleuenth his body was buried Honorably
and princely, in a goodly tumbe richly
garniſhed, with his Image grauen on
the outſide, in our Lady Church at Clery,
foure leagues from Orleans. For reformations
ſake they did hew the kinges
Image in peeces, cut of his armes, feete
and head: and when they thoughte they
had ſufficiently puniſhed the Image, they
open the ſumptuous &amp; honorable graue,
pluck vp the kinges body out of the lead
wherein it was encloſed, caſte it into the
fire and burne it, and at laſte they ſpoyle
the goodly Church that was trimly builded
with coſtly and faire worke, they vncouered
the toppe of it, and caſte it quite
downe.
            For Refourmations ſake the harte of
good king Francis the ſecond (who died
lately poyſoned,Claud. d Sainctes fol. 70. as it is thought, by the
meanes of theſe Goſpellers,) that was
buried before the highe Aultare in the
Churche of S. Croſſe at Orleans, was
digged out of the ground, broyled on a
grediern, and at laſt burned.
            For Reformatiōs ſake, Orleās, Roan,

Lions, and many other rich Townes in
Fraunce, the whiche floriſhed ſometime
with great traficke of marchaundiſe, are
brought to extreame pouertye and miſerable
lacke and ſcarcitie of all things neceſſary.
And haue fewer occupiers, porer
Marchauntes, and are leſſe hanted, then

            How many parents bereaued of their
children, how many children benummed
of their Parentes, how many Widowes
weping for ye death of their huſbāds, how
many Burgiſes turned out of houſe and
home, are nowe to be ſene commonlie in
Fraunce latelye reformed, and all for reformations
ſake?
            S. Peter had neither golde nor ſiluer,Act. 3.
nor yet paſſed vpō the getting of any: he
gaue to y• pore man that aſked his almes,
helth in ſtede of money. But theſe newe
Poſtles the diſciples of Iudas Iſcarioth
and Simon Magus, who trauail toth &amp;
nail not to alter &amp; change, but to aboliſhe
and take quite and cleane away both law
and Prieſthode, haue exceadinge greate

ſtore of gold and ſyluer which they ſcraped
and gathered together by robbinge
and ſpoiling and ſacrilegiouſe 
                  •
               acking of
Churches, and yet they geue neither money,
nor helth to ſuch as aſk their almes:
they feede them with faire wordes, and
geue them ſometymes ſtripes, blowes,
wondes and moſt cruell death in ſteed of
almes.
            They ſay that the Cleargie is to riche,
and therefore they take away both from
them, and from the laietie alſo without
reſpect or partialitie, ſuch hindrance letles
&amp; impedimentes of pietie, deuotion,
and perfection: And they them ſelues in
the meane tyme, good men, doe beare
patiently vpon their neckes the ſynnes
of the people, and al this traiſh &amp; mucke
and heauie burdens. They throw down
townes and Cities, ouerthrow Temples
and Churches, to get gold, without
the which theyr Goſpell can not be planted,
the world can not be refourmed, yea
they go into y• bowelles and bottome of
the earthe. They robbe the dead to fill
theyr owne purſes, they open and breake
vp ſepulchres and graues to haue y• very

lead wherein dead mens bodies, bones
and aſſhes are wrapped.
            What tounge is able to expreſſe in
wordes the ſpoile, ſaccage and ruines,
of the Churches of Poictiers, Lions, and
of other townes in al quarters of France?
This is moſte certaine, that Beza and
his companions, Theeues &amp; curthrotes
like him ſelfe, ſtole out of the Churches
and Veſteries at Tours two thouſand
markes in ſyluer, and a thouſand marke
in gold, beſides pretiouſe ſtones, chaines
and other Iewels, and ornamentes of
greate valew, yea and that with ſuche a
rage, ſuch an vnmeaſurable deſyre and
outragiouſe couetouſnes, ſuch a furiouſe
affection and thyrſte of ſtealing and hauinge,
that they ſcratched all that euer
they could by anie meanes, and lefte not
as much as a naile or peece of yron behinde
them.
            And byſydes all this, the Holy Beza
dubbled this myſcheuous robbery of his
with an other enormous outrage, ſo
haynouſe and greate, that no condigne
and worthy poniſſhment can make ſufficient
amendes for it. For he toke away

the ſacred Relyques of the bleſſed Archebyſſhoppe
of Tours, the body and
aſſhes of S. Martyne the Greate Confeſſor,
that had bene kepte there,Diuus Martinus Epiſ. Turonenſ. floruit An. Do. 384. Tempo. S Amb. &amp; Chry. &amp; caet. with
greate reuerence ſo many hundred yeres,
notwithſtandinge the often warre and
cruell perſecutions of diuerſe enemies
both heathen and Chriſtian. And when
he had taken them out of the Shrine,
he burnte them with fyere, and then
gathered vp the holy and bleſſed aſſhes,
and threwe them into the

Riuers.
            O wonderfull Impietye and madnes
of raginge Heretikes, O beaſtly
and more then Barbarouſe rudenes and
crueltie. What Tyranne euer in anye
Lande was ſo fierce and cruell, that

woulde perſecute, teare and mangle
all good men, not only in theyr lyfe
tyme, but alſo after they were departed
out of thys world, and buried in theyr
graues? Theſe cruell Graueroo
                  •
               ers,
that labor to brynge a newe Religion
into Chriſtendome, can not abyde, that
good men ſhoulde lyue any where on
the earth, nor yet ſuffer them to reaſte
vnder the earth in theyr graues after
theyr deceaſe.
            They couer with Sylke, and decke
with veluettes theyr owne fylthye bodies,
and theyr Womens moſte vyle
and ſtynkinge carcaſſes, whiche (without
the greate mercy of God) ſhallbe
one daye the ſtuffe and matter of Helfyre,
and carrayne for death and damnation
to feede on: And wyll they not
ſuffer the bleſſed bodies and▪ boues of
Sayntes, that ſhallbe in the end placed
in Heauen with theyr bleſſed ſoules,
(whiche are there before in peace, and
reaſt, and ioye with Chriſte) to be in
the meane tyme cloſed in lead, or couered
with ſtone, or layed vnder earth
and claye?
            
               
It is happy, they can not plucke theyr
holy Soules out of heauen to, as they
doe al theyr endeuor to deſtroy and vtterly
rydde theyr bodies out of the earth.
For if they could gette them thence, &amp; ſet
themſelues in theyr places, it appereth
here by this good wil of theirs in ye one,
what they would doe in the other: and
that is no more, but euen to follow their
Grand Capitaine Lucifer. For as he
would haue done to God himſelf, when
he ſayed in his harte, he would clyme aboue
al ye ſtarres of God, and be Gods
owne fellowe and ſyt faſte by his ſyde:
euen ſo by al likelihod, theſe men would
doe to Gods fryndes and ſeruantes. that
is, robbe them of all glory, and of theyr
places both in heauen &amp; earth, if it lay in
theyr power ſo to doe. But though God
geue them alitle leaue on theyr bodies
whiche is all that they, or the the diuell
hath any power vpon (For the Serpent
feedeth on the earth and crepeth on his
belie,Gen. 3. and can do no more) yet Sanctorum

reaſt and raigne with him, that all the
malice of y• diuelles in hell, or theyr ſeruantes
in earth cannot once touche, nor
come nere them, what euer they doe in
the meane tyme to theyr bodies.
            I cannot let paſſe, but rehearſe and
note here vnto you ſurely a notable Hyſtorie
out of Euſebius, of the perſecutiōs

                  un.
by which it may be thought in cōferring
the one with the other, that theſe men
nowe be of the ſame feruēt and hot zeale
(as themſelues terme it) of the ſame
mynde &amp; opinion in theſe lyke actes of
theyrs, as ye curſed Paynyms were then
toward the Chriſten folke, whome they
perſequuted and put moſt cruelly to
death. For they, not content with all the
terrible tourmentes, paynfull deathes &amp;
Martyrdomes executed vpon them,
would not ſomuch as ſuffer theyr bodies
to be buried, but threw them to dogges,
and kept ſtraight watche day and
night, y• noman ſhould take them away,
but that y• dogges ſhould deuoure them
in deede. And if the beaſtes, or the fyre
leaſte any part of theyr bodies not confumed,

they toke the bones and aſſhes,
and the duſte, and all together, &amp; threwe
into ye Riuer: thinking thereby to ouercome
and conquere God himſelfe, that
neyther he ſhoulde be able to gather
theyr aſſhes together, and make theyr
bodies aliue againe, as they were before?
nor they haue any hope of Reſurrection,
out of theyr graues, being out of all hope
of graue, or any kynd of buriall at all.
            This doth Euſebius wryte &amp; reporte
out of the very letters and Autentyke
wytteneſſe of the Chriſten folke &amp; Martyrs
there at that tyme.Circiter An. 160. in qua perſ
                     •
                  cutione paſsi ſunt Irenaeus, Photinus, Blā
                  dina &amp;c. And if we ſhal
cōpare together thoſe myſcreantes then,
with theſe our myſſeſhapen Chriſtians
nowe, I cannot ſee wherein they any
thing differ from them: but well may I
ſone ſee, that in ſome pointes theſe
matche them, &amp; go beyonde them to. For
the perſons and holy Sayntes of God,
againſt whome all this crueltie and extremitie
of malice is ſhewed, be all one,
of the ſame Catholike fayth and Religion,
and much about the ſame age and
tyme, far within ſyxe hundred yeres
after Chriſte. And what els is the cauſe,

that our newe Goſpellers doo ſo perſecute,
ſpette at, and abhorre theyr bones
and aſhes nowe, but for the hate they
haue both to them and theyr Catholique
Religion, if they durſt ſo playnly for
ſhame cōfeſſe it, as by ye diuelles perſuaſion
they doo in theyr hartes beleue it.
            The Paynyms would not only themſelues
not burie the dead bodies of the
Sayntes, but dyd alſo moſt cruelly forbyd,
and moſt ſtraightly watche, that
none other mā, nor Chriſten nor heathen
moued with pitie, ſhould ſteale them away
and burie them. What els meane
theſe Captaine Proteſtants nowe, but y•
neyther they, nor any good Chriſtē man
in deede, ſhall ſee any ſuch holy bodies
reuerently buried and layed in graue?
            The heathen Infidelles cruelly kylled
the Chriſtians, as theyr mortal enemies,
and threwe theyr bodies to beaſtes to deuoure:
Theſe worſe than Infidelles take
vp the bodies that haue ſo long lyen ſtyl,
ſpoyle the graues and Sepulchres, and
prophane all together moſt impiouſly.
            The Infidelles, to wreake theyr preſent
āger, forbyd burial to their enemies,

being newly 
                  •
               layen, theyr blood yet
warme, and the tormentors wrath yet
freſſh and fierce: theſe fell perſecutors
denie them buriall, yea moſt violently
ſpoyle them of theyr graues, which they
had quietly kepte and poſſeſſed ſo many
hundred yeares. Whome if they take for
theyr fryndes, why order they ſo cruelly:
and if for theyr enemies, why haue they
not forgot all yre and malice after ſo lōg
tyme of ſo many hundred yeares?
            The myſbeleuing Paynyms thought,Twelue hundred yeres and aboue.
that the Chriſten men ran wyllingly to
ſuffer all kynde of torment and death for
Chriſtes ſake, becauſe of the hope they
had to lyue and ryſe againe, and enioy a
better lyfe &amp; croune of euerlaſting glorie.
And that therefore they deſyred ſo
muche to be honeſtly buried, that theyr
fleſh and bodies might lye together, and
ſo the more eaſyly be reyſed vp and made
againe by the power of God. And to the
end, that God might not come by theyr
fleſh, and ſynowes, and bones, nor they
haue any hope at all of Reſurrection, and
thereby alſo be dryuen from theyr conſtant
and patient ſuffring for Chriſtes

ſake: they ſought the meanes not only
not to burie them, but alſo that God
ſhould not any where fynde and come by
theyr fleſh and bones, &amp; aſſhes againe:
but toke all, and gaue it to beaſtes to
deuoure, and to the fyre to conſume. and
then what the beaſtes &amp; fyre had leafte,
they threw earth and aſſhes and al togegether
into the Riuer, to be vtterly diſperſed,
and neuer to be recouered and
got together againe.
            Whether Beza &amp; his fellowes in theyr
like dede of burning the Reliques and
holy bodies of Sayntes, and throwing
theyr bones and aſſhes into the Riuer,
haue alſo the lyke mynde and opinion of
Gods power and Reſurrection: I committe
to the ſecrete iudgement of God,
who moſt certaynly both ſeeth theyr
thoughtes, and the moſt priuie corners &amp;
ſecretes of theyr hartes, and ſhall reyſe
vp his holy Sayntes &amp; Martyrs bodies
to immortal lyfe and glory, where euer ye
cruell Infidell, or impiouſe Heretike
ſcatter and flyng them abrode in ye wyde
world.
            But in the meane tyme well may we,

(as Chriſten men dyd then in thoſe grea
perſecutions, when they could by no
meanes be ſuffred to bury ye dead bodies)
lament to ſee &amp; heare of this Heathen &amp;
Myſcreant maner, this more then Turkyſh
crueltie of ſuche, as would be not
only counted true Chriſtiās, but alſo pretend
&amp; ſtoutly take vpon them to be Refourmers
of the Catholike fayth. Wel
may we rue, and be ſory to ſee this daye.
Well maye I nowe and worthely crye
out, and make exclamation: O moſt
mercyfull lord, O euerlaſting God of
heauen and earth: what a wycked and
Barbarous Religion, or rather Irreligion,
what a ſtrange and rude Reformation,
or rather Deformation is
this, that purſueth with famine, fyre
and ſworde all good men, euery where,
and allwayes, yea, after they are departed
this lyfe? that encreaſeth, gathereth
force, and is ſtrengthened with
turmoyling and troubling all Common
weales and good Order, with robbing &amp;
ſpoylinge theyr owne contreemen and
neighboures, with contemning and prophaning

all holie and Spirituall things,
with breaking vp and violating of Sepulchres,
Schrines, and Graues, with
kylling &amp; murdering all faythfull Subiectes,
with daſſhing and huddeling all
the affayres &amp; good orders of the whole
worlde together, wt blaſphemies, madnes,
furie, rage, crueltie, butcherie far
paſſing the Turkes Tyrannie?
            What els ſhall we coniecture &amp; deeme
to haue been the marke and end, intente
and pourpoſes of ſuche Refourmers as
theſe be, if it were not to aboliſhe &amp; roote
out quite all Chriſtian Religion out of
the world? they haue omitted no kinde of
crueltie that could be deuiſed, they haue
ſlayne and murdred the honorable and
worſhippull, the ſubſtantiall and vertuouſe
ſubiectes, they haue ſpared noe
ſtate, nor age. The rage and furor
of theſe ſauage &amp; Barbarouſe wretches
hath extended it ſelf and waxen fearce
and cruell againſte children, women and
old men: who were ſo weak, that they
were not able nor to hurte other, nor
yet to defend and ſaue themſelues.
            
               
There was a companie of honeſt mēs
Children,This cruel dede was don in a Village called Patte not far from Orleans. who for feare of theſe madbraines
paſſing by, ranne to hyde themſelues
into a Churche. the villaines did
ſet a fire and burned both the Churche, &amp;
the chyldren together, and when ſome of
ye poore infantes lept out of ye fire to ſaue
their liues, theſe cruel broilers &amp; vnmerciful
murdrers far exceding the tyrannie
of the wicked Herode flong the ſeelie innocentes
aliue into the fire againe. They
had no care, nor regard at all of honeſtie,
ſhame or chaſtitie. They ſtripped an honeſt
mayed ſtark naked as euer ſhe was
borne, in the middes of the ſtreate at Orleans.
And when ſhe ſtood ſo, openlie among
them, ye bawdie ribaudes Sardanapalus
ſouldiours feeled and groped
her ſhamefullye, filthylie, and againſte
all the lawes of nature, to ſerche forſooth
if ſhe had hidden anie money, aboue the
rate of the proclamation, to carie priuilie
out of the town about her.
            The traytor by Angiers which kept a
caſtle againſte his Souueraigne lord and
maſter the King, and toke a Noble woman
and hāged her in a baſket by a rope

ouer the Caſtle wall for a bullwarke
againſt ye force &amp; ſhorte of the Kings artillarie
and battering pieces, did ſuerlie
a more cruell and vnmercifull acte: but
yet not ſo durtie, filthye and bawdie, as
this fowle deed which nature abhorreth.
            Theyr full po
                  •
               rpoſe and intent was,
to pille, robbe and ſpoile all they could
get, &amp; to leaue nothing vntouched. Gabaſtone
the maſter of y• watche or rather
the maſter of miſſerule at Paris ſeemed
plainlie to confeſſe and proteſte, that this
was their mening, at what time he was
in the companie of theſe Sacrilegiouſe
Refourmers at the ſpoiling of S. Medardes
Churche there in the firſte beginning
of the trouble, and rode on his horſe
into the quiere before the highe Aulter,
and there gabbled and cried to his mates
in his barbarouſe Gaſcoigne Frenche,
Pilla tout, Pilla tout, that is, ſpoile all,
ſpoile all.
            Is there anie thing I pray you, more
fearce, more cruell, more horrible, that
men ſhould need to feare at the Turkes
handes, if he had been in place, then that
we haue ſeen, to our greate greife, ſmarte

and dammage, attempted and committed
by theſe vile Pages, and Pedlers of
this newe Goſpell? Truelie I beleue
Soliman ye great Turke himſelf would
neuer haue ſuffred Virgines and profeſſed
Nunnes to be ſo filthylie defloured
and forced by rape, the Prieſtes and ſeruantes
of God to be ſo villanouſlye and
ſpitefullye handeled, all holye thinges
conſecrate to Gods ſeruice and honoure
to be ſo wickedlie defiled and profaned,
finallie the verie bleſſed and pretiouſe
bodie of our lord and maſter Chriſte himſelf
to be with ſuche furiouſe and outragiouſe
impietie, caſte on the grownd,
trod vnder foote, hurled into the fire
and into the water, and ſo deſperatlie to
be prickt with theyr ſwerdes, and caried
vppon the toppes of theyr ſpeares.
            Verylie thus I thinke, and thus my
mynd geues me (right worſhipfull and
learned) that except that onelye Noble
man, the right honorable Duke of Guyſe
had withſtood theyr furiouſe attempts,
and defeated theyr moſte cruel aſſaultes
and deſperate enterpriſes, that moſt Noble
parte of Chriſtendome the whole

cōmon weale and Realme of France had
been vtterlie vndone and loſte. And that
notable vertuouſe mā, a perſonne moſte

glaſſe &amp; bright ſhining light of al France
whiles he went about to quenche the
flame, to parte y• ſtrife, to appeace y• ſedition
of his contreie, was traiterouſlie &amp;
cruellie murdred by the meanes, counſel
and vnmercifull conſpiracie of that vile
Caytif Beza, the inuenter &amp; coyner of al
theſe michiefes, &amp; ſeruante &amp; bondſlaue of
al bawdie luſte, fylthie concupiſcence, and
all deteſtable ſinne and vice.
            I feare me leaſte I ſeeme to paſſe ye limites
&amp; cōpaſſe of ye time apointed for me
to ſpeake by y• cuſtome of this Schole, &amp;
to abuſe your gentel patience &amp; ſuffrance

infinite deſperatnes crueltie, &amp; madnes
of theſe hariſhe Miniſters, traiterouſe
Refourmers and brutiſhe Heretikes.
            
               
To be ſhorte, your wiſdomes I doubt
not doe plainlie now perceaue, that this
theyr warre for Religion againſte God
and all true Religion, hath been made,
nother iuſtelie, nother orderlie, nother to
anie good effect or furtherance of Refourmation.
Ye ſee now as clere as the
bright ſhining ſonne, that the Proteſtā
               tes
of our time ranne raiſſhelie together
and toke weapon in 
                  •
               hand without anie
iuſte cauſe, reaſonable occaſion, or ſufficient
quarell: that they badde and proclaimed
warre againſte theyr countrey,
againſt theyr Souueraignes, againſte y•
Catholike Churche of Chriſte without
anie commiſſion, power or Authoritie: yt
they fought that battaille to fearcelie, to
vnmercifullie, and to cruellie, to the exceding
great iniurie, harme and wrong
of all good men, to the incredible hindrance,
and dammage of all Chriſtendome,
and ſuche l
                  •
               ſſe as can neuer be repayred.
Ye know now theſe new Goſpellers,
the wicked Captaines of theſe
moſte traiterouſe and dangerouſe inſurrections,
ye vnderſtand what maner of
men they be, how vprightlye, how honeſtlie

they liue and behaue themſelues
in the Churche of God, and what they
meane, what they go about, what they
attempt.
            What ſaye you, then by them? what
p
                  •
               niſſhement, thinke you, haue ſuche
bloudſuckers, ſuche cruell butchers deſerued
to ſuffer? what eſtimation, what
degree, what ſtate among Chriſten men
iudge you ſuche verlets to be worthy of,
whome neither ſhame could withdraw
from diſhoneſtie, neither feare keepe of
frome dāger, nother reaſon reuoke from
madnes, nor Religion ſtop from Sacriledge,
nor pitie ſtaie from killing and
murdering of theyr own neighbours?
            At the firſte for a meſſe of potage certaine
looſe friers and fained diſſemblers
of Monaſticall profeſſion fell out at debate
betwene themſelues, &amp; afterward,
they were pricked, dryuen and drawen
by auarice, ambition, and wanton iuſte
of wicked libertie and pleaſure to ſtrike
vp a larme and to bid battaille: and at
length they fought in open field againſte
theyr own contremen, neighbours, and
followes, againſte ye Magiſtrates, Kings

and Emperours, againſt the Biſhops,
againſte the Churche, againſte the Chriſtian
Religion, againſte all good men,
againſt the Sayntes of heauen, &amp; finally
againſte God allmightie himſelf, as the
Gyātes did, of whome ye Poetes in theyr
fables make mention, meaning in deed
ſuch deſperat, raging &amp; wicked caytiffes,
rebelles &amp; miſcreants, as theſe were.
            The falſe traitors &amp; deſperat cutthrotes
brought into the Churche of Chriſte a
curſed kind of Religion, framed, caſte, &amp;
made of wicked whoredomes, &amp; bawdie
bitcherie, of innocent bloud and murder
of true ſubiectes, of all maner of troubleſome
and ſeditious miſchiefe &amp; diſcord,
and all looſenes and libertie to embrace
and f
                  •
               llow vice &amp; ſinne. They haue called
in, holpen, &amp; maintained the enemies
of Chriſtendome, Forayners, Tyrans &amp;
Turkes.
            They haue geuen to the Turke
and added to his dominion and Empire
manie Noble and goodlie countreies &amp;
prouincies of Chriſtendome. They haue
lead an infinite nūber of Chriſten ſoules

to eternall damnation, throwen them
down hedlong to the deepe pit of euerlaſting
fire, and betaken them to the tyrannie
and furie, of the vglie finds and
horrible diuelles of hell.
            They made the holie fonte ſtones
the couers of theyr iakes: yea the durtie
Helhowndes (Oh abhominable acte)
were not aſhamed to laye the excrementes
of theyr vile and wicked bealies
euen in the verie ſacred fonte and place
where Chriſten men were wonte to receaue
theyr Baptiſme.
            There were ſlayen in Germanie with
in three monethes ſpace by the wicked
occaſion and faulte of theſe Refourmers
an hundred and thirtie thouſande men,
and in Fraunce aboue a hundred thouſand,
among whome I recken not the
infinite number of ſuche as died of the
plague there in ye meane time, of whome
the greateſt parte were theſe Cu

               throtes
themſelues, ſpeciallie they of Lyons,
who, as it is reported, did poiſon the
welles &amp; common waters of theyr Citie
for a traiterouſe and wicked intent:

So that by the iuſte iudgement of God
it is brought to paſſe, that there ſcars remaineth
now aliue vppon the earthe y•
fourthe parte of thoſe, who for a great
number being but beardleſſe yong men
and moſte of them witleſſe, &amp; altogether
deſperat and deſtitute of y• feare of God,
attempted to doe ſuche, ſo ſtrainge and
villainouſe deedes.
            I will not ſtaie now to make an accōpte
and iuſte reckening of al thoſe that
throughe this curſed Refourmatiō were
caried to miſerable captiuitie vnder the
Turke, or were ſlayen in the field in defenſe
of Chriſtendome againſte him and
theſe his adherents: and yet this I am
bold to ſaie, that if ye hard the euen tale &amp;

               e in no place: the Profeſſion of

Chaſtitie is ſuſpected, hated and deſpiſed
eueriewhere. Al things are beſette, and
turmoyled with madnes, rage, murder,
fire and ſword The deſperate crie of furiouſe
heretikes doth make all the world
ring, the ſtreates runne of bloud, the
walles of Chapelles and Churches are
ſprinkled &amp; dawbed with the gore blood
and braine of Chriſten men: Al Europe,
being weakened with the cruel warre &amp;
long ſeditions of heretikes, cracks, and
ſhakes and is euen now readie to fall
quite to the ground.
            And now when al this is done, after
al theſe miſcheifs and Tragical offenſes,
yt theſe mad Bedlems, &amp; curſed Caines
haue committed: they blame the Catholiks
and lay crueltie to theyr charge, that
haue ſuffred all theſe iniuries, loſſes, dā

There came furth in printe of late to the
ſight of the world a verie fond fooliſhe

for ſo it liketh them in ſcorne to

and inſurrections of ſubiectes,
(right learned Audience) in theſe verie

and deadlie plague, we haue by
the benefite &amp; mercie of God allmightie,
and the diligent prouiſion of graue and

him ſlewe,
            
               
               
An others bely was cutte, and his guttes
taken out,
            And wounde ſofte and fayre on a ſtaffe
rounde about.
            
               
One out of his bed they pulde lying ſore
ſycke,
            And in the Churche, on the Roode they
hangd him vp quicke.
            
               
               
An other that was fled like a beggar priuilye,
            They tooke, and ſtript, and ſet to ſale with
open outcry.
            They flea his fingers &amp; crowne, and pull out
both his eyes,
            And kill him with their hand 
                  •
               ons, for their
warlike exerciſe.
            
               
               
And other at their bayt into their Inne they
drewe,
            Ript his bely, and his guttes all about the
houſe threwe,
            
               
               
Many Prieſtes had this man by like
maymed and flayne,
            Sith he coulde of their eares make himſelfe
ſuch a chayne.
            
               
Two Prieſtes thus they hanged by the
Roode for theyr game:
            With Chriſt ſo to hange doo they thinke
it a ſhame?
            
               
               
Some had theyr crownes and fingers pared
ſkynne and all away,
            Some theyr noſes and eares cut of by the
barde head.
            Some their priuie members cutte of in moſt
ſhamfull play,
            Some burnt vp, ſome with a ſwerd at a
ſtroke ſtriken dead.
            
               
               
Litle children for theyr paſtime, and triall of
ſtronge arme,
            At a blowe they cutte aſundre, without any
more harme.
            And ſome, that ran away into a Churche,
in theyr ire
            They burnt vp Churche and all, lettinge
none ſcape the fire.
            
               
               
Yet an other olde Prieſt they tooke moſt
cruelly,
            And cut of his membres moſt villanouſly,
            And broyld them on the coles, and made
him thereof eate,
            And ript his belie to ſee, how he could digeſt
ſuch meate.
            
               
               
Kyng Lewys Tumbe and hearſe his
Image coſtly wrought,
            His graue they ſpoyld and brake, and
burned all to nought.
            
               
               
The holy Saintes and Martyrs
            That nowe in blyſſe rayne,
            Theſe men would pull downe
            And martyr onſe againe.
            Elſe why on theyr bodies
            And bones that here reſte,
            Doo they ſhewe ſo much malice,
            As ye ſee here expreſſe?
            
               
               
For ſhame I both hyde from your eares, &amp;
your eyes,
            Howe a mayd was abuſed in moſt ſhamefull
wyſe.
            If Noe curſt his ſonne Cham for his ſhameleſſe
acte,
            More accurſt ſhall theſe Chams be for their
ſhamefull facte.
            
               
               
One Traytor to ſaue his Forte from
gonſhot and all,
            A noble woman in a baſket hangth out
at the wall:
            An other in the Churche ryding armed
cryeth out
            In his gabbling Gaſcoine Frenche,
            Pilla tout, pilla tout.
            
               
               
The ſacred holy Hoſtes kept for our moſt
reliefe,
            Of Chriſtes true bodie, O Lord with
what miſchiefe
            Theſe fellons ſo fell, ſo curſed and ſo vile,
            Burne, ſtyck, caſt on ground, and vnder
feete defile.
            
               
               
                  The trayterous murdring of
The Duke of Guyſe.
               
O noble Duke thy noble Death
            Doth well require of right
            An other maner ſtyle and prayſe,
            Then we can well endite.
            The more thoſe Actes and Death of thine
            Deſerues immortall fame.
            The more thoſe Traytors get themſelues
            Thereby eternall ſhame.
            
               
               The Concluſion and Somme of the
Table.
               O Chriſt: If theſe the firſt frutes be
               This Goſpell doth vs geue,
               The ſame thy Goſpell not to be
               Ful well we may beleue.
               Thy Goſpell is of tydinges good,
               Of loue and peace the ſede:
               This Goſpell doth all tydinges yll,
               All ſtryf and bloudſhed brede.
               PSAL. 138.
               Viri ſanguinum declinate a me.
O ye bloudie men away from me.
