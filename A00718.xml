            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

May it therfore pleaſe your wiſedomes to vnderſtand,
that we in England are ſo far off, from hauing
a church rightly reformed, according to the preſcripte
of Gods woorde, that as yet we are ſcarſe come to the
outward face of the ſame. For to ſpeak of that wherin
the beſt conſent, &amp; whervpon al good wryters accord.
The outward markes wherby a true chriſtian church
is knowne, are preaching of the woorde purely, miniſtring
of the ſacraments ſincerely, and Eccleſiaſticall
diſcipline which conſiſteth in admonition and correction
of faults ſeuerely. Touching the fyrſt, namely the
miniſterie of the word, although it muſt be confeſſed
that the ſubſtance of doctrine by manye deliuered, is
ſound and good, yet here in it faileth, that neyther the
miniſters therof are according to gods word proued,
elected, called, or ordained: nor the functiō in ſuch ſort
ſo narowly loked vnto, as of right it oughte, and is of
neceſſyrie required. For whereas in the olde churche a
trial was had,Act. 2. 21. Act. 6. 3. 1 Tim. 3. 2. 7 Tit. 1. 6. both of their abilitie to inſtruct, and
of their godly conuerſation alſo: nowe, by the letters

allow, and like wel of popiſh maſſe mongers, men for
all ſeaſons, King Henries prieſts, Queene Maryes

with the commonAct. 1. 26. conſent of the whole church: now

and by vnlawfull ſute and buying, preuēt other ſuters
alſo. Then noAct. 14. 23. 2. Cor. 8. 19. miniſter placed in any congregation,
but by the conſent of the people: now, that authoritie
is giuen into the hāds of the biſhop alone, who by his
ſole authoritie thruſreth vpon them ſuch, as they many
times aſwell for vnhoneſt life, as alſo for lacke of
learning, may, and do iſtly diſlike. Then, none admitted
to the miniſterie, butAct. 1. 25. a place was voide before

theſe inconueniences, and to reform theſe deformities
is this: Your wiſedomes haue to remoue aduouſons,

claiming to themſelues therby right to ordayne miniſters,
&amp; to bryng in y• old and true election, which was
accuſtomed to beAct. 1. 26. 6. 2. 3. 14. 23. made by the congregation. You
muſt diſplace thoſe ignorant and vnable miniſters already

muſt plucke down &amp; vtterly ouerthrow wythout hope

congregation a learned &amp; diligent preacher. Remoue
homylies, articles, iniunctions, &amp; that preſcripte order
of ſeruice made out of the maſſe boke. Take away the
Lordſhyp, the loytering, the pompe, the idleneſſe, and
liuings of biſhops, but yet employ thē to ſuch ends as
they were in the old church appoynted for. Let a lawful
and a godly ſeignorie loke y• they preach, not quarterly
or monthly, but contynually, not for fylthy luker
ſake, but of a ready mynde. So God ſhalbe gloryfyed,
your conſcyences diſcharged, and the flocke of Chryſt
(purchaſedAct. 20. 28. wyth hys owne bloud) edyfyed.
            Now to the ſecond poynt, whych concerneth mynyſtratyon
of Sacraments. In the olde tyme, the worde
wasMath. 3. 1 preached, before they were minyſtred: nowe it
is ſuppoſed to be ſuffycyent, if it be red. Then, they
were minyſtred in publikeMar. 1. 5 1. Cor. 11. 18 aſſemblies, now in priuate
houſes. ThenMat. 28. 19. 1. Corin. 4. 1. by miniſters only, now by midwiues,
and Deacons equally. But becauſe in treating
of both the ſacraments together, we ſhould deale confuſedly:
we wyll therefore ſpeake of them ſeuerallye.

And fyrſt for the Lordes ſupper, or holy communion.
            They had no introite, for Celeſtinus a pope brought
it in, aboute the yeare. 430. But we haue borrowed a
peece of one out of ye maſſe booke. They read no fragments
of the Epiſtle &amp; Goſpell: we vſe both.Note, y• we cōdemn not the doctrine conteined theriu. The
Nicene Crede was not red in theyr Communion: we
haue it in oures. There was then, accuſtomed to be an
examination of the communicants, which now is neglected.
Then they miniſtred the ſacrament with common
Actes. 2. 42. 46. Act. 20. 7. and uſual bread: now wt wafer cakes, brought
in by Pope Alexander, being in forme, faſhyon and

Take thou, and eate thou. They vſed no other wordes
but ſuch as Chriſte lefte: We borrowe from papiſtes,

but that which you haue the expreſſe warrant of gods

            Let vs come now to the third parte, which concerneth
eccleſiaſtical diſcipline. The officers that haue to
deale in this charge, are chiefly three, miniſters, preachers,
or paſtors of whom before. Seniors or elders,
and Deacons. Concerning Seniors, not onely theyr
office but their name alſo is out of this engliſh church
vtterly remoued. Theyr offyce was toAct. 15. 4. 1. Cor. 12. 28. gouerne the
church with the reſt of the miniſters, to conſult, to admonyſhe,

almes and diſtribute to the pore: nay, that is the leaſt
peece or rather no parte of theyr function. What then?
to ſing a goſpell when the Biſhoppe minyſtreth the
Communion. If thys be not a peruerting of thys offyce
and charge, let euery one iudge. And yet leaſt the
reformers of our time ſhould ſeeme vtterly to take out
of Gods Churche thys neceſſarye function, they appointe
ſomewhat to it concernyng the poore, and that
is, to ſearche for the ſicke, needy, and impotent people
of the pariſh, and to intimate theyr eſtates, names, and
places where they dwell to the Curate, that by hys exhortation

they may be relieued by the pariſhe, or other
conuenient almes. And this as you ſee, is the nigheſt
parte of his offyce, and yet you muſt vnderſtand it to
be in ſuche places where there is a Curate and a Deacon:
euery pariſh can not be at that coſt to haue bothe,
nay, no pariſhe ſo farre as can be gathered, at this preſent
hath. Now then, if you will reſtore the church to

would be very neceſſary and profytable for the

is the reframing of the diſordered, &amp; to bring
them to repentāce, and

The cheefeſt parte and laſte puniſhment of this diſcipline
is excommunication, by the conſent of the church
determined, if the offender be obſtinate, which howe

miſerably it hath ben by the Popes proctours, and is
by our new Canoniſts abuſed, who ſeeth not? In the

of Chryſte, as ſitting dothe. Not that we make
ſitting a thing of neceſſytie belonging vnto the Sacrament,Gala. 4. 10 Galath. 5. 3. 4. 5. Hebrewes in manye places.
neyther affyrme we that it may not be receyued
other wyſe, but that it is more neare the Inſtitution,
and alſo a meane to auoide the daunger of Idolatry,
whiche was in tymes paſt too common, and yet
is in the hearts of many, who haue not forgotten their
bread god, ſo ſlenderly haue they bene inſtructed?

Agaynſt which we may ſet the cōmaundement. Thou

               5 As for the halfe Communion, whych is yet appoynted
like to the commemoration of the Maſſe, we
ſay little of it, ſauing that we may note, how neare the
tranſlator bounde himſelfe to the Maſſe booke, that
wold not omit it. We ſpeake not of the name of prieſt
wherwith he defaceth the miniſter of Chriſt (bicauſe
the prieſt y• tranſlated it, would perhaps fayne haue
the miniſters of Chriſt to be ioyned with him) ſeeing
the offyce of Prieſthode is ended, Chriſt being ye laſt
prieſt that euer was. To call vs therefore prieſtes as
touching oure offyce, is eyther to call backe agayne the
old prieſthode of the law, which is to deny Chryſt to
be come, or elſe to keepe a memory of ye popiſh prieſthode
of abhomination ſtil amongſt vs. As for ye fyrſt,
it is byHeb. 5. 1. 6 Hebr. 9. 11 Chriſt aboliſhed, and for the ſecond it is of
Antichriſt, &amp; therfore we haue nothing to doe with it.
Such ought to haueEech. 44. 10. 12. 13

are they miniſters of Chriſt, ſent to preach his goſpel,
but prieſts of the Pope to ſacrifyſe for the quick &amp; the
dead, that is to creade vnder theyr feete the bloude of
Chriſt. Suche ought not to haue place amongſt vs, as
the ſcriptures manifeſtly teache. Beſides that we neuer
read in the newe Teſtament, that this word prieſt
as touching offyce, is vſed in the good parte, except it
ſpeake of the Leuiticall prieſthode, or of the prieſthode
of Chryſte.
               6 Sixthly, in this boke three or foure are allowed
for a fyfte number to receiue the communion, and the
prieſt alone together wyth one more, or wyth the ſicke
man alone, may in tyme of neceſsytie, that is, when
there is any common plague, or in time of other viſytation,
miniſter it to the ſicke man, and if he require it,
it may not be denyed. This is not I am ſure like in effect
to a priuate maſſe: that ſcripture
                     
                        〈…〉
                     
                   drinke ye all of
thys, maketh not againſte this, and priuate communion,
is not agaynſt the ſcriptures.
               
                  
7 And as for priuate baptiſme, that wil abide the
touchſtone.Mat. 28. 19 Goe ye (ſayth Chriſte and teache, baptiſing
them. &amp;c. Now teaching is deuorſed from communions
and ſacraments. They may goe alone wtout
doctrine. Women that may1. Cor. 14. 24 1. Tim. 2. 11 not ſpeake in a congregation,
may yet in tyme of neceſſytie, miniſter ye ſacrament
of baptiſme, and that in a priuate houſe. And yet,
thys is not to tie neciſsitie of ſaluation to the Sacraments,
nor to nowſell men vp in that opinion. This is
agreable wt the ſcriptures, &amp; therfore when they bring
the bapti

                  ed childe, they are receiued with this ſpecial
commendation. I certefye you, that you haue don wel,
and according vnto due order. &amp;c. But now we ſpeake
in good earneſt, when they anſwer this: Let them tell
vs, howe thys geare agreeth wyth the ſcriptures, and
whether it be not repugnant or agaynſt the worde of
God? But ſome will ſay that the baptiſme of women
is not commaunded by law. If it be not, why doe you
ſuffer it, and wherfore are the children ſo baptiſed accordingly?
common experience teacheth that it is vſed
almoſt in all places, and fewe ſpeake agaynſt it. And
thys I am ſure of, that when it was put in the booke
that was the meaning of the moſt part that were then
preſent, and ſo it was to be vnderſtande as common
practiſe without controlment doth plainly declare.
               8 The publique baptiſme, that alſo is full of childiſhe
&amp; ſuperſtitious toyes. Firſt in theyr prayer they
ſay y• God by the baptiſme of his ſonne Ieſus Chriſt,
did ſanctify the floud Iordan, and all other waters, to
the myſticall waſhing away of ſynne, attributing that
to the ſigne whych is1. Iohn. 1. 7 Act. 20. 28. Rom. 3. 24 propre to the
                     •
                   worke of God
in the bloud of Chriſte, as though vertue were in water,
to waſhe away ſinnes. Secondly, they require a
promiſſe of the godfathers and godmothers (as they
term them (whych is notRom. 7. 15. 18. 21. Rom. 9. 16. in theyr powers to perform.
Thirdly, they prophane holy baptiſme, in toying
fooliſhly, for that they aske queſtions of an infante,
whych can not anſwere, and ſpeake vnto them, as was

wont to be ſpoken vnto men, and vnto ſuche as being
conuerted, anſwered for themſelues, &amp; were baptized.
Which is but a mockeryGala. 6. 7 of God, and therefore agaynſt
the holy ſcriptures. Fourthly, they do ſuperſtitiouſly
and wickedly inſtitute a new ſacrament, which
is proper to Chriſt only, marking the childe in the forhead
with a croſſe, in token that heereafter he ſhall not
be aſhamed to confeſſe the fayth of Chriſte. We haue
made mention before of that wycked deuorſe of the
worde and ſacramentes. We ſay nothing of thoſe that
are admitted to be witneſſes, what ill choyſe there is
made of them, how conuenyent it were, ſeing the children
of the faythfull onely are to be baptized, that the
father ſhould and might, if conueniently, offer &amp; preſent
his child to be baptized, making an open confeſsion
of that faith, wherin he wold haue his childe baptized,
as is vſed in well reformed churches.
               9 As for Matrimonie, that alſo hathe corruptions
too many. It was wonte to be compted a ſacrament,
and therfore they vſe yet a ſacramental ſigne, to which
they attribute the vertue of wedlocke. I meane the
wedding ring, which they fowly abuſe and dally with
all, in taking it vp, and laying it downe: In putting it
on, they abuſe the name of the Trinitie, they make the
newe marryed man, according to the Popiſh forme, to
make an idol of his wife, ſaying: with this ring I thee
wedde, with my body I thee worſhippe. &amp;c. And bicauſe
in Poperie, no holy action mighte be done without
a maſſe, they enioyne the marryed perſones to receiue
the communion (as they do theyr biſhoppes and
prieſtes when they are made. &amp;c.) other p

as they vſe it by the biſhop alone, to thē that lack both
diſcretion and faithe, it is ſuperſtitious &amp; not agreable

it is vſed only of cuſtom, nor of burial ſermons, which

will ſerue for the accompliſhyng of ſuche things. But

but when the goſpel commeth, then they * al ſtand vp.
For why, they thinke that to be of greateſt authoritie,

and are ignorante that the ſcriptures came from one
ſpirite. When Ieſus is named, then of goeth the cap,
and downe goeth the knees, wyth ſuche a ſcraping on
the ground, that they cannot heare a good while after,
ſo that the word is hindred, but whē any other names
of God are mentioned, they make no curteſie at all, as
though ye names of God were not equal, or as though
all reuerence oughte to be giuen to the ſyllables. We
ſpeake not of ringing, when Mattens is done, and
Accidental abuſes. other abuſes incident. Bicauſe we ſhalbe anſwered,
that by the boke they are not maintayned, only we deſire
to haue a booke to reforme it. As for organes and
curious ſinging, thoughe they be proper to Popyſhe
dennes, I meane to Cathedrall churches, yet ſome others
alſo muſt haue them. The Queenes chappell,

are drawne out of the Popes ſhop togither with theyr

life of the Pope which is the Canon law is Antichriſtian
&amp; deuilliſh, and contrary to the ſcriptures. And
as ſafely may we, hy the warrant of Gods worde ſubſcribe
to allow the dominion of the Pope vniuerſally
to raigne ouer the church of God, as of an archbiſhop
ouer an whole prouince, or a Lorde biſhop ouer a dioceſſe,
which containeth many ſhyres and pariſhes For
the dominion that they exerciſe the archbyſhop aboue
them, &amp; they aboue the reſt of theyr brethren, is vnlawfull,
and expreſly forbidden by the word of God.

a Lorde biſhop, to be a countie Palatine, a Prelate of

Surely, by the Canon law, by which y• biſhops raigne
&amp; rule, they ought to keepe thoſe miniſters, which they
make as long as they haue no liuings and places. We
know three or foure Biſhops in this realm, wold haue
kept ſuch houſes, as neuer none did in this lād, if this
rule had beene obſerued. They clapt them out ſo faſt
by hundreds, and they make them pay wel for their orders,

court,To proue y• the regimēt of y• church ſhoulde be ſpirituall, read Caluin in hys commentaries vpon theſe places. ſyth all men knowe it, and your wiſedomes can
not, but ſee what it is. As all other courts are ſubiecte
to this, by the Popes prerogatiue, yea, and by ſtatute
of this realme yet vnrepealed, ſo is it the fylthy quaue
mire, and poyſoned plaſhe of all the abhominations
that doe infect the whole realme. We ſpeake not of licenſes
graunted out of this courte, to marry in forbidden
times, as in lent, in aduent, in the gang weke, whē
the prieſt in hys ſurpleſſe, ſinging goſpels, &amp; makyng
croſſes, rangeth about in many places vpon the Emberdayes,
and to forbidden perſons,Ephe. 11. 23. &amp; in exempt places.
We make no mention of lycences,1. Theſ. 5. 13. to eate whyte
meat,1. Tim. 5. 2. and fleſh in Lent, &amp; that wyth a ſafe conſcience,
for ryche men that can buy them wyth money,Heb. 10. 30. nor we
ſay nothing how derely men pay for them. As for diſpenſations

                  d boys, tollerations for non
reſidents, bulles to haue two benefyces, to haue three,
to haue more, and as many as they liſt or can get, theſe
are ſo common, that all godly and good men are compelled
wyth grefe of heart, to cry out vpon ſuch abhominations.
We omit excommunication for money, abſolution
for the ſame, and that by abſoluing one man
for another, which how contrary it is to the ſcriptures
the complaints of many learned men by propoſitions
in opē ſcholes propoſed, by wrytings in printed bokes
ſet oute, and by preaching in open pulpits, haue beene
ſuffyciently witneſſed. To conclude, this fylthy courte
hath full power together wyth the aucthoritie of thys

pettie pope, Metropolitane and primate of all Englande,
to diſpenſe in all cauſes, wherein the pope was
wont to diſpence, vnder whych are contained more caſes
and cauſes, then we are able to recken. As for the
Archbyſhop of Yorke, we deale not with him. We referre
him to that learned Epiſtle, which Beza wrote
vnto hym about theſe matters.
               20 And as for the commiſſaries court, that is but
a pettie little ſrinking ditche, that floweth oute of that
former great puddle, robbing Chriſtes church of lawfull
paſtors, of watchfull Segniors and Elders, and
carefull Deacons.1. Cor. 5. 4. In thys court as in the other, * one
alone doth excommunicate, one alone ſitteth in iudgement,
and when he will, can drawe backe the iudgement
whych he hath pronounced, hauing called vpon
the name of God, and that for money which is called
the chaunging of penaunce. In this courte, for non
paiment of two pence, a man ſhall be excommunicated
if he appeare not when he is ſent for, if he doe not as
hys ordinarie would, from whome he had his popiſhe
induction &amp; inſtitution, and to whom he hath ſworne,
Canonicam obedientiam, Canonicall obedience, if he
learne not hys Catechiſme like a good boye wythoute
booke, when it were more meete he ſhoulde be able to
teach others. To conclude: if he be not obedyent to all
theſe Lord biſhops officers, by and by he muſt be cut
of by excommunication. And as it is lightly graunted
and giuen forthe, ſo if the money be paide, and the
court diſcharged, it is as quickly called in again. Thys
courte poulleth pariſhes, ſcourgeth the poore hedge
prieſtes, ladeth Churchwardens wyth manifeſt periuries,
punyſheth whoredomes and adulteryes wyth
toyiſhe cenſures, remitteth without ſatisfying the congregation,
and that in ſecrete places, giueth out diſpenſations
for vnlawful mariages, and cōmitteth a thouſand
ſuch like abhominations. God deliuer al Chriſtians
out of this Antichriſtian tyrannye, where the iudges,
aduocates, and proctors, for the moſt part are papiſts,

and as for the ſcribes and notaries as greedy as
cormorantes, and if they all ſhould perhappes ſee this
wryting, they wold be as angry as waſpes, and ſting
like hornets. Three of them would be inowe to ſting a
man to death, for why they are highe commiſsioners.
All this we ſay ſpringeth out of this pontifical, which
we muſte allowe by ſubſcription, ſetting downe oure
hands, yt it is not repugnant or againſt ye word of god,
we meane this antichriſtian hierarchie, and popiſhe
ordering of miniſters, ſtrange from the word of god,
and the vſe of all wel reformed churches in the world.
               21 We haue almoſt let paſſe one thing worthy the
remēbrance,It contayneth manifeſt blaſphemie, as may appeare. which is, that they take vppon them blaſphemouſly,
hauing neither promiſe nor commaundement
to ſay to theyr newe creatures, receaue the Holie
ghoſt. As though the holy ghoſt were in their power
to geue without warrant, at theyr owne pleaſure.
               And thus much be ſpoken as touching this booke,Epheſ. 1. 17. againſt
which to ſtād, is a wonder to two ſortes of mē,

               The .2. Article.
               That the manner and order appointed by publique
authoritie about the adminiſtration of the ſacraments
and common prayers, and that the apparell by ſufficient
authoritie appointed for the miniſters wythin the
church of England, be not wicked nor againſt ye word
of God, but tollerable, and being commaunded for
order and obedience ſake, are to be vſed.
               For the order of adminiſtration of Sacramentes
and common prayer, enough is ſaid before, all the ſeruice
and adminiſtration is tyed to a ſurpleſſe, in Cathedrall

churches they muſt haue a coape, they receiue

They commonly miniſter the Sacramentes
wythout preaching the worde.
               And as for the apparell,Apparell. though we haue bene long
borne in hande, and yet are, that it is for order and decencie
commaunded, &amp; yet we know and haue proued

                  mlines, but deformitie: No obedience, but diſobedience,
both againſt God and the Prince. We maruell
that they could eſpie in their laſt Synode, that a gray
Amiſe, which is but a garment of dignitie, ſhoulde be
a garment (as they ſay) defyled with ſuperſtition, and
yet that copes, caps, ſurpleſſes, tippe

                  s and ſuche lyke
baggage, the preaching ſignes of popiſhe prieſthode,
the popes creatures, kept in y• ſame forme to this end,
to bryng dignitie and reuerence to the Miniſters and
Sacramentes, ſhoulde be retayned ſtyll, and not abolyſhed:
But they are as the garments of the Idole, to
which we ſhould ſay,h Eſai. 30. 22. 1. Theſ. 5. 22. auant and get thee hence. They
are as the garments of Balamites, of popiſhe prieſts,
enemies to God and all Chriſtians. They ſerue not to
edifycation, they haue the ſhewe of euyll (ſeeing the
popiſh prieſthode is euyll) they worke diſcorde, they
hinder the preaching of the Goſpel, they kepe the memorie
of Egipt ſtill amongſt vs, and put vs in minde
of that abominatiō whervnto they in times paſt haue
ſerued, they bryng the miniſterie into contempte, they
offend the weake, they encourage the obſtinate. Therfore
can no authoritie by the woord of God, with any
pretence of order and obedience commaund them, nor
make them in any wiſe tollerable, but by circumſtances,
they are wicked, and againſt the word of God.
               If this be not playne enoughe by that whyche is
already ſet forth, we mynde by Gods grace to make it

playner, and ſhould doe it better, if it were as lawfull
for vs (as for our aduerſaryes) to publiſh our mindes
in Printe. Neyther is the controuerſie betwixt them
and

                  s as they wold beare the world in hand, as for a
cap, a tippet, or a ſurpleſſe, but for great matters concerning
a true miniſtery and regiment of the churche,
according to the word. Which things once eſtabliſhed
the other melt away of them ſelues. And yet conſider
I pray you, whether theyr owne argument dothe not
choke them ſelues, for euen the verye name of trifles
dothe plainly declare that they oughte not to be maintained
in Chriſtes church. And what ſhal our biſhops
win by it? Forſothe, that they be maintainers of trifles,
and trifling biſhops, conſuming the greateſt part
of theyr time in thoſe trifles whereas they ſhoulde be
better occupied. We ſtriue for true religion &amp; gouernment
of the churche, and ſhewe you the righte way to
throw out Antichriſt both head and taile, and that we
will not ſo much as communicate with the taile of the
beaſt: but they after they haue thruſt Antichriſte out
by the head, go about to pull him in again by the taile,
cunningly colouring it, leaſt any man ſhould eſpie his
foote ſteppes, as Cacus did when he ſtole the Oxen,
For if it might pleaſe her maieſty, by the aduiſe of you
righte Honourable, in thys hyghe Courte of Parliament
to heare vs by wryting or otherwiſe, to defende
our ſelues, then (ſuche is the equitie of our cauſe) that
we would truſt to fynde fauor in her maieſties ſight:
then ſhould appeare what ſlender ſtuffe they bring to
defend themſelues, that are ſo impudent by open wryting
to defend it: then thoſe patched pamphlets made
by ſuddaine vpſtartes, and new conuerts, ſhoulde appeare
in their cullours, and truth haue the victory, and
God the glory. If this can not be obtayned, we wyll
by Gods grace addreſſe our ſelues to defend his truth
by ſuffring, and willingly lay our heads to the blocke,
and thys ſhall be cure peace, to haue quiet conſciences
with our God, whome we wyl abyde for, with al pacience,
vntill he worke our full deliuerance.

betrayed our ſelues vnto them. And further, becauſe
we were &amp; are content, not to be thought ſuche as willingly
would come in trouble, and yet we woulde not

leaue y• vnvttered, which it is our duties to vtter, and
which is many wayes cōmodious for y• whole eſtate
of this our country to be put in mynde of, hauyng reſpecte
alſo to the preſente Honorable aſſent of thys
high court of Parliamēt. Moreouer becauſe we could
not haue had any that wold haue printed our bookes
if they ſo lightly ſhould haue ben brought in danger,
our former reaſons alſo ſemīg to them to haue weight
to the contrary. Furthermore, becauſe without preuiledge
alſo to haue ſette too our handes, had not ben ſo
much material, and it was not poſsible for vs to haue
that, becauſe the biſhops haue y• matter in theyr hāds,
&amp; therfore haue hindred bookes which came nothing
neare to diſpleaſe them, lyke as theſe of oures: Although
our bookes ſhould not ſeeme to be againſt the
Queenes proceedings, For ſhee ſeemeth none otherwyſe,
but that ſhee wolde haue Gods matters to proceede.
And laſt of all, becauſe if we fynd it profytable
for y• church to vtter our ſelues, we are ready ſo to do.
For theſe ſeueral reſpects we ſay; haue we yet hetherto
forborne, &amp; we truſt that that which we haue ſayd
wil ſeeme reaſonable to you. But would to God theſe
matters wer reformed, and in the meane while, for as
much as if we might without peril (vntill we may be
diſproued) ſet forth that which we ſhoulde learne out
of the ſcriptures, ſubmitting oure ſelues to the iudgement
of the beſt churches, we thinke it were far better
that we were ſuffred. And it is hard dealing, that we
ſhoulde be abridged of ſuche lawfull libertie. For if
they ſhall obiecte any inconuenience againſte vs, it is
none other but ſuche, as mighte ſtoppe the lawfull
courſe of all good bookes: ſeeing there is none ledde
with better reaſon to ſette foorthe theyr bookes, than
we are, and ſeeing far better men are ſtopped of theyr
courſe by this inhibition. But we appeale to oure ſoueraigne,
and the whole ſtate, that we may not ſo vnequally
be dealt with, that they which are parties (we
meane our biſhoppes, and the reſt of that ſort) ſhould

only be hearde, &amp; be iudges in theyr owne cauſe too, &amp;
the 
                  〈◊〉
                of God ſtopped of the courſe in all others.
At theyr handes we haue litle hope to fynde ſo much
vprightneſſe: for it is to be doubted, they wilLu. 11. 52. kepe
backe the key of knowledge, as they haue done, neyther
entring in them ſelues, and yet (as to this daye
they do) forbidding them that doe come in. God of
his gracious goodneſſe, bleſſe them that take this his
cauſe into theyr handes,2. Cor. 10. 4. 5 and ſo directe them in the vſing
of his ſpirituall weapons, that they being mightie
thorowe hym, to caſte downe holdes, maye ouerthrowe
the imaginations, and euerye high thing
that is exalted againſte the knowledge of
God, and bring into bondage euerye
thoughte, to the obedience
of Chriſt, that he therby
may be glorifyed,
his church
comforted and continued vnto

THere be ſome men perhappes will
maruell, why we haue annexed the
priuate letters of theſe learned and
reuerende men to theſe Treatiſes,
ſeeing that it may ſeeme ſome iniurie
vnto them, for that their conſent
is not there vnto. And beſides, not
written ſo aduiſedlye, as the publyſhing
in Print woulde require, whereout things may
be drawne agaynſte bothe parties, being written for
ſtay of ſtrife betwene bothe. But we truſt that bothe
the one &amp; the other will beare with vs in this behalfe.
Firſte, bicauſe the godly Brethren haue beene often
preſſed with priuate letters, as not to be of the iudgement
of the beſt learned, and that therfore we are ſingular,
contentions, and ſo vnſtayed, that we ſeeke we
can not tel what. Againe, we haue for our example the
reuerende Byſhops, who to gette the better credite to
theyr cauſe, haue ſhewed vs a preſident of imprinting
ſome priuate letters, though we muſt needes ſay neyther
in ſo good a cauſe, nor with halfe ſo muche equitie.
And what thanke they had for ſo doing, as well
D. Bullingers letter written to a Noble man in thys
realme is witneſſe, as alſo this of Maiſter Gualters
which followeth. That whiche they did, was in defence
of corruptions, and no ſmall diſcredite to the
Authors, that which we do is in defence of the truth,
and to Gods glory, and no doubte to a ſingular commendacion
of the wryters. Albeit we muſt nedes ſay
th
                  ••
                the truthe of thys cauſe craueth no credit, neither
of theyr letters nor authoritie. For the ſcriptures are
manifeſt, and the woorkes of theſe godly and learned
men, I meane bothe of D. Bullingers, and M. Gualters,
teſtifie howe farre of, they are from maintaining
any of the forenamed filthy corruptions. We beſeeche
thee therefore gentle Reader to iudge the beſt of our
doings: howſoeuer it fall out, this ſhall be our cōfort
the teſtimonie of a good conſcience, wherin we mind
to reſt, and to ſuffer willingly what ſo euer ſhalbe laid

vpon vs. Theſe godly men I hope will not be offended
with vs, ſeeing we doe it for the truthes ſake, and
to purge them from ſuch a iudgement to defende corruptions
as the Biſhops by ſetting out theyr letters,
would ſeme to charge them. As for the former admonition,
if in the print they fynde many faults, let them
remember it was done ſpeedely, and as the extremitie
would ſuffer. For the matter, if any thing be iuſtly reproued,
it ſhall be amended, for the Treatiſe, if it be
thought too ſhort, it ſhall by Gods grace be enlarged.
We thoughte at the fyrſte onely to giue but a taſte of
theſe corruptions, to prouoke the patrons thereof to a
more full defence, which when it ſhall be ſet oute, we
minde more fully to ſhewe our meanings. In meane
time we beſeeche God to appeaſe theſe troubles, to
worke his peoples deliuerance from all Antichriſtian
ſlauerie, to preſerue our Queene in peace wholely to
ſeeke the Reformation of his Churche whiche ſhalbe
to his glory.

            To the reuerend Father in Chriſt. D. I. P.
the moſte vigilant B. of N. and
his louing Father.
            HEalth in Chriſt. When we heard at
the fyrſt (reuerend father in Chriſt)
that a controuerſie of the apparel of
Miniſters was riſen among you:
that matter did greatly aſtoniſh vs,
becauſe we feared, leaſte that thing
continuing and increaſing longer, ſhoulde bring ſome
greater miſchiefe: and therfore we laboured as muche
as lay in vs to pacifye ſome certaine men, leaſt aboute
a thing not of anye ſuche great waighte, they ſhoulde
trouble or diſquiet them ſelues. And ſurely this foretelling
of oure minde no whitte at all deceyued vs, if
thoſe things be true that we heare, to wit: that many
other things, beſides theſe garments are thruſt vpon
the Churches, and thoſe Miniſters caſt out from the

Churches, which will not ſubſcribe vnto the ordinances
of certaine men, whiche either abuſe the name of
the Queene, or elſe by theyr yeelding, make hir more
bolde in ſuche lyke matters, ſo that according to her
pleaſure, ſhee may ordaine what ſhee will. It increaſeth
alſo our greefe, for that we ſee our letter to be imprinted,
wherin we indeuorred to mitigate ſome one
or other man, and that the Godly brethren are preſſed
with the aucthoritie of our name, &amp; ſo we to come
into ſuſpition with many, as thoughe we allowed popiſhe
fylthineſſes or corruptions. In deede we counſelled
certain Miniſters, that they ſhould not forſake
theyr Churches for a cappe or a ſurpleſſe, but that ſo
farre forthe as they might. (Keping godlineſſe ſound
and vntouched) they ſhoulde feede the Lords flocke.
In meane tyme we neuer haue allowed eyther theyr
ſuperſtition or fooliſhe toyes, whiche thruſte vppon
godly Miniſters ſuche things, and out of the Popes
ſchoole, or rather kitchen, ſcrape ſuche fylthineſſes together,
throughe whiche they make much trouble and
buſyneſſe to good paſtoures, and gyue offence to the
weake. But eſpecially it ſeemeth harde vnto vs, that
the Biſhops ſhoulde ſhewe them ſelues to be the officers
of this execution, that by them, they whiche will
not yeelde, ſhould be caſt out. I woulde to God they
would way, what the Lorde woulde, when he ſpeaketh
of that ſame vntruſty ſteward of the houſe, who
whileſt he ought to haue fed his houſholde, banquetteth
and playeth with drunckardes, and beateth hys
fellowe ſeruauntes. For I ſee not howe farre they
differ from hys manners, who doe ſo eaſily allowe
the phantaſies of ſuperſtitious courtiers, and handle
godly Miniſters ſo vncurteouſly. Neither woulde
I euer haue thonghte that any could be found among
the Byſhoppes, which would haue ſhewed him ſelfe
an officer of this raſhneſſe, or at the leaſt haue confyrmed
the ſame throughe cowardly diſſymulation. For
me thoughte that all this matter had ſprong from certaine
men that abuſed the aucthoritie of the Queenes

moſte excellent Maieſtie, but we hoped that the Biſhoppes
woulde haue defended the cauſe of the Miniſters,
and haue ſoughte meanes, whereby this miſcheefe
mighte haue bene redreſſed.
            There are I graunt among the brethren, certaine
men a litle waywarde. But notwithſtanding, theyr
cauſe is not euill, muche leſſe wicked or vngodly, yea
rather it were to be wiſhed tbat theyr iudgemente
mighte preuaile, the whiche thing bicauſe then it ſeemed
impoſſyble vnto vs, we admoniſhed them to bēd
them ſelues to things preſent, and that they ſhoulde
truſte in the Lorde, who at length would giue ſome
occaſion, whereby all things ſhoulde be reſtored
to better. Nowe becauſe I heare (my Father) youre
godlineſſe to be eſpecially praiſed among the reſt, as
alſo the godlineſſe of oure father D. Pilkington (who
would not as yet tourne oute anye) you for oure olde
frendſhippes ſake ſeeme to be admoniſhed, that you
goe forwarde conſtantly in the ſame godlyneſſe. And
that you remember that euerye one o

is the husbande of hys owne churche, and a moſte

is done to his faythfull ſeruauntes to eſcape vnpuniſhed.
To this Chriſt one day ſhall an accounte of thys
our function and office be made, not to a Queene, nor
to the Pope, nor to them whiche challendge to themſelues
Papiſticall or Pontifycall authoritie in the
Churche. Take in good parte according to youre accuſtomed
gentleneſſe, theſe things written in deede
vpon the ſodaine without ſtudie, but not withoute a
care of brotherly loue. As concerning our matters, I
haue wrytten more in thoſe letters which you ſhal receiue
from the Marte. D. Bullinger ſaluteth you
moſte hartely. My Wife alſo hath her hartie commendacions
to you and to your wife.
            Fare you well

            To the reuerend father in Chriſt, E. G.
Biſhop of L. T. B. wiſheth grace
and health from the Lord.
            
               REuerende father, beſides that your letters
came very late to my handes, it is
come to paſſe for wante of meſſengers,
that I alſo haue beene faine to come a
day after the faire in anſwering. But I
yeelde you moſt heartie thanckes, both for your moſt
courteous letters, and alſo for your ſmall gift (as you
liſt to terme it) which notwithſtanding. I wil gladly
keepe, as a moſte excellent and acceptable pledge of
youres. And as for thoſe Annotations of mine: I wil
then take them to be ſuche as you reporte them to be,
when they ſhall haue throughly bene corrected by the
benefite of you, and other learned men. As concerning
our matt
                  •
               rs: all things are yet well and quiet among
vs, through the ſingular mercie and goodneſſe
of almightie God: whereas elſe this Churche mighte
well crie out, that ſaying of Dauids, They haue hated
me withoute cauſe. But it is well with vs that we be
ill ſpoken of, and falſly accuſed for Chriſtes names
ſake. In which behalfe it is an honoure to ſuffer any
thing. Some, (that is to wit the papiſts andVbiquitaries are they which maintaine ye Chriſte is euery wher by the bodely preſence of his manhoode. Vbibiquitaries)
not only ī lame vs, but alſo banne vs as
wicked folkes and heretickes: and other ſome (namely
ſuche as are aſhamed to haue theyr looſeneſſe reſtrained
by oure diſcipline ſuche as it is) finde faulte
with vs and abhorre vs as ouer ſ
                  •
               uere. But I hope
the day will come, that we ſhall iuſtifie oure caſe in
bothe the poynts of this accuſation, before the iudgement
ſeat of the ſonne of God. For as touching oure
doctrine, we are out of doubte: it agreeth with Gods
word: and I think it wil not be hard for vs to ſhew, y•
ye ſimplicitie of ye ceremonies of this church, (wherof
we repent vs not at all) and the whole order of oure
Diſcipline, are drawne out of the ſame fountaine, allbeit
that we willingly acknowledge our ſelues to be
farre off from that, which ought to haue bene eſtabliſhed

ere this. Moreouer, what heauing and craftie
dealing there hathe beene a late at Auguſta, agaynſte
all the Churches of theſe partes, and conſequently
alſo againſte youre Churches, and the Churches of
Fraunce, all which we thincke to agree with vs in all
poyntes of doctrine: I ſuppoſe it hathe bene reported
vnto you already. Which exceeding great miſcheefe
was ſuch, as though it ſhould not touch you at all, yet
ought it of right to moue you alſo, for the defacing of
ſo many and ſo great Churches. This therefore was
the cauſe, that the laſt winter, al the Churches of theſe
our quarters, (only Baſill excepted, bicauſe that they
a little afore, had by themſelues ſet forthe a lyke confeſsion
in all poyntes, in effecte of matter,) did giue
our conſent to the common confeſsion written by our
brethren of Zurike, which great conſent we hope wil
yeeld moſt plentifull frute of concord. Afterwarde all
the French Churches folowed this preſident, by putting
forth a record of their agreing with vs: now if it
may pleaſe the Lord to graunt thus muche more, that
your &amp; the Scottiſh churches might alſo teſtifie your
agreeing with this common confeſsion of oures, by
ſome publike wryting: no doubt but it would greatly
auaile to the hindering, or rather to the vtter ouerthrowing
of theyr deuices, which inforce our condemnation,
vppon truſt of multitude rather than of reaſons:
and alſo woulde ſtirre vp manye men to trie oute the
true religion, who are nowe borne in hande, that oure
Churches are at debate among themſelues with innumerable
diſcordes: that I may ſay nothing of manye
weake ones, whom (it is not to be doubted of) ſhould
be very muche ſtrengthened by the conſent of manye
nations. Conſidering therefore reuerende Father,
that this thing is very profytable for the Churche of
GOD, and righte agreeable to the charge of youre
ſelfe, and your reuerende fellowe offycers: I thincke
it a worthy matter for you, not only to take care of, but
alſo to preferre by all meanes to the Queenes Maieſtie:
which charge I hartely deſyre you, yea, and for

Chriſtes owne ſake beſeeche you, that you will not refuſe
to goe throughe wyth, for the Churche of God.
But for as muche as I am once entred into this matter,
I beſeeche you of your gentleneſſe Reuerend Father,
that you will gently and patiently ſuffer me to
proceede a little further in a matter not altogither vnlike
this, ſyth no ambition (as God helpe me) but only
good will towardes the Engliſhe churches, dothe
moue me thereunto. There is a report brought vnto
vs, and the ſame is confyrmed by certaine mennes letters
both out of Fraunce and out of Germany, that in
your countrie, many Miniſters of gods worde, (who
otherwiſe wer faultleſſe as well in life as in doctrine)
were put out of offyce by the Queenes maieſtie, euen
with the conſent of you Biſhops, bicauſe they re
                  •
               uſed
to ſubſcribe to ſome certaine Ceremonies. The ſumme
of which Iniunctions is reported to haue bene thys.
That they ſhould admit againe, not only the garmēts
which were the Prieſtes badges in poperie: but alſo
certaine ceremonies which haue bene growne oute of
kinde long agoe into moſte fylthie ſuperſtitions, as
croſsing and kneeling at the Communicating of the
Lordes ſupper, and other things of the ſame ſtampe.
It is reported moreouer (which is muche greuouſer,
that Women are permitted to miniſter Baptiſme,
that there is authorit
                  •
               e giuen to the Prince to bring in

                  〈◊〉
                Ceremonies vppon them. And fynally that all
power of ordering Eccleſiaſticall matters, is giuen to
the Biſhoppes only, wythoute giuing the Miniſters
of ſeuerall Churches, ſo muche as any leaue to complayne.
I wrote agayne to thoſe freendes of mine,
That the church of God did perſwade it ſelfe farre other
wiſe, bothe of the Queenes maieſtie, and alſo of
ſo many learned and religious biſhops: and moreouer
that at the leaſt many of theſe things were (to my ſeeming)
eyther vtterly deuiſed by ſome malicious perſons,
or at leaſt wiſe miſwreſted. Neuertheleſſe I beſeeche
you of your courteſye, that we maye haue ſome
conference of theſe matters betwixte oure ſelues. I

knowe there be two opinions concerning the Reformation
of Churches. For there be ſome of opinion,
that nothing at all ſhould be added to the ſimplicitie
of the Apoſtolike church, and therfore that (wythout
exception) all things are to be done by vs which the
Apoſtles did, and whatſoeuer the Church that ſucceded
next after the Apoſtles, hathe added to ye former
things, they thincke they muſt be abolyſhed at once.
Contrariwiſe, there be other ſome, which thinke that
certaine of the olde ceremonies ouermore, are partly
to be held ſtil as profytable and neceſſary: and partly
to be borne withall for concordes ſake, although they
be not neceſſary. As for my part, I am out of doubt,
that the Doctrine of the Apoſtles was moſt perfect
in all poyntes, and that it is not lawfull for any man
to take any thing from it, o
                  •
               to putte any thing to it.
But as for theyr Ceremonies, I iudge a little otherwiſe
of them. For fyrſt of all, it is certaine that at the
fyrſt ſpringing vp of churches: not euē the Apoſtles
themſelues were able to ſtabliſhe whatſoeuer they
thought expedient, and therfore that they proceeded
ſteppe by ſteppe, according as theyr ordaining of
Deacons ſheweth: in ſo muche as they did ſuffer for
a time euen many Iewiſhe things, like as it appeareth
in theyr Stories. Againe, who doub
                  •
               eth but
that the Apoſtles hadde a ſingular regarde of theyr
owne times, and alſo of the places and perſones, in
outwarde ceremonies? in ſo much as it is no likelyhoode,
that the ſame ceremonies were in all poyntes
obſerued in all places, according as it appeareth wel
inough bi the notable Epiſtle of Irene vnto Victor.
Beſydes thys, euen very neceſsitie hathe abolyſhed
ſome traditions of theirs, as thoſe cōmon refections.
Wherfore I am of opiniō, that all that hath ben don
by the Apoſtles in caſe of ceremonies, is not by and
by, nor without exception to be followed for a rule.
Neyther do I maruell that thoſe olde Fathers, vpon
conſyderation had to theyr owne tymes, haue abated
ſome of thoſe fyrſt things, or put ſomewhat to them.
            
               
And to conclude chaunged ſome. But euen they
them ſelues that I may ſpeake with theyr leaue plainly
what I thinke, had not as me ſeemeth ſo good conſideration
of Chriſtian ſymplicitie, and pureneſſe as
was meete. For fyrſte they oughte to haue conſidered,
that the aboliſhing of the Ceremonies of Moſes
by little and little, was not to ſette them vppe againe
in time by another pretence: and alſo that the
Heatheniſh ceremonies were to be plucked vp by the
rotes, ſo as there might not any print of heathniſhnes
remain to be ſene, were it neuer ſo ſmal, according as
Moſes aduiſedly charged the Iſraelites at theyr entring
into the land of Chanaan. And therfore I think
them to haue ſinned ſore, how be it not vppon malice
which haue folowed both the law of Moſes and alſo
the manner of the heathen, for a rule in ordaining the
ceremonies of the churche: which thing howe buſily
they haue done, I ſuppoſe there is no man ignorant.
Againe, they ought to haue conſidered this alſo, that
the aboliſhing of the ceremonies of the law, was not
to bring in another bōdage of ſeruice vpon it (for that
had not ben a taking away of the yoke of the law, but
an exchange of it) but rather to the ende that all men
ſhould behold Chryſt exhibited, from henceforth vnclothed,
and walking in the cleere lyght, and nomore
darkened with any figures or ſhadowes. For (according
as Auſtin complaining very greeuouſly of the
ſame matter, hathe rightly deemed) this ſame is the
cauſe why oure Lord ordained both fewer (that is to
witte but two, in ſtede of all the other former whiche
were innumerable) and alſo ſimpler and euidenter
ſacraments of the new teſtament. And therfore I ſay
againe, that they ſinned righte greeuouſly, as ofte as
they brought any Sacramentalles, (that is to ſay any
ceremonies to import ſignificatiō of ſpiritual things)
into the church of God. Therfore, at one word for all
I am of opinion, that whatſoeuer hath ben conuerted
into the rites and cuſtomes of the chryſtians, eyther
from the Iewes or from the Painims, without Ch
                  •
               iſtes

ordinance, and the aſſured example of the Apoſtles:
and likewiſe, that all Sacramentall ceremonies
ought to be thruſt out of the church at once, whervnto
they could neuer be brought by any right: and that the
church cannot be reſtored to hir natiue beautie, ſo lōg
as they continue in it. Now remaine only ſuche ceremonies
as pertaine only vnto comelineſſe: In whiche
caſe I 
                  〈◊〉
                compelled eftſo
                  •
               e to finde lacke of diſcretion
in many, euen of the auncienteſt biſhops. For fyrſt
of all, as concerning the miniſtration of the ſacramēts
wheras all 
                  ••
               at euer is done there, hath couert importance,
and it is no more lawfull for men to ordaine ſacraments,
than to deuiſe new promiſſes of ſaluation:
and wheras Chriſt the author both of the worde and
of the ſacraments, wo
                  •
               ld of ſet purpoſe that the ceremonies
of them ſhould be very ſimple &amp; very few, inſomuch
that he preſcribed a rule certaine of theſe holy
doings, vnto his true ſhepherdes in theſe woordes:
Doe ye this: I cannot wonder inoughe what reaſon
ſhould moue diuers men to be of opinion, that all the
whole furniture, wherwith euen y• ancienteſt fathers
of all thought themſelues to garniſh Baptim and the
Lordes ſupper, ſhould be helde ſtill with toothe and
naile: and ſome alſo ſhould thinke, that it ought to be
ſet vp againe in places where it is taken away as it
ought to be. If antiquitie be required: Chriſt is he
that gaue vs the Prophets and Apoſtles: and again,
by the Apoſtles, ſhepherds and teachers. If authori
               
                  •
               e
required: Chryſte is the foundation, the Apoſtles
are the maiſter builders, and the ſhepherdes and teachers
are bound to build golde and ſiluer vppon that
foundation. Therefore lette the golde and ſiluer abide
ſtill: and as for the hay and chaffe, ſeing that the day
of the Lorde hathe diſcouered them, why I pray you
do we build them vp againe? Nay verily, why ſtriue
we ſo much for chaffe and ſtubble, or rather euen for
more trifling things than chaffe and ſtubble be: and
if not vtterly, yet at y• leaſt wiſe for y• moſte part, why
neglecte we y• ſubſtantiall and pretious building in

deede? But this complaint perchaunce agreed better
to the times wherein the fyrſt ſucceſſors of the Apoſtles
liued, than to this doting olde age of the preſent
world. For I eſteeme the ſinnes of thoſe fathers as
vertues in compariſon of theyr vnlearned, heedeleſſe,
and ambitious ſucceſſors. For by what other termes
ſhould I call them, who beſides that they haue made
as great adoe aboute ceremonies only, as aboute the
whole ſumme of Religion, wheruppon hathe inſued
that horrible diſfyguring of all the parts of doctrine)
ſeme to haue had the ouer ruling of Goddes houſe to
none other intent, but to ouerthrowe it quite, being
already decayed. They that could not away wyth the
plaine faſhions of the Apoſtles, haue added a thouſand
ceremonies to the baptim of the new inſtructed.
It lyked ſome to haue them anoynted, as though they
ſhould haue gone to wreſtling: ſome to haue them
plucked out of Sathans power by certain coniurings
and breathings, as folk paſsing out of the diuels dominion
into the kingdome of God. Some to haue
waxe candles giuen them lighted, as to fol
                  •
                conueyed
out of darkneſſe into light: ſome to be clad in whyte
rayment, as f
                  •
               l
                  •
               e that had put of the old man and put
on the newe: and other ſome to haue milke and honey
giuen them to taſte aforehand, as folke comming by
a newe kinde of life. All which things if I liſted to
go through with, what ende ſhould there be of theyr
maſking toyes, rather then chriſten ceremonies? But
(ſay they) ſo it behoued the heathen to be allured vnto
Chriſt. As who would ſay, that Chriſt and the Apoſtles
after Chriſte, coulde not haue prouided theſe
things. For ſurely, as for thoſe that make the apoſtles
authors of theſe toyes, they are not once worthe the
diſprouing, howe aunciente ſo euer they bee. I
pray you what a thing is this, that whereas it is the
propertie of chriſtian religion to do nothing in huddermudder
(for it is a trick of Sathans to ſhunne the
light): yet notwithſtāding, many of thoſe auncienteſt
thought it good to hide the holy miſteries of the chriſtians,

as if they had bene the miſteries of Ceres, inſo
muche as they admitted not the newly inſtructed
to the ſyght of them: yea, &amp; as for that whole action,
wherin looke whatſoeuer thing was fygured vnder a
fewe plaine tokens, the Lorde himſelfe bothe willed
and commaūded the ſame to be openly preached and
publiſhed by his word, alowed and expoūded in ſuch
a tongue as all men vnderſtode, according as he himſelf
was wont to do: they tranſformed it into certaine
ſecrete conceites, and into certain ceremonies ſcarcely
vnderſtode of many of the prieſtes themſelues. But
farre greater was the negligence of the biſhops that
ſucceeded: who conueyed that thing to the Chryſten
mennes infants, which was ordained for theyr ſakes
that paſſed out of Painimrie into Chriſtianitie, after
traynement in the fyrſt principles of Religion, being
already men growne. If any man do
                  •
               te whether this
be ſo or no: I pray you let him conſyder the maner of
baptim according as the papiſts kepe it, and yet ſtill
by tradition from furtheſt antiquity, ſauing that they
haue added a few things of theyr owne, and held ſtil
the ſtraunge language, whiche at that time was common
in the Weſt and the South. For there they that
are to be baptized, are bidden not onely to render a
reaſon of theyr faythe: but alſo come to be baptized.
Which thing althoughe manie; (among whome Auſtin
himſelfe is one) haue gone aboute to excuſe by
ſome qualifycation: ſaying that the Godfathers and
Godmothers are demaunded, and doe make anſwer
in the childrens names: yet notwithſtanding, who ſeeth
not, that this is but a weake deuice, to cloke the
thing by ſome coloure, which was crept in by abuſe?
for I beſeeche you, if baptim may not be miniſtred,
without preſent vnder taking for the faith of the partie
that is to be baptized: for except that be graunted;
wherfore I pray you is the childe that comes to chriſtening,
demaunded of his faythe:) to what purpoſe
is baptim haſtened? and why rather do we not delay
baptim, vntill ſuch time as thoſe that are to be baptized,

maye be able to profeſſe theyr owne faythe, as the
Catabaptiſtes do, which God forbid. And I am oute
of doubte, that thys negligence of the Biſhops, whome
it behooued of neceſſytie to haue putte a difference betweene
the chriſtenyng of babes, and the chryſtening
of men growne, as in reſpecte of ſome outwarde ceremonies)
hathe cauſed many to delaye the chriſtening of
theyr children the longer, howe be it that they dyd not
well in ſo doing: Notwithſtanding, that the ſayde error
was not eſpied in olde time, (no not euen of inanye
Byſhops) euen thys one thing declareth, That Nazyanzene
being a Biſhoppes ſonne, was aboue twentie
yeres old ere he was chriſtened. Muche leſſe had thys
opinion taken roote, of the neceſsitie of Chryſtening
vnto ſaluation, whiche opinion the Byſhoppes of Africke
broughte in afterwarde in reſyſting Pelagius.
And the cauſe whye I make mention of theſe matters,
is for that (among other things) it is ſayde that in
youre Countrye the little Babe that is to be Chriſtened,
is demaunded of his faythe by the Miniſter.
And I woulde gladlye learne of you reuerende Father,
vppon what probable reaſon, or vppon what reſon
that pertaineth to the edifying of Goddes Church,
the ſame cuſtome is grounded. As for the ſigning
                  •
                of
folke with the croſſe, althoughe it be very auncient: yet
ſurely I ſee not what profyte it can bryng: and all be it
the ſame is wonderfully, and altogither ouer reachingly
commended (ſpeciallye by Chryſoſtome,) as a certaine
ſumme of the chriſten Religion: yet notwithſtanding
in as muche as it is not grounded vppon the authoritie
of Gods woorde, or vppon any example of the
Apoſtles, (for I make no reckening of vnauthoriſed
ſtuffe) that is to ſay, foraſmuche as it is vtterly deſtitute
of Gods woorde, and pertaineth not in anye wiſe
vnto comlyneſſe, but (to be ſhorte) hathe bene the fyrſte
opener of the gappe vnto that mooſte abhominable ſuperſtition
and worſhipping of the croſſe, the horribleſt
of all Idolatries: I can leſſe fynde in my hearte that it
ſhoulde be nombred among thoſe things indifferent,

than the braſen ſerpent of Ezechias, whoſe example it
would become all chriſtian Princes to folow, chefely
in this caſe, that is to ſay in ouerthrowing the Idols
of croſſes and crucifixes. But whereas childrenne
that are to be chriſtened, are offered in the open congregation
of the church, rather in honeſt than in coſtly
apparell: where as there is vſed a certaine conuenient
forme of prayer, and expoſition of baptim: wheras
the godfathers and godmothers are preſent to take
charge of the holy bringing vp of the child: and finally
wheras the children be ſprinkled with cleare water
taken reuerently in cleane handes according to the
forme appointed by Chriſte: conſidering that theſe
rites be ſimple, honeſt, and in no wiſe magicall, and
finally ſuche as can not giue any occaſion of ſuperſtition:
who is he that dares condemne them, except he
wil be reproued by the expreſſe words of Paule, who
giueth commaundement, that in the Lords houſe all
things ſhould be done fitly and orderly? Furthermore
as touching the Lords ſupper, who can refraine teares,
to declare howe miſerably it is transformed into
that olde ſtagelike frisking &amp; horrible Idol gadding?
That the vndiſcrete zele of ſuche as were not contented
with the ſimpleneſſe of Chriſt and his Apoſtles,
opened the fyrſte gap to this corruption, I thincke it
needeth not many wordes to proue it, for as much as
bothe the olde and the newe ſeruices, as well of the
Eaſt as of the Weſt, which are ſo muche the vncleaner,
as they be done with more ſolemnitie, doe moſte
manifeſtly proue the matter to be ſo. And heere I
dout not, but you haue well marked how wily ſathan
hath ſhewed himſelfe. For who would not thinke,
that the vſing of an altar, or of ſome table were an indifferent
thing? Therfore by little and little, Altares
were brought in in ſtead of tables: verely bicauſe the
common tables, (which neuertheleſſe the auncient
fathers vſed euen for theyr bankets) ſeemed not to agree
well with ſo ſtately ſeruice. Heerevppon ſathan
tooke fyrſte occaſion to transforme this holy action,

(which was ordained, not to giue, but to receiue
Chriſte) into a propitiatorie ſacrifice, that is to ſay,
moſte ſhamefully to treade vnder foote the deathe of
Chriſt, which is there declared. They were not content
with common and plaine ſongs, and therfore vnder
pretence of beutifying this holy action, that buſie
and curious prickeſong &amp; deſcanting was brought in,
more mete for ſtage playes, for the moſt part, then for
an holy action, and more fyt to delite the eare, then to
ſtirre vp the minde. A thing ſurely for this reſpect not
only vnprofitable, but alſo very hurtfull, that in that
noiſe, no man coulde well marke what was ſayde: ſo
that the matter it ſelfe dothe plainly conuince, that the
true worſhip of God was by this meanes eſpecially
transformed into vaine, and at the length mere ſtagelike
ſongs. A ſimple and common furniture pleaſed
them not, nor was agreeable, therfore they ſought out
marble, they guilded walles, they prouided veſſelles
of golde and ſiluer, and theyr miniſters beganne to be
attired in pretious and Biſhoppelike, yea, and Emperourelike
garments, and all forſothe to honoure the
ſacramente with all. And ſo forthwith theſe were the
meanes and inſtrumentes to foſter and cheriſhe riotouſneſſe,
to neglecte true charitie, and to be ſhorte, to
bring in foliſh and ſtagelike furniture. They were not
content with a ſimple breaking of the breade, whiche
notwithſtanding is not the leaſt parte of this action,
therfore little round cakes began to be giuen to each,
and the order apointed of the Lord, was abrogated.
It pleaſed them not to giue the breade into theyr
hands while they were ſytting or ſtanding, as in olde
times it was, but it ſeemed them good to haue it holden
vp, as it were, to worſhip it, and afterwarde was
kneeling vſed, and choſe rather to haue a morſell put
in to theyr mouthe, for more reuerence ſake forſothe.
And that this was the fyrſt beginning of that moſte
horrible bread worſhip, whiche can not yet be aboly
               
                  ••
               ed,
who ſeeth not? Nowe then ſeeing theſe things

are ſo, and the moſte dolefull and ſorowfull euente of
theſe honors vnſeaſonably and prepoſterouſlye giuen
to oure holy things dothe more then ſuffyciently teache
vs, how far better it were for vs to content oure ſelues
with the ſymple inſtitution of Chriſte, then with an
vntowardly zeale to faſhion or deuiſe anye of theſe
things: he doth beſt of all in my minde, which abolyſheth
theſe things, (althoughe not wicked of themſelues,
yet as not neceſſary, and very little profytable,
although they be well vſed, but very much hurtfull, as
the moſt heauie ſtate of churches ſheweth and ſetteth
forth,) with no leſſe earneſtneſſe, then moſte euidente
Idolatrie. For I pray you, if there were a ſtone ſet for
ſome purpoſe in the parting of two wayes, whereat
ntowithſtanding, all men, vnleſſe they were very circumſpecte,
mighte fall with daunger of their liues,
whether were it better to take that ſtone at once out of
the way, or to let it alone, and daily to warne the paſſengers
on which hande they were beſt to goe, if they
would not ſ
                  ••
               mble? For if theyr directours ſhould be
either ſlouthfull, or not circumſpect inoughe, in vayne
might they admoniſh a great number. Notwithſtanding
we thinke that rites which are neceſſary for order
and comelyneſſe, are to be retained, as, that vppon
certaine dayes, and at certaine houres, the ſacramentall
ſygnes, being taken oute of cleane veſſels, be reuerently
giuen and receyued, and what ſo euer is of like
ſorte, pertaining rather to an honeſt, than an ambicious
manner. Nowe if a man aſke me, whether I
thinke that nothing at all of theſe things, which are of
themſelues indifferent, may be retained, at leaſt for
the weakes ſake, and whether the miniſtery oughte to
be forſaken, rather then any ſuche thing ſhoulde be obſerued,
eſpecially if this caution be namely added, that
theſe things are eyther broughte in, or as yet tolerate
not properly to binde mennes conſciences, but for other
good conſyderations. I anſwere, that I thinke
not, that congregations may be forſaken for garments
and cappes, or ſome ſuche like mere indifferent and

mene thing. But fyrſt of all, I think that there are manny
things, which of themſelues being indifferent, yet
for an opinion of worſhippe annexed vnto them, can
ſkarſly or not at all be eſchued, ought to be counted amongſt
ſuperſtitions, or ſurely amongſte very needy
occaſyons of ſuperſtition. Moreouer this is to be obſerued,
that many things may be tolerated for the weake,
which notwithſtanding oughte not to be renued,
after they are once taken away. For that this were not
to take away an infyrmitie: but rather, in ſome reſpect,
to reſtore it when it is taken awaye, and not to call it
backe, after it is departed, ſo that I maruell not, that
many men in this caſe ſhewe them ſelues harder in the
reſtoring of certaine things, then perhaps they would
haue bene at the beginning, when they were in hand,
to take them away. Moreouer and beſides. I ad this
that to my thinking, weakenes is falſly pretended in
that kingdome, wherin ſo many yeres already, the goſpell
hath bene preached and receiued, yea and confirmed
wyth the bloud of ſo many excellent martyres. If
ſo be that the Apoſtle did rightly chide the Galathians,
for that when they had begon in the ſpirite, they
went backe againe to the fleſhe, how muche more may
it be lawfull to ſay the ſame of you Engliſhe men, if
peraduenture after that ye haue began in the ſpirite,
you fall backe againe (as God forbid) not as they did
to the fleſhe, that is to ſay, to Moiſes his ceremonies,
whereof God was the author, but to the trifles and
traſhe of mennes traditions. Laſt of all, I will not be
afraide to ſay this, truſting to your equitie, if they doe
amiſſe which had rather depart from theyr congregations,
then to ſuffer thoſe things to be thruſte vppon
them againſte theyr conſcience, that they are in greate
fault before God and his Angels, which had rather a
bide to haue flockes depriued of paſtors, and foundations
laide of moſte horrible confuſion by the paſtors
forſaking of theyr congregations, then to ſee miniſters
otherwiſe without fault, to vſe rather thys then that
apparell: and that in ſome places there ſhoulde rather

be no ſupper giuen to the hungrie ſheepe, then that
kneling ſhould be omitted. Which things, if they ſhuld
be there done amongſte you, (as God forbidde that I
ſhould thinke that they are done) ſurely they would be
beginnings, not of former, but of far greter calamities.
Againe I beſeeche you, reuerende father, that if I offend
heerein, you would paciently bear with me ſo offending
not of ambition or malice, but (as the Lorde
knoweth,) of rudenes and vnſkilfulnes. If it be true
that is commonly reported, and I am not yet perſuaded,
that baptiſme is priuately permitted to women amongſt
you, I can not tel what is to go backe from the
gole to the barriers, if this be not. For firſt of all from
whence ſprang this moſt filthy error, but from a groſe
ignorance of the matter of the ſacrament. Who ſo euer
is not waſhed in water, is condemned ſay they which
are the patrones of this prophanation of baptiſme. If
it be ſo, the ſaluation of infants ſhall come, not from
the couenaunt of god, (which notwithſtanding is the
endoubted ground of our ſaluation) but from the ſeale
annexed vnto the conenaunte (and that not to make it
more certaine in it ſelfe, but rather to certify vs of it.
And that more wicked is, the ſaluation of infants ſhal
wholely conſiſt in the diligence or negligence of y• parents.
But ſeeing, y• excellent ſeruaunt of God D. Peter
Martyr, as you right well knowe, reuerend father,
a good while a goe diſputed of this matter at large in
his commentaries wrytten to that godly king Edwarde,
and that, as I thinke, with the conſent of the
whole Engliſhe churche in thoſe dayes, I woulde not
now at large diſcourſe vppon this matter. This only
I ſay, if that reporte ſhoulde be true, it were greatly to
be lamented to ſee them now to tourne back as it were
to the barryers, which ſhoulde haue rather bene come
euen to the gole, eſpecially hauing had ſuche guides
and maſters. But if thoſe things ſhall be true, whiche
ſeeme not to me probable, that Metropolitanes practiſe
and put in vre thoſe moſt filthy abuſes which are
more intollerable then ought elſe in the church of Antichriſt,

as pluralities of benefices, licences of not reſydences,
to contracte Matrimonie, and for eating of
fleſhe, and ſuche like, as it were ſurely not a corruption
of chriſtianitie, which I ſpeake with horror, but a
manifeſt falling away from Chriſt, and therfore they
were not to be condemned, but rather to be praiſed:
which would oppoſe them ſelues againſt ſuche endeuors.
Moreouer by what right, whether ye reſpect the
word of God, or all the olde Canons, may either the
ciuil Magiſtrate by himſelf, where congregations are
already erected and eſtabliſhed, bring in vppon them
any new rites, or abrogate the olde: or the Biſhoppes
wythoute the iudgement and conſent of theyr Elderſhip,
of duetie ordaine any thing, I haue not yet learned.
But bicauſe I ſee that theſe two plagues, that is
to ſay, the diſhoneſt and ambitious flattery of former
Biſhops, partly abuſing the vertuous Princes, and
partly ſeruing theyr euil affections and vices haue vtterly
vndone the Church, vntil the matter came to this
paſſe, that the mightyeſt of the Metropolitanes of the
Weſt, by the iuſte iudgemente of God, ſo puniſhing
Magiſtrates and Biſhops, had ſcratched and rauiſhed
vnto himſelfe all matters bothe diuine and humane.
I muſt needes confeſſe that I am aſtoniſhed &amp;
amaſed, ſo often as I think of theſe things, and I forſee,
that eyther the ſame, or more greeuous puniſhmēts
do agayne hang ouer the moſt part of people, which at
the firſt, with great affection, embraced the goſpel, and
now by little and little fall from it. And I dout not but
the good in what place ſo euer, doe in like ſort lament,
whome the Lord heare, and for his ſonne Ieſus Chriſtes
ſake giue vnto Kings &amp; Princes a true, godly, and
religious mind, and graunt them good and ſtout counſellors,
&amp; to the gouernors of his church, eſpecially his
holy ſpirite, &amp; moſt aboundant knowledge and zeale, &amp;
moreouer increaſe and preſerue the people which haue
already profeſſed the true fayth in ſinceritie of doctrine
and rites, and godly manners.
            You ſee (reuerende father) howe farre this heate,

as it were hathe enforced me▪ But I beſeeche you, for▪
and accordinge to youre good nature, to take this my
doinge in good parte, and conſider that it is the token
of good loue, that ſuche as loue one another, are full of
care and penſiuenes for theyr frendes, euen then, when
they ſeme to be in beſt caſe. But nowe of theſe matters
too muche. It remayneth that I commend in moſt inſtant
wiſe vnto your worthye and fatherlie goodneſſe
the Frenche Churche, whiche next vnto God, and hir
maieſtie, is moſte bounde vnto yow, that if ſo be the
ennemies of the Goſpell, being to paſſe, that in all places,
and by all meanes poſſible, they do maliciouſly go
aboute, the poore banyſhed maye yet at the leaſte haue
ſome refuge &amp; ſuccoure amongeſt yow. I had thought
to haue wrytten letters to the ſame purpoſe, (ſo bolde

peraduenture to hir owne maieſtie, but I with helde

yow ſhall perceaue that this my little labor may profite,
I wil not be afrayd, God willyng, not only to venture
