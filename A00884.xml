            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

                  SIt iſta queſtio. This is the queſtyon, Whervnto is euerye manne ordeyned. And as Iob ſaythe, Homo naſcitur ad laborem, ſicut auis ad volandum: That is to ſaye, a man is ordeyned and borne to do labour, as a bird is ordeyned to flye. And the apoſtle ſaythe, Qui non laborat, non manducet: Debet enim in obſequio dei laborare, qui de bonis eius vult manducare. That is to ſaye, he that laboureth not, ſhulde not eate, and he ought to labour and doo goddes warke, that wyll eate of his goodes or gyftes, The whiche is an harde texte after the lyterall ſence. For by the letter, the kynge, the quene, nor all other lordes ſpirituall and temporal ſhuld not eate, without they ſhuld labour, the whiche were vncomely, and not conuenyente for ſuche eſtates to labour, But who that redeth in the boke of the moralytes of the cheſſe, ſhal therby perceyue, that euerye man, from the hyeſt degree to the loweſt, is ſet and ordeyned to haue labour and occupation, and that boke is deuyded in .vi. degrees, that is to ſaye, the kynge, the quene, the byſhops, the knightes, the iudges, and the yomenne. In the whiche

boke is ſhewed theyr degrees, theyr auctorytyes, theyr warkes, and theyr occupations, and what they ought to do. And they ſo doynge and executynge theyr auctorytyes, warkes, and occupatyons, haue a wonders great ſtudy and labour, of the whiche auctorytyes, occupations, and warkes, were at this tyme to longe to wryte. Wherfore I remytte that boke as myn auctour therof: The whiche boke were neceſſary to be knowen of euery degree, that they myghte doo and ordre them ſelfe accordynge to the ſame. And in ſo moche the yomen in the ſayde moralytyes and game of the cheſſe be ſet before to labour, defende, and maynteyne all the other hyer eſtates, the whiche yomen repreſent the common people, as huſbandes and labourers, therfore I purpoſe to ſpeake fyrſte of huſbandrye.

            HVSBANDRY.
            
               ¶ Here begynneth the boke of huſbandry, and fyrſte where by huſbande men do lyue.
               
                  THe mooſte generall lyuynge that huſbandes can haue, is by plowynge and ſowyng of theyr cornes, and rerynge or bredynge of theyr cattel, and not the one withoute the other. Than is the ploughe the moſte neceſſaryeſt inſtrumente that an huſbande can occupy, wherfore it is conuenyent to be knowen, howe a plough ſhulde be made.
            
            
               ¶ Dyuers maners of plowes.
               THere be plowes of dyuers makynges in dyuers countreys, and in lyke wyſe there be plowes of yren of dyuers facyons. And that is bycauſe there be many maner of groundes and ſoyles. Some whyte cley, ſome redde cley, ſome grauell or chylturne, ſome ſande, ſome meane erthe, ſome medled with marle, and in many places heeth grounde, and one ploughe wyll not ſerue in all places. wherfore it is neceſſarye, to haue dyuers maners of plowes. In Sommerſetſhyre,

about Zelceſter, the ſharbeame, that in many places is called the ploughe hedde, is foure or fyue foote longe, and it is brode and thynne. And that is bycauſe the lande is very toughe, and wolde ſoke the ploughe into the erthe, yf the ſharbeame were not long, brode, and thynne. In Kente they haue other maner of plowes, ſomme goo with wheles, as they doo in many other places, and ſome wyll tourne the ſheldbredth at euery landes ende, and plowe all one waye. In Buckyngham ſhyre, are plowes made of an nother maner, and alſo other maner of ploughe yrons, the whyche me ſemeth generally good, and lykely to ſerue in many places, and ſpecially if the ploughbeame and ſharbeame be foure ynches longer, betwene the ſhethe, and the ploughe tayle, that the ſheldbrede myght come more a ſlope: for thoſe plowes gyue out to ſodeinly, and therfore they be the worſe, to drawe, and for noo cauſe elles. In Leyceſterſhyre, Lankeſſhyre, Yorkeſhyre, Lyncoln̄, Norfolke, Cambrydge ſhyre, and manye other countreyes, the plowes be of dyuers makinges, the whyche were to longe proceſſe to declare howe. &amp;c. But how ſo euer they be made yf they be well tempered, and goo well, they maye be the better ſuffred.
            
            
               
               ¶ To knowe the names of all the partes of the plowe.
               MEn that be no huſbandes, maye fortune to rede this boke, that knowe not whiche is the ploughe beame, the ſharebeame, the ploughe ſhethe, the ploughe tayle, the ſtilte, the reſt, the ſheldbrede, the fen brede, the roughe ſtaues, the ploughe fote, the plough eare or coke, the ſhare the culture, and ploughe mal. Perauenture I gyue them theſe names here, as is vſed in my countre, and yet in other countreyes they haue other names: wherfore ye ſhall knowe, that the ploughe beame, is the longe tree aboue, the whiche is a lytel bente. The ſharbeame is the tre vnder neth, where vpon the ſhare is ſet, the ploughe ſheth is a thyn pece of drye woode, made of oke, that is ſet faſt in a morteys in the plough beame, and alſo in to the ſharebeame, the whiche is the keye and the chiefe bande of all the plough. The plough tayle is that the huſbande holdeth in his hande, and the hynder ende of the ploughebeame is put in a longe ſlyt, made in the ſame tayle, and not ſet faſte, but it maye ryſe vp and go dowe, and is pynned behynde, and the ſame ploughe tayle is ſet faſte in a morteys, in the hynder ende of

the ſharebeame. The plough ſtylte is on the ryghte ſyde of the ploughe, whervpon the reſt is ſet, the reſt is a lyttell pece of woode, pynned faſt vpon the nether ende of the ſtylt, and to the ſharebeame in the ferther ende. The ſheldbrede is a brode pece of wodde, faſt pinned to the ryghte ſide of the ſhethe in the ferther ende, and to the vtter ſyde of the ſtylte in the hynder ende. The fenbreds is a thyn borde, pynned or nayled moſte commonly to the lyft ſyde of the ſhethe in the ferther ende, and to the ploughe tayle in the hynder ende. And the ſayde ſheldbrede wolde come ouer the ſayde ſhethe and fenbrede an inche, and to come paſt the myddes of the ſhare, made with a ſharpe edge, to receyue and turne the erthe whan the culture hath cut it. There be two roughe ſtaues in euery ploughe in the hynder ende, ſet a ſlope betwene the ploughe tayle and the ſtilt, to holde out and kepe the plough abrode in the hynder ende, and the one lenger than the other. The plough fote is a lyttell pece of wodde, with a croked ende ſet before in a morteys in the ploughe beame, ſette faſt with wedges, to dryue vppe and downe, and it is a ſtaye to order, of what depenes the ploughe ſhall go. The ploughe eare is made of thre peces of yren, nayled faſte vnto the

ryght ſyde of the plough beame. And poore men haue a croked pece of wode pynned faſte to the ploughbeame. The ſhare is a pece of yren, ſharpe before and brode behynde, a fote longe, made with a ſocket to be ſet on the ferther ende of the ſhare beame. The culture is a bende pece of yren ſette in a morteys in the myddes of the plough beame, faſtened with wedges on euery ſyde, and the backe therof is halfe an inche thycke and more, and three inches brode, and made kene before to cutte the erthe clene, and it muſt be wel ſteeled, and that ſhall cauſe the eaſyer draughte, and the yrens to laſte moche lenger. The blough mal is a pece of harde woode, with a pynne put throughe, ſet in the plough beame, in an augurs bore.
            
            
               ¶ The temprynge of plowes.
               NOwe the plowes be made of dyuers maners, it is neceſſarye for an houſbande, to knowe howe theſe plowes ſhulde be tempered, to plowe and turne clene, and to make no reſte balkes. A reſte balke is where the plough byteth at the poynte of the culture and ſhare, and cutteth not the ground cleane to the forowe, that was plowed laſte

before, but leaueth a lyttell rydge ſtandynge betwene, the whiche dothe brede thiſtyls, and other wedes. All theſe maner of plowes ſhulde haue all lyke one maner of temperyng in the yrens. Howe be it a man maye temper for one thynge in two or thre places, as for depnes. The fote is one: the ſetting of the culture of a depnes, is a nother: and the thyrde is at the ploughe tayle, where be two wedges, that be called ſlote wedges: the one is in the ſlote aboue the beame, the other in the ſaide ſlote, vnder the plough beame, and other whyle he wyll ſet bothe aboue, or bothe vndernethe. but alway let hym take good hede, and kepe one generall rule, that the hynder ende of the ſharebeme alway touche the erth, that it may kyll a worde, or elles it goth not truly. The temperynge to go brode and narowe is in the ſettyng of the culture: and with the dryuinge of his ſyde wedges, forewedge and helewedge, whiche wolde be made of drye woode. and alſo the ſettynge on of his ſhare helpeth well, and is a connynge poynte of huſbandry, and mendeth and payreth moch plowyng: but it is ſo narowe a point to know, that it is harde to make a man to vnderſtande it by wrytynge, without he were at the operation therof, to teache the practyue. for it

muſte leane moche in to the forowe, and the poynt may not ſtande to moch vp nor downe, nor to moche in to the lande, nor into the forowe. Howe be it, the ſettynge of the culture helpeth moche. Somme plowes haue a bende of yron tryanglewiſe, ſette there as the plough eare ſhulde be, that hath thre nyckes on the farther ſyde. And yf he wyll haue his plough to go a narowe forowe, as a ſede forowe ſhulde be, than he ſetteth his fote teame in the nycke nexte to the ploughe beame. and yf he wyll go a meane bredth, he ſetteth it in the myddell nycke, that is beſt for ſturrynge. and if he wolde go a brode forowe, he ſetteth it in the vttermoſte nycke, that is beſte for falowynge: The whyche is a good waye, to kepe the bredthe, and ſoone tempered, but it ſerueth not the depeneſſe. And ſome men haue in ſtede of the plough fote, a piece of yron ſet vpryghte in the farther ende of the ploughe beame, and they calle it a coke, made with. ii. or thre nyckes, and that ſerueth for depenes. The plowes that goo with wheles, haue a ſtreyghte beame, and maye be tempred in the yron, as the other be, for the bredth, but their moſt ſpeciall temper is at the bolſter, where as the plough beame lyeth, and that ſerueth both for depnes and for bredth. And they be

good on euen grounde that lyeth lyghte, but me ſemeth, they be farre more coſtly than the other plowes. And thoughe theſe plowes be well tempred for one maner of grounde, that tempre wyll not ſerue in an other maner of grounde, but it muſte reſte in the dyſcretion of the houſbande, to knowe whanne it gothe well.
            
            
               ¶ The neceſſary thynges, that belonge to a ploughe, carte, and wayne.
               BVt or he begyn to plowe, he muſte haue his ploughe and his ploughe yren, his oxen or horſes, and the geare that belongeth to them, that is to ſay, bowes, yokes, landes, ſtylkynges, wrethynge temes. And or he ſhall lode his corne, he muſte haue a wayne, a copyoke, a payre of ſleues, awayne rope, and a pykforke. This wayne is made of dyuers peces, that wyll haue a greate reparation, that is to ſaye, the wheles, and thoſe be made of nathes, ſpokes, fellyes, and dowles, and they muſte be well fettred with wood or yren. And if they be yren bounden, they are moche the better, and thoughe they be the derer at the fyrſt, yet at lengthe they

be better cheape, for a payre of wheles yren bounde, wyl weare. vii. or. viii payre of other wheles, and they go rounde and lyght after oxen or horſes to draw. Howbeit on marreis ground and ſoft grouud, the other wheles be better, bycauſe they be broder on the ſoule, and will not go ſo depe. They muſt haue an axiltre, clout with. viii. waincloutes of yren. ii. lyn pinnes of yren in the axiltre endes. ii. axil pynnes of yren, or els of tough harde wodde. The bodye of the wayne of oke, the ſtaues, the nether rathes, the ouer rathes, the croſſe ſomer, the keys and pikſtaues. And if he go with a hors ploughe, than muſte he haue his horſes or mares, or both his hombers or collers, holmes whyted, treſſes, ſwyngletrees, and togwith. Alſoo a carte made of aſſhe, bycauſe it is lyghte and lyke ſtuffe to it as is to a wayne, and alſo a cart ſadel, bakbandes, and belybandes, and a carte ladder behinde, whan he ſhall carye eyther corne or kyddes, or ſuche other. And in many countreys theyr waynes haue carte ladders bothe behynde and before. Alſo an huſbande muſte haue an axe, a hachet, a hedgyngebyll, a pyn awgur, a reſt awgur, a flayle, a ſpade, and a ſhouell. And howe be it that I gyue theym theſe names, as is moſt comonly vſed in my contrey,

I knowe they haue other names in other countreyes. But hereby a manne maye perceyue many thynges, that belonge to huſbandry, to theyr greate coſtes and charges, for the mayntenance and vpholdyng of the ſame. And many moo thynges are belongynge to huſbandes than theſe, as ye ſhall well perceyue, er I haue made an ende of this treatyſe. And if a yonge huſbande ſhulde bye all theſe thynges, it wolde be coſtely for hym: wherfore it is neceſſarye for hym, to lerne to make his yokes, oxe bowes, ſtooles, and all maner of plough geare.
            
            
               ¶ Whether is better a plough of horſes or a plough of oxen.
               IT is to be knowen, whether is better a plough of horſes, or a plough of oxen, and therin me ſemeth oughte to be made a diſtinction. For in ſome places, an oxe ploughe is better than a horſe plough, and in ſomme places, a horſe ploughe is better: that is to ſay, in euery place, where as the huſband hath ſeueral paſtures, to put his oxen in, whan they come fro theyr warke, there the oxe ploughe is better. For an oxe maye nat endure his warke, to labour all daye, and than to be put

to the commons, or before the herdman, and to be ſet in a folde all nyghte without meate, and go to his labour in the mornynge. But and he be put in a good paſture all nyghte, he wyll labour moche of all the daye dayely. And oxen wyl plowe in tough cley, and vpon hylly grounde, where as horſes wyll ſtande ſtll. And where as is noo ſeuerall paſtures, there the horſe plowe is better, for the horſes may be teddered or tyed vpon leys, balkes, or hades, where as oxen maye not be kept: and it is not vſed to tedder them, but in fewe places. And horſes wyl goo faſter than oxen on euen grounde or lyght grounde, &amp; be quicker for cariage: but they be ferre more coſtly to kepe in winter, for they muſt haue both hey and corne to eate, and ſtrawe for lytter, they muſt be well ſhodde on all foure fete, and the gere that they ſhal drawe with is more coſtely than for the oxen, and ſhorter whyle it wyll laſt. And oxen wyll eate but ſtraw, and a lyttell hey, the whiche is not halfe the coſte that horſ is muſt haue, and they haue no ſhoes, as horſes haue. And if any ſorance come to the horſe, or waxe olde, broyſed, or blynde, than he is lyttell worthe. And if any ſorance come to an oxe, waxe old, broyſed, or blinde, for. ii. s. he maye be fedde, and thanne he is

mannes meate, and as good or better than euer he was. And the horſe, whan he dyethe, is but caryen. And therfore me ſemeth, all thynges conſydered, the ploughe of oxen is moche more profytable, than the ploughe of horſes.
            
            
               ¶ The dylygence and the attendaunce that a huſbande ſhulde gyue to his warke, in maner of an other prologue, and the ſpeciall grounde of all this treatyſe.
               THou huſbande, that intendeſte to gette thy lyuynge by huſbandry, take hede to the ſayenge of the wyſe phyloſopher, the which ſayth, A dhibe curam, tenemenſuram, et eris diues. That is to ſaye, Take hede to thy charge, kepe meaſure, and thou ſhalt be ryche. And nowe to ſpeke of the fyrſte artycle of theſe. iij. ſ. A dhibe curam. He that wyll take vpon hym to do any thinge, and be ſlouthefull, recheles, and not diligent, to execute and to performe that thynge, that he taketh vpon hym, he ſhall neuer thryue by his occupation. And to the ſame entente ſaythe our lorde in his goſpell, by a parable. Nemo mittens manum ſuam ad aratrum

reſpiciens retro, aptus eſt regno dei. The ſpirytuall conſtructyon of this texte, I remytte to the doctours of dyuynitie, and to the greate clarkes, but to reduce and brynge the ſame texte to my purpoſe, I take it thus, There is noo man, puttynge his hande to the plough loking backewarde, is worthy to haue that thynge, that he oughte to haue. For if he goo to the ploughe, and loke backewarde, he ſeeth not, whether the plough go in rydge or rayne, make a balke, or go ouerthwarte. And if it ſo do, there wyll be lyttel corne. And ſo if a man attende not his huſbandrye, but goo to ſporte or playe, tauerne or ale houſe, or ſlepynge at home, and ſuche other ydle warkes, he is not than worthy to haue any corne. And therfore, Fac quod veniſti, Do that thou comeſt fore, and thou ſhalte fynde that thou ſekeſt fore. &amp;c.
            
            
               ¶ Howe a man ſhulde plowe all maner of landes all tymes of the yere.
               NOwe theſe plowes be made and tempered, it is to be knowen, howe a man ſhoulde plowe all tymes of the yere. In the begynnynge of the yere, after the feaſt

of the Epiphany, it is tyme for a huſbande to go to the ploughe. And if thou haue any leys, to falowe or to ſowe otes vpon, fyrſte plowe them, that the graſſe and the moſſe may rotte, and plowe them a depe ſquare forowe. And in all maner of plowynge, ſe that thy eye, thy hande, and thy fote do agree, and be alwaye redy one to ſerue a nother, and to turne vp moche molde, and to lay it flat, that it rere not on edge. For if it rere on edge, the graſſe and moſſe wyll not rotte. And if thou ſowe it with winter corne, as whete or ry, as moche corne as toucheth the moſſe, wyll be drowned, the moſſe dothe kepe ſuch wete in it ſelf. And in ſome countreys, if a man plowe depe, he ſhall paſſe the good grounde, and haue but lyttel corne: but that countrey is not for men to kepe huſbandry vppon, but for to rere and brede catell or ſhepe, for elles they muſte go beate theyr landes with mattockes, as they do in many places of Cornewayle, and in ſom places of Deuonſhyre.
            
            
               ¶ To plowe for peaſe and beanes.
               HOwe to plowe for pees and beanes, were neceſſarye to knowe. Fyrſt thou muſte remember, whiche is mooſte cley

grounde, and that plowe fyrſte, and lette it lye a good ſpace, er thou ſowe it: bycauſe the froſte, the rayne, the wynde, and the ſonne may cauſe it to breake ſmalle, to make moche molde, and to rygge it. And to plow a ſquare forowe, the bredthe and the depenes all one, and to laye it cloſe to his felow. For the more forowes, the more corne, for a generall rule of all maner of cornes. And that may be proued at the comynge vp of all maner of corne. to ſtande at the landes ende, and loke toward the other ende. And than may ye ſe, howe the corne groweth.
            
            
               ☞ Howe to ſowe bothe peaſe and beanes.
               THou ſhalt ſowe thy peas vpon the cley grounde, and thy beanes vpon the barley grounde: for they wolde haue ranker grounde than peaſe. How be it ſome huſbandes holde opynion, that bigge and ſtyffe grounde, as cley, wolde be ſowen with bigge ſtuffe, as beanes: but me thynke the contrary. For if a dry ſommer come, his beanes wil be ſhorte. And if the grounde be good, putte the more beanes to the peaſe, and the better ſhall they yelde, whan they be threſſhed. And

if it be very ranke groūde, as is moche at euery towne ſyde, where catel doth reſort, plowe not that lande, tyll ye wyll ſowe it. for if ye do, there wyll come vppe kedlokes and other wedes. And than ſowe it with beanes. for if ye ſowe pees, the kedlokes wyll hurte them. and whā ye ſe ſeaſonable time, ſow both pees and beanes, ſo that they be ſowen in the begynnynge of Marche. Howe ſhall ye knowe ſeaſonable tyme? go vppon the lande, that is plowed, and if it ſynge or crye, or make any noyſe vnder thy fete, than it is to wete to ſowe: and if it make no noyſe, and wyll beare thy horſes, thanne ſowe in the name of god, but howe to ſowe? Put thy pees in to thy hopper, and take a brode thonge of ledder, or of garthe webbe of an elle longe, and faſten it to bothe endes of the hopper, and put it ouer thy heed, lyke a leyſſhe: and ſtande in the myddes of the lande, where the ſacke lyethe, the whiche is mooſte conueniente for the fyllynge of thy hopper, and ſet thy lefte foote before, and take an handefull of pees: and whan thou takeſte vp thy ryghte foote, than caſte thy pees fro the all abrode, and whan thy lefte fote ryſeth, take an other handeful, and whan the ryght fote ryſeth, thā caſt them fro the. And ſo at euery. ii. paces, thou ſhalte

an handful of pees: and ſo ſe that the fote and the hande agree, and than ye ſhal ſowe euen. And in your caſtynge, ye muſte open as well your fyngers, as your hande, and the hyer, and farther that ye caſte your corne, the better ſhall it ſprede, excepte it be a greatte wynde. And if the lande be verye good, and wyll breke ſmall in the plowynge, it is better to ſowe after the ploughe, thanne tarye any lenger.
            
            
               ¶ Sede of diſcretion.
               THere is a ſede, that is called Diſcretiō, and if a huſband haue of that ſede, and myngle it amonge his other cornes, they wyll growe moche the better. for that ſede wyll tell hym, how many caſtes of corne euery lande ought to haue. And a yonge huſbande, and may fortune ſome olde huſbande, hath not ſufficyente of that ſede: and he that lackethe, let hym borowe of his neyghbours that haue. And his neyghbours be vnkynde, if they wyll not lende this yonge houſbande parte of this ſede. For this ſede of Diſcretion hath a wonders property: for the more that it is taken of or lente, the more it is. And therfore me ſemeth, it ſhoulde be more ſpyſpirituall

than temporall, wherin is a greate dyuerſitie. For a temporall thynge, the more it is deuyded, the leſſe it is: and a ſpirytuall thynge, the more it is deuided, the more it is. Verbi gratia. For enſaumple, I put caſe a wyfe brynge a lofe of breade to the churche, to make holy breade of, whan it is cut in many ſmal peces, and holy breade made therof, there may be ſo many men, women, and children in the churche, that by that tyme, the prieſt hath delte to euery one of them a lyttell pece, there ſhall neuer a crume be lefte in the hamper. And a ſpiritualle thynge as a Pater noſter, or a prayer, that any man can ſay, let hym teache it to. xx. a. C. or to a. M. yet is the prayer neuer the leſſe, but moche more. And ſo this ſede of Diſcreciō is but wiſdome and reaſon: and he that hath wyſedome, reaſon, and diſcretion, may teche it, and enforme other men as he is bounde to do. wherein he ſhall haue thanke of god: and he doth but as god hath commaunded hym in his goſpell, Quod gratis accepiſtis, gratis date: That thynge that ye toke frely, gyue it frely again, and yet ſhall ye haue neuer the leſſe.
            
            
               ¶ Howe all maner corne ſhoulde be ſowen.
               
                  
BVt yet me thynkethe it is neceſſarye to declare, howe all maner of corne ſhuld be ſowen, and howe moch vpon an acre moſt comonly, and fyrſt of peaſe and beanes. An acre of grounde, by the ſtatute, that is to ſay. xvi. fote and a halfe, to the perche or pole, foure perches to an acre in bredth, and fortye perches to an acre in lengthe, may be metelye well ſowen with two London buſſhelles of peaſe, the whyche is but two ſtrykes in other places. And if there be the. iiii. parte beanes, than wylle it haue halfe a London buſhelle more: and yf it be halfe beanes, it wyll haue thre London buſhels: and if it be all beanes, it wyll haue foure London buſſhelles fullye, and that is half a quarter, bycauſe the beanes be gret, and grow vp ſtreight, &amp; do not ſprede and go abrode as peaſe do. An acre of good beanes is worth an acre &amp; a half of good pees bycauſe there wylle be more buſſhelles. And the beſte propertie, that belongeth to a good huſband is, to ſowe all maner of corne thycke ynough, and ſpecially beanes and barley▪ for commonly they be ſowen vpon ranke ground, and good grounde wylle haue the burthen of corne or of wede. And as moche plowynge and harowynge hath an acre of grounde, and ſowe thervppon but oone buſſhelle, as yf he

ſowed. iiii. buſſhelles. And vndoutedly. i. buſſhell may not gyue ſo moche corne agayne, as the. iiii. buſſhels, though the. iii. buſhels, that he ſowed more, be alowed and ſet aparte. And i. buſſhel and an halfe of white or grene pees, wyll ſowe as moche grounde, as two buſſhels of gray pees: and that is bycauſe they be ſo ſmal, and the huſband nedeth not to take ſo great an handful. In ſome countreys they begyn to ſowe pees ſoone after Chriſtmaſſe: and in ſome places they ſowe bothe pees and beanes vnderforowe: and thoſe of reſon muſt be ſowen betyme. But moſte generally, to begyn ſone after Candelmaſſe, is good ſeaſon, ſo that they be ſowen, ere the begynnynge of Marche, or ſone vpon. And ſpecially let them be ſowen in the olde of the mone. For thopinion of olde huſbandes is, that they ſhoulde the better codde, and the ſooner be rype. But I ſpeke not of haſty pees, for they be ſowen before Chriſtmaſſe. &amp;c.
            
            
               ¶ To ſowe barley.
               EVery good houſbande hath his barleye falowe well dounged, and lyenge rygged all the depe and colde of wynter, the whiche ryggynge maketh the lande to

be drye, and the dongynge maketh it to be melowe and ranke. And if a drye ſeaſon come before Candelmaſſe, or ſone after, it wolde be caſte downe and waterforowed bytwene the landes, that the wete reſt not in the raine: and in the begynnynge of Marche, rydge it vppe agayne, and to ſowe in euery acre fyue London buſhelles, or foure at the leaſte. and ſome yeres it maye ſo fortune, that there cometh no ſeaſonabe wether before Marche, to plowe his barley erthe. And as ſoone as he hath ſowen his pees and beanes, than let hym caſte his barley erthe, and ſhortly after rygge it agayne: ſoo that it be ſowen before Apryll. And if the yere tyme be paſte, than ſowe it vpon the caſtynge.
               ¶ It is to be knowen that there be thre maner of barleys, that is to ſay, ſprot barleye, longe eare, and bere barley, that ſome menne call bigge. Sprot barley hath a flat eare moſt comonly, thre quarters of an inche brode, and thre inches long, and the cornes be very great and white, and it is the beſt barley. Long eare hath a flatte eare, halfe an inche brode, and foure inches and more of length: but the corne is not ſo greate nor ſoo whyte, and ſooner it wyll turne and growe to otes Bere barleye, or bygge, wolde be ſowen vppon lyghte and

drye grounde, and hathe an eare thre ynches of lengthe or more, ſette foure ſquare, lyke pecke whete, ſmall cornes, and lyttel floure, and that is the worſte barley, and foure London buſhels are ſuffycient for an acre. And in ſome countreyes, they do not ſowe theyr barley tyll Maye, and that is mooſte commonly vpon grauel or ſandy grounde. But that barley generally is neuer ſoo good, as that that is ſowen in Marche. For if it be verye drie wether, after it be ſowen, that corne that lyeth aboue, lyeth drie, and hath noo moyſture, and that that lyeth vndernethe, commeth vp: and whan rayne cometh, than ſprutteth that that lyeth aboue, and oftentymes it is grene, whan the other is rype: and whan it is threſſhen, there is moche lyght corne. &amp;c.
            
            
               ☞ To ſowe otes.
               ANd in Marche is tyme to ſowe otes, and ſpecially vpon lyght grounde and drie, howe be it they wylle growe on weter grounde, than any corne els: for wete grounde is good for no maner of corne, and thre London buſhels wyl ſowe an acre.
               And it is to be knowen, that there be. iii. maner of otes, that is to ſaye, redde otes, blacke

otes, and roughe otes. Red otes are the beſte otes, and whan they be threſſhed, they be yelowe in the buſſhell, and verye good to make otemele of. Blacke otes are as great as they be, but they haue not ſo moche floure in them, for they haue a thycker huſke, and alſo they be not ſo good to make otemele. The roughe otes be the worſte, and it quiteth not the coſte to ſowe them: they be very lyghte, and haue longe tayles, wherby they wyll hange eche one to other. All theſe maner of otes weare the grounde very ſore, and maketh it to beare quyche. A yonge houſbande oughte to take hede, howe thycke he ſowethe all maner of corne, two or three yeres: and to ſe, howe it cometh vp, and whether it be thycke ynoughe or not: and if it be thynne, ſowe thycker the nexte yere: and if it be well, holde his hande there other yeres: and if it be to thynne, let hym remember hym ſelfe, whether it be for the vnſeaſonablenes of the wether, or for thyn ſowynge. And ſo his wyſedome and diſcretion muſte diſcerne it.
            
            
               ¶ To harowe all maner of cornes.
               
                  
NOwe theſe landes be plowed, and the cornes ſowen, it is conuenient, that they be well harowed, or els crowes, doues, and other byrdes wyll eate and beare awaye the cornes. It is vſed in many countreys, the huſbandes to haue an oxe harowe, the whiche is made of ſixe ſmal peces of timbre, called harowe bulles, made eyther of aſſhe or oke, they be two yardes longe, and as moche as the ſmall of a mannes legge, and haue ſhotes of wode put through theym lyke lathes, and in euery bull are ſyxe ſharpe peces of yren, called harowe tyndes, ſet ſome what a ſlope forwarde, and the formes flote muſte be bygger than the other, bycauſe the fote teame ſhall be faſtened to the ſame with a ſhakyll, or a withe to drawe by. This harrowe is good to breake the greatte clottes, and to make moche molde, and than the horſe harowes to come after, to make the clottes ſmaller, and to laye the grounde euen. It is a great labour and payne to the oxen, to goo to harowe: for they were better to goo to the plowe two dayes, thanne to harowe one daye. It is an olde ſayinge, The oxe is neuer wo▪ tyll he to the harowe goo. And it is bycauſe it goeth by twytches, and not alwaye after one draughte. The horſe harrowe is

made of fyue bulles, and paſſe not an elne of lengthe, and not ſoo moche as the other, but they be lyke ſloted and tinded. And whā the corne is well couered, than it is harowed ynough. There be horſe harowes, that haue tyndes of wodde: and thoſe be vſed moche about Ryppon, and ſuche other places, where be many bulder ſtones. for theſe ſtones wold weare the yren to ſoone, and thoſe tyndes be mooſte commonly made of the grounde ende of a yonge aſſhe, and they be more thanne a fote longe in the begynnyuge, and ſtande as moche aboue the harowe as benethe. And as they weare, or breake, they dryue them downe lower, and they wolde be made longe before, ere they be occupied, that they maye be drye. for than they ſhall endure and laſt moche better, and ſtycke the faſter. The horſes that ſhall drawe theſe harowes, muſte be well kepte and ſhodde, or elles they wyll ſoone be tyred, and ſore beate, that they may not drawe. They muſt haue hombers or collers, holmes withed about theyr neckes, treſſes to drawe by, and a ſwyngletre to holde the treſſes abrode, and a togewith to be bytwene the ſwyngletre and the harowe. And if the barleye grounde wyll not breake with harrowes, but be clotty, it wolde be beaten

with malles, and not not ſtreyght downe. for than they beate the corne in to the erthe. And if they beate the clot on the ſyde, it wyll the better breake. And the clot wyll lye lyghte, that the corne maye lyghtely come vp. And they vſe to role theyr barley grounde after a ſhoure of rayne, to make the grounde euen to mowe. &amp;c.
            
            
               ¶ To falowe.
               NOwe theſe houſbandes haue ſowen theyr pees, beanes, barley, and otes, and harowed them, it is the beſte tyme to falowe, in the later ende of Marche and Apryll, for whete, rye and barley. And lette the huſbande do the beſte he can, to plowe a brode forowe and a depe, ſoo that he turne it cleane, and lay it flat, that it rere not on the edge: the whiche ſhall deſtroy all the thiſtils and wedes. For the deper and the broder that he gothe, the more newe molde, and the greatter clottes ſhall he haue, and the greatter clottes, the better wheate. for the clottes kepe the wheate warme all wynter, and at Marche they wyll melte and breake, and fal in manye ſmall peces, the whiche is a newe dongynge, and refreſſhynge of the corne.
               
                  
And alſo there ſhall but lyttell wedes growe vpon the falowes, that are ſo falowed. For the plough goth vndernethe the rootes of all maner of wedes, and tourneth the roote vpwarde, that it maye not growe. And yf the lande be falowed in wynter tyme, it is farre the worſe, for three principall cauſes, One is, all the rayne that commeth, ſhal waſhe the lande, and dryue awaye the dounge and the good moulde, that the lande ſhall be moche the worſe. An other cauſe is, the rayne ſhall beate the lande ſo flat, and bake it ſo hard togyther, that if a drye May come, it wyll be to harde to ſtere in the moneth of Iune. And the thyrde cauſe is, the wiedes ſhall take ſuche roote, er ſterynge tyme comme, that they wylle not be cleane tourned vndernethe, the whiche ſhal be great hurte to the corne, whan it ſhall be ſowen, and ſpecially in the weding tyme of the ſame. and for any other thynge, make a depe holowe forowe in the rydge of the lande, and loke wel, thou reſt balke it nat, for if thou do, there wyll be many thyſtels: and than thou ſhalte not make a cleane rydge at the fyrſte ſterynge, and therfore it muſte nedes be depe plowed, or elles thou ſhalt nat tourne the wiedes cle ane.
            
            
               
               ¶ To cary out donge or mucke and to ſprede it.
               ANd in the later ende of Apryll, and the begynnynge of Maye, is tyme to cary out his dounge or mucke, and to lay it vppon his barley grounde. And where he hath barley this yere, ſowe it with whete or rye the next tyme it is falowed, and ſo ſhal he mucke all his landes ouer at euerye ſeconde falowe. But that huſbande, that can fynde the meanes to cary oute his donge, and to laye it vpon his lande, after it be ones ſturred: it is moche better, than to laye it vppon his falowe, for dyuers cauſes. One is, if it be layde vpon his fallowe, all that fallethe in the holowe rygge, ſhall do lyttell good for whan it is rygged agayne, it lyeth ſoo depe in the erthe, thut it wyll not be plowed vp agayne, excepte that whan he hath ſprede it, he wyll with a ſhouell, or a ſpade, caſte out all that is fallen in the rygge. And if it be layde vpon the ſturrynge, at euery plowynge it ſhall medle the donge and the erthe togyder, the whiche ſhall cauſe the corne moche better to growe and encreace. And in ſomme places, they lode not theyr donge, tyll harueſt be done, &amp; that is vſed in the farther ſyde

of Darbyſhyre, called Scareſdale, Halomſhyre, and ſo northewarde towarde Yorke and Ryppon: and that I calle better thanne vppon the falowe, and ſpecyally for barley: but vppon the fyrſte ſturrynge, is beſte for wheate and rye. and that his dunge be layde vpon ſmal hepes nygh together, and to ſprede it euenly, and to leue no dounge there as the mucke hepe ſtode, for the moyſtnes of the dounge ſhall cauſe the grounde to be ranke ynoughe. And if it be medled with erthe, as ſholynges and ſuche other, it wyll laſte the longer, and better for barley than for whete or rye, bycauſe of wedes. Horſe donge is the worſte donge that is. The donge of all maner catell, that chewe theyr cudde, is verye good. And the dounge of douues is beſt, but it muſte be layde vppon the grounde verye thynne.
            
            
               ¶ To ſet out the ſhepe folde.
               ALſo it is tyme to ſet out the ſhepefolde in May, and to ſette it vppou the rye grounde, if he haue any, and to flyte it euery mornynge or nyght: and in the mornynge, whan he cometh to his folde, let not his ſhepe out anone, but reyſe theym vp, and

let them ſtande ſtylle a good ſeaſon, that they maye donge and pyſſe. And go amonge them, to ſe whether any of them haue any mathes, or be ſcabbed: and ſe them thre or foure tymes on the oone ſyde, and as ofte on the other ſyde. And whan the kelles begonne beſyde the grounde, than lette theym out of the folde, and dryue theym to the ſoundeſte place of the felde. But he that hath a falowe felde, ſeueral to hym ſelfe, let hym occupie no folde. For foldynge of ſhepe maketh them ſcabbed, and bredeth mathes, and whanne a ſtorme of yll wether commeth in the night, they can nat flee nor go awaye, and that appeyreth them ſore of their fleſſhe. But lette that man, that hath ſuch a ſeueral falowe felde, driue twentie, thyrty, or forty ſtakes, accordynge to the nombre of his ſhepe, vpon his falowe, where he wolde ſette his folde, and ſpecially in the fartheſt parte of the fyelde, frome thenſe as they comme in, for the goynge vppon dothe moche good. And lette the ſheparde brynge his ſhepe to the ſtakes, and the ſheepe wylle rubbe them on the ſtakes. And lette the ſheparde goo aboute them, tyll they be ſette, and thus ſerue theym two or three nyghtes, and they wyll folowe thoſe ſtakes, as he flytteth them, and ſyt by them. And if any yll wether

come they wyll ryſe vp, and go to the hedge. And this maner of foldynge ſhall brede noo mathes nor ſcabbe, nor appeyre theym of theyr fleſſhe, and ſhall be a greate ſauegarde to the ſhepe for rottynge: and in the mornynge put them out of theyr paſture, and thou ſhalte not nede to bye any hurdels nor ſhepe flekes, but howe ye ſhall ſalue them or dreſſe them, ye ſhall vnderſtande in the chapyter of ſhepe after.
            
            
               ¶ To cary wodde and other neceſſaryes.
               ANd in May, whan thou haſt falowed thy grounde, and ſet oute thy ſhepefolde, and caryed oute thy dounge or mucke, if thou haue any wodde, cole, or tymbre to cary, or ſuche other buſynes, that muſt nedes be doone, with thy charte or wayne, than is it tyme to do it. For than the waye is lyke to be fayre and drye, and the days longe. and that tyme the huſbande hath leeſte to doo in huſbandry. Perauenture I ſet one thynge to be done at one tyme of the yere, and if the huſbande ſhulde do it, it ſhulde be a greatter loſſe to hym in an other thynge. Wherfore it is moſte conuenient to do that thynge fyrſt, that

is moſte profytable to hym, and as ſoone as he can do the other labour.
            
            
               ¶ To knowe dyuers maner of wedes.
               IN the later ende of Maye, and the begynninge of Iune, is tyme to wede thy corne. There be diuers maner of wedes, as thiſtyls, kedlokes, dockes, cocledrake, darnolde, gouldes, haudoddes, dogfenell, mathes, ter, and dyuers other ſmall wedes. But theſe be they that greue mooſte: The thiſtyll is an yll wede, roughe and ſharpe to handell, and freteth away the cornes nygh it, and cauſeth the ſherers or reapers not to ſhere cleane Kedlokes hath a leafe lyke rapes, and beareth a yelowe floure, and is an yll wede, &amp; groweth in al maner corne, and hath ſmall coddes, and groweth lyke muſtard ſede. Dockes haue a brode lefe, and diuers high ſpyres, and very ſmall ſede in the toppe. Cockole hath a longe ſmall lefe, and wyl beare fyue or vi. floures of purple colour, as brode as a grote, and the ſede is rounde and blacke, and maye well be ſuffred in breade corne, but not in ſede, for therin is moch floure Drake is lyke vnto rye, till it begynne to ſede, and it hath many ſedes

lyke fenell ſedes, and hangeth downewarde, and it maye wel be ſuffred in breade, for there is moche floure in the ſede: and it is an opinion that it commeth of rye. &amp;c. Dernolde groweth vp ſtreyght lyke an hye graſſe, and hath longe ſedes on eyther ſyde the ſtert, and there is moche floure in that ſede, and growethe moche amonge barley: and it is ſayde, that it cometh of ſmall barley. Golds hath a ſhorte iagged lefe, and groweth halfe a yarde hygh, and hath a yelowe floure, as brode as a grote and is an yll wede, and groweth commonlye in barleye and pees. Hawdod hath a blewe floure, and a fewe lyttell leues, and hath. v. or ſyxe braunches, floured in the toppe: and groweth comonly in rye vpon leane grounde, and dothe lyttel hurte. Doggefenell and mathes is bothe one, and in the commynge vp is lyke fenell, and beareth many white floures, with a yelowe ſede: and it is the worſte wede that is, excepte terre, and it commeth mooſte commonly, whan great wete commeth ſhortly after the corne is ſowen. Terre is the worſte wede, and it neuer dothe appere, tyll the moneth of Iune, and ſpecyallye whanne there is great wete in that mone, or a lyttell before, and groweth mooſte in rye, and it groweth lyke fytches, but it is moche ſmaller, and it

wyll growe as hyghe as the corne, and with the weyght therof, it pulleth the corne flatte to the erth, and freteth the eares away. Wherfore I haue ſeene houſbandes mowe downe the corne and it together: And alſo with ſharp hokes to repe it, as they doo pees, and made it drye, and than it wyll be good fodder.
               There be other wedes not ſpoken of, as dee, nettylles, dodder, and ſuche other, that doo moche harme.
            
            
               ¶ Howe to wede corne.
               NOwe it wolde be knowen, howe theſe cornes ſhulde be weded. The chyefe inſtrument to wede with, is a paire of tonges made of wode and in the farther ende it is nycked, to holde the wed faſter, and after a ſhoure of raine, it is beſte wedynge, for than they maye be pulled vp by the rotes, and than it cometh neuer agayne. And if it be drye wether, than muſte ye haue a wedynge hoke with a ſocket ſet vpon a lyttel ſtaffe of a yarde longe, and this hoke wolde be well ſteeled, and grounde ſharpe bothe behynde and before. And in his other hande he hath a forked ſtycke a yarde longe, and with his forked ſtycke he putteth the wede from hym, and he

putteth the hoke beyond the rote of the wede, and pulleth it to hym, and cutteth the wede faſt by the erthe, and with his hoke he taketh vp the wede, and caſteth it in the reane, and if the reane be full of corne, it is better it ſtande ſtyll, whan it is cut, and wyddre: but let hym beware, that he trede not to moche vppon the corne, and ſpecyallye after it is ſhotte, and whan he cutteth the wede, that he cut not the corne: and therfore the hoke wolde not paſſe an inche wyde. And whanne the wede is ſoo ſhorte, that he can not with his forked ſtycke put it from hym, and with the hoke pull it to hym, thanne muſte he ſet his hoke vppon the wede, faſt by the erthe, and put it from hym, and ſo ſhall he cutte it cleane. And with theſe two inſtrumentes, he ſhall neuer ſtoupe to his warke. Dogfenell, goldes, mathes, and kedlokes are yll to wede after this maner, they growe vppon ſo many braunches, harde by the erthe: and therfore they vſe moſt to pul them vppe with theyr handes, but loke well, that they pull not vppe the corne with all, but as for terre, there wyll noo wedynge ſerue.
            
            
               ¶ The fyrſt ſturrynge.
               
                  
ALſo in Iune is tyme to rygge vppe the falowe, the whiche is called the fyrſt ſturrynge, and to plowe it as depe as thou canſte, for to tourne the rotes of the wedes vpwarde, that the ſonne, and the drye wether, maye kyll them. And an houſbande can not conuenyentelye plowe his lande, and lode out his dounge bothe vppon a daye, with one draughte of beaſtes: but he maye well lode oute his dounge before none, and lode heye or corne at after none: or he maye plowe before none, and lode hey or corne at after none, with the ſame draughte, and noo hurte to the cattell: bycauſe in lodynge of hey or corne, the cattel is alwaye eatynge or beytynge, and ſoo they can not doo in lodynge of dounge and plowynge.
            
            
               ¶ To mowe graſſe.
               ALlſo in the later ende of Iune is tyme to begyn to mowe, if thy medowe be well growen: but howe ſo euer they be growen, in Iuly, they muſte nedes mowe, for diuers cauſes. One is, it is not conueniēt, to haue hey and corne bothe in occupation at one tyme. Another is, the yonger, and the grener that the graſſe is, the ſofter and the

ſweter it wyll be, whan it is hey, but it wyll haue the more wyddrynge, and the elder the graſſe is, the harder and dryer it is, and the worſe for al maner of cattell: for the ſedes be fallen, the whiche is in maner of prouander, and it is the harder to eate and chowe. And an other cauſe is, if drye wether come, it wyll drye and burne vpon the grounde, and waſte away. Take hede that thy mower mow clene and holde downe the hynder hand of his ſith, that he do not endent the graſſe, and to mowe his ſwathe cleane thorowe to that that was laſte mowen before, that he leaue not a mane bytwene, and ſpecyallye in the common medowe: for in the ſeuerall medowe it maketh the leſſe charge, and that the moldywarpe hilles be ſpredde, and the ſtyckes cleane pycked out of the medowe in Apryll, or in the beginnynge of Maye.
            
            
               ¶ Howe forkes and rakes ſhulde be made.
               
                  A Good huſbande hath his forkes and rakes made redye in the wynter before, and they wolde be gotte bytwene Mighelmaſſe and Martylmaſſe, and beyked, and ſette euen, to lye vpryght in thy

hande: and than they wyll be harde ſtyffe and drye. And whan the houſbande ſytteth by the fyre, and hath nothynge to do, than maye he make theym redye, and tothe the rakes with drye wethy wode, and bore the holes with his wymble, bothe aboue and vnder, and driue the tethe vpwarde faſte and harde, and than wedge them aboue with drye woode of oke, for that is hard, and wil driue and neuer come out. And if he get them in ſappe tyme, all the beykyng and drienge that can be had, ſhal not make them harde and ſtyffe, but they woll alwaye be plyenge: for they be moſte comonly made of haſell and withee, and theſe be the trees that blome, and ſpecially haſell: for it begynneth to blome as ſone as the lefe is fallen. And if the rake be made of grene woode, the heed wyll not abyde vppon the ſtele, and the tethe wyll fall out, whan he hath mooſte nede to them, and let his warke, and loſe moche heye. And ſe that thy rake and forke lye vpryghte in thy hand, for and the one ende of thy rake, or the ſyde of thy forke, hang downe warde, than they be not handſome nor eaſy to worke with.
            
            
               ¶ To tedde and make hey.
               
                  
VVhan thy medowes be mowed, they wolde be well tedded and layde euen vppon the grounde: and if the graſſe be very thycke, it wolde be ſhaken with handes, or with a ſhorte pykforke. for good teddynge is the chiefe poynte to make good hey. and than ſhall it be wyddred all in lyke, orelles not: and whan it is wel wyddred on the ouer ſyde, and dry, than turne it cleane before noone, as ſoone as the dewe is gone: And yf thou dare truſte the wether, lette it lye ſo all nyghte: and on the nexte daye, tourne it agayne before none, and towarde nyght make it in wyndrowes, and than in ſmal hey cockes and ſo to ſtande one nyghte at the leaſte, and ſweate: and on the nexte fayre day, caſte it abrode agayne, and tourne it ones or twyſe, and than make it in greatter hey cockes, and to ſtande ſo one nyghte or more, that it maye vngiue and ſweate for and it ſweate not in the hey cockes, it wyll ſweate in the mowe, and than it wyll be duſtye, and not holſome for hors, beaſtes, nor ſhepe. And whan it ſtandeth in the cockes, it is better to lode, and the more hey maye be loded at a lode, and the faſter it wyll lye. Quyche hey commeth of a graſſe called crofote, and groweth flatte, after the erthe, and bearethe a yelowe floure,

halfe a yarde hygh and more, and hath many knottes towarde the roote, and it is the b
                     •
                  ſte hey for horſes and beaſtes, and the ſweteſte, if it be well got, but it wyll haue moch more wyddrynge than other hey, for els he wyll be pyſſe hym ſelfe and waxe hote, and after duſtye. And for to knowe whanne it is wyddred ynoughe, make a lyttell rope of the ſame, that ye thinke ſhulde be moſte greneſte, and twyne it as harde to gether bytwen your handes as ye canne and ſoo beynge harde twon, let one take a knyfe, and cut it faſte by your hande, and the knottes wyll be moyſte, yf it be not drye ynough-Shorte hey, and leye hey is good for ſhepe, and all maner of catell. if it be well got. A man maye ſpeke of makynge of hey, and gettynge of corne, but god diſpoſeth and ordreth all thynge.
            
            
               ¶ Howe rye ſhulde be ſhorne.
               
                  IN THE later ende of Iuly, or in the begynnynge of Auguſte, is tyme to ſhere Rye, the whiche wolde be ſhorne cleane, and faſte bounden. And in ſomme places they mowe it, the whiche is not ſoo good to the houſbandes prefytte, but it is the ſooner done. For whan it is mowen, it wyll not be

ſo faſt bounden: and he can not gather it ſoo cleane, but there wyll be moche loſſe, and taketh more rowme in the barne than ſhorne corne dothe. And alſo it wyll not kepe nor ſaue it ſelfe frome rayne or yll wether, whan it ſtandeth in the couer, as the ſhorne corne wyll do.
            
            
               ¶ Howe to ſhere wheate.
               VVheate wolde be ſhorne cleane, and harde bounden in lyke maner, but for a generall rule, take good hede, that the ſherers of all maner of whyte corne, caſt not vppe theyr handes haſtely, for thanne all the loſe corne, and the ſtrawes, that he holdeth not faſte in his hande, flieth ouer his heed, and are loſte: and alſo it wyll pull of the eares, and ſpecyallye of the cornes that be verye rype. In ſomme places they wyll ſhere theyr cornes hyghe, to the entente to mowe theyr ſtubble, eyther to thacke or to bren: if they ſo do, they haue greate cauſe to take good hede of the ſherers. for if the eares of the corne croke downe to the erthe, and the ſherer take not good hede, and put vp the eare, er he cut the ſtrawe: as many eares as be vnder his hoke or ſicle, fall to the erthe,

and be loſte, and whan they mowe the ſtubble, it is great hyndraunce to the profytte of the grounde. And in Sommerſetſhire, about Zelceſtre and Martok, they doo ſhere theyr wheate very lowe, and all the wheate ſtrawe, that they pourpoſe to make thacke of, they do not threſſhe it, but cutte of the eares, and bynde it in ſheues, and call it rede: and therwith they thacke theyr houſes. And if it be a newe houſe, they thacke it vnder theyr fote: the whiche is the beſte and the ſureſt thacking that can be of ſtrawe, for crowes and douues ſhall neuer hurte it.
            
            
               ☞ To mowe or ſhere barley and otes.
               BArley and otes be moſte commonly mowen, and a man or woman folowythe the mower with a hande rake halfe a yarde longe, with. vii. or. viii. tethe, in the lyfte hande, and a ſyckle in the ryghte hande, and with the rake he gethereth as moche as wyll make a ſhefe. And thanne he taketh the barley or otes by the toppes, and pulleth out as moche as wil make a band, and caſteth the band from him on the land, and with his rake and his ſyckle, taketh vp the barley or otes, &amp;

layeth them vppon the bande, and ſo the barley lyeth vnbounden. iii. or. iiii dayes, if it be fayre wether, and than to bynde it. And whan the barley is ledde away, the landes muſte be raked, or els there wyll be moche corne loſte, and if the barley or otes lye, they muſte nedes be ſhorne.
            
            
               ¶ To repe or mowe pees and beanes.
               PEes and benes be moſte commonly laſte reped or mowen of diuers maners, ſome with ſickles, ſome with hokes, 
                     •
                  nd ſome with ſtaffe hokes. And in ſomme places they lay them on repes, and whan they be dry, they laye them to gether on heapes, lyke hey cockes, and neuer bynde them. But the beſt way is, whan the repes be dry, to bynde them, and to ſet theym on the rydge of the landes three ſheues to gether, and loke that your ſherers, repers, or mowers geld not your beanes, that is to ſaye, to cutte the beanes ſo hye, that the nethermoſte codde growe ſtyll on the ſtalke: and whan they be bounden, they are the more redyer to lode and vnlode, to make a reke, and to take fro the mowe to threſſhe. And ſoo be not the repes.
            
            
               
               ¶ Howe all maner of cornes ſhulde be tythed.
               NOwe that all theſe cornes before ſpecy fyed, be ſhorne, mowed, reped, bounden vp, and layde vppon the rydge of the lande, lette the houſbande take hede of goddes commaundemente, and let hym goo to the ende of his lande, and begynne and tell. ix. ſheues, and let hym caſte out the x. ſhefe in the name of god, and ſo to pervſe frō lande to lande, tyll he haue trewely tythed all his corne. And beware, and take hede of the ſayinge of our lorde by his prophete Malachias, the whiche ſaythe, Quia michi non dediſti decimas et primitias, id circo in fame et penuria maledicti eſtis. That is to ſaye, Bycauſe ye haue not gyuen to me your tythes, and your fyrſte fruytes, therfore ye be curſed, and punyſſhed with honger and penury. And accordynge to that ſaynte Auſtyn ſaythe, Da decimas, alioqui incides in decimā partem angelorum qui de celo corruerunt in infernum. That is to ſay, Gyue thy tythes truely, or els thou ſhalt fall amonge the tenthe parte of aungelles, that felle from heuen in to hell, the whiche is an harde worde to euery man, that oughte

to gyue tythes, and doth not gyue them truely. But ſaynte Auſtyne ſaythe a comfortable worde again, to them that gyue theyr tythes truely, that is to ſaye: Decimae ſunt tributa egentium animarum: Tythes are tributes or rewardes to nedye ſoules And ferther he ſaythe: Si decimam dederis, non ſolum abundantiam fructum recipies, ſed etiam ſanitatem corporis et animae conſequeris, That is to ſaye, If thou haue gyuen thy tythes truely, thou ſhalte not all onely receyue the profite, and the abundaunce of goodes, but alſo helthe of bodye and ſoule ſhall folowe. Wolde to god, that euerye man knewe the harde worde of our lorde by his prophete Malachias, and alſo the comfortable wordes of the holy ſaynte Auſtyn. For than wolde I truſte verely, that tythes ſhulde be truely gyuen.
            
            
               ¶ Howe all maner of corne ſhulde be couered.
               NOwe theſe cornes be ſhorne and bounden, and the tithes caſt out, it is tyme to couer theym, ſhoke theym, or halfe throue them, but couerynge is the beſte waye of all maner of whyte corne. And that is, to

ſet foure ſheues one one ſyde, and. iiii. ſheues on the other ſyde, and two ſheues aboue, of the greatteſte, bounden harde nyghe to the nether ende, the whiche muſt be ſet vpwarde, and the top downewarde ſpredde abrode to couer all the other ſheues. And they wyll ſtād beſte in wynde, and ſaue theym ſelfe beſte in rayne, and they wolde be ſet on the rydge of the lande, and the ſayde ſheues to leane together in the toppes, and wyde at the grounde, that the winde may go through, to drye them. Pees and beanes wolde be ſet on the rydge of the lande, thre ſheues together the toppes vpwarde, and wrythen together, and wyde benethe, that they maye the better wyddre.
            
            
               ¶ To lode corne, and mowe it.
               VVhanne all theſe cornes be drye and wyddred ynoughe, than lode theym in to the barne, and laye euerye corne by it ſelfe. And if it be a wete harueſt, make many mowes: and if thou haue not houſynge ynoughe, thanne it is better to laye thy pees and benes without vppon a reke, than other corne, and it is better vppon a ſcaffolde, than vppon the grounde: for than it muſte be well hedged for ſwyne and catel, and the grounde

wyll rotte the bottom, and the ſcaffolde ſaueth both hedgynge and rottynge: but they muſt be well couered bothe. And the huſband may ſet ſhepe or catel vnder the ſame ſcaffold and wyll ſerue hym in ſtede of an houſe, if it be well and ſurely made. &amp;c.
            
            
               ¶ The fyrſt ſturrynge.
               IN Auguſt, and in the begynning of September, is tyme to make his ſeconde ſturrynge, and moſt commonly it is caſt downe and plowed a meane forowe, not to depe nor to ebbe, ſo he turne it clene. And if it be caſte, it wolde be water forowed bytwene the landes, there as the reane ſhulde be, and it wyll be the dryer, whan the lande ſhall be ſowen. And if the landes lie high in the ridge, &amp; highe at the reane, &amp; lowe in the myddes of the ſide, that the water may not ronne eaſely in to the reane, as I ſe dayly in many places: than let the huſband ſet his plough. iii. or. iiii fote frō the rydge, and caſt all the rydge on bothe ſydes, and whan the rydge is caſt, ſet his plough there as he began, and rydge vp the remenant of the lande, and ſo is the land bothe caſt and rydged, and all at one plowynge. And this ſhall cauſe the lande to lye rounde, whan it

is ſowen at the nexte tyme, and than ſhall it not drowne the corne.
            
            
               ☞ To ſowe wheat and rye.
               ABoute Myghelmaſſe it is tyme to ſowe bothe wheate and rye Wheate is mooſte commonlye ſowen vnder the forowe, that is to ſaye, caſte it vppon the falowe, and than plowe it vnder. And in ſome places they ſowe theyr wheate vppon theyr pees ſtubble, the whiche is neuer ſoo good, as that that is ſowen vppon the falowe: and that is vſed, where they make falowe in a fyelde euery fourthe yere. And in Eſſex they vſe to haue a chylde, to go in the forowe before the horſes or oxen, with a bagge or a hopper full of corne, and he taketh his hande full of corne, and by lyttel and lytel caſteth it in the ſayde forowe. Me ſemeth, that chylde oughte to haue moche dyſcretion.
               Howe be it there is moche good corne, and rye is mooſte commonlye ſowen aboue and harrowed, and two London buſſhelles of wheate and rye wyll ſowe an acre. Some grounde is good for wheate, ſome for rye, and ſome is good for bothe: and vppon that ground ſowe blend corne, that is both wheate

and rye, the whiche is the ſureſt corne of growyng, and good for the huſbandes houſhold. And the wheate, that ſhall be medled with rye, muſte be ſuche, as wyll ſoone be rype, and that is flaxen wheate, polerd wheate, or whyte wheate. And ye ſhall vnderſtande, that there be dyuers maners of wheates. Flaxen wheate hath a yelowe eare, and bare without anis, and is the bryghteſt wheate in the buſſhell, and wyll make the whyteſt breed, and it wyll weare the grounde ſore, and is ſmall ſtrawe, and wyll growe very thycke, and is but ſmall corne. Polerde wheate hath noo anis, thycke ſette in the eare, and wyll ſoone fall out, and is greatter corne, and wyll make whyte breed. whyte wheate is lyke polerde wheate in the buſſhell, but it hath anis, and the eare is foure ſquare, and wyll make white breed: and in Eſſex, they call flaxen wheate whyte wheate. Red wheate hath a flat eare, an inche brode, full of anis, and is the greatteſte corne, and the brodeſte blades, and the greatteſt ſtrawe, and wyl make whyte breed, and is the rudeſte of colour in the buſſhell.
               Englyſſhe wheate hath a dunne eare, fewe anis or none, and is the worſte wheate, ſaue peeke wheate. Peeke wheate hath a red eare, ful of anis, thyn ſet, and oft tymes it is flyntered,

that is to ſaye, ſmall corne wrynkeled and dryed, and wyll not make whyte breade, but it wyl growe vpon colde grounde.
            
            
               ¶ To threſſhe and wynowe corne.
               THis wheate and rye, that thou ſhalte ſowe, ought to be very cleane of wede, and therfore, er thou threſſhe thy corne open thy ſheues, and pyke oute all maner of wedes, and than threſſhe it, and wynowe it cleane, and ſo ſhalt thou haue good clene corne an other yere. And in ſome countreys, aboute London ſpecyallye, and in Eſſex and kente, they do fan theyr corne, the whiche is a verye good giſe, and a great ſauegarde for ſhedinge of the corne. And whan thou ſhalte ſell it, if it be well wynowed or fande, it wyll be ſolde the derer, and the lyghte corne wyll ſerue the huſbande in his houſe.

               VVhan thou haſte threſſhed thy pees, and beanes, after they be wynowed, and er thou ſhalte ſowe or ſelle them, let theym be well reed with ſyues, and ſeuered in thre partes, the great from the ſmall,

and thou ſhalte gette in euerye quarter a London buſſhell, or there about. For the ſmalle corne lyeth in the holowe and voyde places of the greate beanes, and yet ſhall the greate beanes be ſolde as dere, as if they were all together, or derer, as a man maye proue by a famylier enſample. Let a man bye. C. hearynges, two hearynges for a penye, and an other. C. hearynges, thre for a peny, and let hym ſell theſe. CC. hearinges agayne v. herynges for. ii d. nowe hath he loſte. iiii. d.

               ¶ Of ſhepe, and what tyme of the yere the rammes ſhulde be put to the ewes.
               AN houſbande can not well thryue by his corne, without he haue other cattell, nor by his cattell, without corne. for els he ſhall be a byer, a borower, or a begger. And bycauſe that ſhepe in myne opynyon is the mooſte profytableſt cattell, that any man can haue, therfore I pourpoſe to ſpeake fyrſt of ſhepe. Than fyrſt it is to be knowen, what tyme thou ſhalt put thy rammes to thy ewes, and therin I make a diſtinction, for euery man maye not put to theyr rammes all at one tyme: for if they doo, there wyll be greate hurte and loſſe. for that man, that hath the beſt ſhepe paſture for wynter, and ſoone ſpryngynge in the begynnynge of the yere, he maye ſuffre his rammes to goo with his ewes all tymes of the yere, to blyſſomme or ryde whan they wyll: but for the comon paſture. it is tyme to put to his rammes at the Exaltation of the holye croſſe: for than the

bucke goth to the rut, and ſo wolde the rāme. But for the common huſbande, that hath noo paſture but the common fieldes, it is tyme ynoughe at the feſte of ſaynt Mychaell the archangel. And for the poore houſbande of the Peeke, or ſuche other, that dwell in hylly and hyghe groundes, that haue no paſtures, nor common fieldes, but all onely the comon hethe, Symon and Iude daye is good tyme for theym, and this is the reaſon why. An ewe goth with lambe. xx. wekes, and ſhall yeane her lambe in the. xxi. weke, &amp; if ſhe haue not conueniente newe graſſe to eate, ſhe maye not gyue her lambe mylke: and for wante of mylke, there be manye lambes peryſſhed and loſte: and alſo for pouertye, the dammes wyll lacke mylke, and forſake theyr lambes, and ſoo often tymes they dye bothe in ſuche harde countreys.
            
            
               ¶ To make an ewe to loue her lambe.
               IF thy ewe haue mylke, and wyll not loue her lambe, put her in a narowe place made of bordes, or of ſmothe trouſe, a yarde wyde, and put the lambe to her, and ſocle it, and yf the ewe ſmyte the lambe with her

heed, bynde her heed with a heye rope, or a corde, to the ſyde of the penne: and if ſhe wyl not ſtande ſyde longe all the ewe, than gyue her a lyttell hey, and tye a dogge by her, that ſhe maye ſe hym: and this wyll make her to loue her lambe ſhortely. And if thou haue a lambe deed, wherof the damme hath moche mylke, fley that lambe, and tye that ſkynne vpon an other lambes backe, that hath a ſory damme, with lyttell mylke, and put the good ewe and that lambe together in the penne, and in one houre ſhe wyll loue that lambe, &amp; than mayſt thou take thy ſory weyke ewe awaye, and put her in an other place: and by this meanes thou mayſte fortune to ſaue her lyfe, and the lambes bothe.
            
            
               ¶ What tyme lambes ſhulde be wayned.
               IN ſome places they neuer ſeuer their lambes from theyr dammes, and that is for two cauſes: One is, in the beſte paſture where the rammes goo alwaye with theyr ewes, there it nedeth not, for the dammes wil waxe drye, and wayne theyr lambes theym ſelfe. An other cauſe is, he that hath noo ſeuerall and ſounde paſture, to put his lambes

vnto, whan they ſhoulde be wayned, he muſte eyther ſell them, or let theym ſucke as longe as the dammes wyll ſuffre theym, and it is a common ſayinge, that the lambe ſhall not rotte, as longe as it ſouketh, excepte the damme want meate. But he that hath ſeueral and ſounde paſture, it is tyme to wayne theyr lambes, whanne they be xvi. wekes olde, or xviii. at the fartheſt, and the better ſhall the ewe take the ramme agayne. And the poore man of the peeke countreye, and ſuche other places, where as they vſe to mylke theyr ewes, they vſe to wayne theyr lambes at xii. wekes olde, and to mylke theyr ewes fiue or ſyxe wekes. &amp;c. But thoſe lambes be neuer ſoo good as the other that ſucke longe, and haue meate ynoughe.
            
            
               ¶ To drawe ſhepe, and ſeuer them in dyuers places.
               THan thou graſier, that haſt many ſhepe in thy paſtures, it is conuenient for the, to haue a ſhepefolde made with a good hedge or a pale, the whiche wyll receyue all thy ſhepe eaſyly that goo in one paſture, ſette betwene two of thy paſtures, in a drye place, and adioynynge to the ende of the ſame,

make an other lyttell folde, that wyll receyue lxxxx. ſhepe or moo, and bothe thoſe foldes muſt haue eyther of theym a gate in to eyther paſture, and at the ende of that folde make an other lyttel folde, that wyll receyue. xl. ſhepe or mo, and betwene euery folde a gate. And whan the ſhepe are in the greate folde, let. xl. of them or there about, come into the myddle folde, and ſteke the gate. And than let the ſhepeherde turne them, and loke them on euery ſyde, and if he ſe or fynde any ſhepe, that nedeth any helpynge or mendinge for any cauſe, lette the ſhepeherde take that ſhepe with his hoke, and put hym in the lyttell folde. And whan he hath taken all that nedeth any mendyng, than put the other in to whether paſture he wyll, and let in as many out of the greate folde, and take thoſe, that nede any handling, and put them into the lyttell folde. And thus peruſe them all tyll he haue doone, and than let the ſhepeherde go belte, greſe, and handel all thoſe that he hath drawen, and than ſhall not the great flocke be taryed nor kepte from theyr meate: and as he hath mended them, to put them into theyr paſture.
            
            
               ¶ To belte ſhepe.
               
                  
IF any ſhepe raye or be fyled with dounge about the tayle, take a payre of ſheres, and clyppe it awaye, and caſt dry muldes thervpon: and if it be in the heate of the ſommer, it wolde be rubbed euer with a lyttell terre, to kepe awaye the flyes. It is neceſſarye, that a ſhepeherde haue a borde, ſet faſt to the ſyde of his lyttell folde, to laye his ſhepe vpon, whan he handeleth theym, and an hole bored in the borde with an augur, and therin a grayned ſtaffe of two fote longe, to be ſet faſt, to hang his terre boxe vpon, and than it ſhall not fall. And a ſhepeherde ſhoulde not go without his dogge, his ſhepe hoke, a payre of ſheres, and his terre boxe, eyther with hym, or redye at his ſhepe folde, and he muſte teche his dogge to barke, whan he wolde haue hym, to ronne whan he wold haue hym, and to leue ronning, whan he wolde haue hym, or els he is not a cunninge ſhepeherd. The dogge muſt lerne it, whan he is a whelpe, or els it wyl not be: for it is harde to make an olde dogge to ſtoupe.
            
            
               ¶ To greaſe ſhepe.
               IF any ſheepe be ſcabbed, the ſhepeherde maye perceyue it by the bytynge, rubbyng, or ſcratchynge with his horne, and mooſte

commonly the woll wyll ryſe, and be thyn or bare in that place: than take 
                     •
                  hym, and ſhede the woll with thy fyngers, there as the ſcab is, and with thy fynger laye a lyttell terre thervpon, and ſtroke it a lengthe in the bottom of the woll, that it be not ſeen aboue. And ſoo ſhede the woll by and by, and laye a lyttell terre thervppon, tyll thou paſſe the ſore, and than it wyll go no farther.
            
            
               ¶ To medle terre.
               LEt thy terre be medled with oyle, goſe greaſe, or capons greaſe, theſe three be the beſte, for theſe wyll make the terre to ronne abrode: butter and ſwynes greaſe, whan they be molten, are good, ſoo they be not ſalte, for terre of hym ſelfe is to kene, and is a fretter, and no healer, without it be medled with ſome of theſe.

               ¶ A medicyne to ſalue poore mennes ſhepe, that thynke terre to coſtely: but I doubte not, but and ryche men knowe it, they wolde vſe the ſame.
               
                  
TAke a ſhete ful of brome croppes, leaues, bloſſomes, and all, and chop them very ſmal, and than ſethe them in a pan of. xx. gallons with rennynge water, tyll it begyn to waxe thycke lyke a gelly, than take two pounde of ſhepe ſuet molten, and a pottell of olde pyſſe, and as moche bryne made with ſalte, and put all in to the ſayde panne, and ſtyrre it aboute, and than ſtreyne it thorowe an olde clothe, and putte it in to what veſſell ye wyll, and yf your ſhepe be newe clypped, make it luke warme, and than waſhe your ſhepe there with, with a ſponge or a pece of an olde mantell, or of faldynge, or ſuche a ſofte cloth or woll, for ſpendynge to moche of your ſalue. And at all tymes of the yere after, ye may relent it, and nede require: and make wyde ſheydes in the woll of the ſhepe, and anoynt them with it, &amp; it ſhal heale the ſcabbe, and kyll the ſhepe lyce, and it ſhall not hurte the woll in the ſale therof. And thoſe that be waſſhen, wyll not take ſcabbe after (if they haue ſufficient meate) for that is the beſte greaſe that is to a ſhepe, to greaſe hym in the mouthe with good meate: the whiche is alſo a greate ſauegarde to the ſhepe for rottynge, excepte there come myldewes, for he wyll choſe the beſte, if he haue

plentye. And he that hath but a fewe ſhepe moderate this medicyne accordynge.
            
            
               ¶ If a ſhepe haue mathes.
               IF a ſhepe haue mathes, ye ſhall perceyue it by her bytynge, or fyſkynge, or ſhakyng of her tayle, and mooſte commonlye it is moyſt and wete: and if it be nyghe vnto the tayle, it is ofte tymes grene, and fyled with his dounge: and than the ſhepeherde muſte take a payre of ſheres, and clyppe awaye the woll bare to the ſkynne, and take a handfull of drye moldes, and caſt the moldes thervpon to drye vp the wete, and than wype the muldes away, and laye terre there as the mathes were, and a lyttell farther. And thus loke theym euery daye, and mende theym, if they haue nede.
            
            
               ¶ Blyndenes of ſhepe, and other dyſeaſes, and remedies therfore.
               THere be ſome ſhepe that wyll be blynd a ſeaſon, and yet mende agayn. And if thou put a lytel terre in his eye, he will mende the rather. There be dyuers waters, &amp; other medicyns, that wolde mende hym, but

this is mooſte common medicyne that ſhepeherdes vſe.
            
            
               ¶ The worme in the ſhepes fote, and helpe therfore
               THere be ſome ſhepe, that hath a worme in his foote, that maketh hym halte. Take that ſhepe, and loke betwene his cleſe, and there is a lyttell hole, as moche as a greatte pynnes heed, and therin groweth fyue or ſyxe blacke heares, lyke an inche long and more, take a ſharpe poynted knyfe, and ſlytte the ſkynne a quarter of an inche long aboue the hole and as moche benethe, and put thy one hande in the holowe of the fote, vnder the hynder cleſe, and ſet thy thombe aboue almooſte at the ſlytte, and thruſte thy fyngers vnderneth forward, and with thy other hand, take the blacke heares by the ende, or with thy knyues poynte, and pull the heares a lyttell and a lyttell, and thruſte after thy other hande, with thy fynger and thy thombe, and there wyll come oute a worme lyke a pece of fleſhe, nygh as moche as a lyttel fynger. And whan it is out, put a lyttel tarre into the hole, and it wyll be ſhortely hole.
            
            
               
               ¶ The blode, and remedy if one come betyme.
               
                  THere is a ſicknes amōg ſhepe, and is called the bloude, that ſhepe, that hath that, wil dye ſodeinly, and er he dye, he wil ſtande ſtill, and hange downe the heed, &amp; other while quake. If the ſhepeherde can eſpye hym, let him take and rubbe hym about the heed, &amp; ſpecyally adout his eares, and vnder his eyen, &amp; with a knyfe cut of his eares in the middes, &amp; alſo let hym blode in a veyne vnder his eien: and if he blede wel, he is lyke to lyue, &amp; if he blede not, than kil him, and ſaue his fleſhe. for if he dye by hym ſelfe, the fleſſhe is loſte, and the ſkyn wyll be ferre ruddyer, lyke blode, more than an other ſkynne ſhall be. And it taketh mooſte commonly the fatteſt and beſt lykynge.
            
            
               ¶ The pockes, and remedy therfore.
               THe pockes appere vppon the ſkyn, and are lyke reed pymples, as brode as a farthynge, and therof wyll dye many. And the remedy therfore is, to handle all thy ſhepe, and to loke on euery parte of theyr bodyes: and as many as ye fynde taken therwith,

put them in freſhe newe graſſe, and kepe them fro theyr felowes, and to loke thy flocke ofte, and drawe theym as they nede. And if it be in ſommer tyme, that there be no froſte, than waſhe them. Howe be it ſome ſhepeherdes haue other medycines.
            
            
               ¶ The wode euyll, and remedy therfore.
               THere is a ſickenes among ſhepe, and is called the wode euyll, and that cometh in the ſprynge of the yere, and takethe them moſte commonly in the legges, or in the necke, and maketh them to halt, and to holde theyr necke awry. And the mooſte parte that haue that ſicknes, wyl dye ſhortely in a day or two. The beſt remedy is, to waſſhe theym a lyttell, and to chaunge theyr grounde, and to bryng them to lowe ground and freſhe graſſe. And that ſycknes is moſte commonly on hylly grounde, ley grounde, and ferny grounde. And ſome men vſe to let them bloudde vnder the eye in a vaine for the ſame cauſe.
            
            
               ¶ To waſhe ſhepe.
               IN Iune is tyme to ſhere ſhepe, and er they be ſhorne, they muſte be verye well waſſhen, the whiche ſhall be to the owner

great profyte in the ſale of his woll, and alſo to the clothe maker. but yet beware, that thou put not to many ſhepe in a penne at one tyme, neyther at the waſhing, nor at the ſheryng, for feare of murtheryng or ouer preſſyng of their felowes, and that none go awaye, tyll he be cleane waſhen. and ſe that they, that hold the ſhepe, by the heed in the water, holde his heed hye ynoughe for drownynge.
            
            
               ¶ To ſhere ſhepe.
               TAke hede of the ſherers, for touchynge the ſhepe with the ſheres. and ſpecially for pryckyng with the poynte of the ſheres, and that the ſhepeherde be alway redy with his tarboxe to ſalue them. And ſe that they be well marked, both eare marke, pitche marke, and radel marke, and let the wol be well folden or wounden with a woll wynder, that can good ſkyll therof, the whiche ſhal do moche good in the ſale of the ſame.
            
            
               ¶ To drawe and ſeuer the badde ſhepe from the good.
               VVhan thou haſte all ſhorne thy ſhepe, it is than beſt tyme to drawe them, and ſoo ſeuer theym in dyuers ſortes, the

ſhepe, that thou wylte fede by them ſelfe, the ewes by theym ſelfe, the ſhare hogges and theyues by them ſelfe, the lambes by theym ſelfe, wedders and the rammes by them ſelf, if thou haue ſoo many paſtures for them: for the byggeſt wyll beate the weikeſte with his heed. And of euery ſorte of ſhepe, it may fortune there be ſome, that like not and be weike, thoſe wolde be put in freſhe graſſe by theym ſelfe: and whan they be a lyttel mended, than ſel them, and ofte chaunge of graſſe ſhal mend all maner of cattell.
            
            
               ☞ What thynges rotteth ſhepe.
               IT is neceſſary that a ſhepeherde ſhoulde knowe, what thynge rotteth ſhepe, that he myghte kepe theym the better. There is a graſſe called ſperewort, and hath a longe narowe leafe, lyke a ſpere heed, and it wyll growe a fote hyghe, and beareth a yelowe floure, as brode as a peny, and it growethe alwaye in lowe places, where the water is vſed to ſtande in wynter. An other graſſe is called peny graſſe, and groweth lowe by the erthe in a marſſhe grounde, and hath a leafe as brode as a peny of two pens, and neuer beareth floure. All maner of graſſe, that the

lande floudde renneth ouer, is verye ylle for ſhepe, bycauſe of the ſande and fylthe that ſtycketh vppon it. All marreys grounde, and marſche grounde is yll for ſhepe. the graſſe that groweth vppon falowes is not good for ſhepe: for there is moche of it wede, and ofte tymes it commeth vppe by the rote, and that bryngeth erthe with it, and they eate both. &amp;c. Myldewe graſſe is not good for ſhepe, and that ye ſhall knowe two wayes. One is by the leaues on the trees in the mornynge, and ſpecyally of okes, take the leaues, and putte thy tonge to them, and thou ſhalt fele like hony vppon them. And alſo there wyll be many kelles vppon the graſſe, and that cauſeth the myldewe. Wherfore they may not well be let out of the folde, tyll the ſonne haue domynation to drye them awaye. Alſo hunger rotte is the worſt rotte that can be, for there is neither good fleſſhe nor good ſkynne, and that cometh for lacke of meate, and ſo for hunger they eate ſuche as they can fynde: and ſo will not paſture ſhepe, for they ſelden rot but with myldewes, and than wyll they haue moch talowe and fleſhe, and a good ſkyn. Alſo white ſnailes be yll for ſhepe in paſtures, and in falowes There is an other rotte, whiche is called pelte rotte, and that commeth of greatte

wete, ſpecyally in woode countreyes, where they can not drye.
            
            
               ¶ To knowe a rotten ſhepe dyuers man
                     •

               TAke bothe your handes, and twyrle vpon his eye, and if he be ruddy. and haue reed ſtryndes, in the white of the eye, than he is ſounde, and if the eye be white, lyke talowe, and the ſtryndes darke celoured, thanne he is rotten. And alſo take the ſhepe, and open the wolle on the ſyde, and yf the ſkynne be of ruddy colour and drye, than is he ſounde, and if it be pale coloured and watrye, thanne is he rotten. Alſo whanne ye haue opened the woll on the ſyde, take a lyttell of the woll bytwene thy fynger and thy thombe, and pull it a lyttel and if it ſticke faſte, he is ſounde, and if it comme lyghtely of, he is rotten. Alſo whan thou haſte kylde a ſhepe, his belly wyll be full of water, if he be ſore rotten, and alſo the fatte of the fleſhe, wyll be yelowe, if he be rotten. And alſo if thou cut the lyuer, therin wyll be lyttell quikens lyke flokes, and alſo the lyuer wyll be full of knottes and whyte blyſters, yf he be

               ¶ To bye leane cattell.
               THeſe houſbandes, if they ſhall well thryue, they muſte haue bothe kye, oxen, horſes, mares, and yonge cattell, and to rere and brede euery yere ſome calues, and fools, or els ſhall he be a byer. And yf thou ſhalte by oxen for the ploughe, ſe that they be yonge, and not gowty, nor broken of heare. neyther of tayle, nor of pyſell. And yf thou bye kye to the payle, ſe that they be yonge and good to mylke, and fede her calues wel. And if thou bye kye or oxen to feede, the yonger they be, the rather they wyll fede, but loke well, that the heare ſtare not, and that he lycke hym ſelfe, and be hoole mouthed, and want no tethe. And though he haue the goute and be broken, bothe of tayle and pyſell, yet wyll he fede. But the gouty oxe wyll not be dryuen ferre and ſe that he haue a brode ryb, and a thycke hyde▪ and to be loſe ſkinned, that it ſtycke not harde nor ſtreyte to his rybbes, for than he wyll not fede.
            
            
               
               ¶ To bye fatte cattell.
               IF thou ſhalte bye fatte oxen or kye, handel them, and ſe that they be ſoft on the forecroppe, behynde the ſhulder, and vpon the hindermoſt rybbe, and vpon the hucbone, and the nache by the tayle. And ſe the oxe haue a greate codde, and the cowe great nauyll, for than it ſhulde ſeme, that they ſhuld be wel talowed. And take hede, where thon byeſte any leane cattel or fat, and of whom, and where it was bred. For if thou by out of a better groūd than thou haſte thy ſelfe, that cattell wyll not lyke with the. And alſo loke, that there be no maner of ſycknes amonge the cattell in that towneſhyp or paſture that thou byeſt thy catel oute of. For if there be any murren or longe ſought, it is great ieoperdy: for a beaſt maye take ſycknes ten or. xii. dayes or more, ere it appere on hym.
            
            
               ¶ Dyuers ſycneſſes of cattell, and remedies therfore, and fyrſt of murren.
               ANd yf it fortune to fall murren amonge thy beaſtes, as god forbede, there be men ynough can helpe them. And it commeth of a ranknes of bloudde, and

appereth moſte commonly fyrſte in the heed: for his heed wyll ſwell, and his eyen waxe greate and ronne of water and frothe at the mouthe, and than he is paſte remedy, and wyl dye ſhortely, and wyll neuer eate after he be ſycke. Than flee hym, and make a depe pytte faſte by, there as he dyeth, and caſte hym in, and couer hym with erthe, that noo dogges maye come to the caryen. For as many beaſtes as feleth the ſmelle of that caryen, are lykely to be enfecte, and take the ſkynne, and haue it to the tanners to ſell, and bryng it not home, for peryll that may fal. And it is commonly vſed, and cometh of a greate charytie, to take the bare heed of the ſame beaſte, and put it vpon a longe pole, and ſet it in a hedge, faſte bounden to a ſtake, by the hyghe waye ſyde, that euerye man, that rydethe or goeth that waye, maye ſe and knowe by that ſigne, that there is ſycknes of cattell in the towneſhyp. And the huſbandes holde an opynyon, that it ſhall the rather ceaſe. And whanne the beaſte is flaine, there as the murren dothe appere bytwene the fleſſhe and the ſkynne, it wyll ryſe vppe lyke a ielly and frothe an inche depe or more. And this is the remedy for the murren. Take a ſmalle curteyne corde, and bynde it harde aboute the beaſtes necke, and

that wyll cauſe the bloudde to come in to the necke, and on eyther ſyde of the necke there is a vayne that a man may fele with his fynger: and than take a bloud yren, and ſet it ſtreight vppon the vayne, and ſmyte hym bloudde on bothe ſydes, and let hym blede the mountenaunce of a pynte or nyghe it, and than take awaye the corde, and it wyll ſtaunche bleding. And thus ſerue all thy cattell, that be in that cloſe or paſture, and there ſhall no mo be ſicke by goddes loue.
            
            
               ¶ Longe ſought, and remedy therfore.
               
                  THere is an nother maner of ſyckeneſſe among beſtes, and it is called longe ſought, and that ſickenes wyl endure lóg, and ye ſhal per ceyue it by his hoyſtynge, he wyl ſtand moche, &amp; eate but a littel, and waxe very holowe &amp; thin. And he wil hoyſt. xx. times in an houre, and but fewe of them do mende. The beſt remedy is to kepe thy cattell in ſondrye places, and as many as were in companye with that beaſt, that fyrſt fell ſycke, to let them a lyttel

bloude. And there be many men, that can ſeuer theym, and that is to cutte the dewlappe before, and there is a graſſe, that is called feitergraſſe, take that graſſe, and broyſe it a lyttell in a morter, and thanne put therof as moche as an hennes egge in to the ſayd dewlappe, and ſe it fall not oute. Thus I haue ſeen vſed, and men haue thought it hath done good.
            
            
               ¶ Dewbolue, and the harde remedy therfore.
               AN other dyſeaſe amonge beaſtes is called dewbolue, and that commeth, whan a hungry beaſte is put in a good paſture full of ranke graſſe, he wyll eate ſoo moche, that his ſydes wyll ſtande as hygh as his backe bone, and other whyle, the one ſyde more thanne the other, and but fewe of them wyll dye, but he maye not be dryuen haſtely, nor laboured, beinge ſo ſwollen, and the ſubſtaunce of it is but wynde: and therfore he wolde be ſoftly dryuen, and not ſytte downe. Howe be it I haue ſeen a manne take a knyfe, and thruſte hym thorowe the ſkynne and the fleſſhe two inches depe, or more, vi. inches or more from the ridge bone, that the

wynde maye come out. For the wynde lyeth bytwene the fleſhe and the greate paunche.
            
            
               ¶ Ryſen vpon, and the remedy therfore.
               AN other dyſeaſe is called ryſen vppon and no man can tell howe, nor wherof it cometh: but ye ſhall perceyue that by ſwellynge in the heed, and ſpecyallye by the eyen, for they wyll ronne on water, and cloſe his ſyghte, and wyll dye ſhortly within an houre or two, if he be not holpen. This is the cauſe of his dyſeaſe. There is a blyſter ryſen vnder the tounge, the whiche blyſter muſt be ſlytte with a knyfe a croſſe. Whan ye haue pulled out the tongue, rubbe the blyſter well with ſalte, and take an hennes egge, and breake it in the beaſtes mouthe ſhell and all, and caſt ſalte to it, and holde vp the beſtes heed, that all maye be ſwalowed downe into the body. But the breakynge of the blyſter is the great helpe, and dryue the beaſte a lyttell aboute, and this ſhall ſaue hym, by the helpe of Ieſu.
            
            
               ☞ The turne, and remedy therfore.
               
                  
THere be beaſtes that wyll turne about, whan they eate theyr meate, and wyll not fede, and is great ieoperdy for fallynge in pyties, dyches, or waters: and it is bycauſe that there is a bladder in the foreheed bytwene the brayne panne and the braynes, the whiche muſt be taken out, or els he ſhal neuer mende, but dye at lengthe, and this is the remedy and the greateſt cure that can be on a beaſte. Take that beaſt, and caſt him downe, and bynde his foure fete together, and with thy thombe, thruſte the beaſt in the foreheed, and where thou fyndeſt the ſofteſt place, there take a knyfe, and cut the ſkyn▪ three or foure inches on bothe ſides bytwene the hornes, and as moche benethe towarde the noſe, and fley it, and turne it vp, and pyn it faſte with a pyn, and with a knyfe cut the brayne pan. ii. inches brode, and thre inches longe, but ſe the knyfe go no deper than the thycknes of the bone for peryſſhynge of the brayne, and take away the bone, and than ſhalt thou ſe a bladder full of water two inches longe and more, take that out, and hurte not the brayne, and thanne let downe the ſkynne, and ſowe it faſte there as it was before, and bynde a clothe two or thre folde vpon his foreheed, to kepe it from colde and wete. x. or. xii. dayes. And thus haue I

ſeen many mended. But if the beaſte be fatte, and any reaſonable meate vpon hym, it is beſt to kyll hym, for than there is but lyttell loſſe. And if the bladder be vnder the horne, it is paſt cure. A ſhepe wyll haue the turne as well as a beaſt, but I haue ſeen none mended.
            
            
               ☞ The warrybrede, and the remedy therfore.
               THere be beaſtes that wyll haue warrybredes in dyuers partes of theyr body and legges, and this is the remedy. Caſt hym downe, and bynde his foure fete together, and take a culture, or a payre of tonges, or ſuche an other yren, &amp; take it glowing hote: and if it be a longe warrybrede, ſere it of harde by the body, and if it be in the beginninge, and be but flatte, than lay the hot yren vpon it, and ſere it to the bare ſkyn, and it will be hole for euer, be it horſe or beaſt.
            
            
               ¶ The foule, and the remedy therfore.
               THere be beſtes, that wyl haue the foule and that is betwene the cleeſe, ſometyme before, and ſome tyme behynde,

and it wyll ſwell, and cauſe hym to halt, and this is the remedy Caſt hym downe and bind his foure fete together, &amp; take a rope of heare, or a hey rope, harde wrythen together, and put it betwene his cleeſe, and drawe the rope to and fro a good ſeaſon, tyll he blede well, and than laye to it ſofte made terre, and binde a cloute aboute it, that noo myre nor grauell come betwene the cleſe: and put hym in a paſture, or let hym ſtande ſtyll in the houſe, and he wyll be ſhortly hole.
            
            
               ¶ The goute without remedy.
               THere be beaſtes, that wyll haue the goute, and moſte commonly in the hynder fete, and it wyll cauſe them to halt, and go ſtarkely. And I knewe neuer manne, that coulde helpe it, or fynde remedye therfore, but all onely to put hym in good graſſe, and fede hym.
            
            
               ¶ To rere calues.
               IT is conueniente for a houſbande to rere calues, and ſpecyally thoſe that come bytwene Candelmaſſe and Maye, for that ſeaſon he may ſpare mylke beſte, and by that

tyme the calfe ſhall be wayned, there wyll be graſſe ynoughe to put hym vnto. And at winter he wyll be bygge ynoughe to ſaue hymſelfe amonge other beaſtes, with a lyttell fauoure. And the damme of the calfe ſhall bull agayne, and brynge an other by the ſame time of the yere: and if thou ſhalt tary, tyll after May, the calfe wolde be weyke in wynter, and the damme wolde not bull agayne: but ofte tyme go barryn And if thou ſhalte rere a calfe, that commeth after Myghelmaſſe, it wyll be coſtly to kepe the calfe all the wynter ſeaſon at hey, and the damme at harde meate in the houſe, as they vſe in the playne champyon countrey. And a cowe ſhall gyue more mylke with a lyttell graſſe and ſtrawe, lyenge without in a cloſe, thanne ſhe ſhall doo with hey and ſtrawe, lyenge in an houſe. for the harde meate dryeth vp the mylke. But he that hath no paſture, muſte do as he may, but yet is it better to the houſ bande, to ſell thoſe calues, than to rere them, bycauſe of the coſt, and alſo for the profytte of the mylke to his houſe, and the rather the cowe wyll take the bull. If the huſbande go with an oxe plough, it is conuenient, that he rere two oxe calues, and two cowe calues at the leaſt, to vpholde his ſtocke, and if he maye do moo, it wyll be

more profyte. And it is better, to wayne thy calues at graſſe before. And that man, that maye haue a paſture for his kye, and an other for his calues, and water in them both, maye rere and brede good beaſtes with lyghte coſte. And if thou waine thy calues with hey, it wyl make them haue great belyes, and the rather they wyll rotte, whan they come to graſſe, and in wynter they wolde be put in a houſe by them ſelfe, and gyuen hey on the nyghtes, and put in a good paſture on the day, and they ſhal be moche better to handell, whan they ſhal be kye or oxen.
            
            
               ☞ To gelde calues.
               IT is tyme to gelde his oxen calues in the olde of the mone, whan they be. x. or. xx. dayes olde, for than it is leaſte ieoperdye, and the oxe ſhall be the more hyer, and the lenger of body, and the lēger horned: and that maye be well prouyd, to take two oxe calues, bothe of one kynde, of one makynge, and both of one age, gelde one of them, and let the other goo forthe and be a bull, and put theym bothe in one paſture, tyll they be foure or fyue yere olde: and than ſhall ye ſe the oxe calfe, ferre greatter euery waye, than the bull. there

is noo cauſe, but the geldynge. and yf thou gelde them not, tyll they be a yere olde, there is more ieopardye, he ſhall be leſſe of bodye, and ſhorte horned.
            
            
               ¶ Horſes and mares to drawe.
               A Huſbande maye not be withoute horſes and mares, or bothe, and ſpecially if he go with a horſe ploughe he muſte haue both his horſes to drawe, and his mares to brynge coltes, to vpholde his ſtocke, and yet at manye tymes they maye drawe well, if they be well handled. But they maye not beare ſackes, nor be rydden vppon noo iourneys, whan they be with foole, and ſpecyally whanne they haue gone with foole. xx. or. xxiiii. wekes, for than is the greatteſte ieopardy. For yf ſhe be rydden vppon, and ſette vp hotte or tourned out and take cold; ſhe wil caſte her foole, the whiche woll be a greatte loſſe to the houſbande. For ſhe wyll labour, and beare whan ſhe hath fooled, and drawe whan ſhe is with foole, as well as the horſe. It is conuenient for the huſbande to knowe, whanne his mare wolde be horſed. It is the

common ſayenge, that ſhe wyll take the hors within. ix. or. x. dayes, nexte after that ſhe hath fooled: but that ſaying I holde not with, for and ſhe ſo do, ſhe wyll not holde therto, for the hors dothe dryue her to it. But. xx. days after, is tymely ynoughe to brynge her to a hors for ſhe wyl not holde to it, excepte ſhe be kene of horſyng, and that ſhal ye knowe by her ſhap, for that wyll twyrle open, and cloſe agayne many tymes in an houre: and than brynge her to a hors, and let her be with hym a day or a nyght, and that is ſuffycyent. For it is better, to kepe the horſe frome the mares, than to go with them, for dyuers cauſes, and ſpecyally he ſhall be more luſty, and the moo horſe coltes ſhall he gete. But he that hath very many mares, maye not alway attende them, but let them go to gether, and take as god ſendes it. Some men holde an opinion, that if the horſe be put to the mare in the begynnynge of the moone, after it be prime, he ſhall gete a horſe foole. And ſome men ſaye the contrary: that if he be putte to the mare in the olde of the mone, he ſhoulde gete horſe fooles. And I ſaye, it maketh noo matter, whether: for this cauſe I haue proued. I haue my ſelfe. lx. mares and more, able to beare the horſe, and from Maye daye

vnto ſaynte Barthylmewes daye. I haue. v. or. vi. horſes goynge with theym bothe daye and nyghte, and at the foolynge tyme I haue vpon one daye a horſe fole, and on the nexte day, or ſeconde, a mare fole, and on the thirde or fourth day next after, a horſe fole agayne, and ſoo euery weke of bothe ſortes, and by theyr opynyon or reaſon, I ſhulde haue. xiiii. dayes together horſe fooles, and other. xiiii. dayes together mare foles. And me ſemethe, that thoſe men, that holde that opinyon, ſpeke ſophyſtycallye, that if ſoo be, they layde any wagers thervppon, that they ſhoulde bothe wynne in theyr owne conceyte by this reaſon. Whether it were gette in the newe of the mone or in the olde of the mone, it is a horſe foole, bycauſe a horſe gate it, though it be a felly fole and it is a mare fole, bycauſe a mare fooled it, thoughe it be a horſe colte. And ſo (Diuerſis reſpectibus) theyr opynions maye be trewe. But of one thynge I am certayne, that ſome one horſe wyll gette more horſe fooles, than other horſe wyll doo and lyke wyſe, a mare wyll beare moo mare fooles than ſome other mare wyll do, thoughe they be horſed bothe with one horſe. Me ſemeth there is no reaſon why, but the luſtynes of the nature of bothe partes, whether of them, ſhall haue the domination.

But and ye haue mares of dyuers colours, than do as I do, ſeuer them in diuers parcels, and put to your white mares, a grey horſe, or a whyte horſe, that hath noo whyte rathe in the foreheed, and to your grey mares a white horſe, ſo that he be not al white ſkynned aboute the mouthe. And to your mares of colour, that haue no white vpon them, a coloured horſe, that hath moch white on hym, and to your coloured mares of mayne whyte, a horſe of colour of mayn whyte. And thus ſhal ye haue well coloured coltes. It maketh noo mater, of what colour the horſe be, ſoo he be neyther whyte nor grey. For if ye put a whyte horſe to a coloured mare, ſhe ſhall haue moſte comonly a ſandy colte, lyke an yren grey, neyther lyke ſyre nor damme. Howe be it I haue ſeen and knowen many mares, that wyl haue theyr colte lyke the horſe that gate it, the whiche is agaynſte kynde of mares, for a manne maye rather gette one good horſe, than many good mares.
            
            
               ☞ The loſſe of a lambe, a calfe, or a foole.
               IT is leſſe hurte to a man, to haue his cowe caſte her calfe, thanne an ewe to caſte her lambe. For the calfe wyll ſoucke as moche

mylke, er it be able to kyll, as it is worthe, and of the ewe commeth noo profytte of the mylke, but the lambe. Howe be it they vſe in ſome places to mylke theyr ewes, whan they haue wayned theyr lambes: but that is great hurte to the ewes, and wyll cauſe them, that they wyll not take the ramme at the tyme of the yere for pouertye, but goo barreyne. And if a mare caſte her foole, that is thryſe ſoo great a loſſe, for if that foole be commen of good brede, as it is neceſſary euery man to prouyde, for as moche coſtes and charges hath a badde mare as a good, in ſhorte ſpace the foole, with good kepynge, maye be ſolde for as moche money as wolde bye many calues and lambes.
            
            
               ¶ What cattell ſhulde go to gether in one paſture.
               BEaſtes alone, nor horſes aloone, nor ſhepe alone, excepte it be ſhepe vppon a verye hyghe grounde, wyll not eate a paſture euen, but leaue many tuftes and hygh graſſe in dyuers places, excepte it be ouer layde with cattell. Wherfore knowe that horſes and beaſtes wyll agree well in oone paſture, for there is ſome maner of graſſe, that

or horſe wyll eate, and the beaſt wyl not eate, as the fytches, flaſſhes, and lowe places, and all the holowe bunnes and pypes that growe therin. But horſes and ſhepe wyll not ſo well agree, excepte it be ſhepe to fede, for a ſhepe wyll go on a bare paſture, and wyll eate the ſweteſte graſſe: and ſoo wyll a horſe, but he wolde haue it lenger. Howe be it he wyll eate as nyghe the erthe as a ſhepe, but he can not ſo ſone fyll his belly. To an hundred beaſtes ye maye put. xx. horſes, if it be lowe ground, and if there be graſſe ynoughe, put in an hundred ſhepe, and ſo after the rate, be the paſture more or leſſe. And after this maner they may fede and eate the cloſe euen, and leue but fewe tuftes. And if it be an hyghe grounde, put in moo ſhepe, and leſſe beſtes and horſes Melch kye, and draught oxen, wyll eate a cloſe moche barer than as many fatte kye and oxen. And a melche cowe may haue to moch meate: for if ſhe waxe fatte, ſhe wyll the rather take the bull, and gyue leſſe mylke. lor the fatnes ſtoppeth the poores and the vaines, that ſhuld brynge the mylke to the pappes And therfore meane graſſe is beſte to kepe her in a meane eſtate. And if a cowe be fatte, whan ſhe ſhall calue, than is there great ieoperdy in her, and the calfe ſhall be the leſſe: but ye can not gyue

your draught oxe to moche meate, excepte it be the aftermath, of a late mowen medow e. for that wyll cauſe hym to haue the gyrre, and than he maye not well laboure. And there be to moche graſſe in a cloſe, the cattel ſhall fede the worſe, for a good bytte to the erthe is ſuffycyente. for if it be longe, the beaſte wyll byte of the toppe and noo more, for that is ſweteſt, and the other lyeth ſtyll vppon the grounde, and rotteth, and no beaſte wyll eate it but horſe in wynter, but theſe beaſtes, horſes and ſhepe, maye not be fodered to gether in wynter, for thanne they wolde be ſeuered: for els the beaſtes with theyr hornes, wyll put bothe the horſes and the ſhepe, and gore them in theyr bellyes. And it is neceſſarye to make ſtandynge cratches, to caſte theyr fodder in, and the ſtaues ſet nyghe ynough togyther, for pullynge theyr fodder to haſtely out, for ſhedynge. And if it be layde vppon the erthe, the fourthe parte therof wyll be loſte: and if ye laye it vpon the erthe, laye it euerye tyme in a newe place, for the olde wyll marre the newe.

               ☞ Of bees.
               OF bees is lyttell charge, but good attendaunce at the tyme that they ſhall caſt the ſwarme, it is conuenient, that the hyue be ſet in a garden, or an orchyarde, where as they maye be kepte from the northe wynde, and the mouthe of the hyue towarde the ſonne And in Iune and Iuly, they do moſt commonlye caſte, and they wolde haue ſome lowe trees nyghe vnto them before the hyue that the ſwarme maye lyght vpon, and whan the ſwarme is knytte, take a hyue, and ſplente it within with thre or foure ſplentes, that the bees maye knytte theyr comōes therto, and annoynte the ſplentes, and the ſydes of the hyue, with a lyttell honye. And if thou haue no honye, take ſwete creame, and than ſet a ſtole or a forme nyghe vnto the ſwarme, and laye a clene waſhen ſhete vppon the ſtole, and thanne holde the ſmalle ende of the hyue

downewarde, and ſhake the bees in to the hyue, and ſhortely ſette it vppon the ſtole, and turne vppe the corners of the ſhete ouer the hyue, and to leue one place open, that the bees may come in and out: but thou mayſt not fight nor ſtryue with theym for noo cauſe, and to laye nettyls vppon the bowes, where as they were knytte, to dryue them from that place, and ſoo watche them all that daye, that they go not away, and at nyght, whan al be goone vp into the hyue, take it away and ſet it where it ſhall ſtande, and take awaye thy ſhete, and haue claye tempered to laye aboute it vppon the borde or ſtone, where it ſhall ſtande, that noo wynde comme in, but the borde is better and warmer. And to leaue an hole open on the ſouth ſyde, of three inches brode, and an inche of heyghte, for the bees to come in and out. And than to make a couerynge of wheate ſtrawe or rye ſtrawe, to couer and houſe the hyue about, and ſet the hyue two fote or more from the erthe vpon ſtakes, ſoo that a mouſe can not come to it, and alſo neyther beaſtes nor ſwyne. And if a ſwarme be caſte late in the yere, they wolde be fedde with honnye in wynter, and layde vppon a thynne narowe borde, or a thynne ſclatte or leade, put it into the hyue, and an other thynne borde wolde be

And that hyue, that is fedde, to ſtoppe the mouthe cleane, that other bees come not in, for if they doo, they wyll fyghte, and kyll eche other. And beware, that noo waſpes come in to the hyue, for they wyllkyl the bees, and eate the honny. And alſo there is a bee called a drone, and ſhe is greatter than an other bee, and they wyll eate the honny, and gather nothynge: and therfore they wolde be kylde, and it is a ſayenge, that ſhe hath loſte her ſtynge, and than ſhe wyl not labour as the other do.

in wynter tyme, whan they ſhall be fodered. And thoughe a man be but a farmer, and ſhall haue his farme xx yeres, it is leſſe coſte for hym, and more profyte to quyckeſet, dyche, and hedge, than to haue his cattel goo before the herdeman For let the houſbande ſpende in thre yeees as moche money as the kepynge of his beaſtes, ſwyne, and ſhepe, doth coſt him in iii yeres, than alwaye after, he ſhal haue all maner of cattell with the tenthe parte of the coſte, and the beaſtes ſhal lyke moche better. And by this reaſon. The herdeman wyll haue for euery beaſt. ii. d. a quarter, or there aboute: And the ſwyneherde wyll haue for euery ſwyne. i. d. at the leaſte. Than he muſt haue a ſhepeherde of his owne, or elles he ſhal neuer thryue. Than reken meate, drinke, and wages for his ſhepeherde, the herdmans hyre, and the ſwyneherdes hyre, theſe charges wyll double his rent or nyghe it, excepte his farme be aboue. xl. s. by yere. Nowe ſee what his charges be, in. iii. yeres, lette hym ware as moche money in quickeſettynge, dythynge, and hedgynge, and in thre yeres he ſhall be diſcharged for euermore, and moche of this labour he and his ſeruauntes maye do with theyr owne handes, and ſaue moche money. And than hath he euery fyelde in ſeueraltye.

And by the aſſente of the lordes and the tenauntes, euery neyghbour may exchaunge landes with other. And than ſhall his farme be twyſe ſo good in profytte to the tenaunte as it was before, and as moche lande kepte in tyllage, and than ſhall not the ryche man ouer eate the poore man with his cattell, and the fourth parte of heye and ſtrawe ſhall ſerue his cattel better in a paſture, than. iiii. tymes ſoo moche wyll do in a houſe, and leſſe attendaunce, and better the cattel ſhall lyke, and the chiefe ſauegarde for corne bothe daye and nyghte that can be.

And if thou dwelle in the playne countrey, than mayſte thou gete bothe aſſhe, oke, and elme, for thoſe wyll encreaſe moche woode in ſhorte ſpace. And ſet thy oke ſettes and the aſſhe. x. or. xii. fote a ſonder, and cut them as thou doſt thy other

And alſo wede them clene in mydſomer mone or ſoone after: for the wedes, if they ouer growe, wyl kyl the ſettes. But get no blacke thorne for nothynge, for that wyl grow outwarde into the paſture, and doth moch hurte in the graſſe, and tearyng the woll of the ſhepe. It is good tyme to ſe quickeſettes, fro that tyme the leaues be fallen, vnto oure lady daye in lente, and thy ſandye grounde or grauell ſet fyrſte, than clay grounde, and than meane grounde, and the medowe or marreys grounde laſte, for the ſande, and grauell wyll drye anone, and than the quyckeſet wyll take no rote, except it haue greate weate, for the muldes wyll lye loſe, if it be dyched in February or marche, and lyke wiſe clay ground And make thy ſettes longe ynough, that they maye be ſet depe ynough in the erth, for than they wyll growe the better. And to ſtande halfe a foote and more aboue the erthe, that they maye ſprynge oute in many braunches. And than to take a lyne, and ſette it there as thou wylte haue thy hedge, and to make a trenche after thy lyne, and to pare awaye the graſſe there the quyckeſettes ſhal be ſet, and caſte it by, where the erthe of the dyche ſhall

And lay thy ſmall trouſe or thornes, that thou hedgeſte withall, ouer thy quickeſettes, that ſhepe do not eate the ſprynge nor buddes of thy ſettes. Let thy ſtakes be well dryuen, that the poynt take the hard erthe. And whan thou haſte made thy hedge, and eddered it well, than take thy mall agayne, and dryue downe thy edderinges, and alſo thy ſtakes by and by. For with the wyndynge of the edderynges thou dooſt leuſe thy ſtakes, and therfore they muſte nedes be dryuen newe, and hardened agayne, and the better the ſtake wil be dryuen, whan he is wel bounden.

And if the hedge be of. xx. xxiiii. or. xxx. yere of age, ſythe it was fyrſt ſette, than wynde in firſt al the nethermoſte bowes, and wynde them together, and than cutte the ſettes in a playne place, a lyttel from the erth, the more halfe a ſonder, and to lette it ſlaue downewarde, and not vpwarde, for dyuerſe cauſes: than wynde the bowes and braunches therof in to the hedge, and at euery two fote. or. iii. fote to leaue one ſet growyng not plaſſhed, and the toppe to be cut of foure fote hygh. or there aboute, to ſtande as a ſtake, if there be any ſuche, or els to ſet an other, and to wynd the other that be pl

And if the bowes, wyll not lye playne in the hedge, than cut it the more halfe a ſonder, and bynd it to the hedge, and than ſhal he not nede for to mende the hedge, but in fewe places, xx. yeres after or more. And if the hedge be olde, and be great ſtubbes or trees, and thyn in the bottome, that beaſtes may go vnder, or betwene the trees: thanne take a ſharpe axe, and cutte the trees or ſtubbes, that growe a

And if all the holowe and voyde places wyl not be fylled and ſtopped, than ſcoure the old dyche, and caſt it vp newe, and to fyll with erthe al the voyde places. And if ſoo be theſe trees wyll not reche in euerye place, to make a ſufficyent defence, than double quicke ſet it, &amp; diche it new in euery place, that is nede ful, &amp; ſet a hedge thervpon, and to ouerlay the ſettes, for eatynge of ſhepe or other cattel.
            
            
               ¶ To mende a hye waye.
               ME ſemeth, it is neceſſarye to ſhewe mine opinion, howe an hye way ſhulde be amended. And fyrſte and pryncypally, ſee that there be noo water ſtandynge in the hye waye, but that it be alwaye currante and rennynge, nor haue none abydynge more in one place thanne in an other. And in ſomer, whan the water is dryed vp, than to get grauell, and to fyll vp euery lowe place, and to make theym euen, ſomewhat dyſcendynge

or currante, one waye or other, and if there be noo grauell, nor ſtones to gette, yet fyll it vp with erthe in the begynnynge of ſomer, that it maye be well hardened with caryage and treadynge vppon, and it ſhall be well amended, if the water maye paſſe away from it, the whiche wolde be well conſydered, and ſpecially aboute London, where as they make moche more coſte than nedeth, for there they dyche theyr hye wayes on bothe ſydes, and fyll vp the holowe and lowe places with erthe, and than they caſte and laye grauell a lofte. And whan a greatte rayne or water commeth, and ſynketh thorowe the grauell, and commeth to the erthe, than the erthe ſwelleth and bolneth, and waxeth ſofte, and with treadynge, and ſpecyally with caryage, the grauell ſynketh, and gothe downewarde as his nature and kynde requyreth, and than it is in maner of a quycke ſande, that harde it is for any thynge to goo ouer. But yf they wolde make no dyche in ſommertyme, whan the warer is dryed vp, that a man may ſe all the holowe and lowe places, than to cary grauel, and fyl it vp as hygh as the other knolles be, than wold it not bolne ne ſwell, nor be no quycke ſande, and euery mā may go beſide the hie way with theyr cariage at theyr pleaſure.

And this me ſemeth is leſſe coſte, and lenger wyll laſt with a lyttell mendynge whan nede requyreth. Therfore me thynketh, yf this were well loked vpon, it ſhuld be bothe good and neceſſarye for that purpoſe: for ſoo haue I ſeen done in other places, where as I haue ben. &amp;c.
            
            
               ¶ To remoue and ſet trees.
               IF thou wylte remoue and ſette trees, get as manye rotes with them as thou canſte, and breake them not, nor bryſe theym, by thy wyll. And if there be any rote broken and ſore bruſed, cut it of harde by, there as it is bruſed, with a ſharpe hatchet, elles that roote wyll dye. And if it be aſſhe, elme, or oke, cut of all the bowes cleane, and ſaue the toppe hole. For if thou make hym ryche of bowes, thou makeſte hym poore of thryfte, for two cauſes. The bowes cauſeth theym to ſhake with wynde, and to leuſe the rotes. Alſo he can not be ſoo cleane gete, but ſome of the rotes muſte nedes be cut, and than there wyll not come ſoo moche ſappe and moyſtenes to the bowes, as there dyd before. And if the tree be very longe, cut of the top, two or thre yardes. And if it be an apple tree, or peare

tree, or ſuche other as beareth fruyte, than cut away all the water bowes, and the ſmall bowes, that the pryncipall bowes, may haue the more ſap. And if ye make a marke, which ſyde of the tree ſtandeth towarde the ſonne, that he may be ſet ſo agayne, it is ſoo moche the better.
            
            
               ¶ Trees to be ſet without rotes and growe.
               THere be trees wil be ſet without rotes, and growe well, and ſprynge rotes of them ſelfe. And thoſe be dyuerſe apple trees, that haue knottes in the bowes, as caſſes, or wydes, and ſuche other, that wyll growe on ſlauynges, and lykewyſe popeler and wethy: and they muſt be cut cleane beſyde the tree, that they growe on, and the toppe cut. cleane of. viii. or. x. fote of lengthe, and all the bowes betwene, and to be ſet a fote depe or more in the erthe, in good grounde. And ye ſhall vnderſtande, that there be foure maner of wethyes, that is to ſay, white wethye, blacke wethy, reed wethy, and oſyerde wethy. Whyte wethye wyll growe vppon drye grounde, yf it be ſette in the begynnynge of wynter, and wyll not growe in marſſhe

grounde. blacke wethy wyll growe better on marſhe grounde, and redde wethy in lyke maner: and oſyerde wethy wyll growe beſte in water and moyſte grounde. And they be trees that wyll ſoone be nouryſſhed, and they wyll beare moche woodde, and they wolde be cropped euery vii or. viii yere, orels they wyll dye, but they maye not be cropped in ſappe tyme, nor no tree els. And in many places, bothe the lordes, freeholders, and tenauntes at wyll, ſette ſuche wethyes, and popelers, in marſſhe grounde, to nouryſſhe wodde. &amp;c.
            
            
               ¶ To fell wodde for houſholde, or to ſell.
               IF thou haue any woddes to felle, for thy houſeholde to brenne or to ſell, than fell the vnder wodde fyrſte in wynter, that thy cattell or beaſtes maye eate and brouſe the toppes, and to fell noo more on a daye but as moche as the beaſtes wyll eate the ſame daye, or on the morowe after. And as ſoone as it is well eaten or brouſed, thanne kydde it, and ſet them on the endes, and that wyll ſaue the bandes from rottynge, and they ſhall be the lyghter to carye, and the better wyll

And whan thou ſhalt bryng them home to make a ſtacke of them, ſet the nethermoſte courſe vpon the endes, and the ſeconde courſe flat vppon the ſyde, and the endes vpwarde, and the thyrde couſe flatte on the ſyde ouerthwart the other. And ſo to peruſe them, tyll thou haue layd all vp. And whan thou ſhalte brenne them, take the ouermoſte fyrſte.
            
            
               ¶ To ſhrede, lop or croppe trees.
               IF thou haue any trees to ſhrede, loppe, or croppe for the fyre wodde, croppe them in wynter, that thy beaſtes maye eate the brouſe, and the moſſe of the bowes, and alſo the yues, And whanne they be brouſed and eaten, dreſſe the wodde, and bowe it clene, and cutte it at euery byghte, and rere the greatte wodde to the tree, and kydde the ſmal bowes, and ſet them on ende. And if thou ſhalte not haue ſufficyent wodde, excepte thou heed thy trees, and cut of the toppes, than heed theym thre or foure fote aboue any tymber: and if it be noo tymbre tree, but a ſhaken tree, or a hedge rote full of knottes, thanne heed hym thyrty foote hyghe, or twenty at the leaſte,

for ſoo ferre he wyll beare plentye of woode and bowes, and moche more, thanne if he were not heeded. For a tree hath a propertye, to growe to a certayne heyght, and whan he commeth to that heyghte, he ſtandeth ſtyll, and groweth noo hyer, but in brede: and in concluſion, the toppe wyll dye and decreaſe, and the body thryue. And if a tree be heeded, and vſed to be lopped and cropped at euerye xii or. xvi. yeres ende, or there about, it wyll beare moche more woode, by proceſſe of time, than if it were not cropped, and moche more profyte to the owner.
            
            
               ¶ Howe a man ſhulde ſhrede, loppe, or croppe trees.
               IT is the comon gyſe, to begynne at the top of the tree, whan he ſhall be ſhred or cropped, bycauſe eche bough ſhulde lye vppon other, whan they ſhall fal ſo that the weight of the bowes ſhall cauſe theym to be the rather cut downe. But that is not beſte, for that cauſeth the bowes to ſlaue downe the nether parte, and pulleth awaye the barke from the bodye of the tree, the whiche wyll cauſe the tree to be holowe in that place in tyme commynge, and many tymes it ſhall hynder hym.

And therfore lette hym begynne at the nethermoſte boughe fyrſte, and with a lyghte axe for an hande, to cut the boughe on bothe ſydes, a foote or two foote from the bodye of the tree. And ſpecially cut it more on the nether ſyde, than on the ouer ſyde, ſoo that the boughe fall not ſtreyght downe, but turne on the ſyde, and than ſhall it not ſlaue nor breke no barke. And euery boughe wil haue a newe heed, and beare moche more woode. and by thy wyll, without thou muſt nedes do it, crop not thy tree, nor ſpecyallye heed hym, whan the wynde ſtandeth in the northe, or in the eeſt. And beware, that thou croppe hym not, nor heed hym (ſpecially) in ſappe tyme, for than wyll he dye within fewe yeres after, if it be an oke.
            
            
               ¶ To ſell woode or tymber.
               IF thou haue any woode to ſelle, I aduyſe the, retayle it thy ſelfe, if thou mayſte attende vppon it: and if not, thanne to cauſe thy baylye, or ſomme other wyſe or dyſcrete man, to do it for the. And if it be ſmall wode, to kydde it, and ſel it by the hundredes, or by the thouſandes. And if there be aſſhes in it, to ſell the ſmalle aſſhes to cowpers for garhes,

and the gret aſſhes to whele wryghtes, and the meane aſſhes to plowe wrightes, and the crabbe trees to myllers, to make cogges, and ronges. And if there be any okes, bothe gret and ſmal, fel them, and pyl them, and ſel the barke by it ſelfe, and than ſorte the trees, the polles by them ſelfe, the myddel ſhorte by them ſelfe, and the greatteſt by them ſelfe, &amp; than ſel them by ſcores, or halfe ſcores, or. C. as thou maiſt, and to fel it hard by the erth, for i fote next vnto the erth, is worthe. ii. fote in the top, and to cut thy tymber longe ynoughe, that thou leue no timber in the toppe. And to ſell the toppes as they lye a greatte, or elles dreſſe them &amp; ſel the great wodde by it ſelfe, &amp; the kyd wodde by it ſelfe, and to fal the vnder wode fyrſt at any tyme betwene Martilmas and holyrode day And al the aſſhes, bytwene Martylmaſſe and Candelmas, and all okes, as ſoone as they wyl pyl, vntyl May be done, and not after. Perauenture the greatteſt man hath not the beſte prouiſyon. And that is bycauſe the ſeruauntes wyll not enfourme hym theſe wayes, and alſo may fortune they wold bye ſuche woodes theym ſelfe, or be partener of the ſame, and to auyſe his lorde to ſel them. It is not cōuenient, that the ſaleſman, that ſelleth the wod, ſhuld be partener with the bier.
            
            
               
               ¶ To kepe ſprynge wodde.
               IN the wynter before that thou wilt fel thy wodde, make a good and a ſure hedge▪ that no maner of cattel can get in. And as ſhortly as it is fallen, let it be caryed away, or the ſprynge come vp, for els the cattell, that doth cary the wodde, wyll eate the ſprynge: and whan the top is eaten, or broken, it is a great lette, hurte, and hynderaunce of the goodnes of the ſprynge, for than where it is eaten, it burges oute of many braunches, and not ſoo fayre as the fyrſt wolde haue ben. A parke is beſt kept, whan there is neyther man, dogge, nor foure foted beaſt therin, except dere. And ſo is a ſpryng beſte kepte, where there is neyther manne nor foure foted beaſtes within the hedge. But if there be moche graſſe, and thou were lothe to loſe it, than put in calues, newly wained and taken from theyr dammes, and alſo waynynge coltes, or horſes not paſte a yere of age: and let thy calues be taken away at Maye, the coltes may go lenger, for eating of any wodde, but there is ieoperdy bothe for calues, foles, and coltes, for tyckes, or for beinge lowſy, the whiche wyl kyl them, if they be not taken hede vnto. And vii yeres is the leſt, that it wil ſaue it ſelfe, but. x yeres is beſt.

And than the vnder bowes wolde be cutte awaye, and made kyddes therof, and the other wyll growe moche the better and faſter. And if the vnder bowes be not cutte awaye, they wyll dye, and than they be loſte, and greatte hurte to the ſprynge, for they take awaye the ſappe, that ſhoulde cauſe the ſprynge to growe better.

And alſo cheryes, filberdes, bulleys, dampſons, plummes, walnuttes, and ſuche other. And therfore it is conuenyent, to lerne howe than ſhalte graffe. Than it is to be knowen, what thynges thou muſt haue to graffe withall. Thou muſte haue a graffynge ſawe, the whiche wolde be very thynne, and thycke tothed, and bycauſe it is thynne, it wyll cut the narower kyrfe, and the cleaner for bruſynge of the barke. And therfore it is ſette in a compaſſe pece of yren, ſyxe inches of, to make it ſtyffe and bygge. thou muſte haue alſo a graffynge knyfe, an inche brode, with a thycke

And alſo a mallet, to dryue the knyfe and thy wedge in to the tree: and a ſharpe knife, to pare the ſtockes heed, and an other ſharpe knyfe, to cutte the graffe cleane. And alſo thou muſte haue two wedges of harde wood, or elles of yren, a longe ſmall one, for a ſmall ſtocke, and a broder, for a bygger ſtocke, to open the ſtocke, whan it is clouen and pared: and alſo good tough claye and moſſe, and alſo baſtes or pyllynge of wethy or elme, to bynde them with. &amp;c.

               PEares and wardens wolde be graffed before any maner of apples, bycauſe the ſappe commeth ſooner and rather in to the peare tree and warden tree, thanne in to the apple treee. And after ſaynt Valentynes daye, it is tyme to graffe bothe peares and wardens, tyll Marche be comen, and thanne to graffe appels to our lady daye. And than graffe that that is gette of an olde apple tree fyrſte, for that wyll budde before the graffe get of a yonge apple tree late graffed. And a peare or a warden wolde be graffed in a

And therfore thou mayſte not ſette the barkes mete on the vtter ſyde, but on the inner ſyde: than pull awaye thy wedge: and it wyl ſtand moche faſter. Than take toughe cleye, lyke marley, and ley it vppon the ſtocke heed, and with thy fynger laye it cloſe vnto the graffe, and a lyttell vnder the heed, to kepe it moyſt, and that no wynde come into the ſtocke at the cleauynge. Than take moſſe, and laye thervpon, for chynynge of the claye: than take a baſte of whyte wethy or elme, or halfe a bryer, and bynd the moſſe, the clay, and the graffe together, but be well ware, that thou, breake not thy graffe, neyther in the clayenge, nor in the byndynge, and thou muſte ſet ſome thinge by the graffe, that crowes, nor byrdes do not lyght vpon thy graffe. for if they do, they wil breake hym. &amp;c.

Than put the tenaunt of the ponche betwene the barke &amp; the woode of the ſtocke, and pull it out agayne, and put in the graffe, and ſe that it ioyne cloſe, or els mende it.

And yf he canne not wryte, lette hym nycke the defautes vppon a ſtycke, and to ſhewe his bayely, as I ſayde before. Alſo take hede bothe erly and late, at all tymes, what maner of people reſorte and comme to thy houſe, and the cauſe of theyr commynge, and ſpecially if they brynge with them pytchers, cannes, tancardes, bottelles, bagges, wallettes, or buſſhell pokes. For if thy ſeruauntes be not true, they maye doo the great hurte, and them ſelfe lyttel auauntage. Wherfore they wolde be well loked vopon. And he that hath. ii. true ſeruauntes, a man ſeruaunte, and an other a woman ſeruaunte,

he hath a great treaſure, for a trewe ſeruaunte wyl do iuſtly hym ſelfe, and if he ſe his felowes do amyſſe, he wyl byd them do no more ſo, for if they do, he wyll ſhewe his maſter therof: and if he do not this, he is not a trewe ſeruaunt.

               ¶ A prologue for the wyues occupation.
               
                  
NOwe thou huſbande, that haſte doone thy dylygence and labour, that longeth to an huſbande, to get thy lyuynge, thy wyues, thy chyldrens, and thy ſeruauntes: yet are there other thynges, that muſte nedes be done, or elles thou ſhalte not thryue. For there is an olde common ſayenge, that ſeldom doth the houſbande thryue, withoute the leue of his wyfe. By this ſayenge it ſhoulde ſeme, that there be other occupations and labours, that be moſte conuenient for the wyues to do. And howe be it that I haue not the experyence of al theyr occupations and warkes, as I haue of huſbandry, Yet a lyttell wyl I ſpeke, what they ought to do, though I tel them nat howe they ſhulde doo, and exercyſe theyr labours and occupations.
            
            
               ¶ A leſſon for the wyfe.
               BVt yet er I begynne to ſhewe the wyfe, what warkes ſhe ſhall do, I wyll firſte teche her a leſſon of Salomon, as I did to her huſbande a leſſon of the philoſopher, and that is, that ſhe ſhulde not be ydle at noo tyme: for Salomon ſaythe, Ocioſus non gaudebit cum electis in caelo: ſed lugebit in aeternum cum reprobis in inferno: That is to ſay, The ydle folke ſhall not ioye with the

choſen folkes in heuen, but they ſhall ſorowe with the reproued and forſaken folkes in hell. And ſaynt Iherom ſaythe: Semper boni operis aliquid facito, vt te diabolus inueniar occupatum: Quia ſicut in aqua ſtante generantur vermes: ſic in homine ocioſo generantur malae cogitationes: That is to ſay Alwaye be doinge of ſome good werkes, that the dyuell may fynde the euer occupied: for as in ſtandynge water are engendred wormes, ryghte ſoo in an ydle body are engendred ydle thoughtes. Here mayſte thou ſe, that of ydelnes commeth damnation, and of good warkes and labour cometh ſaluation. Nowe arte thou at thy lyberty, to choſe whether waye thou wylt, wherin is a great diuerſitie. And he is an vnhappy man or woman, that god hath giuen bothe wyt and reaſon, and putteth hym in choſe, and woll choſe the worſt parte. Nowe thou wyfe, I truſt to ſhewe to the dyuers occupations, warkes, and laboures, that thou ſhalt not nede to be ydle no tyme of the yere.
            
            
               ¶ What thynges the wyfe is bounden of ryght to do.
               FIrſt and pryncypally the wyfe is bounde of ryghte to loue her houſbande, aboue father and mother, and aboue all other

men. For our lorde ſaythe in his goſpell: Relinquet patrem et matrem, et abhaerebit vxori ſuae: A man ſhulde leue father and mother, and drawe to his wyfe: and the ſame wyſe a wyfe, ſhulde do to her huſbande. And are made by the vertue of the ſacrament of holy ſcripture, one fleſhe, one bloude, one body, and two ſoules. wherfore theyr hartes, theyr myndes, theyr warkes, and occupations, ſhulde be all one, neuer to ſeuer nor chaunge, durynge theyr natural lyues, by any mannes acte or dede, as it is ſayde in the ſame goſpel. Quod deus coniunxit, homo non ſeparet: That thynge, that god hath ioyned to gether, noo man maye ſeuer nor departe. Wherfore it is conuenyente, that they loue eche other, as effectually as they wolde doo theyr owne ſelfe. &amp;c.
            
            
               ¶ What warkes a wyfe ſhulde do in generall.
               FIrſt in a mornyng whan thou arte waked, and purpoſeſte to ryſe, lyfte vp thy hande, and bleſſe the, and make a ſygne of the holy croſſe, In nomine patris, et filii, et ſpiritus ſancti. Amen. In the name of the father, the ſonne, and the holy gooſte. And

if thou ſaye a Pater noſter, an Aue, and a Crede, and remember thy maker, thou ſhalte ſpede moche the better. And whan thou arte vp and redy, than firſt ſwepe thy houſe, dreſſe vp thy dyſſheborde, and ſette all thynges in good order within thy houſe: milke thy kye, ſecle thy calues, ſye vp thy mylke, take vppe thy chyldren, and araye theym, and prouyde for thy huſbandes brekefaſte, dynner, ſouper, and for thy chyldren, and ſeruauntes, and take thy parte with theym. And to ordeyne corne and malte to the myll, to bake and brue withall whanne nede is. And meete it to the myll, and fro the myll, and ſe that thou haue thy meaſure agayne beſyde the tolle, or elles the myller dealeth not truely with the, or els thy corne is not drye as it ſhoulde be. Thou muſt make butter, and cheſe whan thou maiſt, ſerue thy ſwyne bothe mornynge and euenynge, and gyue thy poleyn meate in the mornynge, and whan tyme of the yere commeth, thou muſt take hede, howe thy hennes, duckes, and geeſe do ley, and to gather vp theyr egges, and whan they waxe brodye, to ſette them there as noo beaſtes, ſwyne, nor other vermyn hurte them. And thou muſte knowe, that all hole footed fowles wyll ſytte a moneth, and all clouen footed fowles wyll ſytte

but three wekes, excepte a peyhenne, and greatte fowles, as cranes, buſtard
                     •
                  s, and ſuche other. And whan they haue broughte forthe theyr byrdes, to ſee, that they be well kepte from the gleyd, crowes, fullymartes, and other vermynne. And in the begynnynge of Marche, or a lyttell afore, is tyme for a wyfe to make her garden, and to gette as many good ſedes and herbes, as ſhe canne, and ſpecially ſuche as be good for the potte, and to eate: and as ofte as nede ſhall requyre, it muſte be weded, for els the wedes wyl ouergrowe the herbes. And alſo in Marche is tyme to ſowe flaxe and hempe, for I haue harde olde houſwyues ſaye, that better is Marche hurdes, than Apryll flaxe, the reaſon appereth: but howe it ſhulde be ſowen, weded, pulled, repeyled, watred, waſſhen, dryed, beaten, braked, tawed, hecheled, ſpon, wounden, wrapped, and wouen, it nedeth not for me to ſhewe, for they be wiſe ynough, and therof may they make ſhetes, bordclothes towels, ſhertes, ſmockes, and ſuche other neceſſaryes, and therfore let thy dyſtaffe be alwaye redye for a paſtyme, that thou be not ydle. And vndouted a woman can not gette her lyuynge honeſtely with ſpynnynge on the diſtaffe, but it ſtoppeth a gap, and muſte nedes

be had. The bolles of flaxe, whan they be ripeled of, muſt be rideled from the wedes, and made drye with the ſon, to get out the ſedes. Howe be it, one maner of linſede, called loken ſede, wyll not open by the ſon: and therfore, whan they be drye, they muſte be ſore bruſed and broken, the wiues knowe howe, and than winowed and kepte drye, tyll yere tyme come agayn. Thy female hēpe muſt be pulled from the churle hempe, for that beareth no ſede, and thou muſt do by it, as thou dydeſt by the flax. The churle hempe beareth ſede, and beware that byrdes eate it not, as it groweth: the hēp therof is not ſoo good, as the female hempe, but yet it wyll do good ſeruyce. May fortune ſomtime, that thou ſhalt haue ſo many thinges to do, that thou ſhalt not well knowe, where is beſt to begyn. Than take hede, which thing ſhulde be the greatteſt loſſe, if it were not done and in what ſpace it wold be done: than thinke what is the greateſt loſſe, &amp; there begyn. But in caſe that thynge, that is of greateſte loſſe, wyll be longe in doynge, and thou myghteſte do thre or foure other thynges in the meane whyle, thanne loke well, if all theſe thynges were ſette together, whiche of them were the greatteſt loſſe, and if all theſe thynges be of greater loſſe, and may be all done in as ſhorte

ſpace, as the other, than doo thy many thynges fyrſte.
               ¶ It is conuenyente for a houſbande, to haue ſhepe of his owne for many cauſes, and than maye his wife haue part of the woll, to make her huſbande and her ſelfe ſome clothes. And at the leaſte waye, ſhe maye haue the lockes of the ſhepe, eyther to make clothes or blankettes, and couerlettes, or bothe. and if ſhe haue no woll of her owne, ſhe maye take wol to ſpynne of clothe makers, and by that meanes ſhe maye haue a conuenyent lyuynge, and many tymes to do other warkes. It is a wyues occupation, to wynowe all maner of cornes, to make malte, to waſſhe and wrynge, to make heye, ſhere corne, and in time of nede to helpe her huſbande to fyll the mucke wayue or dounge carte, dryue the ploughe, to loode hey, corne, and ſuche other. And to go or ride to the market, to ſel butter, cheſe, mylke, egges, chekyns, capons, hennes, pygges, geſe and all maner of cornes. And alſo to bye all maner of neceſſarye thynges belongynge to houſſholde, and to make a trewe rekenynge and a compte to her houſbande, what ſhe hath receyued, and what what ſhe hath payed. And yf the houſbande go to the market, to bye or ſell, as they ofte do, he than to ſhewe his wife

in lyke maner. For if one of them ſhoulde vſe to deceyue the other, he deceyueth hym ſelfe, and he is not lyke to thryue. and therfore they muſte be trewe eyther to other. I coulde peraduenture ſhewe the houſbandes dyuerſe poyntes, that the wyues deceyue them in: and in lyke maner, howe huſbandes deceyue theyr wyues: but if I ſhulde do ſo, I ſhulde ſhewe mo ſubtyll poyntes of deceypt, than eyther of them knewe of before. and therfore me ſemeth beſte, to holde my peace, leaſt I ſhoulde do as the knyght of the toure dyd, the whiche had many fayre doughters, and of fatherly loue that he oughte to them, he made a boke, to a good entente, that they myghte eſchewe and flee from vyces, and folowe vertues. In the whiche boke he ſhewed, that if they were wowed, moued, or ſtyred by any man, after ſuche a maner as he there ſhewed, that they ſhulde withſtande it. In the whiche boke he ſhewed ſo many wayes, howe a man ſhoulde atteyne to his purpoſe, to brynge a woman to vice, the whiche wayes were ſo naturall, and the wayes to come to theyr purpoſe, were ſoo ſubtylly contryued, and craftely ſhewed, that harde it wold be for any woman to reſyſte or deny theyr deſyre. And by the ſayd boke hath made bothe the men and the women to knowe

more vyces, ſubtyltye, and crafte, than euer they ſhulde haue knowen, if the boke had not ben made: in the whiche boke he named hym ſelfe the knight of the towre. And thus I leue the wyues, to vſe theyr occupations at theyr owne diſcreation.
            
            
               ¶ To kepe meaſure in ſpendynge.
               NOwe thou huſbande and huſwyfe, that haue done your diligence, and cure, accordynge to the fyrſte artycle of the philoſopher, that is to ſaye. Adhibe curam. And alſo haue well remembred the ſayeng of wyſe Salomon, Quod ocioſus non gaudebit cum electis in caelo: ſed lugebit in aeternum cum reprobis in inferno: Thanne ye muſt remembre, obſerue, and kepe in mind, the ſeconde article of the ſayinge of the philoſopher, that is to ſaye. Tene menſuram, That is to ſaye in englyſſhe, holde and kepe meaſure. And accordynge to that fayenge, I lerned two verſes at grammer ſchole, and they be theſe, Qui plus expendit, quam rerum copia tendit: Non admiretur, fi pauper tate grauetur: He that dothe more expende, thanne his goodes wyll extende, meruayle it ſhall not be, thoughe he be greued with pouertee,

And alſo accordynge to that ſayenge ſpeketh ſayncte Paule and ſaythe, Iuxta facultates faciendi ſunt ſumptus, ne longi temporis victum, breuis hora conſumat: That is to ſaye, Ater thy faculty or thy hauoure, make thyne expences, leſte thou ſpende in ſhorte ſpace, that thynge, that thou ſhouldeſt lyue by longe. This texte toucheth euery manne, from the hyeſt degree to the loweſte. wherfore it is neceſſary to euerye manne and womanne to remembre and take good hede there vnto, for to obſerue kepe and folowe the ſame, but bycauſe this texte of ſayncte Paule is in latyn, and huſbandes commonely can but lyttell laten. I fere, leaſte they can not vnderſtande it. And thoughe it were declared ones or twyſe to theym, that they wolde forgette it: Wherfore I ſhall ſhewe to theym a texte in englyſſhe, and that they maye well vnderſtande, and that is this, Eate within thy tedure
            
            
               ¶ To eate within the tedure.
               THou huſbande and huſwife, that intend to folowe the ſayinge of the philoſopher, that is to ſaye, kepe meaſure, you muſte ſpare at the brynke, and not at

the bottom, that is to vnderſtande, in the begynnynge of the yere, ſellynge of thy cornes, or ſpendynge in thy houſe, vnto the tyme that thou haue ſowen agayne thy wynter corne, and thy lente corne, and than ſe what remayneth, to ſerue thy houſe, and of the ouerplus thou mayſte ſell and bye ſuche other neceſſaryes, as thou muſt nedes occupie. And if thou ſpende it in the begynnynge of the yere, and ſhall want in the hynder ende, than thou doſte not eate within thy tedure, and at the laſte thou ſhalte be punyſhed, as I ſhal proue the by enſample. Take thy horſe, and go tedure him vpon thyne owne lees, flytte hym, as ofte as thou wylte, no manne wyll ſaye wronge thou doſte, but make thy horſe to longe a tedure, that whan thou haſte tyed hym vppon thyne owne lees, his tedure is ſo longe, that it recheth to the middes of an other mans lees or corne: Nowe haſte thou gyuen hym to moche lybertye, and that man, whoſe corne or graſſe thy horſe hath eaten, wyll be greued at the, and wyll cauſe the to be amerced in the court, or elles to make hym amendes, or bothe. And if thy horſe breake his tedure, and go at large in euery mans corne and graſſe, than commeth the pynder, and taketh hym, and putteth hym in the pynfolde, and there ſhall he ſtande in

priſon, without any meate, vnto the tyme thou haſt payde his raunſome to the pynder, and alſo make amendes to thy neyghbours, for diſtroyenge of theyr corne. Ryght ſo, as long as thou eateſt within thy tedure, that thou nedeſt not to begge nor borowe of noo man, ſoo longe ſhalte thou encreaſe and growe in rycheſſe, and euery man wyll be content with the. And if thou make thy tedure to longe, that thyne owne porcyon wyll not ſerue the, but that thou ſhalte begge, borowe, or bye of other: that wyll not longe endure, but thou ſhalte fall in to pouertye. And if thou breake thy tedure, and ren ryot at large, and knowe not other mennes goodes frome thyne owne, than ſhall the pynder, that is to ſaye, the ſheryffe and the bayly areſte the, and putte the in the pynfolde, that is to ſay, in priſon, there to abyde tyll the truth be knowen: and it is mer

                  ayle, if thou ſcape with thy lyfe, and therfore eate within thy tedure.
            
            
               ¶ A ſhorte leſſon for the huſbande.
               ONe thinge I wyl aduiſe the to remembre, and ſpecially in wynter tyme, wh
                     •
                   thou ſytteſte by the fyre, and haſt ſupped, to conſyder in thy mynde, whether the

warkes, that thou, thy wyfe, &amp; thy ſeruauntes ſhall do, be more auauntage to the, than the fyre, and candell lyghte, meate and drynke that they ſhall ſpende, and if it be more auantage, than ſyt ſtyll: and if it be not, than go to thy bedde and ſlepe, and be vppe betyme, and breake thy faſte before day, that thou mayſte be all the ſhorte wynters day about thy buſynes. At grammer ſcole I lerned a verſe, that is this, Sanat, ſanctificat, et ditat ſurgere mane. That is to ſay, Erly ryſyng maketh a man hole in body, holer in ſoule, and rycher in goodes. And this me ſemeth ſhuld be ſufficiēt inſtruction for the huſbande to kepe meaſure.
            
            
               ¶ Howe men of hye degree do kepe meaſure.
               TO me it is doubtefull, but yet me ſemeth, they be rather to lyberall in expences, than to ſcarce, and ſpecyally in three thynges. The fyrſte is prodigalytie in outragious and coſtely aray, fer aboue meaſure: the ſeconde thynge is coſtely charge of delycyous meates and drynkes: the thyrde is outragious playe and game, ferre aboue meaſure. And nowe to the fyrſte poynte.
            
            
               
               ¶ Prodigalite in outragious and coſtely aray.
               I Haue ſeen bokes of accompte of the yomen of the wardropes of noble men, and alſo inuētorys made after theyr deceaſe of their apparell, and I doubte not, but at this daye, it is. xx. tymes more in value, than it was to ſuche a man of degree as he was an. C. yere a go: and many tymes it is gyuen away, er it be halfe worne, to a ſymple man, the whiche cauſeth hym to weare the ſame: and an other ſymple man, or a lyttell better, ſeynge him to weare ſuche rayment, thynketh in his mynde, that he maye were as good rayment as he, and ſo cauſeth hym to bye ſuche other, to his great coſte and charge, aboue meaſure, and an yll enſample to all other. and alſo to ſee mens ſeruantes ſo abuſed in theyr aray, theyr cotes be ſo ſyde, that they be fayne to tucke them vp whan they ryde, as women do theyr kyrtels whan they go to the market or other places, the whiche is an vnconuenient ſyght. And ferthermore, they haue ſuche pleytes vpon theyr breſtes, and ruffes vppon theyr ſleues, aboue theyr elbowes, that yf theyr mayſter, or theym ſelfe hadde neuer ſo greatte nede, they coude not ſhoote one ſhote, to hurte theyr ennemyes, tyll they hadde caſte of theyr cotes,

or cut of theyr ſleues. This is fer aboue meaſure, or common weale of the realme. This began fyrſte with honour, worſhip, and honeſty, and it endeth in pryde, preſumption, and pouertye. Wherof ſpeketh ſaint Auſtin, Quē
                     cunque ſuperbum eſſe videris, diaboli filiū eſſe ne dubites: That is to ſay, who ſo euer thou ſeeſt, that is proude, dout the not, but he is the diuels chylde. Wherfore agaynſt pryde he byddeth the remembre, Quid fuiſti, quid es, et qualis poſt mortem eris: That is to ſay, what thou were, what thou art, and what thou ſhalte be after thy death. And S. Bernarde ſaythe, Homo nihil aliud eſt, q ſperma fetidum, ſaccus ſtercorum, et eſca vermium: That is to ſaye, A man is nothynge, but ſtynkynge fylthe, a ſacke of dounge, and wormes meate. The whiche ſayinges wolde be remēbred, and than me ſemeth this is ſufficient at this time for the firſt point of the thre.
            
            
               ¶ Of delycyouſe meates and drynkes.
               HOwe coſtely are the charges of delycious meates &amp; drynkes, that be nowe moſt commonly vſed, ouer that it hath ben in tymes paſte, and howe fer aboue meaſure?

For I haue ſeen bokes of accompte of houſeholde, and brumentes vpon the ſame, &amp; I doubte not, but in delycyous meates, drinkes, and ſpyces, there is at this daye foure tymes ſo moche ſpent, as was at theſe dayes to a lyke man in degree, and yet at that tyme there was as moche befe and mutton ſpent as is nowe, and as many good houſholdes kept, and as many yomenne wayters therin as be nowe. This began with loue and charytye, whan a lorde, gentylman, or yoman deſyred or prayed an other to come to dyner or ſoupper, and bycauſe of his commynge he wolde haue a dyſſhe or two mo than he wolde haue had, if he had ben away. Than of very loue he, remembrynge howe louyngely he was bydden to dynner, and howe well he fared, he thynketh of very kyndnes he muſte nedes byd hym to dyner agayne, and ſoo ordeyneth for hym as manye maner of ſuche dyſſhes and meates, as the other man dyd, and two or. iii. mo, &amp; thus by lyttel and litell it is commen fer aboue meaſure. And begon of loue and charyte, and endeth in pryde and glotony, wherof ſaynte Ierome ſaythe, Qui poſt carnem ambulant, in ventrem et libidinē pronl ſunt, quaſi irrationabilia iumenta reputātur. That is to ſay, They that walke, and be redy

to fulfill the luſt of the fleſhe and the bely, are taken as vnreaſonable beaſtes, and ſayncte Gregory ſayth, Domināte vicio gulae, omnes virtutes per luxuriam et vanam gloriam obruuntur: That is to ſaye, where the vice of glotony hath domination, all vertues by luxury and vayneglory are caſt vnder. the whiche ſayinges wold in lykewiſe be remembred, and this me ſemeth ſufficient for the. ii. poynte of the thre.
            
            
               ¶ Of outragious playe and game.
               IT is conueniente for euerye man, of what degree that he be of, to haue playe &amp; game accordynge to his degree. For Cato ſayth, Interpone tuis interdum gaudia curis: Amonge thy charges and buſynes thou muſte haue ſometyme ioye and myrthe, but nowe adayes it is doone ferre aboue meaſure. For nowe a poore man in regarde wyll playe as great game, at all maner games, as gentylmen were wont to do, or greater, and gentilmen as lordes, and lordes as prynces, &amp; ofte tymes the great eſtates wyll call gentylmen, or yomen to play with them at as great game as they do, and they call it a diſport, the whiche me ſemeth a very trewe name to it, for it

diſpleaſeth ſome of them er they departe, and ſpecyall god, for myſpendynge of his goodes and tyme. But if they played ſmalle games, that the poore man that playeth myght beare it thoughe he loſte, and bate not his countenaunce, than myght it be called a good game, a good playe, a good ſporte, and a paſtyme. But whan one ſhall loſe vpon a day, or vpon a nyght, as moche money as wold fynde hym and all his houſe meate and drynke a moneth or a quarter of a yere or more, that maye be well called a diſporte, or a diſpleaſure, and ofte tymes by the meanes therof, it cauſeth theym to ſell they landes, dyſheryte the heyres, and may fortune to fall to thefte, robbery, or ſuche other, to the great hurte of them ſelfe, &amp; of theyr chyldren, and to the diſpleaſure of god: and they ſo doinge, lyttel do they pondre or regarde the ſaying of ſaynt Paule, Iuxta facultates faciendi ſunt ſumptus, ne longi temporis victum breuis hora conſumat: This play begun with loue and charite, and oft times it endeth with couetous, wrath, and enuy.

NOwe thou houſbande and houſewife, that haue done your diligence and cure about your huſbandrye and huſwyfry, accordynge to the fyrſte ſayenge of the philoſopher, A dhibe curam, And alſo haue well remembred and fulfylled the ſeconde ſayinge of the ſayde philoſopher, Tene menſuram: I doubte not but ye be ryche accordyng to the thyrde ſayinge of the ſayde philoſopher. Et eris diues. Nowe I haue ſhewed you the ſayinge of the philoſopher, wherby you haue goten moche worldely poſſeſſion, me ſemeth it were neceſſary, to ſhewe you howe ye maye gette heuenly poſſeſſions, accordynge to the ſayenge of our lorde in his goſpel, Quid prodeſt homini, ſi vniuerſum mundum lucretur, anime vero ſuc detrimentum paciatur: What profyteth it to a man, thoughe he wyn all the worlde, to the hyndraunce and loſyng of his ſoule? Howe be it, it ſhoulde ſeme vnconuenient for a temporall man, to take vpon hym, to ſhewe or teache any ſuche ſpirytuall matters: and yet there is a great diuerſytie betwene predication and doctrine.
            
            
               ¶ A diuerſitie betwene predication and doctrine
               
                  
AS ſayncte Iherome ſaythe, there is greate difference or diuerſitie, betwene preachinge and doctrine. A preachyng or a ſermon is, where a conuocation or a gatherynge of people on holye dayes, or other dayes in churches or other places, and times ſette and ordeyned for the ſame. And it belongeth to theym that be ordeyned there vnto, and haue iurisdiction and auctorytie, and to none other. But euery man may lawefully enforme and teache his brother, or any other, at euery tyme and place behouable, if it ſeme expedient to hym, for that is an almes dede, to the whiche euery man is holden &amp; bounde to do, accordyng to the ſayenge of ſaynt Peter, Vnuſquiſ
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                     , ſicut accepit gratiam in alterutrum illam adminiſtare debet. That is to ſaye, as euery man hath taken or receyued grace, he oughte to mynyſter and ſhewe it forthe to other. For as Chriſoſtome ſaythe, great merite is to hym, and a great reward he ſhall haue in tyme to come, the which writeth or cauſeth to be writen, holy doctrine, for that entent, that he may ſe in it, howe he may lyue holylye, and that other maye haue it, that they maye be edyfyed or ſanctyfyed by the ſame. for he ſaythe ſurely, knowe thou, that howe many ſoules be ſaued by the, ſoo many

rewardes thou ſhalte haue for eyther. For ſaynt Gregory ſaythe, Nullum ſacrificium ita placet deo, ſicut zelus animarū: There is no ſacrifyce that pleaſeth god ſo moche, as the loue of ſoules. And alſo he ſaythe, Ille apud deum maior eſt in amore, qui ad eius amorem plurimos trahit: He is greateſte in fauour with god, that draweth moſte men to the loue of god. Wherfore me ſemeth, it is cō
                  uenient to enforme and ſhewe them, how they maye gette heuenly poſſeſſions, as well as I haue ſhewed them to get worldly poſſeſſions. Than to my purpoſe, and to the poynt where I lefte, nowe thou art ryche.
            
            
               ¶ What is rycheſſe.
               IT is to be vnderſtande what is rycheſſe, and as me ſemeth, rycheſſe is that thynge, that is of goodnes, and can not be taken awaye from the owner, neyther in his temporall lyfe, nor in the lyfe euerlaſtynge. Than theſe worldly poſſeſſions, that I haue ſpoken of, is no richeſſe, for why, they be but floures of the worlde. And that may be wel conſydered by Iob, the whiche was the rycheſt man of worldely poſſeſſions, that was lyuynge in thoſe daies, and ſodeynely he was the pooreſt

man agayne that coulde be lyuynge, and all the whyle he toke pacyence, and was content, as appereth by his ſayenge, Dominus dedit, dominus abſtulit: ſicut domino placuit, ita factum eſt, ſit nomen domini benedictum: Our lorde hath gyuen it, our lorde hath taken it awaye, and as it pleaſeth our lorde, ſo be it, bleſſed be the name of our lorde. The whiche Iob may be an enſample to euery true chryſten man, of his pacyence and good liuing in tribulation, as appereth in his ſtorye, who that lyſte to rede therin. And ſaynte Auſtyne ſaythe: Qui terrenis inhiat, et aeterna non cogitat, vtriſ
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      in futuro carebit: He that gathereth in worldly thynges, and thynketh not vppon euerlaſtynge thynges, ſhall wante bothe in tyme to come. For ſayncte Ambroſe ſaythe. Non ſunt bona hominis, quae ſecum ferre non poteſt: They are not the goodes of man, the whiche he can not beare with him And ſaynte Bernarde ſaythe: Si veſtra ſint, tollite vobiſcum: Yf they be yours, take them with you. Than it is to be vnderſtande, what goodes a man ſhall take with hym. And theſe be the good dedes and warkes that thou doſte here in this temporall lyfe, wherof ſpeketh Cryſoſtome: Fac bene, et operare iuſtitiam, vt ſpem habeas apud deum, et non

deſperabis in terra: Doo well, and worke ryghtwyſly, that thou mayſte haue truſte in god, and that thou be not in deſpayre in this worlde. Accordynge to that ſaythe the prophete Dauyd, Iunior fui, etenim ſenui, et non vidi iuſtum derelictum, nec ſemen eius querens panem: I haue ben yonge, and I haue: waxen olde, and I haue not ſeen a ryghtwyſe man forſaken, nor his chyldren ſekynge theyr breade.
            
            
               ¶ What is the propertie of a riche man.
               IN myne opynyon the propertye of a ryche manne is, to be a purchaſer. and if he wyll purchaſe, I councell hym to purchaſe heuen. For ſayncte Auſtyne ſaythe, Regnum caelorum nulli clauditur, niſi illi, qui ſe excluſerit: The kyngedome of heuen is to noo man cloſed, but to hym that wyll putte oute hym ſelfe. Wherfore this texte maye gyue the a courage to prefixe thy mynde, to make there thy purchaſe. And Salomon ſaythe: Quod mali carius emunt infernum, quam boni caelum: Ill men bye hell derer, thanne the good men bie heuen. and that me ſemeth maye well be proued by a common enſample:

As if I had a. M. ſhepe to ſell, and dyuers men come to me, and bye euery manne a. C. of the ſhepe, all of one price, to paye me at dyuers dayes. I am agreed, and graunt them theſe dayes. ſome of the menne be good, and kepe theyr promeſſe, and paye me at theyr dayes, and ſome of theym doo not paye me. wherfore I ſue theym at the lawe, and by courſe of the common lawe, I doo recouer my duetie of them, and haue theyr bodyes in priſone for execution, tylle they haue made me payment. Nowe theſe men, that haue broken me promeſſe, and payed not theyr dewetye, bye theyr ſhepe derer thanne the good menne bought theyrs. For they haue impryſonment of theyr bodyes, and yet muſt they pay theyr duetyes neuer the leſſe, or elles lye and dye there in pryſon: the whiche ſheepe be derer to them, then to the good men, that kepte theyr promes. Righte ſo euery man chepeth heuen, and god hath ſette on it a pryce, and graunted it to euery man, and giuen to them dayes of payment: the pryce is all one, and that is to kepe his commaundementes, duryng theyr lyues. the good men kepe his commaundementes, and fulfyll theyr promeſſe, and haue heuen at theyr deceaſe. The yll men breake promeſſe, &amp; kepe not his commaundementes,

wherfore at theyr deceaſe they be put in pryſon, that is to ſay in hell, there to abyde his ryghtuouſenes. And ſoo the yll men bye hell derer, than the good menne bye heuen. And therfore it is better, to forgoo a lyttell pleaſure, or ſuker a lyttell payne in this worlde, than to ſuffer a moche greatter and a lenger payne, in an other worlde. Nowe ſythe helle is derer than heuen, I aduyſe the ſpecyally to bye heuen, wherin is euerlaſtynge ioye without ende.
            
            
               ¶ What ioyes or pleaſures are in heuen.
               SAynt Auſtyn ſaythe, Ibi erunt quaecun
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      ab hominibus deſiderantur, vita et ſalus, copia glorie, honor, pax, et omnia bona: That is to ſaye, There ſhall be euery thynge that any man deſyreth, there is lyfe, helth, plenty of ioye, honour, peace, and all maner of goodnes. What wolde a man haue more? And ſaynt Paule ſayth. Occulus non vidit, nec auris audiuit, nec in cor hominis aſcendit, quae preparauit deus diligentibus ſe: That is to ſay. The eye hath not ſeen, nor the eares hath herde, nor the herte of a man hath thought of ſo goodly thynges, that god

hath ordeyned for theym that loue hym. O what a noble acte that were for an huſbande or houſwyfe, to purchaſe ſuche a royall place in heuen, to whiche is no comparyſon. Than it is to bē knowen, what thynge pleaſeth god moſt, that we myght do it.
            
            
               ¶ What thynges pleaſeth god moſt.
               By the texte of ſayncte Paule, before ſayd, loue pleaſeth god aboue al thinge, and that maye be well proued by the ſayinge of our lorde hym ſelfe, where he ſaythe: Da mihi cor tuum, et ſufficit mihi: Gyue me thy harte, and that is ſufficiente for me, for he that hath a mannes harte, hath all his other goodes. what is this mans harte: it is nothynge elles, but very trewe loue. For there can be no true loue, but it commeth meryly and immediately from the harte: and if thou loue god entyerlye with thy harte, than wylte thou do his commaundementes. Than it wolde be vnderſtande and knowen, whiche be his commandementes, that a man may obſerue and kepe them.
            
            
               ¶ What be goddes commaundementes.
               
                  
THere be in all. x. commandementes, the which were to long to declare, but they be all concluded and comprehended in two, that is to ſay. Diliges dominum deum tuum ſuper omnia: Et proximum tuū ſicut te ipſum: Loue thy lorde god aboue al thing, and thy neyghboure as thy ſelfe. Theſe be lyghte commaundementes, and nature byndeth a man to fulfyll, obſerue, and kepe them, or els he is not a naturall man, remembryng what god hath doone for the. Fyrſte he hath made the, to the ſymylytude and lykenes of his owne ymage, and hathe gyuen to the in this worlde dyuerſe poſſeſſions but ſpecyally he hath redemed thy ſoule vpon the croſſe, and ſuffered great payne and paſſion and bodelye deathe for thy ſake. What loue, what kyndenes was in hym, to doo this for the? what couldeſt thou deſyre hym to do more for the? And he deſyreth nothynge of the agayne, but loue for loue. What can he deſyre leſſe.
            
            
               ¶ Howe a man ſhulde loue god and pleaſe hym.
               SVrelye a man maye loue god and pleaſe hym, very many wayes: but fyrſte &amp; principally, he that wyllloue god, and pleaſe

hym, he muſte doo as it is ſayde in Symbalo Athanaſii: Quicun
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      vult ſaluus eſſe, ante omnia opus eſt, vt teneat catholicā fidem, Who ſo euer wyll be ſaued, aboue all thynge he muſt nedes be ſtedfaſt in the faythe of holy churche. And accordynge to that, ſaythe ſayncte Paule: Sine fide impoſsibile eſt placere deo: Without faythe, it is impoſſible to pleaſe god. And Seneca ſayth: Nichil retine
                        •
                     , qui fidem perdidit: There abydeth no goodnes in hym, that hath loſte his faythe. And ſoo thou mayſte wel perceyue, that thou canſt not loue nor pleaſe god, without perfyte fayth. And ferther more thou mayſte not preſume to ſtudy, nor to argue thy faithe by reaſon. For ſaynte Gregory ſaythe: Fides non habet meritum, vbi humana ratio prebet experimentum: Faythe hath noo meryte, where as mannes reaſone proueth the ſame. This faythe is a pryncypall ſygne, that thou loueſte god. Alſo thy good dedes, and thy warkes, is a good ſygne, that thou loueſte god. For ſaynt Iherome ſaythe: Vnuſquiſque, cuius opera facit, eius filius appellatur: Whoſe warkes euerye man dothe, his ſon or ſeruaunt he is called. And ſayncte Bernarde ſaythe, Efficatior eſt vox operis, q vox ſermonis: The dedes and the warkes of a man

is more euydente profe, than his wordes. The fulfyllynge of the. vii. workes of mercye is an other ſpecyall ſygne, that thou loueſt god: and many mo there be, which were to longe to reherſe them all.
            
            
               ¶ Howe a man ſhulde loue his neyghbour.
               THou muſt loue thy neyghboure as thy ſelfe, wherin thou ſhalt pleaſe god ſpecially. for if thou loue thy neyghbour as thy ſelfe, it foloweth by reaſon, that thou ſhalte do nothynge to hym, but ſuche as thou woldeſt ſhulde be done to the. And that is to preſume, that thou woldeſt not haue any hurte of thy body, nor of thy goodes, done vnto the, and lykewyſe thou ſhuldeſt none do vnto hym. And alſo if thou woldeſt haue any goodnes done vnto the, eyther in thy bodye, or in thy mouable goodes, lyke wyſe ſhuldeſt thou do vnto thy neyghbour, if it lye in thye power, accordynge to the ſayinge of ſaynte Gregorye, Nec deus ſine proximo, nec proximus vere diligitur ſine deo: Thou canſte not loue god, without thou loue thy neyghbour, nor thou canſt not loue thy neighbour, without thou loue god. Wherfore thou

muſte fyrſte loue god pryncypallye, and thy neyghbour ſecondaryly.
            
            
               ¶ Of prayer that pleaſeth god very moche.
               PRayer is honour and lande to god, and a ſpecyall thynge that pleaſeth hym moche, and is a greate ſygne, that thou loueſt god, and that thou arte perfyte and ſtedfaſte in the faythe of holy churche: and that it is ſo, it maye be well conſydered by our fore fathers, that haue for the loue and honour of god made churches: And a man muſte dayly at ſome conuenyente tymes exercyſe and vſe prayer hym ſelfe, as he oughte to doo. For ſaynt Ambroſe ſayth, Relicto hoc, ad quod teneris, ingratum eſt ſpiritui ſancto quicquid aliud operatis: If thou leaue that thynge vndone, that thou arte bounde to doo, it is not acceptable to god, what ſo euer thou dooſte elles. Than it is neceſſarye, that thou do praye, and a poore manne doynge his labour trewely in the daye, and thinketh well, prayeth well: but on the holye daye, he is bounde to come to the church, and here his diuyne ſeruyce.
            
            
               
               ¶ What thynge letteth prayer.
               THere be two impedimentes, that lette and hynder prayer, that it maye not be herde. And of the fyrſte impedimente ſpekethe Yſaye the prophete: Quia manus veſtrae plenae ſunt ſanguine. i. peccato ideo non exaudiet vos dominus: Bycauſe your handes be full of bloude, that is to ſaye, full of ſynne, therfore our lorde dothe not graciouſely here you. And alſo prouerbiorum tertio. Longe eſt dominus ab impiis, et orationes iuſtorum exaudiet. Our lorde is ferre fro wycked men, and the prayers of ryghtewyſe men he gracyouſly hereth. And ſayncte Bernarde ſaythe, Quia praeceptis dei auertitur, quod in oratione poſtulat non meretur: He that dothe not goddes commaundementes, he deſerueth not to haue his prayer harde. The ſeconde impediment ſaythe Anaſtaſius is, Si non dimittis iniuriam, que tibi facta eſt, non orationem pro te facis, ſed maledictionem ſuper te inducis: If thou forgyue not the wronge done vnto the, thou doſte not praye for thy ſelfe, but thou enduceſt goddes curſe to fall vppon the. And Iſodorus ſaythe, Sicut nullum in vulnere proficit medicamemtum, ſi adhuc ferrum in eo fit:

ita nihil proficiat oratio illius, cuius adhuc dolor in mente vel odium manet in pectore. Lyke as the playſter or medycyne can not heale a wounde, if there be any yren ſtyckinge in the ſame, ryghte ſoo the prayer of a man profyteth hym not, as longe as there is ſorowe in his mynde, or hate abydynge in his breſte. For ſayncte Auſtyne ſaythe, Si deſit charitas, fruſtra habentur cetera. If charitie wante, all other thynges be voyde. Wherfore thou muſte ſe that thou ſtande in the ſtate of grace, and not infecte with deedly ſynne, and than praye if thou wyll be harde.
            
            
               ¶ Howe a man ſhulde praye.
               IT is to be vnderſtande that there be dyuers maner of prayinges, Quedam publica, et quedam priuata, That is to ſaye, ſome openlye, and ſome priuately. Prayer openly muſte nedes be done in the churche by the mynyſtratours of the ſame people. For it is done for all the comynaltye, and therfore the people in that oughte to conferme theym ſelfe to the ſayde mynyſtratours, and there to be preſente to praye vnto god after a dewe maner. Oratio priuata. The prayer pryuately done, oughte to be doone in ſecrete places,

for two cauſes. For prayer eleuateth and lyfteth vp a mannes mynde to god. And the mynde of man is ſooner and better lyfte vppe whan he is in a pryuye place, and ſeparate frome multytude of people. An other cauſe is to auoyde vaynglory that myghte lyghtely enſue or ryſe thervppon, whan it is doone openly. and therof ſpeketh our ſauyour, where he ſayth, Cum oratis, non eritis ſicut hypocritae, qui amant in ſinagogis, et in angulis platearum ſtantes orare. That is to ſaye, whan ye praye, be not you as the hypocrytes, the whiche loue to ſtande in theyr ſynagoges and corners of hyghe wayes to praye. Alſo ſome folkes pray with the lyppes or mouthe, and not with the herte, of whome ſpekethe our lorde by his prophete, Hij labiis me honorant, cor autem eorum longe eſt a me. They honour me with theyr mouthe, and theyr hertes be ferre frome me. And ſayncte Gregory ſaythe, Quid prodeſt ſtrepitus labiorum vbi mutum eſt cor? What profyteth the labour of the mouthe, where the herte is dombe? And Iſodore ſaythe, Longe quippe a deo eſt animus, qui in oratione cogitarionibus ſaeculi fuerit occupatus. His ſoule is far from god, that in his prayer his mynde is occupied in warkes of the worlde. There be

other that pray both with the mouth and hart of whom ſpeketh ſayncte Iohn̄. x. Veri adoratores, adorabunt patrem in ſpiritu et veritate. The true prayers wylle worſhyp the father of heauen in ſpirite and with trouthe. Iſodorus ſaythe, Tunc veraciter oramus, quando aliunde non cogitamus. Than we praye truely, whan we thynke on nothynge elles. Richardus de Hampole. Ille deuote orat, qui non habet cor vacabundum in ter renis occupationibus, ſed ſublatum ad deum in caeleſtibus. He prayeth deuoutly, that hath not his harte wauerynge in worldelye occupations, but alwaye ſubleuate and lyfte vppe to god in heuen. There be other that praye with the harte. vn̄ Mat. vi. Tu autem cum oraueris, intra cubiculum tuum. i. in loco ſecreto et clauſo hoſtio, ora patrem tuum. Whan thou ſhalte praye, entre into thy chambre or oratory, and ſteke the doore, and praye to the father of heuen. Iſodorus, Ardens oratio eſt non labiorum ſed cordium, potius enim orandum eſt corde q ore. The hoter prayer is with the harte than with the lyppes, rather pray with thy herte than with thy mouth. Regum primo. Anna loquebatur in corde. Anne ſpake with the harte.
            
            
               
               ¶ A meane to put away ydle thoughtes in prayinge.
               ANd to auoyde wauerynge myndes, in worldlye occupations whanne thou ſhalte praye, I ſhall ſhewe vnto you the beſte experience that euer I coulde fynde for the ſame, the whiche haue benne moche troubled therwith, and that is this. He that can rede and vnderſtande latyne, let hym take his booke in his hande, and looke ſtedfaſtely vppon the ſame thynge that he readeth and ſeeth, that is no trouble to hym, and remembre the englyſſhe of the ſame, wherin he ſhall fynde greatte ſwetenes, and ſhall cauſe his mynde to folowe the ſame, and to leaue other worldly thoughtes. And he that canne not reade nor vnderſtande his Pater noſter. Aue, nor Crede, he muſte remembre the paſſyon of Chriſte, what peyne he ſuffered for hym, and all mankynde, for redemynge of theyr ſoules. And alſo the miracles and wonders that god hath doone, and fyrſte what wonders were doone the nyghte of his natyuitie and byrthe. And howe he turned water in to wyne, and made the blynde to ſe, the dombe to ſpeake, the deafe to here, the lame to go, the ſycke to be hole. And howe he fed

fyue thouſande with two fyſſhes, and fyue barley loues, wherof was lefte. xii. coffyns or ſkyppes of fragmentes. And howe he reiſed Lazare from deathe to lyfe, with manye moo myracles that be innumerable to be reherſed. And alſo to remembre the ſpecyall poyntes of his paſſion, howe he was ſolde &amp; betrayed of Iudas, and taken by the iewes, and broughte before Pylate, than to kynge Herode, and to byſſhoppe Cayphas, and than to Pylate agayne, that iudged hym to death, and howe he was bounde to a piller and how they ſcurged, bobbed, mocked hym, ſpytte in his face, crowned hym with thornes, and cauſed hym to beare the croſſe to the mounte of Caluary, wheryppon he was nayled both handes and fete, and wounded to the harte with a ſharpe ſpere, and ſoo ſuffered deathe. And howe he fette out the ſoules of our forefathers forthe of hell. Howe he roſe frome deathe to lyfe, and howe ofte he appered to his diſcyples and other moo. And what myracles he wroughte afterwarde, and ſpecyallye what power he gaue to his dyſcyples, that were noo clerkes, to teache and preche his faythe, and worke many myracles, and ſpecyally whan they preached before menne of dyuers nations and languages, and euerye

man vnderſtode them in theyr own language▪ the whiche is a ſygne that god wolde haue euery manne ſaued, and to knowe his lawes, the whiche was a myracle able to conuerte all the infydeles, heretykes, and lollers in the worlde.
            
            
               ¶ A meane to auoyde temptation.
               IT is ofte tymes ſeen, that the holyer that a man is, the more he is tempted, and he that ſoo is, maye thanke god therof. for god of his goodnes and grace hath not gyuen to the dyuell auctoritie nor power, to attempte any man ferther and aboue that, that he that is ſo tempted, maye withſtande. For ſayncte Gregory ſayth, Non eſt timendum hoſtis, qui non poteſt vincere niſi volentē. An ennemye is not to be dradde, the whiche maye not ouercome, but if a manne be wyllynge. And it is to preſume, that he that is ſoo tempted, ſtandeth in the ſtate of grace. For ſayncte Ambroſe ſaythe, Illos diabolis vexare negligit, quos iure haereditario ſe poſsidere ſentit. The dyuell deſpyſeth to vexe or trouble thoſe, the whiche he felethe him ſelfe to haue in poſſeſſyon by ryght inheritaunce. And if thou be ſo tempted, vexed, or

troubled, I ſhall ſhewe vnto the two verſes, that if thou do therafter, thou ſhalte be eaſed of thy temptacyon, and haue greatte thanke and laude of god and rewarde therfore, theſe be the verſes.
               
                  Hoſtis nō ledit, niſi cum tēptatus obedit.
                  Eſt leo ſi ſedit, ſi ſtat quaſi muſca recedit.
               
               ¶ That is to ſay, The goſtly enemy hurteth not, but whan he that is tempted obeyeth to his temptation, Than his ghoſtly enemy plaieth the lyon, if that he that is ſo tempted ſyt ſtyll and obey to hym. And if he that is tempted, ſtande ſtyfly agaynſte hym, the ghoſtlye ennemye flyeth awaye lyke a flye. This me ſemeth maye be wel proued by a famylier enſaumple. As if a lorde had a caſtell, and deliuered it to a capitayne to kepe, if there come ennemies to the caſt
                     •
                  ll, and call to the capytayn, and byd hym delyuer them this caſtell. The capytayne cometh and openeth them the gates, and delyuereth the keyes. Nowe is this caſtell ſoone wonne, and this capytayne is a falſe traytour to the lorde. But lette the capitaine arme hym ſelfe, and ſteke the gates, and ſtande ſtyfly vpon the walle, and commaunde them to auoyde at theyr peryll, and they wyll not tary to make any aſſaut. Ryght ſo euery man is capitayne of his owne ſoule.

and if thy goſtely ennemy come and tempte the, and thou that arte capytayne of thyne owne ſoule, wyll open the gates, and delyuer hym the keyes and let hym in, thy ſowle is ſoone taken pryſoner, and thou a falſe traytour to thy ſoule, and worthye to be punyſſhed in pryſon for euer. And if thou arme thy ſelfe and ſtande ſtyfly agaynſte hym, and wyll not conſente to hym, he wyll auoyde and fle away, and thou ſhalt haue a great reward for withſtandynge of the ſayde temptation.
            
            
               ¶ Almes dedes pleaſeth god moche.
               ALmes dedes pleſeth god very moche, and it is great ſygne that thou loueſte bothe god and thy neyghboure. And he of whome almes is aſked, oughte to conſyder thre thynges, that is to ſaye, who aſketh almes, what he aſketh, and whervnto he aſketh. Nowe to the fyrſte, who aſketh almes, Deus petit. God aſketh. For ſaynte Ierome ſayth, Quia deus adeo diligit pauperes, quod quicquid fit eis propter amorem ſuum, reputat ſibi factum. That is to ſaye, bycauſe that god loueth poore men ſoo moche, what ſomeuer thynge is gyuen vnto

theym for the loue of hym, he taketh it as it were done to hym ſelfe, as it is ſayde in his goſpell, Quod vni ex minimis meis feciſtis, michi feciſtis. That thynge that ye gyue or do to the leaſt of thoſe that be myne, ye do it to me. Thanne to the ſeconde, what aſketh god? Non noſtrum, ſed ſuum. He aſketh not that thynge, that is ours, but that thynge that is his owne. As ſaythe the prophete Dauid, Tua ſunt domine omnia: Et quae de manu tua accepimus, tibi dedimus. Good lorde, all thynges be thyne, and thoſe thynges that we haue taken of the, of thoſe haue we gyuen the. Thanne to the thyrde. Where vnto dothe god aſke? He aſketh not to gyue hym, but all onely to borowe, Non tamen ad triplas, ſilicet, immo ad centuplas. Not all onely to haue thryſe ſoo moche, but forſothe to haue an hundred tymes ſoo moche. As ſaynt Auſtyn ſaythe, Miſer homo quid veneraris homini, venerare deo, et centuplum accipies, et vitam aeternam poſſidebis? Thou wretched manne, why doſte thou worſhyp or dreade man: worſhyp thou god and dreade hym, and thou ſhalte receyue an hundred tymes ſo moche, and haue in poſſeſſyon euerlaſtynge lyfe, the whiche many folde paſſeth all other rewardes? Prouerbiorum.

xiiii. Veneratur dominus, qui miſeres tur pauperibus. He worſhyppeth our lorde, that hath mercye and pytye on poore folkes. And the gloſe therof ſayth, Centuplum accepturus. And thou ſhalte receyue an. C. tymes ſo moche. And it is to be vnderſtande, that there be thre maner of almes dedes, that is to ſaye, Egenti largire quicquid poteris: dimittere eis a quibus leſus fueris: Errantem cotrigere, et in viam veritatis reducere, That is to ſaye, to gyue to the nedy what thou well mayſte, to forgyue theym that haue treſpaced to the, and to correcte them that do amyſſe, and to brynge them into the waye of ryghte.
            
            
               ¶ The fyrſte maner of almes.
               
                  EGenti largire quicquid poteris. Gyue to the nedye what thou well maye. for our lorde ſaythe in his goſpell. Date elemoſinam, et omnia munda ſunt vobis. Et alibi. Date, et dabitur vobis. Gyue almes, and all worldly rycheſſe is yours. gyue and it ſhall be gyuen to you. Almes dede is a holy thynge, it encreaſeth a mans welthe, it maketh leſſe a mannes ſynnes, it lengtheth a mans lyfe, it maketh a man of good mynde,

it delayeth yll tymes, and cloſeth all thynges, hit delyuereth a manne from deathe, it ioyneth a manne with aungelles, and ſeuereth hym from the dyuell, and is lyke a wall vnable to be foughten agaynſt. And ſaynt Iames ſaythe. Sicut aqua extinguit ignem, ita elemoſina peccatum. As water ſlecketh fyer, ſoo dothe almes dede ſlake ſynne. Salomon ſaythe, Qui dat pauperi, non indigebit. He that giueth vnto a poore man, ſhal neuer haue nede. And alſo he ſayth, Qui obturat aurem ſuam ad clamorem pauperis, et ipſe clamabit, et non exaudietur. He that ſtoppeth his eare at the clamoure or crie of a pore man (he ſhall crye) and he ſhall not be gracyouſely herde. There maye no manne excuſe hym from gyuynge of almes, thoughe he be poore. And let hym doo as the poore wydowe dyd, that offered a farthynge, wherfore ſhe hadde more thanke and rewarde of god, thanne the ryche men that offered golde. And if thou mayſte not gyue a farthynge, gyue leſſe, or gyue fayre wordes, or good information, enſaumple and token: and god ſhall rewarde the bothe for thy dede and for thy good wyll. And that thou dooſte, do it with a good wyll. For ſaynte Paule ſaythe, Hilarem datorem diligit deus. God loueth a glad gyuer, and

that it be of true begotten goodes. For Salomon ſaythe, De tuis iuſtis laboribus miniſtra pauperibus. Of thy trewe labours mynyſtre and gyue to the poore folkes. For Iſodorus ſaythe, Qui iniuſte tollit, iuſte nunquam tribuit. He that taketh wrongfully, can not gyue trewelye. For it is wrytten Eccleſiaſtici. xxxv. Qui de rapinis, aut vſuris, aut de furto immolat: et quaſi qui coram patre victimat filium. He that offereth of the goodes that he getteth by extortyon, vſurye, or thefte, he is lyke as a man ſlewe the ſonne in the preſence of the father. Thou mayſte ryghte well knowe, the father wolde not be well contente. Noo more wolde god be pleaſed with the gyfte of ſuche begotten goodes.
            
            
               ¶ The ſeconde maner of almes.
               
                  DImittere eis, a quibus leſus fueris. To forgyue theym that haue treſpaced to the, wherin thou ſhalte pleaſe god moche. For it is in the goſpell of ſayncte Marke. xii. Si non dimiſeritis aliis, nec pater veſter celeſtis dimittet vobis peccata veſtra. If you forgyue not, your father of

heuen wyll not forgyue you your ſynnes. Alſo if thou doo not forgyue other, thou ſhalte be founde a lyer, as ofte as thou ſayeſte thy Pater noſter, where thou ſayſte: Et dimitte nobis debita noſtra, ſicut et nos dimittimus debitoribus noſtris. And forgyue to vs our dettes, as we forgyue to our detters. By theſe dettes maye be vnderſtande the thynges that we oughte to do to god, and doo not them. And alſo the treſpaces and the ſynne that we haue offended to god, in that we aſke mercye of. And if thou wylte not forgyue, thou mayſt not aſke mercy of ryght. Eadem menſura, qua menſi fueritis, remetietur vobis. The ſame meaſure that ye meate other men by, ſhall be moten vnto you. Dimittere autem rancorem et maliciam omnino neceſsitatis eſt, dimittere vero actionem et emendam opus eſt conſilij. To forgyue all rancour and malyce, that a manne oweth to the in his harte, thou arte bounden of neceſſitie to forgyue all the hole treſpace, or to leaue thyne actyon or a reaſonable mendes. Therfore it is but a dede of mercye if thou ſo do, and no ſynne though thou ſue the lawe with charytie. But and a manne haue done to the a treſpace, and that thou arte gladde that he hathe ſoo doone, that thou mayſte haue a

quarell, or a matter, or an accyon agaynſte hym, and nowe of malyce or yll wyll thou wylte ſue hym, rather than for the treſpace, nowe thou ſynneſt dedely, bycauſe thou doeſt rather of malyce than for the treſpace, and than haſte thou loſte thy charitie, Prouerbiorum. xxxii. Qui pronus eſt ad miſericordiam, benedicetur. He that is redy to forgiue, ſhall be bleſſed.
            
            
               ¶ The thyrde maner of almes.
               
                  ERrantem corrigere, et in viam veritatis reducere. To correcke a miſdoer, and to brynge hym into the waye of tyghte. It is to be vnderſtand, that there be thre maner of corrections.
               ¶ The fyrſte correction is of an ennemye, the ſeconde is of a frynde, and the thyrde correction is of a Iuſtyce. The fyrſte ſaythe Chriſoſtome, Corripe non vt hoſtis expetens vindictam, ſed vt medicus inſtituens medicinam Correcke not as an enemye doinge vengeaunce, but as a phiſicyon or ſurgyon, myniſtringe or gyuynge a medicyne. To the ſeconde ſaythe Salomon. Plus proficit amica correctio, quam correctio turbulenta. A frendelye correction profyteth more

than a troublous correction. For yf thou ſpeke courteyſly to a man that hath offended, and with ſweete wordes of compaſſion, he ſhall rather be conuerted by theym, than with hye wordes of great punyſſhement. And Iſodorus ſaythe, Qui per verba blanda caſtigatus non corrigetur, acrius neceſſe eſt, vt arguatur He that wylle not be chaſtyſed by fayre wordes, it is neceſſary that he be more hardlyer and ſtraytlyer reproued or punyſſhed. To the thyrde ſaythe ſayncte Ierome, Equum iudicium eſt, vbi non perſona
                        •
                     ſed opera conſiderantur. There is an euyn Iugemente, where the perſonne is not regarded, but the warkes are conſydered. And alſoo hit is wrytten, Reddet vnicui
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      iuxta opera ſua. He ſhall yelde vnto euery manne after his workes. And ſayncte Auguſtyne ſaythe, Sicut meliores ſunt, quos corrigit amor, ita plures ſunt quos corrigit timor. As thoſe be better, that be chaſtyſed by loue, ſoo there be many moo th
                     •
                  t be chaſtyſed by feare. For and they feared not the punyſhement of the lawe, there wolde be but a fewe chaſtyſed by loue. And ſaynte Gregory ſayth, Facientis procul dubio culpam habet, qui quod poteſt corrigere negligit emendare, et illicita non prohibere conſenſus

erroris eſt. He that maye correcke, and dothe not, he taketh the offence to hym ſelfe of the dede, and he that dothe not forbede vnlawefull thynges, conſenteth to the ſame. &amp;c.
            
            
               ¶ What is the greatteſt offence that a manne may doo and offende god in.
               IN myne opynyon, it is to be in deſpayre of the mercye of god. And therfore what ſoo euer thou haue doone or offended god, in worde, warke, thought, or dede, be neuer in deſpayre for it, for Iſodorus ſaythe, Qui veniam de peccato deſperat, plus de deſperatione peccat quam de culpa cadit. He that deſpayreth to haue forgyuenes of his ſynnes, he ſynneth more in deſpayrynge than he dyd in the ſynne doynge. For ſaynte Iherome ſayth, Magis offendebat Iudas deum in hoc quod ſuſpendebat, quam in hoc, quod eum tradidit. Iudas offended god more in that that he hanged hym ſelfe, than he dydde whanne he betrayed god. For god ſayth in his goſpell. Nolo mortem peccatoris, ſed magis vt conuertatur et viuat. I wyll not the deathe of a ſynner, but rather

that he maye be conuerted and lyue. And alſo he ſaythe, Non veni vocare iuſtos, ſed peccatores ad penitentiam. I am not comen to call ryghtwyſe men, but to call ſynners to do penaunce. For thou canſte not ſo ſoone crye god mercy with thy harte, but he is as redye to chaunge his ſentence, and to graunte the mercy and forgynenes of all thy ſynnes. For ſaynt Auſtyne ſaythe, Sicut ſcintilia ignis in medio maris, ſic omnis impie
                        •
                     as viri ad miſericordiam dei. As a ſparke of fyer is in compariſon able to drye vppe all the water in the ſe, noo more is all the wyckednes of man vnto the mercyfulnes of god. And therfore it is conuenyent that a manne ſhulde be penytent, contryte, and aſke god mercye and forgyueneſſe of his ſynnes and offences that he hath done, wherof ſpeketh Chryſoſtme, Nemo ad deum aliquando flens acceſsit quod non poſtulaueritaccepſt. No man hath gone any tyme wepynge to god, but he hath taken or had that thynge that he hath aſked. And ſayncte Bernarde ſaythe, Plus cruciant lacrime peccatoris diabolum quam omne genus tormentorum. The teares of a ſynner tourmenteth the deuyll more, than all other kyndes of turmentes. And ſayncte Auſtyne ſaythe, Acriores dolores demonibus
                  
                  non inferrimus, 
                        
                           
                        
                        quam
                      cum peccata noſtra penitendo et confitendo plangimus. We canne not doo more ſharper ſorowes to the dyuell, than whan we wayle or wepe in confeſſyon, and doynge of penaunce. And that maye be well proued by Mary Magdaleyn, whanne ſhe kneled downe and cryed god mercye, and kyſte his fete, and waſſhed theym with the teares of her eyen, and wyped them with the heare of her heed, to whom our lorde ſayde, as in his goſpell. Dimittuntur tibi peccata tua. Thy ſynnes are forgyuen to the, and alſo he ſayde to her. Fides te ſaluam fecit, vade in pace. Thy faythe hath ſaued the, goo thou in peace. To the whiche mercy and peace I beſech almyghty Ieſu brynge all chryſten ſoules. Amen.
               BE it knowen to all men bothe ſpirytuall and temporall, that I make proteſtacion before god and man, that I entende not to wryte any thynge that is or maye be contrary to the faythe of Chryſte and al holy churche. But I am redye to reuoke my ſayenge, if any thyng haue paſſed my mouthe for wante of lernynge, and to ſubmytte my ſelfe to correction, and my boke to reformatyon. And as touchynge the poyntes of huſbandry,
