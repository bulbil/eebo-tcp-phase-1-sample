            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

                        No, but a ſtudent in a better art; haſt thou ever read Ovidde arte amandi, or Ovids amorous Epiſtles?

                        O, I would have thee ſtudy that booke above all other, there are very good rules, and worth the obſervation truly, if thou erreſt in any thing therein written, I will be thy Miſtreſſe to inſtruct thee, follow my rudiments good ſonne.

                        But I have heard 'tis a ribaldrous booke, and corrupteth youth to all wantonneſſe.

                        That is but a fantaſie, a mere untruth; it was made by the Poet for youthfull recreation and paſtime, none but Stoicall old men will invey againſt them, who envio that in others which they cannot enjoy in themſelves.

                     Enter Ariſtippus.
                     O, my deare husband, where have you lingred ſo long; you are too blame indeed to leave me ſo ſolitary, I muſt chide you for it, truly, had you tarried never ſo little longer, I ſhould have died for ſorrow.

                        With all the ſpeed he can.

                        Demeneta lies down upon the bed, faining her ſelfe ſicke.
                     
                     
                        Dem.
                        What raging fires ſtill burne me? how I am
                        Divided in my ſelfe tweene love and hate,
                        two mighty paſſions combatting together?
                        Love would prevaile, if reaſon might be judge,
                        But love is too unreaſonably harſh:
                        Hate therefore execute thy proper function,

                        The gods forbid, that ſound doth ſtrike me dead;
                        What ailes my deareſt wife? tell me the cauſe

                        Nothing Sir,
                        I know no cauſe at all.
                     
                     
                        Ariſt.
                        Come, come, you muſt not
                        Conceale your griefe, but lay it ope unto me,
                        I doe beſeech my love.
                     
                     
                        Dem.
                        Since you are ſo
                        Importunate to know it, underſtand
                        The goodly young man, ſonne unto us both
                        (To you by nature, but to me by love)
                        Whom I (the gods know) held as deare unto me
                        As you, when he perceiv'd by certaine tokens
                        I was with child by you (which thing I kept
                        Hid from your knowledge till I knew my ſelfe
                        The certainty) and waiting for your abſence,
                        When I in wonted manner councell'd him
                        To leave his whores, and to avoid his cups
                        (Which things I knew he lov'd, but would not tell you,
                        Leſt I ſhould run into the ill ſuſpition
                        Of ſtepmother) whileſt I in gentle manner
                        Told him theſe things, I will not ſpeake the worſt,
                        Nor in what ſort he did revile us both,
                        But laſt of all, he ſpurn'd me on the belly,
                        Which hath procur'd this my diſeaſe and paine.
                     
                     
                        Ariſt.
                        O villaine, I will ſcurge him even to death;
                        
                           Thisbe, goe call him hither. Exit Thisbe.
                        
                        Then preſently enters Cnemon, Ariſtippus falls preſently a buffetting of him without ſpeaking a word, then calls his ſervants and ſcurgeth him with rods.

                        Deare father, I beſeech you let me know
                        The cauſe of this your anger and my ſtripes
                        So cruelly laid on mee.

                        Oh cleanly diſſembler,
                        Thou wouldſt indeed know thy owne fault from me.

                        Yet now at length, Sir, let me underſtand
                        What I have done, that thus provokes your wrath,
                        The gods doe know my innocence.

                        I'm in bad plight,

                        Yet, Sir, it griev'd me that you tooke ſo ſharpe
                        A puniſhment of Cnemon, for all this
                        I cannot chuſe but love him.

I left him curſing the Deputy, and invoking the god Apollos wrath to plague him for diſmiſſing the Embaſſadour ſo ſuddenly, with ſuch deadly threatenings to depart the Kingdome. Alas, poore maid, I pity thee, that by this meanes thou ſhalt not be able to

                        And danger which the action brings with it
                        If once diſcover'd, made me to commit

                        Welcome to Greece my worthy friend and brother,
                        And in the fitteſt time, becauſe I ſhall

                        And can perſwade, when reaſon is your theame.
                     
                     
                        Cala.
                        What I can doe, our long acquaintance ſir
                        And brotherhood in travell and vocation,
                        VVils me to render it unto your ſervice;
                        VVherein can I be uſefull to my friend?

                        In this, you know laſt night I did relate
                        
                           Cariclaes ſtory, how I did receive her
                        And brought her from your Egypt here to Greece,
                        
                        where in a ſhort time ſhe hath learn'd our tongue,
                        And ſo farre paſſeth ſhe all other beauties
                        That ſhe attracteth all mens eyes to gaze
                        VVith admiration on her, as well ſtrangers
                        
                           
As Greekes, ſo thatwhere e'r ſhee be converſant,
                        Either at home, or in the Temples, or
                        At publique exerciſes, all mens eyes
                        Are fix'd upon her with as great devotion
                        As if ſhe were the image of ſome goddeſſe
                        Lately created; that which grieves me, is
                        She loathes to heare of marriage, and reſolves
                        To live a maiden ſtill, and ſo becomming
                        
                           Dianas ſervant, for the moſt part doth
                        Apply her ſelfe to hunting and to ſhooting;
                        I had a great deſire to marry her
                        Unto my ſiſters ſonne, a fine young man,
                        Well manner'd, and faire ſpoken; but I cannot,
                        Either by prayer or promiſe, or by force
                        Of argument perſwade her thereunto:
                        In this I crave your helpe, deare Calaſiris,
                        
                        Uſe ſome point of your wiſedome to perſwade her
                        To know her nature, that ſhe is a woman,
                        And that ſhe would not ſo degenerate
                        From all thoſe of her ſex; this I beſeech you
                        To doe for great Apollos ſake, and all
                        Your countrey gods.

                        In this point, Caricles,
                        
                        I'le doe my beſt indeavour. Enter Nebulo.

                        Pray Sir,
                        What are thoſe Aenians? what their holy meſſage?
                        What ſacrifice make they?

                        They are the nobleſt
                        Of all Theſſalia, this ſame ſacrifice

This meſſage is more honourably done
                        Than any of the reſt, becauſe they ſay
                        The Captaine is ſprung from Achilles line.
                        Indeed, ſuch is the beauty of his perſon
                        And brave majeſticke carriage, as confirmes
                        He is ſome goddeſſe ſonne.

                           Cariclea too, my daughter, muſt be there
                        To day by cuſtome, at the funerall pompe
                        Of Neoptolemus, but you have ſeene her
                        Before.

                        Come, you muſt goe unto the Temple with us
                        To helpe me in this ceremonious worke.

                        Strange things will happen after this rare ſight Exeunt.

                           Thisbe my love, we muſt act cloſely, and with great circumſpection, leſt we be diſcovreed by the miſchievous Demeneta, who (as thou ſay'ſt) hates me more now than ſhe lov'd me before.
                     
                     
                        Thiſ.
                        You talke ſimply Cnemon, if you count it a dangerous matter for me being a bond-maid, bought with money, to be taken a bed with you; what puniſhment thinke you her worthy, who is a free-woman, and lawfully married to a husband, yet playeth falſe, and beareth a man too many.

                        I can ſcarce believe it.
                     
                     
                        Thiſ.
                        To confirme my report (if you pleaſe) I will deliver the adulterer unto you in the very act.

                        VVith all my heart, not onely for your ſake who have been injured by her before, but for mine owne alſo, who, for that ſhe hath me in jealouſie, am uſed of her very extreamely, wherefore if thou be a man apprehend him.
                     
                     
                        Cnem.
                        Elſe let me die in ſcorne and infamie,
                        Ile kill them both, for ne're ſhall it be ſaid,
                        That Cnemon knew his fathers bed defil'd
                        And durſt not be reveng'd, aſſiſt my hand
                        Infernall furies, Thisbe lead the way
                        That I may doe the deed ere ſee the day. Exeunt.

                     Enter Ariſtippus and Demeneta.
                     
                        Demen.
                        'Tis late 'ith night, ſweet husband, let's to bed,
                        I cannot have too much of your imbraces,
                        The envious day will interrupt our ſport,
                        Me thinks we married were but yeſterday.
                     
                     
                        Ariſtip.
                        Conceiv'ſt thou ſo, that doth proceed from love;
                        But I am old, and thou a ſprightly laſſe.
                     
                     
                        Demen.
                        You wrong your ſelfe, you are a luſty man,
                        For were you old the dull effects of age
                        Would then appeare, but I have had experience
                        Of your performance, Cnemon, I believe,
                        Your ſonne is not ſo active in his trade.
                     
                     
                        Ariſtip.
                        If it be ſo, then ſure the youthfull heat
                        Of thy faire body hath infuſed life
                        Into my withered vaines, more powerfull then

                     Enter Cnemon with his ſword drawne followed by Thisbe, a candle carried before, he comes haſtily to the bed.
                     
                        Cnem.
                        Where is the villaine, the moſt worthy lover
                        Of this chaſte dame?
                     
                     his father leapes out of the bed, and falls on his knees before him.
                     
                        Ariſtip.
                        My ſonne, have pitty on thy fathers age,
                        Spaire his white haires, take not away his life
                        That gave thee thine, and brought thee up with care,
                        
                           
We doe confeſſe we wrong'd thee, yet the fault
                        Was not ſo great that it ſhould merit death;
                        Aſſwage thy fury, and put up thy ſword,
                        Imbrue not in thy fathers blood thy hands.
                     
                     Cnemon in amaze lookes round about him for Thisby, who had conveyed her ſelfe away, and being thus aſtoniſhed, his ſword fell out of his hand, which Demeneta ſtraightwaies tooke up.
                     
                        Dem.
                        Did I not tell you this before, ſweet heart,
                        To looke unto this princoks pride and hate
                        Who would no doubt, if time had ſerv'd his turne,
                        Attempt ſome miſchiefe to deſtroy us both.
                     
                     
                        Ariſtip.
                        You told me ſo indeed, but I believ'd not;
                        Now I do finde it true, which to prevent
                        I'le raiſe my houſe and bind him faſt, to morrow
                        I'le carry him before the people to
                        Be judg'd for his offence; let nature goe
                        In parents, when ſonnes prove unnaturall ſo. Exeunt.
                        
                     
                  
                  
                     Actus ſecundi, Scena ſexta.
                     Enter Nebulo and Nebulona.
                     
                        Nebulo.
                        
                           Nebulona my pretty chickin, how faires thy body? didſt thou not thinke me loſt long agoe?
                     
                     
                        Nebulona.
                        I gave you for dead in good faith, and was in the humour once to marry another man?
                     
                     
                        Nebulo.
                        Why ſure thea wert not, thou doſt but jeſt I know.
                     
                     
                        Nebulona.
                        Truely I was, nor could you blame me for it if I had; is it not a torture, thinke you, for a woman, to ſtay ſeven yeeres without her husbands company?
                     
                     
                        Nebulo.
                        Methinkes my browes begin Acteon-like to bud already, they are very knotty, I pray God thou haſt not graft ſomething there, I begin to ſuſpect it ſhrewdly by diverſe ſignes and tokens, how comes your belly ſo high wife?
                     
                     
                        Nebulona.
                        'Tis nothing but a timpany I am ſometimes troubled with.
                     
                     
                        Nebulo.
                        I do believe thee, how long is it ſince you perceiv'd it to grow upon you?
                     
                     
                        Nebulona.
                        About two moneths ſince, the Doctor tells me I

ſhal be free of it very ſpeedily.
                     
                     
                        Nebulo.
                        He is a foole, I am a better Doctor then he, thou ſhalt goe with it this foureteene weekes yet or thereabouts; come you are a whore, and have abus'd my honeſt bed; Ile have you before the Juſtices to be puniſh'd for thy offence.
                     
                     
                        Nebulona.
                        Spare me prethee gentle Nebulo, and hearken to my counſell a little, ſince thou art a cuckold (as I doe not deny it) chooſe whether thou wilt weare the hornes in thy forehead, and ſo all men fee them, or put them into thy pocket, and no man ſee them, I leave it to thy owne diſcretion.
                     
                     
                        Nebulo.
                        Why then I am a cuckold it ſeemes?
                     
                     
                        Nebulona.
                        I cannot ſay againſt it truely, and ſpeake the truth, if I ſhould, this marke of thy fortune here deepely ſtamped would bewray me, be not ſo fooliſh now as Vulcan was, to make a proclamation of thy ſorked order.
                     
                     
                        Nebulo.
                        Did 
                              Ʋulcan do ſo?
                     
                     
                        Nebulo.
                        Yes, but afterwards he repented it for he forg'd an artificiall net, with which he caught his wife Venus and Mars a bed together in carnall copulation, then called all the gods and goddeſſes to be ſpectators of his owne ſhame.
                     
                     
                        Nebul.
                        But what ſaid they when they ſaw it?
                     
                     
                        Nebulona.
                        They commended Mars, but condemned 
                              Ʋulcan for being the publiſher of his owne diſgrace.
                     
                     
                        Nebul.
                        But twas a ſhame for Mars to be caught ſo.
                     
                     
                        Nebulona.
                        The gods wiſh'd every one of them if that were a 
                              ••
                           ame to be ſhamed in the ſame manner.
                     
                     
                        Nebulo.
                        but how did Venus take this?
                     
                     
                        Nebulona.
                        In ſcorne of the ſmith and in revenge of this trick hath made his head as hard as his anvile.
                     
                     
                        Nebulo.
                        Thou haſt devis'd a pretty ſtory in thy owne defence, 1'ſt beſt to follow thy counſell, and ſay nothing, or ſtirre this bad thing and make it ſtinke the more?
                     
                     
                        Nebulona.
                        You may do what you pleaſe, but I have told you the beſt courſe.
                     
                     
                        Nebulo.
                        Let it be ſo then; I have travelled well I trow, and to good purpoſe, at my returne home to father a child, of which I did not beget ſo much as the leaſt finger or the leaſt toe; if this be the fruits of travelling, God keepe me from it

hence forward, and all good folkes beſides; come Nebulona we are friends, do ſo no more, and all is forgotten.
                     
                     
                        Nebulon.
                        Not, if you ſtay at home and warme my bed,
                        But if you leave me, then have at your head. Exeunt.

                        The Trojans utter overthrow,
                        but ſtay to Greekiſh hoſt,

                     The ſong ended, enters Theagines Captaine of the Theſſalians, very richly apparelled, followed by many gallants, who guarding him as he went, at laſt encompaſſed him round about; the maides overcome with the beauty of Theagines could not moderate their paſſions but began to caſt flowers and fruit upon him, with that enters Cariclea moſt ſumptuouſly adorned according to the manner, her haire was neither all bound up, nor all looſe, but the moſt part thereof that grew behind, hanged over her ſhoulders; that which grew from the crowne of her head downe to her forehead, being of a yellow colour, was crowned with a garland of young Laurell; in her left hand ſhee bare a guilded Bow and a Quiver of arrowes hanged on her right ſhoulder, and in her other hand ſhe bare a taper burning: after the young men had gone three times about Neoptolemus ſcpulture in their bravery, the women cryed out pittiouſly, &amp; the men made a ſtrange noiſe, with that Theagines ſpeakes to Caricles.

                        The ſacrifice indeed belongs to me,
                        But you ſir, as the Captaine of this charge,
                        And ſacred meſſage, ought to take the taper
                        Of her there, who of all thoſe ceremonies

                     Theagnes takes the taper with a great deale of reverence from the hand of Cariclea, and ſets fire to the Alter, but firſt he was in a maze at the exceeding beauty of Cariclea, and ſhe as much taken with his, then they both ſmiled a little and bluſh'd and then became pale againe: in concluſion he falls in love with her, and ſhe with him.

                        You need not marvell
                        At this, for I believe ſome enuious eye

                        You know I did but what I was commanded,

                        Aſcribe it not to any fault in me,

                        Can poſſibly be found, ſince he that can
                        Eaſe me and none but he, is ſeparated
                        At ſuch a diſtance from me? and beſides

                        Sentence againſt him hath deſtroyd my hopes.
                        I would he had ſuffered death, for then in me
                        Had quenched beene the flames of burning love.
                        Hope that is paſt removes griefe from the heart,
                        And when deſpaire poſſeſſeth troubled minds

                        Sometimes me thinks he comes to me as if
                        
                           
I ſhould enjoy him, othertimes I bend
                        My courſe to him where ere he lives remote;
                        Theſe things enflame me, theſe things make me mad,
                        But O ye gods, I have as I deſerve;
                        Why did I not with good will ſeeke to win him
                        Rather then by deceit and craft compell him?
                        Why did I not moſt humbly ſue unto him
                        Rather then wrong him like an enemy?
                        It may be at the firſt he did deny me
                        For maiden modeſty, and feare to foule
                        His fathers ſheets, but had I perſever'd
                        Unto the end, he might have beene allur'd
                        To condeſcend by faire meanes to my will;
                        But O my Thisbe tell me, tell me quickly
                        What remedy is that thou wouldſt deviſe
                        For me and ſaiſt is eaſie?

                        Why, didſt thou not meane the buſineſſe when thou mention'dſt the point? is it not all one in the ſenſe? I conceive it ſo, elſe thou art more learned than I am.

And told him there was one who us'd to play
                        The lecher with my miſtris, he enrag'd,
                        Thinking that then they were in bed together,

                        They were not at their ſport, he would not heare me.
                        But thinking that I had repented of
                        Bewraying it, ran like a mad man forth

                        How fares my daughter now, what ſickneſſe haſt thou?
                        Shall I ſend for more Doctors yet?
                     
                     
                        Caric.

                        Poſſeſſe her heart, thanks to the gods above▪ 
                           Exeunt.

                     Enter at one doore Theagines, at another Calaſiris.
                     
                        Theag.
                        My worthy friend moſt opportunely met.
                     
                     
                        Calaſi.
                        What, beautifull Theagines!
                        
                     
                     
                        Theag.
                        How can he
                        Be beautifull that pleaſeth not Cariclea?
                        
                     
                     
                        Calaſir.
                        No more, you make me angrie thus to doubt
                        My skill by which ſhe is entrap'd in love.
                        And longs to ſee you.
                     
                     
                        Theag.
                        What is that you ſay?
                        Doth faire Cariclea wiſh to ſee me father?
                        Why doe you then detaine me here, and not
                        Conduct me to her? Theagines offers to run forth, Calaſiris catcheth him by the cloake, and holds him faſt.
                        
                     
                     
                        Calaſ.
                        Nay ſir ſtay a while,
                        Though you are very nimble of your feet,
                        You muſt not thinke this matter muſt be handled
                        As if it were a prize for every man

                        Know you not that her father Caricles
                        
                        Is the chiefe man in Delphos? that the lawes

                        The matter were not great although I dy'd
                        After I had enjoyed Cariclea,
                        
                        Death for her ſake is life, but Calaſiris
                        
                        If you thinke good, let us demand her of
                        Old Caricles her father for my wife,

                        We ſhall not ſpeed,
                        Not that he thinkes you any way unworthy,

                        By him in marriage.
                     
                     
                        Theag.
                        O ye gods above,
                        It cannot be, nor ſhall it by your leaves,

                        This hand is not benum'd, nor this ſword blunt
                        But it can take revenge.

                        Farewell reverend Father. Exit Theagenes.
                        
                     
                     Enter Caricles.
                     
                        So efficacious is your wiſdome ſir,

                        Upon me by the gods, but where I know not.
                        The Oracle is myſticall and darke,
                        I cannot well interpret what it meanes,

                     If I could by any meanes get the Faſcia now, which was laid out with Cariclea, wherein Caricles ſaid he heard all the maids eſtate was notified, I ſhould be inſtructed more particularly what I ought to doe, and whether the Ladies of deſtiny would ſend us. Enter Caricles.

                        O Cariclea,
                        
                        Unhappy maid, why doſt thou wrongfully
                        Accuſe thy ſelfe, and draw on death upon thee?
                        Heare me right grave and moſt impartiall Judges,
                        There is no fault in her, I onely, I

                        Which was prepared for this vertuous mayd
                        By that old beldame, this is true, or elſe

                        Old Cibile my miſtris did prepare
                        This cup for faire Cariclea, I was forc'd
                        To have a hand in't too; when I ſhould give

                        Thus it was,
                        After we were condemned to be burnt
                        By foule Arſaces ſlanderous report
                        For poiſoning Cibile, a blazing fire
                        Was made, and we two caſt into the ſame,

                        Commanded the tormentors to lay on
                        More wood and reed, yet all prevailed not,

                        But then, how was't that Aura periſh'd not?
                        She had no Pantarbe to defend han.

                        This is probable;

                        This was a favour we expected not;

                        Of this rare Architecture, built by nature,

To adde more beautie to it then it hath?
                        Nothing, I know you'll grant it, then what pitty

                        But whence are you, and of what countrey borne?

                        Haſt given us ſuch faire offerings to preſent

                        Unto my queſtion?

                        At the ſacred altars
                        Of the immortall gods (to whom we are
                        Reſerv'd for ſacrifices) you ſhall know
                        Me and my parents.

                        O ſir, what a mayd
                        Have you appointed to be ſacrific'd?
                        Ne're have mine eyes beheld a fairer creature;
                        With what a ſtout and an undaunted courage
                        Beares ſhe her fortune? I am mov'd with pity
                        At her ſo flowring age, O had my daughter
                        I bare unto you liv'd, ſhe would have beene
                        Almoſt as old as ſhe, I doe beſeech you
                        Spare her, and let her ſerve me at my table,
                        For I am prompted ſtrangely by my Genius
                        Unto commiſeration.

                        So am I,
                        Beyond imagination, but you know
                        The Law requires the firſt fruits of the warre
                        Should be the gods oblation, to the Sunne
                        Therefore we'll offer him, ſhe to the Moone,
                        The gods muſt be obey'd, the lawes fulfil'd.
                        They all offer to riſe, Cariclea fals at the feet of Syſimethres.

                        Wiſe, grave, and learned ſir, be pleas'd to ſtay
                        A little longer, for I have a cauſe
                        Of conſequence to plead before the King
                        And Queene Perſina, which concernes them too
                        Aſwell as me, this matter doth require
                        A ſpeedy judgment, and I heare that you
                        Give ſentence on ſuch noble perſonager;
                        Therefore judge you this plea of life and death,
                        And know it is not juſt to offer me
                        Unto the gods.

                        Hydaſp.
                        What judgement may this be? or what have I
                        To doe with her? by what meanes ſhould I come
                        Into her danger?

                        But take heed that this
                        You doe, be no true judgment, but plaine wrong,

How much better had it beene to have ſought not to the Phyſitians, but to the Lord. Which I would not have ſo taken as if Phyſitians were not at all in any caſe to be ſought unto; but to ſhew that it is much better to neglect all means, then to neglect the Lord who giveth a bleſſing to all the means that are at any time of any uſe. Warrantable meanes may lawfully, muſt conſcionably be uſed: but uſed as the hand of Gods providence, whereby he doth whatſoever good thing is done by them.

                         extrimity is Gods opportunity. Then, even then eſpecially is God ready to helpe when men are at the loweſt. To paſſe over thoſe inſtances which are mentioned before § 39. there are two proverbes aſod in scripture which give good proofe to this point.

Abraham in obedience to the Lords charge went on whither the Lord appointed him, with a full reſolution to do what he was commanded to do. Three daies was he in journying to the place: and at length came to the top of a mount, where he built an altar, laid the wood in order, bound Iſaac, laid him thereon, tooke a knife, and ſtretched out his hand Quantum ad vo l

                     to ſlay his ſonne. Thus in his intent he had ſlaine and ſacrificed his ſonne. In all this time did not God ſhew any mind or meanes to ſave Iſaac: but even then, when there was ſcarce a ſtep betwixt him and death, the Lord ſhewed himſelfe, and declared his pleaſure for preſerving Iſaac. Now becauſe it was on a mount where Iſaac was thus neare unto death, and that on the mount, and not before, God ſhewed himſelfe for the preſervation of Iſaac, thence aroſe this proverbe, In the mount will the Lord be ſeene. And to be an evidence to all future ages of Gods wiſdome in affording his help at the laſt caſt, the Holy Ghoſt prefixeth this clauſe, as it is ſaid to this day.

                        . 3. The other proverbe is this, The children are come to the birth▪ and there is no ſtrength to bring forth. By this proverb Ieruſalem being ſo beſieged by the King of Aſſyria, as there was (in regard of humane helps, little hope of deliverance,

is compared to a woman great with child, in paine of travell: the Inhabitants of the city are reſembled to the children in the mothers wombe: the extremity of diſtreſſe wherein they were, to the difficulty and danger of travell. Such then was their caſe, as the caſe of a woman, which, having a weake child not able to helpe it ſelfe, is ſpent with paine and travell, and hath no midwife, nor any other meanes of helpe. Were they not now brought even to uttermoſt extremity. In this extremity, when they were ſo low brought, the Lord helped them. 
                     2 King 19. 35.
                  
                  The helpe that in ſuch extremities is afforded, manifeſtly appeareth to be from God. When the Egyptians obſerved the ſuccour which was afforded to the Iſraelites in the midſt of the Red Sea, they ſaid, The Lord fighteth for them. Thus Exo 14 25.is God the more honoured by reſerving himſelfe to ſuch extremities.
                  In extremities ſuccour is much more welcome, much better accepted, more highly prized, and mans heart more affected and enflamed therwith. When the Iſraelites were ſafely Pſal. 106. 9, 12.
                     led thorow the depths, then they ſang the Lords praiſes.
                  
                  Is there not now great and juſt reaſon that God ſhould take this opportunity to helpe?
                  1. Wait therefore to the very uttermoſt of an extremity.  This being the moſt ſeaſonable time for God to helpe, moſt Admonition to wait.meet it is that we ſhould tarry the Lords leaſure, and wait for his ſeaſon. This the Prophet noteth to be a property of true faith, He that beleeueth maketh not haſte▪
                      He ſeeketh Iſa. 28 16.not to preuent the time appointed of the Lord. If the Lord tarry, the beleever will wait. He well knoweth that there is Hab. 2. 3.an appointed time, which cannot be prevented, which ſhall not be overſlipt. For the Lord will take his opportunity.

                     DƲe obſeruation of Gods mercy to others maketh men in like caſes to acknowledge Gods mercy to them. This was it that moved the Prophet to ſay, that when he was brought low, the Lord ſaved him, becauſe he had duly obſerued how the Lord preſerved the ſimple. Well note the formes of praiſe that are recorded in Scripture, and you ſhall find it vſuall with the Saints to relate Gods accuſtomed dealing with others to be ſuch as it was with them. To omit the many Pſalmes of David that are pertinent to this purpoſe, 1 Sam. 2. 1, &amp;c. Luk. 1. 46, &amp;cthe two hymnes of Annah, and the Virgin Mary give good proofe hereof.
                  
                     Inſtruction in the benefit of obſerving Gods dealing with others, &amp; applying it to our ſelves. Men ordinarily behold Gods dealing with others, with a ſingle eye, whereby they are ſo convinced of the verity and equity of that which they ſee, as they cannot but acknowledge the like, (when the like falleth out) in their owne caſe.
                  Behold here what good we may gaine to our ſelves by

taking notice of the divine properties as they are exerciſed on others. Few or none can ſo well diſcerne the evidences of Gods providence and mercy, or of his juſtice, jealouſie, and diſpleaſure in themſelves as in others. Objects brought too neare to the eye, cannot be diſtinctly and clearely diſcerned. Selfe-love dimmes mens ſight in their owne caſe. When others partake of any good thing, we can ſoone ſay, O how good is God unto them. When judgements are executed on others, we are ready to aſcribe it to the juſtice of the Lord. Well: ſeeing we are ſo forward to diſcerne Gods dealing in other mens caſes, let us make good uſe of this our diſpoſition, and do ſo ſtill, that hereby we may be brought to the minde of this holy man: and finding the Lord to deale with others, as he doth with us, acknowledge as much: and that as in works of judgement, to be humbled the more; ſo in works of mercy, to be provoked to more hearty thankfulneſſe: as we ſhalbe, when in truth, and on juſt ground we can ſay, The Lord that ſheweth mercy to them that are in miſery, was very mercifull to me when I was in miſerie.

                  Here it is taken in the latter reſpect, as oppoſed to inward trouble and anguiſh, as is evident by the relation it hath to his ſoule. It importeth an aſſurance of Gods favour to him, and tranquillity of mind, and peace of conſcience thence ariſing.
                  This reſt he calleth his ſoules, becauſe it was a reſt wherein his ſoule had ſolaced her ſelfe before: which the Lord having given, he ſweetly and quietly enioyed as his owne.
                  But it ſeemeth that his bitter affliction had bereaved him of it: and therefore as to a right loſt, and recovered againe, he ſaith

                     Returne. For this is the very word which the Angell uſeth to Hagar, when ſhe fled from her miſtreſſe, Gen. 16 9.
                     Returne. As Hagar thorow her miſtreſſes rough dealing with her fled from her: ſo the ſoule of this Prophet by reaſon of affliction fell from her former quiet confidence in God. As the Angell therefore biddeth Hagar, returne to her miſtreſſe, ſo the underſtanding of this Prophet biddeth his ſoule returne to her rest.

                      Very elegant and emphaticall is this manner of the Prophets directing his ſpeech to his Soule, as to another perſon, thus, O my ſoule. Hereby his vnderſtanding well enlightned, and reſolved of Gods favour to him, ſtirreth up his will, conſcience, heart and affections to be quieted, and no longer perplexed and troubled with doubts and feares about Gods wrath, but to reſt aſſured of his love and favour.
                  To ſhew what good ground there was for his ſoule to repoſe it ſelfe quietly in the Lord, headdeth, For the Lord hath dealt bountifully with thee. The firſt particle being a cauſall particle, FOR, ſheweth that this is added as a reaſon of that which went before. The reaſon is taken from the manifeſtation of Gods fauour to him: and it may thus be framed.
                  He with whom the Lord dealeth bountifully may well rest on the Lord.

                  To inferre any matter of merit on mans part, becauſe a word that ſometimes ſignifieth to repay, is attributed to God in relation to man, is too ſandy a foundation for ſuch a lofty Babel.
                  To take occaſion from hence to ſet out the bountie of the Lord, would be too impertinent. The word doth indefinitely ſet downe the grace, favour, mercy, or goodneſſe of the Lord, without any particular or diſtinct reſpect to extraordinary liberality and bounty.

It is a peace which they have in Chriſt, (Ioh. 16. 33.) a peace with God, (Rom. 5. 1.) a peace of God that paſſeth all vnderſtanding, that keepeth mens hearts andminds (Phil. 4. 7.) a peace and joy in the Holy Ghost, oppoſed to meate and drinke, (Rom. 14. 17.) A peace of conſcience: For, a good and quiet conſcience is the bed of the ſoule, in which it ſweetly and quietly reſteth.

                     The Lord ſcourgeth every ſonne that he receiveth. All are partakers of chaſtiſement.

                     God is faithfull who will not ſuffer his to be tempted above that they are able to heare. As Mar 2. 27.
                     Christ ſaid of the Sabbath, I may ſay of the afflictions of Saints. Afflictions are for the Saints, and not the Saints for afflictions. Therefore God correcteth us Heb 12. 10.
                     for our profit: and from thence iſſueth —11.

                     that are exerciſed thereby. The aſſiſtance, comfort, peace, and joy which God giveth even in troubles and afflictions, miniſtreth juſt cauſe for us all to ſay, 2 Cor. 4. 8, 9.
                     We are troubled on every ſide, yet not distreſſed: we are perplexed, but not in deſpaire: perſecuted, but not forſaken: caſt downe, but not destroyed. This is the benefit of ſpirituall reſt, that temporall troubles do not diſturbe the ſame. If any be diſquieted, and unſetled (as we heard before ſome might be) it is their owne weakeneſſe. They have a reſt to returne unto ordained, revealed by God: whereunto when they recall their ſpirit, they will returne as here the Prophet doth. If thus there be peace and reſt to Saints in times of trialls and troubles, inward peace, ſpirituall reſt in outward trialls, and temporall troubles, who can doubt of their reſt in halcyon, in quiet and peaceable times, when there is nothing to diſturbe the ſame. The world is altogether ignorant of this peace. If they had a true and due underſtanding thereof, their mouthes would not be ſo opened as they are againſt Saints by reaſon of their troubles.
                  
                     Information in the difference betwixt Saints and worldlings. 2. Take notice hereby of the difference betwixt the condition  of beleevers and unbeleevers, ſervants of the Lord, and ſlaves of the Devill. They have their reſt: a reſt that may ſtand with externall unquietneſſe. Though in body, and in outward eſtate they may ſeeme to have no reſt: though in that reſpect they may be thought, Mat. 8. 20.as Chriſt, to be in a worſe caſe then foxes, that have▪holes, and birds of the aire that have neſts, becauſe they have not where to reſt their head: yet have they a reſt for their ſoule: a reſt that refreſheth and ſolaceth both ſoule and body. But it is otherwiſe with the wicked. The wicked are like the troubled ſea, when it cannot rest, whoſe waters cast up mire and dirt. There is no peace, ſaith my God, to the wicked, Iſay. 57. 20, 21. Though they have health of body, and all outward proſperitie, though by reaſon thereof they ſay (as the rich foole did Luke 12. 19.) to their ſoule, Take thine eaſe, eate, drinks, and

                      outward. They ſeeme to have reſt, and to enjoy quiet. But that is no reſt where the ſoule is reſtleſſe. That is no peace of mind, where the mind is troubled with ſtings of a guilty conſcience. Their conſcience is like to the fore-mentioned troubled ſea. If they feele it not, it is becauſe they are intoxicated, and made ſenſleſſe, as the drunkard that lieth downe in the midſt of the ſea, or upon the top of a maſt, and feeleth nothing, Prev. 23. 34, 35.

                  IIII. § 43.
                     SEnſe of Gods favour is the ground of Saints reſt. After▪ the Prophet had expoſtulated with his ſoule about her unquietneſſe, he gave this advice, Pſal. 42. 11.—43. 5.
                     hope in God, as the onely meanes of ſetling his ſoule. Faith is it that perſwadeth the ſoule of Gods favour: hence is it that Rom. 5. 1.
                     being juſtified by faith we have peace with God. Yea becauſe this peace relieth on Gods favour, it is called Phil. 4. 7.
                     the peace of God. When David was in one of the moſt deſperate diſtreſſes that ever befell him, it is ſaid, that 1 Sam. 30. 6.
                     he encouraged himſelfe in the Lord his God. The aſſurance that he had of Gods favour, and confidence that the Lord was his God, ſupported him, and moved him to reſt thereon. Many are the Metaphors which to this end are applied to God, as

                  1. Nothing can ſatisfie the ſoules of Saints but Gods favour. They find all other things to be Ecl. 1. &amp; 2.
                     vanitie and vexation of ſpirit. Whereas therefore others ſay, Pſal. 4. 6.
                     Who will ſhew us any good, Saints ſay LOrd lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us.
                  
                  2. Gods favour is that proper place whither a ſoule well enlightned and rectified (as the ſoules of the Saints are) aſpireth. Now nothing reſteth till it comes to its proper place. Inſtance light things that flie upward, and heavy things that fall downeward.
                  
                     Pſal. 42. 1, 2. 3. The uttermoſt end, wherunto the Saints referre all their endeavours is to be accepted of God. All things which adviſedly they do, are but as means for attaining to that end. Now till men attaine to that maine end at which they aime, they cannot thinke of a perpetuall reſt. A traveller hath no ſetled reſt till he come to his journeyes end: nor a mariner, nor a ſouldier, nor any other that propoſeth a weighty end to himſelfe.

                      3. For gaining ſuch aſſurance of Gods favour as may make thee reſt ſecurely therein, obſerve theſe rules.
                  1. Acquaint thy ſelfe with Gods promiſes, which are the onely true ſure ground of faith and confidence. For Gods promiſes are declarations of Gods favour towards man: what God promiſeth, man may ſafely reſt upon. It Pſal. 119 49.was Gods promiſe whereof David thus ſaith, 
                        Ʋpon it thou haſt cauſed me to hope.
                  
                  2. Meditate ſeriouſly and frequently on Gods properties,

as on his grace, mercy, truth, power, &amp;c. This meditation See The Whole Armour of God Treat. 2. Part 6 §. 25, &amp;c.added to faith in Gods promiſes, wilbe as oyle put into a lamp, which will continue the life and light of it. Verſ 5. §. 26The forementioned deſcription of God by his divine properties ſheweth that the faith of this Prophet in Gods favour was nouriſhed thereby.
                  3. Obſerve Gods former dealing with thee: and call to mind ſuch evidences of his favour as he hath ſhewed to thee in former times. This will give thee evidence of his preſent good-will towards thee: for whom he once loveth Ioh. 13. 1. Ier. 31. 3. Iſa. 49 14, &amp;che ever loveth; he loveth his with an everlaſting love. When Zion ſaid, The Lord hath forſaken me, and my Lord hath forgotten me, this anſwer was replied, Can a woman forget her ſucking child, &amp;c? Yea they may forget, yet will not I forget thee, &amp;c. ſaith the Lord.
                  4. When thy affections are much prone to heavineſſe, and thy heart much miſgiveth thee (as we ſpeake) by reaſon of doubts and feares, let thy judgement grounded on Gods Word and Promiſes ſupport thee. A right underſtanding of Gods promiſes are of force to keep an heavy ſpirit from ſinking. A mans judgement well informed, will convince his affections of folly when they make doubt of Gods favour, and ſo bring them to yeeld to that which it conceiveth to be truth.

                     Anſ. 1. By putting difference betwixt the underſtanding and affections. The underſtanding is in man as a miſtreſſe, the affections are as hand-maidens. The miſtreſſe may ſee that to be very meet to be done which the hand-maidens are loth to doe, and thereupon quicken them.
                  2. By diſtinguiſhing betwixt the ſpirit and fleſh. Mat. 26. 41.
                     The ſpirit is oft willing when the fleſh is weake. Yea when Rom 7. 22, 23.
                     the inward man delighteth in the law of God, the outward man

                     warreth againſt it. Now all theſe being in man, when the underſtanding inciteth the affections, and the ſpirit driveth away the heavineſſe of the fleſh, man is ſaid to ſtirre up himſelfe.
                  
                     Direction for counſelling ones ſelfe. Learne here how beneficiall a man may be to himſelfe: how he may inſtruct, direct, encourage, and comfort himſelfe: namely by well uſing that light of underſtanding which God giveth him, and by applying that wherein he is well informed to himſelfe. On this ground when we are tempted to a ſinne, when we find paſſion, pride, luſt, or any other corruption beginning to ariſe in us, let us make our caſe to be anothers caſe, and by our underſtanding reaſon with our ſoules as if they were other perſons: and what we would in ſuch caſes ſay to others, let us ſay to our owne ſoules, as the Pſalmiſt, Why art thou diſquieted O my ſoule?

                      And here, returne unto thy rest, O my ſoule. Many that much doubt, and even deſpaire themſelves, can produce ſound grounds to move others to be confident in God, which if they would preſſe upon their owne ſoules, they might be much quickened thereby. They can tell others, that when God ſeemes to hide himſelfe, it is but a cloud that keepeth away the brightneſſe of Gods favour, which ſhall be driven away, and therefore they ought to hope and waite. They can tell others, that temptations to ſin muſt be reſiſted, and that by reſiſting of them, they will be vanquiſhed. They can ſet a catalogue of promiſes before others in their conflicts, and bee plentifull and powerfull in perſwading others to bounden duties, and diſſwading them from diſgracefull vices. If thus they would deale with themſelves, what good might they do to themſelves? Thus ſhould they neuer want (no not when they are moſt retired, moſt private, even by themſelves alone) an inſtructer, a directer, a counſeller, a comforter. And no counſeller, no comforter can be more powerfull with a mans ſoule, then himſelfe.

                  PSAL. CXVI. VIII.
                  For thou hast delivered my ſoule from death, mine eyes from teares and my feet from falling.
                  THe forementioned kindneſſe of God is here particularly exemplified by the deliverance which God gave him from his diſtreſſe.
                  How his ſoule may be ſaid to be delivered hath beene before ſhewed on verſ. 4. §. 24.
                  
                     Metonymia effecti. 
                     Death is here put for ſuch a deſperate diſtreſſe as threatned death. In the caſe wherein he was (to uſe the Apoſtles 2 Cor. 1. 8, 9.phraſe) he deſpaired even of life: he had the ſentence of death in himſelfe: and thus God who raiſeth the dead delivered him from a great death. The words therefore are not literally to be taken of a miraculous raiſing from death: but his diſtreſſe is In abſtracto.thus by this word, death, ſet out to aggravate his danger, and to amplifie Gods deliverance. Hereof ſee more on Verſ. 3. §. 15.
                  The teares of his eyes are here mentioned to ſhew how he was affected with that affliction. Teares are outward effects and ſignes of inward anguiſh. When Ieruſalem was caried captive into a ſtrange land, Lam. 1. 2.
                     She wept ſore in the night: her teares were on her cheeks. Yea Chriſt (who with the nature of our infirmities, Heb. 4. 15.aſſumed the infirmities of our nature, yet without ſinne) had in his bitter agony —5. 7.
                     teares forced from his eyes.
                  Gods delivering of this Prophets eyes from teares, implieth a removall of that diſtreſſe whereof theſe teares were
                        •
                      ſigne: with which his ſoule was ſo troubled, as his eyes guſhed out with teares: ſo as the Metonymia Effecti vel Adiuncti.
                     effect or ſigne, is here put for the cauſe.
                  
                  
                     Falling of his feet, doth yet further aggravate the diſtreſſe.

The word tranſlated 
                        
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        
                     
                     falling, ſignifieth ſuch a violent forcing of one as he cannot ſtand: as where it is ſaid Pſal. 118

                     in forcing thou haſt forced me to fall. Now feet are the ſupporters of a body: when they fall, downe fals all the body. Hereby is declared, that the violence of his affliction was ſuch, as like a boiſterous ſtorme it was enough in his beſt ſtrength to overthrow him: and it alſo ſo waſted his ſtrength and weakned him, as he could not ſtand, but was ready againe and againe to fall: it foiled him exceedingly. By removing that affliction God delivered his feet from falling. But this is ſpoken in an Allegory. For, by his feet are meant his ſpirit, by falling, the fainting thereof. So as his very ſoule was preſerved from being overwhelmed.

                      Some diſtinguiſh the three particulars thus, He hath delivered my ſoule from death, by giving me a good conſcience: mine eyes from teares, by giving a quiet and a good conſcience: my feet from ſliding, by giving a ſecure conſcience.
                  This is the Exemplification of the motive mentioned in the latter clauſe of the former verſe.
                  Herein note,
                  1. The Manner of expreſſing it.
                  2. The Matter whereof it conſiſteth.
                  The Manner is by 
                        
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        
                     a direct turning of his ſpeech to God, thus, Thou hast, &amp;c.
                  The Matter conſiſteth in a particular Enumeration of the deliverances which God gave him. So as here is expreſſed
                  1. The Author of his deliverances. Thou.
                  
                  2. The Kinds thereof. And theſe are three.
                  
                     1. His ſoule from death.
                  
                     2. His eyes from teares.
                  
                     3. His feet from falling.
                  For the Manner. In the former verſe he ſpake of the Lord in the third perſon, thus, The Lord hath dealt bountifully with thee: but here to the Lord in the ſecond perſon, thou haſt delivered: which implieth a familiarity. The apprehenſion of Gods bounty had quickned his ſpirit, and made him in a reverend manner the more bold: ſo as,
                  
                     
                     1. By a due conſideration of Gods favour to us we are made more familiar with God.
                  This Prophets thus ſpeaking to God, Thoù haſt delivered, ſheweth that,
                  
                     2. Deliverances are to be aſcribed to God.
                  The firſt kind of deliverance, my ſoule from death, giveth evidence that,
                  
                     3. God can deliver from the power of death.
                  The ſecond kind of deliverance, mine eyes from teares, implieth two points. One intended, the other expreſſed.
                  
                     4. Saints may be much affected with afflictions.
                  
                     5. God can remove all matter of mourning.
                  The third kind of deliverance, My feet from falling, importeth alſo two points, viz.
                  
                  
                     6. Great diſtreſſes may foile Saints.
                  
                     7. God eſtabliſheth ſuch as are ready to fall.
                  The fit applying of deliverances to the diſtinct diſtreſſes, as ſoule or life from death: eyes from teares: feet from falling, demonſtrateth that,
                  
                     8. Gods remedy is anſwerable to mans neceſſity.

                  Manifeſtation of Gods favour worketh faith: the more that the evidences thereof are pondered, the more ſtrength gathereth ſaith. Meditation on Gods good-will to us, is to

faith as a ſeaſonable ſupply of oile to a lampe, which continueth to preſerve the light thereof. Now Eph. 3. 12.
                     by faith we have boldneſſe and acceſſe with confidence: and the ſtronger faith, the more boldneſſe.
                  O let not any evidence of Gods kindneſſe paſſe by without due notice taken thereof. Doe in this caſe with God, as 1 King. 20. 33
                     the ſervants of the King of Syria did with the King of Iſrael, diligently obſerve whether any thing come from him, that may demonſtrate his good-will to thee. Thus maiſt thou gaine aſſurance that thou art in the number of 2 Chro. 20. 7. Iſa. 41. 8. Cant. 5. 1.

As wiſe favourites therefore are in a reverend manner familiar with their Soveraigne, ſo may ſuch as know the Lords mind, be with him, and have free entrance into his preſence, and aſſurance of gracious acceptance. A great priviledge.

                  All deliverances are wrought by God. Whatſoever the inſtrumentall meanes be, he is the principall efficient and author As he is the Creator of all things, ſo the Governour, the diſpoſer and orderer of all. And all creatures in the world are his ſervants, his inſtruments uſed by him, according to his will. If therefore by any right victory be aſcribed, not to the munition, but to the Generall: recovery of health, not to the potion, but to the Phyſitian: good-workmanſhip, not to the materialls or tooles, but to the Artificer: by much more right, victory, recovery, all deliverances,

all bleſſings are to be aſcribed to God, who enableth Generalls, Phyſitians, and all others to do what they do, and giveth all efficacy to the means that are any way effectuall. It is therefore moſt juſt and equall that that which is done by God be aſcribed to him. His right it is, and ſhall he not have his right? Will ſubjects deale ſo unjuſtly with their King, ſouldiers with their Generall, ſervants with their maſter?
                  
                     Reprehenſion of ſuch as aſcribe deliverances to any but to God. Fie on them therefore that either take no notice at all of ſuch deliverances as they have, or els impute them to any other then to God: whether it be to themſelves, to other men, to any ſecondary cauſes, to fortune, or to any thing els. Three ſorts of men do eſpecially offend herein. Dan. 5. 22, 23
                     Idolaters, that aſcribe Gods due to Idols. Act 24. 2.
                     Flatterers, that attribute it to men. Iſa. 10 8. &amp;c. Act. 12. 23.
                     Ambitious perſons that take it to themſelves. Two great evills are thus committed. The Creator is robbed of his due. To creatures is given more then their due. He the onely true God is eſteemed as no God. They that are Gen. 49. 6.no Gods are accounted as Gods. O my ſoule, come not thou into their ſecret: unto their aſſembly mine honour be not thou united.
                  
                  
                     Exhortation to give God his due. Be rather of the communion of Saints, whoſe underſtanding being rightly informed in the extent of the divine providence, wherby every good thing that is wrought, is wrought, they are ſo in their hearts affected therewith as they cannot conceale the ſame, but make their tongues their glory in acknowledging and making known what God hath done to their ſoules. This, though it be moſt due to God, yet he accepts it as a kindnes, as an honour done to him. And in teſtimony of his gracious acceptance of this gratefull remembrance, he will afterward on other occaſions be ready to deliver. Si D

                  1. In ſuch caſes as threaten death: wherein men have cauſe to feare death; as the Iſraelites had when Pharaoh with a mighty hoſte purſued them, and they had no way to fly but thorow the ſea, (Exod. 14. 2, &amp;c.) and againe when they were beſieged by the Syrians, 2 King. 6. 24, &amp;c.
                  2. When death hath begun to lay hold and to ceaze upon them, as 1 Sam. 17. 34.a lion and a beare did upon the lambs which David kept. Thus it ſeemeth that death had ceazed on 2 Cor. 1. 8.
                     Paul, and on 2 King. 20. 1.
                     Hezekiah, who notwithſtanding were both delivered.
                  3. When there is no poſſibility of avoiding death by any ordinary meanes. Thus was Ion 1. 17.
                     Ionah delivered out of the ſea, and Dan. 3. 26.
                     Shadrach, Meſhach, and Abednego out of the hot fiery fornace. Iſa. 43. 2.God hath promiſed to be with his in fire and water: in moſt deſperate diſtreſſes.
                  4. When they are in the very power of death, and death actually ceazed upon them, and deprived them of life. Hereof we have many inſtances both in the 1 King 17. 22 2 King. 4. 35.—13.

                     Conſolation in all diſtreſſes 1. Admirable is the comfort which hence ariſeth to ſuch as being well inſtructed in the power of God, can in aſſurance of faith reſt on him, as 1 Sam. 30. 6.
                     David did, who, when he knew not whither on earth to flie for ſuccour, encouraged
                     
                     himſelfe in the Lord his God. For, nothing can befall us without the limits of his power: no danger can happen, out of which he is not able to deliver us.
                  
                     How Gods power is to be reſted upon. 
                     Quest. May Saints in confidence expect any deliverance that God is able to give?
                  
                     Anſw. Not ſimply: but with a willing ſubjection of themſelves to his will: as they who ſaid, Dan. 3. 17.
                     Our God whom we ſerve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us from thine hand, O King: But if not, be it knowne to thee, O King, that we will not ſerve thy gods. Herein then lieth the comfort which ariſeth from Gods power, that our God who is able to deliver us, will deliver us, if in his wiſdome he ſee deliverance fit for us. Sorites.For thus we may ſafely conclude.
                  What God ſeeth to be good for us, he will do.
                  What God will do, he can do.
                  What God can and will do, ſhall be done.
                  
                     Admonition in all ſtraits to reſt on God. 
                     Therefore, what God ſeeth to be good for us, ſhalbe done.
                  Iuſt cauſe is here given unto us of looking to God, when death preſents it ſelfe before our eyes: and to ſay unto him, 2 Chro 20 12
                     We know not what to doe: but our eyes are upon thee. Caſt not therefore thine eyes too much downeward. Fixing eyes aright on God, worketh faith.

                     the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort, his bowels are moved at the ſight of his childrens teares, as it is noted of Chriſt, Ioh 11. 33, 35
                     When he ſaw Mary weeping, and the Iewes alſo weeping, he groaned in the ſpirit, and was troubled, and wept. And againe Luk. 7 13.when he ſaw a widow weepe, he had compaſſion on her. Vpon that compaſſion he tooke away the occaſion of her weeping. When God came to deliver Iſrael from the Egyptian bondage, he renders this reaſon of his

purpoſe, Exo 3. 7.
                     I have ſurely ſeene the affliction of my people which are in Egypt, and have heard their crie, by reaſon of their task masters: for I know their ſorrowes. Yea further to demonſtrate the notice which the Lord taketh of his Saints teares, there is in Scripture mention made of Pſal. 56. 8.
                     a bottle wherein they are put, as a liquor moſt precious in Gods account: and of a booke wherein they are regiſtred, as things to be reviewed, and not forgotten.

                     Sorrow not as others which have no hope. Know that God taketh notice of thy teares: believe that God can and will wipe them away. Believe this when ſenſe and ſmart of affliction makes thee weepe and waile: but eſpecially when with a deepe apprehenſion of thy ſinnes againſt God, and of his diſpleaſure againſt thee, thou doeſt, as Mat. 26. 75.
                     Peter did, weepe bitterly. In theſe and other like caſes thou maiſt, and muſt pray, as the Pſalmiſt did, and ſay, Pſal. 39. 12.
                     O Lord give eare unto my cry, hold not thy peace at my teares. For aſſuredly he that putteth teares into his bottle and regiſtreth them, will wipe all tears from thine eyes. What he hath done to others, thou being like to them, in like caſes, maiſt expect. For, God ever remaineth like himſelfe.

To lift up theſe is to rouſe up our ſpirits, and to quicken them. The danger which otherwiſe may follow upon fainting, much enforceth the exhortation. For theſe words, leaſt that which is lame be turned out of the way, imply that upon fainting may follow a falling away. A freſh-water-ſouldier once fainting, ſoone falls to the enemy. Let us therefore well looke to our ſtanding, and well prepare our ſelves before hand. The Apoſtle giveth an excellent direction to this purpoſe, Eph. 6. S

                  Is the forementioned weakneſſe of Saints, and proneneſſe to fall well weighed of them, who by reaſon of ſome gifts beſtowed on them, wax inſolent and ſecure? Surely this is one uſe which is to be made of Saints fals, that no man boaſt himſelf of his owne good deeds, when he beholdeth the ſtorms of ſuch men to be taken heed of, and wrecks to be bewailed.

                     doth pity and mercy moſt brightly ſhew it ſelfe, when in falling a man is preſerved, ſo as if then he had not been preſerued, he had periſhed. Thus e Chriſt ſhewed his pity in ſaving Peter, even when he began to ſinke, (Mat. 14. 30, 31.) This then muſt needs be a principall part of prudence. In theſe and other like reſpects God is ſo ready to uphold him that is falling, and to hold him that is departing, that he may ſeeme to mind ſuch alone, and to leave all others.
                  1. Deſpaire not now, though thy foot be ſlipping, or thou ſinking in a ſea of ſorrowes. God is as neare at hand in all out troubles, as Mat. 14. 30, 31
                     Chriſt was in that ſea where Peter was. As a tender mother, though ſhe ſuffer her weake and feeble child to go alone, yet will ſhe not ſuffer it to be alone or out of ſight. If it ſlide, or fall, ſhe preſently catcheth it up againe. Yea ſhe will give her ſervants charge over it to keepe it, and to take it up in caſe it fall. Thus deales thy heavenly Father with thee, poore, weake, feeble brat. Pſal. 121. 3.
                     He will not ſuffer thy foot to be moved (namely to thy ruine;) He that keepeth thee will not ſlumber. And leſt thou ſhouldſt think that by reaſon of his greatneſſe he will not take care of thee, He giveth his Angells charge over thee, to keepe thee in all thy waies. They

                      When their enemies infeſted them, he overthrew thoſe enemies. According to all their needs he afforded them fit helpe.

Endeavour to allay the paſſion of ſuch as are in paſſion: raiſe up thoſe that are fallen. Inſtruct the ignorant: bring into the way of truth ſuch as wander. Comfort ſuch as are troubled in conſcience. Herein lieth a maine difference betwixt a skilfull Phyſitian and a deceitfull Emperick. The Phyſitian enquireth after the kind of diſeaſe, conſtitution of perſon, temperature of climate, ſeaſon of yeare, and anſwerably preſcribeth his remedy. The Empirick gives his remedy without any reſpect to the forenamed reſpects. If it do any good, then its well: if it do none, it was all that he could do: and by that all, many more receive hurt then good by his his preſcripts. To be an Emperick about the maladies that affect the ſoule, and endanger the eternall ſalvation thereof, is inſufferable. Do therefore good: do it, as David did, According to the integrity of thine heart, by the skilfulneſſe of 
                     Pſal. 78. 72.
                     thine hands. For which end pray for wiſdome of him that is wiſdome it ſelf: that ſo thou maiſt be perfect as he is perfect.

                  I will walke before the Lord in the land of the living.
                  THe Prophets See § 2, 43.
                     proteſtation for his outward converſation is here generally propounded.
                  This phraſe I will walke, is taken diverſly. Some take it for an expreſſion of his confidence in the continuance of Gods favour towards him: that God who had freed him out of the jaws of death, would now continue him in the land of the living, there to remaine, and abide before the Lord. Ancient Engliſh Tranſlators enclining to this ſenſe, thus interpret it, I ſhall walke, in relation to the divine providence, whereby he ſhould be preſerved yet longer to live on earth: ſo as, according to this acception, to walke before the Lord, is to live to advance the glory of God. A pious interpretation this is. But this phraſe of walking before the Lord, is in Scripture moſt frequently uſed to ſet out a duty on mans part, rather then a kindneſſe on Gods part: for God requireth it of Gen 17. 1.
                     Abraham as a duty: and commendeth 2 Chro. 6. 16
                     David for it, as for a duty performed by him. To this acception do the Kings Tranſlators incline, and tranſlate it as a promiſe made on the Prophets part to God, thus, I will walke. By this manner of expreſſing his purpoſe under a ſolemne promiſe, he bindeth himſelfe to performe the duty promiſed. This word, walke, importeth a motion, and a proceeding on in that motion ſtep by ſtep, from place to place. Metaphorically it is taken for a practice of good or evill. The words joyned with it will ſhew what kind of practice it importeth. 1 King. 15. 26To walk in the way of the wicked is to practice evill: Ier 7. 6.To walke after other Gods is to practice Idolatry. But Pſal. 119. 1.
                     to walk in the law of the Lord, is to practice what that law requireth: Iſa. 33. 15.
                     To walke in righteouſneſſe, is to

practiſe and deale righteouſly. The verb in the Hebrew is of the Hithpael.

Yea and the preſence of Gods Spirit in us, teſtified. Hereby inward aſſurance is gained, and outward evidence is given of our election before the world, and of our ſalvation after the world. Many judgements are by this walking or prevented, or removed, or mitigated, or ſanctified: and everlaſting perdition avoided. If motives may be of force to provoke us to performe a duty, motives are not wanting to provoke us to this duty of walking, as here it is profeſſed.

                      What may now be thought of ſuch, as having attained to a ſufficient meaſure of knowledge, and are with that which they know of God, and of his kind dealing with them inwardly affected, and are thereupon moved to profeſſe as much loue as the Prophet here doth, but yet faile in performance, in practice? They walke not. Their apprehenſion, affection, profeſſion are all in vaine; except to be as ſo many evidences againſt them, to make them the more inexcuſable, and to aggravate their judgement the more. I deny not, but that knowledge of God and of his favour towards us, a good liking thereof, and a cheerfull acknowledgement and profeſſion of what we know, are very needfull and uſefull. For walking without knowledge muſt needs be prepoſterous and erroneous: without a good affection, hypocriticall and vaine: and without a free profeſſion, too too timorous. So as theſe three are neceſſary, though not ſufficient. Queſtion may be made of the truth of them all, where they are not ſealed and ratified by an anſwerable walking and practice. And adverſaries of the truth will take the more occaſion to ſlander the truth. Our adverſaries doe much urge againſt us and our profeſſion that we walke not: that we practiſe not: and alleage this againſt our profeſſion, to impeach the integrity of our religion: which ſhould make us more conſcionable in ſhewing forth our good workes for

ſtopping of their mouthes. Our doctrine is even in this point, as in others, ſound and orthodoxe. In Schooles, in Churches, by preaching, by printing we teach a neceſſity of walking, of practiſing, of doing good works, according to this rule of the Apoſtle, (Tit. 3. 14.) Let ours learne to maintaine good works for neceſſary uſes, that they be not unfruitfull.

                  The ground of their cavilling againſt our doctrine about good works is, becauſe we do not ſet too high a prize upon them, and make them meritorious, which is to make them no good works, but proud, preſumptuous, damnable, diabolicall works. There be many forceable reaſons for the neceſſity of good works, though that vaine, frothie, windy, falſe, arrogant, impious, blaſphemous reaſon of merit be not preſſed. They are expreſly commanded of God: therefore neceſſary. Though they be not the cauſe of raigning, yet 
                        Via regni non cauſa regnandi Bern. de Grat. &amp; lib. arbitr.they are the way to the kingdome, out of which way we cannot attaine to the Kingdome: therefore neceſſary.

                      Though the doing of them do not merit eternall life, yet the not doing of them meriteth everlaſting death, (Mat. 25. 41, 42) therefore neceſſary. Though by the ſtrict ſtanderd of the Law being found unperfect, they are rejected, yet by the gracious mitigation of the Goſpell being found ſincere, they are accepted: therefore neceſſary. Though when we ſhall have done all thoſe things which are commanded us we are unprofitable ſervants, yet by doing according to our ability what we are commanded, we ſhew our ſelves gratefull children: therefore are good works neceſſary. This laſt motive is of more moment with an ingenuous child, then any merit can be. For when the beleever thorowly pondereth the free grace and rich mercy of God in giving him Chriſt, in accepting him in Chriſt, in pardoning all his ſinnes, in reſerving eternall life for him, his heart is ſo inflamed with a deſire of teſtifying all gratefulneſſe, as he is ready with his uttermoſt

power to do whatſoever he may know to be well-pleaſing unto God. Now Gods Word declaring that to do good is a ſacrifice well-pleaſing to God, the fore-named deſire doth Heb. 13. 16.more enforce him to do good, then the merit of many heavens could. Gratefulneſſe more worketh on an ingenuous ſpirit then reward can. And that which in way of gratefulneſſe is wrought, is much more kindly wrought, then that which is done for recompence. Anſwerably it is alſo more acceptable to God: for it manifeſteth a better reſpect towards him.
                  2 Ye that have taſted of the bounty of the Lord, and are well informed in his good-will towards you and thereupon have your hearts inflamed with the heavenly fire of love, and are ſtirred up to purpoſe and promiſe to approve your ſelves to him, have a care of your cariage, and ratifie the truth of all by an anſwerable walking. Sweet is that melodie, and happy is that harmony, where mind, heart, tongue, life and all conſent to make a concent. Say therefore (and do as ye ſay) I will walke: and that with ſuch a mind as is ſet out in the next doctrine.

This reſtrained righteous Ioſeph when by his miſtreſſe in a ſecret chamber, they two alone together, he was tempted to folly. This anſwer (How can I do this great wickedneſſe and ſinne againſt God?) ſheweth that he ſet God before him, and thereby was kept from yeelding to that temptation, Gen. 39. 9.

Hereby he implieth, that his ſetting of God before him made him more watchfull over his heart, to keepe it upright. No ſuch means as this to make a man upright. For he that walketh before God, knoweth that God is a ſearcher of the heart. As the preſence of men makes us carefull of our outward actions, ſo the preſence of God will make us Pro. 4. 23.

When Abrahams ſeruant made ſome queſtion of ſucceſſe in that buſineſſe whereabout his maſter ſent him, Abraham thus reſolveth the doubt, and ſetleth the mind of his ſeruant, Gen. 24. 40.
                     The Lord before whom I walke, will ſend his Angell with thee, and proſper thy way. Becauſe he walked before the Lord, he aſſured himſelfe of ſucceſſe.

                        zekiahs prayer and faith, as is evident by his putting God in mind thereof, where he ſaith, 2 King. 20. 3.

6 We ſhalbe encouraged againſt the ſlanders of malicious adverſaries. For, though ſuch as have approved themſelves to men, may notwithſtanding have cauſe to feare that God may have ſomething againſt them: yet they who have beene carefull to approve themſelves to God, need not care what man can ſay againſt them. When Davids enemies laid many matters unjuſtly to his charge, Pſal. 26. 1.he appeales to God: which he durſt not have done, if he had not walked before God.
                  7 We ſhalbe emboldened againſt all that man can doe againſt us. This is rendered as a reaſon why Moſes feared not the wrath of the King, Heb. 11. 27.
                     For he endured, as ſeeing him who is inviſible. This put life into Iehoſaphats fainting ſpirit. For, where he ſaith, 2 Chro. 20. 12
                     We know not what to do, he bewraieth a languiſhing ſpirit: but where he addeth, Our eyes are upon thee, he manifeſteth a revived ſpirit.
                  8 We ſhall perſevere, and hold out ſo long as we live. For God before whom we walke, ever liveth, ever remaineth the ſame: which men doe not. While good Iehojada lived, 2 Chro. 24. 17King Ioaſh maintained true religion: when Iehojada died, he revolted. Becauſe he walked before a mortall man, with the death of that man he fell away. But Hezekiah who walked before the immortall God, ever remained faithfull.

                  1 Naturall life, which is ſubject to mortality, corruption, and all manner of infirmities, is here onely in this world lived. After this life, corruptible muſt put on incorruption, and mortall muſt put on immortality, (1 Cor. 15. 53.) This life was meant, when Hezekiahs departure out of this world was thus threatned, thou ſhalt not live, Iſa. 38. 1.
                  2 Spirituall life, which is the life of grace, is alſo lived in this world. For, the Apoſtle ſpeaking of it thus ſaith, Gal. 2. 20.

There is juſt cauſe to feare that the ſtanche of the ſinnes of this City, and other places in this Land was ſo ranke in the noſtrels of the Almighty, as thereby he was provoked to ſweepe away ſo many as he did with the broome of the peſtilence. If it be ſaid, that many righteous ones were ſwept away, who have preſented even their bodies as well as their ſoules, a ſacrifice living, holy, acceptable, and of a ſweet ſmelling ſavour unto God: and many wicked ones left; I anſwer, that God may take away in a common judgement many righteous ones, the more to aggravate the judgement, and yet therein ſhew mercy to thoſe righteous ones, by tranſlating them to eternall bliſſe, and reſerve wicked ones, to bring them by that judgement executed on others, to repentance, or els to make them the more inexcuſable.

                     I will put my ſpirit within you, and cauſe you to walke in my ſtatutes, and ye ſhall keepe my judgements and doe them. Now Saints reſting in aſſurance of faith on God for accompliſhing of this, and Ier. 31. 33, 34.—3

                  3 All the promiſes of obedience which Saints make to God, they make with reference to the aſſiſtance of Gods Spirit, whereof they aſſure themſelves. As when they promiſe any temporall civill matter, they do it, either expreſly or implicitly, with relation to Gods will and leave (as they ought, Iam. 4. 15.) ſo in holy duties, to the worke of Gods Attende quod non dixerit, ſperavi▪ aut ſpero, ſed ſperabo.

                  Thus in the abſolute promiſes which Saints make, they arrogate nothing to themſelves above their ability, and yet manifeſt an unfained heart, and unalterable reſolution to God wards. So as where they ſay I will walke, I will hope, I will do this and that, it is as if they had ſaid, this is my deſire, this is my purpoſe, this is the intention of my heart.

                      Gratefulneſſe, and all equity requireth that they who taſte of the ſweetneſſe of Gods kindneſſe and goodneſſe, ſhould ſo walke before God, as to ſeeke in all things to pleaſe him. Kindneſſe requireth kindneſſe: goodneſſe, goodneſſe: eſpecially ſuch kindneſſe and goodneſſe as the Lord ſheweth and doth. But all the kindneſſe and goodneſſe that we poſſibly can ſhew, or doe to God, is to pleaſe him. Gods good pleaſure is the ground of all our hope: the ſpring from whence do ſlow all the good things which in any kind we have or can expect. Thereby God manifeſteth his mind and reſpect toward us. Our care to pleaſe him is the beſt evidence that we can give of our good mind and reſpect to God. We can really give nothing to him: wherefore the more and greater good things we receive from God, the more carefull we ought to be to pleaſe him.
                  That this generall duty may be the better performed, three or foure particulars are duly to be obſerved.

But when thou canſt in truth ſay of Gods goodneſſe, as he did who ſaid, That my ſoule knoweth right well, then will thy judgement Pſal. 139. 14.be convinced of the equity of the duty which thou oweſt to God: which is a forceable meanes to bring the will to yeeld thereunto.

It is God which worketh in us both to will and to doe of his good pleaſure: to thine owne endeavour adde faithfull prayer for Gods aſſiſtance. We have for this the patterne of an Apoſtle, who when he had declared a great evidence of Gods kindneſſe to the Hebrewes, namely their redemption by the bloud of Ieſus Chriſt, he prayeth that God would worke in them that which 
                     Heb. 13. 21.

                  §. 66. Of the meaning and doctrine of the 10 and 11 Verſes.
                  PSAL. CXVI. X, XI.
                  (I beleeved: therefore have I ſpoken. I was greatly afflicted.
                  I ſaid in my haſte, All men are lyars.)
                  THeſe two verſes are a digreſſion from his forementioned profeſſion, which is proſecuted in the verſes immediately after theſe: ſo as they may not unfitly be included in a parentheſis.
                  The Prophet in penning this Pſalme was even raviſhed with an holy admiration of the great deliverance which he had, and that beyond his expectation. Hereupon, as men in ſuch caſes uſe to doe, he falleth into digreſſions concerning the greatnes of his diſtreſſe, the weaknes of his fleſh, yea and of his recovery of himſelfe after that weakneſſe: which is here noted in the firſt place, thus, J beleeved, &amp;c.
                  
                     
                        Lyranus.

                        Rickelius.
                      Some take this of the Prophets too much credulity in the caſe betwixt 2 Sam. 16. 3, 4
                     Ziba and Mephiboſheth. Or of his too much credulity to Abſol

                        m, Achitophel, and other flattering courtiers which were the cauſe of his flying from Abſolom. But that ſenſe can be nothing to the Prophets purpoſe in this place. Beſides the word thus ſet alone, I beleeved, will not well beare that ſenſe. See § 5.As the firſt word of this Pſalme thus ſet, I love, ſo this, I beleeved, hath an eſpeciall emphaſis. It ſheweth that the greatneſſe of his affliction could not quell his faith. Saint Paul expreſly ſheweth 2 Cor. 4. 13.that the Prophet here meanes by this phraſe, I beleeved, a ſtedfaſt confidence in God: ſuch a confidence as by the ſpirit of God is wrought in Saints hearts. Therefore ſome for more perſpicuity inſert this word, God, thus, I beleeved God. This faith ſo quickned his ſpirit, and wrought ſuch an holy zeale in his ſoule, as he could not containe himſelfe,

nor conceale his mind, but was in a manner forced to expreſſe himſelfe, and to utter his thoughts: whereupon he maketh this inference, Therefore have I ſpoken.

                     Anſw. All that is mentioned in this Pſalme. His faith made him call upon God in the midſt of his deadly diſtreſſe. His faith made him acknowledge Gods grace and mercy. His faith made him promiſe and vow praiſe and obedience to God.
                  This clauſe I was greatly afflicted, may have a fit relation either to that which goeth before, or that which followeth.
                  In the former reſpect it is added as an amplification of the great meaſure of his faith, which, notwithſtanding the greatneſſe of his diſtreſſe, could not be extinguiſhed. If a diſcretive conjunction, although, be prefixed, the emphaſis of this clauſe will better appeare, thus, I ſpake although I was greatly afflicted.
                  
                  In the latter reſpect, it is premiſed as an extenuation of his weakneſſe, ſhewing that this was a cauſe thereof, namely,

                      both interpretations may well ſtand together, and be thus compoſed, in my ſudden feare: or in my fearefull haste; ſo as unadviſed, raſh, ſudden feare was the cauſe of this conceit and cenſure, All men are lyars.
                  
                  A difference alſo there is in the interpretation of this clauſe. For ſome expound it as a ſpeech of faith: oppoſing men to God, who onely is true: as if he had more largely thus expreſſed his mind, The Lord is without all queſtion moſt true, faithfull and conſtant in all his promiſes: and where men oft make queſtion thereof, it is by reaſon of that vanity and weakeneſſe which is in them: for all men are lyars. This difference betwixt God and man is moſt true: expreſly noted by the Apoſtle in theſe words, Rom. 3. 4.
                     Let God be true, and every man a lyar: but this interpretation in this place cannot well ſtand with this clauſe immediately going before, I ſaid in my haſte. For, to pronounce all men lyars in oppoſition to Gods truth, is no raſh, paſſionate ſpeech: but a true, adviſed, Apoſtolicall ſpeech.

                      Others therefore expound it as a ſpeech of incredulity, and referre this generall particle all, in ſpeciall to ſuch meſſengers of God as were ſent to him, to comfort him in his afflictions, and to promiſe him deliverance and advancement. Now though at firſt he might believe them, yet when he was in the extremity of his perplexity, ſo as he doubted of all recovery, then he made queſtion of the truth of their words, and in his ſudden feare ſaid to this purpoſe, Certenly as the common fort of men, ſo even theſe ſervants and Prophets of God are lyars: all men, not theſe excepted, all men are lyars. Now where he layeth the blame on men, therein, notwithſtanding this his great weakeneſſe,

he teſtifieth a reverend reſpect towards God, in that he doth not queſtion the truth of Gods Word, but rather imagineth that the Prophets did not well take their errand, but brought a wrong meſſage: and in that reſpect chargeth not God, but men with falſhood, and ſaith, All men are lyars.

                     Summe. 
                     In this digreſſion there is A mixture of faith and feare.
                  The parts are two.
                  1 The evidence of his faith, verſ. 10.
                  2 The inſtance of his feare, verſ. 11.
                  
                     
                        The former is Propounded.
                        The former is Amplified.
                     
                  
                  In the propoſition we have to note
                  1 The Expreſſion of his ſaith, I beleeved
                  
                  2 The Confirmation thereof, Therefore have I ſpoken.
                  
                  The Amplification is taken from the extremity of his diſtreſſe, I was greatly afflicted.
                  
                  The latter, namely his feare, is
                  1 Implied, by this phraſe, In my ſudden feare.
                  
                  
                     2 Exemplified, by this inſtance, I ſaid, all men are lyars.
                  The Expreſſion of his faith hath relation to the time of his triall: for he ſaith not of the time preſent wherein he was freed from his troubles, I beleeve: but of that time which before he deſcribed in the ſecond and third verſes, whereby he giveth demonſtration that
                  
                     I. Faith remaines firme in troubles.
                  The Confirmation of the truth of his faith by his acknowledging Gods mercy, calling upon God, promiſing to walke before God, which is the ſpeaking here meant, giveth evidence that,
                  
                     II. Faith makes men freely utter their mind.
                  The Amplification of the truth of his faith by the fore trouble wherein he was, thus ſet out, I was greatly afflicted, giveth proofe, that
                  
                     
III. No affliction can utterly ſuppreſſe faith. If not great affliction, what affliction?
                  The implication of his haſty, raſh paſſion under this phraſe, in my haſte, or in my ſudden feare, giveth inſtance that
                  
                     IIII. Saints are ſubject to ſudden paſſions.
                  The uttering of his mind in this his paſſion, for ſaith he, I ſaid in my haſte, further ſheweth that
                  
                     V. Diſtempered paſſion cauſeth unadviſed ſpeech.
                  The Matter of his ſpeech, which is to account ſuch as brought him promiſes of his deliverance, to be lyars, implieth, that
                  
                     VI. Extremity of diſtreſſe cauſeth Saints to account promiſes of releaſe to be vaine.
                  The object of his imputation, men, (not God, though thoſe men were ſent of God) men are lyars, importeth that
                  
                     VII. Saints in their most diſturbed paſſion beare a reverend respect to God.
                  Yet withall his unjuſt blaming of men (which he here acknowledgeth to be an effect of his weake fleſh, and diſtempered paſſion) declareth, that
                  
                     VIII. Man muſt not unjuſtly be blamed.
                  The extent of that object noted by this note of generality, all, intimateth, that

                     We have boldneſſe and acceſſe with confidence by faith.
                  
                  Faith is the firſt of the mighty works of Gods Spirit that are wrought in man. The mother of all ſanctifying graces: that which addeth power and efficacy to all the reſt: and therefore muſt needs in it ſelfe be powerfully operative. It is ſo ſpiritually hot as it cannot be ſmothered, much leſſe extinguiſhed; like an hot fiery vapour, the more it is ſuppreſſed, Per Antiperiſtaſin Vide Ariſtot. Meteor. lib. 2. cap. 8. &amp; 9.the more violent it waxeth. Philoſophy teacheth that hot vapours by a repulſion of contraries waxe violent, whence proceedeth the violence of thunder, of winds, of earth-quakes, and ſuch other meteors. And Theologie teacheth, that the fervent graces of Gods Spirit, among which faith is moſt principall, waxe the more ſpiritually violent by oppoſition.
                  
                     1 Demonſtration of the truth of ſaith. 1 Cor. 13. 7. 1 Triall is hereby made of the truth and meaſure of faith. If they that beleeve ſpeake, what may be thought of them that ſpeake not? Will charity (that beleeveth all things, that hopeth all things) ſuffer to believe and hope that

                     aith is in him, who hath no heart to pray, no boldneſſe to profeſſe the

name of God, no ſpirit to praiſe him? He that is altogether ſilent, hath aſſuredly no faith. He that ſpeaketh faintingly and coldly, hath but a fainting and cold faith. This is one of thoſe workes whereof we ought every one to ſay, as we are taught by an Apoſtle, I will ſhew thee my faith by my works.

                  The true faith of all Saints is rooted in Chriſt, (Col. 2. 7.) who is able to miniſter vertue &amp; vigor, and refreſhing unto it in the moſt bluſtering, blaſting and nipping times that can Ier. 17. 8.be. If a tree that is planted by the waters, and ſpreadeth out her roots by the river, ſhall not ſee when heat commeth, but her leafe ſhalbe greene, and ſhall not be carefull in the yeare of drought, neither ſhall ceaſe from yeelding fruit: how much more ſhall Pſal. 92. 13.they flouriſh who are planted in the houſe of the Lord, and

It is ſaid of hope the daughter of faith, that it entreth within the veile which is above As hope herin Heb 6. 19.is different from other anchors, which are caſt downward, ſo faith from other trees which grow downwards. Though they therefore that are planted in the moſt fertile ſoiles, and by the beſt rivers may wither, yet will not ſaith ſaile.

                  The fleſh remaineth in ſuch as have the ſpirit in them. By virtue of the Spirits abode in them they are Saints, true Saints: but by reaſon of the mixture of the fleſh, they are ſubject to ſymptomes, effects and infirmities of the fleſh, among which, ſudden paſſions may well be reckoned. For, paſſions are like to luſty pampered horſes, which if they be not held in with the bridle of reaſon, and curbe of diſcretion, will run with a careere to their owne and riders hazard.
                  May it not now be thought a moſt unjuſt conſure, to judge all thoſe to be carnall, and unregenerate who ſpeake in haſte, who bewray ſudden paſſions of anger, of griefe, of feare, of joy or of any the like? Saints having beene proved to be ſubject to ſudden paſſion, to cenſure them for men unregenerate, who on a ſudden are in paſſion, what is it but to Iſa. 5. 20.
                     call good evill, and to make light darkneſſe, and ſweet bitter? Surely theſe kinds of cenſures ariſe from ſudden paſſions. If theſe then be infallible ſignes of an unregenerate eſtate, ſuch cenſures are a demonſtration that the authors of them are not regenerate. Yea demonſtrations enough may be made againſt every one that beareth the name of a Saint, that he onely beareth the name of a Saint, but is no Saint. Thus ſhall all be brought into the labyrinth of deſpaire, out of which they cannot know how to winde themſelves. But learne to diſtinguiſh betwixt infirmity and obſtinacy, and notwithſtanding the infirmities that in this world thou art ſubject unto, thou maiſt cheerefully go on in that courſe which will Heb. 12. 23.bring thee to that condition wherein the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect, are.

They are like weeds, which grow apace, if they be ſuffered. They are like beaſts and birds, that being naturally wild, if they be not narrowly watched, kept in darke, kept awake, kept from light and ſleepe, and taught to obey, will ever be wild, never tame. Experience of all ages hath verified this adage (whereof §. 4.before) Paſſions are bad maſters but good ſervants. If they rule over reaſon, they wilbe as Lords of miſrule, outragious, diſturbers of all order. It wilbe in mans little polity, conſiſting of body and ſoule, as it was in Iſrael, when there was no King in Iſrael, Every man did

There is more need of meaues to weaken then to ſtrengthen paſſions, to famiſh then to cheriſh them, to curb them in, then to ſpurre them out, and to hold them backe, then to give them head. Though they be in ſuch as are juſtified and ſanctified, yet may they not by any meanes be juſtified, or countenanced as things lawfull.

Words that proceed out of paſſion are oft violent, and cauſe much miſchief. Many thinke they extenuate the matter when they ſay, Words are but wind. Let the violence of wind in a mans head, ſtomach, belly, veines, guts, or other parts of his body, yea and in the open aire, on ſea and land be conſidered, and it wilbe found, that enough is ſaid of words when they are ſaid to be wind. Iam.

                  Afflictions do oft ſo ſtirre the corrupt humour of the fleſh which is in every Saint, as it ſendeth up ſuch abundance of vapours of infidelity, as they cauſe a great miſt to ſpread it ſelfe before the eyes of mens underſtanding, ſo as they cannot clearely ſee the light of Gods promiſes, whereby they are brought to make queſtion of the truth thereof: even as children and fooles doe thinke there is no light in the Sun when a thicke cloud hath overſpread the face of the skie, and hindereth the beames of the Sun from ſhining on the earth. The beſt many times, thorow the violence of temptations,

in the things of God ſhew themſelves as children and fooles.
                  
                     Direction to ſuſpect our weakneſſe. Let us all learne, by ſuch patterns of the weakneſſe of the fleſh, even in the beſt, to ſuſpect our ſelves, and to Heb. 4. 1.
                     ſeare leſt a promiſe being left us of entring into his reſt, any of us ſeeme to come ſhort of it. Before the time of triall come, let us pray, Luk. 22. 32.as Chriſt did for Peter, that our ſaith faile not: and, according to the 2 Cor. 12. 9.promiſe made to Paul, that Gods grace may be ſufficient for us: and that 1 Cor. 10. 13.the Lord would not ſuffer us to be tempted above that we are able Above all take we heed of preſumptuous ſelfe-conceipt, that we be not like him, who in too much confidence of his owne ſtrength ſaid to Chriſt, 
                     Mat. 26. 33.

                     Though I ſhould die with thee, yet will I not denie thee. A worthy profeſſion and reſolution this was, if it had not beene uttered upon too great a confidence of his owne ability to ſtand, and withſtand all temptations. But it being uttered on preſumption of his owne ſtrength, the iſſue thereof was moſt wofull. Nothing more provokes God to leave men to themſelves, and to ſuffer Satan to prevaile againſt them, then an high conceipt of themſelves. It is moſt meet that ſuch ſhould know their owne weakeneſſe. But nothing can give to man a more evident demonſtration of his frailty and weakneſſe, then his ſlips and falls when he is brought to the triall. This will make him ſay, Iob 40. 4.

Among and above all other principles thoſe which concerne the infiniteneſſe and perfection of Gods eſſence, properties, word, and works are moſt infallible and undeniable. Saints therefore, who have a true and right underſtanding of God, dare not impeach Gods truth, juſtice, wiſdome, power, mercy, or any thing els in God, though the works of God, and Gods dealing with them do ſeeme very ſtrange unto them. Knowledge of Gods perfection works ſuch reverence in them towards God, as they had rather remaine as in a maze, not knowing what to ſay, then impute any blame to God. If they lay any blame, it ſhalbe rather on man then on God.
                  2 The ſpirit never wholly leaveth the Saints. Though the weakneſſe of the fleſh be very great, yet will the ſpirit keepe them from falling from their God. Mat 26. 41.

                        Dehortation from undue thoughts of God.

                     Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded. Let us teſtifie our high eſteeme of the Lord, our reverend reſpect towards him, by not daring to entertaine a thought, or to ſuffer a word to ſlip out of our mouth▪ which may any way be derogatory to any of his excellencies: or to think any thing of him otherwiſe then indeed he is. Wilt thou condemne him that is moſt juſt? Is it fit to ſay to a King, Thou art wicked? Or to Princes, ye are ungodly? How much leſſe to him that accepteth not the perſons of Princes, nor regardeth the rich more

                     Direction to eſteeme God aright. To have thine heart well ſeaſoned with a due reſpect of God, be well informed in his excellencies, and oft meditate thereon. Ignorance of God is it that cauſeth many baſe and unmeet thoughts of him to enter into our hearts. Want of meditation maketh what we know, not to be remembred, or not to be regarded. Adde therefore to the meanes of information which God affordeth, ſerious and ſetled meditation: Thus thy mind being filled with divine thoughts, will not ſuffer impious and blaſphemous thoughts to harbour there.

                     PAſſion makes men judge all alike. True it is that by reaſon of that naturall corruption which hath infected all mankind, all are alike. Rom 3. 22, 23
                     There is no difference. For all have ſinned, and come ſhort of the glory of God. Thus Pſal. 14. 3. Rom. 3. 10.a Prophet, and an Apoſtle alſo, not in paſſion, but by immediate inſtinct of the Spirit, ſaid, There is none righteous, no not one. Yea, in this ſenſe —4.the Apoſtle uſeth the very words, that are here uſed, Every man is a lyar, and yet no man unjuſtly blamed. But to judge ſuch as have the Spirit of

God in them, and are in what they ſpeake guided by the Spirit of God, yea and bring their meſſage from God, to judge them to be as naturall unregenerate men are, lyars, this is a moſt unjuſt imputation. Yet thus did paſſion make this Prophet judge the Prophets of the Lord that came to him in the name of the Lord, with the word of the Lord, to be. Both paſſion and hardneſſe of heart made Exo. 7. 11.
                     Pharaoh judge Moſes and Aaron to be like to the ſorcerers and magicians of Egypt. So did 2 King. 19. 11
                     Sennacherib judge Hezekiah and his people, and kingdome to be no better then the Kings, people and kingdomes of other nations. Ier. 5. 31. Lam. 2. 14. Zac. 13. 4. Mic. 3. 5.It is oft noted of the Iewes, that they gave no more heed to ſuch faithfull Prophets as the Lord ſent, then to ſuch falſe Prophets as ran of themſelves, and were not ſent: who ſpake a viſion of their owne heart, and not out of the mouth of the Lord. Yea many times 1 King. 22. 8. Ier. 18. 18.—37. 19▪ Paſſion like coloured glaſſe.more credit was given to ſuch falſe Prophets, then to true ones.

Now by experience we know, that what a man looketh upon thorow coloured glaſſe, appeares to him to be of the ſame colour that the glaſſe is of, though it be in truth of another colour. All objects are preſented thorow ſuch a glaſſe in one and the ſame colour. So to a man in paſſion all men ſeeme alike: all lyars, all deceitfull, all unjuſt, all unmercifull, all as one. Hence theſe or ſuch like ſpeeches oft come from them. I will believe no man. I will truſt no man. No man will deale faithfully with me. None can do me any good.
                  
                  It is on this ground very requiſite that men in paſſion, or overwhelmed with affliction learne to ſuſpect themſelves, and to ſuppoſe that they may be deceived. We uſe thus to perſwade men that by ſickneſſe are diſtempered in their taſte, and cannot diſcerne any difference betwixt meats, but loath all alike, to believe others that have both good underſtanding of what is wholſome and hurtfull, and alſo a taſte well tempered, and accordingly againſt their owne diſtempered humour to take and eate that which thoſe others doe offer unto them for their good. Many that in paſſion have

                      had a very ill opinion of their beſt friends, and beene moved to inveigh againſt them moſt bitterly, when the paſſion hath been over, have been very ſorie for that wrong they did, and much repented the ſame. If ſuch would have ſuſpected themſelves, they might have prevented that occaſion of after-repentance. It is a kind of madneſſe not to thinke and know that lies cannot long deceive: and that it is night while the day ſhineth out. Knowledge of truth doth as evidently diſcover a lie, as the Sun diſpells darkneſſe.
                  If ſuch generall cenſures proceeding from men in paſſion be blame-worthy (for here the Prophet acknowledgeth it ſo to be) what are they when they come from men in cold bloud (as we ſpeake) when there is no affliction to vexe and grievethem, no occaſion to anger them, no great cauſe to ſtir up any paſſion in them, except a malevolent humor in themſelves? Too too frequent are ſuch cenſures, and that moſt commonly when ſuch as by function, profeſſion, or any other like relation have dependance on God. Thus if ſome Miniſters be obſerved to be proud, covetous, licentious, or otherwiſe vicions, a generall imputation ſhalbe laid upon all, All Miniſters are thus and thus. So on like grounds, All profeſſors are hypocrites, All frequenters of ſermons are buſiebodies. All that make conſcience of ſwearing are lyars, &amp;c. Thus in other caſes, All Tradeſmen are couſoners. All citizens are uſurers. All Phyſitians are hard-hearted. All Lawyers are unconſcionable. All officers are bribers. All Patrons are ſimoniacall. All courtiers are proud. All Scholars are vaine glorious All husbands are ſlaves. All wives wilbe maſters. All ſervants are idle. Yea it is uſuall thus to impeach all of a nation: as, All Spaniards are proud. All Italians are Machevillians. All French-men are falſe-hearted. All Dutch-men are drunkards. All Scotch-men are treacherous▪ All Engliſh-men are fantaſticall. Such generall cenſures cannot be but unjuſt cenſures: and yet too too frequent they are.

                     Mat 8. 26.—14. 31. Luk 24. 37.
                     Oft doth Chriſt upbraid feare even to his beleeving Diſciples. Of Peter it is noted, after that he was endued with an extraordinary meaſure of faith and other gifts, that 
                     Gal. 2. 12.He feared them which were of the circumciſion.
                  
                     1 Cor. 13. 9. That which the Apoſtle ſaith of knowledge, is true of faith, and of all other graces for the time of this life, We believe in part. So much as wanteth in man of the perfection of faith, feare filleth up: as aire filleth up ſo much of a veſſell as wanteth water or other liquor. Exo. 17. 8, &amp;c.
                     Feare to the Soule of man is as Amalek to Iſrael: and Faith as Moſes. Feare is ready on all occaſions to invade the Soule. If Faith waxe faint, and let downe her hand, Feare prevailes. Yea 2 Sam. 3. 1.as the two houſes of David and Saul were together in Iſrael, and maintained warre one againſt the other, ſo doe Feare and Faith in the ſame ſoules. But as Faith waxeth ſtronger and ſtronger, Feare will waxe weaker and weaker.
                  This mixture putteth us in mind of ſundry duties, as,
                  1 To beare with the infirmities of Saints, Gal. 6. 1.

                     the Hebrew, importeth a kind of requitall. It is attributed to God and man: and that in relation to a good thing done, and ſignifieth to reward: or to an evill, and ſignifieth to revenge.
                  
                  Where David ſaith of God, Pſal 18. 20.

                  The word tranſlated 
                        
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        
                     
                     benefits, is derived of that verbe which in the 7th verſe is tranſlated, 
                        
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        
                     
                     dealt bountifully. Theſe in relation to God he ſtileth HIS, his benefits, to teſtifie his acknowledgement of the good things which he had received to come from God: and to be given by him.
                  He addeth that generall particle ALL, to ſhew that from that preſent benefit which God had conferred upon him, his heart was extended unto a conſideration of other favours which the Lord from time to time had done him.
                  
                     
                        
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        
                      The word tranſlated towards me, properly ſignifieth Over or above me. For it commeth from a verbe that ſignifieth to aſcend: and to expreſſe the emphaſis thereof, ſome thus 
                        
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

                     tranſlate it, All thy benefits go over me. But the prepoſition doth oft ſignifie (as our Engliſh tranſlateth it) towards me: and it may very fitly be ſo taken in this place.
                  The former part of the verſe ſet out interrogatively by way of queſtion (what ſhall I render to the Lord?) manifeſteth both an earneſt deſire to be truly and thorowly enformed of whatſoever may be acceptable and pleaſing to the Lord: and alſo a ſetled reſolution indeed to performe whatſoever

he ſhalbe informed of concerning that point.
                  The latter part (all his benefits are towards me) are added as a reaſon of his reſolution. The firſt particle (for) is not in the Originall. It maketh the ſenſe ſomewhat doubtfull. Some ſet it downe as a prepoſition, without any ſtop betwixt the former and this part, making but one entire clauſe of all, and ſetting the interrogative point in the end of all, thus, Genev. interpr.
                     What ſhall I render unto the Lord for all his benefits towards me? Others make two diſtinct ſentences, and place the interrogative in the end of the firſt clauſe, thus, Trem. &amp; Iun.
                     What ſhall I render to the Lord? all his benefits are towards me. The Kings Tranſlators ſet a colon betwixt the two parts: which doth ſo diſtinguiſh them as two ſentences. This difference is not great: howſoever the ſentences be pointed, it is evident that the latter is added as a reaſon of the former. He was inquiſitive what to render to God, becauſe God had beene beneficiall to him.

                  §. 77. Of the propertie of gratefulneſſe to make men inquiſitive.
                  I. §. 76.
                     GRatefulneſſe makes men inquiſitive. All manner of gratefulneſſe whether to God or man hath this property. When David thought on Ionathans kindneſſe to him, though Ionathan were dead, yet 2 Sam 9. 1.he enquireth whether any were left of the houſe of Saul, that he might ſhew him kindneſſe for Ionathans ſake. And when he conſidered how God had eſtabliſhed peace to his people, firſt 1 Chro. 13. 2.he enquireth and conſulteth about bringing the Arke to the Tabernacle: and then —17. 1.adviſeth about building a temple for the Lord. Hypocrites had learned this of the upright: and therefore they from teeth outward are inquiſitive, and ſay, Mic. 6. 6, &amp;c.
                     Wherewith ſhall I come before the Lord? &amp;c.
                  In gratefull perſons there is a good and high eſteeme of the kindneſſe that is ſhewed to them. With this eſteeme the heart is affected. True affection of the heart is of an hot

temper: it can no more be ſuppreſſed, and kept within the heart, then an hot vapour, which the more it is ſuppreſſed, the more violent it waxeth, till it have got vent. Such an affection therefore will ſhew it ſelfe. And that it may manifeſt it ſelfe in the beſt manner to the beſt content of him to whom they intend their thankfulneſſe, they content not Dabo quidem quicquid in me primum eſt: ſed nihil dignum dare potero. Hier. Comment. in Mic. 6. Demonſtration of a gratefull heart.
                     themſelves with that which may firſt riſe in their minde, or offer it ſelfe to their thought, but diligently enquire what may give beſt content, and what may be moſt acceptable. Which they are the rather moved to do, becauſe they can do or give nothing worthy of God, and his kindneſſe to them.
                  By this outward evidence may men give evidence of their inward diſpoſition; and make others ſee how they are affected with the kindneſſes that are done to them. They who care not to know what may be acceptable to ſuch as do good to them, have aſſuredly an ungratefull heart. How can it be thought that they would do the things that pleaſe, when they care not to know what may pleaſe? By this may gratefull ſubjects, people, children, ſervants, friends, and neighbours be knowne. Yea by this may gratefull ſubjects, people, children and ſervants of the great Lord of heaven and earth be knowne: if, at leaſt, their enquiring after that which may be acceptable to God, come from an upright and honeſt heart: and from a full and faithfull purpoſe to performe what they ſhalbe rightly informed in, and indeed to render what they ſhall learne to be acceptable to the Lord.
                  
                     Direction for ſuch as are inquiſitive. They who are ſo minded, have an excellent help to be well informed. That help is Gods word, which diſtinctly and ſufficiently revealeth what is the good, acceptable, &amp; perfect will of God. Let all ſuch therefore as are intirely provoked to enquire after that which may be pleaſing to God, by the holy Scriptures Rom. 12. 2.

                  §. 78. Of a ſecond propertie of gratefulneſſe to doe any thing.
                  II. § 76.A Gratefull mind is ready to do any thing. The Prophet doth not here determine any ſet and particular things which he would be willing to render, but without limitation or exception of any thing, ſaith indefinitely, What? What ſhall I render? When Ahaſhucroſh had heard out of the Chronicles what a great good-turne Mordecai had done him, in revealing a dangerous treaſon plotted againſt his life, in true deſire of thankfull requitall he ſaith, Eſt. 6. 6.
                     What ſhalbe done to the man whom the King delighteth to honour? He preſcribeth not any particular thing, but enquiteth wherein he may make the beſt requitall: and it appeareth that he did make that enquirie with a true intent to do any thing: for though Haman thorow his ambition (ſuppoſing that the honour ſhould have beene done to himſelfe) adviſed the King to do more then was meet to be done to a ſubject, yet the King commanded all to be done to Mordecai. Though David was not permitted to build a temple for the Lord, yet ſuch was his deſire to teſtifie his gratefull mind to God, as 1 Chro. 29. 2.he prepared what he could, even with all his might, for the building thereof. Zacchous was ſo raviſhed with that favour and honour that Chriſt did him in comming to his houſe, as in way of gratefulneſſe Luk. 19. 8.
                     He giveth halfe of his goods to the poore, and promiſeth to reſtore fourefold to all whom he had wronged.
                  Gratefulneſſe ſo enamoureth the ſoule of a man, as it makes him thinke that he can never doe enough, and therefore he is ready to do any thing that he may and can do. It will not ſuffer a man to hold any thing too deare for him, on whō his thankfull mind is ſet: eſpecially when ſuch a mind is ſet on God, who every way infinitely ſurpaſſeth us, who is ſo abſolutely perfect in himſelfe, as he needeth nothing that we

Who then would not willingly and gladly have what he might render to the Lord his God?
                  Behold here the moſt ready way that poſſibly can be preſcribed to bring men to endeavour with the uttermoſt of their power in all things to pleaſe the Lord. Worke in them ſuch an apprehenſion, a ſenſe of Gods kindneſſe to them, as their hearts may be ſtirred up to thankfulneſſe: Then nor hope of reward, nor fear of revenge can ſo incite, or quicken them up to any duty, as their owne gratefull diſpoſition. An ingenuous and generous mind (as every gratefull mind is) will do much more in thankfulnes for a kindneſſe done, then in expectation of a kindneſſe to come. Perſwade men therefore of the goodneſſe and kindneſſe that God hath done for them, as you deſire that they ſhould be willing, ready and forward to do any duty to God.

                     TRue gratefulneſſe hath eſpeciall relation to the Lord. A man that is well inſtructed in the right forme and due manner of thankſgiving will eſpecially returne all thanks to God, whether it be for ſuch benefits as come immediately from himſelfe, as all thoſe extraordinary benefits, whereof any that tooke due notice, might ſay, This is the finger of God, or, This is the Lords doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes. (For ſuch as theſe, Exod 15. 1.

                     Miriam and the women of Iſrael gave ſolemne thanks to God) or thoſe ordinary benefits to the conferring whereof man addeth no helpe (as the ſhining of the Sun, the courſes of the moone, the former and latter raine, the bounds ſet to the ſea, the ſweet ſprings and rivers of water paſſing thorow the earth, and many other ſuch as are reckoned up in the 104 Pſalme, for which praiſe is there

given to God) or for ſuch benefits as are conferred upon vs by the miniſtry of man. Thus Melchiſedech bleſſed God for Gen 14. 20.that victory which Abraham had gotten over his enemies: David bleſſed God for that counſell which wiſe Abigail

So cleare is the point of returning thanks to God for all manner of benefits, as beſides the many ſimple formes of giving thankes to God ſet downe thorowout the whole Scripture, but eſpecially in the booke of Pſalmes, when man commeth in any competition with God about this matter, he is utterly excluded: as where the Pſalmiſt negatively Pſal 115

If we receive any mediately by the miniſtry of man, or of any other creature, they are therein the inſtruments and hands of God whereby he reacheth out unto vs, &amp; conferreth upon vs, his benefits. The benefits which we receive frō a wiſe King, iuſt magiſtrates, faithfull miniſters, conſcionable lawyers, skilfull phyſitians, honeſt tradeſmen, induſtrious husbandmen, or which any receive from good husbands or wives, provident parents, mercifull maſters, diligent and truſtie ſervants, or any other perſons, are Gods benefits.

not to lift up an eye to the tree whence it falleth. It is not enough to render any thing to man, or to any other creature for the benefits we haue. The Prophets quaere is, What ſhall I render to the Lord? To render any thing to the creature and nothing to the Creator, is to neglect the principall doner; yea to thinke more highly of the ſervant then of the maſter, of man then of God, which is no better then idolatry.

                  Hereby is man convinced of the equity of the duty; which is an eſpeciall meanes to work upon the conſcience, and provoke him to performe that which in his iudgement he ſeeth to be moſt iuſt and meet that it ſhould be performed.

The benefits of the Lord which occaſion matter of thankſgiuing are either not at all obſerued, but paſſed ouer without regard; or elſe ſoone forgotten. When the Lord by his Prophet upbraideth to the Iſraelites their great ingratitude he rendreth this reaſon thereof, Iſa. 1. 3.
                     Iſrael doth not know, my people doth not conſider. And when the Pſalmiſt ſpeaketh of their like ingratitude, he rendreth this reaſon, Pſal. 106. 21.
                     They ſorgat God their Sauiour, which had done great things in Aegypt. Where there is no knowledge of a benefit there can be no

good eſteeme thereof. What is not eſteemed can not be affected. No man will enquire what hee may render for that which he affects not. Againe that which is forgotten is as not knowne, as not eſteemed, as not affected. They therefore

But without all doubt, remembrance of kindneſſe incites gratefulneſſe.

                  This is the way to make thee ſee and ſay, Gods benefits are towards mee, and thereupon in teſtimonie of gratefulneſſe heartily to enquire, what ſhall I render to the Lord?

The rule is this, to be ſo acquainted with the ſeverall kinds of Gods benefits, as on all occaſions they may be preſented to our minds. Without all queſtion the Prophets mind was upon many and ſundry ſorts of benefits, when he ſaid, all his benefits are towards me. He did not confuſedly uſe this generall particle all, as many doe when they profeſſe to thanke God for all his benefits, and yet have none at all in their minds. His ſpirit was otherwiſe diſpoſed, then to content it ſelfe with ſuch a generall, indefinite, cold, looſe, formall forme of acknowledging Gods benefits.

                  Men are moſt ſenſible of kindneſſes done to themſelves, the ſweetneſſe whereof their owne ſoules doe taſte. Now according to the taſte and ſence of a kindneſſe, is the heart quickned and ſtirred up to thankfulneſſe. Though it be an effect of naturall ſelfe▪loue, to affect the heart with ſuch good things as a man himſelfe is made partaker of, yet is it not againſt ſpirituall love to make an advantage thereof, and to uſe that affection of the heart to kindle and inflame our zeale unto a more feruent manner of praiſing God.

Among other mercies take eſpeciall notice of ſuch as in particular concerne thy ſelfe: as he that ſaid, I will declare what God hath done for my ſoule. In this conſideration firſt marke ſuch as are moſt proper and peculiar to thy ſelf, wherof thou maiſt ſay, He hath not dealt ſo with others. So did he who ſaid, He choſe Dauid his ſervant, &amp;c. Then obſerve what part thou haſt in ſuch as are common with others. And here conſider what relation there is betwixt thee and thoſe others: whether they bee ſuch as are committed to thy

charge, neerely united to thee, of the ſame family, or alliance, or pariſh, or incorporation, or nation, or profeſſion. Neere relations will affect our hearts for benefits beſtowed on them to whom we are united, as if they were beſtowed on our ſelves. Inſtance that affection which was wrought Gen. 24. 27.in the heart of Abrahams ſervant for the good ſucceſſe of his maſters buſineſſe: and the praiſe which he gaue to God for the ſame. If in common bleſſings we finde our ſelves to have a ſhare, we ſhall be the more quickned to give thanks 1. Kin 1 40.for the ſame: as the people that rejoyced at the coronation of Salomon.
                  
                  Who are they that are now beſt ſettled to giue prayſe to God for this admirable decreaſe of the ſickneſſe?

                     parts: nor they who thought themſelves ſafe enough in the country. But they who conceiving themſelves to be in as great danger as others, perceiued a ſpeciall care of God over them in preſeruing them. That benefit which a man knowes himſelfe to receive from the light of the ſunne, influence of the heavens, ſweetneſſe of the aire, and other like common bleſſings, will make him heartily to bleſſe God for them. Search therefore narrowly wherein Gods benefits have beene towards thee in ſpeciall. Do this daily and hourely, not onely about common benefits which the maker of all conferreth on all, but about private and daily bleſſings, and thou wilt diligently enquire what thou maiſt render to him.

                            in Gen. 8. Diſcovery of ingratitude by concealing kindneſſe.
                      can to the author of the kindneſſe, wherewith he is affected. We heard before (§. 77.) how he requireth what hee may render. Will not then that mind which maketh him ſo inquiſitiue to be further inſtructed in what he may doe more, provoke him to doe that which he can not be ignorant to be acceptable? As for the Lord, he requireth thankſgiuing in our words, not that he hath any need thereof, but that he may teach us to be thankfull, and to acknowledge the doner of ſo great good things as he beſtowes,
                  Can we now imagine that they who conceale all kindneſſes done to them, are gratefull perſons? were the nine lepers that being cured of their leproſie, made no profeſſion thereof, thankefull? If they were, wherein conſiſted the difference betwixt them, and that one, of whom Chriſt thus ſaith, were there not tenne cleanſed, but where are the nine? There are not found that returned to give glory to God, ſave this ſtranger. (Luk 17. 17, 18.) As great an evidence of ingratitude it is, to keepe cloſe, not to make knowne, not to acknowledge benefits, as can be given.
                  
                     Exhortation to acknowledge benefits. Shew me then thy gratitude by the effect thereof. Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth ſpeaketh. Even to men are theſe benefits to be acknowledged. Thus Iudg. 5. 24.
                     Deborah acknowledged Iaells kindneſſe: 1 Sam. 25. 33
                     David, Abigails:

                     Saul, Davids, and many other, other mens. Much more to God muſt his benefits be acknowledged, in regard of the multitude, greatneſſe, freeneſſe, needfulneſſe, profitableneſſe, and continuance of them, together with many other circumſtances whereby they are much amplified. And ſo much the rather, becauſe acknowledgement is all that we can render to God: and it is all that God doth expect, which yet he doth moſt graciouſly accept. Make this holy profeſſion therfore of the Lords benefits to God himſelfe and to men: make it

to God in ſecret and in publike: make it at all times, in all places: make it while the benefits are freſh before thee: lay up his benefits in thy memory, that thou maiſt in future times againe, and againe make it. Acknowledge the benefits which thou haſt received, and thou ſhalt be ſure to receive more. The tenth leper which returned to give glory to God, received thereby another, and a greater benefit, which was the cleanſing of his ſoule from the leproſie of ſinne; as this Luk. 17. 19.phraſe importeth, Thy faith hath ſaved thee. He was cleanſed of his bodily leproſie before he returned. There was then ſomewhat more intended, by the pronouncing of this after his returning to glorifie God. The other nine that returned were cleanſed in their bodies. This was ſaid to him as an evidence of a greater benefit, then that which they receiued. For Gods ſake therefore who is thereby honoured, and for thine owne ſake who gaineſt thereby more benefits, acknowledge Gods benefits, and ſay, His benefits are towards me.

                  PSAL. CXVI. XIII.
                  I will take the cup of ſalvation, and call upon the name of the LORD.
                  
                     §. 76. THe ſecond part of the Prophets Rhetoricall addubitation is here expreſſed, which is an anſwer to his former queſtion: whereby hee ſheweth that he made not the queſtion ſimply on ignorance, as if he knew not what to render, but purpoſely to ſet out the great deſire he had, and the forwardneſſe that was in him to doe, what he ſaw moſt meet to be done.
                  
                     
                     This was one Iohn Lodwicke, a Spaniard by nation, a Monke by profeſsion, who lived ten yeares together in England, lodging in an houſe by Biſhops gate, London, who day after day went forth in a beggars attire, and as occaſion was offered, belched forth moſt impious blaſphemies againſt the bleſſed Trinity, eſpecially againſt the ſacred perſon of our bleſſed Saviour Ieſus Chriſt (whom he ordinarily called Deuill) and againſt the holy Scripture, for which he was convented before authority, and being convicted by witneſſes and by his own confeſsion was ſent over to Spaine▪ there to be proceeded againſt, in the yeare of our Lord 1618. This blaſphemous Heretique accounting the things that were written by the Prophets and Apoſtles to be meere dotages, ſaid that David was one of the worſt, and that in penning this Pſalme he ſhewed himſelfe to be a drunkard and a lyar, by reaſon of this, and the tenth verſe. As if by taking the cup of ſalvation, he had intended the drinking of an health, as drunkards uſe to do. Wherby we ſee how dangerous it may be to take that literally, which is meant metaphorically. This phraſe, cup of ſalvatition, is the moſt difficult and doubtfull phraſe of all the Pſalme. Its here figuratively uſed, and in that reſpect more ſubject to various interpretations. According to the divers ſignifications of this word * cup, ſome take it one way;

                     For of old they were wont to put poiſon into cups, and make ſuch as were adjudged to death, to drinke thereof. After this manner were Socrates,

                     Origin. Hieron. Auguſtin. Plac. Parm.Some therefore according to that ſignification thus expound this Text, I will willingly drinke the cup of affliction
                     
                     which the Lord ſhalbe pleaſed to give me, yea though it be death, which will aſſuredly turne to my ſalvation.
                  
                  3. Mat. 26. 39.The paſſion of Chriſt is ſtiled a cup: whereupon Lorinus aliique Papiſt.many imagine that the Prophet hath here relation thereunto. 
                        Hier. comment in hunc. loc. In Hebraeo ita habet, calicem Ieſu accipiam, &amp;cAn ancient Father ſaith that the Hebrew thus hath it, I will take the cup of Ieſus: which an Angel thus interprets, thou ſhalt call his name Ieſus: for he ſhall ſave his people. Indeed 
                        
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        
                     the Hebrew name tranſlated Ieſus, is derived from a root that ſignifieth to 
                        
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        
                     
                     ſave: But 
                        
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        
                     the word here uſed is of the feminine gender and plurall number. Yet by that which follows it may be gathered that by this very Hebrew word, the ſame thing is meant as by the name Ieſus, namely ſalvation. They who apply the cup of ſalvation to Chriſts paſſion, take it paſſively for martyrdome, or ſuffering for Chriſt, and ſo it little differs from the former interpretation. They who in theſe ſences expound this text, ſay, that thereby is rendred the greateſt thing that can be rendred by man, even his life.
                  4. In holy Scripture there is mention made of Gen. 35. 14. Lev. 23. 13. Num. 15. 5.
                     drink-offerings, which were a certaine quantity of wine that uſed to be powred out before the Lord: as the very notation of the word importeth, comming from 
                        
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                         effudit.a root that ſignifieth to powre out. As the meat-offerings, ſo the drinke-offerings were brought to the Lord in way of gratulation and thankſgiving. Cajetan. Genebr.Some therefore in alluſion hereunto ſo expound this text, as a promiſe and vow of the Pſalmiſt, to teſtifie his publike gratitude by ſuch an externall and ſolemne rite as in the law was preſcribed. This he tearmeth a cup, becauſe that drinke-offering was contained in a cup, and powred out thereof: and he addes this epithete Salvation, becauſe that rite was an acknowledgement of ſalvation, preſervation and deliverance from the Lord.
                  5. After their ſolemne gratulatory ſacrifices they were wont to have a feaſt. When David had brought the Arke of God into the Tabernacle, they offered burnt-offerings and 1 Chro 16. 3.peace-offerings, which being finiſhed, He dealt to every one of Iſrael both man and woman, to every one a loafe of bread, and a good piece of fleſh, and a flaggon of wine. Hereby is implyed

that he made ſo bountifull a feaſt, as he had to give thereof to all the people there aſſembled. 
                        In menſa laticum libavit honorem, &amp;c. Virg Aen. 1. Turneb. l. 12. c. 13. Athe l. 11. c 11.In this feaſt the maſter thereof was wont to take a great cup, and in lifting it up to declare the occaſion of that feaſt, and then in teſtimony of thankfulneſſe to drinke thereof to the gueſts, that they in order might pledge him. This was called a cup of ſalvation, or deliverance, becauſe they acknowledged by that uſe therof that God had ſaved and delivered them. Almoſt in a like ſence the Apoſtle ſtileth the Sacramentall cup,

                     the cup of bleſſing.
                  Here the Prophet uſeth the plurall number thus, 
                        
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        
                     
                     cup of ſalvations, whereby after the Hebrew elegancy, he meaneth Calicem ſalutum Vatab. Omnis ſalutis. Tremel.many deliverances one after another: or ſome great and extraordinary deliverance which was in ſtead of many, or which compriſed many under it. 
                        
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        
                     The word tranſlated take properly ſignifieth to lift up, and in that reſpect may the more fitly be applyed to the forementioned taking of the feſtivall cup, and lifting it up before the gueſts. Calvin. Vatab. Muſcul. Moller. Montan. Aliique.Moſt of our later Expoſitors of this Pſalme apply this phraſe, I will take the cup of ſalvation, to the forenamed gratulatory drinke-offering, or to the taking and lifting up of the cup of bleſſing in the feaſt, after the ſolemne ſacrifice. Both of theſe import one and the ſame thing, which is, that Saints of old were wont to teſtifie their gratefulnes for great deliverances with ſome outward ſolemne rite.
                  The former interpretations of this phraſe, cup of ſalvation, applyed to a portion, or affliction, or martyrdome, or the paſſion of Chriſt, though ſimply conſidered in thēſelves, they be truths, yet they are not ſo pertinent to this Text, as the two later of a gratulatory drinke-offering, or a feſtivall cup. For without queſtion a ſolemne thankſgiving is here intended, as is afterward in the 17. verſe plainely expreſſed.
                  The other clauſe that is added, and call upon the name of the Lord, is the ſame that was verſe 4.before uſed, and expounded. Here againe it is repeated, partly to ſhew that in the forementioned gratulatory rite he would Nomen Dei colam. Vatabl.worſhip God. (He would doe it piouſly and religiouſly. For prayer is an eſpeciall

part of Gods worſhip) partly to ſhew that though by Gods delivering him he were now ſafe, and ſo had juſt occaſion to praiſe God: yet would he not ceaſe to pray unto God for continuance of his favour and bleſſing. He would both praiſe God, and alſo pray unto him. Thus is the phraſe of calling upon the name of the Lord moſt properly taken.
                  This very duty of calling upon the name of the Lord, is againe promiſed, and that as an appurtenance to thankſgiving being added thereto in the 17. verſe, See §. 112.where I purpoſe to handle it in the generall acception, as it ſignifieth worſhip done to God. Here I conſider it in the particular and moſt proper ſignification, which is Petition.
                  This verſe being added as an anſwer to this clauſe, What 
                     Summe.
                     ſhall I render to the Lord? ſetteth out, Mans recompence to God.
                  
                  It conſiſteth of two parts.
                  1. Gratulation.
                  2. Invocation.
                  The former is ſet out by a moſt ſolemne rite of rejoycing.
                  The latter is expreſſed by the Action, (I will call) and by the Object (upon the name of the Lord)
                  
                  The two maine parts are joyned together by a copulative particle AND.
                  Of the ſubſtance of ſolemne Gratulation, or thankſgiving, ſufficient hath beene See ſect; 76, &amp;c. to this §.before delivered.
                  The inference of this profeſſion upon the former inquiſition, this being an anſwer thereto ſheweth that,
                  
                     I. Gratitude is the beſt recompence that man can render to God.
                  The manner of expreſſing it by a publicke rite of rejoycing teaches that
                  
                     II. Our inward motion of prayſing God muſt be manifeſted by ſome outward action of rejoycing
                  Of the ſubſtance of Invocation, even as it is here expreſſed, ſufficient hath beene delivered on the 4. verſe.
                  The connexion of theſe two points, Gratulation AND Invocation,

importeth that
                  
                     III. With gratulation invocation muſt be joyned.
                  The different manner of expreſſing invocation from that which was in the fourth verſe, (For there it was ſet downe as a thing performed in his trouble, then called I, &amp;c. Here it is noted as a duty to come, which he promiſeth to performe, I will call, &amp;c, and that after his deliverance) implyeth that
                  
                     IIII. Prayer to God is to be continued after the thing prayed for is granted.
               
               
                  §. 85. Of praiſe the beſt that man can render unto God.

                     GRatitude is the beſt recompence that man can render unto God. Surely this Prophet that made ſuch enquiry of what he might render unto God, if he had knowne a better, would have here mentioned it. Where bulls, goats, and ſuch like ſacrifices are refuſed, it is ſaid, Offer unto God thanksgiving. (Pſal. 50. 13, 14.) Praiſe is one of the ſacrifices with which God is well pleaſed, (Hebr. 13. 15. 16.) Expreſly it is ſaid of praiſing God, that it pleaſeth the Lord better then an oxe or bullocke, (Pſal. 69▪ 30, 31.) yet were thoſe ordained for ſolemne ſacrifices under the Law. Praiſe therfore is it which the Pſalmiſt doth eſpeciall vow to God, (verſ. 17.)

                      God ſtandeth in need of nothing that we can doe, or beſtow. But we ſtand in need of all that is his. Our thankes which we give him addes nothing to him, but makes him the more to reſpect us. By it (if it be rightly performed) God is acknowledged to be what he is, to give what he gives, and to doe what he doth. More then this the creature cannot doe: more then this the Creator nor exacteth nor expecteth, provided that it be not a meere lippe-labour, but come from an heart thorowly affected with his excellencies and kindneſſes, and be ratified by an anſwerable carriage towards him.

                     ſpirit and truth. Yet this hindreth not but that he may and muſt be alſo worſhipped in body, and in outward actions. He muſt euer be worſhipped in ſpirit, whether with the body, or without the body. Spirituall worſhip may be without bodily worſhip, and alſo ſtand with bodily worſhip: but bodily worſhip cannot ſtand without ſpirituall worſhip.
                  2 The Spirits of others are ſtirred up to joyne with us in congratulation, and mutuall thankſgiving. Neh. 8. 6.When the people ſaw and heard Ezra bleſſe the Lord, they anſwered, Amen, Amen, with lifting up their hands. When 2 Chro. 30. 5. &amp;c.
                     Hezekiah made it knowne that he meant to celebrate a ſolemne paſſeover, many of Ephraim, Manaſſeh, Iſhaker and Zebulon came thereto. This is one principall end of externall rites of gratulation, mutually to ſtirre up one anothers ſpirit.
                  3 Our owne ſpirits are much rouſed and quickened hereby. Outward gratulatory actions, as they manifeſt an inward gratefull affection, ſo they are meanes, as it were by a reflection, to increaſe the heate of gratitude, and enflame our zealous affection the more. Now our dulneſſe and coldneſſe in all pious duties giveth evidence that all meanes that can bee uſed for quickening our ſpirits, are little enough.
                  
                     Reprehenſion of indiſcreet reprehenders. Too auſtere and ſevere are they, who cenſure as unlawfull, and condemne all chearefull rites, and actions of gratulation. Their maine ground is the evill conſequence which followeth from thence. But that followeth not from a lawfull uſe of warrantable rites, but from an abuſe of them, which is indeed unlawfull. If abuſe of a thing were ſufficient to prohibit the uſe of it, the uſe of the moſt neceſſary and bounden duties which the word commandeth, ſhould be prohibited. It is an eſpeciall point of wiſdome to diſcerne whence every evill ariſeth, and accordingly to be ſo circumſpect in avoiding the evill, as a warrantable, commendable, needfull, uſefull duty be not forborne thereby. The wiſe farmer neglecteth not to ſow his ground becauſe weeds uſe to grow among the corne. No wiſe man will forbid the drinking of wine becauſe ſome by intemperancy

are made drunke. Evill conſequences ariſing from good things, give juſt occaſion to be watchfull over our ſelves in the doing of thoſe good things, that by our careleſneſſe they prove not pernicious. So as, it is not a ſufficient plea for intemperancy, to ſay, the thing that we doe is lawfull. He that hath warranted a thing to be done, hath preſcribed rules for the manner of doing it, by a due obſervation whereof good things wilbe well done.
                  In generall, outward gratulatory actions muſt be
                  1 Such as are approved by God himſelfe, as thoſe were which we noted in the proofe of the point. For, how can we thinke that thoſe things which he approveth not, will pleaſe him?
                  2 Such as may beſeeme the occaſion: even ſuch chearefull actions as may revive mens ſpirits: ſuch alſo were thoſe that are before mentioned. As outward rites of humiliation muſt be ſuch as may humble the ſoule: ſo of gratulation, ſuch as may quicken it, Pſal. 81. 1, &amp;c.
                  3 Such as are not offenſive: nor occaſions to any corruption: As are drinking healths, eſpecially on bare knees, and in meaſure above that which ſober men are able to beare: laſcivious dauncing: revelling on the Lords Daies, and other the like.
                  Among other externall rites of gratulation, that which is here intended (feaſting) is a principall one. Thereof See The Whole Armour of God, Treat. 3. Part. 2. §. 73.

                     VVIth gratulation, invocation muſt be joyned. As with our petitions we muſt ioyne praiſes: ſo, with theſe, thoſe. Prayer and praiſe are like two twinnes, which though they have each of them their ſeverall and diſtinct members, yet by the navell are from their birth knit together, and ſo grow together, as if you force them aſunder, you kill them both: one without the other cannot live. They are therefore in ſacred Scripture

oft joyned together: ſometimes one, ſometimes another ſet in the former place, thus, Phil 4. 6.
                     In every thing by prayer and ſupplication with thankeſgiving let your requeſt be made knowne to God. 
                     1 Theſ 5. 17, 18.
                     Pray without ceaſing: in every thing give thanks.

                     Iſa. 12. 4.
                     Praiſe the Lord: call upon his name. Obſerve the formes of praiſes, and of prayers noted in Scripture, and you ſhall finde, where the principall occaſion hath beene gratulation, ſupplication to be added: and alſo where the principall occaſion hath beene ſupplication, gratulation to be added.
                  Such is our eſtate here in this world, and ſuch is Gods dealing with us, as there never wanteth occaſion of both. Never was any Saint brought into ſo deſperate a diſtreſſe▪ but that thorow the miſt of his miſery ſweet beames of Gods mercy have ſhined upon him. Nor ever was there any ſet in ſo bright and cleare a ſun-ſhine of Gods favour, but that ſome clouds have let fall ſhowers of ſorrowes▪ if not in outward troubles, yet in regard of inward corruptions, yea and in the thought or feare of ſome eclipſes of that ſun-ſhine. Thus in greateſt occaſion of hearty thankſgiving, there is juſt occaſion of humble petition. And where there is moſt cauſe of humiliation, there is alſo much cauſe of exultation.
                  Herein lyeth a maine difference betwixt mens eſtates here and hereafter. Hereafter in Heauen is nothing but matter of gratulation: in Hell is nothing but matter of exclamation and ejulation. On Earth there is a mixture of both.
                  As for adding invocation to gratulation, which is the particular here expreſſed, thereby our ſacrifice of praiſe is 1 Tim. 4. 5.ſanctified. As every creature of God is ſanctified by the word and prayer, ſo the actions that we performe, not pious and religious duties, and among them not the moſt principall, praiſing of God, excepted. The Word ſheweth it to be a warrantable duty. Prayer preſented to God in the name of Chriſt, maketh it an acceptable duty. And whereas every thing that paſſeth from us, is not onely imperfect thorow

the defect thereof, but alſo polluted by that ſinke of corruption Gratias Deo ag

                     PRayer to God is to be continued after the thing prayed for is granted. After that the Pſalmiſt in teſtimony of Gods hearing him had ſaid, Pſa. 118 21, 2

                        .
                     without ceaſing, give good evidence to the truth of the doctrine. For, if after God hath heard us, we ceaſe to pray, how can we pray without ceaſing, alwayes, in every ſeaſon? None can doubt but that God heard the prayers of his faithfull ſervants in all ages: yet never did any faithfull ſervant of God thereupon ceaſe calling upon God ſo long as hee lived. It is 1 Cor. 1. 2. Acts 9. 14.the ſtile of a true Saint to call upon God. If they ſhould ceaſe to call upon God, they would ſhew themſelves moſt 2 Tim. 2. 19.unworthy of that dignity.
                  
                     Why prayer is to be continued after prayer is heard. 1 Some things there be, which though on Gods part they be granted, yet are we not ſo ſetled and ſatisfied in the grant of them, but that we may waver and doubt in our faith about them: as, Remiſſion of ſinnes, Reconciliation with God, Iuſtification in his ſight, Conquest over our corruptions, Sanctifying graces, and ſuch like. Other things there be whereof we ſtand in daily need, as food, ſleepe,

apparell, and other bodily neceſſities: meanes of ſpirituall edification: and the aſſiſtance of Gods Spirit. And many evils there be wherinto we may fall again and again after we are delivered from them, as ſickneſſe, paine, impriſonment, captivity, &amp;c. Yea, and all manner of ſinnes, and temptations to ſinnes. In theſe reſpects, for the ſetling of our faith in that which God hath granted, for the continuall ſupply of ſuch things as we continually ſtand in need of, for keeping us from falling againe into ſuch evils as we have beene delivered from, it is needfull, it is uſefull to call upon God againe and againe even after he hath heard our prayer.
                  
                     Of theſe motives, See The Whole Armour of God. Treat. 3. Part. 1. §. 15, 16, &amp;c. 2 All thoſe generall motives that are of force to incite us to call on God before he hath heard us, as Gods command, Gods worſhip, Gods honour, the Neceſſity, utility, Efficacy, and Dignity of prayer, are alſo of force to provoke us to call on him after he hath heard us: yea as long as we liue.
                  3 Gods hearing our prayers is ſo farre from making us ceaſe to pray, as among other motives, it is a very forcible one to draw us to God again. For, it giveth ſpeciall evidence of Gods readines to heare, and ablenes to help, yea and of his mind and good-will to us in particular whom he hath heard.
                  
                     Reprehenſion of ſuch as being helped neglect God. How many are of a farre other mind then this Prophet was? If God have once heard them, and delivered them from a diſtreſſe, they have no care to call on God againe: eſpecially when they find and feele themſelves ſafe. What? Do they thinke that there is but one thing wherein God can do them good? Do they imagine themſelves ſo ſecure, as they cannot againe fall into ſuch need of Gods help as they were in before? or can God be, as man, weary of doing good? Are many ſupplications &amp; petitions troubleſome to God? Fie of all ſuch atheiſticall conceits. If any that have better underſtanding of God, and of their owne frailty, do notwithſtanding faile in this duty, having had good ſucceſſe in their former performing it, they are either as beaſts, which are affected onely with that which is preſent, or worſe then beaſts, uſing God, onely for their own turnes▪ and ſo care not to call on him but when they ſenſibly diſcerne an abſolute neceſſity for their own need and good.
                  
                     
For Gods ſake, for our owne ſake let us in ſeaſon, and out of ſeaſon, in diſtreſſe and out of diſtreſſe, to remove and prevent evills, to obtaine and retaine the things that are good for us, before and after God hath heard us, call upon his name. Let us that have called upon him, ſay, We will call upon the name of the Lord. Let this purpoſe be in our hearts, let this profeſſion be in our mouthes, let an anſwerable performance be in our deeds, and that ſo long as we ſhall abide in the land of the living where the Lord is called upon, that ſo we may indeed be in the number, and of the number of thoſe that call upon the name of the Lord.

                         2. THe firſt motive which the Prophet uſeth to quicken him the more to performe the forementioned duty of ſolemne praiſe is laid downe in this verſe. It is taken from that bond whereby he had voluntarily tied himſelfe, his Vow.
                  
                  
                     The argument may be thus framed.
                     That which by vow I am bound to pay, I will pay.
                     But by vow I am bound to take the cup of ſalvation, &amp;c.
                     Therefore I will take the cup of ſalvation, &amp;c.
                  
                  It appeareth by the manner of expreſſing this point, that in his diſtreſſe he had vowed a ſolemne, publike ſacrifice of praiſe unto the Lord, if the Lord would be pleaſed to releaſe him. For he ſaith not, I vow to pay this and that, but, I will pay what I have vowed.
                  The word thus tranſlated 
                        
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        
                     
                     I will pay, ſignifieth to finiſh and perfect a thing: and is here fitly uſed, to ſhew, that a vow till it be performed, is as an imperfect thing: performing

of it, is the perfecting of it: if at leaſt it be rightly made, and rightly accompliſhed.
                  He mentioneth 
                        
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        
                     
                     vowes in the plurall number for emphaſis ſake: either becauſe he oft vowed one and the ſame thing: or becauſe he vowed many things: or one ſolemne thing accompanied with many circumſtances about the manner of performing it. Neither of theſe do ſo croſſe the other, but but that all of them or many of them may ſtand together.
                  By a kind of property he applieth them to himſelfe, (my vowes) becauſe he himſelfe was the author of them: they were not impoſed upon him, but he voluntarily bound himſelfe thereto: and thereby he made them his owne proper debt, which he himſelfe ſtood bound to pay.
                  Theſe vowes were for performing of divine ſervices, ſuch as appertained onely to the true God. Wherefore, as they were made, ſo he promiſeth to performe them to the onely true God, the LORD.
                  
                  The latter clauſe ſetteth out the manner of performing the ſaid vowes. Wherein
                  1 He implieth the time, when he would do it, now. This ſignifieth the preſent time, and is oppoſed to all procraſtination and delay.
                  2 He intimateth the place, in the preſence of people, in ſuch places where people meet, which are publike aſſemblies: and thoſe not the leaſt, but the greateſt and ſolemneſt aſſemblies, where not a few, but all the people meet. And that it might not be thought that he intended any profane aſſemblies, he adds this particle of limitation, his, which hath relation to the LORD: ſo as he meaneth all Gods people who were wont all to meet together at the Tabernacle, where God was moſt ſolemnly worſhipped.
                  
                     Summe. 
                     In this patterne we have The diſpoſition of a Saint delivered out of a diſtreſſe.
                  His diſpoſition is manifeſted two waies.
                  1 While he was in diſtreſſe.
                  2 When he was delivered out of it.
                  The former is implied under the mention of vowes. For,

from thence we may well inferre that in his diſtreſſe he made vowes.

                  The latter is expreſſed. In which expreſſion is noted
                  1 The Matter or thing to be done. I will pay my vowes.

                  The thing implied, and taken for grant to be done, importeth, that
                  
                     I. Vowes may be made.
                  The Object to whom they are directed, The Lord, declareth, that
                  
                     II. Sacred vowes muſt be made to God.
                  The promiſe of performing them, I will pay, ſheweth, that
                  
                     III. Vowes made muſt be paid.
                  The time here ſet downe being the preſent, Now, implieth that
                  
                     IIII. The first opportunity to pay a vow must be taken.
                  The place where he profeſſeth to performe this duty is in the preſence of all people; It is very probable that his vowes were made in ſecret betwixt God and himſelfe. This promiſe then to performe them openly, and publikely intimateth, that
                  
                     V. Vowes ſeceetly made may be openly performed.
                  The limitation of the perſons with this particle of relation, HIS, which hath reference to God, doth us to wit, that
                  
                     VI. Saints are fitteſt witneſſes of ſacred duties.

                     II. Sacred vowes muſt be made to God.
                  Though theſe be two diſtinct points (for vowes are made to others then to Iehovah, the true God. Ier. 44. 2
                           •
                        .Idolaters make vowes to their idolls: and men make vowes one to another, and that not onely impiouſly, but piouſly and juſtly alſo, as husband and wife one to another, and ſubjects to their governours, ſervants to their maſters, and other to others) yet the vow which is here mentioned, and which thorowout the Scripture (for the moſt part) is approved, being a ſacred vow, which hath direct reſpect unto God, I will not ſever theſe two doctrines, but handle them as one. For, all that I ſhall ſpeake of vowes, ſhalbe of ſacred vowes to the Lord: for proofe whereof we have both Pſal 76. 11. Iſa. 19 21.divine precept and approved Gen. 28. 20, 21 Pſal 61. 8practiſe.
                  According to the words of the ſecond doctrine (under which the firſt is compriſed as Genus ſub ſpecie.the generall nature of a thing under every ſpecies and particular kind thereof) I intend to touch upon theſe two points.
                  
                     The nature of a vow. 1 The nature of a vow. 2 The directing of it to God.
                  1 To a vow properly ſo called, two things are eſpecially requiſite. 1 Intention. 2 Obtestation. Or to ſpeak more plainely, a deliberate Purpoſe, and an abſolute Promiſe. The former firſt bringeth on the latter. The latter faſt bindeth the former. A true intention and deliberate purpoſe muſt of neceſſity go before, becauſe otherwiſe a promiſe will not be made (for who will promiſe that which he intends not) or if it be made, there is little hope it wilbe performed: or if it ſhould be performed, yet the very making of it without an intention and purpoſe, is a plaine mocking of him who is a Acts 1. 24.
                     ſearcher of the heart, and Pſal 139. 2.
                     underſtandeth our thoughts afarre off. This therefore is neceſſary, but not ſufficient. For, a vow bindeth, as we ſhall hereafter ſhew: but every purpoſe bindeth not. 2 Cor. 1. 15, &amp;c.After Saint Paul was minded to

come to Corinth, he altered his purpoſe upon juſt occaſions. Many purpoſes come into mēs minds time after time. If they had the force of a binding vow, who ſhould be looſe? Nay with how many bounds would every Saint be bound? Their caſe would be inextricable. They would have ſo many fetters, and manicles, and chaines on them, as they could not tell how to ſhake them off: how to rid themſelves. Many weake Chriſtians that take every purpoſe for a vow, are exceedingly perplexed, partly thorow their care to performe thoſe purpoſes, and partly thorow their griefe at their failings in thoſe performances: ſuppoſing that they have broken ſo many vowes. But to the eſſence of a vow muſt be added an abſolute promiſe. Abſolute, I ſay, in relation to mans Vowes abſolute.faithfull endeavour with his uttermoſt power to performe it: not in relation (or rather oppoſition) to Gods purpoſe or providence, to his will or leave. For, ſo can no man make an abſolute promiſe. God can croſſe and hinder him. Iam. 4. 13, &amp;cSaint Iames doth juſtly taxe ſuch as in this caſe make abſolute, or rather peremptory promiſes. This abſolute promiſe I expreſſed under this word, obteſtation, which is a fit word to expreſſe the nature of a vow. It ſignifieth a taking of God to witneſſe, and that in particular for performing his purpoſe. This obteſtation, maketh it indeed a vow.
                  Obiect. Many vowes recorded in Scripture are conditionall: as Iacobs, Gen. 28. 20.If God will be with me, &amp;c. And Hannahs, 1 Sam. 1. 11.If thou wilt indeed, &amp;c. and others.
                  
                  
                     Anſw. A conditionall ſentence doth not neceſſarily importa doubtfull matter, but is oft uſed as a ground of an abſolute and undeniable concluſion. As where Eliah ſaith, 1 King. 18. 21
                     If the Lord be God, follow him. Doth he here make any queſtion of the Lords being God? Farre be ſuch a thought. But hereby he brings them the more evidently to ſee their folly, and drawes them from Baal, to follow the Lord: as will clearely appeare if we bring it into the forme of a ſyllogiſme, thus, If the Lord be God, follow him. But the Lord is God. Therefore follow him. A condition or ſuppoſition reſpecteth the manner, rather then the matter of a vow.

When in making a vow a neceſſary ſuppoſition is uſed, the vow is never a whit the leſſe abſolute, but the more diſcreet. As when I thus vow, If the Lord aſſiſt me, I will every morning pray before I go out of doores. Such a vow was Iacobs.
                  
                  2 Annah and Iacob and others like to them might have by ſpeciall and divine inſtinct, ſome aſſurance of that which they expreſſed in forme of ſuppoſition, and in that reſpect their vow be abſolute. Queſtionleſſe Hannah had aſſurance that the Lord would give her a man-child, which made her in ſuch particular and expreſſe termes vow to give him to 
                     1 Sam. 1. 
                           •

                     the Lord all the daies of his life, and that there ſhould ne raſor come upon his head.
                  
                  3 When a vow is made upon a condition, if the condition hold and be, as it is ſuppoſed, accompliſhed, then the vow remaineth as abſolute, as if there were no condition. And the maker of the vow is as much bound in this caſe to performe it, as if it had beene made in the moſt abſolute termes that can be. Yea the condition may be ſuch, as it will more bind a man to his vow, then if there had beene no condition: as when the condition is a kind of conſideration or a benefit in conſideration whereof the vow is made. Thus if in a ſtorme on ſea, a man vow to give ſo much to the poore, if he be brought in ſafety to his country: This providence of God in keeping him ſafe, and bringing him home, more binds him to that worke of charity, then the moſt abſolute vow that he could have made. Gen 28. 20.
                     Iacob having made ſuch a vow, neglecteth to performe it in due ſeaſon.

                  Thus then it is evident that a vow is an abſolute promiſe of a deliberate purpoſe. Such a promiſe on ſuch a ground doth as much order and bind the promiſe-maker, as the command of one in authority doth order and bind him that is under authority.
                  2 Such promiſes of ſacred duties are to be directed unto

God, to whom vowes are moſt properly due. The charge of making vowes mentioned in Scripture directeth us to God onely. Pſal. 76. 11.
                     Vow and pay unto the Lord your God.

                     Ecl. 5 4.
                     When thou vowest a vow to God. To God are all the approved vowes in Scripture directed. In this reſpect are vowes intituled Gods vowes. Pſal. 56. 12.
                     Thy vowes, ſaith the Pſalmiſt to God, are upon me.
                  
                  We heard that a vow ariſeth from a true intention. Who can diſcerne that, but he who ſearcheth the heart? To whom doe we owe ſuch abſolute homage, as to bind our ſelves in ſuch a ſacred and inviolable band, as a vow is, but onely to God, eſpecially in ſuch divine duties as are proper to a vow.
                  
                     
                        Vowes may inwardly be made.

                      In regard of this object to whom our vowes are to be directed, it is not neceſſary that they be uttered with words, or manifeſted by ſignes. When Hannah vowed her ſolemne vow unto God, it is ſaid, She ſpake in her heart, (1 Sam. 1. 13.) Indeed the earneſtneſſe of her affection, made her move her lips, and uſe ſuch outward motions as Elie diſcerned her to be in ſome paſſion: but thoſe were no ſignes of a vow. No creature could certenly have knowne thereby that ſhe vowed a vow. As true and full a reſolution, yea, and obteſtation and promiſe too, may proceed from the ſoule by the very thoughts thereof, and be as well knowne to God, and as ſtrongly bind a man, as by words or ſignes.
                  Words and ſignes are of good uſe to teſtifie to man ſuch vowes as wee make to God, that thereby wee may bee held ſomewhat the cloſer to them: yea and to quicken our owne ſpirits the more, words are of uſe. But to the being 
                        Volum eſt teſtificatio quadam promiſſionis ſpontanea quae Deo, &amp;c. Magiſt. Sent l. 4. Diſtinc 38. Popiſh vowes to Saints.of a vow they are not neceſſary. He that defined a vow, to be A teſtification of a willing promiſe which ought to be made to God, &amp;c. came nigh the mark in directing a vow to God, but fell ſhort in reſtraining a vow to an outward teſtification, if he meant onely an outward teſtification.
                  But to returne to the point, God being the proper object to whom ſacred vowes are to bee directed, what may bee thought of thoſe vowes which Papiſts (not unlike to the

idolatrous Iſraelites who vowed vowes to the Queene of heaven, Ier. 44. 25.) vow to her whom they ſtile the

                     I vow to God, and to bleſſed Mary, and to all the Saints that I will obey ſuch and ſuch a Prelate. Hereof they give this reaſon, that glorified Saints are mediators and interceſſors by whom we receive good things from God: Yea they are Gods by participation. Thus they adde blaſphemy to blaſphemy: ratifying a blaſphemous poſition by a more blaſphemous confirmation.
                  Concerning the poſition it ſelfe of making vowes to Saints,
                  1 The holy Scriptures give no intimation of any ſuch matter; but where it maketh any mention of vowes, it directeth them to God: whereof the Papiſts are not ignorant. For, they who write of this controverſie, bring no ſhew of any proofe out of Gods Word for making ſacred vowes to creatures.
                  2 All both ancient and later divines, both Proteſtants and Papiſts that treat of vowes, define it to be a promiſe whereby he that makes it, binds himſelfe in a ſacred and ſolemne manner to God.
                  3 None denie but that a ſacred vow is a religious act, and a part of divine worſhip, and in that reſpect due onely to God. To make it to any other is plaine and palpable idolatry: yet ordinarily their vowes uſe to be made to this Saint and that Saint.
                  
                     Exhortation to vow. For our parts, let us ſo wiſely avoid their deteſtable exceſſe in making vowes to whom they ought not, as we fall not into a careleſſe neglect of the duty, by making no vowes Dum vitant ſtulti vitia, in contraria currunt. Hor. Sat. 2. l. 1.
                     at all. It is a fooles part ſo farre to fly from one extreme as to fall into another. As occaſion is offered, and as we find any need, let us among other evidences of that reſpect which we owe and beare unto God, give this, of vowing and voluntarily binding our ſelves to doe that which we ſee meet and behoofull to be done for the honour of his name, and our well pleaſing of him. Eſpecially if wee have juſt

cauſe to ſuſpect our ſelves, that if we be left looſe and at liberty, we ſhall (thorow the temptations whereunto we are ſubject, or thorow our owne indiſpoſition and backwardneſſe to the duties which in our judgements we conceive to be moſt behoofull) faile to performe them. In ſuch caſes to bind our ſelves by a ſacred vow to a bounden duty, as it teſtifieth a wiſe jealouſie and holy feare that we have of the proneſſe of our fleſh to ſtart backe from good intentions, and motions of the Spirit, ſo it manifeſteth our true and earneſt deſire of doing that which we are perſwaded wilbe pleaſing and acceptable to the Lord: yea ſo true and earneſt a deſire, as we will not have it left to our liberty to doe it, or not to doe it: leaſt any thing might fall out to alter our mind. Zealous Martyrs, upon a ſetled reſolution not to ſtart in ſhew from that profeſſion which they are about to ſeale with their bloud, being jealous of their weake fleſh, and ſenſibleneſſe of paine, have deſired to bee faſt bound to the ſtake. A ſacred vow is as an iron gin to a tender and good conſcience.

But for not paying vowes it is ſaid, The Lord thy God will ſurely require it of thee: and it would be ſinne in thee. They who vow and pay not, are counted ſuch fooles, as God hath no pleaſure in. It is therefore better that thou ſhouldeſt not vow, then that thou ſhouldeſt vow and not pay. Frequent are the profeſſions which the Pſalmiſt maketh of paying his Pſal. 22. 25.—66. 13.—

Among other inſtances take notice of the ſolemne vow he made for bringing the Arke of the Lord into a ſetled place, (Pſal. 132. 2, 3, 4, 5.) and withall take notice of his care to performe it (1 Chro. 13. 2, &amp;c. and 15. 1, &amp;c. &amp; 17. 1, &amp;c.)

Sinnes againſt the third commandement, as blaſphemy, perjury, and breach of vowes, pierce deepe into a ſenſible conſcience. But though they make deepe wounds, yet is there ſufficient vertue in the bloud of Chriſt to heale them: The

                     bloud of Christ cleanſeth from all ſinne. Apply that precious bloud to the wounds of thy ſoule. Seeing that which is paſt and done, cannot be recalled and undone, it is not meet that the wounds of thy conſcience ſhould continually be kept open, till all the life thereof be cleane waſted. Therefore in craving pardon for this ſinne, beleeve that it is pardoned: and then be more watchfull over thy ſelfe, that thou fall not againe and againe into that ſin.
                  
                     Direction for keeping vowes 2 To redreſſe for the time to come, what hath beene heretofore amiſſe, let theſe following rules be carefully obſerved.
                  1 On thoſe vowes whereunto by vertue of thy Chriſtian profeſſion thou art bound, being ſolemnly made at thy Baptiſme, at receiving the Lords Supper, and in publike prayer, oft and ſeriouſly meditate, day and night, when thou lieſt downe, and when thou riſeſt up, when thou tarieſt at home, and when thou goeſt abroad, eſpecially when thou undertakeſt any duty of piety, and art about in prayer to preſent thy ſelfe before God; but moſt of all when thou art preſent at others Baptiſme, and heareſt the very vow which thou thy ſelfe mad'ſt before God. Frequent meditation on vowes, is an eſpeciall meanes to keep them freſh in memory: a freſh remembrance of them putteth life into the conſcience, and maketh it ſenſible: a quick and ſenſible conſcience is afraid of wounds. Feare of wounds makes carefull in avoiding the things which make wounds: as breach of vowes doth. This therefore muſt needes bee a good helpe for keeping vowes, and performing them.
                  2 Oft renew thy vowes, and ſo bind thy ſelfe againe and againe thereto. A vow renewed is as new made. Men uſe

to be very tender of their vowes, when they are new made, or while they remaine freſh: as they are of a new ſute of apparell, or of their linnen while it is cleane and neate.
                  This direction of renewing vowes is to be applied to vowes of neceſſary and bounden duties. But if vowes made be of ſuch circumſtances as are not neceſſary, yet very difficult, and cannot eaſily be performed, and much trouble and Si praeproperè ſa ct

                     entangle the conſcience, then, they being thorow weakeneſſe broken, the wiſeſt and ſafeſt courſe is earneſtly to crave pardon (as we heard before) for that which is paſt, and to take heed of the like folly, in enſnaring our ſelves for the time to come. If a thing be prepoſterouſly done, raſhneſſe is rather to be redreſſed then the promiſe performed.
                  3 When thou art tempted to a ſinne, bring that ſinne to the touchſtone of thy vowes, and try whether it be not againſt them. This triall wilbe a meanes to make thee think of thy vowes, and to be more carefull in keeping them, and in reſiſting temptations againſt them. When the Rechabites 
                     Ier. 3. 56. &amp;c.were tempted to drinke wine, they conſidered that it was againſt an ancient vow, and thereupon were reſtrained from doing it. They were not ignorant of the damage of breaking vowes.
                  
                     Danger in breaking vowes no ſufficient cauſe to keepe from making vowes Pro. 28. 9.

This is no good conſequence: For, a good thing is not therefore to be wholly omitted, becauſe there is danger in an ill performing of it, or in a careleſſe neglect of proſecuting that which is begun. He that turneth away his care from hearing the law, even his prayer ſhalbe abomination. Is it therefore the ſafeſt not to pray at all? Fie upon ſuch a conſequence. The juſt conſequence to be thereupon inferred is this, Therefore turne thine care to the law and ſo pray. Such a conſequence from ſuch a ground doth the Apoſtle make: for where hee had ſaid, Whoſoever, ſhall eate the bread, and 
                     1 Cor. 11. 27, 28.
                     drinke the cup of the Lord unworthily, ſhalbe guilty of the body and bloud of the Lord, Hee addeth as a juſt conſequence following thereupon, Let a man examine himſelfe, and ſo let him
                     
                     eat of that bread, and drinke of that cup. He ſaith not, let him forbeare to come to the Lords Table. In like manner the danger and dammage of breaking vowes ought not to reſtraine us from making needfull and uſefull vowes: but it ought to make us carefull and conſcionable in performing them.

Ye will faile if ye preſume of your ſelves. But if ye reſt on him to whom you vow, vow in the name of God, and ye ſhall aſſuredly performe it.
                  6 In making thy vow, pray for ability to keepe it. Yea time after time, till it be performed, pray for this grace. So oft as thou makeſt a ſolemne prayer betwixt God and thy ſelfe, let one petition be for keeping thy vow. And if thy vow be of ſome duty to be in performing all thy life▪long, all thy life long pray for this in particular.

Performe what thou haſt vowed: performe it to the full. Of all ſacrifices that which was brought for accompliſhment of a vow

                  This then queſtionleſſe is an eſpeciall occaſion of not performing

many vowes, that they are not performed in their ſeaſon: but opportunity is let ſlip. Had not God himſelfe Gen. 35. 1.prevented Iacob, it is very likely that he would have failed herein. For he let ſlip his opportunity. We may obſerve it in all mens affaires, that by procraſtination their reſolution waxeth more and more ſlake. In nothing is this more verified then in matters of piety, matters wherein we have to do with God: and that both by reaſon of Satans ſubtilty and ſedulity, endeavouring with might and maine to hinder us in all pious courſes, and to weaken all the helpes we have therein (among which, vowes are none of the ſleightieſt) and alſo by reaſon of our own backwardnes and dulnes thereunto. Satan by time gaines great advantage: and we by time looſe as much, in that our zeale is prone to ſlake in the heat of it.

Strike the iron therefore, as it is in the proverbe, ſtrike it while it is hot. It is then fit to be wrought upon for any thing. Take the firſt opportunity, which is the fitteſt ſeaſon. If in any thing thou wilt make ſpeed, and manifeſt forwardneſſe, do it in performing thy vowes. Haſt thou made a vow whileſt thou art at ſea? pay it ſo ſoone as thou commeſt to land: if thou canſt pay it ſo ſoone. Haſt thou vowed in ſickneſſe? let the payment of it, be the firſt thing thou doeſt upon thy recovery. So on other like occaſions. Haſt thou by vow bound thy ſelfe to read the word and pray every morning? Let this be the firſt worke thou doeſt being up. If thou haſt any weighty buſineſſe to doe betimes, riſe the ſooner, that thy vow may bee firſt done. Let all things give place to it: it, to nothing. A man that is able and willing to pay a debt, accounts no money his owne, till the debt be paid. He will keepe in mind and memory the day of paiment, he will watch for it: his money (as we ſay) burneth in his baggs, till it be paid. Account thy vow a debt. No debt can be more due. No bond more binding. A man of his word had as leave forfeit a bond, as faile of his word. Be thou a man of thy word with God. Pay thy debt: performe thy vow, and that on the day of paiment, in due time; even

                     now, if the now be come, Deferre not to pay thy vowes. Very pertinent to this purpoſe, and emphaticall is this phraſe of the Pſalmiſt, Thy vowes are upon mee O God. Though hee Pſal 56. 12.made the vowes, yet he ſtiles them Gods vowes; becauſe being made to God, they were as a debt due to him, as a bond made by a debtor to a creditor, is not now the debters, but the creditors. Thus then he accounts his vow as a due debt unto God; Thereupon he adds, Thy vowes are upon me, 
                     Vowes are debts.whereby he ſhewes, that as a faithfull debter, who hath a mind to diſcharge his bond, oft thinkes of the time of paiment; and in that reſpect his debt lyeth as a burden upon him, neither can he be quiet, till it be paid (As a porter that hath a burden on him, is not at reſt till he be freed from it) ſo this Pſalmiſt had the vow which hee had made to God, as a debt, as a burden, upon him, whereby hee ſhewes, that his mind and deſire was, with the firſt opportunity to be eaſed thereof, which could not be, but by performing the ſame. Such reſpect let us have to the vowes that we make to God, ſuch let our care be in performing of the ſame, and that with all ſpeed, ſo as we may truly uſe theſe words, Thy vowes are upon me O God.

                     VOwes ſecretly made may be openly performed. This is to be limited according to the nature of the vow. Such things may be vowed, as in the performance of them, it is not meet that Mat. 6. 3.
                     the left hand know what the right hand doth. The doctrine therefore ſaith not, muſt be, but may be openly performed. So were moſt (if not all) of the approved vowes in Scripture. Pſal. 22. 25.
                     I will praiſe thee in the great congregation (ſaith the Pſalmiſt) and pay my vowes before them that feare thee: and againe, —66. 13.
                     I will go into thine houſe with burnt offerings: I will pay thee my vowes. 
                     1 Sam. 1. 24, &amp;c.
                     Hannah brought her ſonne which ſhee vowed to the Lord, unto the Tabernacle at a feſtivall time when all the people aſſembled thither. Gen. 35. 7.
                     Iacob built an altar, a viſible and open memoriall

of his vow. Num. 21. 2, 3.the Iſraelites gave a name (as a publike proofe of the performance of their vow) to the place where their vow was performed.
                  1 Hereby God is more glorified. An open teſtification of that reſpect which Saints beare to God, and of that care they have to bind themſelves to do ſervice to him, maketh much to his honour.
                  2 The Church is hereby much edified. Inſtances of Saints ſtanding to their holy reſolutions, and performing their pious purpoſes, cheere the ſtrong, ſtrengthen the weake: and thus is the Church built up.
                  3 They that make the vowes, by this open manner of making them good, cannot but bee much more cheered in ſpirit, when they ſee their good intentions ſo much to tend to the advancement of Gods glory, and others good.
                  
                     Inſtruction in the beſt kind of vowes. They who in teſtimony of their due reſpect to God, and in way of gratitude are moved to make vowes to the Lord, let them here learne what are the beſt kind of vowes, and by what vows they may give moſt honour to God, and do moſt good to themſelves and others: even ſuch as may be openly performed in publike aſſemblies. For a Prince, a Noble-man, a Magiſtrate, or any other of great eſteeme, of high place, of good note and name, to vow to joyne himſelfe with aſſemblies that uſe to worſhip God together, to vow to maintaine truth and purity of religion in the places where he liveth, is a worthy vow. For Miniſters to vow to preach the word where people are gathered together diligently and faithfully, a worthy vow. For ſuch as are taken captives, in danger on the fea, impriſoned, viſited with ſickneſſe, or any other way ſo diſtreſſed, as they are reſtrained from the publike places of Gods worſhip, to vow when they are delivered openly, publikely to give thankes to God, a worthy vow. In common judgements, eſpecially of plague, of famine, of ſword, ſuch vowes of publike gratitude are to be made, and publikely to bee performed. It is not enough to vow ſecret duties betwixt God and our ſelves, nor yet private duties in our families, but by this patterne we have direction

and incitation for more open, common, and publike duties; which are more honourable kinds of vowes. Yet that herein is a limitation, the next doctrine will ſhew.

                     I will pay my vowes before them that feare him. None but true Saints do truly feare God.
                  1 This property of Gods people, that they feare the Lord, ſheweth that they will make the beſt uſe of ſuch ſacred, ſolemne duties performed in their preſence. They will glorifie God for this your zeale. They will joyne their ſpirits with your ſpirits in this open performance of duty. They will become followers of you, and learne of you to vow and pay unto the Lord, and that openly, publikely.
                  2 As for others, they are no better then ſuch hogges and dogges, as are not meet to have ſuch precious pearles, and holy things caſt before them: leſt they trample them under their feet.
                  
                     Direction for perſons among whom vowes are paid. Be wiſe now ye that are moved to give open and publike teſtification of your inward and private reſolution. Be wiſe in making choice of your company. You that have eſcaped ſundry dangers on ſea and land, that have had victory over enemies, that have beene eaſed and recovered of any maladies, that have beene preſerved from the plague, that have had any other evidence of Gods ſpeciall providence and favour, let not play-houſes, let not tavernes, ale-houſes, and tobacco-houſes, let not aſſemblies of profane perſons, of ſwearers, of drunkards, of riotous and licentious perſons, be the places whither you reſort to recount the deliverances which God hath given you. This rather beſeemeth ſuch as have vowed vowes to Bacchus, to Ceres, to Priapus, to

                     Venus, yea and to Devils, then to the great Lord of heaven and earth. Aſſociate your ſelves with the Saints, with ſuch as feare God, with ſuch as may encourage you in that which you do well, and inſtruct and direct you in that whereof you are ignorant, and wherein you do amiſſe. Goe to that place where that God who hath preſerved, delivered, or any way bleſſed you, delighteth to be, where he moſt manifeſteth his preſence, where he expecteth that your vow ſhould be paid to him. Let your heart bee ſet upon that place, while by Pſal 84. 1, &amp;c.force you are kept from it, as Davids was. So ſoone as poſſibly you can, come to it. You Captaines, Souldiers, Merchants, Mariners, Travellers, or others that come from the ſea, or other dangerous places; you women that are ſafely delivered in childbed, you that have beene ſicke and are recovered, you that have beene cut of the ſtone, or cured of any other malady, you that are looſed out of priſon, you that after any reſtraint have liberty, Let this be the firſt publike place that you come unto. So ſoone as you can ſay, ſay it in truth, ſay it and do it, I will pay my vowes unto the Lord now in the preſence of all his people.
                  
                  Amen.

This title is attributed to men in a double reſpect. 1 Paſſively, in regard of Gods mind and affection to them. 2 Actively, in regard of their minde and affection to others. Gods mercy and kindneſſe is great towards them: and their mercy and kindneſſe is great towards their brethren. They are therfore by a kind of excellency, and property ſtiled Iſa. 57. 1.

                     Thoſe whom God followeth with bounty, or to whom God extendeth his bounty.

This latter I take to be the moſt proper to this place: for the word being paſſively taken for ſuch as are made partakers of Gods kindneſſe, it ſheweth the reaſon of that high account wherein God hath them, even his owne grace and favour. We have a word in Engliſh that in this paſſive ſignification fitly anſwereth the Hebrew, which is this, favourite.

                     bloud is ſaid to bee the life of living creatures. Very fitly is this privative, death, mentioned in ſetting forth Gods care over their life, becauſe by their death it is manifeſted, partly by preſerving them from death, and partly by providing for them in death.

                     Inſtruction in the prerogative of Saints. Good and great ground of comfort have Saints by reaſon of this prerogative, that they are the favourites of the great King. What needfull thing doe they want that they may not confidently expect from this their Liege? What hurtfull thing need they feare? Is not the King who favours them able to ſupply all their neceſſities? Is he not able to protect them from all enmities? If he be, what doubt can be made of the one, or of the other? Conſider what mortall Monarchs do for their favourites. Eſt. 6. 3, &amp;c.They invent, they conſult how to doe them honour. Though it oft fall out that they have unworthy favourites, inſtance Haman, yet a King can deny his favourite nothing. Let a favourite aske Honours, Mannours, Offices, Immunities, for himſelfe, or for his friends, he ſoone obtaineth what he asketh. Pro▪ 16. 15.
                     In the light of the kings countenance is life: and his favour is as a cloud of the later raine: and as

Such an one ſcorneth the envy, the diſdaine, the backbiting, and all that the vulgar can doe againſt him. As for all his enemies, he puffeth at them. If it be thought an happineſſe to be a mortall Kings favourite, what is it then to be a favourite of the King of Kings? Kings on earth are not alwayes able to do what they will. Their favourites may deſire, and they may be willing to grant, more then they can. They have not alwayes underſtanding to know what is beſt for their favourites. Their favourites may beg, and they give that which is pernicious. They doe not alwaies retaine the ſame mind. Their favour may be cleane alienated from their old favourites, and caſt upon new. They do not alwayes live. They may die before their favourites, and their favourites then be the worſe dealt withall even for that favour ſake which by the deceaſed King was ſhewed unto them. Moſt of theſe may be exemplified in Ahaſhucroſh and his favourite Haman. But the Lord our God is ſubject to none of theſe. He is able to doe what he will: and what his favourites can juſtly aske. He knoweth what is good, what not good to be granted to his

favourites. He is alwais of the ſame mind. His favor is ſtable, and perpetuall. He ever liveth. It never did, it never ſhall, it cannot repent any, to have beene this Kings favourite.

God ſtill remaines the ſame: the ſame in his eſſence, the ſame in his mind &amp; affection to ſuch as are ſo minded and affected towards him as his ancient favourites were. Wherefore though Abel, Henoch, Noah, Abraham, and other favourites be dead and gone, yet let their ſpirit appeare to live in us: that, while we live, God may not want favourites on earth: but that we for the preſent may ſhew that we have ſo ſet before us the life of our predeceſſors, as we become examples and patternes to our ſucceſſors.

                  §. 98. Of the expoſition and reſolution of part of the ſixteenth Verſe.
                  PSAL. CXVI. XVI.
                  O LORD, truly I am thy ſervant, I am thy ſervant, and the ſonne of thine hand-maid.
                  THe See §. 2.third reaſon whereby the Prophet was the rather induced to render ſolemne praiſe to God, is here laid downe. And it is taken from the conſtant favour of God towards him. God of old had taken him even from his mothers wombe to be his ſervant, and ſtill continued that grace to him. Therefore he would praiſe him. The argument may be brought to this briefe forme.

                      Godsancient ſervants muſt praiſe him.

                      But I am Gods ancient ſervant.
                  
                     
                        
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        
                      Therefore I muſt praiſe him.
                  I deny not, but that this acknowledgement of Gods ancient kindneſſe to himſelfe in particular may be referred to the argument indefinitely ſet down in the former verſe, and here added as an application thereof. For, having indefinitely noted how the death of Gods favourites was precious in his ſight: here he giveth inſtance thereof in himſelfe, and ſaith, I am Gods ſervant: and my death was precious to him: for he looſed my bands. This reference is not impertinent. But I take this for another diſtinct argument, rather then for an application, or confirmation of the former.

                  Sundry are the reſpects wherein Saints may truly and properly be termed Gods ſervants.

                  2 As Ier. 25. 9.many naturall men; being deputed by the Lord to ſpeciall functions and ſervices.

                  4 As true, faithfull profeſſors, who doe indeed take God for their Lord. In the three former reſpects, (as Gods creatures, as deputed to ſelect functions by God, as profeſſors of the name of God) others are ſervants of God as well as Saints: but the fourth reſpect, which is the moſt honourable,

profitable, and comfortable reſpect is proper and peculiar to Saints: and that two waies,
                  1 By reaſon of Gods affection to them.
                  2 By reaſon of their diſpoſition to God.
                  1 God accounts them members of his houſe, and anſwerably affects them as of his houſhold. In regard of ſuch an affection he thus ſaith of Moſes. 
                     Num. 12. 7.
                     My ſervant Moſes is faithfull in all my houſe. Yea as united unto Chriſt, and in him adopted and accepted, he ſaith to Saints, as Iſa. 42. 1.to Chriſt, Behold my ſervants, whom I uphold, mine elect, in whom my ſoule delighteth.
                  
                  2 They are affected to the Lord as dutifull, faithfull, gratefull ſervants. An heathen Monarch obſerved thus much, and thereupon ſaith, Dan. 6.

                  This relation thus taken affordeth matter of gratulation and direction to ſuch as can truly and juſtly apply it to themſelves.
                  
                     Gratulation, by reaſon of the dignity of it.
                  
                     Direction, by reaſon of the duties that are thereupon expected.
                  1 It is here as a dignity expreſſed, and made the ground of gratulation. And that not without cauſe. For though this title, ſervant, be in it ſelfe a meane title, yet in relation to God it is an high, an honourable title. The greateſt noble-man in a kingdome thinks himſelfe honoured with this title, The Kings ſervant. But what are mortall Monarchs to the immortall and incomprehenſible King of kings? Not onely Patriarchs, Kings, Prophets, and Apoſtles, but Chriſt the Sonne of God, thought himſelfe dignified with this title ſervant, in relation to God. It is therefore a noble ſervice whereof David here ſaith to God, I am thy ſervant, &amp;c. and bleſſed Mary to the angell, Behold the handmaid of the Lord. Moſes alſo and other Saints were ſuch ſervants. Neither is it any marvell that holy men were dignified with this title, whereas the Father thus ſpeaketh to his Sonne, It is a great thing for thee to be called my ſervant. Such is the Maieſty,

Omnipotency, Immutability, Perpetuity, Integrity, Clemency, Mercy, Bounty, and Excellency every way of this Lord, as it nor will nor can repent any one to have any relation to him, or dependance upon him: which the royall Prophet well underſtood, when he ſaid to this Lord, A day in thy courts is better then a thouſand. I had rather be a doore-keepein the houſe of my God, then to dwell in the tents of wickedneſſe, Pſal. 84. 10.
                  
                     Particular prerogatives of Gods ſervants. The particular dignities and prerogatives of the Lords ſervants, are ſuch as theſe.
                  1 They are all free, 1 Cor. 7. 22.
                  2 All the ſervices which the Lord enjoyneth are faire ſervices, Pſal. 19. 7, &amp;c. 1 Ioh. 5. 3.
                  3 The Lord gives ability to doe the worke which he expects and exacts of us, Ioel. 2. 29. Phil. 2. 13.
                  4 He accepteth and approveth what he enableth his ſervants to doe, Mat. 25. 21. Iob. 1. 8, 9.
                  5 He bountifully rewardeth every good thing. His wages are good and great, Mat. 10. 42. &amp; 19. 29. &amp; 25. 21.
                  6 Gods ſervants get favours even for others alſo, Iob 42. 8.
                  7 They are ſure of ſafe protection from all hurtfull things, and of ſufficient proviſion of all needfull good things, Iſa. 65. 13, 14.
                  8 The Lord taketh care of his ſervants ſeed, Pſal. 69. 36.
                  
                     Direction to duties of ſervants. 2 This relation directeth us unto ſuch duties as here follow.
                  1 To honour our Lord, Mal. 1. 6.
                  2 To obey him, Mat. 8. 9. Col. 3. 22.
                  3 To feare him with an holy trembling, Eph. 6. 5.
                  4 To be faithfull to him, Num. 12. 7.
                  5 To do all that we do on duty, Luk. 17. 10.
                  6 To be no men-pleaſers, Gal. 1. 10.
                  7 To ſerve him onely: not to ſerve Mammon or any other maſter, ſave the Lord, Mat. 6. 24.
               
               
                  
                  §. 100. Of Saints confidence in Gods mind to them and theirs to God.
                  II. §. 98.
                     SAints may confidently profeſſe that relation which God is pleaſed ſhall paſſe betwixt him and them. This confidence is manifeſted ſometimes in the acknowledgement of that part of the relation which is on mans part: and other times that which is on Gods part. In this text, that on mans part is profeſſed, truly I am thy ſervant. So where he ſaith, Pſal. 95. 7.
                     We are the people of his paſture, and the ſheepe of his hands, People and ſheepe are notes of relation on mans part. So are clay, and worke of Gods hands, where the Prophet ſaith, Iſa. 64. 8.
                     We are the clay, and the worke of thy hands. On Gods part, he ſaith, O Lord, thou art our father, and thou our potter. To like purpoſe are other like notes of relation on Gods part, with confidence profeſſed, thus, Pſal. 89.

                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        
                     
                     truly, is not expreſſed, yet the manner of expreſſing the notes of relation on the one, and the other part, import much confidence.
                  Theſe and ſuch other relations betwixt God and man, give aſſurance of Gods gracious acceptation and favour. If God meant not to deale with us, as a Father with children, as an Husband with his wife, as a King with Subjects, as a Maſter with ſervants, as a Shepheard with ſheepe, as a Potter with pots (for all theſe, and other like notes of relation betwixt God and us, are expreſſed in Scripture) would God have ſuffered ſuch relations to be betwixt him and us? They are not complementall, and meere titular phraſes, but expreſſions of true, reall unions and communions.
                  
                     Inſtruction in a ground of confidence. Take notice here, of the ground of true, holy boldneſſe and confidence. Wiſely and diligently obſerve how God offers himſelfe unto thee, what bond of relation hee ſuffereth to paſſe betwixt him and thee. As Saints in former times have

done, do thou in thy time. Plead them before God. Confidently plead them, to ſharpen thy prayer, to ſtrengthen thy faith. Say to God, Thou, art O Lord, truly thou art my God, my King, my Father, my Maſter, my Maker, my Shepheard, 
                     
                        Reſpicias populum tuum, qui quondam tuus eſt appellatus populus. Hier. Comment. l 17 in Iſa. 64. How Gods mind to us may bee knowne.&amp;c. And on the other ſide, I am of thy people, &amp; of thy flock, thy child, thy ſervant, the worke of thy hands. Behold thy people, which have of old beene called thy people. Theſe ſure grounds of faith will enlarge thine heart, and open thy mouth, and embolden thee both to pray to God, and to expect from God what thou prayeſt for.
                  That thou maiſt doe this with the more ſtedfaſtneſſe of faith, ſearch thine heart, examine thy diſpoſition, try how thou ſtandeſt affected towards God. If thou have the mind of a child, a ſervant, a creature, a ſheepe towards God, thou maiſt reſt upon it, God hath an anſwerable mind to thee. Yea becauſe God hath the minde of a father and maſter to thee, thou haſt an anſwerable mind to him. The reflection of his reſpect to thee on thy heart, worketh reſpect in thee towards him.
               
               
                  §. 101. Of Saints earneſtneſſe in preſsing their intereſt in God.
                  III. § 98.
                     COnfidence in the intereſt which Saints have in God, maketh them earnest in preſſing it. It maketh them againe and againe to preſſe the ſame thing, which is an undoubted evidence of great ardency. Did not the fire of a zealous ſpirit even flame out of the mouth of him that doth thus redouble a like relation before God, Iſa. 63▪ 16:
                     Doubtleſſe thou art our father, though Abraham be ignorant of us, and Iſrael acknowledge us not: thou, O Lord, art our Father, our Redeemer. The like is manifeſted by the multiplication of ſeverall words to the ſame ſenſe, thus, Pſa. 80. 14 15
                     Behold and viſit this vine: and the vineyard which thy right hand hath planted: and the branch which thou mad'st ſtrong for thy ſelfe. Vine, vineyard, branch, import one and the ſame thing.
                  Such confidence as is rightly grounded on an aſſured intereſt

in God, perſwadeth a mans heart that God cannot ſuffer him to call and cry upon him, and not heare him. Therefore if God at firſt heare not, he will not preſently give over, but rather cry the more earneſtly and inſtantly till the Lord doe heare him. Indeed they that know no title that they can make to God, nor believe any intereſt they have in him, may ſoone be driven away: as 1 Sam. 28. 6, 7
                     Saul, who, when the Lord anſwered him not, preſently enquired after a witch. But they that well knew their intereſt in God, tooke another courſe. Pſal. 80 4, &amp;cWhen God ſeemed to be angry against their prayer, they humbly expoſtulate the caſe with God: they preſſe the former favours that God ſhewed to them, and that title which they had in him, and thereupon once and againe moſt earneſtly they pray that God would cauſe his face to ſhine upon them, reſting on this, that they ſhalbe ſaved.

Get confidence in God; and that by conſidering, as what he is in himſelfe, a potent, prudent, faithfull, mercifull God: ſo what he is to thee, Thy God, thy King, thy Father, &amp;c. And give evidence of this thy confidence, by ſtirring up thy ſpirit to depend on him, who gives ſo juſt cauſe to make thee depend on him. Oft and ſeriouſly meditate on thoſe grounds, and when thou art before God, whether it be in humiliation or gratulation, call them to mind, preſſe them againe and againe. Imitate the worthy patternes that in this caſe are preſcribed unto us in Gods Word.

                  §. 103. Of childrens honour by pious parents.
                  V. §. 98.
                     IT is an honour to children to deſcend from pious parents. This is true in relation to ancient progenitors. For it was a greater honour to the Iewes in all ſucceeding ages, that they deſcended from the pious Patriarchs. But the nearer ſuch parents are, the more honourable it is to children. Moſt of all honourable, when their immediate parents, from whoſe loines, and out of whoſe wombe they proceed, are pious. Of ſuch an one the Prophet here ſpeaketh, I am the ſonne of thine hand-maid. For queſtionleſſe he here calleth his mother Gods hand-maid, as hee called himſelfe Gods ſervant: in a ſpirituall reſpect, in regard of Gods grace to her, and in her. Such were Salomons parents, of whom, for honour ſake, he maketh Prov 4 3.—31. 1. 1 King 8. 17.frequent mention.

                        Direction, for parents how to leave an honourable memoriall.
                      Such was as Lois the grandmother, ſo Eunice the mother of Timothy.
                  
                  Nothing in truth can make any more honourable then piety. Whatſoever mens outward condition bee in this world, though never ſo meane, yet if they excell in vertue, they are moſt honourable in Gods eye. What man before God more noble then Peter, who was but a poore fiſherman? What woman more illuſtrious then bleſſed Mary, who is ſet out to be a carpenters wife? Pious perſons for birth, are borne of God: For dignities they are Gods favourites, of Gods Court, the moſt honourable therein: they are the ſpouſe of his ſonne. For revenewes, the exchequer of Gods treaſures is alwayes open for them to have out of it his moſt precious jewels: yea they are the true heires of this world, and of the world to come.
                  1 Such parents as deſire that their children ſhould all their daies make an honourable mention of them, let them here take notice of the onely right courſe to have their deſire accompliſhed. Let them ſo walke before their children, as they may have ſure evidences that they are Gods ſervants: that when children make mention of their

father before the Lord, they may have cauſe to ſay of him as Salomon did of his father, 1 King. 8. 25.
                     Thy ſervant my father: and of their mother, Pſal. 86. 16.
                     Thy hand-maid. For a child to ſtile himſelfe the ſonne of a Duke and Dutches, Earle and Counteſſe, Lord and Lady, or any other like, is not in truth ſuch an honour as this, Sonne of Gods ſervant and hand-maid. By this, poore, meane, deſpiſed parents in this world may make their children honourable: and may make their owne names honourable to their children. Direction to children in what parents to glory.
                  
                  2 Such children as would have juſt cauſe not vaine-gloriouſly to bragge, but divinely to glory in their parents, let them here know what kind of parents doe give that juſt cauſe. If indeed their father be Gods ſervant, and their mother Gods hand-maid, let them not be aſhamed of them, becauſe they be poore, of meane condition, not eſteemed in this world, but heartily thanke God that they are borne of ſuch parents as may give them occaſion to ſay, I am the child of Gods ſervant, and of Gods hand-maid. It is an hard taske to perſwade moſt children hereunto. But they that know God, and the dignities and immunities of his ſervants, will without all queſtion yeeld to the truth and equity hereof.

                  Thou haſt looſed my bonds.
                  THe §. 2.fourth reaſon which ſtirred up the Prophet to give publike thanks to God, was the kindneſſe which God had done to him. That kindneſſe was a gracious deliverance from a grievous diſtreſſe, thus expreſſed.
                  
                     Thou haſt looſed my bonds. The argument may bee thus framed.
                  They whoſe bonds thou O Lord haſt looſed, are bound to praiſe thee.
                  But Thou haſt looſed my bonds.
                  
                     
Therefore I am bound to praiſe thee.
                  Thus theſe words have a relation to the principall duty promiſed in this Pſalme.
                  They may alſo have an immediate reference to the other part of this verſe, and that as an effect following from the cauſe. The Lord accounted him his ſervant, and therefore looſed his bonds. To make this reference the better diſcerned, ſome joyne this part of the verſe with the former in one entire ſentence, which they expreſſe in forme of a petition thus, Obſccro, Ieho va, cum ego ſim▪ſervus tuus, ſimſervus tuus, filius ancilla tua, ſolveris vincula mea. Tremel. &amp; Iun.

And that mention is here made thereof as of the cauſe of praiſing God. For, if the queſtion ſhould be asked, why mention is here made of looſing his bonds, The 17. verſe giveth a ready anſwer, I will offer, &amp;c. As if it had beene more fully expreſſed, Becauſe the Lord hath looſed my bonds, therefore I will offer a ſacrifice of praiſe.
                  Wherefore to take the words as our Engliſh hath truly and properly tranſlated them, thus, Thou haſt looſed my bonds,

                     I looſe thee from the chaines, &amp;c. this word is uſed. In this ſenſe is it here uſed. Afflictions and calamities are as bonds, cords, and chaines, which faſt tie and bind men, which girt and gall, pinch and paine them, yea and oft ſtrangle and kill them: and in theſe reſpects called bonds, as in this and Pſal. 107. 14. Eccl 7. 26. Iſa. 28▪ 22.—52. 2. Ier. 2. 20.—30. 8▪ Nah. 1. 13.many other places, where the very word, that is here, is uſed in the ſame ſenſe. Yea becauſe death holdeth men downe, as faſt bound, ſo as they cannot ſtirre, it is ſaid to have cords (as was before noted on verſ. 3. §. 15.) and when one is delivered from death▪ the grave is ſaid, in the word of this text, to be Ezek. 37. 13.
                     looſed, or opened.
                  This phraſe then (thou haſt looſed my bonds) is metaphoricall. It implieth two things.
                  1 That he was in ſore and grievous afflictions, wherewith he was as it were bound, as a man that is taken by robbers and pirates, or by enemies, and faſt bound by ropes, chaines, or other like bonds. Thus Ier. 40. 1.
                     Ieremiah among other Iewes that were taken captives by the Babylonians, was bound.
                  
                  2 That the Lord delivered him from thoſe afflictions, which deliverance was a kind of looſing thoſe bonds, ſo as they continued not to binde him as before. Thus Nebuzaraden ſaid to Ieremiah, 
                     —4▪
                     
                     I looſe thee this day from the chaines which were upon thine hand.
                  
                  The occaſion of mentioning this deliverance, is to convince his ſoule of the equity of that which hee was now in doing, to praiſe the Lord.
                  
                     Summe. 
                     Thus we have A profeſſion of a great deliverance.
                  This may be conſidered two waies.
                  1 Simply, in and by it ſelfe.
                  2 Relatively, in and with reference to the occaſion thereof.
                  In the former conſideration, One thing is implied. Another expreſſed.
                  
                  
                     
1 The thing implied is, that he was in great diſtreſſe. The mention of bonds, together with the looſing of them, importeth, that bonds were on him: he was bound with them.
                  2 The thing expreſſed pointeth at
                  1 The Author, or Deliverer, Thou.
                  
                  2 The Kind of deliverance, hast looſed.
                  
                  The Reference hereof is partly immediate to the very next words, partly remote to the words further off.
                  The immediate reference ſets it downe as an effect of that relation which was betwixt God and him. He was Gods ſervant, therefore God looſed his bonds.
                  The remote reference expreſſeth it as a cauſe of his praiſing God. God looſed his bonds, therefore he would praiſe God.
                  So alſo doth the immediate inference of the 17 verſe: Becauſe thou, O Lord, haſt looſed my bonds, I will offer praiſe to thee.

                     I will deliver thee and thou ſhalt glorifie me: ſo as if any juſt occaſion can be given for performing this duty, this is eſpecially a moſt juſt occaſion. Yea this being the end why God delivereth thee, it lieth on thee as a debt, a moſt due debt which thou art to pay. The Pſalmiſt therefore where he ſpeaketh of praiſing God, gives this reaſon thereof, Thou hast delivered my ſoule from death, Pſal. 56. 12, 13.
                  2 Diſtreſſe makes men to call upon God. If upon deliverance from diſtreſſe they are not carefull to praiſe God, they ſhew that they performe duties of piety for their own advantage: and give juſt cauſe to ſuſpect, that if it were not to reape benefit to themſelves thereby, they would performe no duty at all to God.
                  
                     Exhortation to all that are looſed to be free in praiſing God. To ſatisfie Gods expectation, and to teſtifie that reſpect you owe▪ him, and bear to him, O ye Kingdomes and nations that have had thoſe bonds looſed, whereby you have beene bound by your enemies, render that unto the Lord which is moſt due, ſolemne, hearty thankes and praiſe. Doe ſo ye countries and people that have beene bound and pinched

with the bonds of dearth and famine. And ye O cities and ſocieties that have had the deadly bonds of the plague, and other contagious ſickneſſes (wherewith multitudes lie ſtill bound) looſed. Ye alſo that have beene in priſon, but are now looſed, praiſe the Lord. Ye that have gone forth againſt your enemies, and having beene compaſſed about by them before and behind (as Abijah and his armies were) are looſed 2 Chro. 13. 13.and freed, be forward to performe your bounden duty, praiſe the Lord. Praiſe the Lord ye that goe downe to the ſea in ſhips, and have there beene bound with vehement and violent ſtormes, and in great hazard of death, but are looſed: Eſpecially if ye have beene taken by pyrates, made bondſlaves, bound to gallies, or bound in dungeons, and are looſed. Yea and ye principall debters, or ſureties, that have been faſt bound to hard and cruell creditors, whereby your whole eſtate hath beene in hazard, and you have feared your owne, your wives, and childrens utter undoing, but are looſed from thoſe bonds, offer to the Lord your ſacrifice of thankſgiving. And ye O women who have beene bound with the ſtrait and painefull bonds of travell, which are looſed, and whereof you are eaſed. All ye alſo that have beene hard girt with the bonds of the ſtone, the ſtrangurie, the goute, the cholick, or any other painefull malady: or have beene faſt tied to your beds with the cords of any ſickneſſe, and are looſed, give thanks unto the Lord.

                     ſo know the end why ye ought to ſay it, namely to convince your ſoules of the equity of giving thankes to God, and to provoke them to doe it the more readily and cheerefully. When you are about to render ſolemne praiſe to God, doe as this Prophet did, thinke of your bonds which God hath looſed. Meditation thereon will much enſlame▪ your holy zeale of praiſing God. When the thought of your bonds which God hath looſed commeth to your mind, then withall enquire (as Ahaſhueroſh did when he heard of the kindneſſe done to him by Mordecai) what hath beene rendred

unto the Lord, what is to be rendred to him. This will make thee with ſuch a mind as the Prophet did, uſe theſe words to the Lord, Thou haſt looſed my bond. I will offer to thee a ſacrifice of thankeſgiving.

In the Courts of the LORDS houſe, in the middest of thee, O Ieruſalem. Praiſe ye the LORD.
                  IN theſe three laſt verſes of this Pſalme the Prophet returneth to his profeſſion of rendring praiſe unto the Lord: wherein ſome things, that were before ſet downe, are repeated: and other things are added thereto. For the better diſcerning whereof take notice of two maine points expreſſed therein.
                  1 A Proteſtation to praiſe the Lord himſelfe.
                  2 A Provocation to others, ſo to doe.
                  In his Protestation we have,
                  1 The Matter thereof.
                  2 The Motive thereto.
                  The Matter conſiſteth of two duties.
                  
                     1 Giving thanks to God. I will offer to thee the ſacrifice of thankeſgiving.
                  
                     2 Calling upon God. And will call upon the name of the LORD.
                  The motive is taken from his vow: where we have to conſider
                  
                     
                     1 The generall Matter thereof, I will pay my vowes unto the LORD.
                  2 The particular Manner of performing it.
                  The Manner is ſet out by two circumſtances.
                  1 The Time. Now.
                  
                  2 The Place; which is largely deſcribed, and that
                  
                     1 Indefinitely. In the preſence of his people.
                  2 Determinately, by a deſcription of the place where Gods people met. This is here deſcribed
                  
                     1 By the Relation it had to God, In the courts of the Lords houſe.
                  
                     2 By the Scituation of it. In the middest of thee O Ieruſalem.
                  The Provocation to others, is in the very laſt clauſe of all, thus expreſſed, Praiſe ye the LORD.
                  
                  The firſt duty in the Protestation was before ſet downe, verſe 13. I will take the cup of ſalvation. Here it is in other words repeated, thus, I will offer to thee the ſacrifice of thanksgiving.
                  
                  The ſecond duty is here repeated in the very ſame words wherein it was expreſſed before verſe 13. thus, And I will call upon the name of the Lord.
                  
                  The Matter of the motive, and the amplification thereof by the Time, and by the place, as it is indefinitely ſet downe, are all, word for word, repeated in this 18th verſe, as they were before expreſſed in the 14th verſe, thus, I will pay my vowes unto the LORD, now in the preſence of all his people.
                  
                  The determinate deſcription of the place in the 19th verſ. by the relation it hath to God, and by the ſcituation of it, thus, In the courts of the LORDS houſe, in the middest of thee, O Ieruſalem, is for ſubſtance the ſame that was noted before, in the latter end of the 14th and 18th verſes.

                  Concerning theſe repetitions, we may not thinke that he which uſed them, uſed them in vaine. He was guided by that divine ſpirit which would not ſuffer the leaſt title to bee in vaine. By repetitions good doctrines are faſt fixed in

mens minds. Beſides other ends § 98.before noted for repeating of one and the ſame thing, whether in the ſame, or in Repetitions import deepe affection.differing words and phraſes, this is a principall one, to teſtifie, and expreſſe the more lively, how deeply the ſoule is affected with ſuch and ſuch a thing. Fit and not affected repetitions are cleare expreſſions of deepe affections: yea they are alſo forcible incitations to incenſe holy paſſion in him that uſeth them, and in them that heare or read them ſo uſed. Theſe are the ends why Rhetoricians have invented figures of all manner of repetitions, as,

                     A deepe and due apprehenſion of Gods mercies makes a ſoule unſatisfied in ſetting forth Gods praiſes. The divine hymnes that were penned by ſuch as did indeed deepely ponder on Gods mercies, are evident demonſtrations thereof.

                  Gods mercies, the more they are pondered, are the more admired: eſpecially when the greatneſſe, freeneſſe, ſeaſonableneſſe of them, and other like circumſtances, together with our unworthineſſe, and therewithall the need that wee have thereof, the ſweetneſſe that we taſte, and benefit that we reape thereby, are duely and deeply weighed. They are like a bottomleſſe ſea, which, the farther it is ſounded, the deeper it appeares to be: or like to the bright Sun, which, the more it is gazed upon, the more it dazleth the eye. Yea further, Gods mercies are ſo linked together, as when we have occaſion to meditate on one, many of them inſtantly preſent themſelves to the view of our mind: as he that in a cleare night lifteth up his eyes to ſee one ſtarre, hath millions on a ſudden in his ſight: or as he that in the banke of a deepe river maketh a gut for a little water to paſſe thorow, maketh way for a floud to follow after.

                     ſacrifice of thanksgiving, or ſacrifice of praiſe. The ſignification of the Hebrew word, is the rather to be obſerved, becauſe it doth excellently ſet out the nature of thanksgiving, or praiſe, as it hath reference to God, which is, See The Guide to go to God, on the concluſion of the Lords Prayer. §. 239.to confeſſe and acknowledge God to be what he is, to do what he doth, and to give what he giveth. To offer a ſacrifice at ſuch a confeſſion, or thankſgiving, added much to the ſolemnity thereof: and made it more honourable in it ſelfe, and more acceptable to God: which that we may ſomewhat the more diſtinctly diſcerne, let us take a briefe view of the ſeverall ſacrifices

which were appointed by the law to be offered.
               
               
                  §. 111. Of the ſeverall ſacrifices of the Law.
                  
                     What a ſacrifice is. A Sacrifice (as the word is uſually taken in the Law) was A pious rite whereby ſomething was offered to God. I terme it, a rite, becauſe it was one of thoſe externall ceremonies which God ordained to be uſed in his Church till the fulneſſe of time ſhould come. I adde this attribute, pious, unto it, to ſhew that it was an action of piety, a part of divine worſhip. In every ſacrifice ſomething either with, or without life, was brought, and by the Prieſt, in the name of him that brought it, offered to the Lord. Herein lieth a maine difference betwixt this, and other rites, and in ſpeciall betwixt a ſacrifice and a ſacrament. The eſſentiall action of a Wherein a ſacrifice differeth from a ſacrament.ſacrament is a receiving from God; of a ſacrifice, an offering to God. They which entred into the arke, and abode therein, they which paſſed thorow the red ſea, and they which were under the cloud (1 Pet. 3 21. 1 Cor. 10 2.all which were ſacramentall rites, anſwerable to our ſacrament of Baptiſme) received thereby preſervation, protection, and direction from the Lord. So they which were circumciſed received the ſeale of remiſſion of ſinnes. They which celebrated the Paſſeouer received the ſcale of deliverance from bondage. They alſo which eate Manna, and dranke the water that flowed out of the rock (1 Cor. 10. 3, 4which anſwered to the Sacrament of the Lords Supper) apparently received both ſpirituall and temporall bleſſings from the Lord. But in all manner of ſacrifices ſomething was brought and offered to the Lord, as will more evidently appeare by a particular enumeration of the ſeverall ſacrifices: which may thus be diſtinguiſhed.
                  Two ends there were of ſacrifices.
                  
                     Ends of ſacrifices. One to pacifie the wrath of God provoked againſt man for his ſinne. On which ground David giveth this adviſe to Saul, 
                     1 Sam. 26. 19.
                     If the Lord have ſtirred thee up against me, let him ſmell an offering.
                  
                  Another to gratifie God for ſome favour received. Thus

                     2 Chro. 15. 11 
                     Aſa and his people having gotten victory over the Ethiopians, that came againſt him with an army of ten hundred thouſand, offered of the ſpoile to the Lord.
                  
                     Kinds of ſacrifices. According to theſe ends ſacrifices were,
                  1 Expiatory, for expiation of ſinne.
                  2 Gratulatory, for teſtification of thanks.
                  
                     Expiatory ſacrifices were expreſſe types of the ſacrifice of Chriſt, by which onely ſinne could be taken away. Vnder this head are compriſed Lev. 16. 6, &amp;c
                     Whole burnt offerings for attonement, —4. 3, &amp;c.ſeverall ſorts of ſacrifices for the ſinnes of ſeverall perſons, as of Prieſts, whole aſſemblies, Princes and private perſons, and all kinds of ſacrifices for —14 4, &amp;c.—15. 14, &amp;c.cleanſing ſuch as were legally uncleane, as lepers, thoſe that had running iſſues, or had touched a dead corps, or any uncleane thing, with the like.
                  
                     Gratulatory ſacrifices were viſible repreſentations of that Heb. 13. 15.praiſe, Rom. 12. 1.obedience, and Phil 4. 18. Heb. 13. 16.benevolence which all Gods people are bound unto. Of theſe there were two ſorts.
                  1 Such things as had life, and were ſlaine.
                  2 Such as had no life, and were offered to God.
                  Many peace-offerings, free-offerings, vow-offerings, and firſt-lings of living creatures, were ſlaine for gratulatory ſacrifices: and that to ſhew, that even in gratulation expiation muſt be made, and that by the bloud and ſacrifice of Chriſt all things are made acceptable to God. Lev 22. 21. 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

                     The word therefore that importeth, ſlaying, is attributed to gratulatory ſacrifices.
                  Their Lev. 2. 1, &amp;c.meat-offerings, and Exo. 29. 40.drink-offerings▪ many free-offerings and vow-offerings, firſt-fruits, tithes, and ſuch like, were of things without life. Theſe are uſually expreſſed by Lev. 2. 1.

                     a word that properly ſignifieth a gift, which we tranſlate offering, becauſe in way of gratitude they were given to the Lord, and offered up to him.
                  Gratulatory offerings were ordinary, or extraordinary.
                  
                     Ordinary were thoſe which were Exo. 29. 40, &amp;c.conſtantly offered every morning and evening, and at other times in their ſeaſons were brought as firſt-fruits, tithes, &amp;c.

For, they offered to God, not in regard of any need that God had, but as giving thankes for what hee gave: and as ſanctifying the creature.

                  3 The kind of ſacrifice whereby the Prophet would teſtifie his thankſgiving, was a duty of piety, an eſpeciall part of Gods worſhip, preſcribed by God, and of force in thoſe daies: from which particular wee may ſafely inferre this generall.
                  
                     I. True gratitude to God is to be teſtified by performing due worſhip to him.
                  4 This rite being ſuch an one as in and by it, that which God by his law required, was given to him, it giveth inſtance that▪

                  §. 121. Of teſtifying gratitude by piety.
                  I. TRue gratitude to God is to be testified by performing due worſhip to him. As this is implied under offering of ſacrifices, (whereby the Iewes were wont to teſtifie their gratefulneſſe when they had more then ordinary occaſion to do ſo) ſo is it in other places more plainely and expreſly ſet downe: as where the Pſalmiſt ſaith, Pſal. 5. 7.
                     I will come into thine houſe in the multitude of thy mercies, and in thy feare will I worſhip toward thy holy temple. 
                     —138. 1, 2.
                     I will ſing praiſe unto thee: I will worſhip toward thy holy temple, and praiſe thy name for thy loving kindneſſe. As he promiſeth for himſelfe, ſo he ſtirreth up others after the ſame manner to teſtifie their gratitude, ſaying, —29 2.—95. 2, 6.—96. 8, 9.
                     Give unto the Lord the glory due unto his name: worſhip the Lord. Where Iacob in his vow of thankſgiving uſeth this phraſe, Gen. 28. 22. Locus dignus qui conſecratur precibus ſundendis Deo. Trem. &amp; Iun in Scholijs

                  1 A maine end of praiſing is to glorifie God. For, ſaith the Lord himſelfe, Who ſo offereth praiſe, glorifieth me, (Pſal. 50 23.) But there is nothing wherein and whereby we may more glorifie God then by worſhipping him. Witneſſe the practice, not onely of them who on earth are inſtructed by the ſpirit of illumination in the good acceptable, and perfect will of God, but alſo of them in heaven, who are made perfect in all knowledge and underſtanding thereof.

that the King might greatly delight in her, hath this advice given to her, Worſhip thou him, Pſal. 45. 11.
                  3 By workes of piety all other actions of rejoycing are ſeaſoned, and ſanctified. This moved the pious Iewes to begin their weighty affaires with ſacrifices, (which were then, as we have heard, principall parts of piety, and of divine worſhip) and therewith to end the ſame, compare 1 Sam. 10. 8. with 1 Chro. 16. 1.
                  
                     
                        Continuam gratiarum actionem Domino exhibete. Hoc maximum eſt ſacrificium: haec oblatio perfecta. Hoc ſi ducia nobis fiet occaſio: Chryſ. Hom. 72. ad Pop.

                        Learne wherin Gods worſhip conſiſteth.
                      4 By giving thanks in and by ſuch duties as are preſcribed for Gods worſhip, we ſhew that our hearts are ſet on God, and prepared to doe ſervice to him, who hath done kindneſſe to us. Yea the duties wherein ſervice is done to God will raiſe our minds unto God, and fix them the more ſtedfaſtly on him. So as this kind of ſacrifice is queſtionleſſe the beſt and greateſt that we can offer up: a perfect oblation in the kind of it. And this will prove an occaſion of much confidence to us.
                  As occaſions of thankfulneſſe are offered unto us, and as by Gods Spirit we are moved to take thoſe occaſions for giuing thanks, let us here learne how to order, how to ſanctifie, how to make the ſame acceptable to God. Though the particular ceremony of worſhipping God by ſacrifices be now abrogated, yet the generall equity of performing due worſhip to God, doth ſtill, and ever ſhall remaine in force. Take notice therefore of that manner of worſhipping God which now under the Goſpell is warrantable. The parts of divine worſhip are prayer, ſinging of Pſalmes, reading, preaching, hearing the Word, and celebrating the Sacraments. Theſe are as ſacrifices of bullocks and calves, goats and kids, ſheepe and lambs, turtles, pigeons, ſpartowes: and all manner of meat and drink-offerings. By a pious, devout, reverend, 
                        Hoc eſt ſacrificiùm acceptabile: hoc eſt holocaustum pingue, us laudetur Deus, &amp;c Hier.

When theſe holy duties of piety are performed for gratitude ſake, when in, with, and by them thanks is given to God, then are they for ſubſtance in a ſpirituall reſpect ſacrifices of thanksgiving: and the Lord will accept them as ſacrifices of thanksgiving.

                     The zeale of Iewes in giving to God.
                     What is warrantable must be given to God. The pious Iewes manifeſted herein much zeale to the Lord. When the Tabernacle was firſt to be made, the people were ſo free-hearted and bountifull in bringing rammes skins, badgers skins, Shittim wood, oile, ſpices, ſweet incenſe, fine linnen, blue, purple and ſcarlet, braſſe, ſilver, gold, and all manner of precious ſtones, as they brought Ezo. 36. 5, 6.
                     more then enough: a proclamation was made to restraine them. Wonderfull great and precious were the treaſures which 1 Chro. 29. 1, &amp;c.
                     David and his Princes prepared for the Lord towards the building of his houſe. At that time —21.
                     they offered burnt offerings to the Lord, a thouſand bullocks, a thouſand rammes, and a thouſand ſheepe, with their drink-offerings and ſacrifices in abundance.

                     Salomon went beyond all theſe, and offered a ſacrifice of two and twenty thouſand oxen, and an hundred and twenty thouſand ſheepe. Behold here what teſtimonies of gratitude were given to the Lord.

                  But as externall evidences of true piety, as types of Heavenly Truths, as parts of that outward worſhippe and ſervice which God preſcribed, as viſible demonſtrations of gratitude, hee was well pleaſed with theſe ſacrifices: they cauſed a ſweet ſavour to enter

                      into his noſtrills, Geneſ. 8. 21. Exod. 29. 18. Levit. 1. 9.
                  Though God the Creator of all things ſtand in need of nothing that the creature hath, or can offer to him, yet by giving to him the things which in his Word we find to be acceptable to him, we manifeſt a willing and ready mind to do what lieth in our power: and give evidence that if any thing which we had, could ſtand the Lord in any ſtead, or do him any good, we would with all our hearts gratifie him therewith: which mind God doth as kindly and graciouſly accept, as if indeed he were profited by that which we offer unto him.
                  Be liberall and bountifull to the Lord, whoſoever ye be that have any thing to give to the Lord. And who is it that hath not ſomething, yea that hath not much to give, if hee be no niggard of what he hath? The pooreſt that be, have as many calves, as Salomon had, to offer to the Lord: calves of their lips, (Hoſ. 14. 2.) Theſe are ſacrifices which may bee offered up to God, (Heb. 13. 15.) The pooreſt that be, have a body, which they may preſent

as a living ſacrifice holy and acceptable to God, (Rom. 12. 1.) The pooreſt that be may every day morning and evening and at other times alſo direct their prayer to God as incenſe, (Pſal. 141. 2.) Yea they may mixe therewith the ſweeteſt incenſe of the interceſſion of Chriſt, and offer all up upon the golden altar which is before the throne, (Rev. 8. 3.) The pooreſt that be may bring to God a broken heart and a contrite ſpirit, which is a ſacrifice that God will not deſpiſe, (Pſal. 51. 17.) The pooreſt that be may do justly, love mercy, and walk humbly before God, which the Lord preferreth before burnt offerings, and calves of a yeare old: yea before thouſands of rammes, or ten thouſand rivers of oile, (Mic. 6. 8.) Theſe and other like offerings have all of all ſorts (not the pooreſt excepted) now under the Goſpell to bring and give unto the

All good workes are ſacrifices fit for God, and acceptable to him. There are alſo ſeverall talents given to ſeverall perſons, though not to all alike, (for to one are given five, to another two, to another but one) yet to him that hath the leaſt ſo much is given, as by a good improvement thereof, hee may bring ſome increaſe and advantage to the Lord, and that ſo acceptably, as the Lord thereby wilbe moved to ſay, Well done thou good and faithfull ſervant, thou haſt been faithfull over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things, &amp;c. (Mat. 25. 21.) As for rich men, they may yet further honour God with their ſubſtance, (Prov. 3. 9.) They may do good and diſtribute: for with ſuch ſacrifices God is well pleaſed, (Heb. 13. 16.) They may ſo communicate to the neceſſities, not onely of the pooreſt Saints, but alſo of the Miniſters of Gods Word, as what they doe in this kind may be an odour of a ſweet ſmell, a ſacrifice acceptable and well pleaſing to God. (Phil. 4. 18.) Thus as there were ſacrifices of old, there are ſacrifices ſtill: as oblations of old, ſo oblations ſtill. Onely the kind of them is altered.
                  Theſe ſacrifices allowed, approved, accepted under the

Goſpell, Pſal. 69. 31.
                     Pleaſe the Lord much better then oxen and bullocks that have hornes and hoofes: yet to us are they nothing ſo chargeable, as the oblations, and ſacrifices were to the Iewes. Why then do we returne ſo little to the Lord? Are his mercies fewer in number, or leſſe in worth to us under the Goſpell, then they were to his people under the Law? If the difference betwixt the old and new covenant, betwixt Gods dealing with his Church before, and ſince Chriſt was exhibited, were thorowly diſcerned, we ſhould find juſt cauſe to ſay, He hath not dealt ſo with the Iewes, as he hath dealt with Chriſtians. We want thoſe zealous affections which the pious Iewes had. Were our inward diſpoſition anſwerable to theirs, we would not, we could not come ſo ſhort as we do of outward expreſſions of gratefulneſſe. Let us by due meditation of Gods ſurpaſſing kindneſſe to us, be ſtirred up willingly and chearefully to give what we

                  §. 114. Of vowing praiſe to God.
                  PSAL. CXVI. XVIII.
                  I will pay my vowes unto the LORD, now in the preſence of all his people.
                  THe immediate inference of this verſe upon the former, ſheweth the principall matter of the Prophets vow. For he maketh mention of his vow, as of a motive, the more See Verſ. 14. §. 89.to provoke him to offer up a ſacrifice of thankſgiving. But if he had not vowed ſuch a ſacrifice, what motive could his vow have beene thereto? This approved patterne of the Prophet giveth evidence, that,

                        Praiſe to God is a meet matter to be vowed.
                     
                  
                  Where mention is made of performing vowes, expreſſe mention uſeth there to be of this very matter, and that

where directions are given for vowes, thus, Pſal. 50. 14.
                     Offer unto God thanksgiving, and pay thy vowes: and where performance is promiſed, thus, —22. 25.
                     My praiſe ſhalbe of thee, I will pay my vowes.

                     I will ſing praiſe to thy name for ever, that I may daily performe my vowes, The praiſes which he ſang to the Lord tending to this end, that hee might performe his vow, evidently prove that he had vowed ſo to doe. Where Iacob vowed that Gen. 28. 22.the ſtone which he ſet for a pillar, ſhould be Gods houſe, what intended he thereby, but that publike and ſolemne praiſe ſhould be given to God? This was the maine ſubſtance of Iudg. 11. 31.
                     Iepthahs vow, that in way of thanks he would give ſomething to the Lord. If his vow had not too farre extended it ſelfe, even to ſuch things as might not bee offered to the Lord, it had beene a warrantable and commendable vow.
                  
                     One end of a vow to give evidence of mans reſpect to God. 1 A vow rightly made is of ſomething to be done for the Lords ſake, and to teſtifie our reſpect to him. If a vow be made againſt any ſinne, or againſt temptations or occaſions that lead thereto, it is becauſe by ſinne God is offended and diſhonoured. Now to vow againſt that whereby God is offended and diſhonoured, is implicitly to pleaſe and to honour God. If a vow be made for performing any duty, that is made ſomewhat the more directly to the honour and praiſe of God: for, all good duties tend thereunto. Now, becauſe there is nothing wherein and whereby we can more honour God, or better teſtifie our reſpect to God, then by giving praiſe to him, to praiſe God muſt needs be a very fit ſubject for a vow: yea the beſt that can be.
                  
                     Another end of a vow is gratitude. 2 In making a vow ſomething is aimed at, either as received, or as expected from the Lord, which occaſioneth the making thereof. When in diſtreſſe a vow is made, it is in expectation of deliverance from that diſtreſſe. When to avoid ſinne, a vow is made, it is to gaine aſſurance of pardon for that ſinne before committed, and aſſiſtance againſt it for the time to come. Though in theſe and other like caſes a vow be made before the kindneſſe, for which it is made, be

received, yet it is to binde us unto gratitude for the kindneſſe which wee deſire and expect. If after a kindneſſe conferred a vow bee made, then it is an apparent teſtimony of gratefulneſſe. But what duty more proper to gratitude then praiſe of God? Wherefore, to praiſe God is a matter moſt meet to be vowed.
                  
                     A third end of a vow to tie us more firmly to that whereunto we are otherwiſe bound. 3 Thoſe duties whereunto we are moſt bound, from performance whereof, no ſuperiour power on earth may hinder us, which by the gift of grace, that God uſeth to give to his children, wee are able to doe, wee ought eſpecially to vow. But in the uppermoſt rancke of all ſuch duties, praiſing of God, is moſt juſtly to bee placed. So as, if any bee meet to bee vowed, this is of all moſt meet.
                  
                     A vow of praiſe in prayer quickeneth it. 4 A vow muſt alwayes bee joyned with prayer. Commonly when men earneſtly deſire the removall of ſome evill, or the obtaining of ſome good thing, in opening their deſire to God, they will vow ſomething to him. At leaſt when a vow is made, prayer muſt then be made for grace to keepe it. Now when in making any petition to God, the mind is fixed on rendering ſomething to God, and is thereby brought to vow praiſe unto him, this vowing of praiſe will much enlarge the deſire of a mans heart, and ſettle his ſoule in aſſurance of obtaining what hee deſireth.
                  A vow of praiſing God in craving any bleſſing from God, is like to this proteſtation, As wee forgive them that treſpaſſe 
                     
                        Exhortation to vow praiſe in praying for any ſpeciall bleſſing.
                        Quid voveatis, quid reddatis? An forte anima lia illa quae

                     againſt us, annexed to the fift petition, whereby we are ſtirred up more earneſtly to crave, and more ſtedfaſtly to believe, pardon of our ſinnes. The thought of praiſing God, eſpecially when it is ratified by a vow, workes much confidence in Gods favour towards him, that is in truth reſolved to performe that vow. Is not this then a very meet matter to be vowed?
                  Do ye now enquire, what ye may vow, what ye may render? Whether ſuch creatures as were ſometimes offered on altars? Thou needeſt offer no ſuch thing. There is in

thee what thou maiſt vow and render. From the arke of thy heart bring forth the incenſe of praiſe. Now therefore yee who are well informed in the lawfulneſſe, meetneſſe, excellency and utility of this duty of making vowes to God, (whereof before) and are thereupon moved to put the duty in practice, here take notice of this maine matter of a vow, and be forward in vowing praiſe to God. When for themſelves men crave in ſickneſſe, recovery of health; in penury, ſupply of their neceſſities; in reſtraint, liberty; in ſterility, children; in oppreſſion, protection; in their labours, ſucceſſe; in any danger, ſafety; or in any other caſe, any needfull bleſſing; yea when they pray in the behalfe of others, whether for the Church in generall, or ſuch parts thereof as are in diſtreſſe, or for their owne nation, citie, towne, pariſh, family, children, or any others: when they pray for any more then ordinary bleſſing, and favour from the Lord, let them in making that prayer vow to render praiſe unto the Lord: that when the Lord giveth any evidence of hearing their prayer, they may ſay, I will praiſe thee, O Lord, that I may performe my vow.

                     What Gods houſe is. The place in relation to God is ſtiled the LORDS houſe. This title is in Scripture uſed to expreſſe a ſelect place, or an elect people.
                  As it hath reference to a place, it is taken indefinitely or determinately.
                  
                  1 In an indefinite acception any place where God is pleaſed to afford an eſpeciall repreſentation of his preſence, may be named Gods houſe. Thus Gen. 28. 17.that place where Iacob in his journey lay and ſlept, is called The houſe of God, becauſe of that divine viſion wherein the Lord there appeared to him. The reaſon of this name given to that place, is expreſly rendred in theſe words, —16.
                     Surely the LORD is in this place. On a like ground the places where the Lord appeared to Exo. 3. 5.
                     Moſes, and to Ioſ. 5. 15.
                     Ioſhua, are called holy ground.
                  
                  
                     Determinately, this title, Gods houſe, is attributed to places on earth, or in heaven.
                  
                     On earth it was given to two places, the Iudg 18.

In this communion, 1 Cor. 1. 2. 1 Pet. 1. 2.all that profeſſe the true Chriſtian Religion, and ſubject themſelves to the ordinances thereof, are, in the judgement of charity, reputed.

                     it ſelfe, ſo alſo every particular member is counted and called Gods houſe. Thus is this phraſe taken where the Apoſtle, in relation to the Lord, ſaith, Whoſe houſe we are, (Heb. 3. 6.) and againe, Ye are the temple of the living God, as God hath ſaid, I will dwell in them, (2 Cor. 6. 16.) So as every one may account himſelfe to be a ſpirituall houſe of God, ſo he walk not in the fleſh, but in the ſpirit.
                  Concerning the particular houſe of God, which is here in this Pſalme mentioned, it can hardly be determined for certen which it ſhould bee, becauſe the Author, and Time of penning this Pſalme are not expreſſed. If the Pſalme were penned by any Prophet after Davids time, then queſtionleſſe he meaneth the Temple. If David (as it is moſt probable) were the penman of it, then can it not be meant of the Temple, which was not then built: but rather of the Tabernacle.
                  
                  But hence ariſeth another doubt. In Davids time there were two ſacred Tabernacles.

                     1 Chro. 15. 1.—16. 1. 2 Sam. 6. 17.The other made by David for the Ark of God.

                  They were in ſeverall places. Ioſ. 18 25.—21. 17.
                     Gibeon was one of the

cities of Benjamin allotted to the Prieſts. There was the Tabernacle. But the Arke was in the city of David, which was

                  The title, houſe of God, and the courts applied to that houſe, give ſome evidence, that he meaneth the Tabernacle made by Moſes. For Iudg. 19. 18. 2 Sam 12. 20.that is uſually ſtiled the houſe of God, the Numb. 17 13—19. 13. Ioſ 2

Beſides we read of a Exo. 27. 9, &amp;c Lev. 6. 26.ſpatious court appertaining to the Tabernacle made by Moſes. For, that Tabernacle (as afterwards the Temple after the patterne thereof) was divided into three parts.

                     the great court. 
                     Lev. 17. 5.Hither they brought their ſacrifices; here they ſtood and beheld the Prieſts offering them: for Exo. 40. 6.the great altar whereon the ordinary ſacrifices were offered ſtood at the partition betwixt this court and the holy place. Hence was it, that the people are ſaid to Pſal 26. 6.

                     lay hold on the hornes of the altar. But we read not of any ſuch courts appertaining to the Tabernacle which David made. Yea after David had made a Tabernacle for the Arke, 
                     1 Chro. 16. 40 2 Chro. 1. 3.the moſt ſolemne aſſemblies were notwithſtanding at the other Tabernacle. It is therefore moſt probable, that by the Courts of the Lords houſe he here meaneth that publike and ſolemne place of aſſembling at the Tabernacle of the Lord.
                  
                  
                     Object. That Tabernacle was in Davids time 1 Chro. 16. 39 2 Chro. 1. 3.at Gibeon, how can that ſtand with the ſcituation of the place here mentioned, In the middest of Ieruſalem.
                  
                  
                     Anſw. It is not neceſſary that both thoſe clauſes be applied to one and the ſame place. But as he mentioneth two

duties, ſo he noteth two places fit for each duty. The firſt duty is to offer ſacrifice of thanksgiving. This was moſt fit to be done in the Tabernacle at Gibeon, which was the court of the Lords houſe. The other was to call upon the name of the Lord. This was moſt fit to be done before the Arke which was in the Tabernacle that David had made for it, 1 Chr. 15. 29in his owne city, even in the middeſt of Ieruſalem.
                  
                  
                     Ieruſalem was the moſt famous city that ever appertained to the Iewes. It was the place where Melchizedek the firſt, moſt ancient, and beſt King that we read of after the floud, Of Ieruſalem.even that King, who by reaſon of his integrity was called Heb. 7. 2.

3 There are times of founding new Churches, and edifying ſetled Churches. Planters and Founders may have more liberty then ſuch as find Churches planted, and ſetled in good order.
                  4 There are places of perſecution where no liberty is granted for publike aſſemblies: and places of peace, where Churches have much reſt, and great liberty. In places of perſecution bounden duties muſt rather be performed in private, then omitted. For matter of circumſtance muſt give place to matters of ſubſtance: matters of conveniency to matters of neceſſity.
                  Wherefore to leave extraordinary perſons to their extraordinary warrant, we that live in well ſetled Churches, where thorow the diviue providence we have publike places for divine ſervices ſet apart, whereunto we have much liberty on all occaſions to reſort, ought to bee of his mind, who Pſal. 12

It was of old fore-told that this ſhould be the diſpoſition of Saints under the Goſpell in the kingdome of Chriſt: to ſay, Iſa. 2. 3.
                     Come ye, let us goe up to the mountaine of the Lord, &amp;c. Chriſt and his Apoſtles, though they had juſt cauſe and good warrant to performe many publike duties in private places, yet did they much frequent thoſe publike places, where publike duties were in their time performed. Of Chriſt it is expreſly recorded that, Luk 4. 16.
                     as his custome was, he went into the Synagogue on the Sabbath day. Of the Apoſtles alſo, and of them that continued in their doctrine and fellowſhip, it is ſaid, Act. 2. 46.
                     They continued daily with one accord in the Temple praiſing God. Herein lieth a maine difference betwixt ſuch, as like Chriſt, do all to edifying (Ioh. 18. 20.He ever taught in the Synagogue and in the Temple, whither the Iewes alwaies reſort) and ſuch as doe all for their owne ends, ſeeking to beguile others.

occaſions that are offered, to go into the courts of the Lords houſe, and performe duties of piety according to their kind, publike duties publikely, ſolemne duties ſolemnely. This is a good Chriſtian decorum, agreeable to that Apoſtolicall In medio credentium populorum laudabo t

Mat. 18. 20.the ſpeciall preſence of his grace and favour abideth in the places where he is truly and and duly worſhipped. Theſe places therefore are to him as Kings palaces and houſes: which moſt properly they account their owne. God provides for the places of his worſhip
                  
                  2 Gods greateſt care is over theſe places. He bringeth light into them by his word: he beautifieth them by his ordinances: he continually repaireth them, and keepeth them from ruine by holy diſcipline. In them are the treaſures of his graces. Orders, Offices, All needfull proviſion, The bread of life, The wine of ſpirituall conſolation and other like bleſſings of an houſe are there. There God dines and ſuppes with his people. All things fit for an houſe are there; which, whoſoever obſerveth, cannot but ſay of ſuch a place, it is the houſe of God.
                  
                  
                     
3 God is very jealous over ſuch places. He cannot endure to have them defiled, profaned. It was one cauſe of the 2 Chro 36▪ 14. Admiration at Gods houſes on earth. Pſal. 81. 1, &amp;c.Iewes captivity, that they polluted the houſe of the Lord.
                  
                  O how enamoured ſhould we be with ſuch places! If we be where we cannot come to them, nor joyne with Gods Saints in worſhipping the Lord, how ſhould it grieve us? No place in the world, were it every way as faire, as fertile, as pleaſant, as profitable in all earthly commodities, as Eden, or Paradiſe was, ſhould give us content, if Gods Quidni moxtium mons ubi tam m

                     houſe be not there: if no place be there for Saints to aſſemble together to worſhip God. In nothing is any part of the earth made more like to heaven, then in having Gods houſe ſcituate on it. The Prophet fore-told that the mountaine of the Lords houſe ſhould be eſtabliſhed in the top of the mountaines, and exalted above the hils. Why ſhould it not be accounted the hill of hils, where there is ſuch plenty of all delectable things: where there is ſuch a plenitude of plenty? It is an hill of peace, an hill of joy, and hill of life, an hill of glory. We count cities and townes that have Kings and Noblemens houſes in them, happy, by reaſon of the great proviſion, and all manner of commodities that are brought to them. Much more happy may we account thoſe cities and townes where are many houſes of God: if indeed they be true houſes of God. Externall buildings made with ſtone or bricke, timber, lead, iron, and other ſuch materialls, though never ſo pompous and glorious without and within, can not juſtly be accounted Gods houſes, if Gods people aſſemble not in them to worſhip God, if Gods ordinances be not there duly obſerved, if there be no prayers made to God, no Word of God preached, no Sacraments adminiſtred, no divine diſcipline exerciſed in them. But where theſe are, there are Gods houſes. And happy are the places where Gods houſes are.
                  
                     Exhortation to dwell where Gods houſe is. Ye that deſire to dwell in cities or townes, be ſure that Gods houſes be in thoſe cities or townes. What are beſt ordered companies without the communion of Saints? What the beſt merchandizes without ſuch as are brought

from the celeſtiall Canaan? What all ſort of wares without ſuch as the wiſdome of God ſetteth out?
                  And ye that deſire to have your houſes ſtand by themſelves in the open aire, bee ſure that an houſe of God be ſo neare them, as on all occaſions ye may reſort to them. What is the ſweeteſt aire without the breath of Gods Spirit? What the moſt fertile ſoile without the fruitfull word of God? What the cleareſt ſprings and brooks without the current of grace? What the beſt growne woods without Gods plants? What the moſt melodious ſinging of birds without Saints ſinging hymnes and ſpirituall ſongs, making melody to the Lord in their hearts? What all country or city commodities without divine ordinances? But in Gods houſes (rightly and juſtly ſo called) are all theſe to be had. There is a kind of fatneſſe of Gods houſe, that is a fulneſſe and ſweetneſſe, whereby all that duly frequent the ſame, ſhalbe ſatisfied. Be therefore, if poſſibly ye can, where Gods houſe Pſal. 36. 8. Pſal. 84. 4.is. Bleſſed are they that dwell there. The Pſalmiſt in a rhetoricall amplification of this point ſeemeth to envy the ſparrowes and ſwallowes which rooſted and built their neſts about —3▪
                     the houſe of God whereunto he could not come, though his ſoule longed and even fainted for it. —2:
                  
                  
                     Direction to ſuch as enjoy a free liberty of Gods houſe. Finally, ye that have that favour and honour to dwell where Gods houſe is, eſteeme it as a great favour and high honour: and teſtifie as much by your anſwerable cariage.
                  1 Frequent Gods houſe on all occaſions. The Chriſtians of the purer primitive times of the Church, continued daily 
                     Act. 2. 46.
                     with one accord in the Temple. This one thing did the Man Pſal. 27. 4.after Gods owne heart deſire, and profeſſeth more and more to ſeeke after it, even to dwell in the houſe of the Lord all the daies of his life: that is, as an inhabitant to have recourſe unto it on all occaſions. For, ſaith he to the Lord, I have 
                     Pſal. 26. 8.
                     loved the habitation of thy houſe, and the place where thine honour dwelleth.
                  
                  
                     Eccl. 5. 1. 2 Keepe thy foot when thou goest to the houſe of God: that is, keepe thine heart, which is to thy ſoule as thy foot to thy

body, to carie it this way and that way. Go therfore to Gods houſe with a well prepared heart. There is he preſent, who ſearcheth and trieth the heart.
                  3 At the very entring into Gods houſe, let an holy trembling and awfull feare poſſeſſe thy ſoule. The great God, the Gen 28. 16, 17King of glory is there. When Iacob by a divine viſion, which was ſhewed him in a place where he ſlept, perceived that the Lord was in that place, hee was afraid and ſaid, How dreadfull is this place? This is none other but the houſe of God.
                  
                  4 When thou art there, keepe thy thoughts from wandring. Let not thy ſoule be fixed on any other thing then on God, and his holy ordinances which thou performeſt, leaſt Iſa. 29 13thou be reckoned in the number of them, Who draw neare to God with their mouth, and with their lips do honour him, but have removed their heart farre from him: and ſo thy ſervice be rejected of God.
                  
                     Ioh. 2▪ 14, &amp;c 5 Prophane not Gods houſe with Merchandizes, for which Chriſts indignation was ſo incenſed againſt the Iewes in his time, as with a ſcourge he drave them out. Prophane it not with worldly communications, or actions: much leſſe with any impious or unrighteous words or deeds.
                  
                     6 Pervert not Gods houſe by making it a pretext for any impiety or iniquity. As if having Gods houſe by thee, thou ſhouldeſt thereby be juſtified, or bolſtered up againſt evill. 
                     Ier. 7. 9, 10.Will ye ſteale, commit adultery, ſweare falſly, and walke after other gods, and come ſtand before me in this houſe (ſaith the Lord) which is called by my name, and ſay, we are delivered to do all theſe abominations?

                     GOds praiſes muſt be boldly ſet forth. We may not be daunted, or aſhamed therein, as men which do things ſecretly in a corner, but by doing this duty in the middeſt of populous places, manifeſt holy boldneſſe, as he that ſaid, Pſal. 10

                     Before the Gods will I ſing praiſe unto thee. Thus Saint Paul, though as a malefactor he was brought before Act. 25. 23.King Agrippa and Bernice ſitting in great pompe, with Feſtus, the chiefe captaines, and principall men of the city, where were great multitudes of people, yet in declaring the admirable worke of God in his converſion, ſaith, —26. 26:
                     I ſpeake freely. Herein hath the Lord Chriſt made himſelfe a worthy patterne: for in this caſe thus he ſaith, Pſal. 22. 2

                     The things which make men aſhamed, of no moment 1 Such is the excellency, ſuch the neceſſity of praiſing God, ſo honourable, ſo acceptable unto God, ſo uſefull and beneficiall is it to us, by ſo many bonds are we bound thereunto, as if all the things in the world which can be pretended to make any aſhamed or afraid thereof, whether reputation, promotion, riches, friends, liberty, life, or any thing els, were put into one ballance, and the inducements to move us boldly to performe it, put into another, they would be found beyond all compariſon too light.
                  
                     Benefits of boldneſſe. 2 By Saints boldneſſe in praiſing God, as they who are like minded, are much affected and ſtirred up to bleſſe God, ſo the weake and faint-hearted are ſtrengthened and encouraged, and gaine-ſayers, ſcorners, and all ſorts of adverſaries daunted and put to ſilence.
                  
                     Reprehenſion of mens timorouſneſſe in praiſing God. Great cauſe of juſt complaint may hence be taken, not onely againſt impious and prophane perſons, who care not to give any praiſe at all to God, either in private corners, or in the middeſt of aſſemblies, but alſo againſt ſuch as in their

judgements are convinced of the equity of the duty, and in their conſciences perſwaded of the neceſſity thereof: and thereupon are moved inwardly in their hearts, or ſecretly in their cloſets, or other like places to praiſe the Lord: but to do it in aſſemblies, in the middeſt of populous places, they are aſhamed. What is this but to preferre man to God, and applauſe of men to Gods approbation? May it not be Mat. 6. 2.ſaid of ſuch, They have their reward? Surely their owne judgement and conſcience are terrible witneſſes againſt 
                        Mar. 8. 38. Si ante reges &amp; praeſides propter Dominum ſtemus, non conſuſi, ſed conſtantes eſſe debemus. Hier. Comment▪ in Pſal. 118. Exhortation to boldneſſe.
                     them. Fearefull is the doome which Chriſt hath denonnced againſt them; For, ſaith he, Whoſoever ſhalbe aſhamed of me, and of my words in this adulterous and ſinfull generation, of him alſo ſhall the fonne of man be aſhamed, when he commeth in the glory of his father with the holy Angels. If therefore we ſtand before Kings and Governours for the Lord, we ought not to be aſhamed, but reſolute and conſtant.
                  Be bold, be bold, ye ſervants of the Lord, in ſounding forth the praiſes of your God. Goe into preſſes of people: and in the middeſt of them praiſe the Lord. Wicked men are over-bold in belching forth their blaſphemies to the diſhonour of God: they care not who heare them. They ſticke not to do it in the middeſt of cities. Shall they be more audacious to diſhonour God, then ye zeelous to honour him? Mat. 10. 32.Aſſuredly Chriſt will ſhew himſelfe as forward to confeſſe you, as you are, or can be to confeſſe him. This holy boldneſſe is the ready way to glory. To adde an edge to this exhortation, well obſerve theſe few rules following.
                  
                     
                        Rules for boldneſſe in praiſing God.
                        Dan. 3. 16, 17.
                      1 Duly conſider the difference betwixt God and man. It is diſ-reſpect of God, and too much reſpect of man, that maketh many aſhamed and afraid to declare before men that duty which they owe to God.
                  2 Take an invincible reſolution to doe what you ſee juſt Acts 21. 13, 14cauſe to do. Want of a ſetled reſolution makes men when they meet with any diſcouragements, to turne back, and to ceaſe proſecuting that, which in their conceipt cauſeth feare and ſhame.
                  3 Paſſe not for praiſe or diſpraiſe of men: but 2 Cor. 6. 8.

Such companions will put life into you, and provoke you to doe as they doe. In them eſpecially are theſe proverbes verified, As iron ſharpeneth iron, ſo a man ſharpeneth tho countenance of his

                  IIII. §. 115:OƲr delight must be in Gods Church. It was uſuall with the Prophets familiarly with much delight to direct their ſpeeches to Ieruſalem, and to Zion as types of Gods Church, after this manner,

                      Not without cauſe therefore doth the Pſalmiſt ſtile the Church (Pſal. 26. 8.) The place where Gods honour dwelleth. He thought it not enough to ſay, The place where God dwelleth, but where his honour dwelleth, which maketh much to the glory of the Church.
                  Doe not theſe things make the Church worthy to bee

ſought after to be loved, to be delighted in? Many, many more are the prerogatives thereof which make it moſt amiable; but theſe may be ſufficient to ſuch as are not of a Stoicall diſpoſition, very blockes, ſenſible of no delightſome object.
                  The affection of our Prophet towards Ieruſalem, the Church of God, is even for imitation worthy of all due obſervation: that our hearts alſo may be ſo enamoured with her, as not to think or ſpeake of her, but with delight.
                  For this purpoſe two points ſhall briefly be declared.
                  1 How ſuch a delight may be wrought.
                  2 How it may be manifeſted.
                  To worke it,
                  
                     How delight in the Church may bee wrought. I Be well inſtructed in thoſe priviledges and prerogatives which make the Church worthy to be delighted in. Thus will thy delight be more ſolid and ſtable.
                  2 Oft meditate thereon, ſo will thy delight be the more inflamed: Serious meditation on that which works affection, is as bellowes to a fire, it enkindles it, and makes it flame out.
                  3 With-draw thy heart from other contrary objects which worke a corrupt delight therein. As the heart of him that is ſet on ſtrange women, will thereby be alienated from his wife: So delight in the world and the vanities thereof will dimme, yea cleane put out our delight in the Church.

                  PSAL. CXVI. XIX.
                  Praiſe ye the Lord.
                  THe Prophet having abundantly teſtified his owne readineſſe and forwardneſſe to praiſe the Lord; contenteth not himſelfe therewith, but that the more praiſe might redound to God, in the cloſe of his hymne he ſtirreth up others, even all of all ſorts without any limitation or exception of any to do the like, in this compound word,

                     Praiſe ye the Lord.
                  
                  Of the duty implied in this phraſe, which is to praiſe the Lord, ſufficient hath beene ſpoken before. It remaineth here to ſpeake of the meanes of ſpreading abroad and propagating the praiſe of God, by inciting others to praiſe him. This cohortation being added to his profeſſion, two uſefull obſervations hence ariſe.
                  
                     I. We muſt provoke others to praiſe God.
                  
                     II. We muſt our ſelves practice what we provoke others unto.
                  1 For the firſt, the duty of provoking others is in Scripture applied to all points of piety, juſtice, and charity. For, what we find behoofull for our ſelves to do, we muſt thereunto incite others. In generall therefore its ſaid, Hebr. 10. 24.

                     Edifie one another. But more particularly for inciting others to praiſe God, as other bookes of Scripture, ſo eſpecially the booke of Pſalmes doth abound with incitations thereto: ſtirring up Pſal. 148.—135. 19, &amp;c.—149▪—150.

                     on extraordinary occaſions, to incenſe the ſpirits mutually of one another to praiſe God. The celeſtiall ſpirits (though they be every one moſt forward to praiſe the Lord, and need no incitation, yet) to ſhew their earneſt and unſatiable deſire to have it continually done by all, they cry one to another, Hallelu-jah praiſe ye the Lord, Rev. 19. 
                        •
                     , 3, 4, 6. When we receive a good turne from man, we uſe to ſtirre up others, to thanke him in our behalfe. Much more ought we to invite and incite others to praiſe God with us and for us.
                  The zeale we ought to beare to Gods glory: The love we owe to our brethren; The comfort that we may reape to our owne ſoules, by provoking others to praiſe the Lord, are as a three-fold twiſted cord to hold us faſt to the performance of this duty.
                  1 The more perſons are brought to praiſe the Lord, the more is Gods name hallowed. Now it is an evidence of a great zeale of Gods glory, not onely with the uttermoſt of our owne power to praiſe him our ſelves, but alſo to be a meanes to draw on others ſo to do: as he that ſaid, I will 
                     Pſal. 45. 17.
                     make thy name to be remembred in all generations: therefore ſhall the people praiſe thee for ever and ever.
                  
                  2 It is an evidence of much love to our brethren to incite them to praiſe the Lord, both in regard of the great need wherin they ſtand therof, and alſo in regard of the great benefit they may reape therby. All have great need to be daily ſtirred up to this duty, by reaſon of their naturall backwardneſſe thereunto. The more excellent any duty is, the more backward we are by nature thereunto: but of all duties, none more excellent, none more divine, none wherein we come nearer unto the celeſtiall ſpirits, then this of praiſing God: which maketh our earthly, perverſe diſpoſition to be ſo dull to it, as it is, Can heavy things of the earth be forward to aſcend upward? but in praiſing God our ſpirits aſcend to heaven where God is. Hence alſo is it, that, though we are at ſome times quicke and forward thereunto, yet we

ſoone waxe dull therein, and as it were fall downward, as heavy weights, which though they be pulled up, by their owne heavineſſe fall downe againe: or as water, which though with fire it be heated, of its owne nature waxeth cold againe. Therefore as weights are oft to be pulled up, as fire is of
                        •
                      to be put under water, and blowne up, ſo our ſpirits are oft to be quickned and ſtirred up by mutuall cohortations. The benefit whereof is very great, by reaſon of the true vertue and efficacy of incitations. As ſouldiers, even freſh water ſouldiers, and all that ſtrive for maſteries by running, riding, rowing, ſhooting, wraſtling, &amp;c. are much animated and whetted on by acclamations, and incitations, ſo Chriſtians by holy exhortations are much quickened to praiſe the Lord.
                  
                     
                        Quid beatius nobis ſoret, ſi glo rificemus non ſolum linguis noſtris bonum Deum, ſed ſi proximos quoque ut noſtro nomine cum glorificent, incitemus.
                        Chryſ. Hom. 27. in Gen. 8.
                      3 We give evidence to others, and gaine aſſurance to our ſelves of the ſpirit of grace abiding and bearing rule in us, by drawing on others with us to praiſe the Lord. This ſpirit is called the annointing, (1 Ioh. 2. 20. 27.) It is as an ointment powred forth, (Cant. 1. 3.) which ſo diffuſeth the ſweetneſſe of the favour that is in it, as all that are neare it, carie away ſome of the ſweetneſſe of it. And is it not a great comfort to have aſſurance of ſuch a ſpirit? What now can be more bleſſed, then not onely to glorifie the good God with our owne tongues, but alſo to ſtirre up others by our meanes to glorifie him.
                  
                     Certenly theſe, with other like motives, were of force with him, who ſaid to God, I have not hid thy righteouſneſſe within my heart: I have declared thy faithfulneſſe, and thy ſalvation: I have not concealed thy loving kindneſſe and thy truth from the great congregation, (Pſal. 40. 10.) And againe, I will declare thy name unto my brethren: in the middeſt of the congregation will I praiſe thee. I will give thee thanks in the great congregation: I will praiſe thee among much people, Pſal. 22. 22.
                  
                  
                     Pſal. 135. 2, 3, 19, 20. 2 Chro. 7. 6. The application of this point concernes all of all ſorts. Eſpecially it concernes Miniſters to whom are committed in a peculiar manner the words of exhortation. The Prieſts and

Levites were of all moſt of all bound, as to praiſe the Lord themſelves, ſo in the middeſt of great aſſemblies to incite others, and to ſing and ſay, Praiſe ye the Lord. Next to Miniſters, Magiſtrates, who are as Generalls and Captaines in the Lords army, are bound by vertue of their authority over others to provoke them to praiſe the Lord. Thus Moſes 
                     Exo. 15. 1.
                     and the children of Iſrael, not he alone, but he with them, he directing and inciting them, ſang unto the Lord. So Deborah 
                     Iudg. 5. 1.and Barak ſaid to the people, Praiſe ye the Lord. The like I might inſtance in David, Salomon, Aſa, Iehoſaphat, Hezekiah, Ioſiah, Nehemiah, and other pious Magiſtrates. And becauſe Governours of families, whether husbands, parents, or maſters, are in their houſes as Kings and Prieſts, to them alſo it belongs to ſee that ſuch as are under their 1 Sam. 1. 7.charge do praiſe the Lord. Thus Elkanah for this very end tooke his wives along with him when he went to the Temple. Gen. 35. 2.Thus, for this very end alſo, Iacob calleth upon his whole houſhold, wives, children, ſervants, and all that were with him, to prepare themſelves ſolemnly to praiſe the 
                     Ioſ. 24. 15.
                     Lord. And Ioſhuah undertaketh for himſelfe and his houſhold to ſerve the Lord. Finally it appertaineth to neighbours, friends, and all ſorts even of private Chriſtians by vertue of the common bond of nature, whereby all are one 
                     Iſa. 58. 7.
                     fleſh, and that nearer bond of ſpirituall union whereby all are 1 Cor. 12. 12.
                     one body. For theſe mutuall duties of exhorting one another, of provoking one another, of edifying one another (before mentioned) are not reſtrained to any particular ſorts or kinds of people, but extended to all of all ſorts. This was wont to be the Saints phraſe, O come, let us ſing unto the 
                     Iſta eſt clariſſima Dei magnificatio quando per innumeras linguas glorificationem offerimus. Chr. Hom. 26. in Gen. 8. Iſa. 
                              •
                           6. 12.
                     
                     Lord, (Pſal. 95. 1.) And as a property of all that are of the Chriſtian Church, it was of old foretold, that many people ſhall go and ſay, Come ye, and let us goe up to the mountaine of the Lord, &amp;c. (Iſa. 2. 3.) This is an eſpeciall meanes of promoting and advancing Gods glory to doe it by many tongues. They which are guided by Satans ſpirit have their Come: their mutuall cohortations and provocations. They uſe to ſay one to another, Come ye, we will fill our ſelves with
                     
                     ſtrong drinke. Come with us, let us all have one purſe. Come, 
                     Pro. 1. 11, 14.—7. 18.
                     let us take our fill of love. Hence is it that the number of wicked ones ſo increaſeth, that they are ſo audacious and impudent in their courſes, and that they carie all before them as a violent ſtreame occaſioned by the gathering together of many waters. They do without all queſtion aggravate their condemnation hereby: yet do they hereby become witneſſes againſt many that profeſſe themſelves to be the ſervants of God, in that the ſpirit of Satan which ruleth in them, is more effectuall in them to advance Satans throne, then the ſpirit of grace in many of them which profeſſe themſelves to be the ſervants of God, to promote the glory of God.
                  But as for ſuch as are willing and forward to give evidence of their zeale of Gods glory, of their love to their brethren, and of that aſſurance they have of the raigne of the Spirit of grace in them, by inciting others to praiſe the Lord, let them well note the next doctrine.
               
               
                  §. 121. Of practiſing our ſelves what we provoke others unto.
                  
                     Obſecremus ſanctos ut pro nobis gratias agant, &amp; ipſi pro nobis hoc agamus mntuo. Chryſ. Hom. 2 in 2 Cor. 1.
                      II. WE muſt our ſelves practice what wee provoke others unto. We may and muſt (as we heard in the former §) deſire Saints to give thanks for us, but withall we may not faile our ſelves mutually to give thanks for our ſelves, and praiſe the Lord. So did this Prophet, as we have ſeene at large from the beginning of the 12 verſe to this laſt clauſe of this Pſalme. Obſerve the patternes of ſuch as in Scripture are approved for their zeale in ſtirring up others, and you ſhall find them forward to doe themſelves what they incited others unto. We will ariſe and go to Bethel, &amp;c. ſaith Iacob, (Gen. 35. 3.) As for me and my houſe, ſaith Ioſhua, (Ioſ. 24. 15.) we will ſerve the Lord. It is an uſuall phraſe of ſuch as heartily deſire to advance the glory of God, to expreſſe their deſire in the firſt perſon of the plurall number, whereby they ſhew that they intend themſelves to do what

they require of others, and therefore incite themſelves as Heb. 13. 15. Pſal. 95. 1. Iſa 2. 3. Pſal. 44. 8.—79. 13.—75. 1.well as others, thus, Let us offer to God the ſacrifice of praiſe continually. Let us ſing unto the Lord. Let us goe up to the mountaine of the Lord. We will praiſe thy name O God for ever. We will give thee thanks for ever. We will ſhew forth thy praiſe. Ʋnto thee, O God, doe wee give thankes, doe wee give thanks.
                  
                  1 Thus our care to ſtirre up others to praiſe God, will indeed appeare to ariſe from a true zeale of Gods glory, from true Chriſtian love, and from the ſpirit of grace dwelling in us, when we our ſelves do what we perſwade others unto.
                  2 Thus ſhall we add an edge to the exhortations we give others, when they ſee us leading the way before them. If ſouldiers ſee their captaines forward to thoſe enterpriſes whereunto they incite them, they wilbe much more encouraged and heartned thereunto. Wherewith can a Phyſician better perſwade a patient to obſerve the diet which he preſcribes, then by obſerving it himſelfe?
                  3 Refuſing to practice our ſelves what we exhort others to doe, maketh our exhortations to be profitable nor to others, nor to our ſelves.
                  Not to others, becauſe the edge of our exhortations muſt needs be much blunted thereby. For people wilbe ready to Luk 4. 23.ſay, Phyſitian heale thy ſelfe. Hardly will they be brought to think, that we ſpeake to them from our hearts, or that we our ſelves are well perſwaded of the equity, excellency, neceſſity and benefit of that whereunto we perſwade them.
                  Not to our ſelves, becauſe thus they are made evidences againſt us, witneſſing that we knew the right courſe which we refuſed to take; whereby we make our ſelves worthy of Luk 12 47.
                     more ſtripes, and aggravate our damnation.
                  4 This great miſchiefe (beſide many others) ariſeth from not practiſing what we perſwade others to, that impious mens mouthes are opened to diſgrace our profeſſion, and blaſpheme the name of our God. Thou that teachest another, 
                     Rom. 2. 21, 24.
                     teacheſt thou not thy ſelfe? The name of God is blasphemed thorow you,
                  
                  
                     
Yee therefore that deſire to manifeſt a true intention of heart in advancing the glory of God after the beſt manner that you can, and to give proofe that an holy zeale of Gods glory poſſeſſeth your ſoule, and ſetteth you on work to do what you doe in inciting others to praiſe the Lord: ye that deſire to have your pious endeavours therein to be of good uſe, not to prove fruſtrate and vaine, but to be effectuall to the end you aime at: yee that would not pull downe with one hand what you ſeeme to build up with another: nor afford occaſion to them whom you ſtirre up to ſo weighty and bounden a dutie, to thinke that by-reſpects moove you to incite them, in that wherein yee your ſelves are ſo cold and careleſſe: yee that would have comfort in performing ſo warrantable and profitable a dutie, Take due notice of the direction here preſcribed. Vpon your owne performance (as the Pſalmiſt here doth) provoke others to be followers of you, and to doe as you doe. Firſt ſay, and ſay it from the heart to him that ſearcheth the heart, in truth to him that deſireth truth in the inward parts, ſay unto the Lord, I will offer to thee the ſacrifice of thanksgiving: and then ſay unto others, Praiſe ye the Lord.
                  
                  Oh that Miniſters, Magiſtrates, Governours of families, and all that have either function, or diſpoſition to call upon others to praiſe the Lord, would firſt take notice of the many, juſt, and weighty occaſions that themſelves have to praiſe him, and anſwerably bind themſelves ſo to do, and be carefull to performe what they are bound to performe, having their owne hearts filled with matter of praiſes, and their mouthes wide opened to utter the ſame: ſo might they with much courage and confidence ſpeake to others and ſay, PRAISE YE THE LORD.

                  FOr a particular application of the generall ſumme and ſcope of the Pſalme, and of the two laſt mentioned duties of praiſing God our ſelves, and of provoking others ſo to doe, let us take a view of the ſpeciall occaſions which the Lord doth now, even at this preſent time give us to quicken our owne and others ſpirits to render all poſſible thanks unto him for his unſpeakable bleſſings on our owne, and other nations.
                  1 We here in England doe ſtill enjoy the great bleſſing of peace, together with that farre greater bleſſing the Gospell of peace, and a free uſe of all Gods holy ordinances requiſite for our ſpirituall edification and eternall ſalvation.
                  At this time this bleſſing ought to be the more highly eſteemed, becauſe it is in a manner proper to us. For moſt of the parts of Chriſtendome are now, or lately have beene exceedingly annoyed with bloudy warre.
                  
                     Of this bleſſing, Scotland, Ireland, and all the parts of His moſt excellent Majestie our Soveraigne Lord King CHARLES, do partake.

                      Of the benefit of this bleſſing I have els where treated. So as here I need no longer to inſiſt upon it.
                  2 The laſt yeare there was great ſcarcity of corne every where in this land. Corne roſe to a greater price then hath beene knowne in our memories. And where in former times ſupply in like caſes hath beene made by the plenty of other countries, All the nations round about us were pinched with penury: ſo as there was too great cauſe of fearing a famine.
                  But the Lord was pleaſed to heare the heavens, whereupon the heavens heard the earth, and the earth heard the corne, the graſſe, and all manner of fruits, and they heard England, and the cry of the poore therein.
                  Thus by the divine providence our land brought forth ſuch a plentifull harveſt, and the heavens afforded ſo faire a

ſeaſon for gathering it in, as ſcarcity is turned into plenty, deareneſſe into cheapeneſſe. Our floores are now full of wheate: we eat in plenty and are ſatisfied.
                  The miſery of famine giveth ſufficient proofe of the great benefit of plenty.
                  3 There was alſo the laſt yeare great feare of much ſickneſſe: and that of the infectious, peſtilentious ſickneſſe, which ſome few yeares before had moneth after moneth, weeke after weeke, day after day deſtroyed ſuch multitudes, as the feare of the returne thereof was the more terrible.
                  Phyſitians gave up their opinion, that the aire was infected.
                  The famous Vniverſity of Cambridge was ſo ſmitten therewith, as for the ſpace of halfe a yeare and more, Colledges were diſſolved, Students diſperſed, Readings and Acts intermitted, that populous place made deſolate, and the poore that remained much pinched with poverty.
                  Other great market townes round about in the country were alſo the laſt yeare much infected with the plague: and many people were thereby deſtroyed, or brought into great exigences.
                  But now hath the Lord healed our land. Sickneſſe is removed, and health reſtored to our borders.
                  If the miſerable deſolation that the plague maketh in many places, taking away Magiſtrates from their ſubjects, Miniſters from their people, husbands and wives one from another, parents from children, children from parents, deare friends, helpfull neighbours one from another; and then eſpecially depriving perſons of the comfort of their beſt friends, when they ſtand in moſt need of them. If (I ſay) the miſerable condition occaſioned by the plague be well weighed, we ſhall find our deliverance and freedome from the ſame to be a great bleſſing.
                  To amplifie this bleſſing the more, Gods more then ordinary providence, not onely in abating the violence of that extraordinary ſickneſſe which in the yeare 1625 ſo fiercely

but alſo in his ſpeedy ſuppreſſing, and utter removing it, is frequently and ſeriouſly to be conſidered. A diſtinct narration thereof is § 3

                  The more terrible the three evill arrowes of warre, famine and plague are, the more remarkable are the bleſſings of peace, plenty, and health.
                  
                     4 The birth of Prince CHARLES. 4 We in our dayes have ſuch a bleſſing conferred upon us, as hath not fallen out in England foureſcore and thirteene yeares before: which is the Birth of a Prince, heire to the crowne. Bleſſed in this reſpect be the nine and twentieth day of May 1630. On that day was Prince CHARLES borne.
                  From the twelfth of October 1537. whereon Prince Edward (who was Edward 6. King of England) was borne, to the ſaid 29 of May 1630, England was not honoured with ſuch a bleſſing. This is an incomparable bleſſing to this preſent age, and to future ages alſo, as we ſtedfaſtly hope, and from our hearts with the moſt humble devotion, and the moſt earneſt affection that we can, we daily pray.
               
               
                  §. 123. Of the preſent liberty of the reformed Churches in France.
                  
                  CHriſtian charity requireth that we be affected with the bleſſings conferred on others: eſpecially ſuch as are of the ſame faith and profeſſion that we are. Let us therefore caſt our eyes on other Churches, and their preſent condition: which if we duely obſerve, we ſhall find Gods gracious providence to be more then ordinarily extended towards them in theſe our daies.
                  We will begin with the reformed Churches in France.
                  
                  When Henry 4 ſtiled the great, deceaſed, by that favour he had ſhewed, and peace he had given to thoſe of the reformed religion in his kingdome, they were made ſo ſafe and ſecure in mans opinion, as it was ſuppoſed that no power was able to wreſt their liberty from them.
                  They had above two hundred walled and fenced

townes for their refuge and ſafety.
                  Many of the greateſt nobility in France were their partizans, and ſeemed moſt affectionate to the religion.
                  They had troupes and armies of men well diſciplined in armes, with many brave Commanders, and old-beaten ſoldiers.
                  They were well provided with all ſtore of amunition. Nothing requiſite for defence and ſafety was wanting in mans imagination.
                  It is to be feared that they were too confident in the arme of fleſh: which that they might the more thorowly diſcerne, the Lord withdrew his protection, and left them to defend themſelves againſt the power of their owne Soveraigne, which at firſt they too much ſleighted.
                  Soone after that their now Soveraigne had raiſed and brought his forces againſt them, many of their chiefeſt Commanders revoulted, their ſouldiers were ſlaine, their treaſures exhauſted, their cities and townes of defence were violently wreſted from them, or treacherouſly given up: many bloudy maſſacres were made among them: and the miſerable effects of warre ſo depopulated their countrie, and deſtroyed their perſons, as they were left deſtitute without all ſuccour, or hope of reliefe: And ſince the laſt taking in of Rochel, the King, who was of a contrary religion to them, became an abſolute Maſter of them.
                  What now in mans eye could be looked for, but that utterly they ſhould be deprived of the liberty of their religion, and by little and little be enforced to the idolatrous ſuperſtition of the Romiſh Church: or at leaſt be bred up in blindneſſe and ignorance, being left without the light of the Goſpell to guide, and comfort them in that their miſerable condition?
                  Yet now in theſe happy daies of deliverances, behold how in their greateſt extremity, when all humane meanes failed them, the Lord of hoſts hath beyond all hope afforded them much peace and quietnes; and provided for them new Churches, built with their Kings good leave, yea and

at his coſt and charges, becauſe they had beene demoliſhed by the fury of impious ſouldiers, and by the out-rage of ſuperſtitious people.
                  Thorow that liberty which now they enjoy, their Churches are diligently frequented, and all Gods ordinances duly obſerved, and their religion with leſſe ſcorne and deriſion profeſſed, then formerly.
                  Their peace and ſecurity is now greater then when they had the fore-mentioned meanes to embolden them to ſtand upon their owne guard.
                  This is the Lords doing. It is marvellous in our eyes.
                  They had no Moſes, no Ioſhua to worke for them.
                  As they had no power within to defend them from the might and malice of their enemie, ſo they could expect no aid from abroad to encourage them to ſtand out againſt their enemies. All the aid that from abroad was afforded unto them, proved altogether in vaine.
                  
                     Iſa. 11. 6. &amp;c. 
                     God is all in all to them. He that ſaid, The wolfe ſhall dwell with the lambe, and the leopard ſhall lie downe with the kid: and the calfe and the lion, and the fatling together, and a little child ſhall lead them: and the ſucking child ſhall play on the hole of the aspe, and the weined child ſhall put his hand on the cockatrice den, hath wrought this concord betwixt them and the adverſaries of their religion.
                  
                  
                     Pro. 21. 1. The Kings heart is in the hand of the Lord as the rivers of water: he turneth it whether ſoever he will. To his Churches therefore hath the Lord turned the heart of that King for their good.
                  
                  What the inward affection of the King to thoſe of the reformed religion is, is a ſecret. Whether the peace that thoſe Churches enjoy be occaſioned by reaſon of that ſupreme power which now he hath obtained over them, or by reaſon of his embroilements at home, and undertakings abroad, little skilleth for the matter in hand. Sure it is that the Lord hath ordered all things that have fallen out in France for the good and peace of his Churches there.
                  Should not due notice be taken hereof?
               
               
                  
                  §. 124. Of Gods late mercies to the Low-Countries.
                  
                  FRom reformed Churches in France we will paſſe to the Low-Countries who are of the ſame profeſſion.
                  In recounting Gods late mercies to them (which is the taske that we have undertaken: thereby to ſhew what great cauſe we now have to ſet out the praiſes of the Lord) it would be too farre a digreſſion to begin with thoſe extraordinary deliverances which they had when firſt they recovered their liberty againſt the cruelty and tyranny of Duke D' Alva.
                  
                  Later mercies are theſe that follow.
                  1 A ſtrong faction of Arminians being raiſed up and diſperſed thorowout all their provinces, whereby the truth and purity of religion was much corrupted, and the tranquillity and ſecurity of their State put into great hazard, a Nationall Synod, not without the counſell and conſent of our royall Defender of the Faith, King IAMES, was aſſembled at Dort, whereunto moſt grave, learned, and judicious Divines out of all the reformed Churches in Chriſtendome came; who all with one unanimous conſent determined ſundry fundamentall points of our Chriſtian Religion againſt the contrary errors of the Adverſaries of Gods free grace. A mercy not to be forgotten.
                  2 The enemy having gathered ſuch an army as made him maſter of the field whereby he ſo ſtrongly beſieged Breda, (a frontier town, of great command every way round about) as no ſuccour could be afforded it, but it was forced to yeeld, at which time alſo Grave Maurice, Prince of Orange, their brave Generall, died, great feare there was of much miſchiefe, if not of utter ruine, to befall that State. But by Gods Providence, their great enemy Spinola was called into another country, and a ſupply made of the loſſe of their former Generall, by ſubſtituting in his roome his owne brother, whoſe prudence and proweſſe ſucceſſe hath crowned: ſo as they are now better ſecured then they were before.
                  
                     
3 Spaine provided an exceeding great treaſure for the fore-ſaid States, which it never intended to them. The whole fleet of gold, ſilver, and other rich merchandizes which the Spaniards by the helpe of the Weſt-Indians had beene ſundry yeares gathering together, the Nether-landers tooke on a ſudden: whereby their enemies were much diſfurniſhed, and they themſelves ſo plentifully furniſhed, as they were the better enabled, not onely to defend themſelves, but alſo to offend their enemies.
                  4 The States being now well prepared, they quickly become maſters of the field, and with much reſolution attempt that which the enemy little feared they ſhould attaine: namely to take in the Boſche, a very ſtrong frontier towne: well fenced, well manned, and every way well prepared and provided for. But they ſo beſiege it, as no reliefe can be afforded to it: they ſo aſſault it, as there is no ſtanding out againſt them. They take it, and keepe it.
                  5 While they lay at this ſiege, another booty falls into their hands. Weſell the magazin of their enemie, wherein all warlike proviſion was in great abundance ſtoared up, ſending out ſome of their garriſons abroad, notice thereof comes to the armie of the States in ſiege at the Boſche. They forthwith ſend ſome troupes to ſurprize Weſell on a ſudden. They come to it unexpected, and quickly take it. Thus are the States againe furniſhed with their enemies proviſion. They take a ſtrong towne of great conſequence, which is as an inlett for them into the Palatinate. And by this meanes an enemy that with a great army was entred into their country, and burnt and ſpoiled all before him, was forced backe againe.
                  6 This laſt yeare while the army of the States is quiet at home, the enemy having plotted ſome miſchievous deſigne againſt them, unexpectedly ſends an army by water into their territories, which (like a flocke of fooliſh birds) flew into nets that were not laid for them: and were taken.
                  What can we thinke, but that the finger of God hath beene in the ordering of theſe ſucceſſefull matters for the

better ſecurity of them who profeſſe and maintaine the true religion againſt the profeſſed enemies thereof.
               
               
                  §. 125. Of the ſeaſonable ſuccour afforded to oppreſſed Germany.
                  
                  AMong other evidences of the divine Providence towards the reformed Churches, the late ſeaſonable ſuccour afforded to the Churches in Germany is moſt remarkable.
                  Many yeares together hath Germany beene ſore vexed with inteſtine and civill warre.
                  Who can without a melting heart, thinke on the much bloud that hath beene ſpilt: the ruines of many faire Cities, Townes, Caſtles, Churches and other edifices that have beene made: the diſtreſſes that many exiles of all ſorts, Princes and Subjects, Noble and Meane, Clergy and Laiety, Male and Female, Old and Young have beene brought unto: the miſerable bondage under which ſuch as have remained in their owne territories and habitations, have groaned: the heavy and undue taxes that have beene laid on ſuch as have not had their titles, dignities, inheritances, callings and liberties by violence wreſted from them: who can without much compunction and compaſſion heare of or thinke on thoſe and many other preſſures and oppreſſions? See the Narration of the Proteſtants Diet at Leipſich. Feb. 8. 1631.
                  
                  The Princes of the reformed Churches in Germany were forced to put up a joint complaint, and remonſtrance of their grievances, and to conſult about means, at leaſt of ſome eaſe (for their burdens were intollerable) if not of full redreſſe.
                  But their complaints proved like to the complaints of the Iſraelites put up to Pharaoh for eaſing their heavy burdens. Their ſavour thereby came to be abhorred in the eyes of 
                     Exo. 5. 21.
                     Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his ſervants. They were in a worſe caſe then before.
                  So proud was the enemy by reaſon of the great armies that he had gathered together, and ſo fleſht he was in the

conqueſts that he had made, as he regarded no complaints, he feared no revenge. He deemed his power to be invincible.
                  When thus the reformed Churches in Germany were brought to the loweſt ebbe, and ſo neare to the pits brink, as they were upon tumbling downe to their utter ruine, that mans extremity might appeare to be Gods opportunity, in a moſt ſeaſonable time the Lord raiſed up, and ſent unto them a Deliverer, Guſtavus of Sued, in whoſe title is couched Auguſtus and Deus: Guſtavus, importing by tranſpoſition of letters, Augustus: and Sued read backward, Deus.
                  
                  If the ſmall army with which he came into Germany, and the great things which he hath done ſince he came thither, be duly weighed, we ſhall ſee cauſe to acknowledge that the Lord of hoſts was with him.
                  That which is by experience noted of the ſnow, that by being tumbled up and downe, of a little ball it comes to be a great heape that can hardly be ſtirred, is likewiſe by experience found verified in his army.

                     We read of a dreame which a ſouldier of the huge hoſt of the Midianites that for multitude was as the ſand by the ſea-ſide, thus related to his fellow, I dreamed a dreame, and loe, a cake of barley bread tumbled unto the hoſt of Midian, and came unto it, and ſmote it, that it fell and overturned it, that the tent lay along. The interpretation, which in the event proved moſt true, was this, This is nothing elſe ſave the ſword of Gideon the ſonne of Ioaſh, a man of Iſrael: for into his hand hath God delivered Midian, and all the host.
                  
                     A fit alluſion thereunto, which hath likewiſe in the event proved to be moſt true, may be this, The ſword of the King of Sued, a Defender of the true Religion, hath ſmitten the armies of the enemies of the Goſpell: and into his hand hath the Lord delivered his Churches enemies.

                        a facit martyrem. Aug. Epiſt. 61.
                      All confeſſe that it is not ſo much the puniſhment that maketh martyrdome glorious, as the cauſe.
                  So is it in warre. The cauſe rather then the event makes it warrantable and praiſe-worthy. Good ſucceſſe in juſt warre brings much glory to the undertakers thereof.
                  In this reſpect victorious Gustavus carieth away more

glory then Sennacherib, Nebuchadnezar, Darius, Cyrus, Alexander, Caeſar, or other the great Conquerers among the heathen.
                  Of thoſe Conquerors who are commended by the Holy Ghoſt, it is ſaid that they ſubdued kingdomes and wrought righteouſneſſe.
                  
                  Might and Right muſt goe together. Right without might may be much wronged. Might without right may do much wrong.
                  Take we therefore a briefe view of the cauſes of ſundry other conquerours, and we ſhall find might without right.
                  Take we a view of the cauſes which moved the conquering King of Sued to undertake his warres, and we ſhall find might regulated by right.
                  The cauſe which moved conquering Monarchs in former times to enter into other mens dominions, and to ſubdue nations, was eſpecially the pride of their heart, and their ambition to have the ſupreme ſoveraignty over the whole world, if poſſibly they could atchieve it.
                  It is ſaid of Alexander the great, that when he heard the Philoſophers concluſion concerning the unity of the world, he wept becauſe there were no more worlds for him to overcome. Behold the ambition of mens minds, how boundleſſe, how unſatiable it is.
                  The fore-mentioned Caeſar invaded Germany, France, England and other nations, to enlarge the dominion of the Romane Empire. So did other Romane Generals before and after Caeſar.
                  
                  True it is that God in his unſearchable wiſdome ſtirred up many of them to be his inſtruments to puniſh peoples rebellions againſt God. In which reſpect they are called the Iſa 10. 5. Ier. 12. 1

                     Rod of the Lord, his ſtaffe, his ſword. Yea God is ſaid to put his ſword into their hands: and becauſe the Lord uſeth them as his inſtruments, they are in that reſpect ſtiled The Lords Annointed, his ſervants, his Shepheards. Yet notwithſtanding this ſecret intent of the Lord which he by their Miniſtry brought to paſſe, they were ſtirred up by pride and ambition

to do what they did. So ſaith the Lord of Aſhur: O 
                     Iſa 10. 5, 7, 13.

Howbeit he meaneth not ſo, &amp;c. For, he ſaith by the ſtrength of my hand I have done it, and by my wiſdome, &amp;c. And further to ſhew that they by their inward wicked diſpoſition were ſet on worke, it is ſaid, that when God gave

                     people into their hands, they ſhewed them no mercy: and againe, when the Lord was a little diſpleaſed, they helped forward the affliction.
                  
                  But the pious and righteous King of Sued hath made it manifeſt to all the world, that no ambitious thoughts, no deſire of enlarging his owne Dominions, by forcing away other mens rights from them, hath embroiled him in theſe Germane-warres.
                  
                  Great wrongs were done to him by the Enemy, and feare given of greater, if he looked not the better to himſelf. So as he was forced to take up armes to ſecure his owne dominions, and his neighbours bordering upon him.
                  
                     2 Sam. 5 17. It is noted of the Philistimes that they came up to ſeeke David. Whereby is implied that they firſt provoked him to warre: and his ſetting upon them, and deſtroying them is thereby juſtified.
                  
                     2 Sam. 10. 4, &amp;c. It is alſo recorded of the Syrians, that they helped the Ammonites who had moſt deſpitefully uſed Davids Ambaſſadours; Thereby Davids warring againſt the Ammonites and Syrians is juſtified. Againſt the Ammonites for wrong done to David: againſt the Syrians for aiding Davids enemies.
                  Such provocations had King Guſtavus to enter upon theſe later warres. He was firſt ſought by the Enemy. His Ambaſſadours were baſely uſed. This later Enemy ſent armies under his owne Enſignes in aid of the Pole his former enemy, with whom he was then in warre.
                  Beſides theſe wrongs done to himſelfe, Complaints and invitations were made to him by ſundry oppreſſed Princes and States, and particularly of thoſe, to whom he was engaged

by ancient allyances and confederacies. By theſe alſo he was drawne into theſe warres, wherein the divine providence hath given him ſo good ſucceſſe, and ſo great glory.
                  
                     Gen. 14. 14. 
                     Abraham on ſuch a ground as this later is, was moved to take up armes againſt thoſe that ſpoiled Sodom where his brother Lot was: wherein the Lord gave him good ſucceſſe.
                  
                     Ioſ. 10. 6, &amp;c. 
                     Ioſhua alſo on ſuch a ground made warre againſt the five Kings of the Amorites who encamped againſt Gibcon. The Gibconites were at that time in league with the Iſraelites: Thereupon Gibeon being invaded by the Amorites, ſends unto Ioſhua to the camp, ſaying, Slake not thy hand from thy ſervants, come up to us quickly, and ſave us and helpe us.
                  
                  Thus Guſtavus in affording ſuccour to ſuch as were oppreſſed and craved his aid (they being alſo his confederates) hath done that which ſuch as were guided by Gods Spirit have done before him: and that as well for ſecuring his owne dominions, as for relieving others. For, had that flood of warre, which over flowed and in a manner ruinated the greater part of Germany, beene ſuffered to ſwell and run longer and further, it might have made an irrecoverable breach even unto the very Kingdome of Sued.
                  
                  Where that floud of warre had a current, it carried away the true Religion before it: it bare away Princes out of their principalities, other Governours out of their juriſdictions, Miniſters of Gods Word from their charges, Owners from their poſſeſſions, and others from their places, and callings: it deprived free cities of their immunities and priviledges: and brought many miſchiefes and inconveniences to many others.
                  Wherefore to preſerve true Religion where it was in great hazard to be ſuppreſſed: to re-eſtabliſh it where it was removed: to reſtore Princes, other Governours, Miniſters, Owners, and others to their owne rights: to recover to free people their priviledges: to bring home the baniſhed: to take off the heavy yoke of bondage and intolerable burdens from their necks on whom they were unjuſtly laid:

and finally to prevent cruell maſſacres and perſecutions for the Goſpell ſake, hath this contrary ſtreame of warre beene oppoſed; ſo as violence by violence (as neceſſity required) hath beene reſiſted: and a ſtrong ſtreame of ſweet waters hath beaten backe a great flood of ſalt waters.
               
               
                  §. 127. Of the effects of the Suediſh Kings warres.
                  THe bleſſed events that have followed upon the King of Sued his warres in Germany do give evident proofe to the truth of the ends and intents before mentioned. For, thereby true Religion is in many places re-eſtabliſhed, and a free liberty for exerciſe thereof procured to the profeſſours of it: Ancient immunities and priviledges are recovered: Princes, other Governours, Miniſters of the Goſpell, States, Polities, private Lords and Owners are reſtored to their dominions, dignities, charges, callings, inheritances, and poſſeſſions: Many people are eaſed of their heavy burdens and grievances.
                  There hath alſo hereupon followed a great abatement of the greatneſſe of the houſe of Auſtria, and ſuch a diminution of the power thereof, as that they who have beene the chiefe pillars of the Church of Rome, are by theſe late victories got againſt them, diſabled (as we hope) from helping forward the Popes deſigne of reducing the Chriſtian world to an abſolute obedience unto his chaire; yea and from further promoting their owne ambitions deſires of the Monarchy of Europe.
                  
                  By the fore-named ſucceſſe there is alſo procured much addition and great ſtrength to the Proteſtant parties, by digeſting all Germany into their body: and a great means effected for facilitating the unions betwixt thoſe that to the great ſcandall of the Profeſſion, and diſhonour of thoſe worthy lights of the Church, Luther and Calvin, have beene diſtinguiſhed by theſe factious titles, Lutherans and Calviniſts.
                  
                  
                     
Great ſecurity is hereby further brought to the reformed Churches in France: who could never be reduced to the termes wherein they now are, ſo long as the Proteſtant Princes in Germany retained freedome and power in their owne dominions.
                  A way is alſo hereby opened to the very gates of Rome: whereby the threatnings againſt the ſeven-headed beaſt may in the Lords appointed time be accompliſhed.
                  Finally, there is great hope given of eſtabliſhing much peace and ſecurity to all the true Churches of God: and many other bleſſings are expected, which the Lord grant to his people.
               
               
                  §. 128. Of praiſing God for the fore-ſaid mercies.
                  TO make a briefe recapitulation, and to gather up the Summe of all, for the better application of the maine point intended.
                  The Lord having ſecured our Peace, and removed from us his judgements of Plague and Famine:
                  
                  The Lord having reſtored to the reformed Churches in France a gracious liberty for exerciſing their Religion:
                  
                  The Lord having with more then ordinary ſucceſſe proſpered the affaires of our neareſt Neighbours, the States generall of the united Provinces in the Netherlands:
                  
                  The Lord having ſuccoured his oppreſſed Churches in Germany, and given to their Deliverer victories beyond expectation, unto admiration:
                  The Lord having given very many cleare evidences of his fatherly care over his Churches every where, and of his gracious providence towards them, even now in theſe our daies:
                  Should not our ſoules be affected with all and every of theſe mercies? Should they not be incenſed with an ardent zeale of ſetting forth the honour of his name?
                  
                     
We and others of the ſame profeſſion, of the ſame religion enjoy the comfort and benefit of the fore-mentioned mercies, and of many other mercies flowing from the divine Providence: and ſhall not the Lord who ſo ordereth his Providence for our good, have the praiſe and glory thereof?
                  Who can give ſu
                        ••
                     icient thanks? Nay, whoſe ſoule can be ſatisfied in rendring praiſes to ſo good and gracious a God for ſo many and ſo great bleſſings, ſo ſeaſonably and ſo freely conferred on his Churches?
                  Should not all Miniſters of the Goſpell make their Churches to ring againe with ſounding forth Gods praiſes?
                  Should not publiſhers of bookes make mention of theſe mighty works of the Lord to the further publiſhing of his name?
                  Should not the wits of all divine Poets bee ſet on worke to indite due formes of praiſes for the better magnifying of his name, who hath done ſo glorious things for us?
                  Should not every Chriſtian ſoule in the beſt manner that it can, adde ſomething to the magnifying of Gods name: as every one brought ſomething to the building of the Tabernacle?
                  
                  Did we not while the Lord was time after time ſhooting out againſt us and others his three deadly arrowes of plague, famine, and ſword, humble our ſoules before him, and call upon him inſtantly, continually, to ſpare his people, to remove his wrath, to take away his judgements?
                  Should we not now, the Lord having gratiouſly heard our prayers for our ſelves and others be hearty and zealous, inſtant and conſtant in rendring all poſſible praiſe and thankes unto him?
                  It hath beene before declared §. 51 79.how true gratefulneſſe hath eſpeciall relation to God, and aſcribeth the glory of all deliverances to him: and that §. 85.
                     Praiſe is the beſt gift that can be given him: and that thereupon §. 108.
                     Saints are never ſatisfied in ſetting forth Gods praiſes: They content not themſelves with an inward affection of praiſing God in their owne ſoules, or ſecretly betwixt God and themſelves, but they

muſt needs breake forth into praiſes of God, and §. 86.
                     manifeſt their inward gratitude by outward gratulation▪
                      and that §. 116. 118
                     publikely, boldly, among much people, in the middeſt of great aſſemblies: §. 120.exhorting and inciting others to praiſe God with thee: and §. 121.themſelves conſcionably practiſing what they incite others unto.
                  Now we have ſo great and juſt grounds at this time to praiſe God, let us take the occaſions of ſtirring up our owne and others ſpirits to do it heartily and zealouſly: that God finding his bleſſings conferred on a gratefull people may never repent any kindneſſe done: but may go on to adde victory to victory, ſucceſſe to ſucceſſe, bleſſing to bleſſing, till he have finiſhed the good worke done for his Churches, and accompliſhed the promiſes which he hath made for deſtroying the kingdome of Antichriſt, calling the Iewes, bringing in the fulneſſe of the Gentiles, and conſummating all things by his laſt, and moſt glorious comming.
                  
                     Wherefore, Bleſſe the Lord, O my ſoule: and all that is within me bleſſe his holy name. Bleſſe the Lord, O my ſoule: and forget not all his benefits. My heart is fixed O God, my heart is fixed: I will ſing and giue praiſe. Awake vp my glory: I my ſelfe will awake early. My tongue ſhall ſpeake of thy righteouſneſſe, and of thy praiſe all the day long.
                  Behold, bleſſe ye the Lord, all yee ſeruants of the Lord. Giue vnto the Lord glory and ſtrength: giue vnto the Lord the glory due to his name.
                  
                     O giue thankes vnto the Lord, for he is good: for his mercy endureth for euer. Let the redeemed of the Lord ſay ſo: whom hee hath redeemed from the hand of the enemie. Let them that were exiled ſay ſo, whom he hath brought to the place of their habitation. Let them that were oppreſſed ſay ſo, whom hee hath eaſed of their heauie burdens. Let them that are freed from the infectious plague: and from pinching famine, ſay ſo. So let them ſay, who are reſtored to a free exerciſe of their religion. Praiſe yee the Lord, who quietly ſit on your thrones of iudgement, to execute righteous iuſtice and
