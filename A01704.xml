            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).

            TO THE RIGHT HOnourable
the Lord Harington
Baron of Exton, Thomas Gibſon wiſheth
all true happines, both in
this life and in the life to come.
            
               MY purpoſe (Right
Honourable) in the
dedication of theſe
ſermons, was to haue
ioyned your Honourable
father with that
worthy Citie, whereof
he was a principall
member, and had ſpeciall command and
authoritie: which place he much reſpected
and loued, and where he was againe
much reſpected and honoured. The ioy
and ornament of the Citie, was his name
and countenance, the very report and
newes of whoſe deceaſe, was the cauſe
of many a watrie eye, and of many a heauie
heart. But their ſpeciall comfort and

ioy is, that the Lord hath in mercy prouided
ſo gratious an heire, ſo worthy a
ſucceſſor, ſo vertuous a fauourer, as of
all, that are honeſt religious: ſo moſt of
all, ſuch as haue beene the faithfull
friends and intire louers of your Honourable
father: who himſelfe was a louer of
all learning, religion, and of all good
men; a true worſhipper of God, zealous
in the truth, a ſincere profeſſor &amp; friend
of the Goſpell; a fauourer of faithfull
Miniſters; a worthie member both of
Church and common-wealth: a faithful,
dutiful, ſeruiceable, and rare ſubiect:
like Moſes in faithfulnes, in meekenes
and in zeale againſt Idolatrie: like Iob a
iuſt man, fearing God, and eſchewing
euill: like Nathaniell, a true Iſraelite
without guile. Finally, a man full of
grace, pietie, curteſie, humilitie, temperance,
and other, both morall and chriſtian
vertues. I am not able to commend
him, according to his deſerts: that requires
a larger diſcourſe, and it would
perhaps proue an increaſe of ſorrow,
which is rather to be abated then renewed▪
I will therefore bend my ſelfe
to adminiſter comfort for ſo great a

loſſe, a loſſe ſo generall to Church and
common-wealth. Friends and followers,
Tenants and ſeruants, and for my
owne part, I cannot but beare a part in
ſorrow for the loſſe of ſo kind a Patron
and Benefactor, both to me and mine.
Yet this is the vſe of the prayſes of the
dead, not onely for imitation of their
vertues, but alſo for the cōfort of friends
aliue. And is this a ſmall comfort, Right
Honourable, that you had ſuch a father?
yea a comfort and bleſſing it is to be of
the ſeed of the righteous. It is a further
comfort, that you enioyed him ſo long
till your ſelfe came to ripeneſſe of
yeares, &amp; that he died in a good age, full
of daies, few of his Aunceſtors liued longer:
and howſoeuer he left this life in a
ſtrange countrey, yet (no doubt) he died
in the true faith of Ieſus Chriſt (which
he ſincerely profeſſed all his life) and in
the honourable and faithfull ſeruice of
his gratious Soueraigne the Lords annointed.
It is no wonder, that old men
die, rather it is a wonder in theſe latter
daies that any liue ſo long. Moſes in his
time made account of mans ordinarie
age, to be threeſcore yeares and ten.

Now the world decayes, and the daies
of our life is ſhortned. We heare daily of
the death of Infants, children, young
men, yea Princes taken away in the
prime and ſtrength of their yeares: what
maruell then though the ancient 
                  •
               ie?
when the apple is ripe it muſt needs fall;
when the candle is ſpent, the light muſt
needs goe out. This vſe we are to make
of the death of young or old, to remember
alwaies our mortall ſtate, and the
vncertaintie of our life, to be alwaies
readie and prepared, not to regard but
contemne the luſts of the fleſh, the luſt
of the eie, and the pride of life, pleaſures,
honours, riches, and the vanities of this
wicked world. Many moe comforts we
haue againſt exceſſiue and immoderate
ſorrowe for the death of our beſt and
deareſt friends, as to conſider what they
leaue, (a miſerable world) and whither
they goe, (to the hauen of happineſſe.)
The beſt ſort of the Heathen vſed three
remedies againſt ſuch kind of ſorrow.
Firſt, to conſider that death is common
to all and vnauoydable. Secondly, that
it is the end of miſerie and hauen of reſt.
Thirdly, that it is likely, that the ſoules

liue and are bleſſed. We haue the ſame
and more ſure comforts. We know that
our Redeemer liues, and that wee ſhall
ſee him as hee is. Wee know not onely
the immortality of the ſoule, but the glorious
reſurrection of the body; and that
thoſe that dye in the Lord are bleſſed.
Nothing comes to paſſe without Gods
pouidence, who is wiſe and mightie:
We pray that his will may be done both
of vs and in vs. It will nothing auaile vs
to torment our ſelues, we are borne to
dye; many thouſands are gone before
vs, and we muſt follow.
            Pardon my boldnes (right Honourable)
in preſuming to put you in minde
of theſe thinges, which (both by your
own priuate reading, and publicke heauing
of many worthy men) you doe already
know and vnderſtand ſufficiently.
Yet in my loue to your Honour, giue me
leaue to adde ſome further inſtruction.
It hath alwaies beene the endeuour of
Sathan, the common aduerſarie of mans
ſaluation, by all means poſſible, to draw
all ſorts, degrees, and ages of men, from
the true care and ſtudie of religion and
vertue: to the effecting whereof, hee

hath from euery eſtate his pretended
colours and faire pleaſing ſhewes of
perſwaſion &amp; alluremēt, perſwading the
elder ſort, that it is a thing vnſeemely
&amp; vnbefitting their grauitie, to become
ſchollers in Chriſts ſchoole, ſeeing their
heads are filled with other matters:
namely, of the Common-wealth and affaires
of this world. Hee can tell the
middle ſort, which are in the prime of
ſtrength and witte, that it is againſt all
equitie and reaſon, that ſuch ſhould bee
depriued of the pleaſures and delights
of the fleſh and the world. And as for
the younger ſort, hee will eaſilie make
make them beleeue, that it is not yet
time to ſerue God, that the points of religion
are too high for them, and able to
dull and trouble their tender wits, buzzing
into their eares that wicked prouerbe;

Thus by his will he would haue none religious,
becauſe he would haue none ſaued;
but rather that all ſhould periſh
and come to vtter ruine and deſtruction.
It is a torment and vexation vnto him to
ſee any well diſpoſed in religion: but if
wee hearken to the counſell of God in

his word, wee ſhall ſoone finde Sathan
herein a lyer, a murtherer, a ſeducer:
For the Lord chargeth all ſorts and degrees
of men, to giue themſelues, and
that betimes, to religion and vertue:
commaunding his law to bee read and
publiſhed to men, women and children.
The Kingly Prophet,Pſal. 148. 11. 12. 13. exhorts Kings of
the earth and all people, Princes and

maydens alſo, old men and children to
prayſe the name of the Lord.1. Tim. 5. 1. Saint Paul
chargeth Timothie and Titus to teach

Iohn writeth his Epiſtle to fathers,1. Ioh.

young men and children; therefore the
youngeſt are not exempted in regard
of their young and tender yeeres:Eccle. 12, 1. Inaſmuch
as God is their Creator, they are
to remember him in the dayes of their
youth: Seeing in their firſt entrance into
the world they haue beene baptiſed
into the name of the bleſſed Trinitie,
and ſo haue taken vpon them the profeſſion
of true religion, their proceeding
and practiſe when they come to yeeres
muſt be anſwerable to their beginning.
Further, that age is ſlipperie, weake,

dangerous, and ſubiect to many temptations,
eaſilie ſeduced and ouercome by
bad counſell and company: They had
neede therefore betimes to bee armed
with the ſhielde of faith, and ſword of
the ſpirit: their witte and capacitie is
then moſt freſh &amp; pregnant to conceiue,
remember, keepe, and hold good and
gratious inſtructions.Eph. 6. 4. Parents therefore
are commaunded to bring vp their children
in inſtruction and information
of the LORD. And it is the counſell
of the wiſe man;Pro. 22. 6. Teach a childe the
trade of his way, and when hee is olde
he will not depart from it. Againe, yong
men are ſubiect to death, and muſt appeare
before the great Iudge in that day
as well as other. Neede therefore haue
they of due preparation. Beſides, a religious
diſpoſition and behauiour in
young age, will bring them credit and
honour all the dayes of their life; and
comfort, ioy, and peace of conſcience in
old age: And what ioy, what exceeding
ioy will this be to Parents, friends, Tutors,
Pro. 10. 1. teachers, and to all that loue and
feare God?Pro. 23. 24. 25. A wiſe ſonne (ſaith Salomon)
maketh a glad father, but a fooliſh

ſonne is a heauineſſe to his mother.Luke: 1. 14. 15.
It is therefore ſayde of Iohn the Baptiſt,
that his father ſhould haue ioy of him,
and many ſhould reioyce at his birth,
becauſe hee was filled with the holy
Ghoſt in his mothers wombe.2. Ioh: 4. Saint
Iohn writing to that noble and worthie
Lady, reioyceth greatly that hee found
her children walking in the trueth. And
examples we haue of grace and religion
in the younger ſorte: Samuel from his
childhood was conſecrated and dedicated
to the ſeruice of God.
            
               Ioſiah was but eight yeares old when
he began to raigne in Ieruſalem,2. Chron: 34. 1. 2. yet
there was neuer any before nor after
him,Prou: 4. 3. 4. more vertuous and religious. Salomon
though moſt tender and deare in the
eyes of his father and mother:Mat: 21. 15. yet in his
young yeares was taught diuine and heauenly
wiſedome.2. Tim. 3. 15. When our Sauiour
Chriſt came riding to Ieruſalem in a baſe
manner, though the Scribes and Phariſes
diſdained him, yet children cry, Hoſanna

commeth in the name of the Lord. Timothie
from his childhood had knowledge

Chriſt being but 12. yeares old, increaſed
in wiſedome, in ſtatute and fauour
with God and men. God will haue the
firſt borne, the firſt fruits, and he that begins
well is halfe his way. Dimidium facti
qui bene caepit habet; The tree that buds
not in the ſpring is dead, and ſuch as are
deformed in youth, neuer proue welfauoured
in age. As the arrow is firſt directed
ſo it flyeth: youth is compared to
the day, while it is day, let vs walke in the
light, the night commeth when no man
can worke. The time of youth is the
ſummer time, with the Ant and Bee, we
muſt prouide in ſummer againſt winter.
The time of youth is compared to Harueſt,
wherin men take the occaſiō, &amp; vſe
all meanes they can, for the reaping and
enioying of the fruits of the earth; if they
let that time ſlip, all is loſt. He that
ſleepes in harueſt is the ſonne of confuſion.
Dauid in his youth killeth the Lyon,
the Beare and great Goliah. Sampſon
in his youth, killed the Philiſtines; let vs
by our ſpirituall armour ouercome the

wicked one, euen in our young time.
Now beſides all this, giue me leaue
(Right Hon.) to put you in remembrance
of one worthie example of a noble
young man; Ioſeph full of grace and
vertue, worthie to be imitated of Kings,
Princes, and Potentates. In this famous
patterne I obſerue theſe ſixe vertues.
The firſt is his rare chaſtitie, who being
tempted to follie by his miſtreſſe, did
flatly refuſe her, ſaying, How can I doe
this great wickedneſſe, and ſo ſinne againſt
God? He knew with Iob, that
this was is a wickedneſſe and iniquitie
to be condemned, yea that it is a fire
which ſhall deuoure to deſtruction, and
ſhall roote out all his encreaſe. The ſecond
vertue in young 
                  
                     〈◊〉
                  
                which is the
ground of all the reſt, is his religion, and
the true feare of God in his heart. All
his actions, and all his proceedings, doe
ſauour of the feare of God. It was this
that kept him from that groſſe iniquitie.
He aſcribes the interpretatiō of dreams,
not to himſelfe but to God. He proteſteth
to his brethren, that he feareth
God. And againe, when he made himſelfe
knowne to his brethren, he ſaid, Be

not ſad, neither grieued with your ſelues
that you ſold me hither; for God did
ſend me before you for your preſeruation:

                  
                     •
                  5. 9. And when his father asked him of
his ſonnes; Theſe are my ſons (ſayd he)
which God hath giuen me. This is the
chiefe vertue in great perſons &amp; the beſt
Nobilitie.3 A third vertue in Ioſeph is his
faithfulnes to his Prince: He gathered all
the money that was found in the land of
Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the
corne which hee bought; not for his
owne priuate vſe, but for the profit of
the King his maiſter: And as he is carefull
to preſerue the royall dignitie of the
King, and ſeeketh the wealth of Pharoah;
ſo hee hath a pittifull heart to the poore
diſtreſſed people, and is carefull to relieue
them. This is an excellent vertue
in great perſons which ſerue in the
Court, not to ſeeke their owne priuate
gaine, but the credit and wealth of their
Prince, and yet to haue louing and merciful
hearts to the poore diſtreſſed commons.4
The fourth vertue in Ioſeph is his
ſeueritie and clemencie wiſely mixed
together: Hee ſpeaketh roughly to hi
                  •
               
brethren, hee threatens them, and chargeth

them to be ſpyes; and yet his heart
is full of compaſſion and loue: When
they are truely humbled &amp; know themſelues,
hee doth entertaine them kindly,
and receiue them with much ioy: And
this is a ſpeciall vertue required of Princes
and Magiſtrates. They muſt with
Dauid,

Church, Common-wealth and houſe,
ſtrike on theſe two ſtrings, Mercie and
Iudgement. They muſt bee ſeuere and
rough againſt notorious offenders, and
yet their hearts muſt be full of loue, pittie
and compaſſion.
            The fift vertue in noble Ioſeph is his patience
and magnanimitie in ſuffering ſo
great wrongs and iniuries:5 He was hardlie
dealt with all by his brethren many
waies, being reuiled, ſcorned, and ſold
into Egypt by them; falſely accuſed by
his miſtris, and vniuſtly caſt into priſon
by his maiſter. In all his miſeries he poſſeſſed
his ſoule with patience; and when
it was in his power to bee reuenged of
his brethren, he bridleth his affections,
kindly entreateth them, and ouercommeth
euill with goodneſſe. Oh rare example
of true Chriſtian patience and

courage; he feedeth them, he entertayneth
them, and preſerueth them that had
conſpired againſt him. The laſt vertue
is his kindneſſe, loue and dutie to his father;
he inquireth of his brethren touching
the life and health of his olde father.
In time of dearth hee ſent prouiſion
for him and his without money: He
ſent Chariots to bring him and h
                  •
               s familie
into Egypt: Hee went to meete
his father Iſrael, and preſented himſelfe
vnto him, falling on his necke and weeping
a good while: Hee bringeth him
before Pharoah: Hee placed his father
and brethren, giuing them poſſeſſions
in the Land of Egypt, in the beſt of the
land: He viſiteth his ſicke father; he fell
vpon his face, wept vpon him and kiſſed
him at his death: performes his will,
and honorably burieth him. And to this
kindnes al are bound by the law of God
&amp; nature, by the care, loue, &amp; benefits of
Parents towards them, for which we are
neuer able to make ſufficient recōpence.
            Theſe are the chiefe and Princely vertues
in a Noble perſon, worthie to bee
imitated of all the ſonnes of Nobles.Ambr. lib. off. cap. 17.
Moſt worthie is that of Ambroſe; Eſ

                  m dei habere, deferre

parentibus honorem, &amp;c. It is required
of good yong men to haue the
feare of God, to giue honour to
their parents, to reuerence their elders,
to keepe themſelues chaſte,
bee humble and lowly, to loue kindneſſe
and ſhamefaſtnes, which are ornaments
to young age: for as grauitie
is commended in olde men: ſo ſhamefaſtnes
in young men, as if it were by
the gift and dowry of nature: Iſaacke
a childe, fearing God, the ſonne and
heyre of Abraham, giueth ſuch honour
to his father, that hee refuſed
not death at his fathers pleaſure.
Ioſeph alſo, when hee dreamed that
the Sunne and Moone and Starres
ſhoulde worſhippe him, yet was hee
ſtill carefull to honour his father: ſo
chaſte, that hee would not haue an
vnchaſte worde: ſo ſhamefaſt, that
hee fled from his miſtreſſe: ſo humble,
that hee was content to ſerue: ſo
patient, that hee cheerefully ſuffered
impriſonment: ſo readie to forgiue
iniurie, that hee preferred thoſe that
ſought his life.Gen. 49. 22. Therefore the bleſſing
of his father fell vpon him.
            
               
Theſe things I write (Right Honourable)
not that I doubt eyther of
your good education or vertuous
diſpoſition; but hearing of your good
beginning and proceedings in grace:
my purpoſe is onely to comfort and
encourage you in that good way where
you are already entred. But for further
direction, I referre you to the
Sermons following, which I haue dedicated
to your Honour, together
with that worthie Citie where they
were preached, and where your Honour
now (to the comfort of many)
doth ſucceed your worthie father in
place and authoritie. The cauſe of
my dedication to your Honour, is;
Firſt, loue to your ſelfe, heartily wiſhing
continuance and increaſe in grace,
being the ſpeciall ioy, hope and ornament
of our Countrey. An other
cauſe is, the dutie I owe to your Ho
               
                  •
               ourable
parents; to whom both I
and mine are ſo farre obliged, that wee
ſhall neuer bee able ſo much as to bee
ſufficiently thankfull, much leſſe to requite
them.
            And thus I beſeech the Almighty

God, the father of all gifts, to beſtow
vpon your Honour the portion of Ioſeph,
all the noble vertues and graces that
were in him; all true proſperitie and
honour in this life, and an eternall inheritance
in that bleſſed and heauenly
Canaan, prepared and purchaſed by the
blood of Chriſt, for all ſuch as truely
beleeue in him.
            
               Your Honours to command
alwaies in the Lord,
THOMAS GIBSON.
            
         
         
            
            
            TO THE RIGHT
Worſhipful M. Mayor of Couentry,
the Iuſtices, Aldermen, Sheriffes,
to all the reſt of that corperation, and to
all within the liberties of that Citie,
which ſincerely profeſſe and loue the
truth of Chriſts Goſpel, T: G: wiſheth
all happines in this life,
and euerlaſting glory, in the
life to come.
            
               SVch is the gratious fauour
&amp; kindnes of our
good &amp; mercifull God
towards his children &amp;
ſeruants here on earth,
(Right worſhipfull and
beloued in the Lord) that in his loue he
vouchſafeth to accept and to approue
their weake ſeruice and workes, ſo that
they be done and performed with honeſt,
right, and good affections; And
thus he accepteth our prayer, hearing,
receiuing, almes, and other actions being
weakely and vnperfectly performed

by vs. And if the Lord were not of this
gratious inclination and nature, wee
might be vtterly diſcouraged to doe
him any ſeruice at all, conſidering the
manifold wants and infirmities that are
in vs. But being ſure of his fauour and
acceptance, and of our owne honeſt deſires,
and affections to doe more and
better then wee can performe, and
being ſorrie wee can doe no better:
we are emboldned to performe any dutie
and ſeruice to ſo good a God and louing
a father,Exod. 25. 2. 3. 4. 5. &amp;c. and it is his owne will and
commandement that we ſhould doe ſo.
Thus he ſaith to Moſes about the building
of the materiall tabernacle: Speake
to the childrē of Iſrael. that they receiue
an offering for me of euery man, whoſe
heart giueth it freely. Yet ſhall take the
offering for me, and this is the offering
which you ſhall take of them, gold, ſiluer,
and braſſe, and blew ſilke, &amp; purple,
and ſcarlet, and fine linnen, and goates
haire, Rammes skins coloured red, &amp; the
skins of Badgers, and the wood Shi
                  •
               im.
From whence we are to learne, that God
requireth the offerings of his people, for
the building of his tabernacle, and furthering

his ſeruice: Againe, that he requireth
not a compelled, but a cheerfull
ſeruice; a true, ſincere, ioyfull heart and
affectiō, And further we learne; that the
endeuour and labour of thoſe which any
way helpe the ſpirituall building, either
by coſt or counſell, ſo farre as they may,
is a ſeruice pleaſing to God. For we ſee
things there offered be of diuerſe kinds,
ſome more pretious, ſome baſe and vile.
There be difference of gifts in building
the ſpirituall tabernacle, ſome are endewed
with gold, ſome with ſiluer, ſome
with blew ſilke, and all profitable. Such
as God hath giuen, ſuch we are to bring,
and God will accept it. Some things
God appointed, that the pooreſt might
be able to offer, and no man ſhut out for
want of abilitie, they may bring wood,
ſtone, or at leaſt Goates haire. Euery one
in his calling as he hath receiued, muſt
doe his vttermoſt endeuour to further
the building. Some by preaching, ſome
by writing, ſome by gouernment, ſome
by countenance, ſome by coſt, ſome by
counſell, ſome by baſer ſeruices, which
yet are accepted, if they be done with
right affections. Indeed, we are to deſire

more, and the greateſt gifts of all, if we
would haue them: but let vs doe our vttermoſt
endeuour ſo farre as we can and
the Lord will accept it. Earneſt and affectionate
is that ſpeech of a learned Father,
Origen: in Exod. Lord Ieſu grant that I may haue
ſome monument in thy tabernacle: I will
wiſh if it would be, that ſome part of
that gold might come from me, whereof
the propitiatorie is made; or with
which the Arke is couered, or whereof
the candleſticke is made; or if I haue
no golde nor ſiluer, at leaſt I may be
found to offer ſomething that may helpe
forward the pillars and ſockets of them;
or that I may haue ſome braſſe in this
tabernacle, whereof the rings may be
made, and other things preſcribed by
thy word. O that it were poſſible for me
to be one of the Princes, or to offer pretious
ſtones to the adorning of the
Prieſts garment: but becauſe all theſe
are aboue my power, at leaſt let me finde
fauour to offer goates haire in the tabernacle
of God, that I be not found emptie
and vnfruitfull in all.
            A holy, gratious, and deuout ſpeech:
we are all to be of the ſame minde and
affection, to deſire increaſe of graces, but

yet to vſe thoſe well which we haue:
knowing that God will accept them
being rightly vſed: yea he accepteth
the meaneſt gifts, they are as welcome
to him as the greateſt of the richer ſort:
Non omnes poſſum
                     ••
                   eſſe Ceſares, We cannot
be all Caeſars.
               Mat. 25. To ſome the Lord hath giuen
ten talēts, to ſome fiue, to ſome one,
he accepts of the leaſt, being faithfully
vſed &amp; employed,Luk: 21. 1. he accepteth &amp; alloweth
of the two mites of the poore widdow,
caſt into the treaſurie, as well as of
the great &amp; abundant gifts of the richer
ſort. We are to follow this good nature
of God, to take in good part that which
is offered to vs with a louing mind. Thus
ciuil honeſt men, being of good natures,
do take in good part any ſmal thing giuē
them, by thoſe whom they know to be
their friends, and would giue more if
abilitie ſerued. Right Wor: let me entreate
the ſame kindnes and fauour in
accepting theſe few fermons, which are
as two mites into the treaſurie, in reſpect
of the multitude of learned bookes
and ſermons which you daily reade and
heare. I confeſſe, it may ſeeme needles
and ſuperfluous for me, the vnworthieſt
of thouſands, to offer any ſuch thing, to

ſuch a people, as haue ſuch store and abundance,
and plentie of inſtruction.
It may ſeeme I ſay as needleſſe as to caſt
water into the sea. But ſeeing many
more needles things are publiſhed, and
all are (as they may) to further the building
of Gods tabernacle, I pray you pardon
this my bolde attempt. The cauſes
why I preſume to dedicate theſe my
poore labours to you are theſe. Firſt, becauſe
the effect and ſumme of theſe ſermons,
was preached in the preſence and
hearing of many of you, though I confeſſe
I haue made ſince ſome additions
a
                  •
               d amplifications. Againe, becauſe abiding
ſome while amongſt you, I ſound
no litle kindnes and fauour, and I receiued
much ſpirituall comfort and profite
to my ſoule in many publike and priuate
exerciſes amongſt you: which did cauſe
me greatly to affect and loue that place,
and now at laſt by this poore preſent, to
teſtifie my loue and thankfulnes to you.
And I doubt not but the matters handled
in theſe ſermons, will be acceptable
to al good Chriſtians amongſt you. And
how can the doctrine of good gouernment,
be vnpleaſing to that Citie, where

there are ſo many religious, wiſe and
good gouernours? who are carefull to
performe all the parts of their calling:
carefull I ſay, to puniſh offenders, to
countenance the good, to relieue the
oppreſſed, to maintaine and defend, the
Goſpel of Chriſt, the preachers, and profeſſours
of it. And muſt not the commendation
of true wiſedome be acceptable
and delightful, to ſo many friends,
followers, ſonnes &amp; daughters of wiſedome?
There are no doubt amongſt you,
many good and gratious hearers, receiuing
the ſeede of wiſedome in good
ground, vnderſtanding and beleeuing
the word, bringing forth the fruits of it,
ſome thirtie, ſome ſixtie, &amp; ſome an hundred
fold: Many, olde, young, rich,
poore, men, women, and children, Maiſters
and Dames, ſeruants profeſſing and
louing the Goſpell, and greatly reioycing
in it. Many ſeeking and ſearching
for true wiſedome, from the true fountaine,
being carefull to aske, to enquire
for reſolution and ſatisfaction from the
mouth of God. Many reuerencing and
louing all faithfull teachers; ſtirring vp &amp;
prouoking others to doe the like, repoſing

their chiefe felicitie in heauenly
wiſedome, deſiring, thirſting, hungring
after it, as the true foode of their ſoule;
watching daily at the gates, and giuing
attēdance at the poſtes of the doores of
wiſdome, ſparing neither for paines nor
coſt to enioy it, hating all errours, falſehood,
folly, and ſtriuing for the maintenance
of the truth, &amp; reſolued to hazard
goods, and life, for the defence of the
Goſpell. Many like Mar; chooſing the
good part which ſhall neuer be taken
from them. Many like Lydia, whoſe
hearts the Lord hath opened to giu
                  •
                attendance
to Pauls preaching. Many like
Eunice, and Lois the Grandmother and
mother of Timothi
                     •
                  , hauing a care with
them to bring vp their children in the
true faith. All ſuch hearers, as I doubt
not there are many ſuch among you,
muſt needs be glad to heare their Miſtreſſe,
their Ladie, their Princes, their
mother, ſo highly commended &amp; magnified.
And will not this ſtorie of ſo worthie
a Queene, comfort and encourage
all that are readie with her to beſtow
paines and coſt, for the attaining the
ſame wiſedome, eſteeming it more

pretious then all things elſe in, the
world? Giue me leaue therefore (right
worthie Citizens) to comforte and
ſet you on in the pathes of wiſdome,
wherein many of you haue alreadie a
long time moſt gratiouſlie and profitably
walked. As for any further inſtructions
and admonitions, I referre you to
the Sermons following. I now end,
praying heartily for you all, with the Apoſtle;
Rom. 15. 5. That the God of patience and
conſolation would giue you, that yee be
like minded one towards another, according
to Chriſt Ieſus; that you with
one minde and with one mouth, may
praiſe euen the father of our Lord Ieſus
Chriſt;Phil. 1. 9. 10. that your loue may abound yet
more and more, in knowledge, and in all
iudgement, that you may diſcerne
things t
                  •
               at differ one from another; that
ye may be pure and without offence, vntill
the day of Chriſt;1. Coloſſ. 1. 10. that ye may walke
worthie of the Lord, and pleaſe him in
all things, being fruitfull in all good
workes.
            And the very God of peace ſanctifie
you throughout:1. Theſ. 5. 23. 24. And I pray God
that your whole ſpirit, ſoule and bodie,

may be kept blameleſſe to the comming
of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. Faithful is he
which calleth you, which will alſo doe
it. Brethren pray for vs.

            THE FIRST
SERMON.
            
               1. Kings. 10. 8. 9.
               
                  8. Happie are thy men, happie are theſe thy ſervants,
which ſtand euer before thee, and
heare thy wiſedome.
                  9. Bleſſed be the Lord thy God, which loued
thee, to ſet thee on the throne of Iſrael, becauſe
the Lord loued Iſrael for euer, and
made thee King, to doe equitie and righteouſnes.
               
            
            
               THe whole ſcripture ſaith
the Apoſtle is giuen by inſpiration
of God,2. Tim. 3. 16. and is
profitable to teach, to improue,
to correct, to inſtruct
in righteouſnes, that
the man of God may be abſolute, being
made perfect vnto euery good worke: As
all and euery ſcripture ſerueth for theſe
holie vſes, ſo eſpecially theſe bookes of

the hiſtorie and Chronicles of the Kings of
Iuda and Ieruſalem. For here are not onely
many examples of vice, and vertue, but
here is deſcribed the true knowledge and
worſhip of God, the confutation of Idolitrie
and falſe worſhip, the true forme and
patterne of all reformation of diſorders.
The dutie and bleſſing of good Kings, the
ruine of the wicked, the eſtate of the
Church, the care and protection of God
for it. Here we are taught, that God is the
chiefe Monarch, the diſpoſer, the chiefe
gouernor of kingdomes, that the happines
of Kings conſiſteth in maintaining true religion
and Iuſtice; that impietie in religion
and falſe worſhip, is the ouerthrowe of
kingdomes, and as the whole ſtorie is of
great vſe and inſtruction to the Church:
ſo eſpecially the Chronicle of Dauid the
father, and Salomon the ſonne, they being
the firſt Kings that God gaue to Iſrael next
to Saul: yea indeed the firſt that God gaue
his people in loue, men qualified with extraordinarie
graces, the one a Prophet, the
other a Preacher, both of them tipes and
figures of Chriſt Ieſus, the true Dauid and
Salomon.
            
            Their ſtorie is large and long, as you
may reade in the two bookes of Samuel,
               
and a great part of the firſt booke of the
Kings, and further in the firſt booke of the
Chronicles: and the nine firſt Chapters of
the ſecond booke. Touching Salomon, in
thoſe bookes, there is ſet downe the fauour
of God towards him, in appearing familiarly
twiſe vnto him, the ſingular bleſſings
of wiſedome, honor and riches, beſtowed
vpon him, the care of Salomon in
building the Temple, Gods houſe, according
to his minde, his ioy, praiſe and ſacrifices
for the ſame: now this chapter in hand
containeth two generall heads. Firſt a profitable
and pleaſant ſtorie of the Queene
of the ſouth. Secondly, the magnificence
and greatnes of Salomon.
            
            This text is a branch of the firſt part,
and containeth a worthie commendation
of Salomon: Firſt commending the happie
gouernment of his familie: ſecondly, of his
whole kingdome: whatſoeuer is in theſe
two ſhort ſentences of ſcripture, all is worthie
and excellent, and of great force to
drawe reuerence and attention, whether
we conſider the perſon that ſpeaketh, the
partie to whom it is ſpoken, or the matter
and ſubiect it ſelfe: the ſpeaker no ſimple
nor baſe perſon, though the weaker veſſell
a woman, yet of great eſtate and maieſtie,

                  〈1 page duplicate〉
               
               
               
                  〈1 page duplicate〉
               
               
               
a famous, Royall Queene: the perſon to
whom this is ſpoken, is no leſſe a man then
Salomon, a moſt worthie and glorious King
of Iſrael, beloued and choſen of God, excelling
all the Kings of the earth in riches,
honor, and wiſedome. A liuely tipe and
figure of Chriſt Ieſus the ſonne of God, the
King of all Kings, and Lord of heauen and
earth. The matter and ſubiect here handled
and commended, is neither riches nor
pleaſure, nor the pompe, nor the glorie of
the world, but wiſedome, diuine wiſedome,
which ſhe ſaw and heard in Salomon,
and for the enioying whereof, ſhe tooke
ſo tedious, ſo long, and coſtly a iourney,
after her conference with Salomon, and after
ſhe heard him ſpeake ſo diuinely to her
ſelfe, and other ſtrangers, to his courtiers,
ſeruants and people, her heart being inamoured
with loue of this wiſedome, and
feeling the power and vertue of it, working
in her ſoule, ſhe crieth and exclaimeth,
Happie are theſe thy men, happie are
theſe thy ſeruants, which ſtand euer before
thee, and heare thy wiſedome, &amp;c.
            Before we come to this ſpeech it ſelfe, it
ſhall not be amiſſe to ſay ſome thing of the
ſpeaker, a woman, a Queene of excellent
vertues; the whole ſpeech it ſelfe commends

her, for here ſhe ſpeaketh reuerently
of Salomon, commending and magnifying
his wiſedome; ſhe confeſſeth and worſhippeth
the true God; ſhe acknowledgeth
him to be the diſpoſer of kingdomes, and
Iſrael to be his people: ſhe putteth Salomon
in minde of the dutie of a King. She is a
tipe of the calling of the Gentiles, and finally,
ſhe is commended by Chriſt himſelfe
in the Goſpell, as we ſhall ſee hereafter.
            And though all the world, and all the
Kings of the earth, ſought to ſee Salomon
and to heare his wiſedome, yet this woman
is eſpecially named, &amp; commended,
and a whole ſtorie is written of her, becauſe
it was a great matter, and almoſt a
wonder, that a woman ſhould take ſo
great, ſo troubleſome and tedious a iourney,
and it ſeemeth her zeale, and pietie
exceeded all the reſt. In the beginning of
this chapter, it is ſet downe whence ſhe
came, namely from Sheba▪
                being as Chriſt
ſaith, from the vttermoſt part of the earth:
that the fame of Salomon moued her to
come, that ſhe came with a great traine,
and brought with her ſweet odours, gold
and precious ſtones: the end of her comming
was, to proue Salomō
                with hard queſtions
in matters of religion: and as ſhe ſpared

neither paines nor coſt, but cheerfully
tooke vpon her ſo great a iourney: ſo when
ſhe is come, ſhe is carefull to learne and
enquire, of the true knowledge of God, to
be ſatiſfied and reſolued concerning all
points ſhe ſtood in doubt of: ſhe confeſſeth
her ignorance, and neglecteth no occaſion
to doe her ſoule good. And now after
Salomon had anſwered all things to the
full; ſhe highly commends him, ſhe ſtirreth
vp his courtiers, ſubiects and ſeruants to
be thankfull for ſuch a Maiſter, Lord and
King: ſhe reioyceth, praiſing God for him:
and after in token of thankfulnes, ſhe beſtoweth
vpon him, gold, odors, and precious
ſtones: ſhe could not then perfectly
learne true religion in her owne countrie,
Ieruſalem was the ſeate and ſchoole of religion,
the ſcripture not being then in all
tongues, as it was after in the time of the
Apoſtles, therefore ſhe commeth ſo farre
to learne true wiſedome, both for her priuate
comfort, and the publike good of her
people: and now hauing found, felt and inioyed
it, ſhe both bleſſeth God the Author
and Salomon the teacher. In this example,
we are to obſerue diuers worthie notes
and markes of gracious and good hearers:
Firſt, in that ſhe ſeekes for wiſedome, and

ſuch things as concerne the name of the
Lord, and that from Salomon, who was ſo
wiſe in ſo great a meaſure. Good hearers
muſt follow her example, not to ſeeke for
follie or fables, but for true wiſedome, and
that from the true Salomon Chriſt Ieſus in
his word and Goſpell: For the ſcriptures
onely as the Apoſtle ſaith,2. Tim. 3. 15. 16. are able to make
vs wiſe vnto ſaluation. And the Pſalmiſt
ſaith,Pſalme. 19. 7. 
               The lawe of the Lord is perfect, conuerting
ſoules, and giueth wiſedome to the ſimple.
Salomon himſelfe giues this counſell, Incline
thine eare, heare the words of the wiſe, and applie
thine heart to my knowledge. Secondly,
good hearers after this worthie patterne,Pro: 22. 17.
muſt refuſe no paines, nor labor for the attaining
of this wiſedome: The wiſe man
will haue vs call, and crie for it, to ſeeke it
as ſiluer, and ſearch for it, as for treaſures.
And againe, buy the truth, but ſell it not:
likewiſe wiſedome, and inſtruction, and
vnderſtanding, when Chriſt was borne at
Bethlem in Iudea,
               Pro: 23. 23. there came certaine wiſe
men from the Eaſt to Ieruſalem, to ſeeke
for him;Mat. 2. 1. this woman and they in many
things are much alike, they were ſome
great men, ſhe a Queene, they came to Ieruſalem,
ſo did ſhe: they came to ſeeke
Chriſt, ſhe came to Salomon the figure of

Chriſt: they enquire of the Prieſts to be ſatiſfied
where Chriſt ſhould be borne: ſhe
ſeeketh to be ſatiſfied of her doubts, from
S
                     •
                  lomon a preacher: they ſeeing the ſtarre
leading them to Chriſt reioyced, ſhe hauing
comfort and knowledge from Salomon
reioyceth alſo: they offer gold, Incenſe
and Myrrhe to Chriſt, ſhe offereth and giueth
to Salomon precious things: they were
a figure of the calling of the Gentiles, ſo
was ſhe a tipe of the ſame long before: they
came a great iourney from the Eaſt, to
ſeeke for Chriſt, ſhe came from the South,
a great and dangerous voyage to heare
and enioy the wiſedome of Salomon.
               Luke. 8. 2. 
               Marie
Magdalen, Ioanna the wife of Cuſa, Herod
his ſteward,Act. 8. 27 with many others follow our
Sauiour Chriſt to heare his ſermons, the
Eunuch the treaſurer of Ethiopia, came to
Ieruſalem to worſhip God. It is lawful then
to ſeeke for inſtruction abroad, if we lacke
it at home: Merchants venter vpon the
ſeas to farre countries for trafficke, many
goe to the Indies for gold.
            Such as lacke prouiſion at home, goe to
markets and faires for it: if our cattle want
foode or water, we will ſeeke farre and
neere for them: how farre doe men runne,
what paines do they take for humane learning,

how carefull are they to get mony,
how painefull to finde it, if they looſe it?
many flie to Rome and Rhemes, not for
wiſdome, but for fooliſhnes; not for truth,
but for errors; not for foode, but for poyſon:
many trudge many a mile on pilgrimage,
to worſhip Idols, ſtockes &amp; ſtones,
yea ſome to ioyne with the enemies, to
worke treaſon againſt their lawful Prince:
this example will not ſerue their turne;
There is a lawfull peregrination to viſit
good men, to conferre, to learne artes,
tongues, religion: the Iewes were commanded
to goe to Ieruſalem ſundrie times
in the yeare,Deut. 16. but it was about the true
worſhip of God.1, Sam. 1. 3. 
               Elkanah the Prieſt, went
euery yeare to worſhip and ſacrifice to the
Lord of hoaſts in Shilo.
               Gal: 1. 18. S. Paul went to Ieruſalem
to viſit Peter, and to conferre with
him, the popiſh peregrinations are vnlawfull,
they make it a principall part of Gods
ſeruice: there is no commandement for
them, they viſit dead mens bones, Images,
and reliques. This ſuperſtition, as many
other, was inuented many yeares after
Chriſt: others trauell and take vpon them
great and dangerous iournies to the hurt
of bodie and ſoule.
            But the paines and trauell of this woman

                  〈1 page duplicate〉
               
               
               
                  〈1 page duplicate〉
               
               
               
is to learne diuine wiſedome: teaching
vs to refuſe no paines in ſeeking for
the meanes of our ſaluation, but to labour
with all care and diligence, for the
profite, the comfort, and the good of our
ſoules.
            Thirdly, a good hearer muſt bee inquiſitiue
and carefull to learne. This woman
(a Queene) is not ashamed to confeſſe
her ignorance, to aske queſtions, and to
bee taught. The wiſe man ſaith, Hear
                     •
                   ô
yee children,
               Prou. 4. 1. 
               the inſtruction of a Father, &amp; giue
eare to learne vnderſtanding. The Apoſtle
complaines of ſome women that were euer
learning,2. Tim. 3. 7. but were neuer able to come
to the knowledge of the truth: There are
many hearers; but fewe learners. The care
of this woman, is not onely ſeene by her
coſt, and labour in comming, but by opening
her heart, and mouing doubtes:
asking queſtions, conference, and reaſoning
with good men, are gratious meanes
to further vs in the true knowledge of God.
            The people muſt looke for the Law:
of God at the Prieſts mouth: The Apoſtles
aske of Chriſt their maiſter,Mal. 2. 7. the interpretation
and meaning of harde parables:Math. 17. 36.
The Corinthiās write to S. Paul, to be reſolued
in certaine doubts.1. Cor. 7. And heere by

the way, obſerue two notes of a good teacher
in Salomon; they muſt be able and apt
to teach: ſecondly, readie and willing,
not nice, ſtrange, and ſtately.
            The graces of God are giuen for the
good of others: the ende and vſe of the
miniſtrie, is to inſtruct and reſolue doubts.
But manie in the Church, are vnable to
teach; others are vnwilling; &amp; others both
vnable and vnwilling: theſe are all confuted
by Salomons example, who both abounded
in wiſdome, and was willing to impart
it to others. He was as readie to anſwere,
as this woman was to aske: hee was as readie
to teach, as shee was to learne.
            Fourthly, after her hearing and learning,
she comends her teacher highly, and
ſpeaketh reuerently of him; So muſt good
hearers, haue a reuerent eſtimation of ſuch
as inſtruct them from the mouth of God.
            
               Dauid receiuing good counſell from
Abigail,
               1. Sam. 25 32. bleſſeth both her and her counſell:
The woman in the Goſpell, hearing the
gratious words that proceeded out of the
mouth of Chriſt,Lu. 11. 27. cried out; Bleſſed is the
Wombe that bare thee, and the pappes that gaue
thee ſucke.
            
            The holie Apoſtle Saint Paule commends
the Galathians for this cauſe,Cal. 4. 14. that

they eſteemed him as an Angell of God,
yea euen as Chriſt Ieſus. In an other place,
Wee beſeech you brethren, that yee knowe them
that labour among you and are ouer you in the
Lord, and adm
                     •
                  niſh you that you haue them

                     〈◊〉
                   ſingular loue for their workes ſake: And whē
you feele the power and fruit of their miniſtrie,
ſay with this woman, Bleſſed be
God, bleſſed be ſuch men, bleſſed be ſuch
ſeruants, which haue called me, comforted
and ſtrengthned me, happie are thoſe people
which may daily heare ſuch wiſedome.
            Fiftly, ſhe acknowledgeth the chiefe felicitie
of this life, not to conſiſt in riches,
honor, pleaſure, but in wiſedome. So good
hearers ought to eſteeme it, the greateſt
happines vnder heauen, to haue a reſident
and teaching miniſter, expounding and
applying to them, the wiſedome of the
true Salomō Chrſt Ieſus. But of this point
I meane to ſpeake more largely and fully
after.
            Sixtly, ſhe ſtirreth vp Salomons Courtiers
and ſeruants, to know this their happie
eſtate, it may be ſome of them ſcarcely acknowledged
any ſuch thing, as many careleſſe
and vnthankfull people in our daies,
hauing good paſtors, yet neither feele nor
confeſſe any bleſſing at all: ſtrangers can

ſay, happie are ſuch a people, though they
themſelues knowe no ſuch thing: good
hearers muſt by this example, not onely
heare the word of wiſedome, and highly
eſteeme it themſelues, but ſtirre vp others
to the like affectiō towards it: they would
haue others partakers of the ſame graces
with them, and indeed if they find it a bleſſing
and comfort to themſelues, they will
imparte it to others, and labour to make
others partakers of the ſame cōforts with
them.Eſai. 2. 3. 
               Eſaiah prophecieth, that ſuch ſhal be
the zeale of the people vnder the Goſpell,
that they ſhall ſay one to another, Come, let

houſe of the God of Iacob, he will teach vs his
waies, and we will walke in his

in hauing ſo wiſe a gouerner and teacher.
            Seuenthly, ſhe reioyceth and bleſſeth

dutie of good hearers, as to be thankefull
to the men and meanes of their conuerſion,
ſo much more to God, the author and
giuer of all good: as Dauid bleſſed Ab

in his ſpirit, and giueth thankes to
his heauenly Father for the good ſucceſſe
of the Goſpell:Luke. 10. 21. when Phillip preached in
Samaria,
               Act. 8. 8. with great power &amp; profit, there
was great ioy in that Citie:1. Cor. 14. 25. the Infidel being

            Eightly, good hearers after this royall
example, are to be bountifull and thankefull
to their teachers, ſhe giues vnto Salomon
abundance of gold, ſweet odours exceeding
much: as you may ſee in the next
verſe following this our text. It may be
ſome will ſay, that Salomo
                     •
                  
                had no need of
ſuch gifts, hauing ſuch abundance of
wealth and riches: It is true, yet he doth
accept it, and requiteth her kindnes, with
precious preſents, and gaue her whatſoeuer
ſhe asked; ſo that ſhe went home richer
then ſhe came, richer I am ſure in
grace, and diuine wiſedome, yet in giuing
Salomon ſuch precious gifts, ſhe ſhewed
her thankefulnes, thinking nothing too
deare for ſuch a teacher.
            And though the miniſters be not able
to requite the kindneſſes and liberalities
of men, yet God is able to doe it, and he
hath promiſed to bleſſe and reward all true
friends and benefactors to his ſeruants.Pro 3. 9.
And yet the people muſt knowe,Mat. 
                     〈◊〉
                  . 41. 42. that they
receiue from good miniſters, more gaine
and profit,Mat. 25. 35. then they doe from them: the
miniſters they offer and deliuer heauenly
miſteries,2. Tim. 1. 16. the Iewells and treaſures of the
word, the ſpirituall foode of the ſoule:

which is more precious then thouſands of
gold and ſiluer, they receiue from the people
onely earthly and outward maintenance,
prouiſion and ſubſtance, for this
bodie and life: and therefore the people
haue no cauſe to grudge the maintenance
of good miniſters, ſeeing if they make their
accounts aright, the gaine is theirs. The
Apoſtle ſaith,1. Tim. 5. 17. 
               Such as labour in word and doctrine,
are worthie of double honor;
               Gal: 6. 6. That is, of
reuerence and munificence. And againe,
Let him that is taught in the word, make him
that hath taught him partaker of all his goods:
they that ſowe ſpirituall things, are worthie to
reape temporall things. And the Lord hath ordained,
that they that preach the Goſpell
ſhould liue of the Goſpell: It is the law of
nature, equitie and thankfulnes, that ſuch
ſhould be maintained, being ſpirituall paſtors,
fathers and ſouldiers, and ſpending
themſelues as a candle for the common
good.

            And thus you may plainly ſee in this
worthie example, eight notes and markes
of good hearers; Some before this Texte,
ſome in this text, and ſome after: and theſe
notes doe containe and comprehend the
whole ſtorie of this worthie Queene. And
now becauſe this whole text is a praiſe and
commendation of Salomon, let vs learne
from hence, that vertue and wiſedome is to
be commended,Pro. 12. 8. in whom ſoeuer we finde
it. A man (ſaith Salomon
                     •
                  ) shalbe commended
for his wiſedome: and not only great
perſonages, but the pooreſt are to be commended
for vertue: Better is a poore &amp; niſe
childe (ſaith Salomon) then an olde and fooliſh
King,
               Ecc. 4. 13. 
               which will no more be admoniſhed. And
againe, Better is Wiſedome then ſtrength:
Yet the wiſedome of the poore is deſpiſed.
And in an other place, Better is the poore
that walketh in his vprightnes,
               Ecc. 9. 16. 
               then he that peruerteth
his wayes, though hee be rich.
            
            Saint Iames reprooueth this parcialitie
in men, who eſteeme highlie, and
magnifie rich men, bee they neuer ſo wicked,
and deſpiſe poore men: ſuch as are
choſen of God, rich in Faith, and heyre
                  •
               
               
of the Kingdome. Thoſe that honor mee ſhall
be honoured,
               1. Sam. 2. 30. (ſaith the Lorde,) and thoſe that
deſpiſe mee ſhall be despiſed; God himſelfe
commendeth and praiſeth ſuch. He ſaith
of Iob that he was an vpright and iuſt man:
one that feared GOD,Iob. 1. 1. and eſchued euill.
            Chriſt commendeth Iohn the Baptiſt, ſaying;
There was not a greater Prophet amongſt
womens children.
               Math. 11. 
               Zacharie the Prieſt, and
his wife Elizabeth, are ſaid both by the holie
Ghoſt to bee iuſt before God,Luke. 1. 6. and to
walke in all the commandements of God,
without reproofe. And Simeon is ſaide to
bee a iuſt man, fearing God, and wayting
for the conſolation of Iſrael. And Chriſt,
writing to the ſeuen Churches, Though
hee hath ſomething againſt moſt of them,
worthie of blame and reproofe, yet hee
commendeth anie good thing in them:
Yea, he eſpecially commendeth the church
of Smyrna▪
                though in perſecution and pouertie,
accounting it rich in grace, and ſpirituall
treaſures: So that it is lawfull, and
it is our dutie to commend and praiſe vertue
and goodnes in anie: the behauiour of
good men is ſuch as deſerueth &amp; draweth
loue and praiſe: And this doth incourage
them to go forward in goodnes, and doth
prouoke others to follow their example, as

the ſhadow doth follow the bodie, ſo Honor
and praiſe doth follow vertue: ſometime
the wicked doe praiſe their vertues,
and are forced to commend them, and
though they doe it not, yet righteous men
commonly will praiſe them, and the more
godly &amp; wiſe that men are, the more praiſe
they deſerue: and we muſt take heed that
our praiſe be moderate, iuſt, and without
flatterie, &amp; aboue all things, we muſt take
heed that we praiſe not without cauſe and
deſert, that we neuer iuſtifie, nor commēd
the wicked, remembring that there is a
fearefull woe pronounced againſt them,
that ſpeake good of euill,Eſai: 5. 20. &amp; euill of good.
The vſe of this doctrine is for the reproofe
of many,Vſe. as of thoſe that are ſo blind and
ſenſeles, that they cannot ſee, and diſcerne
the grace of God in men: others are ſo
dumbe and vnthankfull, that though they
be partakers of many graces from others,
which they muſt needs ſee and confeſſe,
yet they ſilent and neuer ſpeake once a
good word of them: others are malitious,
and doe daily carpe, depraue, diſgrace and
diminiſh as much as they can, the gifts of
God in his ſeruants. Againe, this reprooueth
thoſe which hunt for glorie &amp; praiſe,
this they greatly ſeeke for and deſire,

            The praiſes or diſpraiſes of men are little
to be regarded; they account ſome iuſt, holie,
vertuous, honeſt, which are nothing ſo;
what are theſe men the better for the flattering
ſpeeches of men, when God &amp; their
owne conſciences can tell them, that they
are no ſuch kind of men at all? but indeed
prophane, vniuſt, vile, and naught. Some againe
are accounted in the mouths of men,
as wicked, and notorious hypocrites, what
neede they care for theſe ſpeeches, when
God and their owne conſcience doth witnes
that they are ſincere in hart, deſiring to
liue honeſtly and vprightly in the ſight of
God and men. The teſtimonie of a good
conſcience, is a ſufficient bulwark againſt
all falſe reports and ſlanders whatſoeuer:
but the common miſchiefe and poyſon amongſt
men, is the pleaſing ſpeeches of
flatterers and clawbacks, which doth feed

them in their humours, and magnifie them
to the skies, when there is litle or no cauſe
at all: Nay, when rather they are to be blamed
and diſpraiſed. There be two kindes
of perſecutors ſaith one, firſt, of ſuch as doe
diſpraiſe vs, and ſecondly, of ſuch as doe
praiſe vs: but the tongue of the flatterer
doth more hurt, and perſecute vs, then the
hand of a perſecutor: I had rather to be reproued
of any, then to be praiſed of a flatterer:
no reproofe is to be feared of him
that loueth the truth, but he that flatteringly
praiſeth,Pro: 28. 23. doth erre, and confirmeth
vs in error. Therefore true is that ſaying of
Salomon he that rebuketh a man ſhall finde
more fauour at the lēgth, then he that flattereth
with his tongue.
            And the wounds of a friend are better
then the kiſſes of a flatterer. Therefore
ſaith Dauid,
               Pſal. 141. 5. Let the righteous ſmite me for
that is a benefit, and let them reproue me,
and it ſhall be as a precious oyle, that ſhall
not breake my head. The deſire of praiſe
doth hinder zeale in religion, and conſtancie
in the profeſſion of Chriſt.Iohn. 5. 44. How can ye
beleeue ſaith our Sauiour, which receiue
honor one of another, and ſeeketh not the
honor that cōmeth of God alone. And in
another place it is ſaid, that many of the

chiefe rulers beleeued in Chriſt, but becauſe
of the Phariſes they did not confeſſe
him, leaſt they ſhuld be caſt out of the Synagogue,
Iohn. 12. 42. 43. for they loued the praiſe of men,
more then the praiſe of God; It is almoſt
an vniuerſall vanitie, to be deſirous to be
praiſed when we deſerue it not, and not to
praiſe thoſe who are worthie of praiſe: and
this is a vaine thing, that through our ignorance
oftentimes, that is concealed
which is, and that is publiſhed which is

is praiſed in the deſires of his ſoule, yet he
is to be praiſed who can truely ſay, I liue
not, but Chriſt liueth in me, and ſo not he
but the life of Chriſt is praiſed, the gifts
and graces of God whereſoeuer we finde
them, are to be reuerenced, honoured, and
magnified, with praiſe and ioy.
            And let the beſt take heed that they be
not deſirous of vaine-glorie. It is lawfull to

receiue due praiſe when it is offered, and
we are not vtterly to renounce and forbid
it: good men are not ignorant of the goodnes
that is in them, and therefore they
reioyce, that God hath giuen vnto men
ſuch good affections, to like ſo well of
thoſe good things which they praiſe in others,
and it is the gift of God to allowe
and approue of his graces, and to forbid
ſuch kinde of commendations, is not to
will nor deſire, that the faithfull ſhould
praiſe and approue thoſe things which are
worthie of due praiſe and approbation.
Salomon in this place, doth not refuſe, but
accept the iuſt commendation of this woman,
though it be of himſelfe in his owne
preſence, and in the hearing of many other,
and yet we muſt beware that wee
be not moued to doe well, for the deſire
of praiſe, and that we ceaſe not from doing
good, though wee be reuiled, and
hardly ſpoken of, and thoſe praiſes which
are giuen to vs, let them not reſt nor die
in vs, but let the glorie of them be referred
to God, the author, and giuer, of all
good gifts.
            A worthie Father writeth of himſelfe,
that in this reſpect he had cauſe to be
much grieued, becauſe he was oftē praiſed

and hee could hardly auoyde the pride of
heart: yet hee ſaith, that this was his comfort,
that it was appointed of God, that
praiſe should bee the follower of a good
life:Pro. 27. 2. And howſoeuer Salomon ſaith, Let an
other man praiſe thee, and not thine owne mouth,
a ſtranger, and not thine owne lippes: yet ſometimes
the Saints of God are forced to praiſe
themſelues, not for vain-glorie, but for the
glorie of God, the confirmation of others,
and for the ſtopping of the mouthes of the
aduerſaries.
            It is a worthy ſaying of the ſame Father,
Beholde (ſaith hee,)Auguſt. in Pſalm. 144▪
                it is found how thou
mighteſt praiſe thy ſelfe, and not be proud,
praiſe God in thee, and not thy ſelfe; praiſe
him, not becauſe thou art ſuch a one, but
becauſe hee hath made thee ſuch a one:
not becauſe thou canſt doe anie thing, but
becauſe he can doe ſomething in thee, and
by thee.
            Finally, this doctrine ſerueth for the
comfort of vertuous and good men, who
haue ſmall comfort and commendation in
the world, but rather diſpraiſe and diſcomfort,
they are diſgraced and deſpiſed of the
moſt: let them take this as ſome croſſe vpon
them: and howſoeuer they haue not deſerued
it of the world, yet it may bee God

hath ſomething againſt them: and it may
bee if they had the praiſe of all men, it
would make them proud and high conceited;
and God depriueth them of earthlie
glory, that they might more carefully ſeeke
heauenly and Eternall glorie. As for the
praiſe of men, it is but like a feather, toſ
                  •
               ed
vp and downe by the wind, hither and thither,
and therefore not to be regarded nor
hunted after: Let vs content our ſelues with
the teſtimonie of a good conſcience, the
praiſe of good men, and ſpecially, and moſt
of all,Pſ. 8
                     •
                  . 11. with the approbation and praiſe of
God: For the Lord God is the Sunne and
ſhield vnto vs, the Lorde will giue grace
and glorie, &amp; no good thing will he withhold
from them that walke vprightly: the
full accomplishment of theſe promiſes, and
the like, shalbe in the great and latter day:
the day of praiſe and reward, and a full recompence
to euery man, according to his
works, when God shall bee glorified in his
Saints, and be made maruellous in all them
that beleeue: then thoſe which by continuance
in wel doing, haue ſought glorie, ſhall
certainely haue honour, immortalitie, and
eternall life. In the meane time wee muſt
remember that God hath the diſpoſing of
all to 
                  •
               gues &amp; hearts, and he can make our

Righteouſnes and Innocencie to shine as
the light, euen in this life, to the ſhame of
the enemie, and to our comfort and credit.
But to let this paſſe, and to come to the
maine point, &amp; chiefe doctrine of this ſentence,
which was the fift note obſerued of
a good hearer, to repoſe true felicitie and
happines in true wiſedome: This I meane
to vrge, fully, and largely, becauſe it is expreſſely
ſet downe in the text, and comprehendeth
all the reſt. For they which thus
eſteeme of it, will refuſe no paines to learne
and enioy it; will reuerence the teachers;
will be thankefull to God and them; For
the cauſe why few men doe deſire this wiſedome,
but are idle, careles, and vnwilling
to learne, the cauſe why fewe reuerence
their faithfull paſtors, few moue and ſtirre
vp any other to goodnes. Fewe reioyce in
the meanes of ſaluation, and praiſe God for
it, but rather loath &amp; contemne it, the cauſe
(I ſay) why moſt hearers are profane, careles,
churlish, froward, couetous, vnthankfull,
and vnprofitable: the cauſe of all is,
they do
                  •
                not rightly eſteeme of this wiſedome,
they thinke baſely and contemptablie
of it, preferring carnall wiſdome, and
all worldly things aboue it.
            But let this worthie woman, teach them

the true price, worth, &amp; eſtimation of wiſedome:
Shee accounteth them happie that
enioy it; ſhe repoſeth the greateſt felicitie
of this life in it: ſhe might haue ſaid, happie
are you which haue ſo ſumptuous and
beautifull a temple; ſuch a princely pallace,
which was twentie yeares in building, ſurpaſſing
all that euer was, either ſince or
before: ſhee might haue ſaid, Happie are
you which haue ſo glorious and famous a
King, a mirrour &amp; wonder to all the world,
in pompe, wealth, and dignitie: ſhe might
haue ſaide, Happy are you which haue ſuch
Vineyards, Orchyards, gardens like Paradice,
ſuch pleaſures and delights of all ſorts
and kinds: ſhe might haue ſaid, Happie are
you which haue ſuch ſtore of goodly Horſes
and Horſemen, and ſuch abundance of
gold and ſiluer▪ ſo many Targets of beaten
golde, and all drinking veſſels of golde and
ſiluer, being as common as ſtones in the
ſtrectes; but ſhee paſſing all theſe things
as nothing in compariſon, ſhe accounteth
this as the greateſt Happines, to heare and
enioy the wiſdome of Salomon; and in this
her iudgment, ſhe excelleth and ſurpaſſeth
many learned men, both before, &amp; ſince her
time, who haue erred &amp; gone farre aſtray,
touching the chiefe good and Felicitie of

man. About that queſtion of the finall
good, the Philoſophers haue kept a wonderfull
coyle among themſelues, ſeeking in
euery cranke and cauerne thereof, for the
true beatitude, for that is the finall good,
being onely deſired for it ſelfe, all their
goods hauing in their attainements, a reference
out of that alone: we doe not call
that the finall good, which endeth goodnes,
that is, which maketh it nothing: but
that which profiteth it,De ciuit: dei. lib. 19. cap: 1. which giueth it fulnes
of perfection. Thus Auguſtine defineth
the finall good, the ſame father, reiecting,
confuting, the varietie, multiplicitie, of
vaine opinions, by many Sects of the Philoſophers▪
               Cap: 4. he ſetteth downe the Chriſtians
opinion of the chiefeſt good. If you aske vs
now ſaith he, what the Citie of God ſaith
to this poſition of the perfection of good
and euill, It will anſwere you preſently, eternall
life is the perfection of good, and eternall
death the conſummation of euill.
And that the ayme of all our life muſt be to
auoyd this, and attaine to that other: therefore
it is written, The iuſt ſhal liue by faith,
for we ſee not our greateſt good, and therfore
are to beleeue and hope for it, nor
haue power to liue accordingly, vnleſſe
our beleefe and prayer obtaine helpe of

him, who hath giuen vs that beleefe and
hope that he will helpe vs: but ſuch as Foūd
the perfection of felicitie in this life, placing
it either in the bodie or in the minde,
or in both, or to ſpeake more apparantly,
either in pleaſure or in vertue, or in pleaſure
and reſt together, or in vertue, or in
both, or in natures firſt effects; Fondly and
vainely are theſe men perſwaded to find
true happines here. The Prophet ſcoffeth
thē ſaying, The Lord knoweth the thoghts
of men. Or as S. Paul hath it of the wiſe,
that they are vaine. Some of the Philoſophers
haue counted vertue in a perfect life,
ſome in the tranquilitie of the minde, ſome
proſperitie, with vertue, ſome to be without
ſinne, and ſome haue counted it the
beſt happines to die well. Solon being aſked
of Creſſus who excelled all in riches,
whether euer he ſawe a man more happier
thē he. He named one Tellus an Athenian, a
priuate man, who had left his children and
kinſefolke well brought vp and inſtructed,
had happily ended his daies: and being aſked
againe, whō next to him he did thinke
to be happie, he named Cleobin and Bitis,
brethren, men of ſmall eſtate, who were
both dead, and left behinde them a great
name and praiſe of their pietie. The King

being angrie ſaid vnto him, doeſt thou thē
put me in no place of happines? Yes ſaith
Solon I doe eaſily confeſſe that thou art a
King, flouriſhing with wealth and gouernment,
but yet not to be called happie, before
thou doſt happily end thy life. Of all
the Philoſophers Plato and his diſciples
came neereſt to true Chriſtianitie, and in
defining true happines, he determined,
that the end of all good was the attaining
of a vertuous life, which none could doe
but he that knewe and followed God: neither
is any man ſaith he, happier by any other
meanes, and therefore he affirmeth,
that to be a Philoſopher is to loue God,
whoſe nature is incorporiall: the Philoſopher
is then bleſſed when he enioyeth
God, he held God to be the creator of the
world, the light of vnderſtanding, the
good of all actions, the beginning of nature,
the truth of doctrine, the happines of
life, he ſaith it muſt be a wiſe mans continuall
meditation, to follow God and to be
like him, that is, to be iuſt, holy, wiſe. Finally,
he placeth beatitude, true bleſſednes
in the life to come: theſe are diuine and
heauenly points, and therefore he was called
Diuinus Plato. and ſome thinke, that he
had ſeene ſome part of the ſcripture, as Ieremiah

or Geneſes.
            And a man would thinke that he wrote
and ſpake like a Chriſtian, and in the
things aboue named, he and we doe agree,
but yet he was vaine in his imaginations,
and his fooliſh heart was full of darknes,
being ignorant of the true wiſedome, he
held diuers groſe errors, as the worſhipping
of many Gods, the eternitie of the
world, and denied the reſurrection of our
bodies: but this we hold with him, that
there is no true felicitie in this life, but in
another, and therfore it is rightly ſaid, the
true beatitud
                  •
                is vnattaineable in this life,
for none liues as he liſt, but he is happie,
and none is happie but he is iuſt, yet the
iuſt liueth not as he liſt, vntill he attaine
that ſure eternall, hurtleſſe, vndeceiuing
ſtate, that he naturally deſireth, and cannot
be perfect till he haue his deſire, but
what man here vpon earth can ſay hee
liues as he liſt, when his life is not in his
owne hand, he would liue faine, and he
muſt die, how then liueth he as he liſt,
when he liueth not as long as he liſt, but
if he liſt to die how can he liue as he liſt,
that will not liue at all? and if he deſire to
die, not to forgoe all life, but to change it
for a better, thē liueth he not yet as he liſt,

but attaineth that by dying.
            But admit this, he liueth as he liſt, and
brought himſelfe to this, to deſire nothing
but what is in his owne power, as T

all other things are affected for this, and
if this be loued as it ought to be (for he
that loues not beatitude as it ought to

chooſe but be deſired to be eternall.
            Againe, earthly riches can neither bleſſe
vs nor our Children with happines, we
muſt either loſe them in this life, or deeme
them to be enioyed after our death, by
one, we cannot tell whom, perhappes
by thoſe wee would not ſhould haue
them:Lib: 5. 18. no, it is God, the minds true wealth,
that makes vs happie, and this happines
is in the life to come: there ſhall the Creator
beſtowe all the gifts of nature vpon
vs, and giue them not onely as goods,
but as eternall goods, not onely to the
ſoule, by reforming it with wiſedome,

but alſo to the body, by reſtoring it to
the reſurrection, there the vertues ſhall
not haue any more conflicts with the vices,
but ſhall reſt with the victorie of eternall
peace, which none ſhall euer diſturbe,
for it is the finall beatitude, hauing
now attained a conſummation to all eternitie.
We are ſaid to be happie heere on
earth, when we haue that litle peace that
goodnes can affoord vs: but compare that
happines with that other, and this ſhall
be held but plaine miſerie: there is health
without infirmitie, ſtrength without decay,
fulnes without loathing, freedome
without bondage, beautie without deformitie,
abundance without want, ſecuritie
without feare, knowledge without ignorance
or error, holines without ſinne, Ioy
without any ſorrowe: Ioy I ſay, full, vniuerſall,
ſufficient, eternal, what a glory
and Ioy, to haue alwaies the preſence and
ſight of God, whoſe beautie the Angels
doe wonder at, whoſe light darkeneth
the Sunne?
            Oh bleſſed ſight to ſee God, to ſee him
in himſelfe, to ſee him in vs, and vs in
him.
            Oh happie ſweetnes, and ſweete happines,
whatſoeuer we deſire we haue it, deſiring

no more at all, and whatſoeuer we
ſhall haue, we ſhall loue, with a bleſſed
loue: all things to be deſired are to be
found in him, his countenance ſweete and
amiable, he is ſufficient for reward, we
ſhall alwaies behold him, haue and enioy
him, delight in him. This is the whole
good and felicitie of man, to knowe and
loue him, that loued him: what doſt thou
loue, oh my ſoule? what deſireſt thou, oh
my fleſh? whatſoeuer thou loueſt or deſireſt
there it is: If thou loueſt and deſireſt
beautie, there the righteous ſhall ſhine as
the Sunne, is the kingdome of the Father:
If thou deſire health, and life, there it is for
euer: If wiſedome, there is wiſedome it
ſelfe: If true loue, then we ſhall loue God
more then our ſelues, and one another as
our ſelues. If thou loueſt companie, there
is the beſt, all thy good friends and kindred,
the bleſſed Saints, Martyrs, and Angels:
If thou deſireſt honor and glorie,
there we ſhall be as the Angels of God,
our bodies ſhall be like the glorious bodie
of Chriſt, and this mortalitie ſhall put
on immortalitie: If thou deſireſt riches,
there is an heritage and kingdome, that
neuer fadeth away: If thou loueſt mirth,
muſicke and melodie, there is a conſort

of Angels, ſinging Alleluia, glory, honor,
and praiſe be to the Lambe for euer: If
thou wouldeſt haue certaintie, ſafetie, and
ſecuritie, there we are ſure to looſe none
of theſe things, no enemie can aſſault vs,
no enemie can hurt vs: the Citie of God
ſaith a Father is eternall, no man is borne
in it, becauſe no man dieth in it, felicitie is
there fullie, yet no goddeſſe, but a Gods
gift, of this habitation haue we a promiſe
by faith.
            As long as wee are here in this pilgrimage

2. Cor. 5. 1. 2. wee haue a building giuen of
God, that is a houſe not made with hands,
but eternall in the heauens: therefore we
ſigh, deſiring to be cloathed with our

            What a deſire had Dauid to ſeeke
and ſerue God in the Temple, in the
aſſemblie of Gods Saints on earth, ſaying,
As the Hart bayeth for the riuers
of waters, ſo panteth my ſoule after thee
ô God, my ſoule thirſteth for God, euen
for the liuing God, when ſhall I
come and appeare before the preſence
of God. And againe, O Lord of hoſtes,Pſal: 84. 1. 2. 4. 10. my
ſoule longeth, yea and fainteth for the
Courts of the Lord, my heart and fleſh
reioyceth in the liuing God, bleſſed

are they that dwell in thy houſe, they
will euer praiſe thee, a day in thy courtes
is better then a thouſand other where: I
had rather be a doore keeper in the houſe
of my God, then to dwell in the tabernacles
of wickednes. If Dauid had ſuch
a deſire, ſuch loue, ſuch zeale, ſuch longing
to the tabernacle, to the company
of Gods people in the publike aſſemblies
on earth, how much more ſhould our affections
be ſet, and fixed vpon the heauenly
tabernacle?
            O Lord ſaith Dauid, How manifold are
thy workes? in wiſedome haſt thou made
them all, the earth is full of thy riches:
he confeſſeth the abundance of Gods mercies
in this world, in his workes of creation,
prouidence, and preſeruation of all
mankinde, and yet if all the world be ſo
full of his mercies, his Church militant
here on earth, hath farre greater mercies,
as his word and Sacraments, election,
calling, redemption, and ſanctification:
ſo that we may ſay, how great is thy goodnes
ô Lord which thou haſt laid vp for
them that feare, and done to them that
truſt in thee?
            And if the earth be full of ſo many

temporall and generall mercies, and the
Church ſo full ſpeciall, and ſpirituall bleſſings;
how full is the life to come, the kingdome
of heauen, of all perfect, glorious and
heauenly bleſſings? Indeede the holy meetings
of the Saints, worſhipping and praiſing
God truely, according to his worde,
hath ſome reſemblance and ſhadow of our
eternall happines in heauen, and our felicitie
there, muſt begin in this life: and there is
a way and meanes to leade &amp; bring vs thither.
And of this happines ſpeaketh this
worthie woman in this place, and our
thoughts and meditations may applie this
ſentence further: For if ſhee eſteme and account
the ſeruants and Courtiers of Salomon
to bee happie, becauſe they enioy the
ſight and preſence of ſo glorions a King;
Are not we to eſteeme it as the beſt, &amp; moſt
perfect happines, to enioy the preſence of
Chriſt, the true Salomon, and to bee with
him in his houſe, in euerlaſting glorie?
            Ieruſalem, the citie of God, the beautie
and ioy of the world, the temple of Salomon,
moſt glorious and beautiful, his owne
houſe, and Pallace, moſt ſumptuous, coſtly,
and pleaſant: So that happie might they be
counted which were citizens of ſuch a Citie,
which might worſhip God in that Temple,

And indeed many came farre &amp; neere
to their great coſt and paines, to offer ſeruice
to God in that place: and happy might
they ſeeme to be, which liued and dwelled
in ſuch a Pallace: but all theſe were nothing
in compariſon of that Citie, of that Temple,
of that Pallace, whereof wee ſpeake▪
Thoſe were earthly, outward, mutable▪ and
tranſitorie, and ſubiect to ruine &amp; deſtruction:
theſe are Celeſtiall, durable, and euerlaſting.
Our Pilgrimage being ended,
we ſhall be indeed citizens of that heauenlie
and holy Ieruſalem, which ſhall be all of
pure golde, like vnto cleare criſtall, hauing
the foundations of the Walles grarniſhed
with precious ſtones, the gates of Pearles,
which hath no need of Sunne or Moone to
ſhine in it, becauſe the brightnes of GOD
ſhalbe the light of it, and the Lambe himſelfe
ſhall be the Candle of it: no defiled
thing ſhall enter into it; Oh how happie
ſhall the Citizens been, that ſhall liue in ſuch
a Citie? And thus S. Iohn, by the deſcription
of the moſt rich and precious things
of the world, layeth out vnto vs the value,
glorie, and maieſtie of the felicitie, prepared
for vs in heauen. In this miſerable life,
full of ſorrowes and cares, all ſorts of men,
yea, moſt wicked men, haue many commodities,

pleaſures, and delight. What happines
and ioy then, ſhal the friends of God,
and all good men haue, in that life, of all
true ioy and happines.
            Heerevpon ſaith a Father, in the ſecret
ſpeech of his ſoule with God; O Lorde, If
thou for this vile bodie of ours, giue vs ſo
great and innumerable benefites, from the
Firmament, from the Aire, from the Earth,
from the Sea, by light, by darknes, by
heate, by ſhadowe, by deawes, by ſhowers,
by windes, by raines, by Byrdes, by
Fiſhes, by beaſts, by Trees, by multitude
of hearbes, and varietie of Plants, and by
the miniſterie of all the Creatures; O
ſweete Lord, what manner of things, how
great, how good, and how innumerable
are thoſe which thou haſt prepared in
our heauenly countrey, where we ſhall ſee
thee face to face. If thou doeſt ſo great
things for vs in our priſon, what wilt thou
giue vs in thy Pallace? If thou giueſt ſo many
things in the worlde, to good and euill
men together, what haſt thou layde vp for
only good men in the worlde to come? If
thine enimies and friendes together, are ſo
well prouided for in this life, what ſhall thy
onely Friends receiue in the life to come?
If there be ſo great ſolace in theſe dayes of

teares, what ioy ſhall there bee in that day
of marriage? If our Iayle containe ſo great
matters, what ſhall our countrey and kingdome
doe? And as there is no ende of thy
greatnes, nor number of thy wiſdome, nor
meaſure of thy benignitie: So is there neither
end, nūber, nor meaſure, nor nūber of
thy rewards, towards thē that loue &amp; fight
for thee. We may ſooner ſet downe, what
that felicitie is not, then what it is: there is
no death, no ſorrow, no wearines, no hunger,
no thirſt, no pouertie, no infirmitie, no
corruption; all is good, and greatly, and excellently
good: yea, and ſurely, and contially
good. All offices and callings, both of
Church and cōmon-wealth, do there ceaſe:
there is an end of our Faith, hope, patience,
prayer, ſacraments, there is an end of originall
&amp; actuall ſin, of all miſeries both of bodie
&amp; ſoule; of naturall life, &amp; the meanes
of it: God ſhalbe vnto vs, King, Prince, Father,
riches, life, &amp; glorie; yea, all things,
and ſuch a heap of happines, that as ſundry
veſſels caſt into the middeſt of the Sea, are
full of water, ſo as they cānot neither want,
nor haue more; So the Sea of the Deitie,
being all things in all vs, we ſhall be filled
and ſatisfied with life and glorie: ſo as wee
can neither want, nor receiue more. Then

ſhall wee not onely taſte how ſweete our
God is, but wee ſhalbe filled, &amp; throughly
ſatiſfied with his moſt wonderful ſweetnes.
A chiefe part of our felicitie, ſhall be then
to ſee Chriſt, our brother, head, and Bridegroome,
exalted in his diuine Maieſtie and
brightnes.Iohn. 17. 24. This is their happines, that
they may be with him, and behold his glorie,
this is the fulneſſe and perfection of
their ioy.
            O heart, humaine, poore, and needie, ô
hart exerciſed with miſerie, &amp; almoſt cōſumed

were capable of the ioy which thou ſhuldſt
feele of one ſuch felicitie? but if beſides, anie
other whome thou loueſt as thy ſelfe,
ſhould enioy the ſame happines with thee,
ſurely this ſuperabounding ioy which thou
ſhouldſt feele of thy own happines, ſhould
it not be twiſe doubled, for the glorie and
ioy of him whome thou loueſt as thy ſelfe:
and for whoſe hahpines thou ſhouldſt be as
ioyfull as for thine owne? Now if there
were two, three, yea, a great number enioying
the ſame happines with thee, whom, alſo
thou loueſt as thy ſelfe, thou ſhouldeſt
feele as much ioy for the happines of each

of them as for thine owne; what ſhall this
be in this perfect Charitie, when wee ſhall
loue all the bleſſed Angels, and the Elect,
louing euery each one of them, euen as our
ſelues, and being no leſſe ioyfull of the felicitie
of eache of them then of our ſelues?
Surely, if neuer a one of the Elect ſhall be
capable of his owne Ioy, for the greatnes
of it, how ſhall hee be capable of ſo many
ioyes, for the happines of ſo many of the
Elect, for whome he ſhall feele as much ioy
as for his owne.
            What a Ioye ſhall it be, to ſee ſuch an
honourable and innumerable companie in
ioy with thee? As, Angels, Archangels,
Patriarkes, Princes, Prophets, Apoſtles,
and Diſciples of CHRIST, Martyrs, and
Saints of God, but yet the greateſt ioy of
all is, to behold the glorie of Chriſt, whom
wee ſhall loue more then all theſe; Yea,
more then our ſelues; wee ſhall then ſee
him and know him as he is, and ſo loue him
according as hee is.
            Oh, bleſſed and glorious ſocietie; ô
holy Feaſt; ô delectable dainties; where

Saints art, and the Diademe of their perpetuall
glorie; Reioyce them on euery ſide
with thy bleſſed ſight, in this kingdome

without ſadneſſe, health without ſorrowe,

life without labour: light without darkenes:
felicitie without abatement: all goodnes,

that neuer waxeth olde; life that
knoweth no ende; beautie that neuer fadeth;
loue that neuer cooleth; health that
neuer diminiſheth; ioy that neuer ceaſeth;
where ſorrow is neuer felt, complaint is neuer
heard, matter of ſadnes is neuer ſeene;
nor euill ſucceſſe is euer feared; for that
they poſſeſſe thee ô Lorde, which art the
perfection of their felicitie: If God would
graunt thee to enioy this felicitie but halfe
an houre, thou wouldeſt contemne a thouſand
worlds to haue it, eſpecially to haue it
for euer. And though this world were indeed
very good, &amp; the things of it, of great
waight and price, and that thou mighteſt
enioy it, in health, ſafetie, and honour, yet
ſhouldeſt thou eſteeme it as ridiculous and
vaine, in reſpect of that moſt happie fruition
of God: How much more being as it
is, moſt vile, baſe, vncertaine, tranſitorie,
ſhouldeſt thou deſpiſe the greateſt Treaſures
or pleaſures of it? in compariſon of
that Felicitie, that is, the greateſt and moſt
true good, which is receceiued from the
Creator himſelfe, and not from the creature:
the which if wee doe once receiue,

none can take it from vs, in compariſon of
which, all ioy is ſorrowe, all pleaſure is
paine, all ſweetnes is ſower, all beautie is
filthines. His countenance is pleaſant, his
words ſweete, his face delectable to looke
vpon: Yet there we may alwayes beholde
him, there wee may alwayes haue him, and
delight in him. This is the chiefe &amp; whole
felicity of man, to know, and loue his louer:
Hee that is ſure of this, will ſell all that hee
hath to get this treaſure: will count all the
things of this life droſſe and dung in compariſon
of that. The hope and aſſurance of
this, hath made the Saintes of God to contemne
the worlde, to mortifie the fleſh, to
to hūble their ſoules, to fight againſt temptations,
to endure reproches, ſcoffings, and
torments, and to die cheerfullie and willingly,
hauing reſpect to the crowne of glorie,
the place of pleaſure, euerlaſting life.
            This made Moſes to refuſe to be called
the ſonne of Pharaohs daughter, &amp; to chuſe
rather to ſuffer aduerſity with the people of
God, then to enioy the pleaſures of ſin for a
ſeaſon, eſteming the rebuke of Chriſt, greater
riches then the treaſures of Egipt; Many
would thinke this a foolſh refuſall, &amp; a fooliſh
choyce: but the cauſe that moued him
followeth, he had reſpect to the recōpence

of reward.Heb: 11. 24▪ 25. Againe, he forſooke Egypt and
feared not the fiercenes of the King, for he
endured as he that ſaw him, which is in viſible;
I haue beene long, and large in this
point: but pardon me, I cannot content and
ſatisfie my ſelfe, and the matter is waightie
and of great importance, and the chiefe
end of our creatiō, of our calling, redemption,
and ſanctification, and yet few doe
regard it. Oh, that all which I haue ſaid,
might drawe our hearts from the vanities
of the world, to ſettle and fixe them vpon
eternall happines: This text indeed ſpeaketh
of that chiefe happines, which may be
had in this life, and is a meanes whereby
we may come to the other: yet this is a
conſequent of that, and the firſt degree of
life eternall in this life. Beſides, that there
may be ſome fit reſemblance and illuſion,
betwixt the glory, happines, and wiſedom
of Salomon, and of Chriſt: ſo that in the
cloſet of our ſoules, we may ſay to our
Sauiour in theſe words, Sonne of God,
Sonne of Dauid, the true Salomon, the
King of that heauenly Ieruſalem, the King
of peace and glory, happie are thy ſeruants
and Saints in heauen, the Citizens of that
Citie, the worſhippers of that Temple, the
attendants and inhabitants of that pallace,

which doe alwaies behold thy maieſtie,
thy holines and wiſedome. If this woman
admired the order in Salomons houſe, the
glory and beautie of his pallace, and his
wonderfull wiſedome, how admirable is
thy glory, beautie, and wiſedome in the
heauens? If ſhe count them happie which
enioy theſe things, how happie are they,
which enioy thy preſence, in thine eternall
kingdome? and are they not moſt happie
which haue left a noyſome filthy priſon, to
enioy a pallace: that haue paſt from the turbulent
ſea, to a moſt ſafe heauen of reſt? are
they not happie, which haue left all toyle
and labour, and be now at eaſe? and are
they not happie which haue ended their
pilgrimage, and are now at home in a pleaſant
countrie, in that bleſſed land of Canaan?
and though their bodies be ſtill in their
graues, ſubiect to duſt and rottenneſſe, yet
are thoſe bodies happie in compariſon of
ours, they being exempted from ignorance,
incredulitie, from miſtruſt, from
couetouſnes, ambition, enuie, hatred,
feare, terror, luſt, and other ſinnes.
            Oh ſweet Ieſus, direct and leade vs in
the way to true happines, that wee may be
happie with them. We haue many hinderances,
many enemies to keepe vs from that

Aeternall Felicitie; but thou art the way,
the Truth, &amp; the life: guide vs right, keepe
vs from error, leade vs to life Eternall: And
good Lord, remember vs, with the fauour
of thy people, viſite vs with thy ſaluation,
that we may ſee the felicitie of the choſen,
and reioyce in the ioy of thy people, and
glorie with thine inheritance; giue vs ſweet
Lord, the beginning of that true happines;
that ſo we may be happie here, and hereofafter
happy for euer. Giue vs ſauing knowledge,
peace of conſcience, the guidance
of thy Spirit: that ſo heere we may haue
thy Kingdome of grace, and after
this life, thy Kingdome
of glorie.
         
         
            
            THE SECOND
SERMON.
            
               THough all men naturallie
deſire to bee happie, yet
moſt doe faile and erre in
the defining of true happines:
Some repoſing it in
one thing, ſome in another;
but fewe or none truely iudging what it is;
We haue heard already, that ther is no true
perfect happines in this life: but the true
Felicitie is to be ſought for, deſired, and
wayted for in the life to come; yet there
is a meanes to come to that, and there is a
kinde of Happines in this life, the which
this holy woman doth repoſe &amp; fixe in true
wiſdom; of the which now we are to ſpeak
in ſuch manner and meaſure, as God ſhall
vouchſafe grace vnto vs. There is the wiſedome
of the worlde, and the wiſedome of
God: a wiſedome humane, and a wiſdome

diuine: Humane wiſedome, containeth the
knowledge of Artes and liberall Sciences,
the politique gouernment of the Commonwealth,
and families, and the knowledge
in Trades and handie-craftes. All
theſe, yea the leaſt of theſe, are the ſpeciall
gifts of God. And therefore the Lord
ſaith to Moſes, Beholde, I haue called by
name Bezaliel,Exod. 31. 1, 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. the ſonne of Vri, the ſonne
of Hur, of the Tribe of Iudah, whome I
haue filled with the ſpirit of God, in wiſedome,
and in vnderſtanding, and in knowledge,
and in all workmanſhip, to finde
out curious workes, to worke in gold, and
in ſiluer, and in braſſe: Alſo in the arte to
ſet Stones, and to carue in Timber, and to
worke in all manner of worke-manſhip;
And beholde, I haue ioyned with him Aholiab
the ſonne of Ahiſamah, of the tribe
of Dan; and in the hearts of all that are
wiſe hearted, haue I put wiſdome, to make
all that I haue commanded thee.
            By the which place wee may ſee, that
wiſedome and skill to doe ſuch workes, is
the gifte of GOD; and the wiſedome of
God doth not take away, or ouerthrowe
the wiſedome of the worlde, in Sciences,
gouernments, or Trades; but rather it
doeth helpe and cure the errors and faultes

that are in, humane wiſedome; the preſeruation
of Kingdomes, and Cities, conſiſteth
in peace, iuſtice, and mercie: but
all theſe are commended, and commanded
in the Goſpell. All ciuill vertues, as Chaſtitie,
Temporance, Iuſtice, Fortitude; are
made better by the Goſpell.
            What is the ouerthrow of Kingdomes,
and of Countreys, but notorious vices and
ſinnes? As Prophanenes, Atheiſme, Idolatrie,
diſobedience, Murthers, Adulteries,
and ſuch like; but Gods wiſedome
doth reproue, contemne, and ouerthrow all
ſuch vices.
            There are ſome things common, betwixt
humane and diuine wiſedome; as
in both there are proofes, from cauſes and
effects; things neceſſarie, and things profitable,
are diſtinguiſhed; arguments are
diſpoſed in iuſt order, and in fit wordes;
in both, there are definitions, diuiſions,
collections, but yet great difference betweene
humane and diuine wiſedome.
            The one doth follow the light of nature,
the other is guided by the Spirit, and by
Faith.
            The one doeth drawe her principles
from the Sences, from Obſeruation, and
Experience: the other doeth altogether,

wholie and onely reſt vpon the worde of
God. The one doth diſpoſe of ſpeeches
and actions, according to the nature of
the hearers, and buſineſſes; The other, is
alwayes like her ſelfe: laying open the
ſinnes of men, and the wrath of God againſt
them; offering CHRIST and his
benefites to all beleeuing, and repenting
ſinners: and finallie, vrging amendment,
and newnes of life. This is the ſumme and
courſe of Gods wiſdome without alteration.
Againe, the wiſedome of the world,
doth deuiſe &amp; vtter eloquent ſpeeches, and
fine ſentences: the wiſdome of God, doth
vſe fit, graue, ſimple, &amp; plaine words: the other
doth boaſt it ſelfe, &amp; doth lift vp the
mindes of men, this doth humble and caſt
them downe.
            Now ſeeing there are ſo many and great
differences, how can they agree together,
and euer be reconciled? And therefore the
wiſedome of God, accounteth the wiſdom
of the world fooliſhnes; and the Lord ſpeaketh
baſely of the wiſdome of this worlde,
eſteeming &amp; counting it meere fooliſhnes.
And yet there is a lawfull vſe, of ciuill wiſedome
in this life, but in the life to come, it
hath no vſe at all: this heere is not to bee
contemned, but may bee vſed; and hath

many commodities in this world, but it
doth nothing profit to ſaluation: it muſt
not meddle with Gods wiſedome, to check
or controule it, but rather ſubmit her ſelfe
to it, as a ſeruant and hand-maid, and to
keeepe her ſelfe within her owne compaſſe
and limits; and yet this wiſedome hath her
worthineſſe and excellencie, it is more excellent
then riches, pleaſure, or ſtrength;
for what are all theſe without wiſedome?
and therefore the Wiſe man ſayeth, That
wiſedome is good with an inheritance, and
excellent to them that ſee the ſunne: his
meaning is, that heritages, goods &amp; lands,
are the gifts of God, but wiſedome is farre
more excellent, and may be without them:
but riches or pleaſures without wiſedome,
will doe vs more hurt then good. Againe
he ſayeth, Wiſedome ſhall ſtrengthen the
wiſe man more then ten mightie princes
that are in the citie. Yet moſt doe glorie in
riches, and hunt after pleaſures, and few regard
humane wiſedome and learning: moe
are fooliſh, ſimple, and ſottiſh that way,
then wiſe. Great good and profit comes by
the knowledge of naturall things, for they
doe publiſh the praiſe of the Creator, and
from them we may learne to know the Creator:
Pſal. 19. 1. The heauens declare the glorie of

God, and the firmament ſheweth his handie
worke. But this knowledge is ſufficient
to make men excuſable, but not ſufficient
to ſaluation. But all ciuill &amp; humane
wiſedome is but a ſhadow, in reſpect of
true wiſedome, which doth excell al other,
as the heauen doth excell the earth: this
commeth and proceedeth from the holie
of holieſt, as it were from the kings ſecret
cloſet; the other from the common treaſurie,
as it were from the outward courts of
the kings pallace: true wiſedome is beſtowed
onely vpon Gods friends, the other
vpon his enemies alſo. It may be demaunded
then of what wiſedome this woman
ſpeaketh, which ſhe calleth the wiſedome
of Salomon, and counteth them bleſſed
that heareth it. It is true that Salomon excelled
in the knowledge of naturall things,
of liberall ſciences, and of publicke &amp; priuate
gouernment. It is ſaid before in this
booke,1. King. 4. 29. 30. 31. that God gaue Salomon wiſedome
and vnderſtanding exceeding much, and a
large heart, euen as the ſand that is on the
ſea ſhore: &amp; Salomons wiſedome excelled
the wiſedome of all the childrē of the Eaſt,
&amp; al the wiſedome of Egypt, for he was wiſer
thē any man, &amp; he was famous throughout
all nations round about. But this woman

came to be inſtructed and ſatisfied, in
things concerning the name of the Lord:
ſhe came to Ieruſalem where was the Law,
the Temple, &amp; Salomon: ſhe had no doubt
at home many Philoſophers, many wiſe &amp;
learned mē, which could ſufficiētly inſtruct
her in the knowledge of naturall &amp; worldly
matt
                  ••
                but they could not ſatisfie her, in
her doubts cōcerning religion. Againe, the
effect &amp; power wrought in her heart by this
wiſedome, driueth her to great admiration,
ſhe repoſeth felicitie in it, it wrought in her
grace &amp; religion, confeſſing &amp; worſhipping
the true God, and acknowledging Iſrael to
be Gods people. No wit of man, no ciuil or
humane wiſedome, hath any ſuch power to
worke ſuch a worke. Now that Salomon
was a Prophet, &amp; full of diuine wiſedome,
his works extant amongſt vs doe proue it:
I meane his three worthie bookes of the
Prouerbes, Canticles, &amp; Eccleſiaſtes, which
are Canonicall, and his true bookes in the
Hebrew Canon. I pray you conſider with
me the ſumme of the diuine matter contained
in thoſe bookes: The Prouerbes are
moſt excellent, not humane, but diuine:
all nations and tongues haue their peculiar
prouerbs, ſentences, and wittie counſels,
in fewe words, ſetting out great matter.

There be ſentences of Plato, Ariſtotle, Plutarch,
Seneca, but there is great difference
betwixt the Prouerbes and ſentences of
the wiſeſt Gentiles, and Prouerbs of Salomon,
for the other they are knowne in nature:
and many of them are prophane, and
filthie, contrarie to faith and charitie; but
theſe are Propheticall, ſacred Scripture,
inſpired by the Holy Ghoſt: they containe
many things, which humane reaſon is not
able to ſee nor comprehend: they commend
the word of God, and teach true
wiſedome, how we may attaine to it, and
ſtirre vp all to ſeeke and follow it; they
teach vs faith and pietie, the true worſhip
and feare of God, the true loue of God
and our neighbour: they are full of precepts
and exhortations, full of graue counſell,
and ſweete conſolations; they informe
all men in the ſeuerall duties of their callings;
Prou. 8. they commend vertue, and forbid
vice;Prou. 9. they ſet downe rewards for the godly,
and puniſhments for the wicked; they
ſpeake of Chriſt, the wiſedome of wiſedome,
the wiſedome of the Father. The
Canticles, intituled, The Song of Songs,
the moſt excellent and holie Song, is no
vaine nor idle booke, of wanton loue, as
carnall men may falſely conceiue and imagine,

but it is altogether myſticall, ſpeaking
of the ſpirituall loue of Chriſt and
his Church. And thus writeth one of this
booke:Aug. de ciuit. dei lib. 17. cap. 20. The Canticles (ſayeth he) is a certaine,
ſpirituall, and holie delight, in the
Mariage of the King and the Queene of
this heauenlie Citie; that is, Chriſt and the
Church: but this is all in myſticall figures, to
inflame vs the more to ſearch the truth, &amp;
to delight the more in finding the appearance
of that Bridegroome, to whom it is
ſaid there, Trueth hath loued thee: and of
that Bride that receiueth this word, Loue
is in thy delightes. As for the booke of the
Eccleſiaſtes, it doth intreate of the ſame argument
we haue now in hand, of the chiefe
felicitie of man in this life, that it is not
in humane wiſedome, nor in pleaſure, nor
in vertue, if it be conſidered as it is in it
ſelfe, nor in any publique or priuate ſtate
of life. Againe, he ſheweth what is true
felicitie, namely, to feare God, and to worſhip
him with a true and vnfaigned heart.
This booke maketh nothing for Epicures
and Atheiſts, though hee ſeeme to ſtirre
them vp to eating and drinking, and to reioyce,
as though this was the chiefe felicitie
of man in this life.
            S. Auguſtine applieth that in the place

before alledged, to ſpirituall eating and
drinking, &amp; to the participation of Chriſts
table. For he ſayeth, The Preacher cannot
meane of carnal eating, becauſe in an other
place of that booke he ſaith, It is better to
goe to the houſe of mourning, then to goe
to the houſe of feaſting: becauſe this is the
end of all men, and the liuing ſhall lay it to
his heart. Againe, the heart of the wiſe is in
the houſe of mourning, but the hearts of
fooles are in the houſe of mirth: yet ſometimes
it may be, and it is moſt likely, that he
ſpeaketh not in his owne perſon, but in the
perſon of Epicures, not allowing their
ſpeech nor practiſe.Eccle. 2. For doth he not ſay of
laughter and pleaſure, Thou art mad? And
doth he not in an other place ſcoffe and
threaten yong men for their vaine delights
and pleaſures, ſaying; Reioyce ô yong man
in thy youth, and let thy heart cheare thee
in the dayes of thy youth, and walke in the
wayes of thy heart in the ſight of thine
eyes, but know, that for all theſe things
God will bring thee to iudgement. And
preſently after he giueth him this counſell,
Eccle. 12. Remember now thy Creator in the
dayes of thy youth. And ô ye Atheiſts, Epicures,
and Libertines, marke and remember
the concluſion of that booke, as he

began, ſo he endeth, crying and repeating,
Vanitie of vanities (ſayeth the Preacher)
all is vanitie: and the laſt word of
his booke are theſe, Let vs heare the end
of all, Feare God, and keepe his commandements:
for this is the whole dutie of
man, for God will bring euery worke to
iudgement, with euery ſecret thing, whether
it be good or euill. This is the chiefe
wiſedome of Salomon, which is extant,
written and recorded for the inſtruction
of all poſterities: this is true and diuine
wiſedome: and though it was not then
written when theſe words were ſpoken,
yet the ſame or the like he taught this woman,
ſhe receiued &amp; beleeued it, and with
great ioy doth heere, commend, and magnifie
it. Therefore true felicitie conſiſteth
in true and diuine wiſedome, which was
vnknowne to the Philoſophers, for their
wiſedome was earthlie, falſe, and contrary
to it ſelfe: and as there is one Creator and
gouernor of the world, one God, one truth,
ſo there muſt needs be but one true wiſedome,
becauſe whatſoeuer is true &amp; good,
it cannot be perfect, except it be ſingular.
And therefore it is worthilie ſaid, All the
wiſedome of man conſiſteth in this one
thing, that he know and worſhip God: this

is our doctrine, this is our ſentence, and
therefore with as high a voice as I can, this
I teſtifie, this I proclaime, and this I denounce,
Lactan. lib. 3. de fal. ſap. cap. 6. this is that which all the Philoſophers
in their whole life ſought for, but
could neuer finde nor comprehend it, becauſe
they held a falſe religion, or elſe vtterly
ouerthrew religion: let them therefore
goe, which haue troubled the life of
man, for what ſhould they teach, or whom
ſhould they inſtruct, who haue not inſtructed
themſelues? whom can the ſicke man
cure, or whom can the blind rule or guide?
ſhall wee tarrie then till Socrates know
any thing? till Anaxagoras finde light in
darkeneſſe? or ſhall we ſtay till Democrates
draw out the truth? or till Empedocles
dilate the paths of his minde? or Arceſilus
and Carneades perceiue and vnderſtand?
Behold a voyce from heauen
teaching the truth, and ſhewing to vs
light more cleare then the ſunne it ſelfe.
Why are wee iniurious to our ſelues, and
ſo ſlow to receiue wiſedome? How manie
worthie men haue ſpent themſelues
in ſeeking, and yet could neuer finde? He
that will bee wiſe and bleſſed, let him
heare the voyce of God, let him learne
righteouſneſſe, let him contemne earthly

things, receiue heauenly, that ſo he may
attaine to the beſt and greateſt good, to
the which hee was borne, caſting a ſide
all other religions: Let vs come to the true
religion and wiſedome, this true wiſedome
conſiſteth in the knowledge of our
ſelues, and in the knowledge of God, this
is the height of wiſedome, in compariſon
of which all knowledge is ignorance, and if
thou hadſt the perfect knowledge of all
Arts and Sciences, what would it profit
thee if thou knowe not thy ſelfe: thou wandreſt
abroad, and thinkeſt thou knoweſt
many things, and yet are blinde at home:
But ô bleſſed ſoule which is filled with
wiſedome of God, and happie is he who
deſireth to be wiſe in Gods ſight, for one
little drop of this true wiſedome, is more
worth, then a riuer and ſea of worldly wiſdome:
In all the creatures the Lord doth
ſhew his wiſedome and power, but moſt
of all in man, creating him after his owne
Image and likenes: many knowe many
things, and yet knowe not themſelues:
they ſee others and paſſe by themſelues:
the better thou doeſt knowe thy ſelfe, the
better thou ſhalt knowe God. Set before
thine eyes the miſerie of thy body, and the
ſhortnes of this miſerable life, and ſo thou

ſhalt come to GOD; thou muſt beginn
                  •
               
with the knowledge of thy ſelfe: this will
humble thee, and make thee feare God.
If thou wilt knowe what thou art, looke
thy ſelfe in a glaſſe: The glaſſe of a man,
is an other man; If an other be earth, duſt,
and wormes, ſuch a one art thou, bee thou
neuer ſo Riche, or Honourable. If thou
wilt ſee what thou art, looke vpon a man,
(not aliue, but deade) what hee is, ſuch
were his predeceſſors, and what they are,
thou ſhalt be the ſame hereafter.
            If thou looke well vpon thy ſelfe, thou
ſhalt finde in thee ſufficient matter to contemne
thy ſelfe. What art thou in reſpect
of thy bodie, but a veſſell of corruption?
That bodie, which thou ſo tenderly loueſt,
it ſhall rotte, and come to nothing.
What is more noyſome then a deade bodie?
What is more miſerable then mans
life? and moſt of all miſerable, in reſpect
of his ſoule, being without grace, an heire
and childe of perdition.
            This knowledge of our ſelues, the
firſt part of true wiſedome, will cut downe
all Pride, Ambition, and Impatience;
and from this proceedeth the knowledge
of God; and from the knowledge of our
ſelues: knowe GOD to be moſt iuſt, moſt

mercifull, moſt wiſe, moſt good, and moſt
powerfull. And if thou wouldſt knowe
what GOD is, ſee what thou art to him,
and what hee is to thee. And if thou wilt
rightly knowe GOD, caſt off the loue and
wiſedome of the world.
            This double knowledge of GOD and
thy ſelfe, is neceſſarie to ſaluation; becauſe,
as from the knowledge of thy ſelfe,
there commeth into thee the feare of God;
and alſo from the knowledge of God,
there proceedeth the loue of God. So on
the contrary,Bern: ſuper Cant. from the ignorance of thy
ſelfe, proceedeth Pride, and from the ignorance
of GOD, commeth Deſperation.
            Thou haſt found true wiſedome, if thou
wilt amend the ſinnes of thy former life;
If thou deſire with all thy heart Eternall
bleſſednes,Bern: in Pro: 3. thou haſt found wiſedome; If
thou taſte and ſauour all theſe things, as
they are, that thy ſinne bee bitter to thee,
and abhorred; that the thinges of the
worlde bee as Tranſitorie, and contemptible;
that the perfect good things, bee
with thy whole deſires affected; In
theſe three things, thy mouth doth ſlowe
with Wiſedome: If in thy mouth there
bee confeſſion of thy ſinnes, the voyce
of praiſe, and of Thankes-giung, and

the word of edification. The wiſe man accuſeth
himſelfe, glorifieth God, edifieth
his neighbour: therefore in the Philoſophers
there could be found no true wiſedome,
becauſe ſome thought that all things
might be knowne: theſe were not wiſe:
others thought nothing could be knowne,
theſe alſo were not wiſe: the one becauſe
they giue too much to man, the other becauſe
they gaue too little: this then is wiſedome,
not to thinke thou knoweſt all
things which is proper to God, nor yet to
knowe nothing which is proper to beaſts:
knowledge in man is ioyned with ignorance:
knowledge in vs, is from the ſoule,
which is from heauen: ignorance is from
the body, which is from the earth, ſo that
we haue ſome communitie both with God
and with beaſtes; with God in reſpect of
knowledge, with beaſtes in reſpect of ignorance:
The more wee excell in diuine
knowledge, the nearer and the more liker
we are to God himſelfe, who is not onely
the fountaine and giuer of wiſedome, but
very wiſedome it ſelfe. But here may an
obiection be propounded, How is there
any true happines, ſeeing both in the getting,
holding, and enioying of wiſedome,
there is much care labour, ſorrowe, and

vexation of minde. This Salomon himſelfe
confeſſeth, when he ſaith, I gaue mine heart
to knowe wiſedome &amp; knowledge,Ecc: 1. 17. 18. madnes
and fooliſhnes: and I knowe alſo that
this is a vexation of the ſpirit, for in the
multitude of wiſedome is much griefe, and
he that encreaſeth knowledge, encreaſeth
ſorrow: this is true indeed, that in al trades,
callings, ſciences, there is great griefe and
labour. The Philoſophers no doubt tooke
great paines in finding out naturall things,
yet in many things, they were blinde, deceiued:
in gouernment, either of common-wealth
or families: there is much care and
labour, in inuenting of counſell and griefe,
when our counſells are hindred, and haue
not good effect, and ſometimes we erre in
gouerning, and the wiſeſt men are not alwaies
ſo wiſe as they ſhould be, and the
beſt wiſedome of man cannot foreſee all
dangers which follow, nor preuent them
with all their cunning. In Mechanicall
trades and handicrafts, what care and labour
to learne them, to exerciſe them, and
to encreaſe daily in skill and knowledge of
them? and in diuine wiſedome, there muſt
be great care and labour to get it, to hold
it, to increaſe in it, it will not be gotten by
eaſe and careleſnes, but with great ſtudie

and diligence, and much ſorrow is ioyned
with it.
            Good men are grieued, becauſe they
cannot ſo ſoone and ſo eaſily learn and vnderſtand,
as manie other can. Wee reade
&amp; heare many things, which do cauſe much
griefe vnto vs, as our owne ſinnes, and the
ſinnes of others; and the fearful iudgments
of God, which haue fallē vpon men for ſin:
and the more knowledge we haue, if we cō
               tinue
in ſin, without Repentance, the more
wee heape and multiplie the wrath of God
vpon vs, to our greater griefe and ſorrow:
and the more learning and knowledge that
men haue, the leſſe eaſe and reſt: For many
ſeeke vnto them, and they are ready and
willing to inſtruct others as much as they
can: which cannot be done without ſtudie
and labour. The calling of the Magiſtrate,
and of the Miniſter, though excellent &amp; diuine
callings, yet ſubiect to much vexation,
ſorrow, and danger, and exceeding paines.
            The Apoſtle ſaith, Who is ſufficient for
theſe things? And indeed, they be heauie
and intollerable burdens for anie mortall
man to beare, without the ſpeciall helpe
and grace of God. Beſides, the wiſer that
a man is, the more he ſearcheth, deſireth,
and ſeeketh for wiſedome ſtill: &amp; the more

he ſees his own ignorance; and this is griefe
and vexation of minde. There is no perfection
of wiſdome in this life; we ſee here
but in part, the beſt, and holieſt, and wiſeſt,
haue their wants, infirmities, &amp; ignorances.
Therfore the wiſe man (hauing feeling and
ſenſe of this, though he did excell in vertue
and knowledge; Yet he ſaith thus of himſelfe.
Surely, I am more fooliſh then anie
man, &amp; haue not the vnderſtāding of man: I
haue not learned wiſdome, nor attained to
the knowledge of holy things, who hath aſcended
vp to Heauen, and deſcended?Prou: 30 2. 3. 4. who
hath gathered the wind in his fiſt? who hath
bound the waters in a garment? who hath
eſtabliſhed all the ends of the world? what
is his Name? and what is his Sonnes Name
if thou canſt tell?
            The greateſt wiſedome in man, is like a
ſmoking Toarch, if it bee compared to the
beams of the Sunne, to the height of Gods
wiſedome, which is vnſpeakable and admirable.
The beſt men are woſt humble,
and confeſſe their ignorance; when as the
fooliſh proude people, thinke they knowe
all things, when as they knowe nothing
as they ought to knowe.
            Our ignoronce is much in the things
of this life, euen in common and vulgar

matters, we doe not ſo much as knowe the
names of many tooles and wares, which are
to be had, ſeene and fold in many occupiers
ſhops, in lawe, in phyſicke, in mathematick
                  •
               s,
&amp;c. Many knowe little, ſome nothing,
or very weakely, or vnperfectly: In
the matters of God, how ignorant and
ſenſeles are we? Nichodemus a great Docter
in Iſrael, cannot vnderſtand or conceiue
the doctrine of regeneration,Iohn. 3. it is a
thing incredible to him, that a man ſhould
be borne againe. The naturall man perceiueth
not the things of God, for they are
fooliſhnes vnto him, neither can he know
them, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned:
yea, the ſpirituall man himſelf, though
he diſcerneth all things that are reuealed
to him by the ſpirit, yet he hath not full
and perfect knowledge in this life, perfect
felicitie is in the life to come: and though
wiſedome be not that felicitie, yet it is the
way to attaine vnto it, and the ſtudie of it
is ſweete, good and profitable: it is as ſault
to ſeaſon, and as honie to ſweeten all cares,
troubles and ſorrowes whatſoeuer: it is as
a precious medicine to cure all maladies,
to comfort vs in the greateſt diſtreſſe and
dangers: and though thoſe which be ignorant
and knowe nothing, may ſeeme to be

happie becauſe of their ignorance, and becauſe
they are free from the care and ſorrowes
of wiſedome: yet their cares and
griefes are worſe and greater, they are in
danger and know it not: they cannot diſcerne
good from euill: and therefore let
them remember this counſell, let them
lightē themſelues with the light of knowledge,
Bern: in ſerm: before they goe out of the darkenes
of this world, leſt they paſſe frō darkenes
to darkenes, yea to euerlaſting darkenes.
Some may yet obiect: How is there
happines in wiſedome? whereas many
which profeſſe and preach it, and are of
great knowledge, yet prophane, without
religion, conſcience or pietie, their life
moſt vngodly and wicked, are theſe men
happie? We anſwere, that they are farre
from true happines and wiſedome. Salomon
accounteth all men vnregenerated
and wicked, to be very fooles, and ſo vnhappie
wretches. Ambroſe tepoſeth a happie
life in honeſtie, that is, in the tranquilitie
of conſcience, and ſecuritie of innocencie:
and therefore confuting the Philoſophers
of whom ſome placed a happie life,
in not ſorrowing as Ieronimus, ſome in the
knowledge of things as Herillus: ſome in
pleaſure as Epicurus: ſome haue ioyned to

this honeſtie, as Calipho and Diadorus,
ſome in vertue, as Ariſtotle and his ſect.
But the Scripture ſayth, he placeth a bleſſed
life in the knowledge of Diuinitie,
and the fruite of good working: It is eternall
life (ſayth Chriſt) to know God,
and Ieſus Chriſt whom he hath ſent. Dauid
ſayeth, Bleſſed is the man that feareth
the Lord, and delighteth greatlie in
his commandements: ſo that innocencie
and knowledge maketh men happie. Againe,
Ambroſe off. lib. 9. cap. 1. cap. 2. cap. 
                     〈◊〉
                  . wiſedome hath no fellowſhip with
vices, it hath an inſeparable coniunction
with other vertues. No man is wiſe
which knoweth not God. The foole, (not
the wiſe man) ſayeth, There is no God.
How is hee a wiſe man which knoweth
not his Creator? How is hee wiſe which
feareth not God?Off. lib. 1. cap. 25. ſeeing the feare of God
is the beginning of wiſedome. Onely that
wiſedome which is of God, is wholeſome
and ſauing, which according to the definition
of Saint Iames, is both pure, and
peaceable: for the wiſedome of the fleſh
is voluptuous, not pure: the wiſedome of
the world is tumultuous and troubleſome,
not peaceable: the wiſedome of God is
firſt pure, not ſeeking her owne, but that
which is Ieſus Chriſts: not doing her owne

will, but conſidering what is the will of
God. Secondly, it is peaceable, not abounding
in her owne ſenſe, but reſting more
vpon the counſell and iudgement of others.
Againe, the ſunne doth not warme
all whom it ſhineth vpon, ſo wiſedome
doth not alwayes giue power to thoſe
whom it teacheth, to doe that which it
teacheth. It is one thing to knowe riches,
Bern. in Cant. another thing to poſſeſſe them. It
is not knowledge that maketh rich, but
the poſſeſſion of it. There be ſome which
deſire to knowe to that end onely, that
they might know, and this is filthie curioſitie:
and there be which deſire to know,
onely to ſell their knowledge for money,
for honor, and this is filthie lucre: and
there be which deſire to know, that they
themſelues may be knowne, and this is filthie
vanitie: and there bee that deſire to
know to edifie others, and this is charitie:
and there be that deſire to know to be edified
of others, and this is prudence.
The firſt wiſedome is a laudable life,Greg. and
a pure minde before God, whereby the
pure are ioyned to the pure, and the holie
are coupled to the holie. That is excellent
wiſedome, not which flyeth in
words, but which conſiſteth in vertues;

ſo that happines conſiſteth not onely in
knowing,Iohn 13. 17. but alſo in working: if you know
theſe things ſaith Chriſt, happie are you if
you doe them.Mat: 11. 2
                     •
                  . Againe, bleſſed are they
that heare the word of God and keepeth
it: and the hearers of the lawe are not righteous
before God,Rom: 2. 13. but the docrs of the
lawe ſhall be iuſtified.Apoc: 1. 3. And S. Iohn faith,
Bleſſed is he that readeth, and they that
heare the words of this prophecie, and
keepe thoſe things written therein.
                  
                     〈◊〉
                  . 4. 25 And S.
Iames ſaith, Who ſo looketh in the perfect
lawe of libertie, and continueth therein, he
not being a forgetfull hearer, but a doer of
the worke, ſhall be bleſſed in his deed: Indeed
God beſtowed vpon prephane men
and very reprobates, many great and excellent
gifts: they may haue the word of
wiſedome,1. Cor: 12 ver. 7. 8. 9. 10. the word of knowledge, a kind
of faith, gifts of healing, operations of
great workes, and prophecie, diſcerning of
ſpirits, diuerſities of tongues, the interpretation
of tongues, and theſe are the workes
of Gods ſpirit: and yet theſe may be vnhappie
and curſed men, and neuer partakers
of true felicitie. Saul prophecieth, ſo
doth Balaam, ſo did Caiphas, Iudas was a
preacher and an Apoſtle, but not euery
one that ſaith, Lord, Lord, ſhall enter into

the kingdome of heauen,Mat: 7. 21. 22. 23. but he that doth
my Fathers will which is heauē, ſaith our
Sauiour; Many will ſay to me in that day,
Lord, Lord, haue we not by thy name prophecied,
and by thy name caſt out diuels,
and by thy name done many great works?
then will I profeſſe to them I neuer knewe
you, Depart from me you that worke iniquitie.
God doth beſtow ſuch great gifts
vpon wicked men, that his power might be
knowne, in vſing ſuch inſtruments to his
owne glory, to the good of others, and to
their cōdemnation: &amp; ſo the Lord alſo maketh
a differēce betwixt thoſe gifts which
he beſtoweth vpon the wicked, and ſuch
ſpeciall graces as he doth giue to his owne
children: to theſe he giues the knowledge
of ſaluation by remiſſion of their ſinnes,
through his tender mercy, wherby the day
ſpringeth frō on hie, viſiting thē, he giueth
them light,Luke. 4. 77. 78. 79. euē the Sun of righteouſnes ſhining
frō heauen, to guide their feete in the
way of peace, that is, to all true happines
and felicitie. Theſe are his beloued which
he hath choſen to ſaluation from the beginning,
ſanctifying them by his ſpirit,2 Theſ: 2. 13. 14. and
giuing them the faith of truth, euen the
faith of his elect, calling them by the Goſpell,
to obtaine the glory of our Lord Ieſus

Chriſt: theſe be the ſure notes and marke
                  •
               
of thoſe which are truely wiſe, and truely
happie: yea, happy here, and happy for euer.
Therefore let vs pray with the Prophet,
euery one of vs, ſaying; Looke vpon
vs 
                  〈◊〉
                Lord, &amp; be mercifull vnto vs: as thou
vſeſt to do; to loue thoſe that loue thy name.
We muſt not thinke then, that this woman
aſcribeth happines to the bare hearing of
Wiſedome: but this hearing, includeth
knowledge, Faith, and practiſe. Therefore
the Schoolemen make three kindes of hearing:
The one ſenſitu
                  •
                with outward eare,
an another Intellectuall, (that is) with vnderſtanding;
the third, they call Auditus obeditiuus;
that is, hearing with obedience.
The fooliſh Virgins they haue Lampes, but
no oyle in them, they haue onely a bare
profeſſion, and knowledge, without inward
grace, or practiſe: but the wiſe Virgins,
haue their Lamps full of oyle, full of
Faith, obedience, holineſſe. Such as be only
hearers, and not practitioners of wiſedome,
they be like vnto a man that beholdeth
his naturall face in a glaſſe, and when
he hath conſidered himſelfe, hee goeth his
way, and forgetteth immediatly what manner
of one he was: ſuch are fooliſh and vnfruitfull
hearers. With true wiſdome, there

is always ioyned true religion, &amp; ſanctification.
Therefore ſaith one; Wiſedome is no
other thing, but Truth it ſelfe, in the which
the true Felicitie ſhall be found: It is in no
place, it is euery where, it admoniſheth abroad,
it teacheth at home; it maketh all
better, and none worſe.
            Againe, he that loueth himſelfe being a
Foole, ſhall not profite in wiſedome. Neither
can it be poſſible to be ſuch a one, as
he deſireth to be, except he hate himſelfe, as
hee is. Both theſe muſt be ioyned together,
Religion and wiſdome: but men are deceiued,
that will ſeeke religion without wiſedome:
and therefore they fall into falſe Religions,
becauſe they haue left true Wiſedome:
And ſome giue themſelues to wiſedome
without religion, but therefore their
wiſdome is falſe &amp; vaine, becauſe they haue
no 
                  •
               are of the religiō of the true God, who
would guide &amp; inſtruct them in the way of
the beſt and happieſt wiſedome.
            Of this vniting of religion and wiſdome
together,Lacta: de fal. ſap: lic. 4. ca. 3. Lactantius writeth excellently:
Where Wiſedome (ſaith hee) is coupled
with Religion, there muſt of neceſſitie bee
true religion, and true wiſedome; becauſe
in worſhipping God, wee haue wiſdome:
that is, wee muſt knowe what is to bee

worſhipped, and how, and in being wiſe,
we muſt worſhip God: that is, we muſt performe
in truth and deed, that which we
know: where then is wiſedome with religion
to be found? euen there where the
one true God is worſhipped: where the
life and all our actions are referred to one
head: and he concludeth thus, in wiſedome
is religion, in religion is wiſedome, they
cannot be ſeparated nor put aſunder: becauſe
to be wiſe, is nothing elſe but to honor
the true God, with iuſt and holy worſhip.
And moſt worthily after he ſaith thus;
Wiſedome pertaineth to ſonnes which requireth
loue: religion to ſeruants which
requireth feare: as they are to loue, and honor
their father,Lanct ibid Cap. 4 ſo theſe are to feare and
reuerence their maiſter: God being one,
becauſe he taketh vpon him both theſe
perſons of a father and a maiſter: we ought
to loue him, becauſe we are his children:
and to feare him, becauſe we are his ſeruants:
And therefore it cannot be that religion
ſhould be ſeparated from wiſedom,
nor wiſedome from religion, becauſe the
ſame God is he who muſt be knowne,
which is a part of wiſedome, and muſt alſo
be honoured, which is a part of religion:
but let religion goe before, and let wiſedome

follow, becauſe we muſt firſt know
God, and then we muſt worſhip him; the
fountaine of wiſedome and religion, is
God himſ
                  •
               lfe. Therefore prophane and
wicked men are not truely wiſe, and ſo not
truly happie: the Lord complaineth of ſuch
people,Deut. 32. 28. 29. they are a nation voyd of counſell,
neither is there any vnderſtāding in them:
Oh that they were wiſe, then they would
vnderſtand this, they would conſider their
latter end. Bernard alledging this place,
They would vnderſtād ſaith he, the things
which are of God,In quad: Epiſt: the things which are of
the world, and they would foreſee the torments
of hell, then they would abhorre
hell, deſire heauen, and contemne the
earth. And this is true knowledge ſaith he,
to know that the Lord will come to iudgement,
though we cannot knowe when he
will come. And where as ſome wil ſay, that
all men know this, euen the wicked themſelues;
but ſaith he, this knowledge worketh
repentance, amendment of life, and a
care &amp; deſire to liue honeſtly. And S. Iohn
ſaith,1. Iohn. 3. 3. That euery man that hath this hope in
him, purgeth himſelfe as he is pure; ſo that
true knowledge, and true ſanctin̄cation,
goeth together. Therefore S. Iohn ſaith
in an other place, Hereby we are ſure that

we knowe him, if we keepe his commandements;
he that ſaith I knowe him, and
keepeth not his commandements, is a liar,
and the truth is not in him. So that this
ſtandeth as an infallible true principle,
that thoſe which are truly wiſe, are truly
happie in this life; and in the way to that
full and perfect happines in the life to
come. But now at laſt, to obſerue and proſecute
the chiefe &amp; maine point, and doctrine
of this place, which is this, that the
way and meanes to make a people happie,
is rightly to heare and obey wiſedome:
this is the principall ioy and happines of
Gods Children in this life. And therefore
ſaith Salomon, Bleſſed is the man that findeth
wiſedome, and the man that getteth
vnderſtanding, for the merchandiſes therof,
is better then the merchandiſe of ſiluer;
and the gaine thereof, is better then gold;
it is more precious then pearles; and all
things that thou canſt deſire, are not to be
compared to her: length of daies is in her
right hand, and in her left hand, riches and
glory: her waies are the waies of pleaſure,
and all her pathes proſperitie; ſhe is a true
life to them that lay hold on her, and
bleſſed is he that retaineth her: ſee the
fruits of wiſedome, immortalitie, durable

riches,Gen: 2. eternall glory, true Ioy and peace;
ſhe is a tree of life to the ſoule, like that
tree in paradiſe, a ſigne of Gods fauour;

                  •
               or like to the tree of life ſhewed to Moſes
in Marah,Exod: 15. 25. which ſweetned bitter &amp; deadly
waters: or like the tree of life in the Reuelation
22. verſ: 2. which brought forth
twelue fruits, and the leaues thereof were
for the curing of the gentiles: or like any
liuing good tree, which bringeth forth
good fruit, to the preſeruation of life:
Therefore the wiſe man ſaith,Pro: 4. 13. Take hold of
inſtruction, and leaue not, keepe her, for
ſhe is thy life.Pro: 10. 17. And againe, Hee that regardeth
inſtruction, is in the way of life.
Such a tree is wiſedome. It is compared
alſo to a precious fountaine, and well of

                  ▪ 10. 11. Therefore ſaith Salomon, The mouth
of the righteous, is a well ſpring of life;
and the inſtruction of a wiſe man,Pro▪ 13. 14. is as
ſuch a well, to turne away from the ſnares
of death:Pro▪ 26. 22. And againe, vnderſtanding is
a wel-ſpring of life to them that haue
it.
            The neceſſitie and commoditie of wiſedome,
all trees, plants, hearbes, all fruits
and creatures, haue neede of water, for
comforting, nourſhing, and ſuſtaining
them; but this water is farre more excellent

then all fountaines, wells, or water in
the world; this is true Aqua vitae, the water
of life; that other water commeth out of
the earth, this from heauen; that common
to the moſt vile &amp; wicked, and to all creatures
and beaſts: this peculiar and proper to
the ſonnes and daughters of God: that water
not to be found euery where, ſometimes
it quite fadeth and faileth in time of
drought: but this is offred to all, and doth
neuer vtterly decay: that water cannot
preſerue life againſt violence, diſeaſes and
age; This doth defend vs againſt Sathan
and ſinne, and maketh vs alwaies ſtrong
and liuely: thoſe waters may be ſtayed and
ſtopped by the policie &amp; malice of man, as
the Philiſtimes ſtopped the wells which
Abrahams ſeruants digged in his time, but
this well can no mortall man ſtop. This
wiſedome is alſo compared, to foode, to
bread, to a feaſt and banquet of moſt dilicate
coſtly dainties: wiſedome hath built
her a houſe, and hewne out her ſeuen pillars,
ſhe hath killed her victuals, drawne
her wine, prepared her table, ſhe inuiteth
and calleth her gueſtes to eate and drinke
with her:Pro: 9. 1. 1. 3. 4. 5. corporall foode is pleaſant to the
taſt:Fla
                     •
                  : 55. 1. 2. 3. the foode of wiſedome is pleaſant to
the ſoule: bodily foode, nouriſheth poore

weakely bodies; wiſedome reuiueth and
raiſeth vp wounded ſoules, and afflicted
conſciences: by earthly foode we growe
ſtronger and higher: by this ſpiritual foode
we growe in grace and the knowledge of
our Lord Ieſus Chriſt: other foode onely
for the bellie, but for a time: this foode for
the inward man, and endureth both in life
and death; it is durable foode, and nouriſhment
that abideth and ſticketh by vs;
it is the bread and foode of life: and finally,
it maketh vs truly happie and bleſſed;
and therefore to be chiefely eſteemed and
deſired. Wiſedome is the beginning ſaith
Salomon, get wiſedome therefore, and aboue
all thy poſſeſſions get vnderſtanding;
exalt her,Pro: 4. 7. 8. 9. and ſhe will exalt thee; ſhe ſhall
bring thee honor if thou imbrace her, ſhee
ſhall giue a comely ornament to thine
head, yea ſhe ſhall giue thee a crowne of
glory. And again, thus ſpeaketh wiſedom;
Oh yee fooliſh men, vnderſtand wiſedom:
and ye ô fooles, be wiſe in hart; giue eare,
and I will ſpeake of excellent things, and
the opening of my lippes ſhall teach things
that be right: receiue mine inſtruction, and
not ſiluer, &amp; knowledge rather then gold:
for wiſedom is better thē precious ſtones,
and all pleaſures are not to be compared to

her: ſhee is then excellent, vpright, perfect,
true, iuſt, plaine, eaſie, and ſweet:
ſhe promiſeth grace, fauour, friendſhip,
riches of the minde; As knowledge,
temperance, patience, righteouſnes; ſhe
promiſeth honor and glory to all her
friends and followers; as a Princeſſe,
ſhee ſhall either make thee honourable,
in the eyes of prophane people, as ſhee
did Ioſeph in Pharaohs ſight, or ſhe ſhall
make thee gratious and glorious in the
eyes of good men, of Angels, and of God
himſelfe: ſhe will make vs Kings, Prieſts,
Prophets. Oh moſt bleſſed, bountifull
and gratious wiſedome, happie, yea thriſe
happie, are all thy true diſciples and
followers: Let vs therefore harken to
that counſell of wiſedome; My ſonne
heare my words,Pro: 7. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. and hide my commandements
with thee; keepe my commandements
and thou ſhalt liue; and mine inſtruction
as the apple of thine eyes; binde
them vpon thy fingers, and write them
vpon the table of thine heart; ſay to wiſedome,
thou art my ſiſter: Againe, Harken
oh children to me, for bleſſed are
they that keepe my waies, heare inſtruction,
and be yee wiſe, refuſe it not: Bleſſed
is the man that heareth me, watching

dayly at my gates,Prou. 8. 32. 33. 34. and giuing attendance
at the poſtes of my doores: for hee that
findeth me, findeth life, and ſhall obtaine
fauour of the Lord; but he that ſinneth
againſt me, hurteth his owne ſoule, and
all that hate me, loue death▪ The way
therefore to make a people happie, is to
heare and obey this wiſedome: this is that
which the ſeruants of God haue chiefely
deſired &amp; wiſhed for in this life.1. King. 3. 9. Salomon
himſelfe, when he was put to his choiſe to
aske what he would, paſſed by all other

God, to giue him an vnderſtanding heart:
This was Iobes felicitie,Iob. 23. 12. I haue not departed

of his lips, and I haue eſteemed the words
of his mouth, more then mine appointed
food:Iere. 15: 16. This was Ieremies felicity, Thy words

thy word was vnto me, the ioy &amp; reioicing

happines,Pſal. 27. 4. One thing ſaith he, haue I deſired
of the Lord, that I will require, euen that
I may dwell in the houſe of the Lord all
the dayes of my life, to behold the beautie
of the Lord, to viſit his Temple. But
moſt liuely and fully hee ſheweth, that
this was his chiefe ioy and felicitie, in the

119. Pſalme, thorow that whole Pſalme:
for this is the chiefe ſcope and drift of that
large and ſweete Pſalme, that that man is
onely truely happie, that frameth his religion
and life according to the bleſſed rule
of the word of God: he commendeth the
diginitie, profit and ſweetnes of that word:
he prayeth many times for the vnderſtanding
and practiſe of it; he ſetteth forth
the great account and eſtimation he had
of it, the ſpeciall loue and delight he had
in it;Pſal. 1

in the way of thy teſtimonies, as in all riches,
thy teſtimonies are my delight and
my counſellers, the lawe of thy mouth
is better to mee then thouſands of gold

feete, and a light to my paths, thy teſtimonies
haue I taken as an heritage for euer,
for they are the ioy of mine heart;
I reioyce at thy word, as one that findeth
a great ſpoyle. But to let all the reſt paſſe,
let vs conſider and view a litle one whole
part of that Pſalme, wherein he proueth,
that his chiefe happines was in this word
of wiſedome: Oh, how loue I thy law!
Hee cannot vtter the great loue that hee
bare to it: as who ſhould ſay, I loue it
aboue all things in the world, there is nothing

ſo deere, and ſo precious to mee;
and becauſe many proteſt their loue to
Gods word, and yet indeed loue it not,
they ſhew forth no fruites of loue.Pſal. 119. 97. 98. 99. 100, &amp;c. Dauid

the word; It is ſaith he, my meditation
continually: As if he ſhould ſay, my affections
and thoughts are not ſeldome, but often
in a day vpon thy word: The bleſſed
man, his delight is in the law of the Lord,
and in his law doth meditate day &amp; night.
But Dauid proceedeth, and ſheweth what
profit and fruite he got, by the reading,
hearing, meditation, &amp; ſuch other exerciſes
of the word: he was not a ſimple, ſenſeleſſe,
vnprofitable, and vnfruitefull hearer,
as many are which heare much and are neuer
the better: but he proteſteth, that by
his exerciſe in the word, he had gotten and
learned wiſedome, yea more wiſedome
then his enemies, more then all his teachers;
more then the ancient, and that by
the power of the word, he refrained his
feete from euery euill way, and hated all
the waies of falſhood, and that his chiefe
care and deſire was to keepe and practiſe
the word: but yet he confeſſeth, that h
                  •
               
could not doe this of himſelfe, but that it
was God that did inwardly teach him

by his ſpirit, and ſo taſting the ſweetnes
of Gods grace in him, he found the word
and promiſe of God more ſweet to his
mouth then honie it ſelfe. You ſee what
account and eſtimation Dauid had of
true wiſedome, eſteeming it his chiefeſt
and greateſt felicitie; happie then are the
true ſchollers and followers of wiſedome.
And if this woman thus pronounce and
account the hearers of Salomon to be ſo
happie, how happie are they which doe
dayly heare the wiſedome of Ieſus Chriſt,
in the preaching and miniſtrie of the Goſpell?
Bleſſed are your eyes, for they ſee,
and your eares for they heare, ſayth our
Sauiour Chriſt to his diſciples and followers:
Mat. 13. 16, 17. For verily I ſay vnto you, that many
Prophets and righteous men haue deſired
to ſee thoſe things which you ſee, and haue
not ſeene them; and to heare thoſe things
which you heare, and haue not heard them.
Now in the miniſtrie of the Goſpel, wee
heare and ſee Chriſt himſelfe: He that heareth
you,Luke 10. 16. heareth me, and he that deſpiſeth
you, deſpiſeth me, ſayth Chriſt of his. Apoſtles,
and of all his faithfull miniſters;
We beſeech you as embaſſadors in Chriſts
ſtead,2. Cor. 5. 20. that you may be reconciled to God,
ſayeth S. Paul. And in another place, he

ſayeth,Gal. 3. 1. That Chriſt was deſcribed and pictured
before their eyes by the preaching
of the word. It was not the outward hearing
of Chriſt himſelfe, or the ſight of his
perſon that made mē bleſſed: for the Iewes
ſaw him, Iudas and other enemies to Chriſt
heard him and ſaw him often; But bleſſed
are they that haue not ſeene, and yet haue
beleeued: Chriſt is heard and ſeene in the
publike miniſtrie of the Goſpell. Wiſedome
hath ſent forth her maidens and
meſſengers to call and inuite vs to her feaſt
and banquet, happie are her gueſts, happie
are her diſciples and followers: to
haue ſuch meſſengers is a ſpeciall and rare
bleſſing of God. In Iob it is accounted
by Elihu, as a ſpeciall comfort in
the greateſt diſtreſſe and danger, to haue
a meſſenger, an interpreter, one of a
thouſand, to declare vnto man his righteouſnes:
then will God haue mercie vpon
him, and ſay, Deliuer him, that he
goe not downe into the pit, for I haue
receiued a reconciliation. By the which
words we are taught, that it is a ſure token
of Gods fauour and bleſſing towards
ſinners, when he cauſeth his word to be
preached to them. This God promiſeth to
his people as a ſpeciall mercie: and he ſaith,

I will giue you Paſtors according to my
heart, which ſhall feede you with knowledge
and vnderſtanding. It is 
                  •
               ESVS
CHRIST the wiſedome of all wiſedoms,Ephe. 4. 8. 11. 12.
that hath aſcended, and giuen giftes vnto
men, and hath ordained Paſtors and Teachers,
for the gathering and building of his
Church.
            What is your Felicitie ſaith S. Paul to
the Galathians? For I beare you record,
                  
                     •
                  al
                     •
                  t. 4. 14. 15.
that if it had ben poſſible, you would haue
pluckt out your owne eyes, and haue giuen
them mee. And before he ſaieth; That
they receiued him as an Angell of God;
he commendeth them faithfull in Galatia,
becauſe they eſteemed it the greateſt happines
vnder Heauen, to enioy the miniſtrie
of ſuch an Apoſtle, and Preacher, and faithfull
meſſenger of wiſdome. And is it not a
happy thing to haue the eyes of our ſoules
opened, to be turned from darknes to light,
and from the power of Sathan to God? that
ſo we may receiue forgiuenes of ſinnes, and
inheritāce among them which are ſanctified.
And is it not true happines, to haue our
ſoules borne &amp; begotten by the immortall
ſeede of Gods word;Acts. 26. 18. and as Babes and children
in CHRIST, to be fed and nouriſhed
with the ſweete and pure milke of eternall

life?1. Pet. 1. 23. &amp; cap. 2. 2. and this is don
                  •
                by the miniſtrie of
wiſedome. And is not this Felicitie, to
haue ſinnes reproued? to be inſtructed in
the right way?1. Cor. 14. 3. &amp; 2. to haue errors corrected?
to be comforted in all diſtreſſe and danger,
outward or inward?Tim. 3. 16. &amp; cap. 4. 2. and finallie, to bee
made wiſe to ſaluation? and all this is done
by the miniſtrie of wiſedome.
            And what happier thing can wee haue in
this life, then to know the Lordes minde?
then to haue his priuie counſell reuealed to
vs, and to bee made wiſe to Saluation,
through Faith, (which is) in Chriſt Ieſus?
Nay, Is it not eternall life, to know GOD,
and his Sonne IESVS CHRIST? and all
this we receiue, if we be gratious hearers, frō
the meſſengers of wiſedome. And will not
all confeſſe, that this is the greateſt good:
and the happieſt thing in the world, to haue
the wrath of God pacified, to bee in his fauour;
ſo that hee is become our Friend and
Father; and we are taken and accounted as
friends to him. And there is a true reconciliation
betwixt vs, ſo that we need neuer
doubt of the ſaluation of our ſoules. Now
this comfort and aſſurance we haue,2. Cor. 5. 
                     •
                  9. &amp; 1. Tim. 4. 16. 17. by the
miniſtrie of wiſdome, being the very word
of the Kingdome; the word of grace; the
word of reconciliation, and ſaluation; the

word of life: yea, of eternall life.
            And finally, Is it not true Felicity to haue
that good part, which ſhall neuer be taken
from vs? That one thing needfull, yea, ſo
needfull indeed, that wee had better want
all other things in this life, then be without
it. And is it not true happines, to haue that
happines reſtored and encreaſed, which Adam
had in Paradiſe, and loſt by his Fall?
to haue that Image of GOD, wherein hee
was firſt created, to bee reſtored vnto vs;
and in ſome ſome ſorte, to be made like to
GOD himſelfe, in true holines and Righteouſnes?
And is not all this true happineſſe,
and the way to that Eternall and perfect
bleſſednes, which wee ſhall enioy in
the Hea
                  •
               ens? whereof wee haue ſpoken
largely before.
            And thus we conclude from the premiſes,
as from infallible reaſons, taken from
the neceſſity, excellencie, power, and fruite
of Wiſedome; that this poſition and doctrine
which heere is holden and collected,
by the wordes of this Woman, is moſt true
and ſound: Namely, that the way to make
a people happie, is to heare, receiue, and
imbrace this true wiſedome. This is the
ioye and Felicitie of Gods children in this
life.
            
               
This doctrine ſerueth for many excellent
vſes; And firſt, it ſerueth to ſet out the miſerable
eſtate of ſuch as are deſtitute of this
gratious meanes: For if they be happy that
heare this wiſdome, vnhappy are they, and
curſed, which cannot heare it, which are
cleane without it, &amp; haue no taſte or knowledge
of it:Prou. 29. 18. Where Proph
                  •
               cying faileth,
or where there is no Viſion of wiſedome,
there the people periſh.
            And in an other place;Prou. 11. 14. Where no
counſell is, the people fall; But where
manie Counſellors are, there is health.
Againe, The Lorde complaineth in theſe
words,Hoſea. 4. 6. by the Prophet, ſaying; My people
are deſtroyed for lacke of knowledge:
Becauſe thou haſt refuſed Knowledge, I
will refuſe thee; that thou ſhalt bee no
Prieſt to mee: And ſeeing thou haſt forgotten
the Lawe of thy God, I will alſo
forget thy children.
            The Lorde threatneth it,Eſa. 56. 9. 10. as one of his
greateſt Iudgements, to ſend in his wrath
to anie people;Zach. 11▪ 
                  
                     •
                  6 17. Blinde Guides; dumbe
Dogges; Idoll Shepheards; and ſcarcitie
and famine of his word.Amos. 8. 11.
            
            And as our SAVIOVR CHRIST ſaith,
That if the blind leade the blind, both ſhal
fall into the ditche, Ignorance &amp; blindnes

is a wretched &amp; vnhappy thing, both in Miniſter
&amp; people: Knowledge, a part of Gods
Image, Ignorance defaceth it. Knowledge,
the Eye of the ſoule: Ignorance, the very
blindnes and darknes of the ſoule. It is the
cauſe of all ſinne and error: And if it bee
Eternall life to knowe God, it is eternall
death, deſtruction, and damnation, not to
know him.
            And heauy is that ſentence of the Apoſtle
againſt ſuch, when he ſaieth; That when
the LORD IESVS ſhall ſhewe himſelfe
from heauen, with his mighty Angels, hee
will (in flaming fire) render vengeance vnto
them that do not know GOD; &amp; which
obey not the Goſpell of our Lorde Ieſus
Chriſt;2. Theſſ. 1. 7. 8. 9. which ſhall be puniſhed with euerlaſting
perdition, from the preſence of the
Lord, and from the glory of his power.
            Some are maliciouſly ignorant, miſliking
and hating the Truth: Some are ſloathfull,
idle, &amp; careleſſe: They will take no paines
for Wiſedome. Some are proude, thinking
ſcorne to learne: and that they neede not
bee taught, but knowe enough alreadie:
Theſe are none of the ſonnes and daughters
of Wiſedome: but rather thoſe Fooles, of
whom Salomon often ſpeaketh in the Prouerbes;
And indeed the Diuell may begge
them

for fooles, theſe haue no part in this happines,
but are vnhappy here, and ſhall be
moſt vnhappy hereafter. This doctrine alſo
ſerueth for the reproofe of ſuch as ſeeke to
hinder and ſtoppe the courſe of wiſedome:
theſe are vnhappy themſelues, and ſeeke
to hinder the happines of others: they are
like to the malicious Philiſtimes,Gen: 26. which
ſtopped the welles of Iſaack, as faſt as he
digged them, and would haue kept his
cattle from water: ſo theſe would hinder
men from the ſweet water of life: He that
withdraweth the corne ſaith the wiſe man,
the people curſe him,Pro: 11. 26▪
                but bleſſing ſhall be
vpon the head of him that ſelleth corne.
Couetous and cruell men are moſt vile and
wretched creatures, which keepe backe
the corne from the poore, hoping for a
greater dearth: much more vnhappy are
they, which keepe from the people the
bread of life; the decay of tillage, is a hindrance
to the common-wealth, and the
cauſe of want and dearth; and they that
doe it, doe offend againſt God and men:
and they ſinne much more, which pulleth
downe Gods plough, and hinder the ſowing
of the bleſſed ſeede of his word, which
is as needfull for the ſoule, as husbandrie is
for the body. The righteous man regardeth

the life of the beaſt,Pro: 1
                     •
                  . 10. but the mercies
of the wicked are cruell: pitty and compaſſion
is to be ſhewed to the very dumbe
creatures that doth vs ſeruice, we muſt ſee
them fed, and it were cruelt
                  •
               e to pine them:
how much more are we to be mercifull
to men, to the bodies of men, and moſt of
all to their ſoules? And if it be crueltie to
pine and famiſh the bodies of men, yea of
any creature, how much greater crueltie is
it to pine, famiſh, and murther the precious
ſoules of men, in keeping from them, the
bleſſed and ſpirituall foode of their ſoules?
Were it not an vnmercifull &amp; cruell thing,
to take from a poore ſouldier, his ſword,
his buckler, his whole armour, and to leaue
him naked and open to the force and
rage of moſt cruell enemies: As vnmercifull
are they which take from the poore
people, the ſword of the ſpirit, the word of
God, being the armour of proofe, and ſo
leaue them altogether weake and vnarmed,
againſt their ſpirituall enemies: by
the power of the word, and the right vſe
and handling of it, Sathan, Antichriſt, ſin,

                  •
               rror, hereſies &amp; all corruptions, are weakned
and ouerthrowne: how ſhall we then
doe, if we be depriued of ſuch a weapon?
and moſt cruell are they that depriue and

robbe the poore people of it, ſuch are the
Papiſts, which keepe from the people, the
bleſſed booke of true wiſedome, &amp; wil not
haue it read to ye
                people in their own tōgue
but in a ſtrange &amp; an vnknowne language:
wheras the Apoſtle had rather in ye
                Church
to ſpeake fiue words with vnderſtanding,
then ten thouſand in a ſtrange tōgue:1. Cor. 14. &amp; he
would haue vs not to be children in vnderſtanding,
but of a perfect &amp; 
                  •

                  •
               age; Chriſt
cōmandeth to preach the Goſpel, to al nations,
Mat: 8. &amp; therfore he gaue thē the gift of all
tongues,Act: 2. that they might preach to euery
nation in their owne tongue. Others alſo

                  •
               oyne with ye
                Papiſts, which by any meanes
ſ
                  •

                  •
               ppe the free courſe of
the Goſpell: ſuch were the Phariſes, whom
Chriſt threatneth, ſaying, Woe be to you
ſcribes &amp; Phariſes, hypocrites, becauſe you
ſhut vp the kingdom of heauē b
                  •
               fore men,Mat: 23. 13.
for you your ſelues go not in, neither ſuffer
you thē that would enter to come in. And
in an other place it is ſaid,Luk. 11. 52. that they had taken
frō the people the key of knowledge:
ſuch were the wicked &amp; malicious Iewes,
who killed the Lord Ieſus, &amp; their owne
Prophets,1. Theſ: 2. 15. 16. and perſecuted the Apoſtles,
and forbad them to preach to the gentiles,
that they might be ſaued, to fulfill their

ſinnes alwaies, for the wrath of God is
come on them to the vtmoſt. Such a one
was Alexander the copper Smith, of whō
S. Paul ſaith, That he had done him much
euill:2. Tim: 4. 14. 15. the Lord reward him according to
his workes: of whom be thou ware alſo, for
he withſtood our preaching ſore. Againe,
this alſo ſerueth to reprooue all thoſe
which may heare and will not, ſuch are all
Recuſants, Papiſticall, or Anabaptiſticall,
which refuſe to come to our aſſemblies,
and will not be partakers with vs, either of
the word or Sacraments: they haue other
meetings, &amp; haue gathered to themſelues
other kinde of teachers, and haue made
quite ſeparation from vs, and yet without
any iuſt cauſe or reaſon: and the true meſſengers
of wiſedome, doe truly deliuer the
doctrine of ſaluation, ſpeaking in ſinceritie
as of God, in the ſight of God, caſting from
them the cloakes of ſhame,2. Cor: 4. 2. neither handling
the word of God deceitfully, but in
declaration of the truth, approuing themſelues,
to the conſciences of all good men.
There be many worthie mē in our Church,
of excellent gifts and graces, whoſe miniſtrie
hath beene powerfull, to call many
thouſands, from ſinne and error, to truth
and holines: to the conuerſion and ſauing

of ſoules: Our Church holdeth the
true foundation, it ſetteth it ſelfe, by doctrine
and ſword, againſt all heretickes: it
hath bredde many worthy Martyrs, it is a
true witnes, keeper, interpreter, and tranſlator
of the holy ſcripture: it is an helper
and harbourer of the Saints: and it doth
truely call vpon the name of the true
God, and hath the true word and Sacrament,
the eſſentiall markes of the true
Church. What cauſe then is there of ſeparation
from vs? though there be great
oddes, betwixt theſe two kindes of Recuſants,
the one in greater degree of error
then the other. Yet we dare bouldly
ſay to them both, as Saint Paul ſaith
to the Corinthians,2. Cor▪ 11. 4. who began to contemne
their Apoſtle Paul, and to get other
teachers; If he that commeth ſaith Paul,
preacheth an other Ieſus then him whom
wee haue preached, or if you receiue
an other ſpirit then that which you haue
receiued, either an other Goſpell then
that you haue receiued,Gal: 1. 
                     •
                  . 
                     •
                  . ye might well
haue ſuffred him. As if he ſhould ſay, If any
man can preach a better Ieſus, a better
Goſpell, a better ſpirit, they might hearken
to him, but indeed none could doe it. And
therfore he ſaith in an other place, Though

that wee, or an Angell from heauen, preach
vnto you otherwiſe thē that which we haue
preached vnto you, let him be accurſed: As
we ſaid before, ſo ſay I now againe: If any
man preach vnto you otherwiſe then that
you haue receiued, let him bee accurſed.
We preach the true Ieſus▪ according to the
ſcriptures, that there is no Name vnder heauen
that wee can be ſaued by but by him:
that hee is both true God and man; that he
is the King, the Prieſt, and Prophet of his
Church: we preach the true Goſpell, containing
the doctrine of Faith and Repentance.
To this doctrine is ioyned the true
ſpirit, the ſpirit of Adoption, the ſpirit of
boldnes, of comfort, and ſanctif
                  •
               cation: If
any of them can teach a better Ieſus, a better
Goſpel, a better ſpirit, we will harken to
them: The Papiſts they teach &amp; hold many
things corruptly of Chriſt Ieſus the ſonne
of God, ouerthrowing the power, and ende
of his comming, and derogating from him
the glory of our owne, and full redemption;
by their Maſſe, and manie Mediators, they
aboliſh the Prieſthood of Chriſt, by the
Popes ſupremacie, making him the vniuerſall
head of the Church: they diminiſh, diſhonor,
and quite ouerthrow the Kingly Office
of Chriſt, by their owne Inuentions,

and vaine Traditions: they take away his
Propheticall office: their Goſpell is full of
ſuperſtition and Idolatrie, adding and diminiſhing
at their pleaſure: making newe
Articles, and new Sacraments: their ſpirit
is a ſpirit of Error, of Ignorance, of doubting,
and torment. But to let theſe goe, and
to come to the other;
            It may be
                  •
                (ſome will ſay) that they hold
the ſame Ieſus, and Goſpell with vs; Let it
be graunted that they and wee agree in all
matters concerning Faith and ſaluation, as
it may appeare by their owne confeſſion of
Faith, wherin there is nothing, that is ſound
and Orthodoxall, but they receiued it from
vs: Many of them, ſpecially of their founders,
and firſt beginners, were bredde and
borne amongſt vs; they had their faith, if
they haue any: their knowledge, the word
and Sacramēts from vs; they confeſſe, they
holde the ſame things with vs, and other
Churches, touching matters of Faith; the
more ſhame for them, to flie and run away
from vs, as though they had ſome better
Ieſus, ſome better Goſpell then wee haue:
where as all may ſee, that they haue no other:
And therefore their ſeparation is
moſt vnkinde and ridiculous. Let the beſt
reformed churches in the world, who haue

giuen vs the right hands of fellowſhip. Let
them (I ſay) be Iudges between vs &amp; them:
or let the ſcriptures thēſelues, truly opened
&amp; applied, be the true touch-ſtone &amp; triall
betweene vs. Let them ſhew &amp; bring forth
one ſcripture, commanding, or one holy example
approuing, ſuch a ſeparation, from
ſuch a church, from ſuch miniſters, holding,
profeſſing, &amp; teaching that which they do:
from whēce, you your ſelues, haue receiued
all the good things which you holde, maintaine,
or profeſſe, in matters of Religion.
So that you might ſay as Carneados a Philoſopher
was woont to ſay of his Maiſter
and reader Chriſippus; If it had not bene
for Chriſippus, I neuer had bene any body.
So might you ſay, If the pride of your heart
will ſuffer you: If it had not beene for the
church of Englād, many of you could neuer
haue had, Bible, Faith, nor knowledge, in
the matters of your ſaluation.
            Now you doe very ill requite the fathers
that begot you, the mother that bare you,
thus to flie from them, to accuſe, ſlaunder,
reuile, and curſe them. Herein you deale,
as Ariſtotle dealt with his maiſtar Plato;
who hauing gotten great Learning from
his maſter, did after oppoſe himſelf againſt
him, and by all meanes ſought his diſgrace

and diſcredit: Therfore Plato was wont to
call Ariſtotle a Mule; becauſe when ſhee
hath filled her ſelf with her mothers milke,
ſhe will beate her damme with her heeles.
            Plato ſignified by this, the ingratitude of
Ariſtotle; for when he had receiued from
Plato the principles of Phyloſophie, and
encreaſe of knowledge therein, he became
enemy to the ſchoole of Plato; and with his
Familiers and Schollers, did alwayes contend
and ſtriue againſt Plato. If the dealing
of theſe men bee not as harde and vnkinde
againſt our Church, let any reaſonable
&amp; indifferent men iudge: And are they
not too neere like the Viper, who gnaweth
out the dammes bellie, and ſo liueth by the
death of her damme? But of the vnthankfulnes
of theſe men, to God, their Prince,
and this Church, we ſhall ſpeake of it in an
other place; For this time I referre them to
the iudgment of two worthy men, writing
iointly vpon the 13. chap: of the Prouerbs,
13. verſe, the words are theſe: He that deſpiſeth
the word ſhall be deſtroyed: but he
that feareth the commandement, hee ſhall
be rewarded. This ſentence (ſay they) will
preſſe ſo vpon the Browniſts, who are become
bitter deſpiſers of the Miniſtrie of Ieſus
Chriſt, by ſeparating themſelues from

the Churches of God, and deprauing all the
holy meanes of ſaluation; howſoeuer they
pretēd to ſtand for ſinceritie, yet they reſiſt
it: &amp; taking vpon them to be chāpions for
Chriſt his kingdom, they fight againſt it: &amp;
though their argumēts ſeeme to be grounded
on the word, yet being well ſifted, they
proue meere falacies &amp; haue no agreement
with the meaning of the holy Ghoſt, in the
word, they are ſtrongly illuded by Sathan,
and made his Agents; (as much as may be)
to 
                  〈◊〉
                the right wayes of the Lord.
            Finally, this Doctrine, that happineſſe
conſiſteth in the right hearing of wiſdome,
it maketh directly againſt all contemners &amp;
mockers: ye
                  •
               , againſt all vnprofitable and
vnfruitfull hearers. There hee ſome in the
Church, which doe heare ſometimes, &amp; yet
are no friends to wiſdome: but either open

men are in moſt fearfull and curſed ſtate, for
their contēpt is not againſt man, but againſt
himſelfe: He that deſpi
                  •
               eth theſe things, deſpiſeth
not man, but God, who hath giuē vs
his holy ſpirit. Theſe men, they will not beleeue,
they haue no part in the promiſes of
grace and ſaluation: they liue in Gods diſpleaſure,
they expoſe thēſelues to his curſe,
both temporall and 
                  •
               ternall; and therefore

our Lord ſaith: That whereas hee had ſent
to his people Meſſengers, riſing early, and
ſending, and they mocked the Meſſengers
of God,2 Chron. 
                     •
                  6▪ 15. 16. deſpiſe his words, and miſvſed his
Prophets, that his wrath ſhould riſe againſt
them, and there was no remedie, he could
for 
                  •
               eare no longer, hee muſt needes puniſh
them.
            And to ſuch contemners, our Sauiour
Chriſt threatens,Matt. 21. That the kingdom of God
ſh
                  •
               lbe taken away from them, and giuen to
a Nation which ſhall bring forth the frutes
therof.Acts. 13. 46. And the Apoſtles, Paul, &amp; Barnabas,
ſpake boldly to ſuch contemners; &amp; ſaid: It
was neceſſary that the word of God ſhould
firſt haue bin ſpoken to you, that is, to the
Iews) but ſeeing you put it frō you, &amp; iudge
your ſelues vnworthy of euerlaſting life, loe
we turne to the Gentiles;Prou: 1. 20. 21. 22. 23. 24. 
                     〈◊〉
                  . and let vs heare
the voyce of wiſdome; who crieth without,
&amp; vttereth her voyce in the ſtreets, ſhe calleth
in the high ſtreets, in the preaſe, in the
entring of the gates &amp; vttereth her wordes
in the Citie, ſaying; O ye fooliſh, how long
will ye loue fooliſhnes? &amp; the ſcornfull take
their pleaſure in ſcorning, &amp; the fooles hate
knowledge? (turne you at my correction,
Loe I will powre out my minde vnto you,
(and make you vnderſtand my wordes,)

becauſe I haue called, and yee refuſed; I
haue ſtretched forth mine hand, and none
would regard: but ye haue deſpiſed all my
counſell, and would none of my correction;
I will alſo laugh at your deſtruction,
and mocke when your feare commeth,
when your feare commeth like ſudden deſolation,
and your deſtruction come like a
whirlewinde: when affliction and anguiſh
ſhall come vpon you, then ſhall they call
vpon me, but I will not anſwere: they ſhall
ſeeke me early, but they ſhall not finde me:
becauſe they hated knowledge, and did
not chooſe the feare of the Lord: they
would none of my counſell, but deſpiſed
all my correction: therefore ſhal they eate
the fruite of their owne way, and be filled
with their owne deuiſes. In the which
place, we may plainely obſerue a proofe
and teſtimonie of the mercie and iuſtice of
God: his mercie in calling and inuiting to
wiſedomes feaſt▪ ſuch as be vnworthie,

                  •
               uch as be contemners, enemies and ſcoffers,
yet he doth intreat them, and earneſtly
deſire them to leaue their follie, and to
be partakers of true wiſedome: but then
followeth his ſeueritie and iuſtice againſt
ſuch as deſpiſe and contemne his louing
and kinde offer. The wiſedome of all wiſedome,

proteſteth and voweth, that he will
hau
                  •
                no pittie of ſuch, but rather will take
delight to deſtroy them: Nay, he proteſteth,
that though they cry and call vpon
him in their greateſt extremitie, yet he will
not heare them: the reaſon is, becauſe they
haue ſo long contemned his great mercies,
that their hearts are hardned they cannot
repent: therefore God cannot heare, for
he heareth not the prayers of impenitent
ſinners. Againe, theſe men haue no faith,
and therefore cannot be heard, for faith is
grounded vpon Gods word, which they
deſpiſe, contemne, and mocke. A like heauie
ſentēce hath Salomon in another place,Pro. 28. 9.
ſaying, He that turneth away his eare from
hearing the law, euen his prayer ſhalbe abominable:
not onely the ſinnes and wicked
deeds of cōtemners and wicked men,
but thoſe which ſeeme moſt good, and
haue greateſt ſhew of holineſſe, are odious
in Gods ſight: the ſacrifice of the wicked
are abomination to the Lord: the prayers
that they make, though neuer ſo earneſtly
in their moſt neede, though it be in the
houre of death, the Lord will not heare
them, but reiect and abhorre them. And is
it not great reaſon and equitie, he doth but
ſerue them as they ſerue him; they wil not

heare him, when he calleth and cryeth to
them by the mouth of his Miniſters: and
why ſhould he heare them, when they call
and cry in their greateſt neceſſities? and
heauie are the threatnings of the Apoſtle:
If the words ſpoken by Angels were ſtedfaſt,
and euery tranſgreſſion and diſobedience
receiued a iuſt recōpence of reward,
how ſhould wee eſcape, if wee neglect ſo
great a ſaluation, which at the firſt began
to be preached of the Lord, and afterward
was confirmed vnto vs by them that heard
him,Hebr. 2. 2. 4. God bearing witnes therto, both with
ſignes &amp; wonders, &amp; with diuers miracles
&amp; gifts of the holy Ghoſt, according to his
own wil.Hebr. 10. 28. 29 And in another place he ſaith, He
that deſpiſeth Moſes lawe dyeth without
mercy, vnder two or 3. witneſſes: of how
much ſorer puniſhment ſuppoſe ye ſhall he
be worthie, which treadeth vnder foot the
Son of God?Hebr. 12. 25. Againe, See that you deſpiſe
not him that ſpeaketh, for if they eſcaped
not which refuſe him that ſpake on earth,
meaning Moſes, who ſpake rudely in cōpariſon
of Chriſt, much more ſhall we not eſcape,
if we turne away from him that ſpeaketh
frō heauen. But not only contemners
are here reproued, but alſo idle &amp; vnprofitable
hearers: many are in the ſchoole of

wiſedome, no enemies, no contemners, but
frier
                  •
               ds &amp; well-willers, they thinke well, &amp;
they ſpeake well, &amp; like well of the meanes
of ſaluation, they commend it, they heare
dayly, &amp; ſeeme greatly to ioy in it, yet they
profit litle, either in knowledge or ſanctification.
But it is not ſimplie a bleſſing to
heare wiſedome, except we be better by
it: nay, it is rather a woe then a bliſſe, to
be vnder the meanes, and to profit litle or
nothing by it.Aug. de Mor. ecc▪ Cath. There be, ſayeth a Father,
three degrees of woe, He that hath not
that he loueth, cannot be ſayd to be bleſſed;
neither he that hath that he loueth,
if his loue be hurtfull to him: neither he
that hath that which is good and profitable,
if he loueth not that which he hath:
ſo
                  •
               e deſire the Miniſtrie, and haue no
meanes to come by it: this is a woe: ſome
loue ſuperſtition, Idolatrie, ignorance, and
they doe enioy it, they haue ſuch blinde
guides as they like of; this is a greater wo:
ſome are vnder good Miniſters, yet they
profit little by it, theſe are not happie, but
in a fearefull ſtate. It is a grieuous ſinne
not to profit according to the time and
meanes: it is an vnkindnes and iniurie offred
to Chriſt, it bringeth outward iudgement▪
at leaſt ſpirituall: it doth bring vpon

vs the ſpirit of ſlumber, ſecuritie, and benummednes
of conſcience: there is a curſe
and iudgement vpon the eares and ſoules
of ſuch: they are like vnto the ground that
is continually dreſt and tilled, in good order,
and ſowne with good ſeed, and yet
bringeth foorth no good fruite. All will
confeſſe, ſuch a ground to be very bad and
curſed. And the holie Ghoſt ſayth the like▪
That the earth which drinketh in the raine
that commeth often vpon it, and bringeth
forth hearbs meet for them by whom it is
dreſſed, receiue the bleſſing of God: but
that which beareth thornes and briers is
reproued, and is neere to curſing, whoſe
end is to be burned.Math. 13. 23. And our Sauiour
Chriſt teacheth in the Parable of the ſeed,
That the good and bleſſed ground bringeth
forth good fruite, ſome an hundreth
fold, ſome ſixtie fold, ſome thirtie fold:
ſo they which heare with a good and honeſt
heart, doe alſo keepe the word, and
bring forth fruite with patience. An vnprofitable
hearer offendeth againſt God,
who cryeth dayly to him, yet he will not
heare him to any purpoſe; who doth kindlie
viſit him, but he will not receiue and entertaine
him with ſuch comfort and fruite
as he ought: they offend againſt their teachers

in diſcrediting and greeuing them,
making all their labour and trauell as much
as in them lyeth to be in vaine: they doe
an iniurie to themſelues, being ſtill ignorant,
whereas they might haue had knowledge;
being profane, whereas they might
haue had ſome meaſure of holines: the
grace which they haue, if they haue any,
it decayeth and dyeth, and is taken away
from them; for God doth take away his
gifts from thoſe, which vſe them not aright,
and haue no care to encreaſe them:
they drawe vpon themſelues, diuers puniſhments
from God, as we hard before.
Nay theſe vnfruitfull hearers they offend
the Church, they do no little wrong to it,
becauſe they are vnprofitable members,
and can doe no good to others: whereas
we are borne not for our ſelues, but for others,
we ſhould ſo profit, that we ſhould
be able to teach our families, to comfort,
admoniſh, and edifie one an other: yea w
                  •
               
ſhould be examples of vertue and pietie to
others, and growe daily in grace, and in
the knowledge of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt:
the cauſes why men profit not, are theſe;
they haue not repented of ſinnes paſt, but
they are withholden by ſome ſpeciall ſin,
or elſe they are not perſwaded of the truth

of Gods holy word; or elſe they are careleſſe
what become of thē after this life; or
elſe they are dulled with the cares &amp; pleaſures
of this world; or elſe they neglect
prayer, hearing, reading, conference, and
other holy priuate exerciſes; or elſe they
haue ſome proud conceit of themſelues,
that they know enough, and are holy enough
alreadie, and need no more; or
elſe they haue th
                  •
                curſe of a ſtonic and
hard heart; or elſe they are drawne away
and hindred by bad counſell or company:
theſe be the pull-backes and hindrances
which keepe men backe from profiting in
the ſchoole of wiſedome.
         
         
            
            THE THIRD
SERMON.
            FRom this worthy ſentence of a moſt
worthy and gratious woman, we haue
alreadie, deliuered and handled, this
worthy doctrine, namely, that the chiefe
felicitie of this life, conſiſteth in hearing
and obeying true wiſedome: this we haue
largely confirmed and proued, and haue
made ſome vſe of it: gathering from hence
as a neceſſarie conſequence, the miſerable
&amp; wretched eſtate of ſuch as are deſtitute
of this wiſdome, of ſuch as ſeeke to hinder
and ſtoppe it, of ſuch as refuſe to heare it, of
ſuch as are contemners and mockers, and
of ſuch alſo, as are idle and vnprofitable
hearers: and yet ſtill we are to make ſome
further vſe of this doctrine, it ſerueth directly,
to reproue &amp; confute the vanity and
follie of ſuch as repoſe their chiefe felicitie,
either in carnal wiſdome, or in the glory of
the world, or in riches, or in pleaſures: Of
al theſe we haue ſpokē ſomething already,

yet let vs ſay ſomething more of the two
latter, namely riches and pleaſures: becauſe
moſt men doe repoſe true happines
in them: this is taken as a principle, that
thoſe are the happieſt men in the world,
which abound in wordly wealth, &amp; ſpend
their whole life, in mirth and Iollitie, in
earthly delights, and carnall Ioyes, but the
vanitie of theſe men ſhall eaſily appeare, if
true wiſedome may be iudge; Trauell not
too much to be rich, ſaith the wiſe man,
but ceaſe from thy wiſedome:Pro: 23. 3. Wilt thou
caſt thine eyes vpon that which is nothing?
for riches taketh her to her wings, as an
Eagle, and flyeth into the heauen. His meaning
is, that riches are of ſmall reckoning
and account, and that they are vncertaine,
flitting and fading, therefore there can be
no true happines in them. In an other
place, he doth handle this more largely, He
that loueth ſiluer ſaith he, ſhall not be ſatiſfied
with ſiluer; and he that loueth riches,
ſhall be without the fruit thereof. His
meaning is, that ſuch as repoſe their happines
in riches, are not happy but miſerable:
becauſe they are like vnto ſuch as are
alwaies thirſtie and hungrie, and neuer ſatisfied:
he ſetteth downe many other miſeries
of ſuch men, that they haue not ſo

much as the fruit of their riches, becauſe
they dare not vſe, that which they haue,
they are tormēted with the deſire of more:
In the middeſt of all their wealth, they
want as well that which they haue, as that
which they haue not; and the more they
haue, the more they are to maintaine; as
ſeruants, friends, and many paraſites and
flatterers: and this miſerie alſo is incident
to ſuch, that they do ſo much thinke of gathering
and keeping their riches, that they
cannot haue ſo ſweete reſt and ſleepe as
many a poore man hath, their thoughts are
troubled, thinking ſometimes how to deceiue
others, and how others may deceiue
thē: they are in continuall feare of theeues,
robbers, of fire and water, and of other
danger and loſſes; they are troubled in
their minds, thinking how badly they haue
gotten their riches, and how badly they
hold and vſe them: their riches turne to
their owne hurt and deſtruction, being occaſions
to them, of pride, couetouſnes, prodigalitie,
and licentiouſnes, and ſometimes
very ruine of body &amp; ſoule. Theſe riches
are ſpent &amp; conſumed, by many waies, by
dilicate &amp; daintie fare, by coſtly apparell,
by ſmptuous buildings, by gaming, by
whoredome, by buying, by ſelling, by lawing;

how many waies are riches ſpent and
conſumed, by fire, by water, by warres, by
theeues, by vnskilfull and vnfaithfull Phyſitions,
by prodigall wiues, and prodigall
children, by negligēt &amp; vntruſtie ſeruants;
and thus riches periſh by euill trauell. This
is alſo an other miſerie, that they leaue the
owner, he can take nothing with him; he
knoweth not how ſoone he muſt leaue thē,
he hath heapt vp riches, and cannot tell
who ſhall gather them: it may be, neither
child nor friend, but his enemie; he that
hath not contented himſelfe, with many
Lordſhips and countries, he that hath ioyned
houſe to houſe, land to land, then a little
peece of ground will ſerue his turne. By
ſuch reaſons doth Salomon proue the miſerie
of riches:

                     •
                  3. 14. 15. 16. and he concludeth, that the
whole life of the rich man is miſerable, ſaying;
All his dayes he eateth in darkenes,
with much griefe, &amp; ſorrow &amp; anger. Finally,
riches are deceitfull and dangerous,
they hinder vs from Gods kingdome, they
drawe our heart to them, and make it as a
captiue and ſlaue; they ouerloade &amp; preſſe
vs with cares, they make vs faint-harted,
and fearefull cowards, to endure any thing
for the Goſpell of Chriſt: they often hinder
vs,
and keepe vs backe frō wiſedomes

Schoole: and though wee come thither, yet
they doe choake the ſeede of the Word in
vs. Therefore there is no true Happineſſe
in them.
            Thoſe bee true Riches,Aug. ſuper Math. Greg: in Ho: which when
wee haue them, wee cannot looſe them:
Earthly ſubſtance compared to Eternall felicity,
is no helpe, but a burden: This life
compared with Eternall life, is rather to be
called death then life.
            The ſonnes of Adam (ſaith Bernard) are
a couetous generation; What haue you to
doe with earthly Riches,Berr: in Ser. 4. which are neither
true riches, nor yet yours? Gold and
Siluer, is red and white Earth, which the
error of man doth make and account more
precious; And if they be yours, take them
with you when you die.
            It is a true ſaying of theſe Earthly riches,
Hic gig
                     •
                  untur, Hic amittuntur, Hic
dimi
                     •
                  tuntur. Heere they are gotten: here
they are loſt, and heere they are left.
            Thoſe then, which repoſe Felicitie in
Riches, haue neither true Wiſedome, nor
true Happineſſe, nor true Riches: They
are as much deceiued, which put anie
happineſſe in Earthly pleaſures. Some
of theſe are Carnall,Prou: 10. 23. and wicked, and
haue their beginning from Hell.
            
               
Of this ſpeaketh Salomon,Pro. 10. 23. when he ſaith:
It is a paſtime for a Foole to doe wickedly.
And of this ſpeaketh Eſaiah, when hee
ſaith:Eſa. 22. 12. 13. The Lorde calleth to weeping and
mourning, and beholde ioy and gladnes;
ſlaying Oxen, and killing ſheepe: eating
fleſh, drinking wine; Eating and drinking,
for tomorrow we ſhall die.
            Of this ſpeaketh our Sauiour CHRIST,
when hee ſaith; Woe bee to you that now
laugh,Luk. 12. 
                     •
                  5. for you ſhall waile and weepe. In
ſuch pleaſures the rich man liued in the goſpell:
all his life time vpon earth, but after
death,Luk. 16. 25. his ſoule was tormented in Hell.
The Apoſtle ſaith of the wanton widdowe,
that ſhee liuing in pleaſure,1. Tim. 5. 6. was dead while
ſhee liued: and indeed, thoſe which were
moſt liuely and luſty in theſe pleaſures, are
but dead men in grace and goodnes.
            But to let theſe ſinfull pleaſures paſſe,
wherein yet manie, too wholie ſpend their
time, and count it their chiefe Felicitie:
And to come to honeſt, lawfull, and ciuill
pleaſures, yet there is no true Felicitie
in them: Let the beſt, the greateſt,
ioye and delight bee named, yet it is but
tranſiorie; It is not true and perfect ioy;
It doth not ſatisfie and content vs. After
wee haue it, we loath it; It is common

both to good &amp; euill; It doth leade to
corruption, &amp; it doth oftētimes cauſe grief
and ſorrow: The other pleaſures, indeed
they come from hel, and theſe are but from
the earth: They are but pettie ioyes, bitter
ſweetings, ſeeming Ioyes, earthly and baſtardly
ioyes, in compariſon of true and
perfect ioy: we are not borne to ſpend our
time in mirth &amp; ioy, but rather to mourne
and lament,Mat: 5. 4. in reſpect of our ſinnes and
miſeries: Bleſſed are they which mourne
ſaith Chriſt, for they ſhall be comforted:
and they that ſowe in teares, for they ſhall
reape in ioy: and there is a godly ſorrow
that leadeth vs to repentance, and ſo to
ſaluation: the true way to godly ioy, is to
feele godly ſorrow. Oh that we would remember
the greatnes and the multitude of
our ſinnes, the certaintie of death, the vncertaintie
of the houre of it, the account
that we are to make in that great day, the
manifold duties that we owe, and are to
performe to God, to the Church, to the
common-wealth, to our countrie, to our
families and others: and the remembrance
of theſe things no doubt, would abate,
reſtraine and moderate our lawfull pleaſures:
1. Cor: 7. 31. 32. Let them that reioyce, be as though
they reioyced not: and they that vſe this

world, as though they vſed it not: for the
faſhion of this world paſſeth away.
            Loue not this world ſaith S. Iohn,1. Iohn. 2. 15. 16. 17. neither
the things that are in the worlde; If
any man loue the world, the loue of the Father
is not in him: For all that is in the
worlde (as the luſt of the Fleſh, the luſt of
the Eyes, and the Pride of life) is not of the
Father, but is of the worlde, and the world
paſſeth away, and the luſts thereof: but he
that fulfilleth the will of God, abideth for
euer.
            The glorie of this worlde (ſaieth one) is
deceitfull,Bern: in epiſt. 3. ad Soth: and is worthily refuſed: It is
but like the flower of Graſſe, and a vapour
appearing for a time; In what ſtate ſo euer
of this life, there is more griefe then
pleaſure; whileſt thou doeſt reuenge, defend,
enuie, ſuſpect: whileſt thou doeſt alwayes
loue that which thou haſt not: and
hauing gotten ſomething, thy deſire is
not diminiſhed; What reſt is there in
thy glorie? If there bee anie, the ioye
paſſeth away, not returning againe, and
thy griefe remaineth, which will neuer
leaue thee.
            Oh wicked worlde: who doeſt wont
ſo to bleſſe thy onely Friendes, that thou
doeſt make them the enemies of God.
            
               
There is ſmall ioy to a man, when hee ſeeth
his Neighbours houſe on Fier. Hee is
vaine which ſpendeth the dayes of his Repentance
in pleaſure: when he ſeeth daylie
before his eyes, both his Friendes and
others to die, and ſo ſeeth that Death is
certaine: Is hee not vaine then, that (forgetting
the feare of God) doeth giue himſelfe
to vaine delights?
            Parents do more grieue then ioye, when
they ſee their Childe borne, and die in
one day: The ioy of this worlde is ſhort,
It is a fooliſh thing to delight in our owne
Fooliſhnes. It is a vaine thing to fill our
hearts with delights, which are ended, before
they beginne.
            It is a vaine ioye of the Byrdes, in the
middeſt of Nettes, Trappes, and Snares,
ſet for them: And it is a fooliſh thing in
the Fiſhes, to delight in the bayte of the
hooke, which bringeth preſent ſorrow and
death. And they are as vaine as thoſe vnreaſonable
creatures, which glorie in the
vaine delights of this world; Seeing that
Death is ſo neere them.
            The very Heathen haue proued, and
mocked this follie of men; Some ſaying:
That we come into the world weeping;
we goe out of the worlde wailing:

And yet we liue heere laughing: others, ſaying,
that the deſire of pleaſures are griefe,
that the fulnes of pleaſure is full of repentings;
that the end of pleaſures is heauy and
grieuous:Senec. ep. 28. that if any may be counted bleſſed
for them, then the beaſts alſo may bee
counted bleſſed. What enemie is ſo iniurious
or contumelious, as the pleaſures of
ſome are to them? Many are ſo drowned
in pleaſures, that they are brought to a cuſtome,
and cannot want them, which for
this cauſe are moſt miſerable, becauſe they
haue made thoſe things moſt neceſſary,
which are ſuperfluous: therefore they ſerue
their pleaſures, and doe not enioy them;
they loue their euils, which is the chiefe of
all euill. Another ſayeth, that true ioy is
not poſſeſſed, vnleſſe peace and righteouſnes
be kept and holden:Aug. ſup. pſ. 52. The firſt is as it
were the roote, that is righteouſnes: the ſecond
is peace, the third is ioy: from righteouſnes
proceedeth peace, from peace proceedeth
ioy, they reioyce in temporall
things, which haue not learned to deſire eternall
things,Chryſo. de repaſ. lap. If we liſt to giue our ſelues
to pleaſures, a hundreth yeeres, yea adde
another hundreth, and if thou liſt ten hundreth
more, what is this to the reward of eternity?
is not all the time of this life, wherin

we ſeeme to enioy pleaſures, &amp; ſerue our
luſts,Aug lib. 9. Confeſ. but the ſleepe of one night, in compariſon
of eternitie? There is a ioy which is
not giuen to the wicked, but to them ô
Lord which doe willingly worſhip thee:
whoſe ioy thou thy ſelfe art; and this is the
true bleſſed life, to reioyce of thee, and for
thee: this and no other is true bleſſedneſſe,
but of the vanitie of theſe men, which repoſe
felicity, either in humane wiſedome,
or in the glory of the world, in riches, or
pleaſures, we haue partly ſpoken before.
And let Salomon deſide and determine this
matter, both by his ſentence and example;
he pronounceth of all theſe things, Vanitie
of vanities, vanities, of vanities, all is vanitie:
If he had but thus ſpoken, in his wiſedome,
being diuine and inſpired, we ſhould
beleeue him, and reſt vpon his iudgement,
but he ſpeaketh alſo vpon experience and
proofe. If a poore man had ſpoken it, we
might haue reiected his iudgement, as one
that neuer taſted the excellencie of riches
and pleaſures: but it is ſpoken by Salomon,
a famous and worthy king, who excelled
and abounded in all wiſedome, glory,
wealth, and pleaſures: hauing taſted of all,
he proteſteth and crieth out, that all is vanity.
And marke what one ſayth of that ſentence:

If thoſe ſayeth he,Chryſoſt. ſup. Mat. Ho. 30. which are occupied
in power and riches, they would write
this verſe vpon all their walles, vpon their
houſes, vpon their dores and gates, and
ſpecially if they would write it in their
conſciences, that they might alwayes haue
it before their eyes, and feele it in their
heart, that all is vanitie. And thus wee ſee
ſundrie enemies oppoſites to wiſedome,
we ſee the miſerable eſtate of ſuch as want
her, of ſuch as deſpiſe her, and repoſe their
happines in other things: And howſoeuer
many be againſt her, and ſhe hath but few
faithfull friends, and few doe reſpect or regard
her as they ought, but prefer moſt
baſe and vile things before her, yet is this
wiſdome iuſtified of all her childrē. Now
let vs come to ſome further vſes of this doctrine,
for the inſtruction and comfort of
her friends and followers. Firſt then this
ſerueth for the inſtruction of the ſonnes &amp;
daughters of wiſedome, that with all diligence,
care, &amp; reuerence, they continually
hearken to true wiſedome. Though outward
hearing be not ſufficiēt, yet it is commended
as profitable and neceſſary, and as
meanes to conuey grace, knowledge, and
faith to the heart: and it is the chiefe end
why God hath giuen vs eares, euen thereby

to hearken to his voice. Without this
hearing, how ſhould we know God? how
ſhould we loue him? how ſhould we feare
and beleeue in him? Who ſo is among you
that feareth the Lord,Eſa. 50. 10. ſaith Eſaiah, let him
heare the voice of his ſeruant. Again, hearken
vnto me my people, &amp; giue eare vnto
me ô my people,Eſa. 51. 4. 7. hearken vnto me you that
know righteouſnes, the people in whoſe
heart is my law: we are readie to hearken
to fables, to heare hiſtories, to heare the letters
of our friends, &amp; the Proclamation of
Princes; and ſome are very ready and willing
to heare the Idolatrous Maſſe, &amp; ſhall
not we be more ready and willing to heare
the voyce of our God? The publike aſſemblies
are the ſchooles of wiſedome, wee
muſt like good ſchollers, with diligence
reſort thither, and be content both to
heare and learne: wee muſt like Cornelius,
heare with reuerence, whatſoeuer ſhal
be ſpoken from the mouth of God: wee
muſt with Lidea, giue attendance to Pauls
preaching: and wee muſt daily watch at
the gates of wiſedome, and giue attendance
at the poſtes of our doores: we muſt
willinglie neglect no time nor occaſion
that may ſerue for our inſtruction in this
ſchoole. But of this poynt, I will ſtand

no more, becauſe heeretofore in the commending
of wiſedome, we alledging manie
teſtimonies of holie Scripture; from
whence we may drawe ſufficient reaſons
and motiues, to ſtirre vs vp to carefull hearing.
Now I adde another vſe, that ſeeing
our felicity lyeth in wiſedome, we muſt not
only carefully heare it, but alſo loue it moſt
deerely, and eſteeme it, aboue all things elſe
whatſoeuer. Some there be diligent hearers,
but yet they doe not ſo highly eſteeme
of this wiſedome as they ſhould, neither
doe they ſhew the fruits of that loue which
this deſerueth: they thinke it good, but
not the chiefeſt good: but we are to loue
and eſteeme this wiſedome, not as an ordinary
or common thing, but as it is indeed,
the beſt and the chiefeſt of all things: preferring
it aboue all riches, pleaſures, or any
thing elſe in the world, be they neuer ſo
pleaſant, profitable, or excellent: eſteeming
this as moſt good, moſt neceſſary▪ and
that we had better want all the beſt things
in the world, then this; and who indeed
will not thus eſteeme of this felicity▪ being
the greateſt felicity of this life, and that
which will leade vs to eternall happines?
Such an account and eſtimation had the
wiſe man of it, when hee putteth it in the

firſt place,Pro: 3. &amp; preferreth it before all things.
Our Sauiour Chriſt counteth it the one
thing needfull,Pro: 4. and the good part that ſhall
be neuer taken from vs:Pro: 8 he compareth it
to a treaſure hid in the field,Luke. 10. and to a pearle
of great price,Mat: 13. 44▪4

                  .

                  . which when a man hath
found, for ioy thereof, he ſelleth all that he
hath and buyeth it. The bleſſed Apoſtle, he
eſteemeth all things elſe droſſe and dung,Phil. 
                     •
                  . 8.
in cōpariſon of this excellent knowledge:
ſo that our loue to this, it muſt be rare,
ſincere, and perfect, like our loue to God
himſelfe: and indeed ſo much as we loue
God, ſo much we loue his word; and as little
as we loue the one, ſo little we loue the
other. The ſpeciall note to proue our loue
to God is, our true loue to his word: now
where true loue is, there is hungring and
thirſting, and eager deſiring of that which
we loue; there is a delight and a ioy vnſpeakable
when we haue it. Wiſdome calleth
thoſe onely to be her gueſtes,Eſa▪ 55. 1. 
                     •
                  . 
                     •
                  . to be
partakers of her dainties, which do hunger
and thirſt after ſpirituall graces.Ioh: 7. The Prophet
Dauid ſaith of himſelfe,Pſ: 119. 20. My hart breaketh
for the deſire to thy iudgmēts alway.
Such a deſire as worldlings haue to their
riches, as voluptuous men haue to their
pleaſures, who are neuer ſatisfied; ſuch a

deſire I ſay haue the Saints of God to this
wiſedome. The kingdome of heauen ſaith
our Sauiour, frō the time of Iohn the Baptiſt
hitherto, ſuffreth violence, &amp; the violēt
take it by force; his meaning is, that the
hearts of men were then inflamed with an
earneſt zeale▪ and greedie deſire to heare
the word: they did not coldly &amp; for faſhion,
but with an earneſt &amp; violent affection,
follow &amp; ſeeke after this wiſdome: not the
idle &amp; careleſſe ſort, but ſuch as be ſpiritually
violent, take &amp; receiue the kingdome
of heauen: he that taketh any thing by violence,
he doth vehemently deſire it, &amp; will
not want it, &amp; vſeth all power &amp; indeuour
to obtaine it; neither doth he feare to expoſe
himſelfe &amp; all that he hath to danger,
ſo that he may enioy it: the matter then
being ſo waightie, it muſt not be lightly
deſired &amp; ſought for, but with great vehemencie
&amp; zeale. And therefore the Apoſtle
exhorteth,1. Pet. 2. 2. that as new borne babes, we
ſhould deſire the ſincere milk of the word,
that we may growe thereby. Infants they
deſire milke, &amp; that egerly, they cry &amp; yell
for it, nothing will ſtay them till they haue
it: &amp; their deſire is daily &amp; continuall. Such
deſires &amp; affections we muſt beare to true
wiſedome: &amp; as good foode is ſweet to the

hungry, when it is eaten, ſo is wiſedome to
the ſoule if it be inwardly receiued and digeſted:
there wil follow exceeding delight
and ioy, but becauſe moſt hearers profeſſe
their loue to the word, &amp; ſhew their loue
by deſiring it, &amp; delighting in it, as it may
ſeeme to the eyes of the world, let vs ſee
ſome further ſignes to approue our true
loue to wiſedome, &amp; the account that we
make of it: firſt then, they that truly loue &amp;
truly eſteeme this wiſedome, they muſt
needes loue the publike aſſemblies, and
ſpecially the publike miniſtrie and preaching
of wiſedome: ſome thinke it enough
to pray and read at home, but Gods ordinance
muſt bee acknowledged, priuate
duties muſt giue place to the publike:
this is the gate of heauen, the houſe
of God, the court of the Saints: here
ſhineth moſt clearely the louing countenance
and face of God in his temple.
Doth euery man ſpeake of his glory? O
Lord ſaith Dauid,Pſ: 26. 8. I haue loued the habitation
of thine houſe, and the place where
thine honour dwelleth. And againe, I reioyced
when they ſaid vnto me, we will
goe into the houſe of the Lord: he loued &amp;
ioyed in ſuch meetings, becauſe of Gods
preſence, becauſe of the ſacrifices and Sacraments,

they are miniſtred▪ &amp; for that he
had there the cōpany of Gods people, publike
&amp; ioynt prayers, &amp; the word of wiſedome,
there read &amp; expounded: and as this
was Dauids ioy &amp; practiſe being a worthy
Prophet and King, ſo it is ſaid in an other
place,Ezeck: 46. 10. that the Prince ſhall be in the midſt
of the aſſemblies, he ſhall goe in with the
people, &amp; when they goe forth, they ſhall
goe forth together. And as Salomon built
an houſe for God, &amp; confec
                  •
               ated it to holy
vſes, ſo he himſelfe reſorted thither, with
the Prieſts &amp; people, to offer publike ſeruice
to God. Chriſt himſelfe, the Apoſtles
&amp; Saints, did commonly frequent publike
aſſemblies: &amp; ſuch as contemne theſe, they
doe not reade nor vnderſtand aright: hauing
ſo many precepts &amp; preſidēts againſt
them. Others there be, which are content
to come to publike meetings, to prayer,
&amp; to the reading of the ſcriptures, but they
thinke this ſufficient, &amp; that they need no
more at all: as for preaching, they care little
for it; nay many do ſcorne and hate it:
theſe doe not rightly eſteeme or loue the
word; if they loued it read, they wold loue
it preached: &amp; the rather, ſeeing it is more
to edification: by preaching we are aſſured
of the authoritie of the ſcriptures; we better

vnderſtand them, many darke ſentēces
of ſcripture are explained,
                  
                     〈…〉
                  
                places which
ſeeme contrarie are recōciled; the hid treaſures
of wiſedome are layed open to our
further comfort: ſcriptures are applied to
time, place, perſons: affections are more
moued, many are called &amp; conuerted, ſuch
as are called, are further confirmed and increaſed,
by the power of preaching; for it
is ordained of God, not onely for conuerſion
of ſoules, but for confirmation, augmentation,
and continuance in grace, and
therefore moſt needfull for all perſons,1. Cor: 14. be
they neuer ſo wiſe, ſtrong or holie: theſe be
the ſpeciall prerogatiues &amp; priuiledges of
preaching. And therefore the Apoſtle accounteth
&amp; eſteemeth of it, as the moſt neceſſarie
and profitable gift in the Church:
the cauſe why men doe contemne &amp; hate
preaching is, becauſe they are in loue with
their ſinnes, which are diſcouered by it.
Therefore Aha
                  •
                hated Michaiah the Prophet,
as he confeſſeth,1. King. 22. 8. becauſe he prophecied
not good vnto him, but euill. Light is
come into the world, &amp; men loue darknes
more then light, becauſe their deeds are
euill: for euery man that euill doth, hateth
the light: neither commeth to light, leaſt
his deeds ſhould be reproued: but he that

doth truth commeth to the light,Iohn. 3. 19. 21. that his
deeds might be made manifeſt: that they
are wrought according to God. Againe,
they hate this light of preaching, and contemne
it, becauſe it is an enemie to their
carnalliberties ſincere &amp; ſound preaching
reproueth many delights, vanities, &amp; corruptions,
which fleſh and blood would
faine retaine &amp; nouriſh: and therefore carnall
men ſay, Let vs breake this bond, and
caſt this cord from vs: Let vs ſhake off
this yoake of Chriſt: but the godly do therfore
the more loue it, becauſe it doth reproue
their ſins, &amp; is an effectuall meanes
to bring them to true repentance &amp; mortification:
they loue the word read, &amp; they
loue it preached: reading is not to be neglected,
&amp; contemned, it is cōmended both
in the law &amp; the Goſpell: thereby we are
the better acquainted with the ſcriptures,
we are made thereby more profitable hearers;
reading helpeth our iudgements, affections
&amp; memories; preaching helpeth
reading, and reading helpeth preaching:
they that beſt loue preaching, and ſeeke
moſt for Sermons, if they doe it with right
affections, they read moſt, and with more
comfort and profit: All the parts of Gods
ſeruice are to be practiſed by a Chriſtian,

no part of his ſeruice is to be neglected or
contemned: this is an other ſure ſigne of
our true loue to wiſedome, often in ſecret
to meditate of it, to conferre of it with others,
to reade the word, or to cauſe it to
be read vnto vs: by theſe priuate exerciſes,
Dauid proueth his loue to the word,Pſ: 119. 97. as
we haue hard before: loue will drawe our
affection to ſpeake and thinke often of
that which we loue: this is a more ſure
ſigne then the other, it may be ſome are
drawne to publike meetings by feare, by
examples, by lawe, by cuſtome, but when
we are alone in priuate, or fewe with vs,
then to ſpeake of the word, then oftentimes
to thinke and muſe of it, euen in our
priuie chamber, this is a ſure ſigne of ſincere
loue. Againe, if we doe ſincerely loue,
and worthily praiſe this wiſedome, our
care and endeuour will be, to mainetaine
the dignitie and credit of wiſedome, by
our godly life and conuerſation: we muſt
be not onely profeſſors, but practitioners;
and how can they be ſaid to be the ſonnes
and daughters of wiſedome, which do follow
the examples and cuſtomes of follie?
theſe do ſtaine &amp; pollute their profeſſion,
&amp; are but like fooliſh builders, &amp; fooliſh
Virgines, not adorning the doctrine of

wiſedome, but diſhonouring it; Let your
conuerſation be ſuch ſaith the Apoſtle, as
it becommeth the Goſpell of Chriſt, that
which we loue, we ſeeke to credit, to beautifie,
and to honor it by all meanes we can:
we will not ſuffer it to be diſgraced or defiled
by our default. The very heathen will
not ſuffer their falſe Gods to be diſhonored
or defaced, by any: and ſhall we wilfully
diſhonor and diſcredit the excellencie
&amp; maieſtie of wiſdome, by our wicked
liues &amp; conuerſations?Ioh. 14. 23. If any man loue me
ſaith Chriſt, he will keep my words. Again▪
ye are my friends,Io: 15. 14. if you doe whatſoeuer I
command you▪ An other ſigne of our loue
and eſtimation to wiſedome, is to hate, deteſt,
and abhorre all falſehood &amp; follie, as
ſworne enemies to true wiſedome. I hate
vaine inuentions ſaith Dauid, but thy law
I do loue:Pſ▪ 119. 113. light and darknes, truth and lies,
wiſedome and follie, are oppoſite, they
cannot be reconciled. Elias and Baalls
Prieſts, Michiah and falſe Prophets, Amos
and Amaſias, the Arke of God and Dagon,
God and Baall, Iewes and Samaritans, Beleeuers
and Infidells, Papiſts and Proteſtants,
cannot agree together. In all the
booke of the Prouerbes, the wiſe man
and the foole, wiſedome and follie, are

oppoſed one againſt another: the ſonnes of
wiſedome, are the ſonnes of light: now
the nature of light is, to expell myſts and
cloudes, to diſcouer and reproue many vncleane
things, but it cannot be defiled with
any, and it hath no fellowſhip with vnfruitfull
workes of darkenes: Wiſedome is a
chaſte matron; folly and error is a harlot:
and therefore their muſt needs be diſcention
betwixt them: the friends of wiſdome
muſt needs flie and abhorre al ſeducers and
deceiuers.Pro 14. 
                     •
                  . Therefore ſayth Salomon, Depart
from the fooliſh man, when thou perceiueſt
not in him the lips of knowledge.
And againe,Pro. 15. 27. My ſonne heare no more the
inſtruction, that cauſeth to erre from the
words of knowledge. Though ſeducers be
ſubtill, and we are apt to erre, yet this is the
power and vſe of wiſedome, to keepe vs
ſound and ſafe from error: this wiſdome
doth build vs vp, in ſound faith and knowledge,
and doth make vs ſtable and conſtant,
and is a ſpeciall preſeruatiue againſt
the deceit and craftines of fooliſh and falſe
Prophets: Finally, another more ſure argument
of our tru
                  •
                loue to this wiſedome, euen
then to loue it, and moſt highly to
eſteeme of it, when it is generally diſgraced,
contemned and perſecuted of the

world: it is an eaſie matter to heare and
profeſſe it in the time of peace and proſpeitie,
when the profeſſion of it is commanded
and approued by the power of Princes:
wiſedome then hath many friends,
but the tryall of true loue and friendſhip is
then, when moſt men doe appoſe and ſet
themſelues againſt the profeſſion of wiſedome:
euen then to eſteeme it our felicitie,
euen then to loue it dearely, and defend
it: this I ſay is a true ſigne of loue indeed.
Such a loue had Dauid, when many
were enemies and perſecutors of the truth,
Princes ſayth he, did ſit and ſpeake againſt
me, but thy ſeruant did meditate in thy ſtatutes,
alſo thy teſtimonies are my delight
and my counſellers; the proud haue had
me exceedingly in deriſion, yet haue I not
declined from thy law. Againe, the bands
of the wicked haue robbed me, but I haue
not forgotten the law: the proud haue imagined
a lye againſt me, but I will keepe
thy precepts with my whole heart. The
profeſſion of wiſedome is not alwayes
peaceable, but oftentimes bringeth with
it hatred and contempt: our fleſh is enemie
to it, and Sathan doth trouble vs by
ſeducers and perſecutors: but wee muſt
ſtand firmely for the maintenance of the

truth, and defend this our felicitie, though
it be to the loſſe of life and liuing: men do
ſtriue &amp; contend for maintenance of their
riches, their freeholds, and liues, and ſhall
not we ſtand for defence of that, which is
better &amp; more worth then all theſe things?
If any man come to me ſayth Chriſt, and
hate not his father and mother, and wife
and children, and brethren and ſiſters, yea,
and his owne life alſo, he cannot be my diſciple.
His meaning is, that we muſt caſt off
all affections to our deareſt friends, which
draw vs from Chriſt. And in the ſame place
he doth teach vs, that when we begin our
profeſſion, we muſt make full account to
hazard our credit, goods and life for it, or
elſe our beginning is raſh and vnaduiſed,
and men will ſcorne vs fooles, becauſe we
began and could not make an end. The Apoſtle
commendeth the Theſſalonians,1. Theſ 1. 6. becauſe
they became followers of him and
of the Lord, and receiued the word in
much affliction, with ioy of the holy Ghoſt.
And in another place he ſayeth,Phil. 1. 29 that it was
giuen to the Philippians for Chriſts cauſe,
not onely to beleeue in him, but to ſuffer
for his ſake.Hebr. 11. 32, 33, 34. And the Hebrewes are commended,
becauſe after they had receiued
the light, they endured a great 
                  •
               ight in afflictions:

partly while they were made a
gazing-ſtocke, both by reproches, and afflictions:
and partly while they became
companions of them: for both you ſorrowed
ſayth he, for my bonds, and ſuffred
with ioy the ſpoiling of your goods, knowing
of your ſelues, how that you haue in
heauen a better, &amp; an enduring ſubſtance.
The laſt vſe that I make of the former doctrine,
is a comfort to the true ſonnes and
daughters of wiſedome. Their ſtate is moſt
happie and bleſſed, and they are in the
right way to eternall happines, they haue
many diſcomforts and diſcouragements in
the world, and are accounted of all other
moſt wretched and vnhappie. But what
need they care for the blind, raſh, and falſe
iudgement of men, ſeeing for this cauſe
the world knoweth vs not, becauſe it knoweth
not God: and the voice of wiſdome,
the voice of God and good men, doth pronounce
vs happie: and our owne conſcience
doth teſtifie to vs, that we walke in
the right path to euerlaſting bleſſednes.
Indeed the wicked they ſay, It is in vaine
to ſerue God: and what profit is it that we
haue kept his commandements,Mal. 3. 13. 14, 15, 16. &amp;c. and that
wee walke humbly before the Lord of
hoſtes? therefore we count the proud bleſſed,

euen they that worke wickednes are ſet
vp, and they that tempt God: yea, they are
deceiued. Then ſpake they that feared the
Lorde, euery one vnto his Neighbour, and
the Lorde hearkened, and heard it, and a
Booke of remembrance was written before
him, for them that feared the Lorde,
and thought vpon his Name: And they
ſhall be to mee (ſaith the Lord of Hoſtes) in
that day, that I ſhall doe this, for a Flocke:
and I will ſpare them, as a man ſpareth his
owne ſonne, that ſerueth him: Then ſhall
you returne, and diſcerne betweene the
righteous, and the wicked: betweene him
that ſerueth God, and him that ſerueth him
not. Againſt all blaſphemous, falſe, and
wicked ſpeeches of the worlde, let the
friends of wiſedome oppoſe for their comfort,
theſe ſweete words, and comfortable
promiſes of God, the Father and Founder
of wiſedome, and the defender, &amp; liberall
rewarder of all ſuch as truely loue it.
            And nowe before I paſſe to other
matter, (by your Patience,) in reſpect of
the premiſes: Let mee make ſome Application
to this Citie; God hath bleſt
you with many ſpeciall fauours and mercies
a long time, farre aboue and beyond
many other places: I will not ſpeake of

your outward Priuiledges, Freedomes, Donations,
order of gouernment, wherein, it
may be, you excell ſome others. But I will
ſpeak of your chiefeſt Priuiledge, the beautie
and Ornament of your Citie, and the
beſt flower of your Garden: and that is indeed,
the plentifull and ſincere preaching
of the Goſpell: In reſpect whereof, ſome
doe truly thinke, and ſay (with this woman)
Happy are you, which may daily heare ſuch
wiſedome; And they may truely ſay in reſpect
of ſo many heauenly viſions, This is
the houſe of God, this is the gate of heauen:
and though many other places, are in
ſome ſort, partakers of this happines, yet
but fewe are equall with you in this gracious
bleſſing.
            Firſt then, conſider how long a time you
haue had a certaine, ſetled, and reſident
miniſtrie, for the ſpace of no leſſe then fiftie
yeares; many in the meane time haue
beene deſtitute, as poore ſheepe without a
ſhepheard. Some haue had this meanes of
ſaluation very ſeeldome: and ſometimes
interrupted, and eclipſed.
            O happy are you, that haue had ſo great
a bleſſing, ſo many yeares continued; and
the greater bleſſing it is, not onely that you
haue had this word of Wiſedome preached

amongſt you, but alſo ſoundly and ſincerely
by faithfull Paſtors and teachers: diuiding
the word of Truth aright. Others it
may be, haue had the Word preached: but
corruptly, and erroniouſly, mixing Chaffe
and Wheate together: and flattering the
people in their ſinnes. This is alſo a further
bleſſing, that you haue the Word preached,
not onely ſo long, and ſo ſincerely,
but alſo in ſuch variety of gifts &amp; teachers,
of ſtrangers, of yout owne Countrey-men:
of young and olde: variety of teachers amongſt
your ſelues, this is a ſpeciall bleſſing.
Thus you haue experience of the diuers
graces and gifts of God, in diuers men:
and heerein God is good vnto you, if one
can doe you no good, another may.
            A worthy Father holdeth it profitable,
that of the ſame queſtions, many Bookes
ſhould bee made by ſundry men, in a differing
ſtile, though not in a differing faith,
all ſtomaches (wee ſee) are not alike. One
kinde of dreſſing pleaſeth one, which hath
no reliſh with an other: and yet the ſame
meate, ordered after another faſhion, may
fitte his appetite. As differences of meates,
ſo of humors and diſpoſitions of men: the
ſame matter diuerſly handled, may find entertainment
with diuers men, which yet

diſgeſted after one only faſhion, would
haue acceptance with feare; All fiſhes are
not taken with the ſame baite, all birds are
not caught by the ſame kind of voyce and
ſinging: I ſpeake not this to pleaſe▪ vaine
and curious humors, who without iuſt
cauſe diſtaſte and diſlike their faithfull teachers;
Loue your Paſtors, reuerence the
gifts of God in any, be they more or leſſe:
yet know that it is a bleſſing which many
want, to be in ſuch ſort as you are partakers
of the labours of ſundrie teachers. And
herein alſo your bleſſing is the greater, becauſe
you haue ſuch preaching, ſo often
and ſo plentifully, both vpon the Saboth
day, and at other times: howſoeuer ſome
may thinke this too much, and ſome murmer
at it, and ſome loathe it, ſo that much
preaching is loathſome &amp; odious to ſome,
yet is this a rare bleſſing, which God hath
not imparted to many. In other things we
count plentie a bleſſing, and we neuer care
how much we haue, the more the better:
we neuer thinke we haue too much or enough:
God himſelfe doth promiſe it as a
bleſſing to his children,Deut 28. to haue ſtore and
abūdance of victualls, of Cattell, of Corne,
and the men of this world doe confeſſe it a
great bleſſing, to enioy theſe and ſuch like

things plentifully. Is it not a farre greater
bleſſing, to haue in ſuch abundance the
bleſſed foode of our ſoules? the want, penurie,
and ſcarcitie of this foode is a curſe
and iudgement:Amos 8. 18. therefore to haue it plentifully
is a ſpeciall and a rare bleſſing.Ier
                     •
                  . 3. 15. God
doth promiſe it as a rare mercy to his people,
and a ſpeciall token of his loue, to giue
them ſuch Paſtors as ſhall feede them with
knowledge and vnderſtanding. Againe
he ſayth,Eſa. 62. 6. I haue ſet watchmen vpon thy
walls, oh Ieruſalem, which all the day and
all the night continually ſhall not ceaſe;
you that are mindfull of the Lord, keepe
not ſilence, and giue him no reſt, till he repaire,
and vntill he ſet vp Ieruſalem the
praiſe of the world. The Miniſters muſt be
watchfull in praying continually for the
people, and they muſt be as carefull to
put the people in minde of their dutie, and
the people muſt take it as a bleſſing, to
haue ſuch remembrancers: wee are dull
&amp; ſlothfull in attention, in vnderſtanding,
in memorie, and practiſe, the beſt remedie
is often preaching, &amp; importunate calling
vpon.Eccl. 12. 11. The words of the wiſe, ſayth Salomon,
are like goades, &amp; like nayles faſtned
by the maſters of the aſſemblies, which are
giuen by one Paſtor. His meaning is, that

whereas we are dullards and ſlobacks in
all goodnes: by the goade of preaching we
are ſet on, prickt forward, and quickned in
all good wayes; and whereas we are wauering
and fickle, we are by the naile of preaching,
if it be wel and often driuen, we are
I ſay by this ſetled and ſtayed in the truth.
And though this goade and naile be commonly
vſed amongſt vs, yet in reſpect of
our weakenes we haue great neede of it,
neither are we to contemne it, becauſe it is
ſo common and plentifull. Good and neceſſary
things are not to be loathed, though
they be cōmon. The ſunne, moone, &amp; ſtars,
water &amp; fier, bread &amp; drinke, are common,
yet can we not liue without thē, neither do
we contemne them, and though the word
be compared to corporall foode, &amp; in many
things they agree together, as we haue
heard before: yet herein they differ, that of
the foode of the body, wee may haue too
much, &amp; ſurfet of it to our hurt; yet it is not
ſo in this ſpirituall foode, wee may be too
wiſe in the world, too wiſe in our owne
conceit, but we can neuer haue too much of
this ſpirituall wiſedome, ſo long as we liue
in this world; and he that is moſt wiſe or
holie, hath his wants, and doth dayly deſire
increaſe of grace. Corporall food ſaith one,

when wee haue it not,Greg. in H
                     •
                  m. doth breed in vs a
great deſire to haue it; when we haue it,
and eate it, and fill our ſelues with it, we oftentimes
loath it: but on the contrary, ſpirituall
dainties and foode, when wee haue
them not, we loath them; when we haue
them in truth, we the more deſire them. In
bodilie foode, appetite breedeth fulneſſe,
and fulneſſe breedeth loathing: in ſpirituall
foode, appetite breedeth fulneſſe, and
fulneſſe breedeth appetite and deſire: for,
ſpirituall daynties, when they feede and
fill, they doe increaſe in the minde an earneſt
and ardent deſire. Therefore oh worthie
Citizens, confeſſe and acknowledge
this great bleſſing of God vpon you, &amp; be
thankful to God for it: others confeſſe this
bleſſing vpon you, they are glad &amp; reioyce
for it, and would be more glad to haue the
like bleſſing in ſome ſort amongſt themſelues:
they take paines to come, to take
ſome part with you in this grace, and many
neighbours and ſtrangers haue receiued
much comfort and profit by theſe bleſſed
&amp; gracious meanes which you enioy in
ſuch abundance. It may be ſome amongſt
you do ſcarcely confeſſe this bleſſing, they
thinke it needleſſe, or that they may well
ſpare it: but moſt vnkind &amp; vnthankfull are

theſe, without grace or vnderſtanding. Others
ſay, happie are you, but they can neither
feele nor ſee any ſuch happines. It may
be ſome of Salomons Courtiers and ſeruants,
thought it no great happines to haue
ſuch a maiſter, ſuch a diuine teacher, to be
partakers of ſuch heauenly wiſedome: but
yet this woman, a ſtranger, a Gentill, pronounceth
them happie; and happie were
they indeed, if they knew their owne happineſſe.
And I doubt not, but many of you
doe acknowledge with ioy this to be the
chiefe happineſſe of your citie, to haue ſo
long time, ſo ſincerely, in ſuch varietie of
gifts, ſo plentifullie the true wiſedome of
Chriſt preached and publiſhed amongſt
you. Indeed the Lord hath not dealt ſo
with euery nation, with euery towne or
citie: Nay, the Lord hath ſtricken many
countreys and townes with palpable darknes,
but there is light, cleare light, the day
light, yea the cleare light of the ſunne, in
this worthie place where you dw
                  •
               ll. Many
places haue long endured, the moſt bitter
famine of the ſoule, they haue bin depriued
&amp; deſtitute, many yeres of the ſweet bread
of life: but here hath bin many yeares plentie:
and others come hither to get food and
ſuſtenance for their ſoules. We therefore

brethren, as helpers, exhort you, that you
receiue not this grace of God in vaine, but
receiue with meekenes the word that is
grafted in you, which is able to ſaue your

                  •
               oules. And here by your patiēce, let me ſtir
you vp to more care and diligence in reſorting
to Sermons on the weeke day. There
is great negligence and ſlacknes in ſome,
not onely of the common &amp; prophane ſort,
but alſo of ſome profeſſors of the Goſpel:
a fault I ſay, in neglecting ſo many Sermons
which they might heare, if ſlothfulneſſe,
worldlineſſe, or ſome idle conceit did not
hinder them. If wee did ſincerely loue this
wiſedome, and eſteeme it, as our chiefe
felicitie, wee would neglect no time nor
meanes, which is offered to vs: hee that
truely loueth the word, doth loue it at
all times. A Sermon in the weeke day
tryeth our true loue to the word. On the
Saboth day, men are compelled to come
by force of lawe: all ſorts of men come
then, Publicans and Phariſes, Atheiſts, and
time-ſeruers: but to come on the weekeday,
when law doth not bind vs, when we
haue other occaſions to hold vs back, it is a
more ſure ſigne of our ſincere loue &amp; zeale
to the word. And though the Saboth day
be chiefly ordeined for diuine ſeruice and

Sermons, &amp; that day we are wholie to giu
                  •
               
ourſelues to ſuch exerciſes without diſtraction:
and though the Lord giue vs liberty
to worke the ſixe daies, yet we owe him all
the dayes of our life: and euery day we are
to prefer heauenly things before earthly:
and the ſoule before the body, when occaſion
is offered, whenſoeuer the Lord calleth;
though it bee to the loſie of the beſt
things we haue: Euery one is to anſwere
with Abraham, Heere I am: and with Samuell,
(after hee knew it to be the Lordes
voyce) ſpeak Lord, for thy ſeruant heareth.
And with the Apoſties, to be ready to forſake
all, when CHRIST calleth.
            Euery day we are to preferre Heauen before
earth: things moſt neceſſarie, before
things leſſe neceſſary: things publike, before
things priuate. This care and pollicie
we haue in the matters of the world. Euery
day wee muſt remember and practiſe theſe
holy ſcriptures; Thou ſhalt loue the Lord
thy GOD, with all thy minde, with all thy
ſoule: That wiſedome is the beginning,
that wee muſt firſt ſeeke Gods kingdome,
and labour for the meate that neuer periſheth;
and that there is one thing needfull.
            Oh that wee would often thinke with

our ſelues, how much we are boūd to God,
how many duties he requireth of vs, how
many graces we want, how weake we are in
faith and knowledge; Oh that wee would
ſeriouſly remember the vanity of riches and
pleaſures, the ſhortnes of this life, the comforts
of the Worde, the great neceſſity and
vſe of it, in all the occaſions of our life: And
that we would conſider how dull and forgetful
we are, what meaſure of knowledge,
zeale, loue, and ſanctification is required of
vs: what account wee are to make, for not
hearing, for loſſe of many Sermons, which
we might haue heard, and what a bleſſing
the plentifull preaching of the word is, then
would wee thinke no time too much, nor
too long, that is ſpent about it: but would
ſay with this woman; Happy are they that
may alwayes heare ſuch wiſedome. And if
it be a happy thing to heare, then are they
vnhappy which heare not. Thoſe that keep
themſelues from hearing, they hinder their
owne happines.
            Some ſay, they goe to a Sermon, when
they haue nothing to doe: As who ſhould
ſay, they would not goe, if they had anie
thing to doe at all: but theſe doe not rightly
eſteeme of wiſdome, preferring it before
all things; Nay, as it ſeemeth, they preferre

all things before it. There is a promiſe of
bleſſednes made to ſuch as come, though
they be neuer ſo ſmall a number: But there
is no ſuch promiſe made to them, which
vppon light occaſions, abſent themſelues
from holy meetings. Nay, our Sauiour
Chriſt threatneth ſuch,Luk. 14. that they ſhall neuer
taſte of his heauenly Supper.
            There is nothing loſt, by ſeruing of God
at any time, to ſuch onely, he promiſeth all
bleſſings; godlines is great gaine, and hath
a promiſe of this life, and the life to come.
We muſt not leaue any dutie vndone which
God commands, for feare of loſſe.
            When the man of God, forbad Amaſiah
the king, to take the Armie of Iſraell with
him to battell,2. Chron. 25. 9. which he had hired, the king
ſaid; What ſhall wee doe then, for the hundreth
Tallents which I haue giuen to the
hoſtes of Iſraell? Then the man of God anſwered,
The Lord is able to giue thee more
then this. So that if we obey God, we need
not feare loſſes: the Lord will will giue vs
all things neceſſary, ſo that wee ſhall not
neede to feare want.
            It is the Lorde that doeth bleſſe our
Trades and calling
                  •
               : and hee will requite
any loſſe, that we endure for his ſake: And
indeed nothing is gotten by negl

               cting his

eies, and ſee neuer the worſe: the cauſe of

                  •
               oſſe, is the contempt and neglect of Gods

                  •
               eruice▪ Others deceiue you, becauſe you
deceiue God: your ſeruants are deceitfull,

                  •
               loathfull and vnfaithfull, becauſe you are
ſo to God. The Lord threatens to plague
his people with drought and ſcarcitie,Agg. 1. 6. becauſe
they preferred their owne worldly
pollicies before religion; they ſought not
him firſt of all: but built there owne houſes,
and let his lie waſte. Gaines that are gotten
beſides Gods will, they will not proſper:
but are like that Manna, which was
kept and reſerued till the morning, contrary
to Gods commandement, and it was full
of wormes and ſtancke.Num. 21. 5 Some like the vnthankefull
Iſraelites, which loath heauenly
Manna, and preferre garlicke and onions
before it.Mat. 8. 34. Some like Gergeſites, which
make more account of their hogges then of
Chriſt: they will rather intreat him to goe
out of the country, then endure any loſſe by
him. Some like Eſau, preferring a meſſe of
pottage before the bleſſing.Gen. 25. And with
Demas they forſake Chriſt, and embrace
this preſent world. What is an houre, or
two or three houres in the weeke, amongſt
ſuch a multitude of houres? the pooreſt

tradeſman early or late, may win &amp; recouer
ſo much time. One friend may entreat an
other a longer then that, though to his
paine, coſt or hinderance. Prince, maiſter,
father, may command many houres and
dayes from our owne buſines, and may not
God command a fewe houres for our
good; How many houres doe we ſpend in
the weeke idlely and vainely, we are content
to eate and drinke, ſome twice, ſome
thriſe in the day, it may be oftner, and we
thinke much to receiue the foode of our
ſoules, ſome fewe houres in the weeke.
Some are content to worke, ſome to play
from morning till night, and it may be
from night till morning: but they are ſoone
wearie, in hearing the word, they thinke all
that time long and loſt, they would haue
long health, long leaſes, long liues, long
dinners, and ſuppers, long feaſts, &amp; ſleepes
but ſhort prayers, ſhort Sermons, and a
ſeldom as may be, ſome to their ſhame, ar

houſe: ſome are glad of the company o
                  •
               
vaine companions, they care not how long
nor how often they be with them: but the
make ſmall account of the fellowſhip 
                  〈◊〉
               
the Saints, in the great congregation. Chapmen,
goe to markets, to faires, many amile

for the bellie and for gaine, they will hardly
loſe any that is commodious for them:
but many will ſcearce come out of their
doores to heare a ſermon; we are to labour
for the word if we want it, though it be
to our coſt and paines; and will we not receiue
it, when it is offered, to vs ſo neare at
hand? they that will not heare it when they
may haue it ſo eaſily, would hardly take
any great iourney for it: we ſee by experience,
that all goe of neceſſitie to common
duties, and to common workes, in towne
or Citie, and is not this a common dutie to
all Chriſtians, to heare and receiue the
word of life, when they may haue it? The
miniſter is to preach in ſeaſon and out of
ſeaſon; and as he is bound to preach, ſo
you are bound to heare. Woe be to him,
if he preach not the Goſpell: and woe be
to you, if you heare not the Goſpell; by
the preaching of the Goſpell, the miniſter
doth performe a ſpeciall ſeruice to
God.
            And it is a ſpeciall part of Gods diuine
ſeruice, required of all true Chriſtians, diligently,
and carefully to heare his word
preached; Finally, remember, that the
ſlacknes and the negligence of the people
in hearing, is a wound and Coroſiue to

the heart of the miniſter, their forwardnes,
their zeale &amp; diligence, is no ſmall i
                  •
               oy and
comfort to him: but when he ſeeth them
negligent, ſlacke and vntoward, it doth
diſcourage and diſcomfort him, it troubleth
his ſtudie, it diſquieteth his heart,
and maketh him thinke, that ſuch people
haue ſmall loue, to him or his miniſtrie;
ſeeing they will not vouchſafe to heare
and reuerence, thoſe fruitfull doctrines
and exhortations, which he hath gathered
from the holy ſcriptures; and that with
great paines, care and labour.
            Therefore obey them that haue the ouer
               
                  •
               ight
of you, and ſubmit your ſelues, for
they watch for your ſoules, as they that
muſt giue accounts;Heb. 13. 17. that they may doe it
with ioy and not with griefe; for that it is
vnprofitable for you; and neuer ceaſe to
deſire the ſincere milke of your ſoule, that
you may growe thereby. But yet further,
to rouſe vs all, and to waken careleſſe and
vnthankfull hearers, let vs ſee how our Sauior
alledgeth and applyeth the example
of this woman, and likewiſe the example
of the Niniuites, againſt the vnthankfull,
rebell
                  •
               ous; and vnbeleeuing Iewes. The
Queene of the South ſaith he, ſhall riſe in
iudgement with the men of this generation,

and ſhall condemne them,Luk: 11. 31. 32. for ſhe came
from the vtmoſt parts of the earth, to heare
the wiſedome of Salomon, and behold a
greater then Salomon is here. The men of
Niniuie ſhall riſe in iudgement with this
generation, and ſhall condemne it, for they
repented at the preaching of Ionas, and
behold a greater then Ionas is here. Both
theſe examples are fitly applied, by our Sauiour
againſt the Iewes, and ſo againſt vs,
they contemned his holy doctrine and miracles,
and therefore he chargeth them
with great vnkindnes, threatning them
with moſt ſeuere and iuſt puniſhment: and
to amplifie their ſinne, he compareth this
Queene and them together, ſhe a woman,
the weaker ſexs, vnfit to take vpon her
great Iournies; they, many of them, were
men more able &amp; ſtronger, and yet would
take no paines to come to him: ſhe a
Queene, brought vp tenderly and daintily,
and therefore more vnfit to endure trauell:
they, moſt of them priuate perſons,
acquainted with labour, and yet they will
not labour, for that heauenly Manna, and
bread of life: She a gentile, a heathen, vncircumciſed:
they, Gods people, Abrahams
ſeede, and yet they will not accept of the
true Meſſiah, being the bleſſed and promiſed

ſeed: She vndertooke a great 
                  •
               ourney,
dangerous in reſpect of wilde beaſtes,
theeues, enemies: Chriſt was borne amōgſt
them, he was brought vp, and dwelt with
them, he came to them, preaching in euery
Citie, Towne &amp; Synagogues, his wiſedom
cryed in their ſtreetes, and at their doores.
This gracious woman, ſpent much, &amp; was
at great charges, in comming and returning,
and giuing coſtly preſents to Salomon.
Chriſt freely offreth to them temporall
and ſpiritual graces, foode to ſoule and
body, and yet they regard him not. She
was moued with fame and report, which
is often fal
                  •
               e and vntrue: they ſaw before
their eyes his wonders &amp; wiſedome. There
came to Salomon a man, being onely a tipe
of Chriſt: but the Sonne of God, the true
Meſſias, the wiſedome of the father, came
of his owne accord to them; yea, he came
amongſt his owne, but his owne receiued
him not. She came to learne, to be reſolued
and ſatisfied of her doubts: Chriſt offreth
them diuine wiſedome, ſuch as is able to
ſatisfie and reſolue any that are willing to
learne, in all the matters of their ſaluation;
but they being carried away, by a conceit
of their owne wiſedome and righteouſnes,
thinke ſcorn
                  •
                to be reſolued by him:

this Queen, aboue all things preferreth this
heauenly wiſedome, as the chiefe treaſure
&amp; felicitie: but they make the commandements
of God to be of no force by their
owne traditions. She moueth many doubts
to Salomon, with a good minde to be reſolued:
they indeed aske many queſtions,
&amp; propound many doubts to our Sauiour,
but with moſt wicked malicious mindes,
to catch, entangle, and intrappe him in his
ſpeech. This Queene, commendeth, magnifieth
&amp; reuerenceth Salomō her teacher,
but they r
                  •
               uile and blaſpheme our Sauiour
Chriſt. She ſtirreth vp others to loue and
honour Salomon: they withdrawe others,
ſo many as they can from honouring of
Chriſt. She accounteth it true happines to
heare Salomons wiſedome: they feele and
finde no ſuch thing, though they heare the
wiſedome of Chriſt. She a ſtranger admireth
Salomon: they of the ſame countrey,
ſtocke and kindred with Chriſt Ieſus, and
yet reiect and deſpiſe him. She moſt thankfull
to God and to Salomon, for the comfort
&amp; good which ſhe had receiued: but
they moſt creul, &amp; vnthankfull, againſt Ieſus
Chriſt; thogh he beſtowed many great
bleſſings &amp; benefits vpon them: they were
thoſe bad husbandmen to whō the Lord

ſet his vineyard, and ſending his ſeruants
to receiue fruit, ſome of them they beate,
and ſome of them they killed: and at laſt
ſending his ſonne, they ſaid among themſelues,
This is the heire, come let vs kill
him,Mat. 21. 33. 44. &amp;c. and let vs take his inheritance. Therefore
ſaith our Sauiour to theſe, That the
kingdome of God ſhould be taken from
them, and ſhall be giuen to a nation which
ſhall bring forth the fruits thereof. Finally,
this woman obſerued all things that Salomon
ſpake, or did, and wondreth: but they
are ſo blinde, that neither the power of his
doctrine, nor the greatnes of his miracles,
could moue them to admiration. She was
not brought vp in the ſchoole of God, and
yet ſeeketh for inſtruction: they were learned
in the lawe and the Prophets, and yet
deſpiſe the true teacher and Prince of Prophets.
Therefore ſhall this Queene riſe it
iudgement againſt theſe blind and obſtinate
Iewes, which is not ſo to be taken
a
                  •
                if ſhe had any power of iudging or condemning,
for that properly belongeth to
Chriſt: but that by this example, and fact o
                  •
               
               hers,
they ſhall be conuicted, and left without
excuſe. It ſhall clearely teſtifie to all
the world, that their damnation is moſt
iuſt.
         
         
            
            THE FOVRTH
SERMON.
            MAny worthy and excellent things
we haue heard alreadie, of this gracious
woman, her great care, deſire,
and loue, to knowe the truth, in comming
ſo great a iourney to her great paines and
charge, her reuerencing and magnifying of
Salomon, and accounting, the hearing and
obeying true wiſedome, as the greateſt felicitie
in this life. We haue heard her example
commended by our Sauiour Chriſt,
and alledged by him, to the ſhame and
condemnation of the Scribes and Phariſes,
and all the obſtinate and vnbeleeuing
Iewes, who did not receiue, but reiect
him, that was far greater then Salomon.
Now let vs adde the other example of the
Niniuites, applied alſo by our Sauiour to
the ſame purpoſe, againſt the Iewes, and ſo
let vs make ſome vſe of them both to our
ſelues. The men of Niniuie ſaith Chriſt,
ſhall riſe in iudgement with this generation,

and ſhall conemne it, for they repented
at the preaching of Ionas,Luk. 11. 32. and behold,
a greater then Ionas is here.
            Heere is a like compariſon as before,
to the ſame vſe and ende; the Niniuites
being Gentiles, ſtrangers from the cōmon-wealth
of Iſrael: yet at the preaching of Ionas,
ſuffer themſelues to be reproued &amp; reformed:
theſe were Iſraelites, the ſeede of
Abrahā, to whom pertained the Adoption,
the couenant, the promiſes, the law, the oracles
of God, &amp; yet they wil not harkē to the
voyce of the ſōne of God, the ſauiour of the
world. They had but one Preacher of the
word, the prophet Ionas: theſe had manie
prophets, yea Iohn the Baptiſt, &amp; Chriſt him
ſelfe, &amp; yet they did not belieue them. The
Niniuites in one day, at one Sermon, were
touched &amp; conuerted; To them the word
had bin preached a lōg time, many yeres, &amp;
yet they were not the better. They repēted
at the preaching of Ionas, being confirmed
by no ſigne nor miracle: they ſaw daily new
ſignes and wonders wrought among them,
ſuch as neuer any did before, &amp; yet they cō
               temned
both his Doctrine and miracles.
Theywere moued at the preaching of Ionas
a ſtranger, being a Iewe, cōming frō the
Iewes, a nation odious to thē: but theſe loathed

CHRIST, being their owne Countryman,
borne among them. The Niniuites
endured Ionas his ſermon, threatning moſt
fearfull and general deſtruction vpon them;
but they hated Chriſt, and could not abide
him, but thought him worthie of death,
though he preached, &amp; offered to them, the
treaſures &amp; grace of mercie. Finally, they
belieued Ionas, a mortall and ſinfull man:
theſe would not belieue Chriſt, being not
onely man, but God, whom they could not
reproue of any ſinne, hauing ſo many witneſſes
from the Law, frō the prophets, from
God the Father, from Iohn the Baptiſt, and
from his owne glorious works.
            And very notably doth one knit vp this
compariſon together in theſe words. The
Niniuites ſaith he, a nation ſtrange frō God,
Ionas, a wan vnknowne, &amp; of a baſe condition,
came to them: No man commended
him vnto them before hee came, none foretold
his comming, he wrought no miracles
at all, hee got no mans fauour by any benefites,
hee promiſed no great matter, he onely
threatneth deſtruction, and he preached
no longer then three dayes: but CHRIST
was promiſed long before, by the Oracles
of the Prophets, often commended
by the teſtimonie of Iohn, and his Father,

proceeding from the ſame progenitors, of
whom they gloried: he had taught them a
good while, and wrought many miracles
among them, he beſtowed many benefites
vpon many, both vpon their ſoules and
bodies, he did not thunder or threaten
h
                  •
               a
                  •
               ie iudgements, but freely promiſe remiſſion
of ſinnes, and freely offereth the
inheritance of eternall life: and yet they
ſay, he hath a diuell, and they purſue and
hate him to death: ſo farre are they from
being drawne to repentance by his heauenly
doctrine. Therefore moſt iuſtly doth
our Sauiour, both alledge the example of
this woman, and the example of the Niniuites,
to their ſhame and condemnation.
This may ſeeme very hard and heauie to
ſome, but it is moſt true, and confirmed by
common ſenſe and reaſon, that thoſe ſhall
be moſt ſeuerely puniſhed, which are not
moued, by ſuch meanes, as haue moued
many other; thoſe I ſay are in moſt heauie
caſe, which haue moe and greater meanes
of repentance, and yet haue not repented;
this will lye heauie vpon all contemners of
the word, vpon all falſe Chriſtians, vpon all
vnprofitable and vnthankefull hearers,
though they come of Chriſtian parents,
though they profeſſe, heare, and be partakers

of the Sacraments: yet this will not
ſerue the turne, if they be inferiour to them
in grace and goodnes, and ſo condemned
by their example, that had either no knowledge
of religion, or leſſe meanes then
they: ſuch men ſometimes, to their ſhame,
the Lord ſendeth them, not onely to the
heathen, but alſo to the very bruite beaſts,
to learne of them;Eſa. 1. 3. 2. Heare ô heauens, and
hearken ô earth, for the Lord hath ſayd;
I haue nouriſhed and brought vp children,
but they haue rebelled againſt me.
The Oxe knoweth his owner, and the Aſſe
his maſters cribbe: but Iſrael hath not
knowne my people, hath not vnderſtood.
His meaning is, that the very bruite and
and dull beaſts, are more kind, and more
dutifull, to their Maiſters and feeders, then
many people are, to God their Creator,
preſeruer, and redeemer. And in an other
place,Ier. 8. 7. 6. he complaineth, ſaying; I hearkned
&amp; heard, but none ſpake right, no man repented
him of his wickednes, ſaying; What
haue I done? euery one turneth to the raſe,
as the horſe ruſheth into the battel: euen
the ſtorke in the aire knoweth her appointed
times, and the Crane, the Turtle, and
the Swallow, obſerue the time of the comming:
but my people knoweth not the

iudgement of the Lord. The meaning is,
that theſe birds doe better knowe and obſerue,
the ſeaſons of Summer, Winter, cold,
and heate, then his people did the times of
mercy and iudgements. The greater means,
the longer time, and the more plentifull
we haue it; the heauier ſhalbe our iudgement
if we profit not by it. And therefore
our Sauiour Chriſt, did moſt of all vpbraide
and threaten thoſe cities where he preached
moſt, and wrought moſt miracles, becauſe
they repented not. Woe be to thee Chorazin,
ſayth he, woe be to thee Bethſaida,
for if the great workes which were done in
you, had beene done in Tyrus and Sydon,
they had repented long agoe in ſack cloth
and aſhes: but I ſay to you, it ſhall be eaſier,
for Tyrus and Sydon at the day of iudgment
then for you. And thou Capernaum,
which art lifted vp to heauen, ſhalt be
brought downe to hell; for if the great
workes which haue beene done in thee,
had beene done among them of Sodom,
they had remained to this day: but I ſay to
you, It ſhall be eaſier for them of the land
of Sodom in the day of iudgement then for
thee. In theſe places he did many of his
greateſt workes, and that a long time, yea
ſo many &amp; ſo great workes, as might haue

moued the very Infidels to repentance, his
works doe comprehend his doctrine: for
the more confirmation of his doctrine,
theſe people they heard Chriſt teaching,
they receiued and entertained him, they
ſaw his miracles, they accepted his benefits,
both corporall and ſpirituall, the benefits
and priuiledges were very great, which
he vouchſafed them, he did not deale ſo
with euery Nation, Citie, or Towne. It is
a great mercie to haue a Prophet, though
it be to our coſt &amp; paines, but Chriſt came
to them freely, vndeſired, vnſought for. It
is a mercie to haue the word without miracles,
but they had both his word and miracles.
It is a fauour to ſee Chriſt, and to
heare him, though it were but once, but
they heard and ſaw him many times, and
yet they are vnthankefull and diſobedient.
But let vs more neerely conſider, what
Chriſt ſpeaketh of the citie of Capernaum,
it was a famous citie of Galilie, and had
ſome ſpeciall prerogatiue aboue the reſt:
for the Sonne of God, beginning his kingdome
and prieſthood, he did chooſe that
citie as his Pallace and Sanctuarie; there
he liued and dwelt amongſt them. This is
the chiefe glorie of Cities, to entertaine
Chriſt and his Goſpel. This doth as it were

lift them vp to heauen, but if they repent
not, but ſtill continue their ſinnes, and abuſe
the mercies of God, their iudgement
ſhall be the heauier. The grace of God is
tyed to no place nor perſon, he will ſpare
none if they abuſe his mercies: and this
maketh much to the ſhame and condemnation
of the Pope of Rome, who glorieth
that he is Chriſts Vicar, Peters ſucceſſor,
and that Rome is the Metropolitane and
Mother-Church of all the world. Though
this be moſt falſe, yet if it were true, he
muſt know, that the more promiſes and
priuiledges they haue, they muſt looke for
the greater iudgements. Idolatrie, pride,
vncleaneſſe, vnthankfulneſſe, incredulitie,
and other like ſinnes, haue bin the ruine
and deſtruction of many famous Cities,
which haue had greater promiſes, &amp; greater
priuiledges then euer Rome had. Memorable
and fearefull is the example of Ieruſalem,
which was called the citie of God,
the holie citie, a figure of the ſpirituall and
heauenly Church, of the which the Pſalmiſt
ſpeaketh excellent things. God is knowne
in Iuda, his name is great in Iſrael, that
there are thrones for iudgement, euen the
thrones of the houſe of Dauid: Pray for
peace of Ieruſalem; let them proſper that

loue thee.Eſa: 2. 3. The Prophet Eſai ſaith; The law
ſhall goe forth of Syon: the word of the
Lord from Ieruſalem. What Citie had euer
greater priuiledges? and yet according to
Chriſt prophecying, it is long ſince come
to miſerable ruine and deſolation: the
Iewes that were once the people of God,
haue beene long ſince reiected: the naturall
branches are caſt off, and they are become
a lamentable ſpectacle to all the
world; for the contempt of Gods word,
and abuſing of his mercies. The like fearefull
examples we haue, in the ſeuen Churches
of Aſia, of the which S. Iohn ſpeaketh
in his Reuelation, they were planted by
the Apoſtles themſelues, they profeſſed the
Goſpell of Chriſt, they had the word and
Sacraments, they had all the prerogatiues,
priuiledges, and markes of true Churches,
yet are they long ſince quite ouerthrowne,
for their vnthankfulnes and diſobedience
to the Goſpell. What then ſhall become
of Papiſts, Athiſts, Recuſants, deſpi
                  •
               ers,
mockers, Pagannes and Infidells, when as
ſuch as haue receiued the Goſpell, and entertained
it, ſhall be in harder and heauier
eſtate, in the day of iudgement, then Sodom
and Gomorah? whoſe ſtate no doubt
is moſt grieuous and miſerable, as their

               
                  •
               innes was moſt hainous, and abominable.
S. Peeter ſaith, that they are alreadie condemned,
and therefore neuer likely to be
ſaued. What then ſhall be the fearefull
ſtate of thoſe, which ſhall be ſubiect to
greater deſtruction &amp; damnation? &amp; ſuch
are all careleſſe and vnprofitable hearers,
which profit not, nor yet are brought to
repentance, by the preaching of the Goſpell:
theſe are in harder caſe, then the
Iewes, thē the Infidells, or the Sodomities,
becauſe they haue greater meanes,Mat. 12. 4. and a
more cleare light, then euer they had: he
that knoweth his maiſters will and doth it
not, ſhalbe beaten with many ſtripes. If I
had not come and ſpoken to them ſaith
Chriſt, they ſhould not haue had ſinne, but
now haue they no cloake for their ſin. His
meaning is, that their ſinne had beene the
leſſe, if he had not come; ſo that the comming
of Chriſt, his death and paſſion, his
glorious Goſpell, offering grace and ſaluation
to all, doth not eaſe, leſſen, or excuſe
the ſinne of any, but doth rather aggrauate
their ſin, &amp; ſo maketh their puniſhmēt the
ſorer: which expreſſe not the vertue of his
death, &amp; the power of the Goſpel, in their
liues &amp; conuerſation. And therfore the Apoſtle
doth terrifie the Corinthians, with

the examples of the Iewes,1. Co
                     •
                  : 10. 1. 2. 3. &amp;c. who had great
graces &amp; priuiledges, who were vnder the
Cloud, &amp; al paſſed through the ſea, &amp; were
al baptiſed vnto Moſes in the Cloud &amp; the
ſea, &amp; did all eate the ſame ſpiritual meate,
&amp; did all drinke the ſame ſpirituall drinke,
for they drāke of the ſpiritual rocke which
followed them, and the rocke was Chriſt.
The meaning is, they had ſpeciall ſignes of
Gods protection &amp; fauour, many rare deliuerances,
they had Moſes, they had the law
&amp; the couenant, they had ſacraments &amp; ſacrafices,
&amp; yet with many of thē God was
not pleaſed: for they were ouerthrowne
in the wildernes. And the Apoſtle ſetting
downe diuers iudgements which fell vpon
them for their ſins, in the end he ſaith, All
theſe things came vnto thē for enſamples,
&amp; are written, to admoniſh vs vpon whom
the ends of the world is come. Wherefore
let him that ſtādeth, take heed leaſt he fall.
Let vs therefore applie all the former examples
to our ſelues, &amp; make goog vſe of
them: we haue had the Goſpel of Chriſt a
long time preached amongſt vs, and that
ſoūdly &amp; plētifully, as you haue heard. And
yet many are in darkenes vnder the light,
being very ignorant, not knowing the
principles of holy religion, not being able
to giue a reaſon of the true faith. Others,

though they haue knowledge, yet they
haue not truly repented, but liue ſtill in
their old ſinnes: other, and moſt of all,
though they profeſſe repentance, and that
they haue forſaken their old courſe of life,
yet they bring not forth fruites of amendment;
they ſeeme to hate euill, and yet
doe no good: at leaſt they leaue many
good things vndone, they faile much, to
the diſcredit of the Goſpell, in practiſe and
obedience; they make ſmall conſcience
of many duties of pietie, equitie, and charitie,
they make a ſhew of godlines, but denie
the power thereof. So that we may
complaine, as the heathen man complained
of the careleſnes of many hearers in the
Philoſophers ſchooles,Senec. Some ſaith hee,
come to heare, but not to learne, as to a
ſtage play, for recreation ſake, to delight
their eares, they are carried away with the
ſpeech, with voyce, with fables: a great
part of ſuch hearers thou ſhalt ſee in the
Philoſophers ſchoole, they goe thither,
when they are Idle and haue nothing to
doe, they goe not to this purpoſe, to receiue
any law or rule of life, that ſo they
might amend their manners: with the ſame
mindes, and with the ſame purpoſes, many
reſort to heare ſermons. The Prophet

complaines of ſuch hearers,Ezeck. 33. 30. 31. 32. &amp;c. or rather the
Lord by the Prophet, ſaying, Thou ſonne
of man, the children of thy people, that
talke of thee by the walles, and in the
doores of the houſes, and ſpeake one to
an other, euery one to his brother, ſaying,
Come I pray you, and heare what is the
word that commeth from the Lord, for
they come vnto thee, as the people vſe to
come, and my people ſit before thee, and
heare thy words, but they will not doe
them; for with their mouthes they make
ieſtes, and their heart goeth after couetouſnes;
and loe thou art vnto them as a
Ieſting ſong▪ of one that hath a pleaſant
voyce, and can ſing well, for they heare
thy words, but they doe them not. And
when this commeth to paſſe, for loe, it will
come, then ſhall they know, that a Prophet
hath beene among them. We haue had
(bleſſed be God) a flouriſhing Church a
long time, the Goſpell ſoundly preached,
in many places of our land: many men in
the Church of great learning and gifts,
many zealous and forward profeſſors of
the truth, the fame of theſe things hath
comforted other Churches, hath cauſed
many ſtrangers to come amongſt vs, and
to liue with vs: Oh that I might truly ſay,

as this woman ſayd to king Salomon in
the two former verſes before this text: It
was a true word ſayth ſhee that I heard in
my owne land, of thy ſayings, and of thy
wiſedome, howbeit, I beleeued not this
report, til I came and had ſeene it with my
eyes: but loe, the one halfe was not told
mee, for thou haſt more wiſedome and
proſperitie, then I hane heard by report;
oh that the ſtrangers that are or haue bene
amongſt vs, might truely ſay, wee ſee and
perceiue by experience, more zeale, more
religion, more ſinceritie, more pietie and
goodnes, thē we heard of before we came.
But may they not to our great ſhame, may
they not ſee much defection and declining
from the zeale of former times, much Atheiſme,
Poperie, and prophaneneſſe, much
hypocriſie, and diſſimulation, great contempt
of the word and miniſters, much curſing
and blaſphemie, much oppreſſion in
Church and Common-wealth; and finally,
may they not ſee moſt places full of idleneſſe,
full of wantonneſſe, and moſt filthie
vncleaneneſſe; and therefore we may iuſtly
complaine, as other haue done long ſince,
in their times, and cuntries, let vs heare the
complaints,Bulling. in Mat. 12. &amp; lay them to our own hearts,
the Goſpell is preached amongſt vs, and a

bleſſed life is offred to vs by Chriſt, &amp; nothing
is required of vs, but obedience, puritie,
and honeſtie of life: but we doe obſtinately
contemne this diuine and holie requeſt;
therfore the Niniuites and this woman
ſhal condemne vs. I ſpeake nothing of
perſecutors and oppreſſors of diuine wiſedome,
but I ſpeake of ſuch as profeſſe the
Goſpell amongſt vs: the common ſort doe
very badly ſpend the Saboth day, which
ſhould be conſecrated to diuine wiſedome:
others had rather giue themſelues
to drinking, and playing, then to praying
or hearing; many Citizens &amp; Towneſmen,
looke to their Shops and Trades,
or elſe they take iourneyes, or if they
bee at home, they are prophanely occupied,
or if they come to the Sermon,
their mindes are at home; they are like
Idols, that haue eares and heare not,
eyes and ſee not; they doe not conſider
and marke, nor beleeue thoſe things
which are ſpoken of the contempt of this
world: againſt couetouſneſſe, oppreſſion,
and deceit; If they be ſomewhat neerely
touched, they gruntle like Swine, they
barke like Dogges; ſuch as are learned,
and haue knowledge, beeing delicate
and dainetie, they thinke the plaine

and ſimple ſtile of preaching agreeing to
the Scripture, to haue ſmall ſweetneſſe or
delight in it, they ſtand vpon eloquence
and mans wiſedome; it is grieuous to
them to heare a plaine ſimple Preacher,
though he ſpeake with power of the ſpirit.
Great perſons, men of ſtate and countenance,
which are ſcarcely accounted men,
but halfe Gods, they thinke it a diſcredit
to heare many ſermons.Ieron. I am afraid (ſaith
a Father) that the Queene of the South,
comming frō the fartheſt part of the world
to heare the wiſedome of Salomon, that
ſhe ſhall iudge men of this age: and the
men of Niniuie repenting at the preaching
of Ionas, ſhall condemne thoſe which deſpiſe
a greater then Ionas: ſo many among
the people, ſhall condemne many Miniſters
in the Church, withdrawing themſelues
from their Eccleſiaſticall dutie, and
doing thoſe things which doe not beſeeme
                  •
               
a Miniſter:Chriſoſt. in op
                     •
                  . im per. yea, they doe not beſeeme a
ſimple Chriſtian. An other complaineth
both of Miniſters and people, ſaying, Wo
                  •
               
be vnto you Scribes, and Phariſes, hypocrites;
which ſhut the kingdome of heauen
before men. By theſe words the Lord
will ſhew, that the Prieſts of the Iewes did
all things for couetouſnes, and who knew

by the ſcriptures that Chriſt was come,
and they conſidered, becauſe Chriſt was
beleeued and receiued, that the cuſtome
of ſacraficing and offering would ceaſe,
and that the ſacrifice of righteouſnes
would preuaile: but they did ſhut the
doore of truth, when they decreed, that if
any ſhould ſay he was the ſonne of God, he
ſhould be ſhut out of the Synagogue: ſo
now hereticall miniſters, they doe ſhut the
doore of truth; for they know, if the truth
be made manifeſt, the Church would leaue
them, and they ſhould be caſt downe from
their places. What then is the ignorant
people to be excuſed? No, for if thou
wouldſt buy thee garments, thou ſeekeſt
to ſundry Chapmen, and where thou maiſt
haue the beſt garments, and the eaſieſt
price, thoſe thou takeſt: and therefore thou
muſt ſeeke and ſearch for teachers, and enquire
where truth is, and where is error:
It is not forbidden to know the confeſſions
of all men, and to chooſe that which is
beſt, according to the ſaying of the Apoſtle;
Proue all things, and hold that which
is good. If for worldly buſines thou wouldeſt
goe to a place thou knoweſt not, thou
doſt not ceaſe from thy purpoſe, becauſe
thou knoweſt not the way, but thou doeſt

trie this, and that way, thou doſt aske, ſeek,
and enquire, and ſo findeſt the right way:
If thou wilt enter into the truth of the
ſcriptures, ſometimes pray, ſometimes
ſearch the ſcriptures, ſometimes ſeeke by
good workes, ſometimes enquire of this
miniſter, ſometimes of that: that ſo thou
maiſt ſee, who they be that haue the keyes
of knowledge. If theſe things be not done,
it is becauſe the word of God is not beleeued,
nor the promiſe of bleſſednes deſired,
nor the laſt iudgement feared. Where
is this care of ſearching, and the truth to be
found? where is that diligence of inquiring?
Men are readie to heare, receiue,
and beleeue any thing, like children,
they are carried away with any kinde of
doctrine, they are ſtill ignorant, and fall
into many errors, becauſe with this woman,
they will not diligently and carefully
ſeeke for the truth where it may be
found. All others are carefull and painefull
to learne, and ſeeke the true knowledge
and skill (as much as they can) of
their trades and ſciences, onely Chriſtians
are idle, careles, and ignorant in their profeſſion.
Harken I pray you (ſaith the ſame
father) is it not an abſurd thing, that the

Phyſition, the Shoomaker, and Weauer,
and generally all workemen, ſtriue for the
profeſſion of their Arts: but a Chriſtian
cannot bring a reaſon of his religion:
thoſe Artes being neglected, are but the
loſſe of money, the contempt of religion
is the loſſe of the ſoule: and yet we are
ſo madde, that we imploy all our care and
thoughts that way, and we make no account,
of the neceſſarie defence of our
ſoule; for this cauſe, the heathen knowe
not their error, but take offence, and
mocke vs; for they being in error, doe
all things for the defence of their errors:
We (being profeſſors of the truth) can
ſay nothing for defence of it; and for this
cauſe, the very heathen doe condemne
our doctrine of weakenes, they ſuſpect
in vs ſome fraude, and fooliſhnes, and
ſo they ſpeake euill of Chriſt, as of a liar:
we are the cauſe of this blaſphemie. Saint
Peeter commandeth vs, to be readie to
giue a reaſon of the faith, that is in vs, to euery
man that asketh.1. Pet. 3 15. And S. Paul doth exh
                  •
               rt
vs:Coll. 3. That the word of God may dwell
plentifully in vs. But what ſay the fooliſh
people to this? they ſay bleſſed is the ſimple
ſoule, and he that walketh ſimplie, walketh

boldly; this is the cauſe of all euill, that
many cannot rightly and truly applie the
ſcriptures:Pro: 109. for by the ſimple, is not meant
the foole, but he that is honeſtly and vprightly
minded: for if it were ſo vnderſtood,
in vaine were the ſaying of Chriſt,
Be wiſe as ſerpents,Chri: in Iohn. and innocent as doues:
Let vs bluſh, and be aſhamed, that the Samaritan
woman,Hom. 3. was ſo carefull in learning,
that her worldly buſines could not
hinder her from the doctrine of Chriſt:Chap. 4.
We enquire nothing in the knowledge of
heauenly things, but are careleſſe and neglect
all things. Which of vs (I pray you)
when we come home, doth any thing worthy
of a Chriſtian? who doth ſearch? repeate?
or remember the ſcriptures? The
ſcriptures are giuen, not onely that you
ſhould haue them in your bookes, but alſo
in your hearts: I doe not forbid to get you
bookes: nay I doe admoniſh you, and entreate
you, that you get them; yet ſo, that
you doe oftentimes repeat, both the letters
and the ſenſe, in your minde: that by
it, that may be made pure. For if in whatſoeuer
houſe the Goſpell of Chriſt is, the
diuell dare not enter; how much leſſe, ſhall
the diuel ore ſinne, touch that ſoule, which
is familiar with the diligent reading of it:

therefore ſanctifie thy ſoule, and ſanctifie
thy body, this ſhall come to paſſe, if thou
haue alwaies in thy minde, and tongue, the
Goſpell of Chriſt. Seeing therefore, there
is ſuch ignorance, impenitencie, prophanenes,
diſobedience and vnthankfulnes amongſt
vs, not onely the former examples,
but many others ſhall riſe vp in iudgement
againſt vs in the laſt day. The G
                  •
               ecians
ſhall condemne vs in that day, for they
reuerently eſteemed, and heard their Philoſophers
diſputing doubtfully of vice and
vertue: but wee contemne the faithfull
preachers, deliuering vnto vs the certaine
and ſure word of God. The Romanes ſhall
condemne vs, who gaue ſuch honour to
the obſcure writings of Sybilla, that in all
doubts they reſted vpon them: we neglect
the ſcriptures, which are able to reſolue vs
in all doubts, and to comfort vs in the
greateſt extremities. The Papiſts ſhall condemne
vs, who make more account of
their own traditions, then we do of Chriſts
Goſpell. They are more conſtant in errors,
then we in the truth: they goe further to a
maſſe, then we to a ſermon: they are more
liberall in mainetaining of Idolatrous
Prieſtes, then we aree to maintaine the
Lords faithfull miniſters. They take more

care and paines, in drawing as many as
they can, to their idolatrous ſuperſtition:
then we are to drawe men to true religion:
They liberally maintaine their followers
and fauourers; we ſuffer many true
profeſſors and Chriſtians to want.
            Our forefathers, who liued in blindnes,
ſhall condemne vs: who were full of good
deeds, abounding in hoſpitalitie, liberalitie
and almes deeds, dealing iuſtly, honeſtly,
and vprightly in their contractes,
and bargaines.
            Many amongſt vs vnder the Goſpell,
are couetous, miſerable, and vnmercifull,
full of deceit, and crueltie.
            Theſe miſerable worldlings ſhall condeme
vs: who doe ſo much followe the
world, and beſtowe ſo much care and
paines vpon it, neglecting no time, or occaſion
of gaine: whereas we are ſloathfull,
careleſſe, and negligent in heauenly
things. Theſe two examples of the Niniuites,
and this woman alledged by our
Sauiour Chriſt in the Goſpell, againſt the
vnthankefull and diſobedient Iewes, may
as truly and as iuſtly be applied againſt vs.
The Niniuites ſhall riſe in iudgement and
condemne this generation; They hearing
but one Ionas▪ and one ſermon, threatning

deſtruction, beleeued God, repented of
their ſinnes, and ſhewed the fruites of
their faith and repentance: but how many
ſermons haue we heard, and that by
ſundrie men, and a long time? ſermons
of mercy, alluring vs by the ſweet promiſes
of God; and ſermons of iudgements,
threatning &amp; thundring euerlaſting damnation:
and yet where is our repentance?
where are the fruites of our faith and obedience?
A fewe ſermons, or one ſermon,
was ſufficient to witnes againſt vs; how
much more ſuch a multitude of ſermons,
ſo long continued? By the mouth of two
or three witneſſes euery thing ſhall be
eſtabliſhed: And the Apoſtle accounteth
his ſermons and Epiſtles, as witneſſes againſt
the Corinthians: And if the very
ſhaking off the duſt of the feete of Gods
ſeruants, be a ſufficient witnes againſt
an vnthankfull people: how much more
ſhall they themſelues, their continuall
labours and ſermons, teſtifie againſt
them, to their vtter shame and confuſion?
            And if our Sauiour Chriſt pronounce ſo
hard a ſentēce againſt Chorazin, Bethſaida
&amp; Capernaum, amongſt whō he preached
but a ſmall time: what ſhall become of vs,

that haue had the Goſpell preached ſo often,
and ſo long a time. Our Sauiour preached
publikely in the world, but three
yeares onely: he taught in many other places,
he beſtowed but ſome of that time in
thoſe Cities. Now if one yeares preaching,
two or three yeeres preaching be ſufficient,
to drawe vpon an impenitent people,
ſuch heauie iudgements and damnation:
what ſhall become of thoſe, which haue
had the Goſpell preached, ſome tenne
yeares, ſome 20. ſome 30. ſome 40. ſome
50. yeares? and yet haue beene, and are ſtill
moſt vnthankfull, and vnprofitable hearers.
The lawe of nature was ſufficient to
make vs inexcuſable, much more the morall
lawe of God written, and moſt of all, if
to these two be ioyned the Goſpell of
Chriſt, theſe are three heauie witneſſes againſt
vs. But to come to the example we
haue in hand, and to make ſome ſpeciall
vſe of it to our owne ſoules; This woman
the Queene of the South, ſhall riſe in iudgment,
&amp; condemne this generation wherin
we liue. She trauelleth far, taketh vpon
her a great, long, teadious, dangerous,
painefull and coſtly iourney: but many amongſt
vs, are ſecure, idle, and ſloathfull;
fewe or none will labour for it. Nay, they

will ſcarce haue it, receiue it, though they
may haue it with eaſe, without any coſt or
labour. If any haue care and conſcience to
ſeeke for wiſedome abroad, wanting it at
home: ſuch are derided, ſcoffed, hated, and
perſecuted, by the moſt ſort of men. This
woman reuerenceth her teacher, and thinketh
nothing too deare for him. Many deſpiſe
their faithfull teachers, little regarding
their doctrine, ſeeking their diſcredit,
and offering them iniuries: and as for
maintenance, they thinke a litle, too much,
they grudge to giue that little, which the
lawe alloweth, in many places, and hardly
can any be drawne to voluntarie contributions,
and if they be, they are ſoone
wearie of it.Exod. 2. The Children of Iſrael doe offer
voluntarie gifts, for the building of the
tabernacle, as gold, ſiluer, precious ſtones:
and they were ſo free, and gaue ſo much,
that the Lord ſaid to Moſes, The people
bring too much, and more then enough
for the vſe of the worke which the Lord
hath commanded to be made.Exod 36. And in an
other place,1. Chron. 29. the people and Princes offering
many thouſand tallents of gold, ſiluer,
and precious stones: It is ſaid, The people
reioyced, when they offered willingly.
And Dauid the King, reioyced with great

and bleſſed God, for their franke offering.
Where are ſuch people? where are
ſuch hearts? ſo free and liberall to maintaine
Gods houſe? In an other place, The
children of Iſrael, they pulled their eare-rings
from their eares, to make a golden
Calfe: and Baalls Prophets are richly and
liberally maintained. Our forefathers haue
beene very bountifull, and prodigall, in
maintaining Idolatrous Prieſts: they gaue
indeed too much to the Church, euen the
very wealth and fatte of the world: but we
are come to an other extremitie, they gaue
too much, we giue little or nothing: nay
that which is worſt of all, we take away
that, which was giuen by others. Oh what
account ſhall theſe make, which ſpoyle &amp;
robbe the Church, Nay which robbe God
himſelfe? If Chriſt ſhall ſay to thoſe, which
haue not releeued and harboured his ſeruants,
Depart yee curſed to euerlaſting
fire: ſhall not thoſe be partakers of that
heauie ſentence, to whom the iudge may
truly ſay, I had meate &amp; drinke of my own,
but you tooke it from me: I had houſe and
harbour, but you thruſt me out? Whoſoeuer
they be that are not readie, &amp; willing,
to releeue, and maintaine, the faithfull teachers:
they thinke baſely of the word: they

doe not truly loue it, nor take it to be their
felicitie: for as loue is painefull to ſeeke for
wiſdome, ſo it is bountiful, to maintaine it.
Want of maintenance is the decay of learning,
&amp; religion, &amp; by this pollicie, Sathan
doth hinder &amp; keep backe many from this
calling, and diſcomfort many that are in it.
Therefore not onely this woman, but alſo
many other, as the Iewes and our forefathers,
yea Iezabell in maintaining Baalls
Prieſts, ſhall condemne, the miſerablenes,
the couetouſnes, the hard dealing and vnkindneſſe
of this our age, againſt the true
miniſters of the Goſpell. Againe, this woman
accounteth it the chiefe happineſſe in
earth, to heare true wiſedome; we preferre
euery profit before it, wee ſpeake and
thinke baſely of it, we haue neither true
deſire nor delight to be exerciſed in it;
either publikely or priuately; we eſteeme
too much of follie, we haue no true reſolution
to hazard life or goods for this
wiſedome: nay we deface and diſcredit it
by our bad liues; and therefore we doe
not truely loue it, nor make it our ioy or
happines: and therefore this woman ſhall
riſe in iudgement againſt vs, and her
example doth make much to our ſhame
and condemnation. Finally, this woman

was with Salomon but ſome ſhort time,
ſhe could not ſtay long, hauing a kingdome,
it may be, ſhe ſtayed ſome fewe
weekes, or monethes, and in ſo ſhort time,
ſhe is called, and conuerted, by the force
and power of Salomons wiſedome: we
haue had a long time, a greater wiſedome
then Salomons, and yet it hath had no ſuch
power for the good and conuerſion of many;
and let vs here ſet downe our reſt a
little. The word of the Lord is mightie
through God, to caſt downe holdes, caſting
downe the imaginations, and euery
hie thing that is exalted againſt the knowledge
of God, and bringing into Captiuitie
euery thought to the obedience of
Chriſt; It is able to conuert ſoules, and to
redreſſe the waies of young men, be they
neuer ſo leaude, wilde, or wanton: This
wiſedome is of that power (if it enter into
thy heart and delight thy ſoule) that it
will preſerue thee from the waies of wicked
men and women. It is a preſeruatiue
againſt all ſinne. It is compared, to a hammer,
and to a fire, which are of great force:
by the hammer and fire, the ſmith buckles
and bends the hard yron to his vſe and
purpoſe; and is not the hammer of Gods
word, able to bruiſe, and buckle, &amp; breake

our ſtonie and hard hearts? the fire hath
power to enflame, to conſume, to purge,
and ſhall not the fire of Gods word be as
powerfull, to kindle zeale in our hearts, to
conſume ſinne, and to purifie and clenſe
vs within? This word is compared, to a
ſhaft or an arrowe, which ſtriketh and entreth
deepely: and is not the word able to
ſtrike our hearts, and to pearce them
through; It is compared to raine, which
ſinketh and ſoaketh into the earth, and
ſoftneth the hard ground; and ſhall not
ſo many ſweet ſhowers and deawes from
heauen, enter into our hearts, ſoften them,
and make them fruitfull in grace? finally,
it is the power of God to ſaluation, and
ſharper then any two edged ſword; and
can it not wound vs, and cut downe out
ſinnes, the enemies of our ſoule? The Apoſtle
ſaith, That ſuch is the power of prophecying,
that it is able to conuert an Infidell;
there hath beene great power of naturall
philoſophie, in drawing men from
the hatred of ſinne, to the loue of vertue.
A Philoſopher could ſay, when he ſaw a
vitious man, that he himſelfe had beene
as bad, if he had not giuen himſelfe to the
ſtudie of Philoſophie: And ſhall not the
profeſſion, ſtudie and preaching of heauenly

wiſedome, be of greater power to
vs: there is an example of one Polemon of
Athens, a wild and Luxurious young man,
delighting and reioycing in infami
                  •
               ; like
ſome of the ſwaggering youths of our
daies; this young man ſpending a whole
night in drinking and wantonnes, after the
Sunne riſing, returning home from his riotouſnes,
he entred into the ſchoole of Xenocrates,
the Philoſopher, not to learne,
but to laugh, and deride him. The Philoſopher
omitting the matter he was intreating
of, began to ſpeake of modeſtie and
temperance; and he did it with ſuch grauitie
and authoritie, that he ſo moued the
young man, that he ſhewed open ſignes
of ſorrowe and repentance, and after forſooke
his luxurious life. A worthy example,
to the ſhame &amp; condemnation of many
both old and young in our age, which
heare daily many worthy ſermons, full
of grace, and power, and yet they are
impudent, deſperate, graceleſſe, and hard
harted; nothing▪ can moue them to ſorrowe
and humiliation for their ſinnes: If
ſuch be the power of naturall Philoſophie,
farre greater is the power of heauenly wiſdome.
As one doth moſt ſoundly and truly
deſcribe it: Onely the heauenly doctrine

ſaith hee (the which alone is wiſedome,Lactant inſtit: lib: 3. Chap. 26.)
bringeth to paſſe thoſe things, which the
Philoſophers were neuer able to doe. The
commandemēts of God (becauſe they are
ſincere and pure,) of how great force they
are in the hearts of men, daily experience
doth ſhew it. Bring me a man inclined to
anger, ill tongued, vnruly, and raſh, with a
few of Gods words I wil make him as quiet
as a lambe: Bring me a couetous perſon,
a greedie ſcraper, and a niggard, hence
forth will I make him liberall. Bring me
one that is fearefull of death, and of paine,
ſtraightway, he will deſpiſe both gallous
and fire, and dangers, yea the torments of
the Brazen Bull: Bring me him, that is a
leacher, an adulterer, a ruffion, and a rioter;
henceforth ſhalt thou ſee him ſober, chaſte
and continent: Bring me a cruell perſon,
&amp; one that thirſteth after blood, ſoone ſhal
that furie be changed into clemencie and
mercy: Bring me an vniuſt man, vnwiſe, &amp;
ſinfull, he ſhall ſtraitway be iuſt, wiſe, innocent,
&amp; harmeleſſe; ſo great is the might
of godly wiſdome, that being powred into
the hart of men, it will at once, euen at one
puſh, expell and driue out fooliſhnes. Hath
euer yet hitherto any of the Philoſophers
performed theſe things? Or if he were

willing, were he able to doe it? who when
they haue ſpent their whole time in the
ſtudie of Philoſophie, yet neuertheleſſe
are not able (if nature doe a little withſtand
it) to make themſelues, or any others
the better therewith. Their wiſedome
therefore, how much ſoeuer it can doe, yet
doth it not roote out vices, but hide them;
but a fewe of Gods commandements doe
ſo throughly and wholy change man, and
ſo make him new, that thou canſt not
knowe him to be the ſame man he was.
The meaning of this worthy man is, that
the wiſedome of the word excelleth infinitely
the wiſedome of nature, be it neuer
ſo abſolute: And howſoeuer Philoſophers
ſometimes might make ſome men aſhamed
of their vices, and to forſake them:
yet they could neuer throughly conuert
any, becauſe they could not teach them
true religion, and the feare of God, which
is the beginning of all true wiſedome. Many
examples we haue of the power of
Gods word, in the calling and conuerting
of mens ſoules. By this, both this woman
and the Niniuites were conuerted. Peter
preaching euen to thoſe Iewes that crucified
Chriſt, their hearts were pricked, and
they ſaid, Men and brethren what ſhall we

doe? And by that ſermon he wonne three
thouſand ſoules to God: Oh the mightie
power of the word, if the Lord lay his helping
hand to it.Act: 16. Paul preached to Lidea,
ſhe gaue attendance to Pauls preaching:
the Lord opened her heart, and ſo both ſhe
and her houſe was conuerted: In the ſame
manner was the Iaylor and his houſehould
conuerted. In an other place, the word was
of ſuch power, that the beleeuers came and
confeſſed, and ſhewed their workes, and
many alſo of them, which vſed curious
Artes, brought their bookes and burned
them before all men, and they counted
the price of them, and found it fiftie thouſand
peeces of ſiluer (which was of our
money about 2000. markes) ſo the word
of God grewe mightily and preuailed.
Thus we ſee, that the word hath beene
heretofore of great power to winne ſoules
to God. Is it now become weake and feeble:
nay the fault is not in the word, but
in the 
                  •
               tubbornnes &amp; hardnes of our harts,
which will not suffer it to enter, nor giue it
any place. The word is the ſame it was, it
is the ſame ſeede, but is now ſowne in a
bad ſoyle, and therefore it will n
                  •
               t, nor
cannot fructifie; And that you may know,
whether the word hath this power in you

or no, for the conuerſion of your ſoules,
remember this worthie &amp; excellent counſell,
for your inſtruction and direction.
When any is conuerted to the Lord, the
vaile is taken away: therefore the cauſe of
taking away the vaile, is our conuerſion to
God; From whence we may gather, that
whilſt in reading the ſcriptures, the vnderſtanding
of them is kept from vs, and
whilſt, that which is written is abſcure
and ſhut vp from vs, we are not yet conuerted
to the Lord: for if we were conuerted,
(no doubt) the vaile would be
taken away. Let vs ſee what it is to be
conuerted to the Lord. But that we may
the more clearely knowe, what is to be
conuerted, let vs firſt ſee, what is to be
auerted, that is turned from the Lord.
Euery one then, that when the words of
the lawe is repeated, is occupied in common
fables, he is auerted; Euery one
which is bound with the cares of poſſeſſions,
with the deſires of riches, and
of the glory, and honour of the world,
he is auerted; that is, turned from the
Lord: He which ſeemeth to be eſtraunged
from theſe things, and ſitteth and heareth
the words of the law, and is attentiue
with his countenance &amp; eyes, but his heart

and thoughts are wandring, he is auerted;
that is, turned from the Lord. What is it
then to be conuerted and turned to God?
If we caſt all theſe things behind our
backes, and giue our ſelues in ſtudie,
in deeds, in minde, and care to the word
of God, to meditate in his lawe day and
night,Oreg: in Exod: Hom: 12. Chap 41. letting paſſe all other things, let
vs giue our ſelues to God. Let vs be exerciſed
in his teſtimonies: this is to be conuerted
to the Lord. If thou wouldeſt haue
thy ſonne to learne the liberall ſciences,
doſt thou not free him from other things?
for this cauſe, thou doſt prouide a ſchoolemaiſter
and bookes, and thou doſt ſpare
for no coſt, to haue thy purpoſe brought
to paſſe. Which of vs doth ſo giue himſelfe
to the ſtudie of Gods lawe? who
doth with ſuch ſtudie and labour, ſeeke
for heauenly things, as he doth for humane
and earthly? and why doe we complaine,
that we are ignorant of that, which
we learne not? Some of you, ſo ſoone as
they heare that reiected which is read,
they ſtraite goe away, there is no inquiſition
of that which hath beene ſpoken,
no conſcience, no remembrance: where
as it is ſaide, Aske thy fathers, and
they will tell thee: Aske thy teachers,

and they will teach thee: Some tarrie not
ſo long, till the lectures be ended; ſome
though they heare, vnderſtand not, being
in the lower parts of Gods houſe, and occupied
with fables, of whom I dare ſay,
that when Moſes is read, there is not onely
a vaile vpon their heart, but there is a
wall ſet betwixt them. If he that is preſent
which doth heare and is attentiue, and
doth enquire and diſcuſſe of thoſe things
which he heareth, and that which he cannot
vnderſtand, he doth aske the meaning
of others, and ſo learneth, he that ſhutteth
his eares leaſt he ſhould heare, and turneth
away his face from hearing: how is the
vaile taken away from his heart? Let vs
take heed then, that when Moſes is read,
when Paul is read, there be not a vaile vpon
our heart. Certainely if we heare negligently,
and haue no care to learne and vnderſtand,
not onely the ſcripture of the
Lawe and Prophets, but of the Apoſtles
and Euangeliſts, we are hidden and couered
with a great vaile, and I doe feare, that
by the negligence and fooliſhnes of our
heart, that the diuine volumes are not only
hidden from vs, but ſealed: as if a booke
ſhould be giuen into the hands of man to
read, and he anſwereth, he cannot read, or

that it is ſealed. And therefore we muſt
haue a care, not onely to learne the ſcriptures,
but we muſt entreate the Lord, by
ſupplications day &amp; night, that the lambe
of the tribe of Iudah may come &amp; vouchſafe,
to take this ſealed booke and open it:
And indeed, it is Paul that planteth, and
Apollo watreth, but it is God that giues
the encreaſe; he is the author of our miniſterie,
the author of the word, the giuer of
all gifts and graces to his ſeruants. Good
ſeede is ſowne in ſundrie grounds, but it
doth not fructifie in all: Man ſpeaketh to
the outward eare, but God muſt ſpeake inwardly
to the heart: or elſe the word will
haue no power to conuert the ſoule. The
Goſpell is heard (ſaith a father) ſome beleeue,
and ſome beleeue not: They which
beleeue, they heare and learne from the
father: they which beleeue not, they heare
outwardly, but they neither heare nor
learne inwardly: that is, to them it is giuen
to beleeue,Mat. 13. 14. to the other it is not giuen▪ So
ſaith our Sauiour to the Apoſtles: To you
it is giuen to know the ſecrets of the kingdome
of heauen, but to others it is not giuen.
Act: 13. 48. It is ſaid in an other place: As many
as were ordained to eternall life beleeued,
when Paul &amp; Barnabas preached. Though

Prophets ſpeake to vs, though Apoſtles,
though Salomon, though Iohn the Baptiſt,
though Angels and Chriſt himſelfe
ſpeake: yet they ſhall nothing auaile to
conuert vs, except God open our hearts.
The Lord raigneth,Aug: de benedict: Eſau. &amp; Iac. both vpon the corne
and vpon the thornes; but hee ſendeth
Raine vpon the Corne, for the barne, and
vpon the thornes for the fire, and yet it is
the ſame raine: ſo the word of God is
powred vpon all, let euery one ſee what
roote he hath, let him ſee whether he
draweth the good raine, if he drawe it to
engender thornes, is the raigne of God
to be accuſed, before it come to the
roote? that is a ſweete raine, till it
come to a bad heart. Now that the
word may haue more power in vs hereafter,
let vs caſt off naturall blindnes, carnall
ſecuritie, our olde ſinnes and worldly
cares: let vs come with hungrie, and
humble hearts, denying our ſelues, and
deſirous to learne: let vs come with repentance
for our ſinnes, and a ſincere
loue to the word; And aboue all things,
let vs pray hartily, and continually to
the father and founder of all good gifts,
for the bleſſings of all good leſſons and
inſtructions to our ſoules; let vs confeſſe

our owne weakenes,Cant. 1. 3. and ſay in our ſoules,
with the ſpouſe to her husband Chriſt,
Drawe me, and we will runne after thee.
Finally,Pſ: 119. ver. 13. let vs pray with Dauid, be beneficiall
to thy ſeruant, that I may liue and
keepe thy word,18. open mine eyes, that I
may ſee the wonders of thy lawes.32. I will
runne the waies of thy commandements
when thou ſhalt inlarge my heart.33. Teach
me (ô Lord) the way of thy ſtatutes, and
I will keepe it to the end,34. Giue me vnderſtanding,
and I will keepe thy lawe,
yea I will keepe it with my whole heart:35.
Direct me in the path of thy commandements,
36. for therein is my delight. Incline
my heart to thy teſtimonies, and
not to couetouſnes,37. turne away my eyes
from regarding vanitie, and quicken me
in thy way.ver. 132. Looke vpon me, and be
mercifull to me, as thou vſeſt to doe to
thoſe that feare thy name.133. Direct my
ſteppes in thy word, and let none iniquitie
haue dominion ouer me.Pſ: 143. 10. Teach me
to doe thy will, for thou art my God.
Let thy good ſpirit lead me vnto the
land of righteouſnes.Pſal 86. 11. And in an other
place▪ Teach me thy way (ô Lord) and
I will walke in thy truth: Knit my heart to
thee, that I may feare thy name.
            
               
And let vs pray with the Prophet Ieremie;
Ier: 17. 14. Heale me ô Lord and I ſhal be whole;
ſaue me,Lament. 5. 21. and I ſhall be ſaued; for thou a
                  •
               t
my praiſe, turne thou vs vnto thee ô Lord,
and we ſhall be turned. And indeed the
calling and conuerſion of a ſinner, is the
great worke of God; as great as the worke
of our creation: And indeed, what is our
conuerſion? but an new creation: for God
(that commandeth light to ſhine out of
darknes) is he, which ſhineth in the he arts
of his children conuerted. It is he, that
muſt, make both the eare and the heart
tractable and flexible. It is he, that both
muſt make vs willing to doe good, and alſo
able to doe good. It is he, that muſt inwardly
perſwade the heart, and by his ſpirit
teach vs inwardly, before we can be
truely conuerted. Let therefore miniſters
of the word, giue attendance to reading,
exhortation, and doctrine. Let them ſtirre
vp the grace of God, that worthy thing
in them. Let them be faithfull and wiſe
ſtewards, in diſpoſing the ſecrets of God.
Let them preach ſincerely, diligently and
feruently. Let their affections and life be
vpright and holie. Let them be wholy
poſſeſſed with the deſire of Gods glory,
with the loue of Chriſt, and with loue to

the ſoules of the people, and then their
miniſtrie ſhall be acceptable to God. If
not powerful to conuert, yet to confound:
their recompence ſhall be with the Lord:
their labour ſhall not be in vaine in the
Lord. We are vnto God ſaith the Apoſtle,
the ſweet Sauiour of Chriſt in them which
are ſaued, and in them which periſh: to
the one we are the Sauiour of death vnto
death: and to the other, a Sauiour of life
vnto life: and who is ſufficient for theſe
things? And ſeeing that Paul is nothing,
Apollos is nothing: but the effect and
bleſſing is of God: Let them ſtriue and
wraſtle with them, by humble and hartie
prayer, continually, vehemently, priuately,
and openly, for the aſſiſtance of his ſpirit,
and the bleſſing of their labours: that he
would perſwade Iapheth, that he might
dwell in the tents of Shem, that he would
circumciſe the hearts and eares of the people,
and take from them, the vaile that hindreth,
as ignorance, prophanes, vnbeleefe,
hardnes of heart, and ſuch like. That he
would power water vpon the thirſtie, and
floods vpon the drie ground. That hee
would take away their ſtonie hearts, and
giue them hearts of fleſh: that ſo they
might walke in his ſtatutes: finally, that

he would giue them vnderſtanding hearts,
that they might be fulfilled with the
knowledge of his will, in all wiſedome.
That they may diſcerne the things that
differ; that they may be pure, and without
offence, vntill the day of Chriſt. That
they may walke worthy of the Lord, and
pleaſe him in all things, that the ſame
ſignes of conuerſion may be ſeene in their
people, as were truely found in this woman.
And indeed, many, if not all, the
notes of good hearers, which in the beginning
I obſerued in her, are true ſignes
and notes of her calling: In that ſhe takes
ſo great paines, and beſtowes ſo much
coſt, to ſeeke for true wiſedome: In that
ſhe is ſo carefull to enquire, and ſearch
out the truth of religion. In that ſhe ſpeaketh
and thinketh ſo reuerently of Salomon
her teacher, repoſing true happines
in true wiſedome, and ſtirreth vp others
to be of her minde: theſe and ſundrie
other, are ſignes and tokens of her
conuerſion.
            She ſpeaketh not like a Pagan, Heathen
or Idolater: but like a worſhipper
of the true God: ſhe bleſſeth him, and
confeſſeth him to be the diſpoſer of kingdomes;
and acknowledgeth Iſraell to be

Gods people; and howſoeuer before, either
by ſecret inſpiration, or by report,
ſhe heard of the true God, of his worſhip,
and of Salomons wiſedome: yet now ſhe
doth fullie taſte the truth of it, in her
owne ſoule: the ſecrets of her hearts are
made manifeſt, ſhee worſhippeth God,
and ſaith plainely, that God was in that
place.
            The diuine wiſedome of Salomon had
parſwaded this daughter of Iapheth, to
come to the tents of Shem, to be a member
of the viſible Church, and to imbrace
the truth of religion, and no doubt ſhe
went ioyfully home, and indeuoured (by
all meanes poſſible,) to eſtabliſh the lawe
and worſhip of the true God in her owne
countrie.
            Our Sauiour (as you haue heard) commended
this woman, and ioyneth her
with the Niniuites, who no doubt truely
repented, though many of them fell away
afterwards. It is true, that all the Kings
of the earth ſought the preſence of Salomon,
ver: 24. to heare his wiſedome, that God
had put in his heart, as we may ſee in this
chapter.
            I doe not ſay that all theſe were called
and conuerted. It may be many of them

came to heare and ſee newes, rather for humane
then diuine wiſedome; to ſee the
glory and royaltie of Salomon: the beautie
of the Temple, and his Pallace, which
he had builded, or vpon ſome other ſiniſter
reſpects: Among ſo many, this woman
is eſpecially named, ſingled out, and
commended, yea a whole ſtorie is recorded
of her, and not of the reſt: the cauſe
of her comming was religion: She loſt not
her labour, but got fruit and profit by her
comming, and ſheweth plaine teſtimonies
of her conuerſion. Indeed ſomething is
ſaid of King Hyram, that he euer loued
Dauid, and when he hard the words of Salomon,

                  
                     •
                  . King. 5. 8. he reioyced greatly, and ſaid; Bleſſed
be the Lord this day, which hath giuen
to Da
                  •
               id a wiſe ſonne, ouer this mightie
people: And by his power and helpe he
furthereth and helpeth Salomon in building
a houſe to the name of the Lord his
God. The learned doe obſerue; That in
this King is prefigured the vocation of the
gentiles, who ſhould helpe to build the
ſpirituall Temple of Chriſt, and indeed, he
ſpeaketh religiouſly, reioycing when he
heard Salomons words, and bleſſing the
true God for him; as great tokens of calling
and conuerſion (if not greater) are

apparant in this woman: If ſhe amongſt
others be a figure of the calling of the gentiles,
then it muſt needs follow, that ſhe
her ſelfe was alſo called, for though God
made a ſeparation betwixt Iewes and
Gentiles, and choſe to himſelfe for a time
the ſeed of Abraham, ſo that the generall
calling of the Gentiles was not before
Chriſt his comming in the fleſh: yet God
had alwaies ſome amongſt them, as King
Hyram, Naamon the Syrian, Iob, this
Queene, and others. She ſeekes for true
wiſedome from Salomon, and finds it. The
Church ſeekes for the treaſures of all
knowledge, comfort, and ioy from Chriſt.
She commends and magnifies Salomon:Cant. 2.
the Church magnifieth Chriſt, accounting
him as her well beloued husband. She pronounceth
Salomons followers &amp; ſeruants
to be bleſſed: the Church accounteth
them happie, who heare and receiue Chriſt
in this life; and them more happie, who
behold his glory for euer in the life to
come.Rom: 12. 1. She giueth Salomon precious gifts:
the Church giueth Chriſt the beſt things
ſhe hath, euen her body and ſoule, as a liuing
ſacrifice, louing Chriſt aboue all, and
forſaking all for his ſake,Gen: 12. as Abraham forſooke
his owne countrey, the Apoſtles

their nettes,Mat. 4. and Paul accounteth all thing
                  •
               
droſſe and dung in compariſon of Chriſt.Phil: 
                     •
                  . 8.
And as in this woman, we haue a figure of
the calling of the Church of the Gentiles:
ſo in Salomon we haue a tipe and figure
of Chriſts Salomons kingdome, a figure
of Chriſts kingdome: his wiſedome, a
figure of Chriſts wiſedome: his glory, a
ſhadow of Chriſts glory: his riches, a tipe
of Chriſts ſpirituall riches: his Temple,
a tipe of Chriſts Temple.
            And as Salomon doth kindly accept
the gifts and preſents of this woman,
though hee had no neede of them; ſo
doth Chriſt as kindly accept the ſeruice
of his Church.
            And therefore this ſhould encourage
vs, to giue him the beſt things we haue▪
with willing and chearefull hearts, ſeeing
he is as willing to accept of them, a
                  •
               
Salomon doth the gifts of this Queene.
Againe, Salomon beſtoweth on her euery
pleaſant thing, which ſhe asketh; Chriſt
giueth to his, whatſoeuer they aske in his
fathers name; he giueth vs better thing
                  •
               
then Salomon ſhould giue this Queene;
namely, hee giueth to vs himſelfe, his
body and blood, his ſpirit, his word, all
ſpirituall graces, yea life eternall. For

howſoeuer there is ſome reſemblance betweene
Salomon and Chriſt, yet he is
more excellent then any Patriarke, Prince,
Prophet, or Saint whatſoeuer. Salomon
a King of the earthly Ieruſalem: Chriſt
the King of the ſpirituall and heauenly
Ieruſalem, of the militant and triumphant
Church. Salomon a King of peace,
of outward and earthly peace. Chriſt
the King of inward and euerlaſting peace.
Salomon excelled all Kings of his time
in wiſedome and knowledge: Chriſt the
founder and treaſurer of wiſedome: Of
his fulnes haue we all receiued, grace for
grace, for God hath not giuen him the
ſpirit by meaſure. Salomon a Prophet, a
Preacher; Chriſt as the King of all Kings,
ſo the Prince of all Prophets and Preachers.
Salomon and all the reſt ſpake by
him, Salomon but a man: Chriſt both
man and God, Omnipotent, Creator of
all things.
            Salomon a greeuous ſinner: Chriſt
pure, vndefiled, without ſinne; the Sauiour
of repenting ſinners, meriting life
for them, and making his word effectuall
in them.
            And now let vs further note, from this
religious woman, that religion belongeth

to women: God is their Creator, and therfore
they are to ſerue him. The firſt woman
was created in the image of God, which is
true wiſedome, holines, and righteouſnes,
which was loſt by the fall of their firſt parents,
and they muſt ſeeke to recouer it in
Chriſt▪ who died for them, as well as for
men. They are partakers of both the ſacraments:
they haue ſoules to ſaue as well
as others: they are the weaker veſſels, and
ſooner ouercome of Sathan: they haue
many ſpeciall infirmities: they are partakers
of many bleſſings and deliuerances
from God. Therefore religion, the feare of
God, and diuine wiſedome, appertaineth
to them.Luk: 8. Beſides theſe reaſons, we haue
plentie of holy examples in the ſcripture,Luk: 10.
as Euah,2. Iohn: Sarah, Rebecca, Debora, Marie,
and Elizabeth,2. Tim. 1. with many other, holie and
religious women. If then religion belong
to women, then much more to men. As
they excell in place and power, ſo they
ſhould excell in grace and wiſdome. They
ſhould be examples of zeale, and pietie,
and teachers of their wiues and families.
This ſerueth for the confutation of the Papiſts,
who locke vp the ſcriptures from
men and women, teaching that doth not
belong to them, to ſearch the ſcriptures.

This alſo maketh againſt prophane and
careleſſe women, who are altogether negligent
in the matters of religion, as though
it did not belong to their Sexes at all.
Here are alſo reproued wicked and prophane
husbands, who doe not further, but
altogether hinder their wiues, in the exerciſe
and zeale of religion. And moſt curſed
are all Athieſts &amp; carnall men, who ſcorne
and deride any profeſſion or ſhew of religion
in women. And finally, here is comfort,
and incouragement for all forward
and religious women: this may be to ſtirre
them vp to proceed, &amp; go on, in the way of
godlines, hauing ſo many, both reaſons
and examples ſet before them, mouing
and enforcing them to the zeale of religion.
And as it appertaineth to all men and
women in generall: ſo more eſpecially,
to Gentiles. Nobles, Lords, Ladies, Kings,
and Queenes: as they excell and ſhine before
others in diet, in apparell, in poſſeſſions,
and dignities; ſo ſhould they goe before
them in ſpirituall graces: As they haue
receiued more bleſſings from the Lord, ſo
are they more tied and bound to him againe;
and more zeale, pietie, and thankefulnes,
is required at their hands, according
to the ſaying of our Sauiour: To

whom much is giuen, of him much ſhall be
required. Their places and honours, ſhould
be inducements to pietie: as Samuel ſaid
to Saul: The Lord ſent me to annoynt
thee King ouer Iſrael,1. Sam: 15. 1. now therefore obey
the words of the voyce of the Lord. As if
he ſhould haue ſaid, becauſe God hath honoured
thee, thou art bound to obey him.
It is their chiefe honour to honour God.
Thoſe that honour me,1. Sam: 2. 30. I will honour ſaith
the Lord. The examples of great perſons
doth moſt good or moſt hurt: If they be
godly, they are a meanes to winne many
ſoules to God, by their good examples to
drawe them to the exerciſe of true religion.
If they be wicked, they infect &amp; dr
                  •
               we
many to deſtruction with them. Therefore
religion doth chiefely concerne great perſons.
Here is a Queene religious, and here
is King Salomon, a profeſſor and teacher
of religion: and Bethſeba his mother deſcribing
a good Queene, a fit wife for Salomon.
She ſaith, who ſhall finde a vertuous
woman, for her price is far aboue the
Pearles: And though ſhe commend care
and painefulnes in ſuch a woman, in prouiding
for her familie; yet the chiefe thing
that ſhe commendeth in ſo great a perſon,
is vertue and religion; Strength and honour

(ſaith ſhe) is her clothing,Pro: 31. 10. 25. 30. and in the
latter day ſhe ſhall reioyce. She openeth
her mouth with wiſedome, and the lawe
of grace is in her tongue. Fauour is deceitfull,
beautie is vanitie; but a woman that
feareth the Lord, ſhe ſhall be praiſed.
Theſe be the words of a woman, of a
Queene, of a religious woman, of Salomons
mother, inſpired by the holy Ghoſt;
directing her beloued ſonne Salomon,
what he ſhould chiefely require in the
choyce of a wife. A glaſſe for women to
looke into, though they be neuer ſo high
or great in the world: wherein they may
behold and ſee, what things are chiefely
required of them, for their credit and
comforts: namely, vertue, wiſedome, and
religion.
         
         
            
            THE FIFTH
SERMON.
            
               Verſ. 9.
               
                  
                     ver. 9. Bleſſed be the Lord thy God, which loued
thee, to ſet thee on the throne of Iſrael,
becauſe the Lord loued Iſrael for euer, and
made thee King, to doe equitie and righteouſnes.
               
            
            VVE haue heard alreadie many
things in commendation of this
worthie and famous Queene: and yet ſtill
we muſt perſiſt vpon that argument. For
as the words before, ſo ſtill, the words of
this text are greatly to her praiſe and commendation.
She praiſeth the true God, ſhe
confeſſeth that it was of his meere goodnes,
that Salomon was preferred to the
kingdome; She gathereth thereby, that
God loued Iſrael, and would preſerue it:
She ſheweth the end, why he was placed

in his throne: ſhe ſpeaketh diuinely of the
bleſſing, dignitie, and dutie of a good
King. The words containe a thankſgiuing
and congratulation, for the preferment of
Salomon, to the kingdome of Iſrael: wherin,
we are firſt to obſerue her pietie to
God; and her loue to Salomon. Her pietie
to God, in that ſhe diſtinguiſheth him
from Idols, and falſe Gods; and worſhippeth
and bleſſeth him, as the true God:
She calleth him the God of Salomon: not
that he was proper, and peculiar to him,
(for he is the God of all the world) but becauſe
he ſhewed ſpeciall loue, and fauour
to Salomon; ſo is he called the God of
Abraham, of Iſaacke and Iacob, the God
of Daniell. It is an honour to vs, in that he
vouchſafeth ſo to be called. It is the glory
of Saints, that as ye
                Apoſtle ſaith, their God
is not aſhamed of them, to be called their
God. It is a happie thing then, to be the
friend of God, he hath ſuch in memorie,
they are within his ſpeciall care and protection.
And as the Pſalmiſt ſaith:Pſ: 144. 15. Bleſſed
are the people, whoſe God is the Lord.
She bleſſeth this God, ſaying: Bleſſed be
the Lord thy God: A common manner of
thankſgiuing in the ſcriptures, we are ſaid
to bleſſe God, and God is ſaid to bleſſe vs.

He bleſſeth vs, when he beſtoweth his
bleſſings vpon vs; we bleſſe him, when we
giue him thankes, for his bleſſings beſtowed.
An example of both,Ephe: 1. we haue in theſe
words of the Apoſtle: Bleſſed be God,
euen the father of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt,
who hath bleſſed vs with all ſpirituall
bleſſings in heauenly things, here are the
bleſſings of God vpon the faithfull, and
here againe the faithfull doe praiſe and
bleſſe God for the ſame.Phil. 4. 6. Thankſgiuing is
a part of Gods worſhip, &amp; a part of prayer,
and therefore the Apoſtle ſaith;Theſ: 5. 17. 18. In all
things let your requeſts be ſhewed to
God, in prayer, and ſupplication, with the
giuing of thankes. And againe, Pray continually,
and in all things giue thankes; for
this is the will of God in Chriſt Ieſus towards
you. By this we teſtifie our humilitie,
and loue towards God: It is a debt
due to him, and all the tribute we can pay
vnto him. It is a benefit to our ſelues: becauſe
by it, we are imboldned to craue
more bleſſings of him. It is the finall end
of all Gods benefits. Let vs therefore offer
the ſacrifice of praiſe alwaies to God,Heb: 13. 15. that
is, the fruit of the lippes, which confeſſe
his name. Now we are to praiſe him for
all bleſſings, euen for the leaſt, whether

ſpirituall,Gen: 24. or temporall. Abrahams ſeruant
praiſed God, for proſpering his iourney.
Melchiſedecke bleſſed God,Gen. 14. for deliuering
Abraham and Lot from the hand of
their enemies. Chriſt himſelfe whenſoeuer
he eate,Iohn: 6. 11. though it were but barley bread,
and a fewe fiſhes, lift vp his eyes, and
gaue thankes;1. Cor: 10. 31. and therefore the Apoſtle
wiſheth vs, that whether wee eate, or
drinke, or whatſoeuer we doe, we doe
all to the glory of God. If we are to
praiſe God for the leaſt benefites, much
more for the greateſt; If for earthly, much
more for heauenly; If for the foode of
the body, much more for the foode of
the ſoule; If for deliuerance from the
enemies of the body, much more for
the deliuerance from the enemies of our
ſoules. Neither are we to praiſe God
onely for our ſelues,Phil: 1. but alſo in regard
of others,Coll: 1. the Apoſtle (in his Epiſtles
written to the Churches) giueth thankes
for the faith, loue, and ſpirituall graces,
beſtowed vpon them. King Hyram when
he had heard of Salomons wiſedome, and
Raigne, reioyced greatly and bleſſed
God for him: And this Queene doth
the like, here in this place. How much
more had the ſubiects of Salomon, cauſe to

reioyce and praiſe God for ſuch a King;
And this is the dutie of good ſubiects, as
to pray for their gouernours, ſo to bleſſe
God continually, for the manifold benefites
they enioy through their good gouernment:
but of this I purpoſe to ſpeake
in an other place. Now as we haue ſeene
the pietie of this woman to God: ſo let vs
ſee her loue to Salomon, reioycing ſo
greatly at his preferment, and proſperitie.
For this is the fruit of loue;Rom: 12. 15. To reioyce,
with them that reioyce, and weepe with
them that weepe, and to be of like affection
one towards an other. The wicked enuie,
grudge, and repine, at the proſperitie
of others: and reioyce in their harmes.

proſperitie of Abell. Rachell the fruitfulnes
of Leah. Saul the felicitie of Dauid.
Through enuie, the fall of the world, and
the death of Chriſt was procured. An
other ſaith, that there is no felicitie ſo modeſt

and gentle, which can auoyd the teeth
of malice and ill will. Enuious men be
rich of other mens loſſe; wealthy with other
mens pouertie; immortall, with other
mens death. Wherefore one being asked
how a man might be free from enuie; anſwered,
if he had no great and worthy
gifts, or did nothing famous or praiſe worthy;

common in all. One Prince enuieth the
glory of an other. One rich man, the
wealth of an other. One miniſter the gifts
of an other. And the meaneſt ſort the better
ſtate of an other. But loue enuieth not,
but reioyceth at the proſperitie of others;
Enuie (ſaith one) is the daughter of pride;
But this mother pride cannot be barren:
whereſoeuer ſhe is, ſhe doth continually
bring forth: Suppreſſe the mother, and
there will be no daughter. This woman is
ſo full of loue and humilitie, that though
Salomon doth farre excell her in wiſedom,
in glory, in wealth: yet ſhe grieueth not at
it, but reioyceth, prayſing and bleſſing
God for it. And if ſhe doe thus reioyce
for the gouernment of Salomon; how
much more cauſe haue we to praiſe God
continually, for the gouernment of Chriſt?

for his kingdome of grace and glory: And

                  •
               
for the ſpirituall and heauenly kingdome
of Chriſt? Dauid praying for the proſperous

(who was but a figure of Chriſt) concludeth
thus: Bleſſed be the Lord God, euen

things, and bleſſed be his gloriou

Dauid being a long time reiected of Saul,
&amp; of the people, &amp; at length obtaining the
kingdome;Pſ. 118. 22. 23. 24. 26. 29. he exhorteth the people, to
ioy and thankſgiuing, ſaying: The ſtone,
which the builders refuſed, is become the
head of the corner, this is the Lords doing,
and it is maruellous in our eies. This is
the day, which the Lord hath made: let vs
reioyce &amp; be glad in it. Bleſſed be he, that
commeth in the name of the Lord: we
haue bleſſed you out of the houſe of the
Lord. Praiſe yee the Lord, becauſe he is
good: for his mercy endureth for euer.
Dauid was a figure of Chriſt, &amp; that place
is a plaine prophecie of Chriſt, &amp; was moſt

liuely fulfilled in him; And therefore, the
ſubiects of Chriſt are moſt hartily to reioyce,
for the gouernment of their Lord

Salomon and Iſrael, to be thankfull

for Salomons preferment; how much more
ought Salomon and Iſrael to do the ſame?
ſhe ſendeth them to the fountaine of all
graces, beſtowed vpon the King and ſubiects;
ſhe acknowledgeth God, the chiefe
Monarch and diſpoſer of Crownes: And
herein ſhe ſpeaketh diuinely, according
to the ſcripture in diuers places.Pro. 8. 15. 16. By me
Kings Raigne (ſaith wiſedome) and Princes

their throne, where he placeth them for

            The cauſe of all bleſſings and fauors, is not
any merit in vs, but the loue of God. The
Lord choſe Iſrael aboue other nations:Deut: 7. 8. not
for any worthines in them, but becauſe hee
loued them. All things come from God, to
his childdren in loue, bleſſings, honors, riches,
croſſes, &amp;c: Nothing to the wicked
in loue, their bleſſings are ioyned with a
Curſe, they are giuen with his lefte hand.
Except wee haue true Religion, Faith, and
regeneration, we cannot be aſſured of Gods
loue. And hence we learne: That it is a teſtimony
of loue, to be choſen to great places,
either in the Magiſtracie, or M

               niſtery:
ſo that wee be made willing and fit to diſcharge

            The Apoſtle counteth it a bleſsing to be
made an able miniſter of the New Teſtament.
2. Cor: 3, 9. Againe, hee counteth it a mercie of
God,2. Cor: 4. 1▪
                to be called to the Miniſterie. But
(Salomon ſaith) as ſnowe in ſummer, and
raine in harueſt, are not meete, ſo is honour
vnſeemely for a foole.
            Now let vs ſee the manifold teſtimonies

of Gods loue to Salomon. Before he was
borne, God choſe him to build his houſe,
preferred him before his father in that
worke, and promiſed to eſtabliſh his kingdome.
So ſoone as he was borne, he was
called Iedidiah, becauſe the Lord loued
him. He had a good father Dauid, a good
mother Bethſeba, and Nathan the Prophet
as his tutor and teacher. While his
father liued, he was annoynted King with
ioy and conſent of his father and people.
He was a yonger brother, therefore had
no right to the crowne by birth; yet was
choſen extraordinarily to be King, by
God himſelfe, (in like ſort was both Saul
and Dauid choſen) but afterward Kings
were created by election, or blood. God
appeared twiſe to him, and ſpake familiarly
with him. He gaue him his deſire, and
more too. He was King not of heathen or
infidels, but of Iſrael, Gods choſen, of Ieruſalem,
that holy Citie. He built a moſt
glorious Temple, prefiguring the true ſpirituall
Temple of God. He had peace in all
his countries from Dan to Berſheba. The
Amorites, Hittites, Perezites, Hiuites, Iebuſites
(which the children of Iſrael were
not able to ſubdue) he made them all tributaries
and bondmen. He had wiſedome

and vnderſtanding exceeding much, and a
large heart, euen as the ſand, that is on the
Sea ſhore; being wiſer then any man: and
hee was famous throughout all Nations
round about, and there came of all people
of the earth to heare his wiſedome, and hee
exceeded all the Kings of the earth, and all
the world, both in riches and wiſdome, and
all the world ſought to ſee Salomor, to heare
his wiſedome, which God put in his heart.
So that whatſoeuer God promiſed to Sal
                     •
                  
                  mon,
he performed faithfully to the full;2. Chro: 1. 12. that
none either before him or after him, were
or ſhould be like him.
            Wee thinke him famous, whoſe 
                  •
               ame
paſſeth but through a coūtrey or kingdom;
but his paſſed through the world: and that
not lightly, but with ſuch a power, that not
onely his ſubiects, but ſtrangers, Infidells,
Kings, and Queenes, came from the fartheſt
part of the world to ſee &amp; admire him.
As this Queene in this place.
            But ſome may obiect and ſay, Is Salomon
aboue all men and kings? was he wiſer then
Adam or Moſes? I anſwere, theſe were not
Kings, neither had they that kinde of glory
and power that he had. But was hee more
wiſe then the Egipti
                     •
                  n kings? or more mightie
and wiſe then his father Dauid? or more

powerfull, glorious, and worthie then the
Babylonian, Perſian, and Macedonian Kings?
Was hee more famous then Alexander, the
Conqueror of the world, or mightier then
Iulius Caeſar, or Augustus? or richer then
Croeſus? Hee is compared onely with the
Kings of Iſrael. He had not onely wiſdom,
not onely glorie, not onely power: but all
thoſe together; and herein is no king comparable
to him: what ſhould we ſay more?
his felicitie was admirable &amp; vnſpeakable,
and is largely ſet out in this chapter, and in
the former chapters of this book: So that he
had ſundry &amp; ſingular teſtimonies of Gods
loue towards him. But ſome will ſay, why
did God loue him? or how could hee loue
him? and why did he beſtow ſo many gifts
vpō him? to his own ruine &amp; deſtruction (as
it may ſeem). For into what horrible &amp; mō
               ſtrous
ſinnes did he fall, as we may ſee in the
next chap: of this book, thus it is written of
him. King Salomon loued many outlādiſh womē,
both the daughter of Pharaoh, &amp; the women
of Moab, Ammon. Edom, Sydon, &amp; Heath:
Of the nations wherof the Lord had ſaid to
the children of Iſrael, Goe not you in to them,
nor let them come to you: To them (I ſay) did
Salomon ioyne in loue: And he had ſeuē hundreth
wiues, that were Princeſſes, &amp; three

hūdreth concubines: And his wiues turned
away his hart, after other Gods: ſo that his
hart was not perfect with the Lord his God,
as was the hart of Dania his Father. And his
Idolatrie, in following diuers gods, is after
deſcribed; &amp; alſo the anger of God againſt
him, threatning to rent his kingdome, and
ſtirring vp diuers aduerſaries againſt him,
to vexe him a long time, one after another:
and rent his kingdome, and gaue away ten
Tribes from him, to 
                  
                     •
                  eroboam, to the great
trouble, diſcredit, and vexation of Salomon.
            
            Wee haue ſpoken much already of Salomons
great felicity, but now all is turned into
miſerie: his wiſedome into folli
                  •
               , his honor
into ſhame, the great ioy that many had
of him, is now no doubt turned into generall
ſorrow and lamentation.
            What a fearfull fall is this of ſuch a great
perſon? of ſuch a King, a Prophet, a Preacher;
and that in his olde age, euen then he
falleth into follie and vncleanneſſe: euen
then his heart was turned from the Lorde
after other Gods.
            The loue of out-landiſh women drewe
his heart from the loue of God: His ſinnes
are directly againſt the writtē law of God,
againſt his owne doctrine, &amp; he is moſt vnkinde
&amp; vnthankful to God, who had twiſe

appeared vnto him, and had beſtowed ſo
many priuiledges, &amp; excellent graces vpon
him. And therefore the Lorde is iuſtly angrie
with him, and grieueth him, and vexeth
him with diuers aduerſaries, all the daies of
his life. He troubled and vexed the Lord,
therefore the Lord vexeth him. Hee diuided
Gods worſhip, and therefore the Lord
diuided his kingdome.
            This fall of Salomon is moſt fearfull, horrible,
and lamentable; Nay, it is incredible,
that ſuch a man (hauing ſpent his younger
time in building Gods houſe, in writing
bookes, in diuine inſtructions and meditations),
ſhould in his latter dayes fall ſo
groſſely, into ſuch monſtrous wickedneſſe
Who would belieue this? or thinke it poſſible?
but that it is written and recorded
by the holy Ghoſt, the ſpirit of truth. The
remembrāce, the reading, hearing, or thinking
of ſuch a fowle fall, in ſuch a man, it
may trouble vs, and make our hearts to
quake and tremble.
            O Sathan, ſubtile ſerpent, cruell dragon,
mighty and roaring Lyon, the aduerſary of
mans ſaluation: great is they power, thy
ſubtilty, and boldneſſe, that couldeſt preuaile
ſo far with ſuch a man. But what wilt
not thou, or what canſt thou not doe, if the

Lord let thee looſe? who didſt ſeduce Adam
in Paradiſe, and waſt not afraide to
tempt our SAVIGVR CHRIST in the
wilderneſſe, though thou couldſt not preuaile
againſt him: but all thy deſire, endeuour,
&amp; labour is, to deſtroy the ſoules and
bodies of ſinfull mortall men: But the Lord
reproue thee (ô Sathan) and ſtay thy infatiable
rage and furie.
            O the corruption and ſinfulnes of mans
nature: what are wee the beſt of vs all, if
the Lord leaue vs to our ſelues? Into what
monſtrous and beaſtly ſinnes doe wee fall?
O Salomon, how art thou degenerated? how
haſt thou forgotten thy ſelfe? who hath bewitched
thee? In thy young time, all admired
thee, ſought to thee, commended and
magnified thee for thy wiſedome; now all
may admire and ſcoffe thy follie and madnes.
The enemies of God, the Heathen may
ſay, Is this the great wiſe man, whome all
the world admired? Thou haſt bene a ioy
to all good men, they reioyced at thy proſperitie,
wiſedome, and pietie: Now they
figh, they are greeued &amp; wounded at their
heart, for thy follie &amp; wickednes. Haſt thou
forgotten thine education?2. Prou. 4. 4. or the good
counſell of thy parents? who taught thee,
and ſaid vnto thee, Let thy heart hold faſt

my words, keepe my commaundements,
and thou ſhalt liue. Thy louing Father
gaue thee this counſell vpon his death bed,
ſaying:1. King. 2. 2. 3. I goe the way, of all the earth, bee
ſtrong therefore, and ſhew thy ſelfe a man,
and take heede to the charge of the Lord
thy God, to walke in his wayes, and keepe
his ſtatutes, and his commaundements, and
his iudgements, and his teſtimonies, as it
is written in the law of Moſes, that thou
mayſt proſper in all that thou doeſt, and in
euery thing whereunto thou turneſt thee.
And haſt thou forgotten thoſe ſweete
words of thy father? Thou Salomon (my
ſonne) know thou the God of thy father,1. Chron. 28. 9.
and ſerue him with a perfect heart, &amp; with
a willing minde: For the Lord ſearcheth all
hearts, and vnderſtandeth all the imaginations
of thoughts. If thou ſeeke him, he
will be found of thee: But if thou forſake
him,Pro. 31. 12. he will caſt thee off for euer. And haſt
thou forgotten the ſweet and louing counſell
of thy mother? the prophecie which
ſhe taught thee, ſpoken to thee with a tender
&amp; motherly affection: What my ſonne?
what the ſonne of my wombe? and what,
O ſon of my deſires? giue not thy ſtrength
to women, nor thy wayes, which is to deſtroy
Kings: And there ſhee deſcribeth a

wife forthee. Not many wiues, but one, not
a ſtranger or Idolater, but a woman fearing
God. O Salomon, haſt thou forgotten the
firſt inſtitution of mariage? wherein God
made for one Adam,
               Gen. 2. one 
                  〈◊〉
               ; for one man,
one woman: and they two (ſaith he) ſhall
be one fleſh.Dent. 17. 17. And haſt thou forgotten the
expreſſe law of God? forbidding the King
to take him many wiues, leaſt his heart
turne away from God.Deut. 7. 1. 2. 3. 4 And againe, forbidding
all compacts and mariages with
Idolaters, leaſt they cauſe his people to
turne away from him, and ſerue other gods;
and ſo the wrath of the Lord waxe hotte againſt
them, and deſtroy them ſuddenly.
Of the truth of theſe words thou haſt wofull
experience in thy ſelfe. And haſt thou
forgotten the words of God ſpoken to thy
ſelfe? promiſing to bleſſe thee, if thou keep
his ſtatues and iudgements? otherwiſe,
if thou and thy children turne away from
me, and will not keepe my commaundements
and my ſtatutes, which I haue ſet
before you; but goe and ſerue other gods,
and worſhippe them: then will I cut
off Iſrael from the land, which I haue
giuen them, and the houſe which I haue
hallowed for my Name,1. King. 9. 4. 6. 7. will I caſt out of
my ſight: and Iſrael ſhall bee a prouerbe,

and a common talke, among all people: euen
this high houſe, ſhall be ſo: Euery one
that paſſeth by it ſhalbe aſtonyed, and ſhall
hiſſe, and they ſhall ſay, Why hath the Lord
done this vnto this land, and to this houſe?
and they ſhall anſwere: Becauſe they forſooke
the Lord their God; which brought
their Fathers out of the land of Ae
                     ••
                  pt, and
haue taken holde vppon other Gods, and
haue worſhipped them, and ſerued them:
Therefore hath the Lorde brought vppon
them all this euill.
            And (Oh Salomon) haſt thou forgotten
thine owne counſell and doctrine, inſpired
by the holy Ghoſt, and deliuered to the inſtruction
of others: And may it not be ſaid
to thee;Rom. 2. 17. 18. &amp;c. Behold, thou art called a lewe, and
reſteſt in the law, and glorieſt in God, and
knoweſt his will, and alloweſt the things
that are excellent, in that thou art inſtructed
by the Law, and perſwadeſt thy ſelfe,
that thou art a guide of the blinde, a light
of them that are in darknes, an inſtructer of
them which lacke diſcretion, a teacher of
the vnlearned, which haſt the forme of
knowledge and Truth in the lawe; Thou
therefore which teacheſt another, teacheſt
not thou thy ſelfe? Thou that preacheſt a
man ſhould not ſteale, Doeſt thou ſteale?

Thou that ſayeſt, a man ſhould not commit
adulterie, Doeſt thou commit adultrie?
Thou that abhorreſt Idolls, cōmitteſt thou
Sacriledge? Thou that glorieſt in the Law,
through the breaking of the Law diſhonoreſt
thou God? For the name of God is blaſphemed
among the Gentiles, through you,
as it is written.Prou. 5. 34. 5 8. 9. &amp;c. Conſider then, how this thy
bad example and filthy fall, diſagreeth with
thy former doctrine and counſell; Are not
theſe thine owne words? That the lips of
a ſtrange woman drop as an honie combe,
and her mouth is more ſofte then oyle: but
the ende of her is more bitter then worme-wood,
and ſharpe as a two-edged ſworde.
Her feete go downe to death,Prou. 6. 23. 24. &amp;c. and her ſteps
take holde on Hell: Keepe thy way farre
from her, and come not neere the doore of
her houſe; leaſt thou giue they honors to others,
and thy yeares to the cruell.
            And is not this thine owne ſweete counſell?
that the commandement is a Lanthorne,
and Inſtruction, and Light, and
Corrections, for inſtructions, and the way
of life, to keepe thee from the wicked woman,
and from the flattery of the tongue
of a ſtrange woman: deſire not her beautie
in thy heart, neither let her not take
thee with her Eye-liddes: For becauſe of

the whoriſh woman, a man is brought to
a morſell of bread; and a woman will hunt
for the precious life of a man. And doe
                  ••
               
thou not deſcribe, and cunningly lay out,
the folly of thoſe young men, that ſuffer
themſelues to bee abuſed, and ſeduced by
the baites, temptations, and allurements of
harlots? ſaying, that ſuch are as Oxen going
to the ſlaughter, and as a foole to the
ſtockes of correction; till a dart ſtrike
thorow their liuer. As a bird haſteth to the
ſnare, not knowing that hee is in danger:
ſaying,Pro. 7. 6. 22. 26. that the harlot hath cauſed many to
fall downe wounded, and the ſtrong men
are ſlayne by her. Her houſe is the way to
the graue, which goeth down to the chambers
of death. And are not theſe thy ſayings?
Pro. 25. 15. The mouth of a ſtrange woman is a
deepe pit, hee with whom the Lord is angry
ſhall fall therein. And againe, A who
                  •

is a deepe ditch, and a ſtrange woman is an
narrow pit. Alſo, ſhe lyeth in waite as for
a prey, and ſhe encreaſeth the tranſgreſſers
amongſt men. O Salomon, haſt thou forgotten
the law of nature? the written law
of God, the ſweete counſell of thy father
and mother, and the good counſell which
thou haſt long ſince giuen to others? Hath
ſenſuallity, proſperity, pleaſures, and luſts,

wholy poſſeſſed thee, blinded thee, and
taken away they heart? O pittifull, lamentable,
wofull, and fearefull fall! The
greatneſſe and hainouſneſſe of this ſinfull
fall, haue made ſome learned Fathers to
doubt of the ſaluation of Salomon: And
ſome to put him in the number of the reprobate
and damned: their reaſons are
theſe: Firſt, becauſe his father Dauid, being
a Prophet, ſaith of him in the place
before alledged: That if he forſooke the
Lord, hee would caſt him off for euer.
Tis true, if Salomon did finally forſake
him without repentance. Againe, they
ſay that the Scripture maketh mention of
his grieuous fall, as we haue heard before,
out of the next Chapter following; but
there is no mention of his repentance,
though his death bee there named. Neither
is it found, that hee tooke away the
Idols, which hee had erected. But it may
be, his repentance was late, and hee could
not take them away ſuddenly. Againe, he
is not numbred by the Apoſtle in the Catalogue
of the faithfull.Heb. 11. Though Samuel
and Dauid his father, and diuers others
bee there named: yet all the faithfull of
the Old Teſtament are not there numbred,
nor all holy Kings: for there is no mention
there of Iehoſephat and Heſechias.

Againe, ſome doe alleage, that ſentence of
God out of the Prophet, ſaying, I will
ſpeake ſuddēly againſt a nation, or againſt
a kingdome; to plucke it vp, and to roote
it out, and to deſtroy it; but if this nation
(againſt whom I haue pronounced) turne
from their wickednes, I will repent of the
plague, which I thought to bring vpon
them: and thus they gather from this place,
that becauſe God plagued Salomon by
ſundrie aduerſaries to his death, and neuer
tooke away this plague; that therefore Salomon
repented not, but died in his ſinnes.
But that ſentence of Ieremie is not rightly
applied, becauſe God doth oftentimes
correct penitent ſinners with temporall
puniſhments; and thus he did to Dauid after
his repentance: He forgaue him his
ſinnes, but yet he did correct him diuers
wa
                  •
               es, by temporall corrections. It is true
indeed, that all penitent ſinners are ſure,
to be freed from eternall and euerlaſting
puniſhmēts. And it may rather be thought
that God doth threaten and afflict Salomon,
to drawe him thereby to repentance;
and no doubt, if he had any ſparke of grace,
or diuine wiſedome left in him, ſuch afflictions
and corrections, one after an other,
would drawe him to true humiliation and

repentance. The Fathers, ſome of them
ſpeake very hardly and heauily of this fall
of Salomon. Dauid the ſonne of the celeſtiall
Ieruſalem ſaith one, raigned in the
earth, and was much commended in the
ſcripture. His pietie and true humilitie
ſo conquered his affections, that he was
one of them, of whom we might ſay with
him;Aug: anit: dei. lib: 17. Bleſſed are thoſe, whoſe iniquitie is
forgiuen, and whoſe ſinnes are couered.
After him his ſonne Salomon raigned in
all his kingdome,Chap: 20. beginning to raigne in
his fathers time, he began well, but ended
badly: proſperitie (the mouth of wiſedom)
did him more hurt, then his famous and
memorable wiſedome profited him.Chriſ: 2. An
other ſaith, that Salomon receiued a deadly
wound,Cor: Ho
                     ••
                  : 23. that his father fell, but after he
roſe againe, that he warred and thence
receiued a crowne, but ſo did not his ſonne
Salomon. And an other;Bern: de paſſ: dom: Chap. 14. Who was wiſer
then Salomon? but departing from the
commandements of God, and ioyning
himſelfe to heatheniſh women, he built
Temples to their Gods, yea to diuels; being
ſo much the more deiected, and deceiued
in follie, as before he was lifted vp in
wiſedome. An other compareth Salomon
with Chriſt, ſaying, that he did much excell

him, becauſe Chriſt had wiſedome by
nature, but Salomon did aske it by prayer,
and in the end poſſeſſed it not. Theſe
things are heauie, to ſpeake, and thinke
of, and they are ſome blot and blemiſh to
Salomon: but yet it is hard and vncertaine
to determine of the damnation of any; and
as the former reaſons, may be anſwered,
ſo, as I take it, there be ſtronger arguments
to proue the repentance and ſaluation of
Salomon: And firſt, call to minde thoſe
great promiſes, which God maketh to Dauid,
touching this his ſonne Salomon, ſaying
of him, I will be his father, and he ſhall
be my ſonne;2. Sam: 7. 14. 15. and if he ſinne, I will chaſten
him with the rodde of men, and with the
plagues of the children of men: but my
mercy ſhall not depart away from him, as
I tooke it from Saul, whom I haue put away
before thee. A plaine teſtimonie of
Gods loue to Salomon, and of his election
to ſaluation. And howſoeuer ſome doe apply,
that mercy of God, to the mercy of
ſucceſſion in the kingdome; and that God
would not vtterly cut off his ſeed from
thence, as he did to Saul: yet that mercy
may be further extended, to the pardoning
of the ſinne of Salomon, and ſauing of his
ſoule. And if God be his father, and he his

ſonne, how can he finally fall and periſh?
Are any of the ſonnes and children of God
damned? Is God a father to the reprobate?
and are the reprobates his children? doth
he correct them gently in loue, as fathers
vſe to chaſten their children? or doth he
not rather puniſh them in his furie and
rage, in his iuſtice and ſeueritie? In an other
place: when Salomon was borne, Dauid
called his name Salomon, and it is ſaid
that the Lord loued him.2. Sam: 12. 24. 25. For the Lord had
ſent by Nathan the Prophet, therefore Dauid
called his name Iedidiſah, that is, beloued
of God. For that is the reaſon of the
name, becauſe the Lord loued him. That
is one of his titles: Beloued of God. And it
is ſaid twiſe (in that place) the Lord loued
him:Iohn: 13. and in this our text, this Queene ſaith
as much, that God loued him. Now thoſe,
whom God loueth, he loueth to the end.
And thoſe whom God loueth, how can
they finally and totally fall away? Though
they fall, they cannot fall away; though
they ſinne, they muſt needes riſe againe by
repentance, and ſo be ſaued. And I haue
neuer read in all the ſcripture, that God
doth profeſſe any ſuch loue to a reprobate.
God ſaith of Iacob,Rom: 9. 12. I haue loued him, becauſe
he was choſen; &amp; I haue hated Eſau,

becauſe he was reiected. Againe, we haue
heard alreadie that Salomon was a figure
and tipe of Chriſt Ieſus, the ſonne of God,
the Sauiour of the world. Againe, he was
alſo as we haue heard, inſpired by the holy
Ghoſt, and a writer of the holy ſcripture.
Some reprobates haue ſpoken the truth,
and haue preached and prophecied, as Balaam
and Iudas: but the Prophets and writers
of holy ſcripture are all elect and ſaued
(ſo far as we know.) Our Sauiour Chriſt
ſaith, that the wicked ſhall ſee Abraham,
Iſaacke, and Iacob, and all the Prophets in
the kingdome of God: and themſelues
thruſt out of doores. Now Salomon was a
preacher, a Prophet, a writer of ſcripture,
and therefore we doubt not but he hath
his part in the kingdome of heauen. Finally,
the booke of the Preacher, is called by
the Hebrewes, the repētance of Salomon:
and ſo it ſeemeth, by the firſt beginning
and entrance of it: where he cryeth out,
Vanitie of vanities, all is vanitie. They be
the words of one, that had taſted of all the
pleaſures in the world that could be deuiſed;
and yet at laſt being wearie of all, and
renouncing all, he repoſeth all true felicitie
of this life, in true religion and the feare
of God. This may ſerue to ſatisfie vs,

touching the repentance and ſaluation of
Salomon: And now becauſe we (vpon
ſome iuſt occaſion) haue made ſome digreſſion,
not impertinent, nor vnprofitable
(and becauſe this fall of Salomon is
abuſed by many) let vs (before we proceed
further) deliuer ſome good inſtructions,
and vſes, touching this his fall. Firſt
then conſider, how dangerous the proſperitie,
the great wealth, and honours of the
world are, and therefore let vs not (too
much) deſire them, nor ſet our hearts, or
delights (too much) vpon them. For
(thorough the corruption of our nature)
many wax proud, contemning God and
men, iniurious to themſelues and others,
being wanton, luxurious and Laſciuious.
And therefore the Lord ſaith to his people
Iſrael:Deut: 8. 10. 11. 12. &amp;c. When thou haſt eaten, and filled thy
ſelfe, thou ſhalt bleſſe the Lord thy God,
for the land which he hath giuen thee. Beware
that thou forget not the Lord thy
God, not keeping his commaundements
and his lawes, and his ordinances which I
commaund thee this day; leaſt when thou
haſt eaten, and filled thy ſelfe, and haſt
built goodly houſes, and dwelt therein,
and thy beaſts and thy ſheepe are increaſed,
and thy ſiluer and thy gold is multiplied,

and all that thou haſt is increaſed;
then thine heart be lifted vp, and thou forget
the Lord thy God, which brought
thee out of the land of Aegypt, and out of
the houſe of bondage.Deut: 32. 15. And in an other
place, he complaineth of that people, ſaying;
He that ſhould haue beene vpright,
(when he waxed fatte) ſpurned with his
heele. Thou art fatte, thou art groſſe, thou
art loaden with fatnes; therefore he forſooke
God that made him, and regarded
not the ſtrong God of his ſaluation. How
ſhould I ſpare thee? (ſaith the Lord) thy
children haue forſaken me, and ſworne by
them which are no Gods; though I fed
them to the full,Ier. 5. 7. 8. yet they committed adulterie,
&amp; aſſembled themſelues by companies
in the harlots houſes; They roſe vp in
the morning like fed horſes; for euery man
neighed after his neighbours wife. Again,
I did knowe them in the wildernes,Hoſe: 13. 5. 6. in the
land of drought, as in their paſtures, ſo
were they filled; they were filled, and their
heart was exalted; Therefore haue they
forgotten me. Oh that the great men of
the world, the Potentates, Princes, States,
Nobles, and all the wealthy of the earth,
would remēber this, who (by their power
and wealth) take libertie to ſinne, and

to liue licentiouſly without controulement,
and are infatuated by worldly
cares, and pleaſures, whereas the end of
all outward bleſſings is to make vs more
thankfull,Pſ: 105. 44. 45. and more holy: God gaue his
people the lands of the heathen, and they
tooke the labours of the people in poſſeſſion;
the end of this and of all their former
bleſſings is, that they might keepe his
ſtatutes, and obſerue his lawes. And ſeeing
that great proſperitie is ſo dangerous;
let vs pray with the wiſe man, Giue me
not pouertie,Pro: 30. 8. 9. nor riches: feed me with food
conuenient for me, leaſt I be full, and denie
thee: and ſay, who is the Lord? or leaſt
I be poore, and ſteale, and take the name
of my God in vaine. Great abundance is
dangerous, and extreame pouertie is dangerous;
the competent eſtate is the beſt,
and let vs be content with it, and let euery
one harken to that counſell of the Lord,
ſaying;Ier: 9. 23. 24. Let not the wiſe man glory in his
wiſedome, nor the ſtrong man glory in
his ſtrength, neither the rich man in his
riches: but let him that glorieth, glory in
this, that he vnderſtandeth and knoweth
me.
            Againe, by this example we ſee, that
great and good Princes are ſubiect

to falling; ſome haue good beginnings,
and continue long, and yet in the end they
decline and fall away. Nero in the firſt fiue
yeares of his raigne, was of ſuch liberatie,
clemencie and gentlenes, that he paſſed
all Princes that were before him, he
either for gaue or elſe diminiſhed all taxes
and payments. He was ſo gentle and
fauourable to all degrees, that he would
admit them to come to ſalute him, and alſo
did ſalute them himſelfe by name: He
made many good lawes: but although he
did theſe and ſuch like things, with great
honour at the beginning of his raigne:
yet (at the laſt) forgetting the Imperiall
dignitie, he opened his wantonnes, his
fleſhly pleaſures, his riot, his Auarice,
his crueltie: Oftentimes he attempted to
kill his owne mother Agrippina: She eſcaped
often, at laſt the Centurion (comming
towards her with a naked ſword
in his hand) ſlew her; ſhe putting forth
her belly, cried out, That hee would
ſtrike that part firſt, for this bellie (ſaith
ſhe) is to be pierced through with Iron,
which brought forth ſuch a monſter.
Then the (Centurion thruſt his ſword
into her bellie, and ſo ſlew her with many
woundes; after this horrible murther

was done, Nero being both without feare
and ſhame, beheld the Carkaſſe of his mother
being ſlaine. He killed Seneca his
maiſter, and Burrus one of his gouernours.
What will you more? he ceaſed not to
kill whom he pleaſed, and that for what
cauſe ſoeuer he pleaſed. Tyberius (who
ſucceeded Auguſtus) raiſed vp of himſelfe,
(at the beginning of his raigne) no ſmall
hope of goodnes: but afterwards, proued
a very Tyrant, and moſt filthy man. Alexander
the great, at the firſt ruled iuſtly
and valiantly: but after he was ſo effeminated
with the daintie delicates of
Paſia, that he became proud, leacherous,
a drunkard, a murtherer: by the which
vices he both ſhortned his owne daies,
and made himſelfe to be deteſted of
his owne Macedonians. Conſtantine the
great, vnhappily ended his empire, He
purſued the good Biſhop Athanaſius: He
brought home the Heritike Arrius, and
became an Apoſtata. Mauritius of a long
time gouerned happily, but afterwards
he became ſo cruell, ſo couetous, ſo violent;
that he was hated of his owne ſubiects,
and ſlaine by Phocas. There be
many ſuch examples; but there is one
before our eies, the wiſeſt Prince that

euer was, a long time gouerning religiouſly
and vertuouſly: but in his old
daies, falling in moſt groſſe and beaſtly
manner. Of whom it may be ſaid, as it
was ſaid of Origen. Vbi bene nemo melius,
vbi male nemo peius, where he did well,
none did better: where he did euill, none
did worſe: I meane in reſpect of his vnbrideled
and filthy luſt, ſeeing therefore,
that the beſt and the wiſeſt Princes,
are ſubiect to the temptations of Sathan,
to the allurements of the world,
fleſh and ſinne, and may decline and
fall away from good beginnings and
proceedings; let all good Chriſtians and
good ſubiects, pray hartily and continually
to God; not onely to make their
Princes good, but alſo to hold, keepe,
continue, and encreaſe them in goodnes.
And ſeeing that all of vs, are ſubiect to
the like temptations, let vs all be carefull,
not onely to begin well, but alſo
to holde on and continue to the end:
remembring that fearefull ſentence of
God, ſaying: If the righteous turne away
from his righteouſnes, and committeth
iniquitie, and doe according to all
the abhominations, that the wicked man
doth; ſhall hee liue? all his righteouſnes

which hee hath done, ſhall not be
mentioned,Ezek: 18. 24. but in his tranſgreſſion which
hee hath committed, and in the ſinne
that hee hath ſinned, in them ſhall he
die. And let vs neuer forget that excellent
counſell of Salomons.Pro: 4. 18. The way
of the righteous ſhineth as the light; that
ſhineth more and more, vntill the perfect
day. His meaning is, that as the light
in the morning (when it once appeareth)
encreaſeth more and more, till it be perfect
day:Pro: 16. 31. ſo good men, they growe daily,
in knowledge, grace, and goodnes. Againe
(he ſaith) age is a crowne of glory,
if it be found in the way of righteouſnes.
            Happie is that young man, that hath
liued well; but more happie is that old
man that hat liued well.
            It is not ſufficient that we haue bene
good, except we continue ſo ſtill: the
righteous (ſaith Dauid) ſhall flouriſh
like a palme tree, and ſhall growe like
a Cedar in Libanon. Such as be planted
in the houſe of the Lord, ſhall flouriſh
in the Courts of our God, they ſhall
bring forth fruit in their age.
            Young men muſt remember their
Creator in their youth, the powers of

their body and minde is then fitteſt for
the ſeruice of God: They are ſubiect to
death, as well as others: they muſt giue
their beſt time, and firſt fruites of their
age to God; They cannot tell how ſoone
they may die, and they muſt come to
iudgement as well as others, and the
pietie of their young age will be a comfort
and a credit to them in their old age;
and therefore let them be carefull of religion,
and holy conuerſation in their
tender yeares▪ and let old men and women
take heed of vices, and doe nothing,
that is vnſeemely to their age: And (in
very deed) the beautie and ornament of
the elder ſort is the true knowledge of
God, and heauenly wiſedome, and an
vnblamable life: they may ſet, that no
age is free from danger; If the diuell cannot
deceiue vs in our youth, he will not
leaue vs, but will deceiue vs in our age (if
he can) ſome in this age, are guiltie of
Salomons ſinnes, both of vncleannes and
Idolatrie. Some are ignorant, ſome prophane,
ſome vniuſt, ſome ouercome with
lying, ſome with drunkennes, and the
moſt in their olde age, are ſubiect to
impatience, and couetouſnes, and are
vnwilling to die, and leaue this ſinfull

world: but let them of all other be examples
of wiſedome &amp; vertue, let them flie
from the luſts of youth, &amp; follow after righteouſnes,
faith, loue &amp; peace, with thē that
call on the Lord with a pure heart.Tit. 2 3. Let the
elder men be ſober, honeſt, diſcreet, ſound
in the faith, in loue, and in patience: the
elder women likewiſe, that they bee of
ſnch behauiour as becommeth holines, not
falſe accuſers, not giuen to much wine, but
teachers of honeſt things. Oh, how pleaſant
a thing is it, when gray-headed men
miniſter iudgement, and when the elders
can giue good counſell? Oh how comely
a thing is wiſedome to aged men? and vnderſtanding
and prudence to men of honour?
The crowne of olde men is to haue
much experience, and the feare of God is
their glory. They are to giue themſelues
to continuall prayer and deuotion, to reading
and hearing of the word, to the meditation
of the ſhortnes of their life, and of
the happineſſe and eternity of the life to
come. Worthy is the example of Barzillai
the Giliadite: who went to conduct King
Dauid ouer Iorden, and King Dauid ſayd
vnto him, Come ouer with me, and I will
feede thee with me in Ieruſalem: I am this
day foure ſcore yeere olde (ſayth hee) and

can I diſcerne betweene good or euill
hath thy ſeruant any taſte in that I eate?2. Sam. 19. 31. 35. 37. or
that I drink? can I heare any more the ſinging
voyce of men or women? wherefore
then ſhould thy ſeruant be any more a burthen?
thy ſeruant will goe a little way ouer
with thee, I pray thee let thy ſeruant
turne backe againe, that I may die in my
owne City, and bee buried in the graue of
my father and of my mother. His meaning
is, that the pleaſures of the Courte
was not fit for him, though he was a man of
great account, &amp; ſubſtance, yet being old,
his minde was of death, of his graue and
buriall. Happy is he that hath ſo liued both
in young, and olde age: that hee can ſay
(with good Ambroſe ſeeing his friendes
weeping about him at his death) I haue not
ſo liued, that I am aſhamed to liue ſtill amongſt
you, neither am I afrayde to die,
becauſe we haue a gracious &amp; good Lord.
Now let young &amp; old, and all ſorts of men
and women, eſpecially Princes, and great
perſons: let all (I ſay) take heede of theſe
two vices where with Solomon is touched,
namely, vnbridled luſt &amp; Idolatrie. God
is a holy and pure ſpirit, hee hath ordeyned
mariage as a bridle and remedie againſt
vnclearle and vnlawfull luſt, and wee are

to liue chaſtelie in virginitie, and ſingle
life, which is the firſt degree of chaſtitie:
or elſe to liue in mariage (the ordinance
of GOD) which is the ſecond degree
of chaſtitie. But the Deuill, he is a foule,
filthie, and vncleane ſpirit, an enemie to
mariage, to chaſtitie, and honeſtie: and
therefore, from the beginning hee hath
ſought to defile, and pollute, that holy
inſtitution of GOD, by multitude of
wiues, by fornication, whoredome, adulterie,
and other wandering, wanton, and
vagabonde luſtes. Theſe are againſt the
law of nature, againſt the law of God
written, againſt ciuill honeſtie, and charitie.
Theſe deſtroie and conſume the
goods, the good name, the body and
ſoule. And (as Bertheba ſayeth to her
ſonne Salomon) Such vncleaneſſe is the
deſtruction of Kings: ſo it is the deſtruction
of many others, men and women, of
many great houſes, townes, countries,
and kingdomes. Therefore (ſayth Iob)
If my heart haue beene deceiued by a woman,
or if I haue laide waite at the doore
of my neighbour: let my wife g
                  •
               inde to another
man, and let other men bow downe
vpon her.Iob. 31. 9. 10. 11. 12. For this is a wickednes and iniquitie
to bee condemned; yea this is a fire

that ſhall deuoure to deſtruction, whi
                  •
               
ſhall roote out all mine increaſe.Hoſe. 4. 11. And it is
moſt true (which the Prophet ſaith) that
whoredome and wine take away the heart.
And indeede, ſuch ſinfull pleaſures, they
take away witte, and vnderſtanding, grace,
and religion: they take away credit, riches,
and health; yea the comfort of ſoule and
body. It is a great curſe, and heauy iudgement
of God, to be giuen ouer to ſuch vile
and filthy luſts. And this Salomon confeſſeth,
vpon wofull experience, ſaying, I
haue compaſſed about,Eccle. 7. 27. 28. 29. 30. both I &amp; my heart
to know and to enquire &amp; to ſearch wiſedome
and reaſon, and to know the wickednes
of folly, and the fooliſhnes of madneſſe:
and I finde more bitter then death,
the woman whoſe heart is as nets and
ſnares, and her hands as bands: hee that is
good before God, ſhall be deliuered from
her, but the ſinner ſhall bee taken by her.
Behold (ſayth the Preacher) this haued
founde, ſeeking one by one to finde the
count: and yet my ſoule ſeeketh, but I find
it not: I haue found one man of a thouſand;
but a woman among them all, haue I not
found. His meaning is not to diſgrace good
women, but that women are eaſily drawne
to wickednes, and being wicked, they exceed

men in wickednes: and are of great
power to draw &amp; allure others to the ſame.
And that fewer women are good then men;
finally; he ſpeaketh vpon his owne experience,
&amp; tryall, that he for his part amongſt
ſo many found none at all good; and this is
ſome teſtimony of his repentance: Theſe
words being ſpoken, and that booke being
written (as ſome thinke, &amp; as it is probable)
after his grieuous fall: But wee
ſee by that place, that it is a token of Gods
anger, to bee giuen ouer to ſuch vncleanneſſe,
and it is a iuſt iudgement vpon our
prophaneſſe, neglect, &amp; contempt of Gods
ſeruice: and therefore the Apoſtle ſayth,
That becauſe men regarded not to know
God,Rom. 1. 24. 28. hee deliuereth them vp into a reprobate
minde, to doe thoſe things, which are
not conuenient: he gaue them vp to their
hearts luſts, and to vile affections. Becauſe
men are careleſſe in religion, &amp; of the true
honour of God: therefore the Lord giueth
them ouer, to ſuch filthy and odious ſinnes,
to their vtter diſhonour and ſhame in life,
and death, and after death: ſo that the memoriall
of ſuch (though they haue beene of
neuer ſo high account in the world) is but
vile, rotten, and curſed. Therefore let vs
hearken to that bleſſed Exhortation of the

Apoſtle,1. Pet. 2. 11. ſaying: Dearely beloued, I beſeech
you as ſtrangers and pilgrimes, abſtayne
from fleſhly luſtes, which fight againſt
the ſoule. And let vs not forget thoſe
words of another Apoſtle:1. Cor. 6. 15. 16. 17 18. &amp;c. Know yee not
(ſaith hee) that your bodies are the members
of Chriſt? ſhall we then take the members
of Chriſt, &amp; make them the members
of an harlot? God forbid. Doe yee not
know, that hee which coupleth himſelfe
with an harlot is one body: for two (ſaith
he) ſhalbe one fleſh; but he which is ioyned
to the Lord is one ſpirit. Fly fornication: euery
ſin that a man doth, is without the bodie:
but he that cōmitteth fornication, ſinneth
againſt his owne body. Know yee not
that your body is the temple of the holy
Ghoſt which is in you, whom yee haue of
God? and ye are not your owne, for ye are
bought with a price. Therfore glorifie God
in your body and in your ſpirit; for they are
Gods. Another ſin which we are to auoide,
and which was Salomons ſinne, is Idolatry.
It is ſaide (as we haue heard) that he matched
with Idolatrous women: that for the
loue of them, he built high places, hee
wrought wickedneſſe in the ſight of the
Lord, &amp; continued not to follow the Lord
as did Dauid his father: &amp; that his hart was

not perfect with the Lord his God. The beginning
of his ſinne was, that hee matched
with Idolatrous womē, contrary to the expreſſe
law of God: And therefore it was ſin
ſo to match. We are to auoide all vnneceſſarie
ſociety, &amp; familiarity with the wicked:
&amp; therfore Iehoſephet is reproued,2. Chro. 19. 2. becauſe
he helped the wicked, &amp; loued them that
hated the Lord: for he ioyned in the affinitie
with Ahab, but the wrath of the Lord
came vpon him for it.Pro. 
                     •
                  9. 27. Salomon ſaith, The
wicked man is an abhomination to the iuſt;
&amp; he that is vpright in his way, is an abhomination
to the wicked. There can be no
ſound nor true friendſhip betwixt thoſe
that are diuers &amp; contrary in religiō &amp; maners.
2. Cor. 6. 14 15. 16. Therfore, ſaith the Apoſtle, be not vnequally
yoked with Infidels, for what fellowſhip
hath righteouſnes with vnrighteouſnes?
&amp; what cōmunion hath light with
darknes? what concord hath Chriſt with
Belial? what part hath the beleeuer with
the Infidell? and what agreement hath the
temple of God with Idols? The Lord complained
thus of his people, ſaying, Iuda
hath tranſgreſſed, &amp; abhomination is committed
in Iſrael, and in Ieruſalem, for Iuda
hath defiled the holines of the Lord, which
he loued, &amp; hath maried the daughter of a
ſtrange god. The LORD will cut off the

man that doth this,Mal. 2. 11. 12. both the maiſter &amp; the
ſeruant, out of the Tabernacle of Iacob
and him that offereth an offering to the
Lord of Hoaſts. Such curſed and croſſe
matches, was the cauſe that God deſtroyed
the firſt world with the generall flood: And
ſuch matches (at this day) are the cauſes of
prophaneneſſe, Athiſme, Popery, and much
wickedneſſe. For what comfort or bleſſing
can they looke for, which haue no reſpect
to God in marying? But onely regard
pleaſures, and riches. The example of
Salomon is fearefull, that ſo great &amp; wiſe a
man, of extraordinary gifts and graces, is
allured and drawne to Idolatry, being ouercome
with the loue of heatheniſh women:
And yet (it may be, and it is likely)
that Salomon himſelfe did not worſhippe
thoſe Idols, or thinke them to be gods, or
that there were any diuine power in them:
neither did he bring them into the Temple,
nor commaund any to worſhip them;
but this was his fault, that hee did not ſuppreſſe
the worſhipping of them, but graunted
and ſuffered ſuch Idolatry, for the pleaſure
of his women: So that he fell, as Adam
fell; who did eate of the forbidden tree,
not becauſe that he thought thereby to be
like vnto GOD, or wiſer then hee was

made: but leaſt he ſhould offend his wiſe,
ſo that hee preferred the loue and good
will of a woman before the word of his
God. So Aaron knewe well enough, that
there was no Godhead nor diuine power
in the golden Calfe; yet fearing leaſt the
people ſhould ſtone him, he yeelded to
their furie, he made an Idoll, and promulgated
the feaſt of it. In like manner, Salomon
knowing Idols to be nothing, yet being
ouercome with the flattring inticements
of wicked women, he graunted to
them diuers kindes of Idolatrie. It is dangerous
for any Prince, to ſuffer and tollerate
any Idolatrous worſhip, for the loue
or fauour of any, be they neuer ſo neere or
deare vnto them. Nay, we muſt all learne
generally, not to harken to the voyce of
our deareſt friend, though it be our owne
lawfull wiues, if they goe about to drawe
vs to any kind of ſinne whatſoeuer. This
was the cauſe of Adams fall (as we heard
euen now) This was the cauſe of that ruine
of Ahab, and his houſe: becauſe he harkned
to the voyce of his wife Ieſabell, and
being perſwaded by her, moſt vniuſtly
tooke away Naboths vineyard, and alſo
moſt cruelly tooke his life away from him.
No naturall affections ſhould cauſe vs

to ſinne againſt God, or offend his diuine
Maieſtie; our loue to him ſhould bee greater
then to any mortall creature whatſoeuer.
The Heathen could ſay, Amicus Plato,
amicus Socrates, ſed maior amica veritas:
Plato is my friend, Socrates my friend, but
truth is a greater friend. So may wee ſay,
Our fathers, our mothers, our brothers
and ſiſters, our wiues &amp; children, are neere
and deare friends vnto vs: but yet Chriſt
is our greateſt and beſt friend; he hath done
and can do moſt for vs: And therefore nothing
ſhould draw vs from his loue. And
touching Idolatrie, it is moſt odious and
abhominable in the eyes of God. It is a ſpirituall
whoring from God. A denying and
forſaking of his Maieſtie; it hath beene the
ruine of many Nations and Kingdomes.
And therefore in no caſe to bee ſuffered
nor tollerated for the loue of any.Deut. 7. 25. Therefore
the Lord ſaith to his people; The grauen
Images of their gods, yee ſhall burne
with fire, and couet not the ſiluer and gold
that is on them, nor take it vnto thee, leaſt
thou be ſnared therewith: For it is an abhomination
before the Lord thy God.
Bring not abhomination into thy houſe,
leaſt thou bee accurſed like it: But vtterly
abhorre it, and count it moſt abhominable.

And in another place, we are forbidden to
hearken to the Prophet that doth perſwade
vs to goe after other gods, and that ſuch a
one being conuicted and condemned by
the Iudge,Deut. 13. 1. 2. 3. 6. 7. 8. is to die the death. Nay, though
it bee our ſonne, or daughter, or wife, or
brother, wee muſt not conſent to him, nor
pittie him, nor ſhew him mercy: but thou
ſhalt kill him (ſayeth the Lord) thy hand
ſhall bee firſt vpon him to put him to death;
and then the hands of all the people. And
this is the direct law of God: Hee that offereth
to any gods ſaue the Lord onely
ſhall bee ſlayne. There muſt bee then no
ſufferance at all of any kinde of Idolatrie.
This was Salomons ſinne, and therefore
it is ſayde that his heart was not perfect
with God, as the heart of his father Dauid
was: For howſoeuer hee ſinned in adulterie,
and murther, and in numbering the
people: yet he repented preſently, and neuer
did the like againe; and he had alwaies
this ſinceritie and perfection of heart, that
he neuer defiled himſelfe with Idolatrie;
neither did hee ſuffer the true worſhippe
of GOD to bee corrupted in his
Kingdome; but kept it ſincere, pure,
and ſound: Hee alwayes hated and
deteſted all falſe worſhippe, his ſoule

hated Idols,2. Sam. 5. as lame and blind guides;
therefore hee taketh them away at the
beginning of his raigne.1. Chron. 14 15. And hee cauſed
the gods of the Philiſtims to bee burnt
with fire.Pſal. 16. The ſorrowes (ſaith he) of them
that offer to another god ſhall be multiplied,
their offerings of blood will I not offer,
neither make mention of their names with
my lips. It hath beene a blot and blemiſh
vpon many good Kings, becauſe they ſuffered
the high places to remayne, and it is
the chiefe commendation of good Ioſiah:2. Chron. 
                     •
                  4. 33.
that he tooke away all the abhominations,
out of all the countries that perteyned to
the children of Iſrael; and compelled all
that were found in Iſrael, and compelled all
that were found in Iſrael, to ſerue the Lord
their God. This bleſſed King, a worthie
preſident of full and perfect reformation,
he tooke away not onely groſſe Idolatrie,
but all Reliques and remnants, all occaſions,
prouocations, appearances &amp; ſhewes
of Idolatrie. One thing more, very neceſſarie
and pertinent, wee are to learne
by Salomons fall: namely, Not to be offended
though we doe ſee Chriſtian Princes,
learned Preachers, and great profeſſors,
men of gifts aboue others, to be
ſeduced and drawne into great and groſſe
ſinnes: wee are indeede to be grieued,

and much to lament, when wee ſee or
heare ſuch things: but yet wee muſt not
bee diſcouraged in our profeſſion, and in
the trueth of religion. Men of greateſt
gifts, haue beene ſubiect to great ſinnes:
As Adam Noah, Lot, Abraham, Moſes,
Aaron, Dauid, Sampſon, and Salomon.
Sathan doth moſt enuie ſuch, hee
ſtandeth at the right hand of Iehoſua: Hee
will winnow and ſifte (to the very branne)
the Apoſtles of CHRIST, as hee himſelfe
warneth them. Indeede the bad liues of
Preachers and profeſſors, are ſcandalous
and offenſiue; and hinder many in the way
of ſaluation; and maketh the worde and
profeſſion ill ſpoken of by many; yea loathed
and reiected: as the ſonnes of Elie
by their wickedneſſe made the offering of
the Lord to be abhorred.Ambr. off. lib. 2. In ſeeking and
receiuing counſell (ſaith one) the honeſtie
of life, and the prerogatiue of vertue doth
much preuaile. Who will ſeeke for a fountaine
in a dunghill? who will drinke of
filthie water? for where there is luxurie,
intemperance, and other vices, whoe
will thinke any good to bee drawne from
thence? how can I take him to bee my
ſuperior in counſell, whom I ſee inferior
in manners? And can I thinke him fitte to

giue mee counſell, that cannot giue it to
himſelfe? he that giueth counſell to others,
he muſt ſhew himſelfe an example of good
workes; in integritie and grauitie, that his
ſpeech bee ſound and vnrebukeable; his
counſell profitable, and his life honeſt.
He that liueth wickedly in the ſight of the
people (as much as in him lyeth) he killeth
him that looketh vpon him:A
                     •
                  g. lib. de paſt. hee that followeth
him, perhaps dyeth; he that followeth
him not, liueth; but as much as in him
lyeth, he killeth both. Examples are ſtronger
then words, and it is a more full teaching
by workes then by word. The houſe
and conuerſation of a Preacher is ſet on a
hill, all ſee it and looke vpon it; it is as it
were a guide and teacher to others; whatſoeuer
hee doth, others thinke that they
may doe the like: that word is willingly
receiued of the hearer, which is vttered
from the Preacher with compaſſion of
minde. He hath learned to ſpeake truely,
that hath firſt learned to doe well. And
then doth the ſeede of the word bring
forth fruite, when the pietie of the Preacher
doeth water it in the breaſt of the hearers.
Grego. Wee muſt firſt bee cleanſed our
ſelues, and ſo cleanſe others; wee muſt
firſt be wiſe, and ſo make others wiſe; we

muſt firſt bee made lighte, and ſo lighten
others; wee muſt firſt come to God our
ſelues, and ſo bring others to God; wee
muſt firſt be ſanctified, &amp; ſo ſanctify others.
This law is layde vpon the Preachers, that
they lighten them by liuing, which they are
carefull to perſwade by ſpeaking. For the
authoritie and power of ſpeaking is loſt,
when the voyce is not helped by worke.
No man can ſtand in the valley and ſpeake
from the mount:Chryſ. ſup. Mat. 5. Where thou ſtandeſt, from
thence ſpeake; and from whence thou
ſpeakeſt, there ſtande. If thy minde bee in
the earth, how doeſt thou ſpeake from heauen?
be in heauen, if thou ſpeake from heauen.
If thou wilt not doe righteouſneſſe,
why doeſt thou make thy ſelfe a teacher of
righteouſnes? why doeſt thou call thy ſelfe
a maiſter of that, whereof thy ſelfe will be
no ſcholler, nor Diſciple? Finally, there be
three kindes of negligent Prelates:Hugo. Some
who liue well, and ſuffer their people to
liue ill. Some who liue ill, &amp; compell their
people to liue well. Some who liue ill,
&amp; will haue their people to liue ill: Thoſe
which liue wel, &amp; ſuffer their people to liue
ill: they goe before them in example; but
they doe ſinne becauſe they reproue not
their errors. Though they liue well: yet

they muſt of neceſſitie giue account of the
flocke committed to them, to the Lord of
the flocke. Thoſe which liue ill, and compell
their people to liue well: They do call
thoſe that goe aſtray, but they kill thoſe
which are rightly ſtrong: They call by
words, they kill by examples. Of the third
ſorte we are not to ſpeak at all. But though
this be true, that the ſinnes of Preachers
and profeſſors bee thus offenſiue to other,
and hurtfull to themſelues: yet neyther
preaching nor profeſſion is to be caſt off or
condemned. Phiſitions (oftentimes) liue
contrary to their owne rules: and Lawyers
liue lawleſſe: And yet both Phiſicke and
Law is good. A warrant from the King
is not to bee deſpiſed, though the Officer
bee naught. In all profeſſions, and
callings, ſome are good and ſome bad.
The callings are not to bee condemned,
becauſe of the badneſſe of them which
are in them: All fleſhe is graſſe, and
the glorie thereof like the flower of the
fielde: All men are ſubiect to ſinne and error,
but the word of the Lord abideth for
euer. It is pure, holy, iuſte, and good:
though thoſe which profeſſe and teach it,
be neuer ſo bad: Gold is not the worſe,
though a Thiefe handle it, no more

is the word of the Lord (which is more
pure then gold, being ſeuen times tried in
the fire) though wicked men profeſſe and
teach it. This is the counſell of our Sauiour
Chriſt,Mat: 23. 2. 3. ſaying; The Scribes and Phariſes
ſit in Moſes ſeate, all therefore whatſoeuer
they bid you obſerue, that obſerue
and doe;Chryſ: but after their workes do not. Excellently
ſaith one vpon that place, he that
doth euill, doth iniurie to the ſeate. Sitting
in iudgement, if thou liue well, and teach
well, thou ſhalt be iudge of all; If thou liue
ill, and teach well, thou ſhalt be iudge of
thy ſelfe onely? for by teaching well, thou
doeſt teach thy people how they ought to
liue; but by liuing ill, thou doſt teach God,
how he ought to condemne thee: If they
liue well (meaning the preachers) it is
their gaine: If they teach well, it is your
gaine (ſpeaking to the people). Take that
therefore which is yours, and trouble not
your ſelues about that which is an other
mans: for often there proceedeth good
doctrine from an euill man, euen as the
vile earth bringeth forth precious gold:
Is that precious gold contemned, becauſe
the earth is vile and baſe? euen therefore
as the gold is choſen, and the earth is left:
ſo receiue you the doctrine, and leaue the

manners; Let vs receiue the doctrine, not
the maners. Hearbes are not neceſſarie for
Bees, but flowers; ſo gather you the flowers
of doctrine, and leaue the conuerſation.
Auguſtine ſpeaking of this example of
Salomon,In Pſal: grad: ſaith thus. If Salomon be reiected
of God, why are his writings of ſuch
authoritie in the Church? that wee may
know (ſaith he) that the words of God
are not therefore true, becauſe they were
ſpoken by Salomon; but becauſe they proceeded
from God by Salomon: whatſoeuer
therefore he wrote well, it muſt be
aſcribed to God; and as for his ſin, it muſt
be left to himſelfe. The ſame may be ſaid
of Balaam, who though he was an euill
man, yet he deliuered good and wholeſome
Oracles. Dauid ſinned grieuouſly:
yet his Pſalmes, are moſt bleſſed, diuine, &amp;
ſacred; ful of ſweet comforts and inſtructions;
to be imbraced, beleeued, reuerenced,
and practiſed of all good men. Peter, his
fall was moſt greeuous, in denying his
maiſter; yet his ſermons, his doctrine and
writings, are in no caſe to be reiected, but
to be receiued and followed of all Chriſtians,
as holy, and canonicall ſcripture, inſpired
by the holy Ghoſt. Thus the falls of
the Saints are abuſed ſundrie waies; ſome

men doe excuſe all their faults; ſome by
them take occaſion to diſgrace and diſcredit
the Saints: and ſome take occaſion
thereby, to practiſe the like ſinnes in
themſelues; but theſe are all deceiued and
doe erre foulely. For they are not written
to any ſuch purpoſe; but rather that we
may learne, and ſee the corruption of all
men by nature,Ambr: in Luk: and that we may know the
Saints were but men, and therefore not to
truſt in them, but in God. And this vſe
doth one make of this example of Salomon,
that God ſuffered him to erre, leaſt
we ſhould erre. Many things are written
(ſpecially in the Pſalmes) of Chriſt in the
perſon of Salomon: Now we might take
thoſe things, to be ſpoken altogether of
Salomon himſelfe, but that we ſee, he hath
ſo grieuouſly fallen; whereupon we are
conſtrained, to paſſe thoſe excellent Oracles
from Salomon to the Meſſias: for ſeeing
we are admoniſhed in the ſcriptures,
that Chriſt knew no ſinne; and we ſee that
Salomon ſinned ſo hainouſly, we may vnderſtand
thereby, that Salomon was not
the Meſſias. And by ſuch examples, the
mercy of God is made manifeſt, to repenting
ſinners: And they may gather comfort
from thence, that if they haue the like repentance,

they ſhall haue the like fauour &amp;
mercy:Greg: in Hom: And therefore (ſaith one) I conſider
Peeter, I cōſider the theefe vpon the croſſe:
I looke vpon Zacheus: and I ſee nothing
elſe in them, but examples ſet before our
eies of hope and repentance. By theſe examples
alſo, we are ſtirred vp to humilitie
and watchfulnes; to worke our ſaluation
with feare and trembling; and vpon view
of theſe things, let him that ſtandeth take
heed leaſt he fall. And finally, we are moued
to pittie, kindnes, and mercy towards
other ſinners: ſeeing in many things we
ſinne all, and ſuch excellent, and holy men,
Patriarkes, Prophets, and Apoſtles, haue
had their grieuous falles.
         
         
            
            THE SIXT
SERMON.
            WE haue heard the reioycing and
thankſgiuing of this woman, for
the Raigne of Salomon, and ſpecially, becauſe
ſhe ſawe the loue of God, both to
Salomon and to Iſrael, in placing ſuch a
King: We haue heard the happines of Salomon,
the great and extraordinarie gifts
of God beſtowed vpon him, and manifold
ſignes of Gods fauour towards him,
and that God by his owne mouth and promiſe,
and by a ſpeciall name giuen to Salomon,
profeſſeth his loue towards him. And
therefore howſoeuer he fell, moſt grieuouſly,
and therefore deſerued no loue, but
rather hatred, and to be caſt off for euer:
yet no doubt, but God did loue him ſtill,
and in time brought him to repentance
and ſaluation. Now let vs from theſe
words, of this bleſſed woman (ſeeing
Gods loue in placing Salomon) let vs (I
ſay) learne and obſerue from hence, that a

good King, is a rare, and a ſpeciall gift of
God, and a token of his loue to the people.
For it is ſaid here, Becauſe God loued
Iſrael to eſtabliſh it for euer: therefore he
made Salomon King ouer them. When
God meanes to bleſſe a land, and to doe
any good vnto it, he giueth it good Princes;
when he meaneth to correct and puniſh
a people, he ſendeth wicked men to
Raigne ouer them. So that it is God that
giueth Kings, ſometimes in loue, ſometime
in anger.Eſa: 3. 2. 4. He threatneth to take away the
Iudge and the Prophet, the prudent, and
the aged, and to appoynt children and
babes to be Princes ouer them.Iob. 34. 30. In his iuſtice
he cauſeth the hypocrite to raigne.
Woe to thee ô land, when thy King is a
childe, and thy Princes eate in the morning:
that is,Eccle: 10. 16. 17. when they are without wiſedome
and counſell, and are giuen to their
luſts and pleaſure. But bleſſed art thou (oh
land) when thy King is the ſonne of nobles;
meaning, when he is noble for verture
and wiſedome. A good King is a great and
worthy bleſſing of God.Pro: 18. 22. Salomon ſaith,
He that findeth a good wife, findeth a
good thing, and receiueth fauour of the
Lord.Pro: 31. 10. And Bethſheba ſaith, Who ſhall
finde a vertuous woman, her price is farre

aboue the pearles. How much more truly
may this be ſaid of a vertuous King? Euery
good thing is from God: As good
husbands, good wiues, good parents,
good children, good maiſters, good ſeruants;
how much more a good King, being
publicum bonum▪
                that is, a publike good:
&amp; bonum quo comunius 
                     •
                  o melius, a good,
the more common it is, the better it is.
The want of ſuch, is an occaſion of ſinne
and ruine to the people.Iudg: 2. 19. It is ſaid (in the
booke of the Iudges,) that when the iudge
was dead, they returned and did worſe
then their fathers; in following other
gods,Iudg: 8. 33. and in worſhipping them. And againe,
when Gideon was dead, the children
of Iſrael turned away, and went a
whoring after Balim;Iudg: 17. 6. and made Baall
their God: And this is ſet downe as a cauſe
of Idolatrie and of all vilanie amongſt that
people.Iudg: 18. 1. In thoſe daies, there was no King
in Iſrael: but euery man did that, which
was good in his owne eies.Iudg: 19. 2. Miſerable is the
ſtate of the people without a Prince; like
fiſhes deuouring one another; like a body
without a head; like ſheep without a Shepheard;
like ſouldiers without a Captaine;
like children, without a mother; a ſhip not
ſafe without a gouernour; nor a priuate

houſe without a guide, nor the common-wealth
without gouernours. This knew
Moſes who was carefull of his poſteritie,
and to haue a gouernour for his place before
he died,Numb: 27 16. and therefore ſaid. Let the
Lord God of the ſpirits of all fleſh, appoynt
a man ouer the congregation, who
may goe out and in before the people, and
leade them: that the congregation of the
Lord be not as ſheepe, which haue not a
Shepheard.Eſa: 32. 1. 2. Great are the commodities
and comforts which we reape by good
Kings. Behold (ſaith Eſaiah) A King ſhall
raigne in iuſtice, and the Princes ſhall rule
in iudgement; and that man ſhall be as a
hiding place from the winde, and as a refuge
from the tempeſt; As the riuers of
waters in a drie place,Pſ: 72. and as the ſhadowe
of a great rocke in a wearie land. And
marke the happines of Salomons gouernment,
here commended; His father Dauid
prophecieth of him, that true religion
ſhould be maintained in his kingdome▪
that in his daies the righteous ſhould flouriſh:
that he ſhould be to ſuch as comfortable,
as the deawe and ſhewers after the
mowne graſſe; That in his time ſhould be
abundance of peace and plentie; That he
ſhould iudge the poore with equitie, and

deliuer him when he cryeth; and ſaue the
children of the needie, and ſubdue the oppreſſor:
redeeming their ſoules from deceite
and violence, and preſeruing them
from all wrong. Behold then, the happines,
the benefite and comfort of a good
King: He is a father, a paſtor, a nurce, to
the Church, and common-wealth; He is
as a wall, and prop, to ſtay vp the tender
boughes of the vine. He is like the ſhadow
of a great tree, refreſhing his ſubiects; He
is as it were a common ſoule to the people,
whereby the body of the Church and
common-wealth is ſtayed and vpholden:
And as the ſunne is to the planets, and
the planets to the ſtarres; ſo is the King
with his counſell, iudges and magiſtrates,
to the common-wealth; From thence it
hath life, comfort, and light. A good King
is much more excellent and better, then
a good ſubiect: His goodnes more large,
moreample, &amp; profitable, then the goodnes
of others. As much difference as there
is betwixt a priuate familie, and the common-wealth,
betwixt one houſe and a Citie,
betwixt a litle riuer and the ſea: ſo
much difference there is, betwixt a good
ſubiect and the King. He is like a ſpring,
or fountaine of water, deſcending from

the toppe of a high mountaine, watring
all the lower groundes, cheriſhing and filling
all the lower brookes. The care, the
religion, the wiſedome, the pittie, the
pietie, the liberalitie, iuſtice and temperance
of a king, profiteth all his ſubiects.
By his meanes, religion, peace, iuſtice,
artes, ſchooles, families, trades, buildings,
Church and common-wealth flouriſheth.
            Therefore (ſaith Salomon) In the proſperitie
of the righteous,Pro: 11. 10. 11. the Citie reioyceth;
and when the wicked periſheth there
is ioy. And by the bleſſing of the righteous
the Citie is exalted.Pro: 28. 28. Againe, when
the wicked riſe vp, men hide themſelues;
but when they periſh, the righteous encreaſe;
when the righteous are in authoritie,
the people reioyce;Pro: 29. 2. but when the
wicked beareth rule, the people ſigh: All
good ſubiects reioyce at the raigne of
good Princes: becauſe they enioy liues,
liberties, their goods, and the Goſpell:
when the wicked rule, there is a ſtorme;
the iuſt are moleſted; they flie as Dauid
from Saul; they hide themſelues as the
Prophets in Ahab his time; They flie as
birdes for ſhelter: But when the godly
rule, the righteous ſwarme, as Bees in a

ſunnie day: They multiplie and fill the
Churches, and ſhew their faces bouldly
and openly.
            The neceſſitie and commoditie of kings,
may be ſeene in the vniuerſall order of nature.
The chiefe Philoſophers, Plato, Ariſtotle,
and Apollonious, did ſee and feele,
that as generally there is one chiefe Creator,
and maker of all things, and as among
the ſtarres, the ſunne beareth the chiefe
light; as among Bees, there is one chiefe
king; as the flockes and heards of beaſts
haue one guide and ruler; finally, as the
cranes doe follow one leader; So there
ought to be in a common-wealth one
king as head, by whom all the members
may conſent. And this reaſon of the common-wealth
(declared by the inſtinct of
nature) God hath more euidently opened
in the holy ſcripture, and maketh mention
of kings, and doth approue and allowe
their authoritie with his owne mouth, as
we haue heard before; and the words of
this woman doth approue and teſtifie the
ſame. She bleſſeth God for this king, who
had ſet him in his owne throne. She acknowledgeth
God the author of this kind
of gouernment: ſo that the authoritie of
kings is a ſacred and diuine ordinance.

But it will be obiected: How is God the
author of this kind of gouernment? when
as Salomon was but the third King that
Iſrael had: they had no King at all before
Saul, who was a wicked King, giuen to
them not in loue, but in wrath, and that
at the vnlawfull and turbulent deſire of
the people: wherein they ſinned both againſt
God and Samuel. For thus it is written:
That the Elders of Iſrael,1. Sam: 8. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. gathered
them together, and came to Samuel vnto
Ramath, and ſaide vnto him: Behold thou
art olde, and thy ſonnes walke not in thy
waies: make vs now a King to iudge vs
like all nations. But the thing diſpleaſed
Samuel (when they ſaid giue vs a King
to iudge vs) and Samuel prayed vnto the
Lord. And the Lord ſaide vnto Samuel:
Heare the voyce of the people in all that
they ſhall ſay vnto thee: for they haue
not caſt thee away, but they haue caſt
me away, that I ſhould not raigne ouer
them: As they haue euer done ſince I
brought them out of Egypt euen vnto
this day (and haue forſaken me, and ſerued
other gods) euen ſo doe they to thee.
Now therefore hearken vnto their voyce:
howbeit, yet teſtifie vnto them, and ſhew
them the manner of the king that ſhall

raigne ouer them. Behold heere are a people
great and ſmall, affecting and deſiring
a king, hauing had none before: yet their
deſire is diſpleaſing to God and Samuel;
the reaſon is, why God miſliked their
petition, becauſe they did now caſt off
that forme of gouernment which God
himſelfe had ordained for them. They
aske that which would be hurtfull vnto
them, and that with an obſtinate and
bad minde.Deut: 17. 14. 15. But it will be obiected, that
they had a commandement and warrant
from God: who ſaid thus vnto the forefathers,
when thou ſhalt come into the
land, which the Lord thy God giueth
thee: and ſhalt poſſeſſe it, and dwell therein:
If thou ſay I will ſet a king ouer me,
like as all the nations that are about me,
then thou ſhalt make him ouer thee, whom
the Lord thy God ſhall chuſe; from among
thy brethren ſhalt thou make a King ouer
thee. Thou ſhalt not ſet a ſtranger ouer
thee, which is not thy brother. Behold
here the allowance of God, to chuſe themſelues
a king; ſo he be not a ſtranger. And
whereas it is ſaid, the Lord ſhould chuſe
them a king; they come in this place to
him, that be would make choyce of a king
for them: how doe they then offend in

this their petition and deſire? Indeed their
deſire is not ſimplie euill of it ſelfe, for if
it were ſo, it might not haue beene graunted;
but their deſire is not to this end,
to haue the word of God performed,
but to ſatisfie their owne humors. They
ſhould haue ſtayed Gods time and leiſure,
but they diſtruſt God, and are moſt
vnthankfull to Samuel, deſpiſing him in
his olde age; neither doe they aske a king
according to Gods appoyntment and inſtitution;
But let vs haue a king (ſay they)
as other nations haue, be he good or
bad. But yet if God would (as it fell
out after) giue them a king: why is he
angry with them for asking a king? becauſe
they did aske it with a bad minde,
offering ſome iniurie to Samuel: yet in
his ſecret will and purpoſe, his meaning
was to giue them a king: He diſliked in
this people, their diſtruſt and difficience:
who relied more vpon man, then God:
their bouldnes, in attempting, ſo raſhly
and ſuddenly to erect a new forme of gouernment.
He miſliked the contempt of
his owne gouernment, in that contemning
him their king, they ſought a certaine
king, after the example of other
nations, and ſo they were wearie of

Gods order. And yet, the gouernment
of kings doth not ſhut out the gouernment
of God, but God doth raigne by
kings, as well as he reigned by iudges.
The king is the miniſter of God, his ſeruant,
and deputie: he ſitteth in his place
and throne, and God is the author of
his office and authoritie, as we may ſee in
this place. And this forme of gouernment
hath beene of many nations much
deſired.
            This principalitie or kingdome was firſt
begun (as it is thought) by the Egyptians,
who could liue no while without a
king. And we finde (in the booke of Geneſes
which is moſt ancient) that the Aegyptians
had their kings, one after an other.
And whereas in the adminiſtratiō of a common
weale, there hath beene (long ſince)
three ſortes or kindes of gouernments ſet
downe, the one Monarchie, an other Ariſtocratie
when the beſt gouerne; the third
Democrati, or popular ſtate, when the common
people haue a ſtroake, in ruling the
publike weale. The firſt kinde of gouernment
is thought as good as any, if not the
beſt of all: For when counſell or gouernment
is in the power of one: In the gouernment
of the common-wealth, all things are

more eaſily performed. In the other two
kinds of gouernmēts, one oftentimes ſaith
one thing, and others will not graunt it,
and they are not eaſily agreed: Heere one
hath a ſtroake, the preheminence and prerogatiue
of commaunding and graunting.
The whole world is ruled and gouerned
by one, and what can be better or more
wiſely gouerned? The gouernment by
Iudges, was not very ſtrong; but almoſt
voluntarie, and therefore more contemptible:
but in the gouernment of a king,
there is more maieſtie in their kingly
pompe, and glory, which is a more admiration
and a wonder to the people, and is a
meanes to keepe them in better order and
ſubiection: The name of a king hath beene
alwaies famous, great, moſt glorious,
and ſacred, amongſt all nations of the
world: But ye
                  •
                ſ
                  •
               e the madneſſe, and inconſtancie
of this people: They egerly
deſired a king, and when they had him,
they would not receiue him, but many of
them deſpiſed him. And thus they dealt
with the Lord, many times before and
after this. They deſire deliuerance out of
Egypt, and when they are deliuered, they
deſire to returne thither againe They
deſire Manna from heauen, when they

were in the wilderneſſe: when they had it,
being ſweete and heauenly food, they loathed
it, and made light account of it. They
deſire to turne out of Babilon into their
owne countrey: when their returne is
graunted, a great part of them refuſe to returne.
So in this place,1. Sam. 10. 
                     〈◊〉
                  . how importunate
and eager are they with the Lord to haue a
King: but when hee was annoynted and
choſen King, ſome wicked men ſaid; How
ſhall he ſaue vs? ſo they deſpiſed him and
brought him no preſents. How can ſuch
people be pleaſed, being fickle, wauering,
and changeable, miſliking the beſt gouernment
that is; yea ſuch as the Lord himſelfe
alloweth, and appointeth: and ſuch, as they
themſelues (ſometimes) haue liked and deſired.
1. Sam. 10 24. 2
                     •
                  . But yet it is ſayd, that many of thoſe
people ſhouted &amp; ſayd, God ſaue the King.
And when Saul went home to Gibiah,
there followed him a band of men, whoſe
heart God had touched. Againe it may
be obiected: how is God the Author of the
calling and authority of Kings? how doe
they ſit in his throne? When many of them
are moſt wicked in life, and vniuſt, and
corrupt in gouerning; when all things are
full of confuſion and diſorder: but we are
to looke to the good wee haue of gouernment.

And wee are to know, that both
bad Gouernours, and corruptions in gouernement,
the ſinnes are not of God but
from themſelues. God doth neyther allow
nor commaund them, but forbid and deteſt
them. And yet there is ſome profit in bad
Magiſtrates: Many good lawes, and ſome
forme of iuſtice amongſt them. Wicked
Gouernours, are as plagues &amp; puniſhments
for the ſinnes of the people: Becauſe when
they are good, we receiue not that goodneſſe
at the hand of God thankefully, ſubmitting
our ſelues to his lawes and ordinances;
but abuſe the goodneſſe of God
to our ſinfull and beaſtly luſts:Tyndal. Therefore
doeth God make a ſcourge of them, and
turne them to wilde beaſts (contrary to the
nature of their names) euen to Lions,
Beares, Foxes, and vncleane Swine, to auenge
himſelfe of our vnnaturall, blinde,
vnkindneſſe, and of our rebellious diſobedience.
So he turneth the fruitfull land into
barrenneſſe, for the wickednes of them
that dwell therein.Pſa. 107. 34. Let vs not take the
ſtaffe by the end, to ſeeke to auenge our
ſelues of his rod, which is the euill rulers,
The childe, as long as he ſeeketh to auenge
himſelfe of the rod, hath an euill heart: for
he thinketh not that the correction is right,

or that hee hath deſerued it, neither repenteth,
but reioyceth in his wickednes, and
ſo long ſhall hee neuer bee without a rod;
yea ſo long ſhall the rod bee made ſharper
and ſharper. If he acknowledge his faulte,
and take the correction meekely, and kiſſe
the rod, and amend with the learning and
nurture of his father and mother, then the
rod is taken away. So, if we reſiſt euill Rulers,
ſeeking to ſet our ſelues at libertie, we
ſhall (no doubt) bring our ſelues into more
cruell bondage, and wrappe our ſelues into
much more miſerie &amp; wretchednes: For if
the heads is ouercome they will make their
yoakes ſorer. If the people ouercome the
Rulers, then make they away for a more
cruell nation, which hath no right to the
Crowne. If wee ſubmit our ſelues to the
chaſtening of God, and meekely acknowledge
our ſins, for the which we are ſcourged,
and kiſſe the rod, &amp; amend our liues:
Then God will take the rod away: that is,
he will giue the Rulers a better heart; or if
they continue their malice, and perſecute
thee for well doing, hee will deliuer thee
out of their tyrannie. When Iſrael ſinned
againſt GOD, hee gaue them vp
to one Tyrant or other: when they
repented, hee ſent them deliuerance.

A Chriſtian man (in reſpect of God) is but
a paſſiue thing, a thing that ſuffereth onely,
and doeth nought; as the ſicke, in reſpect
of the Chirurgion or Phiſition doth ſuffer
onely. The Chirurgion ſlancheth, cutteth
out the dead fleſh, ſearcheth the wounds,
thruſteth in tents, burneth, ſeweth, ſtitcheth,
and putteth coraſiues to draw out the
corruption; and laſt of all, layeth too healing
playſters, and maketh whole. The
Phiſition giueth purgations and drinks to
driue out the diſeaſe, and then with reſtoratiues
bringeth health. Now if the ſicke
reſiſt the razor or ſearching yron, doth he
not reſiſte his owne health, and is the cauſe
of his owne death? So likewiſe is it of vs,
if we reſiſt euill rulers, which are the rods
and ſcourges, wherewith God chaſtiſeth
vs, the inſtruments wherewith God doth
ſearch our wounds, and bitter drinkes to
driue out ſinne, and coraſiues to draw out
by the roote the coare of the poxe of the
ſoule, that fretteth inward. Thus a Chriſtian
receiueth all things at the hands of
God, both good and bad, both ſweete and
ſower, both wealth and woe: and he doth
take good Princes as a ſpeciall belſsing,
and bad Princes as a iuſt iudgement ſent
for ſinne. But it will bee obiected, That

the Lord ſayth of ſome Rulers, that they
raigned not by him:Hoſea. 8. 4. They haue ſet vp a
King (ſaith hee) but not by me; they haue
made Princes and I knew it not. The meaning
is, that the people of Iſrael had ſet vp
Ieroboam, by whom they ſought their
owne liberty (as many Tyrants, do not reſpect
Gods worde or will, but their owne
luſts and affections:) But wee muſt diſtinguiſh
the office from the perſon; and wee
muſt know that men do abuſe good things
through their owne corruption: And therfore
whatſoeuer is good in gouernment is
from God; and hee doth vſe the Diuell as
plagues and puniſhments for the ſinnes of
the people.Dan. 2. 2. 
                     •
                  7. It is ſayd by Daniel, that God
changeth the times and ſeaſons: He taketh
away Kings, and ſetteth vp Kings. And
Daniel ſaith thus, to the proud King Nebucadnezer:
O King, thou art a King of
Kings, and the God of heauen hath giuen
thee a Kingdome, power, ſtrength and
glorie. And when Pilate ſayde to Chriſt,
Knoweſt thou not that I haue power to
crucifie thee, &amp; haue power to looſe thee?
Ieſus anſwered, Thou couldeſt not haue
power at all againſt me, except it were giuen
thee from aboue. But it may bee yet
obiected, That the authoritie and office of

Kings, is not of diuine inſtitution▪ Seeing
Saint Peter calleth it an ordinance of man,
and that place is abuſed by the Pope, to
the diſgracing of Chriſtian Princes. The
meaning is not, that the power of Princes
and Magiſtrates, is onely a deuiſe of man,
and onely from man; But as one ſaith. Eſt
ordinatio diuina, ſecundum ſubſtantium ordinatio
humana, ſecundum modum ac finum: It is
a diuine ordinance, in reſpect of the ſubſtance.
and it is humane, in reſpect of the
manner and end. The office and power of
the King is from God: The maner of chooſing
and gouerning the common-wealth, is
in many things humane, and the end is for
the good and preſeruation of man: and ſo
are lawfull Paſtors, though their calling be
diuine; yet they are choſen, approued, and
ordeined, for the benefite of men. And thus
the Apoſtle defineth a High Prieſte: To
bee taken from among men, and is ordeyned
for men, in things perteyning to God:
And ſo is a King taken from among men,
ordeyned for men, in things pertayning
both to God &amp; men; That is, for the good
both of the Church and Common-wealth.
As for the Popes office and vſurped ſupremacie,
it is meerely humane; nay it is diabolicall,
and againſt the examples and authoritie

of holy Scripture. Hee hath no
true nor iuſt warrant, from the Law, Prophets,
Euangeliſts, nor Apoſtolicall writings:
But of this, it may be wee ſhall
ſpeake more hereafter. It is ſufficiently
proued already, and it ſhall appeare more
plainely hereafter, that the office and
power of Princes is diuine &amp; ſacred. Now
becauſe ſome Kings are giuen of God to
his people in loue and mercy, and ſome in
wrath &amp; iudgement: Let them try themſelues,
whether it may be ſayd of them, as
it is ſayde of Salomon in this place, That
God in loue to them, and in loue to his
people, hath ſet them in his owne throne.
Let them know then, that ſuch a King (as is
giuen of God in loue) is both qualified
with gifts fit for his calling, and will and
muſt neceſſarily performe the duty of his
place: as this Queene teſtifieth of Salomon
in the words following. It is ſayd of
Dauid, that as hee was choſen from the
ſheepe-folds, to feede Gods people in Iacob,
and his inheritance in Iſrael:Pſa. 78. 70. ſo hee
fedde them according to the ſimplicitie
of his heart, and guided them
by the diſcretion of his hands.2. Sam. 8. 15. And
it is ſayde of him (in another place)
that hee raigned ouer all ISRAEL,

and executed iudgement and iuſtice:Pſa. 101. 1. and
hee himſelfe proteſteth, that he gouerned
his Court, Church, and Common-wealth,
according to the true rules of mercy and
iudgement. And it is ſayde of Salomon,
that all Iſrael feared him; for they ſaw that
the wiſedome of God was in him to doe
iuſtice, and to performe faithfully the duty
of his place and calling. A learned writer
vpon that Pſalme 78. ſayeth, God did
chooſe Dauid to this end, that hee ſhould
feed his people; and therefore he fed them.
He choſe Saul to afflict his people, &amp; therefore
he afflicted them. For marke what the
Lord ſayd to the people that would needes
haue a King; hee threatneth them, and giueth
them that King in his wrath. This
(ſayth he) ſhall be the manner of the King
that ſhall raigne ouer you:1. Sam. 8. 10. 11. 12. 13. &amp;c. Hee will take
your ſonnes, and appoynt them to his Chariots,
and to bee his horſemen, and ſome
ſhall runne before his Chariot. Alſo hee
will make them as Captaynes ouer thouſands,
and Captaynes ouer fifties, and to
eare his ground, and to reape his harueſt,
and to make inſtruments of warre, and the
things that ſerue for his Chariots. He will
alſo take your daughters, and make them
Apothecaries, and Cookes, and Bakers.

And hee will take your fields, and your
vineyards, and your beſt Oliue trees, and
giue them to his ſeruants. And he will take
the tenth of your ſeede, and of your vineyards,
and giue it to his Eunuches and his
ſeruants. And he will take your men ſeruants,
and your maide ſeruants, and the
chiefe of your young men, and your Aſſes,
and put them to his worke. Hee will take
the tenth of your ſheepe, and you ſhall be
his ſeruants: and you ſhall cry out at that
day, becauſe of your King, whom you haue
choſen you, and the Lord will not heare
you at that day. But it may be, ſome will
ſay, May Kings thus oppreſſe the Common-wealth?
no, they haue no ſuch authoritie
by their office: But this King was
ſent in wrath from God, to plague this people;
and therefore hee doth plague them.
Samuelthreatneth to that people, the deminution
of thoſe liberties which the Iſraelites
enioyed before vnder the Iudges He
admoniſheth them of the hard eſtate
which was to enſue. This was Gods doing
in his iuſtice, for the ſinnes of the people.
For God is in heauen, hee may doe
whatſoeuer hee will; his wayes are all iuſt
and righteous. But as for Kings, they n
                  •
               ay
not doe what they liſt, they are bound to

the lawes of God, to the lawes of charitie,
equitie and righteouſneſſe. But thoſe
which are giuen in wrath, they ſhall vexe
and afflict the people. Chriſt ſayd to Peter,
Feede my ſheepe. It was ſayd to Antichriſt,
Deuoure, deſtroy, beate downe,
ſeduce the people, becauſe they receiue
not the loue of truth, that they might bee
ſaued: Therefore he deſtroyeth, ſeduceth,
and deceiueth as many as hee can. The
Lord threatneth in Zacharie:Zac. 11. 16. I will raiſe
vp a ſhepheard in the Land, which ſhall
not looke for the thing which is loſt, nor
ſeeke the tender lambes, nor heale that
which is hurt, nor feede that which ſtandeth
vp: he ſhall eate the fleſh of the fat,
and teare their clawes in peeces. Our Sauiour
Chriſt ſayth, That a thiefe, commeth
to ſteale, kill, and deſtroy. So that by
their deedes. practiſes, and fruites, both
of Princes and Miniſters, it may bee eaſily
gathered, whether they bee ſent to a people
in loue or wrath. But of the dutie of
ſuch Gouernours as are giuen in loue, wee
ſhall ſpeake hereafter. Now as the dignitie
of Kings appeareth, in that their calling is
ſo diuine, and from God himſelfe: ſo in
this alſo, that they are in his place and
throne, and haue ſo many honourable titles

giuen vnto them in the Scripture. They are
called nurcing fathers and mothers, ſhepheards
of the people, leaders, keepers,
helpers, Gouernours; yea, in ſome ſenſe
Sauiours; and God doth giue them his
owne name, counting them gods: not by
nature; for ſo they are men like other men,
borne and conceiued as other, and ſhall
dye like men: But they are gods by office,
they are the Vicegerents and Images of
God. This is a great honour, great excellencie
and dignitie, to be admired and reuerenced
of all men. Yet let mee admoniſh
you, that the ſame, or the like titles
and dignities may be applyed to the faithfull
Miniſters of God; though they be accounted
and taken by moſt men, as vile,
baſe, contemptible, and the very off-ſcourings
of the world: And many which doe
magnifie, and almoſt adore great perſons,
Gouernours, and Magiſtrates (it may bee
for feare, 
                  •
               latterie, fauour and lucer) euen
theſe doe vil
                  •
               ſie, ſcorne, contemne, and
diſgrace the calling of the Miniſters, as
much as they can. But let them know,
that there is ſome likenes and affinitie betwixt
the calling of a Magiſtrate, and the
calling of the Miniſter. As good Princes are
the bleſſings of God, ſo are good miniſters;

as we haue heard before, when wee intreated
of true wiſedome. As the calling of the
Magiſtrate is ſacred and diuine, ſo is the
calling of the Miniſter; it is the holy Ghoſt
that appoynted Ouer-
                  •
               eers in the Church;
and it is Ieſus Chriſt that giueth gifts to
men, to become Paſtors and teachers in the
Church. Thoſe glorious titles (before ſpoken
of) they belong alſo to the Miniſters of
God: They are paſtors, fathers, nurces,
and in Gods ſtead. Magiſtrates are to be
honoured; ſuch as rule well in word and
doctrine are worthie of double honour.
The ſame is the end of both their callings,
to ſuppreſſe and beate downe ſinne: But
our power is ſpirituall, therefore the greater,
euen the power of God to ſaluation;
power to conuert ſoules, to beate downe
Sathan and ſinne, and to bring into bondage
euery thought that doth rayſe it ſelfe
againſt God. By the Magiſtrates care, policie
and power, wee liue in peace, and are
defended from forren &amp; domeſticall foes.
By the miniſterie of the word, the ſword
of the ſpirit, wee are armed againſt our ſpirituall
enemies, and enioy true peace of
conſcience: And therefore the miniſterie
of the word is truely called, the ſtreugth
and life of a land. When Eliſhai ſaw Eliah

taken vp into heauen, he cryed, My father,
my father, the Chariot of Iſrael, and the
horſemen thereof. It is ſinne that weakens
a land, it is religion and pietie that maketh
it ſtrong. By the preaching of the word
ſinne is weakned, and all vertue and goodnes
is increaſed &amp; confirmed. The want of
this word, is the famiſhing of mens ſoules:
the plentie of this word, is the life of their
ſoules. Magiſtrates are keepers and maintayners
of both the tables of the commandements;
and ſo are all faithfull Miniſters.
Magiſtrates are to execute outward puniſhments
vpon offenders. Miniſters haue
power to reproue, to binde, and exclude
notorious offenders▪ Our bodies, goods
&amp; liues, are ſubiect to Princes; but al power,
worſhippe, and maieſtie, are ſubiect ſo the
word which wee preach: And as they are
rebels to Princes which reſiſt their power,
ſo are they rebels to God, which ſet themſelues
againſt the doctrine, counſels,
and exhortations of his faithfull Miniſters.
And finally, as good Magiſtrates doe comfort
and encourage good ſubiects, by rewards,
honours and countenance; ſo good
Miniſters are carefull by all means poſſible
to comfort good Chriſtians by the ſweete
promiſes and mercies of God, and by the

aſſurance of remiſſion of ſinnes and life eternall.
Seeing therefore there is ſuch agreement,
both in the titles and callings of
Magiſtrates and Miniſters, there ſhould be
alſo an agreement and vnion in affection
betwixt them. They are intirely to affect
and loue one another. The Miniſters are
to guide and direct the Rulers by the
word, and they againe are to defend them
by the ſword. This the Lord teacheth,
when hee appoynted two brethren to gouerne
his people, Moſes and Aaron, the
one to gouerne, the other to teach. It
went well with Saul, ſo long as he hearkened
to Samuel the Prophet. Dauid had
Gad and Nathan neere vnto him, as his
faithfull Counſellers. Hezekiah the King,
was directed by Eſaiah the Prophet. Therfore
Magiſtrates are to countenance good
Miniſters, and to encourage them. Wee
teach and perſwade all men to obey the
higher powers. We pray for you publikelie
and priuately, and ſtirre vp others to
doe the like. Wee ſet foorth the excellencie
of your callings: We threaten damnation
to rebels and traytors. As for our
calling, although diuine and ſacred, yet
odious and contemptible to the worlde,
becauſe wee reproue the ſinnes of all men:

we endure many hard ſpeeches, vnkindneſſes
and iniuries of wicked men: the eyes
of many, their eares, hearts and mouthes
are open againſt vs. Wee are ſubiect to
many temptations and infirmities. Wee
haue many diſcomforts and diſcouragements.
Who is to comfort, and countenance,
and defend vs, but the good Magiſtrates?
And you muſt not bee offended
though we ſometimes iuſtlie reproue your
opon ſinnes, in open place. It is our office
to reproue ſinne in all; as it is your dutie
to puniſh ſinne in all. As you muſt not be
partiall, and not haue reſpect of perſons
in iudgement; ſo we muſt not be partiall
in reproouing. We doe it (God, knoweth)
in dutie, loue and conſcience; and therefore
you are to take it in good part. All
holy men, though they were Kings and
Princes, haue beene content patiently to
receiue iuſt reproofe: And the ſinnes of
Magiſtrates and great perſons doe moſt
hurt of all other; and therefore moſt of all
to be reprooued. If wee be careleſſe and
idle in our place; If we be flatterers &amp; time
ſeruers. If we be corrupt &amp; falſe in our doctrine;
If we be wicked and diſſolute in life;
Let vs bee cenſured according to our deſerts.
But if our care be to do good, to take

what paynes we can in our places, to winne
foules, to beate downe ſinne and Poperie,
to liue honeſtly, and keepe a good conſcience
in all things: If neyther our doctrine
nor life can bee iuſtly touched, why
ſhould you be ſtrange vnto vs? why ſhould
you keepe backe from vs your fauour, aſſiſtance,
and countenance?
            It is the chiefe end of the office and
calling of a good Magiſtrate, to defend
and countenance all good and honeſt men,
much more the faithfull and paynefull
Miniſters of God.
            And ſeeing Magiſtrates and Miniſters
haue the ſame authour, the ſame names
and dignitie, let them ioyne together
for the beating downe of ſinne, and bee
helpers and comforters one to another;
and let the higheſt of all remember,
ſpecially thoſe which make ſmall account
of our calling; let them remember and
lay vp in their hearts theſe worthie places
of Scripture. Remember that caueat
which GOD giueth to his people:Deut. 12. 19. Beware
that thou forſake not the Leuite
as long as thou liueſt vpon the earth.
And againe:Pſa. 10. 15. Touch not mine annointed,
and doe my Prophets no harme. This
was ſpoken euen to Kings and Princes,

to their rebuke and ſhame. And neuer forget
that bitter prayer of Moſes, who yet
was the mildeſt man that euer liued vpon
the earth,Deut 3. 11. Bleſſe ô Lord (ſaith he) his ſubſtance,
and accept the worke of his hands:
he ſpeaketh of the tribe of Leuie, the faithfull
miniſters of God: Smite through the
Ioynes of them that riſe againſt him, and
of them that hate him, that they neuer riſe
vp againe.Luk. 10. 16. And remember that ſaying of
our Sauiour Chriſt, ſpeaking to his Apoſtles,
ſaying, He that heareth you, heareth
me, and he that deſpiſeth you, deſpiſeth
me. And thoſe ſayings of the Apoſtle; Now
we beſeech you brethren, that you knowe
them which labour among you, and are
ouer you in the Lord,1. Theſ: 5. 1
                     •
                  . and admoniſh you,
that you haue them in ſingular loue for
their worke ſake. Loue them for their calling,
for the gifts of God in them, for their
great paines, for the gaine and profit
which you doe or may reape by them. And
neuer forget that ſaying of the ſame Apoſtle
alreadie alleaged,1. Tim. 5. That thoſe which labour
in word and doctrine are worthy of
double honor. And finally, remember the
ſweete and gratious exhortation of the
worthy king, good king Iehoſephat, deliuered
to his owne ſubiects by his owne

mouth,2. Chron: 20. 20. ſaying, Heare you me ô Iuda, and
you inhabitants of Ierſalem, put your
truſt in the Lord your God, and you ſhall
be aſſured; beleeue his Prophets, and you
ſhall proſper. Now let vs come to the
dutie of a king, and of all gouernours, ſet
downe in fewe words, by this bleſſed
Queene; ſhe putteth Salomon in minde o
                  •
               
the end why God did thus highly preferre
and aduance him, it was to execute iudgement
and iuſtice, to doe equitie and righteouſnes.
This is the end and calling of a
                  •
               
gouernours and rulers, appoynted by God
himſelfe, and let vs in reſpect of the place
and perſons, applie our ſpeech, to ſubordinate
magiſtrates, who are the kings deputies,
and rule in his name vnder him, they
muſt faithfully doe their duties, and iuſtly
diſcharge their places, and the truſt committed
to them. And by the king, being
the chiefe magiſtrate, the ſcripture do
                  ••
               
vnderſtand, all other gouernours, officers,
aſſiſtance and helpers to him; he cannot
rule and gouerne alone by himſelfe, ſo
great a kingdome and people, he hath need
of many eies, many eares, many heads and
hands, to helpe and aſſiſt him in gouernment.
Exod. 18. Moſes by the counſell of Iethroh

               s
father in lawe, prouideth ſundrie officers

and iudges vnder him, for hearing and
iudging of cauſes.2. Chron: 19. King Iehoſephat ſetteth
iudges in the land, throughout all the
ſtrong Cities in Iuda, Citie by Citie, and
telleth them, and teacheth them, what
they are to doe in their places.1. Pet 2. 13. 14. S. Peter
exhorting vs to ſubmiſſion to the king,
as to the ſuperior, ſo he maketh mention
of gouernours vnder the king, for
the puniſhment of euill doers, and for
the praiſe of them that doe well. We
haue hard before, the excellencie of kings
and magiſtrates, namely, that God is the
author of their place, that they are in
Gods ſtead, and called by his name. This
no doubt is a great honour and dignitie
to be aboue others, to be chiefe in a
kingdome, in a citie, towne or countrie,
to repreſent the perſon of a king,
yea to repreſent the perſon of God: this
may be an occaſion to lift vp the hearts
of many aboue their brethren, becauſe
of the greatnes of their place; and many
in this their office, doe onely reſpect,
the highnes, the glory and worſhip of
it: and therefore are conceited in themſelues.
But as it is Hon
                     ••
                  , ſo it is Onus:
As the place of the magiſtrate is an honour,
ſo it is a burden, a great and heauie

burden: and the conſideration of this may
ſerue, to humble good magiſtrates, both
in the ſight of God and men; to remember
in what low and baſe aſtate they haue
beene heretofore, though they be now
aduanced.Gen: 32. 10. They may ſay to God in the humilitie
of their ſoules, with Iacob, I am not
worthy of the leaſt of all thy mercies, and
all the truth which thou haſt ſhewed to
thy ſeruant; for with my ſtaffe came I ouer
this Iorden, and now haue I gotten two
bands: And may not ſome ſay with Dauid
that the Lord hath choſen and taken them
from the Sheepefoldes,Pſal: 78. 70. to feed his people
in Iacob, and his inheritance in Iſrael. May
not many truly ſay, that though they be
now of great wealth, yet they haue beene
as poore as others: though they be now
gouernours and rulers of others, yet they
haue beene ſubiect to thoſe whom they
gouerne. Nay the greatnes of their place,
the honor and dignitie that they are in,
ſhould not make them proud: for if they
looke well to the great and manifold duties
required, they ſhall haue no cauſe to
be lifted vp, but rather to be humbled
and caſt downe: they are not called to the
place of gouernment to be proud, idle, to
take their pleaſure and eaſe, to liue in 
                  •
               otouſnes,

in luxurie and licenſiouſnes, but
faithfully and carefully to performe all
the duties which God requireth of good
gouernours in holie ſcripture: to gouerne
well, is a matter of great difficultie, care,
labour, and danger: many times in pleaſing
men, they diſpleaſe God; and in pleaſing
God, they diſpleaſe men; ſo that they
can hardly ſo behaue themſelues, but that
they ſhall diſpleaſe the one or the other:
What wiſedome, humane and diuine, is required
in good gouernors, or elſe they
muſt ſee with other mens eies, he muſt
ſpeake with other mens tongues, and they
muſt be wiſe by other mens heads: gouernours
without true wiſedome, are like
a ſhip without an anker, like birdes without
winges. A wiſe gouernour is like ſalt
to ſeaſon others, he is as the eie and the
heart of the people. What courage and
magnanimitie is required in good rulers,
for the ſuppreſſing of the rebellious and
wicked, and for doing of iuſtice without
partialitie? and what care, diligence, prouidence,
labour, and toyle, for the right
gouernment of ſo many, and ſo many ſorts
of men. The heathen could ſay, that the
greatnes of gouernment, is the greatnes
                  •
                of
care: he is in dutie to warrant the ſleepe

of his ſubiects by his owne watchfulnes;
their peace by his labour; their eaſe by his
induſtrie; their leiſure by his buſines; the
head watcheth and prouideth for the gouernment
of the whole body; how carefull
and watchfull are nurces for the feeding
and ordering of their children? how
watchful are good Shepheards for the leading,
and feeding of their ſheepe? and how
carefull is a good houſeholder and maiſter,
for the gouernment of the whole familie?
ſo that it is an old ſaying, Therein
but one ſeruant in an houſe: meaning, that
the maiſter is ſeruant to all; in reſpect of
his care and prouidence ouer all.Greg: In very
deed ſaith one, it ſeemeth to me, that it is
the art of all artes, the diſcipline of all diſciplines,
to gouerne man, which of all
creatures is moſt variable in manners, and
diuers in will. An other ſaith, that to gouerne,
is not onely a dignitie, but an art;
yea the greateſt of all other: for if they
rule ouer other things which are without
man, the skill and the cunning is better
then all the things themſelues: how much
more is the gouernment ouer men moſt
excellent, ſeeing that men doe excell all
other things? There are diuers kindes of
artes, one excelling an other, there is the
art and skill of husbandrie, of carpentrie

and building,Chry: in 2. Cor. 7. which are very neceſſaire,
and doe ſerue for the helpe and conſeruation
of this life: there be other artes, which
are leſſe then theſe; As to be ſhepheards,
taylors, ſmithes, but amongſt all theſe, huſbandrie
is moſt neceſſarie, which God
himſelfe ordained and commaunded ſo
ſoone as he had made man: for it is poſſible
for a man to liue without moſt of the other
arts, but without husbandrie it is impoſſible
to liue; without it, all the reſt are to no
purpoſe; yet kings doe gouerne husbandmen,
and there is ſome likenes betweene
husbandrie and gouernment: the gouernor
is a ſetter of plants, ſome he proyneth,
ſome he cheriſheth, and cauſeth to growe:
ſome he cutteth downe and pulleth vp by
the rootes: good gouernours are like husbandmen;
by husbandrie, the badnes of
the earth, &amp; the wildnes of the plants are
made better: by weedes, the plantes and
ſeedes are hidden &amp; choakt; but the good
husbandman, is carefull to plucke them
vp: ſo by good lawes men are made better,
and the wicked which hinder &amp; hurt
others, are reſtrained &amp; ſuppreſſed: and as
husbandmen haue many things to hinder
their planting and ſowing, as wild beaſts,
tempeſts, haile, floods, drought, ſo haue
gouernours hinderances and enemies to

their gouernment, which they will carefully
auoyde as well as they can. This compariſon
of husbandrie, as it ſetteth out the
neceſſitie and excellencie of gouernment,
ſo it ſheweth the great care and labour
that is ioyned with it: for who is more
carefull and painefull then the husband
man? let therefore magiſtrates be humbled
in conſideration of the vertues and duties
of their great calling: and yet for their further
humiliation, let them remember
their owne infirmities and wants to performe
their dutie as they ought. Let them
remember that they are ſubiect to the
temptations of the diuell, of the fleſh, and
the world: and let them knowe, that they
are ſubiect to the common miſeries of
this life, and to other miſeries and croſſes,
incident and peculiar to their calling: and
let them in no caſe forget, that they muſt
giue account to the great Iudge and gouernour
of all the world, how they haue
behaued themſelues in their places and
callings: It ſhall be ſaid to them, to euery
one of them, Come, giue account of thy
ſtewardſhip, thou mayeſt be no longer
ſteward. And for their further humiliatiō,
they muſt knowe, that they cannot tell
how long they ſhall enioy thoſe places of

honour and dignitie, being ſubiect to
death as well as others; and they cannot
tell how ſoone they may be taken away.
Agathon had wont to ſay, that a magiſtrate
muſt alway remember theſe three
things. Firſt, that he ruleth men; ſecondly,
that he muſt rule according to lawes;
and thirdly, that he ſhall not alwaies
rule. The conſideration of this latter
poynt of the ſhortnes and vncertaintie
of this life, that we muſt certainely die,
and we knowe not how ſoone, is able to
humble, the mightieſt potentate in the
earth. The higheſt of them all may ſay, I
my ſelfe am alſo mortall, and a man like
all other, and am come of him that was
firſt made of the earth, and in my mothers
wombe was I faſhioned as others
are; and when I was borne I receiued the
common ayre, crying and weeping at
the firſt as all others doe; I was nouriſhed
in ſwadling cloathes, and with
cares. For there is no king that hath any
other beginning of birth, all men haue
one entrance to life, and a like going
out. Dauid calleth death the hie way
of all the earth, and he himſelfe putteth

gouernours in minde of their mortall
ſtate: for howſoeuer he ſaith, that
God ſtandeth in the aſſemblie of gods,
he iudgeth among gods: And againe, I
haue ſaid yee are gods, and yee all are
children of the moſt high: this he ſpeaketh
of magiſtrates, magnifying and
extolling their office, and giuing them
three times in that Pſalme, the glorious
and ſacred titles of Gods; yet leaſt
they ſhould be puffed vp with the excellencie
of their callings,Pſ: 82. 1. 6. 7. preſently he
telleth them, ye ſhall die as a man, and
you Princes ſhall fall like others. He
would haue them remēber, that though
they be gods, yet they are but mortall
gods; of this mortall ſtate of Princes,
we to our great diſcomfort haue had
wofull experience not long ſince in this
our Land: A worthie young Prince of
great hope, the flower and Iewell of
our land, the comfort of his parents,
and of all good Chriſtians and ſubiects,
the heire apparent of ſundrie kingdomes,
how ſoone hath the Lord taken
him away in the prime of his tender,
young, and flouriſhing age? happie no

doubt is he, that is ſo ſoone taken away
from a miſerable world, but vnhappie
are we, whoſe ſinnes, hath cauſed
the Lord to take ſuch a Iewell
from vs: it cannot but prognoſticate,
ſome heauie iudgement to this our
nation and countrie: and great cauſe
haue all chriſtian hearts amongſt vs,
to mourne and lament for ſuch a great
loſſe. This Church may ſay as Naomi
ſaid, vpon the death of her husband,
when they called her Naomi, ſhe anſwered
them, call me not Naomi, that
is beautifull,Ruth. 1. 20. but call me Marah, that
is bitter: for the almightie hath giuen
me much bitterneſſe. Why call you me
Naomi, ſeeing the Lord hath humbled
me, and the almightie hath
brought me to aduerſitie? Wee may
mourne and ſay with Dauid,2. Sam: 3. 20. mourning
for the death of Ionathon, Tell it not in
Gath, nor publiſh it in the ſtreetes of
Aſhkelon, leaſt the daughters of Philiſtimes
reioyce,2. Sam: 3. 33. leaſt the daughters
of vncircumciſed triumph. And as he
ſaith in an other place, after the death
of Abner, there is a Prince, and a great

man fallen this day in Iſrael. But bleſſed
be God, who is ſtill more mercifull to
vs then we deſerue, and in iudgements
remembreth mercy, who though for
our ſinnes hath cut off ſo precious a
branch, yet the bleſſed tree is yet aliue,
and ſtandeth and flouriſheth, and alſo
ſome ſweet branches to our great comfort
and hope. Now the Lord of mercy,
bleſſe them all and multiplie, and encreaſe
them, and continue them and
theirs if his will be, to the end of the
world, to their owne comfort, the ſhame
of their enemies, and to the common
good of this Church and commonwealth:
yet let vs not forget that heauie
iudgement, but ſo remember it, that
it may drawe vs to true repentance, for
that is the true vſe of all iudgements:
and let vs learne to depend wholy and
onely on God, and not vpon any mortall
man.Pſal: 146. 3. Remembring that counſell of
Dauid, put not your truſt in Princes,
nor in the ſonne of man, for there is
no helpe in him, his breath departeth,
and he returneth to his earth; then his
thoughts periſh: bleſſed is he that hath

the God of Iacob for his helpe, whoſe
hope is in the Lord his God which made
heauen and earth, the ſea 'and all that
therein is, which keepeth his fidelitie
for euer. And let this and the like examples
of the death of great perſons, put
all in minde (though they be neuer ſo
high,) of the mortall ſtate of all the
children of men, of what ſtate or conditions
ſoeuer they be; And thus though
gouernours and magiſtrates take occaſion
by the dignitie of their places, yet
both this, and many other cauſes, may
moue, drawe, and induce them to true
humilitie. And now let vs drawe neerer
to the deſcription of the ſeuerall duties
required of Chriſtian gouernours, both
in this and in many other places of ſcripture,
the Lord doth not onely in his
word ſet downe, generally the rules of
all chriſtianitie, but alſo the ſeuerall duties
of all ſtates, degrees, and callings, as
of fathers &amp; children, maiſters and ſeruants,
husbands &amp; wiues, kings &amp; ſubiects:
wherein we may ſee the fulnes
&amp; equitie of ſcripture, applying it ſelfe,
and ſpeaking to all ſorts of men. Againe,

we learne this leſſon by it, that it is not
ſufficient for vs to performe the generall
duties of Chriſtianitie, but alſo the particular
duties of our ſeuerall callings. And
we may ſee the corruptiō of our natures,
that euery one is willing and readie to
heare the duties of other men, forgetting
and litle regarding what doth belong
and appertaine to themſelues. The
ſeruant is content to heare the dutie of
his maiſter, and the maiſter is content to
heare the dutie of his ſeruants; children
are content to heare the dutie of their
parents, and parents are content to heare
the duties of children. Husbāds are willing
to heare the duties of wiues, and
wiues are content to heare the duties of
husbands. Miniſters are cōtent to heare
the duties of the people, and people are
content to heare the duties of miniſters.
Subiects are content to heare the duties
of their Princes, and Princes are
willing to heare the duties of their ſubiects.
But fewe or none are ſo readie or
willing to-heare and learne their owne
duties. For redreſſe of this corruption,
let euery one ſay with the kingly Prophet

Dauid, I will heare what the Lord
will ſay concerning me. And of al other,
the ſcriptures doe often and plentifully
ſpeake of the duties of Princes and Magiſtrates,
in Exodus, in Deutrinomie, in
the Prouerbs of Salomon, in the Lawe,
in the Prophets, in the Goſpell; and
many preachers, many times, in many
places, vpon iuſt occaſion doe handle
this doctrine of the Magiſtrates, and
this is not ſuperfluous, becauſe it is a
matter of great importance: for if they
doe their duties, the Church and common-wealth
flouriſheth: otherwiſe there
is decay and ruine. Againe, their office
is hard and difficult, much holines,
much wiſedome and faithfulnes required
of them, their charge and burden
is great, they haue many hindrances and
enemies, they are ſubiect to many dangers,
therefore they had neede of much
&amp; daily inſtruction, &amp; ſo much teaching,
&amp; ſo many ſermons, ſhalbe ſo many witneſſes
againſt them if they do not regard
&amp; follow thē: but to come to the deſcription
of good rulers, their firſt care muſt
be, that if they wil wel &amp; profitably rule

others, they muſt firſt gouerne and rule
themſelues. The very heathen haue accounted
thoſe the beſt Emperours and
rulers, which could rule their owne affections,
they haue thought &amp; ſaid, that
we neede not ſo much feare our armed
enemies, as our owne deſires and luſtes:
that it is a farre greater worke to ouercome
our ſelues, then to ouercome our
enemies. And thus ſaith one very excellētly,
If thou wilt haue all things ſubiect
to thee, ſubiect thy ſelfe to reaſon; thou
ſhalt rule many, if reaſon rule thee:Seneca. from
thence thou ſhalt learne, what and how
thou art to take any thing in hand.Iſodo. Kings
and rulers, haue their name from doing
well; therfore by doing well, thou doeſt
hold the name of a ruler; but by ſinning,
thou doſt loſe it: therfore they are rightly
called kings &amp; rulers, who can rightly
rule themſelues and others.Greg: The higheſt
place is well ruled, when he that gouerneth
hath dominion, rather ouer vices,
then ouer his brethrē. Again, it is a good
houſe and well ordered, where the man
ruleth, &amp; the wi
                  •
               e obeyeth: he is a good
man, where the ſpirit ruleth, &amp; the fleſh

ſerueth. Moſt excellent is the ſpeech of
his Maieſtie to his gratious ſonne, of famous
memorie, ſaying; That hee is not
worthie to rule others, that cannot rule
himſelfe. Inordinate affections, more
dangerous and powerfull then the enemies
of the body, thoſe are vanquiſhed
by ſpirituall power: this is the beſt victorie;
and ſuch bee truely noble. Baſe
m
                  •
               n may ſubdue Kingdomes, and themſelues
bond-men of ſinne and Sathan.
He is not worthie to gouerne a Chriſtian
people, that is not a Chriſtian himſelfe;
let ſuch looke for no good ſucceſſe.
Againe, Princes are tyed to God
in a double bond; Firſt, in that they are
men; Secondly, in that they are Rulers
of men: In pietie and thankfulnes they
are to goe before others. The highnes
of their place aggrauateth their fault:
Their glorie is to ſhine before others.
He is better (ſaith Salomon) that ruleth
his owne minde, then he that winneth a
Citie. Such as winne Cities, ſpoyleth
and deſtroyeth: He that ruleth himſelfe,
doeth hurt and ſpoyle no man; he is at
warre with none but with his owne

wicked nature.Pro. 16. 12. It is abhomination to
Kings to commit wickedneſſe; for their
throne is ſtabliſhed by iuſtice. The greater
that men are, the more grieuous, horrible
and loathſome are their ſinnes.Hoſe. 4. 7. As
they were increaſed (ſayeth the Prophet)
they rebelled againſt mee; therefore
I will change their glorie into
ſhame. Againe, they are poore, they
are fooliſh;Ier. 5. 4. 5. &amp;c. for they know not the way
of the Lord, nor the iudgement of their
God. I will get me to the great men,
and will ſpeake to them; for they haue
knowne the way of the Lord, and the
iudgement of their God: but thoſe
haue altogether broken the yoke and
burſt the bonds; wherefore a Lion out
of the forreſt ſhall ſlay them. Theſe
are moſt vnkinde to God, who doe thus
requite his kindneſſe, for their great
preferments and dignities. Magiſtrates
of all others muſt bee vnrebukeable, the
eyes of all are vpon them: A ſpot or
a mote in the ſun is ſooneſt ſpyed: their
good example doth much good; if they
fall, others follow; they leade others to
hell. It is a ſtaine to their place, to their

dignitie &amp; titles, to be ſtained or tainted
with any groſſe ſinne: They are called
gods; and therefore they muſt bee like
God in hating ſin; they muſt be like God
in holineſſe &amp; righteouſnes. Rulers muſt
out go the people, not in pleaſure &amp; luſt,
but in temperance, in vertue, &amp; magnanimitie.
It is the ſaying of the heathen;
He is not worthie to gouerne, that is no
better, neither hath moe vertues then
they which he gouernes: they are to be
firſt doers of that which they command:
they muſt leade the way to vertue, and
practiſe that which they command. It is
written of Lycurgus, that he ſet downe
no law, whereof hee himſelfe had not
ſhewed an example and practiſe in his
owne perſon. Ageſelaus would be the
firſt doer of that he commanded others
to do. Sinnes of great men are examples
&amp; priuiledges to others: whatſoeuer they
do, they ſeeme to command. As a great
branch cut from a tree, bringeth downe
many ſmall ones with it: And as when a
great Prince cōmeth forth of his palace, a
multitude follow him: ſo doe ſubiects
ordinarily follow the examples of their
gouernours good or bad: yea the affection,

in ſubiects to pleaſe Princes, and to
immitate their actions, is of more force
then lawes &amp; puniſhments: And therefore
true is that ſaying of a heathen man;
That Magiſtrates, in matters of wickedneſſe
and vice, doe not onely conceiue
it, but ſpread it, and as it were, water
their ſubiects with it. And againe, wilt
thou haue thy ſubiects good? bee thou
good: The Prince by well doing teacheth
the ſubiects to do well. Examples
of Princes neuer reſt where they begin,
but doe breake foorth, and ſcatter farre
and neere, the world noteth their words
and deedes; neither can they be hidde
more then the beames in the ſunne.
Good Rulers are to puniſh all ſinnes in
others; and how can they do this, if they
be guiltie of the ſame, or of greater, or
more grieuous ſinnes? And what a
a ſhame is it to be called Rulers and gouernours,
and yet to be ſeruants and
ſlaues to ſinne? yea, to as many ſinnes as
doe rule and raigne in them? Diogines
had wont to ſay, that harlots were
as Rulers, and Queenes to Kings; becauſe
they might commaund what they

would; and that they would denie nothing
to them as they did to their ſubiects.
Of this there is example in Herod,
who graunted to Herodias,Mat. 14. a wanton
dauncing Damſell, halfe of his kingdome.
Rulers are often carried away
with the conceit of their dignitie, as
though they had a priuiledge to doe as
they liſt; and they haue flatterers about
them, which will ſoothe them, and ſet
them on in this conceit. Monſtrous was
the ſaying of the Stepmother of Anthonie
Caracalla; for when hee was ſo bewitched
with her beautie, that hee deſired
to marry her, and ſighed and ſayd,
O ſi liceret, O that it were lawfull: She
ſhamefully anſwered, Si libet lice
                     •
                  : If
thou liſt it is lawfull: for Princes doe
giue lawes, and not receiue lawes. A
moſt vntrue ſpeech in things concerning
the law of nature; as well confeſſed
Dioniſius, when his mother would haue
maried otherwiſe then became her age:
ſaying, Oh mother, the ciuill lawes of
man may bee changed and altered, but
the law of nature cannot bee changed.
Herodotus writeth; That Cambiſes,

King of Perſia, coueting to marry with
his ſiſter, asked his Counſellers whether
there were any law to permit the brother
to marry with the ſiſter. They anſwered,
after deliberation, that they
could finde no ſuch law; but they found
a law, whereby it was permitted to the
King of Perſia to doe what he liſted. A
moſt wicked anſwer, when the queſtion
was of the law of nature. Oh vild flatterers
and pernitious paraſites, the very
bane and poyſon of Kings and Rulers.
It is ſinne and wicked affections, which
are as rebels and traytors, which Chriſtian
Rulers are firſt of all to ſubdue in
themſelues. Hoc opus hic labor eſt: This is
the greateſt worke, the greateſt labour,
cunning, victorie &amp; conqueſt. Sampſon
ouercame many of the cruell &amp; mightie
Philiſtims; yet was hee ouercome by filthie
luſt. Alexander conquered a great
part of the world; but yet he could not
conquer nor tame his owne drunkennes,
luſt and anger. Hercules ouercame and
tamed many monſters; but at laſt hee
became a ſeruant and ſlaue to Omphala:
of whom one writeth thus: Hercules

(ſayth hee) famous for his vertue, and
counted as it were a god amongſt the
gods: but he defiled the world with filthie
luſts and vncleanneſſe. How could
there bee any diuine thing in him, that
was a ſeruant to his owne vices? and
thoſe things which hee did are not to be
counted diuine vertues: for what great
matter was it to ouercome a Lion or a
Beare, to kill wilde and fierce Horſes
with their rider?Lactant. lib. pri. inſtit. Chap. 9. Theſe are the works
of a ſtrong man, yet of a man; and thoſe
things which hee ouercame were fraile
and mortall, and may bee ouerthrowne
by the ſtrength of man: But to ouercome
the minde, to ſuppreſſe wrath, it
is the part of the mightieſt man, which
he did not neyther could doe. He that
doeth this, I doe not onely compare him
with the chiefeſt and beſt men, but alſo
I account him moſt like to God himſelfe:
And hee onely is to bee iudged
a mightie man, who is temperate, moderate
and iuſt. Wherefore let Rulers
remember this golden ſentence,
proceeding from a golden mouth, ſaying;
Hee that hath greate power

ouer many things, let him firſt purge his
owne conſcience; and thoſe ſinnes
which hee puniſheth in others,Chry. in 
                     〈◊〉
                  . let him
not commit himſelfe; and let him auoid
that which he puniſheth: for it is a fooliſh
thing when any would rule others,
and yet cannot rule themſelues. And let
them further know, that their authoritie
is no diſpenſation for ſinne; and that
God hath puniſhed great perſons for
ſuch faults as might ſeeme but ſmall in
our eyes; As you may ſee in the examples
of Elie and Dauid: and alſo in the
example of Heſekiah: God did grieuouſlie
puniſh them, the one for pampring
his children, the other for numbring
the people; and the third, for ſhewing
his treaſures to the Ambaſſadours of
Babilon. Let all Gouernours be of Nebemiah
his minde, who when hee was
perſwaded to flie, he anſwered; Should
ſuch a man as I flie? Let euery Magiſtrate,
when hee hath any motion to ſin,
ſay thus; Should ſuch a man as I, that
am a gouernour to others, that am in
Gods place, that ſhould be an example
to others in all goodneſſe, that ſhould

reproue and puniſh ſinne in all: ſhould I
commit ſinne? ſhould I blaſph
                  •
               me the
name of God? ſhould I prophane his S
                  •
               
               both?
ſhould I be proud, or couetous?
ſhould I giue my ſelfe to wh
                  •
               redome
and drunkennes, or to any ſuch grieuous
ſinne? What a diſhonour will this
be to God? What a diſeredit to my place
and calling? and how offenſiue to the
people? h
                  •
               w ſhould I rule others, if I
cannot rule my ſelfe? And finally, let thē
know, that the greatnes and excellencie
of the Magiſtrate, muſt be accompanied
with the excellencie of vertue, and with
good example. And as the Magiſtrate is
firſt to begin with himſelfe, &amp; firſt looke
to his owne heart and waies, ſo alſo he
muſt haue a ſpeciall regard and care of
all that are vnder him, in his priuate familie.
It is not enough that he au
                  •
               yde all
kind of ſinne and wickednes himſelfe,
and that he himſelfe leade a good, godly,
and righteous life in the ſight of God
and men, but alſo muſt haue a ſpeciall
care, that his whole familie, his wife, his
children and ſeruants, doe the like. For
they are his ſpeciall cure &amp; charge committed
to him of God, to be ruled and

gouerned by him according to the rule
of his lawes, and therefore worthie is
that ſaying, For all that are vnder thee,
and ſubiect to thee in thy houſe,Aug: thou
ſhalt giue an account vnto God: and
therefore the Lord directeth the fourth
commandement to the father, maiſter,
and houſeholder whatſoeuer, Inioyning
not only himſelfe to ſanctifie his Saboth,
but that all that belong and appertaine
vnto him, and are within his
doores, doe ſanctifie the Saboth with
him; he is not onely himſelfe to come
to the holy aſſemblies, to heare, to pray,
to receiue with the congregation, and
both openly and priuately to be occupied
the whole day in religious exerciſes,
but it is a charge layed vpon him by
the Lord, that he cauſe his whole familie
to doe the like: And if this be required
of euery priuate man, and of euery
Chriſtian houſeholder whatſoeuer, be
he neuer of ſo meane and baſe eſtate,
how much more is it required of the
publike Magiſtrate? God ſpeaketh thus
to his people Iſrael,D
                     •
                  u: ſaying, Theſe words
which I command thee this day, ſhall
be in thy heart, and thou ſhalt rehearſe

them continually vnto thy children, and
ſhall talke of them when thou tarrieſt
in the houſe, and as thou walkeſt by the
way, and when thou lyeſt downe, and
when thou riſeſt vp. This is a generall
commandement to all Gods people
whatſoeuer, and much more to the Magiſtrate:
this dutie of houſehold gouernment
is moſt ancient, commended and
commanded of God. Euery Chriſtian
houſeholder is to be as a King, Prieſt,
and Prophet, in his owne houſe; As a
King to rule, as a Prieſt to pray, and as a
Prophet to teach. Their care muſt be,
that the wiſe be the ſpouſe of Chriſt,
their ſeruants to be Gods ſeruants, their
children the children of God. Moſt are
carefull to ſee their owne buſines and
workes followed▪ &amp; in no caſe neglected,
&amp; why ſhould they not be as carefull
to ſee the workes of God &amp; his ſeruice
&amp; buſines duly performed in their
families? They carefully prouide for all
neceſſarie proui
                  •
               iō for the maintenāce of
their bodies: &amp; ſo farre goeth an Infidel;
and the like care they haue alſo of their
beaſtes, but Chriſtians muſt goe further,
and ſee that the ſoules of their families

be fed and prouided for; and ſo they
ſhall find much fruit and profit to themſelues,
for this is the way and meanes,
to make painefull, faithfull, and conſcionable
ſeruants: and alſo by this
meanes, true religion is continued to
our poſteritie; whereas if we faile in this
dutie, religion may decay and die with
vs, for any thing that we doe. For the
continuance and propagation of it, moſt
are carefull, ſpecially great perſons, men
of power and wealth, that their names,
riches, and houſes, may continue if they
could for euer. And ſhall not we haue as
great a care, for the preſeruation and
continuance of Gods true worſhip and
ſeruice, to the ages to come? To moue
vs to this dutie, let Magiſtrates and others

                  〈◊〉
                ſet before their eies, the
examples of holy &amp; worthie mē in ſcripture,
how 
                  〈◊〉
                they were in teaching
and 
                  〈…〉
                their families.Gen: 4 Our firſt

                  〈…〉
                Adam had a 
                  〈◊〉
                of this, and therfore
he taught his two ſonnes, how to
ſacrifice to the true God.Gen▪ 18. 19. Abraham is
commended of God, and he promiſeth
to bleſſe him for it, becauſe he commanded
his ſo
                  •
               nes and his houſehold after

him, that they keepe the way of the Lord
to do righteouſnes and iudgement. Iacob
ſaid to his houſeholde,Gen: 35. and to all
that were with him, Put away the ſtrāge
gods that are among you, and change
your garments. After the example of
Iacob, let others cleanſe their houſes, as
of Idolls, ſo of ignorance, of prophanes,
of bl
                  •
               ſphemie, of filthie ſpeaking, and of
all vncleannes and wickednes. For theſe
and ſuch like, doe infect, pollute, and defile,
both houſes and kingdomes.Ioſh: 24. 15. And
let euery one ſay with good Ioſhua, I
and my houſe will ſerue the Lord. And
as Hannah gaue her ſonne Samuel to
the Lord, ſo let euery one giue and dedicate
their families to God. And as Iob
euery day ſanctified his ſonnes, by praying
to God for them, ſo let euery one
ſanctifie themſelues and their whole familie
by good inſtructions, and ſweete
prayrs to God.Pſ: 101. 1. 2. 3. &amp;c. The example of Dauid
is moſt worthie to be imitated of all,
and eſpecially of Magiſtrates, he profeſſeth
his care both in ruling himſelfe
and his familie, the whole Church and
kingdome; he profeſſeth his pietie to
God, the vprightnes of his owne heart,

and the wiſedome that he had in diſcerning
and ſeparating the good from the
euill, both in his 
                  •
               wne houſe and countrey:
Hee will ſuffer no wicked perſon
in his houſe: hee will reforme both
Church and Common-wealth: he will
not bee partaker of other mens ſinnes,
nor ſuffer the blood of them to cleaue
to his ſoule. Worthie alſo is the example
of Cornelius, a Captaine, yet a deuout
man; one that feared God with all
his houſehold; and he had ſouldiers fearing
God:Act. 10. 2. 33. And ſending for Peter for
further inſtruction; when he was come,
he ſayde, that both hee and all his were
there preſent before God, to heare all
things from the mouth of Peter, that
was commaunded him of God. I will
alledge but one example more, of two
houſeholders, the man and the woman▪
perſons of no greate account in the
world; but yet religious, and religiouſly
gouerning their houſehold: 
                  〈◊〉
               
meane Aquila and Preſilla: Aquila the
husband a Tent-maker, Preſilla his wife:
Saint Paul ſayeth of them;Rom. 16. 3. 5. Greete Preſilla
and Aquila, my fellow helpers in
Chriſt Ieſus: likewiſe greet the Church

that is in their houſe.Act. 18. 24. 25. 26. It is ſayd of theſe
two in another place; That they taught
Apollos, a learned and eloquent man,
yet they taught him the way of God
more perfectly then he knew before. S.
Paul confeſſeth they were helpers to him
in the Lord, and that they had a Church
in their houſe. His meaning is, that in
their houſe there was ſuch inſtruction,
reading, hearing, prayer, conference,
and other diuine exerciſes, that their
houſehold was as a little Church. If theſe
poore and priuate perſons had ſuch religious
care of their familie; how carefull
ought Gouernours and Magiſtrates
to bee for the gouernment of their families,
which are to bee directions and examples
to others? One example more
I muſt needes ayme and poynt at, I cannot
auoid it; it lieth in the text; &amp; that is
the example of Salomon, commended
vn to vs by this woman; as in this verse
ſhee commendeth the gouernment of
his kingdome; ſo in the former verſe ſhe
admireth and magnifieth the gouernmēt
of his houſe; ſhe ſaw ſuch good order
amongſt his ſeruants, ſuch diuine &amp; wiſe
inſtructions by Salomō, that ſhe burſteth
out into theſe words; Happy are thy

men, happie are theſe thy ſeruants which
ſtand euer before thee, and heare thy
wiſedome; his houſe was ſo wiſely gouerned,
that ſhe accoūteth them bleſſed
who dwell and liue vnder his gouernment:
but vnhappie are many ſeruants
and children, who haue cauſe to curſe
both parents and maiſters, who by their
follie, careleſnes and bad example, doe
leade them to hell, and to euerlaſting
deſtruction. The Courts of Princes, and
great mens houſes, they ſhould not be
ſinkes of ſinne, nor yet cages of follie
and vncleannes, but they ſhould be patternes
of pietie, of wiſedome, and religion,
of temperance, and all other vertues;
patternes I ſay to the inferior ſort,
whoſe cies are vpon them, and are readie
to follow them in good or euill. That
which the Apoſtle applieth to the miniſter,
that may be applied alſo to the Magiſtrate;
he ſaith, that the Miniſter muſt
be one that can rule his owne houſe
honeſtly, hauing children vnder obedience
with all honeſtie; for if any cannot
rule his owne houſe, how ſhall he care
for the Church of God?
         
         
            
            THE SEVENTH
SERMON.
            
               VERSE 9.
               
                  And made thee King to doe equity and righteouſneſſe.
               
            
            
               IT is the duety and part of good
Gouernours, (as wee haue heard
already) to begin firſt with themſelues,
to iudge and rule their owne affections
and wayes, and then alſo ſo to gouerne
their families, that they be as lights
and lanthornes to others, ſhining before
them in religion, in piety, in all honeſty
and good conuerſation. This is ſome part
of the duty of good Rulers, but this is not
all; It is not enough that he rule himſelfe
and his houſhold, that hee performe theſe
common duties of Chriſtianity, which are
required in all other priuate perſons, but
hee hath a greater and a more publicke
charge, as the gouernement of Townes,

Cit
                  •
               ies, or Countries, hee muſt faithfully
and wiſely diſcharge his publicke place &amp;
calling, which is laid vpon him. It is not
ſufficient that the Magiſtrate doe reproue
publicke diſorders, and lament for them,
as priuate perſons may doe; but alſo hee
muſt puniſh and reforme all publike abuſes,
ſo farre as it lieth in his power. Many
Phyloſophers haue written of the ſtates
of Kingdomes, how they may be happily
gouerned, and flouriſh in this world: Amongſt
ſundry men there are ſundry
iudgements, ſome hold, that the ſafety &amp;
felicity of gouernment conſiſteth in this,
that the Gouernours ſerue the time: Others,
that they bee in league with other
Princes and Kingdomes: Others, that
they be well furniſhed with money, with
Armour, with men. But this Queene repoſeth
the ſafety of Salomons▪
                Kingdome
in Iudgement, in Iuſtice, in Equity and
Righteouſneſſe. And herein Salomon himſelfe
is iuſt of her minde,Pro. 14. 34. ſaying; Iustice
exalteth a Nation, but ſinne is aſhame to the
people. Againe, a King by iudgement maintaineth
a Countrey, but a man receiuing gifts,
deſtroyeth it. That which Auguſtine ſpeaketh
truly of the ſtate of a Chriſtian Emperours
felicity, may be as well ſpoken of

the felicity of Kings, Princes, Rulers and
Gouernours;Aug. de Ciu. Dei. lib. 5. cap. 6. We Chriſtians doe not ſay
that Chriſtian Emperours are happy, ſaith
he, becauſe they haue a long reigne, or
dye leauing their ſonnes in quiet poſſeſſion
of their Empires, or haue beene euer
victorious or powerfull againſt all their
oppoſers: theſe are but gifts and ſolacies
of this laborious, ioyleſſe life; Idolaters,
and ſuch as belong not to God (as theſe
Emperours do) may enioy them, becauſe
God in his mercy will not haue theſe that
know him, to beleeue that ſuch things are
the beſt goods he giueth; but happy they
are (ſay we) if they reigne iuſtly, free from
being puffed vp with the glozing exaltations
of their attendance, or cringes of
their ſubiects, that they know thēſelues to
bee but men, and remember that if they
make their power their Trumpeter to divulge
the true adoration of Gods Maieſty,
if they loue, feare and honour him, if
they long the moſt for that Empire, where
they need not to haue partners, if they be
ſlacke to auenge, quicke to forgiue, if
they vſe correction for the publike good,
and not for priuate hate, if their pardons
promiſe not liberty of offending, but indeed
onely hope of reformation, if they

counterpoiſe their inforced acts of ſeuerity,
with the like weight of bounty and
clemency, if their luſts be the leſſer, becauſe
they haue the larger licence, if they
deſire to rule their owne affects, rather
then others eſtates, if they doe all things
not for glory, but for charity; And withall,
and before all, giue God the due ſacrifice of
prayer for their imperfections: Such Chriſtian
Emperours we call happy, here in hope,
and hereafter, when the time we looke for commeth,
indeed. O happy and thriſe happy are
ſuch Kings and Gouernours that bee thus
qualified; and they are (no doubt) a great
bleſſing to the people that haue them, and
enioy ſo happy a gouernment vnder them.
By that which hath beene ſaid, and by the
words of this Text, we learne that Rulers
do reigne not for themſelues, not for their
owne gaine, profite, and pleaſure, but for
the good of others, for the common benefite
of the Church &amp; Common-wealth.
As the head careth for the body, the
ſheepheard for the ſheepe, the father for
the children: ſo muſt Magiſtrates chiefly
be carefull for the common good of their
people. The Heathen could ſay that wee
are not borne for our ſelues, but for our
Countrey and for others. If this be required

in euery priuate perſon, to ſeeke the
common good of others ſo farre as they
may, how much more is it required of
Kings, Magiſtrates and Miniſters, who are
not priuate, but publicke perſons? As the
Candle ſpendeth it ſelfe for the comfort
&amp; directions of others, and as a tree bringeth
forth fruit, not for her ſelfe, but for
others: ſo Magiſtrates and Miniſters are
to ſpend themſelues, to employ their
wits, their ſtudy, their labour, and care for
the common benefite of the Church and
Common-wealth.Eſay 56. 11. The Prophet complaineth
of the Gouernours in his time, that
they all looke to their owne way, euery
one for his aduantage and for his owne
purpoſe: And the Apoſtle complaineth,
that all ſought their owne,
               Phil. 2. 2. 
               and not that which
is Ieſus Chriſts. But of himſelfe, and of his
faithfull Miniſters,2. Cor. 4. he ſaith; We preach not
our ſelues, but Chriſt Ieſus the Lord, and our
ſelues your ſeruants for Ieſus his ſake. And he
ſaith further,1. Cor. 11. 28. that he himſelfe was combred
daily with the care of all Churches. And in another
place,2. Cor. 1. 7▪ 15. 
               I ſeeke not yours, but you, and
I will moſt gladly beſtow, and will bee beſtowed
for your cauſe This ſhould be the care and
reſolution of euery good Miniſter and
Magiſtrate. The King of Sodom ſaid to

               Abraham, Giue mee the perſons, and take the
goods thy ſelfe. This King preferreth his
people before all worldly ſubſtance. The
office of good Gouernours is for the
common good, benefite and commodity
of all their ſubiects, to comfort and countenance
the godly, to reſtraine and puniſh
the wicked, and this is to doe equity and
iudgement; And for this end and purpoſe
God hath choſen, called, ordained and
placed them in his throne, and this they
muſt doe, and will doe, if they bee placed
in loue ouer the people, and as a bleſſing
to them. The Heathen haue taught, that
Magiſtrates are ordained to liue and
ſerue,Plutarke. not for themſelues, but for their ſubiects,
one of thē ſaith, that Princes are the
ſeruants of God, ordained to take care for
men, and to prouide for their preſeruation,
either by miniſtring to them of their
goods, or by defending them. Another,
that they muſt ſo maintaine the commodity
of the people,Plato. that euery their action
without reſpect of their owne priuate
profit, haue reſpect thereto; and that they
tend to the preſeruation of the whole body
of the people, and that they ſeeke not
ſo to maintaine one part, that they forſake
the other.Cicero. Againe, the end of Goueruernours▪
               
ſhould aime at the proſperous
life of their ſubiects, becauſe (as Zenophon
ſaith) they bee choſen, not to liue at
eaſe, and daintily, but that they which
haue choſen them, may by their induſtry
liue quietly and happily.Ariſto
                     •
                  l And further,
herein (ſaith one) reſteth a difference betweene
a King and a Tyrant; that the Tyrant
ſeeketh his owne profite, but the
King ſeeketh the profite and commodity
of his ſubiects. Theſe be the worthy ſayings
and ſentences of Heathen men,
which may be iuſtly alledged and applied
to the ſhame and condemnation of many
Chriſtian Rulers, who in ruling, ſeeke
onely (or at leaſt chiefly) their owne eaſe
and priuate gaine; and haue little or no
regard to the common good. This is not
to doe iudgement and iuſtice, this is not
to doe equity and righteouſneſſe: for
theſe, or any of theſe, taken in a large
ſence, do cōprehend the whole duety of a
Magiſtrate, according to the rule of Gods
word. The Lord complaining of corrupt
Rulers,Eſay. 5. 7▪
                he ſaith, that he looked for iudgement,
but behold oppreſſion; for righteouſnes, but behold
a crying. And in another place he ſaith;
Let iudgement run downe as waters,
               Amos. 5. 24. 
               and righteouſneſſe
as a mighty riuer. Righteouſneſſe

and Iuſtice doth containe all vertues in
them:Amb. de Offi. Righteouſneſſe (ſaith one) doth
more profite others then it ſelfe, doth
neglect her owne profites, preferring the
common good, giuing to euery one that
which is right, and this righteouſneſſe is
firſt to God, ſecondly to our Countrey.
And another ſaith,Seneca. whoſoeuer thou art,
that deſireſt righteouſneſſe, firſt feare
God, and loue him, that thou mayſt bee
loued of him; thou ſhalt loue God, if
thou follow him in this, that thou art willing
to doe good to all, and hurt to none.
The righteouſneſſe of a King is the peace
of his people,Ciprian. the ſafety of his Countrey,
the comfort of the poore, the calmneſſe of
the ſea, the temperature of the aire, the
fruitfulneſſe of the earth, the heritage of
children, and to himſelfe the hope of future
bleſſedneſſe.Aug. Another doth moſt excellently
ſet out the duty of Princes and
Rulers in theſe words; The Iuſtice of a
King is, that hee doe not wrongfully oppreſſe
any man by his power, that hee
iudge betweene man and man without
acceptance of perſons, that hee bee a
defence to the ſtranger, fatherleſſe and
widdow, that hee ſuppreſſe theft, puniſh
adultery, exalt not the wicked, mainetaine

no quarrellers, nor laciſciuious
perſons; roote out the peruerſe, permit
no murtherers, nor periured perſons to
liue; that he vphold the Church, feed the
poore, eſtabliſh iuſt men in publicke
Offices, retaine ancient, wiſe, and diſcreet
Counſellers; that in any wiſe hee apply
not himſelfe, to the ſuperſtition of Deuiners,
Magitians, and Pithonicall Spirits;
that hee deferre his diſpleaſure, and defend
his Country from his enemies with
Magnaminity and Iuſtice, that hee repoſe
his whole confidence in God, that he bee
not puft vp in proſperity, and with patitience
to beare aduerſity; that he mainetaine
the Catholicke Faith, and ſuffer not
any wickedneſſe in his children; that hee
allot certaine howers to prayers to God,
and eate not but in due ſeaſon (for woe to
thee ô Land where thy Gouernours riſe
earely to eate) the performing of theſe
things doe bring proſperity in this life,
and doth leade the King to a better Dominion,
euen to a Celeſtiall and eternall
Kingdome: ſuch Iuſtice and Righteouſneſſe
in good Rulers is the ſafety of the
people, and doth prolong and defend the
State, and is the ſtrongeſt Guard and the

                  ••
               ſt Phyſition for the fafe-gard and health

of a Land. Onely there is a Common-wealth
(ſaith Scipio) onely there is a good
ſtate of a Comminalty, where Iuſtice and
Honeſty hath free execution, whether it
bee by King, by Nobles, or by the whole
People: but when the King becomes vniuſt,
the Nobles become vniuſt, and the
people themſelues become vniuſt: then
it is not a vicious Common-wealth, but
it is iuſt no Common-wealth at all, and
that as in inſtruments that go with ſtrings
or winde, or as in voyces conſorted,
there is one certaine proportion of diſcrepant
notes vnder one harmony, the
leaſt alteration whereof is harſh in the
eare of the ſkilfull hearer, and that this
concord doth conſiſt of a number of
contrary ſounds, and yet all combined
into one perfect Muſicke or Melody; ſo in
a Citty that is gouerned by reaſon, of all
the higheſt, meane, and loweſt eſtates; as
of ſoundes, there is one true concord
made, out of diſcord and natures, and
that which is harmony in muſicke is vnity
in a Citty: This is the firmeſt and ſureſt
bond of ſafety to the Common-wealth,
which can neuer ſtand without equity,
and iuſtice; and iniuſtice is the decay and
ouerthrow of Townes, Citties, and Kingdomes.

Now that Equity and Iuſtice
may flouriſh in the Common-wealth,
three things are neceſſarily required;
Firſt, there muſt bee Lawes: Secondly,
there muſt be Iudges and Officers: thirdly,
there muſt be execution of Lawes.
            Now Law is defined to bee a conſtant
and perpetuall good thing, without
which no Houſe, no Citty, no Country,
no ſtate of men, no naturall creature, not
the world it ſelfe can conſiſt firme and
ſtable. Chriſippus cals it a knowledge of
all Diuine and Humae matters, commanding
equity, and expulſing wickedneſſe
and wrong:Polid. There bee three kind of
Lawes;
                  Ʋirg. lib. 2. chap. 1. one Naturall, that is not onely
appropriated to man, but alſo it concerneth
all other liuing things, either in
Earth, Sea, or Aire; as we perceiue all liuing
creatures naturally haue certaine
familiarity of male and female for procreation
of Iſſue, and a procliuity to nouriſh
the ſame, the which proceedeth of a
Naturall Law, ingraffed in thē by Nature
it ſelfe, that is God. The ſecond is named
the Law that all men vſe, which is called
Ius Gentium, the Law of Nations, generally
vſed through the world, as to ſhew a
man the way to communicate to men, the

commodity of the Elements as Water
and Fire, to this appertaineth the Law of
Armes. The third kind of Law is called
the Ciuill Law, that is the priuate Law of
euery Country or Citty, as of the Romanes,
Lacedemonians, Athenians, this
conſiſteth in Decrees of Princes, Statutes,
and Proclamations; Such Lawes
Ceres made firſt, or as ſome thinke Radamanthus,
and afterward others in diuers
Countries, deuiſed and ordained Lawes,
as in Athens, Draco, and Solon; in Egypt,
Mercury; in Creet, Minos; in Lacedemony,
Lycurgus; in Tire, Tharandes; in Argoes,
Phorones; in Rome, Romulus; in Italy, Pythagoras,
or as ſome thinke the Arcadies,
that were vnder Leuander, as their Soueraigne
Lord and chiefe Captaine. Notwithſtanding
the true Authour of Lawes
was God, which firſt planted in vs the
Law of Nature, and in proceſſe of time,
when that was corrupted by Adam and
his Poſterity, hee gaue by Moſes the
Law written, to reduce vs againe to
our firſt ſtate. Lawes muſt bee knowne,
and they muſt bee agreeing to the Lawes
of God, and Nature. The end of Lawes
the publicke good and ſafety of all, which
conſiſteth in the worſhip of God, in honeſty

and righteouſneſſe; ſuch Lawes are
to forbid and to reſtraine, falſe worſhip,
Idolatry, and prophaneſſe, diſobedience,
murther, adultery, theft, and all wickedneſſe,
ſuch Lawes muſt be common to all,
there muſt be no priuiledge, no immunity,
no impunity, the greateſt and the
higheſt muſt be ſubiect to ſuch lawes, and
bee willing to performe them, as well as
the meaneſt, for ſuch Lawes are more
neceſſary then the walles in a Citty,
which are for beauty and defence; but a
Citty may ſtand without wals, it cannot
ſtand without Lawes, ſuch good Lawes
of equity and righteouſneſſe, they are
the very Life and Soule of a Citty or
Kingdome. To Lawes there muſt bee
ioyned of neceſſſity. Iudges and Officers,
which giue vigour and life to Lawes, the
Office of theſe is to doe Iudgement and
Iuſtice; that is, to know Cauſes and then
to pronounce ſentence accordingly, that
ſo euery man may haue right, this is properly
Gods Office, they are in his place, &amp;
therefore to deale vprightly: Worthy is
that counſell of Moſes to the Iudges in
his time,Deut. 1. 16. 17. ſaying: Heare the controuerſies
betweene you brethren, and iudge righteouſly
betweene euery man and his brother, and the

ſtranger that is with him; yee ſhall haue no reſpect
of perſons in iudgement, but ſhall heare
the ſmall as well as the great, yee ſhall not
feare the face of Man, for the Iudgement
is GODS. The like counſell giueth
good King Iehoſaphat to his Iudges:
ſaying;2. Chron. 19. 6. 7. 
               Take heed what yee doe, for yee execute
not the iudgements of man, but of the
Lord, and hee will bee with you in the cauſe
and iudgement: Wherefore now let the feare of
the Lord be vpon you, take heed and do it, for
there is no iniquity with the Lord our God,
neither reſpect of perſones nor receiuing
rewards. And remember that counſells
Conſider the matter, conſult and giue ſentence:
Iudgement muſt proceed from the light
of reaſon, and not from Paſſion, both
parties muſt be heard, euery one muſt
haue freedome to ſpeake, that there may
bee true and vpright iudgement; the corruptions
of Iuſtice are theſe, negligence,
and want of ſkill, vnneceſſarie, and vniuſt
delaies, deſire of gaine, reſpect of
friends and kindred, fooliſh pitty, and
ſometimes ſlauiſh feare; but all theſe and
ſuch like hinderances of Iuſtice, good
Magiſtrates muſt auoide and caſt off. To
Lawes and Iudgement there muſt be added
Execution, for what are Lawes without

of Execution, but euen like bels without
clappers. Lawes are like vnto young
children and Infants, which are left deſolate
without parents, and yet haue portion
and patrimony, but would ſoone conſume
it, or others would deceiue them of
it, except they haue faithfull Tutors and
Guardians to guide and protect them; ſo
haue Lawes need of faithfull Patrones
and Keepers, or elſe they will bee brought
into contempt, by the forgetfulneſſe,
negligence, and corruption of ſome, and
the malice of others. For what better is
it to haue Law-makers, and faithfull Intepreters
of the ſame, except they bee
carefully kept and defended. Therefore
due puniſhments to offenders, are to bee
iuſtly and rightly executed. To this purpoſe,
ſaith Salomon;
               Pr. 20. 8. 
               A King that ſitteth on
the throne of Iudgement chaſeth away all
euill with his eyes.
               Verſe 26. Againe, A wiſe King
ſcattereth the wicked, and cauſeth the wheele
to turne ouer them. And in another place;
Take the droſſe from the ſiluer, and there ſhall
proceed a veſſell for the finer;
               Prou. 25. 4▪ 5. 
               take away the
wicked from the King, and his Throne ſhall
bee ſtabliſhed in righteouſneſſe. The Apoſtle
ſaith:Rom. 13. 4. 
               If thou do euill, fear; for hee beareth
not the ſword for nought, for hee is the Miniſter

of God to take vengeance of him that
doth euill. This is one ſpeciall end of the
Magiſtrates calling, to puniſh, to reſtraine,
and repreſſe the wicked. The Magiſtrate
is a miniſter of Iuſtice and Law,
the iudgements is the Lords and not his;
the impunity of the wicked is hurtfull to
themſelues, by this meanes they runne
into further ſinne, and they do encourage
others to do the like; it were better to
turne looſe, wilde Boares, Beares, and
Woulues, amongſt the people, then ſuch
peſtilent men, by the puniſhment of ſuch,
the Common-wealth and the Church, is
freed from the note of infamy, and it is
no ſmall honour to God. And by this, many
others are terrified from ſinne, and are
brought to repentance, and ſo to ſaluation;
yea, the danger of infection is remoued
and taken away: a little leuen
ſowreth the whole lumpe, and a few wicked
men do much hurt, in drawing, ſeducing,
and infecting others; yea, by ſuch
execution of Iuſtice, the wrath of God
&amp; his heauy iudgements vpon a Land, are
ſtayed &amp; remoued.Ioſh. 7. 1. 26. When Achan was put
to death, for taking the excommunicate
thing, which was commanded to bee deſtroyed,
when hee (I ſay) was ſtoned to

death, then the Lord turned frō his fierce
wrath, which before was kindled againſt
his people: The Prophet Dauid ſaith
thus of the people of Iſrael:Pſ. 106. 28. 29. 30. 31. 
               That they
ioyned themſelues vnto Baal Peor, and did
eate the offrings of the dead; thus they prouoked
him to anger with their owne inuentions,
and the plague brake in vpon them, but Phinies
ſtood vp and executed iudgement,
               Num. 25. 
               and
the plague was ſtaied, and it was imputed to
him for righteouſneſſe, from generation to generation
for euer.
               Iona. 1. When diſobedient Ionas
is caſt out of the Ship, ſtormes and
tempeſts ceaſe: the ſea is quiet, the Ship
and thoſe that are in it are ſafe. Magiſtrates
do puniſh, becauſe God by theſe
examples will bee knowne to bee a God
who deſcernes betwixt things vniuſt and
iuſt, and is iuſtly angry with ſinne, and
becauſe hee would haue theſe momentary
puniſhments vpon few to forewarne
all of iudgements to come, and
of eternall puniſhments; and by this
meanes alſo hee prouideth for the commodity
of others, for the wicked are taken
away, ſo that they can hurt no more.
And this part of Iuſtice is for the credite
and honour of the Magiſtrate. Therefore
ſaith Salomon, Hee that ſaith to the

wicked thou art righteous;
               Prou. 24. 24. 25. 
               him ſhall the people
curſe, and the multitude ſhall abhorre
him; but to them that rebuke him ſhall be pleaſure,
               Prou. 28. 45. 
               and vpon them ſhall come the bleſſing of
goodneſſe. Againe, They that forſake the
Law, raiſe the wicked; but they that keepe
the Law ſet themſelues againſt them: Wicked
men vnderſtand not iudgement, but they that
ſeeke the Lord vnderſtand all things.
Againe, This Iuſtice is a ſweete ſacrifice
pleaſing to God, it is the Magiſtrates ſacrifice,
               Pr. 21. 3. 
               it is more acceptable then other ſacrifices.
Therefore ſaith the wiſe man, To do
iudgement and iuſtice is more acceptable to
the Lord then ſacrifice: And the Lord ſaith
thus to hypocrites,Amos 5. 21. 22. 23. 24. that abounded in ſacrifices,
but neglecting Iuſtice: I hate and
abhorre your feaſt daies, and I will not ſmell
in your ſolemne aſſemblies; though you offer
mee burnt offerings and meate offrings, I will
not accept them, neither will I regard the
peace offrings of your fat beaſts, take thou
away from me the multitude of thy ſongs, for I
will not heare the melody of thy Viols, and let
iudgements runne downe as waters. And in
another place to ſuch hypocrites as
abounded with plenty of ſacrifices, it is
ſaid:Mica. 8. 6. 7. 8. 
               He hath ſhewed thee, ô man, what is
good, and what the Lord hath required of

thee; ſurely to do iuſtly, to loue mercy, to humble
thy ſelfe, and to walke with thy God. By
this Iuſtice the ſtates of Citties and
Kingdomes are preſerued and eſtabliſhed.
Therefore Dauid exhorteth his ſon
Salomon,
               1. King. 2. 3. 
               To walke in the Waies Statutes and
Iudgements of God; that ſo hee might
proſper in all things he went about.Ier. 22. 15. &amp;c. The
Lord by Ieremy declaring how happy Ioſiah
the father had bene, and how curſed
Iehoiakim the ſonne ſhould bee, and why
the one did ſpeed ſo well, and the other
ſo badly, ſaith: Shalt thou raigne becauſe
thou cloſeſt thy ſelfe in Cedar? Did not thy
father eate and drinke and proſper, when hee
executed Iudgement and Iuſtice? when hee
iudged the cauſe of the afflicted and the poore
hee proſpered: was not this becauſe hee knew
mee ſaith the Lord; but thine eies and thy
heart are onely for thy couetouſneſſe: And
therefore the Lord threatneth in the next
wordes to deſtroy him. This iuſtice
is profitable to the whole Common-wealth,
Deu. 21. 21. both to the good and the bad.
Therefore the Lord commanding the
rebellious ſonne to bee put to death; So,
(ſaith hee) thou ſhalt take away the euill
from among you, that all Iſrael may heare it
and feare. Where Iuſtice is neglected ſin

raigneth:Eccl. 8. 11. 
               Becauſe ſentence againſt an euill
worke (ſaith the Wiſe-man) is not executed
ſpeedily, therefore the heart of the children of
men is fully ſet in them to doe euill. On the
contrary it muſt follow, that where there
is true execution of Iuſtice, there the
hearts of men are drawne and terrified
from euill.Prou. 20. 30. 
               The blewneſſe of the wound
ſerueth to purge the euill, and the ſtripes within
the bowels of the belly.
               Pro. 26. 3. Againe, To the
Horſe belongeth a whip, to the Aſſe a bridle,
and arod to a Fooles backe: His meaning is,
that by ſuch ſharpe correction fooliſh
men are ſtayed and kept in order. And
in another place;Prou. 19. 25. 
               Smite a ſcorner, and the
fooliſh will beware: Meaning that ſimple
and ignorant men will bee warned when
they ſee the wicked puniſhed, they will
take heed by others mens harmes.Prou. 19. 29. 
               And
the Lord hath ordained iudgements for the
ſcorners, and ſtripes for the backe of fooles. To
this duty of Iuſtice the example of God,
may incite and moue all Chriſtian Magiſtrates,
they are in his ſteed, and therefore
are to follow his example in puniſhing
offenders: Hee is a moſt iuſt and ſeuere
Iudge, and a very conſuming fire
againſt ſinne and wickedneſſe:Pſa. 5. 4. 5. 
               Hee is a
God that loueth not wickedneſſe, neither ſhall

euill dwell with him, the fooliſh ſhall not
ſtand in his ſight, hee hateth all them that
worke iniquity.
               Pſal. 11. 5. 6. Againe, The Lord will try
the righteous, but the wicked and him that
loueth iniquity doth his ſoule hate: vpon
the wicked hee ſhall raigne ſnares, fire, and
brimſtone, ſtorme and tempeſt, this is the portion
of their cup. And in another place,
Surely God will wound the head of his enemies,
               Pſal. 68. 21. 
               and the hairy pate of him that walketh
in his ſinnes. Moſt fearefull examples of
his iuſtice and iudgement wee haue vpon
the firſt world,1. Cor. 10. 5. 6. 7▪
                vpon Sodom and Gomorrah,
yea vpon his owne people Iſrael.
What kind of offenders, wee ought to
puniſh more ſeuerely, wee may haue direction
from the Law of God, that thoſe
whom hee appointed to die ſhould not
bee ſpared, for wee muſt not make our
ſelues more mercifull then God is himſelfe;
wilfull murther is death by the
Law of Princes, and it is death by the
Law of God. Yea, before the Law written,
Gen 9. 6. it was ſaid to Noah: Who ſo ſheddeth
mans bloud, by man ſhall his bloud bee ſhed,
for in the Image of God hath hee made him.
And in the Law Written,Leui. 24. He that killeth
any man hee ſhall bee put to death. And
Adultery alſo is death by the Written

Law of God.Leui. 20. 10. 
               The man that committeth adultery
with another mans wife, becauſe hee
hath committed Adultery with his neighbours
wife,
               Deut. 22. 22. 
               the Adulterer and the Adultereſſe ſhall
die the death. Theft was not ſo ſeuerely puniſhed,
but they were to make reſtitution,
and reſtore foure-fold that which
they had ſtolne: Theft, in our age, is more
ſeuerely puniſhed, it is certaine that
Theft is a grieuous ſinne againſt the Law
of God, againſt Equity and Iuſtice; but I
ſee no reaſon, why the Theefe ſhall dye a
ſhamefull death, and the Whore-maiſter
eſcape with leſſer puniſhment, ſeeing
that Salomon compareth the Theefe and
the Whore-maiſter together, &amp; ſheweth
in diuers reſpects that Adultery is a greater
and more grieuous ſinne then Theft,
becauſe the Theefe may make reſtitution,
Pro. 6. 27. 30. 32. and ſo can neuer the other. This is the
corruption of Nature, that men make
more account of money and goods, then
of religion or honeſty, and Adulterers
being ſpared, and left aliue many queſtions
are rayſed and propounded, which
can hardly bee anſwered; Namely, whether
the innocent party, or nocent party
may marry, whether they may be reconciled
againe or no. Let the Adulterer and

Adultereſſe, according to the Morall
Law of God, die the death, and then
theſe queſtions will bee idle and ſuperfluous.
And as Magiſtrates may puniſh
Murtherers, by the ſame reaſon they may
as well puniſh Heretickes, Idolatours,
falſe Prophets, for indeed theſe they
murther mens ſoules, they runne a whoring
from God, and they rob him of his
honor. We heard partly before, that falſe
Prophets and Idolatours, were to die the
death, and wee haue examples of good
Kings and Rulers, which haue put ſuch
to death; and if the Magiſtrate bee the
keeper of both the Tables, then hee is to
puniſh the tranſgreſſion of the one as
well as the other; and if the tranſgreſſions
of the firſt Table, bee more hainous
and grieuous then the tranſgreſſions of
the ſecond Table, there is no reaſon why
they ſhould bee leſſe, and more ſlightly
puniſhed. Moſes ſaid to the children of
Iſrael, after they had worſhipped the
golden Calfe; Thus ſaith the Lord God of
Iſrael,
               Ex
                     •
                  . 3
                     •
                  . 27. 28. 29. 
               put euery man his ſword to his ſide, go
to and fro from gate to gate through the
Host, and ſ
                     •
                  ay euery man his brother, and euery
man his companion, and euery man his
neighbour: ſo the Children of Leuic did as
               
Moſes had commanded, and there fell of the
people the ſame day about three thouſand
men: For Moſes had ſaid, conſecrate your
hands vnto the Lord this day, euen euery man
vpon his ſonne, and vpon his brother, that
there may bee giuen you a bleſſing this day.
Iehu ſlew all the Prieſts of Baal,
               2. King. 10. 25. 26. 27. burnt
their Images, deſtroyed the image of
Baal, and threw downe the houſe of
Baal, and made it an houſe of all filthineſſe
and vncleaneſſe.2. King. 22. &amp;c. 
               Ioſiah putteth
downe the Idols, killeth the Prieſts, the
Chemerimes, hee burneth the groues,
brake downe the houſe of the Sodomites,
hee defaced the High places, hee tooke
away them that had familiar Spirits, and
other abhominations, and compelled all
that were found in Iſrael to ſerue the
Lord. The like power hath all Chriſtian
Kings, Princes, and Gouernours, in
their owne Kingdomes and Dominions.
The Prophet Prophecieth of the latter
times,Zach. 13. 2. 3. ſaying as from the Lord: I will cut
off the names of the Idols out of the Land,
and they ſhall no more bee remembred: And I
will cauſe the Prophets and vncleane Spirits,
to depart out of the Land, &amp; when any ſhal yet
Propheſie, his father and his mother that begat
him ſhall ſay vnto him, Thou ſhalt not liue,

for thou ſpeakeſt lyes in the name of the Lord.
And his father and mother that begot him,
ſhall thruſt him through when he propheſieth.
He ſpeaketh of the time of the Goſpell,
wherein people ſhall haue ſuch zeale,
that they cannot abide nor endure a
falſe Prophet. Chriſtian Gouernours
haue power from God to compell and
drawe men to the outward worſhip and
ſeruice of God:Aug. ad Ʋincen. Therefore ſaith Auguſtine,
when men are mad, they miſlike
force and chaſticement; but when they
come to their right minde, they are glad
that they are corrected for their good
&amp; recouery. Not euery one that ſpareth,
is a friend; nor euery one that ſmiteth, an
enemy: Better are the wounds of a friend,
then the kiſſes of an enemy. It is better to loue
with ſeuerity, then to deceiue with too
much lenity. He that bindeth a mad man,
and hee that raiſeth him vp that is in a
deadly ſleepe, he is troubleſome to both,
but he loueth both. God doth not onely
teach, but puniſh. Let heretickes firſt
bee ouer-throwne and confuted; if that
will not ſerue, vſe religious ſeuerity. The
ſame Father ſaith; firſt I was of this mind,
that none were to be compelled to the vnity
of Chriſt, that men were to be dealt

withall by the word, by diſputation, by
reaſon, leaſt thoſe which we knew to bee
open Heretickes, ſhould become feigned
Catholickes: but this my opinion was ouercome
by examples before mine eyes;
for this my Citty Hippo, being altogether
of Donatus ſide, was conuerted to the Catholicke
vnity, by the feare of Emperiall
Lawes. Princes and Gouernours are in
no caſe to ſuffer any hereticall or falſe
worſhip in their kingdomes. And therefore
let them hearken to this counſell, giuen
them by a learned man: Let Princes
(ſaith he) take heed, how they ſuffer any
wicked rites and ceremonies to Infidels,
within their Dominions. Salomon was
guilty of this fault, not that he compelled
any of his ſubiects to worſhip Idols, but
that he granted to his Wiues and Concubines,
being out-landiſh women, places
and altars, wherein they might worſhip
ſtrange Gods. But God was angry with
him, and requited him according to his
fall: for as he diuided Gods worſhip, ſo
God diuides his kingdome, giuing part of
it to his ſonne, and part of it to Ieroboam.
This fault of his did ſpread it ſelfe to the
poſterity: for Achas, Manaſſes, and diuers
other wicked Kings, had diuers wicked

and deteſtable worſhips at Ieruſalem,
and were ſharply reproued of the Prophets
for them: And ſurely the Magiſtrate
cannot be but reproued and condemned,
when he ſuffereth Idolatry, ſeeing he hath
the ſword for the puniſhment of wickedneſſe;
therefore it muſt be granted, that
either Idolatry is no ſinne, or elſe the Magiſtrate
is to puniſh it as well as other
ſinnes. The Magiſtrate muſt bee carefull
to defend the Common-wealth, and to
prouide as much as may be, that no danger
nor hurt come vnto it. But Idolatry is
the cauſe of famine, peſtilence, warres,
and other moſt grieuous iudgements, and
therefore in no caſe to be ſuffered, or tollerated
in a Chriſtian kingdome, and all
ſuch tranſgreſſors of the firſt and ſecond
Commandement, and of the reſt of the
Commandements of the firſt table, are to
bee puniſhed, as well as the tranſgreſſors
of the Commandements of the ſecond
Table; and indeed falſe Prophets, heretickes,
Idolaters, Papiſts, Ieſuites, Seminarie
Priſts, do more hurt to a kingdome
then murtherers, adulterers, or theeues,
ſeducing, killing &amp; poyſoning the ſoules
of many thouſands; neither is it to bee
counted cruelty to cut off theſe and ſuch

like offendors, ſeeing it is warranted by
the authority and commandement of
God himſelfe: It is not cruelty to cut off
the cruell, though they account it ſo; but
hee that ſmiteth and taketh away the euill,
in that they are euill, is the Miniſter of
God, and of the Law; therefore the Magiſtrates
doe not defile themſelues with
bloud, in puniſhing and executing wicked
perſons: for they haue a warrant from
the Lord ſo to do, the Lord is with them,
and doth aſſiſt them; and ſuch executions
of notorious perſons, by the hand of the
Magiſtrate, is as a ſacrifice pleaſing to
God. And leaſt it ſhould be a trouble to
the Magiſtrates minde, or a corſie to his
conſcience, or any impairing to his credit
to deale ſo ſeuerely as may be thought
with ſuch offendors; the Lord himſelfe
doth comfort and encourage the Magiſtrate;
for whereas he commandeth, that
wicked children curſing their parents,
ſhall dye the death; and likewiſe adulterers,
and other offendors, he addeth and
repeateth it often to the comfort of the
Magiſtrate, His bloud be vpon him; as if he
ſhould ſay, let not Iudges and Magiſtrates
trouble themſelues at the death of
ſuch offendors, as though they were

guilty of their bloud: nay, their bloud is
vpon themſelues, they are guilty of their
owne bloud, they haue deſerued death,
and are worthy of it; they haue caſt away
themſelues, and haue iuſtly drawne vpon
themſelues ſuch grieuous puniſhments,
by their owne wickedneſſe and iuſt deſerts.
It is my commandement and will
that ſuch ſhall dye, and therefore I cleare
you as innocent and guiltleſſe; you are in
my place, you are my ſeruants and miniſters,
and in this work of iuſtice you haue
done me faithfull ſeruice. But here may
be a queſtion propounded, whether Princes
and Rulers may not remit and pardon
the faults of great offendors. To remit
iuſt puniſhments is againſt the direct law
of God, and procureth and draweth the
wrath of God vpon the Magiſtrate.Deut. 27. 19. 
               Curſed
be he that hindereth the right of the ſtranger,
the fatherleſſe and the widow, and all the
people ſhall ſay,
               Leuit. 19. 15. 
               So be it. Againe, You ſhal not
doe vniuſtly in iudgement, but thou ſhalt iudge
thy neighbour iuſtly.
               Ier. 21. 12. The Prophet ſaith, O
houſe of Dauid, execute iudgement in the
morning, and deliuer the oppreſſed out of the
hand of the oppreſſour, least my wrath goe out
like fire, and burne, that none can quench it,
becauſe of the wickedneſſe of your workes.
               
The Magiſtrate is the keeper of Iuſtice
he is to do right to euery one, and therefore
hee may not realeaſe whom hee liſt.
To execute iudgement is a good worke, it
is profitable to the Common-wealth, it
decaieth and taketh away ſin; and therefore
not to be hindered or ſtopt of any. It
is a ſpeciall part of the office of a Magiſtrate,
to puniſh the offendors, and therefore
he is iuſtly, without partiality, to performe
it. Iuſt iudgement is the Lords, &amp;
not his, and therefore not in his power to
remit it; he is the Miniſter of the lawes, &amp;
therefore to do nothing contrary to law.
When Themiſtocles was requeſted of Simonides
the Poet, to pronounce a certaine
vniuſt ſentence, in his fauour; he anſwered
vertuouſly: As making verſes contrary
to the Rules of poetry, thou canſt bee
no good Poet: ſo can I bee no good
Prince, if I giue ſentence contrary to law.
Solon ſaid, that the ſafety of the Common-wealth
conſiſteth in theſe two points, that
rewards be diſtributed after the deſert of
vertue, and puniſhments after the quality
of the offence. Iuſtice (ſaith one) knoweth
not father, knoweth not mother, but
knoweth the truth; accepteth no perſon,
but followeth God. God is a iuſt Iudge

againſt wicked perſons, and if any do ſtay
Iuſtice and Iudgement through bribes or
rewards, their ſinne and corruption is the
greater; and a Iudge may be aſhamed to
ſay to any offender, What wilt thou giue
me to ſhew thee fauour, or doe thee Iuſtice?
Is not this as if it ſhould bee ſaid;
What wilt thou giue me to deny my ſelfe,
to looſe my Office, and to ſell God himſelfe?
There bee three things (ſaith one)
which hinder Iuſtice; the fauour of
friends, flattering praiſe, and receiuing of
rewards. But this latter is of greater force
then the two other. There may be cauſes,
why puniſhments may be delayed, or
leſſened: ſome offenders are greater then
others, and are ring-leaders to wickedneſſe:
theſe deſerue more ſharpe puniſhment.
Others are ſeduced, and fall by occaſion:
theſe are more mildly to be dealt
withall. But the inferiour Magiſtrates can
do nothing in ſuch caſes, without the direction
and counſell of the ſuperiour. As
there be differences of offenders and offences,
ſo there be differences of lawes againſt
the which they doe offend. Some
lawes haue their ground &amp; warrant from
the law of God and Nature: to the tranſgreſſers
of theſe, there ſhould bee

granted no fauour or remiſſion. There be
other poſitiue written lawes of the countrey,
concerning leſſer and ſmaller matters:
in theſe the Magiſtrates haue power
ſometimes vpon good occaſion, to remit
and pardon; ſo that it be not againſt the
glory of God. To this agreeth the words
of his Maieſty to his gracious ſonne:
There be ſome horrible crimes (ſaith he)
not to be pardoned, as Witch-craft, wilfull
murther, inceſt, poyfoning, falſe
coine; and ſo hee concludeth, that fauour
is to be ſhewed in leſſer matters, and ſpecially
in ſuch as concerne our owne priuate
cauſes. But ſee here the corruption
of our nature, we are more ſeuere in our
owne cauſes, then in Gods cauſe: wee
ſtriue and contend, and make a ſtirre for
our riches, poſſeſſions, glory and credite,
if any goe about to diminiſh and impaire
them, how violent, cruell and implacable
are we? But if it be the cauſe of God, how
modeſt, how gentle and milde are we? Is
not this to preferre our ſelues before
God? The children of Iſrael, contrary to
Gods commandement,Iudg. 2. ſuffer the Cananites
and the Moabitiſh women to liue.
Saul ſpareth Agag,
               Num. 25 and the remnant of Amalecke.
               1. Sam. 15
And another King of Iſrael ſpareth

               Benhadad contrary to Gods commandement.
And thus men are willing to
ſpare where God would not haue ſpared,
and where they ſhould bee moſt patient
and kinde, there they are cruell: Whereas
in our own cauſes we ought to be patient
and mercifull; but as for the cauſe and
glory of God, we are to be in it moſt zealous
and ſeuere. And there bee ſome offenders,
whom the Lord will haue cut off
in all ſeuerity, without any fauour, pitty
or compaſſion.Exod. 17. 14. 16. He ſaith of Amalecke; I
will vtterly put out the remembrance of Amalecke
from vnder heauen. Yea the Lord
ſware, that he would haue a warre with Amalecke
from generation to generation. And
he chargeth his people Iſrael, that when
they had reſt from their enemies,Deut. 25. 17. 18. 19. and poſſeſſed
the good Land hee had promiſed
them, that then they ſhould not forget to
execute theſe his iudgements on thoſe
people, and roote them quite out. The
reaſon why God did ſo hate and purſue
this people, was their hard and cruell dealing
againſt the children of Iſrael; and
therefore long after, when Saul was King,
hee giueth him this charge,1. Sam. 15. 3. ſaying; Goe
and ſmite Amalecke, and deſtroy all that pertaines
vnto them, and haue no compaſſion on

them, but ſlay both man and woman, both infant
and ſuckling, both Oxen and ſheepe, both
Cammell and Aſſe. But Saul vpon a fooliſh
pitty ſpared Agag the King, and ſome
of the fatteſt beaſts: but the Lord did not
ſpare him, but thruſt him out of his kingdome
for his diſobedience. And Samuel
ſaid to Agag:
               
                  Ʋerſ. 33. 
               As thy ſword hath made women
childl
                     •
                  ſſe, ſo ſhal thy mother be childleſſe amōg
other women. And Samuel (being a Iudge)
hewed Agag in peeces before the Lord in Gilgall.
Ahab a King, ſpared another King,
whom God would not haue ſpared; but
the Lord ſaid to him:1. King. 20. 42. 
               Becauſe thou haſt let
goe out of thy hands a man whom I appointed
to dye, thy life ſhall goe for his life, and thy people
for his people. Theſe be fearefull examples
for Kings and Princes, that they take
warning by them, how they ſpare any vpō
any ſiniſter reſpect, whom God in his iuſt
iudgement would haue ſmitten with the
ſtroke of death: and this is no cruelty to
follow the example and commandement
of God himſelfe. Hee ſaith to a wicked
and rebellious people;Deut. 32 41. 42. 
               If I whet my glistering
ſword, and my hand take hold on iudgement,
I will execute vengeance on mine enemies,
and will reward them that hate mee. I
will make mine arrowes drunke with bloud,

and my ſword ſhall eate fleſh, for the bloud of
the ſlaine, and the captiues, when I begin to
take vengeance of the enemy. And the people
pray thus to God againſt the ſeede of
Eſau, becauſe they conſpired with the Babylonians,
Remember (ſay they) the children
of Edom, ô Lord, in the day of Ieruſalem,
which ſaid, Raze it to the foundation thereof.
O daughter of Babel, worthy to bee deſtroyed,
bleſſed ſhall he be that rewardeth thee, as thou
haſt ſerued vs. Bleſſed ſhall he bee that taketh
and daſheth thy children againſt the ſtones. No
pitty nor mercy is to bee ſhewed to ſuch
as bee ſworne enemies to the Church
and their owne Countrey, to bloudy
Babylonians, groſſe Idolaters. And yet
as there muſt bee vpright iuſtice in all
good Magiſtrates, ſo to this alſo there
muſt bee ioyned clemency and mercy;
there is vſe and place of both, and Iuſtice
and Mercy both of them may bee abuſed;
but true Mercy and Clemency
is an excellent vertue to all Chriſtian
Princes and Gouernours. They are in the
place of God, who is full and rich in mercy
and compaſſion, and whoſe mercie is
ouer all his workes; they are to follow,
the example and nature of God, whoſe
Image they repreſent and carry; they gouerne

and rule, not beaſts, but men; and
therefore all humanity is to bee vſed towards
them, they are to puniſh with
griefe and compaſſion.
            A Phyſition giueth to a patient, his
friend, ſome bitter potion, which hee
could bee content in loue to caſt away;
but onely that hee knoweth, that
it will bee for the good and health of his
friend. And thus Magiſtrates are to
thinke of puniſhments, as of medicines,
whereby the guilty may be amended, and
others by their examples terrified. When
the guilty is to be condemned, the Magiſtrate
is to thinke thus with himſelfe;
This puniſhment this party hath deſerued,
and God hath decreed it for him, and
therefore it is for his good: It is cruelty to
delight in the puniſhment and torment of
others,Iudg. 1. 7 as that King did, who had ſeuenty
Kings, the Thumbes of their hands and
feet cut off, gathering bread vnder his
table. This cruelty is againſt the nature of
God, and it is a vice, not of a man, but of
a wilde beaſt. It is cruelty alſo to bee exceſſiue,
and too much rigorous in puniſhing
tranſgreſſors, and therefore it is ſaid;
If ſo be the wicked be worthy to bee beaten,
               Deut. 25 
               the
Iudge ſhall cauſe him to lye downe, and to bee

beaten before his face, according to his treſpaſſe,
to a certaine number. Where there is
mercy and diſcretion, there puniſhments
are according to the treſpaſſes: But it is
cruelty, for ſmall faults and offences, to
enioyne extreme, ſeuere, and rigorous
puniſhments; and it is the greateſt cruelty
of all, to puniſh in body or goods, ſuch
as haue not deſerued it, and ſuch as are
honeſt and innocent. Therefore Magiſtrates
muſt remember, that not onely he
that iuſtifieth the wicked, but he alſo that
condemneth the iuſt,Pro. 17. 15. euen they both are
an abhomination to the Lord. This proceedeth
from cruelty and raſhneſſe; and it
is contrary to loue, mercy, and iuſtice, and
it is againſt the end and the calling of the
Magiſtrate, who is ordained, not only for
the puniſhment of euill doers, but for the
praiſe of them that doe well, he is to be a
defence, a protection, a ſuccour &amp; cōfort
to ſuch. Nay, God himſelfe doth profeſſe,
that hee is a father and protector to ſuch,
and ſaith;Exo. 23. 7 
               Thou ſhalt not ſlay the innocent and
the righteous.
               Pro. 17. 26. 
               Surely it is not good (ſaith Salomon)
to condemne the iuſt, nor that Princes
ſhould ſmite ſuch for equity. Righteous men
are Gods children, ſeruants, and members,
deare and pretious in his eyes: hee

ſaith of them; Hee that toucheth you, toucheth
the apple of mine eye. It is a grieuous
ſinne, and a ſigne of reprobation, to hate
or perſecute the ſeruants of God: therefore
Cain hateth Abel, Eſau hateth Iacob,
and ſeeketh to kill him, Iſmael perſecuteth
and mocketh Iſaac, Saul hateth &amp; purſueth
Dauid. It is comfort and credit euen
to Princes, to haue the loue and the teſtimony
of the faithfull.
            This is the commendation of Demetrius,
               3. Iohn.
that hee had good report of all men,
and of truth it ſelfe; yea the Apoſtles
themſelues bare record of him. The complaints
and cryes of Gods ſeruants will
bee hard and heauy againſt their perſecuters:
Yee ſhall not (ſaith God) trouble any
widdow,
               Exod. 22. 22. 23. 24. 
               nor fatherleſſe childe: If thou vexe or
trouble ſuch, and ſo hee call and cry vnto me, I
will ſurely heare his cry; then ſhall my wrath
bee kindled, and I will kill you with the ſword,
and your wiues ſhall bee widdowes, and your
children fatherleſſe. As God hath a ſpeciall
care of widdowes and fatherleſſe children,
ſo hee hath a care of all his ſonnes
and daughters, hee will regard their iuſt
complaints, which they offer into his
boſome, and in time will hearken to their
cryes. It is a ſin not to encourage, countenance

and defend ſuch; but it is a greater
ſinne to ſpoyle them, and vndo them,
or to offer them any wrong. He will reproue
Kings for their ſakes,Pſa. 105. ſaying, Touch
not mine annointed, and doe my Prophets no
harme. Kings are the Lords annoynted
in a ſpeciall reſpect; but yet all the people
of God are alſo in their place, the
Lords annointed, becauſe of the oyle of
ſpirituall graces, plentifully powred vpon
them; and becauſe they are precious
and deare in the eyes of God. And therefore
the Lord ſaid to Pharaoh;
               Exo. 4. 22 23. 
               Iſraell is
my ſonne, euen my firſt borne, wherefore I ſay
to thee, let my ſonne goe, that hee may ſerue
mee: If thou refuſe to let him goe, behold I
will ſlay thy ſonne, euen thy ſirſt borne.
            
            Marke (ſaith a learned Father vpon
that place) marke the Title that God giueth
to his Church, and meditate on it
earneſtly, hee calleth it his Sonne, yea
his firſt borne, noting therein to all fleſh,
that it is to him, as a man-childe to the
father, yea as the the firſt borne, which
commonly is loued moſt tenderly,Babin. in Exod. and
in greateſt honour. Now then thinke
with your ſelfe, what hurt is in you to the
fruite of your body, and to your firſt
borne, thinke how you could endure to

ſtand and looke vpon the abuſe offered
by any, to the whole, or any part, as to
ſee but a legge, or an arme cut off by
bloudy butchers: then thinke of God
to his Church, and euery part of it,
whoſe affection ſo much excelleth yours,
as God excelleth man, and holineſſe and
perfection, miſery ſinne and corruption.
And a little after: Tell Pharaoh hee
had beſt take heede what hee doth: for I
will make his Sonne and firſt borne feele it,
if hee hinder mine, and will not let them goe
to ſerue mee. The world you know, contemneth
and deſpiſeth vs, counting vs
the Refuſe of the people, or what may
bee baſe and vile; but this loue is life, and
this regard with God is honour moſt
high: In the comfort whereof wee may
ſuppe vp theſe earthly ſcornes, if his
Grace bee with vs. And ſo much the
rather wee may doe this, becauſe hee
accounteth all the reproches, iniuries,
ſtormes and hard dealings done to his
ſeruants, as done vnto himſelfe. And
therefore there came a voyce from heauen
to Saul, then a Perſecuter, but after,
Paul a Preacher; that voyce ſayd
then vnto him:Acts: 9. 4 5. 
               Saul, Saul, Why perſecutest
thou mee? And when hee ſayd; Who

art thou Lord? The Lord ſaid; I am IESVS
whom thou perſecuteſt; It is hard for thee
to kicke againſt prickes. Chriſt was then aſcended
into heauen, Saul did not, neither
could if he would, perſecute him, but becauſe
hee perſecuted his poore members
on earth, Chriſt taketh their cauſe to bee
his owne, and he counteth the cruelty offered
to them, to be offered to himſelfe.
All good Princes and Gouernours euen
in pollicy, as much as may be, are to ſeeke
and procure the good will, loue and liking
of all their ſubiects; and much more
of the better ſort. Rulers are ſo to gouerne
the people, as the ſoule gouerneth the body,
and as God gouerneth the world; that
is, not onely iuſtly, but alſo kindly and
gently. In God there is not onely power,
iuſtice and wiſdome, but alſo he is full
of goodneſſe and mercy Paſtors &amp; ſheapheards
are not only with diſcretiō, but alſo
with lenity, to lead &amp; guid their flocke.
A good father doth bring vp and rule his
children in as much loue and kindneſſe as
may be. A good ruler muſt be of the ſame
mind to the people, as the good father of
a family is to the houſhold. And what is a
ruler of a City, or a kingdome, but the father
of many childrē, he is not to abate his

authority by too much lenity, nor the
peoples loue by too much ſeuerity.
Hearts of honeſt men are gotten by mercy,
kindneſſe and goodneſſe, ſo they wiſh
well, and ſpeake well; and they deſire the
continuance and increaſe of their Rulers
aduancement.
            There bee three things (ſaith Auguſtine)
in a Gouernour. Firſt, a Calling: Secondly,
a feare of him: Thirdly, a loue
towards him. Calling is requiſite, to the
end hee may beare himſelfe chearefully
in a good conſcience; yet if hee bee not
both loued and feared, hee cannot ſubſiſt
in his Calling: Let him therefore aduiſe
himſelfe to procure loue by benefits,
and feare by puniſhing wrong done, not
againſt himſelfe, but againſt the Law.
The Heathen man could ſay, that a
Ruler muſt bee affable in ſpeech, eaſy to
bee ſeene, and ſpoken to, in countenance
amiable, kind to the iuſt, ſharpe to the
wicked. Such a Ruler is beloued, defended,
and reuerenced by the whole Citty;
ſuch a Ruler, by his owne benefite is ſafe,
hath no need of defence, the heartes of
the people are his armour,Seneca. his inuiſible
ſtrength and munition is the loue of the
Cittizens, and what is more pleaſant,

then to liue with the deſire, wiſhing, and
good-will of all men. Who dare ſet
himſelfe againſt ſuch a one, vnder whom
there flouriſheth peace, righteouſneſſe,
ſecurity, dignity; and vnder whom a famous
rich Citty aboundeth with plenty
of all goodmen.Greg. Thoſe which gouerne
the people, if they will haue their Throne
ſurely eſtabliſhed, let their countenance
bee full of cheerefulneſſe and grace, leaſt
being too ſeuere and rigorous, through
arrogancy they procure the hatred of the
people.Chry. in 2. Cor. 7. There is nothing that maketh
him, that hee hath the office of a Magiſtrate,
more then a ſtudy and care of loue
towards his people, for it doth not onely
make a father that hee hath begotten a
child, but alſo that hee loue him after hee
hath begotten him. If Nature hath need
of ſo much loue, how much more Grace?
&amp; thus all the Prophets and Rulers, that
were famous amongſt the Hebrewes, as
Abraham and Moſes, Samuel and Dauid,
haue ſhined and excelled in loue to their
people. Others haue ſaid, that preſeruatiō
of Princes conſiſteth in the integrity of
Religion, &amp; in the loue of their Subiects,
and theſe things procure the loue of the
people: Not to bee too ſtrange to them,

to be humble and courteous, to ſpeake
kindly to them, to bee willing to ſee their
Subiects, and to ſhew themſelues to
them as much as may bee; to heare cauſes
in their owne perſons, not to burthen
the people too much, but to eaſe them of
vnneceſſary burthens; to bee liberall and
bountifull, where there is need and deſert.
Abſolon, though hee was a wicked
man, and had a wicked cauſe, yet he had
this pollicy by kindneſſe to draw the
hearts of the people to him. When any
man came neere to him, and did him obeyſance,
hee put forth his hand, and tooke him
and kiſſed him; and on this manner did Abſolon
to all Iſrael, that came to the King for
iudgement, ſo Abſolon ſtole the hearts of all
the men of Iſrael. This was a wicked action
in him, but this pollicy may bee followed
of lawfull Magiſtrates, by kinde
words and deeds, to winne and hold, the
hearts of their owne people. Good was
that counſell, which the ancient men
gaue to King Rehoboam. If thou bee a ſeruant
to this people (ſay they) this day, and
ſerue them, and anſwere them, and ſpeake
kinde words to them, they will bee thy ſeruants
for euer. They ſhew by this their
counſell, that kindneſſe is the way to

winne the hearts of the people: but that
King forſooke that good counſell, and
hearkened to the counſell of yong men,
and by their direction gaue the people
this anſwere.1. King 12. 6. 7. 14. 16. 19. 
               My father made your yoke
grieuous, and I will make your yoke more grieuous;
my father hath chaſtiſed you with rods,
but I will correct you with ſcourges. And
ſee what followed; When all Iſrael ſaw the
King regarded them not, the people anſwered
the King thus: What portion haue wee in
Dauid, wee haue none inheritance in the ſon
of Iſhai, to your Tents oh Iſrael, now ſee to
thy houſe Dauid, and Iſrael rebelled againſt
the houſe of Dauid vnto this day. This was
wickedneſſe in the people, to riſe and rebell
againſt their King, and a iuſt iudgement
of God: But yet, as the Apoſtle
ſaith to naturall fathers, ſo ſay I to you
that are fathers of the Country; You fathers
prouoke not your children to wrath, by
austerity and hard dealing: Giue no occaſion
to the people, but rather as much as
may bee draw their hearts to you, by humility
and kindneſſe.Nehe. 5. 5. 
               Nehemiah confeſſeth
the poore diſtreſſed people to bee
his brethren, of the ſame fleſh and bloud
with him. Iob proteſteth that hee did not
contemne the iudgement of his ſeruants,

when they did contend with him thinking
themſelues hardly entreated by
him, and then hee hath this in his
thoughts: If I had oppreſſed others, how
ſhould I haue eſcaped Gods Iudgements? What
then ſhall I do when God ſtandeth vp, and
when hee ſhall viſite me, what ſhall I anſwere?
hee that hath made mee in the wombe, hath
hee not made him? hath not hee alone faſhioned
vs in the wombe? This moued him to
pitty, and reſpect his baſeſt ſeruants, becauſe
they were Gods creatures as well
as he. Dauid prayeth for the peace of Ieruſalem,
ſaying; Let them proſper that loue
thee, peace bee within thy Wals, and proſperity
within thy Pallaces; for my brethren and
neighbours ſakes I will wiſh thee now proſperity,
becauſe of the houſe of the Lord our
God, I will procure thee wealth. Hee prayeth
heartily for his Subiects, wiſhing
them the fauour of God and all happineſſe,
and promiſeth to do them what
good hee can, and hee counteth them as
his brethren, neighbours, and companions.
Let all Chriſtian Rulers remember
that ſaying of the Apoſtle:Gal. 3. 28. 
               There is neither
Iew nor Grecian, there is neither bond
nor free, there is neither male nor female, for
yee are all one in Chriſt Ieſus; In the world

there muſt needs bee difference and degrees,
it muſt needs bee ſo, for pollicy
and order, but in Chriſt all are one. For
God is no accepter of perſons, but in
euery Nation hee that feareth him, and
worketh righteouſneſſe is accepted of
him, whether hee bee poore, or rich,
Prince or Subiect.Tindal. Excellent is that counſell
of a Gracious man; let Kings (ſaith
hee) if they had rather bee Chriſtians indeed,
then ſo called, giue themſelues altogether
to the wealth of their Realmes,
after the example of Chriſt, remembring
that the people are Gods, and not theirs;
yea, they are Chriſts inheritance and
poſſeſſion, bought with his bloud; the
moſt deſpiſed perſon in this Realme, is
the Kings brother, and fellow Member
with him in the Kingdome of God and
of Chriſt. Let him therefore not thinke
himſelfe too good to doe them ſeruice,
neither ſeeke any other thing in them,
then a father ſeeketh in his children; yea,
then Chriſt ſought in vs, though that the
King in his regiment bee in the roome of
God, and repreſenteth God himſelfe, and
is, without all compariſon, better then
his Subiects, yet let him put off that, and
become a brother, doing and leauing vndone

all things in reſpect of the Common-wealth,
that all men may ſee, that
hee ſeeketh nothing but the profite of
his Subiects. Worthy is the example of
good Mordechai,
               Eſter chapter 2. chap. 3. ch. 4. who when hee was a
priuate man, yet hee was a faithfull ſubiect
in diſcouering treaſons. Howſoeeuer
proud Hammon, comming of that
curſed ſeed of Agag, informeth the King
of him and the poore Iewes, as though
they were enemies to the State; yet both
hee and they were faithfull both to God
and the King, as it was plainely proued
afterward. At that time, and in that ſtate,
his care was for the Church of God, hee
vſed all meanes, and ventured all danger,
for the helping of Gods people. After
that the enemy of God, and of the
Church, Hammon was cut off, and Gods
people had deliuerance, ſafety and ioy,
then Mordechai his faithfulneſſe being
knowne to the King, then (I ſay) hee was
aduanced to great honour, and behaued
himſelfe as a worthy Ruler, for it is ſaid
that Mordechai the Iew was the ſecond
vnto King Ahaſhueroſh, and great among
the Iewes, and accepted among the multitude
of his brethren, who procured the wealth of
his people, and ſpake peaceably to all his ſeed.
               
Wherein wee are to obſerue three things
neceſſary in good Rulers, firſt to haue the
fauour of the people: ſecondly, to procure
their wealth: and thirdly to bee gentle
and louing to them. This good Ruler
being aduanced, hee doth not forget
himſelfe, hee is not high-minded, hee is
not careleſſe of his place, but imployeth
all his trauell, for the good and preſeruation
of the Church. This care had good
Nehemiah, who though hee was ſafe himſelfe,
and great with the King, yet when
hee heard of the diſtreſſe of his Countrimen,
hee is moued with compaſſion, hee
mourneth, weepeth, and faſteth for them,
hee prayeth heartily to God, hee goeth
to the King for his fauour, and protection,
and vſeth all meanes that hee can,
and endureth many reproches and dangers,
for the comforting of the people,
and for the building of the wals of the
decayed Ieruſalem.
            
            And thus wee ſee, deſcribing the duties
of good Kings and Gouernours, we
ſee (I ſay) the neceſſity, the authority,
the excellency, the bleſſing of good
Kings, &amp; the happineſſe of good gouernment;
by them the wicked, and notorious
tranſgreſſours of the firſt and ſecond Table

are cut downe. Good Subiects are
countenanced, Iuſtice, Peace, Honeſty,
and all vertue is maintained and cheriſhed.
In this gouernement, the Wiſedome,
Juſtice, and Goodneſſe of God, towards
mankind, is moſt cleerely to bee
ſeene. His Wiſedome is declared by order,
which is in deſerning vertues and
vices, and in the Societies of Mankind,
vnder lawfull gouernment, and in
contracts, guided and diſpoſed by meruailous
Wiſedome. The Iuſtice of God
appeareth in Ciuill Gouernment, in that
hee will haue open ſinnes puniſhed by
the Magiſtrate, and when they that are
in authority do not take puniſhment on
offenders, then God himſelfe miraculouſly
draweth them vnto puniſhment,
and proportionably doth lay vpon grieuous
ſinnes, grieuous puniſhments euen
in this life, as it is ſaid; whoſoeuer taketh
the ſword ſhall periſh with the ſword,
and Whore-mongers, and Adulterers
God will iudge. In theſe puniſhments
God will haue to bee ſeene the differences
of vertues and vices, and will haue
vs learne that God is Wiſe, Iuſt, True,
and Chaſte. The goodneſſe of God alſo
towards Man-kind, is ſeene, in that hee

preſerueth the ſociety of men after this
order, and for that cauſe doth hee maintaine
it, that from thence his Church may
bee gathered, and will haue Common-wealthes
to bee places, for
the entertainement of
his Church.

SERMON.
            
               VERSE 9.

               THE Princely Prophet
Dauid, the Predeceſſour
and Father of Salomon,
ſpeaking of the gouernment
of himſelfe, of his
houſhold, and alſo of the
Church and Common-wealth committed
to him from God, hee ſaith on this
manner:Pſa. 101. 1. 
               I will ſing Mercy and Iudgement,
vnto thee ô Lord will I ſing. In which words
hee promiſeth and proteſteth openly to
God, that when hee ſhould place him in
the throne of his kingdome, he would be
in his whole gouernment, both iuſt and
merciful; that is, executing iuſtice and
iudgement againſt the wicked, and ſhewing

all kindneſſe and mercy to the good
and godly. In theſe two words of Iudgement
and Mercy, is compriſed the whole
duety of good Gouernours, they muſt
with Dauid ſtrike vpon theſe two ſtrings,
Iudgement and Mercy, not onely of
Iudgement, but alſo of Mercy; and not
onely of Mercy, but alſo of Iudgment: for
iudgement without mercy is but cruelty,
and mercy without iudgment, is but fooliſh
pitty:Pro. 20. 28. therefore ſaith Salomon: Mercy
and Truth preſerue the King, for his throne
ſhal be ſtabliſhed with mercy. And in another
place,Pro. 29. 9. 14. 
               A King by Iudgement maintaineth a
Countrey. Againe, A King that iudgeth
the poore in truth, his throne ſhall be eſtabliſhed
for euer.
            
            This bleſſed Queene in deſcribing the
office of a King, ioyneth with theſe two
bleſſed Kings, Dauid and Salomon, ſaying;
That God hath placed Salomon in his
Throne to doe Equity and Righteouſneſſe.
Though ſhee doe not name Mercy, yet
no doubt it is included: for this Equity
and Righteouſneſſe doth containe an vpright
gouernment both in pollicy and religion,
a gouernment (I ſay) according
to the rule of Gods law
                  •
               ; puniſhing
the wicked, comforting and defending

the godly. The very proper &amp; principall
obiect of the Magiſtrate are all the
wicked vnder his gouernment. Not that
he is to be careleſſe of the good, for thoſe
that be good themſelues, will haue a care
of thoſe that are good, ſeeing God himſelfe
is carefull of them. And as for the
good, they are ſoone and eaſily ruled: the
greateſt care, trouble and labour is about
the ordering and gouernment of the wicked;
and the remouing, puniſhing, and
ordering of them, is for the defence, comfort,
peace, and good of the godly. As the
head is to defend the body from all wrong
and iniury ſo farre as it may: and as the
ſheapheard is to defend his flocke againſt
Wolues, Foxes, and wilde beaſts, ſo are
good Magiſtrates to defend their people
from all oppreſſours at home and abroade.
And therefore all worthy Kings
and Rulers haue fought in open field againſt
rebels and cruell enemies, in defence
of their ſubiects.Iudg. 3. &amp; 4. &amp; 7. &amp; 11. And thus did Ehud,
Deborah, Barak, Gedeon, Iephtah deliuer
the children of Iſrael out of the
hands of their cruel enemies.
            And thus did Ioſua,
               Ioſu. 6. and the Elders of
Iſrael, and the men of warre, they beſiedged
the Citty of Ai, and deſtroyed it.

And Samſon, a moſt valiant Champion,
hazarded himſelfe, and ventured his life
for the defence of Gods people againſt
the bloudy Philiſtims, and both by his
life, and by his death ſlue many thouſands
of them. And thus Dauid the King, the
valiant Souldier, defended his ſubiects,
the people of Iſrael, from the vncircumciſed
Philiſtims, and other enemies, and
ſlue many thouſands of them in the open
field.2. Chro. 20. And ſo Iehoſhaphat ſet himſelfe againſt
the children of Ammon, Moab, and
mount Seir, which were come againſt Iudah,
and the Lord gaue him a meruailous
victory againſt theſe enemies. This bleſſed
King feared God, and both he and his
ſubiects gaue themſelues firſt to faſting
and prayer, and repentance: and ſo the
Lord bleſſed their Armies againſt their
enemies. It is lawfull for Kings to defend
and maintaine their owne liberties, and
to recouer by warres, that which hath
beene vniuſtly taken away from them.
And as in warres there muſt bee a good
cauſe, and a good affection, if we looke
to ſpeede: ſo the authority and example
of the chiefe Gouernours doth much
encourage the people, and put life into
them.
            
               
And as Rulers are to defend their people
from the force and violence of enemies
abrode: ſo they muſt not ſuffer
them to bee oppreſſed at home by their
owne Countrey-men. And indeed this
is moſt vnnaturall and intollerable, that
one ſubiect ſhould oppreſſe another, that
Chriſtians, Countrey-men, and brethren
ſhould vexe and torment one another by
hard and cruell dealing in the time of the
Goſpell, vnder Chriſtian Gouernours.
            Wee haue not this many yeares (bleſſed
be God) beene much troubled with
violence of forraigne foes, but haue liued
peaceable a long time. And though
our enemies haue ſometimes made attempts
and aſſaults againſt vs, yet the
Lord himſelfe hath fought for vs, to his
great glory, and to the ſhame of our Aduerſaries.
            Our greateſt troubles, exactions, and
oppreſſions are amongſt our ſelues one
with onother. Now this is a ſpeciall part
of the Magiſtrates calling to relieue and
defend the oppreſſed. And he may more
eaſily, and ſooner, with leſſe charge and
danger defend his owne ſubiects, againſt
domeſticall oppreſſours, then ſet himſelfe
in combate againſt mighty, many,

and cruell enemies abrode. Priuate men
may not reuenge their owne wrongs, but
they are in place to doe it for them. It
is their office to relieue the oppreſſed,
and to auenge their cauſe. As a father ouer
his children is both Lord and Iudge,
forbidding that one brother ſhould auenge
himſelfe of another, but if any
cauſe of ſtrife bee betweene them, hee
will haue it brought to himſelfe, or his
Aſſignes, to haue it iudged and corrected:
So God forbiddeth all men to auenge
themſelues, and takes that office into his
owne hand. Therefore ſaith the Apoſtle;
Rom. 12. 19. 
               Dearly beloued, auenge not your ſelues,
but giue place to wrath: For it is written:
Ʋengeance is mine, and I will repay, ſaith
the Lord. But yet in the next Chapter
the ſame Apoſtle ſheweth, that God hath
appointed Princes and Magiſtrates as
reuengers of wrongs: For hee ſaith, that
the Prince is the Miniſter of God for thy
wealth:
               Rom. 13. 4. 
               but if thou doe euill, feare: For hee
beareth not the ſword for naught: for he is the
Miniſter of God, to take vengeance on him
that doth euill. It is almoſt impoſſible that
a manſhould be an equall and indifferent
iudge in his owne cauſe, luſts &amp; appetites
do ſo blind vs. And when thou auengeſt

thy ſelfe, thou makeſt no peace, but ſtirſt
vp more debate. God therfore hath giuen
lawes to all nations, and hath in all countries
placed Kings, Gouernours and Rulers
in his owne ſtead, to rule the world
through them, and hath commanded all
cauſes to bee brought before them; and
they are to determine and iudge of
ſuch cauſes, according to the rules of
equity and righteouſneſſe. This is part
of the counſell which Salomons mother
gaue vnto him:Pro. 31. 8 9. 
               Open thy mouth for the
dumbe in the cauſe of the children of deſtruction:
Open thy mouth, iudge righteouſly, and
iudge the afflicted and the poore.
            
            
               The Prophet ſaith to the Gouernours
of Iſrael:Eſa. 1, 17 Learne to doe well, ſeeke iudgement,
relieue the oppreſſed, iudge the fatherleſſe,
and defend the widdow. Therfore ſuch
as were diſtreſſed, were wont in their diſtreſſe,
to flye to the refuge of the chiefe
Magiſtrate, for their protection and defence.
The Shunamite returning from the
land of the Philiſtims, called vpon the
King for her houſe, and for her land,
which had beene wrongfully taken away
from her,
               2. King. 8 3. 5. 6. 
               and the King ſaid to an officer:
Reſtore thou all that are hers, and all the fruits
of her lands, ſince the day ſhe left her land, euen

till this time. Hee cauſed that to be iuſtly
reſtored, which was wrongfully holden
away from her. And herein good Magiſtrates
ſhould follow the example of God,
and reſemble his Nature, whoſe Name
and Image they carry:
               Pſa. 145 14. The Lord vpholdeth
all that fall, and lifteth vp all that are
ready to fall: Hee executeth iuſtice for the oppreſſed:
which giueth bread to the hungry:
The Lord looſeth the Priſoners:Pſa. 146. 7. 8. 9. the Lord
giueth ſight to the blinde: The Lord raiſeth
vp the crooked the Lord loueth the
righteous: the Lord keepeth the ſtrangers:
hee relieueth the fatherleſſe and widdow, but
hee ouer-throweth the way of the wicked.
Therefore ſaith the Lord,
               Pro. 22. 23. rob not the poore,
becauſe hee is poore: neither oppreſſe the afflicted
in iudgement: for the Lord will defend
their cauſe, and ſpoyle the ſoule of thoſe that
ſpoile them.Pro. 23. 10. 11. 
               Againe hee ſaith, Remoue not
the ancient bounds, and enter not into the
fields of the fatherleſſe; for hee that redeemed
them is mighty, he will defend their cauſe againſt
thee.
            
               When the Children of Iſraell, were
ſore afflicted by Pha
                  •
               aoh,Exod. 3. 7. 8. 9. 
               and the Aegiptians,
the Lord in pitty ſaid: I haue
ſurely ſeene the trouble of my people, which
are in Aegypt, and haue heard their cry,

becauſe of their Taske-maiſters: for I
know their ſorrowes therefore I am come
downe to deliuer them out of the hands of the
Egyptians, &amp;c.
            And afterwards when they were vexed
by ſundry enemies one after another,
though they ſinned againſt him grieuouſly
and ſundry times, yet when they
cryed vnto him in their diſtreſſe and repented
them of their ſinnes, hee heard
their cry, and ſent them Iudges and Deliuerers,
to deliuer them, and eaſe them
of their oppreſſions. Moſt excellent and
worthy, is that worthy ſpeech of that
good Queene Elizabeth, our gracious
Soueraigne of famous memory. A
ſpeech (I ſay) recorded by reuerend
Iewel, in his anſwere to Pope Pius his ſeditious
Bull: Thus ſhee ſpeaketh to the
Councell and Iudges: Haue care of my people,
you haue my place, doe you that which I
ought to doe: They are my people, euery one
oppreſſeth them, and ſpoyleth them, without
mercy; they cannot reuenge their owne quarrels,
nor helpe themſelues. See to them, ſee
to them, they are my charge. I charge you, as
God chargeth mee; I care not for my ſelfe, my
life is not deere to mee, my care is for my people.
O bleſſed and gracious ſpeech beſeeming

a gracious Prince, a patterne of
piety. Wee may obſerue in that ſpeech,
the tender care, pitty, and loue of her
Maieſty, to her diſtreſſed Subiects; and
that in thoſe times, being in the beginning
of her Maieſties raigne about fifty
yeares ago, there were ſundry oppreſſions,
and wrongs in the Land: How
more grieuouſly are they increaſed, and
augmented ſince that time? Citties,
Townes, and Countries, are full of exclamations,
of the cryes, and teares, of
the oppreſſed, and few or none to pitty,
or relieue them. Is not this lamentable
and monſtrous, that one Christian
ſhould vexe, ſpoyle, and oppreſſe another,
being a ſinne againſt nature, reaſon,
and all humanity? yea ſuch a ſinne as the
beſt ſort of the Heathen do deteſt, and
abhorre: The Scripture doth reckon any
kind of oppreſſion, amongſt grieuous
and crying ſinnes. And God himſelfe
doth denounce moſt greiuous and fearefull
iudgements againſt all oppreſſours
whatſoeuer.Iſa. 3. 14. 15. 
               The Lord ſhall enter into
iudgement with the Ancients of his people,
and the Princes thereof: for yee haue eaten vp
the vineyard, the ſpoyle of the poore is in your
houſes. What haue yee to do, that yee beate my

people, and grinde the faces of the poore? ſaith
the Lord,
               Iſa. 5. 8. 9 
               euen the Lord of Hoaſts. And
againe, Woe vnto them that ioyne houſe to
houſe, and lay field to field, till there bee no
place, that yee may bee placed by your ſelues
in the midſt of the earth. This is in mine
eares, ſaith the Lord of Hoasts. Surely many
houſes ſhall bee deſolate, euen great and
faire without inhabitant.
               Iſa. 33. 1. And in another
place: Woe to thee that ſpoyleſt, and waſt not
ſpoyled: and doſt wickedly, and they did not
wickedly againſt thee; when thou ſhalt ceaſe to
ſpoyle, thou ſhalt bee ſpoyled, when thou ſhalt
make an end of doing wickedly, they ſhall doe
wickedly againſt thee.
               Amos 5. 11. Another Prophet
ſaith: Foraſmuch as your treading is vpon the
poore, and yee take from him burdens of
wheate; yee haue built houſes of hewen ſtone,
but yee ſhall not dwell in them: yee haue planted
pleaſant Vine-yards, but yee ſhall not drink
wine of them.
               Micah 2. 1. 2. 3. Another Prophet ſaith: Woe
vnto them that imagine iniquity, and worke
wickedneſſe vpon their beds; when the morning
is light they practiſe it, becauſe their hand
hath power; And they couet fields, and take
them away by violence, and houſes, and take
them away. So they oppreſſe a man and his
houſe, euen a man and his heritage. Therefore
thus ſaith the Lord; behold, againſt this family

haue I deuiſed a plague, where out yee
ſhall not plucke your neckes, and yee ſhall not
go ſo proudly; for this time is euill. And
againe the ſame Prophet ſaith:Micah 3. 1. 2. 3. 4. 
               Heare I
pray you ô heads of Iacob, and yee Princes of
the houſe of Iſrael: Should not yee know
iudgement? but they hate the good, and loue
the euill: they plucke of their skinnes from
them, and their fleſh from their bones: And
they eate alſo the fleſh of my people, and flay of
their skinnes from them, and they breake
their bones. And chop them in peeces as for
the pot, and as fleſh with in the caldron: Then
ſhall they cry vnto the Lord, but hee will not
heare them. Hee will euen hide his face from
them at that time, becauſe they haue done wickedly
in their workes.
               Mica. 6. 9. 10. 11. The ſame Prophet
threatneth the heauy iudgement of
God againſt the Treaſures of wickedneſſe,
againſt the bagge of deceitefull
waights.Hab. 2. The Prophet Habacucke threatneth
as grieuous puniſhments againſt all
cruell oppreſſours, and all ſuch as get
their goods, and raiſe vp their houſes and
eſtates, by wicked and vnlawfull meanes.
All the Prophets, and the whole Scriptures,
is full of curſings and threatnings
againſt all kind of oppreſſours. So that
their ſtate muſt needes bee fearefull and

damnable which liue and die in ſuch a
caſe. Our God is a God of truth and
mercy, the Law of God is Equity and
Righteouſneſſe, and the Lawes of the
Land (wee doubt not) are grounded vpon
Reaſon and Iuſtice; and they were
made to this end, that euery man might
haue his own, that all good Subiects may
be releiued, and defended, againſt-wrong
and iniury, againſt the violence and deceite
of men. Now good Magiſtrates
muſt ſee good Lawes executed, for the
reliefe of diſtreſſed people. And that ye
may the better bee ſtirred vp to performe
this duty: Let mee ſet before you two
worthy patternes and examples of good
Magiſtrates. The one is the example of
Iob who ſpeaketh thus of himſelfe.Iob. 29. 11. 12. 13. 14. &amp;c. 
               When
the eare heard mee it bleſſed mee, when the
eie ſaw mee it gaue witneſſe to mee; for I deliuered
the poore that cryed, and the fatherleſſe
and him that had none to helpe him. The bleſſing
of him that was ready to periſh came vpon
mee, and I cauſed the widdowes heart to
reioyce, I put on iuſtice and it couered me, my
iudgement was a Robe and a Crowne; I was
the eie to the blind, and I was the feete to the
Lame, I was a father to the poore, and when I
knew not the cauſe, I ſought it out diligently.

I brake alſo the lawes of the varighteous
man, and plucked the prey out of his teeth.
A worthy example for Iudges, Iuſtices,
and Magistrates to imitate and follow.
Iob ſheweth before in what credite and
fauour hee was among the people: when
hee came to the place of Iudgement,
yong men being aſhamed of their looſeneſſe
feared his grauity, great perſons
were ſilent and acknowledged his wiſedome;
all that heard him praiſed his vpright
dealing, all loued him and reuerenced
him, and admired him, all were
affraid to offend him; By what meanes
came hee to ſuch authority, and credite?
hee got it not by any corrupt meanes, as
by pride, pompe, flattery; but by vertue,
by good gouernment, by iuſtice, and
mercy. Another worthy example is Nehemiah,
who though hee was a Courtier,
and liued in the Kings Pallace at caſe and
pleaſure, yet hee pittieth his deere countrimen
the Iewes, he mourneth and prayeth
for them. And afterward when the
poore people laied open their want and
extremity, in time of dearth, and complained
of the hard dealing of the rich
men, oppreſſing them by Vſury; he heareth
their cries, pitties their eſtate, reproueth

the oppreſſours, and reformeth
them. The poore people complaine that
the times were ſo hard, that they were
faine to pawne their Lands, to make their
ſonnes and daughters bond-ſlaues, and
that their owne Country-men would
lend them nothing freely to ſerue their
neceſſity withall; but dealt thus hardly
with them, with pinching and oppreſſing
them with Vſury; the reaſon to
moue pitty is, that they were of the
ſame nature, of the ſame fleſh and bloud
with them. Nehemiah vpon the complaint
of theſe diſtreſſed people is moued
with inward compaſſion, chargeth
the rich men with their oppreſſions, ſetteth
an aſſembly againſt them; to ſhame
them hee alleageth the example of Gods
mercy, who hath redeemed them from
the Heathen, and therefore that they
ſhould bee mercifull to their brethren;
Hee chargeth them that their doings is
euill and wicked, that they feared not
God, that they gaue the Heathen cauſe to
blaſpheme God, that they dealt as cruelly
as the Infidels; Hee cauſeth them to bind
themſelues with an oath to reſtore that
which they haue vniuſtly taken, hee curſeth
thoſe that will not keepe their oath,

hee moueth them, by his owne example,
to mercy, liberality, and hoſpitality; hee
and his lend money and corne to the needy,
hee kept at his Table an 150.Nehe. 5. Iewes
daily in this diſtreſſe. Both theſe examples
of Iob and Nehemiah, are as looking-glaſſes
and mirrours for Magiſtrates to
looke into; wherein they may ſee what
care and counſell, what pitty and compaſſion
they are to haue, to eaſe and releiue
the oppreſſions of their people: And this
will be greatly to their comfort, credite,
and honour; And indeed it may be a great
diſcomfort, and diſcredite to Princes, to
ſuffer their people to bee abuſed by oppreſſours
and tyrants, eſpecially, when it
lyeth in their power to helpe and relieue
them.Lattimer. A reuerend Father, and bleſſed
Martyr, in a certaine Sermon, before a
King of worthy memory, ſheweth wherin
the honour of a King conſiſteth. It is
(ſaith hee) the Kings honour, that his
Subiects be led in true Religion, that his
Prelates and Cleargy bee ſet about their
worke in Preaching and Studying, and
not to be interrupted from their charge.
Alſo it is the Kings honor that the Common-wealth
bee aduanced, and that the
dearth of things bee prouided for, and the

commodities of the Realme, bee ſo employed
as it may bee to the ſetting of his
Subiects on worke, and keeping them
from Idleneſſe, and herein conſiſteth the
Kings honour and Office. Furthermore, if
the Kings honour (as ſome men ſay) ſtandeth
in great multitude of people; then
theſe Graſiers, Encloſers, and rent-raiſers
are hinderers of the Kings honour. For
where there hath beene a great many of
Houſholders and Inhabitants, there is
now but the Shepeheard and his do, ſo
they hinder the Kings honour moſt of all.
And indded theſe bee the words of Salomon:
In the multitude of the people is the honour
of a King,
               Prou. 14. 28. 
               and for want of the people
commeth the deſtruction of a Prince. Increaſe
and aboundance of people is a
great bleſſing of God, and a credite and
ſtrength to the Prince. They are not Oxen
or Sheepe, but men, that muſt fight for
Prince and Country, if the enemies ariſe
and aſſault the Land. And there be many
oppreſſions amongſt vs beſides theſe:
Oppreſſours in the Church and in the
Common-wealth, oppreſſions in euery
Court, in buying and ſelling, and in other
dealings amongſt men to the hinderance
and vndoing of many poore people. But

to let paſſe the many kinds of oppreſſions
(which the true Magiſtrate is to looke into,
and ſo farre as hee can to redreſſe and
remoue) I ſpeake onely of that one kind
of oppreſſion (that is) biting and cruell
vſury, which Nehemiah reformed among
his people: I will ſpeake of this becauſe it
is moſt common and generall, &amp; yet moſt
pernicious &amp; deteſtable, though many do
count it no ſin at all. Vſury had wont to
be called the woe and ſin of Citties, and it
ſeemeth that as pride, and other ſinnes,
had their beginnings in great Citties: ſo
had vſury, but it hath paſſed from Citties
to the Country, to Townes and Villages.
Euery place, &amp; all ſorts of perſons in the
Land are infected with this peſtilence &amp;
leproſy; high, &amp; low, rich and poore, men,
women, and children, fathers &amp; mothers,
Maiſters, and Dames, ſons &amp; daughters,
men-ſeruants and maide-ſeruants, huſband-men,
tradeſ-men, and Labourers;
yea, &amp; ſome that go from dore to dore, to
beg and craue of others, haue learned
this trade of vſury. Free lending is hardly
to be found; charity is waxen cold, &amp; this
iniquity hath gotten the vpper hand: ſo
that this ſinne is not onely now a woe to
Citties, but a woe to Townes, to Villages,

and to priuate houſes. It is the ruine
and decay of many poore people in moſt
places of the Land; nay, it is the decay &amp;
ouerthrow of many worthy and great
houſes and families in the Land. It hath
bitten them, it hath eaten them, it hath
deuoured &amp; conſumed them to nothing;
It is pittifull and lamentable, that ſuch a
deſtroying and murdering ſin ſhould bee
ſuffered, or tollerated in a Chriſtian Land.
Thoſe that be true Chriſtians indeed are
to abſtaine from all appearance of euill:
How much more from ſo groſſe and apparant
euill, directly and expreſly againſt
the Law of God?Ex. 22. 25. 
               If thou lend money to
my people (ſaith God) that is, to the poore
with thee, thou ſhalt not bee as an Vſurer vnto
him, yee ſhall not oppreſſe him with Vſury.
Againe,Leui. 25. 35. 
               If thy brother bee impoueriſhed and
fallen into decay with thee, thou ſhalt releiue
him, thou ſhalt take no vſury of him nor aduantage,
but thou ſhalt feare thy God, that thy
brother may liue with thee; thou ſhalt not giue
him thy money to vſury, nor lend him victuals
for increaſe.
               Pſal. 15. 
               Dauid ſhutteth out the vſurer
out of Gods Kingdome, as well as the
ſlanderer, and him that taketh reward
againſt the innocent.Ez. 18. 6. 8. 13. Another Prophet
putteth Vſury, amongſt Idols, Adultery,

and other filthy ſinnes, and threatneth
the ſame puniſhment to one, as to the
other.Math. 7. 12. Chriſt ſaith: Whatſoeuer you would
men ſhould do to you, euen ſo doe yee to them,
for this is the Law and the Prophets.
               Matth. 5. 42. Againe,
Giue to him that aſketh, and from him that
would borrow of thee, turne not away. A Heathen
man being aſked what Vſury was,
hee anſwered, what is it to kill a man?
Another ſaith that it is robbery, Another
that it is the death of life. The ancient
learned fathers do vtterly condemne it:
One ſaith that Vſury ſwalloweth vp mens
goods and Lands, &amp; large Patrimony, as
it were a Sea, &amp; yet the Sea is neuer filled.
The Seas, for the moſt part, are for profite
and gaine, but the Vſurer can no man vſe
but to his owne hinderance: In the Sea
there is profite of many things, but with
the Vſurer ſhipwracke of all things. Againe,
hee that taketh vſury, committeth
extortion, rauen, and pillage. If hee will
ſay, I haue nothing elſe to liue by; ſo may
the Theefe ſay, the Bawde, the Witch, the
Sorcerer. Some compare the loane of
mony vpon vſe to the poyſon of Aſpes:
Whoſoeuer is ſtrucken and ſtung of the
Aſpe, he falleth into a ſweet pleaſant ſleep,

for then the venemous poyſon diſperſeth
into euery member: So he that beginneth
with vſury, thinketh for a time that hee
hath a great benefite, but vſury runneth
through all his riches, and conuerteth all
he hath to debt. Another father being aſked
what vſury is, ſaith; It is a poyſon of
patrimony: And being aſked what is vſury
permitted by Law, hee ſaith that it is a
Theefe that before hand giueth warning
what he mindeth to do. Some ſay that a
Vſurer is worſe then all ſinners: hee is
worſe then a theefe, for he robbeth in the
night, but the Vſurer robbeth day and
night. He is worſe then hel, for in hel onely
the wicked ſhall bee puniſhed; but the
Vſurer ſpoyleth and puniſheth both the
good and bad, &amp; ſpareth neither holy nor
vnholy. He is worſe then a Iew, for one
Iew will not take vſury of another, but
the Vſurer will take vſury of his Chriſtian
brother. Hee is worſe then death, for
death killeth but the body, the Vſurer killeth
bodies and ſoules. He is worſe then
Iudas, for he ſold Chriſt but once for thirty
pence; but they ſell Chriſt continually
as often as they can. Iudas reſtored that
which he had vniuſtly taken: but the vſurers
neuer make reſtitution.
            
               
Some compare the vſurer to an hogge
or pigge, that while he liueth, is profitable
and good for nothing: hee will euer
be rooting vp the earth, running through
hedges, and eating vp good corne: So
doth the vſurer much hurt while hee liueth.
Indeed when the hog is dead there
is ſome profite: So it may be when the vſurer
dyeth, the poore ſhall get ſomthing.
How many Sermons haue been preached
in this and other places againſt vſury?
how many Bookes and Treatiſes both
long ſince, and of late haue beene written
by the beſt learned men of our owne
Countrey, againſt this monſtrous ſinne?
Giue mee leaue to put you in minde of
ſome of them, to the further ſhame and
condemnation of greedy vſurers. Worthy
and reuerend Iuell (whoſe workes are
now to be ſeene in euery Church) writing
vpon the Epiſtle of the Theſſalonians, the
fourth chapter, doth bitterly inueigh againſt
vſury, ſaying; That no good and
godly man will vſe it: that all that feare
Gods iudgments abhorre and condemne
it: that it is filthy gaine, and a worke of
darkneſſe, a monſter in nature, the ouerthrow
of mighty kingdomes, the deſtruction
of flouriſhing ſtates, the decay of

wealthy Citties, the plague of the world,
the miſery of the people. It is theft, the vſurer
is worſe then the thiefe, it is the
curſe of God, and the curſe of the people:
this is vſury.
            There was neuer any religion (ſaith he)
nor ſect, nor ſtate, nor degree, nor profeſſion
of men, but they haue diſliked it a
Phyloſophers, Greekes, Latines, Lawyers,
Diuines, Catholickes, Heretickes, all
tongues and nations haue euer thought an
vſurer as bad as a thiefe; Nature proueth
it, if ſtones could ſpeake, they would ſay
as much. He threatneth to excommunicate
all vſurers of that Citty where hee
preached, to publiſh their names, &amp; ſhame
them, that all men may know them and
abhorre them, as the plagues &amp; monſters
of the world. And thus hee concludeth;
Tell mee, thou wretched wight of the
world, thou vnkinde creature, which art
paſt all ſence and feeling of God, which
knoweſt the will of God, and doeſt the
contrary: how dareſt thou come into the
Church? It is the Church of God which
hath ſaid; Thou ſhalt take no vſury. How
dareſt thou reade or heare the word of
God? It is the word of God that condemneth
vſury, and thou knoweſt it, how dareſt

thou come into the company of thy
brethren? vſury is the plague and deſtruction,
and vndoing of thy brethren, and
this thou knoweſt: How dareſt thou look
vpon thy children, thou makeſt the wrath
of God fall downe from heauen vpon
them: thy iniquity ſhall bee puniſhed in
thē to the third &amp; fourth generation, this
thou knoweſt. How dareſt thou looke vp
vnto the heauens? thou haſt no dwelling
there. Thou ſhalt haue no place in the tabernacle
of the moſt high. In many other
Treatiſes vſury is arraigned, conuicted,
condemned by ſundry verdicts, it is
proued ſcandalous, and of bad report, againſt
the law of God, againſt the law of
nations, againſt iuſtice, honeſty and charity.
All ſhifts, excuſes, obiections and exceptions
are taken away and remoued.
And whereas ſome learned men do ſeeme
to fauour, &amp; in ſome ſort to tollerate this
ſin, yet it is with theſe and ſuch like cautions
and limitations, To deale as he would
be dealt withall, to lend freely where they
borrow vpon neceſſity, and that the borrowers
gaines be ſo much more as the intereſt,
at leaſt that the Common-wealth
haue no hurt by it. But before the vſurer
will be tied to theſe conditions &amp; exceptions;

he will firſt giue ouer his trade. And
that all that hath beene ſpoken might at
leaſt perſwade ſome vſurers to lead a new
courſe, to reſtore their ill-gotten goods,
to lend freely, in mercy, loue and compaſſion.
Theſe vſurers to whom Nehemiah
ſpake, were touched at this one ſpeech,
and as it ſeemeth, confeſſed their fault, &amp;
amended it, and ſhall men which confeſſe
Chriſt, after ſo many bookes written, and
ſo many Sermons preached againſt them,
ſhall they yet continue in this enormious
ſin without repentance and reſtitution?
how ſhall they then eſcape the vengeance
and damnation to come? Howſoeuer, let
Magiſtrates, as their duty requires them,
after the example of Nehemiah, be carefull
to eaſe their people of this heauy burden
and oppreſſion. Let the Magiſtrate (I ſay)
by counſel, by example and reproofe, and
by all poſſible meanes that they can, ſeeke
(if it may be) to reforme theſe oppreſſors,
at leaſt to ſhame and reſtraine them. And
pitty it is that there be not ſeuere &amp; ſharp
lawes for the puniſhment of theſe, as well
as of other notorious offenders. We may
wiſh (as one long ſince) Good Lord God
ſend to England ſome Solon for the redreſſe
of this, who took away the vſurers bookes

and their gaines from them, and forbad
ſuch filthy lucre, and brought in an eaſement
of this burden, for that all debters
were diſcharged from all ſuch creditors
which had lent their money for vſury and
gaine; or at leaſtwiſe were eaſed from
the vſury of it. Thus did Solon in the deteſtation
of vſury. A ſharpe kind of dealing
no doubt, and a ſtrange, but in great diſeaſes
ſharpe corroſiues muſt needes
bee vſed, when lenitiue ſalues will not
ſerue.
            I reade that long before the Conqueſt
King Edgar that iuſt gouernour, and ſeuere
Magiſtrate againſt all leud officers in
this Land, did amongſt other his good
deedes, make proclamation, that all the
Wolues ſhould bee killed in England and
Wales, becauſe they were rauenous beaſts,
and deuourers of ſheepe and other cattel,
to the great hinderance and harme of his
ſubiects. And to haue this the beter done,
he apointed many to bring for their fines
and reuenues Wolues heads yearly, ſome
more, ſome leſſe, and ſuch as could not
bring Wolues heads in, paid their fines
and reuenues in money. Now ſuch force
tooke this good order in this Land,
that within a while there was not a

Wolfe to bee had nor found, neither in
England nor Wales. That learned man
wiſheth, that likewiſe all vſurers ſhould
ſuffer the paines of death, or be baniſhed
this realme for euer, that there might
hereafter no more vſurers bee found in
England, then are Wolues to bee had this
day. He doth not ſee but that it is as neceſſary
to haue a law againſt vſurers, as againſt
theeues, and a great deale more▪ for
theeues ſteale many times for neceſſity,
whereas vſurers rob and vndo all men for
greedy gluttony: the one ſtealeth a
crowne in the high way, the other robbeth
men in the high ſtreet of all that they
haue: the one ſtealeth a little to ſuſtaine
nature, the other ſcratcheth vp the whole
treaſure of England to ſerue his owne couetous
and wretched deſire, to the vtter
vndoing of thouſands. And if theſe lawes
ſeeme bloudy (although the hanging of
poore wretches for ſmal matters, is counted
nothing bloudy at all) then would I
that the old lawes of England were put in
execution, ſuch as are called King Edwards
lawes of the common lawes of England,
whereof one was, that the goods of an vſurer
after his diſceaſe ſhould turne to the
benefite of the Prince, when twelue men

had found by proofe, that the party diſceaſed
was an vſurer in his life time. Finally,
that learned man in that learned
diſcourſe againſt v
                  •
               ury,Fol, 137. written ſo many
yeares agoe, alledgeth many ſharpe puniſhments
appointed by the ciuill &amp; common
lawes. And leaſt he ſhould ſeeme of
ſmall credit for to ſpeake too hardly, and
without proofe, let vs ſee what Mr 
               Iuell
in a letter ſpeaketh of that booke; What
it ſhould worke in others I cannot tell
(ſaith he,) for mine owne part if I were an
vſurer neuer ſo greedily bent to ſpoile &amp;
rauen, as vſurers be, yet would I thinke
my ſelfe moſt vnhappy if ſuch perſwaſions
could not moue me: for what man
would not be afraid, to liue deſperately in
that ſtate of life that hee ſeeth manifeſtly
condemned by Heathens, by Chriſtians,
by old Fathers, by the ancient Councels,
by Emperours, by Biſhops, by Cannons,
by Decrees, by all Sects of all Religions,
by the Goſpell of Chriſt, by the mouth of
God. And if it be ſo, is not vſury to be puniſhed
and reſtrained by all poſſible
meanes? It is the decree of a Counſel, that
a Cleargy man an vſurer ſhould be degraded,
and therefore it is counted a deadly
ſin. Another Councell condemneth all for

Heretickes, who held vſury lawfull. Another
decreed, that manifeſt vſurers
ſhould bee depriued of the communion
and fellowſhip of the Chriſtians in their
life, and of Chriſtian buriall after death,
till their heires had reſtored their vſury.
Conſidering therefore the danger and
hurtfulneſſe of this ſin which ſo commonly
reigneth amongſt vs, let all good Gouernours
(I ſay) continually ſet before
their eyes, this worthy example of good
Nehemiah, hauing the like care and compaſſion
that he had towards his people, vſing
all meanes they can to eaſe them of
heauy burdens, and to ſuppreſſe vſury, extortion,
and all kinde of oppreſſion whatſoeuer.
Herein they ſhall bee like God
himſelfe,Pſal. 103 6. who is ſaid to execute righteouſneſſe
and iudgement to all that are oppreſſed.
And not onely ſuch as be oppreſſed with
wrongs and iniuries are to bee reſpected
of the good Magiſtrate, but alſo all they
whoſoeuer, that be in want and neceſſity,
not being able to maintaine themſelues.
All theſe (I ſay) are to be prouided for by
the care and prouidence of good Gouernours;
and this is a part of Iuſtice, Equity
and Righteouſneſſe. This is a ſpeciall
part of their office to relieue and helpe the

poore, by their example, counſell and power
to draw others, and if need require, to
conſtraine them to the helping and aiding
of the needy. Magiſtrates are Paſtors,
Fathers and Nurſes; they muſt ſee
that all their ſheepe and children bee fed
and nouriſhed. God is the creator of the
poore, and by his prouidence they are
poore. Chriſt is their Redeemer, and died
for them as well as for the rich; and
therefore they muſt not bee contemned,
but much regarded as men; yea as Chriſtian
men. God is the God of the poore,
of the 
                  ••
               iect, of the fatherleſſe, and widdowes,
he is full of compaſſion to ſuch, &amp;
hath a care of them, hee hath made many
lawes, giueth many precepts, for the defence
and reliefe of the poore, hath ordained
Kings, Iudges, Magiſtrates, and
other officers in the Church &amp; Common-wealth,
for the comfort, ſuccour, and help
of the poore and needy: and becauſe there
ſhall be alwayes ſome poore in the land,
therefore he commandeth, ſaying;Deut. 15. 10. 11. 
               Thou
ſhalt open thy hand to thy brother to the needy,
&amp; to the poore in the land. And he ſaith a litle
before: Thou ſhalt giue him, and let it not
grie
                     •
                  e thine heart to giue him: for becauſe of
this, the Lord thy God ſhall bleſſe thee in all

thy workes, and in all that thou doeſt take in
hand to doe. Salomon may be commended
to bee the poore mans King, for he doth
commend the poore vnto vs by many
exhortations and precepts.Pro. 11. 24. 
               There is (ſaith
hee) that ſe
                     •
                  ttereth, and is more increaſed,
but hee that ſpareth more then is right, ſurely
commeth to pouerty. The liberall perſon ſhall
haue plenty, and he that watereth ſhall haue
raine.
               Pro. 14. 31. 
               He that 
                     •
                  ppreſſeth the poore, reproueth
him that made him: but hee honoureth him
that hath mercy on the poore.
               Pro. 21. 13. 
               He that ſtoppeth
his eare at the crying of the poore, ſhall alſo cry
and not be heard.
               Pro. 19. 17. 
               Hee that hath mercy on the
poore, lendeth vnto the Lord; and the Lord
will recompence him that which hee hath giuen.
               Pro. 28. 27. Againe, He that giueth vnto the poore,
ſhall not lacke: but he that hideth his eyes ſhall
haue many curſes. Many ſuch counſels and
prouerbes he deliuereth for the comforting
and relieuing of the poore. And as he
gaue this counſell to others, ſo hee was
carefull to follow it himſelfe. Dauid his
father propheſieth of him;Pſal. 7. 12. 13. 
               Hee ſhall deliuer
the poore when hee crieth, the needy alſo
and him that hath no helper, He ſhall be mercifull
to the poore and needy, and ſhall preſerue
the ſoule of the poore. Chriſt the true Salomon
giueth the like counſell touching the

poore, and practiſeth the ſame in himſelfe,
being a moſt liuely and perfect patterne
of mercy and compaſſion to the diſtreſſed.
Math. 5 7. He faith; Bleſſed are the mercifull, for
they ſhall obtaine mercy. Againe, Be mercifull
as your father is alſo mercifull.
               Math. 6 36. And in another
place, Giue almes of thoſe things
which are within,
               Luke 11. 41. 
               and behold all things ſhall
be cleane to you. Sell that yee haue, and giue
almes:
               Luke 12▪ 33. 
               make you bagges which waxe not old,
a treaſure that can neuer faile in heauen,
where no thiefe commeth, neither moth corrupteth.
And when wee make a feaſt, hee
biddeth vs call the poore,
               Luke 14. 13. 14. 
               the maimed, the
lame, and the blinde, and ſo (ſaith he) thou
ſhalt bee bleſſed, becauſe they cannot recompence
thee: for thou ſhalt bee recompenced at
the reſurrection of the iuſt. He ſheweth the
fearefull and damnable eſtate of the rich
man,Luke 16. 19. who fared delicately euery day, but
yet had no care to relieue poore Lazarus.
And as the Lord Ieſus doth perſwade all
men to mercy: ſo hee himſelfe was moſt
mercifull, ready and willing to do good
to the bodies and ſoules of men. Hee is
touched with the feeling of our infirmities,
Math. 9 36. and ready to helpe in time of need.
When he ſaw the multitude hee had compaſſion
vpon them, becauſe they were diſperſed, and

                     〈1 page duplicate〉
                  
                  
                  
                     〈1 page duplicate〉
                  
                  
                  
ſcattered abroad, as ſheepe hauing no Sheapheard.
            
            And when he ſaw another great multitude
which had nothing to eate, he called
his Diſciples to him, and ſaid vnto
them:Mark. 8. 1. 2. 3. 
               I haue compaſſion on the multitude,
becauſe they haue now continued with me three
dayes, and haue nothing to eate: and if I ſend
them away faſting to their owne houſes, they
will faint by the way, for ſome of them came
from farre. And preſently hee wrought a
miracle: for with ſeuen loues▪ and a few
ſmall fiſhes, he fed about foure thouſand
ſoules. He is like that good Samaritane,
who when hee ſaw that man that fell among
the theeues, beeing robbed and
wounded, came nere vnto him, and when
hee ſaw him, he had compaſſion on him,
and bound vp his wounds, and powred in
oyle and wine, and put him vpon his own
horſe, and brought him to an Inne, and
made prouiſion for him.
            Finally,2. Cor. 8. 9. 
               wee know the grace of our Lord
Ieſus Chriſt, that he being rich, for our ſakes
became poore, that through his pouerty wee
might bee made rich. All the Apoſtles had
ſpeciall care of the poore, they put one another
in minde of this
                  •
                duty, Paul confeſſeth
that hee had warning from others

to remember the poore; which thing alſo
he was diligent to doe. Hee doth in many
places put the Church in minde of this
duty.
            Concerning the gathering for the Saints
(ſaith hee) as I haue ordained in the Church
of Galatia:1. Cor. 16▪ 1. 2. ſo doe yee alſo. Euery firſt day of
the weeke let euery one of you put aſide by himſelfe,
and lay vp as God hath proſpered him,
that there bee no gathering when I come.
            And in another place hee beſtoweth
two whole Chapters in perſwading them
by ſundry reaſons to the cheerefull relieuing
of the poore Saints.2. Cor. 8. &amp; 9. You may
ſee that the primitiue Church had both
ordinary &amp; extraordinary gatherings for
their own poore, and for ſtrangers: theſe
collections were very fitly on the Lords
day. Such workes of mercy are workes
of the Sabaoth: then we heare the word
which doth ſtirre vs vp to this duety, then
are publicke prayers and petitions to
God, which ſhould moue vs to heare the
petitions of others, as we will haue God
to heare vs; then wee cry and craue for
mercy to him, and therefore wee ſhould
ſnewe mercy to others: then are the Sacraments
adminiſtred, which doe moue
vs to loue and charity one to another:

then the examples of others ſhould
prouoke vs to kindneſſe and liberality
towards our brethren: then wee remember
and call to minde the remembrance
of God towards vs, which ſhould
moue vs to bee beneficiall to others:
then wee profeſſe the communion of
Saints, and therefore ſhould bee ready
to impart ſuch gifts as wee haue, to
the comfort and benefite one of another.
Chriſtians are all one Corporation and
one houſhold; and therefore ſhould haue
a care of the helping and relieuing one of
another.
            The end of riches is not onely to ſerue
our owne neceſſities▪ but ſpecially the
glory of God, and alſo the neceſſity of others.
The poſſeſſion of riches is vncertaine,
our life vncertaine, our ſtate vncertaine,
being ſubiect to the ſame calamities
that others are: And therefore
while wee haue time let vs doe good to
all men, and ſpecially to the houſhold of
faith.
            And conſider (I pray you) who it is
that hath need, and requireth thy helpe:
It is Man, euen one like thy ſelfe, of the
ſame nature, and it may bee of the ſame
Spirit and Grace. And what doth hee

aske of thee? but onely that which God
doth giue thee, not onely fo
                  •
                thine owne
vſe, but for the good of others. Nay, it
is God himſelfe that asketh, and is become
petitioner to thee for the poore. It
is God (I ſay) that asketh, who hath giuen
thee body and ſoule and goods; who
hath giuen his ſonne for thee who loueth
the poore; and whatſoeuer is done to
them for his ſake, hee accounteth it as
done to himſelfe. And he asketh nothing
but his owne: for the earth is the Lords,
and all that therein is; and all the beaſts
of the forreſt are his, and all the beaſts on
a thouſand mountaines. And he doth not
aske it to thy hurt and hinderance, but to
thy greater gaine and aduantage. He that
is mercifull rewardeth his owne ſoule: And he
that hath mercie on the poore, lendeth to the
Lord, and the Lord will recompence him that
which he hath giuen. This is the beſt vſury,
to put out money and riches to good and
holy vſes, to put them into the hands of
God, to beſtow them according to his
will, and then they ſhall be increaſed and
multiplied. We are all debters to God, we
owe him all we haue, he hath ordained all
things for our vſe, and therefore it is reaſon
we ſhould truſt him, and commit all

we haue into his hands. A wiſe creditor
will truſt a faithful debter with any thing.
And ſhall not wee truſt our God who is
moſt ſure of his word, and the beſt paymaiſter
of all others? He is God, the faithfull
God, which keepeth couenant and
mercy vnto them that loue him, and keep
his Commandements,Deu. 7. 5▪
                euen to a thouſand
generations.Gen. 15. 1. This God ſaid vnto Abraham;
I am thy Buckler, and thy exceeding
great reward. God ſaith to thee: Giue, and
I will giue, thou haſt had mee a giuer, make
me now thy debter. The poore man (ſaith
a Father) is a fruitfull field, and quickely
and plenteouſly returneth that which
it hath receiued. The Husband-man
buyeth Oxen, Horſe, and feedeth them, he
tilleth the ground, he caſteth in his ſeede,
and all vpon hope of a doubtfull harueſt:
but almes is a ſeed to be ſowen, the crop
and harueſt will certainly follow. Againe,
If thou wilt bee a good Merchant, and an
excellent vſurer, giue forth that thou canſt
not keepe, that thou maiſt receiue that
thou canſt not looſe: Giue a little, that
thou maiſt receiue an hundred times as
much: giue a temporall poſſeſſion for an
euerlaſting inheritance.
            What a folly is it (
                  •
               aith another) there

to lay vp thy goods from whence thou
muſt depart, and not rather to ſend them
before thee to the place where thou muſt
go to inhabite. Let thy goods be where
thy country is, hee that hoordeth vp treaſure
in earth, haſt nothing to looke for in
heauen: Why lookeſt thou vp to heauen
where thou hath laid vp nothing?1. Tim. 6. 
               Charge
them that are rich in this world (ſaith the
Apoſtle) that they bee not high-minded, and
that they trust not in vncertaine riches, but in
the liuing God, which giueth vs aboundance of
all things to enioy; that they do good, and bee
rich in good worke, and ready to diſtribute and
communicate, laying vp in ſtore for themſelues
a good foundation againſt the time to come,
that they may obtaine eternall life. God
hath ordained (ſaith one) for men two
Crownes; for the poore the Crowne of
Patience, for the rich the Crowne of Liberality.
As the poore do depriue themſelues
of their Crowne by Impatiency
and murmuring; ſo ought the rich by helping
the poore, to ſtriue to obtaine the
Crowne of Liberality. Worthy is the
example of the Primitiue Church, of
whom it is ſaid there was ſuch order and
charity amongſt them that none of them
lacked;
               Acts 4. 34. 35. 
               for as many as were poſſeſſours of lands

and of houſes ſold them, and brought the price
of the things that were ſold, and laid it downe
at the Apoſtles feete, and it was diſtributed to
euery one as he had need: The nūber of beleeuers
at that time was about fiue thouſand.
They liued in time of perſecution,
they wanted the helpe of a good Magiſtrate.
All Kings and Princes were enemies
to the Church at that time, yet they
tooke ſuch good order, and were ſo charitable
that they ſuffered none to lacke
among them. It is a ſhame then for vs to
ſuffer any to want neceſſary ſuſtenance;
wee (I ſay) liuing in the daies of peace
and plenty vnder a Chriſtian King, hauing
ſo many good Lawes for the prouiſion
and reliefe of the poore. There is a
memorable example of the Chriſtians
vnder Maximinus the Emperour. In
the time of famine many of the Heathens
were preſerued and ſaued from
death, by the mercy and liberallity of the
Chriſtians, whereupon it came to paſſe,
that thoſe which did deadly hate them
before, did now require their helpe, and
did openly confeſſe that the bowels of
mercy were onely found amongſt Chriſtians,
that therefore Chriſtian Religion
was the true Religion, which taught her

worſhippers true piety and godlineſſe:
The which, when Iulianus the Apoſtata,
afterwards obſerued and marked, leaſt
Chriſtian Religion ſhould bee the more
eſteemed, becauſe of ſuch incredible
kindneſſe and mercy, ſhewed to all ſorts
of people; Iulienus (I ſay) euery where
erected Hoſpitals, and endewed them
with yeerely reuenues. And hee ſetteth
downe this reaſon of his purpoſe, writing
to one Arſatius an Idolatrous Biſhop:
It is a ſhame (ſaith hee) that the worſhippers
of the Gods ſhould neglect their owne,
when as the wicked Galileans (for ſo he had
wont to call Chriſtians) releiued not onely
their owne, but alſo ſtrangers; yea, 
                     •
                  uen the
enemies of their Religion, and ſuffered none
of their owne to beg from dore to dore. The
moſt vnhappy Nation of the Iewes, hauing
no certaine reſting place, nor any
forme of Common-wealth, yet do they
mainetaine and ſeed their owne, leaſt
they ſhould be conſtrained to craue help
from Chriſtians. The French and Dutch
Churches in this our Land, they ſet all
their owne on worke, they ſuffer none to
beg nor to want among them. The Papiſts
our Fore-fathers, they did excell in
liberallity to the Church and Common-wealth,

in Hoſpitality and Almes to the
poore: Wee haue many Monuments of
their liberality amongſt vs, as Hoſpitals
and Almes-houſes for the releiefe of the
needy, with good Reuenues adioyned
to them. Nay, the Papiſts adorned,
beautified, and cloathed, their dumbe
Idols and Images, and ſhall wee ſuffer
poore people to want food and cloathing,
which carry vpon them the liuely
Image of God? All theſe examples are to
our ſhame and condemnation, and ſhall
bee iudges and witneſſes againſt vs at the
day of the Lord. Wee profeſſe the glorious
Goſpell of Chriſt, wee haue the
light of Gods word ſhining before vs,
wee haue daily Sermons and Exhortations
ſtirring vs vp to the workes of mercy,
wee haue many good and godly
Lawes, agreeing to the Lawes of God,
and to the true diſcipline of the Church,
commanding and enioyning prouiſion
and reliefe of the poore, forbidding all
idleneſſe, commanding all to bee ſet a
worke, and all that want to bee releiued,
according to their neceſſity, and yet
there be many idle perſons amongſt vs,
many would worke and cannot get it,
many though they do worke, labour, and

toyle, night and day, as much as may be,
yet in reſpect of the hardneſſe of the
times, all that they get will hardly prouide
bread for them and theirs. Others
there bee that cannot worke at all, and
others but a very little, yet theſe in many
places are little regarded or prouided
for. Good Lawes wee haue, and in this
place, I know there is good order and
care taken for the poore. Here bee many
meanes for their reliefe, which others
want: And I know there bee many tender,
mercifull, and pittifull hearts, pittying
the needy eſtates of their brethren,
ſtretching forth their hands to their releife;
yet conſidering the hardneſſe of
the time, and how vnmercifull and hard
hearted ſome are, which yet are of great
eſtate and ability, and conſidering alſo
the multitude and great number of the
poore, which increaſe daily. Your care
your pitty, your liberallity, your collections
and almes, publicke, or ſecret, had
need bee more then ordinary: And therefore
I beſeech you (deerely beloued) in the
bowels of Chriſt, as the Elect of God,
put on you the bowels of mercy, conſider
your owne abilities, and the great neceſſitie
of ſo many, and let it not grieue

you to helpe and releiue them, but freely,
frankly, and cheerefully ſhew forth the
fruite of your compaſſion, loue, and mercy
to your diſtreſſed brethren, and eſpecially
you (Right Worſhipfull Magiſtrates
&amp; Gouernours,) do your beſt endeuours
according to your place and callings,
to ſee this ſeruice and worke performed;
by your counſell and example to
perſwade and draw as many as you can
to this duty. And as for thoſe that are
rich; yet cruell, couetous, hard-heartd,
and vnmercifull, compell and force them
by rigour of Law, to giue that to good
vſes which they are vnwilling to giue at
all. All the poore vnder your gouernement
be they neuer ſo many, they are
your cure and charge, you muſt ſee them
prouided for, if any of them periſh
through your default, their bloud ſhall
bee required at your hands. The good
Miniſter is to be a mouth for the poore
to ſpeake and entr
                  •
               ate for them, and alſo
by his example as much as he may, to go
before others in the duties of mercy: But
the good Magiſtrate is not onely to bee a
good mouth for the poore, but an hand,
an eare, an eye, and a foote for them; to
ſpeake, to heare, to ſee, to go, to do what

lyeth in him, both for the defence and reliefe
of the poore. As God forbiddeth
all cruelty and priuate reuenge in the
ſixth Commandement; ſo he commandeth
all care and meanes to preſerue the
liues of our brethren; now releife of the
needy is a meanes to preſerue life, he that
releeueth not when he may, and when
there is great neceſſity offendeth againſt
this Commandement, and is a murtherer.
Non pauiſti, occidiſti▪
                thou haſt not fed
(ſaith one) therefore thou haſt killed. A
Lampe is quenched not onely by blowing
it out, but by keeping away the oile
to feed it: A fire is quenched, not onely
by water but by keeping away wood
from it; In a great drought many hearbs
do die, not onely by plucking vp, but for
want of watring; So, many poore people
for want of food which they ſhould
haue by the care of good Gouernours
and charitable good people; many (I ſay)
for want of meanes and prouiſion, doe
decay, pine, and periſh, which is moſt
ſhamefull, fearefull, lamentable, and intollerable
in a Chriſtian State. But I nothing
doubt of your care and dilligence
to performe this ſo worthy and neceſſary
duty: I know you are dayly put in minde

of theſe things, and therefore I will ceaſe
to vrge this point any further. Onely by
the way let mee giue ſome few inſtructions
and caueats, and ſome comforts to
the poorer ſort. Theſe muſt know that
God hath ſo ordained, and appointed in
his prouidence, that there ſhall bee ſome
poore as long as the world endureth. Let
them therefore bee content with their
ſtate, ſeeing God (who knoweth what is
beſt for them) hath ſo decreed it in his
Wiſedome: It may bee if they had riches
they would abuſe them in pride and wantonneſſe;
he can (if he ſee good) turne
their want into plenty, Let them know
that many worthy men haue beene in
want and neceſſity; Let them take their
pouerty as a croſſe, and let them be patient
and humble, the rather becauſe
ſometimes their owne idleneſſe and
looſeneſſe of life hath cauſed it, let them
repent of their ſinnes paſt, let them
take heed hereafter of pride, en
                  •
               y, ſlothfulneſſe,
and vnlawfull ſhifts and meanes;
Let them depend vpon God and caſt
their whole care vpon him, and though
they bee poore in the world, let their
chiefe care bee to bee rich in grace, in
knowledge, and in faith, and ſo they ſhall

bee ſure to bee greatly in the fauour of
God:Phil. 4. 10. 12. 13 Let euery one of them ſay with
the Apoſtle: I haue learned in what ſtate I
am, there-with to bee content; I can be abaſed,
and I can abound, euery where in all things,
I am inſtructed both to bee full and to be hungry,
and to abound and to haue want, I am
able to doe all things through the helpe of
Chriſt which ſtrengthneth mee. Let them
bee kind and pittifull to thoſe which bee
in like caſe with them, ſeeing they are in
the ſame miſery: Let them bee thankefull
towards their Benefactors; and
though ſome rich-men bee hard-hearted
&amp; vnmercifull to thē, let them not curſe,
but bleſſe, and pray to God for them,
who is able to mollifie and ſoften their
hard hearts: for it may bee God in his iuſtice
doth turne the hearts of men from
them, becauſe they haue turned their
eares and hearts from him: they haue
beene hard hearted againſt God, againſt
Gods word, and againſt their brethren,
and therefore the hearts of others are
iuſtly hardened againſt them. Let them
remember and follow the example of
poore Lazarus, which though the rich
man dealtmore cruelly with him thē did
his dogs, &amp; had no pitty at all of ſo poore

a creature, yet this poore man did neither
grudge, repine, nor curſe: and therefore
being full of faith and patience, he was
receiued into Abrahams boſome. And finally,
ſeeing that God hath ſuch a great
care of the poore in making ſo many
Lawes for them, in giuing ſo many preceps
for their reliefe, and taketh their
cauſe to be his owne, and ſeeing he hath
appointed Miniſters to ſpeake for them,
and Officers and Magiſtrates; yea, Kings
and Princes for their defence and reliefe:
Let the poore (I ſay) bee carefull to ſerue
&amp; feare that God, which is ſo carefull of
them; let them reuerence and loue the
Miniſters &amp; louingly embrace that word
which doth perſwade, moue &amp; prouoke
all men to the duties of mercy, loue, &amp; liberality;
Let them honor the Magiſtrates
who are appointed as fathers vnto them,
who take care and watch, and take continuall
paines to comfort and helpe them:
And let them ſay in their ſoules, bleſſed be
God for good Gouernours: And thus we
haue heard many good parts of good
Gouernours, that by their meanes the
wicked are puniſhed, the good are praiſed
and countenanced, euery man poſſeſſeth
his owne; oppreſſions and wrongs are

ſuppreſſed, the poore and needy are comforted
and relieued, and all theſe benefits
&amp; duties this gracious Queene includeth
in theſe words Equity and Righteouſneſſe.
One duty yet remaineth, which is alſo a
part of Equity, and that is to eſtabliſh and
mainetaine true Religion; this is the firſt
&amp; chiefe duty of a good Prince, though I
haue referred it to the laſt place. Good
Princes are not onely to haue a care of iuſtice
in puniſhing the wicked, &amp; of mercy
in defending the good, and releeuing the
diſtreſſed; but alſo to plant and maintane
the worſhip of God in their Kingdomes.
Thus much wee haue heard already, that
Religion &amp; Diuine Wiſedome belongeth
to all ſorts &amp; degrees of men, to rich and
poore, to yong &amp; old, to men, women &amp;
children, and moſt of all to Princes &amp; Gouernours,
who are to be giudes and ringleaders
to others. We haue examples before
our eyes of a religious Queene comming
ſo great and long a iourny to be reſolued
in the truth of religion, &amp; repoſing
the greateſt happines in true &amp; heauenly
wiſedome: Here alſo is the example of Salomon
a mirrour of Religion and Diuine
Wiſedom to all the world; who alſo planted
and eſtabliſhed the true worſhip of

God in his Kingdome. We haue heard alſo
that God is the authour of the callings
of Kings and Princes, that they are in his
ſteed and carry his Name and Image; &amp;
therfore they, of all others, are to be moſt
Religious, &amp; to be moſt carefull that the
true God, who hath ſo highly aduanced
them, may bee worſhipped and ſerued in
their Kingdomes: And this is Equity and
Righteouſneſſe to command &amp; eſtabliſh
the Law and Seruice of their Creator and
Protector: And further wee haue heard,
that it is the duty of Gouernours to ouerthrow
and roote out all falſe worſhip, all
falſe doctrine, hereſie, and idolatry: as all
theſe are to bee remoued; ſo in ſteed of
theſe, good Princes are to plant true Religion,
&amp; to eſtabliſh faithfull Teachers
in their Kingdomes: They muſt be examples
of Religion and Piety to others, they
muſt guide their families ſo carefully, religiouſly,
that they may be patternes and
preſidents to others, If Religion be firſt in
their owne hearts, &amp; alſo planted in their
houſhold and families, they will be alſo
carefull that all the people committed to
their charge may feare God, &amp; be truely
Religious. This is part of the counſell of
Iethro, Moſes father in law, wiſhing him

that hee ſhould prouide not onely men of
courage,
               Ex. 18. 21. 
               and iuſt men, hating couetouſneſſe,
but alſo ſuch as feared God. There be generall
places in the Scripture, as; Loue God
with all thine heart, with all thy ſoule, with all
thy ſtrength: Feare God, and keep his Cōmandements.
Seeke for Gods Kingdome. Labor for
the meat that neuer periſheth. Theſe, &amp; ſuch
like commandements, &amp; exhortations, as
they belong to all Chriſtians, ſo alſo to
Magiſtrates: They are keepers of both the
Tables of the Commandements, &amp; therfore
to maintaine the one as well as the
other: they muſt ſee as well the duties to
God, performed to him, as the duties to
mē one to another. They muſt haue a care
not only of iuſtice, peace, &amp; ciuil honeſty;
but alſo of the ſincerity of Religion: The
King is commanded to haue the book of
the Law,Deut. 17. 18. 19. 
               to reade in it continually; that ſo he
may learne to feare both his God, and to keep al
the words of the Law.

examples that good Princes are to haue a
care of Religion both in themſelues and
others. And here is a further bleſſing of
a good King, that wee haue not onely by
his meanes, iuſtice, peace, and ciuill honeſty,
protection of body and goods; but
alſo true Religion, and the worſhip of
the true God, and the Goſpell of Chriſt
commanded, and enioyned, and eſtabliſhed

and Statutes.
            Now for a concluſion of the duties of
good Gouernours, let them remember
theſe counſels, directions, and examples.
A worthy King by his laſt will gaue this
aduiſe to his ſon and ſucceſſour, ſaying;
Be deuout in the ſeriuce of God, bee in
heart pittifull, &amp; charitable to the poore,
&amp; comfort thē with thy good deeds, keep
the good Lawes of the Realme, take no
Subſidies, nor releiſe of thy Subiects, but
vpon vrgent neceſſity, &amp; for to profite the

Common-wealth vpon iuſt cauſe voluntarily.
Iulius Pollux, Gouern or of the Emperour
Commodus in his youth, giueth him
theſe titles, calling him Father of the people,
Gentle, Louing, Merciful, Wiſe, Iuſt,
courteous, Couragious, deſpiſing Mony,
not ſubiect to Paſſion, but commanding
ouer himſelfe, ouercomming Luſt, vſing
reaſon, quick of cōceit, Sober, Religious,
carefull for his Subiects, Conſtant, no deceiuer,
adorned with Authority, ready in
his affaires, prouided to doe well, ſlow to
reuenge, Affable, gracious in ſpeech, open-hearted,
a louer of the vertuous, deſirous
of peace, valiant in warre, an example
of good manners to his ſubiects, a
maker of good lawes, and an obſeruer of
the ſame. There was a worthy Table (as
is recorded) found at Thebes, by Marcus
Aurelius, and at his death giuen to his
ſonne as a precious Iewell, conteining
theſe proteſtations and ſentences following:
I neuer exalted the proud rich
man, neither hated the poore that was
iuſt: I neuer denied iuſtice to the poore
for his pouerty, neither pardoned the
wealthy for his riches: I neuer benefited
nor gaue reward for affection, nor puniſhed
for paſſion onely: I neuer ſuffered

euill to eſcape vnpuniſhed, neither goodneſſe
vn-rewarded: I neuer committed
the execution of manifeſt iuſtice to another,
neither determined that which was
difficult by my ſelfe alone: I neuer denied
Iuſtice to him that asked it, neither Mercy
to him that deſerued it: I neuer puniſhed
in anger, nor promiſed benefite in
mirth: I was neuer careleſſe in proſperity,
neither faint-hearted in aduerſity: I
neuer did euill vpon mallice, nor commited
villany for couetouſneſſe: I neuer
opened my gate to the flatterer, nor gaue
care to the backe-biter: I alwayes ſought
to be loued of the good, and feared of the
wicked: Laſtly, I alwayes fauoured the
poore, that were able to doe little, and
God, who was able to do much, fauoured
me.
            A mirrour for Magiſtrates, a patterne
for Princes, and happy are they that in the
end of their gouernement can truely
ſay thus: at leaſt let Gouernours ſtriue
and endeuour to the vtmoſt of their power,
to learne and practiſe theſe leſſons,
and to performe all other duties of their
callings.
            And thus we haue heard the chiefe and
principall doctrines concerning the Magiſtrate,

as the neceſſity, authority, and
dignity, and duty of their callings. This
doctrine is neceſſa
                  •
               y and profitable often
to bee vrged, and ſerueth for many good
vſes. By this the Magiſtrate may be encouraged
and comforted in the execution
of all the parts of his calling, hauing
his allowance and warrant from God.
By this hee is ſtirred vp and prouoked to
zeale, and religion, and holineſſe of life,
ſeeing hee carrieth vpon him the name,
the place and Image of God. By this doctrine
he may ſee the greatneſſe, the difficulty,
and the heauy burden of his calling,
which may bee a cauſe ſufficient to
humble him in the ſight of God and men.
In conſideration wherof he may ſay with
the Apoſtle, who is ſufficient for theſe things?
And let him pray with Salomon;
               1. King. 3. 
               Giue vnto
thy ſeruant an vnderſtanding heart, to iudge
thy people, that he may diſcerne betweene good
and bad: For who is able to iudge this ſo mighty
a people? This doctrine ſerueth alſo to
reproue, conuince, and condemne all rebels,
traytors, and ſeditious ſpirits, which
make inſurrection againſt their lawfull
Soueraigne. And hereby all good ſubiects
are encouraged to loue, honour and
obey their lawfull Rulers; and with this

Queene, to bleſſe and praiſe God for the
happineſſe of good Gouernement. And
conſidering the manifold bleſſings which
wee receiue by good Rulers, as Iuſtice,
peace, puniſhment of euill doers, defence
againſt forraigne and domeſticall foes,
reliefe for the poore, comfort to the
good, fruition of liberty, yea freedome
of the Goſpell, and true Religion. Conſidering
(I ſay) ſo many and ſo great benefites
which wee enioy vnder Chriſtian
Magiſtrates, let vs all with this Queene,
bleſſe God for ſo happy gouernement.
And indeede all true Engliſh Chriſtian
hearts haue iuſt cauſe to reioyce and
praiſe God for his Maieſties happy reigne
amongſt vs, both for his entrance and
continuance. What feares? what perplexities,
and doubts had we at the death
of our late Soueraigne? What boaſting,
what hopes and triumphing of the Aduerſaries?
who made account they had
that day which they long looked and gaped
for.
            They had ſpoken it often, and thought it
often in their hearts, ſaying and thinking
with Eſau;
               Gen. 27. 41. 
               The dayes of mourning for my father
wil come ſhortly, then wil I ſlay my brother
Iacob. The beſt had cauſe to feare, in reſpect

of the horrible and manifold ſinnes of
the Land, deſeruing ſuch a iudgement.
But bleſſed bee God, who cared for vs,
though we little cared for him: He preſently
prouided another gracious Soueraigne
for vs, the next in bloud, a Chriſtian
Prince, a man of wiſedome and experience
in Gouernement. After Moſes
ſucceded Ioſuah, after Dauid Salomon.
            
            
               Let vs ſay with the Prophet:
               Pſal. 4
                     •
                   7. 8. Thou haſt
ſaued vs ô Lord from our aduerſaries, and haſt
put them to confuſion that hate vs: therefore
will we praiſe God continually, &amp; will confeſſe
thy name for euer. It may be ſaid of diuers
other Countries:
               2. Chro. 5. There is no peace to him
that goeth out and in amongſt them, but great
troubles are to all their inhabitants. But it
may be ſaid of vs as the Lord ſaith to Dauid:
1. Chro. 22. 9. 10 &amp;c. Behold a Sonne is borne to thee, which
ſhall bee a man of reſt: for I will giue him reſt
from all his enemies round about, therefore
his name is Salomon. And I will ſend peace
and quietneſſe vpon Iſrael in his daies, &amp;c.
            
               And that which the Prophet Ieremy
ſpeaketh,
               Ier. 23. 5. 6. 
               is fulfilled amongſt vs: Behold
the dayes come (ſaith the Lord) that
I wil
                  •
                raiſe vnto Dauid a righteous branch,
and a King ſhall reigne and proſper, and
ſhall execute iudgment and iuſtice in the earth.

In his daies Iudah ſhall bee ſaued, and Iſraell
ſhall dwell ſafely. How much are wee beholden
to God, that ſo ſoone and ſuddenly
turned our ſorrow and feare into ioy
and gladneſſe, and doth ſtill continue and
confirme the ſame vnto vs? Though
weeping was in the euening,Pſa. 30. 5▪
                yet ioy came in the
morning.Pro. 25. 25. As the cold waters to a weary ſoule,
ſo good newes from a farre countrey did cheere
and refreſh our hearts.Pſa. 147. 12. 13. 14▪ 19. 20. Wherefore praiſe
the Lord, ô Ieruſalem, praiſe thy God, ô Sion,
for he hath made the barre of thy gates ſtrong,
and hath bleſſed thy children within thee: Hee
ſetteth peace in thy borders, and ſatisfieth thee
with the flowre of Wheate: He ſheweth his
word to Iacob, his ſtatutes and his iudgements
to Iſrael. He hath not dealt ſo with euery Nation,
neither haue they knowne his iudgements.
Praiſe yee the Lord. O that we had hearts
to think ſeriouſly of theſe benefits which
we enioy vnder his Maieſty, and that we
were truly thankfull for them: then might
we hope for the continuance and increaſe
of theſe bleſſings: But our iniquities haue
turned away theſe things,Ier. 5. 25. and our ſinnes haue
hidden good things from vs. O that we had
ſuch hearts and tongues that wee might
continually with ioy ſay in our ſoules:
Bleſſed be God for his ſo great and vndeſerued

bleſſings beſtowed vpon this ſinfull
land: bleſſed be his name for all good
Lawes, good Gouernours, and good
Gouernement vnder his gracious Maieſtie.
            
            One thing more I obſerue worthy of
commendation, both in this Queene, and
in Salomon: It is worthy of memory in her
that ſhee made choyce of ſuch a Teacher
and Schoole-maiſter: And indeede ſhee
could not at that time make a better
choyce in the world. Dionyſius made
choyce of Donatus for his Schoole-maiſter
in Grammer, and Victorinus for Rhetoricke,
and Gregery Nazianzene for Theology.
Theophraſtes made choyce of Ariſtotle
to be his teacher: Ariſtotle made
choyce of Plato, and Plato made choyce
of Socrates.
            
            Theſe were all wiſe in their choyce, but
this Queene goeth beyond them all,
chooſing Salomon for her Teacher, who
excelled all men in the world, both in
humane and Diuine wiſedome. And as
ſhe made choyce of him, ſo ſhe was content
to bee taught by him, and profited
much by his inſtructions, as wee haue already
heard. Yea ſhe ſo profited, that in
ſome ſort ſhe teacheth him, and putteth

him in minde of his duety: Shee remembreth
Gods mercies towards him, and
admoniſheth him of the end of his place
and calling.
            And it is worthy of commendation in
Salomon, that as hee was willing to teach
her, ſo he is content to bee taught by her.
And if Salomon had but remembred this
her admonition, it might haue beene a
pretious preſeruatiue againſt thoſe horrible
and groſſe ſinnes, into which he moſt
fearfully fell in his old dayes. But he forgot
the loue and mercies of God towards
him, he forgot his high place and dignity,
he forgot the end why God had placed
him, and the rules of Equity and Righteouſneſſe.
Yet this is worthy of commendation
in him, that at this time hee doth
not, as ſome would haue done, reiect the
admonition of this woman, being farre
his inferiour. He might haue ſaid; Doeſt
thou take vpon thee to teach me, ſeeing
thou cameſt to learne of me? I know my
duty wel enough, I need no teaching. But
Salomon doth take in good part her good
counſell, and doth ſtill moſt louingly and
kindly entertaine her.
            From hence we are to learne, that wee
muſt be content to receiue good counſel,

admonition, and inſtruction from any,
though they be farre our inferiours. Such
as bee truely humble and lowly in their
owne eyes, are content to receiue good
doctrine from meane perſons: they are
not aſhamed to learne of any, yong or
old, learned or vnlearned, good or bad,
men or women, they are not aſhamed to
confeſſe their ignorance, wants and infirmities,
they do not contemne the plaine
ſtile of teaching, which is agreeing to
Scripture: they can be content to receiue
good drinke, not onely in cups of gold
&amp; ſiluer, but alſo in cups of pewter, wood
and ſtone.
            Worthy is that counſell of an ancient
Father:Auguſtin
                     •
                  
                There is no age (ſaith he) too late
to learne that which is needfull; and
though it bee more fit for old men to
teach then to learne, yet it is better to
learne then to be ignorant. Another ſaith,
It is a thing I deſire,Gregory. and is moſt worthy,
to learne euen to my laſt age, becauſe that
no age is ſo ſufficient to learne throughly
all that we need.Hug
                     •
                  . Againe ſaith another, Be
willing to learne of all that which thou
knowneſt not thy ſelfe; becauſe humility
can make that common to thee which
Nature hath made proper to any: thou

ſhalt be wiſer then all, if thou bee willing
to learne of all: they are moſt rich of all,
which receiue from all.Exod. 18▪
                
               Moſes was content
to hearken to the counſell of his Father-in-law
in chooſing officers to be aſſiſtant
to him in his great charge.1. Sam. 25. 
               Dauid
receiueth and accepteth the counſell of
Abigail a woman, and bleſſeth her in her
counſell.2. King. 5▪ 3. 13. 
               Naaman the Syrian hearkeneth
to the counſell of his maid, wiſhing him
to ſend to Eliſha for the curing of his leproſie;
and the ſame noble man obeyed
the counſell of his ſeruants aduiſing him
to do as the Prophet bad him.Luke 2. 19. The bleſſed
virgin was content to receiue inſtruction
from the Sheapheards, of thoſe things
which ſhee knew before.Act. 18. 24. 25. 26. 
               Apollos, an eloquent
man, mighty in the Scriptures, inſtructed
in the way of the Lord, feruent in
the ſpirit, is content to receiue further inſtruction
from Aquila and Priſcilla, which
were far his inferiors. The Apoſtle wiſheth
the Coloſſians to put Archippus in mind
of his duty, wiſhing them to ſay to Archippus:
               Col. 4. 17▪
                
               Take heed to the Miniſtery that thou
bast receiued in the Lord, that thou fulfill it.
            
            The vſe of this doctrine is chiefly for
reproofe of proud and ſcornfull perſons,
which either ſcorne all inſtructions, or at

leaſt they reiect the counſels of meane
perſons, and of their inferiours. Gouernours
ſcorne to learne of their ſubiects,
the old diſdaine to learne of the yonger,
parents wil not hearken to their children,
no
                  •
                maiſters to their ſeruants: Miniſters
ſcorne to receiue admonition from the
people; yea from their fellow-miniſters,
if they be of meaner gifts, or leſſe account
in the world. And this is the cauſe that ſo
many holy counſels and Sermons of godly
Miniſters are reiected, or little regarded,
becauſe they themſelues are men of
no great eſtimation in the world. Worthy
is that example of the Eunuch, Treaſurer
of Aethiopia, who did ſo willingly
hearken to Philip,
               Acts 8. 30. 31. and kindly entertaine
him: for this noble man reading the Prophet
Eſay in his Chariot, being demanded
of Philip, if he vnderſtood that hee read:
hee did not taunt nor ſcorne this poore
Preacher, but confeſſed his ignorance, &amp;
willingneſſe to learne, and kindly entertained
Philip, &amp; took him into the chariot
with him. It is pride of heart, and want
of humility, that cauſeth men to ſcorne
good inſtructions from meane perſons,
The Lord ſendeth ſuch proud men to
the very beaſtes, to learne from them.

               The Oxe knoweth his owner (ſaith he) and the
Aſſe his Maiſters cribbe,
               Iſay. 1. 3. 
               but Iſrael hath
not knowne.
               Ier. 8. 7. Againe, the Storke in the Aire
knoweth her appointed times; the Turtle, the
Crane, and the Swallow, obſerue the time of
their comming, but my people knoweth not the
iudgement of the Lord.
               Iob. 12. 7. And Iob ſaith; Aske
now the beaſts and they ſhall teach thee, and
the fowles of the heauen and they ſhall tell
thee. Our Sauiour Chriſt, to draw his
Diſciples to humility, ſetteth a child before
them to bee their Teacher, ſaying:
Verily I ſay vnto you,
               Mat. 18. 3. 4. 
               except yee bee conuerted
and become as little children, ye cannot enter
into the Kingdome of heauen; whoſoeuer
therefore ſhall humble himſelfe as this little
child the ſame is the greateſt in the Kingdome
of heauen. Wee muſt bee lowly,
tractable, docible, and willing to learne,
as good children are. Salomon, ſo execellent
a man, ſo extraordinarily wiſe, ſo famous
in all learning, is content to receiue
the inſtruction and admonition of
this woman, a ſtranger, his ſcholler, nothing
comparable to him in any grace,
yet doth hee take in good part her counſell,
teaching him nothing but that which
he knew well enough before.
            And thus at laſt we haue gone through

and finiſhed, as wee could, this ſhort,
ſweete and worthy Story, wherein wee
haue laid before our eyes an example of
a bleſſed Queene, of a bleſſed Hearer, of
a bleſſed Teacher, and of a bleſſed King.
Now the Lord, the moſt wiſe God, the
Father of all good giftes, make vs all the
true children and ſchollers of true Wiſedome,
that wee may eſteeme that as our
chiefe felicity in earth; that ſo the King
in ruling, the Nobles and Magiſtrates in
aſſiſting, Miniſters in teaching, People in
hearing and obeying, may bee truely
bleſſed in this life, and fully bleſſed for
euer in the life to come, in the place of
eternall bleſſedneſſe, in the Kindome of
the true Salomon CHRIST IESVS
who ſitteth at the right hand of his
Father, and with Equity and
Righteouſneſſe ſhall iudge
the quicke and dead at
his appearing.
Amen.
            
            FINIS.
