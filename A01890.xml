            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

            TO THE IVDICIOVS AND COVRTEOVS READER.
            
               THou hast here (courteous Reader) my Authours Epistle Dedicatorie: which both for the Elegancy thereof, and proprietie to this present Discourse, I haue translated into English, the rather for that the Authour hath learnedly laid-downe his Motiues both to the Matter and Metricall Method thereof. Which as they most iustly may and doe protect him from the Prauitie of detracting Malignitie: So I hope they will with no lesse indifferencie (my Cause and Case being the same in the Matter, though farre inferiour in the Manner) Patronize me, and Apologize for me against the Malice of muttering Momus. Thus hoping the best in the generous and iudicious, disdayning the worst in the degenerous and inscitious. I rest
            
               Thine Io. VICARS.
            
         
         
            
            The Authours Epistle Dedicatorie to the right Honorable Sir ROBERT NANTON, Knight, Principall Secretarie to the State, and one of his Maiesties most Honourable priuie Councell.
            
               MAny things there be (right Honourable) which vilifie and diminish the faith of Romes Religion, which fortifie and garnish ours. And yet indeed it is a very miserable and deplorable thing, that in matter of Religion, mens mindes and iudgements should still hang wauering and anxiously tottering as a Wedge of Steele betweene two attractiue Loadestones; and not to be maturely and firmely confirmed in the indubitable orthodox Faith and Religion. When therefore I had adapted and addicted my mind to the studie of Diuinitie, and afterward setled my serious inquisition vpon Controuersies of Faith: Poperie most perspicuously seemed to me, to be nothing else, but a certaine pompous &amp; Maiesticke Monarchie, begotten by Ambition, bred and fed vp by Superstition, blocked-vp and fortified by Tyranny, enlarged and propagated both by the Mammon of the World, and fraudulent Fabrication of the Pseudo-Clergie.
            
            Many most learned Authours haue by their worthy Writings notably shaken this (I say not Religion, but) Relegation or Banishment of true Religion: and may It now (with your Honours good liking) put on a versified Vesture, and by this my Edition and Dedication to your

Honour, come forth, yet more grossely guiltie from me.
            
               Theodorite writes of one Ephres of Syrus an Iland in Asia, who long since composed in diuers kinds of Verses, whatsoeuer appertained to Pietie and Religion: That so they might the more feruently be affected and earnestly desired. The same doth Socrates and Sozomen affirme of Apollinarius; And Gregory Nyssen of Basil and of Nazianzen. Of more proximious and moderne times also Eobanus of Hesse, Beza, Bucanan, and very many more did accomodate themselues (as it were, with a certaine kinde of delightfull Sawce and Seasoning of the Truth) to the illustration and setting forth of the Booke of Psalmes in Verse.
            
            
               
                  ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰
                (as Pindarus) Let not then the stormie Stones of dire Detraction be throwne at me, if I in imitation of those worthy imitable Authours haue in verse composed Hoc 
                     ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰
                   Religionis argumentum, This often controuerted Subiect of Religion.
            
            The most exquisitely learned Interpreters doe call the Booke of Psalmes, the most sacred sugred Poeme of Gods blessed Spirit; And they giue the reason why Almightie God would haue so excellent a Treasure of his Church to be contriued and contained in verse, viz. 
               
                  ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰
               , that it might be as a Bait to allure and entice men to facile obedience thereunto. The same also is most manifest that Satan (as he is Operum Dei 
               
                  ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰
                the Ape of Gods Actions) was wont to enfold, wreathe and winde-vp in Verse, all his Oracles which in former ages he vsed to deliuer by his Pythons or Sybils, that by this meanes they might be the more pleasant and acceptable to those which enquired after them. I omit, that Saint Paul out of certaine Poets, as Aratus, Menander and Epimenedes,
               
quoted diuers Testimonies or amplifications, and not out of any other Heathenish Authors, as neere as I can obserue in his Epistles.
            
            Once also heretofore I my selfe composed a Module in Latine-Verse, vnder the Title of A Combate betweene the Flesh and the Spirit; or, The Warfare of a Christian Souldier. Of our holy Martyrs; And of The miseries of this miserable Life; Since which time, I with Nazianzen 
               
                  ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰
               : haue cast and prostrated this my Muse at my Sauiours feet, submitting and addicting it wholly to his seruice, and to the setting forth of his pure Doctrine. And whilest I read the elaborate Labours and Diatribae of Diuines, and at intermissiue houres ruminated what I had read; with most feruent desire and full delight, I forthwith put my selfe vpon a versifying Veine, thereby (as well as I might) to strengthen and assist my weake and vntrusty memorie.
            The Fruit of this my Labour I humbly Deuote, Dedicate and Consecrate to you (Right Honourable) whom I euer knew (since I euer knew any thing) most exquisitely endued, and adorned, furnisht and accomplisht with all generous and ingenious Vertues and Discipline. Whence, th
                  â€¢
                reason why his Maiesty made you his worthy Principall Secretarie, cannot be Secretly hidden, but most conspicuously euident, to me, to all others: But by this Poeme, the Proeme of my principall intention is, sincerely to lay downe a perpetuall Pledge, and merited Memory of my obsequious obseruance of that great Fauour and Courtesie, wherewith your Honour hath euer graced and embraced mee: And of that firme Faith, which I heere endeuour to defend, and wherein I am most certainely assured, you are most confidently and immoueably settled.
            
               But I trust your Honourable Courtesie will conniue at and excuse me, if (as I am Acrior paulÃ² 
               
                  ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰
               , a somewhat sharp and tart Opposite to the Antichristian-Crew) the syllables and sentences in diuers places being transposed and alternated, I seeme to say &amp; reiterate one and the same thing: Since that euen from my first vndertaking of this Worke thus once vndertaken, I vndertooke to display and disperse the fragrant and odoriferous Flowers of various Authors, and not onely to write diuers things, but to write them diuers waies, and truely to depaint the power of Popery to be no lesse sumptuously spacious, than auariciously Capacious.
            
            But aboue all, my heart hath eagerly exasperated my Hand and ready Pen (to the vtmost of my power) to pull downe the intolerable and abominable Pride of Rome: whereby her Babylonicall Bishops haue with the Hornes of their Insolency, butted at the Princes of the Earth, shewing themselues to be nothing else, indeed, than the sirely Sons of Saturne, and an aspiring Off-spring of robustious combustious Phaetontine haughty Spirits.
            
            Neither shall the Reader finde heere any flourishing veines or straines of painted Poetry and fabulous Fictions: My prime purpose, in the fashioning and framing of this Honey-Combe, being, to furnish it with a more beautifull Cluster of Theologie, than a bountifull Crop of Poesie.
            
            Nor haue I been ambitiously busie, to cite my Authors Names on the Margines: For, what I write, I write to those, who (as Saint Augustine saies, are willing to reade, and wise to vnderstand; and who together with mee, doe either already know, or easily may know, whatsoeuer I haue writ.
            
               Finally, Heere, you ha

               e neither a few, nor all matters touching the Romish Religion; Let whoso will, giue my Booke a Bill of Diuorce: But from your right Honourable Humanity, and Customary Courtesie, I vndoubtedly expect, and hope to find, Fauour for what I haue done, and Pardon for what I haue pretermitted and left vndone.

               Rome striues, contriues, how Popes may vncontrold,
               Solely and wholly, Keyes, Crownes, Scepters hold.
            
            
               ROME, the Worlds wonder, Stage of Mitred Bands,
            
            Hath Papall Power of Empire in hir Hands:
            
            For, heere, the Pope succeeds in Peters Right
               â–ª
            
            Which is as cleere at Noone, as 'tis at Night.
            
            The High-Priests Chaire, heere, Peter placed hath;
            But, this, (me thinkes) smels more of Fame than Faith.
            
            Heere, on a seuen-fold Beast, the treble Beast,
            
            With triple-Crowne doth ride, each solemne Feast.
            
            Yea, heere, the Babylonish Bawd most fine,
            A Scarlet Godhead, with rich Iemmes doth shine.
            
               Fie, fie, poore Peter, and penurious Paul,
            
            Doe ye not blush presumptuously to call
            Your selues the Popes great Grand-sires? y'are to blame,
            That you thus thinke his Holinesse to shame.
            Alas, y'are Both deceiu'd, his Papall Throne
            
            Buds, blowes, and blossomes, bigge and broad is growne;
            Your Slaue of Slaues, is now a Lord of Lords,
            
            The best of Men no equall Him affords.
            Logicke lacks Phrases to define your Pope,
            He must haue more then Categories scope;
            Hee's yet not found, can find

               Romes power's distinct, from other powers all,
            Of all Powers else, Romes hath no Generall.
            The Pope is peerelesse, Rome knowes none more Royall;
            
               This, Realmes, He Men, surmounts past all deniall.

            All Sacred things their Sacred Pope's aboue;
            To Him nought's Sacred, but Golds Sacred loue.
            
               Peter, t' exceede, more than succeed, he ioyes:
            Tenths of his Honour, none (almost) enioyes.
            His Sea's a Sea of Wealth: But let me chuse
            A Man to grace his place; This, Popes refuse.
            And why alone to Peter's this Charge giuen?
            Why are the Rest from State and Office driuen?
            
               In Paul, not any, many spots in Peter
            
            We find; why then, for Paul was't not much meeter?
            At least, Saint Iohn, whom Christ esteemed Best,
            Ought to be priz'd, preferr'd before the Rest.
            Yet Peter ne're was deckt with Iems and Gold;
            Was no Key-keeper, no Sword-bearer bold,
            Rode not with Strappes and Trappes, in Scarlet Gownes;
            Not dawb'd with Pearles, or Princely golden Crownes.

            Meekenesse gaue to Saint Peter Primacy;
            An humble mind was his Priority.
            
               Peter a Fisher, Peters Impe a Fighter;
            A Stone was Peters Throne, the Heau'ns his Mitre.
            And what was Paul, euen equall to the best;
            Greater than he, not any of the rest.
            Yet he for Christs sake, ioyes in bonds and blowes:
            
               ErgÃ´, the Pope is greater than Both Those.
            
            Christ of a Heauenly, not an earthly Throne,
            
            Had the Fee-simple; Peter, other, None.
            
            If Christ had heere no Kingdome, how should Hee
            Place Peter, where Himselfe would neuer be?
            And is't not strange, Heau'ns Kingdomes Key should ope
            The doores of Earthly Kingdomes to the Pope?
            He which so grossely guls, beguiles each Nation,
            Besots himselfe with Reasons depriuation.
            Alas, fond Flash, Ã´ earthly glory shallow!
            What wry-waies, by-waies tak'st thou, Christ to follow?
            Alas, they void not Christs, but Worlds offence;
            Which vse to chuse such carnall sottish Sence.
            
               What Christ prescribes, That Anti-Christ proscribes;
            Is't like, that Christ this Function him ascribes?
            
            What Right of Title, Titles-Right is there,
            Where nought, but Shew of Title doth appeare?
            As Spend-thrifts boast of Title, All being gone;
            So, insubstantiate Shades Popes build vpon.
            He faineth Christ, but followes Satan still;
            Serues God in Words, denies him in his Will.
            
            Th' Apostate Priest sits oft in Peters Chaire;
            Whom to call Pope, not Pius, we may dare.
            As Polypus sticks to each Rocke of's shape;
            And by that craft, few fish his Iawes doe scape:
            So, forging, faining, Peter, Christ, Faiths Rocke,
            His Pseudo-founded Faith th'vnwise doth mocke.
            The Ground-worke's hid, the top is seene to all;
            To what end tend these wiles Pontificall?
            The reason's plaine, and Pluto's paths lye ope;
            What of this false Profession is the Scope?
            Now then behold the Popes Monarchike might;
            Which, Hee, by Christs allowance claimes as Right.
            This Heau'nly Vice-roy, Peters proper Heire:

            The honour due to great Iehouah's Name?
            Why maist not call him Iupiter, Earth's Thunder,
            Yea Elohim? the Worlds great God of Wonder?
            
               Vnto the

               Mount (that Mounte-banke saies plaine)
            I lift mine Eyes which doth my state sustaine.
            That all the World must bow to th' Pope of Rome,
            Who e're beleeues not, he to hell doth doome.
            As at a becke, the Lord of heauen rules All:
            So, here, his Sheepe, the Pope hath at a call.
            This Priestly Pilot, (for, the Church, 'tis knowne,
            Is like a Ship) Christs Ship can rule alone.
            He which the Popes pipe knowes not perfectly,
            Is none of this great Shepheards Sheepe surely.
            Others Rule's finite; his is infinite:
            Theirs, but a Beame of his All-supreme Light.
            
            His patent Prouince both for Grace and Place,
            
            
               Specious and spacious, bowes before his face.
            As with huge Waues, the Sea, small dewes doth sup:
            So his great Power, lesse Powers deuoures, drinks vp.
            
            Therefore He in submission, to him holds,
            Captaines, Commanders, Shepheards, Sheepe, Sheepe-folds.
            He's poore, can count his flockes: this Shepheard great,

               Councels and sacred Synods he excels;
            An hyperbolicke-Priest in Gods house dwels.
            This Romish Briareus; Hydra fell,
            For Hands and Head, to rule, doth all excell.
            To th' Councell, this Cosmopolite once came,
            A Iudge, a Partie, Guiltie, One, the Same.
            
            But what need Councels, when their Pope Diuine

               O yes; by Councels, is the right way knowne,
            To Him which hath sound iudgements praise alone.
            Euen He alone, which without Councels aid,
            Remoues Faiths Rubs, and Wrackes, by doubts displaid.
            To Peters chaire Errour can ne're come neere;
            Which, that 
                  â€¢
               he Pope enioyes, doth plaine appeare.
            He may doe-ill, not Erre, in any case:
            If once He sit in that All-prying Place.
            If Baalam, Caiaphas, Right did Prophetize:
            Why may not wicked Popes doe so likewise?
            Yea though they Pilate, Iudas base, transcend:
            Yet may a traiterous Pope, be Faiths good Friend.
            
            He sweares to Lies, by Lying oft deceiues:
            Yet, his loose tongue to Faith stickes-fast and cleaues.
            Let Alexander, Iulius, witnesse beare:
            Whose fained Faith, firm'd and infringed were;
            Who got the Popedome Foxe-like, craftily;
            Reign'd like a Lion, like a Dogge did die.
            He that Christs Court and Sheepe-cote thus doth gaine,
            Is not a Friend, but Fiend; no Balme, but Bane.
            
            That Swines-snout, Sergius, Sergeant of the deuill;
            Was to his Chaire a Scoffe, a Scurffe most euill.
            
               Pius the fifth, Im-pius, within, without,
            
            How 'gainst Eliza, shot he darts, about?
            
               Vrbane the third, a Bane, A-bad-one, right;
            Strange Popish chaos caus'd by furious fight.
            That Brand of Hell, foule Heldebrand also:
            With what mad mischiefes did he ouerflow?
            Christ chain'd vp Satan, but thy Potentate,
            O Rome, doth let him loose to deuorate.
            That Christ Church then, may flourish, firmely stand,
            'Tis time the Pope were puld downe out of hand.
            
               O how this Prelate differs from that Prince,
            
            Which was both poore and pure in Innocence?
            Surely this Worlds Arch-Metropolitan,
            Seekes somewhat more then Christ, not knowne to man.
            For, Christ to be Faiths head, when was it read?
            Yet this Arch-father must be faiths Arch-head.

            His Masticke and Stigmaticke-Slaues doe dare,
            To giue the Pope, what ere be ne're so rare.
            
               Most-holy, Great'st, Supreme, Superlatiues,

            Great Alexander, Pompey, Charles the Great:
            But he's most-Mightie, h'as the Greatest seate.
            Christ prayes to God, and sayes, O holy-Father:
            To th' Pope, his Shauelings say, Most-Holy, rather.
            We must not mint these termes, or vse lesse phrases:
            
               Diminitiues deduct from his high praises.
            Of Peters Titles is not lost a tittle,
            
            Nor from the Popes praise wanteth the least little.
            Romes Monkish-mad-men crouch vpon their knee,
            To kisse his Seate, his Feet, for so 't must be.
            Thus not the Prime, but Supreme Power is sought,
            And vnto God he's almost equall thought.

            What haue Kings done, what angry God displeas'd,
            To be of Power, by Papall power eas'd?
            But what's the Pope to th' Prince? Crosse-Caps to Crownes?
            
            Are Swords for Peter? Scepters fit for Clownes?

            This set in Heauen, that (Earth) set ouer thee.
            A Gulfe's betweene these Heads, agree ne're shall:
            God's sp'rituall head, the Popes materiall.
            Christs Kingdome is ith' world inuisible:

                did Christs Spouse, two heads, two husbands know:
            Christ onely her deere pheere, the Church doth owe.
            If Anti-Christ (pray tell me) should be mad,
            Could Christ be ioyn'd to such a head, so bad?
            Againe, Christ left his Church much Goods, most good:
            (Th' are so indeed, since purchast with his blood)
            If Christ, his Church so rich a dowrie gaue;
            From thee (proud Pope) what new-found wealth may't haue?
            Art thou the Churches Head? Heart, Corps, and all,
            
            (Which were blasphemous) then we might thee call.
            And if the Pope were Head, the Church would be
            Headlesse, like Dagon, in Popes Vacancie.
            Now, as the Body, with the Head doth die:
            The Pope once dead, the Flocke must liuelesse lie.
            Which is not so in Christ, who though once dead;
            Yet then did liue, as our spirituall head.
            
            See then ambitious vilely vicious Pope:
            The ruine of thy iarres, thy warres, thy hope.
            And yet this great Anteus of proud Rome,
            Doth stoutly from his fals newforce resume.
            With Wit argute, will quicke dispute, and spit,
            At Right, and Reason, and all Rules of it.
            Thus Rome; Are Priests held Heads? the Pope Priests Head?
            
            May not then Popes the Heads of Heads be sed?
            
               This shallow Reason reasonlesse and wrong,
            Proues not chiefe Power to Popes, for to belong.
            Can any Pastor be all Pastors chiefe?
            (But Christ alone) to giue his Church reliefe?
            On whom so great doth Romes great Head subsist?
            What one head can so many heads assist?
            O fond befooling of mens fantasie:
            To shape, to set vp such a prodigie.
            For, 'tis aboue, beyond, 'gainst, deepe conceit,
            Of all mens heads to make one head so great.
            And it may be (nor is this may be vaine)
            This grosse-head doth much swelling sores containe.
            That part's enorme doth not conforme to th'rest:
            And can the sound the sicke part well digest?
            So when weake frames by rotten props are staid,
            These being crackt, the worke is wrackt, decaid.
            O worke vnworthy, worthy hatred still!
            Than which there's nought more crosse to Gods blest will.
            O Peters lawlesse heire, Christs counterfeit!
            Full of Satanicke iugling, slie deceit.
            O hideous, heinous Monster, blinde, mishapen;
            In Gods Church, as God, for God, oft mistaken.
            What helpe can this base helplesse Man of Sinne,
            Thy deadly foe (O Christ) to thee bring in?
            What is a Waue to th' Sea; to th' Wood, one Tree?
            
            A Torch, to th' Sunne, Mans helpe, O God to thee?
            He which would thus Christs loue and labour minish:
            Doth but a Worke of scoffe and laughter finish.
            This botching Bishop, Romish prodigall;
            Makes either Toyes, or naught, or nought at all.
            And I much maruell, all the World throughout,
            Bring not their aide, to bring this worke about.
            
               A vselesse Key, on's Head a treble Twist;
            A formall Crooke, fatall, officious Fist:
            
            These are Romes high Priests most peculiar Signes;
            To these rare Workes himselfe he most enclines.
            Alas, his Brow is Brasse, Marble his Minde;
            Which, to Christs Body, thinkes this head's not ioyn'd.
            For to this high-topt Towre of Babels throne,
            The Churches Guide, Gods Guard, are linkt in one.

            Is Pluto prince, doth he a Vicar need?
            Thou then, proud Pope, maist fitly him succeed.
            How oft (O Rome) hast thou thy Head expeld?
            How many Heads, at once, hath thy chaire held?
            How oft with broiles hath thy false Church beene rent?
            By double, treble Heads most turbulent.

            Being cause of much deceit and deadly smart.

            When a faire Popesse did i'th' Chaire reside?
            When falsely termed Iohn, indeed, Pope Ioane,
            
            By her foule Birth, true Whore of Rome was knowne?
            Shee was indeed Romes Bishoppesse, not Head:

            Surely, that day vncloudy did not shine.
            What? could a Woman, Where, the Chaire inherit?
            
               
                  Androgini, populi, vtrisque Naturae.
               
               Androginus might it more iustly merit.
            But (first it may be) She a Man was knowne
            But chang'd her Sex, and was a Woman growne:
            For, thus writ 
                  Dialogo 10. pag. 47. 
               Cope, scarce copious in capacity,
            Whose wit herein, sauour'd of much Fooleacity.
            This, this was that Ecliptick Line, once gliding,
            Betweene Romes Skie, and Popish Zodiacke biding.
            But yet a Whore (the Salick Law well held)
            Should from the Chaire, at least, haue bin expell'd.
            I know, Rome holds this fact, a faigned Lye:
            Though faithfull Authors doe it iustifie.
            But, now, that neuer Foemale Popes may raigne,
            Their Manhood, first, by fruitfull Signes is plaine.
            But tell me this, Ghostly Gargantua;
            Is Christ thy Head? He is (no doubt) thou'lt say:
            Sufficeth th
                  â€¢â€¢
               e, this Head? Yes: Well, why then,
            As well as thee, not Mee, and other Men?
            
            
               If any rouing Reason fauours Thee,
            Or fits thy Foe; why may't not stand for mee?
            
               Silenus and his drunken Droues heere stagger:
            This cunning Crafts-man must with Reason swagger.
            Wherefore, hence-forth this triple-crowned Deity,
            Shall ere, be held a Pseudo-Popish Monarchy.
            
            The Capitall great Logger-head of all;
            Trascendent Head, huge, right Pontificall;
            Or els a Heape of Heads, a Chaos rude:
            Such Head, such heape, nor wit, nor writ, ere shew'd.
            The Rule that May-tide Lords of Mis-rule finde,
            Such Lord, such Lawes let be to Rome assign'd.
            If of Christs Body Popes bee Head; by right,
            They may, as well, be Health, Heart, Life, Light, Sight.
            
            But if no other Basis can be laid:
            No other Head may heere on Earth be made.
            Well, pur-blind Bayard, one day thou shalt raigne:
            And headlesse, Dagon-like, thy Blinde maintaine.
            When all Sun-shunning Owles, one huge Head haue;
            Thou shalt be then, the Worlds Block-head most braue.
            But, in all ancient Fathers, ne're was read,
            That of Christs Body any Priest was Head:
            Christ left his Church, true Treasure to enioy:
            What wealth did Christ to the Popes vse employ?
            Three Creedes the pristine Fathers left behind:
            In none of them, Popes supreme power we find.
            Nor ere did they which did our Creedes indite,
            Of Apostolique Proto-Popes ought write.
            Surely, the Popes Prerogatiues most high,
            They neuer saw, or seene, sham'd to descry.
            Hee, then; which hath bin Head, of's Iay-like pride,
            Shall be made bare, the world shall him deride.
            
               Prize not, fond Foole, thy Torch aboue Sols light:
            Ther's no such need of Popes Vicegerent might.
            What ere is Chiefe, is Head, Heads Riuals hate:
            One Head, cannot Another tolerate.
            This Fable then of Peters Power, thus failes;
            Which, with Saint Peters Chaire, are old-Wines, tales.
         
         
            
            OF THE AVTHORITY OF THE POPE OF ROME.
            THE SECOND SATYRE.
            
               The ARGVMENT.
               Heauen is hemm'd in; Seaes Waues haue Walls, a Bound;
               But, the Popes Power hath no Enclosure found.
            
            OF all the World Romes Pope is President:
            Hee rules the Reines of rouing Regiment.
            
            All Power to Popes (witnesse a Pope) is giuen;
            Of right, of wrong, on Earth, in Hell, in Heauen.
            
            Hee giues, hee takes, makes rich, makes poore, high, low:
            
               Makes vowes, breaks vowes, makes bloody battailes grow.
            Hee's Frantick, frets, Mars-like molesteth all:
            With two two-edged Swords, doth fight and brawle.
            Yet, this prodigious Priest does all by Law:
            All well, for why? he Errour neuer saw.
            Hee'le turne, turne backe, turne topsie-turuie quite;
            And yet can ne're doe ought but iust and right.
            And this high-Priest may, with due Worthinesse,
            Call the whole world his proper Diocesse.

               Ouid hath this Dogmatically showne;
            The World, and Romes large Reach are both but one.
            
               Hee's out of Natures Fold, Hee's Hee-Alone:
            Colleague or Legall-Rites, the Pope knowes none.
            Hee, Hee's the Worlds Prince, Prelate, high 'boue all:
            Rapt vp ith' Clouds, of Starres the principall.
            This Priestly Turret, Apostolique Head,
            Can (vnder Christ) by none be equalled.
            Thus Romes proud Chaire or takes, or makes Elated:
            With such strange pride Romes Titan is sufflated.
            
               Pleasing things, pious; impious must bee,
            What ere displease; this is the Popes Decree.
            
            His Thunder, Earth; His Furies fright euen Hell:
            Except what-ere he doth, you deeme done well.
            His Lawlesse Kings vnder his Lawes to thrall,
            Is his Great, greater, greatest worke of all.
            This large Law-Giuer, Guider, Rights Vmpire;
            But what is iust, can nought affect, desire.
            If Land to Sea he ioyne, and Sea to Land:

                  aphas cals Right, for right must stand.
            He builds, vnbuilds, plaies fast and loose with Law:
            And who complaines, he soone restraines with Awe.
            Lo, to the World the Pope (VVorlds Sol, most bright)
            Is come; yet nien loue Darknesse more than Light.
            Surely, not hee, to Peters pompe which hies,
            Creates a Pope; but which Popes Deifies.
            Hee's th'only Man, which nobly, notably,
            
            Himselfe before All Men can magnifie.
            Hee may be said, and with the finger showne,
            Conspicuous Christ, Visible God alone.
            Hee hath, and must haue, wealth, far more than Kings:
            For why? Romes Chaire must want no needfull things.
            
               Hee must haue Kings their Scepters to lay downe;
            And from his Feete to fetch their regall Crowne.
            And reason good, to Miters, Crownes should creepe:
            The Miter, not the Crowne, makes Priests for Sheepe.
            He hath those firme Foundations of Romes See:
            
            Which Peter held, and by God settled bee.
            Hee of all Kingdomes hath the supreme Grace:
            And hee (O Christ) holds, heere, thy stead and Place.
            
            Hee must not onely bee, of Councels, Head;
            But he alone would bee in Councels stead.
            
            Hee can of Scriptures raine downe showers thicke:
            That at his words Heretikes perish quicke.
            'Tis no great fault if he false Latine speake.
            And with

            Hee which dares say, this Lawier's not best able
            To cleere all doubts; must be held execrable.
            Though hee (most blockish) faile ith' Premises,
            
            Yet iustly he concludes all businesses.
            If he the right-hand call the left; Night, Day;
            Thou must not dare his Holinesse gaine-say:
            This is that great Ring-leader to the Rest;
            Whose Steps to tread, his Bishops must be prest.
            Thy guilt, is grieuous, grosse, abominable,
            If what he doth, thou deeme not warrantable.
            Hee can, as eas'ly, from his thundring Throne,
            Spoile Hereticks, as Nut-shells with a Stone:
            Harke, Heretike, which scorn'st Romes Sacrifices:
            Burne, Heretike, which stop'st Popes Enterprises.
            Hee scornes a Iudge to plead in his Defence:
            Hee's Holier, Higher, than the highst offence.
            All must to him be bare, and bend the knee;
            But he to none, of ne're so high degreee.
            
               Since hee hath power All to proscribe, indite:
            Spare the Popes Crimes; you which of Times doe write.
            To th' Buyer nought's more deare, more deere Reliefe:
            Than His in Wax, in Lead, ith' Bull and Briefe.
            
            Fit Fellows for him, are th' Arch-Angels bright:
            Namely, good Michael, soueraigne Gabriels might.
            His onely Lust is Law most iust and pure;
            All right made gainst him, hee'l by right abiure.
            
               Without, aboue, cleane contrary to Right:
            His Canons hold, all things are in his might.
            
               Others may plead, Hee Lawes prescribes, alone;
            Euen hee which hath the prime Pontifick Throne.
            Within a Shell thou maist the Sea containe:

            And who is he that 'gainst Popes pleasure speakes?

               These, truely, these are holy Popes best Signes:
            
               These, Peter had, these God to them assignes.
            Who'le then deny (but he that's well in's wits)
            But Popes to be Gods Stewards, well befits?
            He can giue Heau'n to th' Heinous, and bestow
            Faiths Crowne on those, in treason that oreflow.
            
               Falshood is Faith; true Worship, Coniuration:
            (So please the Pope) and Truth, Equiuocation.
            
            If by one-Plot the Publike-weale had perisht:
            So please the Pope; that-Plot must needs be cherisht.
            If Parricides in Parents sides, their sword
            Should sheath; the Pope quicke pardon could afford.
            Yea, all, Law-breakers shall be faultlesse held:
            So please the Pope; who Lawes doth rule and weild.
            
               Rule's, out of Rule; Law, Lawlesse, guidelesse, all:
            When pleaseth this High-Priest Pontificall.
            And though 'gainst Christ, blaspemous words be spoke;
            (If from his holy-Mouth) they turne to smoke:
            That poorely-pure Leo the tenth durst say:
            What talke we of that Tale of Christ, I pray?
            O holy Speech; and for Faiths Fostrer fit:
            For him which in the High-Priests Chaire doth sit.
            It shewes indeed (Monarchicke-Pope) most plaine;
            Of Christ, thou, nought but Title dost retaine.
            Thus hast thou (Thou all-daring impious wight)
            Thy gastly Gorgons, sottish Sects, to fright;
            Thou Kingdomes, Kings, dost thus, tame, terrifie:
            Thus mak'st thou foes yeeld most submissiuely.
            Thus vnto thee (witnesse thy selfe) was giuen
            Pow'r of the double-slicing Sword, from heau'n.
            If, in one-hand, that two-fold brandisht Blade
            
            Thou shake, day, night, light, darkenes; straight is made.
            All's become comely, which vncomely seem'd,
            If Crownes be thine, if th' Ephod such be deem'd.
            But here, the Moralists, facetious Fable
            Seemes, thee, to paint, a Iugler admirable:
            While the fond Camell wisht for Hornes, deni'd;
            His fore-giuen Eares he lost, for's foolish pride:
            So whilst the Pope both Swords to gripe doth gape;
            Shortly he shall lose both, desert of Rape.
            Thus, thus 'tis plaine (or I my selfe deceiue)
            All's his that Christ did to prime Peter leaue.
            The Pope is Peters Heire of All; likewise,
            As Prince of Priests he thus doth Peterize.
            
            Nor God nor Man, nor both; but twixt both dubious:
            A two-legg'd Thing, monstrous, amphibious.
            
               A Semi-god, two natures, Ianus-Elfe:
            To Pet'r as like as Peter's to himselfe.
            Him God ordain'd to sit in Iudgement seate:

            When of Christs Church to Heires their parts were made
            
               All fell to th' Pope (as pilfering Popes haue said.)
            He's heau'ns Key-Keeper and House-Keeper great:
            To Saints in heau'n, he giues, gai

            To hells deepe dungeon he throwes desperately,
            Infinite Soules; yet none dare aske him why.
            White into blacke, old, new; squares into rounds
            He turnes; but mutter, and he thee confounds.
            Thou but whetst wrath, digg'st flames, the Lion sharest:
            With taunting termes, if chide the Pope thou darest.
            If, once, this Lion, big Behemoth roare,
            His breath will blast and beat thee o're and o're.
            Then, O dire Fate, too late, thou shalt be taught;
            What 'tis this Halfe-man-God, to set at nought,
            Maturely, then (lest his fierce fury boyle)
            
               Slacke, and draw-backe the fuell of thy spoyle.
            And if thou loue thy selfe vnboyled, yet,
            Quickly, submissely, run to Rome, 'tis fit.
            For (I thinke sure) thou scarce secure canst be:
            When night and day such dangers threaten thee.
            O supreme Prelate, Earths God, sacred Sire:
            Didst thou for this Christs Sheepefold thus acquire?
            To Peters chaire, was such fierce fury giuen?
            Are these mens duties seruices, of Heauen?
            Art Thou Christs Tipe? dost Thou in's roome reside?
            Th'art rather Type of Tarquin's, Plutoes pride.
         
         
            
            OF THE INTERPRETATION OF THE SCRIPTVRES.
            THE THIRD SATYRE.
            
               The ARGVMENT.
               Since, 'tis most plaine, Popes can explaine Gods Writ;
               To seeke to Them, in All. Doubts, is most sit.
            
            THe Trident Councell hath confirm'd the scope
            Of Scriptures to the pleasure of the Pope:
            Whose sacred Sense on Romes Hi
                  â€¢â€¢
                Priest depends:
            And therefore to Romes loue submissely bends.
            If not, her Readers shall be sure to finde
            Nothing but Wry-wayes, By-wayes, darke and blinde.
            For 'tis Gods Word; which none, well, vnderstand:
            Vnlesse the Pope pu
                  â€¢
                to his helping hand.
            Consult with Popish Rubricks lest thou wander;
            This Ariadne guides in Texts Meander.
            
            For of Gods Word he's th' onely Hermes best:
            The holy-Ghost being seated in his brest.
            And the Popes Word, is Gods Word certainly:
            In whom is not least spot of Heresie.
            This Wizards quicke Wit picks-out, passing well;
            Marrow from bones, Nut-kernels from the shell.
            The holy words true sense he sure finds out,
            Who else interprets, leaues the text in doubt.
            
               He onely being Scriptures South-Sayer, sure,
            Resolues the doubts of rigid Texts obscure.
            Sols day-starre, which, to Christs Church giues pure light:
            And doth darke clouds of Errour banish quite.
            He's vertues Watch-Towre, rule of Pietie:
            Lawes light, and Courts bright-beame of Equitie.
            The Sages Starre, Christs birth, shew'd not so right:
            As Popes to Christians doe Gods Word enlight.
            Like as the Sunne fills All with shine most pure:
            So his cleare Light makes bright the Bible sure.
            And since his Paraphrase from Errour's free:
            
               Ergo, the Texts pure Sense from him must be.
            If at his Candle thou'lt not kindle thine:
            Th'art blinde, and Gods Word cannot in thee shine.
            The Axetree of Romes Faith rowles hereupon:
            That Peters Heire must be thy Master knowne.
            And though a Glosse most Grosse the Text doth wrest:
            Since, Ipse dixit, that must be the best.
            This Library of God, Atlas of Faith,
            
               Commends, condemnes, at pleasure, saith, vnsaith.
            
            But (sure as Sol doth shine) he's the bold Boaster
            Of Pietie; false-Prophet, Worlds Imposter.
            He, boldly, his opinions doth apply
            To Scriptures; but ner're better'd is thereby.
            For if thou knewst how he Christs writ doth wrest:
            Thou'dst thinke he brow, nor braine, nor heart, possest.
            He is (Romes Delius saith) the Delphicke Sword:
            Lifes perfect leaden Rule, Gods holy Word.
            Pliant t'each Sense, Deuotions doubtfull line;
            To false opinions facile to encline.
            'Tis Gods owne Word, that Pens of Exposition
            Should run with Romes Rites, Practices, Condition.
            
               The Church, Truths witnesse (a dumbe witnesse, sure)
            Must learne from Romes high-Priest to speake most pure.
            Thus this worlds Dunghill, Patriarch subtill, slie;
            Expounds Gods Word most artificially.
            But, whatsoere's vnpleasant to his taste,
            His Paraphrase must mend it in all haste.
            O Pope, Arts Prop, great Master of the Muses:
            Whose holy mouth, faith into all infuses:
            Must I (O Clarke of Clarkes most learned, rare,)
            Be a Disciple of thy Sacred Chaire?
            I'm sure of Pauls and Peters anger, when
            Thine Oracle (great Scholiast) I contemne.
            Long haue I listned, let me quickly know
            The sacred Oracles which from thee flow.
            Though Rude, I'm Ready; thou shalt finde me free:
            If taught, new-wrought from Rudenesse I may be.
            Thus, then: Christ, thrice bad Peter his flocke feed:
            
               Ergo, the Pope must supreme Head succeed.
            Christ left his sheepe to Peter to be fed:
            
               Ergo, the Pope is of all Councels Head.
            Againe, to feed his Lambs Christ Peter bad:
            
            
               Ergo, from his mouth Scriptures Sense is had.
            
               Feed, that's to say; the worlds Vice-gerent be:
            And let all Regall Scepters bow to thee.
            
               Feed, that's as much, as Curbe, proscribe, and kill:
            In this sence Peter did his charge fulfill.
            Sing, holy Sir, Saint Peter makes thee sit
            His firme Successour, witnesse holy Writ.
            On, with this new-found Logicke; Beautifie
            Thy thus got charge; thy prize (faire Palmes) is nigh.
            Harke now: Christ said to Peter, follow me:
            
               Ergo, he followd Christ, in Emperie.
            
               Peters firme faith was ne're with blasts oreblowne.
            
               Ergo, Popes faith eclipse hath neuer knowne.
            To thee (O Peter) heauens blest Keyes were giuen:
            
               Ergo, the Pope them keepes as Port'r of heauen.
            
               Christ praid for Peter: Ergo, 'tis most plaine;
            The Petrean-Parents faith must firme remaine.
            
               Kill and eate: Ergo, Peter must be Head:
            For that which eares, that same is sure the head.
            Vpon a Rocke Christs Church was built: Therefore,
            
               Peter's a Rocke, the Pope his Paramour.
            O Prince of Priests, Bishop of fragrant fame;
            Who (tamelesse) tam'st All; heau'n hath will'd the same.
            Prop and protect Romes Axetree with more might.
            Lest thy Pontifike heau'n be cast downe quite.
            Open (O rare Interpreter) for me,
            Mo Scripture Nuts that I their Kernes may see.
            
               Others (alas) giue but a glimpse of light:
            But thy blest Lawpe giues a great Sun-beame bright.
            To thee the Scripture freely opes her heart:
            And to thy Cisterne doth full streames impart.
            
               Apollo prompting thee, thou canst conclude,
            
               Ought out of ought
               â–ª Logicke thou hast subdude.
            Expounding's fit for Boyes: sense swims to thee:
            Spare oyle and match, thou without Light canst see.
            If I an hundred wise Apollos had,
            To finde thy force and fraude, they'd all run mad.
            On, farther, Father, sit downe in thy Chaire:
            Thy word to weigh my prone eares I prepare.
            To cast to Dogges things holy 'tis not fit:
            
               Ergo
               â–ª Rude people must not know Gods writ.
            Other things when I come I will dispose:
            
               Ergo, th'Apostle did the Masse compose.
            
               For thirty Pence our Sauiour was betraide:
            
               Ergo, the Hoste like Pence must needs be made.
            Christ was a Rocke: Ergo, to say Masse on,
            
            All Altars must be made of Rockey Stone.
            Promise of Life, to Bread, not Wine, was made:
            
               Ergo, the Wine to Laicks is gaine-said.
            Who eates this Bread, shall liue eternally:
            
               Ergo, for Hea'un, Bread serues sufficiently.
            Priests are ith' Church, like Soldiers Sp'rituall:
            
               Ergo, 'gainst Hell with Songs they rore and yaull.
            The fruitlesse Fig-tree, Christ with curse did smite:
            
               Ergo, the Pope may curse and ban by right.
            All men shall at his Foot-stoole Him adore:
            
               Ergo, the Pope must on mens backs be bore.
            People, of Priests, touching the Law must aske:
            
               Ergo, t'expound is the Popes onely Taske.
            An Ethnick let him bee, which heares not Thee:
            
               Ergo, All must receiue the Popes Decree.
            It seemed good to th' Holy Ghost and mee:
            
               
                  
                     â€¢
                  rgo, the Pope Truths Horologe must bee.
            Moses, the Iewes Iarres, to an end did draw:
            
               Ergo, the Popes Law's liuely; dead's Gods Law.
            Christ, Tribute paide for Peter: Ergo, than,
            
            The Pope paies none, but catcheth all he can.
            O Rabbi rare, Angelicall Expounder!
            Whose sense of Sacred-Writ, than all is sounder:
            When I a Beefe kill, thou the hornes shalt haue,
            For these thy Scripture-Expositions braue.
            The pith of Texts is knowne so well to thee;
            That for thy vse, they Parrets seeme to 
                  ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰
               .
            What's next? O shew it, shoote more lightning out:
            To scatter trembling Heretikes about.
            
               Those that liue in the Flesh, please not the Lord:
            
               Ergo, the Pope will Priests no wiues afford.
            Melchisedech the Priest no Parents had:
            
               Ergo, Priests to be Parents is most bad.
            God hath put all things vnderneath his Feete:
            
               Ergo, the World should be Popes slaue, tis meete.
            The Lord two great Lights made: Ergo, Popes Might,
            
            Must be the greatest, lesser Emp'rours Light.
            
               First Heau'n, then Earth was made: Ergo, I hope,
            
               Caesar in pompe, must come behinde the Pope.
            The Spirit th' vnbridled Flesh must tame, abase:
            
               Ergo, the Pope of Emperours must take place.

            All things are iudg'd by the Spirituall man:

            This flame, cleares soules, Bags emptieth for hire.
            This purgeth Purses pregnant with pure gold:
            Romes strong gold-glister torrid zoane behold.
            This purgeth metals (though most pure before)
            And leaues to fooles, of wit and wealth small store.
            A Bug-Beare is this great Catharticke flame,
            Popes painted hell, Worlds Scarre-Crow fools to tame.
            How this fond Popes fond fire, fond fooles doth fright?
            How foolish lightnings from's false heau'ns shine bright?
            Nothing but Sinons voice Fraud, Chimicke trickes,
            Is in this strange Purse-purifying Styx.
            
            He which can quickly kindle this quicke flame,
            Can if he list (rare Craftesmen) quench the same,
            Thou hast (O Sacred Sir) firme facultie,
            To damne, redeeme all soules that there doe frie:
            If thou canst saue, but wilt not th' art too iust;
            But if thou wouldst, and canst not, who'le thee trust?
            Choose wheth'r of these, since either of these o'rethrow thee:
            A Lying-Priest, or Tyrant-fierce, they shew thee.
            Romes Pontificke, Pompificke Prelate, rather,
            Such fond Daedalean fantasies doth father.
            And Berengarius quaintly quips them well,
            For pot and pottage they the World excell.
            But I (if lawfull 'tis) may terme them, true,
            
               Mercuries, Ioiners, Coiners, of faith new.
            Great reason ist that Purgatories fire
            Should burne most bright, and warme the Popes desire.
            For if this Money-fertile fire goe out,
            Popes chimneys would (alas) lie cold, I doubt.

            Christs Bloud (thou sayst) for Sinne, not Paine, did pay:
            Yet (thy Indulgence can take Both away.)
            Sometime thou'lt Penanco haue, yet Sinne protected:
            Can Sinne be salu'd, yet Penance be expected?
            O the Indulgent loue os Romes kinde Father!
            To binde, loose, shew to Guilt, and Guiltie fauour.
            At once, he blowes, and sups, makes hot, and cold:
            
               Bindes, and vnbindes, vnbound things fast doth hold.
            What e're he pardons, he can punish to;
            Make Guiltie, Guiltlesse, this and more he'le doe.
            His Ramish-Romish Faith much Mirth may make:
            But whose weake Faith, true growth from it can take?
            
               He which is dawbd with extreme V

            Full strength to struggle with spirituall scath.
            This blessed Balme Christs blessed seruants makes:
            He's none of Christs, that Babels Balme forsakes.
            But Caluinists (though Papists rage and raue)
            To greaze their Boots, this oyle doe often saue.
            
               Calixtus, wisely, did foure Fasts ordaine:
            For, bodies, yeares; foure quarters do

            As, Peter was a Fisher, fish to vse,
            
               Peters religious Popes doe chiefly choose.
            
               Repentance was no Sacrament of old:
            
               Penance is now a new-one vncontrould.
            Baptisme's a pledge of Faith to Christ conioyn'd:
            And by this Badge Romes Vice-Christ, his will finde.
            Heau'ns life Eternall, by externall lauing
            We get: and thence comes all mens hope of sauing.
            This Salt, this Oyle, these magicke Arts, ranke Spittle,
            
            Abuse thy people (O Christ) not a little.
            O damn'd deeds of Romes botching-Bishop base,
            Gods Law and pure Hand-writing to disgrace.
            Heretickes this Arch-Hereticke makes those,
            Which will not seuen sound Sacraments suppose.
            For, the seuen Card'nall Vices, Vertues, show:

            Ith' Eucharist, their Wine is poysnous, sure:
            For laymen may not that dire draught endure.
            These thirstie Guests sup, sip no moisture; they
            (Against their wils) That cup, to passe them, pray.
            
            If Sacrilegiously they'l halfe with-hold:
            With neither part to part, they may be bold.
            
               Masse-Priests tooke Bread and Wine; Laicks, but Bread:
            If Bread serue these, with both, why are Priests fed?
            The answer's easie, Who eats Bread, has Wine:
            For needs must Flesh, within it Bloud conioyne.
            Well, if meere-Bread both Bread and Wine doth coope:
            Why (besides Bread) take Priests so sound a S

            Since Christ (Cup, Bearer-like) gaue vs his Blood:
            How is it by audacious Popes withstood?
            
               Confession is (thou sayst) Sinnes Remedie:
            But thy flocke findes it Curing-Crueltie.
            
            Their soule being fed with Vineger and Gall:
            When pard'ned, to sinnes Penance 'tis in thrall.
            Soule-Tyrannizing Pope, dire dregs, hard heart:
            O how vnkindely-kinde (alas) thou art?
            No Laude, much Fraud in thy Confessions be.

            Surely the fond Confessors selfe, oft times,
            Both heares and cleares (thee telling) thy foule crimes.
            And canst thou then other folkes faults forgiue?
            Thou canst thine owne, then, howsoere they liue.
            Thou canst indeed absolue Absoluers: Why?
            Heau'ns kingdomes Key betweene thy lips doth lie:
            For something, all things, thou'lt forgiue to All:
            Which for Romes ioyfull Iubiles doe call.
            Thou'lt loose Omissiue and Commissiue sinne;
            And could Christs Passion greater glory win?
            Canoniz'd Saints are surely sau'd, thou't say.
            Thy selfe vnsure, would'st certainly display.
            Dost thou know others, yet thy selfe much doubt?
            Are thy eyes bright abroad? At home put out?
            
               Wouldst be beleeu'd, but not Thy-selfe beleeue?
            Though wise to others, thou'lt thy selfe deceiue.
            See here, the triple Crownes decree deuine:
            See Popes Petrean-faith, Saint Peters Shrine.
            Art thou not right Bezalels typed Temple?
            Babel, Gods Arke may heare, with like example.
            Of this Browne-Bran (for here's not least fine Flower)
            
            Dogmaticke dunghils, Popes to make haue power.
            What need I name, each worship-new, vaine Rite?
            Whereby true worship is euen buried quite.
            Romes Mother-Church is big with foolerie:
            With faithlesse Faith and impious Pietie;
            For the most part, Papisme is Paganisme:
            Fertile, yea ranke, in rotten new-found Schisme.
            
            O impious Idolizing Papists graue!
            Is God your God? who many Gods may haue?
            Whiles you lie snorting, th' Enuious Man keeps watch:
            And Satan (so) you oft with scoffes doth catch.
            Vaine, silly Superstition songs doth mutter:
            And dayly Prayers by numbred Beads, doth vtter.
            But I shall shew in more conuenient place:
            The noyse and toyes of Romish Quires most base.
            Meane while, What does our Clergie-Master, see,
            How playes he Peters part? How flockes Feeds he:
            Surely, this Care, who will, may take in hand:
            Himselfe ith' Church, treble-Head-Stone doth stand.
            And in this Sense, I say, and euer shall:
            The Pope's a Rocke, liuely Grammaticall.
            And I will wager now, with any one,
            That, than the Pope, Nothing's more like a Stone.
            He's hush in Words, but Swords he'le brandish braue;
            In Loue, Stone-heart: in Hate, Wraths part he'le haue:
            
               He sends forth Threats, suspends milke-Teats; and thus,
            Fauours Gods flock: thus is Religious.
            
               Paul (sure) that Patterne of a Pastor good,
            Nor Peter (thus) their dueties vnderstood.
            Doubtlesse, whilst he Kingdomes loose shackles shakes:
            His Kings, most blinde, to Warres and Iarres, he makes.
            While these his restlesse Cares, all rest deny,

            Iustly this loue sleight sacred Cares may fly.
            If thou reuise each annuall act and deed:
            None of them shew one Pope his flocks to feed.
            And this Vice-Christ, herein Christ imitates:
            With a few Loaues, thousands he satiates.
            Good Shepheards, more than Life, their Flocks doe prize:
            The Pope his Flockes, vnder all, vilifies.
            Ah ignorant, base, dull, blinde, vulgar Rout!
            To whom the Lampe of Light and Truth's put out.
            O how your day is darknesse, Guides, misguide:
            Hearts, rough; Minde, tough; Hope, vaine; Faith foolified.
            Thousand Goth-like, Vandall-like villanies:
            Mongst thousands of Popes people Tyrannize.
            At Rome, huge bands of Vagrants vaine there be:
            Which breake Christs Sabbaths in loose company.
            Shepheards may keepe the Erymanthean Beare:
            As well as Popes Christs Flocks, deuoyd of care.
            He which ith' Church will haue nor, Blinde, nor Lame:
            In holy'st duties, he's in Both the same.
            
               Implicite faith to hold, they hold most holy:
            And Ignorance, chiefe Pietie, not Folly.
            This is no holy Fatling, but leane, lanke:
            This is not Peoples power, but Poyson ranke.
            Thus in Soule-captiu'd flocks is Popes delight:
            Like the Cyclopean Troops bereft of sight.
            
               Whilst he by Images would people teach:
            Himselfe's an Image, he'le not to them preach:
            While his externall Temple's glorious gay:
            He suffers Gods true Temple to decay.
            And while he may wallow in worldly pelfe:
            
               
                  Proximus ipse sibi.
               Farewell poore Christ, He's neerest to himselfe.
            
            Yea fare thou well, that thy Priest well may be:
            For if thou first doe well, then (sure) will he.
            Bread to be made of Stones (with Stygian skill)
            And men t'eate Stones in Statues, is his will.
            Cease Questionist t'enquire of faith sincere:
            Rome holds it fittest, faith confounded were.
            This high Priest of Romes sacred Rites, indeed,
            His feeble flockes with frothy milke doth feed.
            Impostour, Pastor, Doctor, Deceiuer great:
            Is there in thy Sheep-fold such holy meat?
            Whiles thou dost thus soules feed, or rather starue:
            Giue Satan Them, the Rest to thee reserue.
            Since in Gods Church th'art rough Marpesias rocke:
            Why then should stupid I, trust such a stocke?
            Should men thee trust, as thou thy selfe dost trust:
            
            
               Trust me, who trusts thee, is a mad man iust.
            
               People trust Priests, Priests Bishops trust, I hope;
            
               Prelates trust Councels, Councels trust the Pope.
            Let all opinions t' ones opinion trust:
            Then, but one flocke, one faith needs be there must.
            Is This faiths golden Syntaxe firmely true?
            Commend it first t'a Turke or faithlesse Iew.
            Now (great Priests-Prelate) by thy mitred pleasure:
            Declare mo 
                  Things following from things already demonstrated.
                
               Confectaries of thy Treasure.
            If thou, faiths Cacodocuments wilt shew me:
            A triple-fitted Crest Ile wish vnto thee.
            
               Rome being drunke with sacred Saints deare blooe:
            Worshippeth Saints, with Rites, ne're vnderstood.
            
               Truely thou sayst, and we the Truth must trust:
            Thou then, when I speake true, beleeue me must.
            The Popes (by rules of Romes Religion old)
            Farre lesse, loue Saints, than Strumpets, base and bold.
            Vnder Christs name, many foule contraries
            To Christ, this cunning craftsman doth deuise.
            On Satans Boxes, he subscribes Christs name:
            With paliated Fraud; Gods Flocke to shame.
            The people eate poyson, with paint surrounded.
            And venome drinke, with Antidotes compounded.
            Vice-Christ adores Christs name, not Deitie:
            Keeps lesse of Christs, than Peters, memorie.
            To Peter, Temples, Feasts, Fasts, makes, erects;
            
               Peter to be Faiths Rocke, he most affects.
            
               Peter, aliue, would not be worshipt: Now,
            To's Image (as to God) being dead, they bow,
            The Saints aliue, were clad in meane aray:
            Their pictures, Puppet-like, are wondrous gay.
            A Maide, is made, Mans Sauiouresse diuine:
            And She by right her Sonne can ought enioyne.
            Nor is Romes sect (the Mother's so ador'd)
            With Christs, as Maries worshippers, so stor'd.
            Heau'ns kingdome, Christ did with his Mother share:
            Kept halfe himselfe, and halfe to her did spare.
            Gods Daughter by pure fruite of most pure birth,
            Excels the louely Lillies of the Earth.
            Fairer then Phiebus, than full Phoebe whiter:
            Cleerer than Starres, than braue Aurora brighter.
            Seas Starre, Suns Patronesse, Heau'ns golden-gate:

               Poore wretches Ioy, Anchor, Hauen, blest Blast, Hope;
            And What Not? Is Shee to th' plumbeous Pope.
            She, which to th' World brought forth the promis'd Seed;
            Tooke from the World, almost what Eue did breed.
            The Pope, falne backe, to Heretikes old Toyes:
            Heresies fragments to re-boile, much ioyes.
            In golden Cups Hee deadly poyson quaffes:
            And in braue Bowles, to slay poore Soules, He laughes,
            Is Christ Med'atour? Why then seek'st thou More?
            Yes, Popelings thousands haue, thousands adore.
            O fond, besotted Papists, deafe, dull, blinde:
            Can one such madnes, 'mongst the Heathen find?
            This Hellish Hangman Mart'ricide most fierce:
            Worshippeth many a Martyrs painted Herse.
            
            This Faiths Confounder, killing thy Lambes good:
            To Thee (O Christ) doth sacrifice thy Blood.
            A painted Lamb's ador'd, deuour'd aliue:
            Thus, thus, doth Romes Religion rarely thriue.
            Him I will not Religious, Holy, stile,
            But Common Whore, or Couchant Wolfe most vile.
            Gods Church, with floods of blood, orewhelmed all:
            We may the Pope, Saints bloody Butcher call.
            This Field of blood, Acheldamae thus showne:
            Makes thee (proud Priest) a Dog-Wolfe, Bitch-Wolfe knowneâ–ª
            
            How many Tesles doe detest with Scath;
            Romes sacrilegious ebbing, flowing Faith?
            Which Hee'le, now firme, anon infringe, and bee
            A Synon sly, not Simon-Peter free.
            For to a Counsell, One, once call'd, secur'd;
            The Guest was slaine, the Hoste, his Faith abiur'd,
            And whereas Priests Gods Flocks bright Star should be,
            The raging Dog-starre this Vice-Christ, we see.
            
               Christs feeble Flocke, the Popes Salue hurts, not heales:
            
            Hee with tart Tortures, not milde Med'cines deales.
            I surely thinke, that Turkes of All Popes times,
            Ne're wrought 'gainst Christ, so many bloody Crimes.
            O what a Man of Blood art Thou to th' Bride?
            By whom Hir offspring Dye, in Fire are fryde.
            Popes furious frownes, make many vndergoe
            Deaths Dart, Warres Smart, Waues finall, fatall Woe.
            The Pope and Pluto (witnes euery Lowne)
            Thus differ, hee hath Hornes, Popes triple Crowne;
            All els concurre. So well perform'd thou seest;
            All Satans Workes, by this Plutonick Priest.
            A time will come, when Hee, Christs sacred Traine,
            And liuing Members dearely would re-gaine.
            And yet Saints slaughter will not Him suffice;
            But ore Dead Corps dig'd vp, Hee'l tyrannize.
            Nor rests his Fury with Dead bodies fed:
            But this fierce Fiend their Ghosts hath tortured.

            In midst of Flames, than Flames themselues more bright;
            Thy Martyrs were, all clad with fiery Light.
            Nor did her soile want raine, to spring and bud;
            Too fertile 'twas, ore flowne with showres of Blood.
            Popes Founders and Repayrers Diuels were;

            Nor did Queene Marie, of meere Vulgars builde
            Those Godlesse Flames; but burn'd fiue Bishops milde.
            Nay more; a Child, from Mothers Wombe which brast;
            VVas into th' Fire by Romish Fiends re-cast.
            Lo; thus, with slaughtered Saints, Romes shambles shines;
            No better brau'rie Romes renowne refines.
            Seruant of Seruant
                  â€¢
               , Fellow seruants slayes:
            And so himselfe a Seruant base betrayes.
            This Latian Dragon with Gods Saints makes warre:
            In Blood, his foule Face laues, than Warres worse farre.
            In one of these fierce Monsters shortest raigne;
            Records report, an hundred thousand slaine.
            
               Nocent the third, (I take in from the Nocent)
            So many thousands in one Slaughter spent.
            O thou (in truth) Saints ruth, All red (oft read)
            VVith Blood of many Martyrs Martyred.
            Slaine corps doe con-corrupt my life (alas)
            That Hee Saints Homicide so long doth passe.
            And when (O Christ) thy Seruants slaine I see,
            Ore-flowing Flouds mine eyes I wish to bee.
            In that Parisian Shambles, knowne too well;
            How many guiltlesse Lambes in one weeke fell?
            VVhilst Paris, then more blood did drinke, than Wine:
            That Towne, that time, a Tempest was Sanguine.
            Forewarn'd, learne wisedome, doe not Christ despise:
            VVhom, soone, Romes Shambles brings to Butcheries.
            Alas, Hee's not Sheeps Peeder, but Confounder:
            
            Black-cankered Conscience, Ouicide, Sheepe-wounder.
            Hee which growes great by sacred Saints perdition:
            Hastens to Hell with guilty Expedition.
            
               Thine, plagues (O Christ) by Sufferance, subiugate:
            For, what they cannot shun, they tolerate.
            To these, Lifes want is Life; their Death, no Death:
            Conquest, their Crosse; to liue, to lose their breath.
            
               Goodnes, their Gold; the World, their Pot, Griefe, Flame:
            Their Flesh, the Reed; their Hammer, God; to frame.
            Blood founded first Christs Church; by blood, it grew:
            Blood showres, It cheeres; by Blood tis of red hiew.
            With Blood, Vice-Christ, Christs Foldes doth filthifie:
            See, Men of God; See, Popish Piety.
            Of Romes false doctrines, many Scraps remaine:
            Which my close Hedge is too close to containe.
            
               Index Expurgatorius, Bookes great Bane:
            A Worke, well knowne, dishonest, crafty, vaine:
            
               Robs, or rubs out much antique learned Treasure;
            
               Pils or pals out much, at the Popes dis-Pleasure.
            His Censure suffocates Mens Births, (their Bookes)
            Takes out plaine Truths, puts in vile spurious Crookes.
            O horrid, hatefull, Slaught'r-House, foule, nefarious:
            To Godly Bookes, a plague, a torture various.
            The Fathers Strayes, not Sonnes (then) Papists Name;
            Though Fathers theirs, All theirs, still theirs they claime.
            Their Postils, Packets are of Trumperies;
            Hee which in them can find no Wit, is wise.
            'Tis plaine, All Papists are Traditionists:
            
            Who terme and trouble vs for Scripturists.
            
            
               Which be, or what, or how many Traditions;
            Or where they are, scapes (yet) Romes Inquisitions:
            Yet These must be obseru'd religiously,
            And be embrac'd with Scriptures dignity.
            What-e're hath part of neither Word nor Writ:
            
            With Word, and Writ, in equall State must sit.
            
               Thus Clementines, and Asinines poore packs;
            (Wherewith the Pope his Library well thwacks)
            And God knowes what trim toyes, and Decretals,
            
            Must be Gods sacred Scriptures Corriuals.
            Thus that blest Booke must haue no blessed vse:
            More Wealth, more worke from others, Popes produce.
            
               Reliques, more than Religion, they respect:
            And more than Churches, Chimnies they affect.
            His Agnus Dei's made of Waxe mo

                pure,
            Hee makes the Worlds great Wens and Sores to cure.
            And hee which will not blest Saluation misse:
            Must straitway striue the Popes blest Foote to kisse.
            
               Water with Wine (after Romes custome) mixt;
            Assures poore Soules to be with Christ fast fixt.
            The Thorney Crowne (O Christ) which wrought thy woe:
            A Golden Crowne, on a bald-pate, doth show.
            A Cocke, on Pinnacles of Temples plac't,
            Warnes All with Peter to Repentance haste.
            
               Waxe-Tapers, burnt, to grace the Noone-daies light:
            The Gentiles promis'd-Light, declare, most right.
            But (sure) those Lights, doe plainely intimate;
            The Popes Soules-darknesse, and his friends retraite.
            It also shewes, that Papists hate Day-light,
            And, most like Owles, see best in darkest Night.
            Much Faith boiles in his braine; his Heart holds none:
            And whilst he brags of Good, his Work's not showne.
            A Pater Noster said, puts sinnes away:
            If thou it say, resay thrice, oft a day.
            
               These taste to me, as Gall to Christ did taste:
            What-ere I read, taste, trust, proue; All proues waste.
            What vertue by Christ crucified growes,
            The Mimick-Masse, Popes Cleopatra showes:
            
               Faire Phillis, Philomel, Calliope:
            
            
               Venus, Melissa, and Melpomene:
            
            This Romes Religion her Palladium hath,
            This the Idea of the Romish Faith.
            Heere Babels Bawde ruffles in silke and gold:
            In shining Syndon sheltring thefts most bold.
            And with cleane clothes hir damned Dens doth hide,
            That Shee of none a rauening Wolfe be spide.
            Her Face to grace, the Popes Spouse spares no charge:
            For Satans Maske, Shee needs not pay so large.
            Vnto All sicke, All sound, at all times (sure)
            The Masse a Medcine comes, them all to cure.
            If thou thy Swine sicke of the Measels see,
            A soueraigne Salue the Masse will make to thee.
            A Veniall or a Mortall Sinne to cleere,
            The Masse, Gods Might, a present Helpe drawes neere.
            Who heares a Masse, shall not by day waxe old:
            If the Masse-monger be well paide with Gold.
            For, the Heau'ns Poles (the Masse neere tyr'd) stand still:
            And lazie Lachesis, leaues Wheele and Quill.
            For quicke and dead, there, prayr's and off'rings bee:
            The Masse, (Messias) is an Ape of Thee.
            
            Nay more, the Priest (strange wonder) dawb'd with Oyle:
            By's Hoste, can Christ to's Father reconcile.
            Ith' Eucharist (O Christ) God giues vs Thee:
            Canst thou againe by Priests to God giu'n be?
            Thou art (O Christ) our Priest and Sacrifice:
            What power, so like, in vnlike Masse-Priests lyes?
            O Pandects of impure Impiety!
            Which th' impious Masse doth seldome let passe by
            If once a man to Masse admitted bee:
            Goodnesse and Faith omitted he shall see.
            
               
               A Puppet-playing Priest, makes (O foule crime!)
            Christs Passe-ouer, Sport, to passe-ouer time.
            
            They, sure, which did Masse-matters institute;
            Than Christ, Paul, Peter, were farre more acute.
            The Priest saies Masse, the idiot people mutter:
            While old-wiues, petty, pretty pray'rs doe vtter.
            A strange Tongue talkes, but sense none thence can picke:
            Thus Fickle Fooles, Brittle-glasseâ–ª Bottles licke.
            Let him on th' idle Stage see playes and Sights;
            Which would goe see, heare, loue, and know Masse Rites.
            Hee which conceiues not, heares not: Euen so Hee,
            Heares, sees in vaine, which voide of sense, doth see.
            Not Sentences, but Sense enlights the minde:
            
               Consent is gone, if Sense we doe not finde.
            O how the Munc-key in his Surplis white;
            The merry-Masse, and Massing-Priest, playes right.
            With hearty laughes, my heart in me would chatter;
            When I but read the Masses merry-matter.
            
            
               Musick so much, sweet Songs, shrill singing out;
            Romes sacred Syrens doe so chaunt about.
            These cunning tricks, Kings facinate; and All
            Quaffe her adulterous Nectar sp'rituall.
            
            Christs Ransome, thus, and our Redemptions pay,
            Shee sells, and sits, for gaine in Harlots way.
            If then by Christs blood thou thy soule wouldst saue;
            The Pope, (Soules Hope) Masse, as Messias, craue.
            If thou the Worlds Sin-purger faine wouldst buy;
            I'th' Masse for Money hees sold easily.
            For a small price, the Masse makes Thine (cock-sure)
            Christs Merits, which Hee dearely did procure.
            
               Caiaphas doted, when hee paid so deere,
            T'haue Christ betray'd, Hee's bought far cheaper heere.
            
               O formidable God, Heau'ns high Commander:
            Seest thou, yet suffrest this nefarious slander:
            The sacred Cou'nant, Iustice, Rites, blest Hope:
            So oft abusde, misusde, by Romes proud Pope.
            O can thy boundlesse Longanimitie,
            To iudge this monstrous Masse, yet still passe-by?
            O can thy endlesse Mercy tolerate,
            The Masse, Messias Rights, to arrogate?
            Though God be slow, he's sure, to punish Pride:
            And who his sharpe seuere wrath can abide?
            To strike more sure; his Sword he lifts vp long:
            His Leaden-Heeles, bring Hands of steele most strong.
            O Deuils deuice, accursed feasting place:
            Damned masse of the Masse, sinnes bundle base!
            O Pope prophane: which with such monsters vilde:
            So idle Idols, hast Gods House defilde.
            Art thou Gods Parson proud, Faiths Lampe most light?

            Thee, Faiths desiler, Christs, his Churches Foe,
            
            My obligated Verse, to th' world shall show.
            Whilst life doth last, the Whet-stone of my Rhimes:
            My Verses Venome, shall be Romes foule Crimes.
            And while my Pen may play the Satyres part,
            Rome shall be stript and whipt, and soundly smart,
         
         
            
            OF THAT BLASPHEMOVS FALSE-FICTION OF MERIT, AND OF WORKS OF SVPEREROGATION, to the Derogation of Christs honour.
            THE FIFTH SATYRE.
            
               The ARGVMENT.
               On Romes Bawds brow is branded Blasphemie;
               Whose Marke, marke here, in this grosse Heresie.
            
            WHo (Pseudo. Prophet, of false Prophets) can
            Thy thundring Blasphemies discusse or scan?
            Christ merited (Thou'lt say) that thou mightst merit:
            And Merits dipt in his Bloud dost inherit.
            With Merits mingling Christ, dost Monsters make:
            Which from Workes-wages, and Faith, fashion take.
            Strange iugling Trickes of Merits, thou dost plot:
            And mak'st Christs-selfe to merit God knowes whatâ–ª
            
            By Merits, thou (for so the Bargaine's made,
            Twixt God and Thee) hast for Gods Kingdome paid.
            Saluations Sterne, and Foredecke, Merits are:
            Thy Faith's in Christ, for Faiths Deseruing-share.
            
            
               Sole Faith is no Faith; is a Carkasse dead,
            Nothing almost, rude lumpe, a fant'sie fled.
            With Merits, Grace-Mediatrixe saues (thou sayst)
            But vaine is Hope on God alone that's plac't.
            
               Faith fixt on God, confusde, retires, retorts;
            But fixt on Thee, Thy goodnesse, It supports.
            Faith Physicke is; trust in Physicion's fraile:
            And, without thine owne worke, Both these will faile.
            Thy pray'r, is, Lord, for Merits, Mercie show:
            And thy desires desired as debts that grow.
            Boldly thou'dst breake-ope heau'n Gates by Merit:
            And make thy selfe and thine, Gods Throne inherit.
            As Ixion did his Cloud, thou'lt this imbrace:
            As thy chiefe Light, Delight, and heauenly Grace.
            
            Merits superfluous scums and scraps thou'lt sell:
            (Apothecarie kinde) to All not well.
            Who ere wants Merits, thou canst fill him full:
            And out of Trunks and Treasuries, them pull.
            The Iust doe supererogate, thou'lt say:
            And for himselfe and his, On, merit may.
            Such Iust are superarrogating Elues:
            
            And merit not for Others nor themselues.
            
            Stealing Saints Merits, thereby to get gold:
            Th'art Merits-Thiefe, Merits vnfruitfull mold.
            I wonder where this Chest of Merits stood:
            Ith' dayes of our Isachian Patriarchs good.
            Did Rome keepe this trim Treasure of such worthâ–ª
            
            That afterwards Romes Lord might bring it forth?
            For, if Romes Ioue a golden gobbet haue:
            He'le straight raine-downe a showre of Merits braue.
            Gods gifts are free, the Elect get grace vnbought:
            The Popes gifts are at most deare prices sought.
            
               Ith' Scriptures, none, can Tubs of Merits finde:
            But, there (we reade) Grace gratis giues (most kinde)
            Vpon Christs bloud, God, our soules health did place:
            Canst thou then sell this Ransome (Pedler base)
            Tis a deepe Whirlepoole of most impious bane:
            Which muds the stinking Laerna of thy braine.
            Christ ne're (thou sayst) t'vs Righteousnesse imputes:
            Yet Rome, Saints-Righteousnesse, t'vs attributes.
            Did free Saint Francis gran

                what Christ did not?
            Thy pate and partie Physicke might haue got.
            For (sure) all Saints (that none might Merits lacke)
            Their Merits hid, ith' corners of thy Sacke.
            
            At Rome also Merits Exchange doth stand:
            Whose golden Keyes, are at thy chiefe command.
            Porter whereof thou art, but in good time:
            Thou mayst be Butler, and so higher climbe.
            And as Seas waues all on a heape doe flow;
            
               Nereus being ne're the lesse, when backe they goe:
            So thou alone dost all Saints Merits take:
            And, sell thou ne're so many, they ne're slake.
            Tis in thy power to poure-out Merits treasure:
            For, all Store's trusted to the Stewards pleasure.
            Romes gracious streames from her full veines doe thrillâ–ª
            
            That gratefull ones may gratis drinke their fill.
            Alas Christs troubled, Truth disgraced grace:
            
            What Goods, what gifts, giues Man, God to abase?
            
               Hebrews and Greeks, no word for Merit haue:
            Both Couenants God in Greeke and Hebrew gaue.
            The Faithfull liue not by their Righteousnesse:
            
            Life and soules health the Iust by Faith possesse.
            Saints haue receiu'd, but Crownes did ne're bestow:
            And none to lend their Righteousnesse, I know.

            He makes vp Merit, that he so may see,
            Christs Passion spoild, and God no God to be.
            Say Peter, when as Christ beheld thee weeping:
            What Merits helpt thee? who had them in keeping?
            Gods grace, is no grace, if not gratis giuen:
            Dost thou deserue it? Grace is from thee driuen.

            And Heresies owne hand, herear, euen smites him.
            Incredulous, quite faithlesse may I be,
            Y'ere I (dull Papist) fixe my Faith to thee.

            All which to whip, one day cannot supply.
            
            Not all of Christ, but whole Christ, each where stayes;
            
               This, ancient Fathers faith affirmes, and sayes;
            If, then, Christs flesh be not in eu'ry place;
            Sure, 'tis not flesh, ith' Masse, in any case.
            If, Bread it be, and must his Body be:
            Then, of his Body, 'tis no Signe to me.
            The Body's not the Type: the Type, It, shades:
            If things themselues be Types, the Type (then) fades.
            All other holy things, their Signes ne're change:
            That Signes change onely here; Is it not strange?
            Surely these pendent Seales assure, alone,
            That Promise which Gods Word had me fore-showne.
            And sacred Seales their Patents ne're oppose:
            Therefore, both Signe and Substance, Christ enclose.
            But by the Word our Mouthes must not Christ chew:
            This Supper (then) Words Seale, makes not this true.
            This Reason's Eagle-ey'd, in truth quicke-sighted:
            And what It sees, is quickly erudited,
            This Reason seemes with radient Sun-beames written:
            With so pure Light, the sight is. thereby, smitten.
            But now, here's one, and one in stead of All:
            Which, thunder-throttles Romes faith mysticall.
            
               If, vnder, shew of Bread, Christs flesh be made:
            Are snares of death in this flesh closely laide?
            
               Henrie the seuenth, Emp'rour of Germanie,
            
            By Poyson in a Masse (foule fact) did die.
            But, sure, Christs flesh, with Poyson, ne're, was mixt:
            True Life, not Death, is to Christs flesh affixt.
            Tis strange, Christs flesh ith' Poyson did not die:
            When venome in that Murthering-Masse did lie.
            I wonder, when the Frier, ith' Fier, did throw
            The Host: whether Christs Flesh he did it know.
            Fond foole, thy learned lectures thee confound:
            And thine owne cords, haue thee in snares fast bound.
            What need I striue t'oppose, Thee with my Shield?

            And, when Christ (first) his Body made our meate:
            
            He did, himselfe, in forme and substance eate.
            For, what he to his twelue-Disciples gaue;
            
               Himselfe (I thinke) did eate; This, all Feasts craue.
            And (sure) that Vine whose Wine Christ then did drinke,
            Gaue plentie of our Sauiours Bloud (I thinke)

            So oft, his Soule from's Body torne hath he.
            For (I beleeue) his Soule they cannot bake:
            Their foule-mouth'd-Masse, thereof no power can take.
            If Thou'lt on points (as Vowels Vassall) stand;
            And not permit true iudgement thee command:
            As Bread Christs Body is (witnesse Gods Writ)
            
            So is the Cup, his Bloud; (Truth prouing it.)
            
               Any Cup, forg'd, by any, any Art;
            
            To th'Testament in Christs bloud, doth conuert.
            Nor was (O Christ) blest Marie, more thy Mother,
            
            Than Goddesse-Masse would be to thee another.
            
            Nor were thy Bones (O Christ) broke on the Crosse:
            
            But Popelings Teeth bruise, breake them, short as Mosse.
            Nor could one Body, all Christs Guests suffice,
            To take least part thereof, their Soules chiefe price.
            
            And whilst heau'n, earth, (at once) this flesh containe:
            His flesh continuous, Christ cannot retaine.
            And, mouldie Bread (we all know) Wormes will breed;
            
               Which, from Christs Flesh ('tis plaine) cannot proceed.
            And Wine kept long in Cups will (sure) waxe tart:
            But, thy sweet Bloud (O Christ) still cheeres my heart.
            And in thy hand, crucifi'd flesh, didst keepe:

            And when his Skill the Masse-Priest list to show,
            A coate of crums he giues and takes God fro.
            When Magicke sounds the Misser once giues out:
            The flesh is fled, the Meale gone out of doubt.
            This Maker of his Maker, moues his Lips;

            Christs Body, as it was, in All, the same.
            
            Imbak't in flesh, incarnate in the Bread:
            Christ, in the banisht Meale, is couered.

               Old-Rome (if we may true Historians trust)
            Now in new-Rome lies buried in the dust.
            Papistry is a Sprig sprung-vp from Hell:
            
            An All-vice-bearing Branch, whose Boughs excell.
            Rome is a Den of Theeues, Worlds common-Stewes:
            A beastly Cell from whence all Sinne issues.
            He, that knowes not, Rome on seuen Hills to sit:
            Is ignorant in Stories, hath no Wit.

            While Pope, Siricius, Priests their wiues gaine-saies:

            Oft, Infants Golgothaes haue witnessed.
            Oh how much better were their foule Vowes broke?
            Than of Lewd Liues to beare so shamefull Yoke.
            Masculine Vertues ne're to Rome befall:
            Things carnall fit not men Spirituall.
            
            Oh, Romes Faith all her Males Emasculates:
            The World, with Pregnant Virgins exornates.
            And that her most pure Church, may purer be,
            
               Pure Friers, from their pure Nunnes pure Broods may see.
            Many a nimble Night-mare Sp'rit is knowne,
            To make such pure Sp'rit-hanted Virgins groane.
            Wiues of their owne thei'l none, Neighbours haue these:
            In such Flesh (may be) they can God well please.
            
               Religion, thus, hath foam'd vp Luxurie:
            A Lazie Life bred many a Prodigie.
            
            But yet (I hope) Romes Church and Chaire to pleasure,
            
               Thais (ith' Church) may iustly purchase treasure.
            Besides, much Gaine, much Godlinesse makes grow:
            No stinking Sauour can from Lucre flow.
            Oh, must Romes Corban, Temples pure prophane?
            Must God take Gifts from Strumpets filthy gaine?
            To horrid Whoredomes dost thou Pardons grant?
            From all good men all pardon thou must want.
            Captines haue Freedome, not for Ill, but Good:
            
            This Freedome was procur'd by Christs blest Blood.

            Is but gilt ore, Religion, Cruelty.
            
            Many of this Christ-preaching holy Hoste,
            
            Build Heau'n in Word, in Life build vp Hell most.
            
               Whoredome with these is a small-Sinne, and they,
            
               Guilty themselues, milde Mulcts vpon it lay.
            Thus, Rome one Stewes, these Staines permits in any:
            All Rome is (now) one Stewes, where first were many.
            
            Bishops, sweet Swarmes, in euer'y Cell, Muncks, Friers,
            
            Are Fathers, All; who this deny, are Lyers.
            For, they that Children get, must Fathers be:
            I know th'are Such; This Reason's firme for me.
            Haue I not stir'd this muddy Ditch of thine?
            Shall I thee shew the Popes Guarde soft and fine?
            Romes Purple Peeres, and Latian Cedars tall,
            Cardinall Chorus, glorious vnto all;
            For Worldly Ioyes, Earths Toyes no iot contending,
            Doe euen contemne, what each New-Moone can send-in.
            With Visage Sage, Gownes Flame-like, red Hats fine:
            Oh how their Liues doe shew, their Zeale doth shine?
            But truely (truth to say) their purple Clothes,
            
            Waxe red, being di'd
                  â€¢
                in Blood and bloody Oathes.
            Christs Lambes they Butcher with inhumane spight:
            Thus, their Roabes red, thus waxe their Bonnets bright.
            
               Red-caps, disdaine pure Wine, drinke yee pure Blood:
            The Spirit springing thence, is much more good.
            
               Thus, by such Ghostly guides Christs Flocks are fed:
            And Card'nals Functions are thus finished.
            
               Thus, Christ they serue, thus Christians liues they liue:
            
               Thus, vnto Christ they holy Worship giue.
            These Fathers fitly may be props of Hell:
            But, of Gods House, they cannot, halfe so well.
            Why seeke I Samplars? since full Stories writ,
            Romes Fathers filthy Liues set out most fit.
            Euen Sol doth shame, their cursed Crimes to see:
            My modest Muse may now (then) silent bee.
            Heere, oft-times fell a Starre, from a cleere Skie,
            A Cloudie Day brought vnchaste Chastitie.
            
            Romane Records doe filthy Foggs exhale;
            Her Scene obscene is as a lothsome tale.
            Rome, Vicious Rome, the Worlds Metropolis,
            
            The Metrapolitan Popes foule Chaire is.
            
               Gomorrha, scarce excell'd it in strange Crimes:
            So many Sin-Monsters raigne in their Climes.
            And, sure, but by that-fire which All must fry,
            Their frozen-Sins, nought els can liquifie.
            Rich Rome, for triumphs, Rome, most honoured:
            Is now the Empires Tayle, which (once) was Head.
            
            A Shambles of much Murther, Sincke of Sin:
            
               Shames Cell, Lusts Seate, a place to quaffe Wine in.
            Where you may many Harpeies, Mastiues see:
            Where proud Ambition, fly Sedition be.

               That Simon Peter was at Rome, Who knowes?
               That Simon Magus was there, All Truth showes.
            
            OF Rules, reform'd to strange got-gaine I write:
            Effected by the Popes Command and Might.
            
            Who laps-vp, wraps-vp, all the world like Floods:
            
            Like Water scoures, deuoures all Neighb'ring-Goods.
            
            A priuate Plague Romes monstrous Maw doth fret:
            The more she gets, the more she gapes to get.
            Furred with Gold is euery Popelings Bull:
            (As Load-stones Steele) This, yellow-gold can pull.
            Let Shauelings serue the Pope, their Patrone graue:
            For, at his Pleasure, they their Treasure haue.
            Heere, Ezraes siluer-Sense, Moses doth ope:
            To All, all wrong is right, if Gold they grope.
            Great Golden Glisters purge all Crimes committed:
            The Guilty, are by argent Agents quitted.
            
               Thus to the World affy'd, not crucifide:
            Worlds thirsty Loue, Romes Father hath euen fry'de.
            His Workes Hee workes by sacred Policy:
            But, these to God are Atheisme most high.
            Christs Throne is Heau'nly, Heau'nly things doe muse:
            But Papall Pride, an earthly Throne doth chuse.
            Yet, vaine's this Choice, which chooseth Earthly things:
            For, by such choice, toward God hee folly brings.
            Satan stalkes, walkes, seeking whom to deuoure:
            The same doth Romes Cosmopolite each houre.
            That this Possessour poore may gape for moe,
            'Twixt Riches, Rapine, his great Thirst doth grow.
            
               Bohemoth hopes to drinke vp Iordan dry:
            And none Romes gaping Gulph can satisfie.
            With vnseene Shackles, Law-snares intricate,
            This sharking Sepheard, Sheepe can captiuate:

            Seekes not thy Lambes, but Lands t' himselfe he takes.
            Good Manners, not great Mannours God best prizeth:
            His Steward Mannours Loues, manners despiseth.
            For, This Priests Polipheme and Atlas stout,
            By these Tricks, trimes &amp; props Gods House throughout.
            Most craftily strange Grins and Gins hee laies.
            His hollow-heart hath thousand wilie-waies.
            
            Of which, Gold-Bringer, brauest of them all,

               Amphisbaena; serues two Lords:
            The World good seruice; God, hee none affords.
            The Gifts of Good-gift-Giuers make them Popes:
            Who want at home, at home may sit, like Mopes.
            
            Vice-Christ, Lawes firmes, and them repeales by Bribes.
            But, hee Gods Lawe, prostitutes and proscribes.
            
               
               Iohn Baptist, Herod did forbid to wed
            His Brothers wife; This Popes haue suffered.
            
               Paul became All, to All, a Soule to get:
            
               All Vice-Christs care is on his owne gaine set.
            Oh Christ, Thy Guests Thou'lt first inuite, then vrge:
            Thy Vicar, will them threaten, force, and scourge.
            Thy Head (O Christ) a Crowne of thornes did teare:
            
               Vice-Christ, a Triple Crowne of Gold doth weare.
            Thus, strangely better, is this Head Papall,
            Than Peter, Paul, Iohn Baptist, CHRIST, and all.
            This Fee-Fowler, Wealth-watching Argus fly,
            Spreadeth Gold-catching Snares, most cunningly,
            
               Sinners by Summes being tax'd; Is Coine so vicious?
            
               Gold (sure) is Heresie: T'haue Wealth, pernicious.
            Thus, guilty-Gold, in Bird-lime Lawes is caught:
            And Nothing deadly, but a man t'haue Nought.
            
            If Gold-death Antidots, yer dead, thou haue:
            From deadly-Sin thy Soule He'le (surely) saue.
            For, Romes Bullipotent, indulgent Pope,
            All euill of paine and guilt remooues, I hope.
            Touching least Trifles, hee doth Lawes ordaine:
            All which are quickly voide by precious Gaine.
            
            The truncke is little, whence a Fly sups blood:
            And to the Pope least Lawes bring greatest good.
            
            At Toyes Hee'l rage, winkes at most wicked things:
            
            If happy Gaine fly forth with golden wings.
            
            
               Sins shackles shaken off, thou'lt quickly see,
            And pure Soules fly to Heau'n, if Gold them free.
            
               Giue to the Pope, and dare each damned deed:
            Actours foule Acts no punishment can breed.
            All's pardonable to Gift-giuers All:
            Their Sin's as Vendible, as Veniall.
            
            
               Thus theirs at Rome the Purses dire decay:
            But no soules health, no forcing sinne away.

            All vnction, all compunction is from gold:
            And he wants Nought, that hath most yellow mold.
            
            Romes Mother-Church, her Teats ties-vp from none:

               Gold-griping Eloquence pleades free from scath:
            Such power Romes Rhetorician (Riches) hath.
            Besides, at Rome (whens'ere no causes be)
            
               Cause-pleaders, straight, cause-coyners turn'd, you'l see.
            Here Lawyers may fell Lawes, most lawfully;
            Because by Bribes a Lawyers Bench they buy.
            
               In plodding Plebeans many matters, they
            
               Despise dispatch; deuise and watch delay.
            If Wealth come, Rome will welcome thy dispute:
            If thou bring nought, then stay at home, be mute.

            THE NINTH SATYRE.
            
               The ARGVMENT.
               At Rome, by Rapine there's a Golden-Age,
               By Crueltie, there's still an Iron Age.
            
            WIth Gods Law to dispense, makes deadly wounds;
            Yet, Rome does This, and All things else confounds.
            
               Right, Faith, and Troth, Oathes, Promises, Vowes giuen;
            (These wrong'd, thou'lt say, are keyes of hel, not heauen)
            She wrongs, vnbinds, breaks, kicks at: thus past doubt,

            Why should not she free all with others pelfe?
            Who, all else (soone) dispenseth, of her selfe.
            Popes will's a Gen'rall-Rule: dost doe his minde?

            O woefull wracke, such and so many slaine:
            This, worke they would; but wrought their worke in vaine,
            
            Is this life-giuing true Christianitie?
            
            Is this firme faith, pure Popish Pietie?
            
            
               Ill deeds to good-ends, None may enterprise:
            And yet may Rome doe such that Rome may rise?
            Had all our heads vpon one Necke (then) stood;
            As Nero (once) desir'd (Romes man of blood:)
            
               That Necke, with one cracke of sulphurious smoke:
            
            Had beene smit-off, had not God stayd the stroke,
            
            O wretched Worke, to which all woes are due:
            Great wracke, more great, than may be held for true:
            Who present saw All, noted, All, he saw:
            To trust all seene, his owne eyes scarce could draw.
            With such fierce flames of quicke sulphurious scath,
            Doth Rome promoue, approue her Cath'licke Faith.
            
            Alas, Christs truth into Kings Courts, ne're came,
            With Swords, with Poysons, Pistols, Powder-flame;
            Couer'd with Satans knauish-cloakes, to slay,
            Till Romes Philistims grew so great, so gay.
            Did Peter fish for Kings in streames of blood?
            
            No, Belzebub can fish best in that flood.
            To be catcht-vp in Bloud, as Peters fish,
            
            And pay so deare for Rome, Ile neuer wish.
            
               O thus, euen thus, each Romish-Traitour, hath
            A Vault to hide his Treason, as his Faith.
            
            Oft bloody blasts from Romes Tarpeian Towre,
            Brake forth, and did thousands of Soules deuoure.
            Fire-spitting Brats, igneous Ignatius bred:
            If Iesuites be his Brood (as so 'tis sed.)
            
               Religion hath beene euer fring'd with fraud,
            
            And Piety beene made foule Treasons Bawd.
            
            While Iesuites doe what them the Pope hath bidden:
            Vnder their Mealy-mouthes foule Fiends lye hidden.
            The Churches Weapons (once) were Prayers and Teares:
            
            Romes Weapons (now) Swords, Fire-brands, Poysons, Speares.
            
            
               Viperous-Imps are in Romes bowels bred:
            And truely barbarous, boystrous is her Head.
            
            
               Boasters in Blood, in Fire, in Swords, in Rapes:
            
            Thou'dst Papists iudge; foule Deuils in Mens faire shapes.
            Though many props doe Romes Religion stay;
            Their Chiefest hold on Sword and Fire they lay.
            But, whil'st thus oft their Flocks they fleece, o're-throw:
            They Signes of Romish Faith and False-hood show.
            
               Within, foule Crimes; without, Reuenge they beare:
            Acts against Christ none vnaueng'd appeare.
            Alas, why by two deaths, thought Tisiphone,
            
            On ours to prey, and then to slay her owne.
            
            For, Rockey Peters Chayre, Faiths Rock to bee:
            Thou, by Salt-Peter, Powder, Fire, wouldst see.
            But now, the World their Papall pranckes espies:
            And Romish Rhea shames at hir owne Lyes.
            Romes Ram-like Actors came vpon the Stage:
            But God oppos'd their hatefull Actiue-Rage.
            
            O Rome, thou buildest Nests; Birds, canst not hatch:
            Acknowledge then, Gods Hands, Gods Eyes thee watch.
            
               Thus Babels brood her Birth could not bring out:
            Whereof prime pregnant Hope, made them past doubt.
            Damn'd Dirae sighed and hells furies fum'd:
            Yea, Plutos pallace shooke, as nigh consum'd:
            Because their hellish hopes tooke none effect,
            And heauen did timely their deceit derect.
            Reioyce blest Brittaine in this New-saluation:
            And keepe That day with endlesse recordation.
            Christ freed thy Soule from hell fire, and this fire
            
            Than euer any flame, to hels, came nigher.
            That day which they Britaines blacke-Day would see,
            Nouembers fifth, Britaines bright-day shall be.
            The day was Tews-day, but by Popish spight,
            
               Papists Ash-Wednesday, it had beene more right.
            
               Daniell, deliuered from the Lions den,
            Had not such cause to praise God, as We, then:
            For, rage of roaring Lyons, oft, is tam'd:
            But, Romes fierce Wrath is quenchlessely enflam'd.
            For euer, then, fell Papists, howle, lament,
            Your Popish Powder-Pieties Intent.
            
            For, all the Oceans floods will ne're make cleane

            Let's then by Law be to our homes confinde.
            For doubtlesse, this detestable foule fact
            
            Was counsell'd, courag'd, by the Popes compact.
            For, he which bids doe, whats almost done: he

            Had he not cast Paternall care from's heart:

               Who from his Bubble-bellowing Bulls boiles out,
            All Caco-curses, hellish Broiles about.
            And thus he saies: Let one-day England make,
            
            One Graue, whose note on future day shall shake.
            
               Vices Vice-roy, or Vice It selfe, is Hee,

            We read, that when the High-Priest vs'd to enter
            Gods Holyest-Place: without Blood Hee'd not venture.
            So, Romes High-Priest vnlesse some blood hee taste,
            To's Shiloh Synagogue doth seldome haste.
            Thus one of many facts we haue found out:
            Heare Others (now) not better Ones, I doubt.
            To All Sins, fuell this Dispenser findes:
            And much fine-Flowre out of Crimes-corne he grinds.
            Popes Pardons purge foule Homicides most white:
            Makes blots and spots of bloody Daggers bright.
            And if, this Priest of Romes rare Rocke, dispense,
            
            Thou quit maist sit free from all foule offence.
            Or, if the Lawes strict Act thee guilty make:
            Deaths deadly Act on Thee no hold shall take.
            Antichrists Bull and Christs Blood are nere kin:
            For, that, as this, pardons and pures All Sin.
            If Romes blest Bishop warres, wiles, periurie,
            
            Commands as iust; iust they are, instantly.
            For, the Popes pleasure is all deeds direction:
            'Tis Law of Lawes to yeeld him sole subiection.
            Thou, then, Who bids, not what Hee bids, take heed:
            And doe his Will, with Courage and with Speed.
            And doe his Will; for Christ did All Command,
            To the Lord God of Romes high Hests to stand.
            His Fist, Arme, Shoulders, Warlike Engines are:
            Least Hee grow Mad (then) haue a speciall care.
            
               For, first, these regall Rites Christ Peter gaue:
            And to Romes Peter, Prot
                     â€¢
                  -Pope most braue.
            But, Romes rich Patriarke to be Peters Heire,
            
            Saint Peters Chaire and Miter, There, declare.
            All Crownes, Thrones, Kingdomes, through Earths ample scope;
            Christ gaue to Peter, Peter to the Pope.
            
            And Hee which Fathers moues, Himselfe approues,
            
               Patrician; But, Hee, Father Peter moues.
            Therefore, all th' honour Christ to Peter gaue,
            Our Lord the Pope (I surely hope) must haue.
            And, in prime Peter All rare Acts you see,
            Must this Petreian-Patrons Actions bee.
            The word is vaine, vertue comes not by kinde:
            Saint Peters off-Spring wee excepted finde.
            But, Peters pious Life, and last Confession:
            In the Popes Chaire, find no Chaire, nor Impression.
            Peters faint-Faith (O Christ) Thee thrice denide:
            Full oft the Pope (Vice-Christ) doth Thee deride.
            Yet, Peters teares shew'd Peter penitent:
            But, no man euer saw the Pope repent.
            Lastly, for Thee, Peter did gladly dye:
            The Pope thy Members murthers cruelly.
            See, who'l deny the Pope to haue (as due)
            Sure Shape, Staffe, Stoole, of Peter Martyr true,
            Rules not wise Palinurus in Romes Ocean,
            
            Peters tall Ship, without least Slip in's motion?
            Peters Ship (sure) on many a Rocke and Shelfe
            
            Hee driues; and is the Ships worst Rocke Himselfe.

            THus Romes Dictator All the World directs:
            Thus Hee Gods holy Bible, foules, infects.
            Thus Sacrilegiously Gods Gifts Hee'l sell,
            
               Simon (not Peter) Magus matching well.
            Thus faines hee Fancies fond, Hereticall;
            Of Heretikes being Head Spirituall.
            Thus Monarchs hee to iarres and Warres incites:
            And like a Martiall Priest, with two Swords fights.
            Thus Popes permission out-laws Lawes most iust:
            And Canons (when hee lists) Canons forth thrust.
            Thus Cai'phas calls blacke white, wrong right, and still,
            All gaine is good: and Lawfull what Hee will.
            Thus Rome runs-ore with Wanes of Wickednesse:
            Though Gods wise Steward dwell there, ne'rethelesse.
            Thus Pro-Christ, Procrust that rate Theefe, is like,
            To Christs true Tipe and Pattern most vnlike.
            Thus Hee Christs Worke promoues by slaughters fly:
            With sitting still a Stocke, Blocke, Dullard dry.
            Thus Hee sels Smoake, and turnes his Lead to Gold:
            Thus finally Hee robbeth Christs Sheep-fold.
            Is not this Prophet (thinke you) from God sent?

            All these faire Sprigs, fat Pigs, Romes Sow doth breed:
            From Romes most pregnant Dam, such Broods proceed.
            Heere thou maist see Christs Name make many white:
            Whose diuelish deeds make their liues black as night.
            Their houres deuotion is their deuoration:
            And to their throat to giue a fat oblation.
            
            But some doe fast, that they by Fasts may merit:
            And thereby thinke (fond fooles) Heau'n to inherit.
            Each one his Sect obserues obsequiously,
            Does Deeds forbidden, bidden Deeds doth fly.
            This Sect, weares Linnen; That will woollen weare:

            Their order, Rites, and Rules, doe all excell.
            Each, for Religions Rule, his Order hath:
            Their Orders order Fooles; disorder Faith.
            
            Mongst all their honoured Sects by Order graced:
            Romes Order rules, Gods Order is thence chased.
            Alas, doth Romes Schismatike traine by fractions
            Sound praises Harpe, or discords Dramme to factions.
            At Festiuals approch, Good-Workes they praise:
            But to performe them vse most long delayes.
            
               Feasts ornate, onerate, each moneth, each day:
            That, all the yeere (almost) brings dayes of play.
            Then, with their Feete (not Hearts) to Church they goe:
            Where prayers, performance, all their fingers show.
            And who'd not sweare that they to Christ pray not?
            When, as amaz'd, they pray, but know not what.
            Thus they their frequent Mattens Vespers vtter:
            And Orizons to Hee-Saints Shee-Saints mutter.
            Thus, for Hearts Vowes, Harps various harmony,
            They giue to God, Songs for Sincerity.
            
            I oft admire, Romes Bacchus-like oblation:
            Tis strange, yet see, things of more admiration.
            
            Popes Bulls, Popes Pardons, Oh how deere they be?
            Yet, this deere ware's not worth a Rush to mee.
            Braue Balsome, th' Agnus-Dei, Fooles to gull:
            I hold as deare as is a Locke of Wooll.
            
            In Romes rare Riches and facetious-Treasure,
            
            None but meere Mad-men, or fond-fooles, take pleasure.
            
               Hee that is wise, Romes Buls, blowne bubbles makes:
            Hee's wise, Romes Fathers Lead, as Feathers takes.
            What speake I of the Frauds and lying Tricks?
            
            From which, this holy Sire much money picks.
            Romes Popes, the Worlds prime Pedlers, Chapmen braue,
            Much gaine, from many Wares created haue.
            Are Merry-Stewards of all sorts of toyes:
            Chiefe Schoole-Masters, of Schooles of ioylesse Ioyes.
            
            Yea, Romes quick-Sight, such money-Snares doth frame,
            As, to relate, doe want, Meanes, Number, Name.
            
            That gaine may grow, and Rome may Riches see:
            Base Hucksters, Pedlers, Panders, Popes will bee.
            What-ere Romes fingers feele, his eye doth spy:
            His Heele kicks-at, is holyer, instantly.
            For, from this holy Prelates spicey-lips,
            
            Into All-things, rare sweetnesse strangely skips.
            If Satans filthy throat beltch-vp Infection:
            The Pope from's mouth breathes forth a fine Protection.
            
            Besides, His holy Breath (strange to be told)
            Makes all his Sons, the Holy-Ghost to hold.
            Creating Masse-Priests, hands on them hee layes:
            Breathes; then, Receiue the Holy-Ghost, hee saies.
            Since Christ said, so; Hee must needs wicked bee:
            Sayes, the Pope may not say't as well as Hee.
            
            What-so is Christs, the holy Father claimes:
            And, thisâ–ª the Head of all sound Faith hee names:
            For, whatsoe're Gods-Word our Sauiour gaue,
            The Pope, Christs Little-Ape, the same must haue:
            As to Ierusalem, an Asse, Christ bare:
            So, should the Pope ride Asses, Horses spare.
            Alas, one-day, would nothing neere suffice,
            To reckon-vp all Romes fond Popperies.
            
            
               By great good hap, to hunt for store of Coine,
            
            The Pope hath got neat Gins and Engines fine.
            Since, neuer Bishop thriu'd by Subtiltie:
            The Popes Throne onely thriues by knauerie.
            
            Faire Marts of Arts, and Crafts to get much gold,
            He hath ordain'd; where mud for money's sold.
            Anti-Christ, first Babe-like, then a Roarer stout,
            To his great Grand-Sires dealt rich doales about.
            But, now, his Tributes haue a Feuer got:
            
               Which Griefe, to cure, he must contriue a plot.
            What once was held Iupiters Image braue:

            So strong, long, loose a Faith all Popelings finde:
            To trust whats'ere Popes wills their conscience binde.

            The Master of Romes Market, sells vaine things:
            And to Gods House, he, thus, base Riches brings.
            He makes his Buyers, re-buy things fore-bought;
            And yet the Sale his wares abateth nought.
            He giues what's sold, what's giuen, he'le keepe, he'le hold:
            And the same-thing to many, at once, is sold.

            But he whose Faith here failes, is freest from feares.
            Their mumbling strange, makes deuills, them obay:

               This truth, than Truth it selfe more truth must winne.

            Thou searchest Tombes, thy Reliques to encrease:
            Not suffering buried Bodies rest in peace.
            Thus thou to th' vnknowne-land of Reliques goest:
            And all thy Reliques all the World-ore showest.
            Thus what with Reliques and such superstition,
            
            To thee (O Christ) they scarce can giue admission.
            Yet, all is sound Religion: for, hereby,
            From the Popes Coat, all Errour's forc'd to flie.
            Thus, he t' himselfe alone Christs Church fast chaines:
            Here, dwels pure Truth; here, Faith, no Fraud remaines.
            
               And now the Old-worls mustie Household-stuffe,

            Much, now, swims-vp, which, sunke to th' bottome lay:
            And store of Rubbish shines, now, cleare as clay.
            The Image braue of graue Antiquitie,
            
            Hath Signes of new, Signes of true dignitie.
            
            
               Old Lawes, old Sawes, Primitiue-Church, most sure,
            All old-Traditions, old-Religion pure:
            
               All are at Rome, seene plaine, yet dost thou doubt?
            Pure and sure Faith to dwell, all Rome throughout?
            Why, hence, 'tis plaine, they Faith retaine, that they
            Haue Gods pure worship banisht quite away.
            And Rome for all her new-come Nouelties,
            Straight brings out Signes of old Antiquities.
            
            And hereby Papists, Gibeonites, are growne:

            So many Bones, they'l of one Martyr show;

            And oft for Martyrs bones, such bones are showne,
            As formerly, were Hogs and Dogs bones knowne.
            
               Scarcely one tombe, one coarses leauings keepes;
            So quicke, each relique from Sepulchers creepes.
            Rome, teeming Rome of fraud and cousenage full:
            These Guiles holds godly, grossely men to gull.
            But He that's well in's wits, spits at them all:
            And smites them with Gods Sword Spirituall.
            
            Alas, how much of Christs most holy Blood,
            
            Is daily drunke by Romes dry Saints so good?
            Yet, a poore drop of Christs his blood most pure,

            His combe is cut, his power impair'd, of late,
            Nor buts he halfe so hard with's three-crown'd pate.
            
            This great Cumanus, yerst, did Monarchs fright:
            But, since his hornes were hew'd, they scorne his might.
