            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

            To the gentle Reader.
            IT may be, gentle Reader, that the baſeneſſe of the Title, wil cauſe a contempt of this Booke, as the homely ſhape of Alcibiades tables without, made men thinke, they had bene of no better forme within. But as they, being vnfolded, were found very faire: So per aduenture vnder ſo plain a cloke,

thou ſhalt ſee ſuche ſtuffe, as may content thy minde. I remember that when the Florentines ſēt an embaſſage to the king of Naples who behaued himſelfe very wiſely, the King did aske what maner a man he was in his coūtrey, and when it was tolde him that he was an Apothecary: If the Apothecaries, (quoth the king) be ſo wyſe and learned in Florence, what be their

Phyſitians? If I ſhall ſhew thee, that the ſetter forth of this treatiſe was a tailer of Florence, thou maiſt vſe the kings curteſie, and embrace the booke the better, for if tailers be ſo wel giuen ther, what be they that profeſse lerning? A Couper was the occaſiō why he toke pain this way: which Couper of a plaine man, had a good natural diſcourſe, and as ſome men when they be olde, will

talke ſometime with themſelues: ſo the talke that olde Iuſt the Couper hadde with himſelf, when he coulde not ſlepe, did miniſter matter to the maker of this preſente booke: who by other occaſion hath made diuers other to his cōmendatiō, in the Toſcane tong. I finde that occaſion may doe muche. For had not I had once a man, that vſed often to talk with him ſelf, and a felow, whoſe

name was Iuſt, as it might wel be, I had no more remē
               bred the talk of father Iuſt of Florence, which I red when I was ther, and thought no more of. But as Iohn Baptiſta Gellie, for ſo is the Tailer called, and for his wiſedom, chief of the vulgar vniuerſitie of Florence, when I was ther, did publiſh theſe communications of Iuſt the Couper, and his Soule, Gathered by one

ſir Byndo his nephew, and a Notarie. So I haue for a paſsing of the time, cauſed the ſame to be put in Engliſh, that my Countrey men may ſee how learning may appere in all ſortes of men, and they deſerue praiſe whē they will vſe it well. And ſo (o Reader,) maiſt thou vſe thy pleaſure, and doe as thou ſhalt thinke good.

                  The firſt Reaſoning. IVST, and his SOVLE.
               
                  IT is well nighe day, and I can not ſléepe, it ſhal be better to riſe &amp; do ſomwhat, than on this faſhion to lie in bed and not ſléepe: for I can not thinke, that this only ſlumbring can be very healthfull.
               
                  Soule.
                  Well, I poore wretch may now aſſure my ſelf, that I ſhall neuer haue reſt nor cōtentation in this bodie, neyther yong nor olde.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  What voice doe I heare, who is there?
               
               
                  Soule.
                  When he was yong I helde

him excuſed for his want of Liuing, although he held me alwayes occupied in this his handy craft. For firſt it is neceſſarie to prouide for the néedes of the Bodie, and then to ſéeke for the perfection of the Soule.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  Who is there, I ſay? Who is that that whiſtleth in mine eare?
               
               
                  Soule.
                  But nowe he is olde, &amp; hath ſufficiently, I thought ſurely, that if he had giuen him ſelfe to contemplation, &amp; ſomtime liued half in a tr
                        •
                     ce, that I hauing no cauſe to miniſter ſpirit to his ſenſes, might withdrawe me to my ſelfe, and enioy thoſe intellections of the firſte principles that I brought with me, ſince that I haue wt him learned none newe.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  Do I ſléepe or no? it ſéemeth in my head: but ſoft, it may be ſome reume, that makes a man thinke, he hath whiſtling in his braine.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  And nowe hée folowyng the maner of olde men (whiche the older they be, the more couetous they are)

as ſoone as hée waketh, hée ryſeth to worke.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  Oh, ſhe files hir wordes, and is in my heade, and ſpeaketh euill of olde men. What thing may this be? Ieſu, Ieſu, God graunt that no ſpirite be entred into my body.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  Stay thy ſelf Iuſt, and be not afrayde: for I am one that loues thée more, and haue more care to preſerue thée, than any other that is in the worlde.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  I can not tel ſo great loue nor ſo great preſeruation: It is a greate gentleneſſe to enter into a mans hed and neuer leaue babling. As for me, I beleue thou art the wicked whiſtle, In nomine Patris, &amp; Filij, &amp; Spiritus ſancti. Amen.
                  
               
               
                  Soule.
                  Although it be well to bleſſe thée as thou doſte, bicauſe it groweth of a good meaning, procéeding from a good faith in thée, (without the which all your workes be dead) yet now it is nothing to the purpoſe. For I am a

chriſtian as thou art, yea if I dyd not beleue in Chriſt, thou ſhouldeſt be no chriſtian.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  Séeing thou feareſt not the Croſſe, thou art not the whiſtle as I thought, but more like to bée the ſpirite, that as men ſay, walketh all the night, and therfore I wil ſay a prayer to make thée goe hence. Procul recidant ſomnia, &amp; noctium phantaſmata, hostem

                  Soule.
                  Ah foole, if thou kneweſt who I am, thou wouldſt not ſéeke to driue me away, but rather pray me to tary ſtill, for if I ſhould go from thée, thou couldeſt not liue.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  Thou art full of words: doſt thou thinke it a prety ſporte to heare a noyſe thus talking in a mans head, which haſte made me almoſte beſide my ſelfe.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  Thou haſte well ſayde, not knowyng how that thou art halfe beſide thy ſelfe. But when thou ſhalte

know who I am, thou wilt not maruell.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  Then tell me what thou art, that I may aſſure my ſelfe of thée.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  I am content, knowe thou Iuſt, that I am thy ſoule.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  My ſoule how?
               
               
                  Soule.
                  Yea thy ſoule, by whome thou art a man.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  Oh howe can that be, am not I my ſoule my ſelfe?
               
               
                  Soule.
                  No. For thou art one thing, and thy ſoule an other, and Iuſt the Couper of Sainct Peter the greate, is an other.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  If I am not Iuſt the Couper, then I am made an other, &amp; therefore I ſayde well, that thou wert ſome euill thing, which wouldeſt doe to me, as was done to Graſſe the carpenter, who was made beleue, that he was become an other man: but that ſhalt thou not doe by me, for I will ſtande conſtant.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  Be content Iuſt, and moue

not thy ſelf: for there is nothing that doth more hurt reaſon, and the vnder ſtanding of man, than anger. Wherfore quiet thy ſelf, and beleue me, for that that I tel thée, is ye truth it ſelf.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  Wel, let vs put caſe that I am not Iuſt (as thou ſayſt) but ſée, I doe not graunt thée it (for if I did ſo, what would other do) who am I then?
               
               
                  Soule.
                  Thou art the body of Iuſt.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  And who art thou?
               
               
                  Soule.
                  The ſoule of Iuſt.
               
               
                  Iuſt.

                      what maner thing is Iuſt
               
               
                  Soul.
                  We two together, for neither is the body nor the ſoule, the mā, but that cōpound thing that coms of them both. And mark, that whē the ſoule is ſeparate fro the body, it is called man no more, but a carcas, after the Latin tong, and a deade body, after y• vulgar ſpéech, ſo as thou ſpakeſt before, when thou ſaidſt, y• wert half beſide thy ſelf.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  This is true, and I can not denie it. But heare me, if thou art my ſoule as thou ſayſt, what means this

thy beginnyng to talke of thy ſelfe, without me, ſhalte thou euer depart from me▪ Alas, I would not that, for then I ſhould die as thou ſayſt.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  Haue no doubt of y• Iuſt, for I haue no leſſe will to remaine with thée, thā thou haſt to remain with me.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  O bleſſed be y• my ſwete ſoule.
               
               
                  Soule.

                  There haue ben many cauſes that haue kept me from doing of it, &amp; the principal cauſe hath ben thineage not apt vnto it: for in thine Infancie and Childehoode, thy members and

partes be not apt to my ſeruices, and in thy growing and youthly time, the paſſions of the ſenſitiue parte, that then be moſt vehement, &amp; in thy ripe yeares, care how to liue at luſt, hathe not ſuffred me to withdrawe▪ me into my ſelfe, as I haue done now, when I am not letted of like things▪ although as yet▪ I can not do it, as I would, for thou being afrayde euery houre not to loſe that thou haſt (as other old couetous men) thou doeſt not ſuffer me to reſt one halfe houre in the day: for when thou haſt eaten or ſleptte, thou runneſt to thy work, wherby I being forced to miniſter vitall ſpirites to thy ſenſes and thy members, I neuer haue any reſt: and of this did I lamēt at the beginning (if thou remēbreſt) when I began to talke with my ſelf.

                  Yes, but thou haſte muche more loued thy ſelfe, and where thou oughteſt to haue loued thy ſelfe for my ſake, and haue made much of thy ſelfe, that I mighte the better haue wrought in thee mine operatiōs, thou haſt loued me for thy ſeruice: &amp; ſo the parte leſſe worthy &amp; leſſe noble, hath euer cōmāded ye more worthie &amp; more noble, as it doth notwithſtāding in ye moſt part of men, yt thou ſholdeſt not thinke thou art alone: therfore haue not I good cauſe to cōplain?

                  Thou beginneſt to trouble my brayne: till a man comes to the points of death, euery one ſaith ſo, but when death is preſent, the man changeth his fantaſy: remember our maſter y• went to pray in the gardin, to ſée if he coulde eſcape death.

                  Ah Iuſt, he did it not for that, but to ſhewe with theſe paſſions naturall that he was a man, as he had ſhewed by miracles, and with workes ſupernaturall, that he was God: but let

                  Thou doeſt as the Poet Daut ſaith in his banquets. All artificers not cunninge, doe impute all the errours they do, to the matter they work on: why diddeſt not thou ſay, bicauſe I am olde and haue the palſey, and miſſe the ſtone oftener than I hit it.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  That is true in déede, I cannot deny it, and would to God I did not ſo al ſoin other things, for I haue delite to do nothing, and I am come to ſuch a time of age, that euery thing is irkſom vnto me, and very pleaſure is vnpleaſant to me.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  And yet wouldſt thou not die.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  Doeſt thou not heare that I would not?

                  And doeſt not thou ſée that this life of thine is nothing but a death?
               
               
                  
                  Iuſt.
                  Though it be, I haue ſéene of them that be much more elder than I, and haue no téeth, and goe with theyr mouth to the grounde, and yet would not die: rather I wyll ſay vnto thée, that the elder a man is, the more doth death grieue him: and I haue ſéene the proofe in my ſelfe, for when ſoeuer my heade doth but ake, my heart quaketh, and I begin to ſay: Woulde to God this be not my laſt requeſt, for I didde not ſo when I was young, rather doe I remember, that I hadde a ſickneſſe that brought me euen to the port of an other world, and yet I neuer thought to dye, but rather laughed at them, that would haue hadde me confeſſed: ſo as if I had dyed then, I had gone withoute any care or griefe, whych nowe I ſhall not doe, for I thinke of nothyng elſe, and lyue euen as he made the declaration of the Tyrantes lyfe Dionyſius of Scicily, whych tyed a naked ſworde with a horſe haire, and hong it ouer his head.

                  And what is the cauſe Iuſt, as thou thinkeſt, wherefore death is more fearefull to olde folkes than to yong?
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  I thinke bicauſe they are more entangled with the world, in the which they haue liued ſo long.

                  Ah that is a very ſimple reaſon, and taketh place onely in

                     otyes as thou art, and I beleue thou haſte learned it of Trées, whych the longer they lyue, the déeper roote they make, and are then harde to be pulled vp: but by the reaſonable diſcourſe whych thou haſte, and long experience which thou oughteſt to haue by thy longe time thou haſt lyued, thou oughteſt to haue made a better reaſon.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  Be contente, thys may perhappes come of that thou ſayeſt, that a man who hathe lyued longe, and made a Iudgemente by longe experience more perfect, doth better knowe, howe goodly a thyng lyfe is to him,

and howe much he ought to eſtéeine it and haue it in price, wherefore it grieueth him the more to loſe it, thā it doth a yong man that doth not knowe it: As it would grieue a man more to loſe a iewel that knoweth the value therof, than it wold him that knoweth it not.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  This thy ſecond reaſon is not much worth neither, &amp; though it were true, it maketh no leſſe for hym that would ſay the contrary, than it doth for thée.

                  Which way? tell me.

                  Bicauſe if he that liueth getteth a iudgement, by the which he knoweth better the things, he ſhal knowe alſo better how full of miſerie our lyfe is. And if a man ſhould not hope for a better in the other world, he ſhould be the moſt miſerable and vnhappy creature in the vniuerſall worlde, which is manifeſtly againſt al right of reaſō, he being the moſt perfecte of all, &amp; hauing vnderſtanding, which is a moſt diuine thing: by the which not onely the holy

letters, but alſo the Pagans and Gentils, do cal him lorde of all other Creatures, and the ende of all other things, which they ſay are made of nature for him.

                  Howe canſt thou proue, that a man ſhould be the moſt vnhappy creature of the world, if he dyd not hope for a better life than this?

                  Bicauſe in this life he is much diſgraced, naked, without a houſe, not able to ſpeake, hauing nothing to eate, vnleſſe he getteth it; and when he hath it, cannot vſe it, vnleſſe it be of other dreſſed: wheras other beaſts be borne clad, ſome with one thing, ſome with an other, they haue their houſes, ſome vnder the earth, ſome in woods, ſome in flouds, and the earth bringeth forth all things nedefull for them, without any payne: and what teſtimony canſt thou haue more cléere of this, than Plinie, which in his conſideration of al things, was ſo angry with Nature, as he called hir mother of beaſts, and ſtepdame

of man.

                  Bicauſe, he y• ſhal handle theſe matters reaſonably &amp; without any affection, he wil conclude, that his felicity is not in this life, wher the other brute beaſts inferiour to him haue it (if they may neuertheleſſe be called happy) of y• which being certified by natural reaſō &amp; the light of fayth, he wil not much regarde lyfe, but rather be troubled: with a deſire to be out of it, and to go to the other, as they haue done that haue deſpiſed vice, &amp; gon by the way of vertue, ſo as if thou haſt no better reaſon, this is only in aparāce, &amp; cōcludeth nothing.

one Naum Groſſo, and Lance Goldeſmith liuing pleaſantly, and beleuing in apparaunce, not muche aboue the houſe top, yet at their deathe, the one called for a crucifixe, but woulde haue it giuen him by the hand of Donatello, that was dead. The other ſayd, I recommend my ſelf to him in the other worlde, that can do moſte, be it God or the deuil, and he that moſt may, let him moſt catche.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  Let theſe things go, for they haue more of brutiſhneſſe than of reaſon: and if thou remēbreſt, thou ſhalt finde, that in thy time, there haue ben halfe a ſcore &amp; more, whom thou haſt knowne to haue bē in their life ſcarce religious, &amp; haue ſéemed to beleue too litle, and yet haue liued morally, and as behoueth to reaſonable creatures, which at the point of death not beyng able neuer to quench a certaine prick of reaſon, and a certain deſire and acknowledgyngImmortalitie of the Soule. of Immortalitie, although it were confuſed, and iudging

it naturall, and knowyng that naturall deſires be not vain, nor of things that can not be hadde, they haue bene reduced to God, and haue confeſſed their erroure, and ſo recommended them ſelues to God, as he hath giuen them the lyghte of Fayth, whereby they haue dyed Chriſtian men. But lette vs leaue thys reaſonyng, and goe lyghte thy candle, bycauſe it ſhal be tyme by and by that thou go to thy worke.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  Thou haſte a thouſande reaſons, and I ſtayde to reaſon wyth thée. What ayleth thys tynder that it wyll not take? nowe thankes bée to GOD, it is lyght. Oh, oh, good Lorde, What a goodly thyng? what a goodly Creature? Oh my Soule, bleſſed bée thou, for thou art a faire thyng.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  Sitte, ſytte Iuſt, leaſt thou fall, for thou art olde.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  I can not holde my ſelfe, but

I muſte néedes embrace thée, wyllyng thée ſo, well, and neuer hauyng ſeene thee before. But alas, what is the matter, I féele nothyng, yet I ſée thée: Am I not well in my wyttes?
               
               
                  Soule.
                  Iuſt, thou makeſt profeſſion of a Dautiſt, and thou doeſt not remember it, when thou ſhouldeſt. Doeſt not thou remember, that the lyke alſo happened vnto Daut hymſelfe, when that he woulde haue embraced Caſella: And the cauſe is this, that we be as ſhadowes, and do only ſhewe oure ſelues to the ſighte, but wée can not bée proprely touched, bycauſe that we be withoute bodyes: And this body which I haue made me, being of the aire, is alſo vntouchable.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  Then you be (as a man might ſay) a thyng of nothing.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  Yea, folowing the opinion of the common people, whiche call that

nothyng, that is not compounded of earthe, water of fire, makyng no accompt of aire. I thinke if in this chā
                     ber there were not theſe cheſtes, thys bed and other thyngs, thou wouldeſt ſay it were emptie, if thou wouldeſt ſay truthe.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  Should I not ſay it wer emptie, when nothing is in it?
               
               
                  Soule.
                  Yes ſurely, but there ſhoulde be ſomewhat in it.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  What ſhould there be, when there is nothyng? I feare me, thou woldeſt make me beleue glaſſe wormes to be lanternes.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  The aire ſhould be there.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  What? aire or no aire, when a tubbe is emptie, I knowe there is nothing in it, and I ſée it euery day.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  And what veſſels be they that thou euer haſt ſéene emptie?
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  Mary all thoſe in my ſhop.
               
               
                  Soul.
                  Ah foole, be they not ful of aire?
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  No: for if thou lookeſt well, there is darkeneſſe, and where aire

is, there is light.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  Then the nyghte when it is darke, is none aire. This is as ye ſpeake of yong babes, whiche you ſay haue no ſoules, vntill they be baptized, which if it were true, it ſhoulde folow, that neither Turke nor Iewe had ſoule: but let vs leaue this. Thou art little practiſed and followeſt the ignorant: but that thou ſhouldeſt not remain in this thy falſe opinion, thou oughteſt to vnderſtand; that the ayre hath a body, as well as the water, or the earth, but it is a little more fyne, &amp; is darke of it ſelf, yf it be not lightned of the Sunnebeames, or of ſome other lighte. And further, thou muſt vnderſtande, that no emptye called Vacuum, can be in Nature, that is to ſay, that in this vniuerſall worlde, there is no place, but is full of ſome bodye. And of this thou mayſt make a thouſande experiences euery daye, but I will teach thée but one, and that is, with that veſſell wherewith thou

watreſt thy gardin: for ſtopping the the hole aboue, the water commes not out of the holes beneath: and that cometh of none other cauſe, but that the hole aboue; beyng ſtopped, the aire can not enter in, whereby if the water ſhoulde goe oute, that place ſhoulde remayne voyde, the whyche bycauſe Nature can not abyde; ſhe makes the water remayne, contrarie to hir nature in that place.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  And who knowes that that is the cauſe?
               
               
                  Soule.
                  Who knowes? euery man that hath witte.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  I will tell thée the truth, theſe be certaine things that I can not ſkil of, and I think they be toyes to make a man madde. I doe knowe that a veſſelle that hathe nothyng in it, is voyde: and I can neuer beléeue otherwyſe, I hope that thou wylte not vſe me, as Mathewe Serui was, who was made to beleue that he was an other man than he tooke him ſelfe, and

that he was a Carpenter, and made Tergates, whereby he entred into ſuch a conceipte, that when he came to houſes where he vſed to goe, and ſawe olde Tergats hang there, hée beganne to ſaye, that he knewe of them that were made of hys owne hande.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  Then ſée howe harde it is, when one is farre brought to vnderſtande a thyng euill, to ſette hym in the ryght way.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  What wouldeſt thou ſay, that when I woulde euen nowe haue embraced thée, and founde nothyng that I did imbrace ſomewhat? ah.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  Dyddeſt thou not imbrace the aire?
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  What ayre? I knowe I imbraced nothyng: within a while thou wouldeſt make me beleue, that when my ſtomacke is emptie, it were full, the whiche yf I woulde beléeue, I ſhoulde dye for hunger. God kéepe mée.
               
               
                  
                  Soule.
                  I ſaye vnto thée, that yf wée ſhould graunt voideneſſe, a thouſand inconueniences ſhoulde folow, as for example: If betwene thée &amp; me were nothing, thou couldeſt not ſée me.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  Oh God, ſée howe this geare groweth. For out of doubt it is contrary:Nullum vacuum. for if there were any body betwene thée and me, then coulde I not ſee thée.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  It is true, if it were ſuch a body, that thy ſyght or imagination coulde not paſſe, thou couldeſt not ſée me, but that ſhould riſe of an other occaſion, than a voide place betwéene thée and me.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  Tell me howe this thyng is meant, for I vnderſtand it not.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  If betwéene vs were emptineſſe, &amp; none aire, thē ſhold ther be no light. Wherfore the beames of thine eyes coulde not come to thée, nor my image come to thine eyes. For light is a qualitie, and qualitie is an accident, and no accident can ſtand without

a ſubiect that rules it: then if here were none aire that did ſtay the light here coulde be none.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  As for me, I vnderſtand not what thou meaneſt.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  Heare then, if thou canſt vnderſtande me an other waye: when thou ſtandeſt by the fyre, what is it that heateth thée?
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  The fire: Who knoweth not that? this is a childiſhe thing.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  But that is not true.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  Oh what heates me, the wind? Thy matters be childrens toyes, if I would beleue them.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  The aire heateth thée which toucheth thée, whiche is heated of the fire, for the fire not touching thée, can not heate thée, for no body can worke in an other vnleſſe he touche it.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  What meaneſt thou by that?
               
               
                  Soule.
                  I meane that if there were any emptie place betwene thée and the fire, thou ſhouldeſt neuer be heated: For that heate whiche is an accident,

hauyng nothyng to holde it, coulde not come vnto thée, but béeyng ſtayde by the ayre, whiche commeth to thée, that ayre that toucheth thée, being hotte, doth heate thée alſo.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  Wel, I wyl tel thée the truth. Thou myghteſt tell me thys tale an hundred yeare, and I beleue, I ſhould neuer vnderſtande thée any thyng to thys purpoſe, and neuer beléeue thée.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  I ſée thys mornyng thou art not apt to receyue the truthe: therefore I wyll not talke of any other thyng, and it is tyme thou goeſt to thy worke: To morowe at the accuſtomed houre I will goe from thée, and take this bodye and reaſon wyth thée, and thou ſhalte be better dyſpoſed to vnderſtande mée, than thou art nowe.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  If wée tarrie vntill to morowe, thou ſhalte peraduenture bée better in thy brayne: and tell me no thyngs that no man vnderſtands.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  But ſée thys nyght thou kepeſt

thy candle lyght: for I wyll not thou ſpende ſo muche tyme aboute it to morowe.

                  I am halfe mynded to be angry with thée.

                  For ſlepe I care not, yet it greueth me thou haſte waked me, for I haue dreamed the moſt ſwete and pleſant things that euer I ſaw.

                  I can not ſo welle tell thée: for they were not as I am wont to

dreame things that haue neither hed nor taile, and begin with one thing, &amp; ends with an other. But me thought I was in a quietneſſe, and without any trouble, remēbring the reſons we haue had together, and I will tel thée one thing, that I haue vnderſtanded ſleping, that I coulde not doe yeſterday wakyng: of that Vacuū, or emptieNullum vacuum. place, which yeſterday would not enter, and I remembre I haue pierced a full barel, and neuer could cauſe wine to come out, if I did not firſt open a vente: and I neuer conſidered that it came of that thou dioſt ſpeake. And I will tell thée more, that nowe I know, how a ſwimmer a companion of mine was one day deceiued, of one of out citizens that wan certaine fiſhes of him, whiche of them ſhoulde ſtande longeſt vnder the water: and heare how he did. He deſired to holde on his heade one of theſe pottes with two eares, ſaying he did ſo, bicauſe the water did hurte his head: and he that

vnderſtode not the deceit, did graunt it him: My friende ſet it on his heade downewarde, and occupied the tyme that the aire that was within, did not go out, and ſo no more water did enter than doth in a cuppe that is rineed downeward, in ſuch ſort as he might ſtande as long as he woulde, hauyng no water aboute his mouthe. Thou ſéeſt what I haue vnderſtanded by dreaming.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  And whereof thynkeſt thou commeth this dreame, ſince thou calleſt it a dreame?

For whiles thou wert dreaming, finding my ſelf frée, I dyd retire into my ſelf, and with my part diuine (for ſo may I call it, hauing it of God) I did work in thy partes apt to vnderſtande, and to learne thoſe intellections and conceipts, which thou confeſſeſt thou neuer hadſt before: wherby thou mayſt eaſily perſuade thy ſelf (that although I am vnited to thée in ſuche ſort, as it ſemeth I cannot be without thée) that I am immortal, and can wel be without thée, ſeing I can do ſome operatiō without thée, as thou haſt perceiued.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  I will tell thée the truth, thou doeſt perſuade ſo wel, that thou ſayſt that I can not but beleue thée, bicauſe I thinke, that thou being my part (I meane when I am perfect Iuſt) that thou oughteſt not to deceiue me. But now I am ready, and I will ſette me downe, as thou baddeſt me, and aſke

thée certayne queſtions more quietly than I haue done.

                  Say what thou wilt▪ for I wil ſatiſfy thy deſire in all thyngs that I can.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  The firſt thing I would knowe of thée, is: Why thou ſhouldeſt lament of me, for the firſt time that I hard thée ſpeake in my head, as I remēber, thou ſaydſt, thou neuer hadſt reſt in me, being yong, and leſſe couldſt hope to haue any now when I am olde.

                  Iuſt, neuer repeate that, for if I did lament of thée, I had good cauſe.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  I do not remember that euer I did any thyng againſt Iuſt, for then I had done it againſt my ſelfe, and then haue I done nothing againſt thée, ſéeing thou ſayſt that thou and I, be Iuſt.

                  It is ſo, but thou haſte not done as I would.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  How can that be? for I neuer knew till nowe, that any other was in my ſelfe, but I: but if thou loueſt me as thou ſayſt, I pray thée thou wouldſt tel

                  Yes, and I haue heard it preached many times.

                  All this that thou haſt ſaide, is well: but wherin haue I hindred thée, or euer anoyed thée, that thou canſt cō

                  I wil not ſpeake Iuſt, of thoſe impediments common, that riſe of thée &amp; thy proper nature, weake, and enclined to loue &amp; ſeke only earthly things, but I wil onely lament of thée in this, that thou haſt euer held me occupied in ſo vile exerciſe as thy craft of Couperage is: what griefe thinkeſt thou Iuſt hath it ben to me, that I being ſo noble a creature, haue euer ben forced to miniſter to thée all my knowledge and power, that thou ſholdeſt make barels, pitchers, bowes for babes, and patens with ſuch other like, and that onely for thy buſineſſe I muſt leaue the contemplation of the beauty of this vniuerſal, &amp; hold mine eyes down vpon a thing

                  I wil not take away manuell craftes, for I knowe well howe many things man hath néede of, and thy ſelfe particularly, without the which thou ſholdſt fal into a thouſand infirmities, &amp; a thouſand anoyances, which ſhold let me ſo, as I ſhold leſſe giue my ſelf to cō

complexioned, &amp; indued with very good inſtruments, wherewith the ſenſes be exerciſed, as well interior, as exterior, and made liuely wyth a blood ſo good; that engendereth ſo cléere and ſubtill ſpirits apt to do any operation perfectly: of thée, thus I ſay, that thou were apt to do any noble exerciſe, aſwel contemplatiue as actiue, and yet haſt thou alwais kept me in making of ſlippers: what ſayſt thou nowe, haue I cauſe to lament or no?

                  I will ſaay more vnto thée, it were more eaſy for Iuſt to vnderſtande

                  Nowe thou ſpeakeſt of a great matter.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  I ſpeake as it is, and heare the reaſon. What pleaſure haſt thou in making a paire of patens, or a veſſell, or ſuch like?
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  I haue pleaſure, bicauſe I ſée I gaine therby, and ſo prouide for my neede that riſeth euery day.

                  Let vs leaue gaine, for that alſo cometh of ſtudy, but what other pleaſure haſt thou?

                  And I leſſe, rather I haue an extreame paſſion, knowing (as I haue told thée) and finding my ſelfe occupied in ſuch things vile.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  Then what is the cauſe? ſéeing it is (as I ſee) that ſo fewe men be giuen to ſtudy, and chiefly of them that might, and wante not the way to doe it.

                  Of their euill bringing vp &amp;Euil bringing vp, hinderance to learning. gouernement of their fathers, and of their euil way of life, which is now in the world, and alſo in the feare whych they make that be counted lerned, ſhewing that ſtudy is the hardeſt thyng that a man can doe.

                  Thou ſayſt truth, for I haue hapt many times to heare them ſay ſo, &amp; they play as phiſitians, which alwais makes the diſeaſes of their parents to be greuous and daungerous, to ſhewe; that if they recouer them, they haue done a great cure.

                  Ah Iuſt, would God that this occaſion only moued them to do ſo, but they be moued of an other worſe principle.

                  I muſt haue more time, and now it is broade day, to morow if thou will reaſon as thou haſt done this mornyng, I will tell thée, that and other things.

                  So will I doe.

               Haue ſlepte euill thys nyght, God I what would it meane? yet I fynde no euill at all. Some other wil ſay; that theſe be the things which the infirmitie that all men couereth, I meane Age, bringeth, to ſlepe euill, and watche worſe: but it ſhal be better for mée, ſince I am entred into this Fanſie, to talke with my Soule, with whome I haue had ſuche pleaſure theſe thrée rymes that wee haue talked together, that euery houre ſeemeth a thouſande yeare to renue the

ſame: yet may it be a Dreame, wherof I ſtand halfe in doubt: for I neuer heard that any ſuch thing hath chaunced to any other before this time: and thoughe it ſéemeth that Dauid in hys Pſalmes ſometime talketh with hir, as in the begynning of the Seruice, where he aſketh hir why ſhe is ſo melancolie and troubled, yet could I neuer learne that ſhe made hym any anſwere as myne dothe me: ſo as myne may well be a dreame: yet I can not beleue it: for I knowe many thyngs which I did not before. But now that I am ſure I ſléepe not, nor dreame not, I wyll ſée, yf ſhée wyll reaſon wyth me, as ſhe hathe done, and call hir as ſhe appoynted yeſterday in the mornyng I ſhoulde doe. My ſoule, O my ſoule.

                  What wouldeſt thou Iuſt?

                  Sée it is trewe, that I dydde not dreame. I woulde wée ſhoulde talke a whyle together, as we haue

done, and that thou wouldeſt contente me, in that thou dydſt begyn to ſpeake of yeſterdaye in the mornyng: But ſée, I wyll not that thou go out of mée any more, as thou haſt done theſe two mornyngs: For I paſſe not now to ſée thée: and I know I haue bene in greate peryll, and alſo playde the very foole to put my ſelfe in ſuche hazarde, wherevpon my lyfe laye.

                  As thou ſayeſt, thou haddeſt a greatte wylle that I ſhoulde ſtudye, wherefore when thou haddeſt bene from me, and mynded to returne no more to mae, but for to enter into the bodye of ſome Studente, then ſhoulde I haue bene a body withoute a Soule: and yf not as dead, yet at leaſt one of the baſe beaſtes.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  Doubt it not Iuſt, thou art in no ſuche daunger: for if thou remembreſt

wel, I tolde thée I dyd not in all ſeparate my ſelfe from thée, but only with my part diuine, y• which is ſuche, as being immortall may be withoute thee.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  Very well, and bycauſe ſhe may be without me, therfore I feare, bycauſe I would not become a beaſt, I ſay, and ſée one other with my brain and with his, ſell me by and by, and then other, euery day ten times.

                  Although I can be withoute thée, which ſhall be after that ſeparation that death ſhall make of vs, neuertheleſſe I can not informe any other body but thée, til the day of iudgement.

                  Wherfore?

                  Bycauſe of that perpetuall qualitie that I muſt informe thée, and none other.

                  What is that qualitie thou ſpeakeſt of?
               
               
                  Soule.
                  It is a certaine conuenience and inclination that I haue to worke

by thée, to begyn to taſte my perfection, which was not gyuen me of God at my creation, as to angels, which if I had, I ſhoulde haue no nede of thée. And this is the onely thyng that maketh me differ from other ſoules, bycauſe, we being not different in kind, as of y• other beaſts, foraſmuch as we be reaſonable, &amp; they not, nor can not be different in number, bicauſe we be not materiall, it ſhoulde folowe, that we were all one thing: and this conſideration hath brought many greate men into greateſt errours: but one of vs is different from an other, by that qualitie &amp; reſpecte, that ſhe hath with hir body, and not with other.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  I will be playne with thée: I vnderſtande not this matter.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  Maruel not, for Duns (whom they call the ſubtill Doctour, who thought he vnderſtode it better than other, gyuing it the name, Eccheita, a name altogether ſtrange to the barbarous eares, muche more to the Latines,

did not vnderſtande it perfectly him ſelfe.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  Then let it goe: for I woulde not that we ſhoulde enter into theſe toyes, and then happe to me as dyd to hym, that going aboute to blynde other mens braynes, dydde ſo blinde hym ſelfe, as he was buried quicke. Whiche thyng myghte well happen to me, if I were founde once wythout thee: therefore tarrie wyth me, as thou haſte done, for I wyll no more abide the perill, and I care not nowe to ſée thée.

                  I ſée thou haſte ſuch feare of our ſeparation, that it is full tyme I deliuer thée of it. Vnderſtand, that although I haue tolde thee, I goe out of thée, yet I neuer dyd, nor can doe it, but by death, and that is bicauſe I am thy forme, &amp; am not in thée, as a mariner in a ſhip, as many haue beleued.

                  Which way?
               
               
                  Soule.
                  I wil tell thée, I moued from thoſe viſions and images, which thou haſt in fantaſy, and repreſented them to thy vertue imaginatiue, as I doe when thou dreameſt, and ſo it ſemeth thou dyddeſt ſee me.

                  I can, and in this ſort ſpirits deceiue mē many times, and therfore their apparitiōs be called fantaſtical.

                  What is it true there be ſpirites in déede?

                  Iuſt.
                  I can not tel, I haue heard ſay of many learned men, that they bée things fained, &amp; things that appeare only to certain ſimple mē, &amp; that they come ſomtime of melācoly humors, y• bréede by hearing of ſtrange things.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  They be of thoſe lerned men

that think they vnderſtand all things and ſhewe, they haue redde little in Stories, or in Scripture, and litle to beleue in the ſame, which is worſe. I tell thée that ſpirites be, and beſides this, make them that beleue them, to ſeme they be ſometyme an other thing: haſt thou not hearde that they that be witches, think they be Cats?

                  Would God they were not true, which he ſuffreth for our ſinnes. Reade what the Count of Mirandula, writeth of one that he had in his hāds. And the Canoniſts wold haue forſene that it had not ben true, whiche haue made a particular law of the witched and enchaunted.

                  Surely that is a greate argument, but let it go. Thou haſt taken a great waight from my heart, ſaying thou wylt not go from me. But now let vs turne to our talke yeſterday in the morning, tell me, whereof comes it, that theſe Doctors do

                  Thou knoweſt Iuſt, that the leaſt part of men be good, but whether this commeth, either of the infirmitie of the fleſhe, or of euill cuſtome, or of little religion, I will not nowe diſpute.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  Thou ſayſt truth, ther be more bad than good, and do ſo increaſe, that I feare we are nygh the ende of the worlde. Thou ſéeſt how we haue growen worſe &amp; worſe theſe fiftie yeres. I wil not reaſon of Popes, CardinalsPopes. &amp;c. Worſe and worſe. and Prieſts, and leſſe of Friers, that thou ſholdeſt not by and by proclaime me a Luterane. But conſider children of ten yeares olde, how they be without reuerence, without ſhame, bolde, diſhoneſt, and mocke a man of fiftie yeres. Alas, I remember that in my time, we paſſed twentie yeres, before we knewe what Venus, or Bacchus was: and nowe ſo ſoone as they bée

borne, the one is gyuen them for a nurſe, &amp; the other for a maſter.

                  Ye may thank their good education and the ſmall wiſedom of their fathers, which think it a propre thing that a little childe can ſpeake an vnhoneſt worde, or taſte well of wine, and doe not marke the euill to come, whyche they gette thereby, in teachyng them ſuche thyngs: but lette them alone, for they will repente it after when they be older, but lette vs returne to oure talke. Thou muſte knowe, that the goodneſſe of men, (I ſpeake not onely of it that is required of hym that wyll lyue lyke a Chriſtian, but of that that is conuenient for man) commeth of loue, the whiche dothe bryng a deſire and gladneſſe of an others weale.
               
               
                  Iuſt
                  Thou ſayeſt well, and truely yf men dyd loue one an other, wée ſhoulde néede no lawe at all, for then there ſhould be no murder, no thefte, no vſurie, no robbyng
                        •

                  Soule.
                  So alſo euilneſſe groweth of a contrary to loue, whiche bredeth enuie, and ſadneſſe for others weale, and therefore yf thou conſydereſt well, thou ſhalte fynde, that all maligning men be enuious.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  Not only they be enuious, but alſo fooliſhe.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  Bicauſe fooliſhneſſe is alſo an imperfection of man, and not being ruled with a good minde, produceth infinite euill effects, and bicauſe fooles cannot purchaſe that riches and thoſe honoures that they woulde by the meane of theyr ſufficiencie and vertue, they ſéeke to procure it by a thouſande wayes vniuſt and vnlaufull, ſo as they thinke they can doe it cloſely, and care not for the ruine of other, a thyng ſo wycked, that euen the brute beaſtes doe abhorre, which, when they wil nedes do euyll

onely with force, where as men ſhewing them ſelues friends, maliciouſly and with a thouſand fraudes do deceiue one an other euery day.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  Oh my ſoule, thou ſpeakeſt wiſely and truely, and he that wyll ſée this thing wel, let him loke among vs artificers, and he ſhall finde that all the malicious &amp; fooliſh be enuious.

                  And ſo it happeth among the learned, where, as well the fooliſhe as the euill, doe nothing els, but plucke men from ſtudie, the fooliſh to be eſtemed, which they ſhoulde not, if theyr fooliſhneſſe were knowne, coueryng it onely with reproche, but doing nothing. The malicious, bycauſe an other ſhoulde not ioy that good and that honour, that they thinke they haue.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  What way hold they?

Doeſt thou not ſee that there haue bene of theſe learned men, that hauing no regard at al, I wil not ſay of the law of god, which they ought to eſteme aboue al things, but of them ſelues and of the worlde, to appeare learned, haue written a thouſand workes in the hurte and offence of other men. I wil not ſpeake of them that beare the ſigne in theyr forheade of that they be, as the Cortigian, and the Dialogue of Vſurie, although the one be ſufficiēt to corrupt the honeſtie of the Romane. Lucrece,

As in our dayes that Image of God M. Iulian Caruine, (for ſo wyll I call hym, bycauſe that ſo wyllyngly, after the

ſimilitude of hym, he doth communicate his good thyngs) did to Camerino, the Carpenter, whome he hath made ſo experte in that facultie, as he peraduenture is not ſeconde to anie other that in Latine, or Greeke, (of the whiche he hathe no knoweledge) haue ſtudied in the like Science: and ſo ſhoulde exhorte an Apothecarie to ſtudy Phyſicke: and to be ſhorte, euery man to ſeeke to obtayne thoſe thyngs, whyche they thynke maye be in any thing profitable or honourable to them.

And maiſter Marcello likewiſe, which was my neighboure, and a man not onely good, but goodneſſe it ſelfe, to euery childe that had aſked him his opinion of any matter, he woulde haue anſwered all that he knewe: ſo deſirous was he to communicate his vertue, alleaging oft that ſaying of Plato, that one man was borne to healpe an other.

                  This I beleue well, for I haue ſéene in my dayes many learned men fooles, which haue not ben worth two handful of nuttes, and yet haue ſtudied inough: and I remember amongſt other one Michell Marullo, which was one of thoſe Grecians that fledde from the loſſe of Conſtantinople, &amp; was very well learned, as men ſayde, and yet he was a fonde fooliſh man, wherfore one day one Bino Corrierie his companion ſaid thus merily to him. M. Michell, men ſay you are very ſkilful in grammer, and in gréeke, it may wel be, for I vnderſtande nothing that way, but in vulgare, me think you are a very foole.

                     o only for enuy, and wilt thou ſée it? now that they ſée that

Latin letters be made ſomewhat more vulgare than they were wont, they begin to ſay, that he that knoweth not Gréeke, knowes nothing, as if the ſpirites of Ariſtotle and of Plato (as that honeſt Cortigian ſayd) were ſhut in an alphabet of Gréeke, as in a glaſſe, and a man learning it, might drinke at one draught as he doth a ſirupe.

                  That is not ſo, but rather ſéemeth ſo pleaſant vnto him, as he wold robbe it, and though it be proper Florentine, as Boccace ſaith, to haue a part in it, he would make it Italian or Cortigian,

tongue, for all may ſée many times that of the corruption of one thing, riſeth the generation of a better thing, as in the generation of man: and what wilte thou ſay to him that ſayeth, that this conſonance that is in our tongue, is lyke the harmonie or muſycke of drummes, or rather of harquebuſſhes or

                  No, for as thy Dante ſayth, he ſhould be no leſſe a foole to anſwere him that would aſke if there were fire in the houſe, where the flame wente out at the window, than he that aſketh the queſtion. And beſide, Triſsine doth anſwere ſufficiently to this in his boke which he made of Poetrie, where he ſheweth what maruellous Art is foūd in our verſes.

                  Iuſt.
                  In this thou makeſt me maruel much, for I would haue beleued, that men doe better that thing which they do oft, and that is to ſpeake in proſe, &amp; not in verſe: but what is the occaſion of it?

                  I wil tel thée, and note it wel. The beauty and grace of the tongue, procedeth not only of the words, but in the knitting &amp; placing them together: and he that will ſée, as in a glaſſe, what this ſecond parte well vſed can doe, let

him conferre with the writings of the Florentines, &amp; with other writings that be not Tuſcanes, and he ſhall finde (if he hath eares) the ſwéetneſſe that vniuerſally is in the clauſes of this, &amp; the hardneſſe that is in other: sand this order &amp; facilitie can not be obſerued &amp; kepte in verſes, bicauſe of the meaſure, the ſoūd and the rime, and yet it ſéemeth to men agreing in certayne particuler lawes, they can more equally méete in a way of compoſition, &amp; ſo better make verſe than proſe.

                  Of this I can gyue no iudgement, although I haue read Dant, but this I can ſay, that I haue ſtraight knowne a man by his pronunciation whither he be a Florētine or no, though he forceth him ſelfe to ſpeake neuer ſo well.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  No doubt of that, and be certaine of this alſo, that if thou markeſt well, thou ſhalt knowe whither one be borne, or brought vp in Florence city or in the countrey, for they haue cōmonly

a certayn rude pronunciation, &amp; can not leaue it without ſome difficultie.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  That I thinke makes no matter, for he that is of the cuntrey, is called and ſpeaketh Florentine.
                  
               
               
                  Soule.
                  Maketh it no matter? rather is ther great difference, if it be not holpen by good vſe.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  What is it thou ſaiſt? was not Boccace of Certaldo, and yet one of the moſt famous Florentine writers?
               
               
                  Soule.
                  His aunceſters were whereof his houſe alwaies kepte the name, but not he: &amp; if thou beleueſt me not, reade the booke which he made of Flouds, where ſpeaking of Elſa, he ſaith it is at the foote of Certaldo, ſometime the cuntrey of his aunceſters, before that Florence did recouer them for Citizens.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  Then the tongue of which is made ſo great accompte, is Florentine proper.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  Who doubteth therof? doth not Lodouico Martello proue it wel in his aunſwere, which he made to Triſſinc?
                     
And know that who is not borne &amp; brought vp in Florence, do not learne it perfectly: and of this it commeth that many diſpayring to ſpeake or write it well, haue entred to ſpeake euil and to reproue it, and I thinke it hath hapned to them, as did to a great maſter of our time touching the poet Dante.
                  
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  What was that?
               
               
                  Soule.
                  I wil tel thée. He coueting to be compted chiefe in our tong, and beleuing he iuſted as well as our Petrarke, he prayſeth him maruelouſly, ſo thinking to praiſe himſelfe, but perceiuing after. (as he is very witty) that he can not come nigh to Dante by no way, being driuen by Enuie, he did what he could to diſprayſe him.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  Then he did, as they ſay, ſhe Counte of Mirandola and Fryer Ierome did, the one of the which, fyndyng by Aſtronomy he ſhoulde die a younge man, and the other by the handes of Iuſtice, they began to beleue it was not true, and ſo both ſpake

and wrote euill of it, but marke, for I remember, he blameth that only in the tongue, the which neyther he nor none of ye other wold haue done, if they had conſidered in what termes he found it in his time, &amp; that he, taking the myre from it, gaue more helpe vnto it, than peraduenture Petrarke did, bringing it to ſuch a perfection.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  That ſhould be well alſo to cōſider in ſciences, ſaying, that he only to ſhew him ſelfe a maſter, in them had made ſuch Poetry, as might be reſembled to a great fielde full of many wilde herbs, &amp; a thouſand other things more immodeſt and vnhoneſt, that I maruel, that though it were true, he would not holde his peace, for the reuerence of ſo great a clerke.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  If he were not a great maſter as thou ſayeſt, and ſo ſhould ſpeake of Dante, I would ſay he were preſumptuous.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  Say it boldly, ſéeing he ſpeaketh it wythout reſpecte of Daut, to

whome he is more inferiour than art thou to him, if we will not now meaſure the perfection of man, by the fauour of Fortune, as many do now a dayes: but let him alone, for he hath nowe the pen in hande, that ſhewing the greatneſſe and the beautie of this Poet, ſhal diſcouer eyther the raſheneſſe, the fooliſhneſſe, or the enuie of hym.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  And he ſhall doe very well, for he that is enuious, deſerueth none other but to be chaſed and fled of euery man, euen as a wylde beaſt.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  Thou ſpeakeſt like a Philoſopher Iuſt, for enuie is it that more hurteth the ſocietie of man, than any other thing, and the worſe effectes it bryngeth forth, as it is in men more wyttie and learned: But nowe the Sunne is high, I will that thou riſe, and goe to thy worke, and an other time we will reaſon of this more at the full.
               
            
            
               
               
                  The .v. Reaſoning. IVST. SOVLE.
               IS this the bell at S. Croſſe? it is ſo. O it is to long afore day to riſe:
               Theſe Graye Friers haue this cuſtome to ryng to Matens about mydnyghte, when a man is in hys beſte ſléepe: although to them, that goe to rouſt as hennes do, it is ſmall griefe, &amp; yet vniuerſally it makes a demonſtration of no ſmall diſeaſe, it ſhall be wel to ſlepe agayn a while, although the tyme that is ſlepte is as loſt, yea, is litle leſſe than as a man were dead, therefore it ſhall be better to ryſe. But what ſhall I doe then? it is ſo long tyll Sunne ryſe, that I ſhall be weary: But I may proue if my ſoule wyll talke with me, althoughe I begynne to doubt, if I followe on, ſhée wyll make me a foole: and it is not to

be laughed at: for all they that waxe madde, be madde in ſoule and body: and ſo ſhall thys myne make mée, if I doe beleeue hir too muche. Beholde, ſhée hath begonne to tell mée, that a man may be wiſe, and learned, without knowledge of y• Latin or Greeke tongue: whiche is a thyng, that yf I ſhoulde ſpeake among the learned of oure dayes, I ſhoulde be wondred at, as an Owle: As for mée, I neuer heard a man could be wiſe in vulgar, but a foole well inough: and I neuer ſawe man, of whome any greate accompte was made, yf hée knowe not ſome parte of Grammer, ſo as I wyll not thus beleue it. And peraduenture I haue not vnderſtanded hir wel, and therefore it ſhall be well to ſée, yf ſhe wil reſon with me a while: and I wil aſke hir the queſtion. My ſoule, Oh my deare Soule, ſhall we talke a little thys mornyng?
               
                  Soule.
                  Yea, I pray thée Iuſt, and I haue no greatter pleaſure than that:

for whiles I ſtande gathered into my ſelfe to talke with thée, I am not occupied in thoſe vile and baſe conceits, which thou haſt the more part of time nor néede not miniſter to thy ſenſes and ſtrength in making thy pattens and barelles.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  I do not maruell thereat, for I my ſelfe doe labour very vnwillyngly, and nothing is more grieuous vnto mee: and were it not that curſed force doth cauſe me, I woulde neuer worke ſtroke.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  What wouldeſt thou do, liue and be always in Idleneſſe?
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  No, but I woulde beſtow the time in ſome thing that ſhold delight me, where as to worke is paine and trouble to me.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  Then think what it is to me being much more contrary to my nature than to thine.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  I knowe not that: I ſée that God, after man had ſinned, mynding to giue him part of penance, as he had

done the woman in trauailyng with paine, ſayd vnto him: Thou ſhalt eate thy bread in the ſweate of thy face▪ giuing him labor, for y• greuouſeſt and troubleſome thing he could giue him.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  Ah, ah, ſée, ſée, howe by litle &amp; litle thou commeſt to mine opinion: Thou didſt maruell when I ſayd vnto thée the laſt day, that it was more paine to a man to make a paire of patens, than to ſtudy halfe Ariſtotle: the reaſon thy ſelfe haſte ſhewed: for to ſtudie, is naturall and propre to mā, and leades him to his perfection: and to labour, is a penance.
               
               
                  Iuſt
                  Yea mā muſt haue alſo to liue.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  That is true: But all is to be content of that which is neceſſary, and not to ſéeke ſuperfluitie, whiche bringeth a thouſande vnprofitable cares to man, and kepes hym alwayes occupied in the earthe, and neuer lets hym hold vp his head to heauen, from whence his ſoule came firſt, and whether ſhe deſireth to returne: &amp; know

Iuſt, that the greateſt good and profitable thyng to man in this life, is to acquainte hym ſelfe with thyngs as they come, and content him ſelf with a litle: for he that ſo doth, liueth with ſmall care, and is mery the moſt part of his time, if not all.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  I beléeue it certainely: for I proued it in my ſelfe, howe profitable it hath ben to me, to content me with that I haue, meaſuring my will with my fortune, and if I woulde haue lyued or clothed me better, I muſt néedes haue done ſome vnhoneſt thyng, or gone and dwelt with other.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  It were euyll for great men Iuſt, if all men were of that wil: for they then muſt ſerue them ſelues: bycauſe it is nothyng but immoderate deſire, eyther of dignitie, or of diete to eate and drinke delicately, or to be clad ſumptuouſly, that cauſeth that a mā which reaſonably might liue thrée ſcore yeares (in ten or twelue of the which, he knoweth not what he doth,

and of the reſt hée ſléepeth the halfe) ſelleth thoſe fewe that he lyueth, lyuyng in ſeruitude, for a little price: Whiche thing that wiſe Philoſopher Diogenes woulde not doe, to whome Alexander the greate, ſayde: That he ſhoulde aſke what he woulde, and it ſhoulde bée gyuen hym. Hée aunſwered: Thoughe he were poore, he lacked nothing, but required hym to ſtand aſide, bicauſe he toke the Sunne from him, that was not in his power to gyue hym.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  Certainly to depend of himſelf is a goodly thing, and to be a friend to lordes, but not a ſlaue, honoryng and obeying them neuertheleſſe, as them that holde in earth the place of God: and when a man wyll aduaunce hymſelfe, he oughte to doe it with Vertue, and not with ſeruice, thynking neuertheleſſe, that in euery ſtate he ſhall lacke ſomewhat.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  Then cōplain not of thine, &amp; know certēly, ther is no ſtate in this

worlde, but hath some diſcommoditie and ſome thing that diſpleaſeth, and none can be found as thou haſte ſayd, but that lacketh ſomewhat.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  Wyth this reaſon woulde I once proue vnto a friend of mine that all the ſtates of men, were alike, and I told him that euery one lacked ſomwhat, which chiefly he deſired: as for example: The lame deſireth to bée ſounde, that he might get his liuyng and not go a begging. He that is hole and hath nothyng, to haue ſomewhat to lyue, that hée needeth not labour: and he that hath to liue ſufficiently, to gette ſo muche as he myght kepe an horſe and a boy: and he that hath that, to get a dignitie, or a gretneſſe aboue other, and then to be a Prince, and being a prince, neuer to die.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  Then do not thou lamente though thou laboureſt a litle, ſeing euery man lackes ſomewhat.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  To labour a little were a pleſure, but always, as I do that haue litle

or nothing, is a deſpight.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  Marke, thou doeſt as other do: but tell me, what wouldeſt thou haue, what wanteſt thou?
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  Swéete Ducates of reuenue, and then I ſhould liue well.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  And when thou haddeſt that, thou ſhouldeſt then lacke ſomewhat, and deſire it, as thou doſt this, bicauſe as thou haſt ſayde of thy ſelfe, in euery ſtate ther lacketh ſome thing, thinking when thou haſt it, thou woldeſt be content, and yet when thou haſte it, thou arte not content, but begynneſt to deſire an other: So as once a Citizen of oures ſayde wiſely, to one that was entred into greate diſorder, to bie a piece of grounde that lay next him: Thou muſte thinke, thou muſte haue neighbours, and when thou haſt bought this, thou ſhalt haue an other neighbour, of whome thou wilt haue the like deſire.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  I beleue certainly, that there is care in euery ſtate but more in one

than in an other.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  And is not thine one of them that ſo hath, and of the greater?
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  It is, ſeyng I muſt onely liue by my worke, which (as I ſayd afore) was put to man for penaunce of hys ſynnes.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  Yea, to them yt haue their willes diſordinate, &amp; be not contēt with yt is conueniēt to their ſtate, as Adā
                      had when this hapned to hym. But to him that directeth paciētly his way in this life to that he is called, it chaunceth not ſo. What ſwéeter thyng can be, than to liue with the trauel of his hā
                     des? So that Dauid y• Prophet, which was alſo a King, as thou knoweſt, did call ſuch like, bleſſed. And know this for a cōcluſion, the more a man hath, the more care he muſt take: and it is greater and paynfuller penſiueneſſe, to rule ſuperfluous things to him, thā is the ſweteneſſe to poſſeſſe them, and the more ſeruantes and labourers he hath, the more enimies he hathe, as

that philoſopher ſayde well. But let vs leaue theſe matters, in the whiche me thinke we haue ſayde inough: let vs turne a litle to them of yeſterday, which we left vnperfect, bicauſe thou doubtedſt before, yt if thou beleuedſt me, I ſhould make thée a fole, as though yu hadſt not thy part as well as other.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  Take this too, if it pleaſe thée: wilt thou ſay that euery one is a foole?
               
               
                  Soule.
                  A foole? no: but that euery man thinketh ſo.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  Oh that is al one.

                  Know Iuſt, that euery man hath a brāch, &amp; be thou ſure, yt one greter thā an other: but this is y• differēce of yt wiſe &amp; y• fooliſh, y• the wiſe carieth it couered, &amp; the fooles carie it open in their handes that euery man ſeeth it.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  Ah, thou art diſpoſed.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  Be cōtent, I wil proue it thée in thy ſelf: how many times haſt thou walked in thy houſe, ſetting thy féete in the mids of the pauing tyles ſeking wt great diligēce not to touch y• ends?
               
               
                  
                  Iuſt.
                  Oh▪ a thouſande tymes, and haue bene about from my window to tell how many runne by, and to doe dyuers other childiſh things.

                  Then tel me, if thou haddeſt ſo done abroade, woulde not the chyldren haue runne aboute thée, as they doe about fooles?

                  By my faith thou ſayſt truth, and I will no more denye, but that I alſo haue my fondneſſe: and now doe I thynke that Prouerbe moſte true, which I haue oft hearde ſpoken, that if fooliſhneſſe were a paine, we ſhould heare groning in euery houſe.

                  I will tell thée more, thou ſhalte finde fewe men in the worlde, that haue lefte any fame, but if thou doſt conſider their life, they haue born their braunch vncouered: but bycauſe it hathe to them come well to paſſe, they haue bene praiſed, but I wil not we talke any more of this. Lette vs turne to our reaſoning, tell me howe thou that haſt no Grammer, nor haſt

ſtudied, diddeſt knowe, that laboure was giuen of God, to our firſt fathers for a penance &amp; puniſhment for theyr diſobedience.

                  Oh, doſt not thou knowe, that ſo ofte haſt redde with me the Bible, which I haue?

                  How doſt thou vnderſtand it?

                  Why ſhould I not vnderſtand it, knoweſt thou not, that it is in vulgare?
               
               
                  Soule.
                  Yes. I know.
               
               
                  Iuſt
                  Then why doeſt thou aſk me.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  To make thée confeſſe that thou haſt ſpoken, that if ſciences and the ſcripture were in the vulgar, thou ſhouldeſt vnderſtande them.
               
               
                  Iuſt
                  Yea, as touching the words, but to pierce to ye ſenſe, is an other mater.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  It is inough, that thou ſhouldeſt haue no difficultie in vnderſtandyng the wordes, but onely in the intelligēce of the ſenſe, which they haue alſo, that reade it in Greke or Latin: for thou mayſt not beleue, that by vnderſtanding

a tong, al authors be vnderſtanded, and all ſciences that be in the ſame: for to do that, there is néede of ſome ſchoolemaiſters and interpreters, and yet with great difficultie be vnderſtanded: and the like ſhold come if they were in vulgare. But now it is inough for me that thou knoweſt, that it is not tongues that make the learned men, but Science.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  Therefore a man can not bée learned, vnleſſe hée vnderſtande the Latin tongue, wherein they be all written: what wilte thou learne in ours?
               
               
                  Soule.
                  Thanke the Romaines that haue tranſlated, if the Latin tongue be riche, and blame the Toſcanes, that haue not cared for theirs, if theirs bée poore.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  All is, if the faulte commeth of the tongue, that it is not ſo copious of wordes, as men can write in it.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  Newe wordes be made, and brought to vſe as things require.
               
               
                  
                  Iuſt.
                  What? Is it lawfull to make newe wordes in a tongue?
               
               
                  Soule.
                  Yea, in them that be not dead, and of them onely, of whiche they be propre.
               
               
                  Iuſt
                  Which calleſt thou dead?
               
               
                  Soule.
                  Thoſe whiche be not ſpoken naturally in no place, as at this day, the Latin and the Greeke, and in our tongue, it is not lawful to make new words to them that be not propre and natiue vnto it.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  Why, is it not lawful to thoſe ſtrangers that knowes it?
               
               
                  Soule.
                  Bicauſe it not being to them naturall, they can not make them ſo, as they ſhall haue grace. Marke well ſuche as in our tongue, of ſome nowe a dayes haue bene deuiſed.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  Then thou iudgeſt it is none errour to make them in our tongue?
               
               
                  Soule.
                  Not of hym that ſpeaketh it naturally, rather were it laudable. Tell me, doeſt thou thyncke that eyther the Gréeke, or Latine tongue,

were ſo perfect and plentifull of wordes at the beginning as they were after when they flouriſhed with ſo worthy writers?
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  I beleue it not.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  Be thou wel aſſured: for there is none of theſe things that be exerciſed of vs, that was in the beginnyng perfectly produced of nature, or found out of arte: for if that could be done, the one of them ſhoulde be in vaine: for if Nature broughte forthe euery thing perfect, we ſhould haue no nede of Arte: and if Arte of hir ſelf coulde make them perfect, we ſhould haue no nede of Nature. Dyd not Cicero and Boetio, make new wordes when they would put philoſophie and Logike in the Latin tongue?
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  Dyd they borow them of other nations?
               
               
                  Soule.
                  Be thou ſure they did.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  And of whome?
               
               
                  Soule.
                  Of the Grekes, and the Grekes of the Hebrues, and the Hebrues

of the Egiptians. Haſte thou not heard that nothing can be ſayd, but that hath ben ſayd before? but the Romanes being other men, and of other iudgement than be now the Toſcanes, louing more their owne things (as reaſon is) than others, did ſtudy only ſtraunge tongs, to gather out of them that was good to enrich their owne.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  Truly in this me thinke they were worthy praiſe.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  Search all the aūcient things, and thou ſhalte ſée that there be fewe Romanes that wrote in Gréeke, as our Toſcanes do in latin, which is not their tongue, and for al their doing, it is wel knowne, that tha
                        •
                      puritie is not ſéene in their writings, which is ſéene in the ſtile of proper Latines.
                  
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  In this they deſerue to be excuſed, it not being their proper tongue as thou ſayſt.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  Rather they deſerue to be double blamed. Doſt thou remember thou haſt heard, that when M. Cato did read

certayn things of Albino the Romane, written in Gréeke, and finding that in the beginning he did excuſe him ſelfe, that they were not written with that elegancie that they ought, bicauſe he was a citizen of Rome and borne in Italie, and a ſtraunger to the Gréeke tong, he did not only excuſe him, but laughed at him, ſaying: Oh Albino, thou hadſt rather aſke pardon of an errour done, than not doe it.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  Truly theſe reaſons be ſo good, that I for me can ſay nothyng againſt them.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  Sée how the Romanes did ſéeke to enrich theyr tongue, and thought to bryng no leſſe noble fame by this, than by conquering to theyr Empyre ſome Citie or Kingdome: and that thys is true, reade the Proeme that Boetius makes in his tranſlation of Ariſtotles Predicamentes, where he ſayth: that being a man of Counſell, and not apt to warre, he woulde labour to inſtructe his countrey men wyth doctrine, and

that he hoped to deſerue no leſſe, nor be no leſſe profitable vnto them, by teachyng them the Arte of Gréeke ſapience, than they whych wyth force and valiauntneſſe, haue ſubdued ſome Citie or Prouince to the Romane Empire.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  O mindes and thoughtes, holy in déede, and wordes worthy a citizen of Rome: for the very office of a citizen is alwaies to helpe his countrey as much as he can, to the which we be no leſſe bound, than to our fathers and mothers.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  And therefore at this day is theyr tongue hadde in ſo greate eſtimation, for that it is ſo full of good Sciences, as he that wyll obtayne them muſt néedes fyrſte learne it: where, if our Toſcanes woulde tranſlate likewiſe the ſame, to them that would learne them, they ſhoulde not néede to ſpende foure or ſixe of their firſt beſt yeares to learne a tongue▪ that they might by the meane

therof paſſe to the ſciences, which other wiſe might he had with more eaſe and more ſurety: for thou muſt know this, that we neuer learne a ſtraunge tong to poſſeſſe it well, as we do our proper: and likewiſe a man ſpeaketh not ſo aſſuredly, nor with ſuch facility: &amp; if thou beleueſt not me, marke them whō thou knoweſt ſtudy the Latine tongue, that when they would ſpeake in it, it ſéemes they beg, they vtter their words with ſuch difficultie, and ſpeake ſo leiſurely.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  Thou ſaiſt truth, but this way of the Romanes was very good, to tranſlate into their tongue ſo many goodly things, that he that will vnderſtande them, muſt be forced to learn the tong, and ſo was diſperſed throughout the world.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  They did not onely this, but whiles they were Lordes of the world, they cauſed it to be learned of the moſt part of their ſubiects by force.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  And what did they?
               
               
                  Soule.
                  They had made a law, that no

Embaſſador ſhold be heard, vnleſſe he ſpake Latin: &amp; beſides, all cauſes that were hearde in all Prouinces vnder their gouernment, and al proceſſe, was written in the Latin tongue: wherfore all the noble men of euery cuntrey, and all the aduocates and attorneys were forced to learne the tongue.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  I doe not maruel though Rome became ſo great, if they vſed this way in other things.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  Of this I will not reaſon, for the goodly things that they got of al the world, doe make cléere teſtimonie to all that conſider it.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  O cuſtome very laudable, O citizens very louers of their countrey.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  This cuſtome, Iuſt, was not only of the Romanes, but of al other nations: Séeke as much as thou wilt, and thou ſhalt neuer finde that any Hebrue hath written in Egipt tong, nor Greeke in Hebrue, nor Latin (as I haue ſayd) in Greeke, and if there be any, they be very fewe.
               
               
                  
                  Iuſt.
                  Wher then haue theſe Toſcanes gotten this vſe, to write in Gramer as thou ſpeakeſt?
               
               
                  Soule.
                  Of their inordinate loue of themſelues, and not of their countrey, or of their tongue, for ſo doing, they haue thought to be taken the more lerned.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  They do as the Phiſitian that Iones had, which to ſéeme the more lerned, did ordaine certaine receipts wyth certain names out of vſe, that made me to maruell: among the which I remē

                  Soule.
                  Oh thou haſt ſayd well Iuſt, and if thou conſidereſt well, this world

is nothing elſe but a confuſion: yet if the Toſcanes woulde endeuour them to tranſlate ſciences into theyr tongue, I haue no doubt at all, but in ſhorte time it ſhould come into greater reputation than it is, for it is ſéene that it pleaſeth much, and is this day much vnderſtanded and deſired, and this cometh onely for naturall beauty and goodneſſe of it, the which thing ſtraungers not knowing, many times going about to pulliſh it, do blemiſh it, and ſo it comes properly to paſſe to hir as doth to a woman, which thinking to make hir ſelfe faire wyth painting, doth vtterly deſtroy hir ſelfe.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  How can that be?
               
               
                  Soule.
                  I will tell thée, whiles they ſéeke to make it more beautifull, and make the clauſes like to the Latin, they deſtroy the facilitie and naturall order of it, in the which conſiſts the beauty: and beſides, they will take ſome words vſed of Boccace or Petrark very ſeldom, the whych they thyncke the goodlyer,

bicauſe they be ſeldome vſed of them, &amp; bicauſe they haue not by nature the true ſignification, nor the true ſound in the eare, they put them in euery place, and many times out of purpoſe, and ſo they hurt the naturall beauty therof.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  I doubt if they cannot inunitate other, it might not be ſayde to them, as one Pippo ſaid to Francis di Loma, who thinking to excuſe him ſelfe of a croſſebeame which he had made in the gallerie of the Innocentes, which bowed toward the earth, ſaying he had taken it out of S. Iohns Temple, he aunſwered, thou haſt counterfaited only the worſt of it: but if the tong be of ſuch perfection as thou ſayſt, wherof comes it, that many of theſe lerned, do blame ſo much them, that tranſlate any thing?
               
               
                  Soule.
                  With what reaſon?
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  They ſay the tong is not apt, nor worthy, that ſuch things ſhould be tranſlated into it, and that it taketh frō them the reputation, and much embaſeth them.
               
               
                  
                  Soule.
                  All tongues, by the reaſons ITranſlation in vulgare. haue ſhewed thée before, be apt to vtter theyr conceit, and the buſineſſe of them that ſpeake, and if it were otherwiſe, they that vſe them, make them ſo: therfore alleage not this excuſe, for it is nothing worth.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  What cauſe then can moue them to ſay, that things tranſlated into the vulgare, be abaſed and loſe theyr reputation.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  That which I tolde thée this other day, which was the occaſion of ſo many other euils, euen the wicked ennie and deſire they haue to be compted more than other.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  Surely I beleue thou ſaiſt truth, for I remember me, that being one day among theſe learned folke, and one of them ſhewing that Bernard Segne had trāſlated; Ariſtotles Rhetorike into the bulgare, one ſayde he had done a great euill, and being aſked why, he anſwered, it was not méete that euery vulgar ſhould vnderſtand that, which an other

with great trauayle, hadde learned in many yeares, in Latine and Gréeke bookes.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  O wordes inconuenient, I wyll not ſay onely to a Chriſtian, but to a man, knowing how much we are bound to loue one an other, &amp; more to ye ſoule than to the body, to whō no greater good can be done, than to make eaſy the way of vnderſtanding.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  But ſofte a while, I remember they ſay an other thing.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  What?
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  They ſay that the things that be tranſlated out of one tongue into an other, neuer haue the force nor grace that they haue in their owne.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  They haue not that in theyr owne that they haue in other, for euery tongue hath hir fyneſſe and delicacie, &amp; peraduenture the Toſcane more than an other: and he that wyll ſée it, let him reade Dante or Petrarke, where they haue ſpoken of any thing that was before ſpokē of a Latin or Gréeke Poet,

and he ſhall ſée they paſſe hym farre, and that in fewe thyngs they be inferiour.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  But in tranſlations they muſte haue more regarde to the ſenſe, than to the wordes.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  I know they tranſlate, by reaſon of ſcience, and not to ſée the force or the beauty of the tongs: and if it were not ſo, the Romanes that thought theyr tongue the fayreſt in the world, would not haue tranſlated the feates of Mago of Carthage, into their tongue, nor tho Grecians that were ſo proude and vayn glorious of theirs, (calling all the reſte barbarous) the Egiptians and the Chaldeis workes: Neuertheleſſe in tranſlating, beſide that a man ought to be faith full, he muſt ſéeke to ſpeake the wordes as ornately as he can. Therefore it is neceſſary to him that tranſlateth, to know well the one tong and the other, and then to poſſeſſe well the things or Sciences that be tranſlated, that he

The Romanes that made ſo many, and had ſo many of the Greekes, they made them in none other tongue but in their owne. And likewiſe, Licurgus and Solon and others, that gaue lawes to all Greece, made them in none other tong, but in that the people vſed.

                  Ah this is a fault which I think

is not only to be giuen to prieſts, but to euery one, for there is no man that thinkes vpon other thyng, but to get money from an others bagge, and put it into his: but it is true, that prieſts Friers and notaries that doe it with wordes, be more wittie than other.

did ſay, that he deſired nothing elſe, but to be loſed from the body, and be with Chriſt: and the great delight, that I ſometime feele when I am frée from the impediments of the body as I am now, induceth me to conſider it.

                  I will not ſpeake now of the impedimentes whiche theſe organes wherin the ſenſes be exerciſed, do giue me, when they be altred of thée, either wyth too muche eatyng or drynking, or with too muche labour, and wyth a thouſande other paſſions: but tell me thys, howe ofte doe I, beyng forced of this thy parte of luſte, gyue place,

and leaue thée to do things, which be clean contrary to my nature. Wherfore I, ſéeing I am commaunded of a power inferiour to my ſelfe, fall into ſo great diſcomfort, that thou alſo feleſt it: for our vnion becometh a continual bataile, which doth ſuffer neyther of vs to be at reſt. Where as yf thou didſt obey me, and dydſt let me holde the bridle in my hande as were conuenient, we ſhoulde liue in ſuche peace, that the operations that procede of me, as they that haue their beginning of thée, and be giuen vs principally of nature, for our conſeruation, ſhoulde be broughte to their ende without any difficultie.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  I knowe certainly, thou ſayſt truth, and therefore I mynded to requeſt thée, that thou woldſt giue ſome order &amp; rule of it, what I ought to do, that we might long kepe oure ſelues in vnion, with the leaſt grief &amp; diſpleſure that is poſſible: I wyll not nowe ſay without any, for that I knowe to

be impoſſible in this life, But before thou doeſt this, I would deſire thée to rid me of that doubt, that much troubleth mée, and holdes me in ſuſpenſe, and that is (as I ſaid vnto thée yeſterday morning) how thou knowſt theſe things without me.

                  It is an harde thyng whiche thou demaundeſt of me, and before this time hath made many fall (which haue bene accompted wiſe) into great errours: therefore it might be better for thée not to know it: for to knowe that nedes not, genders more confuſion. Neuertheleſſe, for the ſatiſfactiō of thy deſire, I will tell thée what the opinions haue ben: but I will not after, that thou with thy diſcourſe of reſon ſhouldeſt confirme or content thy ſelfe with any of them, but ſubmit thy deſire to the determination of chriſtian religion, which bicauſe it is guided of light more cléere and ſure, than is the ſapience of man, it can not erre, as it doth.

                  Both in this and other, I will do that thou wouldeſt haue me.

                  Thanke thine age, whyche hath ſo cooled thy blood, and weakened thy force, as thou leaueſt a parte the pleaſures of the world, and art reduced to this way of life. Wherefore it may be rather ſayd (as once that Citizen didde) that ſinne hath left thée, before thou it.

                  Nor I wold not for this, but thou ſholdeſt cōtinue to do well, for if

And of this, Ariſtotle with his Peripatetical ſcholers isAriſtotle. head, although he ſpake not ſo, as it might cléerely be gathered of his wordes, whether he held I was mortal or immortall: but hée ſtrikes at large ſomtyme, and ſometyme ſo at hande, as ſome holde by hym, that I am immortall, and ſome mortall.

                  Howe doth he it?

                  I wyll tell thée. Haſt thou euer hearde of one that aſked counſell to take a wife? And when he ſayde, Shée is faire, take hir quod the other: And when he ſayd, ſhe is of euil bloud: take hir not then ſayd he: but ſhe hath a good dowrie, take hir then. No, ſhe is ſomewhat proude, take hir not: And ſo he ſtill anſwered yea or no, as he brought forth new matter. And ſo dothe Ariſtotle with me: For

when he conſidereth me vnited wyth my body, he ſayth, I am mortall, and when he conſidereth me, as an agent intellection, &amp; that I can worke without it, he ſayth, I am immortall: ſo as finally, he that readeth hym, is neuer certain, whether I am mortall or immortall.

                  I think ſo ſurely. Wherfore he dyd, as they do, that loue y• worlds glorie more than the truthe, whyche when they know not a thing, bicauſe they will not loſe their eſtimation, they wyll not confeſſe it, but ſpeake confuſedly, that men ſhoulde rather thinke they wyll not ſpeake it, than that they know it not.

                  As for me, I knowe no prince but that wold be angrie with his ſeruant, that woulde knowe a reaſon of all his doings. Me think this is plainly to cal God into the conſiſtorie. But tell I praye thée, whether theſe be the diuines, that are called Paris ſchole?

For Bartol ye bokeſeller my neighbor hath told me, that he ſelleth no more of thē, &amp; that he hath an hundred horſloade which he wold barter for cleane paper, and giue ſomewhat to boote.

                  Of theſe two ſectes which I ſpake, Plato which held I was immortall &amp; diuine, ſéeing that I vnderſtode euery thyng, ſayde, I was created of God, full of all ſciences eternally. And after when I deſcended into thée, (for ſo God had ordeined that I ſhold purgo me of certain ſpots that I had) I forgot them al: and after by helpe of Schoolemaiſters and exerciſes in ſtudies, I returned to my minde, and ſo hée ſayde, that our learnyng was

a remembrance, and not a learnyng of newe.

                  That opinion I could like wel inough.

                  Thou woldeſt ſay ſo, if thou heardeſt the reaſons that he maketh, whiche be ſuch, as they made Origene

                  Yea, and that we wer of angels ſhape, whiche opinion was after reproued of the churche as erronious and hereticall.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  Thou makeſt me now remember of my neighbour, which ſaid, that our ſoules were thoſe little Angels, which were not comprehended in ſin, nor in ſeruice of God, but betwéene bothe, and were after ſent into vs to

                  Mathew Palmer, doſt thou not remember? but thinkeſt thou he was damned for this?
               
               
                  Soule.
                  I do not beleue it: for though this opinion is holden erronious, yet he feared God, and regarded the honour of the ſame, and he was a louer of his neighbour, as thou doeſt well know, in the which things conſiſteth all chriſtian religion. So as it is not to be beleued, that a man of ſo holy and good behauior, for holding ſuch an opinion, which is not againſt the honor of God, ſhoulde be damned: and chiefly, beleuing he did not erre, and being euer diſpoſed to chaunge to the contrary, when nede had bene, as he

                  Iuſt.
                  I will not then ſay, that as his body was taken vp, by the comaundement of him that then did gouern the Florentine Churche, ſo hys ſoule was ſent to Hell.

                  But they gyue no more, for as they dyd put much money in their purſes one way, ſo are they great loſers an other.

I wyll ſpeake of none, but of him that toke in hand to delyuer a mans father from Purgatorie, promyſyng a Floren, and as ſoone as hée hadde it in hys hande, he ranne his way, ſaying you ſayde he is out, and that is inough for mée: for I can neuer thynke you will be ſo cruell, that you wyll putte hym there agayne for one Florens ſake.

                  Here it was lyke to that that Carlo Aldobrandy dydde to the obſeruant Friers, to whome he was bound by a legacie of his vncle to pay euery yere two Florens, to ſay an office for his ſoule. Then a certayne pardon commyng from Iulio, whereof theſe Friers were miniſters, gyuyng pardon to take ſoules oute of Purgatorie, the ſayd Charles tooke one for his vncle, and made it ſo to be written with their hande, and after when they went to him for theyr two Florens,

                  Maruel not, for ſuch is the ſapiēce of the world, &amp; al they that will walke only with the light of that, the more they learn, the leſſe they know, and wax continually more vncertain and leſſe quiet. Which Salomon wold very wel ſignifie, when he ſayth: He that ioyneth Sapience to a man, ioyneth dolor.

                  Why?

                  Bicauſe the things of Faithe, as thou ſayſt, be much more difficult, and farther paſſe our knowledge, thā of nature.

                  Yea to them that ſéeke to vnderſtande them with naturall lyghte, as I ſayd before, but not to hym that walketh with ſimplicitie of heart and light of the ſame.

                  And howe ſhall one do to haue thys light?

                  To prepare as much as mās power may to receiue it, and then as the Apoſtles dyd, to aſke it of God, who hauyng ſayde to vs: Aſke, and it ſhall be giuen you, he wil not fayle to giue them vs.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  And what preparation is it, we muſt make?

                  Firſt to perſuade our ſelues, that there is one intelligence that vnderſtandes more than we, and though we doe not vnderſtande howe he can

make a thing, yet it foloweth not but he can do it.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  In very dede it were a greate preſumption, not onely a foolyſhneſſe, to ſay, I vnderſtand not this thyng, and I can not do it, therfore it cannot be done.

                  Yet there be inow, that hold this opinion, and they may promyſe them ſelues, neuer to haue the lyke light, bicauſe it is written: God reſiſteth the proude, and to the humble he gyueth grace.

                  Further it behoueth to be exerciſed in the ſtudie of holy ſcripture, and aboue all to be a louer of religion, and euer to haue it in honour and reuerence moſt great: for who ſo euer is a deſpiſer of his religion, ought not to be called a man, muche leſſe to be put among the louers of ſapience, as Ariſtotle ſayth of thoſe Philoſophers that did diſpiſe and denye the Gods. And ſo doing, we obtaine of God, the

light of Faith, the whiche as I haue ſayde vnto thée, is onely it, that may quiet mans vnderſtanding.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  Wel, ſéeing thou iudgeſt it good to quiet my ſelfe, and be firme in the determinations of the faith, I am content, and therfore I pray thée, that leauing thoſe things whiche the wiſe of the worlde thinke, thou wouldeſt tell mée what the chriſtian religion hath determined: for in the other I neuer found quiet nor contentation.

                  Thou muſt beleue, bicauſe ſo it is, that ſo ſoone as the bodies be diſpoſed, God of his infinite power doth create vs diuine &amp; immortal, and doth create vs all equall, as touching thoſe powers without the which we ſhould be no reaſonable ſoules, but after gyueth vsſome particular giftes for our benefite, knowing that by the meane of them, we may the more eaſily obtain our perfectiō, and that we might worke alſo holily in the miniſterie of God, wherof he giueth to one the gift

of prophecie, to an other, the interpretation of Scriptures: &amp; to one, one thing, &amp; to an other acording as his ſapience diſpoſeth, &amp; ſemeth good to hys goodneſſe. And yet no mā ought to lamente, though it be in his power to make of one matter, ſome veſſels for honour, and ſome for rebuke.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  I thought you all had ben equal, &amp; that thoſe differences yt are knowne in a man, had riſen of the goodneſſe, or of the imperfection of the body, &amp; had not bene particular giftes of God.

                  So thinkes alſo, all the wiſe of the world, which walke only with the light of nature. And therefore not to loſe more tyme, thou muſt know, that if I knowe any thyng, whiche thou thoughteſt not, that it is a gifte, which God hath giuen me, bycauſe it hath ſo ſemed to his goodneſſe for our benefite, that I béeyng illuminated, might giue light, and gouerne thée. Of the which thyng we oughte muche to thāk him, bicauſe he hath only giuē it

for a weale: and I ought to guide thée in his ways, and thou not to ſtriue againſt my counſels.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  I know certainely (my ſoule) that thou ſayſt truth, and I féele that of theſe thy words is growne in me a certaine ſuretie, a contentation, and ſuch a quiet, that I am determined neuer hereafter to be contrary to thy will, nor rebell agaynſt thy counſell and lawes. Wherfore I praye thée, that thou wouldeſt tell me, what I oughte to doe, to maintaine my ſelfe in thys ſweete vnion, and chiefly in thoſe operations that depend and riſe properly of my ſelfe.

                  I think it ſhal be very méete, bicauſe I can not well worke if thou be not diſpoſed. But bicauſe it is now broade day, and the thing is ſomwhat long: I wyll that wée tarrie tyll to morowe, and therefore goe to thy buſineſſe.
               
            
            
               
               
                  The .vij. Reaſoning. IVST. SOVLE.
               O How the time flées away, it is day, &amp; yet me thinke I went but now to bed. This cometh bicauſe I haue ſlept wel, thinking of nothing. Wherfore I helde it out to the vttermoſte, from my firſte ſléepe till I awoke, &amp; therfore haue not knowne the time betwene, for I haue heard of a wiſe man, that it was the ſoule, that by muſing made ye time, wherof it comes, that they who be in miſerie, thinke the days and the nights long, bicauſe they euer thinke of theyr infelicitie: and the like haps to him that lokes for ſome thyng that he deſireth, bicauſe he thinks alwayes of it. When I was a boy, I thought it a thouſande yere from one Shrouetide till an other, bicauſe I deſired it, and now me thinke the one is no ſooner gone, but the other is come. And peraduenture I am as he

that hath money inough, &amp; paſſeth not what he ſpende, but when he hath but litle left, he beginneth to ſpare, &amp; thinks vpon it, as though he were robbed whē he departeth with any. But let euery man ſay what he wil, ſone is a yere, ten, and twenty, gone, &amp; mans life is a ſhort thing in deede, ſo as it is a great fooliſhneſſe of vs, that ſhall ſo little time tarye here, to charge and wrap our ſelues in ſo many matters of the worlde, whych kepes a man alwayes eyther in no ſmal feare, or in great trouble, and the more he hath, with the more he muſt ſtriue. But much more fooliſh be we to fighte with our ſelues, as we do the moſt part of our time, by the reaſon of our immoderate willes, which we noriſh with appetite. Wherfore we liue with cōtinual remorſe of reaſon, which doth alwayes moleſt vs: wheras if we did ſubdue our part ſenſitiue to the reaſonable, as becomes, we ſhould liue in mery and perpetuall peace, firſte with our ſelues, and then with little dolor or feare of things

which the world and fortune brings, as I knowe by experience, ſince that, that my ſoule being illumined of my lord, ſhe hath made mine eyes alſo open, whereby, being minded from hence forth to liue as ſhal become a man, I féele in me a quiet and contentation, as the lyke I haue not felt in my life: therfore bleſſed be thou alwayes (O my ſoule) that haſt ben the cauſe therof.
               
                  Soule.
                  What doeſt thou muſe Iuſt, that thou art ſo waking? what diddeſt thou thinke of?
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  I thought howe contented a man myght lyue, and how much more happy hys life ſhoulde be, if he woulde lyue after reaſon, and not after ſenſes, as he doth. Wherof it comes, that working, as a man may ſay, contrary to his nature, he lyueth in an vnquyetneſſe, and in a war with him ſelfe moſt great. For much greater be the vexatiōs that our inwarde paſſions worke, than the outward.

                  What other greater good had our firſt father Adam before he ſinned, than this inwarde peace and quiet?
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  Oh why haue it not we as well as he?

                  Bicauſe we haue loſte thorough his diſobedience, the gift of that iuſtice, which they call originall, which God had giuē him, which was nothing but a bridle and a rule, that kept the inward partes ſubdued &amp; obedient to the ſuperiour, by the which the fleſh did not kicke againſt the ſpirit, nor the ſenſitiue partes wholy did deſire other in man, but the preſeruation of the ſingular, called indeuided, by the benefite of the part reaſonable, and not for delight, as they doe nowe, nor did ſéeke other than the good it ſelfe: the which thing thy Dante no leſſe pleaſantly than learnedly doth expreſſe, when being brought to the earthly Paradiſe, in the ſtate of innocencie, he cauſed Virgill thus to ſay.
               
               
                  Free I am, and right is thy pretence,
                  And wil not do a fault for pleaſure of the ſenſe.

                  Well my Soule, me thinke I am returned into this ſtate, ſince I began to be reconciled with thée, and hauing no more mater to trouble me, and not deſiring other, than to liue after thy counſell, I féele ſuch a contentment in my ſelf, that I thinke I am happy. But I lamēt me much of thée, that thou haſt not taught me thus to liue in my youth, for then would I haue thought my ſelfe moſt happy.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  Lament of thy ſelfe, for thou waſt the cauſe, for I neuer fayled, when thou gaueſt thy ſelf wholy a pray to thy ſenſes, as beaſts do, to reproue thy ſelfe, at the leaſt with the remorſe of conſcience, if not otherwiſe. But thou driuen of paſſions and ſeruent deſires, whych that age bringeth with it, didſt bewrap thy ſelfe in falſe pleaſures of the world, that eyther thou dydſt not heare me, or not regarde mine admonitions.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  I wil not here after do ſo again.

                  Thinke of it in time, as I haue ſayde vnto thée before, for when thou

goeſt about it, thou ſhalt find it yet pain ful, bicauſe of thy former vſe of life.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  Wel, be it as thou wilt, we wil no more ſtriue, &amp; I will doe after thy way, but I pray thée, y• thou wouldſt giue me ſome rule, how I ſhoulde rule my ſelfe, that I may liue in accord with thée, this little time that is lefte, &amp; ſhew me what I ought to regard that I might be with thée ſo long as might be, &amp; with ye feweſt diſpleaſurs, as wel of thée as of me.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  This pleaſeth me much, for I alſo, though I can attaine to my chiefe perfectneſſe, I deſire to be in thée, ſo lōg as may, for without thée, I am in a maner vnperfect, &amp; this can not be but by the meane of life: which as I ſaid vnto thée afore, conſiſteth in natural heate, &amp; grounded moyſture, of the which vntill the one be ſpent by violence, or ye other by old age, the life endureth: the which thing, ſome Philoſophers conſidering, ſaid, I was nothing elſe but a temperature of complexion. If I then teach thée to maintayne this temperature, I ſhall teach thée to liue long, but ſée yu ſuffreſt

not thy ſelf after to be ouercome of wil.

                  Of this I haue ſaid vnto thée diuers times yu ſholdſt haue no ſuſpition.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  Many things ther be, that haue néede to be conſidered &amp; regulate neceſſary to the life of man, which, for being more perfect than any other creature, &amp; better membred, that by the multitude of inſtruments, he might exerciſe many operations, &amp; not one alone or fewe, as other creaturs do, he hath néede of more things than any other, &amp; chiefly ought to conſider the aire, the place, and the houſes where he dwell.

                  The hate may be ſometime iuſt and reaſonable, but enuie neuer. And that is, bicauſe a man may iuſtly hate the euill things, but he can not with reaſon euer enuie the good, but when they haue it that doe not deſerue it: but that is no enuie. This iudgement muſt

be left to God, that can not erre, &amp; therfore many ſhal confeſſe they haue ſome in hate, ſhewing that he deſerues it, but no man, or ſeldome, will confeſſe he beares enuie to any man, but rather when he doeth it, he wil ſéeke wayes to couer it, ſaying he hateth, affirming that he which hateth not euil, deſerueth blame.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  Certainely, all that thou telleſt me, is true.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  We ſée alſo, when they whom thou hateſt, fal in miſerie, or infelicitie, thou ceaſeſt to enuie them. But hate doeth not ſo, but euer foloweth him, who is hated, in what eſtate ſo euer he be.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  This alſo is true.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  Further, hate faileth as oft as thou art perſuaded, that he whom thou hateſt is good, or that he hath done thée no iniurie: where as enuie, the better he is ſpoken of, whom thou enuieſt, the more thine enuie increaſeth.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  It is truthe.
               
               
                  
                  Soule.
                  Hate alſo many times is quē
                     ched, when he to whom thou beareſt it, doth thée ſome benifite: wheras enuie, (what ſoeuer benifite he doth thée, that is enuied) neuer diminiſheth. And ye like is, when any gift is made thée.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  This is well ſéene true euery day, yet giftes haue many times ſuche force, as of enimies they make friends.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  Then it is not to be maruelled, though they doe many times corrupt iuſtice.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  Our friend ſaid wel, which was to pleſant wt this deuiſe, yt he only ioyed in preſent ſtate, bicauſe y• time paſt was gone, &amp; the time to come was vncerten.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  Hate finally, til the thing hated be vtterly extinct, perſecuteth euer, as we ſée many times one enimy to an other, wheras enuie ſo ſoone as felicitie faileth in him whom he enuieth, ceaſeth ſtraight: and thou knoweſt Iuſt, when it commeth properly of enuie, as of a houſe, the which bicauſe it is too highe, kéepes y• light from thée, which anoyeth

thée, whiles it is ſo high, but when it is made lower, thou careſt no more,
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  This ſimilitude hath wel ſatiſfied me.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  Art thou yet certain, that hate and enuie be not one thing?
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  I am.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  And that the cauſe of enuie, or to ſay better, the fault, is in the enuier, and riſeth in him of his nature euil, hauing enuie (as I haue ſayd) only to the felicitie of an other, where in hate, it is in the thing hated, the which is naught to thée or to an other, or ſo ſéemeth, hating only the euill, or that doeth the iniurie?
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  This I graunt.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  Then tel me, what be thy felicities, or what partes haſte thou to be enuied?
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  I can not tel, I liue quietly, cō

                  This may euery man doe as

well as thou.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  It may peraduenture be, bicauſe I liue quietly after my ſtate. And biſides this, I haue ſome qualitie more than other, and haue frendes that make accompt of me.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  This is the leſſe cauſe, for though thou art well to liue, according to thy calling, yet thou art not rich: and the rich be they that be enuied. Againe,The riche enuied. though thou mayſt be called witty, and of good iudgement by my help &amp; worke, yet thou art not excellent, that any man might enuie thée therefore. If vertue may be enuied, if Nobilitie of bloud, of parents, or of ſtate, I am moſt certaine that thou doubteſt not, vnleſſe thou be a foole, nor for thy friendes, not hauing ſuche as might make thée to be repined, many of them being worſe thā thy ſelf.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  Wherof comes it then, that they grudge at me?

                  That is the very thing I thought to tell thée, that we bothe conſidering theſe things, and the occaſions,

might auoide the cares that come thereby, the little time we haue héereafter to liue.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  And that is the thing that I deſire to know, therefore tell me what I muſt doe, not to faile?

                  Knowe (Iuſt,) among other things, of defecte and want which olde age bringeth with it. It bréedeth in him that knoweth not him ſelf wel, ſuch an opinion of him ſelfe, that makes him think him ſelf wiſer than he is, wherby he ceaſeth not to praiſe him ſelfe, &amp; his things, &amp; to blame without all modeſty other mens, to reproue, without all diſcretion yong men, not remēbring what he did when he was yong, as they be.

                  Is not an olde man wiſer than other, though for nothing elſe, but for his experience?

                  Yes: but all is, wiſely to vſe his wiſdome in time, where and when it is conuenient. For doing otherwiſe, in chaunge of reuerence and honor, he getteth diſpraiſe and hate, of the which

thing y• maiſt wel take exāple of thy ſelf

                  I wil tell thée, thou art ſo vainglorious of thy ſelf, that thinking thou haſt no péere, thou deſpiſeſt and contemneſt all men. And thou wilt ſtand ſome time in reaſoning, as one that deceue

                  There is nothing in y• world ſo euill, but may be good for ſome purpoſe. Tell how many Mines &amp; Herbes venemous be in the world, which being wel vſed, be good to heale a thouſand of our diſeaſes. And ſo it is of enimies, for as thoſe beaſts that abound with heat, doe not onely digeſt many peſtiferous things, but alſo nouriſhe themſelues, where it would doe many other hurte, and as hunters doe not only take héede that the wilde beaſts do not hurt them, but alſo do féede of their fleſhe, and clad them of their ſkins: ſo wiſe men doe not only know how to deale with their enimies, as they can not hurt them, but alſo can get profite by them.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  What profite can be gotten of enimies?
               
               
                  Soule.
                  I wil tel thée Firſt thy enimies doe thee this good: as the ſcoute &amp; garde of a citie beſieged, giues aduiſe to him that hath charge of al that might offēd, ſo they ſtanding alwayes waking to obſerue thy behauior, they aduiſe thée

by ſpeaking euill, and reprehendyng all that thou doeſt, of all that thou oughteſt to take heede.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  So do alſo true friends.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  They doe: But bicauſe the loue they beare thee, dothe ſometime blind them, they ſee not many tymes thoſe wantes whiche the enuious ſee. And although they do ſee, yet being of thy part, they excuſe thē. And ſo ſomtime they wil call craft policie, which thine enimie will call plaine malice, or fraude. Is not he therfore to be ſet by, that markyng all thy operation, might reproue thée of all thine error? And is not this able to work a knowledge in thée of ſuch prudence, y• thou maiſt euer regard what thou doſt, and reſtrain thy ſelf, at the leſt with fear, and euer liue vertuouſly &amp; honeſtly?
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  It is true, that a man hath more feare to erre in the ſight of his enimie than of his friende.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  Therefore it is good to haue both friends and enimies, that at leſt

feare may draw thée from that which might work thy ſhame. Which thing Scipio Naſica well knewe, when hée hearde one ſaye, that the Romane eſtate was in moſt ſuretie, bicauſe the Grekes were brought to bondage, and Carthage ouercome: Rather is it (ſayd he) nowe in moſt great peril, bicauſe they haue nowe no more whome to feare or reuerence.

                  Oh goodly ſaying, and worthy ſo good a man.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  And ſo ennimies (doing as he that would haue ſtryken Prometheus of Theſsalia, did cut an impoſtume that he had, and healed him) many times beleuing to hurt, they do thée good.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  Wilt thou not graūt me that it is better to haue frends thā enimies?Friendes.
                  
               
               
                  Soule.
                  Yes, and ſpecially when they are faithful, nothing in the world eyther more ſwéete or profitable than true frēdſhip. Neuertheleſſe enimies ſerue many times to ſtirre thée wyth their bitter words, which frends with

their gētle reprehētion do not. Beſide they aduiſe a man of certaine cōmon faults, which friends ſeldome know.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  Of thys I know thou ſayſt wel.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  Enimies alſo helpe to this, that in ſuffring both them and the iniuries they doe thée, a man is acquainted the better to beare the troubles that come in the care of houſeholde, and in rulyng eyther hym ſelfe, or hys familie, whereby it ſéemeth not ſo ſharpe vnto thée, if Fortune gyue thee eyther a ſhreude wife or children of euil condition, or beaſtly brethren, and ſo ar no leſſe profitable to thée thā thy friendes: for as thou learneſt of thy friends by their conuerſation, benignity, magnanimitie, &amp; many other vertues, thou learneſt by bearing thy enimies, mildeneſſe &amp; pacience, which howe nedeful it is in this world, thou knoweſt, euery houre ſomewhat hapning that diſpleaſeth vs.

                  That is often ſene, and be ſure troubles inowe in euery one.
               
               
                  
                  Soule.
                  Enimies be alſo profitable, bicauſe hauing ſometime with whom to contend, a mā becomes more ware in his ſpéech, more prompt in anſwer, more quick in accuſing, more ſage in defending, more prudent in reprehending, and more prompt in returnyng iniurious wordes to him that ſpeakes them. But I will not they ſerue to y• purpoſe, for being nowe in y• age that we muſt ſhortly change our coūtrey, euery thing is méeter for thée than cō

                  Iuſt.
                  How woldeſt thou then, that I ſhold gouern me, with theſe thou ſpekeſt of, that haue me ſo in hate, for I wil now beleue it is ſo, for the ſtrong reaſons that thou haſt made therin.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  I will tell thee: thou muſt doe

two things, one of the which, and the more of weight, pertaineth to thy ſelf and that is, that thou take away all thoſe cuſtomes and maners, of which may procéede this hate, whiche they beare thee, as to deſpiſe or to contemn any perſon, and to blame other mens things, and the preſēt time, and thoſe maners y• be vſed now a days, though thou be otherwiſe affected.

                  Shoulde I not blame thyngs when they bee not well? If I ſhoulde doe ſo, they woulde ſay I vnderſtode nothing.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  I will, if thou wilte get the name of a wiſe or prudent man, that thou doe it with woorkyng, and not with reprouing, for that is the waye which the ignorant vſeth, and malicious: and when thou ſéeſt a thing that ſtandes not well, it is inough not to praiſe it, and learne of our Punturino, who, though there be fewe in this age, that can compare with hym in painting, neuer blames any other mēs

works, vnleſſe he be forced to ſay his iudgemēt in a caſe. Praiſe thoſe that thou praiſeſt, moderatly, y• no diſdayn grow among them of that ſciēce, y• are not praiſed of thée. And in ſumme, lay away y• opinion thou haſt of thy ſelfe to be wiſer than other, for that wold make thée litle to eſtéeme other, &amp; the things that do not depēd of thée, wherby thou ſhouldeſt be called raſhe or proude: &amp; thou maiſt wel do it, when thou thinkeſt other be men as wel as thy ſelfe.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  This I can eaſily beléeue, for I neuer founde man yet but in ſome thing knew more than my ſelfe.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  And when it ſhall happē that thou defēdeſt an opinion againſt ſome other, do it as modeſtly as thou canſt, praiſing always him that doth as our maiſter Pier Francis Iambulari, a man certainely of no leſſe good iudgement than great learning in his operation, wherin he hath with maruellous arte founde the ſcite and meaſure of Dants

                  Canſt not thou, being a chriſtian man, be cōtent to do it for euery man, as a man ought to do it? yea, I wil further, that thou loue thine enimies: for in this onely conſiſteth the perfection of our lawe, and in this, it paſſeth in goodneſſe all other: for wher the other graunt a man may doe iniury to him that doth it to thée, our law, deſiring to make man good, will not only thou pardon thine enimies, but alſo thou loue them.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  O how can a man do that? thou haſt told me, that he that doth thée iniurie, thou hateſt.

                  An enimie may be loued, not for hym ſelfe, but for others cauſe, in ſuch ſort, as thou loueſt the childrē or ſeruāts of thy great friend, although they haue done thée iniurie. For thou conſidering that thy neighbor is alſo the ſonne of God as well as thou, and bought with the ſame price, that thou wert, although he be thy enimie, thou mayſte loue hym for Gods ſake: for doing otherwyſe, thou ſhouldeſt loſeParadiſe. 
                     Paradiſe.

                  Howe ſhoulde I loſe it, is it mine?

                  Iuſt.
                  Which way?

                  Tell me, when doeth the inheritance of the father come to the ſonnes?

                  So ſoone as he dieth.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  Then Paradiſe was oures as ſoone as Chriſt died for vs, if that reaſon were good. But▪ thou haſt not ſayd wel in that, y• the heritage of a father

is his ſonnes as ſoone as he is borne, and that none other thing doeth make him heire, but being a ſonne, nor that the father ſeeketh for other thing to haue children, but to haue to whome to leaue his inheritāce. And ſo we, as ſoone as we be borne the ſonnes of God, and brethren of Chriſte by baptiſme and faithe, we be ioyntely heires wyth hym of the Kyngdome of Heauen. And by this cauſe, a babe that ſodainely dieth, ſo ſoone as he is baptiſed, goeth to Paradiſe, whiche is his onely, bycauſe he is the ſonne of God, and not by any other merite, he neuer hauing done any meritorious déede.

                  If Paradiſe be ours, what néede we then doo any good?
               
               
                  Soule.
                  Yes, it is neceſſarie, not to gayne the heritage of Heauen, which is oures by the merites of Chriſt, as I haue ſayde, but bycauſe that wée ſhoulde not gyue an occaſion to our Father of Heauen, to diſenherite

vs, as all children doe, which behaue thēſelues euill toward theyr fathers. Therfore a man muſt do good workes onely to the glorie and honor of God, folowing Chriſt, which wrought wel whiles he was in this world, onely to do the will of his father: ſo ought we to worke wel, to do his will (and not to degenerate and want of that is cō

                  Thou haſte thys mornyng my ſoule, kindeled in my hearte ſuche a loue towarde my creator, that I am

                  This is it that I deſire aboue all other thyngs: for thys ſhall make thée worke as it behoueth a free child, and not as a ſeruaunt for ſcare: and in this good purpoſe, I will that to the honoure and glorye of hym, wée make an ende of this mornyngs talke.

                  Iuſt, Iuſt, what a fondeneſſe is thys? Doeſt thou ſuffer thy reaſon ſo to be ſhadowed wyth Irethat thou curſeſt yeares and tyme on this faſhion?

                  Who would not curſe, when they make thyngs olde? Olde Age beyng nothyng elſe but a receptacle of troubles and griefes, and a priuation of all pleaſures, whiche is worſe, and a ſhort way that leades al thyngs to corruption?
               
               
                  Soule.
                  Howe many tymes haue I ſayde, that all ages be good, to hym that can vſe them as is conueniente: but we vſe them ſo, many tymes, that when we ſhoulde blame our ſelues we doe complayne of other, and moſte tymes wrongfullye, as thou doeſt nowe of olde Age, muche lamenting

                  Why ſo my ſoule? thou wilt make mée thynke that thou arte not the ſame thyng that I am, as I dydde beleue, ſince thou ſayeſt I am bound to that that kepes me from reſt.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  Sléepe is a priuation of the moſt part of our exerciſes, and particularly of all pleſures and delights.

                  Rather it is a lightning of all our cares, and a moſt ſwete repoſe to all our troubles.

                  That is true, but that makes not agaynſte my ſentence, and leſſe proueth that ſléepe ſhall be good: for firſte, to mée it is euill, takyng from me the power of contemplation and to conſider the nature of thyngs, occupying all thoſe partes that be neceſſarye to mée to vſe in that office, whiche grieueth me not a little: for I am not wearie, nor ſuffer paine of my woorkes, but rather, the more I

worke, the greater delite I haue, bicauſe I am not corporall, nor made of matter as thou arte, which ſhould cauſe me any trouble, in making reſiſtance to my operations.

                  How, art not thou wearye as well as I, which as ofte as I haue gone about to reade at night after ſupper, haſte cauſed a ſléepe to come vpon me, that I muſt néedes goe to bed, and leaue reading.

                  Ah Iuſt, it is not I that hath bene weary, but theſe thy inſtruments, (without the which, I can not vnderſtande any thing,) being ſhutte wythin thée, haue bene ſo wearyed, conſuming too muche of thoſe ſpirites, by ye meane whereof they doe their operations, that it hath ben conuenient for vs to repoſe vs, to thée by nature, and to me by reſpect that I am in thée.

                  I know not this, but I ſée that thou haſt as well ſlept as I.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  I will not haue thée ſay ſo, for I haue bene euer awaked, in ſuche

maner as I can. Bicauſe ſléepe, (I not being corporall) hathe no place in me, and that this is true, thou knoweſt that he that ſléepes, doth nothing: but I faile not to worke ſome way.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  What operations be they, that thou doeſt when I ſléepe?
               
               
                  Soule.
                  Firſt I attende with my encreaſing power, to make digeſtyon muche better than when thou arte awake, for not hauing the heart to ſende the ſpirits to the ſenſes, that they might doe their office, he ſendes them to the partes, where digeſtion is made, and ſo I attende continuallye wyth greater force, to turne the nutriments into thy ſubſtaunce.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  Oh, am not I alſo appertaining to doe this operation?
               
               
                  Soule.
                  Yes, as occaſion, wythout the which it can not be done, and as a pacient, but not as an agent and principall, for thou knoweſt wel, that I haue tolde thée, that neither of vs can worke without the other. Although I acknowledge

my ſelfe ſo noble, that I thinke I coulde vnderſtande ſome thing without thée. Goe then further to my power ſenſitiue, which thoughe ſome of them be bound with ſléepe, as the outwarde ſenſes, and the ſenſe common, bicauſe thoſe places where they be exerciſed, be full of fumoſitie, ſo as they doe not wake, till they be conſumed of heate naturall: and fanſie neuer ceaſeth to doe ſomewhat: wherefore regarding to thoſe viſions and images of things that haue impreſſed the ſenſes in the heart, or in the bloud windy, whiles they were awake, doeth cauſe Dreames, and ſo that is alſo neuer idle.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  What, there be ſome that dreames not, and ſome that dreames fearefull things and inordinate, in ſuche ſorte, as thou arte little bounde vnto them.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  Very fewe.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  Be thoſe men, that dreames not

ſometime, at leaſt when they be olde, if not afore: for not to dreame commeth of too moiſt a complexion, the which filleth the head with ſuche fumoſitie, that they trouble it, and doe not ſuffer thoſe Images that are ſene in ſléepe, to gather whereof it comes, as of a ſtone caſte after an other in a firme water, making thoſe circles and images that the firſt had made. And therefore children, and ſuche as goe to ſléepe as ſone as they haue eate and dronke, doe ſeldome dreame. But thou ſhalt ſée them after in their age, when this moiſture is dried vp, dreame ſomtime of feareful dreames whereof thou ſpeakeſt. Euill complexion is likewiſe the cauſe, which being diſtempered, either of ſome infirmitie, or of too much drink, or of ſome melancholie or ſtraunge thought, genders ſpirites, (in the which the things be impreſt that men dreame,) ſo confuſed and diſordinate, as they bring forthe ſuche monſtrous apparitions as thou ſpeakeſt of. But what can be ſaid worſe

of ſlepe, if it, priuing you of al pleaſures, doe not ſuffer you to féele any thyng at all?
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  If a man whiles he ſléepeth, féeleth no pleaſures, he féeleth alſo no diſpleaſures: of the which I knowe not which he more and greater.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  I know well there haue bene ſome of ſo timorous minde, that eſtéeming more euery little dolor, than euery great contentation, haue ſayd that ſléepe is one of the beſt and acceptable giftes that nature hath giuen to man, bicauſe it maketh all equall and alike, whiles they ſléepe: for féeling nothing, the poore is as happy as the rich, whiles he ſléepeth, the which opinion I neuer alowed. For if it were ſo, it were better to be a ſtone, or a trée, which féele not, than to be a beaſt or a man: and among beaſtes and men, he that euer ſléepeth, or the moſt parte of time, ſhold be more happy than the other. Which thing is moſt falſe, for ſléepe maketh vs like to deade men, which ſome other conſidering,

called it Deathes brother.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  Why doe they call it ſo, they canSleepe, deathes brother. not make it euill? Doe we not ſée two brethren, the one good, and the other naught, thou haſt red with me in the Bible, the ſtory of Eſau and Iacob.
                  
               
               
                  Soule.
                  Yea, but he that hath called it deathes brother, hath not conſidered it as a brother by generation, but by ſimilitude which it hath, depriuing you as it doth, of all your operations felicities and contentations, which conſiſteth in operation. Wherefore, God, bicauſe he can euer vnderſtand himſelfe, and not ſometime yea, and ſometime no, is called moſt happy: and the like be thoſe intelligences that ſerues him, bicauſe they be neuer letted of any thing, and may alwayes beholde God, wherby they be reputed more happye and bleſſed than we, which althoughe we may well ſometime taſte by contemplation parte of him, we can not ſtand long in ſo happy eſtate, bicauſe we be hindred of many diuers things: wherof

that parte which is in vs, that vnderſtandeth, bicauſe it vnderſtandeth not alwayes, but ſometime yea, and ſometime no, is called intellect by name of a power, and they bicauſe they vnderſtand euer, are called intelligences, by name of operation, and of acte.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  Theſe thy reaſons be very good, but they haue not yet perſuaded me, that ſléepe is not good. And when I remember the great pleaſure that I haue in ſléeping one ſléepe of will, as when I am weary, (which thing chaunced to me oftener, when I was a yong man, than it doeth now,) I can not but be ſory of olde age, that hath taken it from me in ſuche ſort, that mine may for the moſt parte, rather be called a ſlumbring than a ſléeping.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  Ah, haſt thou ſéene that of thy ſelfe, thou haſte confeſt that ſléepe is not good?
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  Oh, in what manner? thou haſt vnderſtanded me cleane contrarie.
               
               
                  
                  Soule.
                  Rather haue I vnderſtanded thée well.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  How?
               
               
                  Soule.
                  Bicauſe thoſe things that be not good of their proper nature, but only for reſpect of other, be not called good abſolutely, but by chaunce and reſpect, and to them onely that haue néede, among the which is ſléepe, the which being as thou haſt ſaid, a reſtoring of trauailes, and of the paines of creatures, is only good to them, and yet not euer, but when they haue néede. And if it ſéeme, it bringeth them ſome delight, it is in reſpect of this wearineſſe, which were muche better not to haue, as thoſe intelligences, whereof I ſpake afore, to whome it were a greate impediment and annoyance, bicauſe they are neuer weary, for it ſhoulde diminiſhe their felicitie, at leaſte ſo muche time as they were occupied of it. But that thou ſholdſt be more cleare of this, tel me, is eating and drinking to be put among good things?
               
               
                  
                  Iuſt.
                  Who doubteth of that, being a thing ſo good and ſo deſired, to liue, and that without thē nothing can be maintayned aliue?
               
               
                  Soule.
                  Then what is the cauſe thou doeſt not eate and drinke alwayes?
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  Now heare a goodly matter that thou haſt ſpoken: bicauſe when I haue taken of them as much as my néede requireth, I haue no deſire, and hauyng no deſire, I haue no delight. Wherfore to eate or drinke more, ſhould as much loth me, as afore it did delight me.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  Then ſée, that to eate, to drink, to ſléepe, and like things be good, only to ſupply a want of them that haue néede: and the wante of a thing neceſſary, to the being or the wel being of an other, is neuer good, and it were much better not to haue néede. Wherof thou mayſt cléerely knowe, that if olde age had not taken away thy ſleepe, cauſing thée to haue leſſe néede of ſleepe than thou wert wont, thou hadſt wrongfully complayned of hir, as thou doeſt alſo, lamenting

of time &amp; yeares, which thou ſaiſt, hath brought thée to this ſtate, fooliſh &amp; vnkind that thou art.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  O why may I not reaſonably complaine me of time, it onely being y• which hath made me ſo to grow olde?
               
               
                  Soule.
                  Firſt, bicauſe olde age is not worſe in it ſelfe, than the other be: and furder, bicauſe it is not time that cōſumeth and maketh things olde.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  Neuer tel me that, y• it is better to be olde than yong, for certainly, if I had .xxv. yeares leſſe, I would thinke my ſelfe happy.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  If thou hadſt .xxx. leſſe, thou ſholdſt be but Iuſt the Couper, as thou art now, and perhaps ſhouldeſt be in an age much more perillous and ful of trauaile than this is, that thou art in now. But I will not ſpeake of this: for I will make thée know it manifeſtly, when I liſt. I
                        •
                      I doe not ſhew thée firſt, how falſe and fooliſh thy opinion is in complayning of time, &amp; more, that thou art olde, being a naturall thing to be olde. And no man ought to lament of thoſe

things that nature brings.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  Say what thou wilt, for ſeing I cā not ſléepe, it ſhal grieue me leſſe, to looke for day, and ſhall reioyſe me of that good that thou ſayſt little ſleping bringeth.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  Thou doeſt Iuſt, as the moſt part of men, the which not ſeing manifeſtly the cauſe, which conſumeth &amp; waſteth things, when they ſée any preſent, they doe attribute it to the time. Wherof if they ſée a man wax olde, or forget that he knew, they ſay it comes of time, &amp; likewiſe when they ſée an houſe fall. yet whā they ſée it builded, they impute it to the workeman. When they ſée a man grow, and come to perfect ſtature, they attribute it to nature. And ſo whē they ſée he learnes, they ſay his maiſter hath taught him.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  What meaneſt thou by this?
               
               
                  Soule.
                  Let me firſte tell thée what Time is, &amp; then thou ſhalt ſée. Time, Iuſt, as I haue often heard, is nothing but a meaſure, by the which all motions be meaſured, which thinges

corporall doe, euen as thou doeſt with thy Brace, wherwith thou meaſureſt al things in thy ſhoppe: and as that in it ſelfe and properly, is a péece of woodde, and intencionally in mannes minde by conſideration, and as it ſerueth for meaſure of things, it is a meaſure: ſo Time in it ſelfe, &amp; really, is the motion of heauen, and as it ſerues for the meaſure of other motions, it is called Time.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  I vnderſtande thée, and not vnderſtande thée, and I would haue thée declare it better.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  Heare me, and that thou mayſt the better vnderſtand, thou muſt know that a thing whych muſt all be brought vnder a determyned quantitie, thou muſt sée it ſo neyther more nor leſſe in thy imagination, but with one of the very ſelfe ſame ſorte, which thyng thou proueſt euery hour in thy ſelfe: for whē thou wilt compt the patens in thy ſhop, bicauſe they be things diuided and ſeperated, thou muſt doe it with numbers, which be alſo deuided &amp; ſeperated. And

when thou wylte meaſure an Axiltrée, thou muſt take a yarde, that is ioyned and continued, as that is.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  This is moſt true.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  Wherefore, when men wyll meaſure motions, whych they ſée continually in theſe things, generable and corruptible, it was of neceſſitie to do it otherwiſe. And bicauſe in al meaſures, this condition of neceſſitie is ſoughte, by reaſon they mighte be inuariable, and neuer chaunge, otherwyſe thyngs coulde not be meaſured by them, (for if thy yard ſhould ſometime diminiſh and ſometime increaſe, thou couldeſt neuer meaſure any thing rightly with it) men not findyng any motion among theſe natural things, that wēt alwais equally, not varying, they wente to them of heauen, and not finding among them any ſo righte, as that, whych the ſtarry Sphere maketh, called of them by thys occaſion, without error, they toke that to be a meaſure for other, meaſuring with it all other motions that be found

within theſe things that be moued, the which thing thy Dant dothſo maruellouſly ſhew in his .xx. chapter of Paradiſe, when he ſpeketh of this ſphere.
               
               
                  The Nature of motion,
                  That in the midſt doth reſt
                  And elſe vvhere moues,
                  Hath heere aboute, hir mark addreſt.
               
               And after ſaith.
               
                  His motion is not by other meane diſtinct,
                  But other all by his, that neuer is extinct,
                  And hovv the time, hath his foundation,
                  Thou maiſt it knovv by this declaration.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  Truly he ſaith very well. But we giue ſo much loue to this our Dant, that I doubt we will make him ſéeme more faire than he is.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  Doubt not of that Iust. For I tell thée, Dant is one of the beſt writers, (as I haue heard of many learned men that is in any tong.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  I would not we ſhould prayſe him ſo, as we ſhold be diſprayſed, as we were once, in defending him that diſprayſed him.

                  What ſay they whome thou

                  Iuſt.
                  That we ought to haue ſome reſpect to his good qualities: yet yu knoweſt he was on of y• moſt excelēt in our time.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  Surely he was a man in all other things to be honored, but in this not hauing reſpect to Dant, we ought to haue none of him, &amp; chiefly of vs Florentines, y• do defend our Citizen, &amp; one that hath ben a chief light of our countrey, &amp; cauſeth the name of Florence to go through the world. So thou mayſt aunſwer them, that ſhall ſay any more ſo thée, as one did once, which defēding him ſelfe a good while with the ſtaffe of a Partiſane, &amp; in the ende the dogge byting him, he turned the point, &amp; ſtroke him with y• ſharp, whoſe Maiſter ſaying to him, he ſhould haue ben content to ſtrike him with the ſtaffe, he aunſwered: then ſhold he haue bytten me with his taile. But lette vs ouerpaſſe, theſe and turne to reaſoning. This ſphere not erring, called alſo the fyrſt mouable, bicauſe it is the firſt and principall

cauſe of al other motions, turning euery .xxiiij. houres about the earth once, maketh the day naturall. And this motion as moſte regulate, is after taken by the meaſure of other motiōs, for of him is made the wéeke, and of wéekes, monethes, and of monethes yeares: as you make of farthings groates, of groates, ſhillings, and of ſhillings crownes.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  Tell me, I haue euer heard it called Day, all that time the Sun ſtandeth ouer the earth, &amp; not .xxiiij. houres as thou ſayſt.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  Marke that dayes be deuidedDay. into natural and artificial, and one turningNaturall. aboute of this Sphere in .xxiiij.Artificiall. houres is called a naturall day, in the whych is included day and night.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  This is a thing I neuer heard before, and I can not beleue, that when a man ſpeaketh of day, he ſhall include night.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  It is as I haue tolde thée, and euer whē you ſpeake of dayes in things naturall, you vnderſtand natural days,

and in things artificial, dayes artificial. Tel me, when thou aſkeſt thy Til man, ſéeing the yeare after thou haſt ſowen, a fielde of thy corne growing, how many dayes hath this corne ben a growing? and he aunſwereth .viij. or .x. doeſt thou vnderſtande by the day, onely the day alone, or the day and night together?
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  The day and the night.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  And when thou aſkeſt him, in how many dayes he ſowed it, what vnderſtandeſt thou by the day?
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  The day onely.

                  Sée then that in things naturall thou takeſt dayes naturall, and in things artificiall, dayes alike.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  Surely my ſoule thou haſt made me vnderſtand that I neuer did afore. Wher haſt thou learned ſo many goodly things?

                  Of experience, bicauſe I haue ſo long ben in thée, by the help of knowledge that thy ſenſes haue giuen me.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  Now I knowe how time is the meaſure of the motions of theſe things

of the world, but I would haue thée tel me better what the motions be.
               
               
                  Soul.
                  The motiō local, which is that, by which, things moue from one place to another: the motion of alteration, by the which one thyng goeth from one qualitie to an other, from heate to cold, or from youth to age: and the motion of quantitie, by the which, things be made of greater &amp; leſſe quantitie, increaſing or diminiſhing, thus to be borne and to die, called generation and corruption. But theſe be rather mutations, than mouings, bicauſe they be done in an inſtant, and ſéemes they can not be meaſured by time.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  How are theſe mouings meaſured with the mouing of heauen?
               
               
                  Soule.
                  Doeſt thou not ſée euidently of thy ſelf, that one goeth. 3. myle in an houre? how can he, vnleſſe his mouing be equall to the .xxiiij. part of the▪ mouing which the heauen maketh aboute the earth, but vnderſtand it of equalitie of duration? and as much is the one, as

the other, and not of diſtance &amp; length, for in them is no compariſon: and ſo is meaſured how much one is made greater, or leſſe than an other, and from the one to the other, as from ſick to hole, frō yong to olde, to the which mouings, be ſubiect theſe things generable and corruptible, which euer varie, &amp; none can be found, but y• is euer moued of one of theſe mouings. Thou thinkeſt yu ſtādeſt firme, &amp; yet thou moueſt euer in alteration, for thou groweſt cōtinually olde.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  I vnderſtand thée well.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  Therefore all worldly things they ſay be meaſured of time, which is as much to ſay, as ſubiect to mouing, y• is meaſured with the motion of heauē: which things hap not to things diuine and immortal, for not being neither generable, nor corruptyble, bicauſe they be no bodies, and by that can not be made leſſe or more quantitie, nor be chaunged, by reaſon that they be made of no beginning, which haue any contrarietie in them, as the Elementes,

of the which al natural things be made, can not be meaſured with time as they. Of the mouings that be chaūged from place to place I ſpeake not, for this belongeth only to bodies, &amp; I know thou haſt heard preached a thouſande times, that God and Aungels be not in place: but whē it is ſaid they be more here thā there, it is vnderſtanded, bicauſe they ſhewe more their operation there, than in other place, but not as they be compaſſed of our outward form of an other body, the which is proper to be in place, as all things be in this world.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  Then if I lament that the time hath made me olde of yong, being a bodie, why ſayſt thou I haue not reaſon?
               
               
                  Soule.
                  Bicauſe time as time is nothing, but in our cogitation. And therefore they ſay, that if there were not intellect humaine, there ſhold be no tyme, though there were a mouing of heauē: euen as thy yarde in thy ſhop, if thou diddeſt not vſe it as a meſure, it ſhould not be a yarde, but a trée: whereby

it foloweth, a yarde to be nothing but in our cogitation, &amp; as a yarde, can doe neither good nor hurt.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  Thou mightſt aſke my prentice if it can do hurt or no, yt ſo oft haue laid with it good blowes vpon him.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  This operation he doeth as a trée, as he is really, &amp; not as a yarde, &amp; ſo ſhold an other haue done, that ſerued not for a meaſure. Therefore if thou wouldeſt nedes lament, thou muſt do it of heauen, which with his mouing, maketh al things to varie, that be included within thē, of the which thou canſt not reaſonably doe it, bicauſe he with his mouing gendring all things, is y• cauſe why thou alſo art. And though it ſéemeth the cauſe why thou &amp; other decay, this commeth not principally of him, bicauſe his intētion is to maintaine this vniuerſal, but by reaſon yt he hath none other maner to make y• things whereof you be made, which goeth continually chaūging vnder diuerſe formes, &amp; therefore you wax old and finally decay. Yet

can you not lament for this of him that hath made you, being better to be of a matter corruptible, thā to be nothing at all, which thou oughtſt not to doe, for though thou arte mortall, thou arte vnited with me which am immortall, in ſuche ſort as I ſhall make thée alſo immortall, by the grace of him that hath created me &amp; ſent me vnto thée, when we ſhal riſe at y• day of the great iudgement. So ſée how euill thou doeſt to cō
                     playne of time, and perhaps the more, bicauſe thou art waxen olde, the age wherein thou now art, being no leſſe worthie to be eſtemed, or paraduenture better, than all they.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  To this I wil ſay thou art cunning, if thou cāſt make me vnderſtād it.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  I hope it ſhall not be hard for me to doe it, if thou wilt heare reaſon, and folow it as thou oughtſt. But it is now day, ariſe and go to thy buſineſſe, and as I ſhall ſée thée diſpoſed another time of theſe things, I will kéepe promiſe with thée.

               IVſt, O Iust, awake, for it is now time, &amp; complaine not this morning, that thyne age hath taken away thy ſléepe, for thou haſt ſlept this night as well, as when thou waſt a childe.
               
                  Iuſt.
                  O my Soule, thou ſaiſt truth, &amp; I am ſo comforted, y• me think I came but now to bed. But what is yt cauſe I haue ſlept better now thā I am wont? I pray thée tell me the cauſe if thou canſt.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  If I ſhould aunſwer thée, the diſpoſition of the heauen, which paraduenture now is in a being much appropriate to the temperature of thy complexion, thou mightſt aunſwer me, that this is y• aunſwere of y• ignorant, which not knowing the particular cauſes of things, bringeth forth euer vniuerſall, aūſwering to thē y• aſke thē, God &amp; the heauen wil haue it ſo. Wherefore comming to y• perticularitie wherwith our deſire is quieted, I ſay y• thy temperate

ſéeding hath ben the cauſe, which thou didſt vſe yeſternight, whereby the quā
                     titie of thy nutrimēt, not hauing ouercome the force of the heate, that ought to ſéeth it, there hath riſen in thée no trouble, &amp; euerie power hath ben able to doe his office liberally. So as if thou ſléepeſt not ſo other nights, the fault is many times of thy fragilitie, and not of thyne age, which as I haue ſayd vnto thée, doth not deſerue to be blamd more than the other which thou haſt paſſed.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  Wouldeſt thou make me vnderſtand, that olde age, which is the receipt of troubles, ſhould be good?
               
               
                  Soule.
                  I wil not make thée beleue any thing, but I will onely ſhew thée the truth, which thing I ſhall well doe this morning, bicauſe thou haſt ſo well repoſed thy ſelf, as thou art more hable to vnderſtande reaſon now, than when thou haſt by ſome accident altered thy humors, and troubled thy ſpirites.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  I wil heare thée with a good wil truely, for I know that of euery opiniō
                     
be it neuer ſo muche againſt reaſon, a man learneth ſomewhat. But I ſhall deſire thée, yt thou wilt not doe as they, whoſe purpoſe is only to perſuade, vſing all reaſon and coniecture, being neuer ſo falſe, ſo it haue any meane to obtaine their deſire.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  Doubt not of this, for I ſhuld doe thée too muche iniurie, and whome ſhould I deceiue but my ſelfe, being ſo vnited with thée, that muſt haue the ſame fortune?

                  Then thou ſhalt doe thy duetie, and when thou wouldeſt doe otherwiſe, I ſhould yelde a recompence contrary, and doe to thée, as he did to the frier maiſter of the reueſtrie in the Anuntiata, who wold haue bought a candle to haue offred to that image for a vowe, and the frier ſaying to him, take one of theſe that be here in the churche, and giue the mony which thou ſhouldſt ſpend, to the reueſtrie: then giuing him a bunche of candles in his hande, ſaid: take which thou wilt, and it ſhall be as

good as if thou hadſt euen now put it in the altare. The mā doing as y• frier bad him, ſaid: now touche you this purſe, wherin my money is, and it ſhal be euē as good vnto you, as if you had it, and ſo the one was euen with the other.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  Iuſt, let theſe toyes goe, for I tell thée certainly, that I ſhal make thée vnderſtand, yt olde age doth not deſerue to be blamed, nor called a worſe age, thā any of the other. And that thou mightſt better vnderſtand, mark what wants it hath, or wherof men do blame it, and I wil ſhew thée how much both thou and they be deceiued, for I otherwiſe could not defend it, not knowing any wāt in it. And whē I haue deliuered it of thoſe blames, then will I ſhew the praiſes of it, and I hope in the end, that it ſhall no leſſe pleaſe thée to be olde than yong.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  If ther wer none other thing but this, yt we olde men be not only litle eſtemed, but rather ſcorned of euery one, doſt yu not think yt old age is an il thing?
               
               
                  Soule.
                  Yes if it came of hir ſelf, but if

thou conſidereſt wel, to whom this happeneth, yu ſhalt ſée it procedeth not of old age, but of them ſelues, which hauing had little accōpt of their honor in their life, haue bene cauſe that mē giue them not that reuerēce yt they ought to haue, wherby if they be in litle reputation wt other, their behauior is the fault, &amp; not their age. So as if thou haſt none other cauſe to blame hir, this is worthe nothing, but rather diſcouereth what thy maners be, or haue ben, yt cauſeth their blame in their olde age.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  Yes I haue reaſōs too many, but bicauſe I ſée I cā neuer proue any with thée, I will not ſpeake them, but yelde to thée, and will alſo (if I can) force my ſelf to beleue thée, for if I could do ſo, it wer much to my cōfort, for ther is not a better thing in the world, thā for a man ſometime to deceiue himſelfe, thinking he is wiſe or faire, or ſuche like. And he that is in this caſe, enioyeth the world, without any care.

                  Yea, to fooles it hapneth ſo.

                  And haue not they pleaſaunt dayes alſo? Doſt thou not remember of our phyſitian of Florence, which a while was frantike fooliſhe, and being ſought vnto of a pore woman, to helpe a ſonne of hirs that was in like caſe, he anſwered: good woman I will not deale in it, for I ſhould doe him to muche wrong, for I neuer had ſo pleaſaunt time, asFoliſhneſſe. when I was ſo diſeaſed my ſelfe.

                  Let theſe reaſons goe, for they be not conuenient to our nature, and muche leſſe to thy age: and ſince thou wilt not ſpeake, heare me, for I wil not faile to doe that I haue promiſed.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  I ſhall gladly doe it, for it is ſo much betwixt this and day, that I ſhold be ſo idle, and that would irke me.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  Iuſt, I haue many times cōſidered with my ſelf y• al thoſe things wher by they blame olde age, (for thou knoweſt with old men the other do not much kéepe company, bicauſe they of one age, are euer glad to talke togither) may be reduced to foure cauſes that be principall

of all, and by the meane of age, reputed noyſome and grieuous of euery man.

                  Which be they?

                  The firſt is, that it maketh them vnméete to do things: y• ſecōd, it makes their body weak: the third, it depriueth them of pleaſures: the fourth, that he is nighe death.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  Thinkeſt thou then, that they blame it without cauſe?
               
               
                  Soule.
                  Yea ſure, and that thou maiſt know the truthe with thine errour, let vs firſt examine diligently this their opinion: and to begin with the firſt, tell me, what things be they whereunto a man is made more vnapt by age?
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  What be they? euen all.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  I would not haue thée ſay ſo, for thou art wrōg: but wilt thou know which they be, only they that be done by force, &amp; they be rather méete for beaſtes than for men, the greater parte of the which be made of greater force thā we be for our ſeruice, that they might

caſe vs of ſuperfluous trauaile, &amp; to vs ſhe hath giuen wit, to ſerue our ſelues with it. So if thou conſidereſt wel, thou ſhalt ſée that the greater parte of theſe operations, y• haue néede of much force, be things ſeruile, &amp; all wiſe men makes them to ſerue for thoſe turnes. But the great things which be of importance, be not done with force, but with councell &amp; wiſdome, of the which things olde age doth moſt abound.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  And what makeſt thou of Art of warre, thinkeſt thou that can be done without force?
               
               
                  Soule.
                  No, but in this, many times councell and prudence doeth more than force.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  Whom canſt thou make beleue that, that wher néede is to do, he is more profitable, that ſitteth &amp; ſaith nothing, than he, that beſtirreth his hands?
               
               
                  Soule.
                  All they that haue ſo muche knowledge, or become ſo prudent by experience of things, which knowe it is cléere, that it is much more hard well to

know how to commaund and gouerne, than to do well and obey. For ſtanding in this thy opinion, there ſhould folow that he were more profitable in a ſhip, that roweth, or hales, or ſpreade ſailes, thā the maſter that gouerns al, for they worke, and he ſtands and commaunds.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  What ſhould he doe, that commaundeth, if he had not that did obey?
               
               
                  Soule.
                  Fewer faultes a great deale, than they ſhould, if they had not one to commaund them: therfore if thou conſireſt wel, thou ſhalt ſée few cities maintained in felicitie, but y• be gouerned of old men. For although yong men ſomtime augmēt, yet cā they not maintain, for yong mē be caried with Wil, which in them is like the thirſt y• a great ague bringeth with it, whereby they ſuffer themſelues to be ouercome of loue, of anger, or of many other paſſions, which y• age hathe. And further, they be ſo ambitious &amp; deſirous of praiſe, that many times they aduēture inconſideratly vpon enterpriſes ſo hard and daungerous▪
                     
that they bring away no leſſe hurt than ſhame. And that that is worſe, they be cruel, and put hope in euery litle thing, they make little accompt of their owne, they import their ſecretes to euery mā, whereby it is an eaſie thing to deceiue them. The which thing hapneth not to olde men, which for their long experience, and for that they haue oft ben deceiued of things of the worlde, they put not ſo raſhly themſelues to perill, they tell not ſo eaſily their minde, they beleue little and hope leſſe. And bicauſe they haue learned how hard a thing it is to get riches, they caſt them not awaye as yong men doe, but make ſtore of thē, to haue when néede ſhall require.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  And ſo the moſt parte become couetous, berieuing them ſelues of that liberality, wherof there is nothing foūd ſo profitable for man, and chiefly to thē that ſhall gouerne other, for it cauſeth that men ſerue them for loue, and euery man knoweth that rule that is done by loue, is muche more ſure and durable,

than that is done by force.
               
               
                  Soul.
                  That thou thinkſt in yong mē liberalitie, is for the moſt part prodigalitie: for young men giue eaſily to them that praiſe them, or bring them any delight, where olde men bycauſe they are more prudente, and knowe things better, giue more to whom is conuenient: in the which thyng, liberalitie proprely cōſiſteth. So as thou ſéeſt howe much thou art deceiued, to ſay, that age maketh a man leſſe apt to do things, wher as it maketh them more experte and prudent, with the which vertues (as I ſayd before) only great affaires be done.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  Wel be it ſo as thou haſt ſaid, which in dede I wil not vtterly deny: for abiding of trauel is rather a thing of beaſts, than of men, to whom counſel and diſcourſe belongeth: wilt thou denie me, that old Age doth not bring wt it ſo many infirmities, as it ſo enfeebleth mans bodie, yt it is to be ſhoonned, and deſerues to be blamed.
               
               
                  
                  Soule.
                  All other ages doe the like, rather worſe than it. For thoſe infirmities that childhode and youth bringeth with it, be much more perillous. For they be more ſodaine and ſharpe, i

                      reſpecte of the humors and bloude, which be more, &amp; of greater force in yong men, than in olde.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  How wil you proue that?
               
               
                  Soule.
                  What néede I labor in it, for experiēce wil make thée certaine? ſéeſt thou not that there die more children than yong men, and how fewe they be that come to olde age?
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  Certainely in this thou haſte reaſon, for I do not beleue, that of thē y• be borne, two of the hundred comes to fiftie yeares.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  And wherof thinkeſt thou, cometh that, but that thoſe ages be ſubiect to more dangerous diſeaſes than olde age is?
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  I cā not tel, but this I ſée, there dieth ſo many yong, y• there remaines but a fewe olde.
               
               
                  
                  Soule.
                  Now thou telſt a pretie thing, muſt not all die at length?
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  Well I will graunt thée, that olde age hath not more of theſe daungerous infirmities, than hath any other age, but of certaine coughes, catarres, palſeis, and other diſeaſes which yong men haue not, and olde men be full: what ſayſt thou now?
               
               
                  Soule.
                  I ſay vnto thée, that they rather come of them ſelues, than of age.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  How ſo?
               
               
                  Soule.
                  If thou conſidereſt well the life of ſuche as now be, or haue bene in that age, thou ſhalt know it of thy ſelfe, for thou ſhalt finde them men, which either not cōſidering their age, and how leſſe their power is, to that they were yong, they wil drinke and eate as muche as they were wont, or peraduenture more, whereby nature for that occaſion not being hable to make diſgeſtion, genders in them that ſuperfluitie, that cauſeth theſe accidents: or elſe in their youth haue

made ſo many diſorders, yt they haue gotten theſe euyls, which ſhew them ſelues in age, whē they be more weak of nature: but an olde man that conſidereth well his vertue, howe muche and what it is, and liues orderly thervnto, eating and drynkyng onely ſo much as may reſtore his ſtrēgth, and not oppreſſe hym, would lyue muche more hole, than a yong mā. And thou knoweſt I haue many times taughte thée what way to vſe in it.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  Then if an olde man wyll be hole, he muſt marke ſo many things, as he ſhal loſe all his cōtentation: for ſo thou haſt confeſſed of thy ſelfe, that this other blame, whiche we gyue to this age, that it takes away all pleaſure, is not giuen for naught.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  Let vs procede in order, that thou maiſt ſe thou haſt not yet caught me. Doeſt thou not remember that that I haue ſaid an other time, that eating and drinkyng, and other thyngs cōming of ſome lack, be no pleaſures

but as a man hath néede, for when he is ſuffiſed, they be vnpleaſant to him.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  If theſe be no pleaſures, there be ynow of other, that are taken from hir, that ſhe may well be blamed, and without reſpect.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  Rather ought ſhe to be prayſed moſt, for if thou conſidereſt well, ſhe depriues only thoſe that be reprouable in other ages.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  That will not I graunte: for a man that can haue no pleaſure in the world, is as though he wer not.

                  True: but what vnderſtandeſt thou by pleaſure?

                  Thoſe delightes whyche the things of the world bring with them. Knoweſt thou not, that thou art like one born yeſterday, &amp; yet ther be many yeres ſince we firſt met together?

                  Of what thinkſt thou I meane?

of thoſe that we haue by faſting or labor, or waſting our ſelues with ſtudy as ſome fooles doe?
               
               
                  Soule.
                  Thou art much deceiued, rather I ſay vnto thée, that nature hath not giuen to men, as Archita the Tarentine
                     Pleaſures ſaid, (if thou remember of his life, for I know thou haſte red it ofte) a greater nor more hurtfull euil than pleaſure, and delight of the body.

                  Thou ſayeſt ſo perhaps, bicauſe the leaſt parte is thine.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  Rather, bicauſe the truthe is ſo, wherof comes for the moſte parte, treaſons of the Countrey, ruines of cities, enimities of men, &amp; other wickedneſſe, murders, rauine of richeſſe and adulteries, but of volupt and delight? which ſo muche blinde men with their entiſement and alluring, that taking from them the vſe of reaſon, they he turned into beaſtes.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  O reaſon, yet it feareth not them, as thou doeſt ſay.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  There is no ſuche enimie as

pleaſure, which of good reaſō was called of wiſe mē, the bait of al euil. For where the ſenſes rule, reaſon hath no place, no vertue is foūd in them that be giuen to the pray of their gorge, to wine, to ſléepe, &amp; thoſe idleneſſe, of the which groweth among vs, a thouſand vaine and vnprofitable cares, which kepe vs alwaies after with our face to the earthe, like the brute beaſtes which lacke reaſon. Thinkeſt thou then, that age is to be blamed, when ſhe defends vs from greater enimies▪ taking from them that force, wherewith they offende?
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  If it were as thou ſayeſt: but graunt there is one man that hath no pleſure, is not he in déede, as he were not aliue, or as a thing wtout ſenſe?

                  Yes. But ſhe takes not all alwayes from men, but only thoſe that be common with other beaſtes.

                  If I ſhold always be occupied in like things after thée, my ſeruitude ſhold be too great: thou knoweſt ſomtime I would haue ſome comfort.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  I wil not denie thée it, ſo that thou paſſe not reaſonable termes: but I will ſay vnto thée, that delight that is taken in eating and drinking, and talking withthy frends, is much more acceptable to olde age, than to the other ages.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  What is the cauſe?
               
               
                  Soule.
                  Bicauſe there is in olde men more moderate appetite, they fall not into dronkenneſſe, or any other alteration of the minde, as yong men do, (which haue their willes diſordinate) if they haue not in their youth, made

thē ſelues worſe. Further they know to reaſon of more things and better, by the meane of time and experience, and better enioye the conuerſation of men, &amp; with much more ſwéeteneſſe imbrace the preſence of them, than yong men do. For of their péeres they be honoured, and of their leſſe they be reuerenced. Whiche thyng bryngs them no ſmall delight.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  If they haue ſéene many things they remember few, bicauſe memory in that age diminiſheth much.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  Yea, in them that exerciſe it not, which is a vice of maner, not of age, as in many of them to be ſuſpicious, to be couetous, tedious, prayſer of time paſt, eſtemer of himſelf more than other, and other like wants: but when ſhe loſeth any of hir ſtrength, there increaſeth ſo much for it in wit and iudgement, that they ſupply fully for hir the fruits, which bring much more pleaſure to olde men, than doth armure, horſſes, huntings, daunces,

and ſuch other that delites yōg men. Of the pleaſures of 
                        Ʋenus I will not reaſon, ſéeing ther is nothing cauſeth more errors in mā than it. But theſe things that I ſpeake Iuſt, come not to all olde men, but to them only, that haue ſo liued in other ages, that their reputation and yeres haue encreaſed in them a like.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  Which be they, tell me?
               
               
                  Soule.
                  The greater parte, that thou ſholdeſt not think they wer as white crowes, for who ſo euer liueth in any age, though not all, yet in part according to reaſon, (not being poſſible, but he that is a man, muſt erre ſomtime) ſo the errors he make, be comportable, he is excuſed of the moſt parte of men, &amp; that age after of hir ſelfe bringeth him ſuch authoritie and reputatatiō, that he is honored of euery one, and the firſt place giuen him in euery aſſembly. And to this is memory alſo ioyned, and remembraunce, yt he hath

liued ciuilly, and like an honeſt man, which thing is more worthe, than all the pleaſures of any age.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  Wel I wil proue thy opinion in this, for I know the pleſure I haue had ſome time, when I haue ſéene my ſelfe honored for mine age ſake. But to the other, that more importeth thā all the reſt, what ſayeſt thou?
               
               
                  Soule.
                  What is that?
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  That we be nigh death.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  It is true that the terme and ende of olde age is death, where naturally to the other ages it haps not ſo: the ende of childhode is youth, the end of youth middle age, the ende of middle age, olde age. Neuertheleſſe there is none of all theſe ages can promiſe them ſelues life one pore day. Rather be they more, (as I ſaide vnto thée,) that die in the other ages, than they that be olde, bicauſe of the multitude of great perrils, that doe chaunce in life?
               
               
                  
                  Iuſt.
                  Then an olde man is certain to die, and ſoone, where a yong man may at leaſt hope to be olde.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  The olde man hath poſſeſſed that the yong hopeth for.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  What helpes to haue lyued, ſeing tyme paſt is not?
               
               
                  Soule.
                  That that makes ye hope of the time to come, whiche is to come: but what is .xv. or .xx. yeres more or leſſe, ſeing we muſt nedes die, nothyng remaining vnto vs of things gotten in time, but onely the acts of vertue?
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  What is xv. or .xx. yere? O my ſoule, thou ſhe weſt to haue taſted but a little, howe pleaſant thyng it is to lyue?
               
               
                  Soule.
                  Thou ſéemeſt not to know: for if thou haddeſt conſydered well the thyngs that haps in euery age, thou ſhouldeſt finde there be many more that it diſpleaſeth, than pleaſeth: and that a man muſte ſtriue with ſo many things, as our life hath bene wellLife, a Warfare. heretofore called, a continuall warfare.

But let vs goe further Iuſt: If death be to be feared, they ought onely to feare, that by death thinke they ſhall ceaſe to be, which is deſired and loued ſo much of all creatures, or to them that doubt to go to worſe, neyther of the which ought to be in thee, thou being a chriſtian man.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  And what certaintie haue I, not to loſe my being vtterly, when I ſhall die?
               
               
                  Soule.
                  None of thy ſelfe, thou canſt not thinke otherwiſe, beyng by thy propre nature mortal, and ſeyng that all other things lyke vnto thée, muſte decay and die: but I ſay vnto thee, that whē that time determined, ſhal come, appointed by God, I that am immortall, ſhal be revnited with thée, wherby thou ſhalt riſe with me by y• grace of the immortal God, voide of trouble and clere from all qualitie, that now cauſeth thée to chaunge euery day to an other, which in the end ſhall cauſe me to be ſeparate from thée, whereof

ſhall come thy death.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  What certaintie haſte thou of this?
               
               
                  Soule.
                  That that excéedeth and paſſeth all other, the light of faith.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  And that light thou ſpeakeſt of paſſeth the certaintie of things, by meane of ſcience. I haue heard ſay that ſcience is nothing but a certaintie.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  It paſſeth farre, for ſciences be the inuentions of men, which may erre, rather it neuer doeth thing, but there is founde in it ſome imperfection,Faith. and the light of truth commeth or God, which is the high and vnſpeakeable veritie. But I wil not bring thée more reaſons for this, we hauing ſo many times red together, that diuine treatiſe that Ierome made, intituled the Triumphe of Faith, where is proued of him, all this that I haue ſaid, ſo as he that hathe redde, and doeth not beléeue, may ſay, either he vnderſtandes not, or elſe is obſtinate

in his opinion. Therefore lament no more Iuſt, that thou arte olde, for feare of ſhort life, for if we be nigh deathe, we be nighe the ende of our Pilgrimage, &amp; at the terme to arriue in our countrey, and porte of our ſaluation.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  I haue many times heard this, that we heere be Pilgrimes, and that this is not our Countrey: and yet it ſéemes very harde to me, to thinke I ſhall departe.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  This is full well knowen to me: for the ende which I ſhew thée, and to the which thou arte ordained by my occaſion, doth paſſe and excéede thy nature: But ſuffer thy ſelfe to be guided of me, and let vs diſpoſe all our buſineſſe, that when it ſhal pleaſe him that gouernes all things, to looſe this bande, let it grieue thée as little as may be, hauing a ſure hope, to be vnited wyth me againe, in a farre better ſtate, and I reioyce to returne to my maker. Therfore complaine no

more Iust of thy age, for none of theſe cauſes, wherefore thou blameſt hir, hath place in vs, bycauſe we be ſure (as I haue ſayd) to go to a better life.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  Well, I will do all thou ſayſt, and in all things put my ſelfe to thy will, without makyng any more accompte of my will: for I thinke that we hauing ſo long ben together, thou haſt ought me ſo great loue, that thou wouldeſt not counſell me but to my good.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  Now it ſéemes thou knoweſt thy weale: for of our diſcorde ſhould come the euil of both vs. Therfore let vs apply to liue together in the loue of God, and lette vs euer hold before our eyes theſe three things. The firſt, that God was made man, to aduance the nature of man to thys dignitie, that mā might be made God. The ſecond, that he hath bene willing to dye to ſatiſfie and pay the pain of our debtes, we not being apt nor ſufficient to do it, being made his enimies, through

the fault of our firſt father. The third is, that we be mortall: wherefore the two firſt, like to ſpurres of loue, doe make vs to goe chearefully to the vttermoſt of our power, throughe his moſt holy law, for he ſhould be very hard, that would not be kindled with the loue of Chriſt Iesu our ſauiour, if he conſider he was made man for vs, and after died for our ſinnes. The thirde ſhall be a bridle of feare, that ſhall not ſuffer vs to goe from his will. And though by the infirmitie of nature, we commit ſometime ſome fault, it will make vs ſtraight tourne to him, and humbly aſke him pardon. For they only be bleſſed, whoſe ſinnsBleſſed. (as Dauid ſaith) be remitted of him.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  How ſhal we be heard of him, I remember I haue red in the ſcripture, God heareth not the voyce of a ſinner.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  We ſhall no longer be ſinners, as ofte as we ſhall tourne to

God, and run to him with true faith, ſeing ſinne is nothing elſe, but to take our face from God, and tourne it to his creatures. But if we turne vs to Chriſt with all our heart, truſting that he hath ſatiſfied for all our defectes, as a very mediator, and our Sauiour, it ſhall folow that we ſhall be vnited with him as with our head, in ſuche ſorte by loue, that we ſhall become his members, whereby we ſhall euer worke, after his will. For as the eye, although it be an eye, ſhold not ſée, nor the tongue, although it be a tongue, ſhould not ſpeake if it were not vnited with the heade, which giueth them ſtrength to work, ſo we Chriſtians alſo, although we be chriſtians ſhould neuer worke as we ought, if we were not vnited with Chriſt our head, which graūteth vs by his grace to do it. Of the which vnion riſeth, that his merites alſo ſhall come downe into vs, and we ſhall couer our faultes with his innocencie,

whereby going after ſo, before the Tribunall of God, he ſhal ſay after the manner of the greate Patriarke Iſaac, of vs, although the voyce be of Iacob, that is of ſinners, yet the members, that is their works be of Eſau, that is of my firſt begottē ſonne, whereby he ſhall giue vs his benediction, and in the ende the heritage of God.
               
               
                  Iuſt.
                  Thou haſt giuen ſuche a conſolation this morning my Soule, that (as I ſayd to thee before) I let my ſelfe héereafter be guided of thée, and apply me to all that thou doeſt counſel me, for ſo I know is for my weale clearely.
               
               
                  Soule.
                  God of whome commeth all our good, long maintaine thée in this purpoſe.
               
               Riſe therfore, for ſée it is day, and high is the ſunne, and goe in his name to doe thy exerciſes, bearing in pacience that that comes, neuer lamenting more of any thing: for all that

that foloweth, doth folow by his wil: nor he will neuer ſuffer that anye thing ſhall fall vpon vs, aboue our ſtrength, and that we ſhall not be able to beare, bicauſe he deſireth much more our ſaluation than our ſelues.
            
            FINIS.
