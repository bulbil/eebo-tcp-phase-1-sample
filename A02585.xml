            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

            TO MY MVCH
HONOR'D FREND
Sr HENRY BAKER
Knight &amp; Baronet.
            
               SIR,
            
            
               AMongst many
to whom my
poore labonrs
owe much for
their acceptation,
I know none that can
challenge ſo deepe a debt as

your ſelfe. If others haue
taſted of my well-meant papers,
you haue fed heartily
on them; and ſo made them
your owne, that your memorie
may compare with others
eyes, and your practiſe
with the ſpeculation of others:
Neither haue your
hand or tongue bin niggardly
diſſemblers of your ſpirituall
gaine. Vnto you therefore
(to whoſe name I had long
ſince in my deſires deuoted
my next) do I ſend this meane
preſent: A Sermon importunately

deſired of many:
That which the preſent Auditors
found vſefull, the
Preſſe ſhall communicate to
poſteritie; The gaine of either,
or both is no leſſe mine:
I doubt not but you haue already
ſo acted that part of
this diſcourſe which concerneth
you, that the direction I
giue to others is but an hiſtorie
of what you haue done.
And go on happily (worthy
Sir) in thoſe your holy courſes
which ſhall lead you to
immortalitie; and ſo vſe

your riches that they may be
made vp into a crowne for
your head in a better world:
My hearty well-wiſhes ſhall
not be wanting to you, and
your vertuous Lady, as whom
you haue obliged to be iuſtly
            
               Worceſter Aprill 14.
               
               Yours
Jos. HALL.
            
         
      
      
         
            
            
               1 TIM. 6. 17.
               Charge them that are rich in this
world, that they be not high minded,
nor truſt in vncertaine riches, but
in the liuing God, who giueth vs
richly all things to enioy. &amp;c.
            
            
               THOSE things which
are excellent, and
beneficiall in their
vſe, are dangerous
in their miſcariage:
It were loſt labour for me to
perſwade you how good riches
are: your paines and your cares

are ſufficient proofes of your
eſtimation; And how deadly
the abuſe of them is, many a
ſoule feeles that cannot returne
to complaine; There is nothing
more neceſſarie therefore, for a
Chriſtian heart, than to be rectified
in the menaging of a proſperous
eſtate; and to learne ſo
to be happy here, that it may be
more happy hereafter; A taske
which this Text of ours vndertakes,
and (if yee be not wanting
to it and your ſelues) will be ſure
to performe: What ſhould I
neede to intreat your attention
(Right Honorable, right Worſhipfull,
and beloued) to a buſines
ſo neerely concerning you?
The errand is Gods; the vſe of it
yours.
            
               
I neuer held it ſafe to pull
Scripture in peeces: Theſe
words fall alone into their parts.
Timothy is ſet vpon the ſpirituall
Bench, and muſt giue the charge.
A charge, to whom? Of what?
To whom? To the rich: Of
what? what they muſt auoide,
what they muſt indeuour: What
muſt they auoide? Hy-mindedneſſe,
&amp; Truſt in wealth: What
are the duties they muſt labour
vnto? Confidence in God; Beneficence
to men: And euery
one of theſe is backed with a
reaſon to inforce it: Why ſhould
they not be hy-minded? Their
wealth is but in this world;
Why ſhould they not truſt in
Riches? They are vncertaine.

Why ſhould they truſt in God?
He is a liuing God, and a liberall
God: Why ſhould they extend
their beneficence to men? By
this they lay vp to themſelues a
ſure foundation: Here is worke
enough you ſee for my diſcourſe,
and your practiſe: The
God of heauen bleſſe it in both
our hands.
            
               Charge hath (Ianus-like) a double
aſpect;Charge one that lookes vp
to S. Paul, the other that lookes
downe to Timothy, and from
him, to the rich: In the firſt
there is Apoſtolicall ſuperiority;
for (
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               ) Charge thou, referres
to 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                verſe 13. I Charge
thee; ſo Paul charges Timothy to
charge the rich; He that giues

the Charge, if he be not the
cheife of the Bench, yet hee is
greater than the Iurie; The firſt
foundation of the Church is
laid in an inequalitie; and hath
euer ſince ſo continued; There
can be no harmonie where all
the ſtrings or voices are of one
tenour; In the latter, as it looks
on Timothy, it carries in it Epiſcopall
power, Euangelicall ſufficiencie:
Epiſcopall power; for
this Charge is by the vulgar
turn'd, and the Tranſlation of
the Syriac, Praecipe, command;
and ſo doe we tranſlate it in the
firſt of this Epiſtle, and the third
verſe; Timothy was left at Epheſus
(
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               ) to command.
            The rich are commonly great;

Nobilitie in the account of God
is ioyned with wealth; Curſe not
the King in thy thought, nor the Rich
in thy Bed-chamber, ſaith Salomon;
ſo Diues at whoſe gates Lazarus
lay is by ſome no meane ones
gueſſed to be Herod,
               Maldona
                     •
                   could incline to that. in locum.
                or ſome
other King; and ſo are Iobs
freinds termd by the ſeuenty▪
Yea the rich is not onely a litle
King amongſt his neighbours,
but Diues, quaſi Diuus; as a petty
God to his vnderlings, and yet
euen the rich man that (as Salomon
notes) ſpeakes with command
vnto others, he muſt be
ſpoken to with command. Command
the rich. That fooliſh
ſhaueling ſoared too hye a pitch,
when in his imperious Bull he

mands the Angels: Francis of
Aſsiſe and hee, were both of a
Diet; But we may ſafely ſay that
all powers below the Angels, are
liable to our ſpirituall Charge;
and this Command implies obedience;
Els, to what purpoſe
doe we command and go without?
Chriſt gaue vs the keyes;
(for that which the Romaniſts
would plead out of Origen, of Claues
coeli, The keyes of heauen to the
reſt, and Claues coelorum, The keyes
of the heauens to Peter is a diſtinction
without a difference);
What becomes of them? That
I may not ſay on ſome of our
hands they are ſuffered to ruſt
for want of vſe; on others, (as
the Pontificians) the wards are

altered, ſo as they can neither
open nor ſhut; Sure I am that
(if they be not loſt on our behalfe
whether in diſ-vſe, or
abuſe) the power of them is loſt
in the hearts of many: They
haue ſecret pick-locks of their
owne making, Preſumption and
ſecuritie, wherby they can open
heauen gates though double
locked by our cenſures, and ſhut
the gates of hell at pleaſure,
which their owne ſinnes haue
opened wide to receiue them;
What vſe is there of vs, but in
our chayre? and there, but to be
heard, and ſeene? Euen in this
ſenſe ſpectaculo facti ſumus; we
are to gaze on, not to imploy:
Now yee are full, now yee are

rich, yee raigne as Kings without
vs; we are weake, yee are
ſtrong; yee are honorable, but
wee are deſpiſed; It was well
noted by one, that the good father
of the prodigall, though he
might himſelfe haue brought
forth the prime robe; or haue
led his ſonne into his wardrobe
to take it, yet he commands his
ſeruants to bring it forth (Proferte
ſtolam) becauſe he would
bring meanes into credit; becauſe
he would haue his ſonnes
beholden to his ſeruants for
their glory. It is a bold word,
but a true one, Yee ſhall neuer
weare the long white robe, vnleſſe
his ſeruants your miniſters
bring it, and put it on. He that

can ſaue you without vs, will
not ſaue you but by vs: He hath
not tyed himſelfe to meanes,
man he hath; He could create
you immediatly to himſelfe, but
hee will haue you begotten by
the immortall ſeed of your ſpirituall
fathers: Woe be to you
therefore, if our word haue loſt
the power of it in you: you
haue loſt your right in heauen:
Let vs neuer come there if you
can come thither ordinarily
without vs. The words of the
wife (ſaith Salomon) are like
goades, like nayles; But if theſe
goades light vpon the skin of a
Leuiathan, who eſteemes yron
as ſtraw, and braſſe as rotten
wood; If theſe nayles meete

with yron, or marble in their
driuing, that they turne againe;
What ſhall we ſay but our Goſpell
is hid to them that periſh; and woe
vnto your ſoules,
               Eſ. 3. 9. 
               for yee haue rewarded
euill to your ſelues.
            
            Hitherto the power implyed
in this charge; the ſufficiencie
followeth: This Euangelicus
muſt be parangelicus; Like as the
fore-runner of Chriſt had a
charge for all ſorts, ſo muſt his
followers; So hath Timothy in
this Epiſtle, A charge for wiues,
for Biſhops, for Deacons, for
widdowes, for ſeruants, and here
for the rich; He muſt charge;
and how ſhall he charge, if hee
haue neither ſhot nor powder?
It is no brag to ſay that no Nation

vnder heauen ſince the
Goſpell lookt forth into the
world, euer had ſo many, ſo
learned teachers as this ILAND
hath at this day. Hierom ſaid of
old to his Paulinus, De Hieroſôlymis
&amp; de Britannia aequaliter patet
aula coeleſtis; Heauen is as open in
Britayne as in Hieruſalem; It holds
well if you take it for a propheticall
compariſon betwixt Ieruſalem
as it had beene, and Britayne
as it ſhould be: Ieruſalem the type
of Gods Church vpon earth, in
the glory of all her legall magnificence
was neuer more bleſſed,
then this Church of ours:
For the Northerne part of it beyond
the Twede, we ſaw not, we
heard not of a Congregation

(whereof indeed there is not ſo
great frequence) without a
preaching Miniſter;Somewhat aboue eight hundred. and though
their maintenance hath beene
generally but ſmall, yet their
paines haue been great, and their
ſucceſſe ſutable: And now lately,
his ſacred Maieſtie in his laſt
yeares iourney (as if the ſunne
did out of compaſſion goe beyond
his Tropick line, to giue
heate vnto the Northerne climate)
hath ſo ordered it, that
their meanes ſhall be anſwerable
to their labours; ſo as both Paſtors
and people profeſſe themſelues
mutually bleſſed in ech
other; and bleſſe GOD and
their KING for this bleſſednes:
As for the learning and ſufficiencie

of thoſe Teachers (whether
Prelates or Presbyters) our
eares were for ſome of them
ſufficient witneſſes, and wee are
not worthy of our eares, if our
tongues do not thankfully proclaime
it to the world. As for
this Southerne part, when I cōſider
the face of our Church in an
vniuerſalitie, mee thinks I ſee the
firmament in a cleare night, beſpangled
with goodly ſtarres of
all magnitudes, that yeeld a pleaſing
diuerſitie of light vnto the
earth; But withall, through the
incōparable multitude of Cures,
and the incompetent prouiſion
of ſome, we cannot but ſee ſome
of our people (eſpecially in
the vtmoſt skirts) like to thoſe

that liue vnder the Southerne
pole, where the ſtars are thinner
ſet; &amp; ſome ſtars there are in our
Hemiſphere, like thoſe litle ſparkles
in the Galaxy, or Milky circle,
wherein yee can ſcarſe diſcerne
any light; The deſire of our
hearts muſt be that euery Congregatiō,
euery ſoule might haue
a Timothie to deliuer the charge
of God powerfully vnto it; euen
with S. Pauls change of note;
That euery one which hath a
charge were (
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               ) able to giue
the charge; and euery hearer
(
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               ) ready to take it:
Wherein I cannot but thankfully
congratulate the happines of
this famous Citie, which if in
other riches it equalize the beſt,

I am ſure in this it exceeds all.
There is not a Citie vnder the
cope of heauen ſo wealthy in the
ſpirituall prouiſion; yea there
are whole countreyes in Chriſtendome,
that haue not ſo many
learned Preachers, as are
within theſe walls and liberties;
Heare this, yee Citizens, and be
not proud, but thankful; Others
may exceede you in the glory of
outward ſtructure, in the largeneſſe
of extent, in the vniforme
proportion of ſtreets, or ornaments
of Temples, but your pulpits
do ſurpaſſe theirs; &amp; if preaching
can lift vp Cities vnto
heauen, yee are not vpon earth;
Happy is it for you if yee be as
well fed as taught, and woe be

to you if you do not thinke your
ſelues happy.
            Charge then,The Rich▪
                but whom?
The rich: Man that came naked
out of the wombe of the earth,
was euen then ſo rich, that all
things were his; Heauen was
his roofe or Canopy, earth his
floore, the ſea his pond, the Sun
and Moone his torches, all creatures
his vaſſals: And if he loſt
the fulnes of this lordſhip by being
a ſlaue to ſinne, yet we haue
ſtill Dominium gratificum, as Gerſon
termes it; Euery ſonne of Abraham
is heire of the world:Rom. 4. 13. But
to make vp the true reputation
of wealth (for thus, we may be
as hauing all things, and poſſeſſing
nothing) another right is

required beſides ſpirituall,
which is a ciuill and humane
right; wherein I doubt not but
our learned Wiclef, and the famous
Archbiſhop of Armach,
and the more famous Chancelor
of Paris (three renowmed Diuines
of England, France, and Ireland
haue had much wrong,
whiles they are accuſed to teach,
that men in theſe earthly things
haue no tenure but grace, no title
but Charitie:Titulū Charitatis Dom. à Soto de Iuſtitia &amp; Iure. which queſtionleſſe
they intended in foro interiori,
in the Conſiſtory of God,
not in the Common-pleas of
men; in the Courts, not of Law,
but of Conſcience; in which
onely it may fall out, that the
Ciuill owner may be a ſpirituall

vſurper, and the ſpirituall owner
may be a ciuill begger. God
frames his language to ours, and
ſpeaking according to that Ius
Gentium, whereon the diuiſion
of theſe earthly poſſeſſions are
grounded, hee calls ſome Rich,
others, poore: Thoſe hereticks
which called themſelues Apoſtolique
(as ſome body doth
now at Rome) before the time
of Epiphanius &amp; Auguſtine, which
taught the vnlawfulnes of all
earthly proprieties; ſeconded
in Auſtens time, by our country-man
Pelagius, and in our times
by ſome of the illuminate Elders
of Munſter; are not worth confutation;
or, if they were, our
Apoſtle hath done it to our

hands, in this one word, Rich;
for there can be neither Rich
nor poore in a communitie;
Neither doth he ſay, Charge men
that they be not rich, but Charge the
rich that they be not hye-minded.
            
            With theſe, let vs couple our ignorant
Votaries, that place holineſſe
in want; with whom, their
very croſſes cannot deliuer their
coyne from ſinne; which, to
make good the old rule, that it
is better to giue then to receiue,
giue all they haue away at once,
for but a licence to begge for
euer. Did theſe men euer heare
that the Bleſſing of God maketh
rich? That the wings of riches
carry them vp to heauen? That
the crowne of the wiſe is their

wealth? Doe they not know
that if Lazarus were poore, yet
Abraham was rich, and Pium pauperem
ſuſcepit ſinus diuitis; It was
the happines of poore Lazarus
that he was lodged in the boſome
of rich Abraham. I am
no whit afraid, (ô yee rich Citizens)
leaſt this paradoxe of our
holy Mendicants ſhall make
you out of loue with your
wealth; I feare ſome of you
would be rich, though ye might
not; Now wee tell you from
him, whoſe title is Rich in mercy,
that yee may be at once Rich
and holy; In diuitijs cupiditatem
reprehendit, non facultatem ſaith Auſten:
It is a true word of the
ſonne of Sirach, which I would

haue you carry home with you,
and write it as a fit Motto, in
your Counting-houſe; Bona est
ſubſtantia, ſi non ſit peccatum in conſcientia;
Subſtance doth well in the
hand, if there be not euill in the heart.
Eccleſiaſticus 13. 25.
            
            
               Charge the Rich; Who are they?
There is nothing wherein is
greater meſpriſon. One man
in a Laodicean conceitednes
thinks himſelfe rich, when he
hath nothing; Another, in a
couetous humor thinks he hath
nothing, when he is rich; and
how eaſie is it for another man
to miſtake vs, if we may thus
eaſily miſtake our ſelues? I feare
ſome of you are like the Pageants
of your great ſolemnities,

wherein there is the ſhow of a
ſolid body, whether of a Lyon,
or Elephant, or Vnicorne, but
if they be curiouſly look't into,
there is nothing but cloth, and
ſticks, and ayre; Others of you
contrarily are like a diſſembling
Couent, that profeſſes pouerty, &amp;
purchaſes Lordſhips; The very
ſame did Salomon obſerue in his
time, in the great Burgomaſters
of Ieruſalem Pro. 13. 7. For the
auoyding of both extremes, let
vs inquire who is rich. And tho
greatnes and riches be in the
ranke of thoſe things, which are
held to haue no abſolute determination,
but conſiſt rather in
reſpect &amp; compariſon (for a rich
Farmer is yet poore to a rich

Merchant, and a rich Merchant
is but poore to a Prince, and he
to ſome great Emperor; That
great Mammoniſt would ſay
he is rich that can maintaine an
Armie, a poore man would ſay
according to that Italian inſcription,
He is rich that wants not
bread); Yet certainly there are
certaine generall ſtakes and
bounds, which diuide betwixt
pouerty and competence, betwixt
competency and wealth;
As there were variety of ſhekels
among the Iewes, yet there was
one ſhekell of the Sanctuarie
that varied not; Who then is
rich? I muſt giue you a double
anſwer; One will not ſerue; The
one according to true moralitie,

the other according to vulgar
vſe: In the firſt he is rich that
hath enough, whether the world
thinke ſo or not; Euen Eſau tho
he were poore in grace, yet in
eſtate he was rich, I haue enough
my brother; And he that ſaid,
Soule thou haſt goods enow for many
yeares, was almoſt ſo; It was
not his fault that he thought he
had enough, but that he meant
to lye downe, and wallow in it.
A mans wealth or pouertie is
moſt-what in himſelfe; And
though nature haue profeſſed
to read vnto heathen men this
leſſon of wiſe moderation, yet it
hath beene ſeldome ſeene that
any thing but true piety, hath
taught them to take it out; Godlineſſe

is great gaine with contentment:
Victus &amp; veſtitus diuitiae Chriſtianorum,
ſaith Hierom: Food and
rayment are the Chriſtians
wealth; Thoſe men therefore,
which are ſtill in the horſe
leeches note, ſucking and crauing;
which like Pharaohs leane
kine are euer feeding, and neuer
the fatter, are as farre from true
wealth, as they would be from
pouertie, and further I am ſure
they cannot be, and not further
from wealth then godlineſſe;
Hauing is the meaſure of outward
wealth, but it is thinking
that muſt meaſure the inward;
thoughts, I ſay, of contentment,
cheerefullnes, and thankfulnes,
which if yee want, it is not either

or both the Indyes that can
make you rich.
            In the latter, he is rich that
hath more then enough, whether
he thinke ſo or no▪ He
that hath the poſſeſſion (whether
ciuill, or naturall) of more
then neceſſarie: Now if neceſſarie
and ſuperfluous ſeeme as
hard to define as rich; know
there are iuſt limits for both
the
                  •••
                Superfluous is defined by
neceſſarie; for what is 
                  〈◊〉
               
neceſſarie, is ſuperfluous: There
is then a double neceſſarie; One
of nature, the other of eſtate:
That is neceſſarie to nature
without which we cannot liue,
that to eſtate, without which we
cannot liue well: That is neceſsarie

to eſtate, which were ſuperfluous
to nature; and that
which were ſuperfluous to nature,
is not ſo much as neceſsary
to eſtate; Nature goes ſingle,
and beares litle breadth; Eſtate
goes euer with a traine; The
neceſſitie of nature admits litle
difference, eſpecially for quantities;
the neceſſitie of eſtate requires
as many diuerſities, as
there are ſeuerall degrees of humane
conditions, and ſeuerall
circumſtances in thoſe degrees.
Iuſtly therefore doe the Scholemen
and Caſuiſts teach, that this
neceſsarie to the decencie of
eſtate doth not confiſt in puncto
indiuiduo, but hath much latitude;
That is neceſſarie to ſcarlet,

which to ruſſet were ſuperfluous;
that is but neceſſarie to a
Nobleman, which to an Eſquire
were ſuperfluous; That were

                  ••
               pe
                  •
               fluous to a Pere, which to a
Prince is but neceſſary: That is
neceſſary to the father of a familie,
which to a ſingle man were
ſuperfluous: Neither doth this
neceſſitie looke onely to the preſent,
but to the future; not to
what may be (which were an
endleſſe proſpect) but to what
muſt be, the mariage of a daughter,
the education of a ſonne,
the honeſt prouiſion for poſteritie:
He that in a iuſt eſtimate
can goe beyond the bounds of
this neceſsary, enters into the
ſuperfluous eſtate, and may

well paſſe with the world for
rich.
            Such a one is rich; let him
looke how he became ſo: That
God which can allow you to be
rich, will not allow you alwaies
to your wealth: He hath ſet vp
a golden goale, to which hee
allowes you all to runne, but
yee muſt keepe the beaten rode
of honeſtie, iuſtice, charity, and
truth; if yee will leaue this
path, and will be croſſing ouer
a ſhorter cut through by-wayes
of your owne, yee may be rich
with a vengeance. The heathen
Poet (one of them whom S. Paul
cited) could obſerue (
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               )
which Salomon tranſlates
to vs Prou. 28. 20.Menander. 
               He that

makes haſt to be rich ſhall not be innocent.
If you haue filled your
bags with fraud, vſury, extortion,
this gaine may be hony in
your mouth, but it will be grauell
in your throat, and poyſon
in your ſoule: There are ſome
meanes of wealth in an ill name,
as thoſe two truſty ſeruants of
Mammon, vſe and brocage;
there are others as bad as they,
litle ſaid to: Since I ſpeake to
Citizens, let mee be bold to ſay,
there is not ſo errand vſury in
letting of money, as in ſale of
wares. This oppreſſion is both
more, &amp; more vniuerſall. There
are two maximes that doe vſually
miſ-lead men of Trafique,
all the world ouer; The one i,

               Res valet quanti vendi potest, A
thing is worth what it may be
ſold for; The other, Caueat emptor,
At the buyers perill: The
one is in regard of the price, the
other in regard of the qualitie of
the wares. In the firſt, whereas
our Caſuiſts haue ſet three
prices, low, meane, rigorous,
they ſuper adde a fourth, exceſſiue;
and thinke they may lawfully
get what they can: Whereas
they ſhall once finde, that as
the rigorous price is a ſtraine of
charity, ſo the exceſſiue is a violation
of iuſtice; neither doth
this gaine differ ought from
theft, but that it is honeſted by a
faire cozenage. In the ſecond;
It matters not how defectiue the

meaſure be, how vicious the
ſubſtance, how falſe the kinde,
let this be the buyers care; No
man is bound to buy, no man
can do wrong to himſelfe; Such
wares muſt be put off, (perhaps
not to cuſtomers) with concealment
of faults, if not with proteſtations
of faultleſnes. In Salomons
time, It is naught, it is naught
ſaid the buyer, &amp; when he was gone
apart, he boaſted; But now, It is
good, it is good, ſaith the ſeller, and
when the buyer is gone, he boaſteth
of his deceit. Let mee appeale
to your boſomes, if theſe
two, Exceſſe of price, and Deficiency
of worth haue not beene
the moſt ſeruiceable factors to
bring in ſome of your wealth;

And let me tell you, if theſe be
guilty of your gaines, you may
miſ-name your trades, Myſteries,
but ſure theſe tricks are myſteries
of iniquitie. It were enuious
and infinite to arraigne
the ſeuerall ſciences of their adulteration
and fraud; let mee
rather ſhut them all vp together
in that fearefull ſentence of wiſe
Salomon,
               Pro. 21. 6, 
               Vhe gathering of treaſures
by a deceitfull tongue, is a vanity toſſed
to and fro of them that ſeeke death:
and (if yee pleaſe) read on in the
next verſe,7. 
               The robbery of the wicked
ſhall deſtroy them. Search
your cheſts, ſearch your hearts
(ô all yee that heare me this day)
and if any of you finde any of
this adulterine gold amongſt

your heapes, away with it, as ye
loue your ſelues, away with it;
Elſe know that (as Chryſoſtome
wittily) yee haue lockt vp a
theefe in your counting-houſe,
which will carry away all, and
if yee looke not to it the ſooner,
your ſoules with it.
            
               Rich, In this world,
               I
                     •
                   this world. not Of it. As
S. Iohn diſtinguiſheth of being
in the Church, and being of it,
ſo doth S. Paul of the world;
Thoſe are the rich of the world
which are worldlings in heart,
as well as in eſtate; Thoſe are
rich in the world, whoſe eſtate is
below, whoſe hearts are aboue:
The rich of the world are in it,
but the rich in the world are not
of it: Maruell not there ſhould

be ſo much difference in litle
particles; The time was when
this very difference of 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , and 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               ,
ſet the the whole world together
by the eares in the controuerſie
of Eutyches, and Dioſcorus;
and here, you ſee there is no
leſſe diſtance betweene them,
then betwixt heauen and earth:
If Timothy, or S. Paul either,
ſhould haue charged the rich of
the world hee had charmed a
deafe adder; Yea perhaps euen
with this charge (like a ruſtie or
ill-wrought peece) they had recoyled
in his face with thoſe
Athenians, What will this babler ſay?
The Prophet is a foole, the ſpirituall
man is mad, as they ſay in the Prophet:
There is no good to be

done on a worldly heart; it is
both hard and cold; Let the
Smith ſtrike a barre new-come
out of the fire (though it be
yron) it bowes, let him ſtrike
on his anvile neuer ſo long,
there is no impreſſion, but rather
a rebound of the ſtroke: The
maker of all hearts tells vs, that
the vnregenerate man hath Cor
lapideum, an heart of ſtone, and
to what purpoſe do we with our
venerable Countryman preach
to an heape of ſtones? Will yee
haue the reaſon why we preach
our ſelues hoarſe and dead, and
preuaile not? The world is in
mens eares, the world is in their
hearts; and they are not in the
world, but of it; and there can

be nothing in them that are of
the world, but that which is enmitie
to God; and that which
God repayes with enmity, ſo as
there is no way for them but periſhing
with the world: It is
for thoſe onely whoſe hearts are
not in their bags, to receiue the
charge from God for their
wealth, and to returne glory to
him by it: To theſe (whereof I
hope here are many before mee)
muſt Timothies charge, and my
ſpeech be directed: Let theſe
heare their condition firſt, and
then their dutie: Their condition,
They are rich, but In this world;
For diſtinction, for limitation;
one implyes the eſtate of their
riches, the other the time.
            
               
Their eſtate, as learned Beza,
that they are but worldly riches.
The very word imports that
there are other riches, not of the
world; as Auſten diſtinguiſhes
of Pauper in animo, and in ſacculo;
poore in minde, and in purſe; ſo
may we of the rich: There is a
ſpirituall wealth, as well as a ſecular;
and ſo true and precious
is the ſpirituall, that the ſecular
wealth is but ſtarke beggery to
it; This outward wealth is in
acres of earth, in the bowels of
the earth, the fruits of the earth,
beaſts of the earth; and all of it
is valued by peeces of earth, and
one mouth-full of earth makes
an end of all; Who knowes not
that Earth is the baſeſt peece of

the world, and yet earth is at the
end of all theſe riches, and all of
them end in the earth: See
what it is that the world dotes
and dreames of (for theſe earthly
hopes, as the diuine Philoſopher
ſaid, are but dreames of the
waking) euen Nebuchadnezzars
image, a compoſition of mettals,
and the foote of all is clay.
Earthly men tread vpon their
felicitie, and yet haue not the
wit to contemne it and to ſeeke
a better, which is the ſpirituall
wealth; the cabinet whereof is
the ſoule, and the treaſure in it,
God himſelfe. Oh happy reſolution
of that bleſſed Father,Auſten.
               Omnis mihi copia, quae Deus meus non
est, egeſtas eſt, All wealth beſides

my God, is penury. Ambiant terrena,
ſaith another, Let the Gentiles
ſeeke after earthly things
which haue no right to heauenly,
let them deſire the preſent,
which beleeue not the future;
The Chriſtians wealth is his Sauiour,
and how can he complaine
of meaſure that hath the
author of all? What ſhould I
need to ſay more of the Chriſtian
heart, He is rich in God; and
therefore well may he ſing that
contented ditty of the Pſalmiſt,
Funes ceciderunt mihi in praeclaris, My
lot is falne in a good ground, and I
haue a goodly heritage: Oh that it
could be our ambition that Nazianzen
reports of his Philagrius,
lutum contemnere, to ſcorne this

baſe and (pardon an homely
word) dirty God of the world,
and to aſpire vnto the true
riches; and when Satan ſhall
offer to greaze vs in the fiſt to
remit but a litle of the rigor of a
good conſcience, we could caſt
it in his face with S. Peters indignation,
Thy gold and thy ſiluer periſh
with thee.
            
            The eſtate of wealth is not
more deſcribed by this world,
then the time; For (world. 
               
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               ) when
it is abſolutely ſpoken, be, as the
Philoſopher (euer-being 
               
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               ) yet when it
is reſtrained with a (Now. 
               
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               ) it is
ſcarce a time; and at the moſt,
is turned iuſtly ſeculum à ſequendo,
as Iſidore.
               
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  
                Like as the ſame word
in the Hebrew that ſignifies

eternitie, at other times ſignifies
but fifty yeares, the compaſſe of
a Iubilee; So as (
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               ) is but
the ſpace of humane life, which
how ſhort ſoeuer, is the vtmoſt
extent of the vſe of worldly
riches. Wealth is like vnto
words, by impoſition, not naturall;
for commodities are as
they are commonly valued; we
know bracelets of glaſſe, and
copper chaines, and litle bells,
and ſuch like trifles are good
merchandiſe ſomwhere, though
contemptible with vs; and
thoſe things which the Indians
regard not, Europe holds precious:
What are coynes where
their vſe and valuation ceaſes?
The Patars, and Souſes, and Deniers,

and Quart-d'eſcus that are
currant beyond the water, ſerue
but for counters to vs: Thus it
is with all our wealth: Conſider
I beſeech you that all our
Crownes, and Soueraynes, and
Peeces, and halfe-peeces, and
Duckets, and double Duckets
are currant but to the brim of
the graue, there they ceaſe; and
we iuſtly laugh at the folly of
thoſe Eaſterne pagans, which
put coyne into the dead mans
hand for his prouiſion in another
world: What ſhould we
doe therefore, if we will be prouident
trauelers, but make ouer
our money here, to receiue it by
exchange in the world to come;
It is our Sauiours counſell, Make

you friends of the vnrighteous Mammon,
that they may receiue you into
euerlaſting habitations: And as a
Father ſayes ſweetly, If yee will be
wiſe merchants, thrifty and happy
vſurers, part with that which yee cannot
keepe, that you may gaine that
which yee cannot looſe; Which that
yee may do, both in preparation
of minde, and (when neede is)
in a charitable abdication, harken
to the Duties which GOD
layes vpon you. The remouall
of euill muſt make roome for
good; Firſt therefore our Apoſtle
would haue our hearts cleared
of euill diſpoſitions, then
ſetled in good: The euill diſpoſitions
that doe commonly attend
wealth, are Pride and Miſconfidence:

Againſt theſe our
Apoſtle bendeth his charge;
That they be not hye-minded; That
they truſt not in vncertaine riches.
            
            For the firſt;That they bee not 
                     •
                  ye-min
                  
                     •
                  ed. It is ſtrange to
ſee how this earthly droſſe,
which is of it ſelfe heauy, and
therfore naturally ſinks downeward,
ſhould raiſe vp the heart
of man; and yet it commonly
carries a man vp, euen to a double
pitch of Pride, one aboue
others, the other aboue himſelfe,
Aboue others in contempt, aboue
himſelfe in ouer-weening;
The poore and proud is the
Wiſe-mans monſter, but the
proud and rich are no newes:
It is againſt all reaſon that mettals
ſhould make difference of

reaſonable men, of Chriſtians;
for as that wiſe Law-giuer ſaid,Theodericus refer. Caſſiodore.
               A free man can be valued at no price;
Yet Salomon noted in his time,
The rich rules the poore; not the
wiſe; and Siracides in his, The
rich ſpeaks proudly, and what fellow
is this? and S. Iames in his, The
man with the gold ring lookes
to ſit hyeſt. And not to caſt
backe our eyes, Doe yee not ſee
it thus in our times? If a man
be but worth a foot-cloth, how
big hee lookes on the inferior
paſſengers? and if he haue purchaſed
a litle more land, or title
then his neighbours, you ſhall
ſee it in his garbe; If he command,
it is imperiouſly, with
ſirrah, and fellow; If he ſalute,

it is ouerly, with a ſurly and ſilent
nod; if he ſpeake, it is oracles;
if hee walke, it is with a
grace; if he controll, it is in the
killing accent; if he intertaine,
it is with inſolence, and whatſoeuer
he doth, he is not as he was,
nor, as the Phariſee ſayes, like
other men. He looks vpon vulgar
men, as if they were made to
ſerue him, and ſhould thinke
themſelues happy to be commanded;
and if he be croſſed a
litle, he ſwells like the ſea in a
ſtorme; Let it be by his equall,
he cares more for an affront, then
for death, or hell; Let it by his
inferiour, (although in a iuſt
cauſe) that man ſhall be ſure to
be cruſht to death for his preſumption:

And alas when all is
done, after theſe hye termes, all
this is but a man, and (God
knowes) a fooliſh one too,
whom a litle earthly traſh can
affect ſo deeply.
            Neither doth this pride raiſe a
man more aboue others, then
aboue himſelf; And what wonder
is it if he will not know his
poore neighbours, which hath
forgotten himſelfe? As Saul
was changed to another man
preſently vpon his anointing, ſo
are men vpon their aduancement;
and according to our
ordinary prouerbe, Their good
and their bloud riſes together;
Now it may not be taken
as it hath beene; Other cariage,

other faſhions are fit for them;
Their attire, fare, retinue, houſes,
furniture diſpleaſe them, new
muſt be had; together with coaches,
and lacquaies, and all the
equipage of greatnes: Theſe
things (that no man miſtake
me) I miſlike not; they are fit
for thoſe that are fit for them.
Charity is not ſtrait-laced, but
yeelds much latitude to the lawfull
vſe of indifferent things;
(although it is one of Salomons
vanities that ſeruants ſhould
ride on horſe-backe, and he tells
vs it becomes not a ſwine to be
ringd with gold) but it is the
heart that makes all theſe euill;
when that is puft vp with theſe
windy vanities, and hath learned

to borrow that part of the Deuils
ſpeech, All theſe things are
mine; and can ſay with him that
was turnd into a beaſt, Is not this
great Babel that I haue built, or with
that other patterne of pride, I ſit
as a Queene, I am, and there is none
beſide me, now all theſe turne into
ſinne.
            The buſh that hangs out,
ſhowes what we may looke for
within; Whither doth the conceit
of a litle inheritance tranſport
the Gallants of our time?
O God, what a world of vanity
haſt thou reſerv'd vs to? I am
aſham'd to thinke that the Goſpell
of Chriſt ſhould be diſgraced
with ſuch diſguiſed clyents.
Are they Chriſtians, or Antickes

in ſome Carnevale, or childrens
puppets that are thus dreſſed?
Pardon, I beſeech you, men, brethren,
and fathers, this my iuſt
and holy impatience, that could
neuer expreſſe it ſelfe in a more
ſolemne aſſembly (although I
perceiue thoſe whom it moſt
concernes, are not ſo deuout as
to be preſent). Who can without
indignation looke vpon the
prodigyes, which this miſ-imagination
produces in that other
ſexe, to the ſhame of their huſbands,
the ſcorne of religion, the
damnation of their own ſoules.
Imagine one of our fore-fathers
were aliue againe, and ſhould
ſee one of theſe his gay daughters
walke in Cheapſide before

him; what doe you thinke hee
would thinke it were? Here is
nothing to be ſeene but a verdingale,
a yellow ruffe, and a
periwig, with perhaps ſome fether
wauing in the top; three
things for which he could not
tell how to finde a name: Sure,
he could not but ſtand amazed
to thinke what new creature the
times had yeelded ſince he was
a man: And if then he ſhould
runne before her, to ſee if by the
fore-ſide he might gueſſe what
it were, when his eyes ſhould
meet with a poudred firzle, a
painted hide ſhadowed with a
fan not more painted, breſts
diſplayd, and a looſe lock erring
wantonly ouer her ſhoulders,

betwixt a painted cloth, and
skin, how would he yet more
bleſſe himſelfe to thinke, what
mixture in nature could be guilty
of ſuch a monſter. Is this
(thinks he) the fleſh and blood,
is this the hayre, is this the ſhape
of a woman? or hath nature
repented of her worke ſince my
daies, and begun a new frame?
It is no maruell if their forefathers
could not know them;
God himſelfe that made them,
will neuer acknowledge that
face he neuer made, the hayre
that he neuer made theirs, the
body that is aſham'd of the maker,
the ſoule that thus diſguiſes
the body; Let me therefore ſay
to theſe Dames, as Benet ſaid

to Totilaes ſeruant, Depone filia
quod portas, quia non est tuum; Lay
downe that yee weare, it is none
of your owne: Let me perſwade
them (for that can worke moſt)
that they do all this in their own
wrong: All the world knowes
that no man will rough caſt a
marble wall, but mud, or vnpoliſht
ragge: That beauty is like
truth, neuer ſo glorious, as when
it goes plaineſt; that falſe art in
ſtead of mending nature, marres
it: But if none of our perſwaſions
can preuaile; Heare this
yee gariſh popingayes of our
time, if you will not be aſhamed
to cloth your ſelues in this
ſhameleſſe faſhion, God ſhall
cloth you with ſhame and confuſion:

Heare this, yee plaiſterfaced
Iezebels, if you will not
leaue your dawbing and your
hye waſhes, God ſhall one day
waſh them off with fire and
brimſtone.
            I grant, it is not wealth alone
that is acceſſary to this pride;
there are ſome that (with the
Cynick, or that worſe dog, the
patch't Ciſtertian) are proud of
raggs; there are others, that are
rich of nothing but clothes,
ſomewhat like to Nazianzens
country of Ozizala, that abounded
in flowers, but was barren
of corne; Their clothes are
more worth then all the reſt; as
we vſe to ſay of the Elder, that
the flower of it, is more worth

then all the tree beſides; but if
there be any other cauſes of our
hye-mindedneſſe, wealth is one,
which doth ordinarily lift vp
our heads, aboue our ſelues,
aboue others; and if there be
here any of theſe empty bladders,
that are pufft vp with the
winde of conceit, giue me leaue
to pricke them a litle; and firſt,
let me tell them they may haue
much, and be neuer the better;
The chimnye ouer-lookes all
the reſt of the houſe, is it not
(for all that) the very baſeſt peece
of the building? The very heathen
man could obſerue (
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               
&amp;c.)

                   &amp;c. Ariſt. That God giues many
a man wealth for their greater
miſcheife; As the Iſraelites were

rich in Quailes, but their ſawce
was ſuch, that famine had been
better; litle cauſe had they to be
proud that they were fed with
meat of Princes, with the bread
of Angels, whiles that which
they put into their mouthes,
God fetcht out of their noſthrils.
Haman was proud that he alone
was called to the honor of Eſters
feaſt, this advancement rayſd
him fifty cubits hyer, to a ſtately
gibbet; If your wealth be to
any of you an occaſion of falling,
if your gold be turned into
fetters, it had beene better for
you to haue liued beggers. Let
me tell them next, of the folly of
this Pride; They are proud of
that which is none of theirs.

That which law, and caſe-diuinitie

                  . is
as true of wealth: Nature can
tell him in the Philoſopher, that
hee is not Dominus but Colonus,
not the Lord but the farmer:
It is a iuſt obſeruation of Philo,
that God onely by a propriety is
ſtiled the poſſeſſor of heauen
and earth, by Melchiſedech, in his
ſpeech to Abraham;
               Gen. 14. We are onely
the Tenants, and that at the
will of the Lord; At the moſt
(if we will as Diuines) we haue
ius ad rem, not dominium in rem,
right to theſe earthly things, not
lordſhip ouer them; but right
of fauour from their proprietarie,
and Lord in heauen, and

that liable to an account: Doe
wee not laugh at the groome
that is proud of his Maſters
horſe, or ſome vaine whiffler,
that is proud of a borrowed
chaine? So ridiculous are we to
be pufft vp with that, whereof
we muſt needs ſay, with the
poore man, of the hatchet, Alas
maſter it is but borrowed; and
whereof our account ſhall be ſo
much more great, and difficult,
as our receit is more; Hath God
therefore laded you with theſe
earthly riches, be yee like vnto
the full eare of corne, hange
downe your heads in true humilitie
towards that earth from
which you came: And if your
ſtalke be ſo ſtiffe, that it beares

vp aboue the reſt of your ridge,
looke vp to heauen, not in the
thoughts of pride, but in the
humble vowes of thankfulnes,
and bee not hye-minded, but
feare.
            Hitherto of the hye-mindedneſſe

Now where our pride is, there
will be our confidence; As the
wealthy therefore may not be
proud of their riches, ſo they
may not truſt in them; What is
this truſt, but the ſetting of our
hearts vpon them, the placing of
our ioy and contentment in
them; in a word, the making of
them our beſt freind, our patron,
our idoll, our God? This the
true and ielous God cannot

abide, and yet nothing is more
ordinarie; The rich mans wealth is
his ſtrong Citie, ſaith Salomon, and
where ſhould a man thinke
himſelfe ſafe but in his fort?
He ſees Mammon can doe ſo
much, and heares him talke of
doing ſo much more, it is no
maruell if he yeeld to truſt him,
Mammon is ſo proud a boaſter,
that his clients which beleeue in
him, cannot chooſe but be confident
of him; For what doth
he not brag to do? Siluer anſwers
to all, ſaith Salomon; That wee
grant; although we would be
loath it could anſwer to Truth,
to iuſtice, to iudgment: But yet
more, he vaunts to procure all,
to pacifie all, to conquer all; He

sayes he can procure all, ſecular
offices, titles, dignities; yea (I
would I might not ſay in ſome
ſacrilegious and periur'd wretches)
the ſacred promotions of
the Church; and yee know that

Roman trafique,Keyes, Altars, Chriſt. 
               Claues, Altaria,

Ghoſt himſelfe may be had for

all; A gift in the boſome appeaſeth
wrath; yea he ſaies (looke to it
yee that ſit in the ſeates of iudicature)
he can ſometimes bribe
off ſins, and peruert iudgment:
He ſaies he can ouercome all, according
to the old Greeke verſe,

God himſelfe withall (All theſe
will I giue thee), breifly hee ſaies
according to the French prouerbe,
Siluer does all; And let
me tell you indeed, what Mammon
can doe; He can barre the
gates of heauen, hee can open
the gates of hell to the vnconſcionable
ſoule, and helpe his followers
to damnation: This he
can doe; but for other things,
howſoeuer with vs men, the
fooliſh Siluer-ſmiths may ſhout
out, Great is Mammon of the
worldlings, yet if we weigh his
power aright, we ſhall conclude
of Mammon (as Paracelſus doth

of the Deuill) that he is a baſe
and beggerly ſpirit: For what I
beſeech you, can he doe? Can
he make a man honeſt? can he
make him wiſe? can hee make
him healthfull? Can he giue a
man to liue more merrily, to
feed more heartily, to ſleep more
quietly? Can hee buy off the
gout, cares, death, much leſſe the
paines of another world? nay,
doth he not bring all theſe? Goe
to then, thou rich man; God is
offended with thee, and meanes
to plague thee with diſeaſe and
death; Now try what thy bags
can do; Begin firſt with God, &amp;
ſee whether thou canſt bribe
him with thy gifts, and buy off
his diſpleaſure; Wherewith ſhalt

thou come before the Lord and bow
thy ſelfe before the hye God?
               Micha 6. 
               will the
Lord be pleaſed with thouſands of
rams, or with ten thouſand riuers of
oyle? The ſiluer is mine, and the gold
is mine, ſaith the Lord of hoſts, Haggai
2. If that ſpeed not, go to
the ſergeant of God, death; ſee
if thou canſt fee him, not to arreſt
thee; He lookes thee ſternely
in the face, and tells thee with
Ehud hee hath a meſſage to thee
from God; and bids thee with
the Prophet ſet thine houſe in order,
for thou muſt dye; Yet, if he heare
thee not, goe to the vnder-bayliffe
of Death, diſeaſe, ſee if hee
can bee wrought to forbeare
thee; he anſwers thee with Laban,
This thing is proceeded of the

Lord I cannot therefore ſay to thee euill
or good. In ſumme, Diſeaſe will
ſummon thee vnto death; Death
will arreſt thee to the iudgment
ſeat of God, God will paſſe his
doome vpon thee, and in all
theſe Riches auaile not in the day of
wrath: And who would be ſo
mad as to truſt a freind that he
knowes will be ſure neuer to
faile him, but when hee hath
moſt neede? Take heede therefore,
as yee loue your ſoules,
how yee beſtow your Truſt vpon
riches; Yee may vſe them, and
ſerue your ſelues of them; yea
yee may enioy them in a Chriſtian
moderation; God will allow
it you: That praiſe which

philoſophatur; In good caſts hee
was ſilent, in ill, merry; in neither
angry, a philoſopher in
both. But if we will be making
our wealth a riuall vnto God,
now the ielouſie of God ſhall
burne like fire; this is the way
to bring a curſe vpon our riches,
and vs; If we leane vpon this
reed, it ſhall breake, and runne
into our hand; and he that truſteth
in riches ſhall fall. Prou. 11.

Now as the diſdainfull riuall
will be ſure to caſt reproches vpon
his baſe competitor;In vncertaine riches. ſo doth
God, that we may ſee how vnworthy
riches are of our truſt,
he tells vs they are vncertaine,
               
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . yea
vncertainty it ſelfe. Were our
wealth tyed to our life, it were
vncertaine enough; what is that
but a flower, a vapor, a tale, a
dreame, a ſhadow, a dreame of a
ſhadow, a thought, as nothing?
What are great men but like hailſtones,
that leape vp on the Tiles,
&amp; ſtraight fall downe againe, &amp;
lye ſtill, &amp; melt away? But now,
as we are certaine that our riches
determine with our vncertaine
life (for goods and life are both
in a bottom, both are caſt away

at once;) ſo we cannot be certaine
they will hold ſo long;
Our life flies haſtily away, but
many times our riches haue longer
wings, and out-flie it; It
was a witty obſeruation of Baſil

In our penall lawes, there are
more waies to forfait our goods,
then our liues; On our hye
waies, how many fauorable
theeues take the purſe, and ſaue

the life? And generally, our life
is the tree, our wealth is the
leaues, or fruit; the tree ſtands
ſtill when the leaues are fallne,
the fruit beaten downe; Yea
many a one is like the Pine-tree,
which (they ſay) if his barke be
pulld off laſts long, elſe it rots;
ſo doth many a man liue the
longer for his loſſes; If therefore
life and wealth ſtriue whether
is more vncertaine, wealth
will ſure carry it away. Iob was

What do I inſtance? This is a
point wherein many of you Citizens,
that are my auditors this
day, might rather read a lecture
vnto mee; You could tell mee
how many you haue knowne,
reputed in your phraſe, goodmen,
which all on the ſudden
haue ſhut vp the ſhop windowes,
&amp; broken for thouſands;
You could reckon vp to mee a
catalogue of them, whom either
caſualty of fire, or inundation
of waters, or robbery of theeues,
or negligence of ſeruants, or
ſuretyſhip for frends, or ouerſight
of reckonings, or truſting
of cuſtomers, or vnfaithfulnes
of Factors, or inexpected falls

of markets, or pyracie by ſea, or
vnskilfulnes of a pilot, or violence
of tempeſts haue brought
to an haſty pouertie; and could
tell mee that it is in the power of
one gale of winde to make many
of you either rich Merchants,
or beggers: Oh miſerable vncertaintie
of this earthly pelfe,
that ſtands vpon ſo many hazards,
yea that falls vnder them!
who would truſt it? who
can dote vpon it? what madneſſe
is it in thoſe men, which (as
Menot ſayes) like vnto hunters,
that kill an horſe of price, in
the purſuit of an hare worth nothing,
indanger yea caſt away
their ſoules vpon this worthleſſe
and fickle traſh. Glaſſes are pleaſing

veſſels, yet becauſe of their
brittleneſſe, who eſteemes them
precious? All Salomons ſtate was
not comparable to one Tulip,
his royall crowne was not like
the Crowne Imperiall of our
Gardens; and yet becauſe theſe
are but flowers, whoſe deſtinie is
fading and burning, we regard
them thereafter; No wiſe man
beſtowes much coſt in painting
mud-walls. What meane wee
(my beloued) to ſpend our liues
and hearts vpon theſe periſhing
treaſures? It was a wiſe meditation
of Nazianzen to his Aſterius;
that good is to no purpoſe if it
continue not; yea there is no
pleaſant thing in the world, ſaith
he, that hath ſo much ioy in the

welcome, as it hath ſorrow in
the farewell: Looke therefore
vpon theſe heapes, ô yee wiſe-hearted
Citizens, with careleſſe
eyes, as thoſe things whoſe parting
is certaine, whoſe ſtay is vncertaine;
and ſay with that worthy
father, By all my wealth, and
glory, and greatnes this alone
haue I gained, that I had ſomething
to which I might preferre
my Sauiour. And know that as
Abraham whiles hee was in his
owne country (it is Cyrills note)
had neuer God appearing to
him, ſaue onely to bid him goe
forth, but after, when hee was
gone forth, had frequent viſions
of his maker; So whiles in our
affections wee remaine here below

in our cofers, we cannot
haue the comfortable aſſurances
of the preſence of God; but if
we can abandon the loue and
truſt of theſe earthly things, in
the conſcience of our obedience,
now God ſhall appeare to vs,
and ſpeake peace to our ſoules;
and neuer ſhall we finde cauſe to
repent vs of the change. Let me
therefore conclude this point
with that diuine charge of our
Sauiour, Lay not vp for your ſelues
treaſures on earth, where mothe and
rust doe corrupt, and theeues breake
thorough and ſteale, but lay vp for
your ſelues treaſure in heauen.
            
            Thus much of the negatiue
part of our charge; Wherein we
haue dwelt ſo long, that we may

ſcarce ſoiourne in the other.
Truſt not,
               But (truſt) in God. but Truſt; The heart
of man is ſo conſcious of his
owne weaknes, that it will not
goe without a prop; and better
a weake ſtay then none at all;
Like as in matter of policie, the
very ſtate of Tyrannie is preferred
to the want of a King; The
ſame breath therefore that withdrawes
one refuge from vs, ſubſtitutes
a better; and in ſteed of
Riches, which is the falſe God of
the world, commends to vs the
True and liuing God of heauen
and earth; Euen as ſome good
Carpenter raiſes vp the ſtudds,
and in ſteed of a rotten groundſell
layes a ſound; The ſame
truſt then muſt we giue to God,

which which we may not giue
to Riches; The obiect onely is
changed, the act is not changed.
Him muſt we eſteeme aboue all
things, to him muſt we looke vp
in all, on him muſt we depend
for all both protection, and prouiſion;
from his goodneſſe and
mercy muſt wee acknowledge
all, and in him muſt we delight
with contempt of all; and this
is to Truſt in God. It was a
ſweet ditty of the Pſalmiſt,
which wee muſt all learne to
ſing, Bonum est conſidere in Domino,
It is good to truſt in the Lord:
Good, in reſpect of him, and
good for vs. For him, It is one
of the beſt peeces of his glory, to
be Truſted to: as, with vs, Ioſeph
               
holds Potiphar cannot doe
him a greater honor, then in
Truſting him with all; And his
glory is ſo precious, that he cannot
part with that to any creature;
All other things hee imparts
willingly, and reſerues nothing
to himſelfe but this: Being,
life, knowledge, happineſſe
are ſuch bleſſings, as are eminently,
originally, eſſentially in
God, and yet, Being, he giues to
all things, Life to many, Knowledge
to ſome kindes of creatures,
happineſſe to ſome of
thoſe kindes, as for Riches, he
ſo giues them to his creature,

                  •
               hat he keeps them not at all to
himſelfe; But as for his glory
(whereof our truſt is a part) hee

will not indure it communicated
to Angell, or man; not to
the beſt gueſt in heauen, much
leſſe to the droſſe of the earth;
Whence is that curſe not without
an indignation, Curſed be the
man truſts in man; that maketh fleſh
his arme, yea or ſpirit either, beſides
the God of ſpirits; Whom
haue I in heauen but thee? Herein
therefore we doe iuſtice to God,
when wee giue him his owne,
that is, his glory, our confidence.
            But the greateſt good is our
owne; and God ſhowes much
more mercy to vs in allowing
and inabling vs to truſt him,
then we can doe iuſtice in truſting
him; For alas he could in

his iuſt iudgment glorifie himſelfe
in our not Truſting him, in
taking vengeance of vs for not
glorifying him: Our goodnes
reaches not to him; but his
goodnes reaches downe to vs in
that our hearts are raiſed vp to
confidence in him. For, what
ſafety, what vnſpeakable comfort
is there in Truſting to God?
When our Sauiour in the laſt
words of his diuine-Farewell-Sermon
to his Diſciples would
perſwade them to confidence, he
ſayes (
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               ):Joh. 16. vlt. and ſo doth the
Angell to Paul in priſon; a word
that ſignifies Boldnes; implying
that our confidence in God cauſeth
Boldnes and courage; And
what is there in all the world

that can worke the heart to ſo
comfortable and vnconquerable
reſolution as our repoſall
vpon God? The Lord is my truſt,
whom then can I feare? In the Lord
put I my truſt, how ſay yee then to my
ſoule, flee hence as a bird to the hills?
Yea how oft doth Dauid inferre
vpon this Truſt, a non confundar,
I ſhall not be aſhamed; And this
caſe is generall, That they that put
their trust in the Lord are as mount
Sion that cannot be moued; Faith
can remoue mountaines, but the
mountaines that are raiſd on
faith, are vnremoueable. Here
is a ſtay for you (ô yee wealthy
and great) worthy of your truſt;
If yee were Monarchs on earth,
or Angels in heauen, ye could be

no way ſafe but in this truſt;
How eaſie is it for him to inrich,
or impoueriſh you, to
hoyſe you vp to the ſeats of honor,
or to ſpurne you downe?
What mines, what Princes can
raiſe you vp to wealth, againſt
him, without him? He can bid
the windes and ſeas fauour your
veſſels, he can bid them ſinke in
a calme.Prou. 22. 
               The rich and the poore meet
together, God is the maker of both;
Yee may trade, and toyle, and
carke, and ſpare, and put vp, and
caſt about, and at laſt ſit you
downe with a ſigh of late repentance
and ſay, Except the Lord build
the houſe, they labour in vaine that
build it; It is in vaine to riſe early,
and lye downe late, and eat the bread of

ſorrow. Vnto how many of you
may I ſay with the prophet
Haggai, Yee haue ſowen much, and
bring in litle; Yee eat and haue not
enough, yee drinke, but yee are not filled,
yee cloth you, but yee be not warme;
and he that earneth much, puts his
gaines into a broken bagg. And
whence is all this? Yee looked for
much, and loe it came to litle; when
yee brought it home I did blow vpon it,
ſaith the Lord of hosts. Behold
how eaſie a thing it is for the
God of heauen to blaſt all your
ſubſtance; yea not onely to diminiſh,
but to curſe it vnto you,
and to make you weary of it,
and of your ſelues. Oh caſt your
ſelues therefore into thoſe Allmighty
hands, ſeeke him in

whom onely you ſhall finde
true reſt and happines; Honor
him with your ſubſtance, that
hath honored you with it;
Truſt not in riches, but truſt in
GOD.
            It is motiue enough to your
Truſt, that he is a God; all arguments
are infolded in that
one; yet this text giues you certaine
explicit inforcements of
this confidence; Euery one of
theſe reaſons (implying a ſecret
kinde of diſdainfull compariſon
betwixt the true God and the
falſe) perſwade you to truſt in
God; Riches are but for this
world, the true God is Lord of
the other, and begins his glory
where the glory of the world

ends: therefore Truſt in him.
Riches are vncertaine, the true
GOD is Amen, the firſt and the
laſt; euer like himſelfe, therefore
truſt in him. Riches are but a
liueleſſe and ſenſeleſſe mettall,
the true God is a liuing God,
therefore truſt in him. Riches
are but paſſiues in gift, they cannot
beſtow ſo much as themſelues,
much leſſe ought beſides
themſelues, the true God giues
you all things to enioy, therefore
Truſt in him; the two latter,
becauſe they are more directly
ſtood vpon, and now fall into
our way, require a further diſcourſe.
            
               (El-chai) The liuing God,
               The liuing. is an
ancient and vſuall title to the

Almighty; eſpecially when he
would diſgrace an vnworthy
riuall. As S. Paul in his ſpeech
to the Lyſtrians, oppoſes to their
vaine Idols, the liuing GOD.
Viuo ego, As I liue, is the oath of
God for this purpoſe, as Hierom
noteth, neither doe I remember
any thing beſides his holineſſe,
and his life that he ſweares by:
When Moſes askt Gods name, he
deſcrib'd himſelfe by, I AM;
He is, he liues; and nothing is,
nothing liues abſolutely, but he;
all other things by participation
from him. In all other things,
their life and they are two; but
God is his owne life, and the life
of God is no other then the liuing
God: And becauſe he is

his owne life, he is eternall; for
(as Thomas argues truely againſt
the Gentiles) Nothing ceaſes to
be but by a ſeparation of life, and
nothing can be ſeparated from
it ſelfe; for euery ſeparation is
a diuiſion of one thing from another;
Moſt iuſtly therefore is
he which is abſolute, ſimple, eternall
in his being, called the
liuing God: Although, not onely
the life that he hath in himſelfe,
but the life that he giues to
his creatures challengeth a part
in this title; A glimpſe whereof
perhaps the Heathen ſaw, when
they call'd their Iupiter, (
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               )
from (
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               ) which ſignifies to
liue: In him we liue (ſaith S. Paul
to his Athenians). As light is

from the Sunne, ſo is life from
God, (which is the true ſoule of
the world, and more; for without
him it could not be ſo much
as a carcaſſe; and ſpreads it ſelfe
into all the animate creatures.
Life (we ſay) is ſweet; and ſo it is
indeed; the moſt excellent and
precious thing that is deriued
from the common influence of
God. There is nothing before
life, but Being; and Being makes
no diſtinction of things; for that
can be nothing, that hath no
Being; Life makes the firſt and
greateſt diuiſion; Thoſe creatures
therefore, which haue life,
we eſteeme farre beyond thoſe,
that haue it not, how noble ſoeuer
otherwiſe; Thoſe things

therefore which haue the perfiteſt
life muſt needs be the beſt;
Needs then muſt it follow that
he which is life it ſelfe, who is
abſolute, ſimple, eternall, the
fountaine of all that life which
is in the world, is moſt worthy
of all the adoration, ioy, loue,
and confidence of our hearts,
and of the beſt improuement of
that life which he hath giuen vs.
Truſt therefore in the liuing
GOD. Couetouſnes (the ſpirit
of God tells vs) is Idolatry, or (as
our old Tranſlation turnes it)
worſhipping of Images. Euery
ſtampe or impreſſion in his
coyne is to the couetous man a
very Idoll; And what madnes
is there in this Idolatry, to dote

vpon a baſe creature, and to beſtow
that life which wee haue
from God, vpon a creature that
hath no life in it ſelfe, and no
price but from men: Let mee
then perſwade euery ſoule that
heares me this day, as Iacob did
his houſhold, Put away the ſtrange
Gods that are among you,
               Gen. 35. 
                     •
                  . 
               &amp; be cleane;
and as S. Paul did his Lyſtrians;
Oh turne away from theſe vanities
vnto the liuing God.
            
            The laſt attractiue of our
Truſt to God is his mercy,Who giues vs richly all things to enioy. and
liberalitie; Who giues vs richly all
things to enioy: A theme, wherein
yee will grant it eaſie to leeſe our
ſelues. Firſt God not only hath
all in himſelfe, but he giues to
vs, Hee giues, not ſomewhat

(though a cruſt is more then we
are worthy of) but all things.
And not a litle of all, but richly;
and all this, not to looke on, but
to enioy; Euery word would
require not a ſeuerall houre, but
a life to meditate of it; and the
tongue not of men, but Angels
to expreſſe it. It is here with vs,
as in a throng; wee can get neither
in nor out; But as we vſe
to ſay of Cares, ſo it ſhall be with
our diſcourſe, that the greatnes
of it ſhall procure ſilence; and
the more wee may ſay of this
head, the leſſe we will ſay: It
ſhal content vs only to top theſe
ſheaues, ſince we cannot ſtand
to threſh them out.
            Whither can yee turne your

eyes to looke beſide the bounty
of God? If yee looke vpward;
His mercy reacheth to the heauens.
If downeward; The earth
is full of his goodnes, and ſo is
the broad ſea. If yee looke about
you; What is it that hee
hath not giuen vs? Ayre to
breath in, fire to warme vs, water
to coole vs, clothes to couer
vs, food to nouriſh vs, fruits to
refreſh vs, yea delicates to pleaſe
vs; beaſts to ſerue vs, Angels
to attend vs, heauen to receiue
vs, and which is aboue all, his
owne Sonne to redeeme vs.
Laſtly, if yee looke into your
ſelues; Hath he not giuen vs a
ſoule to informe vs, ſenſes to informe
our ſoule, faculties to furniſh

that ſoule. Vnderſtanding,
the great ſurvayer of the ſecrets
of nature, and grace; Fantaſie
and Invention the maſter of the
workes; Memory the great
keeper or Maſter of the rolles of
the ſoule, a power that can
make amends for the ſpeede of
Time, in cauſing him to leaue
behinde him thoſe things, which
elſe he would ſo carry away, as
if they had not beene: Will,
which is the Lord Paramount in
the ſtate of the ſoule, the commander
of our actions; the elector
of our reſolutions. Iudgement,
which is the great Counſellor
of the will: Affections,
which are the ſeruants of them
both. A bodie fit to execute the

charge of the ſoule, ſo wondrouſly
diſpoſed, as that euery part
hath beſt oportunitie to his own
functions; ſo qualified with
health ariſing frō proportion of
humors that like a watch kept in
good tune it goes right, and is fit
to ſerue the ſoule, &amp; maintaine it
ſelfe. An eſtate that yeelds all due
conueniences for both ſoule, and
bodie; ſeaſonable times, raine, &amp;
ſun-ſhine; Peace in our borders;
competency, if not plenty of all
commodities, good lawes, religious,
wiſe, iuſt gouernors, happy
and flouriſhing daies, and aboue
all the liberty of the Goſpel. Caſt
vp your bookes, ô ye Citizens, &amp;
ſum vp your receits, I am decei'd
if he that hath leaſt ſhall not confeſſe

his obligations infinite.
There are three things eſpecially
wherein yee are beyond others,
and muſt acknowledge your
ſelues deeper in the bookes of
God, then the reſt of the world;
Let the firſt be the cleare deliuerance
from that wofull iudgement
of the Peſtilence. Oh remember
thoſe ſorrowfull times,Aboue 30000 in one yeare.
when euery moneth ſwept away
thouſands from among you;
When a man could not ſet forth
his foote but into the iawes of
death; when piles of carcaſſes
were carried to their pits as dung
to the fields; when it was cruelty
in the ſicke to admit viſitation,
and loue was litle better
then murderous; And by how

much more ſad and horrible the
face of thoſe euill times looked,
ſo much greater proclaime you
the mercy of God, in this happy
freedom which you now inioy;
that you now throng together
into Gods houſe without feare,
and breath in one anothers face
without danger: The ſecond is
the wonderfull plenty of all
prouiſions both ſpirituall and
bodily; You are the Sea, all the
riuers of the land run into you;
Of the land? yea of the whole
world, Sea and land conſpire to
inrich you. The third is the
priuiledge of carefull gouernment;
Your charters as they are
large and ſtrong, wherein the fauour
of Princes hath made exceptions

from the generall rules
of their municipall lawes, ſo
your forme of adminiſtration is
excellent, and the execution of
Iuſtice exemplary, and ſuch as
might become the mother Citie
of the whole earth. For all
theſe you haue reaſon to aske,
Quid retribuam with Dauid; What
ſhall I render to the Lord for all his benefits?
and to excite one another
vnto thankfulneſſe with that
ſweet ſinger of Iſrael, Oh that men
would therefore praiſe the Lord for his
goodneſſe: and (as beneficence is
a binder) theſe fauors of God
call for your confidence: What
ſhould you do but euer truſt that
God, whom you haue found ſo
gracious? Let him be your God,

be yee his people for euer; and
let him make this free and open
challenge to you all; If there be
any power in heauen, or in earth
that can doe more for you then
he hath done let him haue your
hearts and yourſelues.
            And thus from that dutie we
owe to God in our confidence,
and his beneficence to vs, we deſcend
to that beneficence which
we owe to men; expreſſed in the
variety of foure Epithets, Doing
good,
               That they doe good, and bee rich in good works. 
               being rich in good workes, ready
to diſtribute, willing to communicate;
all to one ſenſe; all is but beneficence:
The ſcriptures of God
leaſt any Atheiſt ſhould quarrell
at this waſte, haue not one word
ſuperfluous; Here is a redoubling

of the ſame words without
fault of Tautologie; a redoubling
of the ſame ſenſe in diuers
words, without idlenes. There is
feruor in theſe repetitions, not
looſenes; as it was wont for this
cauſe to bee obſerued both in
Councels, and acclamations to
Princes, how oft the ſame word
was reiterated, that by the frequence
they might iudge of the
vehemence of affection. It were
eaſie to inſtance in many of this
kinde, as eſpecially Exod. 25. 35.
Pſal. 89. 30. Ioh. 1. 20. and ſo many
more, as that their mention
could not be voide of that ſuperfluitie
which we diſclaime. This
heape of words therfore ſhowes
the vehement intention of his

deſire of good workes, and the
important neceſſitie of their performance;
and the manner of
this expreſſion inforces no leſſe,
Charge the rich, that they do good, and
be rich in doing good. Harken then
yee rich men of the world; it is
not left arbitrary to you, that
you may doe good if you will,
but it is laid vpon you as your
charge and dutie; You muſt do
good works, and woe be to you
if you doe not. This is not a
counſell, but a precept; Although
I might ſay of God, as we vſe to
ſay of Princes, his will is his
command; The ſame neceſſitie
that there is of Truſting in God,
the ſame is in Doing good to men.
Let me ſling this ſtone into the

brazen forheads of our aduerſaries,
which in their ſhameleſſe
challenges of our religion dare
tell the world, wee are all for
faith, nothing for works; and
that we hold works to ſaluation
as a parentheſis to a clauſe, that
it may be perfit without them:
Heauen and earth ſhall witneſſe
the iniuſtice of this calumniation;
and your conſciences
ſhall be our compurgators this
day, which ſhall teſtifie to you,
both now, and on your deathbeds,
that we haue taught you
there is no leſſe neceſſitie of
good works, then if you ſhould
be ſau'd by them; and that
though you cannot be ſaued by
them, as the meritorious cauſes

of your glory, yet that you cannot
be ſaued without them, as
the neceſſarie effects of that
grace which brings glory.
            It is an hard ſentence of ſome
Caſuiſts (concerning their fellowes)
that but a few rich mens
Confeſſors ſhall be ſaued; I imagine,
for that they dawbe vp
their conſciences with vntempered
morter, and ſooth them vp
in their ſins; Let this be the care
of them whom it concerneth;
For vs, we deſire to be faithfull
to God, and you; and tell you
roundly what you muſt truſt to;
Do good therefore yee rich, if
euer yee looke to receiue good;
if euer yee looke to be rich in
heauen, be rich in good works

vpon earth: It is a ſhame to
heare of a rich man that dyes,
and makes his will of thouſands,
and bequeaths nothing to
pious and charitable vſes: God
and the poore are no part of his
heyre; We doe not houer ouer
your expiring ſoules on your
death-beds, as Rauens ouer a
carcaſſe; we doe not begge for
a Couent, nor fright you with
Purgatory, nor chaffer with
you, for that inviſible treaſure of
the Church whereof there is but
one Key-keeper at Rome; but
we tell you that the making of
freinds with this Mammon of
vnrighteouſnes is the way to eternall
habitations: They ſay
of Cyrus that he wont to ſay he

laid vp treaſures for himſelfe,
whiles he made his freinds rich;
but we ſay to you, that you lay
vp treaſures for your ſelues in
heauen, whiles you make the
poore your freinds vpon earth:
We tell you there muſt be a Date,
ere there can be a Dabitur; that
hee which giues to the poore,
lends vpon vſe to the Lord;
which payes large increaſe for
all he borrowes; and how ſhall
he giue you the intereſt of glory,
where he hath not receiued the
principall of beneficence? How
can that man euer looke to be
Gods heyre in the kingdome of
heauen, that giues all away to
his earthly heyres, and lends nothing
to the God of heauen?

As that witty Graecian ſaid of
extreme tall men, that they were
Cypreſſe-trees 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                &amp;c. faire
and tall, but fruitleſſe, ſo may I
ſay of a ſtrait-handed rich man;
And theſe Cypreſſes are not for
the garden of paradiſe; none
ſhall euer be planted there but
the fruitfull: And if the firſt
paradiſe had any trees in it only
for pleaſure, I am ſure the ſecond,Reuel. 22. 2.
which is in the midſt of
the new Ieruſalem, ſhall haue no
tree that beares not twelue fruits,
yea whoſe very leaues are not
beneficiall; Doe good therefore
ô yee rich, and ſhew your
wealth to be, not in hauing, but
in doing good. And if GOD
haue put this holy reſolution

into any of your hearts, take this
with you alſo, from him; Doe
not talke, and purpoſe, and proiect,
but execute; Do not ſo do
good that we may thanke your
death-bed for it, and not you:
Late beneficence is better then
none, but ſo much as early beneficence
is better then late; Hee
that giues not till hee dyes,
ſhowes that he would not giue,
if he could keepe it, and God
loues a cheerefull giuer; That
which you giue thus, you giue it
by your Teſtament, I can ſcarce
ſay you giue it by your will:
The good mans praiſe is, Diſperſit,
dedit, he diſperſes his goods, not,
he left them behinde him; and
his diſtribution is ſeconded

with the retribution of God,
His righteouſneſſe endureth for euer,
Pſal. 112. 9. Our Sauiour tells
vs that our good works are our
light, Let your light ſo ſhine, that
men may ſee your good works; which
of you lets his light goe behind
him, and hath it not rather carried
before him, that he may ſee
which way it goes, and which
way himſelf goes by it? Do good
therefore in your life, that you
may haue cōfort in your death,
and a crowne of life after death.
            Now all this haue I ſpoken,
not for that I haue ought (as
S. Paul ſaies) whereof to accuſe
my Nation; Bleſſed be God, as
good works haue abounded in
this age, ſo this place hath ſuper-abounded

in good works. Be
it ſpoken to the glory of that
God, whoſe all our good works
are, to the honor of the Goſpell,
to the conviction of that lewd
ſlander of Solifidianiſme. LONDON
ſhall vye good works
with any Citie vpon earth; This
day and your eares are abundant
witneſſes; As thoſe therefore
that by an handfull gueſſe at the
whole ſacke, it may pleaſe you
by this yeares breife to iudge of
the reſt; Wherein I do not feare
leaſt Enuie it ſelfe ſhall accuſe vs
of a vaine-glorious oſtentation;
Thoſe obſtreperous benefactors
that (like to hens which cannot
lay an egge but they muſt cackle
ſtraight) giue no almes but with

trumpets, looſe their thankes
with God; Almes ſhould bee
like oyle, which though it ſwim
aloft when it is fallne, yet makes
no noyſe in the falling; not like
water, that ſtill ſounds where it
lights: But howſoeuer priuate
beneficence ſhould not bee acquainted
with both the hands
of the giuer, but ſilently expect
the reward of him that ſeeth in
ſecret, yet God ſhould be a great
looſer, if the publique fruits of
charitie ſhould be ſmothered in
a modeſt ſecrecy: To the praiſe
therefore of that good GOD,
which giues vs to giue, and rewards
vs for giuing, to the example
of poſteritie, to the honor
of our profeſſion, to the incouragement

of the well-deſeruing,
and to the ſhame of our malicious
aduerſaries, heare what this
yeare hath brought forth.
            
               Here followed a breife memoriall of
the charitable acts of the City
this yeare laſt paſt. &amp;c.
            
            And if the ſeaſon had not hindered,
your eyes ſhould haue ſeconded
your eares in the comfortable
teſtimonie of this beneficence,
Euge &amp;c. Well done
good and faithfull ſeruants;
Thus ſhould your profeſſion be
graced, thus ſhould the incenſe
of your almes aſcend in pillers
of holy ſmoke into the noſthrils
of God; thus ſhould your talents
be turned into Cities: This
colour is no other then celeſtiall,

and ſo ſhall your reward be;
Thus ſhould the foundation be
laid of that building, whoſe
walls reach vp vnto heauen,
whoſe roofe is finiſhed and laid
on, in the heauen of heauens, in
that immortalitie of glory,
which the God of all glory,
peace, and comfort hath prouided
for all that loue him; Vnto
the participation whereof the
ſame God of ours mercifully
bring vs, through the ſonne of
his loue, Ieſus Chriſt the righteous,
to whom with the Father,
and the Holy Ghoſt, one infinite
and incomprehenſible God be
giuen all praiſe, honor,
and glory now and
foreuer.
            Amen.
