            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

For then no doubt they are not commended of God / but are rather abhomynable / for whan we knowe not what they meane / then seke we helth in the outward dede / and so are iniuryous vnto Christe and hys blode.

Paulle calleth yt brede saynge:1 Cor. 10. the brede wc we breake / ys yt not the felowship of the bodye of christe? For we though we be manye / are yet one bodye and one brede: as manye as are pertakers of one brede. And agayne he sayeth / asoftyn as ye eate of this brede / or drinke of this cuppe / yow shall shewe the lordes deth vntyll he cōme.1. Cor. 11. Allso luke caulleth yt brede in the actes saying:Actuū. 2 they cōtinued in the felowshyp of the apostylles and in breakinge of brede / and in prayer.Luc. 22.

And surely

as yf ther remayned no brede yt coulde not mould nor wex full of wormes. Euyn so yf ther remayned no wyne / yt coulde not wex sower / and therfore yt ys but faulse doctryne / that our prelates so longe haue puplyshed. Finally that there remaynethe bred might be proued by the auctorite of many doctours / which caule yt bred and wyne / as Christ and his apostels did. And though some sophysters wolde wreast their sayings and expound them after their phantasie / yet shall I allege them one doctour (which was allso pope of Rome) that makyth so playne with vs that they shalbe compelled with shame to holde their tonges. For pope Gelasius wryteth on this maner. Certe sacramenta que. sumimus corporiset sanguinis

And yt ys named to be don the same daye thorough the celebracyon of the sacrament (thorough kepynge the memoryall of the thyng once don̄) which ys not don that daye / but was don longe agoon.

Iff a man wolde auoyde contencyon and loke soberly on thosse wordes of Sayncte Austen / he shall sone perceyue the mysterye of thys matter. For euyn as the next good frydaye shalbe caulled the day of Christes passyon: and yet he shall not suffer deth agayne vppō that daye / for he dyed but onece and ys nowe immortall? euyn so ys the sacrament called Chrystes bodye. And as that daye ys not the verye daye that he dyed on / but onlye a remembrance therof / So the sacrament ys not hys verye naturall bodye / but onlye a remembrance of hys bodye breakynge and bloude she dynge. And lykewyse / as the next ester daye shall be called the day of hys resurrectyon / not that yt ys the very same daye that Chryste dyd ryse in / but a remembraunce of the same.

Euyn so the sacrament ys called hys bodye: not that yt ys hys bodye in dede / but only a remembrāce of the same. And furdermore euyn as the prest doth offer hym / that ys to saye crucyfye hym at masse / euyn so ys the sacramēt his

Now maye you not take Paule that he in this place shuld derectly expound Christis mynde. And that the verie exposicion of Christes wordes / whē he sayd this is my bodye / shuld be that yt was the fellowship of his bodye (as some saie wc sekynge the kaye in this place of paule locke them sellffes so faste in / that they can fynde no waye oute) For Christe spake those wordes of his owyn bodye wc shulde be geuyn for vs / but the fellowship of Christes dodye (or congregacyō) was not geuyn for vs. And so he ment not as P

               ule here sayeth / but ment hys owyn bodye. For as Paule calleth the bred oure bodye for a certayne propertie / euyn so doth Chryste calle yt his bodye for certayne other properties In that the brede was broken / yt was christes owyn bodye signifying that as that bred was broken / so shulde his bodye be brokyn for vs. In that yt was distributed vnto his disciples yt was his owyn bodie / signifyinge that as verelye as that bred was destrib

                bodie signifieng that

we though we be manie / are made one brede that is to saye one bodie. And in that the wine is made one wyne of manye grapes / yt is our bodye signifieng that though we are manie yet in christe and thorough Christe we are made one bodie and membres to eche other.

               d because of this propertie that yt is made one of manie euin so doth Christe call yt his bodye because of the ꝓpertyes before rehersed. Furthermore in this they agre / that as Paulles wordes / muste be taken spūallye (for I thinke there is no man so mad / as to Iudge that the bred is our bodye in dede although in that proꝑtie yt rep̄senteth our bodie). Euyn so muste Christes wordes be vnderstond spirituallye that in thosse properties yt representeth his verye bodie. Now when we come to gether to receyue this brede then by the receyuing of yt in the congregacion / we do openlye testifie that we all (wc receyue yt) are one bodye / ꝓfessing one god / one faith &amp; one baptyme / and that the bodie of Christe was broken and his bloude shed for remission of oure sinnes Now sith we so do / we maye not a cōpanye nor sit in the congregacion or fellowship of thē that offer vnto ydolles and eate before them. For as Paule sayeth / ye can not drinke the cupe of the lorde and the cupe of the deuells:Paule. ye can not be partakers of the table of the lorde and of the table of the deuylles. I wold not that you shuld haue felowship wt deuelles. The hethen whiche offerred vnto Idolles were the fellowship of deuellis

/ not because they eate the deuelles bodye or drāke the deueles bloude / but because they beleued &amp; put their confydens in the ydole or deuill as ī their god and all that were of that faith hade their ceremonies / &amp; gaue hart ye thākes to their god wt that feaste wc they kept.

And then they sate downe and eate the offeryng to gether geuyng prayse and thankes vnto their God / and were one bodye and one fellowship of the deuell whyche they testiffye by eating of that offeringe before that idolle. Now dothe s, Paule reprehend the Corinthiās for berynge the gyntiles cōpanie in eatinge before the idolle. For they knowe that the meate was like other meate.

So that in this place and fellowship maye no man eate nor drynke with vs / but he that is of our fayth &amp; knowelegeth thesame god that we doo. As by example / yf mā were

Nowe I saye / that this banket is more then another meale / for at this banket his enemyes maye be loth to come / because they can not reioyse at his cominge home / &amp; therfore can not make good chere amōge them / testifying that he is welcome home: but reather abhorreth the meate and drinke that is there eaten because their hart doth not fauoure the parson for whose sake yt is prepared. Natwtstondinge yf a capons legge were reserued for one of hys ennemyes and afterward geuyn hym whan the banket were don / he might lawfullye eate yt. For then yt were but bare meate suche as he eatyeh home. And likewise the ennemyes of christe which beleue not that they haue remissyon of sinnes thorough his bloude sheding / can not reioise of his bodye breaking. And therfore can not make good chere amonge them / but yf any be reserued after the maundye / he maye lawfullye eate yt for yt is but bred. And his loueres that are ther present do rather come thider to geue hī his welcome home then for the meate / and they more eate his welcome home then the meate.

But yf any of his enemyes fortune to be there / they eate onlye the meate / ād not his welcom home. For they reioyse not at his cōmynge home. Lykewise the faithfull that are there present / doo rather come thether to reioyse in the fayth of his bodye breakyng / then in breakinge or eatinge of the bred or meate. But yf any of the vnfaythfull fortune to be there they eate only the brede / and not his bodie breakyng. For they reioyse not at his bodie breakinge. Here ꝑaduenture some wold suppose that I were contrarye to my sellfe. For before I sayd / that yt was more then meate that was 
                  •
               aten at the gētiles feaste / &amp; more then meate that was eatē at my neighboures welcome home / &amp; more then bred that ys eaten at the receyuing of the sacramēt of the bodie &amp; bloude of christe. And nowe I saye / that yf a mās enemie be there / he eateth onlye the meate and not the welcom home. And lykewise the vnfaythfull eateth onlye brede and not the bodye and bloude of Christe. How maye these wordes stonde to gether? I answer / that they eate but onlye bred or meate that profyteth them / but in dede they eate more to theyr hynderaunce / and euyn there owyn dampnacyon. For they that did eate in the fellowship of gentiles / dit but onlye eate the meate to there profyte / but in eatynge theyr meate their facte dyd openly testyfye that they honoured that Idolle for ther GOD (althought their herte were other wise) wherin they comitted Idolatrye.1.

               The seconde poynte wherin Frith dissenteth from oure prelates and their proctoure.
               THe prelates beleue that his verie fleshe is p̄sent to the teth of thē that eate the sacrament / and that the wicked eate his verye bodye Frith sayth that yt is none article of our Crede and therfore he rekenith that he is in no Ieoperdye though he beleue yt not. And he thinketh that his fleshe is not p̄sent vnto the teth of thē that receyue the sacrament. For hys fleshe ys onlye in one place at once. And that he proue

                  h both by the auctorite of Sainct Austen ad Dardanum / and also by the auctorite of Fulgentius ad Thrasuuādum libro 20. as before apereth in the boke. And Fryth sayth that the wicked eate not hys verye fleshe allthough they receue the sacrament. And that he proueth by the scripture / doctoures and good reason grounded vppon the scryptures.
               The scripture is this / he that eateth christesIoan. 6 bodie hath euerlastīge liffe / but the wicked hath not euerlastinge liffe / ergo then the wicked eate not his bodye. Agayne the scrypture sayeth he that eateth christes fleshe &amp; drinketh his bloude abydeth in christe &amp; christe in hī but the wicked abyde not in christe nor christe ī hī / ergo the wicked eate not his fleshe nor drinke his bloude.
               
                   This maye also be confyrmed by good auctorite.August

                  And euen the same wordes hathe beda vppon the tenth chapter of the fyrste pistle to the Corinthians.
               
                  Augusti. de ciuitate Dei in libro. 21. cap. 25.Agayne. s. Austene sayeth / he that abideth not in me &amp; in whom I abyde not / let him not saye nor thinke / that he eateth my bodye or drinketh my bloude. And euen the same wordes hath Beda vppon the sixt chapter of the firste epistle to the Corinthiās. And euen the same sentēce hath Ambrose / and Prosper / ād Beda vppon the .xi chapter of the firste pistle to the Corinthians.
               Finallye this maye be proued by good reason grounded vppon the scripture. Christ wold not suffer marye (though she loued him well) to touche him / because she lacked one poynt of faythe / and did not beleue that he was equale wt his father. And therfore be reason yt muste followe / that he wil not suffer the wicked (wc nether haue good faith nor loue towardes hī) both to touche him and eate him in to their vnclene bodies
               Now sith this is proued true that the wicked eate not his bodie / yt must also therof nedes followe / that the sacramēt is not his naturall bodie For they do eate the sacramēt as all men knowe
               Besides that the faithfull do not eate christes bodye wt their teth. And therfore yt muste followe that the wicked do not eate yt wt ther teth. The antecedēt or first ꝑte of the reason is ꝓued by the wordes of christe wc saith that the fleshe ꝓfiteth nothinge at all / meaning that yt doth not ꝓfite as they vnderstode him:Ioan. 6 that is to saie / yt

profiteth nothinge to be eaten carnallie wt their teth &amp; bellye / as they vnderstode him. For els yt profyteth moche to be eatē spūallye / that ys to saye / to beleue that thorough his bodye breakinge and bloud shedinge oure sinnes are purged. And thus doth Origene / s. Aus

                  ye the bred and there dāpnacyon / because they eate him not spūallie: that is / because they beleue not in his bodie breakinge and bloude shedinge.
            
            
               ¶The third poynt wherin Frith dissenteth from your prelates and their proctoure.
               THe p̄lates beleue that men oughte to worship the sacrament but Frith saith naye / ād affyrmith that yt is Idolatrye to worship yt

                   And he sayth that Christ and hys appostyllis taught vs not so to do: nether did the holy fathers so teache vs. And Frith saith that the auctoures of this worshipinge are the childerne of ꝑdicion wc haue ouerwhelmed this worlde wt synne. Neuerthelesse we muste receyue yt reuerentlye because of the doctrine that yt bryngith vs. For it preacheth christes deth vnto vs / &amp; discribeth yt before oure eyen / euen as a faithfull p̄char by the worde doth in still yt in to vs by our eares ād hearing.

            ¶The conclusion of this treatise.
            
               NOwe deare brethern I beseche you for the mercye that ye loke fore in Christ Iesu / that you accept thys worke wt a syngle eye and no contentyons harte For necessite hath cōpelled me to wryte yt / because I was informed both of my lorde of winchester and other creadyble persons / that I had by the meanes of my fyrst treatise offended many men. Which thinge maye well be true: For yt was to slender to enstructe all thē wc haue sins sene yt / alb
                  •
                yt yt were suffecyent for their vse to whom yt was fyrst deliuered, And therfore I thought yt not onlye expedient but also necessarie / to enstructe them further in the truth / that they might se plaine euidēce of that thing wher in they were offended.
            By this wearke you shall espye their blasphemies &amp; the venemous tonges wher wt they s
                  •
               launder not onlye them that publyshe the truthe / but euyn the truth yt seelfe. They shame not to saye / that we affyrme yt to be onlye bred and nothinge els. And we saye not so: but we saye that besyde the substance of bred / yt is the sacrament of Christes bodye and bloud. As the yuye hangyng

before the tauerne doore ys more then bare yuye. For beside the substance of yuye / yt ys a signe / and signifyeth that there is wyne to be sould. And this sacrament signifyeth vnto vs and poynteth oute before oure eyes that as verely as that bred is broken / so verely was christes bodye broken for our synnes: And as that bred is distributed vnto vs / so is hys bodie and fructe of hys passyon distributed vnto all hys faythfull. And as the bred comforteth the bodie so doth the fayth in Christes deth cōforte oure soules. And as surelye as we haue that bred and eate yt wyth oure mouth and teth / and knowe by our senses that we haue yt wt in vs / and are partakers therof: no more nede we to doubte of hys bodye and bloud / but that thorough fayth / we are as sure of thē / as we are sure of that bred As yt is sufficientlye declared in my boke.
            Agayne you maye perceyue how wyckydlye they report on vs wc affyrme that we dishonoure yt wc geue yt the right honoure that yt ought to haue. And you do playnlye dishonoure yt / wc geue vnto yt the honoure that is onlye dew vnto god. We geue yt the same honoure that we geue vnto the holye scripture &amp; worde of god / because yt expresseth vnto our senses the deth of our sauyoure / and doth more dypelye prent yt wt in vs. And therfore we calle yt an holye sacrament / as we calle goddes worde / holye scripture. And we receyue this sacrament wt great reuerence / euyn as we reuerrentlye reade or heare preached the holye worde of God wc conteyneth the helth of o

hys bodye ys present with the bred as yt ys wt th

                word / and with both yt ys verelye receyued and eaten thorough fayth. But yf we shuld knele downe and praye vnto the holye scrypture / men might count vs soles / and might lawfullye saye / that we do not honoure the s

And yet in dede oure outeward baptyme

doth but signifie / that we haue put christe vppon vs. But by the inward baptime (which is the water of liffe and spirite of god) we haue in dede put him vppon vs and lyue in hym and he in vs. Whiche notwithstondynge ys verye false for all the outeward baptyme / in them that receyue yt not in fayth. And vnto them yt is but abare sygne / Wherof they get no profyte / but dampnacyon.
            And here you maye euydentlye ꝑceyue howe yt ys some tyme in scripture ascrybed vnto the outeward worke &amp; ceremonye / wc ys onlye true in the inward veryte. And this place shall expound all the old doctoures whiche seame contrarye to our sentense, And therfore Marke yt well.
            Thus haue you my mynde further vppō the sacrament of the bodie and bloud of Christe. Wherin yf you reaken that I haue byn to longe in repeting one thinge so often / I shall praie you of pardon. But surelie me thought I cold not be shorter. For the worlde is suche now a dayes that some wolde heare and can not: and some do heare and will not. And therfore I am cōpelled so often to repete that thinge whiche a wise man wolde vnderstond with halue the wordes.

Notwtstonding I wolde not that any shulde counte that I make my saynge (whiche is the negatiue) any artycle of the faythe. For euen as I saye that you oughte not to make any necessary article of y• faythe of youre parte (whiche is the affyrmatiue). So I saye agayne / that we make none necessary article of the faithe of owre parte / but leue yt indifferent for all men to Iudge therin / as God shall open his harte / and no syde to condempne or dispise the tother / but to nourishe in all thinges brotherlye loue / and to beare others infyrmytes.
               The texte of saīt Austyn whiche they ther alegyd agenst me / was this:S. Austins tex. that in the sacrament Christe was borne in his owne handes. Whervnto I sayd / that s. Austyn dothe full well expounde him sellfe. For in a nother place he saythe Ferebatur tan

                      in manibus suis. That is / he was borne after a certen maner / in his owne handes And by that he saythe after a certen maner / ye may sone perceaue what he meanythe.
               How be yt yf s. Austyn had not thus expoundid hym sellfe / yet the saythe ad Bonifacin̄ / that the sacrament of a thinge / hathe a similitude or propertie of the thinge whiche yt sygnifyethe. And for that cause yt hathe many tymes / the name of the verye thīge which yt sygnifieth.

                  Beholde he cause of my dethe.The cause of my dethe is this / because I can not in consciens abiure and swere / that our prelates

opinion of the sacrament (that is / that the substaunce of brede and wine is verely chaunged in to the fleshe and bloude of our sauiour Iesus Christ) is an vndouted / article of the faythe / necessary to be beleauid vnder paine of dāpnacyon.

               ¶The cause why I can not beleue there opinion of transmutacion is this.

                      The second cause is this / because I will not bynde the congregacion of Chris

                     s to be of necessite vnder payne of dampnacion.
                  
                      The thirde cause is / because I dare not be so presumptuous in entering in to goddes Iudgment / as to make the prelates in this poynte an

necessary article of oure faythe. For then I shulde dampnably condempne all the germanes ād Allmaynes / wyth infinite moo / whyche in deade do not bealeue nor thyncke that the substance of brede and wine ys chaunged in to the substance of Christes naturall body. And surely I can not be so folishe hard
                        •
                      as to condempne suche an infinite nombre for oure prelates pleasures.
               
               Thus all the Germaynes and Allmaynes / bothe of Lutherrs syde and also of Oecolampadius / doo hooly approue my mater. And surely I thincke ther ys noman that hathe a pure conscience / but he wyll thyncke that I dye ryghtuously. For that this transubstāciation shuld be a necessary article of the faythe / I thyncke no man can say yt wt a good conscience / all though yt were true in dede.
