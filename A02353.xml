            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).

            TO THE RIGHT REVEREND, MOST GRAVE, LEARned, and worthy Prelate, and Father in GOD, My Lord Bishop of Winchester.
            
            
               
                  AS in the Creation darknes went before light, or as the dawning precedes the brightnesse of the day, &amp; as Ioseph obscurely at first behaued himselfe vnto his Brethren, and Moses couered with

a vaile stood before the people: Euen so (Right Reuerend) in the detection of the glorious worke of mans Redemption, mysticall promises went before mercifull performance, darke shaddowes were the fore-runners of that bright substance, obscure types were harbingers to that glorious Anti-type the Messiah, who was comming after, and Leui's Law with its figuratiue and vailed Ceremonies, was the viue resemblance, painting and pointing out that cleere Lampe and Lambe of God, the expresse Image and ingrauen Character of the Father: So that as folded in swaddling clouts, and lying in a Crib, hee was seene and

shewne vnto the Wise-men that came from the East; so inuolued in typicall ordinances, and lurking vnder shaddowish signes, hee was offered and exhibited vnto the Iewes that saw his day but afarre off; the eclipsed and dimme light of the Moone (as it were) as yet onely glimmering, or the twinkling brightnesse of starry Lamps as yet onely dazedly glistering: Vntill the true Phosphorus, that glorious Sunne himselfe did arise in the Horizon of our humanitie, dispersing the beames of his bounty, and manifesting himselfe to be that onely light of the world, promised to them that sit in the Region of darknesse, for comfort and

illumination, and to the ioy of all in heauen and earth, the Lambe himselfe onely opening that sealed Booke, and vnfolding the truth of former hid mysteries.
            
            
               Then that Ladder of Heauen, and Leader to glory, was more brightly seene, then Iacob saw the same formerly in a dreame. Then that true Tree of Life planted in the earth of our nature, was plainly viewed without the limits of that heauenly Paradise. Then that heauenly Manna which the Father gaue from aboue, most aboundantly offered it selfe, vnto the refreshment of all hungring Israelites. And that blessed Rock from Citie to Citie, and place to place

following them, most cleerely gushed out the comfortable waters of Life, for euery one to drinke, and neuer to thirst after. Then the true curing Serpent was graciously re-erected on high for all men to behold with the eye of Faith, and then all the Mosaicall sacrifices, and rudimentall Rites, which like the Baptist, pointed out Christ Iesus to bee that Lambe of God that takes away the sinnes of the world, vnfolded themselues in their former darke shaddowish signification, and while they remained in vigour, albeit (like Zacharie before his sonnes birth) they were dumbe and obscure signers, yet ceasing, and in their departure

(the substantiall body filling vp the roome) with their eternall farewell, opening their mouth as it were, they said that which before they signed, and gaue a heartie congratulation and welcome to their accomplishing verity, as night giues place to day; Leui thus yeelding to a more excellent High Priest; and Hagar the bondwoman, vnto her free Dame Sarah.
            
               Herein how Euangelicall light hath discouered the meaning of Legall obscuritie; and how Aarons Bells sounded neuer but Christ Iesus and him Crucified; nor his siluer Trumpets, but the ioyfull Iubile of soules freedome; his many sacrifices pointing out

that one all-sufficient: And how the successiue diuersitie of types of sundry things, places, persons, and actions, &amp;c. from time to time couchedly involued, and cunningly conueyed, the blessed mysterie and deepe secret of the abysse of vnsearchable loue to mankinde, and extense of mercy past comprehending, as by secret water-spouts from posterity to posterity, for continuance of the vigorous hope of the faithfull; who with Simeon longed to see the Saluation of the Lord Herein, I say, the paines that I haue taken, is briefely (for the case of the Reader) to point onely (as it were) at the same in order as they occurre in Scripture, ioyning
               
               with succinct breuity to auoid tediousnes, as great plainnesse and perspicuitie as I could, to auoid 
               Marke. 
               obscurenesse. And comparing some things for conueniencie of case onely (which prettily may be so compared) wherein I acknowledge in the purpose of the Holy Ghost a typicall resemblance euer, of any answerable verity is not to be sought. And keeping still in all (I hope) the Analogy of faith, as the right measure of the Temple, the patterne on the Mount, and iust Ballance of the Sanctuary.
            
            
               This Treatise then (Right Reuerend and most worthy Prelate) as a testimony of my most indeared affection, I haue dedicate to your

Lordship, and shrowded the same vnder the wings of your Learned patrocinie, by experience hauing in my own person found (especially at your Lordships late beeing in Scotland) yet more thē courteous regard, and most kinde respectiuenesse euer vsuall by your Lordship towards all, but chiefely towards those who are Fellow-labourers in the Sacred dispensation af that holy mysterie with you: Whereby not onely I, but the hearts of many with me, who had that happy occasion of your Lordships acquaintance, are so warmed (though vnder a cold Climate) and inflamed with the Reuerend memory of your Lordships humanitie, and

other singular holy vertues, and rare gifts (wherewith your good GOD hath indued you; and which as a strong chaine hath linked so that singular regard of your Prince vnto you, as that sooner, I perswade my selfe, their bodies shall beginne to resolue into ashes, then that fire of affection in their conquered and captiued hearts shall cease, to bee vigorous and burne.

your Censure, and to bee disposed as your Lordship shall thinke fit thereof. Of whose most gentle and gracious acceptation, as I rest assured: So, as for others, I hope, Christian loue, and charitable affection shall be my Censurer of all, regarding chiefely my honest ayme herein. And where others are inabled to do better, or to amend my Labours, beseeching the Lord to inable them more &amp; more, and to enlighten my minde with them, that mine eyes being anointed with the eye-salue of his Spirit, with Dauid I may know the secrets of his Law, and that neither I may enuy their rich gift with an euill eye, nor yet despise my owne poore mite with a

wicked heart: but indeuouring to gaine something with my small Talent vnto my bountifull Master, I may not incur neither the bitter reproofe, nor deserued iudgement of an euil or vnprofitable seruant at his hands. Beseeching which God to thrust out many faithfull Laborers into his Haruest, and to continue your Lordship in a long and happy life, with a success-full blessing vpon your Lordships gouernment &amp; trauels, to the cōfor

                        The Congruitie.
                        
                           
                              
                                 1 AS it was called the Tree of Life.
                                 
                                    So Christ is that true Tree of Life, giuing the fruit &amp; iuice both of grace and glory, Ioh. 15. 1.
                              
                              
                                 2. It was in the midst of the Garden.
                                 
                                    So Christ is to be found in the midst of his Church, Mat. 18. 20.
                              
                              
                                 3. It was in the earthly Paradise planted.
                                 
                                    So Christ is in the heauenly placed, Mar. 16. 19:
                              
                              
                                 4. Adam in his standing might eate of the Tree of Life (as of all other trees, sauing that one which was forbidden.) Gen. 2. 16.
                                 
                                    So shall the godly that perseuere, eate of that true Tree of Life promised, Ren. 2. 7.
                              
                              
                              
                                 5. Sinne exiled man out of the earthly Paradise from the fruition of the one, Gen. 3. 24.
                                 
                                    So sinne doth out of the heauenly, from the fruition of the other, Ioh. 15. 6.
                              
                              
                                 6. Adam condemned once to be expelled from the same, got no regresse, Gen. 3. 24.
                                 
                                    So neither man in iudgement once debarred from heauen and Christ, shall haue no recouerie, Math. 25. 41.
                              
                              
                                 7. The Lord only planted the one, making it to grow out of the earth.
                                 
                                    So also did he the other in the earth of our humanitie, Ioh. 1. 14. who did increase in wisedome, stature, and fauour both with God and Man, Luke 2. 52.
                              
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        The Disparitie.
                        1. THat tree of Life endured but for a time: but our Tree of Life endureth for euer, Heb. 7. 24. Secondly, it could not restore life againe to Adam, beeing onely the Sacrament of the Couenant of life in case of perseuerance: but our Tree of Life Christ Iesus restoreth life lost, to his owne chosen; yea,

a better life then Adams in Paradise. And since hee is the end of the Law to them that beleeue, Rom. 10. hee now becomes to vs by the couenant of Grace, the true Tree of Life, performing that, which that of workes could not attaine vnto, by reason of mans fall.
                     
                  
                  
                     2. Adam, Rom. 5. 14.
                     
                        
                           
                              1. ADAM, man, red earth, or bloudie.
                              
                                 So was Christ Man in his Incarnation, and bloudie in his Passion, Mat. 1. &amp; 27.
                           
                           
                              2. Adam, man, without womans bearing, and so without a Mother.
                              
                                 So Christ Man, without mans begetting, and so without a father, Mat. 1. 20.
                           
                           
                              3. Adams Father onely God, Gen. 2. 7.
                              
                                 So likewise Christs, Iohn 8. 16.
                           
                           
                              4. Adam made Lord ouer the creatures, and heyre of the outmost bounds of the earth.
                              
                                 So is Christ that truely, Psal. 2.
                           
                           
                           
                              5. Adam was appointed to dresse the Garden and keepe it, Gen. 2. 16.
                              
                                 So Christ, to sanctifie and saue his Church, 1. Cor. 1. 30.
                           
                           
                              6. Adam was sent out of Paradise, for his sinne committed, to endure painfull labours, Gen. 3. 23. but vnwillingly.
                              
                                 So was Christ sent from the heauens for our sinnes imputed, to indure painfull sufferings, Isai. 53. yet most willingly.
                              
                           
                           
                              7. Thornes were made a curse to the one, Gen. 3. 17.
                              
                                 So were they made a crowne to the other, Mat. 27. 29.
                           
                           
                              8. The sweat of the brow was in labour imposed on the one, Gen. 3. 19.
                              
                                 So the sweat of bloud in agony was imposed on the other, Luke 22. 44.
                           
                           
                              9. Adam sleeping, Euah was formed, Gen. 2. 21.
                              
                                 So Christ dying on the Crosse, his Church was framed.
                              
                           
                           
                              10. Adam giues to his, that which is his owne by generation, Gen. 5. 3.
                              
                                 So Christ doth to his, that which is his owne, by Regeneration, Rom. 1. 17. Gal. 2. 17.
                           
                           
                           
                              11. We haue borne already heere the image of the earthly.
                              
                                 So shall wee beare the Image of the heauenly, 1. Cor. 15. 49.
                           
                           
                              12. Adam created to the Image of God, Gen. 1. 27.
                              
                                 So Christ incarnate, the ingrauen Character of his Father, Col. 1. 15. Heb. 1. 3.
                           
                           
                              13. Adam was King, Priest, and Prophet, in his Family.
                              
                                 So is Christ the same in his Church and family of the faithfull, Reu. 1
                                    •…
                                 . Rom. 3. Heb. 9. 13.
                           
                           
                              14. Adam had Cain and Abel in his house, Gen. 4.
                              
                                 So hath Christ Elect, and Reprobates, true worshippers and Hypocrites in his visible Church, Math. 13. 24.
                           
                           
                              15. Adam had perfect wisedome and knowledge, as may be seene in naming of all the creatures, Ge. 2. 19.
                              
                                 So in Christ dwelleth the fall treasure of both, Col. 2. 3.
                           
                           
                              16. Likewise as by the offence of the one, the fault came on all men to condemnation, and many were made sinners.
                              
                                 So by the iustifying of the other, the benefit abounded toward all men, to the iustification of life; so that by his obedience, shall many be made righteous, Rom. 5. 18. that as sinne had
                                 
                                 raigned vnto death; so might grace also raigne by righteousnes vnto eternall life, through Iesus Christ our Lord.
                              
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        The Disparitie.
                        BVt yet the gift is not so, as is the offence: for if through the offence of Adam many be dead; much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man Iesus Christ, hath abounded vnto many. Neither is the gift so, as that which entred in by one that sinned. For the fault came of one offence vnto Condemnation: but the gift is of many offences vnto Iustification. For if by the offence of one, death raigned through one; much more shall they which receiue that abundance of grace, and gift of that righteousnes, raigne in life through one, that is, Iesus Christ, Rom. 5. 15, 16, 17. Likewise the first man was of the earth, earthly and naturall; but the second man is the Lord from heauen, heauenly and spirituall, 1. Cor. 15. 47. and as is the earthly, such are they that are earthly, and as is the heauenly, such are they that are heauenly, verse 48. Also the first man Adam
                           
was made a liuing soule, but the last Adam was made a quickning Spirit, 1. Cor. 15. 45.
                     
                  
                  
                     3. Abel, Gen. 4.
                     
                        
                           
                              1. ABEL, or Habel, mourning or vanitie.
                              
                                 Such was the life of Christ, a mourning for our vanitie and wickednesse, Mat. 26. Mar. 8.
                           
                           
                              2. Abel offered an acceptable sacrifice vnto the Lord, Heb. 11. Gen. 44.
                              
                                 So did Christ vpon the Altar of the Crosse, Rom. 3. 25. when hee offered vp himselfe, Heb. 7. 27.
                           
                           
                              3. Abel was a Shepheard, Gen. 4. 2.
                              
                                 So Christ is the true Shepheard of our soules. 1. Pet. 2. 15.
                           
                           
                              4. Abel was slaine by his brother Cain in the field innocently, after he had spoken to him, Gen. 4. 8.
                              
                                 So was Christ by his brethren according to the flesh (the Iewes) without the Citie, after they had falsely accused him, Lu. 23
                           
                           
                              5. After Abels death till Seth and Enosh, true worship and Religion by Cains seede was long time suppressed, Gen. 4. 26.
                              
                                 So after Christs death, was Christianitie vnder the Heathen Emperours long persecuted, Reu. 12. Euseb.
                           
                           
                           
                              6. And as after the restauration of true worship, corruption of life crept in, and brought the deluge vpon the Primitiue world, Gen. 6.
                              
                                 So after the truth was by Lawes established vnder Christian Emperours, (open persecution ceasing) secretly and slyly corruption of life and doctrine crept in, and brought a deluge of miseries and darknes vpon the visible Church, Centuriae Ecclesiae.
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        The Disparitie.
                        
                           ABels sacrifice was onely for himselfe: but that of Christs, for the sins of the world. Abel was priuily murthered: but Christ publikely suffered. Abels bloud cryed to the Lord for reuenge &amp; wrath: but the bloud of sprinkling shed by Christ, speaketh better things then that of Abel, Heb. 12. 24.
                     
                  
                  
                     4. Enoch, Gen. 5. 21.
                     
                        
                           
                              1. ENOCH, dedicate.
                              
                                 So was Christ dedicate and decreed to be that Sauiour of mankinde, Isai. 25. 9.
                           
                           
                           
                              2. Enoch walked with God, Gen. 5. 22.
                              
                                 So did Christ in all perfection of sanctimonie and righteousnes, Isay 53. 7.
                           
                           
                              3. Enoch pleased God, and was beloued of him, Wisd. 4. 10.
                              
                                 So did Christ his Father, and is declared to bee his welbeloued, in whom he was well pleased, Math. 3. 17.
                           
                           
                              4. Enoch was matchlesse in his age, so that none was like him, Ecclus. 49. 14.
                              
                                 So was Christ through all ages, and euer shall bee peerelesse, none daring to compare with him, Iohn 3. 35.
                           
                           
                              5. In order of Historie, take those that dyed first, he is reported and brought in as one that saw not death, but was translated, Gen. 5. 24.
                              
                                 To yeeld that comfort to the Church, &amp; type Christ therein, who should make death to be swallowed vp in victorie, and immortalitie, and to assure vs also of the Resurection, Col. 1. 18. Rom. 4. 25.
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        The Disparitie.
                        
                           ENoch's righteousnes did not auaile others, but that of our Sauiours doth auaile vs, and becommeth others. His translation likewise was comfortatiue, and typicall: but

the Resurrection of Christ to vs, is operatiue and effectuall.
                        Note also, that Enochs translation before the Law, and Eliahs vnder the Law, are types and pledges (as it were) of that last translation of them vnder the Gospell, that shall be found aliue at the Lords second Comming.
                     
                  
                  
                     
                        Noah, Gen. 5. 32.
                     
                        
                           
                              1. NOah, ceasing or rest.
                              
                                 So Christ hath caused Gods wrath to cease, and giueth rest thereby to the troubled conscience. Mat. 3
                           
                           
                              2. Noah liued in a most corrupt time, and generall defection both in doctrine and manners, Gen. 6. 5.
                              
                                 So did Christ Iesus vpon earth in a like age, as appeares, Math. 5. 6. 7, chap.
                           
                           
                              3. Noah was acquainted with the Lords Decree, Gen. 6. 13.
                              
                                 So was Christ fully with the will of his Father, Iohn 1.
                           
                           
                           
                              4. Noah was a Preacher of Righteousnes to the wicked world, 1. Pet. 3.
                              
                                 So was Christ the same, exhorting them to repent: for the Kingdome of God was at hand, Luke 2. 32. Isay 60. 1.
                           
                           
                              5. Noah by his obedience saued al that entred within his Arke, Gen. 6. 23.
                              
                                 So doth Christ al those, that by a true Faith doe enter into his Church, 1. Tim. 1. 15.
                           
                           
                              6. Noahs Arke was tossed vpon the waters.
                              
                                 So is the Church of Christ in this world, by diuers temptations and persecutions, Ioh. 16.
                           
                           
                              7. In Noahs Arke were cleane, and vncleane also, were Sem, and Iapheth, ver. 7, 8.
                              
                                 So in Christs visible Church are Hypocrites, and true Beleeuers; Iewes also and Gentiles, Ephes. 2. Math. 13.

                              10. Noah hauing built his Arke, the floud did come, which destroyed the first world, verse 21.
                              
                                 So the number of Christs Church beeing accomplished, the fire shall come to destroy the second world.
                              
                           
                           
                              11. Noah made his Arke of many Trees, closely seamed together, strong, fresh, and dressed, verse 14.
                              
                                 So hath Christ compacted his Church of many members, vnited by the bond of the Spirit, strengthened with Grace, freed from the domining corruption of sinne, and sanctified by the Holy Ghost, Gal. 3. 7.
                           
                           
                              12. Noah had sundry roomes in his Arke, Ibidem.
                              
                              
                                 So Christ hath sundry functions in his Church, 1. Cor. 12.
                           
                           
                              13. Noah pitched his Arke within and without against the waters.
                              
                                 So hath Christ fortified his Church sufficiently against all temptations, Ioh. 15.
                           
                           
                              14. Noah made one doore onely to his Arke, verse 16.
                              
                                 So hath Christ appointed one onely entry to his Church, Iohn 10. 7.
                           
                           
                           
                              15. Noahs Arke had little outward light, Ibid.
                              
                              
                                 So neither is the light of Christs Church, worldly carnall wisedome, Ro. 8. 7.
                           
                           
                              16. Noah abode in the Arke all the time of the tossing thereof.
                              
                                 So doth Christ remaine in the midst of his Church, beeing with them to the worlds end, in all tentations and afflictions thereof, Iohn 14. 18.
                           
                           
                              17. Noah saued few in his Arke, in respect of the world.
                              
                                 So the number that are to be saned in Christs Church is but a handfull likewise, Math. 22. 14.
                           
                           
                              18. The Wrights that built the Arke, notwithstanding perished.
                              
                                 So many Preachers in the Church may likewise be damned, Math. 7. 22.
                           
                           
                              19. All sorts of creatures Noah receiued into the Arke.
                              
                                 So all sorts of persons and Nations, Christ accepteth into his Church, Ephes. 2. 18.
                           
                           
                              20. In the dayes of Noah, defection from true Religion, oppression, sensualitie, and securitie, after 1656. yeeres, brought on the first destruction on the world.
                              
                                 So the like sinnes non raigning, about the like time, is like to bring on the second Iudgement on the latter world, Math. 24.
                           
                           
                           
                              21. Those that were saued, was by beeing within the Arke, in the waters.
                              
                                 Figuring that those that are redeemed, must enter into the Church by Baptisme, 1. Pet. 3. 20.
                           
                           
                              22. Noahs tossings vpon the waters being ended, he sent out the Doue, Gen. 8. 12.
                              
                                 So Christs sufferings being finished, be sent out his Spirit into the world, to comfort and leade his own, Iohn 14.
                           
                           
                              23. Noah offered a Sacrifice vnto the LORD, wherein he smelled a sauour of rest, verse 21.
                              
                                 So hath Christ vnto his Father, whereby his wrath is fully appeased, Ro. 3. 25.
                           
                           
                              24. With Noah God made a Couenant to his posteritie, and cōfirmed it with a signe, Gen. 9. 9.
                              
                                 So in Christ with the Church hath the Lord made a new Couenant of mercy, and ratified it with Sacraments, Mat. 3. 17.
                           
                           
                              25. The couer of the Arke being taken off, and Noahs Family going out of the same (after the Deluge

dryed vp) increased and multiplyed wonderfully, Gen. 10.
                              
                                 So the time of the true Churches lurking beeing ended, and the hid marked ones bursting forth, after the Deluge of darknesse, dryed vp in a good measure,
                                 
                                 the Church shall become more and more visible, and increase, to the abridging of Antichrists power dayly, Reu. 19.
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        The Disparitie.
                        
                           NOah preached, but conuerted none of the first world: but not so Christ, by whose voice many were turned, and dayly by the efficacie thereof are brought into his Church. Noahs Arke likewise putrified and perished at last; but neuer shall the Church of Christ so perish or decay. The tossing of the waters did weare and make the Arke worse; but tryals and afflictions doe better euer the Church, Psal. 119.

                              4. Abraham deliuered Lot &amp; many captiues by a great victorie, Gen. 14. 61.
                              
                                 So Christ hath deliuered his chosen from sinne, Satan, and damnation, and freed them wonderfully, Luke 1. 71. Ioh. 16. 33.

                              8. Abraham interceded for the righteous in Sodome, Gen. 18. 25. and for the wicked for their sake.
                              
                                 So is Christ a Mediator continually for the godly in the world, Heb. 8. 6. Ioh. 17. 9. as hee spares also euen the wicked for their sake, and prayed for them that crucified him.

                                 Which onely in Christ Iesus is fully accomplished, Luke 2. 30, Gal. 3.
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        The Disparitie.
                        FRom obscurenesse of estate in Vr of the Caldees, to an honorable and eminent estate in Canaan, Abraham was brought: but from a glorious estate in highest Maiestie, to a base condition in ignominie, was our Sauiour brought for vs: Abrahams wife was barren: but not so is the Church of Christ, which must be fruitfull in good workes. She was taken from Abraham: but none can take the Sheepe of Christ out of his hand, which are his Spouse.
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     7. Circumcision typing Baptisme, our Sanctification, and Christs bloud which is our inward washing, Gen. 17.
                     
                        
                           
                              1. CIrcumcisiō was the signe of Gods Couenant to Israel, Gen. 17. 11.
                              
                                 So Baptisme is the same to the Church, euen a signe and seale of the Couenant of mercy, 1. Pet. 3. 21.
                           
                           
                              2. It was Abraham and his houshold that was comprehended in the one, verse 13.
                              
                                 So is it Christ Iesus his Church that is comprehended in the other, Ibid.
                           
                           
                              3. Not onely was Isaac, but Ismael also circumcised; the born and the bought; the children, and the hirelings, ibid.
                              
                              
                                 So, not onely are the godly baptized outwardly in the visible Church, but the wicked also: not onely the redeemed number, but the naturall sort, the true children, and those that are but hyrelings, Rom. 3. 22.
                           
                           
                              4. Whosoeuer was not circumcised, hauing the Couenant in his flesh, was cut off from Israel, verse 14.
                              
                                 So, whosoeuer contemnes Baptisme, yea, is not in the Spirit renued, is not a true member of the Church of God, Mat. 28. 19, 20.
                           
                           
                           
                              5. There was a circumcision of the flesh which auailed not, being alone; and there was a circumcision of the heart which made the true Israelite, Ro. 2. 28.
                              
                                 So there is an outward Baptism by elementary wa ter, which of the body and beeing alone auailes not, and there is an inward Baptisme of the soule or Spirit, which makes the true Christian, Mar. 16. 16. 1. 8. Rom. 4. 1.
                           
                           
                              6. In circumcision there was a cutting away of the fore-skin by bloud.
                              
                                 Signifying that euen so it is by the bloud of Christ, that our sins are takē away, and by the Spirit of sanctification that wee are renewed, mortifying sinne, and quickning grace in vs, Ephes. 5. 26.
                           
                           
                              7. It was painfull to flesh and bloud.
                              
                                 So is mortification and abandoning of fleshly concupiscence to the carnall man at first, Ioh. 3.
                           
                           
                              8. Infants were circumcised, verse 10.
                              
                                 So also are they to bee baptized, Mark. 10. 14. Rom. 3. 3.
                           
                        
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     
                        Isaac, Gen. 21.
                     
                        
                           
                              1. ISaac, or Iitschac, laughter or reioysing.
                              
                                 So is Christ true matter of ioyfull laughter and reioicing to all the faithfull, Isai. 61. 10.
                           
                           
                              2. Isaac, the sonne of the Father of the faithfull, Gen. 17. 19.
                              
                                 So is Christ the onely naturall Sonne of God, on whom all the faithfull call Abba Father, Mat. 3. 17. Rom. 8.
                           
                           
                              3. Isaac against the course of nature born of the dead wombe of old Sarah, Ge. 21. 3.
                              
                                 So was Christ borne of the inuiolate wombe of a chaste Virgin, Mat. 1. 23. as all those that are his likewise, are borne not of bloud, nor of the will of flesh, nor of man, but of God, Ioh. 1. 13.
                           
                           
                              4. Isaac the seed of Promise made vnto Abraham, and borne in his old age at the time appointed, Gen. 18. 14.
                              
                                 So is Christ the same most properly, in whom all the Nations of the earth are blessed: Borne in the fulnesse of time decreed.
                              
                           
                           
                           
                              5. An Angell announceth the Birth of the one in Sarahs hearing, who thinks it impossible, Ge. 18. 12.
                              
                                 So an Angell doth our Sauiours Birth in Maries, who likewise saith, How shall this be? Luk. 1. 34.
                           
                           
                              6. Isaac was circumcised the eight day, and in his infancie persecuted by Ismael, Gal. 4. 29.
                              
                                 So likewise was Christ, Luke 2. and immediately thereafter persecuted by Herod, Mat. 2.
                           
                           
                              7. Isaac willingly yeeldeth himselfe to be a burnt-offering to the Lord, Gen. 22.
                              
                                 Euen so did Christ, in laying downe his life for satisfying his Fathers iustice, Ioh. 16. 28.
                           
                           
                              8. Isaac carried the wood whereon hee was bound, to Moriah, verse 6.
                              
                                 So did Christ the Crosse whereon he was nayled, to Golgotha, Ioh. 19.
                           
                           
                              9. Thus Isaac was obedient to his Father euen vnto death.
                              
                                 Euen so was Christ that most truely, Phil. 2. 8.
                           
                           
                              10. Isaac came the third day to the place of Immolation, v. 4.
                              
                                 So did Christ to his suffering in the 33. yeere of his age; or thereby consisting of three tens, and
                                 
                                 three vnites: as also neither in the time of the Law of Nature, nor in the written Law: but in the time of Grace, euen that perfect fulnesse of time decreed.
                              
                           
                           
                              11. Isaac onely got the heritage to him and his: and Ismael with others the moueables, Gen. 25. 5, 6.
                              
                                 So hath Christ the heauenly inheritance onely prepared for his Chosen: the wickeds portion beeing worldly things, Psal. 4. 7. Ioh. 17.
                           
                           
                              12. Isaac had Esau and Iacob, who struggled in the wombe of Rebecca, Gen. 25. 22.
                              
                                 So Christ hath Elect and Reprobates in his visible Church, who disagree in manners, Math. 22.
                           
                           
                              13. Isaacs wife was taken of one kindred with himselfe, Gen. 24. 4.
                              
                                 So is Christs Church of that same flesh and nature which he did assume, Mat. 1. 23.
                           
                           
                              14. Isaacs wife was faire, Gen. 26. 7.
                              
                                 So is Christs Church beautifull within, Reu. 21.
                           
                           
                              15. Shee was owed by his fathers seruant and brought vnto him, Gen. 24.
                              
                                 So is the Church by the true Pastors, and brought vnto Christ, dispensatione Verbi, Cant. 1. 7.
                           
                           
                           
                              16. Shee forsaketh all, and vailed, commeth to her Husband, adorned with his Iewels that were giuen vnto her, Gen. 24. 65.
                              
                                 So must the Church forsake all, in preferment of affection; and in humilitie deckt with his graces, must come vnto Christ, Cant. 3.
                           
                           
                              17. Isaac meeteth his Wife, comming to him, Gen. 24. 63.
                              
                                 So doth Christ his Church, with preuenting grace and acceptation, Ephes. 2.
                           
                           
                              18. Her name was Ribekah, which is fed, verse 64.
                              
                                 So is Christ his Church with that heauenly foode and comfort of his Word, Cant. 2. 5.
                           
                           
                              19. Isaac brought her into the Tent of his Mother, and was comforted after her death, vers. 67.
                              
                                 So Christ hath brought the Church of the Gentiles in the place of the Iewes, of whom hee was borne, and doth reioyce concerning their ingrafting, Isaiah 22. 6.
                           
                           
                              20. Isaac was offered, and yet dyed not: for hee was receiued from death after a sort, Heb. 11. 19.
                              
                                 So Christ, God and Man in one Person was offered, and yet according to his Godhead dyed not: but by vertue thereof in his manhood rose from the dead, Math. 28. 6.
                           
                           
                           
                              21. In the hand of the Father, to the sacrificing, was carried the knife and the fire, Gen. 22. 6.
                              
                                 So to the Crosse and Immolation of Christ, in the hand of his Father, likewise went sharp Iustice, and feruent loue withall concurring, Math. 26.
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        The Disparitie.
                        
                           ISaac being waxed old, and through the dimnesse of his eyes, not beeing able to discerne or see, was deceiued by Iacob, who got so the blessing of his elder brother Esau: but our vnalterable all-seeing Iesus can neuer bee deceiued, to bestow the blessing vpon one for another, or place the same wrong.
                     
                     
                        The Allegorie of the Blessing. Gen. 27.
                        AS Isaac loued Esau the elder; so did Christ the Iewes, whom longing to gather vnder his wings, hee called in the latter time, and craued of them that meat which his soule loued, whereof he spoke when hee said; My meat is to doe the will of the Father:

but they went out, hauing not yet returned; and in the meane while the Gentiles (the yonger Brother) entred in, not daring to doe so by their owne presumption: but perswaded by the promises of Grace, hauing the sauourie meat of the merit of their Sauiours death to offer, which they found not without in the world, but prepared within in the Church, and so cloathed with the garments of the elder which is adoption, and right to the promises; their neck and hands couered with the skin of the Kid, which is the remembrance of their sinnes that killed their Sauiour, or which is his perfect righteousnes, they smelled sweetly before their Father, through free acceptation, and obtained the fruitfulnesse of grace, with the assurance of the remission of their sinnes, wherein the blessing consists.

                              1. MElchisedech, a King of righteousnes.
                              
                                 So is Christ that truely, Reu. 15. Heb. 7. 2.
                           
                           
                           
                              2. Also King of Salem, or Peace.
                              
                                 So is Christ Iesus our Prince of Peace, Esa. 9. 6. Heb. 7. 3.
                           
                           
                              3. He was the Priest of the most High God, Gen. 14. 18.
                              
                                 So likewise is Christ, made not after the carnall commandement: but after the power of endlesse life, Heb. 7. 16.
                           
                           
                              4. He was without Father or Mother (viz. mentioned) Heb. 7.
                              
                                 So Christ as God, is

                                 , without a Father.
                              
                           
                           
                              5. He was without Kindred, Ibid.
                              
                              
                                 So likewise Christ according to his Deitie.
                              
                           
                           
                              6. Hee was of another order then Aaron.
                              
                              
                                 So also Christ (and of the same order with Melchisedech) Heb. 7. 16. to shew the imperfection of the Priesthood of Leui, verse 11. &amp; the necessity of the change of the Law, 12.
                           
                           
                              7. Hee continueth Priest for euer, and hath neither beginning of dayes, nor end of life (to wit mentioned) Heb. 7. 3.
                              
                                 So doth Christ continue our High-Priest for euer, whose Priesthood cannot passe from one to another; and therefore is able perfectly to saue th

                                 he euer liueth to make intercession for them, Heb. 7. 24, 25. and whose Priesthood is confirmed by an oath, Psal. 110. to shew that by so much is Iesus made a suretie of a better Testament, Heb. 7. 21, 22.
                           
                           
                              8. He receiued tithe of all from Abraham, and blessed him in whose Ioynes Leui was, Gen. 14. 20.
                              
                                 To shew thereby that as therein hee was greater then Abraham, Heb. 7. 7. so the excellency &amp; greatnes of our High Priest Iesus, aboue Leui or the Priesthood of the Law, (being of one order, as is said, with Melchisedech) by bringing in a better hope, whereby we draw neere to God, and being himselfe vndefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher then the heauens, Heb. 7. 19, 26.
                           
                           
                              9. Hee gaue Bread and Wine to refresh Abraham and his company, after the battell, and not that he offred vp the same as any sacrifice, Gen. 14. 18.
                              
                                 So Christ doth giue his body and bloud for the refreshment of the faithfull receiuers, which once already himselfe offered vp as an all-sufficient sacrifice vpon the Crosse, neu

                              10. Melchisedech was greater then Abraham: and consequently,

then all Israel which then was in his loynes, Heb. 7. 7.
                              
                                 So Christ is greater and more excellent then the Church or his mysticall

                              11. Melchisedech was but one of his order onely before or vnder the Law.
                              
                                 So is Christ that one onely Priest of his order vnder the Gospell, to offer vp propitiatorie sacrifice vnto the Father, needing no successors therein, seeing he is immortall, and is consecrated for euermore, Heb. 7. 24, 28.
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        The Disparitie.
                        
                           MElchisedech was man onely, and consequently sinfull: but our High-Priest is God and Man, sinlesse, and therefore needed not to offer for himselfe. Againe, Melchisedechs Priesthood was not confirmed with an oath vnto him, as was Christs, as is said, and the reason giuen. Melchisedech also

                              2. Also, hee was called Israel, a Prince of God, or preuailing with God, Gen. 32.
                              
                                 So is Christ that heauenly Prince preuailing at his Fathers hands by his intercession for all good things to his own, He. 8. 6.

                              4. Hee was a plaine man, and abode in Tents, Gen. 25. 27.
                              
                                 So was Christ plaine, meeke and mercifull, frequenting the company of men, and sinners, Math. 9. 11. &amp; 12. 18, 19.
                           
                           
                           
                              5. Iacob was hated and persecuted by Esau, Gen. 27. 41.
                              
                                 So was Christ by Satan, and the Scribes and Pharises, albeit they were his brethren according to the flesh.
                              
                           
                           
                              6. He leaues his fathers house, and goeth to serue in Haran, Gen. 28. 10.
                              
                                 So Christ left the glorious heauens, and came in the shape of a seruant vnto the earth, 2. Cor. 8.
                           
                           
                              7. In his persecution by Esau, by the way he seeth the Angels of God ascending, and descending vnto him, verse 12.
                              
                                 So after Christs temptation in the Wildernes by Satan, the Angels came and ministred to him, Mat. 4.
                           
                           
                              8. Iacob was a Shepheard, Gen. 29.
                              
                                 So is Christ the Shepheard of our soules, 1. Pet. 2.

                                 So Christ fearing death and wrath, went aside in Gethsemane to doe so, Math. 26.

                        The Disparitie.
                        
                           IAcobs father loued his elder sonne better then him: but not so did the Father loue any equally to his Sonne, euen his onely welbeloued Christ Iesus. Iacob attained to the birth-right and blessing for himselfe, and that through subtiltie: But Christ Iesus hath purchased that heauenly and blessed inheritance for vs onely, and that by paying therefore dearely. Iacob and Esau were at once both borne of the wombe of Rebecca: but Christ Iesus alone onely was borne of the wombe of the inuiolable chaste Virgin Mary, without an associate, either in his matchlesse birth, or eternitie of age.
                     
                  
                  
                     11. Iacobs Ladder, Gen. 28.
                     
                        
                           
                              1. IAcobs Ladder, which hee saw in a Vision, stood vpon the earth, but the top reached to Heauen:
                              
                                 So Christ, albeit L

                                       •…
                                    
                                 
                              
                           
                           
                           
                              and so it ioyned as it were heauen and earth together, Gen. 28. 12.
                              
                                 as the two natures in himselfe by personall Vnion: so God and vs together by his death and mediation, Ro. 5. 10.
                           
                           
                              2. The Angels went vp and downe by it.
                              
                                 So by Christ Iesus they are become ministring spirits, comming and returning for the good and protection of the godly, Heb. 1. as also by him our prayers ascend, and Gods blessings descend.
                              
                           
                           
                              3. No ascending vp to heauen, but by the Ladder.
                              
                                 So no attaining to that inheritance, but by Iesus Christ alone, Ioh. 10. 7.
                           
                           
                              4. Iacob in his Pilgrimage saw the Ladder onely in a Vision.
                              
                                 So wee see Christ heere in our pilgrimage but in glasse, as it were, darkely and in part, 1. Cor. 13.
                           
                           
                              5. The Lord stood aboue it, and made his promise of Canaan to Iacob, verse 13.
                              
                                 So in Christ, and through him, are the Lords promises of heauen, made and ratified to vs, Ioh. 2. 1.
                           
                           
                              6. In the place which was the House of God, and gate of Heauen, was the Ladder seene, verse 19.
                              
                                 So in Christs Church (which is the foresaid truely) through Faith can wee onely get a spirituall sight of Christ.
                              
                           
                           
                           
                              7. At the foote of this Ladder, Iacob did repose and sleepe.
                              
                                 Shadowing the rest and peace of conscience, which the godly haue vnder the shadow of Christs intercession.
                              
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        The Disparitie.
                        IT was a Ladder whereon to climbe, but not giuing strength to that effect: but Christ Iesus, that blessed Ladder, is both. That Ladder at Iacobs awaking vanished, and begate feare by the Vision thereof: but Christ Iesus, at our awaking in the Resurrection, shall more cleerely appeare, whose sight by faith heere expels feare, and begets confident ioy, and whose cleerer sight then shall beget farre greater.
                     
                  
                  
                     12. Ioseph, Gen. 37.
                     
                        
                           
                              1. IOseph, increasing or perfect.
                              
                                 So Christ increased in his humane bodie in strength, and in fauour with God and Man, and still now increases in his mysticall body also, and onely hee on earth was perfect.
                              
                           
                           
                           
                              2. Ioseph was best beloued of his Father, Gen. 37. 3.
                              So was Christ declared to bee that welbeloued Sonne, in whom the Father is well pleased, Mat. 3. 17.
                           
                           
                              3. Ioseph was the first-borne of beloued Rahel, Gen. 30. 24.
                              So was Christ the firstborne of the freely beloued Mary, Luke 1. 28.
                           
                           
                              4. He was hated of his brethren, the more for his heauenly reulations and words, that he should be exalted aboue them, Gen. 37. 4.
                              So was Christ of the Iewes, and the more, because hee called himselfe the Sonne of God, Iohn 5. 18. Math. 27.
                           
                           
                              5. All the sheaues of the field, with Sun, Moone and Starres worshipped Ioseph, verse 7.
                              So at the Name of Iesus, all things in heauen and earth shall bow the knee, and him both heauen and earth must adore, Ephes. 1. 20. 1. Cor. 15. Phil. 2. 10.
                              
                           
                           
                              6. Ioseph is sent by his Father to visit his Brethren in the wildernes, verse 13.
                              So was Christ sent to visit mankinde in the world, who were straying in sinne, Math. 9. 15.
                           
                           
                           
                              7. Humbly vvalking on foote, and alone vnder-going this message willingly, with great trauell, hee ceases not till he haue found them in Dothan, which is, Defection, verse 17.
                              So Christ Iesus, in the shape of a seruant willingly alone vndertaking the office of a Sauiour, seeke
                                    •…
                                 h out his Brethren the lost sheepe of the Iewes and Gentiles, and findes them both in defection of life and doctrine, 1. Ioh. 4. 10. Mat. 5. Rom. 2.
                              
                           
                           
                              8. Yet Ioseph comes neere, his Brethren conspire against him, and called him a dreamer, verse 19.
                              So Christ was scarce borne, when Herod conspired for his life, and scarce entred in his function, when the Scribes and Pharises laid snares for him, and called him a seducer, Ioh. 8.
                           
                           
                              9. Ioseph is stript naked, and cast into a pit, and sold for 20. pieces of siluer to the Idumeans by his own brethren, verse 24.
                              So was Christ strips of his garments, and cast into the pit of death and the graue, after he had beene sold for thirti

                                  pieces of siluer to the Scribes &amp; Pharises by one of his own Disciples, Mat. 26.
                           
                           
                           
                              10. Ioseph was carried downe to Egypt, in his childhood, verse 28.
                              So was Christ Iesus in his infancie, Math. 2.
                           
                           
                              11. Ioseph was tempted to carnall whoredome in solitarinesse, and ouercame, Gen. 39.
                              So was Christ vnto Spirituall in the wildernesse, when Satan said, Fall downe and worship mee, and ouercame likewise, Math. 4.
                           
                           
                              12. Ioseph was a beautifull personage, verse 6.
                              So was Christ both inwardly and outwardly.
                           
                           
                              13. Hee was falsely accused, condemned, and put in prison, where Pharaohs Baker and Butler were also put, verse 20.
                              So was Christ accused falsely, condemned vniustly, and crucified cruelly between two Malefactors, and put in the prison of the graue, where godly and wicked remaine, till they come out to diuers Iudgement, Mat. 27.
                           
                           
                              14. He was made Gouernour ouer the Prison, verse 21.
                              So is Christ Lord and victor ouer death and the graue, Hos. 13.
                           
                           
                           
                              15. He comforted the Butler in the Prison, assuring him of life and preferment, Gen. 40. 13.
                              So did Christ the Thiefe vpon the Crosse bound with him: assuring him, that that night hee should bee with him in Paradise, Luke 23.
                           
                           
                              16. Ioseph beeing brought out of the Prison, vvas exalted next vnto Pharaoh the King, Genes. 41. 40.
                              So Christ hauing risen from the graue, was exalted next vnto the Father, Psal. 110.
                           
                           
                              17. Ioseph was declared to be one, like to whom none vvas in vnderstanding and wisedome, in whom Gods Spirit was so, verse 38.
                              So was Christ matchlesse in wisedome, to whom GOD measured not his Spirit, Mat. 4.
                           
                           
                              18. Ioseph is set ouer the whole Land, and ouer the Kings house, verse 40.
                              So is Christ Lord of the whole earth: but chiefly of his Church, Zech. 14. 9.
                           
                           
                           
                              19. Iosephs name is called Zaphnapaaneah, that is, the expounder of secrets, and in the Egyptian tongue, a Sauer of the world, verse 45.
                              So is Christ this truely, the manifester of heauenly mysteries, who hath the Key of Dauid, and the blessed Sauiour of mankinde, 1. Cor. 10. 30.
                           
                           
                              20. Ioseph was richly attired in his preferment, verse 42.
                              So is Christ, in that highest exaltation of his, with glory aboue all things, Ioh. 3. 35.
                           
                           
                              21. A forerunner cryed to the people to kneele downe before Ioseph, verse 43.
                              So the Baptist cryed to prepare the way before Iesus, Mar. 1.
                           
                           
                              22. A Virgin vvas giuen in Wife vnto Ioseph by the King, verse 45.
                              So are the godly giuen to Iesus by his Father, to be his Church, Col. 1. 18.
                           
                           
                              23. Ioseph was thirtie yeeres old when hèe was preferred by Pharaoh to his Office, verse 46.
                              So was Christ of that same age, when he entred to his Calling, Math. 3.
                           
                           
                           
                              24. Pharaoh then directed his people to Ioseph, verse 55.
                              So did the Father the godly to Christ, saying, Heare him, Mat. 3. 17.
                           
                           
                              25. Ioseph with Pharaohs garner feedeth all Egypt, and other Nations, verse 57.
                              So with the Word of GOD, penned by his Spirits inspiration, Christ feedeth Iew and Gentile, Ioh. 6.
                           
                           
                              26. Iosephs Brethren at last come for foode, and reuerence him, Gen. 42.
                              So shall the Iewes at last, (albeit long lingring) come to the profession of Christ, and adore him, Zech. 12. 10.
                           
                           
                              27. He knowes his brethren first, before they know him, verse 8.
                              So doth Christ loue vs first, and finde vs out, before wee can loue, know, or finde him, 1. Ioh. 4. 19.
                           
                           
                              28. He spoke vnto them long by midmen, before cleerely he reuealed himselfe vnto them, verse 23.
                              So doth hee speake to vs by the ministerie of the Gospell heere, before he manifest himselfe cleerely vnto our soules in glory hereafter, and manifested himselfe by obscure Prophecies, before he vttered himselfe by his owne liuely voice, Heb. 1.
                           
                           
                           
                              29. Vntill Ioseph told them, that hee was their Brother, they did not know him, verse 8.
                              So vntill Christ discouer himselfe v

                              30. At first he was strange and rough vnto them, to make them remember their fault: but in the meane while hee gaue them foode without money, and afterwards comforted them, verse 7.
                              So at the first doth Christ by touch of conscience, without feeling of assurance of mercy at an instant, humble vs: but in the meane time bee in loue giues vs secret grace freely, that wee despaire not, till we get the feeling of solid comfort, 2. Cor. 1. 3.
                           
                           
                              31. Ioseph accepteth of their small gifts, albeit hee had no neede of them, Gen. 43. 15.
                              So doth our Sauiour of our Spirituall and charitable offerings, Phil. 4. 18.
                           
                           
                              32. They are washed in his house, and set at his Table, verse 33.
                              So are the true brethren of Christ made cleane by the water of the Spirit, and fed at his Table, Ephes. 5. 26.

                              43. He first manifesteth himselfe vnto his Brethren, before to the Egyptians, that he was Ioseph, Ge. 45. 3.
                              So Christ reuealed himselfe first vnto the Iewes, that he was the Messiah, before hee turned to the Gentiles, Math. 10. 3.
                           
                           
                              35. It was not his Brethrens malice so much, as GOD that sent him to Egypt, to saue the Family of Israel aliue by a great deliuerance, verse 5.
                              So neither was it the malice of the Iewes that crucified Christ, so much as the Lords Decree, that it should be so, for the saluation of his Church, Rom. 3. 25.
                           
                           
                              36. Ioseph recommends concord and loue to his Brethren in the way, seeing he forgaue them: and giues them victuals and Chariots for the iourney, verse 24.
                              So doth Christ recommend loue amongst his members: and seeing hee hath pardoned vs, that we mutually forgiue one another, and hath giuen vs the meanes of his Word and Sacraments, to further vs in the way of our saluation, Ioh. 15.
                           
                           
                           
                              37. They shew by word and by his gifts vnto their Father, that Ioseph was aliue, verse 27.
                              
                                 So should wee by our profession, and the graces of the Spirit shining in our liues, that Iesus is liuing in vs, 2. Cor. 5. 15.
                           
                           
                              38. The words of Ioseph reported by his Brethrē, were confirmed by the sight of the Chariots vnto Iacob.
                              
                              
                                 So are the promises of Iesus vttered by his Ministers, ratified and sealed vnto his people by the blessed Sacraments, Math. 28. 19. which are the chariots of grace to all true Beleeuers.
                              
                           
                           
                              39. The Lords promise of protection, the desire to see Ioseph, and the hunger in the Land, ioyned al together, mooued Iacob the more quickly and gladly to remoue, Gen. 46.
                              
                                 So Gods promise of connoy by his Angels, the desire to be with Christ, and the scarcitie of goodnesse heere, mooues the godly more willingly to depart, Phil. 1. 23.
                           
                           
                              
                                 Ioseph went out, and met his Brethren, Ge. 46. 29.
                              
                                 So doth Iesus obuiat all those that come vnto him, Luke 15. by his grace heere, and Angels hereafter.
                              
                           
                           
                           
                              41. Pharaoh and his Court reioyced at their comming, Gen. 47.
                              
                                 So doth the Lord and the Angels of Heauen reioyce at the conuersion of sinners, Luke 15. 8.
                           
                           
                              42. Hee goeth to Pharaoh, and speaketh for them, and instructeth them how to speake before Pharaoh, Gen. 46. 31.
                              
                                 So doth Christ intercede for vs at the Fathers hands, and instructeth vs how to pray to him, Math. 6. Heb. 5. Rom. 8.
                           
                           
                              43. Hee placed them in pleasant Goshen there, while thence they should goe to fruitfull Canaan thereafter, Gen. 47. 11.
                              
                                 So Christ places his own in the estate of Grace here, while they bee transplanted into the estate of glorie, and of his triumphant Church hereafter, Iohn 17. 24.
                           
                           
                              44. Iacobs Petition concerning Ioseph, when they met, was, Now let mee dye in peace, seeing I haue seene thy face, Gen. 46. 30.

                              45. Ioseph brought his two sonnes to bee blessed of his Father, Gen. 48.
                              
                                 So hath Christ brought his Chosen of the Iew and Gentile a new way to bee blessed of his Father, Heb. 10. 20.
                           
                           
                              46. Iacob willeth that his name be named on Iosephs sons, and that they bee accounted as his, Gen. 48. 16.
                              
                                 Euen so hath the Lord adopted vs to be his sonnes through Christ, and willed that his name likewise bee called vpon by vs, saying, Abba Father, Ro. 8.
                           
                           
                              47. Ioseph buried his Father solemnely, Gen. 50.
                              
                                 So did Christ the shadowish types that went before him perfectly, Iohn 19. 30.
                           
                           
                              48. While Ioseph liued, Israel did not so increase.
                              
                                 So while Christ suffered, the Church did not so flourish, Euseb. Hist.
                           
                           
                              49. Israel was afflicted after Iosephs death, while at last the Lord deliuered them.
                              
                                 So was the Church vnder the ten Persecutions after Christs death, till the Lord at last did settle the same in peace, Euseb.

                           IOseph accused his Brethren vnto his Father, and brought him their euill saying, Gen. 37. 2. But Christ Iesus excuseth his brethren, couering their faults, and intercedeth for them.

                                 So was Christ drawne out of the waters of many afflictions, to bee consecrated our Sauiour, and taken out of the race of mankinde to bee that Blessed Seed, Gen. 3. 15.
                           
                           
                              2. He was meanely borne, Exod. 2. 1.

                              4. His Cradle was an Arke dawbed with slime and Pitch.

                              5. He was wonderfully preserued by her whose sonne hee was called, verse 9.
                              
                                 So was Christ by Ioseph (beeing admonished in a dreame) whose sonne hee was reputed, Math. 2.

Moses hands also were wearied in holding vp: therefore fell downe, till Aaron and Hur stayed them vp: But the hands of our blessed Mediatour are neuer weary to intercede for his people. Moses saw not GOD face to face: but hee that proceeded out of the bosome of the Father, did see him cleerely, euen Christ, that is the ingrauen Character of the Father. Also Moses led the people onely into the sight of Canaan, and vnto the borders thereof, but gaue them not possession therein: But our Mediatour and Messiah hath purchased the same vnto his Chosen, and hath gone before to prepate a place for vs in that celestiall Canaan, that wee may possesse the same peaceably, after the day of our dissolution.

So that beeing Created, Gouerned, Redeemed, and preserued here: by the same God we shall be Glorified hereafter.

                              1. IT was called the Passouer; because the destroying Angell passed ouer all their houses, whose doore-posts were striked with the bloud thereof, and wherein the same was eaten, Exod. 12. 27.
                              
                                 So is Christ called; because Gods wrath passes ouer all them, whose soules are sprinkled with his bloud, and truely by Faith feede vpon him, 1. Cor. 5. 7.

                              3. It vvas killed, before Moses Law, or Aarons Sacrifices were

                                 To shew, that by none of them, but by the true Passeouer, that Lambe of God, killed from the beginning, deliuerance comes to mankinde, Rom. 3. Heb. 9.
                           
                           
                           
                              4. It was killed, and to be killed yeerely the first Moneth of the yeere, ver. 2. when the day lengthening, and the Sunne ascending, each thing beginneth to reuiue.
                              
                                 To shew, that by the true Passeouer, not onely is our time, and all other things sanctified: but also that wee should in recent remembrance of that benefit of our Redemption, all our dayes and yeeres bee thankefull to our gracious Redeemer, Ephes. 5. 4. 20. and that by his death, true life &amp; reuiuing came vnto mankinde.

It was slaine the 14. day, which was the fourth day after the separation therof, ver. 6. which was then full moone, shaddowing, that thē Christ should suffer, when the fulnes of ceremoniall light was in him accomplished, and in his death to make a full period, euer thereafter to decay and vanish, as also
                              
                                 To shew first, that instantly after his Birth, our Passeouer should not be sacrificed, till the appointed houre: and secondly, that as thereby they were taught to prepare themselues to the eating thereof: so should we to the eating of our Lambe by true Faith and Repentance, 1. Cor. 11.
                           
                           
                           
                              6. In the euening the Passeouer was killed, ibid.
                              
                              
                                 Shewing thereby that in the latter time Christ should suffer: and as at night there is darknes and all are at rest: So when all mankinde was sitting in darknes of minde and life, and all the world at a generall outward rest of peace, then should our Sauiour come and suffer. As also the killing thereof at euen, did shew how, as at euen, the Sunne goes too: so it was the Sunne of righteousnes that was to suffer and dye, and at his Passion, what vniuersall darknes should bee vpon the whole earth, Luke 23. 44.
                           
                           
                              7. At night also the Passeouer was eaten, verse 8.
                              
                                 Prefiguring so vnto vs how our true Paschall Lambe should bee eaten by vs, in mysterio scilicet, accenso alio lumine quam naturali.
                           
                           
                              8. It was eaten in Goshen, Israel being in Egypt, and in Ierusalem, they beeing in Canaan: both, places of the Churches abode.
                              
                                 To shew that in his true Church onely is our true Pastor to bee found, and profitably fedde vpon, Col. 1. 18.
                           
                           
                           
                              9. It was (more particularly) eaten in the Family, each house a Lambe, verse 3.
                              
                                 Shewing that with vnitie in faith and loue, as all of one family we must eat of our true Passeouer, &amp; that they are but few who truly feed, and are partakers of this Lambe, Mat. 7. 13.
                           
                           
                              10. The house must be prepared.
                              
                                 To warn vs so to prepare our hearts, 1. Cor. 11.
                           
                           
                              11. If the house be too little, the neighbours must be assumed, yea the strangers so be he be circumcised, verse 4.
                              
                                 To signifie first the super aboundant vertue of Christs death: for the house may be too little for the Lambe, but not the Lambe for a house: as likewise, the sweet Communion of Saints in loue, the ioyfull Vocation also of the neighbour Gentiles, and admission to the fellowship of faith, beeing inwardly circumcised, and at last, to condemne the priuate giuing of the Sacrament to one or two onely.
                              
                           
                           
                              12. The Passeouer was to be taken of the Lambs, verse 5.
                              
                                 To shew that our Sauiour should bee innocent in life; meeke and patient in death, and profitable alway, Isai. 53.
                           
                           
                              13. Or it was to bee taken of the Kids, ibid.
                                 
And in the generall, the taking of it from among the flocke, did signifie the separation of Christ from sinners.
                              
                                 To shew, albeit our Sauiour was sinlesse himselfe,
                                 
                                 yet hee should come of the race of sinners: (as the Kid comes of the Goat) as also, that in wrong reputation, and true imputation, being made sinne for vs, hee should be as a Kidde or a Goate, 2. Cor. 5. 21. Isai. 53. 4.
                           
                           
                              14. It must bee without any blemish, ibid.
                              
                              
                                 Shaddowing thereby the perfection and innocencie of Christ, Psal. 40. 7.
                           
                           
                              15. He must bee a Male, ibid.
                              
                              
                                 Noting thereby the excellencie of strength and dignitie (most proper to that Sexe) which should bee in Christ, Hos. 1. 11.
                           
                           
                              16. Hee must be a yeere old, ibid.
                              
                              
                                 Signifying the experience that Christ should haue of our miseries, wherof euen a dayes continuance yeelds sufficient proofe. As also that perfection of Christ in like sort, and that in fulnes of time he should come and suffer (a yeere being a perfect reuolution of the Sunnes full course,) He. 4. 15. 5. 2.
                           
                           
                              17. It must bee set apart awhile, verse 6.
                              
                                 Teaching thereby preparation, &amp; due meditation of the Lords great work of our deliuery, 1. Co. 11. Ps. 103
                           
                           
                           
                              18. It was then killed, and that by Israel, Ibid.
                              
                              
                                 So Christ behooued to dye, ere comfort could flow to vs of appeasing Gods wrath, and satisfying his iustice, the merit of whose death redounds to his chosen Church onely, Isaiah 59. 20
                           
                           
                              19. The bloud was besprinkled on the Lintell and dooreposts, that the Angell seeing the same might passe by, verse 7.
                              
                                 Signifying, that by Christs bloud applyed, the wrath of God is made to passe by vs: and where Christ the Lambe is inwardly in the house of the Soule, the sprinkling of Christs bloud will be seene by Sanctification outwardly in the practice of the life, 1. Cor. 1. 30.
                           
                           
                              Note also, that the aspersiō of this bloud by Hysope (which is a purging Hearb) doth giue vs to vnderstand the threefold vertue of Christs bloud. First, as it is a ransom to Gods iustice: and secondly,

preserueth from the destroyer of Gods wrath: so thirdly, it purgeth also the polluted soule.
                              
                                 Also the sprinkling of the bloud vpon the dooreposts: noted, how going in and out, euer we should remember Christs death, and not be ashamed of the profession of his Crosse: And that by Baptisme our soules must first bee sprinkled
                                 
                                 with his bloud, before wee can looke for to bee partakers truely of his bodie, 1. Cor. 12. 13.
                           
                           
                              20. The Lambe must be rost with fire, and that wholly, or all of it, verse 8.
                              
                                 Signifying thereby the agony of Christ in the Garden, and the wrath of his Father which hee did indure both in soule and bodie, Math. 20.
                           
                           
                              21. It must not bee eaten raw, verse 9.
                              
                                 Noting, that wee should not vnpreparedly receiue, nor grossely conceiue of Christ in the Sacrament, Ioh. 6. 1. Cor. 11.
                           
                           
                              22. It must not be sodden with water.
                              
                                 Shewing that to his Institution we must not ioyne our inuentions (adding altering or impairing) nor to the merit of his all sufficient sacrifice, the proud merit of our menstruous righteousnes, Isai. 57. 12.
                           
                           
                              23. It must bee eaten all, &amp; that with vnleauened bread, ver. 8.
                              
                                 To shew that nothing in Christ is vnprofitable or to be reiected, and that to the true participation of him, we must eschew corruption of doctrine, of manners, and malice, 2. Cor. 5.
                           
                           
                           
                              24. With sowre hearbs also the Passeouer must be eaten.
                              
                                 Signifying thereby, that with repentance wee must eate our Passeouer, in remembrance of our bitter and sowre estate of sinnes slauerie, wherein wee were captiuate, and of the bitter Passion of Christ, whose teeth were set on edge when wee had eaten the sowre Grapes, Isai. 53. 4, 9.
                           
                           
                              25. They behooued to eate the Passeouer, their loynes being girded, their staues in their hands, and their shooes on their feete, verse 11.
                              
                                 To shew how wee should eate our Passeouer, like pilgrims, to wit, not looking for a permanent Citie here: our loynes girded with veritie, and the preparation of the Gospell on our feet, the staffe of Gods Word in our hands, and with alacritie and readinesse making forward to our heauenly mansion, Phil. 3. 13.
                           
                           
                              26. They behooued likewise to eate the same in haste, as not doubting of the speedy worke of their deliuerie, and as ready waiters when they

should bee called out of doores.
                              
                                 To signifie likewise in Faith and readinesse to come when Iesus cals, and with the affections of Feare and Loue, (which are the two vsuall causes of haste) desirously and holily wee
                                 
                                 should eate our Passeouer, 1. Cor. 11.
                           
                           
                              27. Nothing was to be reserued till to morrow of the Lamb, verse 10.
                              
                                 Noting thereby the fulnesse of theirs and our deliuerance: nor that wee should reserue one sinne to liue in awhile, keeping vp, as it were a part of Christs death for it. Popish reseruation also of the Host is condemned hereby.
                              
                           
                           
                              28. If any remaine thereof ouernight, the same must bee burnt with fire, verse 10.
                              
                                 Teaching to auoid prophanation of holy things hereby: Hoc pacto etiam compellens accersere egenos (saith a Father) This burning is apishly imitated in the popish Host.
                              
                           
                           
                              29. No vncircumcised person might eate of the Passeouer.
                              
                                 So no vnsanctified person can bee truely partaker of Christ Iesus, Mat. 22.
                           
                           
                              30. The bones thereof might not be broken.
                              
                                 Typing hereby in Christ▪ suffering, how not a bone 
                                       〈◊〉
                                     him should bee broken as was foretold, Iohn 19. 36.
                           
                           
                           
                              31. None might goe out of doore that night.
                              
                                 Perseuerance in Christs Family or Church, and in the bosome thereof beeing pointed at hereby, not going out in affection to the world againe, Ren. 2. 10.
                           
                           
                              32. One Law shall bee for all (saith the Lord) verse 49.
                              
                                 Shewing thereby, whereby the Church of Christ is gouerned, and that with God there is no exception of Persons, Act. 10. 34.
                           
                           
                              33. It was to bee obserued, with the word of instruction, to be ioyned thereto, verse 26, 27.
                              
                                 So is the Sacrament to be celebrate with the word of institution, and exhortation to bee added thereto likewise, as the Seale and Charter going together, 1. Cor. 11.
                           
                           
                              Last, in that the bloud of the Lambe was first sprinkled, and then it selfe prepared and eaten.
                              
                                 It shewes that first Christ was made a sacrifice to God, and then a Sacramens to vs.
                              
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                        The Disparitie.
                        THe Iewish Passeouer did feed the body: but our Passeouer Christ doth feed the soule. It was a signe of their deliuerance: but Christ is the very worker of our deliuerance. There were many Lambs eaten in the whole campe, all called the Passeouer; because they pointed at one alone who should be the true Passeouer, and who alone sufficeth the whole number of his faithfull. The Lambe being eaten, nothing thereof did remaine: but Christ being fed vpon, is no whit impaired, but remaineth as perpetuall nourishment to his owne Chosen.
                     
                  
                  
                     15. Aaron.

                                 So is Christ the true Teacher of his Church, and exalted mountaine of inuincible strength, Math. 10. 21.
                           
                           
                           
                              2. Hee was Moses mouth to the people, Exod. 4. 30.
                              
                                 So was Christ his Fathers mouth, to the world; in declaring his will, Ioh. 1.
                           
                           
                              3. He was the blesser of the people, Leu. 9. 22.
                              
                                 So is Christ the true blesser of his people and Church, Gen. 12. 3.
                           
                           
                              4. Hee was the High Priest of the Lord, Leu. 8.
                              
                                 And so was Christ that onely true High Priest of his faithfull, Heb. 9.
                           
                           
                              5. He dyed on the top of Mount Hor, called Mosera, Numb. 20.
                              
                                 So Christ dyed on the top of Mount Golgotha, Luke 23.
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        The Disparitie.
                        
                           AAron dyed in the wildernesse for his own offence, for disobeying the Lord at the waters of Meribah: but Christ Iesus our High Priest dyed in the world, for our offences and manifold disobedience imputed to him, and vndertaken by him. Also Aaron brought not the people into Canaan, neither entered there himselfe: but our High-Priest

hath both entered himselfe into that heauenly Canaan, and bringeth the members of his true Church there also.

                              2. He assumed not this honour to himselfe, but it was giuen him of God.
                              
                                 So neither did Christ, but it was giuen him of the Father, Heb. 5. 5.

                                 So was Christs Humanitie cloathed with true holinesse, Isai. 53.

                              6. He had a holy crown vpon his head, Exod. 29. 6.
                              
                                 Signifying thereby the Deitie of Christ (which as a circle hath neither beginning nor end) and the royall dignitie wherewith hee is crowned King of his Chosen, Ier. 23. 5.
                           
                           
                              7. Hee had an ingrauen plate with Holinesse vnto the Lord on his forehead, Exo. 28. 36.

                                 Pointed the spirituall strength, and entire righteousnes of Christ, Heb. 7. 26.

                                 Typing the continuall intercession of Christ for his Church; Heb. 7. 25.

                                 So doth Christ bears and vp beare his owne, by his secret power and grace, euen when his back seemes turned vpon them, Ier. 8. interceding forthem, He. 7.

                                 Shaddowed his proclaiming of the ioyfull Gospell, and confirming the same by his holy workes and miracles vpon earth: as also typed his continuall intercession for his Chosen in Heauen, Heb. 8.

intercession for the people, Leu. 16.
                              
                                 So hath Christ entered into the heauens, there alone, and onely to bee our Mediatour, through the merit of his precious bloudshed and atonement once
                                 
                                 made for all, to procure good things, and appease wrath for vs, Heb. 7.

                                 So must Christs Church be as a Virgin, chaste, and giuing neither her loue, nor his worship vnto any other, Math. 25.

                                 Did shew that in Christ there is nothing but right and vnblameable, and that it is his bloud, that should make them blessed that should sit at his right hand. As also, the consecrating of Christs whole person by his death and bloudshed to be the Prince of our saluation, euen as we should likewise in all things by his bloud be consecrate vnto his holy obedience in all our sences, actions, and walkings, Heb. 7.

                              remained for euer, for his sonnes to be cloathed withall, Exodus 29. 29.

                     (As for the linnen garments of the inferiour Priests, they signified that Holinesse which the ministerie ought to bee cloathed withall, set downe by the Apostle, 1. Tim. 3.)
                     
                        The Disparitie, Heb. 7.
                        THe Iewish HighPriest was taken of the Tribe of Leui; but our High Priest is sprung of the Tribe of Iudah, not after the order of Aaron, but after the order of Melchisedech. Wherefore the Priesthood beeing thus changed, of necessitie there behooued to be a change of the Couenant. Againe, the lewish High Priest was made without an

Theirs behooued to offer vp sacrifice for his owne sinnes: but our High Priest is holy, harmelesse, vndefiled and separate from sinners, without spot. Theirs did frequently offer vp sacrifice of beasts whose bloud could not purge: but our High Priest hath once offered vp an all-sufficient sacrifice, neuer to be reiterate, euen himselfe to the Father, whose bloud cleanseth vs from all our sinnes.

                     17. The Cloudy Pillar. Exod. 14.
                     
                        
                           
                              1. THe Cloudie Pillar was Israels guide, which they followed in their seuerall campings from Egypt to Canaan, Num. 9. 15, 16, 17. &amp;c.
                              
                                 So is Christ our true guide, which wee must follow in our iourney to heauen, both in the precepts of his Word, and practice of his Life, Math. 11. 29.
                           
                           
                              2. It was in the shape of a Pillar.
                              
                                 So is Christ like a Pillar, firme, stable, and straight, and with his strength supporting all those that relye vpon him, Exod. 15. 2.
                           
                           
                              3. In going behind betweene the camps of Israel, and the Egyptians, it was a defence vnto them, Exo. 14. 19.
                              
                                 So is Christ not onely a Directer, but a Protector to his Church, from all their enemies, Psal. 18. 1.

                                 So is Christ saluation to the godly: but a stumbling blocke and stone of offence vnto the wicked, Math. 21. 44.
                           
                           
                           
                              5. It was a Cloud by day, and a Fire by night to Israel, ibid.
                              So is Christ a cooling refreshment to his owne in the scorching day of temptation or trouble: and a comfortable Lamp of light to direct them in the time of this life, Ioh. 1.
                           
                           
                              6. It was a Fire, and a Cloud, yet both but one Pillar.
                              
                              So Christ is God, and Man likewise, yet in both but one person, Esa. 9. 6.
                           
                           
                              7. It was a fiery Pillar.
                              
                              So is Christ not onely strong as a Pillar for the defence and bearing vp of his owne, and as a fire illuminating, purging, comforting▪ and kindling zeale in his Chosen ones: but also hee is

                        THe Cloud vanished and was no more seene, after they came to Canaan: but our blessed Pillar Christ Iesus, when wee enter, and come to that celestiall Canaan, shall then more cleerely and constantly be seene then before, the foresaid dimme sight of him in Word and Sacraments ceasing.

                                 It seemed wonderfull, and almost incredible euen vnto Moses, that God would make the Rocke to giue water to such a murmuring people.
                              
                              So likewise was it a wonderfull worke of loue, that the Lord should make his owne Sonne to shead his heart-bloud, for such a rebellious generation as mankind: therefore Esa. 53. 1. cryes out, Who will beleeue our report?

                              6. Moses at that time debarred himselfe from Canaan, and led the people only vnto the borders thereof, deliuering them to Iosua.
                              To shew, that Christ hauing suffered, by the Law there is no Iustification, nor attaining vnto heauen: but beeing imperfect and weake in it selfe, is now but a pedagogy vnto Christ Iesus, Rom. 3. 20.

                        ALl Israel promiseuously did drinke of the Rock; as well the murmurers, as the godly and patient sort: but so shall not all in the visible Church bee partakers of the bloud of Christ; but they onely who truely repent and beleeue.

                              So Christ comes to vs with the dew of grace, and thereby is applyed.
                           
                           
                              9. It fell round about the campe of Israel, and was sufficient for all to gather thereof, and fell in no other place, verse 13.
                              So Christ is conuersant within the limits of his Church, and is the fulnesse of grace to all who are true partakers of him, and no where else to bee found, Reu. 1.
                           
                           
                              10. It was gathered by measure in the Wildernes, and hee who gathered least had no lacke, ver. 18.
                              So is Christs grace in this world giuen, but by measure, and hee who hath the weakest faith, so it bee true, shall attaine to the same saluation which he of a stronger doth, 2. Pet. 3. Luke 17. 6.
                           
                           
                              11. When it came, it made the people to admire, for they wist not what it was, verse 15.
                              So when Christ came, many did wonder; yea, He rode, and all Ierusalem with him were troubled, and sundry wist not what that mysterie of his Incarnation meant, Math. 2.
                           
                           
                           
                              12. It was, as sufficient for all; so common to all, and that freely.
                              
                              So is Christ a free imparter of saluation to rich and poore, King and Begger, without respect of persons, Act. 10. 34.
                           
                           
                              13. It was ground and baked, before it was meet food for the people, verse 23.
                              So Christ behooued first diuers wayes to suffer, before hee could bee a meet Comforter and Sauiour to his Church, Act. 17. 2.
                           
                           
                              14. It was gathered earely, verse 21.
                              So is Christ and his grace to be embraced speedily and timously, Math. 25.
                           
                           
                              15. It was dayly gathered except on the Sabbath, verse 23.
                              So for a further degree of grace dayly, wee must alway labour heere, while that eternall Sabbath of rest come, when grace shall be perfected in glory hereafter, 2. Pet. 3. 18.
                           
                           
                              16. They went out of their Tents to gather it.
                              
                              So must wee goe out of the old man and loue of the world, to participate of Christ, 2. Cor. 5.
                           
                           
                           
                              17. To the breakers of Gods command, in keeping the same ouernight, it turned into putrifaction to them, and stunke, Numb. 11.
                              So to the hearers of Christs Word, and contrary practisers vnto the same, it becomes vnto them the sauour of death, Iam. 1.
                           
                           
                              18. It ceased when they came to Canaan, Iosh. 5. 12.
                              So shall the Word and Sacraments, when we come to the Kingdome of Heauen, and see Christ face to face, 1. Cor. 13.
                           
                           
                              19. Manna vvas kept and put in a golden pot before the Lord, to remaine in the holiest for euer, Exod. 16. 13.
                              So Christ Iesus glorified in his Humanitie at the right hand of God in the heauens, abides for euer vnto all ages of the faithfull, Heb. 7.
                           
                           
                              20. Manna vvas loathed by the wicked marmurers, on whom the Lords wrath fell, Num. 11. 6.
                              So is Christ Iesus in his Word and Sacraments. by the carnall and vngodly, whom GOD in his anger shall likewise destroy, Iude 4.
                           
                           
                              21. Manna fed the naturall life.
                              
                              So doth Christ Iesus the spirituall life.
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                        The Disparitie.
                        MAnna did feede onely the naturall life: but Christ Iesus is the food of the spirituall life. Againe, Manna did corrupt and putrifie: but so cannot our spirituall Manna, who abideth for euer solide and sweet comfort to euery distressed conscience. They inioyed it onely in the Wildernesse: but our chiefe and fullest inioying of our Manna, shal be in the celestiall Canaan. It was not to bee found but at a set time, for it melted away when the Sun arose: but our Manna, Christ, is euer at all times to be found, both in prosperitie and affliction, late and earely, neuer disappointing those that truely seeke him. Manna that was reserued in the Holiest, was spoiled and did perish thereafter at the captiuitie: but our heauenly Manna, seated in highest glory, can neuer perish nor suffer any violence.
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     20. The Brazen Serpent, Numb. 21.
                     
                        
                           
                              1. NEither Moses nor the Law could cure the people of the stinging of the fierie Serpents: but onely the Brazen Serpent.
                              
                                 So neither the Law, nor any creature could cure mankinde, and redeeme them from the cruell power of Satan, but onely Christ Iesus, Rom. 3. 25.
                           
                           
                              2. After many had dyed for murmuring, then the Brazen Serpent was set vp, Num. 21. 6.
                              
                                 So after that all mankinde through sinne was subdued to death and condemnation, then Christ came for our recouerie to be crucified, Esay 53.
                           
                           
                              3. A Serpent stung, and a Serpent cured.
                              
                                 So man (the first Adam) lost mankinde: and Man againe (the second Adam) redeemed mankinde, Rom. 5. 14.
                           
                           
                              4. Albeit it was called a Serpent, yet it was both without poison or sting.
                              
                                 So albeit Christ was thought a sinner (as other men) yet was hee both sinlesse &amp; spotlesse, He. 7. 26.
                           
                           
                           
                              5. It was made of brasse, and not of gold, verse 9.
                              
                                 So was Christ sent, not with outward glory, or worldly pompous sh

                                    w: but base and humble in outward appearance, Isaiah 53. 2.
                           
                           
                              6. It was not forged by mans hand, or hammer, but in a mould yet in the fire.
                              
                                 So Christ was not begottenly man: but conceiued by the Holy Ghost to the likenesse of the Father, Luke 2. 35.
                           
                           
                              7. It was not onely made, but before it cured it was set vp on high.
                              
                                 So Christ behooued not onely to bee borne: but also be crucified, before our Redemption could be finished.
                              
                           
                           
                              8. They were onely cured who looked vpon the same.
                              
                                 So they onely are redeemed from death to eternall life, who onely by faith eyes him. Isai 46. 22. beleeuing in Christ, &amp; that crucified.
                              
                           
                           
                              9. It was a wonderfull meanes of cure, and vndeseruedly deuised of God, of meere pitie; yea against the merit of these murmurers.
                              
                                 So is the death of the onely Sonne of God for rebellious mankinde, an admirable worke of vnmerited mercy likewise, aboue our merit, without our merit, and against our merit, Ephes. 1. 4.
                           
                           
                           
                              Yet albeit it was instituted by GOD, and great miracles wrought at the presence thereof: (the Lords institution lasting, and right vse being made thereof by the people in the Wildernesse) yet at last it being Idolatrously abused, was destroyed, by that godly King Hezechiah, and called Nehushtan, or a masse of brasse, 2. King. 18.
                              
                                 Shewing thereby how lawfull by the like example, and much more likewise, Images and other inuentions of men, turning to an Idolatrous or superstitious abuse, their abrogating is in a reformed Christian Church.
                              
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        The Disparitie.
                        THe Brazen Serpent was destroyed (as is said) but our exalted Iesus can neuer bee destroyed. It retained not alway the vertue of curing: but our blessed Sauiour doth euer retaine the vertue and efficacie of sauing.
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     21. The Tabernacle, Exod. 26.
                     
                        
                           
                              1. IT had three places therein: the outward Court, wherin the brazen Lauer, and brazen Altar stood.
                              
                                 Representing the visible Church, wherein is outward Baptisme, and externall exercise of worship common to all Called and Elect, Mat. 13.
                           
                           
                              Secondly, the Holy place, wherein was the Candlesticke, the table of Shew-bread, and the Altar of perfume.
                              
                                 Representing the inuisisible true Church, consisting of the elect onely, militant on earth, wherein is the light of the Spirit by the Word, the true participation of Christ, the bread of life, and the sincere acceptable sacrifice of true prayer and praise. Within this place enters onely the Royall Priesthood of God, Rom. 12. 1. 1. Pet. 2. 5.
                           
                           
                              Thirdly; the Holiest of all, wherein was the Mercy-Seat, the glory of GOD betweene the Cherubims,
                              
                                 Representing the triumphant Church in the heauens, wherein is seated Christ Iesus in glory, the societie of the blessed Angels, and the praise of the
                              
                           
                           
                           
                              and the golden Censor.
                              
                                 glorified spirits, with the continuall intercession of our Sauiour for his Saints on earth, Heb. 8.
                           
                           
                              2. The entry to the Holiest, was by the Holy place, and to the holy place, was by the vtter Court.
                              
                                 So our entry to the heauens is by beeing members of the i

                                 Shaddoweth the spirituall and inward glory of the Church, and her account before God, albeit contemptible to the world in outwards, Cant. 1. 4.
                           
                           
                              7. The Tabernacle &amp; all the instruments thereof: yea the very Ash-pans &amp; Snuffers of the Candlesticke, must be made according to the patterne in the Mount, Exo. 25. 40. Heb. 8. 5.
                              
                                 Shewing thereby that the Church, and all the exercise of worship that is therein, whether doctrine or discipline, must be conformed vnto the written Word, Gal. 1. 8.
                           
                           
                              8. The voluntarie oblation of the people to build the Tabernacle,
                              
                                 Represents that willing allotment and portion that Christians should giue for the vpholding of Gods worship and ministerie amongst them, and for the maintenance of the poore members of Christs mysticall body, 2. Cor. 9. 8.
                           
                           
                              9. The principall builders of the Tabernacle, were Bezaleel
                                 
and Aholiab, extraordinarily indued with cunning in euery worke, and the secondary, was euery skilful workman in whose minde God had put skill, and will to assist the worke, Exod. 36.
                              
                                 These figuring the Apostles, as Master-builders laying the foundation of the Christian Church, and the
                                 
                                 other the ordinary Pastors building on their foundation aright, beeing gifted and fitted for that effect, 1. Cor. 3. 10. Ro. 12. 6. Ephes 11. 28.
                           
                           
                              10 The parts of the Tabernacle were so made, that they might bee ioyned or separate when they list, Deut. 12. 9.
                              
                                 To shew the faithfull in this Tabernacle of their body, which is to bee laid downe, and raised againe, to be farre from their resting place, while they be in that gloricus Temple of the heauens settled and seated with Christ, 2. Cor. 5. 4.
                           
                           
                              11. The Curtens of the Tabernacle imbroidered with Cherubims,
                              
                                 Signified the seruice and protection of the Church by the holy Angels, Isa 6.
                           
                           
                              12. These Curtens were coupled by their strings and golden hookes, that it might

bee one Tabernacle, Exod. 36. 13.
                              
                                 Shewing, th

                              13. The glorious doore of the Tabernacle,
                              
                                 Shaddowed Christ Iesus, who saith of himselfe expressely, I am the doore, Ioh. 10. 7. by whom wee get entry either to grace or glory.
                              
                           
                           
                              14. The Tabernacle thus by all the couplings thereof being erected.
                              
                                 Did signifie the knitting together by every ioynt, of the whole body of the Church in Christ the Head by the truth in charitie, for the furniture whereof (according to the effectuall power which is in the measure of euery part) it receiueth increase of the bodie, vnto the edifying of it selfe in loue, Ephes. 4. 16.
                           
                           
                              15. Euery boord of the Tabernacle, signified each seuerall member of Christ and his Church, of Sittim wood: that is, chosen and sanctified, ouerlaid with gold, that is, made glorious in Christ, standing vpright, by the erection of hope, fixed by the tenons of Faith, and founded on the socket Christ, as also ioyned by barres, which is the

                                 itie of one Spirit, and loue: the couerture

of this Tabernacle, is Christ, the linnen represents his innocencie, the Goates haire, his afflictions (the Penitentiars garment beeing vsually made of such) the third couering dyed red, figuring his bloud couering our sins, and the fourth of broken skinnes, his abasement and humilitie. The doore of the Tabernacle was not of any hard or debarring matter, but of a vaile, easily penetrable, to shew our easie accesse to grace in Christ, and acceptation in the bosome of his Church.
                               
                           
                        
                     
                  
                  
                     22. The Vaile of the Holiest, Exod. 26. 31.
                     
                        
                           
                              1. IT was glorious, of embroidered worke of diuers colours.
                              
                                 So was the body of Christ beautified with excellent, diuers and heauenly graces, Hebr. 7. 26. Col. 2. 3.
                           
                           
                              2. It was replenished and wrought full of Cherubims.
                              
                                 Noting thereby that seruiceable and ready attendance of the Angels on the person and body of Christ, Ioh. 1. 51.
                           
                           
                           
                              3. It was borne vp by glorious and costly Pillars, ouerlaid with gold, on Sockets of siluer, which it couered, and whereon it did hang.
                              
                                 To shew that the Humanitie of Christ (specially in his suffering) should be borne vp by his Deitie, which his manhood did oueruaile, and vnder which it againe in a manner did lurke.
                              
                           
                           
                              4. By the Vaile onely there was entry into the Holyest place of all.
                              
                                 So by the vaile of his flesh onely (rent vpon the Crosse) hath Christ made a new and liuing way for vs, to God, and to Heauen, Heb. 10. 20.
                           
                        
                     
                  
                  
                     23. The Arke, Exod. 25. 10. to 17.
                     
                        
                           
                              1. THe Arke was made of Sittim wood, which was durable, and not subiect to putrifaction.
                              
                                 So Christ Iesus was neither subiect to the corruption of sinne, nor putrefaction of the graue, Psal. 16. 9, 10.
                           
                           
                              2. The Wood was ouerlaid within and without with fine gold and pure.
                              
                                 So the excellent diuine nature of Christ was so vnited to his humane, that not onely the vertue thereof glanced inwardly in his
                                 
                                 soule and minde: but outwardly also did shine most gloriously in his actions, Col. 2.
                           
                           
                              3. It had a crowne of gold round about.
                              
                                 Signifying thereby the Maiestie of Christs Kingdome, or eternitie of his Deitie, which (as a circle) hath neither beginning nor end, Ioh. 1. 1.
                           
                           
                              4. It had Iength, breadth, and height, &amp; was in shape fouresquare.
                              
                                 Shaddowing the patience and long-suffering of Christ, the ample extense of his loue and grace, and the sublimitie of his glory and reward stable in himself, who could not bee ouerthrowne, and constant in mercy, who neuer can varie, Psal. 103.
                           
                           
                              5. The measure of the Arke exceeded not the dimensions of mans proportion; so that he might fadom it about.
                              
                                 Shewing thereby how Christ beeing made man, dimitted himselfe to our capacitie, was seene, heard, and handled, and remaines still accessible, Heb. 4. 16.
                           
                           
                              6. It had foure rings and barres, whereby it was carried.
                              
                                 Signifying how Christ should be carried in the ministery of the Gospel, by his faithfull Preachers, to the foure corners of the earth, Math. 28.
                           
                           
                           
                              7. The barres in the rings must neuer bee seuered from the Arke.
                              
                                 So preaching and Christ must neuer be asunder, but adhering to the Arke and ground stone, truth must be taught, Gal. 1. 8.
                           
                           
                              8. The two tables were in the Arke,
                              
                                 Signifying thereby that Christ is the end of the Law, satisfying the same for vs, deliuering vs from the curse thereof, and making our obedience also to the Law acceptable to the Father, by couering the imperfection of our workes, Psal. 130. 3. Rom. 3. 21.
                           
                           
                              9. In it was the pot of Manna.
                              
                                 To shew, that in Christ is the treasure of comfort, spirituall nourishment and life, Reu. 2. 17. Col. 3. 1.
                           
                           
                              10. In it also was Aarons Rodde that budded and bore fruit.
                              
                                 To signifie that in Christ wee haue assurance of a blessed Resurrection, and that by him our rebellion is couered: as also that in him Aarons Priesthood is wrapped vp, and ceases, Heb. 8.
                           
                           
                              11. God spake by Oracle out of the Arke.
                              
                                 To prefigure that out of the nature of man in Christ hee should speake to the world, Heb. 1.
                           
                           
                           
                              12. The Arke was an assurance of Gods presence amongst the people, and God did dwell therein.
                              
                                 So Christ is the cause and assurance that God in mercy is present with vs, Ioh. 17 21. and in Christ personally the Deitie did dwell.
                              
                           
                           
                              13. Where the Arke was, there only it was lawfull to offer sacrifice, &amp; no where else was it accepted.
                              
                                 To shew, that where Christ is, to wit, in the Church, there, and through him onely our seruice is acceptable.
                              
                           
                           
                              14. By the Arke Iordan was diuided, so that the people went dry and safe ouer to Canaan.
                              
                                 So by Christ a ready way is made through all the horrors of death, for vs to come safely to our heauenly Kingdome, Psal. 23. 4.
                           
                           
                              15. The people a great way might not come neere vnto the Arke.
                              
                                 Shewing thereby what reuerence

                                    ught to bee to Christ in his Word and Sacraments, Act. 10.
                           
                           
                              16. By the Arkes compassing of Iericho, with the blowing of the Hornes, the walls

of the City fell down, and by the presence thereof in battell, the people were assured of victorie.
                              
                                 So where Christ cornes by the powerfull preaching of his Word, Principalities and highest powers must
                                 
                                 yeeld, and if he be with vs, who can preuaile against vs? Rom. 8.
                           
                           
                              17. When the Arke was set vp in the temple of Dagon, Dagon fell and brake.
                              
                                 So where Christ comes by his Gospell of Truth, Idolatry goeth downe, Act. 19.
                           
                           
                              18. The Philistims were plagued at the presence of the Arke with them: but Obed-Edom was blessed by hauing it with him.
                              
                                 So where Christ is in wrath, their estate is dangerous: but where he is in loue, their blessings are with him, Ioh. 17.
                           
                           
                              19. The people of Bethshemesh were fearfully punished, for looking into the Arke:
                              
                                 To teach vs how dangerous it is to prye into Gods secrets vnreuealed, and not bee wise according to sobrietie, Rom. 12. 3.
                           
                           
                              20. After long transporting at last it was gloriously conueyed, and settled in

                                 Salomons temple there still to remaine.
                              
                                 So after many iourneys, and long suffering on earth, Christ Iesus at last was receiued vp in glory, in the holiest heauens, to sit
                                 
                                 at the Fathers right hand for euer, Psal. 110. 1.
                           
                        
                     
                  
                  
                     24. The Arke, as it typed the mysticall body of Christ,
                     
                        
                           
                              1. IT was the keeper of the testimonie.
                              
                                 So is the Church the keeper of the Scriptures.
                              
                           
                           
                              2. It was woodden, but couered with pure gold.
                              
                                 So the Church is in it selfe infirme, but through Christ is strengthened and beautified with grace, Cant. 1. 4.
                           
                           
                              3. God was present with the Arke.
                              
                                 So is he with his Church vntill the worlds end, Ioh. 14.
                           
                           
                              4. The Propitiatorie couered the Arke.
                              
                                 So doth Christs death couer the spots of his Church, and the accusing of the Law, Gal. 3. 13.
                           
                           
                              5. The Cherubims stood aboue the Arke.
                              
                                 So the protection of the Angels stands aboue and about the Church, Heb. 1.
                           
                           
                              6. It was transportatiue euer, while it

                                 was seated at last in the glorious Temple of Salomon.
                              
                                 So the Church hath no constant place on earth,
                                 
while it be at last settled in the glorious heauen, Heb. 13. 14.
                           
                           
                              7. It had a crowne of gold about it.
                              
                              So is the Church crowned with diuers graces and gifts heere, and shall bee with the crowne of glory heereafter, 1. Cor. 12.
                           
                           
                              8. It had the foure dimensions proportionably.
                              
                              So hath the Church of Christ, the depth of Faith, the height of Hope, the Latitude of Charitie, and the Longitude of Perseuerance.
                           
                           
                              9. In it was the pot of Manna, &amp; Aarons Rodde.
                              
                              So in Christs Church is the cōfort of true doctrine, and regiment of whelesome discipline, R

                     25. The Mercy-Seat or Propitiatory, Exod. 25. 17. to 23.
                     
                     
                        
                           
                              1. IT was called the Mercy-Seat, or Propitiatorie.
                              
                              So is Christ he in whom mercy is truely seated, and hath made Propitiation for our sinnes, Rom. 3. 25.
                           
                           
                           
                              2. It was the couer of the Arke where the two Tables lay of the Law of Moses.
                              So Christ is the true couer and deliuerer of vs, from the curse and accusation of the Law, Rom. 3.
                           
                           
                              3. It was of pure gold.
                              
                              Noting thereby the spotlesse holinesse of Christ, Heb. 6. 26.
                           
                           
                              4. Vpon it were two Cherubims, shewing that the very Angels haue their stablishment in Christ their Mediator, by confirmation, as also
                              
                              Signifying the Angels ready attendance on Christ and his Church: as also, figured, that when we draw neere to the Mercy-Seat Christ, being adopted and ingraft in him, then are we ioyned to the societie of the Angels, Luke 20.
                           
                           
                              5. They stretched their wings on high, couering so the Mercy-Seat.
                              
                              Figuring so the Maiestie of Christs Deitie, which none in glory can behold, of the very Angels, but with their faces couered: and shaddowing forth likewise hereby the most comfortable and sure protection of the Church, Mich. 4. 11. and the readinesse to act Christs will.
                           
                           
                              6. They looked down vpon the Mercy-Seat.
                                 
                              
                              Signifying the mysticall Maiestie of the Incarnation, into the which

the Angels desired to pry and behold, 1. Pet. 1. 12.
                           
                           
                              7. The faces of the Cherubims were one towards another, and both towards the Mercy-Seat.
                              
                              So representing also the consent of the old and new Testament, and their mutuall witnes-bearing one to another, and both looking vpon Christ, the one pointing him to come, and the other already come: as also, signifying the holy loue and agreement that the Angels haue among themselues in Christ.
                           
                           
                              8. From the Mercy-Seat betweene the Cherubims, the Lord vttered his will to the people, and no more in a Bush, or in a Cloud spake he,
                              
                              So in diuers manner did the Lord speake in old time to the Fathers, by dreames and visions: but now in the last dayes hath he spoken by his Sonne, and still as yet doth in the two testaments of his sacred Word, He. 1.
                           
                           
                              9. The Cherubims were of gold, beaten out with the hammer.
                              
                              Signifying the glistering brightnes of heauenly wisedome contained in the Scriptures, whose worth is aboue gold, and is giuen by the inspiration of the Spirit of God, and penned by holy men, Psal. 119 2. Tim. 3. 16.
                           
                           
                           
                              10. Note last of all, that not betweene Seraphims (which are put for executers of Iustice, as Isai. 6. but betweene Cherubims, as Messengers of Mercy, the Lord in Christ shewes himselfe appeased.
                              
                               
                           
                        
                     
                  
                  
                     26. The Golden Censor, Heb. 9.
                     
                        
                           
                              
                                 VVIth this golden Censor the High Priest putting Incense therein, filled the Holiest place with a sweet perfume; when he entered in to speake before the Lord.
                              
                              Signifying thereby the Lord Iesus intercession through the pure and perfect merit of his sauourie obedience wherewith hee hath filled the Holiest heauens, as with a sweet odour and incense, appeasing Gods wrath, and making vs and our prayers and workes acceptable, Heb. 4. 14.

                              1. IT was of Sittim wood, couered ouer with gold, and a crowne about it.
                              
                              Noting, (as is said) the purity of Christs Humanity, with the glory of his Deity, and Maiesty of his Kingdome.

                              3. The Shewbread was euer vpon this Table.
                              
                              So true preaching, and sincere administration of the Sacraments (whereby that bread of Life is set before vs) must euer be vpon Christ crucified, as on the sure ground, Gal. 1. 8. 1. Cor. 3.
                           
                           
                              4. The incense cups were vpon the Table,
                              
                              Signifying, that with the preaching of the Word, and administratiō of the Sacraments, Prayer must be ioyned, and on Christs institution and rule, as on the Table, to be set and grounded, 1. Cor. 11. 23.

                              Figuring the diuersitie of gifts, places and functions in Christs Church, wherein euery one ought sincerely and holily to walk, 1. Cor. 12.

                              So Christ is that onely light, &amp; light-giuer, which shineth in his Church, Ioh. 1.
                           
                           
                              2. It was of pure gold,
                              
                              Shaddowing so the excellencie of Christ, and of his Pastors, through that light whereof they are bearers, Reu. 1. and noting thereby also the dignity of the Word, Psal. 119.
                           
                           
                           
                              3. It had seuen Lamps.
                              
                              Sign sying so the perfection of the light of Christ, (seuen beeing the number of perfection.)
                           
                           
                              4. It was placed in the Sanctuarie.
                              
                              So is the light of Christ placed in his Church, and there only to be scene in the brightnes of his Word, and illumination of his Spirit. So that where that light shines not, there is not the true Church, Ioh. 10. 4, 5.
                           
                           
                              5. It had an vpright Stemme, which did beare the many brāches that did issue and proceed from the same.
                              
                              Typing Christ Iesus that true stalke and fountaine of light, from whom all light floweth, and which beares vp, &amp; keeps cōstant in the truth all the branches, and true light-bearers of his Word, Reu. 1. 20.
                           
                           
                              6. The branches were adorned with their Bowles, Knops, and Flowers.
                              
                              So are the true light-bearers of Christ, adorned with diuers meete graces and gifts by him, tending both to the spirituall delectation, and profit of his Church, 1. Cor. 12. 14. 33.
                           
                           
                              7. Aaron did dresse
                                 
                                 those Lamps, and renued their Oyle daily.
                              
                              So is our blessed High Priest, the onely enlightner

and fitter of his Pastors, to shine the more cleerely in his Church, and the powrer in of grace into their hearts, to bee as Lamps to others by true faith in a good conscience, ibid.
                              
                           
                           
                              8. It had Snuffers and Snuffe-dishes of pure gold.
                              
                              Shewing how with doctrine, the sinceritie of discipline, according to Gods Word, whereby the light of the Church is kept cleere, should euer be ioyned, and excommunication vsed of all scandalous and rebellious persons, like the extinguishing of noysome smelling Snuffes. As likewise, that euery one ought to content himselfe with his roome, how low soeuer it be, so it bee in the Sanctuarie, and as the Snuffers were of gold; so they conscionably to walke in their station, Rom. 16. 17.
                           
                           
                              9. It was in the Holy place: but not in the Holyest.
                              
                              Shewing, how the light of Gods Word must bee in the Militant Church, but shall not need to bee in the triumphant, when face to face we shall see the Lord in glory, Reu. 21. 22.
                           
                           
                              10. Also as the Candlestick had Flowres, signifying as it is before, the spirituall
                                 
delectation of the Word, so the Knops or Almonds which it had.
                              Did represent the efficacie of the Word, vnto the bringing forth of the fruits of holinesse.
                           
                           
                              Last, the pure oyle powred into the Lamps, making the same to burne.
                              
                                 Signified the grace of the Spirit accompanying the Word, making the same powerfull in operation.
                              
                           
                        
                     
                  
                  
                     29. The Altar of Perfume, Exod. 30. 1. to 13.
                     
                     
                        
                           
                              1. IT was of Sitttim wood, ouerlaid with gold, and hauing a crowne about it.
                              
                                 Shaddowing (as before) Christ, in both his natures, the Deitie yeelding glory to his Humanitie, and crowned now with Maiestie, as the gold adorned the Sittim wood, and circled the Altar.
                              
                           
                           
                              2. It had Hornes on the foure corners thereof, ouerlaid with gold.
                              
                                 Shaddowing the powerfull and holy vertue of the intercession of Christ, to extend it selfe to the foure corners of the earth, to the comfort of his Church dispersed euery where, Heb. 7. 25.

                                 Noting, how our prayers must proceed out of a humbled and contrite Spirit, which wee offer vp in the name of Iesus, Psa. 51.
                           
                           
                              5. It was kindled by fire vpon the Altar.
                              
                                 So must our prayers be by a holy and feruent zeale and desire, through the operation and stirring vp of the holy Spirit, Ro. 8. 26.

                                 So are the prayers of the faithfull offered vp, and made acceptable to the Father, through the Oblation and Intercession of our High Priest Iesus. As also, they who offer vp acceptable prayers vpon the Altar of our mediation, are the holy Priesthood of the Lords Chosen, Reu. 1. 6.
                           
                           
                              7. No strange Incense was to be offred vpon this Altar.
                              
                                 So no vnwarranted or vnlawfull forme of prayer, superstitiously or idolatrously deuised, to any Saint 
                                       〈◊〉

                              8. The perfume behooued to bee perpetually before the Lord.
                              Shewing thereby, not onely the continuall exercise of Prayer which dayly we should vse on earth: but also the continuall Intercession of our Sauiour in the Heauens for vs, Heb. 7. 25.
                           
                           
                              9. The High Priest made this perfume onely, and might not be applyed to any other vse, but to burne before the Lord.

                              10. After the cleering of the Lamps of the Candlesticke, euening and morning, then the incense was burnt.
                              Shewing so, that our Prayers, and all our Christian duties in Christ, must bee done according to the light and direction of his Word &amp; Spirit, 1. Cor. 14.
                           
                           
                              11. The Incense was made of diuers Spices.
                              So must the prayers of the godly bee seasoned with diuers graces, true Repentance, liuely faith, vnfained loue, &amp; such like, Ps. 51▪
                              
                           
                           
                           
                              12. The Incense was offered vp in the Holy place, without the veile of the Holyest, neere to the Testimonie before the Mercy-Seat.
                              So the prayers of the godly in his Church hecre on earth, must proceed out of a holy heart, bee made agreeable to the Testimon

                              13. Once a yeere the Altar was sprinkled with the bloud of the expiatorie Sacrifice.
                              Shewing how Christ is by his bloudshed consecrate our blessed Mediator, and that no prayer is acceptable to God: but that mans, who, through the bloud of Christ, is reconciled to him, ibid.

                              1. IT was of Brasse in the Court of the Sanctuarie.
                              Shewing how that Christ Iesus, albeit now shining in glory (like the golden Arke in the Holiest) yet in the

world he should abase himselfe, (like Brasse) comming in th

                                  shape of a Seruant, Isai. 53. 2.
                           
                           
                              2. This Altar was but one, and in one place, and the Sacrifice to bee offered thereon in this one place,
                              Figuring thereby that wee haue but one Altar of Redemption, and Saluation, Christ Iesus alone, who onely once, and in one place hath offered vp a sufficient vnreiterable Sacrifice for mankinde, Heb. 7. 27.
                           
                           
                              3. It had foure Hornes on the foure corners thereof,
                              Signifying the spirituall strength of Christ, which should be manifested to the foure corners of the earth, and that with a strong faith flying thither, wee should in all our distresses stay onely on him, and tye our carnall affections to the Altars Hornes, by captiuating them to Christ, 2. Cor. 5. 15.
                           
                           
                              4. It had a Brazen grate in the midst thereof, whereon the fire was put.
                              Representing so, the humbled soule of our blessed Sauiour, which did beare the fire of Gods wrath for our sinnes, Isai. 53. 12.
                           
                           
                              5. It had diuers instruments seruing for the same,
                              Typing, the sundry callings that Christ hath in his Church, for the glory of his Name, and edifying of his Church, 1. Cor. 12.
                           
                           
                           
                              6. It was to bee clensed seuen dayes, and sanctified: so it was most holy, and whatsoeuer touched it, was holy, Exodus 29. 37.
                              Figuring thereby the perfect sanctifying of our most holy Altar Christ Iesus: and that whosoeuer toucheth him by true faith, is made holy by him, 1. Cor. 1. 30.
                           
                           
                              7. Also, the grate or Net-worke purged the Sacrifice,
                              To shew that euen so doth Christ Iesus purge our sacrifices offered on him, and maketh them acceptable.
                           
                           
                              8. This Altar was hollow betweene the boords.
                              Signifying thereby the emptying, and examination of Christ.
                           
                           
                              9. Last, in that it behooued the Sittim wood to be ouerlaid with Brasse, that therby it might indure the fire.
                              It figured, that so the humane nature of Christ (tho holy) was vnable to indure Gods wrath, as it did: except vnderpropped and strengthened by the Deity.
                           
                        
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     31. The Brazen Lauer, Exod. 30. 18. to 23.
                     
                        
                           
                              1. THe Brazen Lauer serued for the Priests to wash their hands and feete thereat, before they ministred before the Lord.
                              Typing that inward Baptisme by Christs bloud, wherewith the holy Priesthood of his Chosen must be washed, and sanctified in action and affection, before their seruice can be acceptable, Ephes. 5. 26.
                           
                           
                              2. After the Priests had washed themselues cleane, and arrayed themselues with cleane linnen, then they entered into the Holy place,
                              So, after that the godly are inwardly washed by the bloud of Christ, and haue receiued the garment of his righteousnesse vnto sanctification, then it is that they become members of his true Church, 1. Cor. 12. 13.
                           
                           
                              3. They shall wash themselues (saith the Lord) lest they dye,
                              So must wee be purged (as is said) and sanctified by the Spirit of grace, if we would not incurre eternall death and damnation, Mat. 28. Mar. 16. 15.
                           
                           
                           
                              4. He that toucheth the Lauer, it beeing anointed with the holy Oyle, (as all other things in the Holy, and in the most Holy place were) shall bee holy, (saith the same Lord.)
                              Shewing how all they, who by a liuely faith touch the Lord Iesus (who is anointed with the oyle of gladnes aboue his fellowes) shall be, in acceptation and reputation, accounted likewise holy before the Lord, Rom. 4.
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        The Disparitie of all the former.
                        THese things of the Tabernacle were materiall and earthly: but that which is represented by them, is spirituall and heauenly: the one was perishable, the other endureth for euer. For Israel in the flesh, onely to abide in Ierusalem the first was ordained: but for the Israel in the Spirit, euen the Church vniuersall, where-euer pure hands is lifted vp: the second is open and prepared, Psa. 141. 2. the former were vnder the Law, and Moses, typing things to come: the latter is vnder the Gospell and the Messiah, exhibiting the things themselues.
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     The burnt-offering of Beasts, Leu. 1. 10, 14. and 6. 9. to 13.
                     
                        
                           
                              1. THe burnt-offering of beasts, behooued to bee of those that are the horned sort,
                              
                                 Signifying thereby the Princely and Priestly Offices of Christ, which that Beast seekes to counterfet, Reu. 13. 11. in being horned like the Lambe, but speaking like the Dragon.
                              
                           
                           
                              2. They behooued also to be of the tame sort, as of the Herd or Flocks, and not of wilde sauage beasts, who by force are brought to death.
                              
                                 Shewing thereby that Christ should bee meeke and milde in life, and patient in death it selfe, like a Lambe led to the Shambles, Esay 53.
                           
                           
                              3. They were required in like manner to be of the male kind and yong.
                              
                                 Shaddowing thereby the excellencie of strength in Iesus Christ, proper to that sexe and age.
                              
                           
                           
                              4. They must bee without blemish, and

presented of voluntarie will.
                              
                                 Thereby noting, the purity and perfection of Holinesse in Christ, who should
                                 
                                 willingly lay downe his life, and offer vp himselfe, for the saluation of mankinde, Ioh. 19. 11.
                           
                           
                              5. They were to be presented at the dore of the Tabernacle to be slaine,
                              
                                 Typing thereby that by the Oblation of Christ, and by his bloudshed, both our entry is made (as by a doore) into the Church heere, and into the heauens heereafter, Heb. 10. 20.
                           
                           
                              6. They must lay their hands vpon the head of the Beast, who brought it,
                              
                                 Signifying hereby the imputation of our sinnes vpon Christ, for the which hee suffered, and that wee must lay our hand by a true faith vpon him, if wee looke for any comfort of his Death and Passion, Esay 53. 3.
                           
                           
                              7. Then the burnt offering was slaine,
                              
                                 Signifying that so Christ should d

                              8. The bloud thereof was sprinkled roūd about the Altar,
                              
                                 Noting, the all-sufficiency of Christs Death, and plenty of his bloudshed, with the large-spred preaching
                                 
                                 thereof vniuersally throughout the whole world towards all parts, Math. 28.
                           
                           
                              9. The skin thereof was pluckt off, and it cut in pieces,
                              
                                 Hereby shewing the grieuousnes of Christs suffering, and his extreme dereliction, beeing stript, as it were, of all diuine or humane help, comfort, or regard, when hee cryed, Why hast thou forsaken me, Math. 27. 46.
                           
                           
                              10. The body, the head, and the fat, and all was laid vpon the fire,
                              
                                 Shewing thereby, how whole Christ should suffer for vs, both in body and soule, Isai. 53. 12.
                           
                           
                              11. The inwards and legges thereof were to be washed in water,
                              
                                 Shaddowing thereby how. Christ should bring no vncleannesse vnto his Passion: but he should be clean both inwardly, and outwardly; in minde, and in walking, Heb. 7.
                           
                           
                              12. This burnt-offering was called a sweet sauour vnto the Lord,
                              
                                 Which in Christs death is sole and onely accomplished, whereby Gods wrath is appeased, and his iustice satisfied, Phil. 2. 8.
                           
                           
                              13. Of the Flocks,

it was a Lambe, a Ramme, or a Goat.
                              
                                 Signifying that Christ should bee meeke, the guide
                                 
                                 or leader of his flocke, and haue sinne, but onely by imputation, Isai. 53.
                           
                           
                              14. The burnt-offering of the Flockes shall be killed on the North-side of the Altar,
                              
                                 Shewing not onely, that al these Oblations were but a darke Starry light (the Sunne not rising in that ayre: but being opposite vnto him in his highest splendor) but also that Christ should dye at Ierusalem; whereof the Prophet saith, On the Northside is the City of the great King, Dan. 9. 26.
                           
                           
                              15. The Priest shall put off his garments, and put on his linnen breeches, and take away the ashes, when the fire hath consumed the burnt-offering, Leu. 6. 10.
                              
                                 Noting thereby how that Christ beeing stript of his cloathes, should suffer in nakednesse, and innocencie, and after hee had finished the worke of our Redeption on the Crosse, should be buried, and then swallow vp death in Immortaluse, Hos. 13.
                           
                           
                              16. The Ashes behooued to be carried without the Host, and put in a cleane place.
                              
                                 Shaddowing thereby how Christ should bee buried without Ierusalem, in a tombe where neuer man was laid, and how his body should neuer see corruption, Heb. 13.
                           
                           
                           
                              17. The fire which consumed the burnt-offering, came downe from heauen,
                              
                                 Typing either that wrath which for our sakes seyzed on Christ Iesus in the Garden, and on the Crosse, which came from the Father, or that loue which mooued Christ to suffer for mankinde, which was heauenly and free, Ioh. 15. 13.
                           
                           
                              18. This fire was to be continually vpon the Altar,
                              
                                 Shaddowing the constant vnchangeablenesse of that loue of his to his Church, and recent vertue of his meri
                                       •…
                                     and death, Heb. 7.
                           
                           
                              19. This fire was to be fed, that it went not out, and no other fire was to bee vsed but this in the Sanctuarie,
                              
                                 Teaching vs how carefully wee should entertaine the loue, and Spirit of Christ, by sanctimony of life and obedience and that wee should try the spirits, and admit no other sprit, but the Spirit of Christ in his Word, to rule and teach his Church, 1. Ioh. 4.
                           
                           
                              20. The skin of the burnt-offering went to the Priest, Len. 7. 8.
                              
                                 Shewing thereby not only the maintenance that they should haue who preach the Gospell, as they that serued at the Altar, liued of the Altar, 1. Cor. 9. 13, 14.

                                 but also that the righteousnes of Iesus must bee apprehended by his Chosen, and holy Priesthood of the godly, by the hand of true Faith, vnto Iustification, and Sanctification, Rom. 5.
                           
                        
                     
                  
                  
                     33. The Burnt-offering of Fowles, Leu. 1. 14. to the end of the Chapter.
                     
                        
                           
                              1. THe burnt-offering of Fowles was of Turtles, or Pigeons,
                              
                                 Shewing thereby the simplicitie, meeknes, and innocencie of Christ, Isa. 53. 7.
                           
                           
                              2. The neck thereof shall bee pinch't with the nayle, that the bloud might goe out: but not that the head should be pluckt off from the body,
                              
                                 Shaddowing how Christ should dye, and shead his bloud, yet thereby his Deitie (as the head or principall part) should not bee diuided from his humanitie: nor yet by his death should he (who is our Head) be taken from the bodie of his Church, but should rise againe, and bee with them by his Spirit for euer, Ioh. 14.
                           
                           
                              3. The Maw and Feathers were to bee cast away as vncleane,
                              
                                 To shew therby that Christ should bring no vncleanenes (as is said before) to his suffering, but should be offered vp spotlesse to his Father, Isai. 53. 9.
                           
                           
                           
                              4. The Priest did cleaue it wth it wings, but not diuide it asunder.
                              
                                 Noting thereb

                              5. The bloud thereof was strained or pressed out at the side of the Altar, before it was pluckt, and laid vpon the Altar to be burned.
                              
                                 Shaddowing thereby the straining or pressing out of Christs bloud in his agony, before hee was taken, and stript to be crucified, Luk. 22. 44.

                              1. THe dayly sacrifice was a Lambe,
                              
                                 So our sacrifice, not dayly, but once for all, offered vp vnto the Father, is the Lambe Christ Iesus, Heb. 7.
                           
                           
                              2. It was slaine in

the morning, and in the euening,
                              
                                 To shew not onely that morning and euening wee
                                 
                                 should exercise our selues in the worship of God: but also, that it was not in the latter dayes alone, that Christ was slaine, but was so in the Lords Decree, liuely apprehension of Faith, and vertue of his death, to all true beleeuers, from the beginning of the world, Ioh. 1. 29.
                           
                           
                              3. It was to be offered vp with fine Flowre, beaten Oyle, and Wine.
                              
                                 To shew that Christ by his death and oblation becomes not onely vnto vs Redemption, but spirituall foode, gladnes, and cheering comfort, yea all in all vnto vs, 1. Cor. 1. 30.
                           
                           
                              4. Where this sacrifice was offered, there the Lord made appointment to speak vnto Israel, and shew himselfe, Exod. 29. 42.
                              
                                 To signifie, that in Christ and through his death and bloudshed, the new appointment, or Couenant of his will, and manifestation of his grace and mercy is established to his Church, Heb. 9.
                           
                        
                     
                  
                  
                     35. The Sinne-offering.
                     
                        
                           
                              1. THe bloud of the sinne-offering
                              
                                 Shewing, how the bloud of Christ Iesus our true sinne-offering, behooued t
                                       •…
                                    
                                 
                              
                           
                           
                           
                              (what beast so euer it were) was to be powred out.
                              
                                 be powred out and shed vpon the Crosse. For without bloudshedding there was no reconciliation, Heb. 10.
                           
                           
                              2. The Priest shall dip his finger in the bloud of the Bullock that is a sinne-offering, and sprinkle thereof seuen times before the Lord.
                              
                                 Shaddowing the perfection of that expiation, and satisfaction for sinne, which Christ should make, in the vertue, quality, and perpetuitie thereof (the number of seuen being the number of perfection.) Heb. 9. 26.
                           
                           
                              3. The Priest shall bring in of the bloud of the Bullocke into the Tabernacle of the Congregation.
                              
                                 Shewing thereby, how the merit of Christs bloud should enter into the Holiest heauens to appease wrath, satisfie Iustice, and conciliate fauour, and bee a perfect purgation to his elect Church, Heb. 9. 14.
                           
                           
                              4. Of the bloud, the Priest shall put some also vpon the foure Hornes of the Altar.
                              
                                 Signifying thereby how the preaching of the Gospell, concerning the bloud of Christ, should bee published and proclaimed to the foure corners of the earth, Math. 28.
                           
                           
                           
                              5. And all the rest of the bloud shall be powred out at the foot of the Altar.
                              
                                 Figuring hereby, the aboundant shedding of the bloud of Christ, and super-aboundant merit thereof, Act. 22. 16. As likewise, that albeit it be so aboundant and sufficient for all, yet it is not efficient to all, but is improfitably powred out to many, through their owne contempt, and incredulous induration.
                              
                           
                           
                              6. All the fat vpon the inwards was to be burnt, and offered to the Lord,
                              
                                 To shew that all the best we haue, euen our inwards of soule, heart, and best affections, we should offer vnto the Lord, Psal. 16. 7. Rom. 12. 1. As also, that not onely should the body of Christ suffer, but his soule likewise (like the fat in the inwards, which is the best part) as in his Agony and cry on the Crosse is euident, cited before.
                              
                           
                           
                              7. The rest of the whole Bullocke (typing so Christ in strength) shall bee carried out of the Host, and bee burnt vpon the wood in

the fire, where the ashes are cast out.
                              
                                 Signifying that euen so Christ Iesus should suffer without the gate in the place of dead mens skuls, and not in the Citie, Heb. 13. 11, 12. and teaching vs thereby likewise to beare his reproch, going in affection
                                 
                                 out of this earthly citie of the world, and our body seeking a better, Heb. 13. 13.
                           
                           
                              8. The Priest shall eate the sin-offering in the holy place, whose bloud was not brought into the Tabernacle of the Congregation,
                              
                                 Shewing that Christ Iesus in his Church is not onely reconciliation, but also blessed foode for all those that are a holy and Royall Priesthood through him, Ioh. 6.
                           
                           
                              9. If any of the bloud of the sinne-offering was dropped vpon a garment, it might not be carried out so: but washed in the Holy place.
                              
                                 Signifying thereby, not only that holy things should not bee prophaned: but that without the Church also, there is no participation of the bloud of Christ, and so, no saluation, Ge. 5. Mar. 16. 15. Math. 7. 6.
                           
                           
                              10. The earthen vessell wherein the sin-offering that was eaten, was sodden, it was broken: but if it was a Brazen pot, it

was scowred and washed,
                              
                                 Expressing either the wonderfull pollution of sin, that so hardly can bee done away: or, that those who haue receiued recōciliation through Christ, ought not to giue themselues againe
                                 
                                 vnto the world, but keepe themselues cleane and vndefiled of the wickednesse thereof, 2. Cor. 5.
                           
                           
                              11. If a priuate person sinne, (and not the Priest, the Congregation or a Ruler) such a one shall offer a She-Goat, or a Female Lambe for a sinne-offering,
                              
                                 Yeelding thereby a cōfor

                                     to all women, that for that Sexe Christ should dye as wel as for men, and by faith through Christ, that they should bee co-heires of his Kingdome, Gal. 3. 28.
                           
                           
                              12. And if he were of the poorer sort, he should offer of Turtles or Pigeons (the signification whereof looke in the burnt-offering of Fowles,) or of fine Flowre, without putting Oyle or Incense thereto, for it is a sinne-offering.
                              
                                 Whereby was shaddowed, with Christ Iesus our sinne-offering, in the worke of satisfaction wee must ioyne nothing else, bee it neuer so plausible in mans conce

                              13. And the Priest shall make Atonement,

(still this is repeated.)
                              
                                 So euer signifying, that not in

                                 matter, which typed Christ, his office of reconciliation and intercession, whereby onely wee are accepted, Heb. 7.
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        The Disparitie.
                        THese Sacrifices were of Beasts: but our Sacrifice was of the Sonne of God himselfe. These could neuer sanctifie the commers thereunto, Heb. 10. 1. but in them was a yeerely remembrance of sinnes: ver. 3. but our Sacrifice Christ Iesus, sanctifieth all those that by a true Faith draw neere vnto him, purging the conscience from dead workes, to serue the liuing Lord. For the bloud of those Sacrifices, such as Buls and Goates, could not take away sinnes: but by the bloud of Christ we haue full remission of them. These sacrifices were often offered, in token of their imperfection, and the similitudes of heauenly things were purified onely with their bloud: but our Sacrifice was once onely offered, in token of the perfection thereof, and by the same, as by a better sacrifice, were the

heauenly things themselues purified and consecrate, Heb. 9. 23, 25.
                     
                  
                  
                     36. The meat-offering, Leuit. 2. and 6. 14. to 20.
                     
                        
                           
                              1. IT was called a meat-offering,
                              
                                 Because it was an acknowledgement that they did hold their meat or food of God, and had receiued it of his blessing: and because part thereof went as meat vnto the Priest: as likewise, teaching vs, that Christ Iesus is the true meat, and comfortable nourishment of euery hungry soule, once for all offered to the Father, and dayly in his Word and Sacraments offered and exhibited to vs, Ioh. 6.
                           
                           
                              2. If it bee of Flowre, it shall be fine Flowre, Leu. 2. 1.
                              
                                 Shewing thereby, that we should offer our best things to the Lord, and not the blind and the lame, and noting thereby also, the purity and perfection of Christ, Heb. 7. 26.
                           
                           
                              3. Oyle shall bee powred, and Incense put thereon,
                              
                                 Signifying, that with gladnesse▪ and delight our worship of the Lord should be, either in deuotion towards himselfe, or distribution towards his Saints: as
                                 
                                 also typing thereby that soft and louing kindnes, and sweet comfortable mediation of Christ for his Church, Heb. 7. 25.
                           
                           
                              4. It must be presented to the Priest, and he shall bring it to the Altar, verse 2.
                              
                                 Shaddowing that it is by Christ, and his oblation, that all our workes, and duties of Gods worship is onely acceptable, he interceding for vs, ibid.
                           
                           
                              5. It was a memoriall, that which burnt thereof, for a sweet sauour before the Lord,
                              
                                 Prefiguring, that euen so, Christ Iesus his death and merit thereof, should be an eternall memoriall before his Father, to be mercifull to vs, Heb. 9. 24.
                           
                           
                              6. The meat-offering which was cooked and prepared, was baked, fryed, or sodden,
                              
                                 Shewing the painefull and manifold sufferings of Christ thereby: and how our worship of God should not be raw, or zeale-lesse, Reu. 3. 16.
                           
                           
                              7. It must be without Leuen, verse 3.
                              
                                 Prefiguring that our worship of GOD must be without malice of our neighbour: as also the perfect purity of Christs life and doctrine, 2. Cor. 5. 9.
                           
                           
                           
                              8. It must haue no honey, which albeit it be sweet in taste, is bitter in effect, ingendring Choller, which also surfetteth the Eater of too much thereof, and being burnt, hath no good smell, verse 11.

                                 So was it by the secret Decree of the Lords allotment, that Christ should suffer, that so wee might escape damnation, Psal. 40. 7.

                                 Shewing, how euen so Christ Iesus should beare all the sinnes both great and small of his elect, and satisfie for them, and how that we by a true faith ought to lay them all vpon him, Rom. 5.
                           
                           
                              4. So bearing all

their iniquities, he was sent vnto a land of separation (saith the originall.) verse 22.
                              
                                 Figuring, that euen so should Christ Iesus bearing
                                 
                                 the iniquities of his Chosen, be carried forth of Ierusalem vnto death, whereby his soule was separate from his body a time, Esay 53. 12.
                           
                           
                              5. He was led out by a man appointed, verse 21.
                              
                                 Noting thereby, that the sinnes of man, euen of so many as are appointed to be saued by him, led Christ forth to suffer, ibid. ver. 3.
                           
                           
                              6. He who led him forth, must wash his flesh and cloathes after his returne, and then come into the Host, verse 26.
                              
                                 Signifying thereby, not onely, that, that which made Christ to dye, is the polluter of our soules: but also, that whosoeuer hath laid hand on Christ by a true faith, must leade a cleane and holy life, if hee would be accepted as one of Christs Church, purging himselfe of all vncleanenesse and iniquitie, 2. Cor. 5. 15.
                           
                        
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     40. The clensing of the Leper, Leuit. 14.
                     
                        
                           
                              1. THe Bird that was killed for that vse, was a Sparrow (one of the cleane sort of Birds) by whose bloud the Leper to be cleansed, behooued to be sprinkled seuen times, Leu. 14. 52.
                              
                                 Representing so the Lord Iesus, who like a Sparrow was of small account in the world, cleane and innocent, by whose bloud our leprous soules to bee clensed must be perfectly sprinkled, Esay 52. 14.
                           
                           
                              2. This Sparrow was killed ouer pure water, in an earthen vessell, Leu. 14. 5.
                              
                                 Signifying therby Christ Iesus, who hath suffered for vs, his innocency &amp; cleerenesse in our humane nature, Heb. 7. 26.
                           
                           
                              3. The liue Sparrow being dipt with Cedarwood, a Skarlet Lace, and Hysope, in the bloud of the Sparrow slaine, was let go into the broad field, verse 6.
                              
                                 Shaddowing thereby how that man by a true faith (which hath euer with it a feruent loue, and a sweet sanctified life) bathing himselfe in the bloud of Christ, by his death attaines both to life and freedome, Ioh. 14. 6.
                           
                           
                           
                              4. As also the dipping of the liue Sparrow into the bloud of the dead, and that of necessitie (behoouing to be so.)
                              
                                 Signified, that the impassible Deity of Christ can no wayes yeeld comfort to vs, considered alone, concerning the remission of sinnes, without the humane nature of Iesus Christ, that suffered for vs the death of the Crosse, Act. 20. 28. 2. Cor. 5. 19. Heb. 2. 14.
                           
                           
                              5. And the letting of the liue Sparrow flye in the open ayre or broad field, ver. 7.
                              
                                 Shaddowed Christ Iesus by death, once consecrate to bee the Author of eternall saluation, that hee should ascend on high, and be seated in the Holiest heauens, Heb. 9. 5, 7, 26.
                           
                           
                              6. The Leper that is healed, must wash his cloathes, and his flesh, &amp; shaue off his hayre, after he is discerned by the Priest to be cleane, before that hee must enter into the Host, and

there after must remaine seuen dayes before hee enter into his Tent, verse 8, 9.
                              
                                 Shewing that a rebellious or scandalous person by excommunication separate from the Church, becomming penitent, must not be againe rashly receiued, without euident proofes of his repentance giuen, both to Pastor and People, 2. Thes. 3.
                           
                           
                              7. The putting of the bloud then of his trespasse-offring vpon the right eare, thumb, and toe of him that was Leper, and of the oyle vpon all those places and his head, after hee had washed himselfe, Leu. 14. 17.
                              
                                 Signified the perfect expiation of the sinnes of euery penitent in Christs bloud, and consecration of them to Sanctification &amp; cleannesse of life thereafter, Act. 8. 22. 2. Cor. 2. 6.
                           
                        
                     
                  
                  
                     41. The sacrifice of the Red Cow, and the sprinkling water, Numb. 19.
                     
                        
                           
                              1. THe colour of this Kow was Red, Numb. 19. 2.
                              
                                 Whereby was betokened the bloudinesse of our Sauiour in his Passion, Mat. 27.
                           
                           
                              2. Shee behooued to bee without blemish, vpon whom neuer yoke came, ibid.
                              
                              
                                 Signifying thereby the perfect holinesse of Christ, who neuer bore the yoke of sinfulnesse, nor was subiect to the Precepts of man, Isai. 53.
                           
                           
                           
                              3. Shee was burned without the Host, and her bloud seuen times sprinkled before the Tabernacle of the congregation, ver. 3.
                              
                                 Shewing how Christ should suffer without the Citie, and his bloud should be a perfect purging of his Church, Heb. 13. 11.
                           
                           
                              4. She shall be all burned, and Cedar wood, a Skarlet Lace, and Hysop shall bee cast into the fire with her, ver. 6.
                              
                                 Shaddowing how that nothing in Christ is vnprofitable, and that through the eternall Spirit, by the sheading of his bloud, hee should offer vp himselfe wholly without fault vnto God, to purge our conscience from dead workes to serue the liuing Lord, an vncorrupt life, a feruent loue to mankinde, and sauoury obedience in all things to his Father, accompanying him in his sufferings, Ephes. 4. 2.
                           
                           
                              5. The ashes of this sin-offering was laid vp in a cleane place, to be made a Sprinkling Water for the Congregation, ver. 9.
                              
                                 Figuring thereby how the merit of the bloudshed and death of Christ, (the true Sinne-offering) in the Holiest heauens euer recent, should be a perpetuall purging and sprinkling water vnto his Church, Heb. 9. 13.
                           
                           
                           
                              6. That person that is defiled by the dead, and hath not the same sprinkled vpon him, shall bee cut off from Israel, verse 13.
                              
                                 Whereby was signified, that, that person that is defiled with the corruption of sinne, and hath not the bloud of Christ sprinkled vpon his soule, shall likewise bee cut off from the number and inheritance of the Saints, Mar. 16. 16.
                           
                           
                              7. The Priest onely shall sprinkle this water vpon the vncleane person, and purge him.
                              
                                 So it is Christ Iesus onely, who doth sprinkle his bloud vpon penitent soules who come vnto him, and from him onely is to be expected true pardon of our sinnes, Math. 9. 6.
                           
                        
                     
                     The signification of other things, looke in the preceding sacrifices.
                     
                        The Disparitie.
                        THis sprinkling water made of the Ashes of the Heifer, sprinkling them that were vncleane, sanctified onely as touching the purifying of the flesh: but the bloud of Christ, who through the eternall Spirit offered himselfe without fault to God, purges

the conscience from dead workes, to serue the liuing God, Heb. 9. 13, 14.
                     
                  
                  
                     42. IOSHV A.
                     
                        
                           
                              1. IOSHVA, a Sauiour.
                              
                                 So was Iesus both in name and in deed, Mat. 1.
                           
                           
                              2. He was the sonne of Nun, which is by interpretation, Eternall, and the seruant of Moses, Exod. 24.
                              
                                 So was Christ the Sonne of the truely eternall Father, and may be said to be Moses seruant in a sort; because hee followed after Moses in order, and subiected himselfe vnto Moses Law, in fulfilling what it commanded or typed, Mat. 5. 17.
                           
                           
                              3. Hee ouercame the enemies of Israel, and going before them, brought them into the Land of Canaan, allotting to each one their portion, Iosh. 13.
                              
                                 So hath Christ ouercome the enemies of his Church, and hath ascended vp on high into the heauens before vs, there to prepare a place for each one of vs, and to bring vs thither, Ioh. 14. 2.
                           
                           
                           
                              4. Moses beeing dead, hee was made the Captaine of Gods people, hee leading them to the Land: but Ioshua entering them in the Land, Deut. 31. 7.
                              
                                 So the Law ceasing, and the ceremonies thereof, he was appointed likewise the captaine of his Church: the Law leading to Christ and heauen through him: but Christ by his death and conquest giuing vs entry therein, Heb. 9.
                           
                           
                              5. Hee saued Rachabs house that had the Red cord hung out at the window, and who receiued his Spyes, Iosh. 6.
                              
                                 So doth Christ saue the soule of euery penitent sinner that hath true faith in his bloud, and the expressiue grace thereof receiuing his Word in their hearts, and the Ministers thereof for his cause, Isai. 49. 6.
                           
                           
                              6. Vnder Moses leading, the Cloud went before: but vnder Ioshua's the same did vanish.
                              
                                 So in the time of the Law, obseur
                                       •…
                                    e and darknesse was: but through the light of the Gospell vnder Christ the same did depart, Heb. 9. 13.
                           
                           
                              7. Ieshua was confirmed in his Calling, by the diuiding of

the waters in Iordan, at the presence of the Arke standing therein, Iosh. 3.
                              
                                 So was Christ in the same Iordan, by the diuiding of the heauens, and presence of the holy Spirit
                                 
                                 descending and resting vpon him, Math. 3.
                           
                           
                              8. Hee ledde Israel through those waters vnto Canaan.
                              
                                 So doth Christ his Chosen, through many afflictions, and death it selfe vnto heauen, Psal. 23.
                           
                           
                              9. Moses circumcised not the people: but Ioshua, Iosh. 5.
                              
                                 So the Law sanctifieth not, but grace through Christ, Rom. 8. 3. Heb. 7. 19.
                           
                           
                              10. Manna ceased vnder Ioshua in Canaan, Iosh. 5. 13.
                              
                                 So shall our knowledge of Christ by Word and Sacraments cease in that heauenly glory, Reu. 21. 23.
                           
                           
                              11. With the sounding of Rams Hornes by the Leuites, the Arke compassing Iericho, the high walles thereof fell down, and the inhabitants thereof were so ouercome by him, Iosh. 6.
                              
                                 So by the sound of the Word, albeit contemptible in the mouthes of his Ministers, Christ humbles the high machinations of mans heart, and ouercomes his Aduersaries, 1. Io. 2. 14.
                           
                           
                           
                              12. The earth (as the walles of Iericho) prostrated it selfe before him: the waters (as these of Iordan) yeelded vnto him, and the heauens (as the Sunne and Moone by their standing still) obeyed him, Iosh. 6. 3. &amp; 10.
                              
                                 So heauen and earth, and all things that are therein, bow themselues in reuerent obedience vnto the Lord Iesus, Phil. 2. 10.
                           
                           
                              13. Hee made his Captaines tread vpon the necks of the Canaanite Kings after the battell, whom hee had ouercome, and closed vp before, Iosh. 10.
                              
                                 So will Iesus doe to all his Chosen at their death: but especially at that day of generall Iudgement, shall hee make all their enemies, Satan, sinne and death, with all other their foes to be their footstoole, whose power euen in this life, and day of battell was abated and confined, Psal. 110. 2.
                           
                           
                              14. He accepted the Gibeonites who humbly intreated peace of him, Iosh. 9.
                              
                                 So doth Christ accept all penitent sinners, who in the time of grace come wisely vnto him, Luke 15. 11.
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                        The Disparitie.
                        
                           IOshua conquered Canaan, not only for the people of Israel, but also for himselfe in part: but Christ Iesus hath purchased that heauenly Canaan, only for our sakes, hauing had it himselfe before, by the right of inheritance. He conquest it not by himselfe alone, but with the ayde of the Tribes of Israel: but Christ hath by himselfe onely purchased that heauenly inheritance: he did the one without his owne bloudshed or death: but Christ hath not this other without both these: hee could not quite expell the Canaanite out of the Land: but Christ Iesus hath fully one and all ouercome our enemies.
                     
                  
                  
                     43. Gideon, Iudg. 6, 7, &amp; 8. compared.
                     
                        
                           
                              1. GIdeon, a Destroyer, or Breaker, who is called a Iudge, and a Sauiour

of Israel, by miracle confirmed in his Calling.
                              
                                 So is Christ a Destroyer of his enemies, and a Iudge, to iudge the cause of his Chosen, and to saue and deliuer them, whose Calling
                                 
                                 was confirmed in like manner by miracles, Math. 3. 1. Cor. 15. 57.
                           
                           
                              2. Before the battell with his foes, hee is comforted by the Angell, and assured of victory.
                              
                                 So was Christ before his conflict with death, and his other aduersaries, comforted in his Agony, Luk. 22.
                           
                           
                              3. Hee destroyed the Altar of Baal, and erected another vnto the Lord in that same place.
                              
                                 So hath Christ the worship of Heathenish Idols, and by the preaching of the Gospell established in place thereof, the true worship of God.
                              
                           
                           
                              4. He offered vp a sacrifice, which the Lord, by fire from heauen, declared to be acceptable.
                              
                                 So hath Christ offered vp himselfe, and wherein the Lord by his voice and Spirit from Heauen likewise, hath declared himselfe well-pleased, Mat. 3.
                           
                           
                              5. They who bowed downe on their knees to drinke of the waters, were counted vnfit Souldiours for Gideon.
                              
                              
                                 So they who delight in the pleasures of this world, and giue themselues vnto them, are as vnfit for Christ, Iude 4.
                           
                           
                           
                              6. Gideon is expounded by his Aduersaries to bee a Barley Cake, yet vvhich should ouerturne and throwe downe their Tents.
                              
                                 So was Christ vilipended by his enemies in the world, yet should ouerthrow them at last, and subdue them vnto him, Psal. 110.
                           
                           
                              7. By the sound of Trumpet, and shining of Lamps out of earthen broken vessels, he ouercame his enemies.
                              
                                 So by the trumpet of his Word, and light of the Gospell, carried thorow the world by weake instruments, hath he confounded his aduersaries, 1. Iohn 2. 14.
                           
                           
                              8. The swords of his Enemies killed themselues.
                              
                                 So doth the malice and practices of the enemies of Christ, against him or his, turne back into their owne bowels, Psal. 7. 15.
                           
                           
                              9. Hee was very meeke, and a man of no contention, as his answere to Ephraim shewes.
                              
                                 So was Christ meeke and humble, whose voice was not heard in the streets, Isai 42. 2.
                           
                           
                              10. After his victory he seuerely punished

the men of Succoth, who denied him bread in his extremitie.
                              
                                 So shall Christ punish those at that Great day,
                                 
                                 who when he was hungry, fedde him not, when hee hath subdued his enemies, and made them all his footstoole, Psal. 110. 2.
                           
                           
                              11. Gideon denied to raigne ouer Israel, but interceded for them, Iud. 6. 13.
                              
                                 So did Christ, beeing sought by the people to be a worldly King: but intercedeth in Heauen for his Church for euer, Heb. 8.
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        The Disparitie.
                        
                           GIdeon, not without other associates (as is said of Ioshua) ouercame his enemies: but Christ alone, without the ayde of any creature, ouercame his: he was loth a long time to vndergoe that Calling to deliuer Israel: but Christ most willingly and readily vndertooke to deliuer mankinde: his sonnes after his death were slaine and destroyed: but so cannot the children and sonnes of Christ be destroyed, their life beeing in his hands, and one hayre of whose head cannot fall to the ground without his good will and pleasure: He left an Ephod with the people,

which thereafter induced them to Idolatrie: but Christ hath left his Word with his Church, to preserue them from the same for euer.
                     
                  
                  
                     44. Iephte, Iudg. 11. and 12. compared.
                     
                     
                        
                           
                              1. IEPHTE, opening.
                              
                                 So is Christ the opening and manifestation of his Fathers will to vs, of our hearts also to himselfe, and of the gates of that heauenly Paradise to our soules after death, Heb. 9. Io. 14. 2.
                           
                           
                              2. Iephte was reiected of his brethren, and yet the Lord appointed none other to saue and deliuer them, but him.
                              
                                 So Christ, albeit he came to his owne, yet they receiued him not, but disdainfully refused him, and yet the Lord decreed him to be the onely sauer of his people, and that by no other Name vnder heauen wee should looke for saluation, but by the name of Iesus, Phil. 2. Act. 3. 6.
                           
                           
                              3. In time of a great bondage hee is

stirred vp to be a deliuerer of Israel.
                              
                              
                                 So in the time of the vniuersall bondage of sinne, Satan, and death, which
                                 
                                 had captiuate and thralled all men, Christ Iesus came to deliuer his Church, Hos. 13. 1. Cor. 15.
                           
                           
                              4. Hee punished and subdued after his victory the rebellious Ephraimites.
                              
                                 So shall Christ at the consummation of all things fully subdue all his rebellious enemies, Psal. 110.
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        The Disparitie.
                        
                           IEphte was begotten in sinne and whoredome: but Christ was begotten without sinne in Virginitie. Iephte offered his Daughter, which was an vnlawfull and vnacceptable sacrifice vnto the Lord: but Christ offered himselfe as a holy and acceptable sacrifice vnto his Father.

                              1. SAmson, or Shimshon, there the second time, because the Angell appeared twice vnto his Parents;

or hee was so called from Shemesh, which signifieth the Sunne.
                              
                                 So did the Angell appeare once to Mary at the Annunciation, and the second time to Ioseph in a dreame, resoluing him concerning the mysterie of
                                 
                                 Christs conception who is our Sunne of righteousnes, Math. 1. Luke 1.
                           
                           
                              2. Israel was in great thraldome and misery before his birth.
                              
                                 So was the Iewes, and the whole world in the thraldome of sinne, and ignorance, before Christs Birth, Rom. 3.
                           
                           
                              3. Vnexpectedly the Angell comes to his Mother, and albeit shee was barren, promiseth that shee should beare a sonne, who should deliuer Israel.
                              
                              
                                 So did the Angell to Mary▪ 
                                 and albeit shee was a 
                                       〈◊〉
                                    
                                    ▪ promises the same likewise, Luk. 1. 30.
                           
                           
                              4. The Angel confirmed his promise by a signe to Samsons mother.
                              
                                 So did the Angell to Mary, in saying, And behold, thy cousin Elizabeth, &amp;c. verse 36.
                           
                           
                              5. Samsons parents were at first terrified and astonied, but thereafter were comforted.
                              
                                 So was Mary and Ioseph at first troubled in minde, but thereafter by Christs Birth comforted, Luke 1. 29. Mat. 1.
                           
                           
                           
                              6. Samson grew, and the Spirit waxed strong vpon him: and he was a Nazarite.
                              
                              
                                 So did Christ in body, and in fauour with GOD and Man, and the Spirit was not measured vnto him, and hee was also a Nazarite, Luke 2. 52. Math. 2.
                           
                           
                              7. He tooke not a Wife of his owne people, but a stranger of the Philistims.
                              
                                 So hath Christ his Church, not so much of Iewes as Gentiles, who were aliens from God, Isai. 55. 5.
                           
                           
                              8. He assayed his strength first on a Lyon, who assaulted him in the way, when hee was going to seeke his wife, out of which a little thereafter hee tooke forth honey.
                              
                                 So did Christ manifest his matchlesse strength, first on Satan who tempted him in the Wildernesse, when he was entring in his calling after Baptisme, and ouercame him. Whereof we that are tempted in like manner, may gather this comfort, that he that ouercame for vs, will also ouercome in vs, Heb. 4. 15.
                           
                           
                              9. Hee put forth his minde to the Philistims in a Riddle.
                              
                                 So did Christ his doctrine to the Pharises in Parables, Math. 13. 34.
                           
                           
                           
                              10. He was sold by Dalilah for mony, and vnder shew of loue is traitoured to the Philistims.
                              
                                 So was Christ by Iudas, for thirty pieces of money, and with a kisse and salutation was betrayed to the Priests, Scribes and Pharises, Math. 25.
                           
                           
                              11. He was bound, led away, blinded and at their Feast, brought forth, bound to a Pillar and mocked: but by that Pillar and pulling downe thereof, hee destroyed more of his enemies at his death, then hee did in his life.
                              
                                 So was Christ bound, ledde away, blinded with bloud and spettle, and at last, at the Feast of the Passeouer, was nailed to the Crosse, and mocked at: but by that crucifying on the Crosse, he destroyed his enomies in a greater degree by his death, then euer they were in the time of his life, Luk. 23. 1. Cor. 15. 57.
                           
                           
                              12. His Brethren thereafter buried him.
                              
                                 So after Christs death, Ioseph of Arimathea, and others of the godly buried him, ibid. verse 50.
                           
                           
                              13. The strength of Samson for a time lurked in the prison.
                              
                                 So did the power of Christs Deity in the graue.
                              
                           
                           
                              14. Notwithstanding

that he was watched in Gaza, that he might not escape: yet when al were asleepe, he tooke off the gates of the Citie, and carried them away vnto the Mountaine with him.
                              
                                 So notwithstanding that Christ was watched in the
                                 
                                 graue, that he might not be taken away: yet when all the souldiers were asleepe, hee gloriously arose, ouercomming so the power of death and the graue, and carrying the triumphant victory thereof with him vnto heauen, Luk. 24.
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        The Disparitie.
                        
                           SAmson lost his former strength when hee was betrayed, &amp; was apprehended, because he could not be able to resist: but so lost not Christ Iesus his powerfull strength when hee was betrayed, which hee did manifest, by his Word, asking, Whom seek you? and saying, I am he: in making the Souldiers that came to take him, fall backward to the ground; and in that he said to Peter, that he was able to cō
                           mand millions of Angels to assist him if hee listed; so that willingly hee offered himselfe, and was not violently taken. Also, Samsons Wife was taken from him, and giuen to another:

but the Spouse of Christ his Church, can no creature take from him or giue out of his hand. The ouerthrowe of his enemies, was his ouerthrow likewise, and as they dyed, so he dyed; but so it was not with Christ, for they onely did bruise his heele: but hee did breake their head: they assaulted him onely violently: but he wounded them mortally, and ouercame.

                              1. SAmuel, or Shemuel, appointed or heard of God.
                              
                                 So was Christ appointed to bee the Sauiour of mankinde, and was heard of the Lord in all things he desired, Heb. 6.
                           
                           
                              2. Hee was in fauour with God and Man, 1. Sam. 2. 26.
                              
                                 So was Christ, and did grow in both, Luk. 2. 52.
                           
                           
                              3. He was called of God, and the Lord manifested his will to him, 1. Sam. 3. 4.
                              
                                 So was Christ called of the Father, and had the cleere and full manifestation of his will to declare to mankinde, Ioh. 8. 46. Acts 7. 37.
                           
                           
                           
                              4. Hee was borne by expectation of any, of the barren wombe of Hanna, and dedicate to the Lord, 1. Sam. 1.
                              
                                 So was Christ of the blessed wombe of a chaste Virgin Mary, and consecrate vnto the Father, Math. 1.
                           
                           
                              5. He was Priest, Prophet, and Ruler in Israel, 1. Sam. 3. 4, 7, 5.
                              
                                 So is Christ all these most truely in his Church, Heb. 9. Ioh. 18. Ioh. 8.
                           
                           
                              6. He was most diligent and faithfull in Gods worke, and of a most innocent life, 1. Sam. 7. 16. 12. 12.
                              
                                 So was Christ Iesus in all these vncomparable and matchlesse.

                                 Euen so was Christ of the Iewes, (his owne People, whom so faine he would haue gathered) who repudiating him likewise, professed that they had no King, but Caesar, Iohn 19. 15.
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                        The Disparitie.
                        THe sonnes of Samuel were wicked, and walked not in his wayes: but the children and sonnes of Iesus Christ are holy and sanctified, and tread in his footsteps, following his example of life. Hee deliuered the gouernment from him vnto wicked Saul: but so shall Christ Iesus deliuer vp his Kingdome to none, nor the Regiment of his Church, till all things be fulfilled, and the number of his Chosen accomplished.
                     
                  
                  
                     47. Dauid, 1. Sam. 13, &amp;c.
                     
                        
                           
                              1. DAuid, beloued, or a man according to Gods own heart, 1. King. 14. 8.
                              So was Christ that truely welbeloued of God, in whom his soule was well content and pleased, Mat. 3. 17.
                           
                           
                              2. Hee was a Shepheard, 1. Sam. 17. 15.
                              So is Christ the true Shepheard of our soules, 1. Pet. 2.
                           
                           
                              3. Hee pulled the
                                 
                                 Sheepe out of the Lyons mouth, and the Lambe out of the pawes of the Beare, 1. Sam. 17.
                              So hath Christ powerfully deliuered his owne

Chosen Flocke out of the power of Satan and damnation, 1. Cor. 15. 57.
                           
                           
                              4. Hee was anointed to bee King and Ruler of Israel, 1. Sa. 16.
                              So i
                                    •…
                                  Christ with the oyle of gladnes, to bee the Ruler and King of his Church, Ier. 23. 5.
                           
                           
                              5. Betweene the time of his anointing, and installing in the possession of the kingdome, many troubles and persecutions interuened.
                              
                              So betweene the anointing of Christ, with the fulnesse of the Spirit, and his glorious installing in the Kingdome of the Father, many afflictions and persecutions, yea death it selfe for our sakes interuened likewise, Isai. 53.
                           
                           
                              6. Though hee suffered innocently: yet hee was meeke and mercifull to all his persecuting enemies, 1. Sam. 24, &amp;c.
                              
                              So, though Christ suffred causelessely, yet euer he offered grace and mercy, and prayed for his crucifiers, Isai. 53. 12.
                           
                           
                           
                              7. Hee was a Prophet also in Israel, Math. 27. 35.
                              So was Christ that Great Prophet of his Church, Act. 7. 37. Ioh. 1.
                           
                           
                              8. He deliuered the Host of Israel from that great Goliah, whom he killed, albeit beeing little of account: and with his own sword he cut off his head, 1. Sam. 17.
                              So hath Christ deliuered his Church, which none else could doe, from that fearful Giant Satan, whom he hath ouercome, albeit contemptible in the eyes of the world, and with his own machinations hath trod downe his head, Genes. 3. 15.
                           
                           
                              9. The Lord honoured him with many and great victories, 1. Sam. 18. 2. Sa. 21.
                              So likewise did he Christ Iesus ouer that old Serpent, and all our spirituall enemies, 1. Cor. 15.
                           
                           
                              10. Hee brought back the Arke againe, 2. Sam. 6.
                              So hath Christ Iesus the trueth that lay obscured by the false interpretation of the Scribes and Pharises, Math. 5. 6. &amp;c. and hath reduced the Church from the spirituall captiuitie thereof fully, and from the obscurenesse of types, to the cleere beholding of the bright substance, establishing it in that estate for euer, Heb. 9.
                           
                           
                              11. Euen those that
                                 
                                 sate at his Table, rose vp against him, Psal. 41. 9.
                              So one of Christs Disciples, Iudas, who did dip

in the platter with him, betrayed him, Math. 26.
                           
                           
                              12. Last, in many Prophetical speeches hee typed Christ Iesus, as, Thou wilt not suffer thy Holy One to see corruption: and, They parted my garments amongst them, &amp; on my vesture did cast Lots; My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? and such like many, as are quoted and set downe orderly in the Treatise following.
                              
                              All which, in competencie of substantiall trueth, agreed properly to Christ Iesus alone.
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        The Disparitie.
                        
                           DAuid was a man of bloud: but Christ Iesus was meeke and peaceable. Dauid for that cause was not suffered to build the Temple: but Christ Iesus is the sole and onely builder of his holy Church. His life was tainted with sundry blots: but the life of Christ was altogether spotlesse.

                              1. SAlomon, or Shelomoh, peaceable, the sonne of Dauid, greatly beloued of God, 2. Sa. 12. 24.
                              So was Christ peaceable, yea, the Prince of Peace it selfe, called also the sonne of Dauid, because hee came of him according to the flesh, and who receiued that Testimony from Heauen, that he was the Lords Well-beloued, in whom hee is well pleased, Math. 3. 17.
                           
                           
                              2. Hee was very wise and rich, yea, aaboue all others therin, 1. Kin. 3. &amp; 4.
                              So is Christ the very wisedome and full treasure of the riches of the Father, and matchlesse in both, Col. 2. 3.
                           
                           
                              3. The Queene of Sheba came to see Salomon from afarre, and brought gifts vnto him, 1. King. 10.
                              So came the Wise men from the East to see Iesus, and offered Gold, Myrrh, and Incense to him, Mat. 2.
                           
                           
                              4. The fame of Salomons speeches and doings spred afarre off.
                              
                              So did the fame of Christ Iesus his doctrine and miracles, Mat. 5. 31.
                           
                           
                           
                              5. Hee built the Temple, and dedicate it to the Father, 1. King. 6.
                              So hath Christ built the Church, and consecrate it vnto his Father, Gal. 3. 7, 8.
                           
                           
                              
                                 He desired that all that should pray within the Temple, might be heard, 1. King. 8.
                              So Christ intercedeth, that all that pray in his holy Church, as true members thereof, may bee likewise heard, Ioh. 17.
                           
                           
                              7. Hee appointed the seuerall Ministers and Office-bearers in the Temple.
                              
                              So hath Christ established the seuerall ministeriall functions and offices, that should bee in his Church, 1. Cor. 12.
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        The Disparitie.
                        
                           SAlomon did fall away in the end of his life from that sinceritie, especially in Gods worship, which hee had in the beginning, therefore procured a heauy punishment on his house after him: but Christ Iesus constantly perseuered vnto death, in that perfect obedience that hee yeelded alway to the Father, and therefore procured great blessings on his Church thereby for euer.
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     49. Salomons Temple, 1. King. 6. as it was a type of Christs personall body, Ioh. 2. 19.
                     
                        
                           
                              1. IT was a most glorious edifice, 1. King. 5. 6, 7. Chapters.
                              
                              So was the excellent Fabricke of the Immaculate body of Christ.
                           
                           
                              2. It was stone without, and gold within.
                              
                              To shew the resplendent glory of diuine Maiestie, lurking within a humane and humbled body, Esa. 9.
                           
                           
                              3. It was full of light through the many windowes therein.
                              
                              So our Sauiour was full of heauenly knowledge in the will of God, which hee reuealed to mankinde, Ioh. 1.
                           
                           
                              4. It was carued round about with Cherubims, Palmes and Flowers,
                              
                              To note the seruiceable &amp; ready attendance of the holy Angels vpō the person of Christ, the Palme-trees signifying his triumphant victory ouer his and our enemies, and the Flowres, his heauenly, diuers, and flourishing graces, Math. 4.
                           
                           
                           
                              5. In the seuenth yeere, and Haruest moneth it was accomplished.
                              
                              To shew not onely the perfection of his person (signified by that perfect number of seuen, and ripenesse of such a season as Harnest) but also that in the fulnesse of time, to accomplish Gods Decree, hee should come and bee incarnate, Psal. 40. 7.
                           
                           
                              6. The Temple was solemnely consecrate vnto the Lord.
                              
                              So was the person of Christ, by perfect obedience in life and death, vnto his Father, ibid.
                              
                           
                           
                              7. There was pleasant Musicke vsed in the one,
                              
                              Which signified the heauenly harmony of diuine graces to the comfort of his Chosen, which should bee in this other, Col. 2. 3.
                           
                           
                              8. In it was the Arke, where the glory of GOD did appeare, which glory did fill also the Temple.
                              
                              So in Christ is the full treasure of all true wisedome, knowledge, &amp; grace, and in whom the Godhead personally inhabited, and did replenish likewise this other, Col. 1. 19.
                           
                           
                              9. It was seated on Mount Moriah, and in the midst of Ierusalem it did stand.
                              
                              So Christ is on high placed, and in the midst of his Church is to bee found, Psal. 110.
                           
                           
                           
                              10. It was not lawfull but in the Temple to offer sacrifice.
                              
                              So is not any spirituall sacrifice of ours, but in Christ, and through him acceptable, Heb. 7.
                           
                           
                              11. Many presumed in the one, saying, The Temple of the Lord, The Temple of the Lord, yet were destroyed.
                              
                              So many presume in the verbal profession of Christ, that they beleeue in him, and are baptized in his Name, yet shall bee damned, Math. 7. 22.
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        The Disparitie.
                        FOrty and sixe yeeres the Temple was in building, after that the same had beene destroyed, and cast downe by the Babylonians: but within three dayes the Temple of the body of Christ Iesus did arise, after that the same had beene in a manner destroyed, and crucified by the Iewes and Romanes, Ioh. 2. 19, 20, 21.
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     50. The Temple, as it was a type of Christs mysticall body, the Church. 1. King. 6.
                     
                        
                           
                              1. IT was of hewne polished stones and costly.
                              
                              So is the mysticall body of Christ of liuely polished stones, euen purged and reformed soules, costly &amp; precious in the Lords sight, Col. 1. 18. Psal. 45. 10.
                           
                           
                              2. In the building of it there was no noise heard.
                              
                              So in the building of the Church, the vnity of truth, and of the Spirit of loue is hereby recommended, without iarring either in opinion, or affection. As also, in that the stones were fitted for the worke, before they were brought to be built therein; it shewes, that before we can thinke, that we are to be counted as stones ready to bee builded in that body and Temple of the Church, we must be fitted and reformed likewise, Isa. 4. 3.
                           
                           
                              3. There concurred not onely to the building thereof Salomon, and his seruants: but also Hiram of Tyrus, and the Sidonians,

                                 that did hew the Timber vnto it.
                              
                              To shew that in the building of the Church, Iew and Gentile should concurre: not onely the Apostles planting and founding the same, but their successors, faithfull Pastors euery

where watering it, and building on their ground, 1. Cor. 13.
                           
                           
                              4. It was ouerlaid within with fine gold vpon the carued Cedars.
                              
                              To shew the beauty of the Church, adorned with diuers gifts, to be inward, pure, and precious, though vnseene, and not perceiued of the world, Psal. 45.
                           
                           
                              5. In the Temple were many windows, to make the house light.
                              
                              So in the Church is the dispensation of many and diuers graces, to make the same bright and glorious, 1. Cor. 12. 4.
                           
                           
                              6. In the Temple were seuerall degrees of Galleries or Lofts, each one aboue another, and larger each then other,
                              
                              To shew the seuerall roomes and places, which God hath appointed in his Church: some higher, some lower; Apostles, Euangelists, Doctors, Pastors and Elders, &amp;c. the same also being signified, by the diuersitie of Officers appointed in the Temple, ibid.
                              
                           
                           
                              7. The walles were carued round about,

with Cherubims, Palme-Trees, and Flowers.
                              
                              To note the protection of the Church of God, by the ministerie of Angels,

(tho outwardly vnseene) and the peaceable victorious flourishing vnder the same, Heb. 1.
                           
                           
                              8. In the seuenth yeere, and in the haruest moneth it was finished.
                              
                              So in the fulnesse of time, when the great Haruest shall be, the number of the Elect beeing accomplished, then shall the Church bee wholly in a triumphant cōpany consummate, Re. 21. 22.
                           
                           
                              9. Salomon consecrate the Temple vnto the Lord.
                              
                              So hath Christ, (that true Prince of Peace) his Church vnto his Father, Ioh. 17.
                           
                           
                              10. The Musicke that was vsed in the one,
                              
                              Did signifie the ioy of the faithfull in the other, Esai. 4. 2.
                           
                           
                              11. In it was the Arke of the Testimonie.
                              
                              So in the Church is the Word of God, and couenant of Grace, borne by the Leuites of Christs true Pastors, in the preaching and publishing of the same.
                           
                           
                              12. The glory of the Lord filled the Temple.
                              
                              So doth the glorious presence of God fill euer the other, beeing amongst his Chosen till the end of the world, Ioh. 14.
                           
                           
                           
                              13. The Lord promised to hallow this House, and that his eyes and heart, if his people obeyed him, should bee there perpetually.
                              
                              So will the Lord sanctifie his Church, and if wee obey him constantly, his eye of mercy, and heart of compassion will be vpon vs eternally, 1. Cor. 1. 30.
                           
                           
                              14. In the Porch thereof were set two Pillars of Brasse, Iachin and Boaz, or stabilitie and strength, with Lillies &amp; Pomegranates carried vpon them.
                              
                              Noting thereby the stabilitie and strength of Christs Church through him, who is as a double Pillar vnto the same; or the two Sacraments of the Church, whereby our faith is strengthened and confirmed vnto holinesse, and fruitfulnesse in good works, Iam. 2.
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        The Disparitie.
                        THe stones of the Temple were dead and senselesse: but the members of the Church of God, are sensible and liuely stones. They were polished and hewne by the hand of man, but these are reformed and sanctified

by the Spirit of Grace. The Temple vvas vtterly destroyed and burnt by the enemies of Israel: but the true Church of God can neuer be so ouerthrowne: yea, the very gates of hell shall not preuaile against it.
                        Note that some things heere are rather for conueniencie of case compared, then any typicall signification is in them sought, as hath beene said in the Epistle hitherto.
                     
                  
                  
                     Elisha compared.
                     
                     
                        
                           
                              1 ELisha, the health of God.
                              
                              So is Christ the health and saluation of God truely to all sick and lost soules, Math. 9. 12.
                           
                           
                              2. Hee succeeded Eliah, who anointed him to bee after him, 1. Kin. 19. 16.
                              So Christ succeeded the Baptist (that second Eliali) who baptized him, to come after him likewise, with the baptisme of the fire and Spirit to baptize, Luke 3.
                           
                           
                              3. He receiued the double of the Spirit of Eliah, 2. Kin. 2. 9.
                              So, Christ got not onely the double, but the full measure of the Spirit which Iohn had, and that without measure, Ioh. 1. 14.
                           
                           
                           
                              4. He cured Naaman of his Leprosie, hee raised the dead, healed the waters that were poisoned, with few loaues miraculously hee fed many, &amp;c. and did many such miracles, 2. Kin. 5. &amp; 2. &amp; 4.
                              
                                 So Christ doth cure our spirituall Leprosie by the bathing of his bloud, and tempers the waters of affliction to vs, fed likewise many thousands with few loaues, raised the dead, and dayly raiseth dead soules by the quickening of his grace, and did farre many and greater miracles and wonders.
                              
                           
                           
                              5. Elisha had an vntrue and couetous Gehezi that serued him, who therefore was fearefully punished, 2. King. 5.
                              
                                 So Christ had a false and couetous Iudas, who followed him, who therefore also fearefully perished, Math. 26.
                           
                           
                              6. Elisha was called the Chariot &amp; Horsemen of Israel, 2. King. 13.
                              
                                 So Christ is the Chariot whereby wee are carried vnto heauen, and the sure defence and safegard of his Chosen, against all their enemies, Zech. 14. 12.
                           
                           
                              7. He diuided the waters of Iordan with

his Cloake, 2. King. 2. 14.
                              
                                 So hath Christ made a safe way through death, by
                                 
                                 his Crosse, Heb. 9. Psal. 23.
                           
                           
                              8. They that mocked Elisha, were fearefully deuoured, 2. Kin. 2. 23.
                              
                                 So shall all those that mock Christ Iesus or his messengers, iustly bee destroyed, 2. Thes. 2. 10.
                           
                           
                              9. No thing so secret could be hid from Elisha, 2. King. 6. 8. &amp; 32.
                              
                                 So no secret thought of the very heart, can bee hid from Christ, Mat. 9. 4.
                           
                           
                              10. A dead body beeing cast into the Sepulchre of Elisha, touching his bones is raised againe, 2. King. 13. 21.
                              
                                 So are our dead soules quickened and raised heere by the touch of Christ by faith, and so shall our dead bodies also bee raised from the graue hereafter by the vertue of his Resurrection, who was laid in the graue likewise, Rom. 4 25.
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        The Disparitie.
                        
                           ELisha was of a seuere Spirit, as appeares in the example of the children who mocked him, and of his seruant Gehezi, &amp;c. but Christ was of a most milde and meeke Spirit,

as is euidently to be seene in his patient sufferings of all iniuries without reuenge; yea, he kissed the mouth of him that betrayed him, and cured the eare of Malchus who came out against him.

                                 So was Christ that matchlesse manifester of heauenly and hid mysteries, ibid. and Ioh. 8.
                           
                           
                              3. Hee was made one of the three Rulers of the whole Kingdome, Dan. 5. 29.
                              
                                 So is Christ, with the Father and Holy Ghost, one of the Rulers of all the Kingdome of Heauen and of earth, with all things that therein are, Ioh. 3. 35.
                           
                           
                              4. Hee was preferred by the King, to be aboue all the other Rulers in the whole Realme, Dan. 6. 3.
                              
                                 So Christ is by the Father aduanced aboue all powers aboue or below, whatsoeuer, Psal. 110.

                                 So was Christ Iesus likewise

                                 So was Christ a stranger in this wicked world, his proper seat beeing the heauens, and an alien from sinne, and eternall confusion, the wages thereof.
                              
                           
                           
                              2. He is called the Elect one of God in a speciall manner, Hag. 2. 24.
                              
                                 So is Christ Iesus the same most truely and properly.
                              
                           
                           
                              3. The Lord promiseth to make him as a Signet, signifying thereby that his dignity and glory should be most excellent.
                              
                                 Which

                                    rely and fully is accomplished in Christ.
                              
                           
                           
                              4. He was a Prince of his people.
                              
                                 So is Christ the onely Prince of his Chose
                                       •…
                                    .
                              
                           
                           
                              5. He was appointed by God to build the materiall temple.
                              
                                 So was Christ Iesus to build the spiritual Temple.
                              
                           
                           
                           
                              6. That which he built, was as nothing in outward shew, in comparison of the first Temple: but yet it was more glorious inwardly, in respect of the Lords filling it with his presence, and giuing of his peace therein, Hag. 2. 4. 8. &amp; 10.
                              
                                 So the Church which Christ hath built, is as nothing in outward glorious shew, being base and contemptible in this world, but (like the Kings daughter) she is all glorious within, by the spirituall presence of her builder, her Head, and Husband Iesus, who with his presence giues her also his peace, which the world can neither giue, receiue, nor take away from her.
                              
                           
                           
                              7. All nations, and the desire of all nations shall be moued to come to this Temple of the Lord, Hag. 2. 8.
                              
                                 Fore-prophecying so that accomplishment in the conuersion of the Gentiles, to the cleere Faith, and true Church of Iesus.

                  TO THE REVEREND AND RIGHT Worshipfull, D. YOVNG, Deane of Winchester.
                  
                  
                     Right Worshipfull,
                  
                  
                     
                        THe Lord, who is the God of order, abhorring confusion, hath by degrees of light, from time to time manifested that hid treasure of his mercy, and our comfort,

fore-shaddowing first by Types, then fore-shewing by Prophecies, and at last pointing more cleerely and particularly at that Lambe of God, by the Baptist his fore-runner. So that each age and manner of Reuelation hath had still the cleerer Demonstration of the Messiah, who was approching: Euen as the earth more and more is illuminate, the neerer the Sunnes arising vpon our Horizon is at hand: like Noah who first opened the window of the Arke wherein he was, then remooued the couering thereof, and at last stept forth himselfe. This is the Ladder

which Iacob saw comming thus downe from Heauen, by the seuerall degrees of cleerer and neerer manifestation; and the Starry fore-guiding light, leading at last to the place where the Babe was, but there standing and vanishing without further progresse.
                  
                  
                     So that it is a maruell how that the Vaile so long should be vpon the eyes of Israel, or the Kall of induration vpon the heart of Iudah; but that euen when hee came, marking euery plain Prophesie, that was foretold of him, and seeing the fulfilling of the same in his Person, they might haue knowne their King.
                  
                  
                     
Herod conuocates all the Ecclesiasticall sort, and askes where he should be borne; and they answere, At Bethleem: For so it was writtē, there they saw his Humilitie at his first entrance into the world: and why then trusted they not likewise their owne quotation, and embraced their Lord?
                  
                  
                     Let them peruse in like maner, the rest of these Prophecies that are spoken of him, (according to the particulars of the Treatise following) and (laying aside their stiffe-neckednes, of old vpbraided vnto them) truely apply, and they shall beforced to come to that

conclusion of Apollos, that it 
                     Acts 8. 28. 
                     is euident by Scripture, That Iesus is that Christ, all those things spoken of the Messiah, agreeing to him alone, and being applyable to no other besides.
                  
                  
                     The humble abasement of this lowly Lord, comming in the shape of a Seruant, and dying so ignominious a death for mankinde, beeing the cause of this stumbling of theirs, they expecting a worldly glorious King, and a corporall Deliuerance. Therefore Isaiah, foreseeing their incredulity for this cause, cryes out, Who will Isaiah 53. beleeue our report? or to

whom is the arme of the Lord reuealed? And holy Simeon Luke 2. 34. 
                     pronounceth him to be appointed for the rising &amp; fall of many in Israel, and for a signe which should bee spoken against; the wise Economie of the Lords grace beeing herein manifested, that by the reiection for a time, the fulnesse of the Gentiles might bee accomplished, all men might taste of grace, &amp; the ends of the earth might be his Sonnes possession. 
                     psal. 2.
                  
                  
                     But would they enter within the Vayle, and behold what glory of the Holiest is vnder the base outward couering of the Arke, and by a holy consideration

digge within the earth of his humanitie, and they should finde the glorious Pearle and treasure of the incomprehensible Deity, manifesting it selfe in his life, in matchlesse miracles, possible onely to that nature to performe; so that the simple people are forced to confesse, that none could do such things, except GOD were with him, discouering it selfe also in his death by fearefull wonders: so that the Centurion proclaimes, Of a surety he was the Sonne of God: and after his glorious Resurrection and Ascension, notwithstanding the mightiest opposition

of the world, and Prince thereof, by strait Lawes, close imprisonments, cruel torments, farre exilements, and sundry sorts of death; yet this crucified Iesus, by a few Fishermen, whom he made Fishers of men, subdued the world in short space to himselfe, making Emperours to lay downe their crownes at his feet, who was crowned with Thornes, their Scepters to sway to the aduancement of his Kingdome, in whose hand a Reed, for a Scepter, was sometimes mockingly put; their Empires, Oracles, Idols, and former Heathenish worship, like Dagon

falne before the Arke, lying ouerthrowne, striken dumbe, broken in pieces, and (as Sisera before Iael) prostrate at the foot of his Crosse, by ignorance (as the world accounted) subduing learning, by simplicitie, wisedome; by humilitie, pride; by weakenesse, power, by meeknesse, cruelty; by suffering, obtaining victory; and by shame, attaining to glory, the most glorious and most mighty Kingdomes which wee see, beeing but small pieces of their Conquests, and Monuments of their Trophe.
                  
                  
                     What a death then is this, that hath done such things 
                           〈◊〉
                        
                        
all the liuing could not doe? What matchlesse power is this that hath wrought such incredible things by weaknesse, by contempt, by the folly of preaching? What base meanes is this to bring down highest▪ Powers, Principalities, Thrones and Dominions? And how comes it to passe, that these conquerors at last glorie to dye for him, who dyed such a cursed, and shamefull death, but that they know hee liueth and reigneth for euer? and thereby they (hauing liued heere by grace in him, and dyed witnessing for him) should bee brought to liue and reigne in

glory eternally with him?
                  
                  
                     But our hope (according to the promise) is, that the Vaile at last will be taken from their eyes, and Iapheth and Sem shall be found in one Tent: the Lord will powre wpon the House of Dauid, and vpon 
                     Zech. 12. 10. 
                     the Inhabitants of Ierusalem, the Spirit of grace and of compassion, and they shall looke on him whom they haue pearced.
                  
                  
                     These paines, Sir, that I haue taken herein, I haue dedicate to your Name, as a testimony of my more then deserued duty and affection to you, which I shall thinke my selfe euer bound to owe,

for your manifold courtesies, whereof at your last being in your owne natiue Countrey, I had sufficient proofe; especially, not onely in that accesse of LEVI to his Sacred MAIESTIE, by your meanes, and your vnmerited speeches there-anent: but likewise in that Royall gracing of the same which thereafter ensued, and of the Author (though vnworthy) thereof. The experience therefore of your modest, humane, and most gentle inclination, assures mee at this time, of your owne courteous and kind acceptation of this harmonicall

consent, (in making the Old Testament (as it were) by the hand to leade in the New; and the Trumpet of the Prophets to sound the newes of the Gospell) without the needing many (if any) words, earnestly to sute the same. Receiue therefore, Sir, from an affectionate heart, and dutifull hand, this small Pledge of gratitude and remembrance, and what weakenesse or defect is therein, let your better ability and learned Iudgement couer, support, and supply the same. Whereunto remitting and recommending it: Beseeching God to multiply vpon

you the growth of his grace, and sensible blessing, and that with our Master Iesus, you may dayly grow more &amp; more in fauour both with God and Man.

                     1. His Fore-runner, the BAPTIST.
                     
                        BEHOLD, I will send my Messenger, Malachy 3. 1. and he shall prepare the way before me, &amp;c.
                     A Voice cryeth Isaiah 40. 3. in the Wildernesse, Prepare you the way of the Lord, make strait in the desart a path for our God.
                     Euery valley shall be exalted, Verse 4.
                        
and euery Mountaine shall bee made low, and the crooked shall be streight, and the rough places plaine.
                     And the glory of the Lord shal be reuealed, and all flesh shal Verse 5. see it together: for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.
                     And thou, Babe, shalt be called Zacharias, Luke 1. 76. the Prophet of the most High: for thou shalt goe before the face of the Lord, to prepare his wayes,
                     And to giue knowledge of Saluation vnto his people, by the Verse 77. remission of their sinnes:
                     Through the tender mercy of Verse 78. our God, whereby the day-spring from on high hath visited vs.
                     To giue light to them that sit in darknes, &amp; in the shaddow of Verse 79. death: and to guide our feet into the way of peace.
                     Behold, I will send you Eliah 
                        Malachy 4. 5. the Prophet, before the comming

of the great and fearefull Day of the Lord,
                     And he shall turne the heart of Verse 6. the Fathers to the Children, and the heart of the children to their fathers: lest I come and smite the earth with cursing.
                     And if ye will receiue it, Iohn 
                        Math. 11. 14. is that Elias (saith Christ) which was to come.
                  
                  
                     2. His owne comming or Birth.
                     THere shall come a Starre of Balaam, Numb. 24. 1

                     O Zion, that bringest good tidings,

                            41 9. get thee vp into the high Mountaines: O Ierusalem, that bringest good tidings, lift vp thy voice with strength, lift it vp, be not afraid; Say to the Cities

of Iudah, Behold your GOD.
                     
                     Behold, the Lord God will Verse 10. come with power, and his arme shall rule for him: Behold, his reward is with him, and his worke is before him.
                     Therefore thus saith the Lord Chap. 28. 16. God; Behold, I will lay in Sion a Stone, a tryed Stone, a precious Corner Stone, a sure foundation, he that beleeueth, shall not make haste.
                     For vnto Vs a Child is Borne, and vnto Vs a Sonne is Giuen, Chap. 9. 6. and the gouernment is vpon his shoulder: and hee shall call his Name Wonderfull, Counsellor, the Mighty God, the Euerlasting Father, the Prince of Peace, the increase of his gouernment and peace shall haue no end.
                     I will giue vnto Ierusalem one Chap. 41. 27. that shall bring good tidings vnto it.
                     
                        
And their noble Ruler shall be Ierem. 30. 21. of themselues, and their Gouernour shal proceed from the midst of them: and I will cause him to draw neere &amp; approch vnto mee. For who is this that directeth his heart to come vnto me (saith the Lord?)
                     In those dayes, and at that time, Chap. 33. 15. will I cause the Branch of Righteousnes to grow vp vnto Dauid: and he shall execute Iudgement and Righteousnes in the Land.
                     Behold I will bring forth the Zech. 3. 8. Branch my Seruant.
                     For loe, the Stone that I haue Verse 9. laid before Iehoshua, vpon that one Stone there shall bee seuen eyes: Behold, I will cut out the grauing thereof, saith the Lord of Hosts: and I will take away the iniquitie of the Land in one day.
                     In that day there shall bee a Chap. 13.

of Dauid, and to the Inhabitants of Ierusalem, for sinne and for vncleannesse.
                     And the Lord whom ye seeke, Malac. 3. 1. shall speedily come to his Temple; euen the Messenger of the Couenant whom ye desire: Behold, he shall come, saith the Lord of Hosts.
                     But who may abide the day of Verse 2. his comming? and who shall endure when he appeareth? For he is like a purging fire, and like Fullers Sope.
                     And hee shall sit downe to try Verse 3. and fine the siluer: hee shall euen fine the sonnes of Leui, and purifie them as gold and siluer, that they may bring offrings vnto the Lord in righteousnesse.
                     And the Redeemer shall come Isaiah 59. 20. vnto Zion; and vnto them that turne from Iniquitie in Iacob, saith the Lord.

                     THe Scepter shall not depart Iacob, Gen. 49. 10. from Iudah, nor a Law-giuer from betweene his feete, vntill Shiloh come: and the people shall be gathered vnto him.

He trusted in the Lord, let him Verse 8. deliuer him: let him saue him, seeing he loueth him.
                     I became also a rebuke vnto Psal. 109. 25. them: they that looked vpon me, shaked their heads.
                     I was a derision to all my people, Lam. 3. 14. and their song all the day.

For these things I weepe, mine Lam. 1. 16. eye, euen mine eye casts out water: because the Comforter that should refresh my soule is farre from mee: and my children are desolate, because the enemy hath preuailed.

                     HE was oppressed, and hee Isaiah 53. 7. was afflicted, yet did he not open his mouth: Hee is brought

as a Sheepe to the slaughter, and as a Sheepe before her shearer is dumbe, so hee opened not his mouth.
                     Thus am I, as a man that heares Psal. 38. 13, 14. not: and in whose mouth are no reproofes.
                     For on thee, O Lord, doe I wait: thou wilt heare mee, my Verse 15. Lord, my God.

                     BVt hee was wounded for our Isaiah 53. 5. transgressions, he was broken for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was vpon him, and with his stripes wee are healed.

                     Thou wilt shew mee the path of life: in thy presence is the fulnesse Verse 11. of ioy, and at thy right hand are pleasures for euermore.

                     He will destroy death for euer, Verse 8. and the Lord God will wipe away the teares from all faces, and the rebuke of his people will hee take away, out of all the earth: For the Lord hath spoken it.
                     And in that day shall men say, Uerse 9. Loe, this is our God, wee haue waited vpon him, and hee will saue vs: This is the Lord: we haue waited for him, we will reioyce, and bee ioyfull in his saluation.
                     
                        
I will redeeme them from the Hos. 13. 14. power of the graue: I will deliuer them from death: O death, I will be thy death: O graue, I will bee thy destruction: repentance is hid vp from my eyes.

                     Thus saith the Lord God, Behold, Verse 22. I will lift vp my hand to the Gentiles, and set vp my Standard to the people: and they shal bring thy sonnes in their armes: and thy daughters shall bee carried vpon their shoulders.
                     And Kings shall be thy nursing Fathers, and Queenes shall be thy Verse 23. nurses: and they shall worship thee with their faces towards the earth, &amp;c.
                     Therefore thy gates shall bee Chap. 60. 11. open continually, neither day nor night shall they be shut, that

men may bring vnto thee the riches of the Gentiles, and that their Kings may be brought.
                     Behold, thou shalt call a Nation Chap. 55. 5. that thou knowest not, and a Nation that knew not thee, shall run vnto thee, because of the Lord thy God, and the Holy One of Israel, for he hath glorified thee.
                     I haue beene sought of them that asked not: I was found of Chap. 65. 1. them that sought mee not: I said, Behold me, behold me, vnto a Nation that called not vpon my Name.
                     And the Kingdome, and the Dan. 7. 27. dominion of the greatnesse of the Kingdome vnder the whole Heauen, shall bee giuen to the holy people of the most High, whose Kingdome is an euerlasting Kingdome, and all Powers shall serue and obey him.
                     And in the place where it was Hosea 1. 10.
                        
said vnto them, Yee are not my people, it shall be said vnto them, Yee are the sonnes of the liuing God.
                     But in the last dayes it shall Micah 4. 1. come to passe, that the mountaine of the House of the Lord shall be See Mal. 1. 10. prepared in the top of the Mountaines, and it shall bee exalted aboue the Hils, and people shall flowe vnto it:
                     Yea many Nations shall come, Verse 2. and say; Come, and let vs goe vp to the Mountaine of the Lord, and to the house of the God of Iacob, and hee will teach vs his wayes, and wee will walke in his paths: for the Law shall goe forth of Zion, and the Word of the Lord from Ierusalem, &amp;c.
                     Thus saith the Lord of Hosts, Zech. 8. 20. that there shall yet come people, and the inhabitants of great Cities.
                     
                        
And they that dwell in one Citie, Verse 21. shall goe to another, saying, Vp, let vs goe and pray before the Lord, and seek the Lord of Hosts: I will goe also.
                     Yea great People and mighty Verse 22. Chap. 9. 10. Nations shall come to seeke the Lord of Hosts in Ierusalem, and to pray before the Lord, &amp;c.
                     And the Lord shal be King ouer Chap. 14. 9. all the earth: in that day shal there be one Lord, and his Name shall be one.
                     And in these dayes of these Dan. 2. 44. Kings, shall the God of heauen set vp a Kingdome, which shall neuer be destroyed: and this Kingdome shall not be giuen to another people, but it shall breake and destroy all these Kingdomes, and it shall stand for euer.
                     Thy Throne, O God, is for euer Psal 45. 6. and euer: the Scepter of thy Kingdome is a scepter of righteousnes.
                  
                  
                     
                     50. The conuersion of the Iewes, and what shall precede the same.
                     FOr the children of Israel shall Hosea 3. 4. remaine many dayes without a King, and without a Prince, and without an offering, and without an (Meaning an Oracle, deliuered betweene the Cherubims.) Image, &amp; without an Ephod, and without Teraphim.
                     Afterward shall the children of Israel conuert, and seeke the Lord their God, and Dauid their King, and shall feare the Lord and his goodnes in the latter dayes.
                     In those dayes, and at that time, Ierem. 50. 4. saith the Lord, the children of Israel shall come, they, and the children of Iudah together, going and weeping shall they goe, and seeke the Lord their God.
                     They shall aske the way to Zion, with their faces thitherward, Verse. 5. saying, Come, and let vs cleaue

to the Lord in a perpetuall Couenant that shall not be forgotten.
                     Behold, I will bring them from Chap. 31. 8. the North countrey, and gather them frō the coasts of the world, with the blinde and the lame amongst them, with the Woman with child, and her that is deliuered also, a great company shall returne hither.
                     They shall come weeping, and Verse 
                              〈◊〉
                           . with mercy will I bring them againe: I will leade them by the Riuers of water in a straight way wherin they shal not stumble: for I am a Father to Israel, &amp; Ephraim is my first-borne.
                     And I wil powre vpon the house Zech. 12. 10. of Dauid, and vpon the inhabitants of Ierusalem, the Spirit of grace and of compassion; and they shall looke vpon mee whom they haue pearced, and they shall lament for him, as one mourneth for his only

sonne, and be sorry for him, as one is sorry for his first-borne.
                     In that day shal be a great mourning Verse 11. in Ierusalem, as the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the Valley of Megiddon.
                     
                     Then shall the children of Iudah, 
                        Hos. 1. 11. and the children of Israel be gathered together, and appoint themselues one Head, and they shall come vp out of the Land: for great is the day of Israel.
                     
                     At the same day (saith the Lord) Micah 4. 6, 7. will I gather her that halteth, and I will gather her that is cast out, and her that I haue afflicted, &amp;c.
                  
                  
                     51. The free and plentifull offer of grace to both Iew and Gentile.
                     IN that day there shal be a fountaine Zech. 13. 1. opened to the house of Dauid, and to the inhabitants of Ierusalem, for sinne, and for vncleannesse.
                     
                        
And in that day, shal there waters Chap. 14. 8. of Life goe out from Ierusalem, halfe of them towards the East Sea, and halfe of them towards the vttermost Sea: and shall bee both in Summer and Winter.
                     Ho, euery one that thirsteth, Isaiah 55. 1. come ye to the waters, and ye that haue no siluer: come, buy &amp; eate, come, I say, buy Wine and Milke without siluer, &amp; without money.
                     Encline your eares, and come Verse 3. vnto mee: heare, and your soule shall liue, and I will make an euerlasting Couenant with you, euen the sure mercies of Dauid.
                     
                  
                  
                     52. The happy estate of the Church vnder Christ Iesus in the latter time.
                     BVt in the last daies it shal come Micah. 4. 1. to passe, that the Mountaine of the house of the Lord shall be prepared in the top of the Mountaines,

and it shal be exalted aboue the Hilles, and people shall flowe vnto it.
                     Yea, many Nations shall come, and say; Come, and let vs goe vp Verse 2. to the Mountain of the Lord, and to the house of the God of Iacob, and he will teach vs his wayes, and we will walk in his paths: for the Law shall go forth of Zion, &amp; the Word of the Lord from Ierusalem.
                     
                     And he shall iudge among many people, and rebuke mighty Nations Verse 3. afarre off, &amp; they shal breake their swords into Mattocks, and their Speares into Sithes: Nation shall not lift vp a sword against Nation, neither shall they learne to fight any more.
                     But they shall sit euery man vnder Verse 4. his Vine, and vnder his Figgetree, and none shall make them afraid: for the mouth of the Lord of Hosts hath spoken it.
                     
                        
At the same day (saith the Lord) Verse 6. will I gather her that halteth, and I will gather her that is cast out, and her that I haue afflicted.
                     And I will make her that halted Verse 
                              〈◊〉
                           . a remnant; and her that was cast farre off, a mighty Nation; and the Lord shall reigne ouer them in Mount Zion, from henceforth, euen for euer.
                     And I will reioyce in Ierusalem, 
                        Isaiah 65. 19. and ioy in my people, &amp; the voice of weeping shal be no more heard in her, nor the voice of crying.
                     There shall be no more there a Verse 20. child of yeeres, nor an old man that hath not filled his dayes; for he that shal be an hundreth yeeres old, shall
                           •…
                        dye as a yong man: but the sinner beeing an hundreth yeeres old, shall be accursed.
                     And they shall build houses, and Verse 21. inhabite them, and plant Vineyards, and eate the fruit of them.
                     
                        
They shall not labour in vaine, Verse 25. nor bring forth in feare: for they are the Seed of the blessed of the Lord, and their buds with them.
                     Yea before they call, I will answere; Verse 24. and whiles they speake, I will heare.
                     The Wolfe and the Lamb shall Verse 25. feed together, and the Lyon shall eate straw like the Bullock: and to the Serpent dust shall be his meat. They shall no more hurt nor destroy in all my holy Mountaine.
                     Looke vpon Zion, the Citie of Chap. 33. 20. our solemne Feasts: thine eyes shall see Ierusalem a quiet habitation, a Tabernacle that cannot be remooued, and the stakes thereof can neuer be taken away, neither shall any of the cords thereof bee broken.
                     For there the mighty Lord will Verse 21. bee vnto vs, as a place of Flouds and broad Riuers: whereby shall

passe no Ship with Oares, neither shall a great Ship passe thereby.
                     For the Lord is our iudge, the Verse 22. Lord is our Lawgiuer, the Lord is our King, he will saue vs.
                     Behold, a King shall reigne in Chap. 32. 1. Iustice, and the Princes shall rule in Iudgement.
                     And that man shall bee as a hiding place from the winde, and as Verse 2. a refuge for the tempest: as Riuers of water in a dry place, and as the shaddow of a great Rocke in a weary Land.
                     The eyes of the seeing shall not Verse 3. be shut; and the eares of them that heare, shall hearken.
                     And the heart of the foolish shal Verse 4. vnderstand knowledge, and the tongue of the stutters shall be readie to speake distinctly.
                     A niggard shall bee no more Verse 5. called liberall, nor the churle rich.
                     And iudgement shall dwell in Verse 16,
                        
the Desart, &amp; iustice shal remaine in the fruitfull field.
                     And the worke of iustice shall be peace, euen the worke of iustice Verse 17. and quietnesse, and assurance for euer.
                     And my people shall dwell in the tabernacle of peace, &amp; in sure Verse 18. dwellings, and in safe resting places, &amp;c.
                     Hee shall come downe like the raine vpon the mowne grasse: and Psal. 72. 6. as the showres that water the earth.
                     In his dayes shall the righteous flourish: and aboundance of peace Verse 7. shall be so long as the Moone endureth.
                     His dominion also shal be from Verse 8. Sea to Sea, and from the Riuer, to the ends of the Land.
                     Yea, all Kings shal worship him: Verse 11. and all Nations shall serue him.
                     Hee shall bee mercifull to the Verse 13.
                        
poore and needy, and shall preserue the soules of the poore.
                     Hee shall redeeme their soules Verse 14. from deceit and violence: and deare shall their bloud be in his sight.
                     His name shall bee for euer: his Verse 17. name shall endure as long as the Sunne: all Nations shall blesse him, and be blessed in him.
                  
                  
                     53. His second comming to Iudgement, and the Resurrection of all flesh to appeare before him.
                     FOr I am sure that my Redeemer Iob 19. 25. liueth, and hee shall stand the last on the earth:
                     And though after my skinne, Verse 26. wormes destroy this body, yet shal I see God in my flesh.
                     Whom I my selfe shall see, and Verse 27. mine eyes shall behold, and none other for mee, though my reynes be consumed within me.
                     
                        
Our God shall come, and not keepe silence: a fire shall deuoure Psal. 50. 3. before him, and a mighty tempest shall be moued round about him.
                     Hee shall call the heauen aboue, Verse 4. and the earth, to iudge his people.
                     Gather my Saints together vnto Verse 5. me: those that make a Couenant with me, with sacrifice.
                     And the heauens shall declare his righteousnesse; for God is Verse 6. Iudge himselfe. Selah.
                     And at that time shall Michael stand vp, the great Prince, which Dan. 12. 1. standeth for the children of thy people, and there shall bee a time of trouble, such as neuer was since there beganne to be a Nation, vnto that same time: and at that time thy people shall be deliuered, euery one that shall be found written in the Booke.
                     And many of them that sleepe in the dust of the earth, shall awake; Verse

and as a Bride tireth her selfe with her Iewels.
                           In all our troubles he was troubled, and the Angell of his presence hath saued vs: in his loue and in his mercy hee hath redeemed vs, and he beares and carries vs alwayes continually.
