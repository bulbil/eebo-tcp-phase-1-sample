            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

The which hath ſo depraved &amp; poyſoned many their hartes, that it hath not only removed from them, all loyalty to their prince, &amp; loue to their countrie; but alſo hath carried thē ſo far, againſt the ſtreame of al goodnes, and ſence of nature; that they haue by ſundrie meanes, and ſundry perſons, attempted to doe violence, vpon her ſacred maieſty; and farther haue ſought, ſo far as in them laye, to moue rebellions in the lande, and with

Whoſe wicked malice, although god of his goodnes hath hitherto detected and blowne abroad, to their own ſhame &amp; and great confuſion: yet there cauſe, hath been of late more ſpecially commended, &amp; vndertaken by the greate pation of the holy league, who vnder a ſhew and couler of religion, and of yeelding ſuccours vnto there cauſe, doth affect the ſoverainty and Empire not only of thē, &amp; of this our countrie, but of al other kingdomes here in the weſt. Wherefore it ſtandeth all good people vpon, which loue their liberty, &amp; would not that a ſtranger ſhould reape that they haue ſowen to giue eare vnto the calles of their ſuperiors, by whoſe providence (vnder god they haue bin hitherto kept, and ſtil may be continued in wealth &amp; liberty.

For ſince this if you conſider is the ſcope of all their counſels, to take from vs not onely our well being, but our being, even church and kingdome, and to bring all into a miſerable thral dome both of body and ſoule:Aeſops dog let vs beware leaſt while we gape after the ſhadow we leſe not the ſubſtance &amp; the ſhadow to: leaſt whilſt we would raiſe a tower to mount vp to heaven, we ſet not vp a Babel the confuſion of al.Gen. 11.

But to adviſe our overheddy and haſty ſpirites, ether for a while to rebate the edge of their il tempered fury, or els to turn their

In regarde therefore of this moſt cruell enemy, loue of gods church, and tender of this our natiue country, I haue choſen this ſcripture as the fitteſt for me to ſpeake of, and you to heare; God graunt that we may al follow it, as may be to his glory and our countries good.
            
               The text is taken out of the firſt booke of Samuel, the eleventh Chapter, beginning at the fift verſe.
               
                  1. Sa. 11.5.
                  And Saul ſaide, What aileth this people that they weep? and they ſhewed vnto him the wordes of the men of Iabeſh: then the ſpirit of the lord came on Saul whē he hard thoſe words, and he was exceeding angry, &amp; he tooke a yoke of oxen, &amp; cut them in peeces, &amp; ſent them into al the coaſts of Iſrael, by the handes of meſſengers, ſaying▪ Whoſoeuer commeth not after Saul and a

Samuel, ſo ſhal his oxen be ſerved: and the feare of the Lord came vpon the people, and they came forth as one man.
               
            
            IN the opening of which text we are to cō
               ſider, firſt the occaſion why the people we peth and Saul is angry, and both king and people wt ſo great an army ſo ſpeedily come foorth: ſecondly this, that the people weep: thirdly the demaund of Saule, what aileth the people that they weep? fourthly Saules anger, and he was exceeding angry: fifthly his ſummons, in which firſt his fact, he took a yoke of oxen, cut them in peeces, ſent them into al the coaſtes of Iſrael: then his proclamation, whoſoever cōmeth not after Saul &amp; after Samuel, ſo ſhal his oxen be ſerved: Sixtly the readines of the people, they came out as one man: Laſtly what is the reaſon that Saul was thus angry &amp; the people came; the ſpirite of the Lorde came on Saul, and the feare of the Lord came vpon the people.
            
            In the occaſion, you are to conſider the city that is beſieged, the party that beſiegeth, &amp; that when, and vppon what title.
            Concerning the city beſieged,The city beſieged. it is Iabeſh Gilead, a city in mount Gilead, appertaining to ye halfe tribe of Manaſſeth, whoſe portion was ſorted wt the Reuvenites &amp; Gadites be

recovered frō Og the King of Baſhan, &amp; Sihon king of Amorites. As it is at large deſcribed Deut. 3. And although the tribes of 
               Deu. 3.12.
               Reuben &amp; Gad had halfe the moūt of Gilead given thē to inherit,Num. 32.33.yet the reſt of Gilead, was givē by Moſes to the half tribe of Manaſſeh: And after the conqueſt of Canaan Ioſ. 13.31.
               confirmed vnto them by Ioſuah. This city as it was 2 Sam. 2.5
               commended by Dauid, becauſe they 1. Sam. 31 11.
               recouered the bodies of Saul &amp; Ionathan from the walles of Beth-ſchon of the Philiſtines where they hanged: ſo was it wholy ſacked by the power of Iſrael,
               Iud. 21.10. bicaus they came not with there brethren, but ſtood as neutrales, when they went to do iuſtice on the men of Gibeah for that villanous &amp; barbarous fact ſhewed on the Levits wife. Thus much for the city that is beſeeged.
            Nowe concerning the Ammonites that did beſeege, they coaſted on the eaſt of mount Galead, and were nere borderers vnto that part of the tribe of Manaſſeh and vnto the tribe of Gad. For in conquering of the lande of Sihon king of the Amorits,Nu. 21.24. they are ſaied to conquer euen to the river Iabok, which is on the border of the childrē of Ammō, &amp; this city as other about the riuer Arnon,

               &amp; mount Galead, Sihon king of the Ammorites took from the children of Moab, before that Iſrael came out of AEgypt.
            
               Now then as it is ſtoried in the verſes &amp; chapters before,The time when and vpon what title. whē that Naaſh by his intelligence hard, that the people of Iſrael were at variāce in themſelves, 1. Sam. 8.5.6. 
               that they refuſed Samuel to be their governour, aſked for a king,
               1. Sam. 10 27.
               &amp; yet would none of him, whom the lord by Samuel anointed for to be their ſoveraigne: vpon an auncient butIud. 11.19 23 27. Iud. 10.8.

               Iud. 11.13. 
               when they came out of AEgypt even from Arnon vnto Iabok &amp; Iordan (he laieth ſeege to Iabeſh Gilead:1. Sa. 11.1. &amp;c. and although the city would haue bin his tributary yet not content with this, to ſhew his malice &amp; ſpite he had to the houſe of Iſrael, he would heare of no entreatyes or cōditions of peace, except they bord out their right eies, to there own ſhame &amp; reproch of al their natiō, the which condition although moſt ignominious in it ſelf, and more to be ſhunned then a thouſand deathes, yet ſuch was the baſenes and vilenes of this ſlaviſh &amp; degenerate people, that they yeelded vnto this proud and inſolent demaunde, if within ſeven daies they were not ſuccored: the report wherof when it was bruted in the eares of the people they wept, but

Saul burned with anger and gathered his forces for to giue releefe. Thus then you ſee who is beſeeged, Iabeſh Gilead: who beſeegeth, Nahaſh king of Ammon: and vppon what pretence, an auncient title, and that he will admitte no manner of ſubmiſſion, except withall hee haue their right eies. Nowe lette vs compare this ſtory to the preſent time.
            Not Nahaſh of Ammō, but the great monarch of the weſt, whoſe treaſures are fedde with the golde of Indy,The application of the ſtory. and deſires with the conqueſt of the worlde, whoſe navie as a foreſt hath ſhadowed oure ſeas, and the roaring of whoſe canonnes made the ſeas to rore, and the ſon in his glory for to leeſe his light: having of late eſpied the diſſentions  of Iſraell, variaunce of Fraunce, and howe manie of them refuſed Saul, the Lordes annointed and naturall ſoveraigne, to bee theire governoure: vppon a title to the Dukedomme of Brittaine, as vnto  what Realme woulde hee not make title? hath entered with his forces not  onely into Brittaine, but into Languidocke, Province, Dalphine, Champaigne,  Paris, the very heade citty and chamber of Fraunce, and not contented with many cityes which he hath ſurpriſed, doth farther vnto all men by his newe ſupplies

and preparations ſhewe the foorh of his deſire, which is to haue the conqueſt of  all. And herein more cruell then was Naaſh of Ammon, he will not take to mercy them that ſeeke for his mercy, excepte, to the reproche of their nation and everduring ſhame, they will plucke out not onelie their right eye, the light of the Goſpell, and bring in the all blinding darkeneſſe of Popery againe: but their leaft eye alſo, a ſonne of Fraunce, and naturall borne ſoveraigne: excepte they will refuſe the oliue to bee their King, and will ſay to the flower, thou ſhalt not reigne over vs. Oh daughter of Fraunce much to bee wailed, that thy goodly light ſhoulde bee turned into darkeneſſe, thy liberty into ſlavery, kingdome into tyranny, and thy faint light of Gods truth, which yet in thee but glimereth, into the palpable darknes of error againe. Thus much for the application of the ſtory: lette vs conſider what the people did.
            When the children of Iſraell hearde, that Ammon woulde ſhewe noe mercy to the menne of Iabeſh, except they woulde bore out their right eies,The peowept, and why. to their owne ſhame, and reproche of all Iſraell: they lift vppe their voice and wept. A loving

&amp; moſt kind people. But why do they weep?  do they weepe becauſe the men of Iabeſh offended God, in forſaking there ſovereigne which was of there brethrē, and in yeelding their necks vnto a forraine yoke. A fact to be wailed of the multitude, &amp; ſcorned of ſuch as cary generous minds, for they ſhoulde rather haue choſen to haue dyed with honour, then with outbored eies to liue in ſlavery and perpetual  ſhame. Or why do they weepe? do they weepe becauſe the ſtaffe of Ammon which hath beaten Iabeſh doth threaten them, becauſe the waters of trouble that haue overflowen there brethren, do now even rore &amp; beat on there bankes, and there is no counſell for to keepe them out: no marvaile if the fear of there future and haſting harmes, doth make them to water there plants, and to weep for themſelves and for there children, becauſe of the miſery that was ſhortly to enſue. Or why  do they weepe? do they weep as they that are tender harted kinde &amp; lovely, whoſe bowels are moued and turned within, over the miſeries of there brethren as though they were there own. O worthy Iſraelits &amp; preſident moſt memorable, which doth ſhew to al ſucceeding ages, not happily what they are, but what without al peradventure they ſhoulde be: for can one member be ſtrooke and the other not feele, nay it feeleth greveth and ſuccoreth

what it can. When Mardochai heard that Hamon had procured, that by the commaunde of the king at a day appointed, all the Iews through al his provinces ſhould be put to death, he rent his clothes,
               Heſt. 4.1. 
               put on ſac kloth, went into the mideſt of the city, and cried with a great cry &amp; a bitter. When the friends of Iobe that came to comforte him, ſaw him clothed with ſo great calamity, they lift vp their voices &amp; wept,
               Iob. 2.12. 
               rent their garments and ſprinkled duſt vpō their heades. In like ſort when Hazael was ſent from Benadab to know of Eliſha whether Benadab ſhould recover. Eliſha wept &amp; Hazael ſaide why weepeth my lord?

               and he anſwered even for the evill that I know, thou ſhalt doe to the children of Iſrael. For there ſtrong cities ſhalt thou ſet on fier, there young men ſhalt thou ſlay with the ſword, thou ſhalt daſh there infants againſt the ſtones and rent in peeces there women with child: with the like affection Ieremy foreſeeing the captivity of his people, although hee knewe that his life ſhuld be givē him for a pray,Ierem. 9.1 
               yet he wiſheth that his head were a wel of water &amp; his eis a foūtain of tears, that he might weep day &amp; night for the ſlain of the daughter of his people. Now whether this even to approue this weeping of the people heere, and to commend this Chriſtian kind and brotherly affection

in you, ſo often as brethren of the ſame hope, members of the ſame bodye, fellowe partners of the ſame quarell and the ſame ſucceſſe, doe labour in their trouble, and are in ſome diſtreſſe. For as this hath beene a continued practiſe of all nations, at all times to ſet vppe the enſignes of ioye, for the good ſucceſſe of their well meaning and confedered friendes: ſoe hath it beene the like cuſtome vppon anye harde eventes, to ſhewe tokens of ſorrowe, mourning, and of much complainte. In trueth whereof, ſaye they bee French, and not naturall Engliſh, ſaye they bee netherlanders, and not your brethren, yet the troubler of Englande is the troubler of them; yet for the ſame fayth, and in the ſame quarell, and againſt the ſame enemye, which meaneth noe better to you then hee dooeth to them, nay much worſe: in that he hath beene not abroade, but at his owne doers, and that not once but often heated, fired, and inflamed by you. Wherefore if your ſtonie hartes can not be mooued over their miſeryes, althoughe they are your brethren, yet weepe for your ſelues, and for your children, and for the evils which maye come vpon you: for if that moſt large &amp; mighty kingdome, ſhall not withſtande his furye, nor the force of them that are confedered with

him: what ſhall become of this our nation, when hee ſhall againe come, not with a navie from Spaine as hee did beefore, but from the nigher havens of Fraunce and Flaunders: nor with his owne power onelye as before, but backed and ſtrengthened with the gentrie of Fraunce?Livy decad. 3. li. 1.

               The demaund of Saul what aileth the people that they weepe?Thus much concerning this that the people wept, nowe let vs conſider the demande of Saul what aileth the people that they weepe? Saul was there king they were his people, this is his motion what aileth the people that they weep? In whome we may ſee, what louely care and tender affection, princes and maieſtrates and other gouernours ſhould cary towards the people commended to there charge: for whereas they are the fathers of their country, they ſhoulde haue the bowelles of fathers, and they ſhould no more abide the cry or teares of their people, then doth the tender mother the ſcreeches of her babe, or the naturall father the gronings of his pained child.Iſa. 49.23. 
               For they are nurcing fathers, nurcing mothers, annoynted by the Lord not for their owne, but for the peoples good; they therefore ſhoulde learne to make enquire with Saul what aileth the people, that they weepe? and to pray with Salomon when they are made rulers over gods inheritaunce,

not for honour for it ſhall followe them, nor for riches for God ſhal bleſſe them, but for wiſedome and knowledge that they may go in and out before the people.1. Cro. 1.10 
               Thou haſt made me king ouer a gret people, giue me now wiſdom &amp; knowledge that I may go out &amp; in before this people.

               2. Sam. 24.17. 
               but as for theſe ſheep what euil haue they done, for as it was ſaid by Mardochai to Heſter, which for a while withdrew her help frō her diſtreſſed people.Heſt. 4.14. 
               Who knoweth whether thou was aduanced to the kingdome for ſuch an end: ſo may it be ſpoken to the rulers and governoures of al eſtates, in whoſe power it is to wipe away the teares of the people, and to ſtil their cries, not with who knoweth, but that thou was advanced to thy gouernment for ſuch an end. do not ſay for excuſe, it is a work of envy and of trouble, liked of none but the diſtreſſed ſort, but go through in the power of god whoſe iudgement you execute, and if thou be an inferiour magiſtrate prefer their plaints to thy ſuperiour, and ſay with Heſter to Aſſuerns. How can I ſuffer

and ſee the evil that is come vnto my people?Heſt. 8.6. how can I ſuffer and ſee the trouble of my kindred? yea although thou maiſt make thy profit wt the peoples hurt: yet defy that profit, that is gotten with their teares, &amp; gain that is accompanied with their curſe. And although with David thou long to drinck the water of the wel of Bethel, to encreaſe in wealth, and leaue a kingdome to thy poſterity: yet when thou ſhalt conſider that this water is gotten by the ieopardy of mens liues, thy riches by the ſpoile of the needy, oppreſſion of thy brethren,2. Sam. 24.16. 
               powre it forth, &amp; do not drinke: but ſay with that kingly Prophet, be it far from me that I ſhould drinck the price of bloud. And let that be the croune and fulnes of your glory, wherein dying Pericles did moſt of all reioice:Plu. vita Periclis. 
               I haue not clothed my ſelfe with the teares of the people there is none for me hath woorne a mourning weede. This if thou refuſe, how canſt thou here with Saul iuſtly ſaie? what aileth the people that they weep? when it is thou that for thy gaine, doſt wreſt teares frō their eies, ſighes from their harts, and forceſt them in the bitternes of their ſoule, to curſe thee, and wiſh that thou wert dead. And if al this can not moue, yet come and learne yee Chriſtians of a heathen, ye captaines of a captaine, ye rulers of a ruler of the people, worthy

               Camillus captain of the Romaines, who when hee ſawe the citty of the Veians which he had ſurpriſed flaming with fier, wept over the city, and lifting his handes vp to heaven ſaide, If it be thy pleaſure, ô god,
               Livy decad. 1. li. 5. 
               bleſſe our affaires, but if thou purpoſe euil to the city of Rome, and to our nation, ô ſpare them, and let al their evils ende in my ſelfe. Even ſo and with ſuch affection ſhould our princes and rulers ſpeake, O lord if it be thy pleaſure bleſſe our affaires, but if thou purpoſe evill to this city and to our nation, O ſpare them, and lette all their evilles ende in our ſelues.
            But alaſſe, be it ſpokē with their patience, and in all reverence vnto ſo greate eſtates, it is not thus with the rulers of our age, they doe not ſaie What aileth the people that they weepe? neither doe they ſeeke to yeelde comforte to their heavy harts, but like hard harted nurces, they ſuffer them to crie till they be weary. And when they cry huſh huſh, &amp; would haue them ſtill, yet then with their ſtripes doe they occaſion newe teares. And although they bee not ſo evill as was Caligula, to wiſh one head to the people,
               Suet. vita Caligulae ſect. 30. Idem vit Nero. ſect 38. 
               that at one ſtroke he might cutte it of: nor ſoe vaine as was Nero to ſeeke their ſportes in the firing of Rome, their pleaſures in the ſpoile of the countrie, yet they canne

not ſay with Samuell a ruler of Iſraell. Whoſe ox haue I takē?
               1 Sam. 12.3 
               Or whoſe aſſe haue I taken or whome haue I done wrong to? or whome haue I hurt? or of whoſe handes haue I receaued bribe? And I wil reſtore it vnto him againe: leſt happily the people ſhew their wronges and their hurtes, call for there oxen and there aſſes, their ſundry giftes, and there be no power in the maieſtrate to reſtore. When the people of Iſraell had made vnto themſelues a golden calfe, &amp; turned the glory of god into the Image of a beaſt that eateth hay, the Lord ſaid vnto Moſes,Exod. 32.10. 
               let me alone, this is a ſtifnecked people I will conſume them at once, &amp; I wil make of thee a mighty natiō: but Moſes ſaid pardō their ſin,
               Verſ. 32. 
               or if thou wilt not, blot me out of the book which thou haſt writtē. Now if for the ſin of the people, god ſhould threaten to root out the memory of a nation from vnder heauē, would not many rulers be glad of this? ſo that of there bowels god would raiſe a mighty nation, would they refuſe gods offer, as Moſes doth here? pray for the people and wiſh to be raiſed out of the book of life, if god ſhould not pardon the treſpaſſe of the people? and yet the rulers ſhould be as Moſes, in preferring the good of the people before the good of their ſeede, their liues and ſafety ſhould be vile in their eies, in regarde

of the good and ſafety of the whole.
            For doubtles if the people weepe, &amp; there be noe Saul to pitty, but the rulers ſpeake vnto them as did Pharaoh to the Iewes, at what time they moued and complained their greefes: Ye are to idle, go and worke,
               Exod. 5.17 
               there ſhal be no ſtraw givē you, yet you ſhal deliver the whole tale of brick.
               Heſt. 4.14. As Mardochay ſaid to Eſther, God may otherwiſe ſēd comfort &amp; deliveraunce vnto his people,
               Exod. 12. like as here he did vnto theſe Iewes, and this over rough and cruell dealing, may be ſometime in cauſe of the peoples revolt. for not to ſpeak of the preſedēts of others, either lately in our neighboure coūtries ſhewen, or ſtoried in the bookes of ancient recorde: if Rehoboā
                had mildly anſwered the people after the coūſell of the auncient, they had continued his ſervantes forever: but when he followed the headines of the young,1. Reg. 12.14. 
               and threatned to make the grievos yoake of his father, more greevos, to whip thē with ſcourges whom his father chaſtiſed with roddes, &amp; al Iſrael ſaw they were not regarded; in a fury they brake away, and ſaide: What portion haue we in David?
               verſ. 16. 
               we haue no inheritaunce in the ſō of Iſhai, to your tentes O Iſrael. Now ſee to thine houſe O David. So they revolted from Rehoboam, and made Ieroboam their king. Now whether this, even by the

contrary to ſhewe, the happineſſe of this our Engliſh nation, which hath a Saul that harkeneth to their cries, which preventes often the occaſion of their teares, and is moſt deſirous at the firſt, notice to remooue the cauſe of all their ſorrowe. Wherefore long maie England haue part in her, and ſhe in them, as maie bee to the encreaſe, of her glorie, and farther welfare of this her realme.
            But yet, if her vnder rulers and governours,Some knowen cauſes why Englande weepeth. Nehe. 2.2. to whome theſe thinges ſhoulde bee better known, do aſke with Saul what aileth the people that they weep? or with Artaxerxes of Nehemiah, why is thy countenance ſad? and why art thou of an heavy cheare, ſeing thou art not ſick? ſure this is nothing but ſorrow of hart. We may anſwere with Nehemiah in that place, ô ye rulers liue for ever, why ſhould not our countenaunce be ſad? &amp; our heartes heavy? ſince we may not ſafelye ſpeake the abuſes, that wee knowe, or if wee doe yet wee ſhall not ſee them remedied. For if we may ſpeake of thinges knowen, and which are in every eye, let Saul look on the ſouldier maimed in his princes and countries quarrel, whoſe hurtes wil not ſuffer to labour, and need with much ſhame enforceth to begge. And why hath not England cauſe for to weepe? to ſee her ſons as

beggers diſgraced with ſhame, whoſe maimes deſerues to be graced with honour. Frō
                the ſoldier look to the cotager and poore huſbandmā, whoſe thirſt knoweth not the drink of mault, nor hunger the reliſh of fleſh or fiſh, whoſe racking landlordes haue rented their heartes, and needy hunger hath already forced to leaue there houſes, &amp; to come abroad. And why hath not Englande cauſe for to weepe? to ſee her teates full and her ſons ſtarving, a ſcarcity procured to the poorer ſorte, where ſhe hath given a plenty for all. From  theſe looke not to the lawe the ſinewes of a kingdome, nor on good lawyers the ſoule of the lawe, but on thoſe who thirſt after cauſes, although they be badde, which canne drawe ſutes in length as the wyer drawer doth his wier; and is never at an ende, till he hath made an ende of thine: which in the fiennes of his witte, but fouleneſſe of his conſcience, is not aſhamed to ſay, that he hath a ſhift of deſcant for every neede. And why hath not Englande cauſe for to weepe? to ſee wrong donne to her children which ſeeke for right, to ſee ſoe many abuſe the lawe and lawe loving people: and yet noe knowen note of diſgrace, inured and  imprinted on them. From theſe ſhall wee looke to our officers of both eſtates, which haue not bought by great as Lanow ſpeketh

of the offices and governments of Fraunce, and yee as faſt as they do ſel by retaile, which vſe them to their gaine, I woulde we might alſo ſay to the peoples good, which ſpeake to the law, be ſilent, and it dares not ſpeake; ſpeake after this faſhion, and it ſpeaketh againſt her owne meaning, evē what they wil. And why hath not Englande cauſe for to weepe? To ſee them to giue her occaſion to mourne, which ſhoulde procure her matter  of mirth. From theſe may we come vnto our church (I ſpeake but of thoſe thinges which every man doth ſee) if wee looke on the prophannes of ſome, over nicenes of others: if on the rabble of vnlearned which can not ſpeak, and hard hartednes of others, which wil not feed nor ſee the flock cōmitted to their charge; or if on them which winck and ſay al is wel, &amp; are loath to heare that any thing is amiſſe: or on the headines of others &amp; vnbridled raſhnes, which think there is no mending, without downe plucking: no church but of their making, and caſt in their moulde. Wel may England weepe, to ſee her lightes chaunged into darknes, and them to ſpeake teares and  trouble vnto Sion, which ſhould ſpeak peace and to her ioie. From al theſe if we looke vnto the dealings of this city, and behold the exceſſiue gaine, which without all who and conſcience, they make in their trades: or the

vnnatural dealing of ſome overgredy, which engroſſe commodities into their handes, that ſo they might raiſe the price, or keep thē at a ſtay: or on the not multiplying duly, but biting vſurer, which gnaweth and teareth out his gaine, out of the lands and liuely-hoodes not onely of the commonalty, but gentry, yea nobility of this land: or in a word on the variable and moſt kinde deceites, which with great ſkil and little conſcience are practiſed in every trade, in every miſtery. Great cauſe hath England for to weep, &amp; to ſpeake vnto Saul, the rulers and governours of her lande, which aſk, what aileth the people that they weep? Even for the ſouldier that is deſpiſed, and the poore and needy that is not regarded for the abuſes of the lawier, diſorders of the church, corruption of the rulers, vncenſcionable deceites which are of al ſortes vſed, ſtudied, and ſtil to be continued, it by Saul &amp; his rulers they be not remedied.
            Thus much for the demand of Saul,
               The anger of Saul for the iniuries offred vnto the people. 
               what aileth the people that they weepe? Nowe let vs conſider his affection. Vpon the report of the men of Iabeſh, he wept not as the people, but as one of a greater ſpirit, he was exceeding angry: and when they had ſhewed him the wordes of the men of Iabeſh, Saul was exceding angry. When theſe thinges were tolde the people they wept, for the

ſword was not committed to their hands, &amp; beeing but private not publike perſons, they ought not for to ſeeke revenge: but frō 
               Saul annointed to be their ſoveraigne, cāe flames of fier not floudes of teares, and whot burning and revenging anger, not fearefull heavines &amp; coldnes of hart; Teares and praiers for private perſons, but wrath and revenge for the rulers of the people, and the ſword to ſtrike, for him that hath the ſcepter and doth wear the crown. They weept but Saul was exceeding angry.
               Lactarius de ira dei c. 21. To be angry is naturall vnto fleſh and bloud, for with it we are borne and with it wee are bred, and from it if wee would we cannot be ſevered; for the moſt dul and heavy ſpirited, the moſt meeke and patient is ſometimes ſharpened, and for iniuries receaved haſtned for to ſeek revenge.1. Sa. 25.22 When Nabal anſwered churliſhly the ſervantes of David, that came for releefe, Davids wrath was kindled, and he ſware that he woulde not leaue in Naballes houſe by the dawning of the day, one to make water againſt a wal.

of Abel then he doth of Cains, the people rather phauſy the miniſtry of laboring preachers then vnſkilled loiterours,Nu. 11.29. 
               although Moiſes like it, yet there are Cains which are angry and doe ſeeke revenge. Inſomuch that if wee ſhoulde ſpeake to menne of this age, as God did to Caine,
               Gen. 4.6. 
               why art thou angry with thy brother, you ſhould ſee that ether it is for no cauſe, or if for a cauſe for no great, or if for a great thē not for a good. And if the miniſters ſhould yet go furder and ſay as the lord did vnto Ionah,
               Iohn. 4.9. 
               doſt thou wel to be angry for thy goord? They in the fury of their rage and vnbridled affection, wil ſtamp and ſay, we do wel to be angry evē vnto the death. It is true indeed that thou maieſt be angry when thou haſt cauſe,
               Lactū
                  
                     •
                  . de ira de c. 17 yet muſt thou not phanſy a cauſe where noe cauſe is, nor when thou haſt cauſe be moved aboue meane and meaſure. But as Saint Paul ſpeaketh concerning ſorrow for their friendes that are departed you muſt not ſo weep as they that haue no hope:1. Theſ. 4. evēſo you muſt not ſo be āgry as they that haue no hope. But as the ſame Apoſtle to the Epheſians ſpeaketh,Eph. 4.26. 
               be angry but ſin not. Thus it behooveth vs which are but private perſons, when wee are moved to choler &amp; deſire of revenge, to look that the cauſe be weighty and not a trifle, of ſome importance and not a goord, that it bee true

and not phanſied, iuſt and not ſuppoſed, and then that wee keepe our ſelues within mean and meaſure.
            But here is more in this enſample, in that Saul is a king, no private perſon: and is angry not for himſelfe or for his own wrōges, but for the iniury done to Iabeſh, and contumely intēded againſt his whole natiō: for as this was ſpokē to the praiſe of David,
               Pſ. 70.10. that the zeale of the lords houſe had even eatē him:2. Sam. 10.6. ſo was this alſo vnto his glory, that his zeale was kindled and anger inflamed, for the outrage of Ammondone to his legated, &amp; their armies, gathred for his peoples hurt. Wherefore although it be ſaid,Eph. 4.20. Lacian. epit. livi. inſt. cap. 3. 
               lette not the ſon go downe vpon your wrath: yet this is ſpoken, of vniuſt and private iniuries, not iuſt and publike: of others, not of kings and princes, which haue the charge and guidāce of publike weales.Eſter 9.12 13. For their wrath muſt not go out, nor anger be abated, til they haue wrought the deliveraunce of their people, &amp; haue taken vengeāce, on the enemies of their god.Ioſh. 10.12 So that as Ioſhua praied, ſon ſtay thou ſtil in Gibeon, and thou moone in the valley of Aialon, vntill the people▪ haue avenged thēſelues vppō their enemies: ſo ought we to pray, that his ſon of anger, would ſtand on our mountaines, &amp; this moone of revenge vpon our valleies: til they haue avenged thē
               ſelues

vpō their enemies, and brought deliverance vnto their people. For the ſon of anger muſt not only ſhine, but ſtay ſhining vpon our mountaines: &amp; they muſt not only be angry, but as Saul in this place, be exceeding angry. Whē Eliſha was ſick,2. Reg. 13. 
               Ioaſh the king of Iſrael cāe down vnto him, &amp; when he ſaw him ſicke vnto death, then he wept, criyng, O my father, my father, the horſmen of Iſrael and the chariots therof. And Eliſha bad him take a bow and arrowes: &amp; he tooke and ſhot, and after he ſaid againe to the king, take the arrowes and finite the ground: and he ſmote the ground thriſe, and ſo ceaſed.
               Verſ. 18.19. 
               Then the man of god was angry with him, and ſaide why doſt thou ceaſſe? Thou ſhouldeſt haue ſmitten fiue or ſixe times, ſo ſhouldeſt thou haue ſmitten Arā, til thou hadſt conſumed him: even ſo muſt we pray yt our Ioaſh would take the arrowes of deliveraunce into her handes, &amp; would ſmite the ground, that is, her enemies, not once or twiſe, but ſixe times: evē til ſhe hath ſmitten and conſumed them. For as a litle water ſprinkled on the coales, doth not quench the heat, or put out the fier, but makes it to burne with greater flame: ſoe ſmal ſuccours ſent for reliefe, and reſiſtance ſprinkled on their flaming mindes, doth not quench their rage and revenging fury, but maketh them to burne with greater flames,

and with greater force to ſeeke revenge. Wherefore it is to be wiſhed that our rulers be not only angry, but exceeding angry, as here is Saul. That they ſtrike the groūd not only three times but ſix times: that they not onely ſprinkle, but powre downe the water of reſiſtance vpon their fury, and that they never put of this worthy affection, till they haue avenged the people of their wronges, &amp; brought an happy peace, to the good of prince and people, and the farther glory of this their countrey.
            
               Saul heweth the oxen &amp; ſendeth the peces thorough IſraelThus much for the affection of Saul now followeth his ſummons, where firſt wee are to conſider what he did, ſecondly what hee ſpake: concerning the deed he tooke a yoak of oxen, for they were his owne, he hewed them in peeces, for he was angry, and hee ſent them through al the coaſtes of Iſraell, leaſt any ſhould ſay they did not know, with this proclamation, whoſoever cōmeth not foorth after Saul and after Samuel, ſo ſhall his oxen be ſerved. For he thought, that if the caſe of their brethren which were beſieged, nor their owne eſtate which ſtood nexte to daunger; yet the commaunde of himſelfe which was their ſoveraign, and the ſpoile of their cattaile ſampled in his owne: ſhoulde driue them from their houſes, and make thē with ſpeed to come and follow him. And becauſe

thinges ſpoken doe not ſo much affect as thinges that are ſeene, thinges reported as which moue the eies, not only this is barely denounced, but the oxen are hewen, the peeces are ſent, they ſee that done to others, which they heare, if they come not is threatned, ſhal be done to theirs. To the like effect when the Lord purpoſed to bring Iudah and the realmes adioyning, vnto the obedience of Nabuchadnazar king of Babel,
               Ier. 27.1. he cauſed Ieremy to make bandes &amp; yoakes, to wear them vpon his neck, and to ſend them to the princes neare adioyning. And when Hannaniah the Prophet broke the woodden yoake, which Ieremy wore about his necke, and propheſied deliveraunce vnto the people:Ier. 28.1

               the lord in ſteede of a woodden gaue him an iron yoake, which could not bee broken, therby to ſhew, that their captivity was moſt ſure. When the lord by Ezechiel did foretel the deſtructiō of the people, he cauſed Ezechiel to ſhaue his hair,

               &amp; to devide it into three parts, to burne one third in the midſt of the city, the other to cut &amp; hackle in peeces, &amp; the third to ſcatter in the wind. Thereby ſhewing that the one part ſhould be waſted wt hot &amp; fiery diſſeaſes, that other by ye ſword of the enimy, &amp; that the third ſhould be led into captiuity. Evē ſo the renting of Samuels garmēt did ſhew the rēting away of the kingdō,1. Sa. 15.28
               
frō the houſe of Saul. And Zidkaiah with hi

               would haue ſhewed that Ahab ſhoulde haue ſo puſhed the Syrians, til he had ſubdued &amp; conquered thē. Thus in the ſcriptures not onely the meſſage is barely delivered: but the better to imprint &amp; ſettle it in the hearers heartes, vnder viſible ſignes and ſhadowes, is ſometime repreſented vnto their eies, that which the eare doth heare, and they would haue to be beleeved of the heart.
            
               The prince ought to cōmaund the people to follow, &amp; to puniſh thē which do refuſe.Thus much for the ſigne in the ſummons: now let vs hearken to the words. Whoſoever followeth not after Saul and after Samuel, ſo ſhall his oxen be ſerved. He doeth not ſay, whoſoever goeth not before Saul, but whoſoever followeth not after. An happy people if they knew their happines: for there are many, as ſheepe ſcattered without a ſhepheard, wc haue none to follow for their people &amp; their coūtries good. They need not ſay, as the elders of Gilead did vnto Iepthah,
               Iud. 11.6. 
               Cōe &amp; be our captaine that we may fight. Or awake Chriſt which ſleepeth when the ſhyp is endaungered with helpe maiſter or elſe we periſh.
               Mat. 8.25. But although Alcibiades ruler of Athens be but as a penthouſe,
               Plu. vit. The: 
               whom no man cares for in faire wether, but al runne vnder in time of reine: although the wicked men ſay of Saul,
               1. Sam. 10.27. 
               howe ſhal he ſaue vs, deſpiſe him, and bring him no preſentes: Yet

in time of need and countrey danger, Alcibiades offereth his vtmoſt help, &amp; Saul holdeth not his toung,2. Sam. 18.5. but he commaundeth the people, come and follow me. When David offered to go downe in battel, and to be a fellow partner with his people in their daungers, although it was his quarrell and not theirs, &amp; his life was ſhot at &amp; not the peoples: yet the people ſaied, Thou ſhalt not go foorth with vs to battaile, thou art better woorth then ten thouſand of vs, they wil not paſſe though halfe of vs were ſlaine: howe much more then ſhould they be ready to come, whē the woorthies of Iſrael venter for their ſafety, and the heads of the people put their liues in daunger, for their people &amp; their countries good. They ſhould be ready, yea, &amp; as the men of Ephraim ſaid vnto Gedeō &amp; chode him ſharply, which wtout their helpe,Iud. 8.1. had diſcomfited Midian; ſaying, why haſt thou ſerved vs thus, that thou calledſt vs not, whē thou wenteſt to fight againſt Midian? even ſo ſhoulde the people come, and chide ſharply with their governours &amp; ſay, why haue you ſerved vs thus? why did you not call vs, whē you wēt to fight againſt our enemies? But it is far otherwiſe with the people of this land: they are ſo far from chiding with their governours, becauſe they are not called, whē they goe to warre: that they fret when they are

called, when they go to warre: that they fret when they are called, and regard not them that are in peril abroad, ſo they may ſleepe in ſafety at home. Wherfore being men of ſhalow heades, which knowe not to rule nor well to be ruled, the ruler muſt call with his voice, and to his calling adde threates, and to his threates yet ſome farther paine, or elſe hee ſhall haue neither menne, nor mony nor apte furniture for a needefull warre. Wherefore as when Abimilech did beſeege the tower of Sichem, hee went vppe to the mount Zalmon,
               Iud. 4.48. 
               tooke an axe, cutte downe bowes, bare them on his ſhoulders, and ſaide vnto the people, what yee haue ſeene mee doe, make haſt and doe the like. Even ſoe muſt the rulers and captaines, that are content to take their axes, cutte downe boughes, and beare them on their ſhoulders, ſay with authority vnto the people, in time of neede and countrie ſervice, what yee ſee vs doe, make haſt and doe the like. For as in a clocke or watch, all the wheeles ſhoulde goe, when the Maiſter wheele doth mooue, and if any ſtay, the ſame putteth all out of frame, and muſt bee mended: even ſoe in publike ſtates and civill governementes, If the prince doe mooue as the cheefe commaunder and

maſter wheele, the people ſhoulde followe, and if any ſtay and trouble the whole, the ſame is to bee mended,Mat. 22.21 and forced to his due and timely order. For as the people ought to learne to giue vnto Caeſar that which is Caeſars, and vnto GOD that which is Gods. So ſince the prince repreſenteth here the perſon of God,
               Pſal. 82.6. Dan. 18. Rom. 13.6 
               and is his vicegerent vpon earth, hee ought to teeach the people if they will not learne, that he beareth not as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh the ſworde in vaine.
               Rom. 13.4 But that, as hee is the miniſter of God for the good of them that doe well, ſo hee is alſo the miniſter of GOD for the vengeaunce of ſuch as doe evill. Wherefore if any ſoule will not be ſubiect to the higher power, and will not pay tribute to whom tribute belongeth, cuſtome to whome cuſtome, feare to whome feare, &amp; that for conſcience ſake as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh,Rom. 13.5 then are they to bee made to doe it for feare, for hee beareth not the ſworde in vaine. Yea the princes ought to ſpeake to ſuch, which with their frowardneſſe trouble and encomber all,Ioſh 7.29. as Ioſhua did to Achan: In as much as thou haſt troubled vs, the lord ſhal trouble thee this day. For as whē the people refuſed Samuel to be there governor, the Lord ſaid, they haue not refuſed thee, but me to reigne over thē:
               1. Sam. 87. evē
               
ſo when they refuſe the powers whom god hath ſet over,
               Rom. 13.1. and are not obediēt vnto their voice, in matters wherein they may commaund, and which doe concerne the publike good; they haue not refuſed the voice of man only, but of God, &amp; therfore ought at the hāds of man, which they ſhal, as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh,Rom. 13.2. at the handes of god; receaue iudgemēt vnto themſelues. Wherefore as the Lord willed to diſcharge him the army,
               Deu. 20.8. 
               that was afraide, and faint harted, leaſt he make his brothers heart to faint, as doth his owne: ſo ſtandeth it with the wiſedome and policy of the ruler, to take away the froward and rebellious, from amidſt the people, to remooue ſuch as withdrawe their helpe, and will not be ready when they are commaunded: leaſt as ill ſuffered ſamples they marre other, and make them like vnto themſelues. When Barak gaue battaile vnto Iabin king of Canaan,
               Iud. 5.21. after the victory he ſang, Curſe ye Meroz, ſaith the angel of the lord, (a place near Tabor where the battaile was fought) and curſe the inhabitantes thereof: (and why?) becauſe they came not to helpe the Lord, to help the lord againſt the mighty. And if they are curſed which came not to help being yet vncalled, much more are they to bee puniſhed, which being called yet refuſe to come. When Iſraell went to puniſh the menne of

               Gibeah, for their barbarous leudnes practiſed againſt the Levites wife, after they had by armes taken vengeaunce on ſo foule a fact; they made enquirie,
               Iud. 21.5. 
               whether there were any of Iſrael, that came not vp to helpe, and behold the mē of Iabeſh Gilead came not to the hoſt: therfore they ſent thither 12000.verſ. 10. 
               men, &amp; gaue thē in cōmaunde, which they perfourmed, to ſmite Iabeſh Gilead with the edge of the ſword. And if an whole city yea womē &amp; children which could not come, were yet deſtroied, becauſe the mē came not, much more ought ſome few be puniſhed, and which are men: and if thus they were dealte with, becauſe they came not to fight againſt their brethren, much more if they come not againſt a forraine enemy.2. Sa. 19.26 When David fled from the face of Abſalō, Mephiboſheth ſtaied behinde (true he coulde not come, for he was lame, and his ſervant had deceaved him) but had he bin able to follow, and yet would not, although he was the ſō of Ionathā
                which honored David before a kingdome,verſ. 30. Num. 32. yet then had the ſentence of David been good &amp; right do thou &amp; Ziba divide the lāds. When Reuben &amp; Gad and the halfe tribe of Manaſſeh deſired the land beyond Iordā
                to inherit,verſ. 17. indeed they went armed before their brethrē
                and returned not, til the land of Canaan was ſubdued, and the other tribes had there to inherit:

but if they would haue had their brethren gone to war,
               Verſ. 29. 
               &amp; they to reſt in quiet: they ſhould Ioſh. 22.4 
               not haue had that land given them to poſſeſſe, but ſhould haue Num. 32. v. 23 &amp; 23. been ſinners againſt the lord, and againſt Iſraell, &amp; the ſin wherin they had ſinned, ſhould haue founde them out. Wherefore ſince to diſobey the prince, whē he commandeth for gods glory and the countries good, is not to diſobey the voice of manne onely but of god, and to refuſe not onely Samuell but God to reigne over them: ſince they ſhould be made to obay for feare, which will not for conſcience: becauſe the prince hereth not the ſword in vaine: ſince Mephiboſheth might iuſtly haue loſt his land, Gad and Reuben their in heritaunce, if they had not warred for their brethren whē they were called ſince Meroz was curſed, and that by the angel of the lord, becauſe they did not come being yet vncalled and this Iabeſh Gilead was wholy diſpeopled, becauſe being called they did not come. The prince ought to ſay vnto the people, as Abimelech did vnto his, What you ſee vs do make haſt and doe the like; and if either in covert or openly they refuſe, to ſpeake as Ioſhua did vnto Achan, In as much as you haue troubled vs, the LORDE ſhall trouble you this day. And thus much for the ſummons of Saul. Nowe let vs conſider

the vſage of the people.
            And they came out as one man:The readines of the people. firſt they came, then they came as Iud. 20.1. 1. Sa. 11.3. 
               one man, and laſtly they came, with ſpeed
                  •
               : or the men of Iabeſh aſked but ſeven daies 
               
                  〈◊〉
               , &amp; before the ſeven daies were expired, they came to their ſuccour three hundred &amp; thirty thouſand men. They came, they hired not ether,1. Sa. 11.8. but they came in perſon, nether ſent they their furniture and their money, but they came wt their furniture and their money. If Saul blowe the trumpet,
               1. Sa. 13.3 Verſ 17. 
               with heare ô ye Hebrewes: the people gather together after Saul. Thus did they. But nowe my brethren when your rulers do call, &amp; countrie require, do you come? If you do, this your comming doth witnes to the comforte of your ſoule
                  •…
                and glory of your ſelues, that you are Chriſtians, which labour with your neighbours harms? that you are wiſe, which ſee your dā
               ger to go linked with chefes, that you feare God, reverence your prince, that you cary in you the courage of the auncient Engliſh▪ whoſe glory was to rule not to bee ruled, whoſe eyes coulde not abide to ſee their children brended, nor hartes ſuffer their coū
               trie, whom they founde moſt free, to be move thrall vnto a forraine enimy. Yet there are (ſuffer I pray you if I ſpeake more freely, &amp; conſider whether I ſpeake the truth, and for

that end that thinges might bee remedied) which neither haue wits to conceaue their countries daunger, nor harts to regard their brethrens neede, gods feare, or their princes commound. But which ether of ignoraunce becauſe they know not, or of vile miſerablenes▪ becauſe they are loath to ſpare, or of ſetled malice, becauſe they wiſh for a day, &amp; wait for a chaunge, wt god graūt that they may never ſee; do not at all come, or if they doe, they come not with ſpeede but with leaden feete, not wholy but by halues, for feare of their oxen, rather thē for the regard of their prince or good of their countrie. The which, as they are of two ſortes, in quality divers and different in them ſelues, ſo they are to be diſtinguiſhed in our ſpeech. Wherfore concerning the malicious and Hiſpanionated Engliſh,Mat. 3.7. who like a vſperous brood ſeeke their welfare in their coūtries thrall, &amp; their vpriſing in the downfal of other: for whoſe cauſe this great Naaſh is now entered Fraunce, and aſſayed to put foote into this our countrie, we are to pray that god would chaunge their heartes, &amp; the maieſtrate is to looke that they may do no hurt. But for you whoſe heartes are Engliſh, and deſires are for your countries good if your deſires had that force in them, which might moue you to performe your duties, or could accompliſh the things that they do deſire,

neither ſhould you in much deſiring, doe litle or nothing of yt you do deſire: nether ſhuld his forces without impeachment, thus braue it in the realme of Fraunce, or ſettle themſelues in Brittaine, vnto our countries hurt. For what time? or what better occaſion doe you ſeeke? or when will you do thoſe thinges that you ought, if you wil not do them now? for hath he not attempted the invaſion of our land? and doth he not intend the conqueſt of ye ſame? hath not your fiers, which you haue kindled, in the coaſtes of the Indies, Portugalle and Spain, ſo inflamed, fired, and ſcorched his hart; that he wil not be cooled but by the water of theſe brytiſh ſeas, nor eſed of his heat, till he hath ſpit it on your countrie, and fired your land? Remember that when the Belgick Lion intituled Queene Mary your ſovereignes ſiſter,Air ſinger the only lawful daughter of Henry the eight, &amp; the voice was in Dalvas government, that in the right of his wife, he might beſt begin the conqueſt of Netherland, heere in this realme: that then you wiſhed, that they of Netherland were become your friendes. And behold they haue yeelded of their cites, and woulde feine be ſubiect to your ſovereignes lore. After when the French was doubtfull, and the Guiſe practiſed ſo many maſſacres in Fraunce, and continued a profeſſed enemy to this ſtate:

it was in youre wiſhes, that the Guiſe weare deade, that the French were become a faſt friende vnto your ſovereigne, and if GOD ſo woulde, that the Navarre might ſucceede him in the croune. And behold this God hath given him to your good. When the Navarre was proclaimed, then remembring the great forces of the king of Spaine, you wiſhed, that hee might not be a neutrall betwixt Spaine and vs, but that he might bee an enemie to the Spaniſh popedome. Beholde God hath made him an enemie, inputting into the hart of the Spaniard, to invade his kingdome, and a frend to you, nay ſuppliant, to aſke and require your help. Stande and view the woorkes of GOD and wonder of poſterity, ſince God fighteth for you, refuſe not you to fight for your ſelues. If you ſpeake of peace, the name is moſt ſweete, and the treaſure moſt precious. For peace breedeth plentie where warre bringeth want. But it is not, as the ſtate nowe ſtandeth, in your choice for to haue peace with Spaine. For there is no man of reaſon, that canne yet looke for peace, except ſuch a peace, which is like money that is taken at intereſt, which for a while maketh the borrower ſeeme rich, and anone eateth him out of houſe and home. But ſince this is a neceſſity, that god hath

impoſed, &amp; the welfare of your poſterity doth require, that you muſt haue warre, that ſo you may haue peace; that you muſt lay a ſure and deep foūdation, although to your coſt, that ſo you and youres may the better builde vppon. Whether is it better for you to warre in Fraunce, and with mutual forces to weaken and pluck downe a common enemy: or to ſtay till he hath had his forth in the kingdome of Fraunce, and dukedome of Brittaine; till hee come not with his owne forces onely as before, but with the flower of Fraunce and of other nations; nor from farre places of Spaine and Portugalle, but from the neighbour havens and portes of Fraunce; and put in, not into one, but into ſundry places of your natiue countrie? Now whether of theſe is better, I ſhoulde ſaie worſe, I neede not ſpeake, and God graunt that you may never trie. But why doth the loue of you, drawe mee to reach after matters, that are to high for me? Since it is the glorie of the ruler to conceal his counſels, and theſe thinges that are knowen, are ſufficient to mooue all well meaning Engliſh: ſince it is for our Saul and rulers for to governe, and for vs their people to obey; ſince they ſay vnto vs as Iehu did to the meſſenger of Iehoram,
               1. Reg. 9.19 
               which aſked, Is it peace? what haſt thou to do with

peace, turn thee behinde me? let vs turn behind and follow them: and let the rich come with their riches, and offer frankly, that they may enioy the reſt in quiet: let the young and abled, the gard of our countrie, come wt their bodies, and haſten to their glory; that their friendes and kinſfolke may liue in ſafety: let the leaders and captaines come with their troupes, and redeeme their honours, which ſome haue impeached: let all ſortes come, &amp; al ſortes helpe, and all ſortes pray &amp; wiſh wel to the captaines of Iſraell, and the armies of our god. And grudge not to ſpend on them your money, which do not grudge for you to ſpend their bloud. Refuſe not to giue to David and his men ſome litle of your ſtore,1. Sam. 25. ve. 11. &amp; 38 Paul. Iov. Hiſt. lib. 3. 
               leaſt a Naballes miſery finde a Naballes ende. Paulus Iovius ſheweth, that whē the Florentins would haue made Piſa tributary to their city, the women &amp; matrons did ſo loue their liberty, that when money wanted, they gaue their chaines and Iewelles, to maintain the warres, and ſo they procured both peace and liberty. After Piſa was threatned by the Florentins againe, and the maieſtrates moved a levy for the warres, the people thought al to much that then was given, ſo that for want of money, there were not ſufficient levied for their defence, when their danger through their ſparing grewe, and they were paſt recovery:

in the ende, they offered poundes in ſteede of pence, but al to late, they loſt their money, countrie, and themſelues. Looke to the enſample and lay it to youre ſelues: It was ſaied, that although good Iehoſaphat did moſt ſeriouſly endevoure,
               2. Cro. 19, verſ. 4. yet in his raigne the high places we are not taken away: what was the reaſon?2. Cro. 20.33. 
               yet the people had not prepared their mindes towardes the god of their forefathers. Euen ſoe although our Iehoſhaphat do labor and ſeeke her peoples good, yet ſhe muſt needes be fruſtrate of her deſire, except the people ſette to their helping handes, except the people ſet to their helping hartes. Wherefore ſet to both your handes and hartes, and let no man ſay vnto you as Abiathar did vnto the elders of Iudah,
               2. Sa. 19.12. 
               why are you ſo ſlow to bring backe the king? to bring in your levies? ſince as of David the houſe of Iſrael ſaied, it is he that hath ſaved vs from al our enemies:
               verſ. 10. ſo may we ſay, which you know, that by your levies they are in part mainteined, which doe ſaue you from your enemies.
            And thus much for this yt the people came: now let vs cōſider what moved Saul to ſummon the people, &amp; what made the people vpō 
               Saules ſummons, with that ſpeede and readines for to come. Both which are noted in the text: for the ſpirite of the Lord came

vpon Saul,
               The ſpirit &amp; feare of the lord moveth king and people to lēd ſuccor and then he was exceeding angry: and againe the feare of the Lord came vpon the people, and then they came forth even as one man. It was not of himſelfe, it was the ſpirite of the Lord that made him angry, and zealous for his peoples good. It was not of themſelues, is was the feare of the LORDE, that made the people, with ſo great an army, vppon ſo ſmall a warning, with that ſpeede and value for to come. For let there be never ſo great occaſions offered to do good, &amp; the neede be never ſo vrgent, and the opportunity ſuch, that it muſt be ether now or never: yet if the ſpirite of the Lord come not vppon Saul and vppon our rulers, they will ſitte ſtill and ſleepe, they will not bee angry, neither will they ſummon the people for to followe them. Yea let Saul call, and necesſity vrge, the Prince threaten and their duty commaunde the people to come forth and followe Saul: yet except the feare of the Lord do fall vpon them, they will ſtep back, and ſeeke delayes, they will not come, but as beares that are drawen vnto the ſtake. So that, as it was the ſpirite of the Lorde,Exod. 13.3. Neh. 1.1. that made Bezaliel fit for the woorke of the materiall tabernacle, nay that ſtirred vppe the hart of Cirus, for the rebuilding againe of the temple deſtroied.
               1. Reg. 22. 
               As it was a lying and evill

ſpirite that mooved Ahab to battaile,
               1. Sam. vl. 
               and caried Saul to his owne deſtruction:
               2. Sa. 17.14 
               ſo it was the good ſpirite of God, that brought to nought the counſell of Achitophel,
               Iud. 11.29. 
               and ſtirred vp Iepthah, to the repulſing of Ammon. O pray then, that this ſpirite may fall vppon our rulers, and this feare on oure people, that the one may leade with counſell, and the other followe with courage, for the reliefe of Iabeſh againſt Naaſh of Spaine.Iud. 15. For as Sampſon whiles his locks were hanging, &amp; not touched with razor, with a iaw bone ſlew his thouſand, and bare away the gates of the city, wherein hee was incloſed: but having loſt his lockes, did leeſe his ſtrength, and became then weake as an other man: even ſo as long as the ſpirite of the Lorde, as the lockes of Sampſon ſhal abide on our coūſel &amp; on our captaines, ſo long they ſhal be able to counſel &amp; do for the beſt, even able to do al thinges, through the power of him, which doth ſtrengthen thē: but if this ſpirit as the lockes of Sampſon bee taken away, there is no ſuch ſtrength in them as before. So that if we ſeke, what made Caleb to 
               Nu. 14.9. 
               deſpiſe the forces of the Cananites whom they came to expel, Nu. 13.34 Nu. 14.10. whō yet al Iſraell feared as the ſons of Anack, invincible Giantes? even this, he was of an other ſpirit: but Caleb was of an other ſpirit. Or what made David
               
being but a child,1. Sa. 18.33 to offer the encounter to ye great Goliah? even this, he came not in the power of fleſhe, or ſtrength of mans arme, but in the power &amp; ſtrength of the everliving god.
               verſ 45. 1. Sa. 14.6. Or what made Ionathan with one young man, to ventex on the garriſon of the vncircumciſed? evē this; that the ſpirit of the lord was vpō him, and he knew that it was al one with the lord, to overcom with few as with many. Wherfore let Achilles ſcoffe at the counſell of his father, and ſay it is for daſtardes and not for him, to craue for victory of the goddes; yet it is god that giveth ſtrength,
               Pſa. 68.35. Pſa. 18.39. verſſ. 47. 
               that giveth victory, without whō we are moſt weake, &amp; moſt certaine for to looſe. For as Adam though he was made by the finger of god,Gen. 2.7. and faſhioned by the handes of the al making creator, yet had no power to ſhew the actions of a liuely ſoule, til god brethed in his noſtrels the breath of life: even ſo although they be Achilles, men of limme &amp; bone, although leaders and captaines, men of renoune: yet they are of no hart, no ſpirit, except god breath in them the ſpirit of courage and of ſtrength. They may ſay with Pharaoh and the AEgyptiās,Exod. 5.2. 
               who is the lord that we ſhould heare his voice and let Iſraell goe? Yet if the lord ſhall ſtrike them wt his feare, they ſhall force the Iſraelites to departe in haſt;Exod. 12.32. and although they purſue with chariots

and with horſe, yet the AEgyptiās ſhal ſay every one vnto his neighbour,
               Exod. 14.26. 
               come let vs fly from the face of Iſraell, for it is the lord that fighteth for them. Whether this,Iud. 7.2. 
               even that we vaunt not our ſelues and ſay, it is our right handes, that hath ſaved vs,
               Hab. 1.16. 
               that we ſacrifice not vnto our nettes and burne incenſe vnto our yarne, and ſay by them is our portion fat, &amp; our meat made plenteous: that we aſcribe not the ſucceſſe to the wiſedome of our councell, value of our ſouldiers, prowes of our captaines; but vnto him which giveth a ſpirite to Saul and his feare to the people, which worketh,
               Iſai. 43.13. Dan. 4.32. 1. Cro. 29.11. 1 Sa. 2.30. 
               al overruleth all, giveth victory vnto whom hee wil. Thus if we honour him, he ſhal honour vs, and ſhal make vs a glorious people in the ſight of al nations,Reve. 4.10 and he ſhal ſet crounes of glory vppon our heades, which caſt them downe before his feet. Yea let vs knowe and acknowledge, that as it is he that hath given wiſdome to our wiſe,
               Pro. 2.6. Iſai. 40.29. Pro. 21.30 Iſai. 29.14. Ezech. 24.25. and ſtrength vnto our valiaūt: ſo it is he that can take away the wiſedome frō our wife, and counſel frō our prudent, that can make our ſtrong men like childrē, and valiaunt as the water that hath no power to ſtand. For as water waxeth whot, being heated on the fier, but being ſet apart, becommeth key cold, as it was before. even ſo although the ſonnes of men are

made whot &amp; burn in their valure, being warmed &amp; fired by the ſpirit, yet if the fier of gods ſpirit be once removed, and they be left vnto their colde and watery natures, they ſoone war key colde, as they were before, nether is there any heat or courage in them. Yea as the earth is light, but not of it ſelfe, but as it is illightened of the ſon: for if the ſon be ſet &amp; departed from vs, not only the hilles giue lōg ſhadowes, and the valleyes darknes, but all is covered with fearefull night: even ſo the wiſe of the world, and the children of might, they are like earth, which haue noe light or might in themſelues, but as they are illightened of the ſon, &amp; ſtrengthned from god: for if the ſon depart and take his reſt, not onely the valleyes, which are the people, but the chiefeſt hilles, ſhal for all their might, for all their wiſdome, be covered with darknes, and with feareful night. Wherefore ſince gods ſpirit is a ſon to illighten, &amp; fier to heat vs, which are but darknes &amp; cold in our ſelues, let vs not quench this fier, nor put out this light: ſince all is in his ſpirit that he hath given vs, and in the feare that he ſetleth in our heartes, lette vs ſacrifies to his praiſe, n
                  •
               t to our ſelues, and ſtil pray that he woulde giue his ſpirit to our princes, and feare to our people: that they may leade, and we follow as one man againſt the enemies of the Lorde.

This is that which I had to ſay. Now the Lord giue you of his ſpirit, and ſende you of his feare, that you may do the things, which may make for the good of your ſelues and of your children, the ſafety of your prince, gods glory, and the welfare of this youre natiue countrie. Amen.
