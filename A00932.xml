            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

               The faireſt and the fouleſt thing, that any man can name,
               Hath but a time to liue and die, in honour or in ſhame.
               No artificiall workemanſhip, no notable deuiſe,
               No valiant act, no noble déede, no puiſſant enterpriſe,
               But as in time triumphantly, it challengeth renowne,
               Euen ſo in time from honours hight, at laſt it tumbleth downe.
               The doubtfull ſtate of mortall man, an argument may bée,
               That nothing is perpetuall, which glanſing eie doeth sée,
               But tranſitorie, fraile, and vaine, as time demandes his fée.

               The gliſtering Starres in firmament, from brightnes ſhall decline,
               The ſcattered cloudes, like winding worme, or ſcortched parchment ſcroll,
               Shall ſhrinke together, as in ſkies they are conſtraind to roll.
               Then, ſith ecleſtiall creatures ſtate, ſo alterable is,
               That vaine we count each earthlie thing, I iudge it not amis.
               We ſee the ſeaſons of the yeare, ſucceſſiuely inſue,
               Firſt nipping Winters bluſtring blaſts, with froſts as ſtiffe as glue,
               Then pleaſant Spring with colours clad, of yellow, greene, and blue:
               Next which comes ripening Summer in, and then doth follow faſt,
               Quicke Harueſt for the huſbandman, t'acquite his charges paſt,
               No time hath this prerogatiue, for euermore to laſt.
               Lo thus in circle runs the yeare, with compaſſe round about,
               And his appointed age the world, by portions weareth out.
               Count what we can moſt excellent, néedes muſt it haue an ende,
               Againſt decay there is no force, nor fortreſſe to defende.
               How

                   many Cities ſtately built, of timber, lime and ſtone,
               Are come to naught, and in their place a deſert left alone?
               Pompe maketh not perpetuall, although it beare a port,
               A Maigame I may name it well, a paſtime and a ſport,
               Whoſe glorie glides and ſlips away, whoſe pleaſure is but ſhort.
               Like Plaiers in an Enterlude, vpon a common ſtage,
               One repreſenting luſtie youth, another crooked age,
               One royall Principalitie, another Courtlie ſtate,
               One like a Iudge doth ſit on bench, another begges at gate,
               Thus counterfet they all degrées, vntill the play be donne:
               Euen ſo is man vpon the earth, ſince firſt his ſtocke begonne.
               For Adam, though he liued long, yet dead he was at laſt,
               The Patriarchs and Prophets olde, their pilgrimage haue paſt:
               Kings haue reſigned vp their crownes, and titles of their thrones,
               And many a politike Gouernour in graue hath laid his bones,
               This proue the

               The wiſdome of the wiſe is vaine, the ſtrong mans ſtrength a toy,
               If they by them as inſtruments, ſéeke length of life t'enioy:
               And as for wealth, it is but winde, for riches haue no holde,
               The monied man muſt thinke to die, if once he waxeth olde.
               Lo, lo, a preſent patterne here, all you that liſt to learne,
               By viewing of this corps corrupt, what you ſhall be diſcearne.
               Sometime he was, as others be, a quicke and liuing man,
               But wounded with the dart of death, reuiue him nothing can.
               His youthfull yeares, as others haue, this good Eſquire hath had,
               And crooked age by créeping on, with weakeneſſe ſicke and ſad,
               In winding ſhéete at head and foote, faſt knit his corps hath clad.
               Rich in his life,For I haue heard it credibly reported, that he left little or nothing vndiſtributed. poore at his death, a ſteward of the Lordes,
               His talent Chriſtianly laide out, with Gods good will accordes.
               And as in th' Actes, Cornelius déedes, beare witneſſe of his faith,
               (For outwarde workes before the world, beléefe within bewraith:)
               So this religious Gentleman, a Patrone to the poore,
               In allies and in lanes abrode, at home in th'entrie doore,
               In open ſtréete, in holie Church, in many a corners crooke,
               (Where, for the poore and impotent, whom kith and kin forſooke,
               With charitable zeale inflamde, this lowelie Lambe did looke,)
               His almes he hath diſtributed, and giuen as he ſawe néede,
               Cloth for the backe, meate for the mouth, the hungrie ſoule to féede.
               As louing as a Lambe he liud, and verifide his name,
               He was an eie vnto the blind, a legge vnto the lame,
               A comfort to the comfortles, a ſuccour to the ſicke,
               A father to the fatherles, whome nipping néede did pricke,
               A huſband to the deſolate, and widowe left alone,
               A fauourer and a fréend to all, an enimie to none.
               NowPoore people ſhall ſone feele the loſſe of this Lambe by the lacke of their relief. ſuch as had his wooll to weare, lament of him the lacke,
               His fleſh did fill their bellies full, his fléeſe kept warme their backe,
               His pence and pounds preſerued them, from many a wringing wracke.
               No miſſe of mercie was in him, for iointly hart and hand,
               Were pliant to ſupplie the wantes, of many in this land.
               For this he knew, by giuing them, he lent vnto the Lord:
               His humblenes no homelines, of ſicklie ſoule abhord.
               So that I may conclude of him, as néedes conclude I muſt,
               If workes may ſimply of themſelues, make righteous men and iuſt,
               (Which I denie, for vnto faith this office is aſſinde:)
               Then is he ſanctifide from ſinne, and cleanſd in hart and minde.
               The fruites of faith which flouriſhed, in him whiles he did liue,
               His diuerſe diſtributions, and giftes which he did giue,
               The monuments which he hath left, behind him being ded,
               Are ſignes thatFor Chriſt will repay y• a thouſand fold, which is giuen to ye ſuccourles. Chriſt our Shepherd hath, vnto his ſhéepfold led,
