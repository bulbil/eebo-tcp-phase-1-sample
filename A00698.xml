            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

            TO THE MOSTE HIGH and vertuous Princeſſe ELIZABETH, by the grace of God, Quene of Englande, Fraunce, and Irelande, defendour of the faith. &amp;c. long raigne, proſperous health, and perpetuall felicitie.
            
               
                  THAT ELECT VESSEL and bleſſed Apoſtle S.Rom. 13. Paule ſaieth, that all power commeth from God: and that he that reſiſteth power, reſiſteth the ordinaunce of God. Whereas then, it hath pleaſed the greate Lord of Lordes, and Kyng of Kynges (moſte gracious ſoueraigne Ladie) to enſtalle your highneſſe by his diuine prouidence, in the Roialle throne of maieſtie, to rule ouer this realme of Englande: it behoueth your grace to be vigilaunt and carefull, that the weightie adminiſtracion thereof, bee by your good gouuernemente, throughlie executed and diſcharged. Whiche then cometh to paſſe, when God is in his creatures truelie glorified and honoured, and the people trained vp in godlie learnyng, decēt order, and

vertuous conuerſacion. And althoughe there bee many holeſome Lawes and ordinaunces, ſette foorthe and eſtabliſhed in your graces dominiōs, wherby your highneſſe ſubiectes bee brideled and reſtrained, from corrupt abuſes and licenciouſneſſe of liuyng, and enduced to embrace Iuſtice, temperaunce, vpright dealing, and all kindes of vertues: yet as ſoone as one vice or enormitie is rooted out and aboliſhed, an other more notorious and horrible ariſeth and encreaſeth (ſoche is the peruerſitet of man, prone to all kinde of iniquitie) euen as it were out of Hydras heade. So eaſie is the waie that leadeth manne to perdicion: ſo harde is the paſſage that bryngeth hym to ſaluacion. But happie be thei, yea, and mooſte happie that can ſo ſtronglie arme theim ſelues, that thei maie be able to encounter the fearce aſſaultes of their enemie, to neglect the wicked allurementes of the worlde, to paſſe the ſtreites of yearthlie vanitees, and to prouide theim ſelues of ſuche furniture for their iourney, that frō this vale of miſerie and calamitee, thei maie be conueighed vnto the high palaice of felicitie, from this mortafie and viſible habitacion, vnto that immortall and inuiſible Hieruſalem. Vnto the whiche manſion place, not the dreames and fancies of

the olde Philoſophers, nor their vaine ſuperſticions and fonde tradicions (although ſome of theim deuiſed many good Lawes and rules for politique gouuernement) can directlie leade vs: but the diuine inſtitucions of the Prophetes of God, the ſounde doctrine of the Apoſtles, and the perfecte trueth of Chriſtes Goſpelle, are there vnto our mooſte ſure guides and conductours. In whiche pathe, ſoche maie the better learne to walke, as will diligentlie reade, and willinglie followe, ſuche learned leſſons &amp; godlie inſtructions, as are ſet forth in this treatiſe, touchyng the good orderyng of a common weale. Wherein as vices bee ſharplie rebuked, abuſes reproued, and many exhortaciōs vſed, that al impietee ſhould bee vtterlie abandoned: So bee vertues highlie commēded, good cuſtomes approued, and mennes myndes moued, to embrace Godlie liuyng.
            Whiche thinges how profitable and neceſſarie thei bee to bee knowen, ſoche ſhall beſte iudge, as haue reſpecte to their owne ſafetie, and tender mannes wealthe, and the common commoditee. And that your highneſſe ſubiectes of this your common weale of Englande, might the eaſelier vnderſtande the ſame, for their better inſtruccion, I haue publiſhed vnder your graces

protection, this peece of worke in our vulgare Engliſh toūgue, wherin (as nere as I could) I haue doen the duetie of a faiethfull interpretour. But when theſe my ſimple doynges, and firſt fruictes of my ſtudie, be preſented before your Maieſtie: it maie then pleaſe your highneſſe, to calle to your remembraunce, that GOD at the tyme of the erection of his tabernacle, did not onelieExod. 25. &amp; 35. accepte ſoche as brought to the beutifiyng and ornament thereof, golde, ſiluer, purple, ſcarlette, white ſilke, precious ſtones, ſweete perfumes, &amp; other riche and ſumptuous preſentes: but alſo he toke in verie good part the good willes of thē that offered braſſe, iron, goates heare, oile, candelſtickes, frankincenſe, and other thynges of like ſmalle value and importaunce. So my moſte humble peticion vnto your Maieſtee is (moſt benyng and gracious ſoueraigne) that you would aſwell accepte this my poore preſente, as though it were ſome greater gifte, or coſtlier iewell. And I (as my bounden duetie requireth, &amp; as it becometh al ſoche as owe vnto your highneſſe, their true allegeaunce) will praie to almightie God, that your grace maie long raigne ouer vs in greate honour, with victorie ouer all your enemies: and that this your graces common weale of Englande,

by your Godlie Lawes and ordinaunces, and throughe the comelie order, and honeſt behauiour of your highneſſe ſubiectes, maie bee a worthye ſpectacle of vertue to all chriſtendome.

            THE Firste Booke touchyng the good ordering of a common weale.
            
               
                  ¶The argument of the firſte Chapiter.
                  That manne is then in the redy waie toward true felicitie when the common weale, wherevnto nature hath made hym framable, and he hath yelden hymſelf, is by good gouernment well appoincted.
               
               
                  SEyng myne entent is to write, of the good orderyng of a common weale, me thinke it expediente to beginne at man, whiche bicauſe he ioyned hymſelf in felowſhip of life with others: cauſed firſt citees to bee builded, as one, that is emong all other kyndes and natures of liuing creatures alone receinable, aſwell of reaſon, as alſo of knowlege and forecaſt, wherof, all other thinges lacke the benefite. Whervpon M. Tullius writeth, that there is a certaine likenes ofLib. i. de legibus. couſinage betwene God and manne: Bicauſe that God, whē he had made all other liuyng thynges ſtoupe doune for foode, reared vp onely man, and giuyng hym an high countinaunce, ſtirred hym vp to heauen, as to viewe the place, frō whence his auncient parentage was fet. Man therefore by nature is bent to a ciuilitie, bent to gentlenes, &amp; ſo bent, that no poinct of vngentlenes might ſtain hym, if that by ſynne and a continuall corruption of life, he were not ledde to the contrarie: wherefore it is moſte for his behofe, to entre ſuche a trade of liuyng, as wherby he maie recouer, and ſhewe hymſelf by the couenaunt of his ſocietie, to be borne vnto the appliyng of vertue.
               
                  Not ſo moche but the Philoſophers Heathen writers by ſearche of thinges learned, that nature had laid in vs certain ſparcles and cheriſhementes of vertues, wherby incontinent we ſhould bee moued, to honeſtie and goodnes: to the ende that we might ſhewe the nighnes of our reaſon vnto God, if we were not hindered therein, by a certaine inward corrupeion and vntowardnes, whiche euen within our body ſwarueth from goodnes, forgettyng, that the euerlaſtyng father embraced man, with ſo greate zeale, with ſo great loue, that for his ſake whē
                  Man is lorde ouer yearthly thynges. he had made all thinges, he did put all vnder hym, declaryng by an vnreproueable reaſon, that all thynges, whiche be vpon yearth, were create and brought furthe for mannes vſe, and man to the glorie and honour of his creatour, from the whiche benefite of calling, he ſtreight degendreth, that folowyng vngodlineſſe, neither attaineth the true vſe of thinges, neither ſhooteth or bendeth his minde toward the pricke of this life. Wherein there is no neade to ſeke forreine teſtimonies, ſeyng the holie Scriptures bee ſo full thereof, for the holy Moſes ſaieth thus. And God created man, after the image and likenesGeneſis .i. of hymſelf, after the image of God he created hym, male and female he created them, and God bleſſed theim and ſaied: Encreaſe and bee multiplied, furniſhe the yearth, and bryng it vnder you, bee ye lordes ouer the fiſſhes of the ſea, and birdes of the aire, and al liuyng thinges that bee moued vpon the yearth, and God ſaied. Beholde, I haue giuen vnto you all herbes, that bryng furthe ſeede vpon the yearth, and all trees that haue in theim ſelues ſeede▪ graine, after their kinde, to bee vnto you for ſuſtenaunce, and to al that liueth vpon the yearth. &amp;c. And an other where. Bicauſe God created man to be vndeſtroyed, and made hym after the likenes of his own Image.Sapien. ii.
               
               You vnderſtand the excellencie of mankind, to whom it was not inough, that he was create after the likeneſſe of God, but alſo he had in charge to bee gouernour of all liuyng thinges. Therfore man is create to haue charitie to bee godlie and vertuous, to vſe the creatures ſubiecte

vnto hym to the glorie of God, to call vpon hym, and finally at his departure hence, to be conueied vp to heauē, wherevnto he is ordeined. For at the beginning he wasEccle. xv. ſo appoincted, that counſaill ſhould bee in his hande, and before hym ſhould be life and death, water and fire, good and euill, that he might ſtretche his hande: to whiche he would. But bicauſe he beſtowing that counſaill naughtely,Oſeae. viii. Soph. iii. Mannes tranſgreſſiō.
                   choſed to fall into ſinne, death enſued, bicauſe man did tranſgreſſe the lawe, and commaundement of God, whiche ſtaine hath iſſued frō the firſt man, into all mankinde, ſo that in hym there is nomore, either any truthe, mercie, or godlineſſe, but curſe, liyng, aduoutrie, manſlaughter, ſtealth, and all kinde of miſchief.
               Wherefore his glorie is tourned into ſhame, as the Prophet and the other ſcripture witneſſeth, ſo that thereIoan. iii. Luce. xviii. is not one, whiche can directe his counſaill to good, or attain vnto heauen, wherevnto he is allied, for no manne goeth vp vnto heauen, but he whiche came doune from heauen, the ſoonne of man that is in heauen. Therefore none is good but one, that is God.
               Howbeeit, although in this calamitie of mankynde, by reaſon of the corrupte nature, there is not one that of hymſelf can doe any good: yet thoſe ſparcles, whiche at the beginnyng were laied in manne, of himſelf to deſire honeſtie and goodneſſe, bee not ſo vtterly quenched, but that he maie by ſtudie compaſſe, bothe honeſtie and vertue, get the name of a good liuer in the common weale, and ſo as it were, win a certaine taſte of happineſſe. Accordyng to whiche drift, the elder Africane, me ſeameth,Scipios dreame. warned P. Cornelius Scipio in the dreame, reported by Marcus Cicero, in the ſixte of his bookes, whoſe argumente is touchyng a common weale, by theſe woordes: There is a certain and appoincted place in heauen, where ſuche, as haue ſaued, helpte, and enlarged their countrey, ſhall euerlaſtyngly enioye bleſſedneſſe. For there is nothyng more acceptable vnto God, the greate prince, whiche ruleth all this worlde, that can be doen in this worlde, then the aſſembles and repaire of menne.

Naie, to ſpeake the verie truthe, thei alone doe properly liue, whiche haue taken their flight, furthe of theſe bodily boundes, as it wer furthe of a iaole. For your life (as you terme it) is death.
               And in deede the bokes of olde writers, be full of ſuche as haue clomme aboue the ſterres, and been canonized emong ſainctes, either for ſome ſingularitie of iuſtice, and ſtoutneſſe, or ſhewyng ſome excellent qualitie, or otherwiſe deſeruyng well of their countrey: For thei haue vſed to accoumpte ſuche as goddes in deede, whiche haue doen well to men.

And after ſuche ſorte, God from tyme to tyme, hath alwaie raiſed vp certaine, whiche ſhould gather men to gether into citees, frame, &amp; guide theſame, whiche like good menne might kepe the reſt in quietneſſe. Whiche poinct, ſeyng it commeth by the verieA politicall felicitie. motion of nature, it maie not be iudged to ſurmount nature, muche leſſe, ought it to be rekened any poinct of ciuill gouernement, and to be imputed to the true goodneſſe. Neither yet, although I accompte theſe, not to be any parcelles of the verie true and godly goodnes, doe I therefore holde it euill, in our ciuill life to liue vertuouſly, to obeie lawes, not to doe to other, that we would not haue doen to our ſelues, as without whiche the ſocietie of men, appoincted originally by the ordinaunce of God ſhould hang ſtaileſſe, and become rather a ſwarme of vilaines,

               So it appeareth, that, accordyng vnto this diuiſion, ſuche thynges, whiche we doe well in the comon weale, be good, but ciuilly: from doyng whereof we muſt in no

                   that is good, to giue the fruicte of our faithe, and yet, when we haue doen all, we muſt confeſſe our ſelues to bee vnprofitable ſeruauntes. So earneſtly muſt we continue in our duetie, that we maie haue in vs peace, mildneſſe, gentleneſſe, goodneſſe, faithe, charitie, mekeneſſe, ſobreneſſe, and euery poincte of vertue, that ſo we bryng furthe fruicte worthy repentaunce, and the more we doe, the leſſe ought we to attribute to our ſelues, to the ende we gather no ſtomacke, but thanke God for all, whiche is the aucthour of all, whiche hath mercie where him liketh, and beſtoweth our workes, according to his owne arbitrement. Therfore ſainct Paule ſaieth:Galath. vi. Let vs not be weried with doyng good, for in due ſeaſon we ſhall reape again vnwearied. Wherefore, while we haue tyme, let vs doe good, to all men, but principally to our neighbours in faithe. See ye not how we bee commaunded to dooe good, and that without any ceaſſyng? And he that teacheth this, writeth alſo: we thinke therfore, that man is iuſtified by faithe, without the workes of the lawe, whiche in deede are good, but by theim weeRoma. iii. be not iuſtified: how beit to them that loue God, all thinges woorke to good.
               The more dooe ſuche naughtie menne iudge a miſſe, whiche ſaie that good, is not good, and doe either vtterly dehorte other from the honeſt diſcipline of good behauiour, and good workes, or els ſo lightly paſſe thē ouer, that you ſhall hardely finde emong Chriſtians, what is honeſtie of liuyng, diſcipline of good behauiour, or vertue it ſelf, if you ſhould ſeke theſame, as it were with a light candle: for ſo muche as euery idle man, is giuen ouerGalath. v. to his own deſires, and in the meane while, the windowe is opened, not without the offendyng of the Gentiles, to all vices of the fleſhe, as be aduoutrie, horedome vncleaneſſe, wantonnes, Idolatrie, enemitie, ſtrief, compariſons,The workes of the fleſhe. angre, contention, ſedition, hereſie, enuie,

ſlaughter, dronkennes, ſurfait, miſtruſt, and ſoche like, the doers whereof ſhall neuer enherite the kyngdome of God. And theſe ſo deteſtable vices, at this daie raigne in ſuche ſorte in the common weale, as neither at any time greater, ne yet euer the like.
               For whiche cauſe, euery good man muſt trauaile in this poinct, that the old diſcipline called again, common weales maie beginne to be the aſſemblies, and reuerent reſortes of good men, wherein euery man maie attaine the vſe of thynges in ſuche ſorte, as becometh a chriſtian manne, wherein God maie be called vpon and glorified. For life, as Marcus Varro ſaieth, is giuen to man, not for his owne ſake, but to ſhewe ſome worthie faict therin, yea, to aſcende vp ward, and by theſe tranſitorie thinges, to conceiue an hope, and bend his mynd to the euerlaſtyng. Muche leſſe ought wee, as menne allured with Mearmaides ſonges, and thereby lingeryng aboute the rockes, where thei haunt, to ſpende our tyme in contemplatiue ſtudies, till we be old, and not ones fall to debate the cauſe, why we haue this life lent vs, to thende it maie bee laied before our iyes, wherevnto we bee borne, how muche we be bounde to our creatour, how muche to our neighbour, whereas the very Philoſophers doe teache, that man is partly bredde for mannes behoufe, that thei maie mutually one help thother. And Socrates full well anſwered, that he was more profitable to a cōmon weale that taught other, and made many fitte to rule therein: then he that gouerned well hymſelf.
               And although it be harde to amende the euill, whicheMan is naturally ciuill by long and old putrefiyng, hath as it wer ioynted it ſelf in man, yet bicauſe man is naturally ciuill, and commonable, that is, ſuche as is ready to obeic lawes, to ioyne in the ſocietie of life to helpe other, to tender his owne commoditie, without any harme to other, to deſire that is vpright and good, to fauour honeſtie, to dooe that apperteineth to this his life, wherein he hath matched him ſelf with others, an inſtruction to good life, is not to bee neglected: for he hath reaſon, whereby he can ſuffer hymſelf

to be brought to frame, he hath the benefite of ſpeche aboue all other liuyng creatures, whereby he bothe teacheth others, ſuche thynges as be beſte, and vnderſtandeth and printeth them in his hart, when thei be taught him. Yet notwithſtandyng mankind, by ſinne and trāſgreſſyng of Gods commaundemente, is ſo loſt and corrupte, that he alwaie leaneth to that, whiche is forbidde hym, and bendeth more earneſtly to euill, then that he can ones thinke of that is good, for that there is not one, that can doe good, no not one. For if ye vnderſtand that kynde of good, whiche wee before called the true good, whiche healpeth vnto the atteignyng of the euerlaſtyng life, I dooe not deny, but that manne can dooe no part therof, bicauſe it is farre from our reache, hanging onely vpon him, whiche reputeth this of ours to iuſtice, or vniuſtice. Seeyng no manne, as Hieremie ſaieth, can ones ſpeake good, but onely God, whiche frely iuſtifieth vs, by the mediatour Ieſus Chriſte. That therefore isRoma. iii. good, whiche in our cōmon life, we doe vſe to call good, wherunto by nature, how muche ſo euer ſhe be periſhed, according to my former reaſon, we haue certain drieſeedes left in vs, whereby we be moued to that is good and vpright, wherby we maie be made commonable &amp; ciuill. Whoſe cōtrarie, the Lawyer vſeth ofte times to terme, vnciuill, a worde of fine and large ſignification, betokenyng that, whiche doeth not agree with lawes, honeſtie and ordinaunces of a citee, appoincted by the rule of iuſtice, and vprightnes. After that kinde of goodneſſe, doe we meaſure the vertues, whiche prophane writers doe ſo moche alledge, and commende vnto vs, and counterplace theim to vices, whiche lurke in man, by reaſon of his worne cuſtome in cuill, no leſſe then fire in the flint, whiche vnleſſe thei be practiſed by diſcipline, teachyng, perpetuall labour, and ſuche thynges as bee profitable, honeſt and worthy a good manne, bothe priuatly and a peartly, deſerue no commendations: but haue that kind of life, wherin thei ſhewe no actiuitie, like brute beaſtes, and tourne it into a kinde of death.

Here I make no rekenyng to recompte the ſtate, whiche manAmbroſius Hexamer. lib. vi. ca. ix. had in Paradiſe, before he fell: whiche was, that he willed onely good, yet for all that, by the promptyng of the ſerpent, he did miſcarie, and breake Gods commaundement: whiche if he had not dooen, he ſhould neuer haue felt death, but haue brought furthe children, of theſame eſtate to hymſelf, without carnall concupiſcence, or any

Furthermore, although forLi. xiii. &amp; xiiii. this his treſpace, manne was ſacked, and diſpoiled of his former honour, ſo that where he was before immortall, he then became mortall, and ſubiecte to vnquietneſſe, in place of peace, to calamitie and miſerie, in place of all proſperitie, for ſo ſaith the holy Moſes: bicauſe thou haſtMan is abaſed through ſynne. heard the voice of thy wife, and haſte eaten of the tree, whereof I forbadde thee, that thou ſhouldeſt eate, curſed is the yearth for thy worke, in labour thou ſhall eate of it, all the daies of thy life, thornes and thiſtelles, ſhall it bryng furthe to thee, and thou ſhalt eate the herbes of the yearth, and ſhalte eate thy bread, with the ſweate of thy browes, vntill thou returneſt to the ground, whence thou waſt taken, bicauſe thou art duſt, and ſhalt be turned into duſt again. Notwithſtandyng theſe, yet manne was not ſo abaſed, but that he knewe hymſelf, to be lord and preſident ouer all thynges, that be vpon the yearth.

But there were GiauntesGiauntes. vpō the yearth, yea, the mightier ſorte, and deſpiſers of God, wherefore the Poetes did not vnproperly faine, that thei aſſaulted heauen. Whiche a man maie alſo vnderſtand by the Philoſophiers, for although thei did not by plaine pretence, denounce warre againſt heauen, yet thei attempted to direct their thoughtes, &amp; vain ſtrength of mynde thitherward, as though it had been giuen thē, to ſell a manne cleane life, and to ſurpaſſe the ſecretes ofLucianus in dialogo de vitarum auctione. heauen, from the knowledge whereof, no man was further then thei.

                  lelie and wickedly. It falleth out therefore ſo, that no man muſt ſtaie at that honour, whiche he hath brought with hym, from his kynne and houſe, but ought by his own well doyng, to enlarge theſame, cōſidering, ye worthy fame is beautified, if it light in a worſhipfull houſe but it is no good proofe to ſaie, he is a gentleman borne,

ergo a worthy man, whereby it appeareth, that nothing is more diſworſhipfull, then to ſtaie worſhip onely, vpon a gentle blood, when he that ſo doeth, doeth not onely by actiue meanes, not encreaſe theſame▪ but by naughtines diſgraceth it. And to this foreſaid patrimonie of vertue, I ſaied, that manne naturally is prone and bent, if that by ill condicions, whiche haue ſo throughly ſettled them ſelues in hym, he were not miſguided. There muſte therefore bee ſome meanes deuiſed, accordyng to the whiche, as it were a childes leader, the life of manne ought to bee faſhioned, for the ſettyng out whereof, I will apply euery thyng in due place, as nere as I am able.

               Man therefore, naturally beyng cōmonable, ſtreight vpon his beginnyng, driueth at the ſocietie and communitie of life, wherein filthines of maners ſette aparte, he maie embrace vertue, profite others, and finde out ſome

But when men at the firſt, reſorted together ward, the hiſtories declare, that thei wandered, without any certain dwellyng place, from wood to wood, and denne to denne, and liued by acornes. Of whiche ſort Herodotus reporteth: there were a kynde of ſtraie Scithianes, whiche, what waie ſo euer their cattaill ſtraied for paſture, thither thei themſelues folowed, wherevpon thei call theim, Graſiers. And ſome dooe write, that in theſe new found Ilandes, the inhabitauntes liue like beaſtes. Afterward, cottages and caues forſaken (for ſuche perchaunce were their lodginges then) thei began to builde

               But when as, by reaſon of the greate encreaſe of mē,Why citees were builded. mo thynges were required, as neceſſarie to a ciuill life, and diſcipline: thei thought it good to builde citees, and to ſeke a more commodious habitacion (which we vſe to terme halfe of our life) whoſe enhabitauntes bee called citezens, bicauſe thei repaire together into a citee. Now this woorde Ciuitas in Latine, hath diuers ſignificatiōs.

                     bs in Latine, of Vrbus the crokyng of a Plough. For tholde fathers (as Marcus Varro hath left in writing) wer wont after the maner of Thetrurians, to appoincte out their citees thus: At a daie thought conuenient by their Sothſaiers, thei would yoke an ore and a cowe togither in a Plough, whiche had a Braſen

culter, the Cowe for religiō ſake, on the nearer ſide, and ſo coueryng their heades, with their gowne ſkirtes, caſtThe circuite of citees was wonte to be marked out with a plowe a furrowe, namyng the place whence thei digged, and trenched vp the moulde, a ditche or trenche, on the inſide wherof, thei erected their walles, that their citees might be fortified without, &amp; ſtrengthened, bothe with a ditche and a wall. Whiche Ouide in his booke, intituled de faſtis, doeth pretily in theſe twoo verſes deſcriue.
               
                  Then vp he rent a trenche with Plowe,
                  where he the walles would frame:
                  An oxe and cowe bothe white as ſnowe,
                  were yoked for the ſame.
               
               Whervpon it is the maner, that as citees appoincted out by the Plough, be thought to be builded, with a certain religiouſneſſe, ſo when thei be raced vp again, thei be as it wer prophaned, by the ouer rūnyng of a plough. Whiche thyng we read in writyng, that Scipio Africanus practiſed, vppon the high walles of Carthage, and Frederike the Emperour, ſurnamed Barbaroſſa, vpon Millaine, a citee of Lumbardie, whiche bothe wer laied flat with the grounde. Now ſeyng the citee, retcheth no farther then the walles, it is to bee vnderſtande, that, when wee giue and bequethe▪ by legacie to any, all our gooddes in the citee, that the lawe meaneth, all that isL.

Mannes pollicie therefore, did not onely builde citees, bicauſe thei be conuenient, for the leading of a ciuill life, but for a defence, againſt inuaſion of enemies &amp; rouers. Whervpon from the beginnyng, the walles were helde as holie,Walles holy whiche, who ſo raſhely in olde tyme paſt ouer, it coſt hym his head. For the whiche cauſe, we read in the Romaine

For RomulusRomulus wickedly ſlue his own brother. ſeyng it to be more profitable for hymſelf, to gouerne alone, then with any other, ſlue his brother, pretēding an honeſt cauſe, whiche was the walbreche, beyng in deede neither allowable, ne yet ſufficient. Bicauſe in common gouernement, nothyng is profitable, if it bee vnhoneſt, and contrary to vertue. This Citee we maie call, a ioynyngA materiall citee. togither of houſes, enuironed with walles, fitlie and commodiouſly erected, bothe for the leadyng of a ciuill life, and repellyng the inuaſions of enemies.
               Where note, that Cain builded in Eden, a countreyCaine builte the firſt citee liyng Eaſtward, the firſt citee, afterward named Babilon, and called it after the name of his ſonne Enoch, Enochia,Gene. iiii. &amp;. xi. as the holy Moſes witneſſeth, and Ioſephus alſo followyng hym in his firſte booke of his antiquities, where afterwarde Nembrothe fooliſhlie purpoſyng, to preuente the daunger of water, would haue builded a Toure, farre retchyng aboue mannes ſight, but by the confuſion of tongues, was let of his enterpriſe. Whereby it ſhould not ſeme to be true, as well nigh al ye Greke and Latine writers doe fable, that Cecrops builded the firſt citee, and named it after his owne name, Cecropia, whiche afterward was called Athens, vnleſſe you will alledge, that it was the firſt citee builded in Grece. But theſe thinges doe not ſo muche, belōg vnto our purpoſe, conſideryng it is inough for the place to knowe, that mā could not ſo conueniently, haue entred ſocietie of life, vnles he had had citees, as it were a ſchoolyng place, to learne vertue in. Therefore to ſaue our houſes, to ſaue our children and wiues, and finally, for the ſafetie of the whole common weale, Citees muſte neades haue been builded, for the defendyng of whoſe walles, it doeth ſtād vs in hande to fight, no leſſe then for our ſelues.
               Now the ſecond ſignification of Ciuitas, is when it betokeneth

the people, whereof the materiall citee doeth conſiſte, for whoſe behoufe it was firſt builded, and this kind of citee doe I moſt driue at, in this treatiſe. Which is no other thyng, but a number of men, coupled by the bonde of ſocietie and lawe, wherein thei bee trained vp, by a diſcipline of lawe and maners, one to dooe that is profitable to an other, and to liue well. Whereof is wrought that moſte comly frame, whiche we call a common weale. For a citee muſt ſo bee appoincted, that nothyng be lackyng, that maie appertaine to the preſeruacion therof, &amp; that is rekened neceſſary, for leadyng this our mortall life well, and honeſt vſyng this ſocietie, wherevnto nature inwardly hath addreſſed vs, whiche Ariſtotle alloweth for the beſt, as for whiche the aſſembles,In. i. Polit. repaires, and reſortes of men be reſerued.
               The commodities and vſe of this citee, Moſes, Lycurgus, Oraco, (whoſe lawes, bicauſe of their ſeuere orderyng of thynges, be ſaied to be written with blood) Zaleucus, Carōdas, Socrates, Plato, Ariſtotle, Panetius doe euidently teache, and all thei, whoſe chief care was, to ſet furthe and enlarge common weales, by their vertue, wiſedome, iudgemente, and good ordinaunces. Whiche vſe if it dooe at any tyme light emong vs, oneThe commoditees of a well ordered citee. will profite an other, quietnes of life ſhall enſue, it ſhall be eaſie to get our liuyng one by an other, lawes ſhalbe obeied, eche manne without force ſhall haue his owne, and nothyng ſhall bee doen to other, that we will not abide our ſelues. So ſaieth Tullie: Thei whiche ſurmountedIn orati. pro P. Seſtio. other in vertue, and excellencie of iudgement, perceiuyng the aptnes of mannes witte, and capacitie in learnyng, where thei liued ſcatteryng, gathered them togither into one place, and brake them from their ſauagenes, vnto Iuſtice and mildenes. Then thei encloſedCommon weales. with walles, weales (whiche bicauſe thei conteine the common profite, we call common) then aſſembles of mē, which afterward thei called citees, then ioinyng of houſes, whiche we call tounes, eſtabliſhed bothe by GOD and mannes lawe: by them were founde out. And ſo betwene

this decente kinde of life, and the other brutiſhe, there is no further difference, then in the one violēce, in thother right. The one of theſe we maie vſe, but bothe at one time we can not. Will ye haue violece? thā right is diſplaced, that is to ſaie, iudgements, whervpon al right is vpholden? Miſlike ye iudgementes? or doe ye barre thē all together: then nedes muſt violēce beare rule. Which matter he alſo vnder a pretie circumlocutiō, hath expreſſed in ye fourthe of his inuectiues, againſt Catiline, thus: This onely quarell of diſſention, hath been founde ſence the citee was firſte builded, wherein all mennes iudgementes, haue agreed togither in one, ſauyng ſuche, as ſeyng thei muſt nedes periſhe, had rather cum to naught with companie, then alone. Theſe men doe I alwaie excepte, and willingly ſequeſtrate from the reſt. But all other (good Lorde) how many in number, with what earneſt myndes, howe ſtoute courages doe thei agree, in defence of the honoure, and ſafegarde of their countrey. Whereby ye perceiue a certaine ſhadowe, or if ye liſt ſo rather to terme it, a certain viewe or ſhape of gentlenes, which by the towardnes of nature, we attain vnto by beyng in citees, wherein, as Socrates ſaith, we maie well ſay: this is mine, this is thine: wherin we ought ſo to deſire riches, yt the poore be not ouer laid nor oppreſſed butWealth with out couetuouſnes. we muſt ſeke welth to maintein a moderate port, and to releue the nedy, not to be occaſiō, either of couetuouſnes or pleaſure, wherby leſſe vnquietneſſe &amp; enuie ſhal ariſe.

                  ¶ The argument of the iiii Chapiter.
                  That common weales began, when men firſt entred ſocietie of life: and how we muſt be haue our ſelues therein, that it maie bee an other framyng bouſe of bleſſednes, then the Philoſophers teache.
               
               
                  BVT hauyng now drawen out plainly, or rather ſleightly ſet furthe, the forme of a common weale, next of all it commeth to hande, how therein one profiteth an other, whereby we do meaſure the weale, whiche we terme Common, a woorde more vſed, then vnderſtanded, yea, among ſuche as trauaile in the common weale. But for this poinct, we muſt firſt throughly knowe, what apperteineth to a citee, ere we medle with the orderyng of a common weale. Moreouer, twoo thingesHow farr we ought to ſeke for a priuate commoditie. muſt principally be conſidered in a citee: Firſt of all, that a man doe ſeke his owne commoditie honeſtly, and without any wrong to others, whiche doeth belong vnto priuate profite, whiche wee maie lawfully tender, ſo farre furthe as we doe not offende any lawe, or common ordinaunce of the citee, ſeyng, according to the Stoikes, and Marcus Tullius his opinion, we doe not accompte any thyng profitable, although it bee neuer ſo muche to our commoditie, vnleſſe it be honeſt, that is, vnleſſe it be anſwerable to vprightnes and goodneſſe, and to knit vp ſhortly, vnleſſe it doeth agree with the lawe, whiche reigneth amongeſt men.
               Secondly, we muſte haue a ſpeciall regarde, to thoſe thynges, wherevpon the common profite dependeth, and ſuche thynges doe we terme, publike or common, when as we doe not onely preferre honeſtie, before profite, butPublike wealth. alſo conſente vpon the common worſhip, and wealth of

the whole citee, with all ſtudie of minde, all endeuour to vertue. Whiche thyng none dooeth, but a good citezen, whō notwithſtandyng, we doe ſeuere from a good man, who as one paſſyng the reache of the common wealthe, for the loue that he beareth to vertue, doeth wel deſerue of mankinde.
               For he is called a ciuill manne, whiche is ſtudious toA ciuill man kepe the lawes and iudgementes, whiche ſo farre as he maie, will cōmit nothing, either amiſſe, or vnaduiſedly, whiche with his prouidence, religion, and fidelitie, will ſe to the weale, bothe in common, and ſeuerall to eche citezen,Ariſto. in. 3. Politicorū. whiche will obeie lawes, defende his countrey, kepe ciuill ordinaūces, and the league of mankinde, and finally, is ſkilfull to liue well according, to the ciuill vertues. And he is called a good man, whiche loueth honeſtieA good man. without dread, whiche ouercome with no calamitie, will yelde to fortune, deſireth nothyng, doeth nothyng, but with greate worſhip, accordyng vnto the appoinctment of equitie and goodnes, although he doe not chiefly bende his mynde, to the ende of a common weale.
               Now the citee thus ſtated, we muſt open ſome waie, wherby not onely that, whiche is commodious to euery particulare man, maie bee dooen, but alſo that, whiche doeth touche the common auailemente, and worſhip of the whole citee: whiche can not bee atchiued, without bothe excedyng greate iuſtice, and alſo greate fauour of theſame. Whiche thyng Lelius in Tullie, in the ſecond of his bookes of a common weale, talkyng with Scipio Aphricane, whiche vtterly deſtroied Carthage, with no leſſe learnyng then wiſedome, doeth proue, ouerthrowyng the opinion of ſuche men as helde, that it were not poſſible to rule a citee, without doyng wrong. For ſeingSpartianus in Adriano the common weale, is the whole peoples weale,

                  For I doe not call euery aſſemble of men, people, but ſuche as be vnited togither, by agrement of lawe, and participacion of profite, whiche without iuſtice, the leader and rule of all vertues, will neuer come to paſſe. So that ſainct Auguſtine hymſelf, doeth allowe the wealth,

Let therefore all the Philoſophers, all Lawmakers, all nacions, be thei neuer ſo many, conceiue the frame of a citee, faſhion it with ordinaunces, fence it with lawes, decke it with iudgementes, if thei doe not ſeke in it, that Iuſtice and onely quickſet, whiche is Chriſte, thei ſhall haue onely the ſhadowe of a citee, like theim that ſet a faire white colour vpon a ſepulchre, whiche outwardly ſemeth gorgious, but with in it is full of rotten, and vile ſtinkyng carcaſes. Whervpō it cometh to paſſe, that we maie not arrogate to our ſelues the name of any, either ciuill or chriſtian common weale, vnleſſe it be mainteined by ſoche, as bee giuen to godlines, whiche doe worſhip and call vpon God. As for the ciuill, if it had euer been to be founde, the RomainesThe Romaines common weale corrupted. might haue chalenged it vnto theimſelues. But Tullie bewaileth it in his tyme, as bendyng to decaie already, by reaſon of naughtie condicions, in the firſt of his bookes of a common weale, recityng this verſe of Ennius.
               
                  The worthie common weale of Roome did floriſhe and encreaſe:
                  when cuſtomes olde, and auncient men, maintained it in peace.
               
               Whiche ſaiyng he wondereth at, as ſpoken by an Oracle: for neither the menne, vnleſſe the citee had been ſo manered, ne yet the maners, vnleſſe thoſe men had gouerned it, could either at the firſte haue grounded, or ſo long haue kepte that common weale, beyng ſo greate,

and orderyng thynges ſo iuſtly, and dominatyng ſo largely. Therfore before our time, bothe the cuſtome of our countrey, receiued worthie men, and worthy men helde in vre, the maner and cuſtome of our auncetours and elders. But our tyme receiuyng the common weale, as an excellente picture, but fadyng and loſyng the beautie therof: for age did not onely neglecte, to renewe it again with thoſe colours, whiche it before had, but did not ſo muche as kepe the verie forme, and outward lineamentes thereof. Ye heare what Tullie miſliked in the Romaine common weale in his daies: what if he ſhould ſeeCōmon weales bewailed, for their abuſes. ours, which now decaie, and haue long tyme growen to ruin. Wherin for ſcarcitie of mē, good maners be vtterli neglected: euery place is full of ſedicion, ſenſualitie, vniuſtice, couetuouſnes, &amp; all maner of miſliuyng. Would he not furthwith crie out, that there were nothyng leſſe in our cōmon weales thus abuſed, then any poinct of cō
                  mon weales? all whiche thynges doe make, that the inſtitucion of a common weale, whiche becometh the chriſtian people, is through forgetfulnes, as it were worne out: for that there is no where, any hoenſtie of maners, any diſcipline, any obediēce of lawes, any reuerēce, any loue of vertue, any defence of godlines, ſo that we cānot ſe ſo muche, as the ſhadowe of a common weale, muche leſſe of a perfecte common weale, and that whiche maie become the people of Chriſt.
               Neuertheleſſe, we muſt do our endeuour to amende, and recouer that is corrupte and deſtroied, by our vicious and vngodly liuyng. For the euerlaſtyng God, whicheOur commō weales muſt be reſtored in honeſt orders willeth not that manne ſhould die, but liue, dooeth ſtirre vp good menne, whiche loue iuſtice and religion, whiche doe gather companies of men togither, and doe well enſtructe theim, and ceaſe not to preſerue the ſame,The commō weale is mainteined by godlie men. in the loue of godlines. That ſo the common weale, whiche is no more the peoples, but Gods, maie be preſerued although not in the whole multitude, which for the moſt part, vſeth to walke in the beaten waie, and that whiche leadeth to the left hande, yet in theim, whiche God hath

electe as his owne people, who alſo dooe tender his commaundementes. Wherevpon naughtie men, although not all, yet ſome of theim ſhall take enſample of better life, and declinyng from iniquitie, ſhall worke good, and call vpon the name of God, with a ſincere harte: for God willeth not the death of a ſynner, but rather that he bee conuerted and liue. For to this ende we bee taught, that deniyng vngodlines, and ſeculare buſines, as S. PauleTit. ii. ſaieth, we maie liue in this worlde ſoberly, rightuouſly, and godly, lokyng for bleſſed hope, and the glorious cō

               Whereby it appeareth, that people to be the folower of good workes, and acceptable to God, which by Chriſt was clenſed and redemed: whiche onely can glorifie his creatour, and looke for the bleſſed hope of euerlaſtyng life. And therefore we liue iuſtly in this world, and kepe the communitie among men, coupled bothe by Goddes lawe, and mannes, whiche is the true forme, and inſtitution of a common weale, and publike eſtate. Whiche,A true definition of a cōmon weale therefore it ſhall be conuenient to our purpoſe to define, thus: An aſſemble, and repaire of men lawfully gathered, to liue well and bleſſedly, that beyng therunto godly brought vp, thei maie looke for euerlaſtyng life. For ſo maie it come to paſſe, that although there be many citees, and eche of thē vſyng their owne rightes, and maners, yet the forme of the common weale is but one, not that, according to whiche, Ariſtotle appoincted alſo one,i. Polit. after the forme of a ciuill eſtate, whoſe drifte and entent is onely, to his owne ende, but that whiche commeth of that builder, maſter and auctour of all good life: whiche ſaieth, I am the waie, the trueth and life. No man commeth vnto the father, but by me. In the whiche commonIoan. xiiii. weale, as a ſhapyng houſe of all vertue, we muſt be prepared, to a better life, whiche is the heauenly, and appoincted vs from the beginnyng of the worlde, that from

               Therefore, as there is one maſter, one moderatour of our common weale, and one head: ſo we cal that properlyOne commō weale hath many mēbres one common weale, wherein, how many partes ſo euer thei be, how many citizens, euery of them continue in their duetie: and one beareth an others burden, and alwaie goeth forward to help hym. So ſaieth S. Paule,Rom. xii. for as in one body we haue many partes, and euery part hath not one office, ſo we beyng many, be but one body in Chriſte, and eche one hath partes and members togethers, hauyng diuerſe giftes, accordyng to the grace giuen vnto vs. So thoſe, whiche are in this commō weale, thinke all one, euery man cōtēt with his own office, he yt can comfort the poore with his riches and goods, ought to doe it cherely.

                  ¶ The argument of the. v. Chapiter.
                  That a citee ought ſo to be appoincted, that none be lefte idle therein, but euery man taxed to doe his duetie, whereby it maie cauſe as it were an harmonie, or an agreable note of thynges, of it ſelf.

Therefore I a priſonerEphe. iiii. in the Lorde, doe exhort you, to walke worthy the vocation, wherevnto ye be called with all humilitie and lowlines, with long ſufferyng, one bearyng with an other in charitie, labouryng to kepe the vnitie of the ſpirite, in the bande of peace. So good a thyng, ſo holy, andEuery man oughte to occupte himſelf in the vocation whervnto he is called. ſo pleaſaunt to God is it, that euery man abide in his vocation, whervnto he is receiued, with all ſubmiſſion. For ſo ſhall it bee, that of thoſe vnlike doynges of euery citezen, in particulare and ſundrie kindes of life, brought into one concord, by a certaine agreable meanes, and vniforme order, a moſte ſwete harmonie of ciuill agrement ſhal be occaſioned, whiche alſo ſhall repreſent the image of the heauenly, cōtinuyng and kepyng vnſhaken, bothe the likenes, and alſo the vnityng togither of manly ciuilitie. Whiche order, either troubled or diſſolued, it ſhall not go forwarde, muche leſſe ought it to be called a common weale, bicauſe it is not direct to her owne ende, but rather a cluſteryng of ſuche a companie, as labouryng

in vain, doe not paſſe to offende their neighbour, and to diſpleaſe God.
               Thus a citee muſt no otherwiſe, then a certain comly frame be ioined together, not of one kinde of men alone, but of ſuche; as eche woorketh his owne, and is ready to helpe other with an vniforme agremente, to further the common weale.

               Therfore, the verie neceſſarie duetie of a Prince, andSapi. vii. aboue all other ordeined by God, is to rule and gouerne his people, which although he be naturally borne (for no euer kyng had any other beginnyng) and frō the beginnyng hath obteined the ſparcles, bothe of equitie and of a princelike courage, yet he muſte bee taught, and made fit for the gouernement, whiche he ſhall take vpon him, whereby he ſhall learne bothe to rule hymſelf, and to ouercome thoſe affections, whiche almoſte make a kyng naturally fierce, and knowe hymſelf to bee ſuche a man, in whom, yet no poinct of man muſt appeare, and thinke hymſelf appoincted a Prince ouer other, not onely to be kyng ouer them, but alſo to feade the people, committed to his charge, and to exhorte them to vertue, wherein eſpecially he muſt hymſelf trauaile, to ſurmount the reſt.
               For as Paterculus writeth, a good Prince teachethLib. ii. hiſto.

Seneca calleth the Prince, the ſoule of his cōmon weale accordyng to whoſe life and mouyng, it bothe liueth and

For performaunce whereof, he muſt not reſt at any one vertue, but ioyne altogether, that he bee, valtaunt, chaiſte, ſtoute, liberall, modeſt, gentle, princelike,Princelike giftes. free, ſober, godly, rightuous, and ſo in all other vertues, whiche be required in a noble gouernours life. Of whiche you maie ſomwhat read in Xenophō, in the training vp of Cyrus: in Plinic in his Panegyricque, vnto the Emperour Traiane, in Agapetus a Deacon of Roome, in his preceptine ſentences, vnto the Emperour Iuſtiniane, of the duetie of a kyng (whiche booke is therefore called the kynges tables) and other matters of this diſcipline.

For ſo ſhall he doe his duetie well, ſo ſhall he builde and edifie all thinges, to the glorie of God, ſo ſhall he not onely here in yearth, receiue honour due to a kyng, but in recompence of his watchyng and endeuour, he ſhall receiue an immortalle reward, to be placed emong the nomber of the holy ſainctes.

               Howbeit, no manne is ſo ignoraunt, but he knoweth that the prince is a man, and ſomtyme miſledde, whoſe fall is the occaſion of ſo muche the more harme, the more in ſight his eſtate is emongeſt menne.

               But when the Prince hath been well trained vp, it is hard to kepe hym to doe his duetie, and ſo muche the harder, the more occaſiions he hath to bee ſeduced, ſo that it ſeameth verie well ſaied, that good princes bee ſo fewe, that thei maie all be wellnigh ſhut in one ring. For the greatnes of their libertie, and knowledge that thei ſhall not be puniſhed, cauſeth theim, either not to heare good counſaill, or to contempne it, and to go forwarde in doyng euill. Herevpon commeth it, that ſome princes be ſo rauiſhed with the fonde deſire of huntyng, that thei can not be kept, frō euer beyng in the woodes, or be ſo giuen

               Then naughtie courtiers, doe corrupt a good prince, and make hym to forſake the waie of rightuouſneſſe, as Vopiſeus writeth in Aurelianus his life: Theſe thingesCauſes of euill princes. make euill Princes: firſte of all to muche libertie, then wealth of thinges, thirdly naughtie frendes, a vile gard, courtiers either fooliſhe or deteſtable.

But one edgeth hym to moue warre, and that vppon no occaſion, for hereby thinketh he to be enriched, though his Prince leſe ſome parte of his landes. I neede not to make mention of innocente bloud, whiche muſt be thereby ſhedde. An other counſaileth hym earneſtly, when he hath miſpente his goodes, to charge his ſubiectes with ſome exactiō of money, or Tares▪ intolerable to theim, but perchaunce not altogether hurtfull to hymſelf. Some, yea, though the Princes bee thereto vnwillyng, thinke it beſt, to breake couenaunt with their creditours, neither to ſtande vnto ſuche licences, as thei haue graunted, and if thei obteine this, thei thinke it a greate vertue. Hereby enſueth it that the people aliene their myndes from their Princes, beginne to miſtruſte, and fall to rebellion, ſo that it ſhall

not neade to ſeke any forrein enemies, conſidering there maie be eaſely found enough, euen within the very walles, through occaſion of the yoke of bondage, wherewith thei be preſſed.

Now therefore ye kinges vnderſtande, and bee inſtructe you that iudge the yearth, leaſt your honour be tourned into reproche, and your throne into ignominie, remember you muſt looke for the greate daie of the Lorde, wherein you muſt make an accompt, how you haue gouerned your Princely ſtewardſhip, and that you, which now iudge, ſhall then be iudged with a iudgement as it is iuſt, ſo vnpoſſible to be auoided. And no leſſe ſtreightly ſhall it happē to the people, whiche hath a kyng after their owne harte. And for that thei be plagued, &amp; rigorouſly handled, their offence moueth God to ſe it reuenged. Therfore, ſo we ought to liue in y• cōmon weale, that he which hath the gouernement,

rule in ſuche wiſe, that he thinke his function to be Gods, not his owne: that be whiche obeieth dooe it ſincerely, and that bothe doe agree to aduaunce the common wealth, and ſeke the onely glorie of God.
            
            
               
                  ¶The argument of the. iii. Chapiter.
                  That the Prince in gouernement of the common weale must haue thaſsistaunce of others, and what maner of men thei must bee.
               
               
                  HOw moche the higher powers dooeThe office of a Prince is large. ſurmounte and excell other men (as whom the ſcripture doeth ſomtyme call Goddes, as who ſate, benefactours of men) ſo moche the greater is the office, wherevnto thei bee appoincted: for it is the duetie of a gouernor, to reare vp that is decaied, to gather together that is diſperſed, to recouer the loſt, to reforme the miſordered, to puniſhe the euill, to enlarge the common weale, to releue the poore, to defende the orphane and widowe, to promote vertue, to miniſter iuſtice, to kepe the lawe, to ſhewe hymſelf father of his countrie, to holde the people cōmitted vnto hym, as his owne children, to embrace godlineſſe, faithfully and with his whole hart, to performe all that is profitable, or nedefull among the people, accordyng to his duetie, no leſſe then if God hymſelf were in preſence. Neither can a prince cloke or colour hymſelf in any poinct, or alledge any pretenced excuſe of his diſabilitie, or that he is occupied with other affaires. For he is ſoche a one, asIt becometh a kyng to heare all mens iutes neither, maie alledge any ſtaie, ne yet ſurmiſe any fained excuſe. He muſt tender all men, heare all men, bee thei iuſte or vniuſt, accordyng vnto the ſaiyng of Chilo: the kyng heard all matters, were thei right, were thei wrong. And touchyng this matter, there is a famous aunſwere of a certaine woman: for a poore olde woman beſought Philippe the Kyng of Macedonia,

to bee gracious to her in her ſute: but he made an excuſe, that he had no leaſure to heare her, then ſaid ſhe, verie aptlie: be then no longer kyng. But the Emperour Alexander was moche more praiſe worthie, whiche ſtaied all his traine on horſebacke, gentlie to heare a poore womans complainte. Whiche enſamples bee therefore to bee noted, that we maie thereby knowe, how God alwaie reiſeth vp ſome, to preſerue the ſocietie of man, and to profite the common eſtate, yea, and that amongeſt the Gentiles. And ſecondly, how ſincerely he would haue thinges dooen: ſo that he, whiche (beyng exalted to thonour of a kyng) when the crouneHynges were wōt to weare a wreath of cloth in ſteede of a croune. was offered hym, ſaied verie well: O noble clothe, whiche who ſo well conſidereth, would not ſo moche as take thee vp from the grounde.
               Whereby it appeareth, that a prince muſt be euery man, as the prouerbe is, becommyng all to all, to doe his duetie toward all, and to ſhewe the waie of vertue to all, which without the aide and aſſiſtaunce of other, ſpecially in a greate nomber of people, he can not doe alone, but he muſte needes ioyne vnto hym, good and goodly menne, with whom he maie execute his office throughly. Hetherto y• ſaiyng of Ariſtotle maie be referred:i. Polit. Eraſ. i. chili. that kinges haue many eares, and many iyes. And alſo an other ſaith (alludyng to the former reaſō) kinges haue long handes. As who ſhould ſaie, princes nede many mennes helpe, to looke to all, and to let no thing paſſe, that toucheth their duetie. Wherevpon I thinke it hath growne in vſe in Courtes, that Princes in their letters, anſweres, and other their actes, do vſe to ſpeake in the plurall nomber: rather to declare, that thei doe it by coūſaill, then ſekyng by ſoche forme of ſpeache any honour. So Aelius Spartianus dooeth reporte, that Adriane the Emperour, when he ſate in iudgement, had ioyned with hym, not onely his frendes and companiōs, but alſo Iulius Celſus, Saluius Iulianus, Neratius Priſcus, and other Lawiers, and

yet none other then the counſaill had allowed. Wee reade alſo in Chronicles, that Alexaunder Seuerus, neuer gaue anſwere, but by counſaill of others, which had (as Lampridius writeth) no leſſe then twentie of the graueſt Lawiers of his counſaill, amongeſt whomThe counſailours of Adrianus and Alexander. he rekeneth vp Fabius Sabinus, Cato, that flouriſhed in his time, Domitius Vlpianus, Pomponius, Alphenus, Calliſtratus, Venuleius, and other worthy learned counſailers of the Ciuill Lawe, ſcholers vnto the famous Lawier Papiniane.
               Now, ſoche muſte bee called to be of the counſaill (a thing bothe verie precious, and marueilous holie) and ſoche muſt bee ioyned in part of gouernement, as bee knowen to be wiſe men, louers of the truth, vertuous and that dread God: Not coueteous, no flatterers, butWoorthie counſailoues. ſoche as will giue no counſaill but honeſt, and profitable to the common weale: to whom Iuſtice, the onelie ſtaie of kyngdoms and worldly thinges, is dearer then their eyes, yea, then their verie liues. Theſe bee thei that can bring an euill Prince into the true waie, and make him good, ſtabliſhe the people and ciuill ſocietie, ſe that euery man haue his own. Theſe be thei whomExod. xvii

                   Moſes was commaunded to appoinct ouer the people, in this ſort: Prouide thy ſelf from amongeſt al the people wiſe men, and ſoche as feare God, in whom there is trueth, that hate coueteouſnes, and maie iudge the people at all tymes. &amp;c. If thou dooeſt this, thou ſhalte fulfill the Lordes commaundement, and kepe his preceptes. Whiche when he had heard, Moſes did all as he had aduiſed hym, and choſyng certaine ſtoute men out of all Iſrael, appoincted theim Princes of the people, capitaines of Tribes, hundredes, fiftie, and tenne men, whiche Iudged the people of God at all tymes, Iudgyng them ſelues onely the light matters, and teferryng the more weightie to his deciſion.

So fatte is he thought to bee vnwiſe, whiche is not wiſe to hymſelf, and hateth not ſoche thinges as be vnſeamly, accordyng to the notable ſaiyng of Alexander: I hate that wiſe man, whiche is not wiſe to hymſelf. Whiche thinges, if thei were ſet before our Princes iyes, more iuſtice and truth, and leſſe flatterie ſhould reigne in their courtes.

For although that naturally there be certaine principles of equitie and vertue laied in man: yet onely practice ſtirreth them vp, and declareth how one is borne for the furtheraunce of an other▪ then it is not to bee thought that we bee borne either hauyng already vertue or knowlege, but thei muſt be obteined by learned inſtruction, experience, and by the obſeruacion of other mennes liuynges. So that the Philoſopher may ſeme not farre out of the waye, whoſe opinion is, that mans minde is like vnto a ſmooth table wherein nothing is painted, and yet it is apte to receiue any kinde of colour. Therefore after Platoes counſail, it is expedient

that he who muſte be a Spectacle to the worlde, ſhoulde from the very beginning of his youth be committedThe education of a good prince. to a teacher, whiche is not onely noted for vertues, vprightneſſe of liuyng, and knowledge of learninge, but hath alſo the experience of many thinges, to the intent he maie winne good learnynge, and the waie of good liuyng, with trauaile in foraine affaires and ſo from the verye tendernes of infancye begin to frame him that ſhal take vpon him thoffice of gouernmente. Concernyng whiche matter, there is in Aulus Gellius an Epiſtle (an excellente exhortacion forLi, ix. ca. iii. the carefull and diligent bringyng vp of youth) which Philip the kinge of Macedonie wrote vnto the Philoſopher Ariſtotle, wherein he declareth that for hys childes birthe he muche thanked God, but not ſo much for his birthe, as that it was his chaunce to be borne in his daies, hopynge that being trained and brought vp vnder him, he ſhould proue worthye bothe him his father, and the ſucceſſion of ſo high an eſtate, whiche is asmuch to ſaie, as Alexander had his beginnyng of life of Phillip his father, but he muſt learne the waye to liue well at Ariſtotle.

Whiche thing, although it were doen deliberatly, yet it profited hym nothyng: for it fortuned hym to choſe that whiche was filled with ſtones. Whiche thynge maie be a certain argument, to impute princes benefites rather to fortune, then any greate affection or iudgemente.

                  I Haue ſomewhat declared howe expedient a thing it is, that ſuch as he about princes be good and Godly, where at they maie take the rule of their life (which al men vſe to marke none otherwiſe, then they beholde their face in a lokynge Glaſſe,) that thereby throughe example of their daiely conuerſacion, they maie learne and vnderſtande to do that is beſt, and to eſchew that is contrary. For with the good thou ſhalt be good, &amp; with the noughtie thou ſhalt be naughtie, which is ſo true, that it behoueth euē their very wordes to be honeſt and chaſte, leaſt the minde conſente thereunto, and ſo be enfected: for euill talke vſeth to corrupt good maners, as Menander ſaieth. Whiche thing Sainte Paule alſo reciteth thus: Ill conuerſationi. Cor. xv. hurteth good maners. And like man like talke: and that not without a cauſe, ſeing talke is a ſignificationSpeache is a repreſentation of the minde. of the minde. Therefore Socrates whō they report to haue called Philoſophie, &amp; the diſcipline of maners, euen out of heauen: ſaied vnto a yonge man, whoſe towardenes he was requeſted to learne: Speake that I maie ſee thee: meanyng hereby that mannes minde might rather be knowen by his communication, then by anye view of his countenaunce.
               
                  But for ſo much as kingdomes and dominions be geuen to kynges &amp; potentates, ouer whiche they haue rule, neither can they alone rule all, neither be preſent eche where, they muſt nedes do that by puttyng other in truſt: for it is better to do a thing by a deputie, thenOfficers. quite to leaue it vndone, or to attempt it out of tyme, and ſo geue occaſion of ſome vnrecouerable harme. And hereby is it meant when we do ſaie, that kinges haue manye eies, and longe handes. From whence it dothe not much diſagree, that is in the common prouerbe ſo much bruted, A great birde, muſt haue a wide neaſt. But theſe muſt alſo be of good cōuerſation, and loue honeſtie, that they bothe maie in their offices do their Princes honour, and alſo be nothing heauye to the ſubiectes. For an Officiall, or one that beareth office,Officialis. is called ſo of (Officium) which the Grekes do call (To cathecon) as who ſaie, that belongeth to vs to doe.3. de finibus bo. &amp; mal. And that dooeth Marcus Tullius call duetie, whiche when it is done, we maie geue a good reaſon whye it is done, and this kinde of duetie hath place in the common weale. Therefore whatſoeuer is done by officials or deputies in the whole kingdome and dominiō, that muſt be vprightly and well done, ſo that it doe agree with place, time, the thinge whiche ought to bee done, the ſubiectes, the deputies office, and the honour of the high magiſtrate. Whereby it ſhalbe occaſioned, that ſuch thinges as be due to the officer, ſhal be well preſerued, and the ſubiectes ſhall with all officiouſnes performe and do that is their duetie, ſo acknowledging the maieſtie of him that is in office, that they ſhall reuerence euen a ſtaffe if he dooe ſet it vp before theim. Whereof take this as an example: Amaſis the king ofAmaſis the king of the Egyptians. the Egyptians, which neither came of royal bloud, ne yet had any memoriall of his auncetours, but being of a baſe degree was elected to the kingdome: For which thinges when as ſundrie men did contemne him, he bethought him ſelf howe he might couer this belmiſh

and wittely bringe him ſelfe in reputacion among the rude people. There was amongeſt the kinges plate a Baſen of golde, wherein after his countrey faſhion, hee and his ghe

                  es after meate were wonte to waſhe their feete, whiche he alſo ſometime vſed in place of a chamber potte, as ſome haue vſed Emeraude bowles for the ſame purpoſe. This Baſen did he breake, and of it made an Image of an ydole, and ſette it vp in the middeſt of the market place to be worſhipped of the Egyptians, which they did very reuerentlye. Which thinge when it was reported vnto the king, he aſſembled all the people together, and tolde them the whole matter howe it was, that this ymage which they ſo highlye honoured, was made of that Baſen wherein he was wont to waſhe his fete, piſſe, and vomite, and to put it to ſuch like kinde of vncleanely vſes. And ſo ſhould they thinke of him, who althoughe he was but of baſe birthe, yet he was their kinge, and worthye to be reuerenced with due honour.
               They that be vnder Officers, deputies, or haue the adminiſtracion of ſome other officer, muſt be circumſpect, that they faile not in their duties, nor dooe anye thing wrongfully. But they muſt eſpecially take hede that they do neither take bribes, ne yet ſuffer them ſelues to be ſeduced by corruption of ambicion. For the roume that they ſupplye is not mans, but Gods committed vnto the adminiſtracion of manne, and their eſtate is ſo much the ſtraighter, becauſe they be not onely compelled to geue an accompt of their ſtewardſhip to god, but alſo to the prince or magiſtrate, vnder whō they be appointed to beare office, which ſhall alſo anſwerePrinces ought to bee circumſpect in the appoinctyng of officers. for that whiche is done euill, becauſe he did not appoinct a conuenient man to be his deputie, and ſuffred his people to take harme, ſpecially by him whom he knew to be an hirelyng, and reatchles in the office of feadyng. It is like, as if a ſhepeheard, when he hath ſheepe committed to his charge, while hee gathereth

What ſhall ſtaye the Lord of theſe ſhepe, but that he may examine therefore bothe the hirelyng, and the ſhepeherd him ſelfe, and call them bothe to accompt for the loſſe he hath ſuſteined, that if thone can not make amendes, the other ſhall make it good, and abye for his negligence, as reaſon and iuſtice requireth.
               There be alſo ſundry other thinges, whiche maye warne them of their duties, and cauſe them that they do not go aſtray, ſeing they be appointed ouer a whole people, and manie: of whom they can not deſerue all in like, as among whom there are ſo many mindes as heades. And vnleſſe thei haue before their eies the perfect rule of adminiſtration, I meane the lawe, temperaunce,It is a daungerous thing that officers ſhold be fauty. iuſtice, and equitie, after whiche they may direct all the order of their gouornement, whereby they ſhall not onely be deliuered from the ſtaine of errour, iniquitie, &amp; naughtines, but alſo ſhall be without ſuſpicion thereof, there will alwaye be ſome, that ſhall finde fault with their doinges be they neuer ſo honeſt, neuer ſo vpright, &amp; vnknowyng to them, accuſe them to the heade officer, and thereby brynge theim out of fauour. For Princes be men, and eaſely will be brought to ſuſpect other mennes doinges, for ſo muche as they be very deſierous thereof, and thinke in a greate glorye to cloke their owne fault by the calamitie of others, and will not ſticke at the complaint of one that hath bene euill handeled to put a man from his office, and to wipe him cleane of all his goodes.
               Whiche thinge deputies and vnder officers in our time do not weye, whiche neither knowyng mannes nor yet Gods lawe, do neither conſider any percell of equitie, ne yet of Godlines, but onely ſeke how to circumuent the pore comminaltie, how to ouerlay them

                  The argument of the .iii. Chapter.
                   That the maner of gouernyng commen weales, dothe not alwaies belonge to one eſtate, but yet hath alway reſpect to one ende.
               
               
                  THe examples bothe of olde and late maye declare that there bee diuers maners of gouernementes in common weales, and ſpeciallye of the citie of Rome, which becauſe it was of ſo greate power, could not haue theſtate of her common weale with out chaunge, but oftentymes fell into diuers kindes of rule, and thereby coulde not continue in the dignitieThe Romaine

cōmon weale, whereas it is not good to alter theſtate of wel a appointed cōmon weale. And therfore Auguſtus ſaid well, who ſo willeth not the preſent eſtate of the cōmon weale to be altered, is both a good Citezin, and alſo a good man. And this is that which AriſtotleIn. 2. polit. ſo earneſtly defendeth, that the lawes of a citie be not to be altered. As by whoſe chaunge, it muſt nedes enſue, that the ſtate whereof they bee the grounde and foundacion ſhall ſhrinke, whiche the Athenians did full well obſerue, appointynge certaine lawkepers, which in all commen counſels and aſſembles did ſitte crowned with white wrethes before the heade magiſtrates, &amp; encountred all attemptes againſt the lawes all ready eſtabliſhed. At Locrus a notable citie of theStrabo in. 6 geographie lib. Epizephirians, whiche firſte (as Strabo writeth) vſed certain written lawes, there was an order taken, that none ſhoulde be ſuffered to attempt renuynge of anye lawe, contrary to the auncient ordinaunces, vnleſſe he woulde venter his necke in a halter, to the ende that if it might ſeeme commodious to the common weale, he might eſcape: if not, he ſhould ſtraightway be ſtranguled with the ſame halter, the loope thereof beinge harde pulled together.
               Therefore the firme and vniforme order of gouernaunce maketh the eſtate to continue vnchaunged, which is the beſt and ſureſt in the beſt kinde of rule, as moſt cōmon weales do euidently declare. Although as men be now a daies minded, it be hard to kepe y• ſame, becauſe of the troubles of ſedicion, and intemperancyChaunge

Wherefore in default of a gouernour, ſome free cities vſe to take themperour or ſome other kinge or foraine prince for their defendour, whereby bothe the people maie be kept in awe, and they theim ſelues preſerued. Moreouer, in ſome common weales it hath bene an auncient cuſtome, that certaine of the baſe people, and brotherhodes of artificers ſhoulde be as aſſiſtantes to the counſailours, to ſo that nothinge

be called contrarie to the common profite of the Citezines, and lawes of the countrey, vnknowynge to the people, as the Tribunes were wonte to do among the Romayns. And as it marueilouſly furthereth concord and quietneſſe in a Citie, and as it were nouriſheth the ſame, that the common money, (ſo farre as belongeth to receites, and expences) be noted to the comminaltie: ſo where a fewe, were they neuer of ſo greate eſtimaciō, and deſerued neuer ſo wel of their countrey do the ſame after their owne willes, it ſtirreth greate troubles, and hath bene the vtter vndoing to ſundrye that peraduenture neuer offended. Therefore the wittieſt counſell that I can finde, is (for ſo much as accordyng to Tirence ſaiyng: ſundrye diet cauſeth ſundrye vſage, and eche daie hath inough for her owne euill,) for a ſeaſon to deferre thoſe thinges, which withoute great diſturbance can not be ſodenly altered.
               Therefore the adminiſtrations of common weales,Three kindes of gouernment as they be nowe adaies appointed, ſeeme to be mixed with the three kindes of gouernement, that is to ſaie: Monarchie, the beſt mennes rule, and the peoples guidyng. For ſo as it were one hande waſheth an other, and one man aideth an other, ſpecially in ſuch thinges as ought not to be hidde. For there be manye priuye thinges in Cities, and profitable in common, whiche muſt be committed but to fewe, whiche in this pointe ſo much commendeth and approueth the faithfulnes, dignitie, and honeſt behauiour of the officers, that thei
                     
                        〈◊〉
                      finders. be thereby voide of ſuſpicion. Albeit no man euer yet ſo ruled in the worlde, but he founde certaine felowmates, whiche would miſconſtre and finde fault with his doinges, whom, the clearer a mans conſcience is,The nature of good and il reporters. the ſoner he will deſpiſe. As for good mennes reporte, he neuer neadeth to caſt any ſuch feare. For good men alway take good thinges in good parte, and as Tullie ſaieth: The better a man is, the leſſe dooeth he ſuſpect other to be euill. Contrariwiſe, he that is euill,

can not ſpeake well of other, but meaſureth al menne by him ſelfe. And then ſaied Alexander the Macedonian, plaieſt thou the king in dede whē doing well, thou arte miſreported: neither yet ceaſeth God to preſerue his magiſtrate or miniſter, euen in the middeſt of all his trouble.
               Neither is it to be thought that it can naturallye come to paſſe that one common weale can abide the three eſtates, (I meane of one alone, of the beſt, and of the peoples gouernement,) as to haue ſo many particuler heades in it, whereof eche ſhall haue the aucthoritie: but a meaſure muſt be had, and eche regarde his own priuate charge. Of which thing we may take an example at this vniuerſal frame of the worlde, wherein the Philoſophers by all their ſearch, could not findeAriſto. in.

                   any more, but one Lorde and king. And as ſainct Auſten ſaieth: Plato did not thinke that there was anye moe Gods but one, the aucthour of al natures. Which thing a man may alſo ſee in Bees, which wil haue no moe kinges in their ſwarme but one, about whō they cluſter, whom they compaſſe in, and reuerence, (as Plinie full well teacheth in hid naturall hiſtorie.) Althoughe Ariſtotle ledde by ſome greater experience, thinketh that ſometime they do folowe diuers guides, whiche being altogether, do make the nomber of one ſwarme, whiche thing the Bee kepers, as I my ſelfe haue heard them oft times ſaie, do graunt: if ſo be that the hiues be able to receiue diuers ſwarmes.
               Therefore howe diuerſe ſo euer the eſtates of gouernours be, whiche rule in one common weale, yet their eyes muſt loke vpon one as chiefe in aucthoritie, to whō in weightie affaires thei muſt haue a recourſe as vnto a Moſes. So that in euerye well gouerned citie, none other thinge is to be loked for, but that wee with moſt quietnes that can be, being obedient to our ruler, (becauſe he is ordeined by God) do ſeke the common wealth, and the onely glory of God, whether the

rule be, gouerned by one as a king, by the better fort, by the mightier power, or ioyned with diuers and ſundrye. Whiche neither Ariſtotle him ſelfe dooeth in allIn. 3. polit. poinctes diſalow, but reaſoneth as though after a ſort it maie be accompted as one of the beſt rules in a common weale. For there is nothing ſo perilous, but if a manne vſe it well, it may be bothe quiet and ſafe: and contrariwiſe, there is nothing ſo good, but it ſhal haue wonderfull euill happe, if you do not ceaſe to abuſe it. Wherefore it lieth in vs to employ gouernement (althoughAbuſe. it be a difficult thinge,) either to a good or an euil ende.
            
            
               
                  The argument of the fourth booke.
                   That in a common weale it behoueth magiſtrates to paſſe other in vprightneſſe of life and maners, and to be fauourers of the aduauncement of the common profite.
               
               THe worthy Plato; (whoſe cō

But if he be vnprofitable and diſſolute, it ſtraightwaies lighteth vpon the Citizins, whom he infecteth and maketh much worſe, for ſo muche as a naughty Rauen can not but laye a naughty egge. Neither was there euer ſcholemaſter that made good ſcholers, who was him ſelfe vntemperate, and negligent in teachyng. Wherefore not euerye

                  ice, but muſt be choſen amongeſt ſuch as haue wel gouerned their owne houſhold. Like vnto him that will be a Superintendent of a church, which muſt be vnreprouable, deſierous of good thinges, one that hathe wel ruled his owne houſe, hath obedient children with all reuerence. So ſaieth the apoſtle Paule. A Biſhop muſt be without faulte, one that hath well gouernedi. Timo

                     . his owne houſe, hauyng his children in obediēce with all reuerence. But if a man can not tell howe to rule his owne houſe, how ſhall he rule the church of God? Moreouer, as a biſhop muſt teache not onely with his mouthe, but alſo with his holineſſe in life: ſo a magiſtrate ought not onely to ordeine and appoinct, but alſo in dede to perfourme that whiche is for the common profite. For it is a thing to be deſpiſed and vncomely, to reaſon of the diſcipline of good maners, or to appoinct a rule of good life, if a man be him ſelfe naughtie, and of a vicious liuyng. Whom Diogenes Cinicus likeneth vnto a Lute, whiche deliteth other wyth the ſwetenes of her ſtringes, but it ſelfe heareth nothing. But thapoſtle termeth them a ſounding braſſe,i. Cor. xiii. or a tinckelyng Cymball.
               Neither can it be but that citie ſhalbe kept in verye good order, wherein the officer letteth nothinge paſſe whiche maie appertaine to the honeſtie of maners, orMagiſtrated muſt haue deligent reſpect to the peoples behauiour. emplantyng of vertue.

                  And this it is whereof Marcus Tullius putteth vsD

One, that they ſo loke vnto the profite of the citezens, that they referre all their doinges thereunto, forgettyng their owne commodities. The other, to ſe to the whole bodie of the cōmon weale, that while they loke to one parte, they doe not ouerloke the reſt. And therefore it is the proper duetye of a magiſtrate to vnderſtand that he repreſenteth the ſtate of the whole citie, whoſe dignitie and worſhip he ought to ſuſteine, kepe lawes, appoint ordinaunces, and remember that they be committed vnto his charge.
               Moreouer, a cōmon weale, wherein the magiſtrate doeth as it were frō a watch tower behold the citizens maners, and doeth not neglect well to frame the ſame, ſhall kepe euery poincte that is required in the principall common weale, that as Lacedemon was wonte, ſo it may be called a reuerent aſſemble, and repaire of good men, the ſhoppe and marte of al vertues, wherevnto all the Philoſophers diſputacions of vertues, of the diſcipline of maners, offices, and other prophane treatiſes muſt be referred, as it hath bene by a maruelous good reaſon alowed, although left in a ſhadowe, and in ſcholes: yet a tradicion worthy to be vttered abroade, and to ſhewe vnto men the vſe of the felicitie which it promiſeth.
            
            
               
                  The argument of the fift Chapter.
                   That it is the parte of a wiſe magiſtrate conuenientlie to prouide ſuch thinges as be neadefull for the Citezins to liue by, without any wrong done to others.
               
               
                  ALexander ſurnamed the greate, when he had welnere brought the whole world vnder his ſubiection, ledde forthe his armie, and being deſierous of immortalitie, purpoſed to builde a Citie, named after hys

owne name, and to furniſhe the ſame with inhabitantes. Whom Dynocrates a cunnyng builder of MacedoniaVitruuius de architectura. folowing, when he had faſhioned the mount Athos after the proporciō of a man, in whoſe left hande he figured the walles of a large citie, and in the right a cuppe to receiue the water iſſuinge out of all the riuers of that Hill, and ſo to conduct theim from it into the Sea: Alexander delighted in the fairenes of this purtraiture, by and by enquired, whether there were anye grounde about to furniſhe it with ſtore of corne: and findyng that it could not be maintened, but by cariage from beyonde the ſeas, ſaied: I do well marke (Dynocrates) the fine drawing forth of the platte, and am delighted therewith, but this do I withall marke, that if a man would plant any companie of menne in ſuche a place citie wiſe: the deuiſe will not bee liked. For as a yonge infant can not be nouriſhed wythout his nourſes milke: ſo neither can a citie, be it neuer ſo faire, encreaſe and maintaine any number of people, without groundes liyng thereunto for the bringynge forthe of fruites, yeldyng plenteous prouiſion for the ſuſtinaunce of the inhabitantes. And as I allowe the platteforme, ſo doe I diſallowe the place. And ſo leauing this worke vndone, he folowed the king into Egypt, whiche there perceiuynge an hauen naturallye fortified, a goodly marte place, the fieldes throughout all Egipte to be of a batfull ſoyle, and the manifolde commodities of the great riuer Nilus, he commaundedAlexandria a citee in Egipt Dynocrates to builde a citie there, named Alexandria after his owne name.
               Wherby it is euident, that ſoche as builded tounes did not onely reſte vpon the faireneſſe of walles, and houſes: but prouided alſo, that thei might be ſet in ſoch a fertile place, wheras thei ſhould haue plētie of corne, abundaunce of victualle, the benefite of water, and all ſoche thinges, wherwith a citee ſhould be mainteined. Likewiſe, who ſeeth not that his iudgement, is to bee

miſſeliked, who ſo therefore thinketh a citee to ſtande well, bicauſe it is enuironed with walles and trenche, garniſhed with goodly buildynges, and ſituate in ſoch a place, whereas nothing wanteth, that can appertein vnto the health of the people: if it be not alſo inſtitute, framed and gouerned by ſuch lawes, ſuch diſcipline of maners, ſoche a kinde of rule, and that continuallie, that there maie bee the mutuall pleaſuryng of one an other, the ſocietie of life, the vſe of vertue, and that for whoſe cauſe the citie is builded, I meane the atteining of bleſſedneſſe, without whiche, you ſhall doe as thei,A faire citye yl ordred to like a painted tombe whiche doe paint a toumbe, wherewith the lokers on, dooe delight their iyes, whereas within is none other thing, but a ſtinkyng carcaſe.
               In whiche thing, I appoincted the magiſtrates officeMagiſtrates office. to be, that he tender not onelie, the floriſhyng ſtate of the whole citee, but alſo the priuate welth of euery man, and the very whole honor of the common weale, to be committed vnto hym, as by whom it ought to be ſupported and ſtaied. Therefore twoo thinges he ſhall obſerue: that whatſoeuer apperteineth vnto the furniture of meate. drinke, and clothē, or thē neceſſarie paſſyng ouer of life, that maie be eaſely gotten: Secondly that it be well beſtowed, and emploied to the glorie of God. This muſt be the whole ſōme and effecte of good gouernement, foraſmoche as the Magiſtrate muſt trauaile emong the citezeins, none otherwiſe, then emōg his owne childrēn, as whoſe wealth he muſt preferre, before his owne, and declare hymſelf, to be a father of his countrey. Which name none euer obteined emongeſt the Romains, vnleſſe he had marueslouſly wel deſeruedPater patriae of the common weale. For Cicero was ſo named, and ſo was Auguſtus Ceſar, whiche is reported to haue been ſo delighted therewith, that when Valerius Meſſala, by the counſaill and people of Romes commaundement, called hym father of his countrey, wepyng for verie ioye, he aunſwered: Sens that,

my Lordes, I haue obteined my deſire, what other thing haue I to requeſt at Goddes handes, but that I maie deſerue, that this your conſente maie continue, vntill my laſt ende.
               With ſoche a minde therefore euery manne muſte take vpon him the charge of the common weale, that he doe his endeuour, to preferre the publique affaires, before priuate, &amp; alwaie to haue that before his iyes, and to watche alone, when other doe ſlepe. But moreProuiſion of neceſſaries. &amp;c. diligently to repeate my former treatiſe, concernyng thinges priuately neceſſarie, there is no hope that the common weale can haue anye proſperous ſucceſſe, without the ſupportacion of priuate thinges, whiche hath as it were, the forme of a grounde whereupon the other muſt be eſtabliſhed. For what kinde of ſocietie ſhould that be, wherein one ſhould be compelled to bee hungrie, and he and his children, as it were, to ſtarue for famine (which is a wonderfull piteous caſe) either for want of thinges, wherewith the life ſhould be mainteined, or y• bicauſe of great dearth, thei cānot bee releiued: and an other hauynge his barnes full, ſhould liue at riot, or alone, as one hauing quicke vtteraunce of wares, ſhould ſticke vpon to moche gaine, oppreſſe the neadie, and ſeke his owne commoditie, to the vndoyng of other, contrary to the verie courſe of nature? In ſoche caſe is this common weale, as that houſhold, which will neuer thriue, ſo long as one daily ſwilleth, and kepeth reuell, an other pineth for lack of food: the good man of the houſe in the meane while either fallen as it were, into a ſlomber, or negligently looking to his familie. And although the cōmon ſaying bee, that he whiche entreth into an other mannes houſe, ſhould bee bothe domme and deaffe, yet no honeſt man could well beare with this inequalitie.
               Neither is there one onely waie, to atteine vnto the knowlege how a citee muſt be furniſhed with all neceſſaries, but good aduiſement muſt be vſed in all, according

to the conſideracion of the place, the men, the tyme, the yere. Bicauſe thus there is foreſight had, to the citezeins commoditie, neither yet be the ſellers endammaged. For no citee can ſtande, without mutuall trafficque, no companie of men bee mainteined, without prouiſiō, without open market for ſale of thinges, without the Shambles, and corne market, in whicheThinges muſt be ſold at a reaſonable price. poincte, if ſoche order bee taken, that Marchauntes or Fermours, bee compelled to ſell thinges, whiche they bring in, better cheape then reaſon is, and oftymes for leſſe then thei coſt them, that is to be eſchewed for two cauſes: Firſte, bicauſe the ſellers forſakyng the citee, ſhall ſeke an other market, where thei may vtter their wares, to their greater cōmoditie: Secondly, bicauſe that when thinges, for the daiely vſe of citees, bee not brought in, the citezeins in the meane while, be compelled to ſtande in neede, wherevpon occaſion is oftimes miniſtered to rebellion. Therefore it were better to ouerbuy thinges, that we muſt nedes haue, then to be altogether without them. And therfore, for the ſale and prices of thinges, ſoche order and rate muſt bee vſed, that it maie bee to eche part of the citee profitable, ſo ſhall it not harme other, but ſtaie vpon a conſcionable dealyng, that in buiyng and ſelling, there maie be on all ſides ſome equalitie, and vprightneſſe. Whiche none but a wiſeman, can bothe ordeine, and ſee put in prartiſe: and ſoche a one as in gouerning a citee, onely hath reſpecte to that, which ſwarueth not frō the rule of equitie. But that as it is preſently profitable, ſo in continuaūce, it will not be vnprofitable. For by long experience, ſoche a man hath tried, that the falling out of thinges (whiche is the ſcholemaſter to fooles) is not to bee looked at: but that thinges muſt be ſo foreſeen, that although thei be to come, yet by forecaſt and coū
                  ſaill, thei maie growe to good effecte.
               Moreouer) whiche thing muſt principally be conſidered) there is not one kinde onely, nor one trade of liuyng

in all citees. For ſome ſtand vpō the ſea coaſtes,Diuers Citees haue diuers meanes of prouiſion. which be moſte mainteined, by carriage in Shippes. Some ſtande vpon freſhe riuers, whiche yet be able to beare great veſſels, and be famous, by reaſon of ſome notable hauen. Some haue ſome great marte, and be enriched, by reaſon of merchaundiſe. Other ſome bee welthie by corne groūd, or vineyardes. Beſides theſe, ſome ſtande by handy craftes menne, whiche by other meanes prouide theim ſelues of corne: in this poincte not in very ill

               Wheras there be ſondry kindes of trades, wherby citees bee ſupported, I haue expreſſed but a fewe of ſet purpoſe, not touchyng the reſte, bicauſe my mynde is onely to declare him to doe verie vnwiſely, that ſhall appoinct one kinde of liuing to all theſe, whereby thei ſhall liue all after one ſorte: ſeeyng that thei, neither haue all one kinde of life, neither yet one waie in gettyng their liuynges, but in euery citee, conſideracion muſt be had of the life, condicion, maners, waie of getting, and ſoche like: and according as euery thing ſhal require, ſo muſt order bee taken, and a ciuill appoinctment eſtabliſhed. So Serbidius Sceuola warneth vs, to applie lawes vnto the nature of thinges, not thynges to the Lawes, whiche thyng Plutarche writeth, that Solon obſerued in the Atheniane cōmon weale.
            
            
               
                  The argument of the. vi. Chapiter.
                  Concernyng the ſhambles, prouiſion of eates, and victualyng houſes for the common vſe of the people, how thei ought ſpecially to bee looked vnto.
               
               
                  
                  NOw it is moſte expedient, that thoſe thinges, whiche we cannot lacke▪ for the maintenaūce of our life, ſhould bee brought to the market, &amp; be to be▪ had in a citee, where a nomber of people is: whiche is the occaſion, that the ciuill ſocietie maie bee knit together, and the dignitie of the common weale, encreaſe and continue: beſides that the people, when thei be full, be more deſirous of quietneſſe, then if thei doe not finde whereby to haue prouiſion, and helpe for their nouriſhmente. So Aurelian the Emperour writeth vnto Arabian his Purneigher, that the people of Rome be merieſt, whē thei be fulleſt. Wherfore thoſe thinges, muſte principally be cared for, whiche ſerue for the daily vſe of meate, and drinke: as for other thinges, whiche appertain vnto the riote of idle men, and their inordinate lauiſhing, there nedeth no like prouiſion, as without which, the people maie be nouriſhed, and the Citee well inough mainteined. Wherefore, Socrates, when his frende complained, that all thinges were deare at Athens, as Purple ſilkes, pearles, veniſon, and al kindes of nouelties, anſwered wiſely: there is no dearth, ſo long as meale and oile, neceſſary prouiſiō for

               But firſt of all, reſpect muſt he had for prouiſion ofProuiſion of corne. corne, that the inhabitauntes be not for lacke thereof compelled either to ſtande in diſtreſſe, or to chaunge their ſoile. And therefore common weales whoſe nū

be accuſtomed to laye vp corne bought with the common money, and thence when neade ſhall be, to ſell it good cheape, after the Romain vſage, whereby twoo lawes touching corne made by Sempronius, and Saturninus, corne was ſolde to the people after the rate of. vi. pence, and a greate a buſſhel, vntill that PubliusLawes for corne. Clodius made a lawe in his Tribuneſhip▪ that the people ſhould haue corne geuen them frely. The whiche as hurtefull to the Treaſurie, Marcus Octauius ſōne to Cneius, did abrogate, becauſe it ſemed that by geuing the people foode plentifully, and that without any trauaile, it might withdraw them from honeſt labour vnto idelnes, as Marcus Tullius witneſſeth.Cicero. in orat pro P. Seſtio &amp; li. 2. de officiis. What a marueylous charge this deuiſion of Corne was, which the Romains vſed to diſtribute monthlye in euery warde (and therupon tearmed it Menſtruum) as wel the quantitie thereof, as the number of menne which did receiue the ſame, will declare. For Plutarch in Ceſars life writeth, that the corne whiche monthly was deuided amongeſt the common people, coſt. v.Charge for prouiſion of corne among the Romaines. hundred and fiftie millions of their coine. Whiche by computacion after our reckening (as manie doe witneſſe) amounteth to fiue hundred and fiftie thouſande crownes. What a number it was to whom the deuiſion was made, Suctonius tranquillus in Ceſars life by theſe wordes declareth. He made recoumpte of the people, neither after the accuſtomed maner, nor place, but ſtrete by ſtrete, by the houſholders. And whereas there were wont to be three hundred and twentie. M. which had corne of the common prouiſion, he brought theim to one hundred and fiftie thouſande. Whiche I therfore haue mencioned that we ſhould take this as a preſident of a well appointed Citie, to the ende we may the better know the benefite of God, which gaue ſuſtinaunce to ſo greate a noumber of people: yea, and that in a citee geuen to the ſeruing of ydolles.

                  That ſoche lawes, as a citee muſt be gouerned by, ought to bee kept by all men, and that it is a thyng that giueth an hurtfull preſidente, if Magiſtrates doe offende againſt the ſame.
               
               
                  TO the ende therefore, the common weale maie bee firme, and not altered nor tranſpoſed, accordyng to euery mannes fancie: there muſt bee ſome order; for the gouerenmente therof, appointed by lawes. Whervnto we muſte haue recourſe, as to

our moſte ſure rule, or touch ſtone. Whereby we maie readily learne, whether a citee be well and ſemely adourned or not. Therefore Demoſthenes (as Marcian is aucthour) ſaieth, that the Lawe is a common ordinaunce of a citee, after whiche it behoueth all theim to liue, whiche bee in the citee, whiche Papinian calleth the common aſſuraunce of the citee.
               It furthereth moche, ſaieth Tullie, the wealth ofLibr.

                     . de Legibus. Citezeins, the ſafetie of Citees, and the quietneſſe and happineſſe of mannes life, to haue the ſame eſtabliſhed by lawes. Whoſe vertues be, to commaunde, to kepe vnder, to bidde, to forbidde. For it is the lawe onely, whiche commaundeth thinges that muſte bee doen, and forbiddeth, that is not to bee doen. Thus the lawe, is the rule and leader of a Ciuill life, whom theThe Lawe. Grekes doe call (nomos) for that it aſſigneth to euery man his owne, as who ſaie, a diſtributer. The Latines call it (Lex) whiche is as moche to ſaie, as a choiſe, bicauſe it is choſen and confirmed, by wiſemēnes conſent, as profitable in common.
               Whereby it doeth appere, that the ſocietie of menThe cauſe of making lawes was the firſt cauſe, why lawes wer made, whiche beyng ones begonne among menne, muſt nedes be ſtill preſerued by reaſon, as naturally engraffed in man, ſo appoincted by wiſe heades. Then afterwarde, for that, myne, and thine, beganne to breede vnquietneſſe amongeſt menne, queſtion began to be moued, concernyng ſeigniories, and dominions of thinges, whiche for the mainteinyng of vprightneſſe, and quietnes of a Citee, muſt nedes bee ordered by the rule of Iuſtice and equitie, ſo that thereby a greate part of the lawe, became proper to the Courtes, the reſidue, whiche appertaineth to the beautifiyng of good maners, and framyng of the common weale, was left in the citee, and ſchooles of Philoſophie.
               Now if this lawe be a thing made by the common conſent of a citee, whereby right and wrong be diſtinguiſhed,

it muſt nedes be applied to thinges accordingly:Lawes muſt
                        •
                      bee applied to the time, place, and people. and therfore Ariſtotle compareth it, to the Leſbiane rule, pliable to all meaſures, whiche thing lieth moſte vpon them, to whom the gouernment of the common weale is committed: whiche therefore muſte haue the ſtate of the tyme, the place, and menne, ſet before their iyes, that nothing be doen, by pretence of law againſt equitie, whiche the Grekes call (Epiichia) naturally engraffed in vs. And ſo it is in common affaires, as in ſore iyes, whiche muſte not haue all one medicine, but according vnto the diuers kindes of men and matters, a diuers kinde of temperature muſt be applied. For to moche frettyng of a ſore, rankeleth it, and prouoketh it to bleedyng: whiche Arte thei ought onely to exerciſe, that excell in wiſedome, equitie, iuſtice, and godlineſſe, and preferre the common, alwaie before the priuate profite, whiche thing as Plato ſaieth, linketh the common weale together. For thei knowe, what maie bee moſte profitablie doen in eche Citee, for moſte aduauntage, and that one Shooe is not meete for euery mannes foote. Whiche is the onely cauſe, that euery where thei vſe no written lawes, but in ſteade thereofCitees bee tuled by vnwritten lawes. in verie extremitie of thinges (the rigoure of the lawe ſet aparte) thei haue cuſtomes of Boroughes, brought in by old maners, vſages, and ſtatutes, moſte profitable for the gouernement of the common weale, the puniſhement of offenders, and defence of good men: and of no leſſe aucthoritie, then the written Lawe is, and that whiche is common to all menne. And here vpon ſaieth the Philoſopher, that euery citee is mainteined by nature, maners, and reaſon.
               But for ſo muche as a common weale is a certayne meane to ioygne men together in honeſtie of liuyng, grounded vpon lawes, which ought to touch the profite of al, and the common aduauncement: not the ſubiectes onely ought to obey the ſame, but alſo the magiſtrates, who haue no prerogatiue, but ſuche as is honeſt,

of it ſelfe, and profitable to all, whereby eche man hath his owne geuen vnto him, and others be not har med: As to whom thou art not permitted to doe, that thou wilt not haue done to thy ſelf. And therfore PlatoThe Magiſrate is in ſubiection to the lawe. did well ſaie, that ſuch a common weale muſt nedes decaye, whereas the magiſtrate ruleth the lawe, and not the lawe the magiſtrate. So Theodoſius and Valentinian the emperours in their decrees vſe a ſaying, worthy the maieſtie of a gouernour, that they confeſſe a prince bound to the lawes, and that it was a greater thing to ſubmit ſelgniourie to law, then to be a ruler. Then is not that true which certaine light and fonde flatterers doe beate into princes heades, that Domitius Vlpianus ſetteth a prince at ſuch libertie from lawes, as though he were not bounde to liue accordyng to their appointmente. Whereas he vſed to counſell Alexander Seuerus, one that was as it were a keper of recordes of lawes, farre otherwiſe. This it is that Claudianus counſelleth, and verie properlye writeth vnto Theodoſius in theſe verſes.
               
                  Thou repreſentes a Citizin, and parent of eche one:
                  See thou prouide for eche eſtate, and not for thee alone.

                  Submittethy ſelfe to thy beheſtes, and firſt obſerue thy vvill.
                  For then the people naught repines, but ſekes the rightfull vvaie,
                  Vvhen they the aucthour ſee of right, in right him ſelfe obey.

And thereby commeth it to paſſe that bothe the people do their duetie in obedience, and the magiſtrate executeth his office with a godly carefulneſſe, and by his vrightneſſe of his, ſheweth the right pathe of vertue, wher upon ariſeth that ioynyng of profites whiche doeth beſt ſupport a citie.

For this office is a common office, and it ought to ſuffer no delaies, but by geuyng to much libertie it corrupteth the people, which

None other wiſe then did the olde Diogenes, whiche with a light Candle in a greats aſſemble of people (euen at noone daies) ſought for a man.

Farre otherwiſe then Lycurgus did, which indented with the Athenians, that vnleſſe he him ſelfe reuoked his lawes, they ſhoulde continue for euer. And for the eſchewyng of perſwaſion to breake them, he willingly baniſhed him ſelfe, and ſo ſtrenghthened his lawes. But men of our time dooe farre contrarie, whiche althoughe they take in hande to eſtabliſhe the common weale by lawes, yet either they do bringe them to no effect, or be the firſt that breake them, and gene other occaſion to traunſgreſſe the ſame, whom thei be aſhamed

to puniſh, becauſe they firſt offended them ſelues, and ſticke in the ſame mire. For we know that in the moſt part of cities, and moſt dominions ere this, there haue bene moſt holeſome lawes publiſhed againſt aduouterers, dronkerdes, blaſphemers, whorehunters, vſurers, and other offenders, whiche be ſo common, that euen they of the churche winke at them, and will not ſe them puniſhed, which perchaunce haue pinched one or two of the baſer ſort, but if the execution of thē at any time hath fallen vpon them of the nobilitie, all is huſht, and they as hornettes throughe the SpidersHornettes. webbe paſſe their ways, and ſcape free: and ſuch haue bene the occaſion whye they haue not likewiſe taken place in other, to the greaſe decaye of the common weale.
            
            
               
                  The argument of the. viii. Chapter.

Where as he is verie vnmete to attempte the thing, whiche cannot by his meanes bee ſincerely practiſed. As XenocratesXenocrates. the Chalcedonian, a Platoniſte, whiche as Laercius

                  IT hath been declared, although but ſleightlie, by whoſe care, diligence, and labour we dooe ſo vpholde this felowlie life of man, that one maye by lawfull meanes, receiue cōmoditie by an other, and the common weale haue her fourme, to whom we adnered thoſe, that be of a priuate order, and the baſeſt in a Citee: yet appoinctyng the nomber of them greater, for whoſe behoofe we be conſtrained to take the more paines. For it is Goddes people, whom we ought ſo to feede, and kepe in doyng their dueties.

For in no kinde of thinge is there a better pollicye to ouercome the iniquitie of fortune, then in the excellent ſtudies of humanitie, ſeing that fortune, althoughe ſhe can take from vs al other thinges, yet ſhe leaueth the abilitie to take good aduiſement in ſafety for al aduerſitie. And therefore there is no Citie wherein there ought not to bee greate vſe of learnynge, in ſo much that by the ſteppes of Arte, as it were, we iudge that there is in it an aſſemblie of men. So Ariſtippus when he had ſuffered ſhip wracke, &amp; was caſt out vpon the ſhore at Rhodes, and perceiued certaine figures of Geometrie drawen

in the ſande, is reported to haue cried to his felowes:The ſteppes of men. be of good courage, for I ſee the ſteppes of men. And ſtraight waie he entered into the citie of Rhodes, and went to the ſchole, and there reaſoning of Philoſophy, he was preſented with rewardes, ſo that hee did not onely furniſhe him ſelfe, but prouided clothing and all other neceſſaries for theim that were with him. But when his companions were minded to returne into their countrey, and aſked him whether he would haue any thinge conueied home, he willed theim to reporte this, as Vitruuius rehearſeth: That they ought to prepare ſuch poſſeſſions, and ſuch prouiſion for their children, as if they ſuffered ſhippewrake, might ſwimme to the ſhoore with them. For they be the true ſtaies of our life, which neither the ſtormes of fortune, neitherTrue riches. the chaunge of common weales, ne yet the iniquitie of warre, can harme.
               But how muche the ſtudies of humanitie haue alwayeThe ſtudies of humanitie. from the beginnynge holpen common weales, hereby we maie perceiue, becauſe no manne can more perfitely reaſon and decide of the vertue and happines whiche we ſeke in the ſocietie of menne, then he that hath the knowledge of ſuch thinges as belong to god and manne. By the guidynge whereof he perceyueth what is right, what conſcionable, what iuſte, what it is to helpe one another, and what is required to aduaunce the common weale: whereby not onely good gouernement is fortified, but alſo lawes, &amp; the whole frame of kepyng a ciuill order, is eſtabliſhed. For no man euer well adourned any Citie, that hath not had the knowledge of theſe thinges. So that he ſemed to haue aunſwered verye wiſelye, whiche ſaide that this was the principall praiſe of Philoſophers, that they coulde write lawes, and builde cities. Suche a manne was Zaleucus at Locrus, Charondas among the Catinians,Lawe makers. Philolaus amonge the Thebanes, Plato to the Magneſians, Draco and Solon to the Athenians,

Pittacus to the Prienians, Androdamas to the Tracians, and other lawe makers in other places as Ariſtotle hath left in writynge. Moreouer Horace teſtifieth, that the Poetes were wonte to call menne into townes from their wilde and ſauage life, and to ſhew them a trade of good liuinge, in theſe verſes:

Thou haſt brought foorthe Cities, thou haſt aſſembled menne before diſperſed, into a ſocietie of life, thou ioyneſt them firſte in houſes, then in marriages, laſt of all in the communitye of learnyng and languages. Thou haſt bene the founder of lawes, thou, the maiſtres of maners and diſcipline. Hereupon ſayeth Plato that that common weale is happy, where either Philoſophers raigne, or the kinges and rulers be ſtudious of Philoſophie. Moreouer, vnleſſe there be practiſed in the common weale the doctrine of true religion and Godlineſſe, the diſcipline of good behauioure, and the balaunce of Iuſtice, what ſhall it be els but a conuocacion of wicked men, wherein riote, licenciouſnes, filthineſſe, beaſtlineſſe, intemperancie, vngodlines, and all kinde of viciouſnes for vertues, take place and beare ſwaye, whiche neuertheles men of excellent learnynge and cleanneſſe of life, may by conueniente meanes rote out, and by openynge the right waye of vertue, bringe menne to ciuilitie and nurture.

For the waies of men in this poincte dooe differ from the dennes, caues, couertes, &amp; filthines of other liuing Creatures, becauſe they ought to be ſtrengthened by reaſon onely, and ſo to paſſe foorthe vnto the degrees of humanitie. But ymagine a citie to be well peopled, fortified, faire builded, but yet geuen to ydolatrie and wickedneſſe, as Cayrum, and (the more is the pitie) Conſtantinople, and many other kingdomes, ſeigniories,

Such be preſerued, and for the moſte parte dooe moſt flouriſhe, not onely by the kinges power and ſworde, but more by the inſtinct of nature, whiche reaſon frameth and moueth to the ſocietie of life, that is, by ordinaunce of lawes, whereby euerie man is commaunded to liue, and to obey higher powers.

But if he graunt thē to be learned, and yet neuer theleſſe not to be obeied: he hurteth not the men, but weakeneth the lawes and ordinaunces, and miſconſtrueth the meanyng of a perfite common weale.
               And like as the common weale can neither be appointed, ne yet maintened without the fence of good ordinaunces: ſo can it not be gouerned without aſſiſtence of learned Lawyers. For who can (as Socrates warneth vs in Plato) gouerne better then he, whiche ſometime hath obeied gouernemente, and knoweth what doeth belong vnto gouernement? Who can better diſcerne that is right from that is wrong, that is equall from that is vnequall, that is good, from that is euill, then he whiche hath learned to examine al thinges accordyng to the rule of honeſtie and lawe? for vnpoſſible is it for a man to practiſe that arte wherein he hath no ſkill.

nothing is ſo muche to be maintened, as the ſtudie of the ciuill lawe. For if ye take it awaye, no man can knowe any certaintie what is his owne, what is another mannes.

Howbeit they muſte nedes be ſtudious of vertue and Godlineſſe, to whom this function ſo holie &amp; ſo profitable in common muſte be committed, which the lawyer by his profeſſion and worthineſſe maketh to be more commendable and ſamous: as a thinge that can not be achiued without holines, ſobernes, faithfulnes, and temperaunce. For when holy thinges be committed vnto our charge, we muſt dooe them with holines, leaſt that which falleth amiſſe by the behauiour of the perſon, be imputed vnto the thing.

And of all other, he is moſte bounden to giue beſt admoniciō, vpon whom as one that hath gotten this knowlege of lawe, equitie, and iuſtice, all mennes iyes be caſte, and in whom euery man conceiueth a good opinion. But if he fortune to ſtraie from the pathe of Iuſtice, it tourneth to the endamagyng of a greate meany. Now if thei that haue the publique gouernemente bee vnlearned, and not ſeen in the lawes, then thei ſtaie vpō the Lawiers, whom thei haue aſſociated vnto thē: of whom, bicauſe it is a ſhame for thē, trauailyng in lawe, not to knowe what is Lawe, thei ſeke and learne what maie ſtandeCorrupt Lawyers. with Lawe.

For if through ignoraunce their offence be committed, it is a greate ſhame, ſeinge they ought not to intermeddle in that charge, whiche becauſe it is for the common profite, can not be either neglected, or not faithfullye adminiſtred without great harme that muſte of neceſſitie redounde to all the commoners of the ſame. But if that through coueteouſnes, gredy deſire, of ſet purpoſe, for priuate aduauntage, or maliciouſnes of minde, they be moued to corrupt the common eſtate, wickedlye to buie and ſell it, and by driuynge out iuſtice the onelye ſence of the common weale to diſſolue the ſame, which they ſhoulde rather ſaue, edifie, and adourne with the comely beautie of honour and vertue: Howe deueliſhe a thinge that is, and what an euill preſident, onely he knoweth not whiche hath no knowlege at all, neither of right, nor honeſtie, nor any conſcionable dealynge.

For God hath not for nought ſo plentifully poured his grace vpon them, but to the ende thei ſhold ſerue mankinde faithfullye and fearefully, profite the ſame, and direct all the diſpenſation and miniſterye of the lawe, and charge taken vppon them, to the profite of their neighbour, and glory of almighty God. Who ſo doth this, maie wall be called an expounder of right and Lawes, and he made gouernoure ouer common weales, as one that ceaſeth not to plante iuſtice, to appoint the limites of priuate and publike thinges, helpe the good, puniſhe the euill, &amp; beſtow well the profeſſion of equitie &amp; iuſtice, which be hath taken vpon him.

Of whom the chiefe Iuſtices which dooe decide theLawiers likened to ſoldiers doubtes of matters in controuerſie, whiche by the force of their defence dooe oftetimes both in priuate and common caſes erect thinges that be in daunger to fall, and reſtore thinges that be in hazard to be loſt, doe no leſſe aduaunce the common commoditie of manne, then if thei ſhoulde by battayle and woundes reſcue their countrey and parents from the brunte of enemies. For the Patrones of actions in dede be as ſouldiours, whiche truſtyng as it were vnto the artillarie of their eloquent vtteraunce, dooe defende the hoope, life, and poſteritie or their clientes. Herupon Anaſtaſius the Emperour calleth the office of a iudge a thinge praiſe worthy, and nedefull for theIudges. Seargeauntes life of man. Suche do I call Sergeants and aduocates whiche do not employ their trauaile wholly in the adminiſtration of the common weale, but take vpon thē the pleadynge and determinynge of other mens ſutes and actions for an ordinarie fee, whiche the Greakes call Pragmatici, as if thei ſhoulde ſaie, courte pleaders, whom Lullie in his firſt boke of his Oratour calleth the expounders of lawe, &amp; miniſters to the Oratour in iudgemētes.

And therefore in the common weale their vocacions be diuers. For in dede ſuche be properly called Aduocates, which do enforme

the Pleaders, Proctours, or Attourneis what the law is, and enſtruct them how to fourme their actions. Yet thoſe whiche I before named Pragmatici, be more nigh vnto theſe in their practiſe, all whiche be bothe profitable and nedefull in a common weale.

As for example: A man is fullye perſwaded that there is ſomethinge due vnto him, or els it is ſo that a mannes aduerſarie driueth him to defende him ſelfe by lawe. As for the matter whereupon he groundeth his ſute, he ſeemeth to ſtand vpon right, and therefore to haue the more poſſibilitie of compaſſynge his purpoſe, for that his matter appeareth right. But becauſe there be many poinctes whiche make the ſute to ſeme iniurious, ſo that the defendaunt may haue ſome reſcue for him ſelfe, it ſhalbe the duetie of a counſellour to ſearche out all thinges by circumſtaunces, and to warne his Client that hee dooe not raſhely attempt his ſute, for feare of leaſyng bothe his labour and damages. On the other ſide, the matter falleth ſo out, that either the one muſt take the foyle, or defende him ſelfe by lawe. Wherein it muſt be aduiſedly conſidered whether the forme and maner of defence be iuſt or no. Whiche hazardes he muſt aduenture vpon by the aduiſe of his learned counſell: leſt that when he hath once entered his ſute, he ſeeke to be diſmiſſed, and aſke counſayle to late, when he ſhall be enforced to procede according to order of lawe.

                   whō we ſe that bothe princes, and the people doe highly eſteme. Soche a manne was Archagatus, of whom

Plinie maketh mencion, whiche was the firſte of that ſorte of Phiſicions for healyng woundes that came to Rome, to whom his enfranchiſement was giuen, and a ſhoppe purchaſed by the Chamber of the citee, in Acilius ſtreete, at the firſt verie welcome to the citee, although after for his extremitie in launcyng and ſearyng, he was commonly called a tyrannous tormentour, and his profeſſion became odious.
               But it can not be contraried, but that this arte (asPhiſicke and Surgerie be muche abuſed. there is nothing faultleſſe, and without ſhamefull miſuſage in thinges founde out for the ſafety of man) is verie diſceitfully vſed, ſo that it appeareth rather to be a colour for craftie conueyaunces, then an helpe for mans healthe. Whereby euerie olde Witche, euerye cutthroate and catchepole, euerie vnthrifty riotter (to ouerpaſſe other raſcalles and ſlauiſhe ſurgeons) ſeeke to cloke their prolling practiſes. To whom if you ioyn the Iewes and other ſtraunge trauellours, whiche vſe to miniſter but one herbe, or one drinke for all kinde of diſeaſes, be they neuer of ſo ſundrie natures, and therein dooe promiſe healpe for euerie ſore: then it maie euidentlye appeare in howe great daunger a man of to light credite is, how readilie he maie be reft of his life vnder the pretenced name of arte, how freely a man maie be murthered. To this number ye may aſſociate another ſorte, whiche purchaſing their grace for monei, ruffle in their ringes, and by faire promiſes onely, deceiue ſuche as reſorte vnto theim: braggyng vpon ſoche knowlege of Phiſike, as thei neuer in anyVnlearned Phiſicians. part could any thing like attain vnto, as though that death had hired them to lie in waite for mennes liues, and to ſend moe to their graues to fulfill the meaſure of mortalitie: profitable to none but to ſoche, whiche alſo wiſhe in like for a greate plague, as by diggyng of pittes in Churche yardes, and other ſoche like buſineſſe aboute burialles, doe gette their liuynges: But wonderous pernicious to the common weale, whiche

Concerning ſuche felowes, let vs heare what PliniePlin. lib. 29 nat. hiſto. capi. i. remembreth, which ſemeth to touche them ſome what nearer the quicke. In this onely arte (ſaieth he) dooeth it come to paſſe, that who ſo once profeſſeth hym ſelfe to be a Phiſicion, he is incontinent hadde in credite, whereas there is no like daunger in anye other falſe profeſſion, yet we dooe not conſider that euery manne thinketh that life is ſwete. And there is no lawe to puniſhe ſuche ignoraunte manſleaers, through whom ſo many be brought to their graues, there is no example of reuengemente executed vppon theim. They learne by our daungers and by experimentes to playe deathes parte with vs, onely the Phiſicion is vnpuniſhed for murder. Moreouer they playe the railers, and blame their pacientes for intemperate diete, and begin to checke theim, when thei be choked with deathe alreadie. And the moe they bee, the more harme they worke, when thei be not all of one iudgement, but one counſaileth one waye, and an other an other, to the greate diſcomforte and deſtruction of their pacientes. Whiche thinge as it certainely hurte the Emperoure Adrian, ſo theſe wordes afterwarde engrauen vppon his tombe declared the ſame: The rable of Phiſicions ſlewe the Emperour. For howe can he profeſſe that arte, or by it diſcerue well of mankinde, whiche for lacke of knowledge canne neither attaine to any taſte of perfection, ne yet vſe thereof. In whoſe handelyng I woulde neither come the firſte, ne yet the ſeconde, that he ſhoulde take any experiment of his raſheneſſe vpon my fleſhe, and (as the Prouerbe ſaieth,) ſhoulde hurle at a Rauen, and kill her vppon my carkaſe. For the arte of it ſelfe is no leſſe diuers then nature, whoſe ſeruaunt and handmaide it is well called.
               Whiche no man coulde euer attaine vnto without exquiſite ſtudie and knowledge of natural Philoſophy

the vſe whereof it doeth aboue others ſhewe and open vnto men. It is not vnproperlie ſpoken which is commonlyThe Phiſicion beginneth where the Philoſopher endeth ſaied: where the Philoſopher endeth, there the Phiſicion beginneth. As though the profeſſion of any ſcience were in vaine attempted, whoſe foundacion is not laied vpon the verie principles of nature. Therefore Ianus Cornarius a man well ſeene in bothe the tongues, calleth him ſelfe a naturall Phiſiicion, as others dooe, which haue ſearched the ſecretes of nature by Philoſophie, holdinge this opinion, that the perfection of this arte is compaſſed and gotten by the contemplacion of naturalitie, and that with reaſon, as it were puttynge a difference betwene the true Phiſicions, and thoſe that take vpon theim the name of arte, lacking the principles groūded vpon cauſes &amp; certaintie of reaſon, whiche can neuer abſolutely, and without mans great deſtruction practiſe their facultie. Neither is it conuenient that vpon conſideracion hadde of any one thinge, any man ſhould take a cure in hande, and as it were with the trippe of a die hazarde a mans life. But firſt he muſt vnderſtande what the diſeaſe is, and the circumſtaunces thereof: then the diſpoſicion ofObſeruacions of Phiſicions. the pacient, &amp; the part wherin the diſeaſe began firſt to grow: the the cauſe, which being taken away, y• diſeaſe beinge but an imperfection of nature, is eaſely cured. Afterwarde muſt he take deliberacion in appointynge his medicine, that it ſo aunſwere in all poinctes, that it delaye, not nouriſhe the ſickenes, whiche requireth much diligence. For the earth bringeth forth the medicine: but it is our parte to conſider what the nature and ſtrength of eche thinge is, howe eche muſt be applied to eche diſeaſe.

                  WHO ſo conſidereth well the olde common weales, and chiefely of the Greakes, amongeſt other thinges whiche they bothe wiſely and worthely ordeined, ſhall finde this very commendable, that they thought it beſt that yonge men ſhould be trayned vp, taught, and prepared to the profitynge of the common weale. For thei knew that mannes life with out knowlege was not like a life, and that the paſſage to vertue, ſo troubled with brambles and Briers, ſo harde to climbe, coulde not eaſelye be founde out and paſſed. Which thinge many men holde to be ſignified by the notable herbe Molie, whiche Homere ſo highly praiſeth: Which had that name geuen it by the Gods,

OfTillage. whiche, Tillage, or as thei tearme it by a worthier name, Houſebandrie, is nombred in the firſte place, without whiche, we can neither be able to maintaine our ſelues, neither any commoditie can growe for the preſeruacion of the publique honour. This fruitefull trade is worthie verie high commendacion, not onely by reaſon of the antiquitie thereof, but bicauſe bothe holie men, and ſuche as haue bene renowmed in the common weale, haue not diſdeined to exerciſe theim ſelues therein. And firſt of all Adam whom God firſte created, was ſent out of Paradiſe to till and worke vpon the earth, from whence he had his beginnynge.

whiche hath twoo groundes: the frame, and deuiſe.Buildyng is deuided into twoo partes: frame, and diuiſe. The frame we call that, whiche is made by hande, a continued and frequented conceipt of practiſe. Deuiſe is that, whiche by cunnyng and reaſon of proporcion, can deſcriue and open the thinges framed. So hereby it moſte euidently appereth, that neither a man can be a cunnyng builder, without knowledge of learnyng by onely experiēce, neither by onely deuiſe and learning, without experience. But who ſo knitteth bothe theſe poinctes together as a man, bothe learned by practiſe, and practiſed by learnyng, ſhall beare the price, and haue his knowlege by aucthoritie allowed. As for learnyng in this poinct, a man is then to be thought ſufficiently inſtructed therein, if he be ſkilfull in painting, ſeen in Geometrie not ignoraunt in the perſpectiues, learned in Arithmetike, rife in hiſtories, and well ſtudied in Philoſophie.

Yea, furthermore manye kingdomes, prouinces, and common weales whiche lye vppon the water ſides, were not able to ſaue them ſelues &amp; their goodes from Pyrates &amp; rouers whiche lie in waite for ſpoile and praye, euen in the middeſt of the Sea, were they not prouided of a nauie, whiche they muſt bringe forthe by water, as an armye by lande, againſte ſuche ſpoylynge raueners.

Although menne of old tyme, thought Merchaundiſe to be a thyng merueilous nedefull for a common weale, yet thei neuer held theſame, as a part thereof: bicauſe that Merchauntes wer in deede, more bent to ſeke outward goodes, then that thei would beſtowe any tyme in followyng vertue, whereby thei might atteigne vnto the firſte degree of happineſſe in this life, whiche conſiſteth in quietneſſe, and wante of trouble, as Ariſtotle wittily gathereth. But thei whiche dwell in a Citee, dooe not ſo embrace vertue, that thei can preſume vpon ſoche quietneſſe: forſomoche as one foloweth the Anuile, an other the Lome, an other, an other trade to get his liuyng, ſo that thei maie not ſo conueniently attend vpon that Philoſophicall contemplacion. Yea, moreouer the very courſe of thynnes teacheth vs, that no citee can either be builded, or yet mainteined, by onely quiete and contēplatiue perſones. For the wealth whereof, the Merchaunt caried euen in the middle of the waues, ſhall dooe as moche good, as if he tariyng at home, ſhould onely debate with hymſelf felicities, and conceiue in his mynde, aSoche as occupie them ſelues in worldly affaires, d

bee wee neuer ſo buſie, yet we ſhall liue in quiete, and become ſcholers to God, and bee prepared to a bleſſed life. And this is the meanyng of that ſaiyng, whereby we be commaunded, to eate our bread in the ſweate of our browes, and happely to vſe the bleſſyng of that our labour.
               Let not the Philoſophers therefore, and their contēplatiue life trouble vs, whiche in this worldly eſtate thei maie well ſeke, but ſhall neuer finde: for ſo moche as it hath an other marke, whereat we dooe not ſhote with our fleſhlie, but ſpirituall iyes, whiche are hidde frō the wiſe of this worlde: So that it maketh no matter, whether he be a Merchaunte at home, or abroade, idle, or buſied: So that he beare a good and vprighte minde toward the common weale, whiche without any deceipte, any guile, or vnreaſonable enhaunſyng the price of thinges, he purpoſeth ſincerely &amp; godlilie to helpe, &amp; by honeſt meanes to prouide for his liuing.
               And as all other occupacions were, ſo was this vſe of Merchaundiſe founde out, for a meane to get thinges neceſſarie for mannes liuyng, whiche by quickeneſſe of witte gathered force, and ſo encreaſed beyond meaſure: wherein the moſte parte of men, rather ſeke for their owne gaine (the ſmell whereof is ſwete, from whence ſo euer it cometh) then that thei paſſe vppon the aidyng and releuyng of other mennes neceſſities. Therefore all Merchauntes bee had in a ſuſpicion, forLeaſt occupiers be moſte ſuſpected. to moche deſire of gain, and chiefly ſoche as be the leaſt occupiers. For he that occupieth but a ſmall quantitie of wares, muſt neades thereupon bee mainteined, hauyng none other trade to liue by: and of that little, muſte he neades gather ſo moche, as will beare hym out, and kepe his whole houſholde: Yea, and ſo moche as he could not get (takyng an indifferente and reaſonable gaine) although he ſhould occupie a great deale more. And hereuppon it appereth why. Tullie diſprouethLi. i. de offi. baſe Merchaundrie as vile, bicauſe it is not ſatiſfied

with a meane aduauntage, when he ſaith: Merchaundrie if it be ſmall, is to be rekened as filthie: but if it be great and wealthie, bringing in moche on euerie ſide, and impartyng to many without liyng, it is not moche to bee blamed. Yea further, if it bee ſaciate with competent lucre, or rather content, that, as from the maine ſea, oftymes it landeth in the hauen, ſo like wiſe from the hauen, it growe to landes and hereditamentes, it ſeameth by good righte to deſerue praiſe. Neither is that merchaunt commēded without a cauſe which forbeareth no maner of trauaill, whom no cold, no heate, no daunger of life doeth ſtate, but that by an allowed and commendable meane, he will applie his buſines, and enlarge the common profite, and deliuer hymſelf and his, from pouertie and famine. Whiche matter. Horace a famous maiſter, both in Philoſophie and maners, declareth in theſe twoo verſes:
               
                  The Marchaunt ſvvift to fardeſt coaſt of Inde, for vvealth he ronnes:

               And therefore Marcus Cato tearmeth a MarchantCato calleth a Merchaunte Actiue. actiue, as one that will not be weried, but watchfull and diligent to worke for wealthe, by theſe wordes: I take a marchaunt to be verie actiue in prouidyng ſubſtance, but ſubiect to many daungers, and full of miſeries. Whom the Romains reputed ſo profitable and neceſſarie a member of their common weale, that if he chaunced to be harmed, they woulde be ſtraight waies armed, and ready to reueng his quarel: whereof Tullie putteth vs in minde, ſaiyng: Your elders ofttimes, if their marchauntes or mariners had bene iniuriouſlie handled, would haue waged warre for their ſakes.

The reſte of theſe ſpectacles, are to be ſeen in Iultus Pollux. Sometymes alſo games were deuiſed for exerciſyng the bodie, that thereby menne might be the ſtronger, and more fitte for the warres: ſoche did Pyrrhus ſonne of Achilles, the king of the Epirotes firſte practiſe, wherein young menne daunced, al in complete harneis, to thende thei might bee the nimbler, whiche vppon this cauſe, thei call the Pyrricall daunce, although Strabo and Dyoniſius of Halycarnaſſe, doe father it vpon the Candianes.

               I will not here recoumpt all the ſpectacles, whiche the glorious Grekes inuēted, either in honour of their goddes, or for the memoriall of their benefactours, and cauſe of their preſeruacion and ſafetie, whiche the RomainesThe Romains beſtowed much coſt vpon pageauntes and ſpectacles. labouryng to excelle, bothe in famouſneſſe of name, and finenes of matter, did beſtowe ſo greate expenſes, ſo greate ſubſtaunce vpon Theatres, Amphitheatres, couertes, Daunſing courtes, plottes in the ground, garniſhinges, plaiers apparell, raunges, and Galaries, and finallie, the verie games theim ſelues, whoſe exhibiting was cōmitted to the Aediles charge, that a man would wonder that thoſe men, whoſe aunceſtours were ſo thriftie, &amp; ſo peereleſſe for witte, did ſo dearelie buie pleaſure. Whence proceded the LupercalesLupercalia. Saturnalia. Circences ludi. in the honour of Pan, the Saturnales in the honor of Saturn, the game of fighting with fiſtes &amp; running with horſes, the Fenſeplaiers, and a thouſande moe deuiſes, not for pleaſure onely, but alſo outragious crueltie, as wherein men were conſtreigned, one to runne vpon an other, and one to ſtea an other, with deadlie woundes: yea, forther to encounter with wildBeaſtlike exerciſes. beaſtes, and ſo to looke for preſente death. A thyng ſo cruell, ſo abhominable, and ſo beaſtlike, that the eare abhorreth the hearyng: and the iye deteſteth the ſighte thereof.
               But for my purpoſe at this preſente, theſe games, whether thei be on ſtage, or on the ground, thei ought to bee emong vs Chriſtians cleane, chaſie, ciuill, and ſpecially to be ſet forth by ſoche as meane bothe to delight, and profite. For the moſte parte of men, that be either of aucthoritie or learnyng, doe holde ſoche perſones as infamous, whiche doe either plaie on ſtages,

or exhibite other games, for lucre ſake. And yet twoo emong the Romaines,

This Roſcius although Tullie iudged that he ought not to haue died, bicauſe of his excellencie in his arte, yet it is well knowen, that he practiſed this vnhoneſt trade of gaine. And yet this was a great deale more tollerable in him, beyng a manne of great eloquence, then that now a daies a great nūber of bungling boorders, ſhold be mainteined therwith, which be ſo farre vnlike to the olde Roſcius, that thei be not worthie to be followed of any.

Whē Clitemneſtra for the loue of Aegiſtus, killed her houſebande Agamemnone, after his returne from the ſiege of Troie (as the tragicall Poetes doe write) you maie vſe it for an argumente, that the loue of an aduoutreſſe is ſo vnpacient and madde, that ſhe will not ſpare, neither her owne houſebande, nor frendes, to eaſe her ſtomacke.
               Followyng this order, there ſhall be no Tragedie, no Comedie, nor any other kinde of plaie, but it maie encreaſe the diſcipline of good maners, if by the helpe of reaſon and zeale of honeſtie, it bee well emploied.

Concerning whiche matter, Tullie putteth vs in minde by theſe wordes: But it is auailable in al queſtions of duetie, to haue alwaie in mind, howe moche the nature of manne excedeth dumbe cattel, and other brute beaſtes. For thei perceiue nothing but pleaſure, whereunto their naturall inſtincte wholie leadeth them. But the minde of man is nouriſhed by learnyng, and in thought either enquireth, or doth ſomething, and is allured with the delight of hearing and ſeyng.
               And if any one be ſomewhat more then the reſt, enclined to vertue, although he be ſomtime moued with pleaſure, yet for ſhamefaſtneſſe he hideth and diſſembleth his affeccion.
               With whiche diſcrecion, who ſo beholdeth Tragedies, Comedies, Games of runnyng or exerciſe, wraſtling, plaies of hiſtories, holy or prephane, or any pageaunt, on ſtage or on grounde, ſhall not miſpende his time.

Hereby wee learne how to get thoſe thinges, whiche maie he bothe in our owne poſſeſſion, and alſo in the tenure of euery perticulare perſone, and ſometime by the Lawe of nature, ſometime by the common Lawe, and ſometime by the Lawe ciuill, whiche had then her beginning, when citees were firſt founded, Magiſtrates choſen, and Lawes written. And emongeſt other Lawes, this is one: that if my corne fortune to be mired with yours, that it is not now common, no more then if my cattell be ſtraied emongſt yours, ſo long asThe lawe in certayne caſes. the ſubſtaunce of eche parte remaineth. But if all the corne bee deteined by either of vs, it was then agreed for Lawe, that for the thing, there lieth an action, according vnto the quantitie of the Corne, and that an indifferent man ſhall adiudge, how moche corne apperteineth to either partie. And therefore who ſo wittinglie buildeth vppon an other mannes grounde, he that is Lorde of the ſoile, maie claime the building: as if my plauntes haue taken roote in an other mannes ground, thei ſhall belong to the owner of the ground. Contrariwiſe, if any manne without ſuſpicion of deceiptfull dealing, hath with his penſell drawen a picture in an other mannes Table: the better opinion of Lawiers is, that the table ſhall yelde to the painting, the owner of the table being paied for the ſame. For it ſemed a fooliſhe reaſon (ſaieth Caius the Lawier) that a picture of fine woorkemanſhip, drawne by Apelles, or Parrhaſius, ſhould giue place to a vile boorde. An inſt

ſuch thinges as be profitable. The knowledge whereof hath no great commoditie, without vſe and practiſe, wherby as by a perfite guide and cunning ſcholemaiſter, it obteineth full force and effect. As if Parrhaſius ſhoulde conceiue the fourme of a notable picture in his minde, and yet not draw the ſame in a table, be might well inwardely pleaſe him ſelfe, but ſurely he ſhoulde not delight other mens eyes, muche leſſe then deſerue any commendacion for his worke.
               This rule of folowing the true vſe of profite he beſt obſerueth, whiche ſo ſeketh to further him ſelfe, that he hinder not an other: which ſo regardeth his priuate lucre, that he will not ſeame to haue his minde onelie fixed therein, but to be warie and thriftie, that this his labour maie be profitable vniuerſallie, and an help to mainteigne the common worſhip. This is he alone, whiche maie gather greate riches, and ſeeke gaine by order of Lawe permitted: as one that night and daie, without harme to any man, honeſtlie ſetteth his handes to woorke with his wife, children, and familie: vppon whom the bleſſing of God being beſtowed, ſuffereth not his browes to ſweate in vaine: But giueth him encreaſe ſo abundant▪ that he doth not onely meruaile at his greate wealthe and proſperitie, but alſo ceaſeth not to render thankes to GOD, whiche hathGod bleſſeth honeſt laboure vouchſafed to bleſſe his labour. This is it that we bee commaunded, to eate our bread with the ſweat of our browes, whiche the heauenlic father euer enlargeth, and plentifully encreaſeth to his glory. So it is faled to thoſe that kepe the commaundementes of God▪ and the Lorde thy God ſhall bleſſe thee in all thy fruictes,Deute. xvi. and in all the workes of thy handes, and thou ſhalt be in gladneſſe. Herevpon doe wee call labour holie, but not euery kinde of labour, but onely that wherein we trauaile, not with thankes giuing that is feigned, but that iſſheweth from the pureneſſe of harte, and worſhippeth God truely, whereupon that came to paſſe,

that the Lorde looked vpon Abell and his offerynges, but vpon Cain and his offerynges he looked not. And while Cain was verie angrie, and his countenaunce abated, for that he deſpiſed to lift vp his face to heauē, and choſed rather to looke doune vpon the yearth, the Lorde ſaied vnto him: why art thou angrie, and why is thy countenaunce abated? if thou dooeſt well, ſhall there not be a promocion: and if thou dooeſt euill, ſhall not thy ſinne be ſtreight waie at the doores?
               You vnderſtand how it behoueth him to be minded that will liue well emongeſt good men, and will honeſtly

And in this ſenſe he that harmeth not, ſemeth to profite, remembryng that ſaiyng, whiche Adrian the Emperour would haue to be written in golden letters, and to be ſette before euerie mannes iyes: dooe not that to an other, whiche thou wouldeſt not haue dooen to thy ſelf: wherevpon, that bothe the lawe of God and man doeth depend, the onely defender of all trueth, witneſſeth.
               And this is alſo that, whiche the Ciuill ſocietie requireth, wherein profites be imparted from one to an other, that there be no Lioniſhe practiſe, wherein one alone ſhall beare awaie all the gaine, and an other beare onely the name of a pertener. Wherfore the Apoſtle ſainct Paule, teacheth the Corinthians ful well that thei muſt be conuerſaunte one with an other, honeſtly and orderly: whiche precepte no man doubteth, but it is giuen to all Chriſtians, and to ſoche as dooe their endeuour to doe well. Let all thinges (ſaieth he) be doen emongſt you decently, and in good order. And what is it els, that a thing be doen in good order, then accordyng to lawe, that is, iuſtly and without harme doen vnto others?

The like order ſhall be takē for Bakehouſes, whiche if thei be meaſured after the price of corne, it is a thing to be allowed in a citee.

                  The argument of the thirde Chapter.
                   That riches if they be well gotten, be not to be contemned, and how that if a man haue exceſſiue wealthe he is ſubiect to many daungers.
               
               
                  HE that could plucke the pleaſure of coueteouſneſſe out of mennes mindes, might eaſelie appoinct a meane in gatherynge ſubſtaunce, &amp; would ſaie that he were wealthie, not thatHe i

                      riche that deſiereth little. hath much in poſſeſſion, but he that deſiereth little. For nature (euen by the confeſſion of Epicurus) is contente with a meane eſtate. After whoſe rule who ſo liueth, ſhall not bee lightlye poore. Contrariwiſe, if we fall to coueteouſneſſe, we ſhall neuer be riche. For the coueteous man is vnſaciable, not content when he hath that he deſiereth, as one that as well dooeth lacke that he hath, as that he hath not. But becauſe▪ wee can not bee mainteined without the help of riches, although who ſo hathe theim, is neuer without care and anguiſhe: ſome meanes muſte be founde howe to come honeſtlie by theim, and to employe theim to the commoditie of manie.

Thus Salomon was magnified aboue all Princes of the earth for wealth and wiſdome. And that king Dauid the Pſalmiſt his father had great aboundaunce of riches▪ this may be an argument, becauſe a great treaſure was hidde in his Sepulchre in priuie cheſtes, outDauids welth. of one of the which a thouſand and three hundred yere after, Hircanus then Biſhoppe (as Ioſephus writeth) toke three thouſande Talentes of golde to deliuer the citie from the ſiege of Antiochus: whiche proueth that it dothe ſtande with the eſtate of kinges to haue treaſure,

as without whiche, they can neither be kinges, neither gouerne and defende their ſubiectes. Yet they muſt be wel aduiſed, that they doe not vpon light conſideracions either take pore mennes goodes gotten bi their trauaile, or riottouſly conſume the ſame, but rather ſhewe them ſelues vpright in al this wealth, and remember that ſo muche they maye dooe, as the lawe permitteth.

And Loth alſo whiche was in Abrahams time,Abraham was verie riche. had herdes of ſhepe, droues of cattell, and tabernacles, neither coulde the lande receiue them that they might dwell together.

Whiche thing that you maie not thinke, that it is vaine, and of light credite, our maiſter Chriſte,Math▪ xix. Marc. x. the onelie aſſurer of life and healthe, witneſſeth the ſame, to truelie to a greate nomber: ſaiyng, verelie I ſaie vnto you, it is harde for a riche man, to enter into the kyngdome of heauen. And again, I ſaie vnto you, it is more eaſie for a Camell, to go through the iye of a nedle, then for a riche manne to enter into the kingdome of heauen. For although he heare the woorde of life, yet it is ſo choked with worldlie cares, riches, and pleaſures, that it can bryng forthe no fruicte.

                  FOR as muche as a common weale is an vnperfite and deformed thing, wherein echeman traueileth to profite him ſelfe onely, not reſpectynge his neighbour: to the entent a ciuill ſocietie maye be knowen when it is perfite: Wee muſt vnderſtande, that the chiefe thinge that is required therein, is the

empartinge of commodities betwene man and man, whiche I appoincte then to come to paſſe, when thinges are honeſtly vſed. Whiche argumente the Philoſophers did ſcarce ſuperficiallye touche, appliynge this place (that we be born not for our ſelues, but that our frendes and countrey dooe chalenge parte of our being) rather vnto their quiete life in learnynge and ſtudie, then vnto the profitynge of one another, thinkinge this to be the onely felicitie, to wounder at the worke of nature, to liue a contemplatiue life, wherein the life being diſburdened of all thought &amp; care, might behold the beautie of thinges, &amp; liue in a certain kinde of contented quietneſſe. It maie in deede come ſoApathia. to paſſe, that by meanes of this quietneſſe they maye the more commodiouſlye applie their ſtudie, but I doe not ſee how it is poſſible to attaine to that their tranquilitie, while they bee thus empriſonned with fleſhe and bloude, where onely affections rule, onely vanitie taketh place, as a thinge paſſynge the nature of man. Wherefore lurke they maie, but profite they can not, vnleſſe it be by teachynge other, and makynge theim fitte to ſcrue in the common weale, by the preceptes of Philoſophie, and diſcipline of maners, ſo farre as nature healpeth them: herein reſembling the whetſtone whiche beeyng it ſelfe blunte, yet ſharpeneth a knife.

Whoſe vanitie,

I holde as leude as the Philoſophers, conſideryng thei theim ſelues confeſſe, that man is borne for mannes behoofe, that one maie profite an other, as Tullie ſaieth. Whereby I can not ſee how that this ſaiyng can bee true: he that hath lurked well, hath liued well, vnleſſe we doe meane, that for the moſt part it is a verie profitable thing, not to be conuerſaunt in Princes courtes, nor to delight in vaine nobilitie. Otherwiſe to ſeke a ſolitarie life, to flie from the ſocietie of man, to beſtowe no labour vpon the cōmon weale, not to impart commodities, not to enforme other, and ſo to giue an accoumpt of his idle time, is the propertie of a ſwine, whiche alwaie walloweth in the

For thearth tilled with hand doeth yelde the ſame: and it conſiſteth in earable grounde, medowes, paſtures, orchardes, and other ſoyle, wherof the old fathers gathered all their ſubſtaunce. And therefore they were called Locupletes in latin, as who ſaye, Pleniloci &amp; agri, that is,Locupletes. wealthie bicauſe they had plentie of place and lande. And therfore ill tillage of the grounde was thought among the Romains a fault vnder the Cenſours correction: as Plinie writeth: and as Cato ſaieth, it wasPlini. lib. 18. Capit iii. thought the higheſt name of prayſe to be called a good huſbandman. And yet it was thought expedient that

riches ſhulde be moderate and not to exceſſiue: whervpon Manius Curius ſaid in an aſſemble of people, that he was a corrupt citezin which could not content himſelfe with ſeuen furlonges of lande: thinking it a matter meete for the worthines of the common weale, yf euerye man ſo ſeeke his owne aduantage, that other be not enforced therby to ſtand in neceſſitie, &amp; to want grounde to worke vppon, bycauſe other haue to much in theyr owne handes and occupation. Secondlye we mentayne our ſelues by practiſinge of artes and faculties, which we vſe as our ſupporters and ſtaies of our old age, ſo muche thoneſter, the neerer thei drawe to the rule of good and conſcyonable dealynge, and be exerciſed not for lucre onelie, but that our neighbour therby maye be relieued, and the common eſtate furthered. After theſe come trafficques of Merchauntes, Mercers, Vintners, and ſuch other which nature garniſhed with reaſon, deuiſed for the neceſſitie of man, &amp; ſo helped this fellowlie life. Laſt of all be hirelinges the baſe ſorte of people, which finde them ſelues by their daylie trauaile, no leſſe profitable then neceſſarie, as without whome we can nether till land, plante vines, nor dreſſe gardeyns. Now if you will compare euerye kinde of trade together, and matche labour with labour, and lyuing with lyuing, you ſhall vnderſtand that the ground cannot be tilled with out the ſmithes helpe.

And there be manye thinges wherin we haue nede of the labourer, who for his hire helpeth from daye to daye, aſwell the ploughman as thartificer, and ſo getteth himſelf a liuinge.

               Of an infinite number of trades wherby we maye mentayne our liuinges, I haue reherſed a fewe, that by the conference with theſe, a man maie learne the profite of others: and ſo you ſhall perceiue that euerye citie muſte conſiſte of ſundrie thinges and ſundrie kindes of men: wherin none muſte be idle, but euerye man muſt applie him ſelfe in his vocation, and ſeeke his owne, and that in order decentlye and honeſtlye: wherby mens offices &amp; labours muſt be ſo employed, that bothe our neighbours maie be eaſed, and none other ouercharged,
            
            
               
                  The argument of the fifte Chapter.
                  That for the prouiſion and enrichinge of a citie there ought reſpect to be bad to three thinges: the inhabitauntes, the ſituation, and the borderers.
               
               
                  MI purpoſe is not to drawe forthe the plotte of a Citie, to frame houſes, to erect walles, to fence it with Bulworkes, and to ſhewe an arte howe to builde it from the beginnyng, but that I leaue to the workemaiſters, whoſe diligence extendeth to ſe that the fieldes aboute it be holeſome, large, faire, fertile, frutefull, full of ſpringes: that it be ſo frontiered, that the enemy maie not eaſilie inunde and ouer throwe it▪ that it maie haue as muche commoditie, with as little diſcommoditie as maie bee. But this is my meaning: when a Citie is once builded, then to take ſome order whereby the inhabitauntes maie by honeſte meanes be nouriſhed, one helpe another, to defende and protect the face of the common weak, which is the true formeA perfect plotte

eſtabliſhed with lawes made in ſuche ſorte, that they doe not onely reſpect the commoditie of the people, but alſo harme and endamage none other.
               But as for the ſituacion and place, it forceth much that the citie be ſo ſet, that of euerye thinge neceſſarie it maie ſerue it ſelfe, without anie bringynge in of foraine wares: and that it be not ſo barren and grauellie, that it can not maintayne the inhabitauntes, but neadeth the prouiſion and furniture of other. For a frutefull grounde by the benefite of nature, eaſely yeldeth fruite to the ſuſtenaūce of the people, neither nedeth it manie preceptes to receiue commoditie therof, ſo that it be diligentlye and ſeaſonablie tilled, whiche thinge the Romains highlie eſtemed, in ſo much that the Cenſours puniſhed thē that did not well tille their grounde, a thinge of ſuch honeſt reputacion, that ſundrie noble menne were thereof ſurnamed. As Piſones were ſo called, becauſe thei did employe theim ſelues to the ſowinge of Peaſe. Cicerones, of a pulſe called Cicer. Fabii, a fabis, that is, Beanes.

                  uli alſo were ſo named, becauſe of the deſire they had to the pulſe called Lens, that is lintelles. And Pilumni, deriued their names of this, bicauſe thei gaue peſtilles to the Backehouſes, wherewith Graine is braied in mortares. Beſides this, thei woulde that corne gotten by the ploughe, ſhould bee ſaued from ſpoilynge. For if anie of full age had either put his cattell to graſe on it in the night time, or cut it downe, it was iudged felonie by the lawe of the twelue Tables, and that if heCeres the goddeſſe of corne had bene conuicted thereof, he was hanged vp before Ceres, againſt whom theſſence was committed, and he was as ſharpely puniſhed, as if he had bene caſt for

murder. If he hadde bene vnder age, he ſhoulde hauePenalties for ſpoilyng of corne. bene whipped, or ſhoulde haue recompenced the damage ſingle or double, accordynge to the arbitrement of the head officer. The woordes of the lawe be theſe: If one of full age doe by ſtealth eate vp or cutte down corne gotten by the plough, by night, let him be hanged vp before Ceres: if he bee vnder age, let him bee beaten, or recompence the faulte ſingle, or els double it. Neither dooeth the ciuill lawe ſpare ſuche as ſpoile corne euen by negligence, althoughe thei meane no harme, which is as much in effect as the offence it ſelf.
               And therefore Paule the Ciuiliane ſaieth: If anye man ſet fire in his own ſtubble or brambles, to the intent to burne theim, and it growe further, and burne vp an other mannes corne, althoughe he did it by negligence, yet if it were on a windie daie, he is culpable, and by the lawe whiche Aquilius made, is bounde to ſatiſfie the partie: and good reaſon, for he that geueth occaſion of harme, ſemeth to dooe the harme. Secondly,How Quietnes maie bee kepte amongſt houſhandemen. prouiſion muſt be had by lawe, that if controuerſie▪ ariſe concerning meeres and boundes in groundes, meaſures may determine the ſame, ſo that ſuch meers and bounds be aſſigned by the arbitrement of certain honeſt men, whether they he meere ſtones, ſtakes, or others, &amp; ſo euerie man ſhall haue and poſſeſſe quietlie his owne without anoiynge of any other. Then that one dooe not an other iniurie by graſing, driuing, or mowing, &amp; ſuche other iniurious meanes: neither hide anie corne, for hope of a dearthe and ſcarcitie of thinges, but let euerie manne vſe the common benefite of the earth honeſtlie, and let one make an other partaker of his commoditie, and not tourne the bleſſyng of God into curſinge. A man muſt alſo marke the condicion and ſtate of the people, and the deſire whiche thei haue to gain thinges, and accordingly temper his ordinaunces and lawes, whiche muſt nedes be ſo made, that they agree cōueniently with thoſe thinges which

thei concerue. But chiefely we muſte take hede, that cuerie manne ſo applie his owne priuatelie, that it be profitable in general. For no man can commodiouſly exerciſe two Artes ſaieth Plato. If they be huſbandmen, and geuen to tillage, it hath bene declared after what ſorte they muſte vſe theim ſelues.

Whiche maie ſo be well prouided for, if thei dooe agree vpon nothinge priuately, that dothe not profite in common. For the corruption of nature maketh euerie man wiſhe better to him ſelfe, then to an other, and to thinke that moſte peculiare to him ſelf, that bringeth moſt profite. Hereupon in their corporacionsVnlawfull orders be agreed vpon in Haules of cōpanies and haules, they dooe ordeine and appoinct that whiche profiteth priuately, altogether againſt the common commoditie, as a thinge whiche might hurte their companies. Hereupon Bakers in yll gouerned

common weales, agree amonge them ſelues; that one dooe ſell no breade ſo longe as another hath anye left. Shoemakers, taylours, and linnen weauers, appoint that there be an ordinarie number of apprentices. Amonge the clothiers order is taken, that none make any clothe aboue ordinarie euerye yere. Which incommodities dooe thereupon ariſe, becauſe in ſuche corporacions for the moſt part the greater nomber is ſuche, that either knowe not their occupacions, and bee yll workemen, or els ſpende that they get in gamenyng, riottyng, and tippling: the leſſer parte be ſuche as trauaile and take great paines to get their liuynges, and to encraaſe the ſame by their occupacions.

                  te, which diſtributed to euery man accordyng as he had neade. Wee doe alſo vnderſtande many waies, that the Philoſophers neglected goodes and poſſeſſions. And therfore Socrates (whoſe opinio Plato throughlie alloweth) would in his common weale, that landes and goodes were common, which he ſaieth ſhall then be, when there maie be ſaid, this is mine, and this not myne, and all thinges common amongſt friendes. Which ſeeing is become a prouerbe:All thinges be common amongeſt friendes. that al thinges be common amongſt friendes: but it had his originall of Pythagoras as Laertius reporteth out of Timeus. But bycauſe it is daungerous ſo to addicte a man vnto an others opinion, that he ſhall holde this a ſufficient reaſon, to alledge thatWe muſte not leane to moche to other mēnes opinions. ſuch a one ſayd ſo: meete it is therfore that truthe take place before the perſon, that that may be choſe which is more probable and more agreable with the ſocietie of man (for although Plato be my friende, &amp; Socrates be my friende, yet the truth is more my friende) therefore Ariſtotle doeth full well confute this opinion of Socrates concerninge the communitie of thinges, whereby not vnquietneſſe onelye, but alſo manie abſurdities might ariſe amonge men, ſpeciallie as the worlde now, goeth, wherin it is hard ſo to kepe a mās own groūde, that another do not encroche vpon him, and with his ploughe pare awaie ſome parte therof. Certainlie ſuche a communitie woulde be hurtefullDiſcōmodities that woldgrow of all thinges were common. dothe to ſhe goddes, and men: by occaſion of diſagrement both of tillage and chieflie of parting the fruites of the earth. For who woulde be willyng firſt to ſette plough to the groūd, if an other that ſhould come laſt, ſhould reape as muche as he, &amp; chieflie of y• ground for the tillage wherof he made none accōpte: So goodes

vnregarded ſhould profit none: &amp; the prouerbe ſhould be fulfilled: that which is common to all, ſhal at lēght be no bodies. Well then graunt the grounde were quietlie ploughed: yet the fruite would not be deuided with out great trouble and diſſenſion: whiche as it would growe yearely, ſo it would be occaſion of greater debate. Beſides this the neadie ſhoulde beare the bourden, and the riche would take the profite.
               Therefore it were moſte conuenient, this opinionA proprietie is thinges is moſt allowed. reiected, that euerye man knewe his owne, that ſo the dominion of thinges might bee diſtinguiſhed among men, that euerie man mighte knowe what were his owne, what were not, that goodes might not hange in any vncertaintie. Whereupon Iuſtinian ordeyned manie Lawes for the eſchewinge of iniurie, for the getting of the dominion of thinges, that the common weale fenced therby, might ſtand in quiete, and euery man with regarde to the law, ſhould be content with his owne. And certainlye there be manie reaſons to proue that the pryuate dominion of thinges is verye neceſſary. Firſte bicauſe they be more diligentlie ſeen to: for euery mā is more affectionate toward his own, then to that whiche is another mans, ſpeciallye when we know that it ſhall deſcend to our heyres and poſteritie, which was the cauſes, why Themperour made a conſtitution that vaſſalles goodes, which eſcheted by death of the tenaunte, ſhoulde be enheritable to the poſteritie, that is, Childrē, Coſens, and heyres males. So greatlie do we delight in thinges that ſhall continewe with vs, and deſire that thei maie be preſerued. Secondlye we be taught by nature to requite ſuch as haue deſerued well of vs, whiche by our goodes maye beſt be doone. For it is not accepted to winne a friend with other mens goodes. For there were no liberalitie in that, accordyng vnto the Prouerbe: A man maie cut large thonges of an other mans leather. There be beſides theſe many reaſonable cauſes to proue that

there ought to be a priuate dominiō of thinges: which euen experience teacheth vs, &amp; there was neuer wiſe man that diſproued the ſame. Yea the hiſtories are ful of enſamples of holye fathers whereof euerie one had his owne in ſeueralle. For Abraham and Loth had ſeuerall flockes, in ſo much that when their hearde men coulde not agree (bicauſe they did ſtriue who ſhoulde ſeede theyr cattaill beſt) and the lande could not ſuffice them to dwell together: Lothe remoued to the countrey about Iordane.
               Yea, further this proprietie ſeineth to prcede of verie neceſſitie, which (as thei ſaie) hath no lawe. And it is a ciuil poinct to relieue the nedy, &amp; to coūt our goodes as though thei were not ours. Beſides this, we muſt notWee muſte ſo vſe our goodes as though thei

                  te of ſaluacions for our inſtructiō that it is marueilous harde for a riche man to enter into the kingdome of heauen. And therefore in the primatyue churche ſuche as were conuerted to the faieth, woulde rather ſell their goodes, and be without theim ſelues, then geue occaſion that others ſhould lacke. Whiche might alſo haue beene moued with this, becauſe the goodes of the faithfull were openly ſolde, and by Tyrantes diſpoyled, which they thought more profitable to conuerte vnto the common and true vſe, that is to the cheriſhement of the poore. Thus we ſee by preſidentes of Godlie men▪ that we maie haue proprieties of thinges, but ſo that we doe not abuſe them, but rather vſe theim as thoughe they were none of ours. There maie alſo order be taken by common conſent, that ſome things maie be common in a citie, ſometime vniuerſallie, ſometime amongeſt a certaine number. Whiche conuencions becauſe they be priuate▪ do not

preiudice the common lawe, neither diſpence with the proprietaries. As for example: Xenophon reporteth that Lycurgus in the Lacedemonian common weale, ordeined that the vſe of horſes and houndes ſhould be common.
               But when a proprietie was once permitted, it could not long continue vnabuſed, becauſe mannes nature is eaſilie corrupted, and wil not ſtand ſtill in one ſtaie, but euerie man is ledde after his owne fantaſie, yet ſo muche the more to be borne withall, the leſſe he hindereth the commō commoditie. For Phaleas the Carthaginian woulde that landes and poſſeſſions ſhoulde be ſo deuided, that euery Citizen ſhould haue like porcion, whiche opinion Ariſtotle reſelleth, and by many pithie argumentes proueth it to bee a meare abſurditie. For that is verie vncertaine, which is comprehended vnder a generall lawe, eſpeciallie, touching ſuch thinges as muſte be ſeuered. Moreouer, in a common weale there be diuers ſortes of Citezens, ſome keepe great familyes, ſome meane: ſome ſpare and ſpendeProd

Vnworthie men to liue, much leſſe to be amonge good Citizens, and to be ſuſteined with other mennes goodes, as ſuche that will bothe begger theim ſelues and others.

Moreouer, if this vnequall equalitie were kept, it would folowe, that when all were ſpente at Dice and bealye chere, all the citizens ſhould be driuen to ſuche beggerie,

that they ſhoulde neither be able to ſuſtaine them ſelues, ne yet to mainteine the dignitie of the common weale. Therefore it were no reaſon to eſtabliſhe anye ſuche equalitie of thinges, whereupon ſo manye inconueniences might enſue. And therfore a lawmaker muſt be verie circumſpect that he conſider the circumſtaunces of the perſones, and of thinges conuenient, and ſo conſtitute that whiche is probable, and hathe ſome reaſon whye it ſhoulde be ordeined. For as the lawe muſt be grounded vpon iuſtice and honeſtie: ſo itDecrees ought to ſtande with

Wherfore if this equalitie mencioned by Phaleas, had had relacion to the ſtate of thinges and perſons, that euerie manne accordynge vnto his dignitie and callyng, ſhoulde haue had his porcion of goodes, as he to haue the more whiche hadde a publike office, whiche coulde not for appliynge the publike affaires, entende his priuate commoditie: or he that had a great famelie, or that occupied ſome trade of greater charge (whiche is the verie equalitie of goodes by lawefull proporcion diſtributed, not by quantitie, but by equitie: and ſo ſaieth Plato in the ſixte boke of his lawes: there is an olde true ſaiynge: that equalitie cauſethEqualitie cauſeth frendſhip. frendſhippe) If Phaleas I ſaie had taken this order, theſe lauiſſhers had either nothings, or els it had bene put into their ouerſeers handes, whiche ſhoulde haue employed it vppon their wiues and children, accordyng to their neceſſities. Solon deuiſed a farre better meane, whiche entendyng to take awaye the occaſion of coueteouſnes, and vnſaciable deſire, ordeined that no man ſhould haue no more lande then the lawe permitted. Whiche the olde Romaynes followyng in their auncient frugalitie, at the demaunde of Licinius Stolo, moued that there ſhould be ſome order taken, how muche euery man ſhould haue in poſſeſſion, that was fiftye furlonges, whiche was the meaſure vſed in the common weale when it began to flouriſh,

as Plinie and Gellius dooe write.

But howe this maie be, it hath bene diuerſlye heretofore reaſoned. For Speuſippus the PhiloſopherFelicitie. defineth felicitie to be a good thing, plentifullye encreaſed with all goodneſſe, a power in it ſelfe ſuffiſing to liue wel, a perfection in all vertue, and a competencye of liuynge wherein nothinge isGoodes externall and internall

For that is good which euerie man deſiereth, not of it ſelfe, but as a furtherer to bleſſedneſſe, whiche ſome appoinct in goodes of the bodye, ſome in the minde, and ſome in riches and wealthe, as hathe been before declared. And as the Philoſophers nature is, they define their bleſſedneſſe to be ſometyme the pleaſure of the bodye, ſometyme the delectation of the minde, and at lengthe they pitche their opinions vpō quietneſſe and contemplacion, whiche is the frute of the life ſpent alway in ſtudy to ſearch out the truth, to inſtruct the mind, and to practiſe honeſty. So MaximusSermone. 6.
                  
Tyrius iudgeth that the wealth of the common eſtate ſtandeth in the well appoincted cuſtomes, and comelye gouernement of the citie, whiche can not bee without helpe of good lawes, whiche be preſerued by the godly conuerſation of the ſubiectes, whiche riſeth vpon reaſon: and reaſon, which truth maketh porfite, is ſtrenghthened by exerciſe, and trueth is learned by contemplacion and ſtudie, whiche wee employe in the ſearchyng out thereof. Whereby it commeth to paſſe, that ſuche thinges as we learne, we kepe▪ them ſurely in memorie, and being ſo kept, we vſe them well.

Wherefore we ought all to endeuoure, that we dooe not corrupt that whiche naturally is good, and cauſe meate to be poyſon, and life to be deathe euerlaſting. Whiche then wee ſhall eſchus, if wee vſe our goodes well (for as we vſe thē, ſo they be either good or euill) and permitte them not to become euill. Conſiderynge the Philoſophers plante the vſe thereof in a contemplatiue quietnes, which thereby beareth a face of bleſſedneſſe, howbeit, it is but a vayne oſtentacion, and a thinge eſtemed of worldlynges onely, neither yelding hope of any bleſſed life, nor yet honour to God. Therfore their contemplacion is meere vanitie, as a ſounding braſſe or tinkeling Cimbale, wherof the Apoſtleii. Cor. ii. maketh mencion.
               But we whiche as neare as we maie frame a common

weale in a perfect order, muſt lift vp our mindes higher, and knowe that we be men, and borne to profite man, whom we be commaunded no leſſe to loue then our ſelues, which is, when we helpe him not onlye with counſaile, and comfort him in viſitation, but alſo reloue him with our goodes: whiche we ought to vſe in ſuche ſorte, that they maie appere to be both honeſtly, profitably, and ciuilly emploied. For it can not be, but that he whiche is modeſt, pitifull, beneuolent, and a fauourer of the whole bodye politique, ſhall bee naturall and tender harted, and preſt to profite euerye man, and to hurte no bodye. Neither dothe this naturall ciuillitie, more beſeme anie man then a chriſtian, whiche ought to regarde nothing in the worlde more then the furtheringe of his neighboure.

Alſo he ſaied, that a frende is an other my ſelfe. Howbeit, for the profitynge of a common weale, this is not inough, to haue al thinges common amongeſt frendes, but alſo amongeſt enemies, ſo that

               For he with whome we haue to dooe ſearcheth the hart, requireth the hart, and not a counterfayte countinance. And therfore we muſt learne our rule to liue by, not out of the Philoſophers writinges, but out of the word of truthe. So in the fifth of Mathew: ye haueWe muſt loue our enemies. heard that it is ſayd, thou ſhalt loue thy neighbour &amp; hate thine enemie: But I ſaye vnto you, loue your enemies, wiſhe well to them that curſe you, do well to them that hate you, praye for them that hurt and accuſe you, that you maye be the ſonnes of your father whiche ſuffereth the ſunne to riſe vpon the good and euill, and ſendeth raine vpon the iuſt and vniuſte. For if you loue them that loue you, what reward ſhall you haue? do not the Publicanes ſo? Whiche ſainct PauleRoma. xii. opening biddeth vs ſeade our enemie, if he be hungry, and geue him drynke, if he be thirſtie: for ſo we ſhall heape coles of fyre vpō his heade: theſe be his wordes: if thine enemie bee hungrie, geue him meate, if he bee thirſtie, giue him drinke, for ſo ſhalt thou heape coles of fyre vpon his heade. You here that word which nether the Philoſopher could vnderſtand, nor he whiche bought the ferme, nor he that maried the wyfe, nor he that had gottē the fiue yoke of oxen, ſo that theſe when they were bidden to that great ſupper, could not goe.

But the Fiſher men here it, and they that be poore in ſpirite, merciful, gentle, peace makers, lowlie in hart, ſuch as thirſte for iuſtice: bycauſe theyres is the kingdome of heauen.
               Whiche thinges admit no diſſimulation, but belōg onelye to perfit men, and we muſte not thinke that a man maie be a true chriſtian, altho he ſuffer his enemie to die for hunger and thirſte, as they would beate into our heades whiche nether be themſelues partakers of the heauenlie kyngdome, nether ſuffer other to enter into it: for it is the worde of trueth whereof no iote ſhall paſſe vnfulfilled. Therefore if thou doeſt not feede thine enemie with meate and refreſhe him with drinke, thou ſemeſt to be a manquellour, offending againſt the lawes, and if thou be founde giltie in one, thou ſhalt be giltie in all. Whiche although they be hard to the world, ſtraunge and vnknowne to the Philoſophers: yet they be pleaſaunt vnto our heauēly father, which putteth vpon vs a light and ſwete yoke, whiche who ſo taketh vpon him (as no man ought to refuſe) his goodes be not onely cōmon to his friendes, but alſo to his enemies. For this is to deſerue well of man, this is to kepe the commaundement of the lord,Our goodes muſt be commē to the nedy and wel to vſe that whiche is well gotten, and to empart the ſame to ſuche as be in neceſſitie: which reken thou as true as Sybilles oracle, and let it not fall out of thy minde, for the ſcripture ſayeth: thou ſhalt notDeut. xv. lacke poore folke in the lande of thine habitacion: and therefore

And Ezechiell the ProphetEzech. xvi. ſaieth: Behold this was the iniquitie of thy ſiſter Sodonia, pride, fulnes of meate, aboundance, idelnes in her and in her doughters, thei did not ſtretche their haundes to the poore and neadie: and they were hygh minded and did abhominaciones before me, and I deſtroyed them as thou ſaweſt.

Therupon it is called, humanitie, a ſpeciall and peculiare vertue to man, whereby one helpeth an other, &amp;c. All we therfore be but one bodie, and diuerſe partes, but altogether to this one bodie neceſſarie. This is the lawe of nature whiche bindeth vs to all humanitie, that one ſhould helpe another as partes all of one bodie, whereby you maie eaſelie perceyue the fourme of that common weale whiche is grounded vpon Chriſte, wherein there is iuſtice, gentelnes, mercie, modeſtie, humilitie, pacience, long ſufferynge, trueth, ſteadfaſtnes, faithe, and charitie, wherein thinges are vſed according to a ciuill and honeſt moderation.
            
            
               
                  The argument of the. viii. Chapiter.
                   That the inuention of money is very commodious, the occupiyng wherof is then moſt allowable, when it ſtandeth moſte vpon honeſt dealyng.

It was not inough for man by naturall corruption to haue ben ſo muche ſeduced, vnles this other peſtelent poyſon, the cākred carke of mony,Auriſacra ſames. had enſued: for the muckering vp whereof, we trie the mines, we ſearch the vaynes of euery mountayne, we

croſſe the ſeas, we aſſaulte heauen: And we hold all the world, be it neuer ſo wide, but ſmall, and attempt to ſeke out an other worlde amonge the Antipodes, which yf we coulde finde, yet it would not ſatiſfie our greedie deſires. And that money is the onely cauſe of this euill, the vnſaciable appetite therof is a ſufficient argumēt: for haue we neuer ſo muche, yet ſtill we ſeke more, and be neuer contented. Whiche the Philoſophers perceyuinge, either eſtemed not money beholdinge the ſecretes of nature, or elles cleane wayned themſelues from the vſe of it, thinkyng that wealth conſiſted onlie in this: to deſire nothyng. And therfore Diogenes Cinicus a wounder of nature, vſed to ſaye that he paſſed the King of Perſia bothe in liuinge and goodes: becauſe he neuer lacked anye thinge, but the Kyng had neuer ynough. And Crates the ThebaneCrates hueled golde into the Sea. when he firſt entered into the ſtudie of Philoſophie, is reported to haue caſt a great quantitie of gold into the Sea, ſaying: hence ye filthie affections, I will drowne you, for feare leſt ye would drowne me. Which be enſamples trulye wherby we maye learne that it is better to be altogether moneyleſſe, and to keepe an vprightnes in mynde, then with welth to periſhe, and to be caſt into the deepe pitt of hell.
               Which ſemeth to be no new euill, but to haue begonne ſtreight vpon mannes tranſgreſſion. For Ioſephus writeth that Cain which ſlewe his Brother, theThe antiquitie of the vſe of money. ſoonne of Adam the firſt manne, filled his houſe with moneye that he had gotten by rauyne and robberye: whereby a man maie gather the antiquitie not onlye of money, but alſo of couetouſnes. But that whiche was profitablye brought in, muſte not be blamed bycauſe of our luſte &amp; intemperatenes of minde: as men that procure this enormitie, and conuert a good inuē

maie appere that the profitte of money doth not onely counteruaile, but alſo farre paſſe the diſprofite therof.
               And therefore as for this matter, many thinges doe euidentlye declare, that menne at the firſt when they ledde a ſauage and rude life, did rather purchaſe thinges by exchaunge, then by Trafficque of buiynge and ſellinge, whiche tofore I haue gathered forthe of Homer. But bicauſe thinges coulde not be alwayes matched, money by lawe, and will of the mightier ſorte, was deuiſed, by whoſe value applied to proporcion, all thinges might be bought. And ſurely it is erpedient, that the value of money be in certaine, which when itCoigne iu

               The coyninge of money is of common right dependyng onely vpon the Princes aucthoritye, whiche we call commonly currant, becauſe that it being receiued by courſe of lawe, is commonlye geuen and receiued, not onely becauſe the metall whereupon it is made is good and of the ſame value, but becauſe the common aucthoritie ſo aloweth it, whiche maketh it to be lawfully currant, &amp; in buiyng and ſelling holden after that rate. Wherupon neceſſity in time of warre hath ſomtimeIn neceſſitie of warre, Leather and braſſe haue been coigned. enforced leather or fine braſſe to be ſtamped, whiche was paied as the coigne, or the magiſtrates ſigne, ſometime for golde, ſometime for ſiluer, and in thende of the warres, when wealthe began to grow againe, ſo moche ſterlynge money was repayed for the ſame. Whiche thinge was dooen at Madeburge, a nobleAnno dn̄i M. D. Li. towne in the duchie of Saxonye, whiche in our tyme the Emperours power did beſiege more then a yeare, with many fierce aſſaultes: that I maye not rehearſe other enſamples. Nowe money commynge abroade, lawes for contractes in buiynge and ſellynge were in the common weale deuiſed, as a thing that canne not ſtand without the agrement for the price, which muſt be done by ready money. Therefore be ware that that which is ſolde, be not corrupt or faultye, or otherwiſe not aunſwerynge the promiſſe made vpon it: for faithfully &amp; without couyn, or any ſuſpicion thereof, ought on

                   to deale with another. Neither ought we onelye to vſe vpright dealynge in gettynge thinges, but alſo

in paiynge the price for the ſame. Therefore there can be no greater incōuenience in a common weale, then either to ſtampe, paie out, or to put to any man, falſe or counterfaite money, for beſides the infamy, he that ſo dothe, is worthy to loſe his life. Thoſe muſt alſo be reſtrained whiche laie in waite for money, and gatherMoney mongers. vp the good coigne, and by little and littlle bryng in the naughtye, which ere the falſhode he knowen, doth paſſe through many mens hands, and yeldeth a ſhamefull gaine to the vtterer. And thoſe alſo whiche haue founde a kinde of lucre in the conuerting and turning of their money to ſome priuate vſe. For that whiche hath more Siluer or better mettell in it, thei beſtowe vpon corne and grain, which thei will vtter dearer in an other place then they bought it. By which fraude and diſceipt euery city, euery common weale, is diſpoiled of her money, and that brought in, whiche is verie baſe, and reſembleth the exchaunge that Glaucus made with Diomede. I had almoſt forgotten another ſorte, which empaire and clippe golde and ſiluer with a file, a paire of pinſers, or waſtyng water, and by abatyng the weight, diminiſhe the value, whoſe offences are the greater, the moe thereby they doe endammage. But becauſe money was firſte inuented for the common profite, heede would bee taken that it were not miſuſed, and that thoſe coigners ſought not their owne filthye gaine, to the hinderaunce of the whole multitude, leſt the olde ſaiyng of Salomon bee founde true, that al thinges doe obey money, and thatAll thinges bee ſubiect to money. euerie man ſerueth vnder her ſtandarde. So many be there whiche be at her commaundement, or els dooe winke at and beare with thoſe that delite in practiſing this money trafficque, and thereby doe gaine vnmeaſurablye, whiche was firſte deuiſed, that euery manne might for ſellyng his ware, be recōpenſed for ſo much in value. Wherefore the chiefe magiſtrates muſte bee verye circumſpect, that this money martyng paſſe not

the limites of honeſtye, and become the groundworke of iniquitye, not without further trouble and greate enormitie: conſideryng in nothinge els there is more alluremente to coueteouſneſſe, in none moe occaſions of plague and perdicion, then in money. But let ſome meanes be founde that the canker of this couyn and diſceipt dooe creepe no further, that ſo euerye manne may ſeke the true vſe of this ſo profitable an inuētion.
            
            
               
                  The argument of the ninthe Chapter.
                   That vſurie is for manie conſideracions pestilent in a common weale, and that he is the leſſe honeſt man, whiche practiſeth it moſt.
               
               
                  WHat a miſchief, what a plague, vſurie is, where ſo euer it rooteth, euerie Houſe, euerie Citee, can well declare. Which at the verye beginning entred into the Romaine common weale, makinge the Citizins when thei had ben ſacked of al their money, to ſtande bounde neuertheleſſe for the yelding of vſurie, with ſo great a licenciouſnes, that thei were glad to reſtrayne it by lawe. Whereupon it was decreedFoenus vnciarium et centeſimū. by the lawe of the twelue tables, as Tacitus thinketh (or rather as Liuie iudgeth) by a lawe made by Marcus Duellius &amp; Lucius Menenius tribunes, that thintereſt ſhould be but an vnce, and the tweuth parte in the hundred: whiche afterwarde was made but halfe an vnce. There was alſo an other kynde of vſurie named the hundred, bicauſe the ſurpluſage amounted to aſmuche as the principall sumnie, euery hundreth moneth: for the intereſt was woun

For the amendement of whiche miſchiefe, Marcus Sempronius tribune of the people, made an ordināce that the ſame law ſhould extend to al the Latines and Romayne fellowes, to whom any money ſhould bee credited. But when this kinde of vſerie wrought continuallie many inconueniences, Iulius Ceſar, after he had recouered the Citie, for al that he held with the people, did not take awaye the vſurers tables and obligacions as it was expected, but proniding aſwell for debttours as creditours, decreed that the creditours ſhould be ſatiſfied, but after the value and rate of their poſſeſſions whiche they had before the ciuile warre; deducting all waie that which was payeable &amp; agreed vppon in reſpecte of the lone money, and ſo no manne could haue any more in credite, then could be raiſed vpō

And therfore, all diſſimulation, all falſhode, all forged pretences ſet a parte, he that hath ſtollen, let him ſteale no more: he that hath ben a fornicatour, lette him flee fornication: he that hath ben an adnouterour, let him abſtayne from aduoultrie, and bringe furthe fruites worthie of repentaunce: otherwiſe he can haue no parte of inheritaunce in heauen: for it is not ynoughe to turne from euill, and to renowme the ſinne of the bodie, vnles wee hartelie doe that is good, and bring furth the fruite of light in goodnes, iuſtice, and truth. Thus we ſee that no man ought eyther to deceyue or to oppreſſe his neighbour or any other in any kinde of conference or worldly affaires. For God is he that taketh reuengement of all theſe thinges.
               
                  When a Citie is thus clenſed of corrupt cuſtomes, let iuſtice (whiche conteyneth all vertues) take place, the grounde whereof I my ſelfe dooe take as Tullie alſo doeth, to be a ciuill kinde of credite and faiethfulneſſe, in latine called (Fides) becauſe that is in dede perfourmed,Faithfull promiſes ought to be performed. whiche was in woordes agreed vpon: ſoche trueth, ſoche conſtaneye, ought to be kept in promiſes and couenauntes. Neither doeth the common weale reſt in any one thinge more, then in kepyng of faiethfull promiſe. Which worde (as Cato reporteth) Quintus Sceuola the high biſhoppe did thinke to be taken very largelye, and to extende to manye thinges, as toHow Farre the makyng of faiethfull promiſes extēdeth. wardſhippes of children in their nonage, to ſocieties, aſſurances, commiſſions, buiyng and ſelling, all thinges hyred, lette, ſette, or betruſted, and alſo to al other doynges, wherein the ſocietie of our life conſiſteth: which who ſo breaketh, dothe offende as moche as ifWardes are bounde to hepe promiſe. he ſhould uiolate his othe: a miſcheuous dede, whiche the Grekes iudged worthy to be perſecuted euen with the verye tormentes of hell.

This vertue the Romains as it ſhould ſeme,Fides. eſtemed highlye, for that they did place (Fides) that is faiethfulneſſe, in their Capitole, as neighboure vnto their great and mightye God Iupiter. This, whether it were priuate or publike, they of olde tyme did ordeyne by ciuil lawes that it ſhould be religiouſly kept, yea, euen to the very enemye. Whiche I coulde ſette forthe by diuers examples, if this preſent treaty wold ſo ſuffer me.

                  cions, were wont to vſe, and thought beſt to burie al iniuries paſt, in perpetuall obliuion.
               It is therfore expedient for a common weale, that as few iniuries be in it, as maie be, conſideringe they be the ſeede and cheriſhment of all inward hatred and priuie grudge: or yf there be anye, to calme and qualifie them that thei do not waxe more ragyng hote, and be ſuffered to breede a mortall enemitie: Which ſhall more eaſelie be compaſſed if they be pacified while the perturbacion is but freſh and euen newly occaſioned: for ſo they ſhalbe ſhorte and light and ſoone forgottē. For according to the ſaing of Tullie: thoſe thinges beIn primo de offi. lighter which are done vpō a ſoden, then thoſe which are thougt vppon with longe deliberacion and counſayle. But when iniurie is pretenſedlye and aduiſedly done (as Plutarche ſayeth) it cometh of a weaknes ofPlutar. in vita Dionis. minde, either to hurte others, or vnlaufully to obteine that a man deſireth: the auoyding whereof euery man ſeeth is neceſſary for a common weale.
               Now for priuate reuengement▪ Chriſtians and Ethnicques vſe not one kinde of practiſe. For the Ethnicques thinke it euen as vniuſt a thing not to reuenge an iniurie done vnto them, as to do the ſame. Wheruppon there ariſeth a ſaying: who ſo reuēgeth

not a former wrounge, prouoketh another. Whiche driueth all to this ende, that we haue regarde of our honour and libertie, and ſaue our neighboures harmeleſſe. Thus ſaieth Tullie, there be two ſortes of iniuſtice:Lib. 1. de off. one of ſuche as offer it: another of thoſe who though they be able, do not defend wrong from them to whom it is offered. For who ſo vniuſtlie doth make an aſſaulte vppon any man, either ſtirred by choler, or anye paſſion, he ſemeth as with violence to kyll his felowe. And who ſo defendeth not nor withſtandeth iniurie, if he be able, is as farre in faute as if he ſhulde forſake his parentes, his friendes, or his countrey.
               But Chriſtianes ought rather to perdon wronges offered them, then to worke anye thinge that maye ſownde to reuengemente: which be commaunded by their greate pacience to ouercome the Kingdomes of the worlde: to ſhewe gentlenes, modeſtie, mildenes, lenitie and ſobrenes towardes all men: which is no ſmall point of fortitude, that theyr affections beyng ſubdued, they wil freelye remit iniuries receaued, yea not to bee offended with the taking awaie of theyr liues: ſpeciallie if that maie redound to the glorie of god and edifiyng of their neighbour: whiche in this our mortall life we muſt euer ſet before our eies and endeuour to prouoke other to dooe the lyke by our good cōuerſation: for it is our partes to ſuffer, and to leau

                  Thus ought a cōmon weale to be appoyncted, and to be furniſhed with ſuch ſubiectes as haue a bleſſed hope, that from this viſible Citie they ſhall paſſe vntoAd colloſſ. 3 that which is inuiſible, and ſhall euerlaſtinglye continew: farre vnlyke in fourme to that which the Philoſophers do ymagen: who be of opinion that an iniurie ſhulde be repelled to the ſhame and reproche of him that committed the ſame, as tho he were an infamous perſonne, and vnworthie to beare the name of a man, whiche regardeth not his worſhip, the defence of his good name to continewe bothe vnto his lyues ende, yea and afterward to his children, friendes, and countrey.

                  Concerning the gouernours or mayſters of Hoſpitalles for ſtraungers, the poore, and orphans, and how they ought to be ordered.

And therfore the magiſtrate is wel called a liuing lawe. When houſes therfore and hoſpitalles, for the poore people and trauaylers be erected, &amp; with riches accordingly endowed: there muſt ouerſeers &amp; gouernours be choſen, whiche muſt haue charge ouer them as Ioticus had, (whome Leo the emperour bi his reſcripte firſt deputed to that rowme in the citie of Conſtantinople) an office of as great profite and neceſſitie, as to be a paſtour or myniſter in the churche: as a thinge whoſe chiefe charge was wonte to be committed to Buſſhops or ſuperintendentes, as the latine terme is, that is ſuch, to whō,Superintendentes. widowes, orphans, and poore people wer committed. whervpon Ierome ſaieth: it is the glorie of a buſhop to prouide for the releife of the poore. Ambroſe alſo: The church hath no▪gold to keepe, but to laie out, and to helpe at a neade. This alſo appeareth by S. Paule which ſo oft willeth a Buſhop to kepe hoſpitalitie, to the intent that in boūtifulnes and liberalitie he maie ſurmount all others. Chriſten princes alſo when thei eſtabliſhe the aucthoritie of Buſhops, preiſtes, other churche men, and alſo holy churches, and priuileges: they oftimes mention the hoſpitalles and the maiſters thereof, as thinges not muche vnlike which the Buſſhops be vſually charged with all.

                  The argument of the ſeuenth Chapiter.
                  That where idlenes is vſed, muche vnquietnes muſt neades enſue: then that vacant time applied to ſtudie, is to be preferred before corporall labour.
               
               
                  I Haue ſondry times before declared that a common weale muſt be quiet, &amp; voide of al diſorder and cōtrarietie. Whiche ſhall then be, if euerie man be diligēt about his buſines, and no man idle. As touching whiche matter, althoughe I haue not moche before ſpoken ſome thing, yet becauſe it is a place worthie to be ſtande in, and to be well debated, I will more at full enlarge the ſame.
               There be diuers kindes of quietnes, whereof one isFowee kindes of quietneſſe. peculier vnto the learned ſorte: An other vnto men of honour and dignitie: Another is for the eaſe of ſuch as be ſtroken in yeres: The laſt is the cheriſhement of allIdlenes. lithernes, and ſluggerdie, whiche is the procurement oft times of muche variaunce and diſſencion.
               This learned leaſure and vacante time is aſcribed vnto them that employ their time to learning, and to the ſtudie of Philoſophie, in maners concerning both GOD and manne, whiche haue neade of ſoche quietneſſe of time, that they maie in the meane while apply their ſtudies, and ſo eſtabliſhe their mindes in contemplacion, that they maie attaine vnto the knowlege of the natures bothe of heauenly and earthlie thinges, ſo farre forthe as mannes knoweledge will reatche.

Therefore Ariſtotle the chiefe Philoſopher (Plato as Tullie thinketh onely except) writeth, that a mannes minde, while he is fitting, is made the wiſer. For they which are wiſe and learned do know with how great endeuour we muſte followe thoſe ſciences whiche are no leſſe comfortable in aduerſitie, then profitable in proſperitie, and euerlaſting witneſſes of the power of God. In conſideracion whereof, we do ſufficiently recompence idle time and occupie our ſelues moſte buſelye therein: accordynge vnto the ſaiyng of Seneca the philoſopher: that idle time not ſpente in learnyng, isCato de Republi. verie death and a quicke mans graue. Marcus Cato doth not in vaine call a man a buble, and Cecilius the poete ſaieth: As we be borne ſo ſhall we die, and our beginnyng hangeth vpon our endynge. Whiche vncertayne breuitie of life, we maie onlie lengthen by the benefite of learning (as a thinge inuented for poſterities ſake) and by vertuous liuing. Whereupon it ſo falleth out that thoſe idle times which we do ſpēde in learnyng, be moſt buſie &amp; beſt employed.

Suche were Numa Pompilius, Licurgus, Solon, the Scipiones, Craſſi, Q. Sceuola, the Catoes, Brutus, Hortenſius, Tullie, and all the reſidew of thoſe men whiche did helpe their Countrey with their wiſdom, counſell, &amp; all kindes of vertue: which deſired to leaue

monumentes not of their buſie affaires onely, but alſo of their time profitabile &amp; quietlie ſpent: which vacant time bicauſe it is ioined with dignitie, Tullie by theſe wordes affirmeth to bee moſte highlie eſtemed: WhatPro P. Seſt. then is ſet before theſe gouernours of the cōmō weale that they ought to tooke vnto, and to directe their trauaile during the time of their aucthoritie? that, whiche is moſt excellent and moſt to be wiſhed for of all wiſe, honeſt, and good men, I meane vacation of time with dignitie. They that will this, be all holden as principall citizens, they that cauſe it, be accompted worthie men and preſeruours of the common weale. For men ought not ſo muche to be delighted in doyng thinges, but they muſt alſo haue reſpecte to their quietnes: nether regarde anye quietnes whiche ſtandeth not with dignitie and worſhip. Tullie alſo did euer thinke the ſaiynge of M. Cato which he wrote in the beginning of his booke entituled Origenes, to be wittie &amp; worthie to be noted, that is, that noble and worſhipful mē ought to leaue behinde them a memoriall not of their buſie trauayle onlye, but alſo of their vacations: by theſe wordes: ſo if I deſire any praiſe (as I knowe not wherein) it hath ben purchaſed at Rome, and ſoughtPro Cn. Plancio. in the Courtes: the fallyng out of the cōmon affaires hath proued my counſaile true, ſo that at home I bare the ſwaie of the publicke weale and kepte the Citie quiet within the Citie.
               Whereby we may vnderſtande, howe commendadable and prayſe worthie that vacation is, whervpon the hole ornament and wealth of the common eſtate doth depende, whiche agreeth with all ſuche men, as thinke theyr lyfe to be gyuen them not for their own ſakes (for in deede according vnto the opinion of Socrates he that mindeth nothing but life is vnworthie of life) but to do ſome notable acte worthie of memorie which maie redownde to the commoditie not of them ſelues onely, but alſo of their friendes and countreye.

Suche they be, whiche be like to Epaminondas capitaine of the Thebanes, which watched, when the reſt were a ſleape. Suche they be, whiche haue alwaye in theyr mouthes that worthie ſaiyng of Scipio that is, that they be neuer leſſe idle, then when they be moſte idle. For they doe not onelie ſpende the daies, but alſo the nightes and a great parte of their ſleape in bewtifiyng and well gouerning the cōmon weale: and that which they in daylie talke and contemplation de perceiue, bewraieth it ſelfe in their ſlepe: as Tullie writeth in the ſixte booke of his common weale to haue chaūced vnto Scipio by Aphricane the elder, warning hym to omit nothyng that might ſounde to the atteinment of any kinde of vertue, whereby ſuche as deſerued well of their countrey, had a playne paſſage made them vp to heauen.

                  That there are ſome whiche for no diſcipline, for no loue of vertue, but onely for feare of puniſhement, can be brought to doe their dueties. And alſo what thei of olde tyme haue attempted to encourage others to the attainment of vertue.
               
               
                  Then ſhould common weales be fortunate, if all the inhabitauntes embracyng vertue, with a generalle conſent, did ſet their whole myndes vpon that bleſſednes, for the which the life of man was firſte inſtitute. For this is accordyng to the ſaiyng of ſaincte Paule, not to runne in vaine, but to receiuei.

Therefore ſuche anoyaunces muſt be taken awaie, whiche doe trouble the common weale, by whoſe moleſtacion the ſwete harmonie ſtandinge vpō the peaceable cōcord of the ſubiects, &amp; the general vniformitie of their liuing, may be made to farre, and brought cleane out of tune.

And ſurelye they that by holeſome preceptes, daiely exhortacions, and diſcipline, can not be brought to amendement of life, muſt in concluſion die for it, (albeit all waies of gentlenes muſt be vſed, before that this extremitie be put in execution). For better it is with an hotte yron to ſeare vp woundes when they be freſhe and rawe, then wilfullie to ſuffer the corrupcion to ſpreadde abroade, and to deſtroie the whole bodie.

Hereupon when the Romains debated vpon the defacing of Car thage, ſome counſelled the contrarie: alledging that if this Citie were deſtroyed, whiche hadde ſo renowmed their auncetours, and was a great exerciſe for theim to valiantnes and proweſſe, it might ſo come to paſſe, that when thei by reaſon of idlenes were become careleſſe and flouthfull, the common weale (armour ſet aparte) might be debilitate and weakened, and might bring vnto their poſteritie a daungerous retcheleſnes whiche in concluſion woulde be the deſtruction of the whole Citie.

Wherby we maye learne that as a good name is moſt to be deſired, ſo an euill name is moſt to be abhorred. For what is more horrible then to cal a prince Phalaris, Nero, or Herode, whoſe ſowe Octauiā ſaid that he would rather haue been, then his ſonne? what is more odious then to cal a citezin, Cateline, or Barrabas. Cōtrarily, what is more pleaſaunt then to ſurname a prince by the title of Salomō, Numa, Scipio, Camillus, or ſome ſuche other famous prince. Wherby thei are ſometime called fathers of theyr countrey, ſometyme the beſt gouernours: likewiſe when a Citezin is called by the name of Decius, Brutus, Metellus, or Mutius, it is certayne that he hath well deſerued of the common weale.
               Amonge the Ethnickes it was a buſie mattier to procure them that were naturally bente to vyces, to leaue them and to emplant in them, vertues, and to cauſe them well to lyue among good mē: which thing they went about to moue ſometime by morall &amp; philoſophicall preceptes, ſometyme by Fables, ſometyme by interludes, ſomtime by dreames of thinges which

were thought vppon before, and which repreſent vnto vs the verye reſemblance and image of ſuche thinges wherof we haue ben moſt careful: &amp; ſomtime by pains and tormētes which are prepared in hel for thoſe that be yll liuers here. In whiche poynt Socrates was ſo diligent (be it ſpoken without anye contempte of the other morall philoſophers) that he was therefore ſaid to haue called Philoſophie euen out of heauen. Eſope alſo the phrigian fabler went about the ſame thynge to brynge vs vnto a better conformitie of life, and to moue vs therunto by fables of brute beaſtes. And ofEſopes fables

                     e good maners. manie I will tell one or two. A certayne euill diſpoſed perſon wente to Apollo at Delphos and aſked him whether that which he had in his hande were aliue or no: now had he a quicke ſparow in his hande, ſo that if anſwere had bene made that it had ben alyue, he woulde haue wronge his hande together and ſo haue killed the pore byrde: but if aunſwere had bene that it had ben deade, he woulde haue caſte it furthe a liue. Therfore Apollo perceyuing the maliciouſnes of the man, aunſwered: it is in thy power whether thou wilt ſhewe it forth aliue or dead. And this fable hath this meanyng: that it is verie harde for vs to deceyue God which ſeeth euen our verie thoughtes. Another: The Lion, the Aſſe, and the Fore, wente on huntinge and gote a praye: which the Aſſe was appoynted to diſtribute, and ſo did deuide it into three equall partes: but the Lion, for that he looked for the greateſt porcion ſtomaking the matter, ſtreight wayes deuoured the Aſſe, and bade the foxe make a diuiſion: which heaped all to one for the Lion, and reſerued little for himſelfe. Then the Lion aſked hym howe he learned ſo to do: by the Aſſes miſhappe,

                   the Foxe. Wherein Eſope noted two thinges: one, that the lioniſhe ſocietie (as the lawier termeth it) whiche we haue with men of greate power and auctoritie, is alwaye wicked: and that by other mens harmes, we may learn to be wary

and wiſe.
               Gabrias alſo ment the ſame thinge in thoſe his fables compriſed in eight verſes: The Aſſe cariynge an ymage of ſiluer, the people ranne and worſhipped it: the Aſſe thought the worſhip had bene giuen to him, and therefore caſte of the parkeſadle, and woulde no lenger be an Aſſe but a God: but beyng ofte told that he was not a God, but that which he caried, he left his ſtatelines, and fell agayne to his caryage. Which fable warneth vs to be content with our owne eſtate and not lightlie to become hautie of ſtomake. So, it fortuned on a time that there was a greate conflicte betwene the beaſtes and the birdes, then the Oſtriche (which is partelie a byrde and partelie a beaſt) promiſed to ayde bothe ſides, conditionallye that whether ſo euer of the two had the vpper hande, ſhe mighte be partaker with thē of theyr victorie. But in the meane while ſhe was taken priſoner, and by her calamitie taught vs that one man cannot well ſerue two mayſters, for either ſhall he hate the one, or faythfullie fauour neyther.

So Ixion, bicauſe he did vaunte hymſelf that he had to doe with Iuno, is whirled vpon a wheele continually, for our learning, that no man ought to glorie in his euil doyng.

Which ſaiyng me thinke, is not moche to be diſalowed, bicauſe the kinges harte (as the wiſemanProu. xxi. ſaieth) is in the hande of the Lorde.

So that we maye well ſaie with Tullie, that this hath alwaye ben the opinion of theCicero. 3. de legibus. wiſeſt, that the lawe is nether a thing deuiſed by wit of men, nether any ordinaunce of people, but an euerlaſting thing, which ruleth the hole world, a wiſedom which conſiſteth in bidding and forbidding.

Alſo Numa Pompilius, to the ende he might bring the people of Rome to a ciuilitie by relligion, who were in his time rude, ſtubburne, and wilfull, after appointment of ceremonies, made manie lawes and thoſe verie profitable, whiche he mothered vpon the goddeſſe and nimphe Egeria.

In ſo muche that the verie Ethnikes affirme that the lawes yſhew out of Iupiters heade, and ſo by a reuerence borne toward the firſt fownder, they induce men to be the more ready to obeye them: which although they ſet light by mans lawes, yet let them dreade the plague of God, who as all men doe knowe, will reuenge him ſelfe vpon him that deſpiſeth his lawes, and will not wincke at mans wickednes, and ſuffer it to eſcape vnpuniſhed.
            
            
               
               
                  The argument of the ſecond Chapiter.
                  That it is moſt pernicious to a common weale for a magiſtrate deſpiſing the lawe, to affectate Tiranny, becōming of a paſtoure a very woulf, and alſo howe that no tyraunt can longe continew.
               
               
                  SOlon the Athenian Lawemaker whiche deuiſed many goodlie ordinaunces, ſpecially the remitting of debte, whereby the dettours had bounde their bodies to their creditours, (which he therfore called Siſachthia, as who ſaie, the eaſinge of a burden) the autour alſo as manie deme of that wiſe ſayinge: Excede in nothing: this Solon was wount to ſaye, that cōmon weales ſhould then proſper, whenA good Prince liueth according to the lawes. the princes and magiſtrates therein lyue accordinge vnto the preſcript of lawe, and therafter addreſſe the order of their gouernement. As the it were a thinge of to much anoyaunce (the maieſtie of the lawe deſpiſed) to affectate a ſupreme ſeigniorie, and to do al thinges by force of armes according vnto their owne will and pleaſure. Therfore it is moſte conuenient, as the philoſophers and teachers of maners doe counſell vs, and as I before haue made mencion, that he whiche muſt be a prince, be vertuouſly brought vp, and enured aſwell to obedience of lawes, as godlines. Yea he that is ſo trained vp in his youth and called to rule in the common weale, ſhalbe the better able to do his dutie in his vocation, as one that is taught by God, remembring that ſaing: So muſt thou rule others, that thou muſte know that god ruleth ouer the: as whoſe people it is, ouer whom he hath taken the charge vppon him, whoſe office muſt be, to mētaine that which is righte, to reuenge &amp; puniſh that which is wroung: indifferently to defende, riche and poore, fatherleſſe

children and widoes, not to paſſe the preſcript of the Lawe, the rule aſwell of his gouernemente as of his life: not to doe any thinge vnaduiſedly, but willingly here him that warneth him of any thinge that is honeſt and reaſonable. Such a one is he alone which in good life excelleth his ſubiectes, prouoking and alluring them to vertue by his good enſample.
               He that declineth from this order of liuing and leauing the equitie of lawe is ledde after his owne will, dothe eaſily leaſe the name of a prince, ſo that from thencefurth he can nether deſerue to be called, king, keper, our paſtour, but rather a tiraunt and a woulfe, bicauſe he cannot refrayne himſelfe from crueltie, but blodieth his handes with the ſlaughter of innocentes, deuoureth vp with his vncleane mouthe the nexte bloud of his kinredde: whiche is the propertie of aEuill Magiſtrates be trāſformed into Woulues.

The original of which monſtruous chaūge Socrates in Plato ſemeth to referre vnto a preaty fable: that like as in Arcadie about the church of Iupiter Licaeus, whoſoeuer had eaten mannes bowelles minſed with the entrailles of beaſtes that wer killed for ſacrifices, was turned into a woulfe: ſo who ſo euer delighteth to do all thinges by violence, to ſet vpon other mens liues forceably, to oppreſſe his ſubiectes, to condemne a man ere his cauſe be knowne, ſemeth not vnproperly to be tranſformed into a wouluiſhe and tirannicall nature, to the deſtruction of a great noumbre. For what other thinge maye we thinke that Caius Ceſar thought vpon, when as he beyng turned fromCeſars wicked wiſhe. a Prince to a Monſter, and deſtroyer of mankynde, oftimes in his furie pronoūced theſe wicked wordes? woulde to God that the people of Rome had but one necke.

               Yet perchaunce ſome comfort maie bee had, in that thei pretende a colour of popularitie and gentleneſſe: No, no, that profiteth no deale, for that ſoche be onely cautelles and miſtes, which can not ſo blinde euen the moſte ſimple, but that thei perceiue ſoche to bee onely entrapmentes, to bryng ſoche as beleue the ſame into the ſnare, and daunger of their liues. Beſides this, Cato Vticenſts was wounte to ſaie, that there wasThe peoples fauour to dangerous. nothyng ſo hurtfull, nothyng ſo vnconſtaunt, as was the peoples fauour, thenheritaunce wherof was ever

pernicious to their poſteritie. So that thei maie ſeme verie vnwiſe, whiche deſpiſyng or caſtyng out the nobilitie, had rather hang vpon the people, and commonaltie, then followe theim, by whom thei mate take profite. For it is the Princes aduauntage, to haue his ſubtectes, and thoſe by whom his Princelike porte is mainteined, to be wealthie, and not ſoche a meany of raſcalles, whiche bee pinched with pouertie them ſelues, and more redy to make an vprore, then reuerētly and godlily to obeie their Magiſtrate. For thei knowe well inough, although thei be but ſimple, how daungerouſly a manne thruſteth hymſelf into a tirauntes handes, with whō, although you liue in high fauour, yet you alwaies ſtande in feare, bicauſe he thinketh that no manne ought to bee ſpared, but either put to death, or brought into thraldome.
               Moreouer, who ſo euer cometh to a tirantes houſe, becometh his bondman, although he came thither fre, accordyng to the ſaiyng of Sophocles: whiche ſaiyng, the greate Pompey vſed to his wife and ſonne, when as he after the fielde foughten in Pharſalia entred in to the Fiſhers boate, ſent vnto hym from the kyng of Egipte, therein to eſcape his waie forthe of daunger: at the very goyng forthe of his veſſell, as forſeyng his deſtructiō, he ſpake as enſueth: Who ſo euer goeth vnto a tiraunte, becometh his ſlaue, although he came to hym free. For whiche reaſon, it is better to bee without acquaintaunce of ſoche a one, whoſe fauour is verie death to the partie: to whom nothyng is pleaſant, nothyng delectable, but that whiche is the vtter deſtruction of menne: As Hiero the kyng of Sicile confeſſeth to Simonides in Xenophō, in a long diſcourſe.

Whence hate of honeſtie, contēpt of iuſtice, loue of iniquitie, and the vtter diſdain of the cōmon weale, nate, I would ſaie of al mankind, is deriued. So little goodnes or ſinceritie is there to be hoped for at his handes, that is not fortified with the rā

For this is the life of tirauntes, ſaieth Tullie, that is, ſoche, wherein there is no faith,Cicero in Lelio. noloue, neither can therebe any ſtedſaſt confidence of good will, nor any place for friendſhip, whē al thinges be had in gelowſ

Therfore it is a good conſequente, that he whiche is thought vn worthie of all mennes loue, is ſubiecte to all mennes hatred, and that onely feare is the cauſe of his ſafetie, whiche is but a ſlender warraunte of continuaunce.

horſes vnbroken will praunce, waxe headdie and couragious, inſolently troublyng and tumblyng all thinges vpſide doune. So that a Prince maie rather ſeme to bee a beaſt, ſent in by Ate, of whō Homer ſpeaketh, to trouble mannes life, then a right noble man, which either deſireth to deſerue well of menne, or can ſhewe any fruicte of his gentle blood, accordyng vnto his calling. This licenciouſnes, whereby (as Terence ſaith) we become all the worſe, if it be ſupported by wealth, it is the firſte degree to iuſte and riotous liuyng: then the companie of naughtie acquaintaunce, whoſe euill diſpoſed talke, vſeth to corrupte well diſpoſed condicions: then a garde readie to all vnhappines: and a deteſtable compaignie of Courtiers: Finally, thus you can lacke nothing, that can further you to wickednes, and prouoke you to applie your ſelf to tirannie. For this is the very trainyng vp of a vicious prince, whervpon many, as it were from the Troian horſe, doe iſſhewe, whiche delight not onely to anoie the common wealthe, but alſo to ſet all the worlde on a fire: whiche deſeruyng ſo ill of men, can not loke to be well reported of. For it lieth in the Prince, ſaith Philip the king of Macedonie, whether he will be wel or ill ſpoken of. But it is princelike for well deyng, to be miſreported.

For they onelie looke to be rewarded and recompenſed for their perſuaſions and flatterie, without anie care of the good ſucceſſe of the common weale. Yea further abuſinge the Princes gentlenes by their fawning officiouſnes, they will not ſticke through occaſion of familiaritie, to ſell for ſoms of money his good will, &amp; to promiſe to bryng thinges to paſſe of great importance. As Helius Lampridius writeth of one Zoticus whiche miſuſing the name of familiaritie ſolde all Heliogabalus his wordes and deedes, like as if a man woulde ſell ſmooke, hoping to haue ben therby highlie rewarded, and thus promiſing many, beguiled all.

               Flatterie therfore is a pernicious thinge, and doth as ofte ouerthrowe a Princes power, as his enemie: and it is better as Antiſthenes ſaithe, to fall amonge rauens, then flatterers: for they onely ſpoyle and deuoure the dead, but theſe deuour the liuing. And therfore Mamertius cōmended Iulianus the Emperour for that he was armed againſt al entiſementes of flatterers, nether could be miſcaried for all their coloured venim. Which if manye princes woulde likewiſe do, their ſhould be moche more iuſtice and quietnes in the common weale, and leſſe iniquitie.

So muſte the rodde that is layed vpon the people, at lengthe be laied vppō the fier. Furthermore theſe vicious princes be not in ſafegard of their garde, no not of their owne wiues and children, but alwaie dreade leſte that violence whiche they extende vpon other, ſhalbe returned vpon them ſelues: but in vaine, when as they cannot eſchewe the neceſſitie of their fatall ende. In place of manie, note well this one example: In what mynde do we thinke ſayeth Tullie, that Alexander Phereus

Oh wretched man that he was, who thought a Ruffiane and one marked with an hote yron, more truſtie then his owne wife. Nether yet was he beguiled, for ſhe ſlewe him in deed at the length for ſuſpicion of horedome. Dioniſius alſo the Siciliane by this example proued that verye greate daunger doth hange ouer Princes heades, when as Democles a flatterer had commended the eſtate of Princes, he cauſed a coſtlye ſupper to be made, and Democles in princely robes to

                   That it is a moſt execrable thinge that warres ſhoulde be moued amongeſt Chriſtians as forbidden and moſt diſagreable to our relligion.

But none ſhall more clearlie perceaue this then ſuch as delight in al mens weldoyngs, in the loue of honeſtie and godlines, and wiſhe the honour of all Chriſtēdome. For what thing can moue an honeſt hart more to lament the eſtate of our relligion and the extirpacion of all humanitie, then this outrage of warres? for the incumbraunce wherof no ſocietie of men, no common weale, can be eyther cōſtitute or preſerued in ſauetie, but all things be ſet out of order, al thinges be brought to ruine and decaie. As tho the deſtinies ſo ranne, that what kingdome ſo euer ſhould decaie, ſhoulde firſte be prouoked with warres, that by her owne euilles ſhe might vnderſtand that no miſerie goeth alone, but one draweth another with it, that all ſoche calamities maie ſeme to haue fortuned to the people for their deſertes.

Whiche therfore muſt oftimes be put in remembrance that the good maie learne by the euill, how ſhameful and vnhoneſt a thing it is not dulie to execute that highe vocation, which is appointed them from God, to repleniſhe euery place with bloud and manſlaughter, to regard a ſubiect no more then an enemie. Wheras euerie good Prince woulde rather according vnto the good zeale of Scipio Africanus the elder, ſaue a thouſand enemies, then

For God knoweth the nūber of our heares whiche is the leaſt thing in man: and will require the harme of one that is iniuried, at his handes whiche doth the iniurie.

               Learne therefore ye that be aduaunced to ſo highe an eſtate by God, that ye maie both ſtande in the ſtede of goddes, whiche are renoumed for the benefites employed vpon men, and alſo maie gouerne his people with iuſtice, meakenes, and clemencie (whiche moſt

becomme princes) as experience teacheth: and learne alſo that ye be men your ſelues whiche in the great daie of the Lord muſt yelde the greater accompt, the higher the vocation is wherunto ye be called, when it ſhalbe no excuſe to ſaye: I thought not ſo. Moche leſſe then oughte you to thinke that he whiche pulleth downe the proude and highe minded and placeth the humble in their ſeates, will ſuffer himſelf to be deluded. Let clemencie therfore and pietie the onlie ornament of a prince, ſtand before your eyes, for it doth alwayes eſteme the common profit before the priuate, it cauſeth a good prince to be deſirous not onelie to be called a father of his countrey, but alſo a Citezein. As Claudian writeth to the Emperour Theodoſius:
               
                  Thou citezen and parent art,
                  care thou for eche degree:

An enſample whereof, maie conueniently be taken from emong the Ethenikes. For Alexander of Macedonie, ſurnamed the Great, when his mother Olimpias required him at her inſtaunce, to condempne an innocent, ſaied vnto her: Mother, aſke ſome other gift, for mannes helth and life, can not bee counteruailled with any recompence.

That the common weale beyng well gouerned, thei maie liue well in the ſame: as Homer writethIn. 9. Iliados of Achilles in Greke, whiche the famous Clerke Elius Eobanus Heſſus, thanſlated into Latin, thus:

For whiche ende euery good man will arme him ſelf, that his houſholde, wife, and children, maie liue in ſauetie, and that the name of God maie be called vpon in this quietneſſe.

               Neither did Marcus Portius Cato ſaie vnaduiſedlie, that the common weale ought rather to bee enlarged by vertue, then armes, in theſe woordes: doe not you thinke, that our predeceſſours made this common weale, where it was ſmall, greate, by force of armes: for if it ſo were, it ſhould bee now moche more enlarged, conſideryng wee bee better furniſhed with fellowes, citezeins, harneis, and horſes, then thei were.

               Whiche kinde of life, the exhortacions vſed in holy ſcriptures, require to be in vs, that one doe not offend an other, nor circumuent him in his doinges: but that by vprightnes of life, we prouoke the euill diſpoſed to a better iudgement: not as though there were no further reſpecte to bee had, then to a politique and ciuill kinde of life, but that we alſo looke for the fruict of the ſpirite, whiche is charitee, peace, iuſtice, godlines, and finally, then heritaunce of heauen.

After this maner we haue peace giuen vnto vs, which we ought not to conuerte to deliciouſnes and pleaſure: but therin to ſeeke ſoche quietnes, as maie likewiſe moue vs, to take like delight in the lawe of GOD, by grace in Chriſte.

                  That Lawes can not bee made abſolute in all poinctes, for the wel gouernyng of a cōmon weale, but that the Magiſtrate muſt ſupplie many thinges: then how that conſultaciō is very profitable.

To whoſe opinion to aſſente herein, there neadeth no greate perſwaſion. For who ſo dooeth but lightly note the alteracion of thynges, the circumſtaunces and qualities of euery place and countrey, and the trade how thei mainteine theim ſelues: ſhall perceiue that a generall rule maie indede be applied to the gouernement of al, but it can not in all poinctes be ſufficiēt in al. So ſaieth Terēce: Sondrie diettes cauſe ſondrie kindes of liuyng. Neither is it to bee thought that mannes minde will alwaie ſtande in one ſtaie: for it burſteth out, and counterfectyng nature, cauſeth diuerſe ſhapes, and moueth

                  ges of thinges, ye ſhall perceiue generall Lawes to helpe, and to be, as it were, an entraunce &amp; introducciō vnto good gouernement, but when newe matters &amp; new buſineſſe ariſe, thei be not ſufficient throughly, but there is required the politique practiſe, wiſedome, and forecaſte of a Magiſtrate, which is a conſcionable and iuſt dealer, whiche deſireth to vſe indifferencie towardes all men, whiche bryngeth all thinges into ſoche an order, that euery man will ſeke his owne aduauntage, without annoiaunce to any other, and doe nothyng either vnhoneſte, or contrary vnto the ciuill ſocietie. Yea, Iuſtinian hath thought it expediente, that when any controuerſie happeneth, whiche can not bee ruled by the old lawes, newe ſhoulde bee then ordeined in that caſe.
               Furthermore, he that inſtituteth and formeth a cō

So many thynges as well vnprofitable as profitable, doe in proceſſe of tyme, crepe into the common weale, which muſt be ſpedelie ſeen to, either that thei maie be tourned to good, or els redreſſed in ſeaſō. As for enſample:An example cakē of victualle. victualle, howe neceſſarie a nouriſhemente it is for man, all men knowe, and therefore by ordinaunces of longe tyme, there hath been prouiſion made, that it might eaſely be had frō one to an other. And although there be certaine prices ſet vpon victualles, neuertheleſſe when dearthe cometh, that conſtitucion muſte

                  ger (as ther ſaie) breaketh the harde walle. For auoydaunce wherof, a magiſtrate ought to prouide in time, and to ſet the prices at ſoche an aſſiſe, as bothe the ſellers maie not bee endammaged, but their trauaile and expenſes conſidered, and the other citezens ſerued, accordyng vnto the tyme of the yere. Whiche ſtandeth chiefly in corne and fleſhe. For if thei be good cheape,Corne and fleſh be counted the chieteſt prouiſion of victualles. nothyng is accompted deare. As Socrates, when one complained vnto hym that all thinges were deare at Athenes, as Purple, Wine, and ſoche deinties, ſaied, that there coulde no dearthe bee rekened on, when Meale and Oile were ſold good cheape. So likewiſe, when the craftines of Merchauntes, Artificers and other occupiers, beginneth to bee preiudiciall to the citezens (as at this daie, vpon a gridie deſire many doe practiſe, pretendyng equitie and lawe) then muſt a magiſtrate bee diligente in reſtraining ſoche inordinate gaine, and the occaſion of ſoche priuie conueighaunces, whereby theſe enormities burſte out into mannes life, to bryng all thynges to an equall proporcion, and by wiſedome foreſee, that no ſoche coueteous appetite be ſatiſfied. Wherein he muſt neither haue reſpecte to perſone, couſtome, couſinage, nor freindſhippe. Our kinſfolkes, freindes, and benefactours, bee in deede deare vnto vs, but we muſte loue the common weale, farre aboue theim all. The other happen vnto vs by nature, but god cōmitteth this vnto vs to be well gouerned. The contempt whereof, in reſpect of any perſone, or through negligence, is to be coumpted a more vnnaturall acte, then to ſtaine our handes with mannes bloode.

Whence to ſwarue were a mere wickedneſſe, and not ſo moche to regard a publique matter plāted by nature her ſelf, as a priuate, and for affection ſake, as it were, to ſet to ſale the impartyng of commodities. Wherevpon Plato wiſheth, that the common weale bee neuer committed to the gouernement of a ſimple or vnconſtaunt witte: but to hym alone that is of an high courage, vnfearfull, vncorrupte, louyng equitie and goodnes, whiche regardeth no more one then an other: of whom there hath been diuerſe, and we alſo at this daie haue many teſtimonies, that thei haue bothe well inſtituted, and well ruled ſondrie common weales. But lette vs onelie conſider the Lacedemoniane common weale, whiche was ſo well gouerned, that it was accompted the perfiteThe Lacedemonians vsed. no written Lawes. Image of all vertue: yet neuer vſed thei there any written lawes: In ſo moche that this is reported to be one of the aunſweres that Lycurgus broughte from Delphos, as an oracle, that thei ſhould vſe no written Lawes. But all thoſe thynges, whiche might ſeme to further their common weaie to an happie eſtate, and their people to vertue, thei eſtabliſhed in the maners of their citezeins and order of life, whereby thei continued without any chaunge, and that in ſoche ſucceſſe, that the common ſaiyng was: The Athenians bee alwaies writyng of Lawes, but thei neuer keepe any: But the Lacedemonians neuer write Lawes, but alwaies kepe them.
               I coulde alſo here recounte diuers other common weales, which be ruled more by old aunciet cuſtomes then by any forreyne lawe, and yet be wel gouerned: And whiche (conſidering the corruption of the tyme)

               Moreouer a magiſtrate ought to be politicque and ciuil, whoſe function, Plate, Xenophon, Ariſtotle, Heraclides Ponticus, Cicero, and ſo many philoſophers as haue writen of common weales, will ſufficiently declare, altho that nether nature did moue a mā therunto, nor that ther were any preceptes of law writtē. Yet this muſt be added as a finall conſummating of our doinges and trauayle, which apperteyneth vnto the ſcriptures, and Chriſtiane life: That Goddes lawes muſte be ioygned with mannes ordinaunces, the tenne commaundementes muſte be kepte, idolatriePolitike ordinaunces muſte not diſagree with the lawes of God. &amp; wicked worſhipping, muſt be rooted out, Gods worde muſt euerie where be preached in churches inſtituted for godly purpoſes, morall diſcipline muſt be obſerued, ſcholes muſte be diligentlye ſeene to, that youth may be trained vp in good learning and knowledge of the tounges, for the vnderſtandyng of goddes worde, for the rulyng and gouerning of the common weale, and ſpecially for the ſettyng furthe of goddes glory. Which is the chiefe cauſe why God would that mans life ſhoulde be ciuill, and commaunded the magiſtrate as a more honorable perſone, to be the keper &amp; preſeruer thereof, vpon whom as vpon a glaſſe, we are bounde to looke, to learne of him a perfecte trade of life, and to embrace with all our hartes that whiche he ordeineth for the common commoditie.
               And ſurely I cannot finde that their is anie thing more profitable for the eſtabliſhment of ſoche thinges wherby a cōmon weale is adourned, &amp; daylie holpen, then a parlemente godlily aſſembled. Which forſeeth y• nothing be done with temeritie, nothing without a ſpeciall conſideracion, whereof either any man may

haue cauſe to repent, or afterwardes lamente that thinges haue no better ſucceſſe. For in Monarchies, altho the eſtate conſiſte vpō one alone, yet y• one muſtPrinces ought to vſe conſultacion in their doinges. not be ſo raſhe, as to contemne the Counſell of good men, and by himſelfe to enacte, and appoint thoſe thinges to be done which appertaine to gouernemēt, and wheruppon an enſample geuen to be folowed of a great number, dependeth. And this is the meaning, wheras I ſaid before that a Prince hath manie eyes: and the common ſaiyng is, that manye eyes ſee more then one: as thoughe when a thinge is on all ſides throughlie knowne, and all circumſtaunces well debated, it were more eaſie to take order for it.
               So we ſe that ſaying which Socrates highely cō

               Then can not the wicked, and ſoche as ſeeke onelie their owne commoditie, couetous, dronkardes, vnfaiethfull, hoorehunters, vniuſte, and vngodlie perſones, euer giue any good counſaill, vnleſſe it be againſt them ſelues, as Caiphas did to the Iewes, that it wasIoan. 19. expedient that one man ſhould dye for the people.

                  The argument of the third Chapiter.
                  That ſoche a Magiſtrate doeth his duetie, and gouerneth a common weale in good order, whiche rooteth all vice out of it, and reduceth it vnto integritie of maners.
               
               
                  IT is not vnwiſely ſaied, that a mā maie as well know the magiſtrate by the ſubiecte, as the Lion by his pawes: for that moſte of the people bee ruled and affectionated, according as the Magiſtrate giueth thē an example. Whiche vocacion he doeth well execute, whiche is hym ſelf a good man, and mindeth the common aduauncemente of all: not in faire woordes, but in verie deede, whiche one thing chiefly cōmendeth an Officer. For that ſhall edifie nothing in the congregacion, whiche thaduouterer ſpeaketh in commendacion of chaſtitie, the dronkarde, of ſobrietie, the vſurer of honeſt gaine, the couetous man, of deſpiſyng riches, the wicked, of vertue, and the lier, of truth. Shall not he rather finde ſome, that will laugh hym to ſcorne, then be reformed by his talke, whiche procedeth not from his harte, but onelie from his lippes? For in deede he is no good teacher,

whiche teacheth onely by wordes, and doeth not vſe hymſelf honeſte in life, that he maie bee without fault hymſelf, that will finde fault with other. For ſo ſhall his ſpeache bee liuelie, and his woordes the ſhadowe of his deedes, as Democritus the Mileſian ſaith. For wherevpon cometh the corrupcion of Citees, the libertie of life, but by the Magiſtrates negligence? Whiche oftymes ſetteth his mynde more vppon common banquetyng and feaſtyng, then that he wil ones waighe what belongeth to honeſte liuyng, and good gouernemente. Likewiſe maie one iudge of mannes impietie, whiche daiely more and more encreaſeth, bicauſe the woorde of God is not liuely in vs, but when it is heard, it is not regarded: but our buſines lieth, in feaſtyng, hoorehuntyng, riottyng, bachityng, blaſphemie, and a thouſande kindes of fond vanities. And in the meane while thei winke hereat, whoſe duetie were to lifte vp their voices, to counſaille vs, to moue vs, to correcte vs, and not to ceaſe, vntill ſoche time as thei ſawe either amendemente of life, or els iniquitie after a ſorte, vanquiſhed in their Churche.
               Whiche enormitie ſcholemaiſters alſo encreaſe, for

And if thei take to their tuiciō any well nurtered &amp; tractable children of the parentes, thei ſende theim home euill manered, and more diſſolute then thei wer when thei came to theim: ſo that it were as good in maner, that the childe were brought vp in an houſe of bauderie, or taught ſome lighte occupacion, without expenſe of money, then ſo dearelie to buye ſoche corrupcion of maners. For there be certain principles of vertue naturally laied in manne, but vnles thei be ſtirred vp by

diſcipline and godlie exerciſe, cōcupiſcence of the fleſh, deſtroieth theim, and maketh man prone to euill, and a follower of wickednes.
               And what cōmon weale is there at this daie wherin good and ciuill ordinaunces be not diſpiſed, and in their place, murther, vſurie, couetouſnes, deceit, iniurie,All wickednes reigneth through the negligence of magiſtrates. robbery, fraud, vniuſt dealyng, aduoutrie, blaſphemie, drunkenneſſe, contempt of Lawes, and all wickednes, do reigne? wherby their can litle ciuilitie be founde in mans life. But admit there be ſome good (as there is no aſſembly ſo deueliſhe wherein are not ſome whiche fauour vertue) ſoche horrible iniquitie beareth ſwaie, that what vertue ſo euer be mixed ther with, it lieth ſhadowed as a roſe among brambles: ſo that it maketh a ſhewe onely of vice, and of no vertue. Hereupon come theſe miſeries, heruppon good men complaine, that there is no iuſtice nor equitie amōgſt men. But that all thinges bend to decaye and ruine, which as acceſſaries &amp; handmaides of iniquitie, theſe miſchieues incontinent followe: peſtilence, famine, warre, robberyes, ſlaughter, waſt of all thinges, and all kinde of plagues that we ſe fall vpon vs.
               Which calamitie as it cometh by the peoples ſinne, ſo by amendement of life and earneſt calling vppon God, it may be turned from them. A magiſtrate therfore muſte be vigilaunt in his office, and doe his endeuour all that he can to ſuppreſſe the wicked, for which cauſe he beareth the ſwerde. The good men whiche ſtaie vpon vertue, muſte call vpon God, and procure the preſeruacion of the hole, for ſo muche as oftymes hole Cities for one or two good mens ſakes, haue ben ſaued from deſtruction.

                  ied, and canonized among ſainctes, whiche (as the cronicles doe teſtifie) the very vileſt and the moſte wicked menne on the earth achieued. Thei mighte haue borne the names of the monethes of the yeare, and mighte haue limitted the times, as Ianuarie, Maye, Iulie, Auguſt: and thei mighte haue had many ſoche like fantaſticall prerogatiues: But for all their glory thei obteined only this, that ſome of their names be kepte in remembraunce, but al their worthie actes be cleane forgottē.
               But we whiche haue learned a better leſſon, dooe ſerche for that waie whiche leadeth vs ſtreight vnto vertue, endowed with true giftes, whiche is but one and that certaine, declared and opened not by mannes lawes &amp; Philoſophicall tradicions or by vncertaintie of opinions, but beyng framed accordinge to goddes will, bringeth vs into that pathe of life, wherby we may ſafely paſſe vnto the true ende, whiche is the enheritaunce of the heauenly kingdome, for whiche we enter into this world, and ioyne together in ſocietie,

for whiche we be cōmaunded to loue our neighbour, to worſhip God, and to obey his commaundementes.The perfect path to true felicite. And therfore we be exalted aboue other earthely creatures, not farre vnder Aungels in degree, vnto vs all other worldly thinges be ſubiecte, eyther for ſuſtināce of bodie, or for ſome other vſe, and declare the fatherly loue of our Creatour towardes vs.
               From which lore and trade of liuinge, howe moche ſoche princes as had euen a certaine zeale of vertue in them, declined, it doth appere by many examples. For they ſought onlie the enlarging of their dominions, the beautifiyng of their Cities with fayre buildinges, that thei might be as marteplaces for the encreaſe of worldly wealth: and if there were any point of vertue required therin, that did thei vſe in outward ordinaunces. And to this end tended Iulius Ceſares ſayinge: if Lawe oughte to be broken, for rule ſake it ought to be broken. Auguſtus Ceſar alſo vaūted that wheras he receiued the Citie of Rome builded with bricke, he left it richely adourned with marble. And Adriane the Emperour moſt modeſtly of all ſaid, that he would ſo rule the common weale, as one that knew the eſtate thereof not to belong to himſelfe, but to the people, wheras in deed it did nether belonge to him, nor to the people, but to God. Whiche thinge is comenly ſene in moſt common weales at this day, whoſe ſpeciall care is, that their tounes be well waulled and entreanched, that thei be fayre builded, that the Citizens may haue a redie vent and a continuall trade to enriche themſelues, altho it be to their neighbours great hinderance, as men that regard thēſelues more then any other: that thei haue peculiar lawes, be they right, be thei wronge: for there is no ſoche great reſpect had to Iuſtice, whiche in deed tendereth all in generall, not vnderſtandings that ſoche ciuill lawes be but vaine: and that it is ſaid: woe be vnto them which make wicked lawes: for theyr onely deſire is that one

halfpenio may make another, &amp; that vſurie maie grow vpon vſurie. And as Piſinires do gather all their prouiſion vnto one heape, ſo thei craftilie circumuenting other men, pike from thē their goodes, &amp; late the together. So vnſauery be thei that thei haue no taſt, no delight in true honeſtie, nor in goddes holie preceptes.
               Wherupon it ſo falleth out, that euerie one walketh after his owne concupiſcence, for all the Philoſoſophers doctrine, whiche is I graunt neadfull for politique gouernance, but yet muſte be ſeazoned with goddes law, otherwiſe it ſhalbe the waie to death and not to life. For thus ſaieth Chriſt, the onely teacher ofMath. 19. &amp; 15. trueth, the onely maiſter of our life: if thou wilt entre into life, kepe the commaundementes of God. Alſo: thei worſhippe me in vaine, teachyng doctrines and commaundementes of men. And Hieremie ſaieth: bicauſeHierem. 9. thei haue left my lawe, which I gaue them, and haue not heard my voice, but followed the wickednes of their owne hartes: beholde, I will feede this people with wormewoode, &amp; will ſende a ſworde emong thē, to perſecute them, vntill I bring thē to naught. Again in Mathew: The ill be will deſtroie, and he will letteMath. 21. foorthe his vineyard to other houſe bandmen, whiche ſhall deliuer hym the fruicte in due ſeaſons, and the kingdome of God ſhall be taken awaie from you.

There is an other kinde of pouertie, whiche in deede proceadeth vpon lacke of ſubſtaunce, whiche is ſuſpected and contempned in the common weale for many conſideracions: as for not being allowed for ſufficiente witneſſe hearyng, for not beyng able to heare offices, for the eaſie prouocacions to offende, and ſoche like, as a man maie finde in the ciuill lawes. ThroughEccleſi. 27. pouertie ſaieth Salomon, many haue offended, Further, pouertie is an allurement to rebellion. For Abimelech when he conſented to the ſleyng of his brethrē, and getting the kingdom, tooke money out of Baales churche, and hired therewith the poore people and vagaboundes, whiche (beyng driuen to get ſomething) toke his parte.

               Nothing is profitable in deede, vnles it be honeſt.
               It is againſt the courſe of nature to enrych our ſelues by the hinderaunce of other.
               Goodes well gotten, are commendable: and men of greateſt wealth, be ſubiecte to moſte caſualties.
               One Chriſtian is bounde to releyue another.
               There be foure māner of waies to mentayne our lyuing: that is: either by landes and poſſeſſions, by craftes and ſciences, by buying and ſelling, or elles by dailie labour.
               For y• enriching of a citie there ought reſpect to be had to three thinges: the inhabitauntes, the ſituacion, and the borderers.
               As a proprietie in thinges is moſt conuenient, So to appoint an equalitie, were a meare abſurditie
               The inuention of money and the true vſe therof.
               Vſurie is prohibited by al lawes, and how peſtilēt a miſchief it is to be practiſed in a cōmon weale.
            
            
               The ſeuenth Booke.
               Great wealth oughte not ſo much to be eſtemed in a Citie, as godlie lawes and good orders.
               
                  Blaſphemous ſweares &amp; drunkerdes ought not to be ſuffered in a common weale.
               Iniuries, howe farre they are to be borne withall: &amp; that it becometh chriſtians to forget olde diſpleaſures.
               How a pernitious a thing ſedition is, and the chief cauſes that moue men to rebellion.
               Loyterers and ydle vagaboundes muſte either be forced to worke for their liuinge, or els be baniſhed the countrey.
               Prouiſion muſt be had in hoſpitalles, ſpittelles, &amp; other cōuenient places, for the reliefe of poore people.
               We be allured by manye meanes to embrace vertues.
               Dreames, although they be moſte comenlye but mere fancies, yet ſometimes we bee warned thereby to dooe that is good, and to eſchewe that is euill.
            
            
               The eight Booke.
               Mans conſtitucions muſt not diſagre from Gods ordinaunces.
               What a plague it is to y• people to haue a tiraunt to be their gouernour.
               Tiranny procedeth of impietie.
               Iuill magiſtrates be ſet to rule ouer the people, for their iniquities ſake.
               No tiranny is of long cō
                  tinuaunce.
               What miſeries and miſchieues warres do brede amongſt Chriſtians.
               What calamitie hath fallen vppō al chriſtendom, by ſuche warres and rebellions as haue ben vniuſtlie moued.
               Warres worke the death both of bodie and ſoule.
            
            
               The ninthe Booke.
               The manifolde commodities of peace &amp; quietnes.
               No Lawe can be made ſo abſolute, but that many thinges muſt needes be referred to the Magiſtrates diſcretion.
               Princes ought to publiſh nothing, but vppō good deliberacion &amp; counſaile.
               It is the office of a good magiſtrate, to roote out

all vices, and to 
                     ••
                  plant vertues in a Common weale.
               Chriſtians ought to bee more perfecte in politike gouernement, then the philoſophers traditions do appoint.
               Many floriſhing common weales haue fall
                     •
                  n to ruine, for lacke of the knowledge of God.
               The whole courſe of our life in this world ought to tende toward the true felicitie, that by the vniformitie of all our doynges, a brotherly loue and perfect peace maye raigne amongſt vs.
