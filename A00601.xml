            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

            TO THE
CATHOLIQVE
Christian Reader.
            
               Courteous Reader:
            
            
               A Few daies since a friend of mine
shewed me a Booke intituled a
Parallel, which I gladly receiued
from him, and perused
it the more readily, because I
well hoped, that some of the
Parallel lines would sute to our Meridian. But
taking an exact view of them, and applying them
to our Horizon, I found they were somewhat
short of our Eleuation: yet I discouered some
thing drawne in those Parallels, which I conceiued

to be of some vse, to wit, the Lineal descent of
Arminius by the half bloud at least, frō 
               Pelagius;
for if it be confessed, that Arminius his pedegree
is lineally to be deriued from Pelagius, and that
Pelagius is the great Apenninus, from which the
diuided streames of corrupt doctrine flow; then
vndoubtedly the assertions of Arminius were
priùs damnatae, quàm natae were condemned
by the Catholique Christian Church, before they
were brought forth by Arminius: And we haue
the Prescription of the Christian world, for more
than 1200. yeares, against the new encroachments
of these Sectaries. But me thinks I heare
thee ring in mine care the peale of the Poet,
Ole quid ad te? what is this to thee, or me? or to
the matter now on foot? It is not Arminius, but
an Appealer that troubles our Israel; Aemilius
fecit, plectetur Rutilius? Aemilius hath done
wrong, shall Rutilius beare the blame? Because
Arminius browseth vpon some branches of Pelagianisme,
(a plant which our heauenly Father
neuer planted, and therefore in time must be rooted
out) is it reason, the Appealer should be
muzled, or any mans teeth whet against him?
Verily, the Appealer disclaimes all kinred or affinitie

with Arminius; nay he protesteth, he knoweth
not the man; and if peraduenture some Longinus
or skilfull Genealogist may be able to disproue
him, yet certainly the vulgar reader is not.
I haue therefore thought it worth the paines, to
take the line of Pelagius which is already brought
downe to Arminius, and from Arminius to draw
it out euen to the Appealer, to the end, all, that
are not forestalled with preiudice, may see,
that both the Appealer, and Arminius hold their
errors in capite from Pelagius; And that at the
first the Netherlands, and other parts receiued
the infection of pestilent doctrine from Britaine
by Pelagius; and now at last, that Britaine hath
receiued it from the Netherlands by Arminius:
Mater me genuit, eadem mox gignitur ex me.
But before I open the leaues of my Tablet, representing
on the one side the Arminian, and on the
other, the Appealers Demi-Pelagianisme, I intreat
the Reader emunctae naris to follow the
sent of Arminianisme in the Appealers writings
by these foure steps.
            
               1. His sleight and dilute purgation from
the aspersion of Arminianisme.
               
               
                  
2. His direct and professed defence of the
Arminians.
               
               3. His casting a blur vpon the Synod of
Dort that blasted them.
               4. His disparaging the Articles of Lambhith,
which are è diametro opposite to
the tenets of Baro then, and since Arminius.
               
            
            To begin with his Purgation. Although in other
Criminations it may be an argument of Innocencie
not to be moued or any way sensible of them; yet
in the suspition of heresie,Tacit. Maledicta si irascaris, agnita videntur▪ spreta exolescunt. no man (as saith Saint
Hierom) ought to be silent. Silence in such an
accusation is a crying sin, Et patientia digna omni
impatientiâ, and patience it selfe is vnsufferable.
Euery man is bound to professe his faith,
and consequently openly to discharge himselfe
from all imputation, especially of heresie, which
is so foule a crime, that the water of penitent
teares alone hath not bin thought enough to wash
it away. Scelus hoc exuritur igne; it hath bin
vsually burnt out with fire. It leaueth such a spot
in the conscience, that S. Cyprian conceiueth, The
blood of Martyrdome cannot fetch it out. Macula
haec nec sanguine eluitur.
               Cyprian. epist. Now whether

               Pelagianisme be heresie, I thinke it is a question
without question, vnlesse we will take vpon vs
to censure the censures of the ancient Church, and
most eminent Doctors thereof. S. Austin in his
booke de bono Perseuerantiae, is not content to
call it perniciosissimus error, c. 17. but c. 21. he
calls it twise,Antequam Pelagiana haeresis appareret. and recolant aduersus haeresin Pelagianam. 
               Pelagiana haeresis. And that Arminianisme is Pelagianisme, either in whole or in
part, I take the Parallel, till I see it not slightly
glanced at, but substantially refuted to be an ocular
demōstratiō.Concil. Carth. sub Aurelio. Nefarius &amp; ab omnibus anathematizandus error. Concil. Mileuit. Perniciosissimi erroris auctores perhibentur Caelestius &amp; Pelagius. But if this be yet 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , a point
not yet gained, yet that Arminianisme (wherewith
the Appealer is charged, not only by two
Presbyters of his owne ranke, but a reuerend Prelate
his Diocesan) is formally heresie, Appello
Caesarem, I appeale to that Caesar whom he first
appealed vnto,August. p. 94. ad Hilariū: Omnes qui spem habemus in Christo huic pestiferae impietati resistere debemus. Prosper. in Crom. Per totum mundum haeresis Pelagiana damnata est. 
               King IAMES, of blessed memorie,
who in his declaration against Vorstius
hath these words, concerning Arminius, He was
the first in our age that infected Leyden with
heresie. And concerning Bertius he writeth thus;
Bertius a scholler of Arminius, at this present
remaining in your towne of Leyden,

               hath not

onely presumed to publish of late a blasphemous
booke of the apostasie of Saints; but
hath besides bin so impudent, as to send the
other day a copie thereof, as a goodly present,
to our Archbishop of Canterbury, together
with a Letter, wherein he is not ashamed, as
also in his booke, to lye so grosly, as to auow,
that his heresies contained in the said booke,
are agreeable with the Religion and profession
of the Church of England.
            
            To cleare then himselfe from the foule spot of
this heresie, what course doth the Appealer take?
Doth he call God, and his Angels to witnesse, that
he renounceth from his heart all Arminius his
vnwarrantable and dangerous assertions? Doth
he 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , fairely and openly make this, or the
like protestation? Arminius teacheth none, but
respectiue Predestination: I am for absolute. Vniuersall
grace and redemption is an Article of Arminius
faith: It is none of mine. The cooperation
of mans freewill with grace in the first conuersion,
and the power it hath to hinder, and frustrate
the worke of regenerating grace, is current
doctrine with Arminius. But I take it for a
leaden Leyden error. Arminius maintaineth a

totall and finall falling away from the grace of
Iustification: I detest and abhominate that assertion,
and will haue no Confarreation with the
apostate defender of such Apostasie.
            This had beene indeed to vnclaspe the right
hands of fellowship with Arminius, and if he had
euer walkt in his path, to shake the dust from his
feet: but in stead hereof, the Appealer casts
dust in the Readers eyes, by making a deepe protestation,
idque in verbo Sacerdotis, of not reading
any word in Arminius. I protest (saith he)
before God and his Angels,
               Appeal. to Caesar pag. 21. 
               the time is yet to
come, that euer I read word in Arminius. Before
I read this Protestation, I confesse, that my
selfe with many others imagined, that, as Osorius
writeth, that some in the Indies by often smelling
to Brasell, had Scorpions bred in their braines; so
the Appealer by frequent reading of Arminius
his bookes, and smelling to his exotecall positions,
had hatcht this Serpents brood in his braine. But
because hee denieth it, in verbo Sacerdotis, I
rest satisfied, that he neuer read Arminius: but
for ought he saith to the contrary, he may haue
heard all Arminius read ouer to him. Admit he
neuer read, or heard of Arminius, this will be no

good plea, if his doctrine be the doctrine of Arminius;
Legat that was burned in Smithfield, for
an Arrian, might protest truly, that he neuer read
word in Arrius his bookes, as indeed he could not,
because Arrius his bookes, with himselfe, were
many hundred yeares ago eradicated, will the Appealer
from thence conclude that Legat was no
Arrian? How many thousand Nestorians are
there in the Greeke Church at this day, who
yet neuer read word in Nestorius his writings;
not now extant (I take it) any where? I dare say,
Arminius himselfe neuer read word in any
of Pelagius his workes, or the workes of the
Semipelagians, or Massilians, yet he cannot free
himselfe from the brand of Pelagianisme; neither
doth much desire to be acquitted from the note of
Semipelagianisme. Wee reade in the Ciuill Law,
Malitia supplet aetatem: Malice oftentimes supplies
the defect of age. In like manner it is most
certaine, that where there is a propension in any
mans minde to any old heresie, the malice of the
Deuill easily supplyeth the want of reading: Zabarel
hauing coyned, as he thought, a new distinction
vnheard of before, was as proud of it, as euer
Pelius was of his new sword, saying, Ego hanc solutionem

primus inueni:
               In comment. in poster. Analyt. yet afterwards he ingeniously
confesseth, that perusing Gandauensis his
writings vpon the same argument, there he found
the selfe-same distinction; and it much reioyced
his heart, that so acute a Philosopher as Gandauensis,
should hit vpon the same conceit with him.
Might it not be so with the Appealer? might he
not first proiect the new plot of Predestination in
his owne head, and yet afterwards light vpon the
same in Arminius, or some of his schollers, and
exceedingly applaud either their conceit in himselfe,
or his in theirs? For mine owne part I will
not vndertake to proue that the Appealer was euer
an apprentice to Iames Harmin; but by setting
vp both of their loomes, I will make it appeare
that they are both 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , of the same trade or
craft.
            Thou seest, Christian Reader, that his purgation
of himselfe needeth a defence, but his direct defence
of the Arminians much more needeth a purgation.
No doubt the Appealer read often in the
Heathen Orator,Cic. pro Sylla. that it taints a man deepely once
to open his lips in the defence of such a man, whom
he suspecteth to be an enemie to the State: Quaedam
contagio est sceleris si eum defendas

quem patriae obstrictum esse suspiceris. How
much more doth it blurre a mans reputation to
frame an apologie for him, whom King Iames of
blessed memory, vpon iust and religious considerations,Declar. aduers. Vorstium.
proclaimeth to be an enemie of God? Either
the Appealers charity, or his cōscience must needs
be very large, wherein such an offender finds a
Sanctuary,
                  King Iames, ibidem. against whom all the Churches of
Germany made complaint to our then dread Soueraigne:
Nemo omnes, neminem omnes fefellerunt:
               Plin. Panegyr.
Neuer one man deceiued all men, neuer
all men deceiued one man: yet the Appealer is not
only content, some way to blanch Arminius, and
his schollers errours (whereof diuers by the Arminian
way, as a conuenient bridge, haue fairely walked
ouer to Popery:) but he, to the infinite wrong
of the Primitiue Saints and Martyrs, compareth
these Comets to those Stars, and would make these
as innocent &amp; vnguilty of the late troubles in the
Nether-lands, as they were altogether free from
the aspersions, which the Gentiles odiously and impiously
cast vpon them, scil: Appeale pag. 41.
were these late of-spring of the Semipelagians so
harmelesse and free altogether from sowing seed of
dissention in the Church, as the ancient Christians

were from mouing sedition in the State? Why did
then the wise and Christian States generall in the
Low-countries, by the aduice of our then Salomon,
call a nationall Synod, and so long continue
it at their great charge, to suppresse these, not venimous
vipers, tearing the bowels of her mother,
(in the Appealers esteeme) but silly and harmelesse
wormes? Why did our gracious Soueraigne
King Charles,
               Balchanquall Concio ad clerū. by his Embassador, the Duke of
Buckingham his Grace, deale effectually with the
States to root vp the weed of Arminian Liberty,
so far spreading among them?Appeale ibid.
                
               Yea, but (saith he)
did no crafty Interloper put in his stocke among
these brawling Bankers? Did no wiser
man work vpon exasperated minds? What of
that? No question, as it was there, so it will be
here, Dum pastores odia exercent, lupus intrat
ouile: While the shepherds are at strife, the Wolfe
entreth the sheep-fold. Doth this proue, the brawling
Bankers to be innocent? Or, disproue the speech
of our Sauiour,Matth. 18. 7. 
               Woe be to him by whom offences
come? But it should seeme there is such a neare
tye betweene the Appealer, and the Arminians,
that they are entred into a league defensiue, and offensiue,

for as he holdeth his buckler ouer them: so
he mainly foiles at their opposites: He slighteth,
vilifieth,Pag. 70. &amp; Pag. 108. and falsly traduceth the Synod of Dort;
for what reason, but because they touch the apple
of his eye, the Arminian theologie? He stirs the
Articles concluded at Lambhith, he carpeth at the
most reuerend Metropolitans, reuerend Bishops,
and renowned Doctors,Appeal. pag. 71. 72. the floure of both Vniuersities,
who subscribed them, and published them.
Neither can hee yeeld any reason hereof, but because
those eminent and euery way accomplisht
Diuines at Lambhith, crushed the addle egge now
smelling in the Appealers writings, when it was
new laid in Cambridge, before Baro could hatch
it. If these proofes be not pregnant, that the Appealer
is deepely engaged in the Arminian pact, I
intreat the Reader to trust his owne eyes, in comparing
the ensuing doctrines and arguments, set
one against the other by way of Parallel, where he
shall finde, that as in the water, face answereth
face: so in the humor of renuing Pelagianisme, the
Appealer doth Arminius. If Arminius or Bertius
be the Voice, the Appealer is the Eccho; if the
Appealer be the Voice, Arminius or Bertius is

the Eccho. Behold them both in the ensuing tablet,
like those two of whom the Poet speaketh,
Alter in alterius iactantes lumina
vultus: One looking, as it
were, babies in anothers eyes.

                        d God decreed the permission and disposing of sinne, which he fore-saw vpon his permission would be, hee did not decree the effecting, or existence of it, that it should be. Saint Augustine fully answereth these and the like Arguments in his booke de Corrept. &amp; Grat. cap. 10. We freely

confesse that, which we most rightly beleeue, that the God and Lord of all things, who made all things exceeding good, and fore-saw, that euill things would arise out of good, and knew, that it more appertained to his most omnipotent goodnesse, to draw good out of euil, than not to suffer euils to be, hath so ordred the life of men and Angels, that in it first he might shew the power of their owne free-will, and then the benefit of his grace, and iudgement of his iustice. And in his Enchiridion ad Laurentium, cap. 11. God, being most exceeding good, would not by any meanes suffer any euill to be in his workes, but that he is also so omnipotent and good, that he can and doth worke good euen out of euill.
                  
                  
                     
                        e As Iulian the Pelagian often in his bookes vpbraided Saint Augustine with Manicheisme; so doth Arminius and the Appealer (following the Pelagians step by step) lay the same imputation vpon the orthodox defenders of Predestination. But the imputation is most false; for the Manichees held two soules in a man, one good, another bad, and ascribed good and euill not to the free-will of man, but to those two soules: We, with the holy Fathers, teach but one soule in man, and referre good and euill to Free-will, but so that the will of it selfe is free to euill, but is not, neither can, sithence the fall of Adam, be free vnto good, till God

hath freed it by his grace, according to the words of our Sauiour in Saint Iohns Gospell, Chap. 8. 36. But if the Sonne make you free, you shall be free indeed. And of Saint Paul, Rom. 6. 18. Made free from sinne, &amp;c.
                  
                  
                     
                        f A stale obiection long sithence answered by Saint Augustine, in his second booke, cap. 5. ad Bonifac. Wee maintaine not Fate, or fatall necessity vnder the name of grace; but if it please some men to call the omnipotent will of God vnder the name of Fate, we seeke indeed to auoid prophane nouelty of word, but wee will not contend about words. To which answer of Saint Augustine we may further adde, that the beleefe of Christians, touching the falling out of all things according to the determinate counsell of God, Act. 2. differeth from the Stoicke Fate, or Fatality, in foure things.
                     
                        1. The Stoicks subiected God himselfe to Fate: Iupiter, though he most desired, could not free Sarpedon; we subiect Fate, that is, the necessitie of things, to Gods most free-will.
                        2. They vnder the name of (Fate) vnderstood an eternall fluxe and necessary connexion of naturall causes, and effects: we teach that all natural and second causes had their beginning in the Creation; neither is there such a necessary and absolute depēdance of effects from their naturall

causes, but that God can, and often doth suspend those effects, and miraculously worke beside, aboue, nay against nature.
                        3. The Stoicks by their Fatality took away all contingencie, wee admit contingencie in future euents, in respect of their second causes which worke contingently, though whatsoeuer commeth to passe falleth within the certaine presience of God, and is ordered by his prouidence.
                        4. The Stoicks taught, that men were impelled to sin by a fatall motion, and that mans will was forced by Destiny. We detest and abhorre any such assertion. See more hereof in Melancthon his Common places. Gratianus Ciuilis in Semipelagianismo. Lipsius lib. 1. de Constantia cap. 18. &amp; sequent.
                        
                     
                  
                  
                     
                        g Tis true, as we reade in the seuenteenth Article, that for curious and carnall persons lacking the Spirit of Christ, to haue continually before their eyes the sentence of Gods Predestination, is a most dangerous downefall, whereby the Deuill doth thrust them either into desperation, or into retchlesnesse of most vncleane liuing, no lesse perillous than desperation. The sweetest meat in a corrupt stomacke turnes to choller, but the fault is in the stomacke, not in the

meat; in like manner the word of God, and in particular this doctrine of the Word is in it selfe a sauour of life vnto life, but to some proues no better than a sauour of death vnto death, because as Saint Peter 2. 3. 16. telleth vs, They peruert the doctrine of holy Scriptures to their destruction. For the doctrine it selfe of Predestination, it openeth no gate to a dissolute life, but shutteth and barreth all such vnlawfull posternes; Shall we continue in sinne because grace aboundeth? God forbid, Rom. 6. 1. On the contrary, it openeth a faire gate, and directeth a certaine readie way to holinesse of life; For God hath predestinated vs, that we might be conformable to the Image of his Sonne, Rom 8. 29. And God hath chosen vs before the foundation of the world, that we might be holy and blamelesse before him in loue, Ephes. 1. 4.
                  
                  
                     
                        h In this obiection from Desperation, the Arminians and Appealer, as likewise in the former, furbush vp the old Pelagians harnesse, which Saint Augustine hath beat in peeces in his booke of the gift of Perseuerance, chap. 17. I will not amplifie with mine owne words, but I leaue it rather to them seriously to consider, what a strange thing it is, that they should perswade themselves the doctrine of Predestination doth bring to the hearers, rather matter of desperation, than exhortation, (or consolation:) for this is in effect to say, that then a man is to despaire of his saluation, when

he is taught to repose his hope and confidence not in himselfe, but in God; whereas the Prophet crieth out, Cursed is he that putteth his trust in man. Some indeed make a desperate vse of this doctrine, but the doctrine it selfe is no desperate doctrine, or doctrine of desperation, but of heauenly consolation, as we reade in the seuenteenth Article, [which ought for euer to stop the mouth of the Appealer, from slandering as he doth, the truth of God.] The godly consideration of Predestination and our Election in Christ, is full of sweet, pleasant, and vnspeakable comfort to godly persons, and such as feele in themselues the working of the Spirit of Christ, mortifying the works of the flesh and their earthly members, and drawing vp their minde to high and heauenly things, as well because it doth greatly establish and confirme their faith of eternall saluation to be enioyed through Christ, as because it doth feruently kindle their loue towards God.] On the contrary, the doctrine of the Arminians and the Appealer, which maketh Gods Election to depend vpon the will of man, which, as they say, may totally and finally fall away from grace, is in truth a most desperate doctrine, taking away all solid and firme ground of comfort both in life and death, as shall appeare hereafter.

                  ARMIN. Oration to the States, pag. 49. *
 The Decree whereby God hath decreed to saue certaine and singular persons, doth depend vpon his prescience, by which he fore-knew from eternitie, who according to the dispensation of sufficient meanes for their conuersion and faith, would by preuenting grace 
                        i
                     
 beleeue, and subsequent perseuere. And he is so hot in this point, and proceedeth so far, Argument 19. as to affirme, That the opinion of precise Election, without respect of foreseene faith in the elect, ouerthroweth the foundation of all Religion.
                  
                     Hag. Conference set out by Bert. pag. 62. The absolute decree, whereby it is said, that God in chusing men, did not respect any mans good
 
 qualities fore-seene, cannot stand with the nature of God, nor with Scriptures. The like is affirmed by Arnoldus against Tilenus. And Greuinchouius against Amese and the Arminians generally, who thus take that question in the Conference at Hage, pag. 123. Faith in Gods decree of election doth in order goe before, not follow election; it is not a fruit of election, but an antecedent conditon to it.

 faith, obedience, and repentance &amp;c. I say there, and I say truly, is the priuate fancie of some particular man.
                  
                     Pa. 64. There must needs be first a 
                        k
                     
 disproportion before there can be conceiued an election, or dereliction. This disproportion he afterward declares to be in the different wils of men, wherof some took hold of merey, others would not. His words are, When all alike being plunged, &amp;c. God out of his mercy stretched out to them deliuerance in a Mediator, the Man Iesus Christ, and drew them out that tooke hold of mercy, leauing them there that would none of him. Which is all one, as if he had said, he decreed to saue them from the common
 
 destruction which he fore-saw would beleeue, and reiect those whom he fore-saw would not beleeue, for by faith they take hold of mercy, and through incredulitie reiect it: nay in this point the Appealer speaketh not so warily as the Arminians, for they require faith in a person to be elected and iustified, as an antecedent condition, they doe not say as a cause or motiue in God to elect, iustifie, and saue: But the Appealer, Answer to the Gag, pag. 143. and Appeale, pag. 194. saith, that God was drawne by our faith to iustifie vs.

                        i When the Arminians, and the Appealer make Election to depend vpon fore-seene faith, either they meane that this faith is a meere gift of God, receiued only by mans free-will, or not so, but in part, or in whole a worke of mans will. If they hold faith to be a meere gift of God, their opinion of election vpon fore-seene faith implieth a contradiction; for it maketh

the former grace and gift of Predestination to glory to depend vpon a latter gift of faith. Beside, if faith be the meere gift of God, it can be no reason of difference betweene the Elect and Reprobate, on the part of the Elect and Reprobate, why the one should bee chosen, and the other refused, for the Elect haue it not of themselues, and the Reprobate haue it not at all, because it is not giuen. To referre election in this sense to faith, as it is Gods meere gift, is to make election to depend vpon Gods meere will, who giueth faith to some, and not to others, which quite ouerthroweth the foundation of Arminianisme. If they meane that fore-seene faith is in part, or in whole, a Worke of mans free-will by nature, and not meerely a gift of God, then their opinion dasheth directly on the rocke of Pelagius, [that Grace is giuen according to some merit of man] that is, as Saint Augustine expoundeth it, De bono perseuer. c. 19. Some good thought, word, or deed, or the good will it selfe, to receiue grace and faith, when otherwise man might haue reiected or repelled it: whereas the Apostle teacheth, that it is God which Or make one man differ fro
                              •
                            another, discerneth one man from another, &amp; that no man hath any good thing different frō another, which he hath not receiued, 1 Cor. 4. 7. Whereupon Saint Augustine concludeth in his Epistle to Sixtus, and in his booke of Predestination of Saints, Chap. 5. And in his

                        Enchiridion ad Laurent. cap. 99. That which putteth a difference betweene a beleeuer and vnbeleeuer, making him to beleeue, and not the other, is a speciall grace giuen by God to the one, and not the other; and consequently, that the separation of some men, and taking them out of the masse of perdition, is of Gods meere grace, and not in regard of any different qualities in men. A proud man might haue said, saith that holy Father, of Predestination of Saints, chap. 5. against another man, my faith maketh me to differ from thee, my righteousnesse, or the like; [which insolent words of a proud man rehearsed by Saint Augustine, Greuinchouius is so impudent, as to take vpon, and patterne in himselfe, saying, Ego me discerno, I discerne my selfe.] The good Doctor meeting with such thoughts, and checking them, saith, What hast thou that thou hast not receiued? from whom, but from him, who made thee differ from another? to whom he hath not giuen, that he hath giuen to thee: and if thou hast receiued it [namely, that wherein thou differest from another] Why doest thou boast, as if thou hadst not receiued it? Nothing is so contrary to the meaning of the Apostle, as that any man should so glory of his owne merits, or good workes, as if he had wrought them to himselfe, and not the grace of God; to wit, that grace of God which discerneth good men from bad, not that, which is

common to good men and bad. The maine conclusion of Saint Augustine in his Enchiridion, is most direct to our purpose, Sola gratia redemptos discernit à perditis, Grace alone discerneth or differenceth the redeemed from the lost, whom a common cause deriued from the beginning or root, had vnited in one masse of perdition.
                  
                  
                     
                        k This argument from disproportion deceiued sometime Saint Augustine, till he better considered of the words of the Apostle, Rom. 11. 5. So then there remaineth a remnant according to the election of grace. It is impossible indeed to conceiue an election according to desert of some, rather than others, in a meere paritie; there must needs be a disproportion in such an election, but in an election of free grace there needs none, there can be no such disproportion, for if election be of workes, then it is not of grace. Here if the Appealer, or any his friend, shall difference his opinion from the Arminians, by distinguishing the decree of election, in which there is no respect had to faith from the execution, in which, all sides confesse, respect is had to faith and perseuerance; I answer that the Appealer hath shut the doore of this Sanctuary against himselfe, and debarred himselfe from this defence, pag. 61. saying, I shall as I can briefly and plainly, without scholasticall obscurities, set downe what I conceiue of this

Act of God, or decree of Predestination, setting by all execution of purpose. After which Preface, without any interruption of other discourse, he deliuereth his opinion of election, as is aboue rehearsed.
                  
               
            
            
               
               Of Free-will.
               
                  ARMINIANS.
                  THe Arminians differ from Orthodoxal Diuines about Free-will in two points:
                  1. They teach, Hag. Confer. pag. 502. &amp; sequent. That the will of man hath some operation of it selfe in the first act of our conuersion, and doth cooperate with grace. God giueth grace sufficient to conuert, but doth not so determine the will, but that it may out of it's freedome admit grace, or not.
                  Their main reason is, God doth not beleeue, but wee; therefore 
                        l
                     
 we worke euen
  in our first conuersion, otherwise the assent should bee Gods, not ours.
                  2. They teach, that the will of man hath power to hinder and resist the worke of grace in his regeneration and conuersion. Arminius in his Orat. to the States, pag. 53. I beleeue according to the Scriptures, that grace is not (vis irresistibilis) an irresistible force or power, but that many doe  
                     
                        m
                     
                     resist the holy Spirit. Hag. Confer. pag. 502. The question is, whether grace, which worketh in man faith and conuersion, cannot be hindred, but is an irresistible operation, such as God vseth in raising the dead. They alledge to proue, 
                           •
                        hat man may resist grace, Act. 7. 51. Yee stiffe-necked, and of vncircumcised hearts and eares, yee haue alwaies 
                        n
                     
 resisted the holy Ghost. And Matth. 23. 37. How oft would I haue gathered your Children, as a Hen gathereth her Chicken vnder her wings, and yee 
                        o
                     
 would not.

                     APpeal. p. 84. It is supposed by some that the difference betweene the Pontificians and vs consists in this, that the will of man concurreth and cooperateth with diuine grace in the first very instant, and point of conuersion: wee teach that the will of man doth not cooperate in the first point, but in progresse of our iustification, so Keckerman in his Systeme, a better Logician, than Diuine. This Assertion of Keckerman he refelleth from pag. 85. to 89. and pag. 92. he insisteth vpō the same reason with the Arminians. If this were not so, then faith and repentance
 
 were no the actions of man, neither could man be said to beleeue and repent, but the holy Spirit.
                  
                     Appeale, pag. 89. The Councell of Trent addeth, that a man may resist the grace of God; admit: then, first man hath  
                        m
                     
free-will against God; Saint Steuen, in terminis, hath the very word, 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , you 
                        n
                     
 resist, nay fall crosse with the holy Ghost, not suffering him to work the worke of grace in you. And what said our Sauiour, How often would I, and thou wouldst  
                        o
                     
not? If the Councell meant of stirring, preuenting, and 
                        p
                     
 operating grace, I thinke, no man will deny it: if of adiuuant, subsequent, and cooperating grace, there is, without question, in the naturall will of a regenerate man so much of Adam remaining, and carnall concupiscence, as may make him resist, and rebell against the Law of God.
               
               
                  
                     
                        l We answer with Saint Augustine in his first booke De gratiâ &amp; libero arbit. cap. 16. It is certaine, that we

will when we will; but he makes vs to will that is good, of whom it is said, Pro. 8. The will is prepared by God; and God worketh in vs to will, Philip. 2. It is certaine that we work when we worke, but he worketh in vs to worke, by giuing most efficacious power to the will, who saith, I will make you to walke in my waies, Ezek. 36. Faith and repentance are our workes, because in vs, though not of vs: actions and passions denominate the subiect, not the cause; God is the efficient cause of faith and repentance; but the subiect, in which these vertues are wrought, is man, who therfore is said to beleeue and repent, because these things are wrought in him, but not by the power of his own will, but by the effectuall worke of grace, stirring the will, and making it freely to assent vnto, and beleeue the Gospell. Bernard. de lib. Arbit. What doth free-will? I answer, in one word it is saued, or cured; this worke cannot bee done without two; one by whom, the other in whom it is wrought. God is the Author of it, (the health or cure of the will) free-will is only capable of it.
                  
                  
                     
                        m
                        
                           Grace is two-fold,
                           Outward.
                           Inward.
                        
                        
                           Outward,
                           Offered in the ministery of the Word.
                        
                        
                           Inward,
                           Enlightning and inciting only.
                           Renewing and regenerating.
                        
                        
Men can, and do resist outward, and inward, only enlightning grace; but not renewing, and regenerating grace, so far as to hinder their conuersion; or, after they are cōuerted, vtterly to cast away the spirit of sanctification, and thereby fall away totally, &amp; finally. If God should giue no other grace, but such as man at his pleasure might reiect, or repell, hee should haue no kingdome within vs: and if he could not by his grace absolutely subdue, and conquer the stubbornesse of mans will, he should not be omnipotent. If grace doth not determine mans will, but mans will the influxe and effect of it, the peace and grace of God should not rule in our hearts, but euery man should be ruled to righteousnesse, as well as to sinne, by his owne free-will; which was the expresse heresie of Pelagius, and Caelestius, as Prosper in precise termes sets it downe in his Chronicle, in the yeare of our Lord, 414.
                  
                  
                     
                        n To the place in the Acts I answer: First, That Saint Steuen speaketh of the Iewes resisting the Spirit of Prophecie, not the Spirit of regeneration: the Iewes gain-said, withstood, and opposed the Word of the holy Ghost, vttered by the Prophets, not the secret working of the holy Ghost by grace in the hearts of such, whom he would, and did conuert. Secondly, We confesse, that men vncircumcised in heart, (such as were these Iewes, whom Saint Steuen vpbraideth) not

only can resist, but can doe no other then resist the holy Ghost; but regenerating grace by circumcising the heart, remoueth that hardnesse whereby it resisteth grace, and then it cannot resist, because that, which makes it resist, is taken away; as Saint Augustine inferreth vpon that of Ezechiel the eleuenth, I will take away your stony-hearts, and giue you an heart of flesh. His inference is, Chap. 8. of Predestination of Saints, This grace which is secretly conueighed into the hearts of men, is not refused or repelled by any hard heart, for it is therefore giuen, that the hardnesse of the heart may first be taken away.
                     
                  
                  
                     
                        o Not to insist vpon the distinction of the double will of God [well knowne to the learned by the notions of signi, &amp; beneplaciti, his commanding, or declaratiue will, which is not alwaies fulfilled; and his powerfully working, and absolute good will and pleasure, which is alwaies fulfilled:] I further answer, that this place of Scripture rightly interpreted, as it is by Saint Augustine, makes against, and no way for the Arminians, and Appealer; for Christ saith not, How often would I haue gathered you Scribes and Pharises, and those Rulers and Gouernours of Ierusalem, which killed my Prophets, and you would not; but how often would I haue gathered your Children, that is, the inhabitants of Ierusalem, and I did also though you would not, but did what you

could to hinder their gathering vnder my wings, that is, their assembling to the true Church, and sheltring themselues vnder the shade thereof. Quos volui, te nolente congregaui, Whom I would gather I gathered, though thou wouldst not. So Saint Augustine vpon these words.
                  
                  
                     
                        p 
                        If by operating grace, hee meaneth that grace whereby God circumciseth the heart, Deut. 30. openeth the heart, Acts 16. conuerteth the heart, Ierem. 31. taketh away a stony heart, Ezek. 36. writeth his Law in the heart, Ierem. 31. worketh faith in the heart by the mightinesse of his power, Eph. 1. and 2 Thess. 1. 11. 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        ; no man, I suppose, [who is well catechised in the principles of Religion] will maintaine, that such grace may be resisted: For this were to make the impotencie of mans will to preuaile against the omnipotencie of God, and to disappoint his purpose, and frustrate his worke. Saint Augustine [that Delian diuer into the depth of this mystery] resolueth the contrary in many places in his booke of Predestination of Saints, Chap. 8. Why doth he complaine, sithence no man doth, or can resist his will? Doth the Apostle answer, O man, it is false, that thou sayest? No he saith no such thing: But, who art thou, O man, that answerest God? And de Corrept. &amp; Gratiâ, cap. 12. The weaknesse of mans will is helped in such sort, that it is led by diuine grace indeclinably and vnconquerably

[insuperabiliter ageretur:] and what is [vnconquerably] lesse then [irresistibly!] if grace vnconquerably lead the will, the will cannot conquer grace in striuing against it. And Chap. 14. ibidem. No will of man resisteth God, when God will saue. And hee confirmeth his Assertion with a reason, prouing that the will of man neither doth, nor can resist the will of God; for, saith he, To will and to nill are so in the power of him that willeth or nilleth, that it can neither hinder Gods will, nor conquer his power. And in his first booke of questions to Symplician, 2. Quest. The effect of Gods mercy cannot be in mans power to frustrate it, if he list; or that God should haue mercy in vaine [if man would not take hold of it] because if God would haue mercy on those who are reluctant, and withstand it, he could so call them, as it might befit them, that is, be effectuall vnto them. Saint Bernard in his booke of Free-will followeth Saint Augustine close; There is made a creation of the will by Christ into liberty, and that without vs; if into, then not out of liberty, or freedome of will: if without vs, then it is not in our Power to hinder this worke of God.

You could not be ignorant, that the Confession of the Church of England, was cited by mee truly in the Acts at Hampton Court. pag. 107. The English Confession set out in the yeare of our Lord 1562. Article 16. After we haue receiued the holy Ghost we may

                  Bertius in his Dedicatory Epistle. Doctor Bancroft at the Conference at Hampton Court, withstood Doctor Rainolds, who to that Article of the English Confession, concerning departing from grace, would haue those words added [but not totally, nor finally.]

Men are diuided in this tenent; Some suppose neither totally, nor finally; some totally, but not finally; some both totally, and finally, which is indeed the assertion of antiquitie. Ibid. The learnedst of the Church of England assent to antiquity in their tenent, which the Protestants of Germany maintain at this day, hauing assented therein to the Church of Rome. Appeale, pag. 36. In my iudgement, this is the doctrine of the Church of England, not deliuered according to priuate opinions in ordinary Tracts and Lectures, but deliuered publiquely, positiuely, and declaratiuely in Authentick records.

Ibid. p. 29. The Minor I make good particularly, &amp; will proue it obsignatis tabulis. In the 16. Article we reade, and subscribe this; After wee haue receiued the holy Ghost, wee may

 depart away from grace, and fall into sinne.
                  
                     Appeale, pag. 30. This Article was 
                        s
                     
 challenged as vnsound at the Conference at Hampton Court, by those that were Petitioners against the Doctrine and Disciplie established in the Church of England: and being so challenged before his Sacred Maiestie, was there defended and maintained, &amp;c. namely by Doctor Ouerall, pag. 31.

                        r The Article hath not the word [Alway] that is the Appealers addition. The words are not, [After we

haue receiued the holy Ghost, we may fall into sinne, and so fall away from grace; but we may depart from grace giuen, and fall into sinne:] that is, so farre depart from grace, that a man may fall into sinne, after grace receiued; which is confessed on all parts. The Article speaketh not of a totall falling away from grace, much lesse, finall; for the words immediatly following are [and by the grace of God, to wit, (before giuen) we may rise againe.] He that falleth finally, cannot rise againe: he that falleth totally from grace, cannot rise againe by the grace he had receiued, because he is supposed to haue lost all the grace he receiued; and the Article speakes not of new grace, but onely of grace before receiued, and giuen. Besides, the words of the Apostle to the Hebrewes 6. 6. beare strongly that way; that a man, who was once partaker of the holy Ghost, if hee fall away, that is, totally cast away the Spirit of grace, cannot possibly be renewed againe by repentance. Whence we thus argue;
                     None who may after their fall rise againe by repentance, fall totally, or finally, Heb. 6. 6.
                     But all those, of whom the Article speakes, may after their fall, rise againe by repentance.
                     Therefore none of whom the Article speaks fall totally, or finally.
                  
                  
                     
                        s The Appealer vttereth two manifest vntruths in

this allegation out of the Conference at Hampton Court. The first is, That he faith the sense of the Article was there challenged as vnsound; for Doctor Rainolds [who in the name of the rest desired a fuller explication of the meaning of the Article, to preuent that mistaking, which is sithence fallen out in M. Montague, and others] began with this Preface [Though the meaning of the Article be sound, and good &amp;c.] The second is, That he affirmeth, that this tenent, [a iustified man may fall away from grace, and become, ipso facto, in the state of damnation, &amp;c. now styled Arminianisme by these Informers] was resolued, and auowed for true by Doctor Ouerall, and that honourable and learned Synod. For Doctor Ouerall, after he had affirmed, That a iustified man committing any grieuous sinne (as adultery, murther, or treason) became, ipso facto, subiect to Gods wrath, and was in the state of damnation (quoad praesentem statum) addeth, yet those that are called, and iustified according to the purpose of Gods election did neuer fall, either totally from all the graces of God, to be vtterly destitute of all the parts, and seeds thereof, or finally, from iustification; but were in time renewed by Gods Spirit vnto a liuely faith, and repentance, and so iustified from those sinnes, and the wrath, curse, and guilt annexed thereunto, whereinto they were fallen, and wherein they lay so long, as they were without true repentance for the same.

That which we haue proposed we proue, first, by those formes of Scripture, by which Apostasie is diuersly described; for this the Scripture calleth to turne away from righteousnesse, Ezek. 33. 13. If the righteous commit iniquity, all his righteousnesse shall be no more remembred, but for his 
                        •
                     niquitie, that he hath committed, he shall die for the same.

Hee, out of whom the Deuill is cast, is truly iustified; but such a one may by securitie, and negligence fall into an estate worse then the former: therefore he, that is once truly iustified, may fall into an estate worse than the former.
                  
                     Bert. pag. 36.

                        t
                     
 turne away from his righteousnesse, and commit iniquitie, and doe according vnto all the abominations that the wicked man doth, shall he liue? All his righteousnesse, that he hath done, shall not be remembred: but in his transgression that he hath committed, and in his sinne that he hath sinned, in them shall he die.
                  
                     Ibid. Ezek. 33. 13. If hee commit iniquity, all his righteousnesse shal be no more remembred: but for his iniquitie that he hath committed, he shall die for the same. Therefore the righteous may lose his righteousnesse, abandon his faith, die in his sinne, &amp;c.
                  
                  
                     Ibid. pag. 159. The vncleane spirit eiected, returneth vnto his former residence, entreth, possedeth
 
 his former state, and the case of that man is worse than the beginning, Matth. 12. 44.

Satan is not eiected, but where the partie is in the state of grace with God, being regenerate by faith. Reposseding is not but by relapse into sinne: nor a worse state, but where a man dieth in sinne.

They on the rock are they, who, when they heare, receiue the Word with ioy, who for a while beleeue, and in time of temptation fall away.
               
               
                  
                     
                        t Because this place of Ezekiel is set in the fore-front both by the Appealer, and by Bertius, as a testimony, on which they most rely, and are most confident of; I will endeuour both fully to answer, and retort it against them. Besides those Answers, by which others haue rebated the edge of this Obiection: As * first, that this speech is conditionall; suppositiue, and not positiue; and therefore no more inferreth that a righteous

man may fall from his righteousnesse, then those words of Saint Paul [If an Angell from heauen shall preach vnto you another Gospell, than that you receiued, let him be accursed] conclude, that an Angell from heauen can preach another Gospell. Or the like of our Sauiour, [They shall doe signes and wonders to seduce, if it were possible, the Elect] therefore it is possible to seduce the elect; whereas indeed the contrary may be inferred, euen from those words. Secondly, That the Prophet speaketh of him, that is righteous in his owne opinion, and before men; but not in the sight of God, such a man may fall away from his righteousnesse; but the question is, of a man regenerate, and truly righteous; and such a one cannot turne away from his righteousnesse. Of this minde is Saint Gregory Moral. in Iob. lib. 34. cap. 13. They, who may be seduced in such sort, that they neuer returne againe, may seeme to lose the habit of sanctitie before the eyes of men, [sed eam ante oculos Dei nunquam habuerunt] but indeed they neuer had any holinesse in the sight of God. Thirdly, that the Prophet speakes here of actuall righteousnesse, which may be lost, and is lost, by the committing of any wilfull and grieuous sinne against conscience; not of habituall, which cannot be lost [if he doe that which is lawfull and right, Ezek. 18. 21. and 24. If he doth according to all the abominations the wicked man doth, all the righteousnesse

that he hath done shall not be remembred] here is not a word that importeth habituall righteousnesse, but meerely actuall; which, all sides confesse, may be lost. Besides these answers, I say further, that this Scripture no way tendeth to Bertius, or the Appealers purpose. For they should proue, that a iustified man may lose Euangelicall righteousnesse, or the righteousnesse of Faith; not Legall righteousnesse. Now it is euident, that the Prophet speaketh of Legall righteousnesse; First, by the pronoune (his) [if the righteous turne away from (his) righteousnesse] that is, the righteousnesse of his owne workes, or his inherent righteousnesse: not the imputed righteousnesse of Christ, for that is not his owne, Philip. 3. 9. That I may be found in him, not hauing mine owne righteousnesse, which is of the Law; but the righteousnesse, which is of God by faith. Secondly, by the enumeration of particulars, vers. 6, 7, 8. 15, 16, 17. all which appertaine to Legall righteousnesse: If he hath not eaten vpon the mountaines, nor lift vp his eyes to the Idols of the house of Israel, nor come neare to a menstruous woman, and hath spoiled none by violence, and hath not giuen his money vpon vsury, &amp;c. Lastly, this argument may be retorted against the Aduersaries two wayes. First thus, If the difference of the Couenant betweene the Law and the Gospell, consisteth especially in this, [that the righteousnesse required

by the one may be lost, but the righteousnesse promised by the other cannot be lost] then the argument from the losse of Legall righteousnesse to Euangelicall, is of no force, but to disproue our Aduersaries tenent: for that, which in this place of Ezekiel, is affirmed of the one, may not be affirmed of the other: but the difference of the Couenant betweene the Law and the Gospel cōsisteth especially in this, [that the righteousnesse required by the one may be lost, but the righteousnesse promised by the other cannot be lost.] Ierem. 31. 31. 33. 34. Heb. 8. 8. Behold the dayes come that I will make a new Couenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Iudah; not according to the Couenant that I made with their Fathers, &amp;c. but this shall be my Couenant, which I will make with the house of Israel; I will put my Law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts, I will forgiue their iniquitie, and remember their sinne no more. And Ierem. 32. 40. I will make an euerlasting Couenant with them, that I will not turne away from them to doe them good; but I will put my feare in their hearts, that they shall not depart from me. Secondly thus: If these words are spoken generally to the children of God, and belong to the elect as well as others, they cannot imply a totall, and finall falling away from righteousnesse, no not in the iudgement of the Arminians, and Iesuites themselues, with whose Heifer the Appealer
                        
plowes: [For as the Iesuites, so Arminius himselfe teacheth, [that a man that is elect, and predestinated to eternall life, cannot fall finally, nor perish for euer:] But the words of the Prophet Ezekiel are spoken generally vnto all, and belong to the very Elect; therefore I conclude, in the words of the great Champion of Popery in generall, and of this particular touching the Apostasie of Saints, Card. Bellarm. lib. 3. de Iustif. cap. 12. It is true that the predestinated or elected are in no danger of losing eternall life, and that the terrifying threats vsed by the Holy Ghost in the Scriptures, are to this end, to stirre vp the elect to watchfulnesse and diligence; motiues they are to, and meanes of perseuerance, not arguments at all to proue the Saints Apostasie.
                     
                  
                  
                     
                        u To the place of Matth. 12. 44. we answer; First, we ought not to ground any doctrine of faith vpon a meere parable, or allegory: because [as Saint Augustine, in his booke, de Doctrinâ Christianâ, deliuereth it] All those points which belong to faith and manners, are plainly deliuered in the Scriptures. Secondly, we cannot a
                           •
                        gue strongly from corporall possession, or dispossession, to spirituall: as a Lunaticke man, so a man possessed with the Deuill in body, may be yet in the state of grace in his soule; and in like manner, as a man that is cured of his frensie or lunacie, may be yet an vnsanctified man; so a man, out of whom the Deuill is

cast, from tormenting or possessing the body, may be yet an vnregenerate man, (although, I grant, our Sauiour seldome, or neuer cured any mans body, but first he healed the soule, as some Interpreters haue obserued) yet no necessary consequence can be drawn from the health or sicknesse of the body, to the health or sicknesse of the soule. Neither is it said here, that the vncleane spirit was cast out by Christ, nor by any other; but that he went out of himselfe, and returned againe; and therefore this possessed person can be no fit embleme of a truly regenerated, and iustified man, out of whom the Deuil is powerfully cast out: and the party is no way vnder him, or in his power, but led by the spirit of God, Rom. 8. and wholly deliuered from the power of Satan. Thirdly, the meaning of the Parable is (as appeareth by our Sauiours application) that as the latter state of that man, [out of whom the Deuill first departed, and afterward returned with seuen worse than himselfe] was worse than the former, so it should be with the wicked Iewes, out of whom the vncleane spirit had gone out, for feare of the Law, but now was returned againe vnto them through their refusall of the Gospell, and despiting the Spirit of Grace. Thus Saint Hilary, Ierome, and Bede expound the Parable; and their Exposition is euidently grounded vpon our Sauiours words, vers. 45. Euen so shall it be also vnto

this wicked generation. As it is particularly applied by our Sauiour to the Iewes, so it may be to any Nation, out of which the vncleane spirit departeth for a while, or is driuen away by the preaching of the Gospell, if it be empty of good workes, and giuen to the pleasures of this world; like the lodging of the vncleane spirit, which he found empty, swept, and garnished. The vncleane spirit will enter with seuen worse, that is, the Gospell shall be taken away from them, and the Kingdome of Grace, for the abuse of it; and they shall be brought into worse bondage of the Deuill, then before: according to Saint Peter 2 Epist. 2. 20. If after they haue escaped the pollution of the world, through the knowledge of our Lord and Sauiour Iesus Christ, they are againe intangled therein and ouercome, the latter end shall be worse with them than the beginning: for it had beene better for them, not to haue knowne the way of righteousnesse, than after they haue knowne it, to turne away from the holy commandement deliuered vnto them. This was the case of the Kingdome of Congo, which for a time embraced the Gospell, but afterwards perceiuing that it restrained their carnall libertie, and no way permitted pluralitie of wiues, they cast off the yoke of Christ, and enthralled themselues againe to Satan. But it is not so with those that are truly regenerate, for to them his yoke is easie, and his burthen light. Lastly, this obiection may

be retorted against the Aduersaries thus;
                     This Parable is meant of a wicked generation, Matth. 12. 45. an euill, and adulterous generation, vers. 39. a generation of vipers, vers. 34. such as the Scribes and Pharises were, who in this Parable are reproued by our Sauiour.
                     But the regenerate children of God are not a wicked, adulterous, or viperous generation, but a chosen generation, a royall Priest-hood, an holy nation, a peculiar people, 1 Pet. 2. 9.
                     Therefore this Parable is not meant of the regenerate children of God.
                  
                  
                     * To the place of Saint Luke 8. 13. and Mat. 13. 20. we answer; First, the heart of a man truly regenerated is not compared to a stony ground: for God by regenerating grace takes away our stony heart, and giues vs an heart of flesh, Ezek. 36. 26. Secondly, a temporary faith is not of the same nature with a iustifying faith; a temporary faith hath no root, Matth. 13. 22. and Luke 8. 13. a iustifying faith hath: a temporary faith beareth no fruit, but a iustifying faith beareth fruit, Matth. 13. 23. and Luke 8. 15. Those, who beleeue the Gospell, meerely out of temporary hopes, [because godlinesse hath the promise of this life] they receiue the word with

ioy, while they thriue and gaine by it; but when there ariseth trouble and persecution for the Word, they are offended, and fall away: but those who ground their faith vpon the promises of a better life, their faith like gold, (1 Pet. 1. 7.) being tried in the fire, is made much more precious, and found vnto praise, and honour, and glory, at the appearing of Iesus Christ, beleeuing with ioy vnspeakable, and full of glory, receiuing the end of their faith, the saluation of their soules, vers. 8. Their faith differeth from the faith of Hypocrites, and Temporizers, in the cause and kinde; their ioy in the degree; and both in the continuance. Lastly, this obiection may be retorted against the Aduersarie: First thus;
                     They, who are compared vnto the good ground, are not meant here by stony ground:
                     But truely regenerate Christians and beleeuers, Luke 8. 15. and Matth. 13. 23. are compared to good ground;
                     
                     Therefore they are not here meant by stony ground.
                     
                     Secondly, thus;
                     That faith, which is distinguished from a iustifying faith in this Parable, cannot be taken for the faith of a true regenerate Christian;
                     
                        
But the temporary faith is distinguished in this Parable from a iustifying faith;
                     Therefore the temporary faith cannot be taken for the faith of a true regenerate Christian, and consequently, the Appealer, and Arminians are in this their allegation mistaken.

                        x To the place of Matth. 24. 12. we answer; First, that the loue of many may wax cold; yet will it not thereupon follow, that the loue of the regenerate and true beleeuers waxeth cold: for the regenerate, and true beleeuers, are not meant by those Many. True charitie is a fruit of faith, and such as the faith is, such is the charitie. If it be a temporary faith, the charity proceeding from it, is but temporary, and being so, may not only wax cold, but also be vtterly extinguished. The root being rotten, the fruit falls of it selfe. But if the root of faith be sound, charitie will neuer decay; but abound more and more, till the childe of God be filled

with the fruits of righteousnesse, Philip. 1. 9, 11. Secondly, the consequence is not good, from a remission of some degree of charitie, to the amission of the habit of it: The Apostles themselues, as they were not so strong in their faith, so neither so hot in their loue toward our Sauiour at his Passion, as before. Their faith was shaken in that fearfull storme of temptation; their confidence was small, or none in appearance, in their owne sense: for in saying [we trusted, it had beene hee that should haue redeemed Israel, Luke 24.] they imply, that his death had loosned the Anker of their hope, and that both their heart and faith failed them for the time, their loue also waxed cold, if not freezed, when they fled from him, and forsooke him. Yet no learned Diuine euer affirmed, that their loue to our Sauiour was quite lost; for as he loued them, so they loued him to the end. Thirdly, this argument may be retorted against the Aduersaries thus:
                     If Christ doth here put a difference betweene those that are truly faithfull, and hypocrites, in this; that the one (Hypocrites to wit) should in the latter dayes and perillous times be offended, deceiued, wax cold in charity, but the other (the truly faithfull) should continue to the end, then this place maketh not for, but 
against the totall or finall falling away of true beleeuers.
                     But Christ in this place puts a difference between those that are truly faithfull, and hypocrites, in this; that the one (Hypocrites to wit) should in the latter daies and perillous times be offended, deceiued, and wax cold in charity, vers. 10, 11, 12. but the other (the truly faithfull) should continue to the end, vers. 13.
                     Therefore this place maketh not for, but against the total or finall falling away of true beleeuers.
                  
                  
                     
                        y To the place alledged, Rom. 11. 19, 20. we answer: First, that it is not meant of particular beleeuers, and their danger of falling away from iustifying faith; but of the people of the Gentiles in generall, and their danger of being cut off from the true Oliue, into which they were ingrafted, that is, from the outward profession of faith, and communion of the Catholique Church, into which they were admitted vpon the reiection of the Iewes. The Gentiles therefore ought not to be high-minded against the Iewes, but feare, lest God, who spared not the naturall branches, should not spare them, but cut them off also, as he did the naturall branches, if they should grow proud, and presumptuously

secure. Now there is no question, but that a Visible Church, which at this time professeth the truth, and is a member of the Catholike Church, may fall away from the outward and publike profession of faith, and cease to be a part of the Catholike visible Church; as the most famous, &amp; sometimes flourishing Churches of Greece and Asia, planted by the Apostles themselues, now ouer-run with Mahometanisme, Idolatry, and Heresie, proue by their lamentable Apostasie, and deplorate, if not desperate estate. But Bertius and the Appealer should haue had their eyes vpon the marke, and point in question; which is not of the doctrine of faith, but the habit of faith; not de fide, quam credimus, but de fide, qua credimus; not of the publique profession of a Church, but of a particular affiance of euery true beleeuer in Christ. A member of the visible Church may be cut off, but no member of the inuisible; for Christ cannot haue, damnata membra, any members, who shall not be saued, as the Approuer of the Appealers booke rightly gathereth out of Saint Augustine, in his Reply to Fisher. A Church, or Kingdome generally may depart from the Christian faith, or renounce the pure profession thereof in publique, and yet no true beleeuer, either totally or finally, lose his faith; but either secretly in that State or Kingdome, or else-where openly, he may retaine both faith it selfe, and the profession

 thereof. Secondly, Gods threatnings haue their vse, both in the Elect, and Reprobate; to make the one vnexcusable, or to keepe them within some bounds of moderation; and to keepe the other in an awfull reuerence, filiall feare, and spirituall watchfulnesse, which are meanes of Perseuerance, no arguments of Apostasie. Feare is not, but where a change may be; to wit, feare of a change; but there may be a feare of offending God through high-mindednesse, and presumption, as was in the Apostles, and is in all the Elect, &amp; yet no change of their estate of grace could or can be, by the confession of Arminius himselfe, and the learned'st of all our Aduersaries. Thirdly, as the faithful ought to feare, so they also might, and de facto would fall away, not only totally, but finally, if they were left to themselues; and therefore, in regard of the frailtie of their nature, and mutabilitie of their owne will, they haue iust cause to feare, and doe still feare in themselues, yet are still confident in God, who is faithfull, and will establish them, and keepe them from euill, 2 Thess. 3. 3. and shall confirme them vnto the end, that they may be blamelesse in the day of our Lord Iesus Christ, 1 Cor. 1. 8. Lastly, this Obiection may be retorted against the Aduersarie thus:
                     That feare, which God promiseth to put into the hearts of true beleeuers, to this end,
 
that they may not fall away from him, is a certaine meanes to preserue true beleeuers in the faith, (else God should faile in his end.)
                     But the feare here enioyned, is that feare, which God promiseth to put into the hearts of true beleeuers, to this end, that they may not fall away from him, Ierem. 22. 40.
                     Therefore the feare, here inioyned, is a certaine meanes to preserue true beleeuers in the faith: and consequently a strong argument for the perseuerance of Saints in faith and grace; as it is vrged by Saint Augustine in his booke de Perseuer. Sanctorum, cap. 2. [I will put my feare in their hearts, that they shall not depart from me) What is it else, then to say? the feare shall be such, and so great, that they shall for euer cleaue vnto me.
                     
                  
                  
                     
                        z To the places alledged, Iohn 15. 2, 5. we answer: First, there is a double insition or ingraffing into Christ; externall, when a man is made a member of the visible Church by the hearing of the Word, and participation of the Sacraments; internall, when a man by sanctifying grace, and sauing faith, is made a member of the inuisible Church. They, who haue the outward

insition only into the true Vine Christ Iesus, may be cut off: but they, which haue the inward as well as the outward insition, cannot be cut off, and wither as a branch; for Non est corpus Christi reuerâ, quod non er it in aeternum; That is not Christs true body, which shall not abide for euer, [neither, by the like reason, is that a true branch, which abideth not for euer in the Vine] August. de Doct. Chri. lib. 3. cap. 32. Which reason of S. Augustine is confirmed by Saint Gregory, in his description of the Church in his Comment on the Canticles, Christus sanctam Ecclesiam de sanctis in aeternum permansuris extruxit; Christ hath built his Church of Saints which shall for euer perseuere. Secondly, as there is a double insition into Christ, so there is a double profession of faith; a naked and bare profession without practise of a holy life, or fruit of good workes; or a profession ioyned with practise, a faith working through loue, &amp; bringing forth the fruits of the Spirit. By the barren branches cut off, and withered, Theophylact on these words alledged, vnderstandeth those, who make a naked and bare profession: Saint Cyril, in his tenth booke vpon Iohn, Those who haue faith without loue, and good works; such a faith S. Iames in his second Chap. calls a dead faith, but the faith by which the iust man liueth, is a liuing faith working by loue, Galat. 5. 6. and bringing forth fruit with patience, Luke 8. 15. Thirdly, the words [in

me] Iob. 15. 2. may be either referred to the word [Vine] and the meaning is, euery branch existent or ingraffed in me, that beareth no fruit, but leaues only of a bare profession, shall be taken away; or the words [in me] may be referred to bearing of fruit, and the meaning is, euery professour of Religion, or member of any Congregation that beleeueth not (in me, and beareth not fruit in me, to wit, the fruits of the Gospell by my grace, shall be cast forth as a dead branch, and wither) for, as it is in the fift verse, Hee that abideth in mee, and I in him, the same bringeth forth fruit: for without me yee can doe nothing. If the words be taken in the former sense, they are meant of Hypocrites within the Church; if in the latter, of Iewes, or Pagans, without the Church; who beare fruit, that is, doe morally good workes, or, doe by nature the things contained in the Law, Rom. 2. 14. but because they doe not these things in faith, their good workes are no better, than splendida peccata, sins hauing a luster, or shew of vertue, as Saint Augustine. Take the words in either sense, they belong not to regenerate persons, and true beleeuers, who are so ingraffed into Christ, that they abide in him by faith, and beare fruit in him through faith. Lastly, this Obiection may be retorted against the Aduersarie, thus:
                     No branch, that beareth fruit in Christ, shall be taken away, but purged, that it may

bring forth more fruit (as it followeth in the second verse vrged by the Aduersarie.)
                     But euery true beleeuer is a branch that beareth fruit in Christ, Matth. 13. 23. Rom 6. 22.
                     Therefore no true beleeuer shall be taken away, but purged, that he may bring forth more fruit.

                        a To the places alledged out of Timothy, wee answer: First, that they are fully answered by the distinction aboue mentioned (ad literamy) namely of a two-fold signification of the word (faith) which is

sometimes taken for the saith which we beleeue, that is, the word of faith, or doctrine of the Gospell, as Galath. 1. 23. Now preacheth the faith, which once he destroyed, Rom. 10. 8. This is the word of faith, which we preach: the hearing of faith, Galat. 3. 2. A great company of the Priests were obedient to the faith, Act. 6. 7. And in this sense Oecumenius taketh the word (faith) in the first place aboue alledged, 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        : by faith, I vnderstand faith in doctrine; by conscience, a godly conuersation, or a good life. And that it is to be so taken in the latter place, it is euident by the words following, 1 Tim. 4. 1. Giuing heed to seducing spirits, and doctrine of deuils. Faith opposed to error, and doctrine of deuils, is the true doctrine of faith, which we beleeue and preach. Sometimes the word (faith) is taken in Scripture for the faith by which we beleeue; that is, the inward grace, or habit of faith: as Rom. 3. 28. Iustified by faith, without the deeds of the Law. And Rom. 4. 5. His faith is counted for righteousnesse, Rom. 5. 1. Being iustified by faith, we haue peace with God. This distinction is not new coyned by nouelizing Puritans, but stamped by the ancient Fathers, and goes for current among the Schoole-men. Saint Augustine in his thirteenth booke of the Trinity, chap. 2. deliuers it in these very termes, There is a difference betweene the faith, quae

creditur, and quâ creditur: And Lombard, lib. 3. distinct. 23. taketh the same from Saint Augustine, saying, Fides est interdumid, quod credimus, interdum estid, quo credimus. Secondly, we answer, that as there is a temporary faith, so there may be a good conscience for a time, which a man putting away, soone after makes shipwrack concerning faith: that is, either concerning the doctrine of faith, by maintaining errors, (as both Bertius, and the Appealer haue done:) or concerning the act of a temporary faith, by ceasing to beleeue, and professe the faith. Thirdly, it is to be noted, that the Apostle saith not [losing] but [putting away a good conscience] which words may be most properly meant of such, who hold faith, and notwithstanding put away a good conscience; that is, gladly embrace the promise of the Gospell, and remission of their sinnes by faith, but reiect the condition vpon, &amp; end for which grace is offered, Tit. 2. 12. (To deny vngodlinesse, and worldly lusts, and to liue soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world) such are all carnall Gospellers, who beleeue well, but liue not accordingly. Fourthly, the phrase (making shipwracke) doth not import the vtter losse of faith; for many things, that fall out of the ship by wrack, are recouered again, and saued; and therefore Tertullian, in his book de Poenitentiâ, elegantly calleth repentance Tabulam post naufragium, A board, or broken peece of the ship, on which

after ship wracke a man may, as they did Act. 27. 44. Escape safe to land: Pleri
                              
                                 
                              
                              que
                            naufragio liberati, exinde repudium &amp; naui &amp; mari dicunt, &amp; Dei beneficium, salutem suam scil: memoriâ periculi honorant; Most men, that haue escaped in shipwrack, renounce both ship and sea, and, by remembrance of their former danger, more highly prize Gods benefit, and their saluation, Lastly, this Obiection may be retorted against the Aduersary, thus.
                     If those, who are here said to make shipwracke of faith, are not to be thought, to haue fallen away finally from grace and saluation, but rather the contrary, then this place maketh nothing for the finall Apostasie of true beleeuers:
                     But those, who are here said to make shipwracke of faith, are not to be thought, to haue fallen away finally from grace and saluation, but rather the contrary;
                     Therefore, this place maketh nothing for the finall Apostasie of true beleeuers.
                     The first Proposition is euident; the Assumption is thus confirmed:
                     Those who were deliuered to Satan by the Apostle for their amendment, and that their spirit might be saued in the day of the Lord Iesus, are not to be thought to haue fallen

finally from grace and saluation.
                     But those, who are here said to make shipwracke of faith, (to wit, Hymeneus and Alexander) were deliuered to Satan by the Apostle, for their amendment, 1 Tim. 1. 20. and that their spirit might be saued in the day of the Lord Iesus, 1 Cor. 5. 5.
                     Therefore those, who are here said to make shipwracke of faith, are not to bee thought, to haue fallen finally from grace, and saluation.

 For it had beene better for them not to haue knowne the way of righteousnesse, than after they haue knowne it, to turne from the holy commandement giuen vnto them.

fall away, should be renued againe by repentance: seeing they crucifie againe the Sonne of God vnto themselues, and make a mocke of him.
               
               
                  
                     
                        b To the place Galath. 5. 4. wee answer: First, the maine scope and drift of the Apostle, is to confute

those among the Galathians, who went about to ioyne Iudaisme with Christianisme, Legall righteousnesse with Euangelicall: these the Apostle shewes cannot stand together. For the one consisteth in the perfect fulfilling of the Law, Rom. 10. 5. the other in forgiuenesse of sinnes, Rom. 4. 7. The proper meaning therefore of the words is, that whosoeuer seekes for iustification by the Law, that is, the workes of the Law, is fallen from grace, that is, hath lost his claime by the couenant of grace, or is excluded from all hope of obtaining mercy and grace; for such a one is become a debtor to the whole Law, that is, cannot bee iustified, to wit, by the couenant of workes, vnlesse hee fulfill the whole Law, which no man is able to doe. Secondly, Grace is sometime taken for a reward of free gift, and so it is opposed to merit; sometime it is taken for supernaturall habits infused, putting a man in grace and fauour with God, or making him gratious, and so it is opposed to nature; sometime it is taken for the doctrine of free remission of sinnes by Christ, or couenant of grace, and so it is opposed to the Law, or couenant of works: and that it is taken in the last sense in this place, is euident by the antecedents, and consequents, and the very opposition to the Law in this fourth verse, Gal. 5. Thirdly, admit the word (Grace) were here taken for the grace of regeneration, or iustification, as the Aduersaries

would haue it, yet the Text maketh nothing for them; for it is not said, that the Galathians fell from grace totally, or finally; although in that particular error of theirs, in retaining the Legall ceremonies, and vrging Circumcision, they in effect, and by consequent ouerthrew a maine doctrine of the Gospel, touching iustification by faith in Christ. Lastly, this Obiection may be retorted against the Aduersarie, thus:
                     Whosoeuer teach, and beleeue iustification on by the Law, or inherent righteousnesse, are fallen from grace, and refuted by this text of the Apostle.
                     The Aduersarie teacheth and beleeueth iustification by the Law, or inherent righteousnesse; see the precedent tablet, Art. of iustification.
                     
                     Therefore the Aduersary is fallen from grace, and refuted by this text of the Apostle.
                  
                  
                     
                        c To the place alledged out of Saint Peter 2. Epist. 2. Chap. 20. We answer: First, Saint Peter speakes not of true beleeuers, but of false teachers, who priuily brought in damnable heresies, euen denying the Lord that bought them, verse 1. These [though they had escaped the filthinesse of the world through the knowledge of Christ, that is, the practise of grosse

                        idolatry, called in Scripture Spirituall fornication and vncleannesse; and had kept themselues from other foule, and enormous sinnes of the flesh euen against nature, wherein the blinde idolaters of the world were intangled] yet were neuer inwardly, and throughly washed and cleansed, especially from the pollutions of the heart. The Apostle compareth them to swine, which after they are washed, (that is, outwardly) wallow againe in the mire, because they retaine still their swinish nature: so these, after they had receiued the knowledge of Christ, and outwardly conformed themselues to the Gospell, and cleansed themselues from grosse actuall sinnes, returne to their former filthinesse, as naturall bruit beasts, made to be taken and destroyed, vers. 12. Secondly, a man may be intangled againe in the pollutions of the world, and relapsed into foule sins (as some of Gods Saints haue beene) yea as enormous as any he committed before his conuersion, and yet not fall totally or finally from grace, as shall be shewed hereafter. Lastly, this Obiection may be retorted against the Aduersary, thus:
                     None, that are, or were true beleeuers, are wells without water, [For he that beleeueth, out of his belly flow riuers of liuing water, Iob. 7. 38.]
                     
                     Those spoken of by S. Peter are wels without water, vers. 17.
                     
                     Therefore those spoken of by Saint Peter, are not, nor were true beleeuers.
                     Or thus:
                     None of the regenerate are dogges, or swine; [For holy things, and pearles are giuen to them, which may not be giuen to dogs, or cast before swine, Matth. 7. 6.]
                     Those, whom Saint Peter speakes of, are dogs and swine, vers. 22.
                     Therefore those, whom S. Peter speakes of, are not regenerate.
                     And so this text of Scripture is nihil ad rhombum; and the Aduersaries argue worse and worse, (It being happened vnto them, according to the true prouerb, (ab equis ad asinum) mentioned vers. 16. which beast, and the Rider, whether they are not a perfect impresse and embleme of the Bertius a pension in France,

                        d To the place alledged, Heb. 6. 4. weanswer: First, It is not affirmed (as Whitaker learnedly obserueth in

Cygneâ Cantio:) that those, who were inlightned &amp;c. doe fall away, but, if they fall away, they cannot be renued by repentance. Which note of that Swan sweetly accordeth with the words of the Apostle himselfe in this Chapter, vers. 9. But beloued, we are perswaded better things of you, and things that accompany saluation, though we thus speake. May not I iustly apply the words of Saint Cyprian, against Nouatus, to the Aduersarie Bertius, (Scindis, sicut ipse scissus es,) As thou art cut off, and hast made a rent in the Church, so thou cuttest, and would'st make a rent in the Scripture, by taking a part by it selfe to serue thy turne, contrary to the coherence and scope of the whole? Secondly, inlightning grace doth not necessarily import renuing and sanctifying grace; nor tasting the heauenly gift, eating the bread of life, Ioh. 6. and being filled therewith, Matth. 5. 6. nor partaking of the holy Ghost, being led by the holy Ghost, Rom. 8. much lesse sealed with it, Eph. 1. 13. as all true regenerate Christians are. The Aduersaries might haue learned out of Gratian. de poenit. dist. 2. It is one thing to taste the gift, and powers of the world to come; another, to haue them rooted in the heart: Aliud affici pro tempore, aliud perfici, &amp; obsignari in vitam aeternam: One thing, to be moued, or affected for a time, as Herod was at the hearing of Iohn the Bap
                           
                              •
                           ist; another thing, to be perfectly sanctified, and sealed

to eternall life, as are all true beleeuers, 2 Cor. 1. 22. Ephess. 4. 30. Lastly, this Obiection may be retorted against the Aduersary, thus:
                     No regenerate childe of God can commit the sinne vnto death, 1 Ioh. 5. 17. 18.
                     The Apostle here speakes of those that commit (or at least may commit) the sinne vnto death.
                     Therefore the Apostle speakes not here of any regenerate childe of God.

and care, to which the Apostle here exhorteth, is a principall. The Apostles estate was certaine, for Christ saith, Luke 10. 20. Reioyce, because your names are written in heauen. And Iohn 17. 12. Those that thou gauest me, I haue kept, and none of them is lost, but the sonne of perdition. Yet he commandeth them to watch and pray, that they enter not into temptation, Matth. 26. 41. And he prescribeth a forme of prayer to be vsed by them, and vs, continually, [Lead vs not into temptation] Mat. 6. 13. The souldiers, and passengers estate, who were in the ship with Paul, Act. 27. 24. was safe, and sure, because God had giuen Saint Paul all them that sailed with him: Yet were they to vse the helpe of the shipmen to saue their liues, and vnlesse they had so done, they had perished, vers. 31. Except these abide in the ship, yee cannot be saued. Secondly, the Apostles words are to be noted, who saith not, Let him that standeth, but, let him that thinketh he standeth. A man may thinke hee standeth, though indeed he standeth not; as those that killed the Apostles, did thinke that they did God good seruice, Iohn 16. 2. The Pharisie thought that he was rather iustified, than the Publican, yet he was not. Saint Paul thought he had done a worke acceptable to God, and aduantagious to the true Church, when he persecuted the Saints, and made hauocke of the Church. The heart of man is deceitfull aboue all things, as it

deceiueth others, so sometimes our selues also. Wee may conceiue that we are highly in Gods fauour, and a great way toward heauen, when yet indeed we are cast backe, or stand at a stay. It is therefore a speciall point of wisdome, to examine our spirituall estate, and proue whether we are in the faith, or no; that is, whether we stand indeed, or thinke onely that we stand: for he that thinketh only that he standeth, and hath no sure footing, nor ground of his perswasion, may fall, and that irrecouerably. Thirdly, He that standeth may fall, yet not totally, or finally. A man may fall, and yet not bee hurt by his fall; a man may be hurt, and that dangerously, by a fall, and yet not die of that hurt;  Though he fall, he shall not be vtterl

                              •
                            with his hand Psal. 37. 24. 
                        Iustus cadit, non tamen excidit. The righteous falleth seuen times a day; Si cadit, quomodo iustus? si iustus, quomodo cadit? If he fall, how is he righteous? if righteous, how doth he fall? Saint Ierome answereth, sed iusti vocabulum non amittit, qui semper per poenitentiam resurgit; He loseth not the name of righteous, who, as often as he falls by sinne, riseth againe by repentance, Epist. 44. Lastly, this Obiection may be retorted against the Aduersarie, thus:
                     None of those, whom God preserues from being ouercome, in temptation, can fall totally, or finally.
                     Those whom Saint Paul aduiseth to take 
heed lest they fall, are such, whom God preserues from being ouercome in temptation; in the next verse, 1 Cor. 10. 13.
                     But God is faithfull, who will not suffer you to be tempted aboue that you are able: but wil with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to beare it.
                     Therefore, those whom Saint Paul aduiseth to take heed lest they fall, cannot fall totally, or finally.
                  
                  
                     
                        f To the place alledged Phil. 2. 12. we answer: First, that the argument drawne from the feare of Gods Saints, hath beene before refuted, and retorted, in the handling that text of the Apostle [Be not high-minded, but feare.] Secondly, we answer, Feare is not here opposed to religious confidence, but to carnall security, and presumption. The trembling here commanded, is an awfull reuerence, and filiall trembling, not a seruile affrighting: this feare and trembling, is not only ioyned with assured hope, that God will worke both the will and the deed in them that so feare, vers. 13. but also with ioy, Psal. 2. 11. Serue the Lord with feare, and reioyce with trembling. Feare cannot be here taken for a distrustfull feare, or a feare of being damned, but of a sollicitous and watchfull feare; for this were no good consequence, God worketh in you the will and the

deed, therefore feare, that is, doubt and distrust your saluation; but vse all diligence to make your election sure, and be carefull to stirre vp God his grace in you, and to call on him continually in all humblenesse of minde, for the assistance of his Spirit, without which you can neither doe, nor will any good. This grace and assistance of his Spirit God promiseth to none, but to the humble, and such as tremble at his word, Esay 66. 2. Why doth the Apostle say,

Lastly, this Obiection may be retorted against the Aduersarie, thus:
                     None, in whom God worketh both the will to perseuere and deed, can fall totally, or finally.
                     In those, whom Saint Paul here aduiseth to worke out their saluation with feare and trembling, God worketh both the

 alloy than Angels were in state of Glory, than Adam Was in state of Innocencie: For Grace is but a conformity thereto, and no conformitie exceedeth the Architype: At most it is but an equalitie thereto: and equals are of the same proportion. Now if Adam in Paradise, and Lucifer in Heauen, did fall and lose their Originall estate, the one totally, the other eternally, what greater assurance hath any man in state of Proficiencie, not of Consummation?

                         velit, &amp; tanto ardore diligat, vt carnis voluntatem contraria concupiscentem voluntate Spiritus vincat. And againe, Primo homini, Aug. ibid. cap. 12.  qui in eo bono, quo factus fuerat rectus, acceperat posse non peccare, posse non mori, posse ipsum bonum non deserere, datum est adiutorium perseuer antiae, non quo fieret vt perseueraret, sed sine quo per liberum arbitrium perseuerare non posset. Nunc vero sanctis in regnum Dei per gratiam praedestinatis non tantum tale adiutorium perseuerantie datur, sed tale, vt ijs perseuerantia ipsa donetur; non solum vt sine isto dono perseuerantes esse non possint, verumetiam vt per hoc donum non nisi perseuerantes sint. Secondly, from Gods dealing with the Angels that kept not their first estate, but &amp;c. to his dealing with man after his fall, no good president can be taken; for it is certaine, God prouided a Redeemer for

man, but none for them. (As the Angels sin was greater, so their iudgement was more heauy, and losse irreparable.) Neither is the consequence good from Adams losse of his estate of Innocency to the like possibilitie of the regenerates losse of their estate of Grace; because God made no euerlasting

                        couenant of peace with Adam before his fall, as he did since with the regenerate in Christ the Peace-maker. He made no such promise to Adam before his fall, as he hath made to his Church since, that Hell gates should not preuaile against her. Adam had no Mediator before his fall to pray for his perseuerance in the state of Innocencie; but the faithfull and truly regenerate haue the effectuall prayers of Christ the Mediator for their perseuerance in faith and grace;

Thirdly, Adam in Paradise stood by the power of his owne free-will, and naturall integrity; but the regenerate are now kept by supernaturall grace, and the

                          power of God through faith vnto saluation; and therefore, albeit Lucifer in Heauen, and Adam in Paradise, who stood meerely of themselues, fell from their first estate, it is no consequent that the regenerate may in like manner fall from their estate, who stand not by

themselues, but by Christ, and are supported by God. Lastly, this Obiection may be retorted against the Aduersary, thus:
                     
                     If the state of Creation and Redemption differ especially in this, that men and Angels in the state of creation had power to perseuere, if they would, but not will; and men in the state of redemption haue not only power, but also will giuen them to perseuere, and grace by which they cannot but perseuere; then the argument, drawne from the totall fall of Adam, and finall of Lucifer, to the totall and finall falling away of the regenerate, maketh nothing for, but strongly against the Aduersary:
                     But the state of Creation and Redemption differ especially in this, that men and Angels in the state of Creation had power to perseuere, if they would, but not will; and men in the state of Redemption haue not only power, but also will giuen them to perseuere, and grace by which they cannot but perseuere, as hath beene proued.
                     
                     Therefore the Argument, drawne from the totall fall of Adam, and finall of Lucifer, to the totall and finall falling away of

                        Melancthon, that Saul seemed to be a faithfull man, but the euent sheweth that he was an hypocrite. He was indeed chosen to the Kingdome of Israel, but not to the Kingdome of Heauen, by the Appealers leaue: there is no syllable in Scripture importeth so much; hee was indeed indued with the Spirit of Gouernment, and the Spirit of Prophecie, but not with the Spirit of Regeneration for ought appeares in Scripture: hee might be, and, as most thinke, he was, among those to whom that speech of our Sauiour might be applied, Mat. 7. 22, 23.  
                        Many shall say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, haue we not prophecied in thy name? &amp;c. &amp; then will I professe vnto them, I neuer knew you: Depart from me, ye that worke iniquitie. Secondly, we answer, The words alledged by Bertius, 1 Sam. 9. 2. speake of the lineaments of his body, and proper personage, not of the inward vertues of his minde, or graces of his soule [There was not a goodlyer, the text saith not a godlyer, person than hee; from the shoulders, and vpward, he was higher than any of the people] To argue from stature to grace, from the bodie to the soule, from proceritie to sinceritie, from a corruptible crowne, to an incorruptible, is scopam dissolutam facere, to make a besome without a band, or to make a rope of sands. Lastly, this Obiection may be retorted against the Aduersarie, thus:
                     
                        
The gifts and calling by God of the regenerate are without repentance, Rom. 11. 29.
                     
                        Sauls gifts and calling by God were not without repentance; for the text saith, 1 Sam. 15. 11. God repented him, that he had made Saul King, &amp;c.
                     
                     Therefore Sauls gifts and calling were not the calling and gifts of the regenerate.
                  
                  
                     
                        i To the second instance in Salomon wee answer: That Salomon was indeed a childe of God, and is called the beloued of the Lord, because the Lord loued him indeed, 2 Sam. 7. 12. But we deny, that he fell from grace either totally, or finally. Hee was a type of Christ, a pen-man of the holy Ghost; God threatned grieuously to scourge him for his sinnes, yet promised withall neuer quite to cast him off. His fall, I confesse, was grieuous, but his repentance in his booke of the Preacher sheweth that the seed of God still remained in him, as it doth in all the children of God, 1 Ioh. 3. 9. This seed, because it is immortall, 1 Pet. 1. 23. preserueth euery childe of God, in whom it remaineth, from eternall death. Lastly, this Argument may be retorted against the Aduersary, thus:
                     If God withdrew not his louing kindnesse vtterly from Salomon, Salomon fell not from grace totally, nor finally.
                     
                        
God withdrew not his louing kindnesse vtterly from Salomon:
                     
                     Therefore Salomon fell not from Grace totally, nor finally.
                     The first proposition is manifest; for vtterly &amp; totally are termes equiualent, and it is certain, that whosoeuer falleth not totally, cānot fall finally. The second proposition may be deduced out of Psa. 89. 31, 32, 33, 34, 35.

Neither doth attaining, but consummation keepe a man for God &amp;c. Salomon, and Saul, and many other, so long as they walked in the wayes of the Lord, could retaine the grace giuen them, but when the discipline or feare of the Lord departed from them, grace also departed.
                  
                     Answer to Gag. pag. 168. saith thus; And in Nazianzen too, Apolog. ad Patrem, p. 37. who writeth thus of Saul, &amp;c.

                        k To the place alledged out of Tertullian, wee answer: First, The Appealer falsly translates the words of Tertullian, whose words are not (probatus (à Deo) a man approued (by God:) but simply (probatus) that

is, a man approued, or well thought of; as probatus Author, an approued Author, or generally well esteemed. And that by (probatus) he meant not approued by God, his words following in the same Chapter seeme to me to make euident, his words are about seuen lines after, Tu vt homo extrinsecus vnumquem
                              
                                 
                              
                              que
                            nosti; putas quod vides, vides autem quous
                              
                                 
                              
                              que
                            oculos habes, sed oculi sunt Domini alti; Homo in faciem, Deus in praecordia contemplatur; ideo cognoscit Dominus qui sint eius. Thou as man knowest euery man by the outside, thou thinkest that to be which thou seest; thou seest as farre as thou hast eyes, but the Lords eyes are high: man looketh on the face, God beholdeth the heart; therefore the Lord knoweth who are his. Secondly, the instances of Tertullian are of a different kinde. Saul and Salomon were not alike: Salomon a glorious type of Christ; Saul rather of Antichrist. Salomon is called by the holy Ghost Iedidiah, beloued of God. Saul neuer was so called: Saul therefore might fall totally, and finally; but for Salomon wee resolue with the Reuerend and excellently learned Bishop of Sarisbury in the words of Tertullian himselfe;

                            fuit in co spiritualis vitae robur, non amotum; concussum, non excussum: There was in Salomons fall a remission or abatement of the grace of faith, an intermission of the act, not an amission of the habit; the

strength and vigour of his spirituall life was moued in him, not remoued: shaken, but not shaken out, or quite lost, Tertullian speakes of Peter, but it may be applied as well to Dauid and Salomon, who are not said here to haue lost grace totally, and finally, but to haue fallen into grieuous sinnes, the one into adultery, the other into idolatry. And, notwithstanding Dauids fall, that hee retained the Spirit of Grace in him, it is manifest out of that prayer of his in the 51. Psalme, Renoua spiritum rectum intra me, Renew a right Spirit within me, vers. 10. Spiritum sanctum ne recipias àme; Take not thy holy Spirit from me, vers. 11. Establish me with thy free Spirit, vers. 12. These prayers of that holy Prophet shew, that Dauid in his grieuous fall lost the comfort of Gods Spirit, vers. 12. and the free and quickning motions thereof: and therefore he humbly desires a renouation, and confirmation of the Spirit, but not a new donation thereof. That, which he prayes to God not to take from him, certainly he had in some degree, when he so prayed, Take not thy Spirit from me. As for Salomons recouery after his fall, we haue the testimonies of Gregory of Neocaesarea, Cyril of Ierusalem, Hilary, Ierome, Ambrose, Aquinas, Bonauenture, Hugo Cardinalis, Petrus Comestor, Paulus Burgensis, Carthusian, Soto, Genebrard, Serarius, Delrius, Lorinus, and many other cited to our hands by Caleb Dalichampius student in Scedan, in his booke

intituled Vinditiae Salomonis. Lastly, this place of Tertullian, de praescript. cap. 3. If it had beene entirely cited by the Appealer, would haue vtterly ouerthrown that, for which it is cited. If those words (nemo autem Christianus, alledged by the Appealer) nisi qui ad finem perseuerauerit; That no man is a Christian, but he that perseueres to the end) wound not the Appealers Tenet; yet the words following in the end of this very Chapter cut the very throat thereof: Miramur de Ecclesijs eius si à quibusdam deseruntur, quum ea nos ostendunt Christianos, quae patimur ad exemplumipsius Christi: ex nobis, inquit, prodierunt, sed non fuerunt ex nobis; si fuissent ex nobis, permansissent vti
                              
                                 
                              
                              que
                            nobiscum. Maruell we if some forsake the Churches of Christ, whereas those those things which we suffer after the example of Christ doe manifest vs to be Christians: They went out from vs, but they were not of vs: for if they had beene of vs, they would no doubt haue continued with vs, saith Saint Iohn, 1 Epist. 2. 19. In this allegation, as many other in his booke, the Appealer resembles the Cappuchin Friers; who, when they haue gathered great store of meat at rich mens doores, I know not out of what blinde superstition, they eat the worst, and leaue the best, and daintiest meat, and vain-gloriously put it into the Almes-box, and giue it to beggers at the doore.
                  
                  
                     
                        l To the place of Saint Cyprian Epist. 7. we answer:

First, that Saint Cyprian in that Epistle exhorts Rogatianus, and other Confessors, to perseuere in the profession of their holy faith, &amp; therefore this place is brought obtorto collo, for Apostasie. His words are, immediatly before the words alledged by the Appealer and Bertius, Danda opera est, vt post haec initia, ad incrementa quoque veniatur, &amp; consummetur in vobis, quod iam foelicibus rudimentis esse coepistis; You must vse diligence, that after these beginnings you may proceed, and that may be perfected in you which is happily begun. Secondly, we answer: Cyprian saith, that Saul and Salomon lost the grace which was giuen them, but expresseth not what grace he meant; whether gratiam gratis datam, or gratiam gratum facientem; whether the grace of illumination only, or of sanctification; whether the spirit of Prophecie, or of Gouernment, or of Regeneration. Thirdly, whether he meaneth grace of wisdome, or grace of holinesse, ordinary, or extraordinary gifts of the Spirit; hee saith not that the Spirit or grace departed from them totally or finally: and therefore this shaft is not onely blunt in it selfe, but also falls very short of the marke. Lastly, Saint Cyprian, as he perseuered himselfe a constant Martyr to the end, so is he a great patron of the perseuerance of Saints. In his booke against Nouatia
                              •
                           
                         of the Vnity of the Church, he sets a marke vpon backsliders, to distinguish them from good men and true beleeuers:

Nemo aestimet bonos de Ecclesiâ posse decedere, Let no man imagine that good men can (marke the word Posse) depart from the true Church: Triticum non rapit ventus, nec arborem solidâ radice fundatam procella subuertit; inanes paleae tempestate iactantur, inualidae arbores turbinis incursione euertuntur: The wind doth not blow away corne, neither doth a storme ouerturne a tree deepely and strongly rooted; it is emptie chaffe that the wind scattereth, and they are weake and rotten trees that are ouerthrowne in a storme. In this sweet straine Saint Cyprian playeth on his Master Tertullians Key; 
                        Tertullian. de praescript. c. 3.  
                        Auolent quantum volent paleae leuis fidei quocun
                              
                                 
                              
                              que
                            afflatu tentationum, eo purior mass a frumenti in horrea domini reponetur. Let the Chaffe, that is, men of light beleefe, be blowne or flie away with euery puffe of temptation, by this meanes Gods floore is purged and cleansed. I maruell none of this Chaffe flew in Bertius eyes, to make him misse his way to Paris; who destitute of better arguments for Apostasie, became himselfe an example of Apostafie; but the best is, before his departure he was knowne to be no Saint. He went away from vs, because he was not of vs, for if he had beene of vs, he would without doubt haue remained with vs, according to the words of Saint Iohn, 1 Epist. 2. alledged by Tertullian and Saint Cyprian in both passages.
                  
                  
                     
                        m To the place alledged out of Nazianzen, we answer:

                        Virgil. Aenead. 4.  That it is like Didoes sword wherewith shee pierced her owne bowels; Non hos quaesitum munus in vsus. If Bertius, who only tasted Nazianzens waters in a muddy streame; or the Appealer, who hath drunke deepely of them in the pure fountaine, had searched diligently thorow all the writings of that profound Diuine for a testimony against themselues, they could hardly meet with a more pregnant. Because Saul, saith this holy Father, became not purely and sincerely another man, nor gaue himselfe wholly and entirely to be directed by the Spirit, he came to a fearefull end. Hypocrites therefore, and such as are not sincerely conuerted, and truly regenerate, may fall away: not they, who wholly and entirely yeeld themselues to the guidance of Gods Spirit; not they who by an vnfained conuersion become perfectly and sincerely other men. To the former, as saith this Father, God is a light, to the latter he is a fire: the former he enlightneth only; the latter he heateth also, melteth their heart, purgeth them from all their drosse. Or, if that eloquent Father take light in the good sense, and fire in the worse, then his meaning is, that as the word of God is a sauour of life vnto life in them that are saued, and a sauour of death vnto death in them that perish; so God himselfe is a Comfortable light to the true children of light, but a consuming fire to Hypocrites, and Apostatates, and all such as haue fellowship

with the vnfruitfull works of darknesse, much more those who vtterly forsake God, and consult with the Deuill, as Saul did; and others of that his desperat resolution: Flectere si nequeo superos Acheronta mouebo. I will make a league with Death, and couenant with Hell.
                     
                  
                  
                     
                        n To the passages alledged out of Saint Augustine we answer most willingly, we desire to heare none rather than Saint Augustine speake in this Cause: Neuer had the Church of God since the Apostle Saint Paul, a more valiant and resolute Champion of Grace, than Saint Augustine. As Tully spake of the ancient Rhetoritians, Cicero de

                        Potius ex arte quàm de arte scripserunt, They rather wrote out of art, than of the art: So may it be truly said of Saint Augustines workes against the Pelagians, non tam de gratiâ, quàm ex gratiâ scripsisse videtur, That he wrote rather and spake from grace, than of grace, so full of grace are his lips, and pen in this argument of Grace. I could easily point to many places in the Workes of this holy Father, especially those extant in his seuenth Tome, 
                           
                              〈…〉

Verily Saint Augustine so professedly and strongly opposeth both the Pelagian, Demi-pelagian, and now Arminian errors, that as Pelagius himselfe in a Synod at Ierusalem being

pressed with Saint Augustines Reasons and Authorities,

To the first we answer, It toucheth not the state of the present question; The state of Saints in Grace may be sure enough, yet they not alwaies assured of it. There is a certitude of the subiect, and a certitude of the obiect, that which now is in debate, is not the certitude of the subiect, whether the Regenerate are assured in themselues of their Perseuerance; but the certitude of the obiect, whether their perseuerance in it selfe be certaine. This distinction is acknowledged generally by those Interpreters who comment on that of Saint Peter,

                        Make your election sure: that is, say they, to your selues, and your own hearts, not in it selfe, nor in respect of God, For the foundation of God standeth sure, 
                        2 Tim. 2. 19.  
                        hauing this Seale, The Lord knoweth who are his: neither can any thing done by man adde strength to Gods decree. But because our assurance of Election, and the state of Adoption, and Grace, and perseuerance in the same, is partly from the testimony of the Spirit within vs, and partly from the effects of Grace, to wit, the fruits of righteousnesse; and 
because when we grieue the Spirit of God, hee withdraweth his Spirit for a time, and thereby both the testimony of the Spirit is silent for the time, &amp; the effects of Grace cease; Saint Augustine humbly and truly professeth, that the Saints, albeit they are certaine of the reward of their perseuerance, yet are found vncertaine of their perseuerance it selfe; Quis cum hominum se in actione, profectu

They are certaine, certitudine fidei, by the assurance of faith, but not certaine, certitudine scientiae, &amp; experientiae, by the certainty of knowledge and experience, as Bucer acutely distinguisheth: Bucer. lib. Concord.  they are certaine of perseuerance in it selfe; yet they are found, that is, you may finde them in that state by reason of some fearfull temptation, not certaine in themselues; nay sometimes they in themselues receiue the sentence of death, to humble them, and make them pray with sighes and groanes which cannot be expressed, Restore vnto me the ioy of saluation, and vphold me with thy free Spirit, Psal. 51. 12. Lastly, there is a double perseuerance:
                        
                           1. A perseuerance in a course of sanctity vnto the end, without any interruption or stop, when a childe of God goeth still forward, and neuer is cast backe, but continueth, as Saint Augustine speaketh, In actione profectu

                                  iustitiae; Still in the action and progresse

of righteousnesse: and of such perseuerance the Saints are not certaine in this life.
                           2. A perseuerance vnto the end, yet not without some interruption and going back also for a time, but without any totall or finall back-sliding; and of such perseuerance a Saint of God may and ought to be assured.

Yet Saint Augustine in other places hath such words: But his meaning is very plaine; He speakes of a temporary faith and common grace, Aug. de Corrept. &amp; Grat. cap.

                        not a iustifying faith, and sauing grace. His owne words are, Let it not moue vs that God giueth not some of his children perseuerance; Absit enim vt ita esset, si de illi
                           •
                         praedestinatis essent, &amp; secundùm propositum vocatis, qui verè sunt filij promissionis; God forbid that it should be so, if they were of the Predestinate, and those which are called according to purpose, which truly are the children of promise. And a little after, Rursus quidam, qui filij Dei propter susceptam vel temporaliter gratiam dicuntur à nobis, nec sunt tamen Deo; de quibus ait Iohannes, ex nobis exierunt, sed non erant ex nobis; hoc est, &amp; quando videbantur in nobis, non erant ex nobis, &amp; tanquam

                        i diceretur

vnde id ostendis, quòd si fuissent inquit ex nobis, permansissent nobiscum. Againe some, who are called by vs the sonnes of God, in respect of the temporall grace they haue receiued, are not so vnto God: of whom Saint Iohn saith, They went out from vs, but were not of vs; that is, and when they were seene amongst vs, they were not of vs. And as if it were obiected to him, Whence doest thou shew that? For if they had beene, saith he, of vs, they would haue remained with vs. In the same booke, De Corrept. &amp; Gratiâ, Horum fides, quae per dilectionem operatur, profecto aut omnino non deficit, aut si qui sunt quorum deficit, reparatur antequam vita ista finiatur; &amp; delet â quae intercurrerat iniquitate vs

The faith of these men which worketh by loue verily either faileth not at all, or if it faile in any, it is repaired againe before this life ends; and the wickednesse which comes betweene being blotted out, it is reputed for perseuerance to the end. But those who perseuere not, but so fall from Christian faith and conuersation, that the end of this life findes them such, without doubt they were not to be accounted in that number, no not then, when they liued well and godly. And Chapter 9. Qui non habuerunt perseuerantiam, sicut

non verè discipuli Christi, ita nec verè filij Dei fuerunt, etiam quando esse videbantur, &amp; ita vocabantur: Those who had not perseuerance, as they were not truly disciples of Christ, so neither were they truly the sonnes of God, no not when they seemed to be so, and called so. In producing testimonies of Saint Augustine, Inopem me copia facit, Store is a sore vnto me; I will content my selfe onely with such passages as offer themselues vnto me in that very booke and chapter cited by the Appealer for the contrary.

                           .  
                        Thus the Chapter begins, These brethren, as you write, (He speaketh of the Demipelagians, and Massilians, against whom Prosper and Hilary had made a remonstrance vnto him) will not yeeld that such perseuerance should be taught, which cannot be lost by contumacie; where they doe not well obserue what they say; for we speake of perseuerance to the end; which if it be giuen, the partie to whom it is giuen perseueres to the end. Multi eam possunt habere, nullus amittere: hoc Dei donum suppliciter emereri potest, sed cum datum fuerit amitti contumaciter non potest. Quomodo enim potest amitti, per quod fit, vt non amittatur etiam quod posset amitti? Many may haue perseuerance, none can lose it; this gift of God may be gained by humble prayer, but once giuen cannot be lost by contumacy. For how can that be lost, which makes, that what otherwise might be lost cannot be lost? I pitie here the Appealers ill hap, who like the Miser in the Greeke

                        Epigram, that going to the place where hee thought he laid vp his treasure safe, found there no treasure, but a rope wherewith he stopt his wind-pipe.

                        To the place alledged out of Prosper, Respons. 7. ad Capit. Gallorum, we answer: First, that Saint Prosper, Saint Augustines faithfull Scholler and great admirer, in the passage alledged concurreth with him. Both of them in words seeme to affirme, 
                        August. de Corrept. &amp; Grat. c. 
                              •
                           . That a regenerate and iustified man may fall by his free-will into foule and enormous sinnes, and die in them: but lest any should stumble at this sentence vnawares, Saint Augustine in the ninth chapter of the same booke giues them warning, and most plainly declares his meaning: Appellamus eos electos Christi discipulos &amp; Dei filios, quia sic appellandi sunt, quos regeneratos piè viuere cernimus; sed tunc verè sunt quod appellantur, si manserint in eo propter quod sic appellantur. Si autem perseuerantiam non habent, id est, in eo quod caeperunt esse non manent, non verè appellantur, quod appellantur, &amp; non sunt: apud eum enim hoc non sunt, cui notum est quod futuri sunt. We call all those chosen disciples of Christ, and sonnes of God, because those whom we see liue godly, and are regenerate, are to be so called; but then are they truly that which they are called, if they remaine in that, for which they are so called. But if they haue not perseuerance, that is, if they remaine not in that which they began to be, they are not truly called that which

they are called, and are not; for they are not so to him, who knoweth what they will be. Secondly, Saint Prosper, with Saint Hilary, made a ioynt relation to Saint Augustine of the Demipelagian and Massilian errors, and desired Saint Augustines assistance against them. Of these one was, (as their Epistles to Saint Augustine make it manifest.) Nulli dari perseuerantiam talem à quâ non permittitur praeuaricari, sed à quâ possit suâ voluntate deficere, There is no such perseuerance giuen to any man, from which he is not suffered to reuolt; but such from which a man may by his free-will fall away. Against which I oppose that sentence of Saint Augustine, as a fortresse impregnable: 
                        Aug. de Corrept. &amp; Grat. cap. 
                              •
                           .  An audebis dicere, etiam rogante Christo ne deficeret fides Petri, defecturam fuisse, si Petrus eam deficere voluisset? quasi aliud Petrus vllo modo vellet, quàm pro illo Christus rogasset, vt vellet. Nam quis ignorat tunc fuisse perituram fidem Petri, si ea quae fidelis erat voluntas ipsa deficeret, sed quia praeparatur voluntas à Domino, ideo pro illo Christi non possit esse inanis oratio. Quando rogauit ergone fides eius deficeret, quid aliud rogauit nisi vt haberet in fide liberrimam, fortissimam, inuictissimam, perseuerantissimam voluntatem? Ecce quemadmodum secundum gratiam Dei, non contra eam libertas defenditur voluntatis: voluntas quippe humana non libertate consequitur gratiam, sed gratia potius libertatem, &amp; vt perseueret delectabilem perpetuitatem, &amp; insuperabilem

fortitudinem. When Christ prayed for the faith of Peter that it might not faile, what other thing did he aske, but that he might haue a most free, a most resolute, a most vnconquerable, a most perseuering will in the faith? Behold how the freedome of the will is defended by vs according to Gods grace not against it: for the will of man doth not by her freedome obtaine grace, but by grace freedome, and a delightfull perpetuitie, and inuincible power to perseuere.

                           ic. 5. Prideaux. Lect. 6. p. 123. we answer: First, that it is of all other most weak &amp; childish; for it doth not at all touch the state of the question, as is obserued by Suarez, the German Diuines at the Hage Conference, the English Diuines present at the Synod of Dort, his Maiesties publique Professor of Diuinity in Oxford. The question is of those, who are iustified by the Act of faith, conceiued by the preaching of the Gospell, who fall into actuall sins wounding their conscience, whether such thereby

lose the habit of Grace, and totally and finally fall away from the state of iustification? Now infants haue not the actuall vse of reason, neither doth their faith, if so they haue infused faith, actually apprehend and apply the promises of the Gospell: neither can they be supposed to commit those crying actuall sins, which the Appealer calls mortall, (I hope not in the Popish sense) which cannot stand with the Grace of iustification, as is pretended by the Arminians, and Appealer. Secondly, we answer: That although in a good sense a child may be said to be put into the state of Grace and Saluation, because thereby the infant is admitted into the Church, and participateth of the meanes of saluation; yet, if wee speake properly and precisely, the Sacraments seale, and not conferre grace; or, as the Church of England speaketh by her learned Apologist, Iud Artic.

                        doe not begin, but rather continue and confirme our incorporation, by Christ. The Sacrament is a seale of the Couenant, the conditions are supposed to be drawn and assented vnto before the seale be put to the instrument. The Seale without the Couenant is not auaileable; the Couenant may be without the Seale: we are tyed to Gods Ordinances, God is not. The contempt of Baptisme is damnable, the defect in the children of the Elect and seed of the faithfull, comprised in the Couenant with their fathers, is not so: if all possible meanes haue beene

vsed by the Parents and Minister to procure them Baptisme before God call them away, there is no danger to the Parents, much lesse to the Children. For the ineuitable defect of Baptisme may be supplyed either by a desire of Baptisme, as in Valentinian; or by profession of faith, as in the Theefe vpon the Crosse; or by the bloud of Martyrdome, as in the Innocents put to death by Herod. Thirdly, we answer, All that are regenerate Sacramentally are not necessarily and infallibly regenerated spiritually: A man may be baptised with water, and yet not with the holy Ghost. Ismael was circumcised as well as Isaak, Esau as well as Iacob, Simon Magus was baptised as well as Simon Peter. Our Church in Charitie,

Yet vndoubtedly our Church attributeth no more vertue to the Sacraments than the Ancient Church did. Theoderets obseruation is well knowne, Gratia Sacramentum aliquando praecedit, aliquando sequitur, aliquando nec sequitur: Grace sometimes goes before the sacrament, somtimes follows it, somtimes it follows it not at all.

                        Many are baptized with water, which are not baptised with the holy Ghost; they seeme to be the sons of God in regard of their Baptisme, but indeed they are not the sonnes of God, because they are not baptised with the holy Ghost.

                           . in epist ad Gal. cap. 3.  Saint Ierome, Si quis hoc corporeum, quod oculis carnis aspicitur, aquae tantum accipit lauacrum, non est indutus dominum Iesum. Nam &amp; Simon ille Magus

acceperat lauacrum aquae, verum quia Spiritum sanctum non habebat, indutus non erat Christum. Et haeretici vel hypocritae, &amp; hi qui sordidè victitant, videntur quidem accipere baptismum, sed nescio an Christi habeant indumentum. If any man receiue only the visible lauer of water, he hath not put on Christ, &amp;c. From these and many other the like testimonies of the Ancient Fathers, I infer, that the foundation of this argument is sandy and sinking; Although the inward grace ordinarily accompany the outward signe, and we ought to beleeue by the iudgement of Charity, that all who are baptised are truly regenerate: 
                        
                           
                              〈…〉
                           
                          yet iudicio veritatis, as Iunius distinguisheth, that is, by the iudgement of precise and infallible truth all are not so, as the Fathers speake roundly and plainly. Now as in the iudgement of Charity we are to beleeue, that all that are baptised are regenerate, so by the same iudgement we are to beleeue, that, though they fall into grieuous sinne, and sometime come to a fearefull outward end, God notwithstanding giueth them grace to repent at the last gaspe, and consequently they fall not away finally. Inter sacrum &amp; saxum, inter pontem &amp; fontem misericordia. Lastly, this Obiection may be retorted against the Aduersarie thus.
                     If Baptisme may not be reiterated, then the grace of regeneration cannot be totally lost.
                     
                        
But Baptisme may not be * As the Church

                     The consequence of the maior is thus made euident. A man that hath lost the grace of regeneration totally, is as if he neuer had been regenerated, and therefore must be borne again: if borne againe, againe baptised: because the signe and the thing signified, or, as they make it, the cause and proper effect cannot be seuered; if then the effect, to wit, regeneration be lost, and must be reproduced, the proper cause, as they say, the necessary condition and seale, as we say, must be againe put. If regeneration may bee had the second time without Baptisme, why not at first? which the Aduersaries absolutely deny, Iohn 3. 5.  pressing farre that text, Vnlesse a man be borne againe of water, and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdome of heauen. It is a thing vnconceiueable, that the shadow should be more permanent than the substance; the Baptisme of water, than that of the holy Ghost. If then a regenerate man lose totally his regeneration, and be as if he had neuer beene regenerate, he is as if he had neuer beene baptised. This reason may be further confirmed; when this question is propounded, why Baptisme is but once to be administred, and the Lords Supper often? It is most vsually answered, because a man is borne but once, but is fed often.

The edge of this argument cannot be turned by the Aduersarie, vnlesse he can shew more Regenerations in Scripture then Baptismes, or any new Regeneration without a new lauer, any new Couenant without an authenticall instrument and new seale.
                  
                  
                     
                        r To the reason drawne from mortall sinne in the regenerate, we answer: First, if mortall sinne be taken for such sinne as deserueth of it selfe eternall death, all sinne is mortall: if by mortall sinne such sinne for which a man is bound ouer by God, and sentenced to eternall death, no sinne in the Elect is mortall: for how grieuous soeuer they sinne, the seed of God remaines in them, which in time will bring forth repentance, and repentance saluation. In the interìm betweene their sinne and the renued act of their repentance, God suspendeth, but he reuoketh not his pardon of their sinnes: he is angrie with them, and they indeed haue forfeited their estate in his grace and fauour, and title to the Kingdome of Heauen, but God will not take the forfeit; they lose the sense and present fruit, but not the state of iustification. Habituall repentance they haue alwayes, and shall haue the Act, if the sinne be such for which habituall repentance, and the continuall asking of a generall pardon for all sinne will not suffice. A tender hearted father though his sonne prouoke him very farre, so that hee chastise him with many

stripes, yet will hee hardly be brought to disinherite him; Rom.

                          yet if a father could, God will not; for if euer sonnes, then heires, if euer iustified, then glorified. The Apostle will make good the Consequence, if the Spirit in our heart make good the Antecedent. Lastly, this Obiection may be retorted thus.

                     Therefore some sinnes in their owne nature mortall, doe not put the regenerate out of the state of grace.

of Generall Councels) the Appealer (howsoeuer
by distinguishing of points fundamentall, and
accessory) endeuoureth to difference his opinion
from the Church of Rome, and reconcile it to the
Article; yet in truth he faileth in both. For first, the
Church of Rome holdeth all doctrines de fide, determined
by the Church, to be necessary to saluation,
and consequently, in the Appealers sense, fundamentall
points. In particular, she defineth the decisions
of the Councell of Trent, in the controuerted
points betweene vs, to be part of the Catholike
Faith, without which no man can be saued: Pius 4
in Bullâ super formâ juram. pag. 441. If therefore the
Appealer, maintaine, as hee doth, That Generall
Councells cannot erre in matters fundamentall, and

necessary to saluation, he holdeth consequently, that
they cannot erre in matter de fide. Secondly, his doctrine
cannot stand with the Article of our Church;
for the Article both supposeth, and proueth, that Generall
Councels may erre, euen in points necessary
to saluation: It supposeth it, in those words [things
ordained of them, as necessary to salvation, haue neither
strength, nor authority, vnlesse, &amp;c.] For if Generall
Councels could not erre in things necessary to saluation,
we might in such things safely rely vpon their
authoritie without warrant of Scripture; which the
Article expressely denyeth. If Generall Councels may
iudge those things to be necessary to saluation, which
are not, (as the Article implyeth,) they may in like
manner iudge, those things not to bee necessary to
saluation, which are; and so erre bothe wayes in the
iudgement of points necessary, and fundamentall.
And verily the reason, annexed to the Article, concludeth
as strongly, that Generall Councels may
erre in fundamentals, as in Accessory: the reason is,
because [Generall Councels are an Assembly of men,
whereof all are not gouerned by the Spirit, and Word of
God: Now they who are not gouerned by the Spirit
and Word of God, haue, and may erre euen in
points fundamentall; in asmuch as nothing can preserue
a man from fundamentall error, but the Spirit,

and Word of God, whereby they are not gouerned,
as hath the Article. Notwithstanding all this iarring
and discord from the Article, I find some harmony
and concord in the close, Appeale pag. 147.

accepted and allowed

                  Note in this maine point of Iustification, That
the Appealer differeth from the Church of England,
and consenteth to the Church of Rome, in three remarkable
particulars.
                  
                     1 In the signification of the word, [To iustifie,]
which the Appealer, and the Church of Rome
take for [making a man righteous.] The Church
of England, and the Protestants generally, for
[accounting, declaring, or pronouncing a man righteous.
                     
                     2 The Church of England maketh Iustification
to consist onely in forgiuenesse of sinnes. The
Appealer, and Church of Rome, not onely in
forgiuenesse of sins, but partly in it, and partly
in sanctifying graces infused.
                     3 The Church of England teacheth, That wee
are not iustified by inherent righteousnesse, or, by
any vertue within vs. The church of Rome, and

the Appealer hold, That we are iustified by sanctifying
and regenerating graces within vs, whereby
wee are transformed in minde, and renewed in
soule. By renewing grace inherent in vs, wee
are sanctified, but not iustified: the confounding
of Sanctification with Iustification (as
the Appealer and Papists doe) is an errour of
dangerous consequence, as the learned well
know.

blasphemy.
               
               
                  
                  Obserue reader, that the Appealer ignorantly, or
fraudulently omitteth the proper conditions requisite
to a meritorious act, which are especially these:

                        1 That the worke be properly our: and not
his, of whom we pretend to merit.
                        2 That it be opus indebitum, a worke to which otherwise
we are not bound.
                        3 That it be some way profitable, and beneficiall
to him, from whom wee expect our reward.
                        4 That it haue some proportion, and correspondence
(of congruity at least, if not of condignitie)
to the reward expected.
                     
                  
                  All which conditions Protestants deny to bee
found in our good works. And therupon disclaime
all merit. These conditions the Appealer pretermitteth,
and from foure common conditions, requisite
to a good worke in generall, he concludeth loosely,
and weakly, That the Papists and wee agree in the
doctrine of merit (ex condigno) of condignitie. In his
Appeale Chap. 11. (by the advice, as it seemes, of the
Approuer of his booke) hee disclaimeth merit of
condignity, which in his former booke he seemed
to approue. But he saith little or nothing which may
not well stand with merit of congruity. Indeed hee

lasheth Vasques for that, wherein he differeth from
other Papists: but he retracteth not any where that
his owne sentence, namely, The eternall state of men
is diuersified to their deseruings. Wherein hee crosseth
the 11 Article, and the words of S. Paul, Rom. 6.
The wages of sinne is death, but the gift of God is eternall
life.

indeed there is a
maine difference;
and most of our

then they
would acknowledge
the Popish
reall presence. See

the Acts and Monuments.
Secondly,
he saith, that the
manner is vnutterable;
whereas the
Church of England
defineth the
manner. Thirdly,
in that he saith, we
skill not of, or make
matter, of transubstantiation,
or consubstantiatiō: wheras
the Church of

as a
grosse and dangerous

present in the Sacrament, then to the hearts of
beleeuers, and that by faith onely) let the Appealers
poore Woodcocke, or Catholike Cockscombe, pag. 251. tell

                        1 The Church of England condemneth in the
Article, the popish doctrine concerning the
worshipping of Images. The Appealer approueth
the doctrine, and condemneth the practice
onely.
                        2 The Church of England teacheth it to be vnlawfull,
to set vp Images in Churches, because
it cannot be done without vnauoidable perill
of Idolatry. The Appealer alloweth the setting
them vp in Churches.
                        3 The Church of England forbiddeth all religious
vse of Images, allowing meere ciuill, or
historicall. The Appealer alloweth Images
for religious imployments.
                        4 The Church of England denyeth any worship
due to Images. The Appealer granteth
any worship, saue Latria: hee stickes not at
Dulia, if it trench not vpon Latria.

onely hee disclaymeth their practice, as also Polidor

signe of the Crosse
workes miracles, not
out of a natural virtue
that it hath, as

signe instituted of

there are three wonderfull
effects of the

away diseases, and
all euils. 3. It sanctifieth
those things
vpon which it is imprinted.
The first
effect it hath from
three causes: from
the apprehension of
the deuill, the deuotion
of man, and institution
of God. For

the Deuill when he
seeth the Crosse presently
remembreth,
that by the Crosse of
Christ, hee was conquerd,
spoild, bound,
&amp; discōsited. Hence
it is, that he flyes
from the Crosse, as
a Dog doth from a
stone, or staffe, with
which he hath beene
strucke. Againe, the
Crosse hath a force
from the worke of
him, that worketh
with it, or vseth it;
after the same manner
as prayer hath.
For the signe of the
Crosse is a kinde of
the calling vpon the
merits of Christ crucified▪
expressed by
the signe of the
Crosse.

                  In this point, touching the signe of the Crosse, the

two particulars.
                  1 He falsely imposeth vpon the Church of England,
That in her forme of Baptisme shee vseth the
signe of the Crosse vpon the forehead, and elsewhere.
That [else-where] is not to be found in
the forme of Baptisme, or els-where in the constitution,
or practice of our Church.
                  2 He ascribeth operatiue Power, and experimented
effects, to the Crosse: and seemes to father some
such error vpon the Church of England, saying,
That wee signe the flesh, that the soule may be
fortified, so wee: wheras the Church of England
in the Canon, will haue no power, or efficacy,
to be ascribed to the signe of the Crosse; but
onely a kinde of significancy, and honorable
representation of Christs death vpon the Cross.
And more then this, I will not beleeue touching
any efficacy of the signe of the Crosse, till I
finde by experience, that the Appealers signing
his lips with the signe of the Crosse, makes him
a faire-spoken, and his signing himselfe on the
brest with the signe of the Crosse, makes him
a Good man.

                  In this point touching the Inuocation of Saints:
the Appealer differeth from the Church of England
in two particulars:

                        1 That he maketh a difference betweene Angels,
(especially Guardians) and other Saints, in respect
of Invocation: whereas the Church of
England putteth no such difference. But indifferently
forbiddeth the calling vpon Saints departed,
or Angells: Guardians, or others. And
the reasons they alledge are as strong against
the one, as the other.
                        2 The Appealer denyeth Inuocation of Saints,
onely vpon this ground; that the Saints departed,
ordinarily, know not our affayres:
and consequently, he maketh Popish Invocation
idle and foolish, but not impious, blasphemous,
iniurious to God, and our Sauiour.
Whereas, the Church of England denyeth Invocation
of Saints vpon many other grounds;
and maketh it idolatrous, iniurious to Christ,
yea and blasphemous, as appeareth in the places
aboue alleadged,

are two Sacraments
ordained of
Christ in the Gospell,
that is to say,
Baptisme and the
Supper of the
Lord. Those fiue
commonly called
Sacraments, Confirmation,
Penāce,
Orders, Matrimony,
&amp; Extreme vnction,
are not to be
counted for Sacraments
of the Gospel,
being such as
haue growne partly
of the corrupt
following of the
Apostles, partly are
states of life allowed
in Scriptures.
But yet haue not
like nature of Sacramēts
with Baptisme
&amp; the L. Supper.
               
               
                  
                  In this point touching Extreme vnction, though
the Appealer doe not fully ioyne hands with the Papists,
and shake hands with the Church of England;
yet he maketh the vsing of Extreme vnction, or not
vsing it; the attributing of such effects, as the Church
of Rome erroniously (if not impiously) ascribeth to
it, or not attributing, a light matter, of no great importance;
a thing indeed not to be obtruded vpon
the Church, as necessary: yet a thing, for ought that
he saith to the contrary, that may be not vnlawfully
vsed. Whereas the Church of England, or at least,
the most approued Writers in the Church of England,
make the adding of any new Sacrament, and
attributing a diuine, &amp; spirituall effect vnto it, without
commandement, or warrant of God's word,
to be a grieuous sinne, &amp; breach of the second Commandement.
And if it may haue such an effect, as to
wipe away all sinnes remaining in the sicke, our
Church should very much wrong the sicke not to
administer it to them. It concernes vs therefore to enquire
of any such effects, and finding that it hath
none, to condemne it, as not onely vnwarranted by
Scripture, but also derogatory to the efficacy of the
the other Sacraments, and Christs blood.

of Gregory
expresly against
them: who, writing
to Mauritius
the Emperour,
condemned Iohn
Bishop of Constantinople in that
behalf, calling him
the Prince of pride,
Lucifers successor,
and the forerunner
of Antichrist.
S. Bernard agreeing
thereunto, saith, What greater pride can there bee,
then that one man should preferre his owne iudgement
before the whole congregation, as if hee onely had the

Spirit of God? And Chrysostome pronounceth a terrible
sentence against them, affiriming plainly, that whosoeuer seeketh
to be chiefe on earth, shall finde confusion in heauen:
and he, that striueth for the supremacy, shall not be reputed
among the Seruants of Christ.
                  
                     Homily against wilfull rebellion, 5 part, pag. 308. 309. The
Bishop of Rome being by the order of Gods word none
other then the Bishop of that one See and Diocesse, and neuer
yet well able to gouerne the same, did by intolerable
ambition challenge not onely to be Head of all the Church
dispersed through the world, but also to be Lord ouer all
Kingdomes of the world.
               
               
                  In this point, touching the Popes Primacy, though
the Appealer comes not full home to the tenent of
the Church of Rome, yet he goeth too far, &amp; pointeth
at a most dangerous course, of referring the
iudgement of controuersies of faith, that concerne
the whole Church, vnto the Pope. Which course,
if (with Master Mountagues good approbation) we
should take in the great controuersie touching the
Head of the Church, the Power of the See of Rome,
the causes of our Separation from that Church, and
all the controuerted points betweene vs, conclamatum
esset; he, that hath but halfe an eye, might see,
what the issue would bee. This resolution of M.
Mountagu, if he hold still, it will bee expected, that
in the next edition of his booke he change the title
now prefixed [Appello Caesarem] into Appello Papam.
                     
The markes of the Beast were come out in the Pope
before Anselmes time, and since they are so apparent
in him, that other learned Diuines make the Pope
whole Antichrist, and the Appealer himselfe makes
him halfe the Antichrist, pag. 149. and an entire Apostata
from Christ and his kingdome: And was
there no fitter Bishop in all Christendome to decide
controuersies concerning the whole Church of
Christ, then he who is either halfe or whole Antichrist?
but of this point see more in the Writ of error.

they, who out of a loue to the Church, (as

to put forth this booke, which was
stayed vpon just cause, and had certainly
miscarried, and neuer seene the Sunne, had
not present helpe beene got by a strong manmid

more sollicitous of the Temporall estate of the
Church, impeached by Puritanisme, then of
the Spirituall, in danger of being vtterly ouerthrowne
by Popery? Or (because they
would haue Popery and Puritanisme more
eauen ballanced, then they are) that their
accesse to either might be of more moment?
or is it, because (as the Appealer hath taught
vs) that there are certaine in this Kingdome
[tantū nō in Episcopatu Puritani,] there are also

some of the Clergie, that are tantum non in vxoratu
Papistae: or, as Aristotle said of Theodorus,

who mightily bending himselfe against the
heresie of Priscillianists [Heretiques of a strict
and seeming-holy life,] the hatred of which
euill was all the vertue he had, became so
wise in the end, that euery man carefull of
vertuous conuersation, studious of Scripture,
and giuen to any abstinence in diet, was
set downe in his Kalender for a suspected
Puritan, I should say, Priscillianist: for whom
the onely way to proue the soundnesse of
faith to this man, was, by a more licentious
and loose kind of behauiour. But I am too
shallow to enter into the depth of these
mens proiects: Sure I am, that if a Puritan
Gnat be caught by them in the Presse, they
will straine it euen vnto death; but for many
a Popish Cammel, they swallow downe
readily, neuer sticking so much as at the
bunch in the backe: which taxe of titheing
Mint and Commin, lest I my selfe might bee

liable vnto, [in noting the smaller and subtiller
errours in the Appealers Booke, and
passing by the greater,] I thought fit to point
at now in the second place some fouller and
grosser errours in the Appeale; yet but point
at; because I am certainly informed that
many sharper sickles then mine, are in this
haruest. Arminianisme comes vp but thinne,
and in many passages scarce discernable;
but Popery is euerywhere thicke and rancke.
Doubtless in many the particulars, set down
in the former Tablet, besides diuers others,
ne Athenae quidem ipsae sunt magis Atticae, Rome
her selfe is not more Romish, then the Appealer.
What should I marke out with a
coale diuers errours in his booke of a blacker
hiew, and deeper taint? whereof I cleare
his conscience, but cannot his pen. In his,
as in the pen of Demosthenes, there is a virulent
poyson; but, I hope, he hath not sucked
it out, as Demosthenes did.

where but disposingly, and in his prouidence,

confined to certaine places; if confined,
then not infinite; and what did, or
could, Vorstius dogmatize more impiously?

if hee bee an Angel in substance, and that a
true one; he must be so either according to
his Diuine nature, or humane: if hee say, according
to his humane, he dasheth vpon Marcions,
or Apollinaris his heresie, and denyeth,
by consequence, the verity of his humane
nature: if he make him an Angell, and that a
true one in substance according to his diuine
nature, he maketh shipwracke of his faith
against Arrius his rock, and by consequence,
euerteth his diuine nature. For euery Angelicall
substance is finite, the deity infinite.
            I haue purposely taken all the Gall out of
my inke, because I would not dentem dente
mordere, exasperate his exasperating style: yet,
I cannot but say, that the Appealer, in describing
the markes of the Beast, acts the Beasts
part. For, Appeale page 154. hee maketh
Circumcision [a sacrament sometime instituted
by God] a marke of the Beast; and [to
make all correspondent] he placeth, or must
place the foreskin to be cut off in the forehead,
or the hand: for there was the marke of the
Beast receiued, Apoc. 14. 9.
            If the Appealer did bethinke himselfe,
how open he lyeth to the lash, I perswade

my selfe he would plucke away many cords
from the cruell whip of his pen. He scourgeth
from the first page to the last, throughout
his booke, the novellizing puritans; and
in that ranke, [take it as they will] not only
our accomplished Doctors, but our reuerend Prelates:
Tantum non in Episcopatu Puritani, are
disciplined by him, Appeale page 111. A
man would thinke, that, as it was said of
Luther, that couetousnesse was not incident
to his nature, [he had such a peculiar antipathy
to that vice:] So the Appealer (whatsoeuer
other imputation he might bee lyable
vnto) could not be charged, no not by malice
it selfe, with Puritanisme. Citiùs crimen
honestum, quàm turpem Catonem feceris; There
is such an antipathy in his nature to that humour.
Yet see a pang and flash of Amsterdamian
zeale, Answer to Gagg page 92. The
Corinthian was restored without a Bishops seale;
a Commissaries direction to the Parson. He payed
no rate, no fees for restitution, or standing rectus
in Curiâ. Is not this a spoone-feather of the
Martinists brood, a bitter scoffe at the practice
of our Ecclesiasticall Courts? Howsoeuer, if the
Appealer had onely trod a little awry, either

in the high path of popery, or by-path of puritanisme;
I, for mine owne part, would haue
borne with it; and that in respect of his otherwise
commendable parts, and profitable
paines in the Church: but when he halteth
downe right betweene two religions, none,
that desireth 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                to walke with a right
foot, can endure him.
            
               And doth he not limpe? nay doth he not
halt downe-right? doth he not weare a Linsie-woolsy
garment, Answer to Gagg page.
13. and 14? Truth is of two sorts amongst men,
manifest, and confessed truth; or more obscure, and
involved truth. In his quae apertè posita sunt in
Scripturis, inveniuntur illa omnia, quae continent
fidem morés que vivendi, spem scilicet &amp; charitatem.
Plainly deliuered in Scripture are all those
points, which belong vnto Faith, and Manners,
Hope and Charity, to wit. And accordingly I doe
know no obscurity vpon these: I know none of these
controuerted inter partes: The Articles of our
Creed are confessed on both sides, and held plaine
enough. The controuerted points are of a larger,
and inferiour alloy: of them a man may bee ignorant,
without any danger of his soule at all. A man
may resolue, or oppose this way, or that way, without

perill of perishing for euer. &amp;c.] It is most
euident in this place, that the parties, he speaketh
of, are the Papists and we: for there are
no other haue any triall in this Chapter or
matter of debate. By [partes] in many other
places of his booke he vnderstandeth Papists
and Protestants: and here he cannot meane
any other, but the Gagger and his complices
on the one side; and the Protestant Church
on the other side, as the antecedents and consequents
doe manifest.
            
            Now if the differences betweene the papists
and vs, are of such an inferiour alloye, that
little reckoning is to be made of them, because
they adde nothing to, or take nothing
from the summe of sauing knowledge; how
much haue all the reformed Churches in
Christendome to answer at the dreadful Tribunall
of Christ, for making so great a rent in
Christs seamlesse coat, vpon so small occasion?
If the controuerted points be like herbe Iohn
in the pot, that may be in, or out, without perill
at all; why haue all our Prophets, (sithence
Luther at least) cryed, Mors in ollâ, mors in ollâ,
Death in the pot: O blessed Martyrs, who sithence
the beginning of Reformation haue

watred the seed of the Gospell with your
blood, put off your long white robes, and
garlands, and put on sackcloth, and ashes;
for you dyed vpon no good ground, you
shed not your blood in zeale, but spilt it in
folly: Martyrs you may be of schisme, or obstinacy,
or indiscretion, but not of faith; if those
points, you suffered for, belonged not at all
to faith.
               Plin. paneg. 
               Diffido oculis meis, &amp; identidem interrogo,
an legerim, an viderim: I suspect mine
eyes, I question my Copy, I demand of my
selfe againe and againe; Is it possible a Diuine
of no inferiour alloy, should vtter such an
incredible paradoxe? wee dissent from the
Church of Rome about Christ and his offices,
the foundation of faith; the Scriptures,
the rule of faith; the Church, the subiect of
faith; the Sacraments, the seales of faith; iustification,
the proper effect of faith; and good
workes, the fruit of faith: nay wee contest
about the very nature, and essence of faith.
And are none of these matters of faith? doe
none of these belong to faith, or manners?
If our debates are, de tribus capellis, about the
fringe, not the Spouse coat; about the barke,
and not the body of Religion; then hath not

the Church of Rome erred in matter of faith;
and if she hath not, then the Church of England
hath erred, in charging her with error,
not onely in matter of ceremony, and discipline,
but also in matter of faith, Art. 19. If the Church
of England hath erred in this Article, the
Appealers false oathes must needs be answerable
to his degrees and preferments, for so
oft hath he sworne to that Article among
the rest. But he yeeldeth vs a reason, [The
Articles of our Creed are confessed on both sides,
and held plaine enough.] on both sides? hee
might say, on all sides, and hands: For the
Arrians in Polonia, the Antitimitarians in
Transiluania, the Nestorians in Greece, the
Anabaptists and Socinians in the Netherlands,
doe all rehearse the Articles of the Creed, and
hold them plaine enough. Let him peruse
al the bedrol of heretikes, condemned by the
Church of God in all ages, drawne by Irenaeus,
Epiphanius, S. Augustine, Philastrius, Alfonsus
a Castro, and others, and he shall hardly
pitch vpon any sort of Heretickes, that directly
either denyed, or articled against the
Articles of the Apostles Creed. And will he say
none of these erred in matter of faith? but all

were and are in (regiâ viâ) the high way to
heauen? If hee answer, that the heretickes,
though they professed the Articles of the Apostles
Creed, totidem verbis, in the very words;
yet they denyed, or depraued the sense, and
brought in damnable errours, by consequence
ouerthrowing those foundations of
our faith: Our reply is at hand. As the greater
part of ancient heretickes, so at this day
the Papists, confesse the Articles of the Creed,
and hold them plaine truth; but they misinterpret
them, and by consequence shake,
if not quite ouerthrow diuers of them. Either
they, or we, misinterpret those three articles
especially, concerning the Catholike
Church, the Communion of Saints, the forgiuenesse
of sinnes; to which their great Champion,
               
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , reduceth all the controuersies
betweene our Church, and theirs.

Eutiches, Nestorius, and Socinus, the article
concerning Christ the Redeemer; nor Macedonius,
and the Pneumatomachi, the article concerning
the holy Ghost; but they held such
doctrine, which was not comportable with
those articles. And how the Romish doctrine
of Invocation of Saints, and Angels, may
stand with the first article rightly expounded
[I beleeue in God]; and their doctrine of Iustification
by inherent righteousnesse, with the second
[and in Iesus Christ]; and of transubstantiation,
with the article of Christ his Incarnation,
and Ascension; and of a Catholick visible
Romish Church vnder one visible Head, with
that [I beleeue the holy Catholicke Church];
and of vncertainty of saluation, with those [I
beleeue the remission of sins, and life euerlasting];
I desire to bee enformed by the Appealer,
which I could neuer yet bee by any Romanist.
Vpon this most false and deceiueable
ground [that the differences (inter partes)
are not in matters de fide] hee buildeth two
most dangerous assertions [that a man may be
ignorant of them without any perill of his soule at
all: and, A man may resolue or oppose this way or
that way without perill of perishing.] Tum maximè

oppugnaris, si te oppugnari nescis: The greatest
danger of all is, when in place of danger wee
suspect none. A man that enters into a plaguy
house, if he know not of it, is more subiect
to infection through his carelesse boldnesse.
And they, who speake fauourably of the
Romish Church, compare it to a Pest-house, in
which yet through Gods extraordinary
mercy a man may be without mortall infection,
but cannot possibly be without danger.
If there be no danger in Romish Schools
and Temples; if a man may be at Masse, and
incurre no perill of Idolatry, in the adoration of
the Hoste, inuocation of Saints, worshipping of Images,
Reliques, and the like: blot out all the
parts of the largest and learnedst Homily in
all the booke, intituled, Against perill of Idolatrie.
Here I appeale to the Appealers conscience;
Is it no perill at all to the soule of man,
to be ignorant, which are the true inspired
Scriptures? which is the true Church? which
are the Sacraments instituted by Christ? what
is the pure worship of God in spirit, and truth?
what are the prerogatiues of Christ, and priuiledges
of his Saints? what is that faith we are
justified, and saued by? All these, and many

more, are controuerted points; and doe none
of these strengthen, or weaken our title to the
Kingdome of Heauen? I haue no commission
to inlarge the bowels of my Sauiour; and
most vnwilling am I to straiten them, or
close vp his side against such ignorant persons,
who neuer had, nor could haue means
to come to the full light of the Gospell: yet I
am not ignorant,Aug. de gr

is euen of inuincible ignorance in points
of faith; Sed &amp; illa ignorantia, quae non est eorū,
qui scire nolunt, sed eorum, qui tantum simpliciter
scire nesciunt, neminem sic excusat, ut sempiterno
igne non ardeat; si propterea non credidit, quia
non audivit omnino, quod crederet, &amp;c. Not wilfull
ignorance, no not simple nescience can priuiledge
any from euerlasting fire, although he therefore
beleeued not, because he neuer heard, what he
should beleeue. For that of the Psalmist is not without
ground, Powre out thy wrath O God on those
nations, that know thee not: nor that of the Apostle,
when he shall come in flaming fire, to render vengeance
to them, who know not God. But the Appealer
restraineth not his assertion to inuincible
ignorance, be it affected ignorance, nay be it
resolued errour in the controuerted points, it

no way, in his iudgement, indangereth eternall
saluation; either there is no crimen, or at
least discrimen, in treading in either path, for
he saith, [A man may resolue or oppose, this way
or that way, without perill of perishing for euer:
Answer to Gagg pag. 14.] A braue resolution
of a Protestant Diuine, to resolue, that a resolute
Papist, a professed opposite to the doctrine of the
Gospell, may goe away cleare with it, and not
at all stumble at that stone, on which whosoeuer falleth,
he shall be broken; but on whomsoeuer it shall
fall, it will grinde him to powder. Matt. 21. 44.
I desire to be satisfied, whether doth the Appealer
beleeue, that the Articles of Religion
established in our Church by Authority, standing
in direct opposition, as they doe, to the
Trent decisions, are expresly contained in the
Scriptures, or may be euidently deduced from
thence, or not? If not▪ then, according to
the sixt article of the sufficiency of the holy Scriptures
for saluation, they are no articles of faith,
or religion. If they are expresly contained in
holy Scriptures, or may be euidently deduced
from thence, then they are Gods truth, set
downe in his owne word; And is there no
danger in resoluing against God, in opposing

               his word, in siding against that truth? which
shall stand, and abide when heauen and earth
shall passe away. I grant, euery doctrine contained
in Scripture is not absolutely necessary
to saluation; yet in the generall, this is a doctrine
most necessary to saluation, to beleeue,
that all doctrine of Scripture is vndoubtedly
true; and that to deny any part of Scripture,
and much more deliberately to oppugne,
and wilfully to oppose, is dangerous, yea
damnable. And for the controuerted points
in particular, the denying of the truth in
them,

Spira his conscience, on their death-beds,
that in a fearful conflict of despaire, by reason
of the hainousnesse of that sinne, they miserably
gaue vp the ghost. And Minaerius Gallus,
for mainly opposing the doctrine of the
Gospell, was so tormented with a burning in
his bowels, that he had, as it were, a sense
of the very paines of Hell-fire euen in this
life. I tremble to rehearse what Aubignius reporteth
in his history, concerning a late great
King beyond the Sea, who, after he had embraced
the Romish faith, and renounced the
pure doctrine of the Gospell, was exceedingly

perlexed in mind, and troubled in conscience;
and aduised with his bosome friend
(adiuring him to deale faithfully with him)
whether, or no, in that his action of deserting
the faith of the reformed Church, he had
not committed the impardonable sinne against
the holy Ghost.
            
            
               To illustrate this point, (concerning the
necessity of departing out of Babylon, and
perill of remaining in her,) let vs borrow a
ray,
               Iuel. Apol. part. 6. c. 6. diuis. 1. 
               or beame of a true Iewel: Wee haue done
nothing in altering Religion vpon either rashnesse
or arrogancy; nay nothing, but with good leisure,
and mature deliberation; neither had we euer intended
so to doe, except both the manifest, and assured
will of God reuealed to vs in holy Scripture,
and regard of our own saluation, had euen constrained
vs thereunto. This indeed is the lustre of a
true Iewel:Answer to Gag. pag. 50 
               but the false Diamond glareth on
this wise: The present Church of Rome hath alwayes
continued firme in the same foundation of
doctrine, and sacraments instituted by God, and
acknowledgeth, and imbraceth communion with
the ancient, and vndoubted Church of Christ;
wherefore she cannot be other, or diuerse from it,
for she remaines still Christs Church and Spouse.

               As in Ceiland, they say, A Snake lurketh vnder
euery leafe; so wee may truly say of this
passage of the Appealer, there is poysonous error,
and Satanicall doctrine in euerie line.
            
            
               First,
               1 Errour. 
               it is an errour of dangerous consequence,
to affirme, that the present Church of
Rome holdeth the same foundation with the ancient
and primitiue Church. For, the present Church
of Rome holdeth the twelue new Articles,
added to the Apostles Creed; mentioned in Pope
Pius his Bull,Adiect. ad Calcem concil. Trident. 
               as fundamentall points, and necessary
to saluation. The oath prescribed by
the Pope runnes thus: Caetera item omnia à sacris
Canonibus, &amp; Oecumenicis Conciliis, ac praecipuè
à sacrosanctâ Tridentinâ Synodo tradita,
definita, &amp; declarata, indubitanter recipio; at

profiteor, simúlque contraria omnia, at
                  
                     
                  
                  que
                haereses
quascunque ab Ecclesiâ damnatas, &amp; rejectas, &amp;
anathematizatas, ego pariter damno, rejicio, &amp;
anathematizo. Hanc veram Catholicam fidem
(extra quam nemo salvus esse potest) quam in praesenti
sponte profiteor, &amp; veraciter teneo, eandem
integram &amp; inviolatam us
                  
                     
                  
                  que
                ad extremum vitae
spiritum constantissimè (Deo juvante) retineri,
&amp; confiteri, at
                  
                     
                  
                  que
                à meis subditis, vel illis, quorum
cura ad me in munere meo spectabit, retineri, doceri,

&amp; praedicari, quantum in me erit curabo.
            
               Whence I thus argue: First, In this forme
of oath the twelue new Articles, together with the
rest of the definitions of the Councell of Trent, are
made part of the Catholicke faith, (which except a
man beleeue faithfully, he cannot be saued:) but
neither these twelue new articles, nor any of them,
were held as true by the ancient Church, much lesse
as points fundamentall, and de fide; therefore the
present Church of Rome holdeth not the same intire
foundation of faith with the ancient.
            
               Secondly, the ancient Church of Rome held
the Scriptures to be the onely perfect infallible rule
of faith, and foundation of sauing doctrine, (as is
plentifully proued by Iuel,Iuel. def. Apol. p. 195 c. 9. diu. 1. Rainolds cont Hart. c. 8. sect. 1. &amp; thes. 1. sect. 3. &amp; Apol. thes. sect 2 p. 29. Bilson of suprem p

Kemnisius, Morney, D. Francis White, and diuers
others,) but the present Church of Rome
holdeth otherwise, [making vnwritten traditions
part of the foundation of faith, which, they say, is
built partly vpon the written, and partly vpon
the vnwritten word of God;] Therefore the present
Church of Rome holdeth not the same entire
foundation of faith, with the ancient.
            
               Thirdly, the articles of the Apostles Creed,
rightly expounded, and taken in the sense and meaning
of the Holy Ghost, were the foundation of the

ancient Churches faith; But the present Church of
Rome holdeth not the articles of the Apostles Creed
rightly expounded, and taken in the sense and meaning
of the Holy Ghost; therefore the present
Church of Rome holdeth not the same foundation
with the ancient Church.
            The proposition, or major, is not denied:
the assumption may bee euidently proued,
by instancing in some of the prime Articles.
            The first article [I beleeue in God] rightly
expounded, teacheth vs that we ought to repose
our confidence in God, and him onely;
not vpon any Creature, Saint, or Angell; and
therefore not to call vpon them; the consequence
is the Apostles, Rom. 10. How shall
they call on him, in whom they haue not beleeued?
this Article thus expounded, the present
Church of Rome beleeueth not.
            Secondly, Faith in Iesus Christ, rightly vnderstood,
signifieth affiance in Christ for saluation,
or a relying vpon Christ, with an assured
perswasion for remission of sinnes, through his merits,
and satisfaction. This interpretation of
faith in Christ, the present Church of Rome is
so farre from admitting,Conc. Trid. Sess 6. can. 12. that it accurseth all
those, who teach, the nature of justifying

faith to consist in this affiance, or confidence.
            
            Thirdly, the Incarnation of Christ, rightly
expounded, implyeth, that Christ was once,
and but once made of a pure Virgin, a true and
perfect man like vnto vs in all things, sinne onely
excepted, Heb. 2. 17. &amp; 4. 15. And the Councell
of Calcedon, in the fift Act against Eutiches,
accurseth all those, who deny, that Christ
retaineth still the properties of his humane nature,
(such as the shape of man, proportion,
dimension, circumscription, &amp;c.) This article
thus expounded, is not assented to by
the Church of Rome; for the Romanists teach,
that Christ is made in the Sacrament by the Priest.
The learneder Iesuits are not content with
the adducing, or bringing of Christ into the Sacrament,
               Bellar. retract.where he was not before; [for that,
say they, were onely a translocation, not a transubstantiation;
a locall motion, not a substantiall
mutation,] but in expresse words maintaine
a new production of Christs body made of bread.
            
            
               Againe they teach, that Christs body in the
Sacrament, is whole in the whole, and wholy in euery
part of the Host; which is impossible, if,
according to the definition of the Councell of
Calcedon, he retaine the properties of his humane

nature; to wit, extension of parts, proportion
of limmes, distinction of members,
&amp;c. Whence I argue, They, who teach that
Christ hath a body inuisible, indiuisible, insensible,
impassible, ouerthrow the verity of his humane
nature, and consequently deny the article of his
Incarnation: But the Church of Rome teacheth
that Christ (in the Sacrament, to wit,) hath a
body inuisible, indiuisible, insensible, &amp;c. Therefore
the Church of Rome ouerthroweth the verity
of Christ his humane nature, and consequently, denieth
the article of his Incarnation. Fourthly, the
article of Christ his Ascension rightly vnderstood,
importeth that Christ is so ascended
from the earth, that hee is not now vpon
earth, but is contained, (according to his bodily
presence, and humane nature) in the heauens,
Act. 3. 21. This article is not thus held
by the Church of Rome; for the Romanists
teach, that Christ euen according to his humane
nature, and bodily presence, is vpon earth in euery
Church, on euery Altar where the sacrifice of the
Masse is offered, besides priuate houses, to which
the Sacrament is caried: so that by this their
Doctrine, Christ is more vpon earth since
his Ascension, then before. Before his Ascension

               he was onely in one Country, and at one
time, according to his bodily presence, but
in one particular place: but since his Ascension,
Counc. Trent Sess. 13 ch. 1.
               according to their beliefe, he is truely, really,
and substantially in a million of places, viz.
euery where in their offertory, after the words
of Consecration: whence I argue. They who beleeue
and teach, that Christ God &amp; man, according
to his bodily presence, is vpon earth since his Ascension
into heauen, deny that he is contained in heauen,
and consequently ouerthrow the article of his
Ascension: But the Romanists beleeue and teach,
that Christ God and man, according to his bodily
presence, is vpon earth since his Ascension into
heauen; Therefore the Romanists deny that hee is
contained in heauen, and consequently ouerthrow
the article of his Ascension. The first proposition,
or major, is grounded vpon the Angels
Argument, Mat. 28. 6. (He is not here, for he
is risen:) the testimony of S. Peter, Acts 3. 21.
(whom the heauens must containe:) S. Austins
resolution,
               A
                     •
                  g. lib. 20 contra Faustum Manich, c. 11. [Christ, according to his bodily presence,
cannot be, at the same time, in the Sunne,
and Moone, and vpon the Crosse:] the inference
of Vigilius,Lib. 4. contra Euiychetem. (when Christ was in the flesh vpon
earth, he was not in heauen; and now because hee

is in heauen, he is not therefore vpon earth.) If
Christs body could at the same time bee in
more places, the Angels argument were of no
force; for, (his existence in more places then
one at the same time being granted) he might
be risen, and in Ierusalem, and yet at the same
instant be there, where the Angell affirmeth
he was not, to wit, in the graue. If Christ may
be vpon earth in his body, and in heauen at
the same time, then is not he contained in the
Heauens; for it implieth a contradiction, that
his body should be contained in, and yet be
without the Heauens at the same time. If his
body may bee in more places then one at
once, then he might haue been at the instant
of his passion in the Sun, and Moon, &amp; vpon the
Crosse, which S. Augustine concludes to bee
absolutely impossible. And if Christ in his flesh
may be both in heauen and earth at the same
instant, Vigilius his reason hath no strength
at all, to wit, (because he is in heauen, therefore
he is not vpon earth.) To conclude, if it be impossible
that Christ his body should bee at the
same instant in heauen and vpon earth, as the
testimonies of the Angel, S. Peter, S. Augustine,
and Vigilius aboue alleadged, declare; and if

all Papists teach, that Christs body, after words
of Consecration, is truely, really, and substantially
vpon earth handled with the hands, and eaten with
the mouthes of Communicants; they must needes
consequently deny his bodily presence, and being
at the right hand of his Father in Heauen.
Fiftly, the article of the Catholike Church, rightly
expounded, signifieth the whole company of
Gods elect; which is the onely Catholike (inuisible)
Church, wee beleeue, (for the visible
Church is an obiect of sense, and therefore
not properly an article of faith.) This true interpretation
of the article, the Romanists are
so farre from admitting, that in the Councell
of Constance,Cocl. histor. Bohemi. lib. 3. 
               they condemned Iohn Husse of
heresie, for maintaining it. Whence I thus argue:
They who make the visible Church to be the
catholike Church which wee beleeue, misbeleeue
the article touching the Catholike Church; But the
Romanists make the visible Church to be the Catholike
Church, which wee beleeue; Therefore the
Romanists misbeleeue the article touching the catholike
Church.
            The first proposition, or major, is proued
by the words of the Apostle, 2 Cor. 5. 7. We
walke by faith, and not by sight. and Heb. 11. 1.

               Faith is the euidence of things not seene. The
Church therefore, which we beleeue, cannot
be the visible Church.
               Campian reason. 3. The assumption is the
assertion of all Papists, who are so farre from
beleeuing, that they scoffe and laugh at an
inuisible Church, as a meere phantasme, or Platonicall
Idaea.
            
            Sixtly, the foure last articles of the Apostles
creed [the communion of Saints, the forgiuenesse
of sins, the resurrection of the dead, and life euerlasting]
rightly expounded, import not only,
that there is a communion of Saints, and remission
of sinnes in the Church, and a resurrection of
the faithfull to eternall life; [which the Deuills
themselues doe, and cannot but beleeue] but
that euery true beleeuer, who rehearseth these
articles, doth, and ought to beleeue, that hee
hath a part in the communion of Saints, hath obtained
remission of his sinnes, and shall at the
last day rise to life eternall.
               
                  
                     〈…〉
                  
                This interpretation
of these articles is condemned by the Papists
as hereticall. Whence we thus argue against
them:
            They, who deny that a man is bound to beleeue,
that he is of the number of the elect,
or that his sinnes are vndoubtedly forgiuen

him, &amp;c. ouerthrow the foure articles aboue
mentioned, according to their true
meaning.
            But the Romanists deny, that a man is bound
to beleeue, that he is of the number of the
Elect, or that his sinnes are vndoubtedly
forgiuen him, &amp;c.
            Therefore the Romanists ouerthrow the
foure articles aboue mentioned, according to
their true meaning.
            Secondly,2 Errour. it is a dangerous errour, to affirme,
that the present Church of Rome holdeth
the same foundation of Sacraments
with the Ancient Church. Which I proue,
first:
            They who maintain seuen Sacraments properly
so called, hold not the same foundation
of Sacraments, with that church which held
but two onely:
            But the present church of Rome maintaines
seauen Sacraments properly so called, the
Ancient church of Rome held but two onely:
Therefore the present church of Rome holdeth
not the same foundation of Sacraments,
with that church.
            The first proposition, or major, if it bee

not euident in it selfe, may be thus confirmed.
The fiue Sacraments which the Romanists
adde, cannot be built vpon that foundation,
which beareth but two onely: therefore
those fiue Sacraments are built vpon another
different foundation, or vpon no foundation
at all. The second proposition or assumption
is generally proued by all Protestant writers
that handle this question, with whom the
Appealer professeth euery where to hold
faire quarter.
            Secondly, I proue it thus;
            Whosoeuer maintaineth an error ouerthrowing
the nature of a Sacrament, holdeth not
the same foundation of Sacraments with the
Ancient church:
            But the present church of Rome maintaineth
an error ouerthrowing the nature of a Sacrament;
            Therfore the present church of Rome holdeth
not the same foundation of Sacraments with
the Ancient church.
            The first proposition is euident in it selfe;
for nothing can be more fundamentall to a
Sacrament, then that which concernes the
nature and essence of a Sacrament; nothing

more destructiue, or euersiue then that,
which ouerthroweth the very essence, and
substance of it.
            
               The second proposition, is contained totidem
verbis, in expresse words in the articles
of religion of the Church of England, Artic.
28. Transubstantiation, or the change of the substance
of bread and wine, [a doctrine de fide in
the Church of Rome, defined both by the
Councell of Lateran, and the Councell of
Trent] in the supper of the Lord, cannot be proued
by holy Writ, but it is repugnant to the plain words
of Scripture, ouerthroweth the nature of a Sacrament,
and hath giuen occasion to many superstitions.
            Thirdly, it is proued thus:
            Whosoeuer holdeth an errour concerning
Christs ordinance, and institution of the Sacraments,
erreth in the foundation of Sacraments,
and therein differeth from the ancient
Church:
            But the present Church of Rome holdeth an
errour concerning Christs ordinance and institution
of the Sacraments;
            Therefore the present Church of Rome erreth
in the foundation of Sacraments, and
therein differeth from the ancient Church.
            
               
The first proposition is cleare; for Christs
order and institution is the foundation of the
Sacraments, and therefore an error concerning
it must needs be fundamentall in point
of Sacrament. The second proposition or
assumption, is set downe in Article 30. Both
parts of the Sacrament by Christs ordinance and
commandement ought to be ministred to all christian
men alike; which assertion touching
Christs ordinance, the present Church of
Rome erroneously denieth, and defineth the
contrary in the Councell of Constance and
Trent.
            
            
               Thirdly,
               3 Errour. 
               it is a dangerous errour, to affirme,
that the present church of Rome is not diuerse
from the ancient vndoubted church of
Christ. Which I proue. First thus,
            
            Whatsoeuer Church hath most shamefully
gone from the Apostles, from Christ himselfe,
from the Primitiue and catholike church of
God, and hath vtterly forsaken the Catholike
faith, is vndoubtedly diuerse from the
ancient true church of Christ;
            The present church of Rome hath most
shamefully gone from the Apostles, from
Christ himselfe, from the primitiue and

catholike church of God, and hath vtterly forsaken
the catholike faith.
            Therefore the present church of Rome is
vndoubtedly diuerse from the ancient true
church of Christ.
            The first proposition is most euident: the second
proposition is verbatim in the Apology
of the Church of England, part 5. ch. 16. Diu.
1. and part 6. ch. 22. Diuis. 2. This Apology
of the Church of England, as it beareth the
name, so it hath euer beene accounted the
Doctrine of the Church of England. When
it was first printed in the daies of Queene
Elizabeth, it was commanded to bee had in
all Churches; and since was reprinted with
the like command to be had in euery Parish
Church in this Kingdome, in the yeare of
our Lord, 1611. by our late Soueraigne King
Iames, whoSee the Preface to the King, pend by Bishop Ouerall, in the end. gaue a most singular testimony and
approbation of Bishop Iewels workes, for the
most rare and admirable that haue beene written
in this last age of the world: and also gaue speciall
direction to the late Archbishop of
Canterbury, Bishop Bancroft, to appoint
some oneThe life was penned by D. F. then a Student in C. C. C.
                to write his, the said Bishops
life in English, and prefixe it to his workes,

which accordingly is done in the last edition.
            Secondly, I proue it, thus;
            Whatsoeuer Church is fallen away from
Christ his Kingdome and Doctrine, is not
the same with, but diuerse from the ancient
vndoubted church of Christ.
            The present church of Rome is fallen away
from Christ his Kingdome and Doctrine;
            Therefore the present church of Rome is not
the same with, but diuerse from the ancient
vndoubted church of Christ.
            
               The first proposition cannot bee denied;
the assumption is the Appealers, Appeale pag.
149. In Apostasie the Turke and Pope are both
interessed; both are departed away; whether wee
take that apostacie to bee a departing away from
Christ, and his Kingdome, and his Doctrine: or
whether wee vnderstand apostacie and defection
from the Romane Empire, &amp;c. page 150.
            Thirdly, I proue it thus;
            No Church maintaining &amp; practising Idolatry,
can be the same with the ancient Church
that worshipped God in spirit and truth:
            The present Church of Rome maintaineth
and practiseth idolatry:
            Therefore the present Church of Rome cannot

be the same with the ancient Church that
worshipped God in spirit and truth.
            The first proposition is the Apostles,
2 Cor. 6. 16. what agreement hath the Temple
of God with Idols? The assumption is proued
at large in the Homily against the perill of
Idolatry, confirmed to bee the Doctrine of
the Church of England, Artic. 35. The Homilies,
and by name the Homily (the second against
perill of idolatry) containeth godly and wholesome
doctrine. If godly and wholesome Doctrine,
then certainely true.
            
               Fourthly,
               4 Errour. 
               it is a dangerous error to affirme,
as the Appealer doth, Answer to Gagge page
50. That the present Church of Rome remaineth
Christi Ecclesia et Sponsa. Christs Church and
Spouse. That God hath his Church euen in
Rome we doe not deny; but that the present
Romane Church, specially since the
Councell of Trent, holding the cursing and
accursed Canons of that Conuenticle, or
that the Papacy, that is, the Pope with his
Clergy and their adherents, are Christs
Church and Spouse, the Appealer is the first
Protestant that euer for ought I know, affirmed
it. Iunius (whom he alleadgeth, Appeale,

               pag. 113. to this purpose) in his booke De
Ecclesiâ, is so farre from supporting his assertion,
that in the same booke hee quite ouerthroweth
it: his words are, pag. 60. &amp; 61.
Ecclesiamultis seculis fuit, cùm Papatus non esset;
accessit ei Papatus contingenter, &amp; sic ab ea separabilis,
ut hoc etiam tempore Ecclesiae sint ubi
Papatus non est, &amp; sine Papatu deinceps futurae
sint. Papatus igitur non est Ecclesia, sed in Ecclesiâ
est adnatum malu
                  •
               , pestis, hydrops, gangraena
in corpore, vitae atque saluti ejus insidians, ideo
                  
                     
                  
                  que
               
succum vitalem salutarémque Ecclesiae depascens
quàm infestissimè. The Church of God was many
ages when there was no Papacy at all; as at this
day also there are Churches where there is no Papacy:
and will be hereafter without the Papacy.
The Papacy therefore is not the Church, but a disease
or botch growne to or in the Church, a plague,
a dropsy, a gangreene in the body, indangering the
health, feeding vpon, and infesting the healthfull
moisture and vitall blood of the Church. And
within a few lines after in the same page follow
the words on which the Appealer
wholly relyeth, Appeale page 113. The Papall
Church, (saith Franciscus Iunius▪ 
               neither
Papist, nor Arminian) quâ id habet in se quod

ad Ecclesiae definitionem pertinet, est Ecclesia. As
it hath that in it which belongs to the definition of
a Church, is a Church. Why doth the Appealer
stop in the middle of a sentence? why
doth he not goe on to the full period? the
sentence is yet but lame, he hath put out but
the left legge, I will put out the right legge
for him, wherewith Iunius giues Popery a
kicke, and trips vp the Appealers heeles: Qud
vero habet in se adnatum malum, quod Papalitatem
dicimus, eo respectu Ecclesia non est, sed vitiata
atque corrupta Ecclesia &amp; ad interitum tendens;
But the Church of Rome as it hath a disease or euill
growne to it, which we call the Papacy, in that
respect it is not the Church, but a vitiate and corrupt
church, and tending to ruine.
            Note here Reader, in the Appealers defence
of Popery a tricke of Popery, to cite
sentences by halfes, alleadging onely that
which in shew makes for them, and concealing
that which in truth makes against them.
The meaning of the whole sentence of Iunius
is cleare enough for vs, and against the Appealer:
to wit, that the Church of Rome
so farre as it is Protestant, and holdeth some
fundamentall truths agreeable to the Scriptures,

is a Church: but as it is Popish, and
addeth many errors to those truths, consequently
subuerting those very truths it holdeth,
it is no Church. Which I thus proue:
            No Spouse or true church of Christ is in
part or in whole that Antichrist, or whore of
Babylon:
            The present church of Rome, as it is taken
for the Papacy or Popish state thereof, is in
part (as the Appealer confesseth, Appeale
pag. 149.) or in whole, (as manySee before in the Table, Artic. de Antichristo.
                Pillars
of our Church haue taught,) that Antichrist,
or whore of Babylon;
            Therefore the present church of Rome, as it
is taken for the Papacy or popish state thereof,
is no Spouse nor true church of christ.
            I haue heard that the Appealer in a late
conference (wherein this passage, on which
I haue so long insisted, was obiected against
him) should stand at this ward, answering
for himselfe, that these words [praesens Ecclesia
Romana eodem fundamento doctrinae &amp; Sacramentorum
firma semper constitit, &amp;c. &amp; manet
enim Christi Ecclesia &amp; Sponsa: Answ. to Gag.
page 50.] were not his owne words, but
the words of Cassander. This his ward will

not keepe off the blow. For first, he alleadgeth
this sentence in approbation thereof,
and commendation of the Author: [moderate
men, saith he, ibid. on both sides, confesse
this controuersy may cease:] [hee should haue
said, luke-warme men on both sides.] Secondly,
he resteth on this passage as being a full answer
to the Popish obiection concerning the
visibility of the Church. Thirdly, in other places
of his booke, Appeale page 113. and 139.
and 140. he affirmeth in his owne words, as
much in effect, as he here coteth, linguâ Romanâ
out of Cassander, but fide Graecâ. His
words are, page 113. I am absolutely perswaded,
and shall be, till I see cause to the contrary, that
the church of Rome is a true, though not a sound
church of Christ, as well since as before the Councell
of Trent; a part of the catholike, though not the
catholike church, which wee doe professe to beleeue
in our Creed: In essentialls and fundamentalls
they agree, holding one faith in one Lord. And
p. 139 Rome is and euer was a true church, since
it was a church. And page 140. the church of
Rome is a true church, ratione essentiae, and being
of a church, not a sound church euery way in
their Doctrine. Vt Marci Antonij de Dominis discipulum

possis agnoscere: I know well the
mint where these new tenents were coined:
the Appealer shewes himselfe a tractable and
respectiue Prebend to his late Deane, following
him pene ad aras, neere to the Romish
Altars. That his Deane, after his relapse into
Popery, in the last booke, containing his poenitendam
poenitentiam, et retractandam retractationem,
his repentance to be repented of, and
retractation to bee retracted, renouncing the
true religion which he had defended, laboureth
to cleare the present church of Rome from the
imputation of heresie, because, as he saith, the wiser
and learneder Ministers of the church of England
teach, that the church of Rome doth not erre
in any fundamentall articles of faith. In defectu
credendi haeresis est, non in excessu; haereticus
est censendus qui in fide deficit, aliquid
quod scriptum est non credendo; non is qui
in fide superabundat, plus quam scriptum
est credendo: Heresie consists in the defect, not
in the excesse of beleeuing; and he is an Heretike,
who is deficient in his faith, by not beleeuing something
that is written; not he that superabounds in
his faith by beleeuing more then is written. This
errour (as I am informed) spreads farre like

a Gangreane, therefore most needfull it is it
be lookt to in time. It is true that the Church
of Rome holdeth, if not all, yet most of the
fundamentall and positiue articles with vs. It is
true also, that most of their errours are by
way of addition: Yet whosoeuer from hence
will conclude, that the Church of Rome is
not hereticall, or erreth not in any point necessary
to saluation, grossely mistaketh the
matter, as will appeare to any, whose iudgement
is not forestalled, by the demonstration
of these two conclusions.
            1 That Heresy or damnable Errour may be
as well by adding to, as taking from the
Orthodoxe faith.
            2 That the Church of Rome erreth not
onely in excesse, or beleeuing more
then is needfull, but also in defect and
beleeuing lesse.
            The first is thus demonstrated;
            Whatsoeuer errours are alike forbidden in
Scripture vnder the same punishment, are
alike damnable:
            Errors by adding to, and detracting from
the Orthodoxe faith, are alike forbidden in
Scripture vnder the same punishment;
            
               
Therefore errours by adding to and detracting
from the Orthodoxe faith, are alike
damnable.
            
               The first proposition is cleare by it owne
light. The assumption or second proposition
is deliuered expresly in holy Scripture.
Deut. 42. Ye shall not adde vnto the words which
I command you, neither shall you diminish ought
from it. Proverb. 30. 5. 6. Euery word of God is
pure, adde thou not vnto his words, lest he reproue
thee. Galat. 1. 18. If we or an Angell from heauen
preach vnto you beside that which wee haue
preached vnto you, let him be accursed. Reuel.
22. 18. For I testifie vnto euery man that heareth
the words of the Prophesie of this Booke, If any
man shall adde vnto these things, God shall adde
vnto him the plagues that are written in this book.
And if any man shall take away from the words of
the booke of this Prophesie, God shall take away his
part out of the Booke of Life, and out of the holy
City, and from the things that are written in this
Booke.
            Secondly thus,
            Whatsoeuer things alike destroy the nature
of faith, are alike damnable:
            Errours by addition and detraction, alike

destroy the nature of Faith;
            Therefore errors by addition and detraction
are alike damnable.
            The first proposition is vnquestionable.
The assumption I declare thus: Faith is of
the nature of a rule or certaine measure, to
which if any thing be added, or taken away,
it ceaseth to be that rule. Cùm credimus, saith
Tertullian,
               Tertul. de Praescript. advers. Haeret. c. 8. c. 4. 
               nihil desideramus ultra credere, prius
enim hoc credimus, non esse quod ultra credere, debeamus:
Fides in regulâ posita est; nihil ultra scire
est omnia scire. When we beleeue, we desire
to beleeue no more; for wee first beleeue
this, that there is nothing more we ought to
beleeue. Faith is contained in a rule: to know
nothing beyond it, is to know all things.
Virtue is in the meane, vice as well in the excesse,
as in the defect. In our body the superabundance
of humours is as dangerous
as lacke of them; as many dye of Plethories,
as of Consumptions. A hand or foot, which
hath more fingers, or toes then ordinary, is alike
monstrous, as that which wanteth the
due number. To vse their owne similitude;
A foundation may be as well ouethrowne
by laying on it more then it will beare, as by

taking away that which is necessary to support
the building. Thirdly, thus:
            The errours in faith and religion of the Samaritans,
Malchamites, Athenians, Galatians,
Ebionites, Nazarites, Quartadecimans,
Manichees, and Nestorians, were damnable:
            But all these seuerall errours were errours of
addition;
            Therefore errours of Addition are damnable.
            The first proposition will not bee gainesaied.
For all these errours are branded as hereticall
or damnable, either by the Spirit of God
in Scripture, or by the catholike christian
Church. The Assumption will appeare in the
suruay of those particular errors.
            
               The Samaritans feared the Lord,2 King. 17. 33. and serued
their owne Gods. The Malchamites worshipped
and sware by the Lord,Zepha. 1. 5. and sware by Malcham.
The Athenians worshipped the true God by the
name of THE VNKNOWNE GOD,
               Acts 17. 23. 2.
               and withall worshipped Idols.
               Gal. 4. 9. 
               The Galatians,
Ebionites, Nazarites, and Quartadecimans,
beleeued the Gospell, yet retained also
and obserued the legall ceremonies, But now,
after ye haue knowne God, or rather are knowne

of God, how turne ye againe to the weake and beggerly
elements, whereunto ye desire againe to bee in
bondage? saith Saint Paul of the Galatians,
Ebionitae ceremonias adhuc legis retinent,
pauperes interpretantur, et vere sensu pauperes:
The Ebionites still keepe the ceremonies of the
Law,Haymo hist. Sacr. l. 3. c. 17. ex Euseb. histor. l. 3. c. 27. their name (Ebionites) by interpretation is
poore men, and indeed such are they, poore
and simple in theirvnderstanding,
               August. de haeres. ad quod vult Deum. 
               God wot,
saith Haymo. Nazaraei, dum volunt Iudaei esse,
et Christiani, nec Iudaei sunt, nec Christiani. The
Nazarites, whilest they will bee both Iewes and
Christians, are indeed neither Iewes nor christians;
saith S. Augustine. His scil: Quartadecimanis,
Blastus accedens, Iudaismum vult introducere, Pascha
enim dicit non aliter custodiendum esse, quàm
secundum legem Moysis, quartadecimâ mensis;

The Manichees held two chiefe first causes of
all things,Cassander de reliquijs T

The Nestorians held two persons in Christ,
they denied not one; As the Ephesine Councell.
            
            The second conclusion [That the Church
of Rome erreth not onely in excesse, or beleeuing
more then is needfull, but also in defect,
and beleeuing lesse] is proued: First, they
beleeue not the Articles of the Apostles Creed,
according to the true and full meaning: many
speciall points of faith, contained in the Apostles
Creed, and by necessary consequence,
deduced from thence, are not assented vnto
by the Romanists, as I shewed before.
            
               Secondly, they beleeue not speciall and particular
affiance in Christs merits for saluation,Councell of Trent. can. 12. 13. S
                     •
                  s. 6.
               and consequently they beleeue not a justifying
faith, or justification by such a faith: nay they
condemne such a beleefe as heresy.
            Thirdly, they hold not the formall foundation
of faith: for albeit they beleeue the Scriptures,
and some points of faith deduced out of
them, yet they beleeue them not for themselues,
or the authority of the Scriptures, but because
the Church hath approued and commanded

them to bee thus receiued, and beleeued.
They beleeue not God and the Scriptures
for themselues, but for the Popes sake:
that is, in effect, they beleeue Christ for Antichrist.
Hence it is, that although God expresly
forbids all vice, and commands all
virtue,Bellar. lib. 4. de Rom. Pont. c. 5. Sect. Quod. yet Bellarmine saith, Si Papa erraret praecipiendo
vitia, vel prohibendo virtutes, teneretur
Ecclesia credere vitia esse bona, &amp; virtutes esse
malas, nisi vellit contra conscientiam peccare. If
the Pope should erre by commanding vice,
and forbidding virtue, (which is directly
contrary to the whole scope, and tenor of holy
Scriptures) yet the Church is bound to beleeue
vice to be good, and virtue to be euill;
vnlesse shee will sin against conscience. But
Pope and Cardinall must pardon vs, if, as
we are bound, we beleeue and obey God rather
then mā, who by the Prophet Esay saith,
Woe vnto them that call evill good,
               Isaiah. 5. 20 
               and good evill,
that put darknesse for light, and light for darkness,
that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter.
            
            By this time I see the Appealer totum in fermento,
crying shame on the malice of his aduersaries
that mistake him,Appeale p. 139. 
               [Remember it lest
you mistake my saying, or maliciously mistake it;

the Church of Rome is a true Church ratione essentiae,
and being of a Church, not a sound Church
euery way in their doctrine.] I remember well
this memento; neither can I forget the Appealers
syllogisme set downe in the same
page: viz.
            
            The Church of Rome hath euer beene visible:
            The Church of Rome is and euer was a true
Church, since it was a Church;
            Therefore the true Church hath beene visible.
            The Appealer cannot inferre the conclusion
vpon the premisses, vnlesse in his minor
or assumption he intend to make the Church
of Rome more then a true Church; hee must
make her the true Church, that is, not a particular
Church, but the Catholike, not a member,
but the whole. The minor should bee
thus altered, to make his syllogisme current.
            The Church of Rome hath euer beene visible:
            The Church of Rome is the true Church;
            Therefore the true Church hath euer beene
visible.
            The syllogisme thus being set vpon his

true feet, any man may easily see the lame
leg; The Church of Rome is neither the true
Church, nor, as the Appealer confesseth, p. 140.
a sound member of the true Church. As for the
syllogisme made by the Appealer prout jacet
in terminis, vpon which he would haue his
friends and Informers to chew the cud, as they doe
after Lectures. p. 139. Hee deserueth himselfe
to be sent to the Vniuersity to chew the cud
after a Logique Lecture, and learne to make
a better syllogisme. For this his syllogisme
is peccant tam formâ quàm materiâ, in matter
and forme. To say nothing of mood and
figure, which the Appealer, in the mood he
was, little regarded; I say, (allowing that
there may be a lawfull expositorius syllogismus,
consisting of pure singulars, and consequently
in no mood) first there are foure termes at
least in this syllogisme, to wit, [The Church
of Rome, visible, the true Church, a true Church,]
the true Church, and a true Church, are not one.
Euery particular true Church is a true Church,
yet neither euery particular, nor any particular
Church is the true Catholike visible Church, of
which the question is propounded, and debated
by the Appealer. Againe, the minor

terminus is not in the conclusion; the minor
terminus is, [A true Church since it was a Church]
which if he had put in the conclusion entirely,
as he ought by the rules of good syllogizing,
his argument would haue proued ridiculous: viz.
            
            The Church of Rome hath euer been visible:
            The Church of Rome is and euer was a true
Church since it was a Church;
            Therefore a true church since it was a church
hath beene euer visible.
            Let the forme passe, enough of the huske;
we will now chew the graine, and come to
the matter of his syllogisme. First, were
both the propositions true, yet the argument
is fallacious: for the processe is ab ignotiori ad
notius, the worst kind of the beggarly
fallacy petitio Principii. The visibility of the
catholique Church is more knowne then the visibility
of any one member, be it the Church of
Rome: for the Catholique Church is visible and
knowne in all the parts and members, and
therefore must needs be more knowne then
any one member. Secondly, the major is
false, if it bee vnderstood in the Appealers
sense: for, during many schismes in the Papacie,
               
and when the Pope sate at Auennian, and
not Rome, when diuers Popes were deposed
by Councels for Schisme and Heresy, and
sometimes the Pope set vp by the Councels,
was deposed by the power of Princes, as
Amodius; and sometimes the Popes deposed
by Councels were reëstablished in their
Popedomes by the power of Princes, as Eugenius,
the Church of Rome was not so visible,
as the Appealer would haue it. Thirdly, if
the Appealer vnderstand by the Church of
Rome (as his friends and informers, and all Protestants
generally vnderstand it, and as hee
must, if he say any thing to the purpose.)
a Church in Rome, and the Popes territories,
or elsewhere, holding the present Romane
faith, which is set downe in the Councell of
Trent, both the major and minor are notoriously
false. For neither was there any church
in the world, holding that faith, visible for
many hundred yeeres after Christ; neither
is the Church holding that erroneous faith a
true Church▪ Howsoeuer, it may please God
in that Church (as hee did in the Churches of
the Arrians in Saint Hilary his time) to call
many by the Word &amp; Sacraments to the knowledge
               
of the truth;
               
                  
                     〈…〉
                  
                
               quorum aures puriores erant
quàm doctorum ora: whose eares were purer
then the teachers mouthes; who strained
the milke they receiued from their mother,
and, casting away that which was impure,
dranke downe onely the sincere milke of the
word.
            I suppose the Appealer will not affirm the
Arrian Churches to bee true Churches; yet God
had his wheat euen in their floore all couered
with chaffe; and, I doubt not, but hee euer
had, and still hath many thousands euen in
the Romane Church it selfe, who neuer bowed
the knee to that Baäl. Our question is not of
them, but of their Gouernours and Teachers;
and the outward face of their Church maintaining
and practising idolatry, and inforcing as
farre as they can the accursed Canons of the
Councell of Trent, whether in this sense the
Church of Rome be a true Church. It is saith the
Appealer a true Church,

                  . ratione essentiae, in regard
of essence, but not in regard of soundnesse of
doctrine. This answer explicateth not the
question, but implieth a contradiction; to
say, a true Church in respect of the essence, and
not in respect of soundnesse of Doctrine, is to say,

               the church of Rome is a true church in respect of
the essence, but not in respect of the essence; for,
soundnesse of Doctrine is of the essence of the true
church. By it the true Church is defined, Article
the 19. The visible church of Christ is a congregation
of faithfull men, in the which the pure
word of God is Preached, and the Sacraments bee
duely ministred, according to Christs ordinance, in
all those things that of necessity are requisite to
the same.
            
            If the Appealer by (truth) meaneth metaphysicall
truth, which is of as large extent as
being or entity, the more hee graspeth, the
lesse hee holdeth: for in this account all
Churches are true Churches; and the Church
of Rome is no more indebted to the Appealer
for his Euloge, then all the hereticall and schismaticall
Churches in Christendome; they
are Churches, therefore in this sense, true
Churches; for Ens et verum conuertuntur. In this
acception, a thiefe is a true man, because it is
true that he is a man; and the Deuill a true
Angell, because it is true, that he is an Angell;
and the Appealer a true writer, because it is
true that he is a writer;Melancthon in Chroni

to a Gagger of the Protestants, he intend
