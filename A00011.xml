            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).

               Israel, the Saviour thereof in time
of trouble, why shouldest thou be as a Stranger in the

tarry for a night? Why shouldest thou be as a man

by thy Name, leave us not. Yea,ver. 7. ô Lord, though our iniquities testifie
against us, yet doe thou it for thy Names sake: for our backeslidings are
many, we have sinned against thee. And2 Chron. 19. we know not what to doe▪
but our eyes are towards thee.Esa. 63. 15, 16. O look down from heaven, and behold
from the habitation of thy holines, and of thy glory: where is thy zeale,
and thy strength, the sounding of thy bowels, and of thy mercies towards
me? Are they restrained? Doubtlesse thou art our Father, thou ô Lord
art our Redeemer, thy Name is from everlasting.Esa. 26. 1

other Lords besides thee have had dominion over us: but by thee only
will we make mention of thy Name.
            
               And now, ô Lord, we thy People, inhabitants of this sinfull
Land, out of the depth of our miseries, and from under the
burthen of our manifold afflictions and oppressions, which we worthily
suffer for our iniquities from thy righteous hand

and find grace to helpe in time of need And although we thy People
have had of long time, and still have much matter of complaint
unto thy Righteous Throne: yet now above all other,
when the Throne of Iniquity frameth mischiefe as by a Law. For a
Synod hath been by Authority of late holden, wherein such
things have been concluded and confirmed, as tend to the utter
rooting out of all true Religion, and that under the vaile of
deep hypocrisie, double iniquity. And now ô Lord, give thy People
leave even to spread this whole Synod before thee, as once King

            And forasmuch as the said Synod hath been both called,
authorized, and confirmed in all the Canons and Constitutions
therof by the King, as himselfe declareth by his own Act both
before and after the said Canons; wherein he professeth himselfe
to be thy Deputy (ô King of Kings, and Lord of Lords) we
therfore think it our duty, first to purge our selves of that staine
of disloyalty and disobedience which the King chargeth us withall.
For they lay it to the charge of some of us at the least, that we
suspect our King of being perverted in a Superstitious way of Gods
worship, as if he intended to bring in some alteration of Religion in
our Land, against his sundry publicke Declartions and Sacred professions
before Him, whose Deputy (saith he) we are, against all, and
every intention of any Popish Innovation. Now for our parts, we
doe appeale to thy righteous judgement, O searcher of all hearts,
whether we have been apt causelessely to suspect or surmise the
least evill of our King, but on the contrary, have been ready to
interpret all his actions in such a sense, as perswading our selvs,

whatever things were amisse in Church or Common-weale, or
whatever Innovations brought in, yea although under the name
of Royall Authority, yet the King was ignorant of them, and his
name therin abused by some bad Officers about him. Yea, how
unwilling are we to this very day (notwithstanding the late
Synod so called and confirmed by the King) to conceive the
least sinister thought of him. So as we are apt to thinke that
those Innovations brought in since and under his Raigne, have
either crept in by stealth and by degrees without his knowledge,
or been craftily suggested as being no Innovations at all,
but rather renovations of the decayes of the old Religion (so

                  •
               ulgarly called) being induced thereunto by the ancient use
thereof retained in some places of the Land, since the Reformation,

                  all Chappels, and Cathedralls, though
not confirmed by any Law, as the use of Altars, Images, and the
like. But now when we see with open eyes to our hearts grief,

now being made binding Laws) and so confirmed by the Letter

O Lord, what shall we think? Nay, when we see a strict
Oath injoyned and imposed upon all Ministers, of what style,
or ranke soever, and upon all graduates in the Universities, &amp;c.
to approve, and preserve the Doctrine and Discipline or Government,
as it stands now established in the Church of England: and

the Doctrines of thy Grace and Gospel, with the preaching thereof;
all preaching on thy Dayes in the afternoons, and all true Catechising,
mainly cryed down: and that all thy painfull, and godly
Ministers are persecuted, suspended, deprived, cast out of all, and can
have no remedy either by course of Law (which is stopped)
or by the King himselfe to w

               om they complaine: and that
the Prelates of late more especially usurped a false Title to
their false Government Ecclesiasticall by claiming their Prelaticall
Jurisdiction from thine own divine Authority; So as
we cannot be any longer ignoran
                  •
                (except we will be wilfully
blind) that the Doctrine of the Church of England established in
Queene Elizabeths dayes, hath now suffered not onely an Innovation,
but an utter eversion and extirpation of the very foundations
thereof: And this Innovation, this eversion, being now

finally concluded on in a Synod, confirmed by the King, and
injoyned to be Sworne unto by all those aforesaid: and besides
all this, the King himselfe professing, that he hath diligently
with great contentment and comfort read, and considered of all the said
Canons, Orders, Ordinances, and Constitutions of the late Synod aforesaid,
and that he finds the same such as he is perswaded wilbe very
profitable to the whole Church and Kingdome: And thereupon doth
propound, publish, and straightly injoyne by his Authority and Letters
Patents, the same to be diligently observed, executed, and equally kept of
all his Subjects within this Realme: Now ô Lord, all these things
weighed and layd together, Solemne and Sacred Protestations
against Innovations on the one side, and a mighty flood of Innovations
on the other side, which by Royall Authority have made a
terrible universall invasion and irruption both into thy Spirituall
Kingdome, and this Temporal, threatning speedily to sweep
all away at once: what shall we thinke? Or what shall we say?
Wouldst thou have us still to dreame or imagine, that here are
no Innovations at all brought in either of Doctrine, or Ecclesiasticall
Government, and all because the King hath so frequently, so
solemnly before G
                     •
                  d, and Angels and Men, protested to the
contrary? Or, that the Innovations concluded in this Synod, are
therfore no Innovations, because ratified and confirmed by the
Kings Letters Patents, and by all the strength of Royall Authority,
and because commended by the King to be such, as he is perswaded
wilbe very profitable to the whole Church and Kingdome? Or
may we not rather thinke, or rather most certainly beleeve, that
(for the iniquities of the Land) oppression in the State, persecutions
of thy Ministers, effusion of innocent blood of thy Servants,
open Profanation of thy Sabbaths, and that by publicke dispensation,
yea in a word, a contemptuous trampling of all Laws divine
and humane underfeet; nay yet more
                  •
                (more especially, as
the orginall source and cause of all the rest) a damnable Apostacie
from the Gospel, joyned with a desperate League with
Rome, too palpable to be seen, so as Antichrists Religion is imbraced
instead of thy True word and Gospell: for this, for these
crying sins, is it not lawfull for us to thinke at least, yea to beleeve,
that thou in thy just judgement restrained and withheld
from us the benigne influence of the Kings heart, and hast so
farre (for a time at least, for our humiliation) given him up to be
Seduced by the Prelates and their Romish faction, and to be
guided and led by their Councels, as refusing to hearken to
any true Information of his most loving and loyall Subjects,

(whereof we have had of late lamentable experience) he will
rather hazard all his Kingdomes, then either displease them, or
disobey their Councels? But yet, ô Lord, seeing thy judgements
are unsearchable, and thy wayes past finding out, we will not take
upon us to judge in so deep a matter, onely thou hast sayd, you
shall know them by their fruits.
            
            But Lord, the King saith, He doth these things, by his Prerogative
Royall, and Supreme Authority in Causes Ecclesiasticall. Holy and
Righteous Lord, hast thou given to any mortall Creature, to
any Kings on Earth, any such Prerogative Royall, any such Supreme
Authority over thy Church, as to alter Religion at his
pleasure, or to confirme the alteration of the true Religion for
others pleasure, to make voyd by Edicts or Declarations the
Saving Doctrines of thy word, thy holy Commandements, thine
eternall Law, or to sit in thy Throne, over the Soules and Consciences
of thy People, captivating and oppressing them under the burthens
of humane inventions, and Superstitious Ceremonies▪
                Nay,
hast thou not expreslyCol. 2. 8. to the end of the Chapter. forbidden thy People to subject their
necks under any such yoake, as being a denyall of thee our
King, and of our Redemption by thy precious blood▪
                Such usurpations
therfore of man, we doe, (ô onely Soveraigne of our
soules) even before Angels and men utterly renounce.Esa. 26. 23. 
               O Lord
our God, other Lords besides thee have had dominion over us: but by
thee onely will we make mention of thy Name. And, Lord, be thou
our Judge between us and our oppressors in this thing, and give
thy People holy courage and zeale to use all lawfull meanes for
the upholding of this thy Sole Royall Soveraignty over our poor
Soules and Consciences, against all Antichristian usurpations to
the contrary.
            And last of all, whereas our King saith, that he hath called, and
given free leave to this Synod to treat and agree upon certaine other
Canons necessary for the advancement of Gods Glory, the edifying of
his holy Church, and the due reverence of his blessed Mysteries and Sacraments
(which words are taken out of the Act for Conformity
in Queen Elizabeths Raigne.) If it shall clearly appeare by
this our Complaint following, that the things concluded in
the said Synod, be neither for the advancement of Gods glory.

where the Ecclesiasticall beare the maine Sway, even there,
where they be fewest in number) such their usurped, illegall,
extravagant power, such terrible Precedents filed up in their
Courts, which stand for Laws and ruled Cases, for all that come
after; and the like: as no Subject in the Kingdome can secure
himselfe, that any one thing, or all that he possesseth, are his
owne? For the best and surest Tenure, by which every freeborne
Subject holds the right and propriety of his goods, is the
Law of the Land. But let the Subject be brought into one of

cleare, as against which no Law of the Land doth lye, yet, first
of all in those Courts he cannot have any benefit of the Law

Laws in all such cases for time to come; yea and when
they please, where they want a Precedent for some extraordinary
feat to be done, they can with a wet finger make a new
Law for it. Hereof if we take but a few instances, it will easily
appeare what truth there is in the words of this Canon, which
seem to give to the Subject what ever right and title, and true
property of estate doth or can belong unto them. For, first, we
have late Precedents to shew, that no Freeman of London, after
he hath served his yeares, and set up his Trade, can be sure long
to injoy the Liberty of his Trade, but either he is forbidden
longer to use it, or is forced at length with the rest of his trade
to purchase it as a Monopolie at a deare rate, which they and
all the Kingdome pay for. Witnesse the Sope-businesse. Againe,
no Doctor and practitioner in Physicke is sure to hold his
Profession, whereby he and his should live, when once he comes
into the High Commission. Witnesse Dr. Bastwicks case. Item, no
Minister is sure to hold his free-hold, his Benefice (which is by
Law his freehold) if once he be quarrelled in the High Commission,
yea or in other inferiour Ecclesiasticall Courts. Witnesse manifold
Precedents in the Land. Item, none can be sure that his

the Court, by assenting to the condemnation of his innocent
Cause, before it was heard. Which one Example well weighed,
what Cause so innocent, so just, can look to escape Scot free ?
But thus we see, ö Lord, and thou better seest, what truth these
Canonists have in them, whose words pretend all right to the
Subject, and whose deeds doe practise the bringing of all mens
soules, bodies, and estates under the yoake of an universall Tyranny.
To proceed.
               For the third (the setting up of an independent coactive power

cunningly overthrows the sacred ordinance of Godthis being meant of the State of Religion: if it be Papall, it is altogether unlawfull, as being Antichristian: but being according to thy word, every Christian State is bound to

universall power over all the Churches in the world) yet in a
second, Every Prelate in his Diocese exercising a Papall power,
and so doth cunningly undermine the Royall Office, and overthrew
Gods Sacred Ordinance, who hath given a power and charge to
Kings to suppresse all such Ecclesiasticall Tyranny over the soules
of his people. And whereas they say, the Royall Office, is the
Sacred Ordinance of God: we all acknowledge it; and that this
Ordinance of God comprehends in it not onely the institution of
the Superiority of Kings over their people, but their Speciall office
of Government, as it is limited and establish

that Kings should governe by a Law (as Deut 17. 18, 19, 20.
Pro. 31. 5.) and that they should inviolably keep those Oathes
and Covenants, that they have solemnly made with their people.

and to the King, and to the Realme, and to the peace, and prosperity

                     . For besides all this, that is said, have they not set out
many notorious Popish Books, as that called the Femall Glory,
which makes the blessed Virgin to be a Goddesse to be adored, and
called upon, or prayed unto, the whole Booke being a very packe of
Idolatry throughout, and set out in English, and allowed by one
of the Prime Prelates Chapleins? So also a Booke of one Shelford
Priest, whose 5 Treatises are notorious grosse popery; with many
other of the same branne, or meale, which have been published
by Authority, and never any of them yet called in. And some
that have been called in, as Cozens Orisons, and Salis his Devotions,
and others, yet go currant up and down, and are in every Papists
pocket. Now if these holy men of this Sacred Synod had intended
indeed to suppresse the growth of Popery, they should have
caused heaps of bonefires to be made of the Bookes in Smithfield.
But in all things touching this point, how ridiculously and
palpably they have discovered their hypocrisie, especially the
President and Father of the Synod, doe thou, ô Lord, judge.

they call Ca

                     vinists. Yea and in sundry of their Heresies they
border neare upon them, as maintaining Iustification by works,
and that we are not bound to beleeve that we shall rise againe with
these our bodies glorified, and the like. So as doth not the Synod mistake
the name? Should they not have said, against Arminianisme?
Or perhaps they name the Damnable and Cursed Heresie
of Socinianisme, both because they would make the people beleeve
it is that, which hath so much been cryed downe by
Preachers under the Name of Arminianisme, and yet they will
save Arminianisme harmelesse, to which they have been so much
beholden: and also because Arminianisme doth in many things
Symbolize with Sccinianisme, under which it may the more
easily lye hid. But for Arminianisine sake, the President hath, in
a Declaration in the Kings Name before the 39 Articles made the
Articles touching Grace, Election, Predestination, &amp;c. to speake
aswell in favour of it, as of the truth it selfe. Or would they
prevent the contagion of Socinianisme, as also of Arminianisme?
Call in those Orders, which restraine young students in the
Vniversitie for reading our Protestant Authors.
               
            
            
               The Fifth Canon: Against Sectaries.
               In this Canon they name Seperatists, whom especially they
meane, as indeavouring (as they say) the subversion of the Doctrine
and Discipline of the Church of England: on these they lay load in
good earnest indeed, and on all those, that shall print or publish
Bookes especially against the Discipline and Government of the
Church of England. This is indeed their faire Goddesse Diana, of
which these Craftsmen, who get their great Incomes by her, are
so jealous, and doe so furiously thunder against the opposites.
And surely, ô Lord, if thou dost not at this time helpe, they poore
people, who cannot with a good Conscience (if but rightly informed)
hold communion with these men in their Discipline and

under their Government, must needs goe to wracke, and be utterly
spoyled they and theirs.
            
            
               The Sixt Canon: An Oath injoyn'd for the preventing of all
Innovations in Doctrine and Government.
               Ah Lord, here is the filling up of the measure of all iniquity,

                        〈…〉
                     
                   ol all cruelty and tyranny. When they have brought
their plots to passe, when established and setled their Innovations
both in Doctrine and Government, then these hypocrites come with

                      for the preventing of all Innovations in Doctrine and
Government. This for the Title of the Canon. And that they
may exalt their hypocrisie to the height, that it may appeare to
all men, they further say: This Present Synod being desirous to declare

Doctrine and Discipline in the Church of England, and so they are
desirous to declare their Sincerity and Constancie in the profession
of the same. O holy Lord, who is able to deale with these
impious hypocrites, but thy selfe alone? And now that they have

                     ••
                  tained their ends in a good measure (for they do not meane to
stay here, till they have finished the Tower of Babel to its full
height, by degrees, after a while) they doe this to secure all men
against any Suspicion of revolt to Popery, or any other Superstition.
For when the Revolt to Popery and the Superstitions thereof, is
now in a good measure already made, then would they have
all men to be secure against any revolt to Popery. But what need
men to feare, when the danger is already past, and without remedie?
They have set up their Altars; they gently intreat adoration
thereunto, and that by the same arguments that Papists
use to colour over such Idolatry, till they have learne

themselves to all the world, the most base and vile Slaves, that
ever the earth bred. Yea the most of them (such especially as
know anything; and this time of light admits of no plea for
ignorance in any man) must of necessity (if at all they take this
Oath) Sweare against their own Consciences, and so in no small

So as Ministers, having universally defiled their Consciences,

thy Grace, that they may so stand for thy Truth and their Salvation
here, as they may one day stand undaunted before the Son

               And further we note out of the words of the Oath, That they
are to Sweare they doe approve the Doctrine and 
                        〈◊〉
                      line established
in the Church of England, as containing all things necessary to Salvation.
Now will they say, that the Discipline, or Government of the
Church of England containeth any thing necessary to Salvation, seeing
herein they joyne it with Doctrine, as containing together all
things necessary to Salvation? Nay, is not the Discipline and Government,
any enemy to Salvation, seeing it is altogether Antichristian,
Tyrannicall, and a meere usurpation, and in the whole
practise of it, and in all the Rites and Ceremonies, against the
word of God, and against the Doctrine and Practise of the Apostles,
and a most notorious and pestilent persecuter of the true
Saints and Servants of God, and a rooter out of all true Religion
and godlinesse out of the Land. Is it not Antichristian, and usurping
Christs Throne and Soveraignty over the Consciences of his
People, which is expresly and directly contrary to the Apostles
Doctrine, so as the subjection thereunto is clearely proved by
theCol. 2. 8, &amp;c▪
                   
                  Apostle to be a denying of Christ, and so a loosing of Salvation?
And for the Doctrine of the Church of England, how can
it be sayd to containe all things necessary to Salvation, when the most
principall Articles of Saving Grace are made of none effect, and
are forbidden to be preached to the people? And suppose all the
39 Articles were intire, and not corrupted, but preserved in their
true sense, agreeing with Scripture (asArticle of Consecration of Archbishops, &amp;c. some of them are not)
yet they cannot be sayd to containe all things necessary to Salvation.
For onely the holy Scripture, which is the onely ad. quate Rule of
Faith, containeth all things necessary to Salvation, it being a cleare
Commentary and exposition of it selfe, and a Rule whereby to try
all humane writings of Divinity whatsoever. Thus the matter
of the Oath it selfe is most false, and blasphemous, which with all
the rest we referre to thy judgement, ô Lord.

               The Seaventh Canon: A Declaration concerning some
Rites and Ceremonies.
               This Canon is generally for an uniformity in will-worship
throughout all England, and particularly in the introducing of
Altars in every Church, with the Service about it. The Canon for
this, first pretends, how it were to be wished, that unity of Faith were
accompanied with uniformity of practise in the outward worship and
Service of God. Now this outward worship is meerly of mans
devising, a will-worship, and expresly forbidden and condemned
by theCol. 2. 
                  Apostle, and therefore no Service of God: So as the uniformity
herein overthroweth not onely the unity of Faith, but
the faith it selfe, as Col. 2. And againe, such will-worship of
mans invention, is a fruit of the pride and presumption of mans
aine and gracelesse heart, and so cannot be truely called the Service
of God. For our God hates all such service, as himselfe hath
not commanded and prescribed in his word; according as thou

the Synod then with more ease, have removed quite away, both
the feare of the one, and the hope of the other, in leting the Communion
Tables stand, where they were wont to do? When a Stumbling
blocke stands in a darke way, whether is it not better (for
the preventing of stumbling) to remove the blocke, then to write

                   its 
                     〈◊〉
                   nature indifferent, neither commanded, nor condemned by
the word of God, either expresly, or by immediate deduction, and therfore
that no Religion is to be placed therein, or s
                     •
                  ruple to be made
thereon.
               First, if it be a thing indifferent, why doe they trouble me
Consciences of their weak
                        •
                      brethren with it, who hold it to be
a thing Scandalous? This is against the Apostles Rule, even the
rule of Charity, tending to the destruction of mens soules. Secondly,
if a thing indifferent, why are they so eagre for it, when
it may as well be forborne, and especially at this time, when
both the Kingdomes, and the wisest men therein, are so troubled
with it, the 
                     
                        •
                     eace disturbed, the State distracted, and the
Kingdomes hazarded? Thirdly, if it be indifferent, why doe
they not so leave it? Why doe they alter the nature of it, turning
the indifferencie into a necessity, as they doe with all their
other Ceremonies, which they professe to be in their own nature
indifferent, yet turne them out of their nature, and make them
necessary, and so intolerable burthens to mens Consciences?
Yea why doe they force all Ministers to take a Solemne Oath,
that they approve these things, as necessary to be observed?
               But neither is this they so urge, a thing in its own nature
indifferent, namely, whether the Communion-Table stand Sideway
under the East window of every Chancel. For, first, it is a Communion
Table, and therefore to stand in the midst, where all may
sit about it, as about a Table, and thus it is rightly and properly
a Communion-Table: it is not a Communion-Cubbord, or a Communion
dresser, to stand Side-way to the wall. That's no Communion
Table. And consequently such a standing Sideway to the
wall of every Chancel is by immediate deduction condemned in the
word of God. For the word of God calls and commends, and commands
this by the name of the Lords Table, and so it commands
withall the proper use of it, as of the Table of the Lord: but the
standing of this Table Sideway to the wall, takes away not onely
the nature, and indeed the name of a Table, but also the proper
use of the Lords Table, where every one of his family is to sit about
it. As David saith;
                     
                        〈…〉
                      28. 3. 
                  Thy Children like olive plants round about thy
table
                        •
                     . For such is the right and proper use of a Table. And

therefore, as the Scripture commands and commends unto us
the Lords Table, with the right use thereof, as is sutable to the
nature of it: So by necessary consequence, and immediate deduction,
the Scripture condemnes any such posture or placing therof,
as altee
                     •
                   both the nature and use of the Lords Table. So as
it is not a thi
                        •
                     g indifferent, whether the Table stand sideway to the
wall: for it ought not so to stand, seeing it is a perverting of the
nature and use of the Table of the Lord, and so a perverting of the
Lords Ordinance.
               
               Againe, not indifferent for all Chancels alike: for in many vast
Churches the People cannot heare, when their Priest sayes or
sings his Second Service at his new Altar, as he is injoyned:
unlesse the Ordinary be more mercifull to the Congregation, were
it a mercy to communicate with Superstitious worship and
Service.
               Againe, the word of God
                  Eze. 11. 12, 
                  expresly condemnes in his people the

                     •
                  mitation of the heathen in their Idolatry, or Superstition, or to
doe after their manner. So as such guises are not things indifferent.
Now for the standing of the Communion Table sideway to
the East wall, is to place it like to Popish Altars, which are Altars
of Idolatry, like to those of the heathen; and so is a faire inducement
by degrees of their Idolatrous Sacrifice too, for all the
faire pretences the Synod makes to the contrary. And doth not
the Synod confesse, that 
                     at the time of Reformation of this Church
from that grosse Superstition of Popery, it was carefully provided that
all meanes should be used to root out of the minds of the people, both
the inclination thereunto, and memory thereof; especially of the Idolatry
committed in the Masse, for which cause all Popish Altars were
demolished?
                   Then we aske thy Synod, why they are here so
zealous in seting up the Communion Table sideway to the East wall
after the manner of Popish Altars: Seeing before they pretend
such care and zeale for the suppressing of the growth of Popery, and
for the bringing of Papists to the English Church? Where, when
they come, and presently see a thing set up sideway at the East end
of the Chancel, just like their high-Altar, and seeing withall the
people, or Priest lowly lowting unto it, or devoutly bowing before
it, or toward it: are they not hereby straight put in mind of their
old Romish Idolatry, enough to make them presently to turne
Papists againe? Where is then the carefull provision of this
Synod, that all meanes be used to root out of the minds of such both
the inclination and memory of the Idolatry of the Masse, for which
cause our ancient Reformers caused all Romish Altars to be demolished?

                     ction did not necessarily tye the Table to stand at all other
times, saving at the Communion at the end of the Chancel, but for
most conveniencie, according to the discretion of the Minister
and Gardians. And certainly the good Queens intent never was,
are could be, that that standing so at other times, should be a
precedent for aftertimes, to introduce Altars againe, there to
have a fixed station, and so to become a stumbling blocke to
Protestants, and a laughing stock to Papists, causing the one to
feare Innovations, and the other to hope our backesliding into Popish
Superstation. And that the Table hath stood so ever since unremoved
in the Royall Chappels, there is not the same reason of a Chappel,
and of a Church; a Chappel wanting conver
                     •
                  ent roome to place
the Table in the midst. Although this was to be imputed rather
to want of Care in the Deane of the Chappel, then want of
roome in the Chappel, as in many other things besides. And as
for Cathedra

Images in all Cathedralls. And now their project plainly appeares
to be this, that by these Mother Churches as they call them, they
might introduce Altars into all other Churches, to verifie the
Proverbe, Like Mother, like Daughter. And whereas they name

thou not judge them? Cause them to know their abominations: and

all Cathedrall or those Mother Churches, have their Altars fixed,
and never removed, no not in time of Communion: by this Law
of Conformity therefore, all Parechiall Churches must have their
Tables fixed, and never to be removed, no not at the Communion.
And so being fixed, they cease now to be any longer Tables,
but put on the nature of Altars, which stand perpetually fixd.
Onely here is one helpe peradventure for it, if the Bishop be
pleased to give liberty to Parishes to remove the Table into the midst

                        ••
                     r the Communion; this liberty alwayes Saved. So as here is all the
hope of Parishes in this matter. Yet what hope, when the Bishop
shall answere such Suiters, Ye are a sort of Puritans; will you
be wiser then your Mother-Church, or wiser then the Sacred and holy
Synod, who judged it fit and convenient, that all Churches and Chappels
doe conforme themselves in this particular to the example of th
                        •
                     
Cathedrall, or Mother Churches? And though the Law give him
a generall Liberty in this to grant it, or no: yet he holds himselfe
rather bound by the Canon in this case, not to give liberty,
then dispensed to take and use liberty by the Law.
               But yet for all this the Synod gives one remedy, as to thinke
never a whit the worse of the Table, or to be out of conceit with
it, because being thus fixed, it seems to be quite turned from a
Table into an Altar: for it addeth: And we declare, that this Situation
of the Holy Table, doth not imply, that it is, or ought to be esteemed
a true and proper Altar, whereon Christ is againe really Sacrificed:
but it is, and may be called an Altar by us, in that sense, in which the
Primitive Church called it an Altar, and in no other. A Holy Table,
doe these holy men call it: but shall we thinke it ever a whit
the holyer, that it stands now fixed sideway to the wall? Yes:
for it is now an Altar: yet not a true and proper Altar, as whereon
Christ is againe really Sacrificed: no, so the Papists in some sense
will say for their Altars. But what say they to this: doe they
not meane it is such an Altar, as without which the Sacrifice,
                  
or offering upon it it is not sanctified
                        •
                     
                   Or is it not that Altar, wherof
the Apostle speaks,
                     
                        •
                     lib. 13. 10. 
                  We have an Altar, &amp;c? If it be not that
Altar, why doe they suffer Dr. Pecklingtons Christian Altar, so to
passe under their Authority, which saith, that this Altar is necessary,
as without which no Sacrifice we offer, is Sanctified? And why doe
they suffer other Bookes, that say, The Apostle meant this Altar,
when he said, We have an Altar? When therfore this Synod calls
in, and damnes these Bookes which by maintaining these Altars
of wood and stone, doe overthrow and deny the onely Altar
Iesus Christ: we may think, that these men have some good
meaning, when they say, that this Situation of the holy Table doth
not imply, that it is, or ought to be esteemed a true and proper Altar,
whereon Christ is againe really Sacrificed. But it is, and may be called
an Altar by us, in that sence that the Primitive Church called it an
Altar. Now who knows how farre these men extend the Primitive
Church? Perhaps down to Innocent 3, who first established
Transubstantiation, now above foure hundred yeares agoe,
For as for the purest estate of the Primitive Church, as in the
Apostles times, the Table of the Lord; was never called an Altar
at all, properly or improperly. The Scripture calls it only the
Table of the Lord. And some hundred yeares after the Apostles,

                     ans had no Altars at all, no not in name, which the Heathen
did obiect unto them. So as the Primitive Church in the
purest time of it had not so much as the name of Altars. And
our Communion Booke doth not once name it an Altar. How
comes then this Synod to be so bold, as to call the Table an Altar,
and teach, that it is, and may be so called▪
                   And what if some
Fathers called it so▪ As they were a little too free (though
meaning no harme) in their allegorising, which the Romanists
have made advantage of, to advance their Idolatry. And Lord,
thou shalt try the spirit of these men, whether for the love
they beare to Rome, and to bring England to a perfect Reconciliation
with her, they affect to call it an Altar, rather then a
Table; though the time is not yet ripe for them, fully to manifest
themselves, and to display their Roman Colours in open
fields. But for us, we ought not in any sense to call the Lords
Table an Altar, seeing the Scripture calls it onely a Table, and
never, an Altar: and seeing also it is an easie inducement to
Popish Idolatry and Superstition, to which use all Papists use it,
and which use this Synod, by all signes shows it selfe easie to be
intreated to bring up againe in the Church of England.
               
               For in the next place, they make an Order for rayling in this

Altar, to seperate it from the rest of the Church, that none doe
touch it, as if it were more holy, and the matter thereof more
precious, then any other part of the Church. And by this
meanes, though they pretend the prevention of profanation, yet
they labour to beget in the Peoples minds some high and reverend
opinion of this their Altar, as of some extraordinary
holy creature, or rather divine thing, that so they may with the
more facility, and lesse se

when ever they but look upon it, or approach it, or passe
by it; of which they tell us more anon.
               And the next thing is, that all that will receive the Communion,
must come up to present themselves before this Altar upon their knees;
condemning the usuall manner of the Ministers carrying the
bread and wine about the Church. But they called this Altar a Table,
but even now: and is it so suddainly swallowed up in an
Altar, as in stead of sitting about the Table (which is Christs
own ordinance, and the proper use and posture of guests about a
Table) now men must kneele before the Altar, as before some new
God-Allmighty? So as thine ordinance, ô Lord, is here quite perverted,
and from a Table-Communion turned into a Superstitious
Altar-Service. Whereas if the Table were set in the midst, and
the Communicants did come and sit round about it, as many as
could at a time, and so did eat and drinke the Lords Supper, this
is Christs own ordinance: but to come and kneele before an Altar,
this is not according to Christs ordinance, nor is it aright to
eat the Lords Supper at the Lords Table.
               
               The last tging is, after many faire pretences and preambles
(as of the Church, the house of God, dedicated to his holy worship, to
put us in mind of the greatnesse and goodnesse of his Divine Majesty,
and the like) the Synod thinks it very behoofull, that all doe reverence
and obeysance both at their Coming in, and going out of the
Churches, Chancels, or Chappels, &amp;c. And the motives which the
Synod useth to perswade all People hereunto, are sundry. As
1. It is not with any intention to exhibit any religious worship to the
Communion Table, the East, &amp;c. or in the Celebration of the holy
Eucharist (as they call it) rather the Lords Supper) upon any opinion
of a corporall presence of Christs body there, &amp;c. Now from these
words (though the Synod doe not expressely and directly Order,
that men in doing such reverence and obeysance, do set their faces
towards the Altar, East-ward, where it standeth) yet we learne
plainly their meaning to be so, in that they say, not with any intention
to exhibit any religious worship to the Communion Table, or

East: Ergo towards the Table, or East, men must doe reverence,
s
                        •
                      it be not with intention of Religious worship. But by their leaves,
Intention, or not intention, so to bow, so to doe reverence to, or towards
this, or that place, is no lesse, then flat Idolatry, whether
it be done to the place it selfe, or thereby to God. For God will
not be worshiped in or by either an Image, or any representation
of his Majesty or Divine presence; as if God were fixed to this
or that place, all which is forbidden in the Second Commandement.
And being done to the creature, as to the Table, or Altar,
or towards the East, being done in the Church, which they say is
the place of Gods worship, must not all such externall worship there
exhibited, be a religious worship▪
                   So as whether People intend
any such thing, or no, as by doing obe
                        •
                     rsance to the Table, to exhibit
religious worship, yet the worship it selfe so exhibited in the place
of Gods worship, is, must needs be a religious, yea and divine worship.
So as here is flat Idolatry committed by authority of this holy
Synod. Or will they call this adoration (for adoration it is) a civil
worship▪
                   This is no lesse an absurdity, and grosse profanation of
things Sacred, to give them a Civil worship. Therfore seeing
the Synod will needs have a worship so exhibited, and this is not
(say they) with any intention of a religious worship: let them tell
us what kind of worship they meane. Unlesse their meaning be
this, that it may passe for a religious worship, as of the body, so the
intention of the mind be wanting; that so a man may commit
Idolatry not yeelding a religious worship to the creature outwardly
with his body, so as his mind be free from intention, that he
meant no harme by it. And the like reason there is for bowing,
or kneeling at the Communion: this is a religious worship, or
adoration: and it is done, as to some imaginary corporall presence
of Christ on the Table, or to the Elements themselves, or to the
Table. But to be done as to Christs corporall presence, the Sy
                        ••
                     d
would have that opinion forborne. It remaines then, that the
adoration, or religious worship to be done, though not intended,
either to the Elements, or to the Table, or to the Altar, or to the
East; for now all the Communicants are upon their knees all
looking that way.
               But say they, secondly, this worship is for the advancement of
Gods Majesty, and to give him alone that honour and glory, that is due
unto him. Is it so? And is it not then a Religious worship, that is
so exhibited, that is done for the advancement of Gods Majesty, and
to give him alone that honour and glory, that is due un to him? Certainly
this must needs be a Religious and Divine worship, and that

in a high degree. And being so, shall the Synod be ashamed, or
affraid to allow men an Intention of performing this Religious
worship, when it is for the a
                        •
                     vancement of Gods Majesty? Will
God accept of a Sacrifice, that wants a heart? Or how is God
honoured by our Service, when it is done without an Intention?
But here is yet a worse matter in it, that marres the Synods intention
for the advancement of Gods Majesty. And that is, All
this worship (call it what they will) is a meere will-worship (of
which before) and so of which God saith,Math. 15. 9. 
                  In vaine they honour
and worship me, teaching for Doctrines the precepts of men. And the
Synop cannot but confesse, that all this Court-Ceremony is the
upshot of this their Canon and Constitution: a Commandement of
men therefore: and so abominable in Gods worship and Service.
               
               But thirdly, This say they (to wit, this outward reverence in
Gods worship) must needs be pious in it selfe, profitable unto us, and
edifying unto others. Must needs? Upon what necessity? For
first, can that be pious in it selfe, which God hath absolutely forbidden
and condemned, as abominable to be used in his Service?
And such is all invention of man in Gods worship; as before.
Secondly, Profitable to us, say they. Wherein profitable to us,
to disobey and dishonour God in our fancifull devises? Or profitable,
in that sense, wherein the Pharisees taught children to cast
off all honour to their Parents, Saying unto them,
                  Math. 15. 5. 
                  It is a gift, by whatso

                     ver
thou mightest be profited by me: and honour not his Father or
his Mother. So, how can that beNilutile, quod non honestum est. Cic. Offic. 
                  profitable to us, which is dishonourable
to our heavenly Father? And thirdly, for Edifying
unto others: how Edifying? Surely no other way, but as the Apostle
saith,1 Cor. 8. 10. 
                  If any man see thee, that hast knowledge, sitting in the
Idols Temple, shall not the Conscience of him that is weake (dikodomethéseta)
be edified (as the word properly signifieth) that is,
imboldened to eat of things offered to Idols? And just such Edifying
unto others, is this will-worship of the Synod, whereby they being
men of knowledge and learning, doe edify or imbolden simple people
to follow their practise, and obey their Precept, in giving
reverence and obeysance in the Church, that is, religious worship to
a stone Altar, or wodden Table, which is Idolatry, though coloured
over with never so specious and faire pretences, as without any
intention of a religious worship: which is the ordinary apron of

               But Fourthly, This (say they) hath been the most ancient custome

of the Primitive Church in the purest times, and of this Church also
for many yeares of the Raigne of Queen Elizabeth. The reviving therfore
of this ancient and laudable Custome, we heartily commend to the
serious Consideration of all good people. How? Hath this been the
most ancient Custome of the Primitive Church in the purest times, to
common Idolatry with Stocks and Stones? For what were those
purest times of the Primitive Church? Were they not the Apostles
owne times? Were not th
                        •
                     se the purest times of the Primitive
Church? And will they, dare they say, or much lesse, can they
prove, that the Apostles, or the Church in their time used any such
custome? Fy for shame, that a Synod should dare, without blushing,
to vent such abominable lyes. For if they meane it of the
times of the Church after the Apostles, those certainly were not
the purest times, as wherein many Supersitions began quickly to
grow up, to strow the way for the coming of Antichrist, the
Mystery of Iniquity beginning to worke even in the Apostles
dayes.
               But this Devotion was of ancient custome in this Church also for
many yeares of the raigne of Queen Elizabeth. That's true indeed;

                     st, both coming in,
and going out of the Church. They would not misse it. But
ye must undestand this was a place, where they had not Scarce
one Sermon in Seaven yeares: So as, it was no marvaile if still
they walked in darknesse, when they wanted the light to shine
forth unto them in the preaching of the Gospel, which where
it comes in the vigour of it, drives away all darknesse of errour,
and spirituall blindnesse, as thePsal. 104. 22 
                  Sun arising chaseth the wild beasts
into their dennes, as David saith. Insomuch, as we have seen and
known by abundant experience (blessed be our God) that in all
places of the Kingdome, where sound preaching hath been, all
such Superstition hath been packed out of the Church. But this
riddance could not be expected for some of the first yeares of
Queen Elizabeth, when the Land was but newly crope out of
Popery, and Preachers were but Scarce, and the old race had not,
could not put away the old leaven, or cast off the Slough of
Popish Superstition. And therefore the Synod saith truth in this,
that for some yeares, yea in some places, many of the Raigne of
Queen Elizabeth (which was towards the beginning of her
Raigne) these Superstitious customes were in use. And had the
Royall Chappels, and Cathedralls had as sound preachers in them
usually: as other Parochiall Churches in the Kingdome, that would

have ript up the rotten bowels of Popish Supersition, so fairely
painted over in goodly Images, Crucifixes, and the like unremoved
in those places: there had not by this time remained
one Romish ragge, whereof this Synod might make a coat for the
Church of England now to be fashioned by.
               But now the Coat is made up, all the Skill will be how to
perswade this whole Church to put it on. Yea it is so little and
strait, as being measured and patternd by two or three Chappels,
and a few Cathedralls, it wilbe very hard to force it upon Englands
broad backe, without extreme pinching of it, or tearing the
Coat. Now for this, in the last place, this Courteous and kind Synod,
wheras it might command, is pleased to stoop so low, as to
intreat, yea heartily to intreat, againe and againe: We (say they)
heartily commend this to all good and well affected people, members of
this Church, &amp;c. And a little lower againe: The reviving of this
ancient and Laudable Custome, we heartily commend to the serious
c
                        •
                     nsideration of all good people. And for this, reason perswades us
to beleeve, that the Synod is cordiall in redubbling such hearty
Commendations of such Romish reliques and so Laudable Customes,
to all good people. First, because good people will not easily be
drawn to such things, without some strong motive, nor with
that, neither. And secondly, could their hearty Commendations
prevaile in this, it would greatly conduce to a speedy making
up of that Reconciliation between the Church of England, and of
Rome, so greatly desired and laboured in the Primates Late Relation,
the President of this Synod. Who tells us there more plainly
what we may understand here by Commending; for (saith he,
pag. 7.) there is a Laudendo praecipere, by Lauding or Commending

                        〈◊〉
                      Command. And therefore they stick not to be so Liberall in
their hearty Commendations of this brave piece of Service. But
why should now this Spirit be conjured up againe, or this dead
Coale of Romish zeale revived, having for so long a time lyen
consopited, yea dead under a heap of ashes, never to have kindled
flames, or troubled the world againe. Why should this Satan
of our peace, which had been so long bound, now be let loose
againe, to set Kingdomes in a combustion 
                     •
                   Surely they told us

                     •
                   In a conformity to the
Royall Chappels and Cathedrals. But were it not every way better,
that those few should give place, and rather conforme to the
Generality of all the Churches in England, where these Superstitions
had been cast out, and all quiet: then that the Generality
should conform to a few, to indanger the whole State, and hazzard
the losse of all
                     •
                  
               
               
                  But in the last place, they come with a pretty handsome
Close, saying, In the practise, or omission of this Rite, we desire that
the rule of Charity prescribed by the Apostle, may be observed, which
is, that they which use this Rite, despise not them who use it not, and that
they who use it not, condemne not those that use it. O Lord God,
Ps
                        •
                     l. 74. 10. 
                  how long shall the wicked blaspheme thy Name? For ever? Can
they not be content to abuse thy People, in leading and drawing
them into all manner of Superstition, but they must usurpe
the Apostles rule, and pervert it to the maintenance of such blind
and damned Rites? The Rule of the Apostle is for the use of
things in their own nature indifferent, as eating, or not eating,
wherein Charity is to preserve peace: but it gives no countenance
at all to things altogether unlawfull in themselves, and no way
indifferent; as before. And had these men true Charity, they
would be so farre from pressing these things to a generall use,
as they would rather altogether suppresse them where they are
used, as being a Stumbling blocke to the whole Land, upon the
which, if not removed, the whole Land must stumble and fall.
And therefore had this Synod had any one sparke of an Apostolicall
Spirit in it (as they show it to be altogether Apostaticall) it
would in the first place have rather observed the Apostles Rule,
for a man not to put a stumbling block, or an occasion to fall in his brothers
way: then breaking this Rule of Charity, have abused the
Apostles words, to prescribe to a whole Land a Rule of false
Charity. But to thee, O Lord, doe we commit the judgement of
this whole Cause, which we can doe no more, nor lesse but
complain of to thy Majasty, the righteous judge of all the world.

               Now passing by the 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th Canons, as of 
                     〈◊〉
                  
moment, in the 13th. Of Excommunication and Absolution
not to be pronounced but by a Priest.
               Herein first we may observe what kind of Excommunications
and Absolutions have been usuall in our Prelates 
                     〈…〉
                  
extreme abusie and prefanation of Christs Ordinance 
                        〈…〉
                     
of his Church. Which Ordinance, as it doth 
                     〈…〉
                  
belong to the Prelate (whose whole Order 
                        〈…〉

                     〈…〉
                  
and their Officers. So as here is a Reformat: 
                  
                     〈…〉
                  
at the best is stark nought, as being an 
                     〈◊〉
                   usurpation.
For in this Canon they take away all power from every 
                     〈◊〉
                  
of his Congregation, to whom with others appointed by the
Parish, according to Gods word, belongs the power of Ecclesias
                        •
                     call
Censures. And in this Canon also, he that is absolved, must
become more bound, then ever he was before, because first he
must take an Oath, de parendo Juri, &amp; stando Mandatis beclesiae:
of obeying the Canons, and standing to the Commands of the
Church. So as his Absolution becomes his bondage: when now
in stead of Gods Commandements, he must be subject to the
Churches Canons, Decrees, and Commands: which is an Antichristian
Tyranny: and more now then ever before, for this
Synod sake.
               Againe, omitting the 14th and 15th Canon, the 16th is concerning
Licenses to Marry. So as this Canon is to maintaine a
Doctrine of Devils, mentioned by the Apostle, as namely forbidding
to Marry (be it either to some sort of men, as Romish
Priests, or to all sorts of men at certaine times in the yeare)
                  
                     ••
                   as at such times (which altogether containe almost halfe of
the yeare) without the Bishops Speciall Licence, no Man or Woman
may Marry. Thus it is cleare, that herein these Hypo

                     rites
the Sell Gods free Ordinance for money, and so maintaine a
Doctrine of Devils. And thus farre of the Canons of this Synod.
               
               The Conclusion of all which is, the Kings avowing, approving,
confirming, and injoyning these Canons to be observed of

all respectively, according to the tenure thereof in all and every part.

unto this late Synod, observed and collected out
of the Relation of a Conference by William

                      Dedicatory to the King, he saith: The King
and the Priest, more then any other, are bound to look to the Integrity
of the Church in Doctrine and Manners, and that in the first
place. For that's by farre the best Hone. in the Hive. This we see
now fullfilled; whereby we come to know who is that Priest,
and what that Integity of the Church in Doctrine and Manners, concluded
in this late synod; but whether as in a Hive of Bees, or
in a

                  Prediction. 2.
                  And againe, ibid. To deale clearely with your Majesty, these
thoughts (of the externall worship of God) are they; and no other, which

of the externall worship of God in the Church. Thus
we see that the whole plot and project of the Primates Booke,
was thus to alter, and thus to settle the Doctrine and Discipline,
and external worship in the Church, as we have seen effected in
the late Synod. So as it appeares, both this Synod, and the things
concluded therein have been a good w

                        〈◊〉
                      (to wit, the

Prince, and the Clergie) principally the power and direction for Reformation
belongs. Princes have their parts by their Calling together of
the Bishops, and others of the Clergie to consider of that, which might
seem worthy Reformation: And the Clergie did their part in the Nationall
Synod, of 62. And the Articles there agreed on, were afterwards

                        •••
                     firmed by Acts of State, and the Royall Assent. Here is another
Patterne of this late Nationall Synod: but that this wants the
right legge, to make it goe upright and passe currant for a
Nationall Synod, namely the confirmation by the Act of State, to
wit, the Act of Parliament;
                        
                           〈◊〉
                        
                      
                     as before is noted. So as here is also
one Contradiction, overthrowing this Nationall Synod; consisting
of the two Provinciall, Canterbury and Yorke. Both together want
the Act of Parliament to confirme it a Nationall Synod, to bind
the whole Nation, which the Synod presumes to doe, both in
Ministers and People.
               
               
                  Contradiction. 2.
                  Relat 205. Emperours and Kings are Custodes utriusque Tabalae:

                      and preservation of both Tables of the
Law for worship to God, and duty to man are committed. A Booke of
the Law was by Gods owne command in Moses his time was to be given
to the King, Deut. 17. The Kings under the Law, but still according
to it, did proceed to necessary Reformations in Church Businesses, and
theirin commanded the very Priests themselves, &amp;c. This being so,
that the Kings under the Law had the care of the preservation of
Gods Law and Religion committed unto them, to preserve them
safe and sound, and where any corruption had crept in, to reform
Religion, but still according to Gods Law, and that not one jot to
vary from it; how comes this Synod of Priests (being assembled
by Royall authority, and commanded by a King under the Gospel
to treat and agree upon some Canons necessary for the advancement of
Gods Glory, the edifying of his holy Church, and the due reverence of
his blessed Mysteries and Sacraments) to be so bold, as to agree and
conclude and enact such Canons and Constitutions, as are directly
against the Law and word of God, to the great dishonour of God,
the ruinating of his holy Church, and the great abuse and profanation
of his blessed Mysteries and Sacraments? And herein we call heaven
and earth to witnesse, and the Lord Iesus Christ to be Judge,
whether this Synod hath dealt faithfully, or no with the King, or
between him and his people, and that also in these perillous times.

his people, are abused, and his Kingdomes embroyled and indangered

expressions may not be used in familiar discourse, much lesse
may they be crowded into an Oath. The Israelites said of the
Levites Concubine, there was no such deed done nor seen from the
day that the Children of Israel came up out the Land of Aegypt unto
this day; consider of it, take advise and speake: that same may be
said of this Oath. There was never such a deed done or seen
since we came out of spirituall Aegypt. Consider of it, take advise

Now this Oath will hinder the alteration of the Church Government
to a better. For being once sworn to: Melius non
mutabis pejus. Christs Kingdome must be kept out, Antichristian
Offices, government, rules, and wayes of proceeding be established
in the Church, and that by an Oath. If the Book of Common
Prayer would better the Discipline, and doe much wish
therefore to have publique Penance restored, this Oath contradicts
it, and tells us that we have all the Discipline is needfull
to Salvation, and that the Government by right ought to stand
a
                        •
                      now it stands. But there are great grievances, dreadfull disorders,
and horrible corruptions in the Discipline and Government
of the Church, as now it stands; and men should rather
sweare to indeavour their utmost to get them removed in this
approaching Parliament, then give consent to have them unalterd
one day longer: as Iesu-worship, Altar-worship, kneeling at
Sacrament, promiscuous receivers, subscription, Oaths ex Officio, Canonicall
obedience, reading of Apocrypha Books, abuse of Excommunication,
the exorbitant power of Bishop interdicting whole Churches,
perverting equity in all their Courts, changing times and seasons
for Marriage at their pleasure, hindring Preaching and praying
where they list, imposing new and unlawfull things upon the Ministry,
illegally outing them from their livings, &amp;c. The proceeding
yet in many things by the Popes Canon Law; the taking away
the power of the keyes from the Pastors of particular Congregations,
and setting up Chancellors over them and their flocks,
putting into Laymens hands (for a Chancellor is no other) the
power of Excommunication. Lay-Elders are much cryed out of,
and condemn'd by us in the Scottish and Forraigne Churches,
and yet we set and hold them up at home with both hands.
The Bishop delegates his power to the Chancellour, and so the
sentence of Excommunication is devolv'd upon a meere Layman,
which dealing with Presbyterians, we say is incompatible
to a Lay-man: and what is this, but to destroy with the hand
what we bind with the tongue. Neither is that shift avayleable
to say, it's some grave Minister that must pronounce the sentence,
because he is but os Canceliarij, the mouth of the Chancellour, to
pronounce what he decrees: who can stoppe it if not pronounc'd

call it out of the Ministers hand, and must give the
A
                        •
                     solution if pronounced, and so the whole power lyes still in
the Chancellors hand. If these things therefore and diverse
other were altered, we should not abjure them, but thinke our
selves bound by right and Conscience to intertaine them.
               Againe, this Oath appeares further to be unlawfull. First, because
it doth insuare our Consciences, and takes away the liberty
of them, binding us not so much as to consent unto any alteration,
although it should be in the judgement of all farre
better then what we have. Secondly, it doth make us vassals
and bondslaves to the Prelary, we must be their sworn Subjects,
and tye our selvs by Oath to uphold their tottering Kingdome.
And if the Prelacie have its pedegree from Rome, as some of

                  . It requires me to Sweare sincerely, without any secret

               8. We are bound to take it heartily, and willingly, which no
man that hath any consideration or conscience can doe. For it's
against truth, and obligeth to sweare a falsehood, viz. that the
Government of this Church as now it stands, ought by right so to stand,
which is not true of Chancellours, Commissaries, Off
                        •••
                     alls, &amp;c. nor
of Bishops proceeding in their Courts in their own names, and
under their own Seales. It s against judgement, including a contradiction,
as appeares in the 7th particular: It's against righteousnes,
because both the Parliament, the Prince and Pastors themselves
are perjured by it, as hath formerly bin shewn; and it's
a swearing up a corrupt, if not an Antichristian Government over
the People. Besides this Oath is backed with severe punishment.
Refusall of it brings Deprivation, ab Officio &amp; Beneficio. Hence
many that are poore and weake it's to be feared) will take the
Oath, reluctante conscientia, and to save their Livings, forsweare
themselves.
               9. This Oath is full of ambiguities. The Doctrine of the
Church is not clearely known, the Homilies have been disclaim'd.
The Articles are challenged by the Armi
                        ••
                     ans and others,
to be for them. It's doubtfull to us whether a great part
of Scripture be not excluded as unnecessary, because much of the
Scripture is neither verbaily expressed, nor vertually included
in the publique Declaration of the Doctrine and Discipline of

the Church of England, and that they are said to containe all
things necessary to salvation: we are doubtfull of the Discipline,
because much depends upon the interpretation of the Ordinary,
which is unknown: and yearely differing Articles are
composed for Visitations. And although a generall standing
Book of Articles be promised for the whole Kingdome, yet
three yeares liberty is reserved for alteration, and who can say
he knoweth what the Discipline is. We doubt whether the
Oath doth not suppose some Popish Doctrine established. We
know not in what sense those words by right it ought to stand, are
to be taken. This word jus, or right, is a word equivocall. There
is jus Divinum, and if we sweare in this sense, then we sweare
Deanes, Archdeac
                        ••
                     s, and the &amp;c. to stand jure divino. There is
jus Ecclesiasticum, and if we sweare in that sense, then the Prelates
will not be our Friends, because we sweare divine right from
them. There is jus positum, and if we sweare in this sense, then
the Hierarchie must loose both divine and Ecclesiasticall right. It
being thus, who can sweare without equivocation?
               
               Lastly, no man taking this Oath can well acquit himselfe of
perjury, for if he take it in the plain common sense and understanding
of the words, yet there must be some mentall reservation in
the words &amp;c. and equivocation in the minds of Hyerarchicall
men touching those words by right: for though they should
venture to sweare Prelates into a jus divinum, yet they dare not
sweare Deanes and Archdeacons into it, and so must sweare in a
double sense, and perjure themselves But all this may be helped
by our own interpretations and protestations.
                  Perjurisunt quiid quod falsum esse sciunt, aut putant juramento confirment. Est in sent

Oath, by the Kings Commission are tyed to keep the very words▪
                  
of it; if they should leave out the &amp;c they have no power to administer
it at all. And the Oath▪

common sense of the words If we then take the Oath: and protest
against such and such senses, and make a sense of our own, this is

made before a publique notary, this shalbe sufficient evidence

a sense of their own, how have they perjur'd themselvs, propham'd
their hands, and put in a barre against their future conferring of
holy Orders.
