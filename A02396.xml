            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

               Printed by Cantrell Legge, Printer to the Ʋniuerſitie of Cambridge. 1619.
            
         
         
            
            
            ¶ To the very Worſhipfull, RICHARD STUBBE, Eſquire. *⁎*
            
            
               SIR: I requeſt you to bee God-father vnto this Infant, as you haue beene ſometime vnto my ſelfe. It is thought an abruptneſſe to imprint anything without a Dedication, which makes me thus bold with your name. I hope you will take it at my hands no otherwiſe then as a token of my thankefulneſſe for your manifold and fatherly affection. In which reſpect I principally commend it vnto you: as alſo

vnto your two Daughters, my Coſen Yeluerton, and the Ladie Strange: I muſt alſo commend the peruſall of it vnto Mr. Robert Rudde of St. Florence in Southwales, and Mr. Henrie Godly of Onehouſe in Suffolke, my very good and learned Tutors, togetherwith my ſingular friend Mr. Doctor Porter of Cambridge. Finally, the vſe and benefit of it I commmend, as vnto my Chriſtian Friends the Pariſhioners of Edgfield, ſo alſo vnto as many as loue the ſingle, gentle, and powerfull truth, eſpecially in the Text following.
         
      
      
         
            
            
               MATTH. 26.26. 
               This is my body.
            
            
               THAT this then is the body of our Sauiour, it is without all queſtion: Yea, not onely His body, but euen Himſelfe (a part beeing put for the whole) it may be affirmed: but whether it bee His body indeed, and ſubſtance; or onely by way of Sacrament; that is the terrible and vnappeaſeable queſtion at this day. The ſtrife betwixt the Archangell and the deuill about the body of Moſes,
               Iud. 9. might well prefigure this ſtrife, but exceed, it could not. And no maruell if 
                  •
               he ſtrife be ſo great, conſidering in the end that one of the

two muſt be conuinced, both of higheſt impiety againſt God, and alſo of extreame folly amongſt men. For whether to deny Diuine honour vnto the Creator, or to impart Diuine honour vnto a creature, both are moſt impious: ſo againe, to affirme that to be corruptible bread, which indeed is very God; or that to be very God, which indeed is corruptible bread; both are extreamly fooliſh. You ſee then, Reader, 
                  •
               ow neerly it concernes you to be throughly aduiſed what part you take in ſo momental a cauſe: for if you chuſe neither, then are you cōdemnable of irreligion: and if you cleane to the falſe, then are you culpable of impiety or idolatry, if not blaſpheming. For the better directing therefore and ſtabliſhing your choice in ſo concerning a cauſe; and whereby you may

happily find a thred of expedition vnto the truth herein, wee commend vnto you the peruſall of this Treatiſe. Wherein if you ſhall but ſo long indure vs vntill we haue, firſt laid downe the equity, conueniencie, and neceſſitie of the one Expoſition; and then the vanitie, impiety, and deformity of the other; we make no queſtion, but you will more liuely imbrace the truth, and more mortally abhorre the falſhood in this point, then euer you did.
            We then which expound This, to be His Body, onely by way of Sacrament, and as water in Baptiſme is His blood; doe take the intent of our Sauiour in this buſineſſe to be for the ordayning and faſtning a ſecond ſeale vnto his New Teſtament: that whereas now He had vndergone the condition of mans nature, and

was about to finiſh the price of our redemption; Hee thought good not onely to haue it recorded in Scriptures, and publiſhed all the world ouer what he had done for vs (though that might haue beene thought ſufficient for beleeuers,) but alſo to ordaine certain viſible tokens and formes of remembring His ſuch performance: that ſo as His word did inwardly, theſe ſeales might outwardly, ſeuerally in Baptiſme, and ioyntly in this Communion, expreſſe and impart vnto men the benefit of His incarnation and ſuffring; and we thereby to haue both His hand and ſeales to our redemption. Which ſeales alſo that they might the more inſeparably be made one with His teſtament, and withall at the firſt bluſh more liuely repreſent the ſubſtance thereof; He thought

good to ſtampe and imprint them with his owne image and ſuperſcription: and therefore here in the text calleth the bread expreſſely His bodie, as an other Scripture likewiſe calleth the other ſeale, His blood: (the ſpirit,
               1. Ioh. 5.
                     •
                  . 
               water, and blood are one:) And all this finally the rather, that wheras the old Teſtament had beſide the ſame word inwardly containing it, alſo a couple of outward ſeales to giue a ſenſibility vnto it; and they alſo both ſeuerally, as in the circumciſion, and ioyntly as in the feaſt of Paſſeouer, in like manner exhibiting the vſe and benefit of it; and finally beeing likewiſe cloathed and ſtamped with the names of the things ſignified (Circumciſion beeing called the Couenant, whereof it was but a ſeale, and the Feaſt the Paſſeouer, whereof it was but a celebration)

it might hereby come to paſſe, that the new Teſtament ſhould moſt perfitly reſemble as well as accompliſh the old; and the olde as it did prefigure and fore-runne, ſo alſo might it imbrace, acknowledge, and giue place to the newe. Now as touching our Sauiours forme of ſpeech, in calling that His bodie, which we expound to bee but a Sacrament thereof; wee further adde, that ſuch: conciſeneſſe of ſpeech, is ordinary with the Scipture, with our Sauiour, and his Apoſtles, and finally with all ſorts of men. As for the Scripture; that euery where vſeth ſuch ſignificant figures, and eſpecially when it poynteth vnto our Sauiour: as, when it calls Him, a rocke, a ſtone, a lyon, a lambe, a ſtarre, a dore, a vine, the way, the truth, the life, the reſurrection, our head, our

roote, our garment, our dwelling, our ſhepheard, our peace, &amp;c. But aboue all, our Sauiour Himſelfe ſo abounding in this kind, as that He 
                  •
               orbare not in His publike morals (when He meant to be moſt plaine,) to bid men out off the offending hand, and plucke out the offending eye; as if He expected euen from the vulgar to be otherwiſe vnderſtood then the letter did import: and as for thoſe of the wiſer ſort, He often grew angry with them for taking Him at the letter; as with Nicodemus for ſo plaine vnderſtanding His tearme of beeing borne againe; with the Diſciples for their no better vnderſtanding the leauen of the Phariſes; and with the Capernites for their like carnall vnderſtanding the eating of His fleſh. The Apoſtles alſo, as they followed Him in the ſteps of His life, ſo

ſo did they vſually follow Him in the ſame character of ſpeech: in ſo much as Paul was not nice to ſay plainely,1. Cor 10.4. 
               the rocke was Chriſt: as alſo he ſaith to all beleeuers, now are yee the bodie of Chriſt,
               1. Cor. 12.27. 
               and members in particular:
               Epheſ. 5.30. Yea, we are the members of His body, of His fleſh, and of His bones. And S. Iohn forbeares not to ſay,1. Ioh. 5.8. that the ſpirit, water, and blood, theſe three are one:
               Apoc. 1.5. and that we are waſhed in his blood: both which ſayings do giue as great and greater dignity vnto Baptiſme, if the letter ſhould be preſſed, then the calling bread His bodie, can giue to this other Sacrament. And yet ſhould not he be thought (at leaſt) diſtempred in his wittes, that would hereupon inferre a ſubſtantiall change of that water? though with farre leſſe diſhonour vnto God might ſuch a conſequence be inferred,

and with farre better colour: for as much as Baptiſme (if compariſons may be made in holy things) is the Sacrament of our firſt quickning, as this is of our nouriſhing; and more noble it is of the two to make aliue, then to preſerue life: Baptiſme againe beeing but once adminiſtred, but this often; Baptiſme beeing expreſſely charged vpon the Apoſtles to be adminiſtred vnto all nations, beeing alſo made a Mat. 16.16.ioynt-condition with faith vnto ſaluation, whereas this other in neither caſe is mentioned: and finally our Sauiour Himſelfe openly partaking Baptiſme, and gracing it with miraculous opening the heauens; whereas this, if He did at all partake it, was in priuate, and without any granted miracle. Yea laſt of all, the Fathers honouring Baptiſme with

as high tearmes as might be; one ſaying of it,Ambr. de. Sacr. 1.5. 
               The water hath the Grace of Chriſt, in it is the preſence of the Trinity. And an other thus; In the Sacrament of Baptiſme we are made bone of His bone,
               Chryſoſt. in epiſt ad Eph. Hom. 20. 
               and fleſh of His fleſh.
               Aug. de vtil. per 
                     •
                  . c. 1. And Auſtine thus: Without doubt euery beleeuer is made a partaker of the bodie and blood of Chriſt, when in Baptiſme hee is made a member of Chriſt▪ yea, though before the eating thereof hee depart the world.
               Leo. Ep. 13. And Leo, calling it the wonderfull Sacrament of regeneration, ſaith in an other place of it;Serm. 4. de Nativ. 
               Chriſt gaue that to the water, which He gaue to His mother. In which ſenſe alſo Paulinus: The heauenly water (ſaith he in his poeme) marrieth with elementall water; and ſo (concipit vndi Deum) the water conceiueth God our Sauiour. So likewiſe the Rocke which is called; not the body of Chriſt, but expreſſely

               Chriſt; may it not farre aduance it ſelfe aboue this bread, if the letter be ſtood vpon? eſpecially for that the Rock moſt miraculouſly, and Sauiour like, did guſh forth water to the refreſhing a huge multitude in the wilderneſſe; whereas this Bread which our Sauiour ſpeakes of, made not the leaſt ſhew of difference from common bread: the Rocke alſo being but one and the ſame in particular, whereof it was firſt ſpoken, the rocke was Chriſt; whereas the bread which at this day is adminiſtred, is not that bread in particular, whereof our Sauiour ſaid, it was His bodie; nor can attaine to that name and honour, but by the helpe of inference and figures, and that no leſſe then thirty to make their expoſition good,Iewel art. 12. diui
                     •
                  . (as dainty as they are of figures) as a late Father of

our Church hath obſerued. Againe, if the letter muſt be of ſuch force (though the letter is made to ſerue not to maſter our meanings) why may not euery beleeuer account himſelfe a member of Chriſt indeed, and ſubſtantially according to thoſe alleadged ſayings of Paul? eſpecially conſidering how the beleeuers are in Scripture vſually ſaid to be changed, conuerted, renewed, new created, &amp;c. but neuer was it ſo ſaid of this bread? Or why ſhall not euery beleeuer expect as well a litterall performance of that promiſe of Chriſt, when He ſaith,Apoc. 3.20. 
               Behold, I ſtand at the doore and knocke, and willſup with him that openeth? it beeing of the two, more conceiueable (how thinke you) that He ſhould perſonally become our companion at ſupper, then the ſupper it ſelfe. To conclude;

As Chriſts Apoſtles, and the Scriptures, ſo finally all ſorts of men, both holy and common, doe ordinarily vſe words, both beyond and beſide the litterall ſenſe: partly of neceſſity, when either they be driuen to borrow a word, or the hearer cannot ſo well vnderſtand a proper word; and partly againe for breuity ſake (when there is no likelihood to be miſtaken,) as when we call 
                  •

                  •
               tended to decypher the Kings

partly alſo hyperbollically, when we affirme more then can be, to bring men beleeue as much as may be;P

So as if our Sauiour in the text did either neceſſarily, (in regard of our weakenes) or briefly, or ſignificantly, or (as departers vſe to ſpeake) pathetically, or (as founders take leaue to ſpeake) peculiarly, call that His body, which he meant for a pledge; or earneſt ſeale, ſigne, token, commemoration, celebration, exhibition conueyance, deed and ſta

when the Sunneſhines) then to goe into the yard for it, is but a gadding diſpoſition, and which loues rather to gaze about then to take paines, rather ſlouthfull to behold the light then to make right vſe of it: the beſt light alſo for man to worke by either in things heauenly or terrene, beeing the temperate and ſhadowed light; that which is ſo open and glaring beeing a dazler and confounder, and which who ſo vſeth himſelfe vnto, may happe in the ende to be depriued of the light he hath, and be driuen to ſeeke out of himſelfe to bee reſolued in moſt palpable things. A notable example whereof our Aduerſaries haue made them

window of our Sauiours words lets in [Doe this in remembrance of me,
               Luk. 22.19.] but muſt needs be rouing and ranging abroad, paſſing and compaſſing ſeas and lands, toſſing and ranſaking all manner of writings whereby to find in this His Bodie, an other manner of matter then a remembrance; it is now at length befallen them, partly beeing confounded in their imaginations, and partly beeing peruerted in their iudgements (thorough a skorne to bee content wit a home-growing truth after ſo great trauells) that now they cannot perceiue a difference betwixt His remembrance, and His very reall preſence; betwixt the ſigne, and the thing; the ſhell, and the kernell; the ſhadow, and the ſubſtance: whereby finally by the

iuſt iudgement of God, who ſuffreth men to beleeue lies which will not obey the truth, they haue not onely loſt the ſubſtance by catching at the ſhadowe, with the dogge in the fable; not onely ſmothered and ouerwhelmed the Sacrament, by houering and doting vpon the outward element, as children with hugging and dandling choake their birds; but alſo by conferring vpon it the ſame incompetible reſpects which their forefathers did vpon the brazen ſerpent, they haue in the end peruerted it vnto the like abhomination: and in ſtead of a faithfull remembrancer of Gods infinite loue vnto man, erected vnto themſelues a moſt execrable fore-ſtaller of their hearts and deuotions vnto God, and ſo ſet

vp the moſt pernicious Idoll that euer was. Which, Chriſtian Reader, that you may more plainly acknowledge, do but a while draw neere, and as it were from the toppe of a peere with me, behold what a taile of moſt fowle, ſtupendious, and impious, or rather blaſphemous conſequents it drawes after it: that ſo you may, as ex vngue leonem, ſo alſo ex cauda draconem cognoſcere, and accordingly abominari. For vpon their expounding This, in the text, to become His bodie and perſon indeed; both body, ſoule, and diuinity, (as the Councell of Trent decreeth) really,
               Concil. Trid. leſſ. 2. Can. 3. &amp; can. 1. 
               verily, and ſubſtantially (for els they agree with vs;) iudge whether theſe Concluſions following doe not ſpawne and iſſue; as, Firſt,
            
               That the Mediator beeing  for euer returned vnto the ſtate of glorification; does notwithſtanding ordinarily take vpon Him a forme, farre inferiour vnto the forme of His humiliation; as farre as the forme of a loafe or cake of bread, is inferiour vnto the forme of a perfect man.
            That when he meanes to be  adored, and bodily bowed down vnto; then eſpecially He takes vpon him this breaden forme.
            That when He meanes to be  adored in a breaden forme, He does not create, effigiat, or contract the ſame, as the holy Ghoſt did the forme of a doue (to point out vnto Iohn Baptiſt who was the Chriſt:) but wil take the forme of that bread which a little before the baker

had made, and which, for ought can be perceiued, ſtill is the ſame.
            
                That he which will be exalted among the heathen, and will be exalted vpon the earth: (Pſal. 46.10.) yet will in the Heathens eyes become more meane then the meaneſt worme, and at leaſt ſeeme to them no better then a peice of bread.
            
                That He which derideth the Idols of the Heathen, for that they can neieher ſpeake, nor ſtirre, nor ſaue themſelues out of captiuity, (Iſa. 42.2.) does notwithſtanding preſent Himſelfe in ſuch a forme to be worſhipped, which euery liuing thing can make a prey of.
            
                That the breaden forme wherein he wil be adored, does there enter, where (Himſelfe hath ſaid it, Matt. 15.17.) whatſoeuer

entreth is caſt forth into the draught.
            
            That He vnto whome it was  an infinite abaſement, but once to paſſe through the pureſt wombe; does notwithſtanding in His higheſt glory, make His ordinary paſſage through impure mouthes.
            That He is incomparably  more preſent in the mouthes of men, then in the hearts of men: as much as the Sunne is more preſent in his ſphere, then in the eye of the beholder.
            That as oft as this Body is  rightly adminiſtred, ſo oft there doe concurre many miracles; as amongſt others theſe following: 1. An vtter extinquiſhing and nullifying, or new informing the ſubſtance of the elements: 2. a retaining the accidents after ſuch ſubſtance be

departed, or new informed: 3. An inueſting thoſe acccidents or breaden ſubſtances, with the perfect bodie of man: 4. The ſo qualifying that body, both for ſhape, quantitie, and properties, as that it cannot bee outwardly diſcerned from a morſell of bread: 5. That body to be ſubdued vnto the iawes and digeſtions of the receiuer, without hauing a bone broken: 6. That the humane bodie which thus is eaten, is alwayes in the heauens notwithſtanding: 7. That there beeing but one bodie for all the world, yet ſhall euery true beleeuer, wholly eat that particular bodie ſubſtantially: 8. That the appearance of all theſe miracles, is with-holden from ſenſe &amp; reaſon: 9. That as many ſeuerall adminiſtrations, ſo many ſeuerall

performances there are of all theſe miracles: 10. Finally, that the Apoſtles, and their ſucceſſors for euer, were indued with this diuinitie of power, to cauſe all theſe foreſaid miracles as oft as they ſhall thinke good, vnto the end of the world.
            That He which hath ſo done  His maruelous acts, as that they ought to bee had in remembrance, (Pſal. 111.) Hee which will haue His works conſidered to the verie ſparkes: (Eccl. 42.) And He whoſe works doe not hinder one another: (Eccl. 16.26.) is not with ſtanding the author of all thoſe inglorious, obſcure, and ſelfe-confounding miracles.
            That all theſe ſo ſtrange, intricate, and (to forbeare the qualitie of them) ſo ſtupendious, operatious, and conditions, the Mediatour does ordinarily

vndergoe and performe, for no neceſſity of man, but this; namely, to aſſure men of His incarnation, and ſuffering for them.
            
                That the meanes of Faith are more hard to brooke, then the Faith it ſelfe: as much as it is more hard to beleeue, that the Sonne of God does vſually take vpon Him the forme of a peice of bread for me, then to beleeue, that once He took the forme of a reaſonable man for me.
            
                That miracles are ordinarily afforded to confirme that faith, which had nothing but heating to beget it.
            
                That greater miracles are ordinarily afforded to confirme faith, then euer were afforded vnto the firſt conuerſion of any whomſoeuer vnto the faith.
            
                That whereas ſuch as will

not beleeue Moſes &amp; the Prophets, (Luk. 16.31.) will neither beleeue the greateſt miracle: yet not withſtanding muſt they which haue Moſes, and the Prophets, and the Goſpel continually publiſhed amongſt them, notwithſtanding expect a continual courſe of the greateſt miracles, toward onely the confirming their beleefe.
            That He which will not ſaue  them that goe to ſea, but by means, becauſe He will not haue the workes of His wiſedome to be idle: (Wiſ. 14.5.) will notwithſtanding vſe incredible miracles towards the producing that effect (the ſtrengthning of faith,) which both, doth looſe the grace the more it is ſupported by miracles, and alſo hath a ſpeciall meanes ordained of God, for the breeding and furthering of

it, namely, publike preaching: and finally, the al-ſufficient and moſt neceſſarie operation of the holy Ghoſt, promiſed and aſſigned thereunto.
            
                That whereas planting and watering are one, (1. Cor. 3.8.) begetting and preſeruing (as generation and nutrition) proceeding of the ſame cauſes: yet are ſuch kind of miracles to bee expected, for the confirming and ſtrengthening faith, which are not able in the leaſt meaſure to beget faith: nothing beeing of force to conuert outwardly an vnbeleeuer vnto the faith, but that which the light of nature (beyond which his capacitie cannot reach) can entertaine; whereunto theſe ſuppoſed miracles are moſt repugnant.
            
                That planting and watering
               
beeing one; and of the two, planting beeing the more noble: yet muſt the Redeemer in His owne perſon water, whom by His miniſters He daily planteth.
            That the Sunne in the firmament  ſo abundantly inlightning and refreſhing all creatures here below, by meanes of ordinarie beames without any corporall deſcending; yet muſt the Sonne of Righteouſneſſe, ſo infinitely ſurpaſſing that creature in glorie, brightneſſe, ſtate, and vertue, notwithſtanding corporally and perſonally deſcend (were it no more) for the onely inlightening and refreſhing His vineyard and plantation.
            That whereas Kings and  Princes vpon earth haue this prerogatiue, to indow and poſſeſſe

whome they thinke good with dignities and benefits, by the meanes of a Patent, or a Seale, without ſtirring a foote further: yet the King of Kings hauing giuen His Patents and Seales, His Couenants and Teſtaments, yea Himſelfe once, &amp; Sacraments ordinarily, with His grace continually, muſt notwithſtanding come Himſelfe in perſon, or elſe His gift muſt be of no force.
            
                That farre harder burthens are laid vpon the weakeſt vnder the Goſpel, then. vpon the ſtrongeſt vnder the Law, namely, to beleeue and expect thoſe performances, which are farre leſſe expectable at the hands of God, then (the pitch of the ſtrongeſt faith) the remoouing of mountaines.
            
                That Hee which will not

               bruiſe a broken reed, (Eſa. 42.2.) but will ſo tenderly handle and foſter it, as ſhall make it growe together againe; does notwithſtanding deale ſo extreamely with His littleſt ones, as vnleſſe they can beleeue that to bee their Sauiour, which all the world would take to be a morſell of bread, they muſt looke for no ſaluation.
            That whereas the ſtrong beleeuer  
               Moſes, did doubt whether water would follow vpon his ſtriking the rocke, (Numb. 20.10.) though God had expreſſely promiſed as much, and was readie to effect it: whereas alſo that vertuous Sarah, and the bleſſed Marie did likewiſe make queſtion how thoſe miraculous conceptions could betide them, which Angels from heauen did ſenſibly and expreſly

promiſe them: yet notwithſtanding muſt it be expected at the hands of the weakeſt beleeuers, (when they ſhall ſee that which is confeſſed, and muſt be acknowledged for ordinarie bread) that they preſently vpon the ſpeaking two or three words, beleeue vpon paine of damnation, that it is out-right become their very God: and that without hauing more motiues ſo to beleeue, then they haue to beleeue, a rocke, a lyon, a lambe, or &amp;c. (by which names He is as expreſſely called, as euer He was by the name of this bread) to be their God.
            
                That He which appeared ſo glorious, and ſo wonderfull, when He ſhewed but a little of Himſelfe vnto ſome of his ſeruants (Moſes and Elias) and that but ſeuerally; yet when He

meanes to make His perſonall approach vnto His Spouſe, the Church, He then on the contrary puts off all His glorious apparell; and without ſo much as a meſſenger going before Him, without any noiſe, either of a wind, as at the deſcending of the Holy Ghoſt, or of a voice, loud, or ſoft, to giue notice of His comming, Hee alwaies exhibites Himſelfe vnto her, thus contrarie to Himſelfe, in the common, ſenſleſſe, and ſilly forme of belly-bread, made a little before of the Baker, and (a ſtrong motiue vnto the Church, no doubt, to put all her confidence in Him) which euery worme can ouer-maſter.
            That He which in Scripture  ordinarily conuinceth men of Idolatrie, onely vpon this, becauſe

they worſhip that, which their common ſenſe can tell them is a ſenſles creature: does not with ſtanding ordinarily preſent Himſelfe to bee worſhipped in that forme which common ſenſe does generally tell vs is a ſenſleſſe creature.
            
                That the euidence which our Sauiour produceth to prooue Himſelfe to be riſen from the dead, (handle me, and ſee me, &amp;c. Luk. 24.) is not ſufficient to prooue, whether that which men handle, ſee, and taſt, bee a peice of bread.
            
                That the only powers wherby mankind is able to diſcerne a man from a beaſt, whereby to auoid killing; a wife from a ſtranger, whereby to auoid fornication; our owne from an others, whereby to auoid ſtealing; the hungry from the full,

wherby to practiſe charity, &amp;c. are notwithſtanding generally, either ſo weake, or ſo falſe, as that certainely they cannot diſcerne a morſell of bread from the body of a man, a common creature from the Creator.
            Finally, (to ranſacke this  denne of darkenes no further) That wheras the Lord thought it ſo great an indulgence vnto His moſt faithfull ſeruant Ioſuah, when He cauſed the Sunne for a ſeaſon to ſtand ſtill at his prayer, as that He decreed neuer ſo againe to heare the voice of a man, (Ioſuah, 10.14.) yet notwithſtanding ſince that decree, He hath bound Himſelfe that at the voice, not of one man, but multitudes of men continually ſucceeding, ſhould bee cauſed, not a creature but the Creator, not to ſtay awhile

in the heauens as that planet did, or as Himſelfe did when He was beheld of Steuen at his Martyrdome, but to leaue His throane, (His glory at leaſt) and then to deſcend in ſuch manner and forme, as (did not the neceſſity of our confutation driue vs vnto it) were not once to be named.
            Theſe conſequents, Reader, how truly they follow vpon the expoſition in queſtion, for breuity ſake we leaue to your ſelfe: onely this you know, that if but one of them all did truly follow (beeing falſe) it is enough to cōuince the principle it ſelfe to be according. But if they all, or moſt of them, doe both truely follow, and alſo are moſt falſe, vile, monſtrous, and abominable; then if you can diſcerne a lyon by his nayle, iudge

this opinion to be a monſter by his tayle of abominations trayling after it: yea ſay if it be not of the very breed of that Red dragon,
               Apoc. 12.4. 
               which with his taile drew the third part of the ſtars, &amp; caſt them to the earth: for ſurely had it ſtrength to his length, what would it elſe but reach vp to the heauens, and wreſtle with the ſtarres, yea faſten vpon the throne of the higheſt? Or ſay if that Beaſt could haue more names of blaſphemy vpon his head then this hath?Apoc. 13. For if it be Aquin. 2.2. q. 3. a. 3. c. Blaſphemy to attribute any thing vnto God, which is not conuenient; then what ſhall it be to attribute that vnto Him which is as deſpightfull and reproachfull as can be imagined? For what meant Moſes when he tooke that golden calfe, and beating it to powder, made

the Idolaters drinke of it? what was his meaning? was it to doe a honour vnto the Idoll, or to ingraine the people in Idolatry? was it not in his vtmoſt hate and deteſtation of the Idoll, and to ſhewe the people how that which they had made their god, was not able to ſaue it ſelfe out of the filthy gutter? Could there then be imagined a more abominable reproach againſt the higheſt, then once to imagine the like manner of receiuing Him? Or does their adoring Him, as they pretend, before they thus receiue Him, helpe the matter? So did the ſouldiers firſt crie, haile King, before they ſpit on Him; ſo did Iudas firſt kiſſe Him, before he betraied Him; and ſo their firſt (like) adoring Him, and (then with their good wills) eating

and ſwallowing Him vp; what

                it elſe but ſo much the more

of a peculiar nature; for that It could walke vpon the water, could vaniſh out of ſight, and is a glorified body: as if alſo the body of Peter did not (by the like miraculous ſuſpenſion) walke vpon the water? as likewiſe Philip vaniſhed out of ſight; or as if glorification did take away the bodily nature; or that He ſpake not of His body before it was glorified? But principally and with moſt fell violence let them crie, out vpon all arguing and reaſoning in this buſines. And withall let them alleadge, how, God ſees not as man ſees, nor is affectable as man is; that He often thinkes that precious, which man thinkes vile; He could paſſe through the wombe of a woman without defilement, &amp;c. but aboue all, let them neuer forget to tell vs of Gods Omnipotence,
               
and that we infinitely robbe the ſame, by denying theſe their monſtrous ſuppoſes, as if there were any thing impoſſible with Him? And thereupon finally let them glory in the ſtrength of their owne Faith, for that, it is ſo ſtrong (numbd, ſeared, and ſenſeleſſe indeed) as that with eaſe they can beleeue, that which their aduerſaries are afraid once to imagine. And then laſt of all, let them cloſe vp all with this pleaſing conceit, that ſurely their opinion is inuincible: for why? becauſe (no doubt) it is builded vpon a rocke; yea the moſt high and mighty Rocke, the omnipotence of God. But, a laſſe, poore, miſerable, abominable fooles! For if he be a foole that builds (though neuer ſo good ſtuffe) vpon a ſandy foundation; then

how abominably fooliſh is he, that builds moſt rotten and moſt vile ſtuffe, vpon the moſt precious foundation? As if cob-webs were any whit the ſtronger for beeing built in pallaces? ſhall they not ſo much the ſooner be ſwept away? ſo this their like planting ſuch ſpider-like, abominable ſtuffe thus at the right hand of God, ſo farre ſhall it bee from getting ſtrength thereby, as that from thence it ſhall receiue moſt terrible confuſion. The power of God, who denies it, yea wee glory in it that it is omnipotent: all things are poſſible vnto Him; we know it: Scripture teacheth it: namely, ſo far forth as they carrie an honour in the performance. For elſe, why ſaies an other Scripture, it is impoſſible that God ſhould lie? but to

ſhew vs, that no kind of diſhonourable actions (whereof lying is one) may bee aſcribed vnto Him: All power alſo to diſgrace, diminiſh, or deſtroy (finally) either it ſelfe or other, beeing impotence and vnſtaiedneſſe. Before therefore they had preſumed to affirme that God can doe ſo, or ſo; they ſhould firſt with feare and reuerence, haue conſidered whether it might ſtand with His glorie, ſo, or ſo, to worke. For that His power does neuer worke outwardly to the creature-ward, but as it is firſt beckned vnto, and cited by His glory: that beeing the ground and ſquare of all power and poſſibility whatſoeuer: euen the power of ſinne beeing grounded hereupon, becauſe the glory of God is aduanced by ſubduing

ſinne: All ſayings, finally, interpretations, and expoſitions whatſoeuer, beeing no further allowable, but ſo farre forth as they make for, or at leaſt may ſtand with, This diuine Glory. The Church therefore interpreting thoſe tearmes of Face, Eyes, Hands, Armes, Wings, Foote, &amp;c. to be attributed vnto God improperly, and by way of His gracious condiſcending vnto, and ſympathizing with mans nature; becauſe beeing litterally taken, they are derogatory vnto His eternall glory, whereunto ſimplicity and vniformitie is of abſolute neceſſity. Are then thy ſuppoſes diſhonourable vnto God? So far then is the Omnipotence from effecting them, or yeelding vnto them the leaſt poſſibility of proceeding from Him, as that

infinitely it barres, repells and abhorres them. True indeed, time was, and wee bleſſe the time, when He tooke contempt vpon Him; (ſo loued He the world, mans miſery otherwiſe beeing endleſſe;) but what of that? is therefore honour and diſhonour vnto Him all one? He paſſed through the wombe of a woman without defilement; true: but was it without abaſement? where then is the merit thereof?Pſal. 123 5. Or he that humbleth Himſelfe, in that He does behold the things done in heauen and earth; did He not infinitely more humble Himſelfe in deſcending into the heart of the earth? Or becauſe alſo He was ſcourged and crucified without any defilement, ſhall that alſo be counted all one vnto Him, that ſo thou mayeſt crucifie

Him, yea drinke His heart blood againe and againe? We grant alſo that as He is pure God, He is not onely vnpollutable, but alſo vnaffectable with mans actions. But ſhall man therefore be careleſſe of his actions? The blaſphemies of wicked men do no way hurt, or come nigh Him; ſhall it therefore be lawfull to blaſpheame? If thou ſinneſt (ſaith Iob) what doeſt thou againſt Him:
               Iob 35.6. 
               or if thou be righteous, what giueſt thou vnto Him? wilt thou therefore be indifferent whether thou ſinneſt or not, whether thou does well or not? Hee ſees not as man ſees; well: His Eternall and incomprehenſible nature indeed, ſees all things in a moment, and without obſeruing time, place, or circumſtance: But as He hath ſet

Himſelfe in reference and aſpect vnto his creature, eſpecially that creature whoſe nature He hath aſſumed, He now hath determined to ſee, though not peruerſly as wicked men, nor ſhallowly as all men, yet by thoſe courſes and formes of conceiuing, which he hath ingrained His creature withall: And therefore now forbeares not to ſay,Gen. 18.21. 
               I will goe downe, and ſee whether they haue done according to their crie, and if not, I will knowe: yea, now He will be affected with his creature, will be angred and pleaſed with it, will accept honour and euen outward reſpects from it: the holy Baptiſt therfore profeſſing himſelfe not worthy to vntie the latchet of his ſhooes; and the good Centurion eſteeming him too great to enter the roofe of his

houſe: yea now He calls for the bending of euery knee, and the falling downe before His footeſtoole, with all poſſible praiſe, honour, and glorie. Remember therefore, O preſumptuous man, (wormes meate, duſt, and aſhes,) remember, that His reuealed Law, not his incomprehenſible nature, muſt bee thy ſquare and gouernour. His law bids thee euery where aſcribe vnto Him all glorie, praiſe, power, and dominion; giue Him therefore that He cals for: and ſeeing He calls for honour, ſee thou offereſt nothing vnto Him, but that which, at leaſt, thou thinkeſt to be moſt excellent, and moſt honourable: and whatſoeuer thou wouldeſt eſteeme vile, inglorious, or contumelious, if it were offered vnto thy ſelfe, ſo farre muſt thou

be from offring that vnto Him, or ſuppoſing it by Him, as thou wouldeſt be from blaſpheming. Thou reacheſt foorth thy hand in loue or fauour vnto ſome man; he biteth it, or puts it in his mouth; does hee honour thee in ſo doing? or if thou takeſt ſuch vſage for a fowle indignitie, wilt thou offer the like vnto Him, vnto whome thou oweſt all honour, feare, dread, and reuerence vnto? Or belike when Hee ſo calls for honour, glorie, maieſtie, &amp;c. Hee meanes ſome other matter, or retaines ſome ſpeciall notion vnder thoſe words, which man neuer meant? As if God ſpeakes vnto vs in any other language but our owne? or when He forbids murther, adulterie, ſtealing, &amp;c. He meanes any thing elſe by

ſuch words, but as man (the maker of words, as God is the maker of all things) intended them to ſignifie? Then know, O peruerſe man, that when he generally calls for honour, glorie, maieſtie, wiſedome, iuſtice, &amp;c. to be aſcribed vnto Him, Hee meanes nothing elſe but thoſe reſpects and offices (ſaue onely in the higheſt degree) which man that made thoſe words did firſt meane to vnderſtand by ſuch words; vnleſſe thou meaneſt to make His word of no effect, yea a very ſnare and intanglement vnto vs, and to ſpeake by contraries, and ſo to blaſpheme it as thou doeſt his Omnipotence. But finally, were it ſo that theſe ſuppoſes did not indeed diſhonour God, and ſo conſequently might be allowed amongſt things not impoſſible;

muſt they therefore of neceſſitie be beleeued? becauſe dooms day may be to morrowe, muſt it needs therefore ſo befal? God can raiſe children out of ſtones, and humane bodies out of morſells of bread; muſt it therefore ſo be expected? does poſſibility impoſe neceſſitie? to what purpoſe then is there ſo great labour to prooue a poſſibilitie of theſe things, which both they are infinitely ſhut from, and alſo were it graunted them, they are neuer the nearer. As little does it helpe them, but more and more condemne them, when they challenge all argument, and renounce all kind of euidence which either ſenſe or reaſon offreth in this cauſe. For are not Senſe &amp; Reaſon the very ordinance of God, imprinted in mans nature when it was

moſt perfect? yea, in the eſtate we now are in, are they not the onely meanes whereby wee are both capable of His will, ſtand liable vnto his lawes, and tractable to His purpoſes? Does not euery word of God preſuppoſe at leaſt a reaſonable vnderſtanding, being otherwiſe as commendable vnto the beaſt? yea, when the Lord meanes moſt palpably to conuince men, does He not referre them to their ſenſes? Are not not all His expoſtulations &amp; meſſages whatſoeuer, directed vnto the conſcience, whoſe ground is Senſe and Science?Luk. 24 39. does He not ſend the vnbeleeuer to his touch,1. Cor. 11.14. to feele the truth of his reſurrection? the Ruffian to the light of nature, to ſee the deformitie of long haire? and the hypocrite to the common opinion, to ſee

the madneſſe of ſpeaking in an vnknowne tongue?1. Cor. 14 23. yea, does He not euerie where conuince men of the greateſt ſinne, euen of Idolatrie, onely by this; becauſe they worſhip that which their common Senſe could tell them was a ſenſleſſe creature? whereas if the power of common ſenſe bee ſo blind, or ſo weake, or ſo falſe, as that it cannot certainely ſay, whether the thing it ſees, handle, and taſteth bee a morſell of bread or not; how ſhall it be able to ſay, whether that which it worſhippeth be a ſtone or not, yea and that ſo infallibly, as that the worſhipper thereof ſhall bee condemned, by the ſentence of the moſt vpright Iudge, to be an Idolater thereupon? For may not the Idolater iuſtly plead, that howſoeuer his common

Senſe told him it was a ſtocke, or a ſtone, yet might it indeede bee very God, as well as that which common ſenſe affirmeth to be a morſell of bread, is notwithſtanding very God? And if it be replyed vpon him, that he might haue found Scripture to warrant the perſon of God in the appearance of bread; may he not readily anſwer againe, that there is as much Scripture to warrant the perſon of God in the appearance of a ſtone, for that the ſame Scripture calleth as expreſly the ſame God by the name of a ſtone, and a rocke, whereof for ought hee knowes, his God may bee a peice? And thus by the diſabling the iudgement of common ſenſe, ſhall the Idolater be furniſhed with a faire excuſe; and may in the ende be iuſtified

for taking a tree,
               Iſa. 8.17. 
               and making a fire to warme himſelfe with one part, does make a god of the other: as wel as they which of the ſame dough fill their bellies with one part, and then fall downe in adoration before the other. So as this renouncing of common Senſe, what is it but to cut in ſunder the ſtrings of Gods prouidence (wherewith hee leads men in and out before Him, like a flocke of ſheep,) and flatly to peruert the rule, and blaſpheme the proceedings of His Iuſtice? True indeed, the Scripture often tells vs, that humane wiſedome and vnderſtanding is vanitie, fooliſhnes, yea, enmity with God; partly becauſe the wiſedome of moſt men is fooliſhneſſe indeed, and partly becauſe in compariſon with Gods wiſedome, the beſt

is but fooliſhneſſe: but principally, becauſe vnder the dominion of vnbeleefe, malice, and concupiſcence, it is abuſed, peruerted, and made enmity with God, as a weapon in the hand of a rebell becomes enmity againſt his Prince: But ſhall we therefore from theſelike reſpectiue, comparatiue, and abuſiue ſpeeches, proceed abſolutely to fruſtrate and diſanull the faculties themſelues? Becauſe the corruption of nature muſt be wrought out, muſt therefore nature it ſelfe be deſtroyed? Or becauſe the light of nature muſt be ſubiect vnto the Faith (and ſo is a Prince to his Phyſitian, or Pilot, in their elements) ſhall therefore the faith cleane put out the light of nature? does ruling ouer ſubiects conſiſt in deſtroying ſubiects?

cannot my beaſt be ſubiect vnto me, vnleſſe it falls downe vnder me? or becauſe the Eye cannot heare, ſhall therefore the Eare put out the eye? So becauſe ſenſe and reaſon cannot lay hold of future things, ſhall therefore the Faith deny their iudgement in preſent things? yea take away theſe reaſonable powers, and what ſhall become of the Faith? can it be ingrafted into the beaſt? For as the naturall man is the wild oliue, vntill he ſhoots into the true vine; ſo is the faith without effect, and muſt rerurne to Him that gaue it, vnleſſe it finds a reaſonable (though a wild) ſtocke to receiue it, and finde materialls vnto it, Or againe, how ſhall an infidell be conuerted (though in the act of conuerſion theſe naturall

faculties moſt of all muſt be reſtrained) if Senſe and reaſon be thus wholly laid aſide? For the onely meanes which Grace vſeth vnto mans conuerſion, being preaching and miracles: take away Senſe, and what ſhall become of preaching? how ſhall we heare, or how ſhall we read? So againe take away reaſon, and what ſhall become of miracles? how ſhal they mooue admiration and aſtoniſhment, or get acknowledgement? In ſo much as it might bee a ſhort deciſion of this whole cauſe, to retort their argument, and ſay; Common Senſe does acknowledge no ſubſtantiall change in this bread, nor any manner of miracle whatſoeuer; therefore no ſuch matter in this buſineſſe may bee ſuppoſed. For all the miracles that euer we read of,

not onely were acknowledged by theſe naturall faculties, but alſo were immediately directed vnto them, whereby to be conuaied vnto the heart of the natural man, toward his conuiction or conuerſion. For the firſt intent of all miracles beeing to conuince vnbeleefe; either in whole, as in the vnbeleeuer, or in part, as in the weake beleeuer: As for the vnbeleeuer; nothing can poſſibly come at him but that which this naturall light (beyond which he hath no capacity) can entertaine: and as for the weake beleeuer; conſidering that weakeneſſe of faith is (in degree) a want of faith, neither againe can he be outwardly wrought vpon toward the remoouing that his weakenes, but by thoſe manner of meanes which can in ſome

meaſure worke vpon vnbeleefe it ſelfe. So as thoſe manner of miracles which this outward light of nature cannot acknowledge, muſt needs be as vaine (and therefore not of Gods working,) as to point out the way to a traueller, and then to put out his eyes: the proper intent of all miracles beeing this; outwardly to point vnto that ſupernaturall power, which inwardly Grace onely does reueale. True indeed if the light of Grace does affirme or reueale any thing which this light of nature cānot conceiue, or does contrary, there muſt it be ſuſpended and renounced: but no ſuch matter is there in the preſent buſineſſe. For neither does the Scripture, nor (Scriptures expoſitour) the Church (the onely windowes

of the light of Grace) affirme any ſubſtantiall change, any miracle, any con-or tranſubſtantiation whatſoeuer to be wrought at this time. For firſt concerning Scripture; where does that affirme or import any ſuch matters? That He tooke, brake, bleſſed, and gaue bread, &amp;c. all the reports of the firſt inſtitution doe auouch: but that this bread was conuerted, changed, or any way in the nature thereof altred, but as all other bread is by the force of naturall digeſtion, no Scripture makes any the leaſt mention. It ſaith, This is my body; true: and who ſaies otherwiſe? but what meant He? when He called Peter a ſtone did he meane to turne him into a ſtone, as He did the vnbeleeuer into a pillar of ſalt? He called alſo Herode a fox, Iudas a

deuill, and the Phariſies vipers; Himſelfe alſo is vſually called a

               yon, lamb, ſtone, rocke, &amp;c. 
                  •
               s we haue noted; cannot theſe ſayings bee true, vnleſſe they prooue ſo indeed? If then the words may haue an other mea
               
                  •
               ing, and that by the law both of common and diuine formes of

                  •
                was the intent of this our Sau
                  •
               
               ours Ordinance? If it was fo
                  •
                His remembrance; we know that the remembrance of a thing is not onely poſſibl
                  •
                without the preſence of it, bu
                  •
                alſo does neceſſarily imply th

                abſence of it, and no way po

               ſibly can bee one and the ſam
                  •
                with it. So farre alſo is the remembrance of a thing from requiring any ſubſtantial change as that the more ſtable the elements and tokens are, ſo much the more firme and conſtan
                  •
                remembrance ſhall bee cauſe
                  •
                thereby. Secondly, if our Sauiours intent in this His ordinance was not onely for His remembrance, (though to ſay

more, what is it but to adde vnto His owne words,) but alſo to giue the receiuers a full and reall poſſeſſion of Him and all His benefits: yet alſo may ſuch a purpoſe be effected, not onely without any compounding or changing of natures, or this reall preſence, but alſo without theſe elements or Sacraments at al; namely, by the publication of the Goſpell, wherein theſe benefits and all manner of promiſes, are moſt immediately tendred vnto the faith of the hearer.Hierom. in Pſal. 147. In which reſpect one of the Fathers forbeares not to ſay, I take the Goſpell to be the Body of Chriſt, and that more truely then the Sacrament: as alſo an other;Greg. Niſſ. in vit. Moſ. 
               Who ſo hath abundantly drunke of the Apoſtles ſprings, hath alreadie receiued whole Christ: and a third,Tertul. de reſur. 
               The word made fleſh, muſt be deuoured

with hearing, chewed with vnderſtanding, and digeſted by beleeuing. Thirdly, if our Sauiours intent was not onely to refreſh His remembrance vnto vs, or to giue vs a full poſſeſſion of Him, but alſo to giue vs State and Seſne of ſuch poſſeſſion; yet neither hereunto is either His Reall preſence, or theſe miraculous ſuppoſes any way requiſite: no more then they bee requiſite vnto the ſame intent in the other Sacrament of Baptiſme. Fourthly, if the intent of this our Sauiours ordinance be, not ſo much for our ſpirituall partaking Him (which is the worke of faith alone,) nor againe onely for our viſible partaking Him, (which is the intent of euery Sacrament,) but further that we may mutually and ioyntly ſo partake Him,

which is the moſt proper in

                  •
                Sonne of God was once made

man for him, let him be taught for a preparatiue to beleeue, that hee thus daily takes the forme of a peice of bread for him; and ſo not only the means ſhall prooue incomparably more hard to brooke, then the end, moſt prepoſterouſly, but alſo that which was intended to comfort, or (ſuppoſe) to exerciſe the weake faith, ſhall ouerwhelme and breake the backe of the ſtrongeſt faith: though (who knowes not) the intent of this Sacrament is to refreſh and nouriſh, not to exerciſe the faith; and that the way thereunto ſhould be by ſupplying new ſtrength, and producing more plaine euidence; not by increaſing the burthen, and further perplexing the Senſes. Laſt of all, what intent or benefit can there be imagined for

the behoofe of man, which our Sauiour cannot effect vnto vs without his bodily preſence? yea, the leaſt miracle that euer we read of, and whereunto the Omnipotence of God did leaſt of all deſcend, were it but the ſofteſt voice, or the reaching forth of a hand, &amp;c. would it not far more mooue and worke vpon the hearts of men, (were miracles now to be expected,) then this all-ſurpaſſing Reall-preſence, and moſt ſtupendious concurring operations? Wee conclude then, that no poſſible or imaginable intent of this our Sauiours Ordinance, does take any the leaſt furtherance by theſe manner of ſuppoſes, but rather is vtterly oppreſſed and confounded thereby. For whereas the principall intent thereof, is to put vs in minde,

that He tooke the forme of a man for vs: what doe theſe ſuppoſes, but teach the flat contrarie, namely, that Hee hath left the forme of a man, and hath betaken vnto Him the forme of common bread; yea, not onely the intent of this Sacrament, but euen the foundation of the Chriſtian faith is diſtempered; and (as much as in man lyes) ouerturned hereby. For if Hee that is a perfect man, ſeemes to be a morſell of bread; if Hee ſeemes to be bodily eaten, and ſeemes to be chewed with the teeth, when indeed Hee is neither ſo eaten, chewed, or any way touched: ſhall not men hereby learne to imagine, that likewiſe when He was here vpon earth, He might ſeeme to be a man, and yet was not; ſeemed to bleed, ſuffer, and die, and

yet indeed did not; and ſo the life and power of our Saluation to come to nothing? If then neither the words of our Sauiour, nor any imaginable meaning of them doe inforce this Reall-preſence, where is the Scripture that muſt make vs put out our eyes, and renounce all our wits for gain-ſaying it? or that Scripture which tells vs that wee muſt eate His fleſh, &amp;c. does it of neceſſitie bind vs to beleeue, that here it is in the forme of bread? as if the true eating of this fleſh indeed, did not conſiſt in our onely beleeuing on Him, and that before euer we taſt of this Sacrament? Or muſt we ſuppoſe, that though no Scriptures expreſly affirme theſe things, yet by inference or circumſtance they may imply as much? yea rather

the cleane contrary: For had our Sauiour intended, that this His Ordinance ſhould bee accompanied with theſe ſo vncouth and incredible operations, together with ſuch deformitie of His preſence, would he not haue giuen moſt expreſſe intelligence and warning thereof at the firſt inſtitution? would He haue giuen them no expectation of ſuch wonders toward? no caueat to heare with the right eare, and ſee with a ſingle eie, as alwaies in matters of more importance then appearance, He vſed to quicken His hearers withall? yea, had the Diſciples ſuppoſed any ſuch wonders, would they haue bin ſo ſilent, without ſo much as asking, how can theſe things be? or they which were ſo apt to make queſtions, and difficulties, and

to wonder at his ordinary miracles;Luk. 5.9. yea, to be ſo aſtoniſhed at a ſtrange draught of fiſhes, could they let paſſe this maſſe of miracles vnregarded? Or if they ſo eaſily ſwallowed all theſe things, how was it that by and by after, when our Sauiour did but ſay,Ioh. 16.1
                     •
                  . 
               Yet a little while, and ye ſhall not ſee me; and a little while and ye ſhall ſee me, &amp;c. they were ſo troubled, as that they profeſſed they knewe not what Hee ſaid? could they conceiue immediately before, how Hee could be here and there, and euery where, in all the corners of the earth bodily preſent, and at the ſame time, and yet now could not vnderſtand, how a little while they ſhould ſee Him, and a little while not ſee Him: and that when he told them that He went to the Father? Or muſt wee

ſuppoſe that the Diſciples were ſo fully reſolued of our Sauiours deity, as that therfore at this ſupper they made no maruell at any thing which He ſaid or did. But had it been ſo, they would neuer ſo haue forſaken Him preſently after ſupper, and runne away from Him, neither would they ſo ſlenderly haue beleeued His reſurrection, as to thinke it an idle tale,
               Luk 24 11. when it was firſt reported; eſpecially beeing a thing farre more credible, and farre more becomming the Almighty (then the moſt tolerable amongſt theſe ſuppoſes,) and whereof He had often forewarned them, and ſhewed many experiments of his power therein. But be it ſo, that the Apoſtles were ſo paſt all maruelling at our Sauiours workes: yet could they

be ſo vnmindfull of the weake beleefe, which future times are more and more ſubiect vnto, as in their Epiſtles and Goſpells to leaue no mention of theſe wonders, concurring at euery Sacrament, and beeing of ſuch neceſſitie to be beleeued? which alſo had they with many repetitions and inculcations put poſterity in mind of, yea euen inſerted into their Creed, yet all would haue been little enough to haue procured vnto it the meaneſt degree of vnfained beleefe. Or againe, how is it that they ſo often rehearſe in the Goſpells the other miracles, and yet will not vouchſafe any of theſe once the naming? was His turning water into wine ſo memorable, and yet His turning a morſell of bread into the perfect body of a man, or making

them both one (which is worſe) not worth the ſpeaking of? Could His multiplying loaues be more wonderfull, then this multiplying humane bodies? or was his tranſfiguration on the mount more meruailous, then this His transformation, or, tranſubſtantiation, if it were not counterfeit? Or was the Apoſtles power ouer Scorpions and ſerpents more worthy to be recorded, then this incomparably exceeding (ſuppoſed) power ouer the Mediatour, to cauſe Him corporally to deſcend, when they and their ſucceſſors ſhould thinke good? To conclude then, as no Scripture affirmes or implies, ſo all circumſtances are moſt contrary to this Reall preſence, and the reſt of thoſe intollerable ſuppoſes, which the light of nature is

ſo ſhent for gain-ſaying. What then, in the ſecond place, ſaith the Church? For the Church hauing nothing but either from nature, as they are men; or from Scripture, as they are holy men; it muſt follow, that where nature and Scripture are ſilent, the Church muſt needes be ſilent.Aug in 3. libris. Nazian. in Poem. Thoſe Fathers alſo which tooke vpon them to write the meruells of both the Teſtaments, for as much as they made no mention of theſe which are pretended, may it not be a faire argument, that the Church neuer knew them? would they haue omitted thoſe wonders, which in regard of obſcureneſſe more needed, in regard of ſtrangeneſſe more challenged, and in regard of (ſuppoſed) neceſſitie more required, notice and Faith at the

hands of men then any of the reſt? Yea,Aug Tom 3. l. 3. de trin. cap. 10. hee which writ them at the full (as all things elſe) leaſt he might be thought of forgetfulneſſe to haue left out this biggeſt miracle, thus ſaith of the Sacraments in an other place, that becauſe they are knowne vnto men, and by men are wrought, they may haue honour as things appointed vnto religion, but wonder as things meruailous they cannot haue. Euen thus much alone might it not bee ſufficient to conclude the Church to be negatiue concerning theſe ſuppoſes? or muſt we rather goe ſearch from age to age, the particular determination of the Fathers and writers in their times about theſe matters? So indeed would the Aduerſaries haue it: not becauſe they thinke to help their cauſe thereby, but,

partly becauſe they haue no ſuccour left, where-vnder to ſhelter themſelues, but this pretence; and partly for that by this kind of ſearch, they hope to gaine time, and neuer come to an end. And yet notwithſtanding euen in this kind hath the facility of our writers followed them, and diſcouered vnto the world how the ancient Fathers neuer dreamed of theſe their monſtrous ſuppoſes.

flatly, that the bread and the wine are conuerted into His bodie and blood, euen as monie may be ſaid to be conuerted into land, a penny into a penny loafe, &amp;c. An other againe ſaying; the ſame thing which is beleeued with our faith, is receiued with our mouth: euen as the ſeale and the inſtrument, or the inſtrument and our act is all one. And ſome finally ſaying, in the bread, is receiued that which did hang vpon the croſſe; meaning, that nothing elſe is intended in the receiuing that bread, but the benefit of Him that ſo died. Theſe manner of phraſes, and patheticall amplifications, the Fathers are not ſcrupulous ſometime to beſtow vpon this Bread: yet ſo as withall it may eaſily be diſcerned, how they neuer had therein any further intent, but

partly to weane the conceit of the receiuer from regarding the belly-elements; and partly by ſo attributing vnto the ſigne, the vertue and power of the thing, the ſpirit of the receiuer might the more kindly glide out of earthly ſhadowes and reſemblances, into heauenly apprehenſions and fruitions: ſo as from ſuch kind of comparatiue, ardent, and hyperbolicall ſpeeches, for any to gather poſitiue and abſolute concluſions, beſide the impiety of it, what is it elſe but extreame rudeneſſe and violence?

for the fruite of them: vnder which oftentimes if they carrie any breadth, it ſelfe will priuily lurke, and make them ſwell ſo fairely, and ſhew ſo goodly, as not onely the fruite ſhall be ſhadowed and ſowred thereby, but alſo it ſelfe in the ſtead thereof moſt greedily gathered and intertained. As (for a faire example) theſe words of our Sauiour [This is my bodie,] when it perceiued them to carrie more breadth and compaſſe then the meaning intended did require; what does it but crowd it ſelfe within them, and filling them according (indeed) to the latitude of the letter, hath gotten it ſelfe to be preferred (of the blind) before the meaning intended; namely, becauſe by it the letter is more fully repleniſhed: euen as the theife, which

therefore challenged the garment, becauſe his backe did better fit it. And this hath alwaies beene the practiſe of this ſubtile ſerpent, to worke both backward and forward: as yet more ſpecially we may note in this buſineſſe of the Sacrament. For whereas at firſt it perſwaded men to make no reckoning of it, but to reſort vnto it as to an ordinarie feaſt, as if they had no other houſes where to eate and to drinke;1. Cor. 11. 
               Hieron in 1. Cor. 11. and, (as a Father ſaith) rather to fill their bellies, then for the myſterie: now at laſt, after they were beaten from ſuch groſſe prophanenes, principally by the Apoſtles admonition, to diſcerne the Lords bodie (from the vſe, not from the ſubſtance of bread;) and partly by the diligence of ſucceeding Paſtors, continually

beating their conceit from minding the outward element, (thinking it needles to put men in mind that ſtill the outward element remained,) what does this cunning ſerpent, but according to his old rule, aſſaile them with a moſt contrarie perſwaſion; that when they would no longer eſteeme it (groſſely) as ordinary bread, he might make them now beleeue that it was no bread at all; and ſo conſequently (for ſome thing it muſt be,) His verie bodie indeed. Euen as thoſe Barbarians did by Paul,
               Act. 18. when firſt they iudged him to be ſome murtherer, and after, vpon occaſion of a little miracle, would needs make him no

Which monſtrous extremitie, beeing at firſt not perfectly diſcerned; partly becauſe it was ſo incredible, &amp; partly becauſe the firſt broachers of it were

conſtrued according to the Fathers phraſe, and as hauing no other intent in beſtowing ſuch ſuperlatiue tearmes vpon it, but

to be ſilent? For what though the cauſe happily did not need our helpe, or that the truth were plaine enough? what then? Does God call for thy ſeruice, becauſe He needs it? Is it any thing to the Almighty that thou art righteous? Is it not for thy exerciſe and benefite, that He puts duties and ſeruices vpon thee, that thou thereby mayſt ſweat out thy corruption, gather vp thy ſcattered ſoule, make it capable of bliſſe, and ſo waxe able to relliſh heauenly things? Speake then the truth, O man, whether the truth needs it or not: ſpeake it for thine owne good: for it is ſweet: ſpeake it, becauſe thou haſt a tongue:Pſal. 116.10. 
               I beleeued (ſaith the ſweet Pſalmiſt) and therefore I ſpake:
               2. Cor. 4.3. 
               we alſo beleeue (ſaith the moſt feruent Apoſtle) and therefore

ſpeake: Then if we all beleeue,Pſal. 34.3. let vs all ſpeake, and magnifie His name together: let vs drowne the noyſe of iniquity with the voice of truth and righteouſnes. And if the Aduerſary thinkes with outcries to make great their Diana of the Epheſians; let vs on the contrary be more loud, and more conſtant to cry, Abominable is Diana of the Epheſians. As for faire and ſoft courſes of argument, it is but loſt vpon ſelfe-condemned heretikes; as we haue more then probability to take theſe men to be, and that indeed they beleeue not themſelues, that, which with extreame terrours and tortours they force vpon the faith of others: whether it be their pollicie (moſt damnable though fooliſh) that by making men ſwallow this

monſtrous opinion, they may then readily bring them to bibbe

               n all other creeping vncleane errours whatſoeuer: or whether it be their pride, as diſdaining to be thought euer once to haue erred, but in ſharpenes of wit to goe beyond all the world, beyond all ſenſe and reaſon, yea beyond God Himſelfe: or whether it bee their fooliſh dotage vpon a few late forefathers (aboue a thouſand yeares ſince the firſt inſtitution) whoſe blind children they chooſe rather to be, then the right-ſighted children of God: though therein alſo they contrary their beſt forefathers, which preferred the firſt riſing of the Goſpel, before the old Idolls of their heathen parents: or whether finally, the cauſe be in their ſiluer-ſmithes,

they ſhall be grauiled and confounded. To ſuch therefore, Reader, be thou as farre from offering argument, as they will be farre from imbracing the truth, which howſoeuer in other matters they ſufficiently can diſcerne, and with much perſpicacitie afford; yet in this buſineſſe, they are reſolued they muſt be blind, and will be blind: and therefore to offer them light herein, what is it els but to ſhew them their deadly foe to ſhoot at? the ſtrength of this their hold beeing affected and wilfull darkeneſſe. But as for ſuch as haue not yet caſt themſelues into the nurture of theſe leaders, and yet do retaine a better opinion of (falſly ſo called) Catholikes; though knowledge, wiſedome, temperance, iuſtice, grauity, and courage

(if theſe be the onely motiues of their affection) haue abounded euen in Pagans, heathens, Philoſophers, and naturall men, (yea, and a ſcorne of equiuocation or treacherie againſt their enemies:) yet if they haue not ſo vtterly renounced their owne light, as not to bee able to diſcerne betwixt the moſt diſtant things that are, (the Creator, and the moſt common creature) ſuch we make no queſtion, will ſoone be brought to abandon the wilfull maintainers of this monſtrous opinion. And as wee hope, a little the ſooner, if they ſhall direct their conſideration along, by the thred and byaſſe of this preſent Treatiſe. The principal intent wherof, though it was for the proteſting and exerciſing our due and neceſſary

indignation againſt this Idoll, which ſo aduanceth it ſelfe in the Church of God, and in that very roabe which was ordained for the Body of our Lord; yet, as we hope, we haue not ſo giuen way to our zeale, but that ſufficient matter hath gone together withall, as well for the inlightning and reſoluing others, as for the inflaming of our ſelues. Notwithſtanding, for as much as that Spirit which requireth feruencie, does alſo commend vnto vs the loue of our enemies, (and who are a Chriſtians enemies, but Gods enemies,) therefore, Chriſtian Reader, according to the example of that bleſſed Steuen, who at his laſt gaſpe, prai
