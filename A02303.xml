            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

            THE PROLOGVE.
            
               AS the tyme is an inuenter of nouelties, and a regiſter certayne of thynges aunciente, and at the ende tyme gyueth ende to that ſuffrethe ende: The trouthe all onely amonge all thinges is priuileged, in ſuche wyſe, that whanne the tyme ſemethe to haue broken her wynges, than as immortall ſhe taketh her force. There is nothynge ſo entier, but it diminiſheth, nor nothynge ſo hole, but that is wery, nor nothynge ſo ſtrong, but that it breaketh, nor nothyng ſo wel kept, but that it corrupteth. Soo all theſe thynges tyme acheueth and burieth, but onely trouthe, the whiche (of the tyme and of all thynge that is in the tyme) triumpheth. Neyther to be fauoured of the good, nor to be perſecuted of the yll, may be, but that ſomtyme trouth may be ſtopped and hydde, but whan it is diſpleaſed, and wyl diſpleaſe, than at the laſte ſhe commeth to a good porte, and taketh londe. The fruites in the ſpryngyng tyme haue not the vertue to gyue ſuſtenaunce nor perfyte ſweteneſſe to ſatisfie the taſte of them that eatetth therof: but thanne paſſeth the ſeaſon of ſommer, and harueſt comethe, whiche tyme dothe better rype them, and thanne that that we doo eate dothe profyte vs, the profe therof is ryghte ſaueryneſſe, and gyuethe the more force and vertue, and the greatter is the taſte. I wyll in theſe fyrſte wordes ſaye, that in the fyrſte aeges menne were more eſtemed by theyr meke cuſtomes and delycatenes, than they were after reproued by their groſſe and rude vnderſtandynges. Certaynely ſomme of the aunciente philiſophers, I ſpeake of the mooſte aunciente, as welle Caldees as Grekes, who fyrſte lyfted theym ſelues to regarde the ſterres of the heuen, and ſurmounted the hyghe mounte of Olympius, there to contemplate and regarde the influences of the

planettes in the heuen: I dare well ſaye, that they haue rather merited pardon by theyr ignoraunces, than prayſynge or grace by their wyſedome. Theſe were the fyrſte that wolde ſerch the trouthe of the elementes of the heuen, and yet they were the fyrſte that dyd ſo we errours in thinges natural of the erthe. Homere in his Illiade ſaid theſe wordes in ſpeakynge of philoſophers: I prayſe nothyng the knowlege of myn aunceſters, but I can them greatte thanke and prayſe, in that they deſyred knowlege. This was welle ſayde of Homer. For if amonge the aunciente men had not rayned ſuche ignoraunce, there had not ben ſoo many ſectes and parcialities in euery ſchole. He that hath redde the auncient antiquities of the philoſophers, ſhall not denay me, the preſumption of the knowledge and ignorance of that they deſired to knowe, the whiche is chiefe cauſe, that ſcience is not all one. There is greatte nombre of parcialities, Cynitiens, Catoniens, Peripaticiens, Academyens, and Epicuriens, who were as contrary in their opinions, as dyuers in their naturalities. I wil not that my penne be ſo diſmeaſured to reproue ſoo moche the auncient men, that the glorie all onely ſhoulde abyde with them that be preſent. Truely if he merite guardon and prayſe, that ſheweth me the way, wherby I thynke to paſſe: yet no leſſe meriteth he that ſheweth and aduiſethe me of the waye, wherby I maye fayle. The ignoraunce of the auncient men hath ben but as a guyde to aduyſe and aduertiſe all other, and bycauſe they erred, we haue foūd ſith the waye, to their great prayſe, and to our gret ſhame. I ſay that if we that be no we preſent had benne than, wo had knowen leſſe than they dydde. And if they that were than were nowe at this houre, they ſhoulde ſurmounte vs in knowlege. And that this is trewe, tt appereth wel. For the auncient ſages, with their diligēce to know the trouth,

by their cloſe and ferme made the wayes: But we by our ſlouthe folowe not the open wayes. Than to the purpoſe that I wyll ſaye, we that be nowe preſent, canne not complayne of them that haue bene, but that the trouthe (the which accordynge to Aule. Gel. is doughter of the tyme) In this tyme of the worlde declarethe to vs the errours that we oughte to flee, and the trouthe of the doctrine that we ought to folowe. But as nowe the humayne malyce is ſo experte, and the vnderſtandynge of mortall menne is ſo dulle, that in tyme of nede, in goodnes of wyt we fayle and in all yll we knowe more than we ought to knowe. In ſuche wyſe, that ſome with one parte of the more, and ſome with leſſe, al preſume to wyn the game. And though this be true, yet it is but a ſmalle thynge to that we abyde fore: There is ſo moche that we oughte to knowe. For the moſte that we knowe, is the leaſt parte of that we be ignorant of, as the thynges natural, accordyng to the varietie of the tyme, lyke maner dothe the operations of the elementes. In ſemblable wiſe in thynges mortall, as the ages hath ſucceded, ſo are diſcouered the ſciences. For certayne all the fruites cometh not together. Whan one fayleth an other begynneth to entre in reaſon. I wylle ſaye, that neyther all doctours amonge chriſten menne, nor all the philoſophers amonge the gentylles were concurrante in one tyme, but after the deathe of one good, an other came better. The hygh and ſupreme wyſedome, the whiche all meane thynges gouerneth by Iuſtice, and departeth it accordynge to his bountie, wyll not that at oone tyme the worlde ſhulde want or be deſtitute of ſage men, nor at an other tyme want of ſymple perſonnes: ſome deſyringe the fruite, and ſome the leaues. In ſuch ſort that they ſhulde haue enuy of that other were impeched. This auncient world that ranne in Saturnus dayes, the whiche

other wyſe was called the golden worlde, the whiche was ſo eſtemed of them that ſawe it, and ſoo moche prayſed of theym that harde the writynge therof, and ſoo moche deſired of them that felt no parte therof, was not gold by the ſages that dyd gylte it, but bycauſe that there was none yll that did vngylt it. This our age nowe is of iron: yet it is not called of yron, for faute of ſages, but bycauſe the malycious people ſurmounte. I confeſſe one thynge, and I thynke I ſhall haue manye wyll fauour me in the ſame, that there was neuer in the worlde ſo moche people teachynge vertue, and ſoo fewe folowynge the ſame. Aul. Gele ſayth in his boke, that the ancient ſages were holden in reputation, bycauſe there were fewe teachers and many lerners: &amp; at this houre it is contrary, there be but fewe lerners and many teachers. The ſmall eſteme that the ſages be in at this tyme maye be ſene by greatte veneration that the philoſophers were holden in as than, the whiche thynge was trewe: Homer among the grekes, Salomom amonge the Hebrewes, Lygurge amonge the Lacedemonyens, Lyuie amonge the Romayns, Cicero amonge the Latines, Apolonius Thianeus amonge all the barbarike nations. I deſyre to haue ben in all theſe ages, whan the worlde was ſo ryche of ſage perſons, and ſo poore of ſymple perſons, whan they aſſembled out of ferre countreys, and of dyuers realmes and ſtrange nations: not all onely to haue hard their doctrines, but alſo to haue ſene their perſones. I thynke I am not begyled in the hiſtories, for whan Rome in his moſte proſperitie was hygheſt in tryumphe, Titus Liuius dothe write it in his hiſtories, and the glorious ſaynt Ierome affirmethe it in the prologe of the byble, that mo people came to Rome to ſe the eloquences of the bokes, more than to ioy any Romayne trumph. Whan Olympias was delyuered of her chylde the great

Alexander, Philip her huſbande and father to the yonge chylde wrote a letter to Areſtotle, wherin he ſayde: I gyue greate graces to the goddes, not all onely that they haue gyuen vnto me a ſonne, but bycauſe they haue gyuen him to me in the tyme that thou mayſte be his mayſter, and he thy diſciple. Marc Aurele the emperour, of whom this preſente boke entreatethe, he ſpeakynge of hym ſelfe wrote to Polion theſe wordes: Frende I wyl thou knowe, that I am not made emperour by reaſon of the bloude of my predeceſſours, nor yet for the fauour of my lynage nowe preſent, but it was bycauſe I haue ben always a frende and louer of the ſage people, and enmy to them that haue noo good knowlege. Ryght happy was Rome to choſe ſo valyant an emperour, and ryghte fortunate was that emperour to come to ſuche an empire, not by patrimonye but by ſagenes. And if that aege was glorious in ioyinge of his perſone, no leſſe it is to vs to ioye of his doctrines. I wyll intitle this boke the Golden boke. It maye be called golden, bycauſe in ſo high eſtimation it holdethe the vertuous, diſcoueringe in theyr tyme this boke with the ſentences, as theſe princes holdethe their myndes of golde in theyr Indes. But I ſaye that at this houre there be moo hartes banyſhed into the Indes of golde, than to employ them to rede the werkes of this boke. Saluſt ſaythe, that there ought great glory be gyuen to them that haue done there hygh and great actes: And that there oughte no les fame and renowme be gyuen to thoſe that in a good ſtyle haue written them. In this caſe I confeſſe to deſerue noo merites for my traduction or any fame, but I demaunde pardon of all them that be ſage, for the fawtes that they ſhall fynde therin. For excepte the diuine letters, there is nothynge ſoo well written, but that there maye be founde neceſſitie of correction, lyne, and ſenſure. Semed this to

to be trewe, by that Socrates was reproued of Plato, and Plato of Ariſtotle, Ariſtotle of Abenruyz, Scilio of Sulpice, Lelie of Varro, Marinꝰ of Tome, Enio of Horace, Senec of Aule Gele, Eſtratocles of Strabo, Teſato of Galene, Hermagore of Cicero, Origen of ſaint Ierom, ſaynt Ierome of Ruffyn, and Ruffyn of Donate? Sythe that in them and in theyr werkes there hath ben correctyon, who were men of hyghe knowlege, it is no reaſon that I ſhulde be in their fraternitie, ſeinge that I knowe ſo lytel as I do to the examynation of wiſe and vertuous men. To them I ſubmyt this preſent warke, and to theym that haue ben ſuche, I them require to be contente to be the reders, and not iuges therof. It were no pacience to ſuffre, nor lawe to permytte, that a thynge that a ſage perſonne with great maturite and delyberation hath written, to be diſprayſed by a ſymple perſone. For ones redynge, oftentymes the auctours and wryters are dyſprayſed, not of them that can traduce and compoſe werkes: but of them that can not vnderſtande them, and yet leſſe rede theym. I ſaye further of aduantage, that dyuers haue written of the tyme of the ſayde Marke Aureleo emperour, as Herodian wrote lyttel, Eutropio leſſe, Lampridio yet leſſe, Iulius Capitolyn ſome what more. The writinges of them and of other ſemeth rather epitomes than hiſtories. There is difference betwene this writynge, and that they wrote by herynge ſaye: but they by whome I haue compoſed this preſent warke, they were wytneſſe by ſyghte, and not by herynge of other, but they wrote what they ſawe them ſelfe: That is to ſay among the mayſters, who lerned the ſaid emperour their ſciēces, there were thre, that is to ſay, Iunto Raſtico, Cina Catule, and Sexto Cheronenſe, neue we to the greatte Plutarke. Theſe bene they that haue written this preſent hiſtorie, Sexto Cheronenſe in greke,

and the other two in latyne. I thinke of this hiſtorie is but ſmall notice, bycauſe vnto this houre it hath not be ſeene imprinted. Whan I departed from the college of my ſtudy, and wente to preache in the palays, where I ſawe ſoo many newe nouelties in the courtes, I delybered my ſelfe with greatte deſyre to knowe thynges, and gaue my ſelfe to ſerche and knowe thinges aunciente. And the caſe fortuned on a day, redynge an hiſtorie, I founde therin matter to be noted in a piſtel, and it ſemed to me ſo good, that I put all myne humayne forces to ſerche farther. And after in reuoluyng dyuers bokes, ſerchyng in dyuers libraries, and alſo ſpeakynge with diuers ſages of dyuers realmes, finally I founde this tretiſe in Florence, amonge the bokes left there by Coſme de Medicis, a man of good memory. I haue vſed in this writinge, the whiche is humayne, that that dyuers tymes hath ben vſed in diuinitie, that is to reduce, not worde for word, but ſentence for ſentence. We other interpretours are not bounde to gyue for the meane the wordes, it ſuffiſeth to gyue for the weyghte the ſentence: As the hiſtoriographes, of whom there were dyuers, and the hiſtorie that they made was all but one thing. I wyl not deny, but I haue left out ſome wordes, which were not mete, nor well ſittynge, rude, and leaſte of valure, and I haue medled it with outher more ſwete and profitable. I thynke that euery wyſe man, after he hathe redde this boke, wyll not ſaye that I am the principal auctour of this warke, nor yet to iuge me ſo ignorant to exclude me clene from it, for ſo hygh ſentences are not found at this preſente tyme, nor to ſo hygh a ſtyle they of tyme paſt neuer atteyned.
            
               ❧ Here endeth the prologue.
         
      
      
         
            ¶Here begynneth the boke of the lyfe of the noble and eloquent Marke Aurely emperour.
         
            ¶Of the byrth and lyguage of Marke Aurele Anthony emperour. cap. primo.
            
               IN the yere of the foundation of Rome .vi.C.lxxxxv. in the Olimpiade a. C.lxiii. Anthony the meke, beinge deed, than conſules Fuluie Caton, and Gnee Patrocle in the hygh capytol, the .iiii. daye of Octobre, at the demaunde of all the people Romayn, and conſent of the ſacred Senate, was declared for emperour vniuerſall of all the monarche of Rome, Marc Aurely Antony. This excellente baron was naturally of Rome borne in the mounte Celye. And accordyng as Iulius Capitolyne ſayth, he was born the .vi. kalendes of May, the whiche accordynge to the accompt of the latyns, was the xxvi. daye of the monethe of Apryll paſſed. His father was named Anio Vero. For the occaſion whereof the hiſtories dyuers tymes calle hym Marc Anthony Vero. True it is, that Adriane the emperour called hym Veriſſimus, bycauſe in hym was neuer founde no lyes, nor neuer fayled the trouth. Theſe Anius Veres was a lignage, that auaunced them to be deſcēded of Numa Pompilio, and of Quintꝰ Curtius the famous Romayn: whiche for to delyuer the towne of Rome from perylle, and to gyue his perſone perpetualle memorye, of his owne good free wylle he yelded hym ſelfe to the ſame vorage, that as than was ſene in Rome. The mother of this emperour was called Domiciade, as Cyne hiſtorien recounteth in the bokes of the lygnages of Rome. The Camilles were perſones in that tyme greatly eſtemed, by cauſe they were accompted to be deſcended of Camille the

famous and auncient capytayne Romayne, whiche delyuered Rome frome the Gaulles, that had wonne hit. The men that deſcended of that lygnage were called Camilli, for the remembrance of Camille, and the women were likewiſe called Camilles, in the remembrance of a doughter of the ſayde Camylle, that was called Camilla. ¶There was an auncyent lawe, that al Romaynes ſhuld haue a partycular priuylege in the ſame place, where their predeceſſours had done to the Romayne people any great ſeruyce. For this auncient cuſtome they had priuylege, ſo that all they of the lygnage of Camylle were kepte and maynteyned in the hygh capytol. And though the varietie of the tyme, the multitude of tyrantes, the ebulition and mouynge of cyuill warres were cauſe of the diminyſhing of the aunciente Polycie of Rome, and introduced in maner a lyfe not very good: yet for all that we reede not, that the preemynences of the Romaynes were broken, but yf it were in the tyme of Sylla, whanne he made the vnyuerſall preſcription agaynſt the Marians. After the deth of this cruelle Sylla, in exaltynge of hym ſelfe, Iulius Ceſar the pitiefull, made dictatour of Rome, and chiefe of the Marians, adnulled and vndydde all that Sylla had made, and broughte ageyne into the auncyent eſtate the common welthe.
            ¶What hath benne the condycions, the eſtate, pouertie, rycheſſe, fauour, or diſfauour of the aunceſtours of this Marke Aurelye Emperour, we fynde not in the aunciente hyſtories, and yet it hath ben dilygently ſerched for. The ancyent Romayn hyſtoriens were not accuſtomed to write the lyues of the emperours fathers, namely whanne they be made monarches, but the merytes and graces that their chyldren had, as for the auctoritie that they hadde inheritynge their fathers. Trouthe it is, as ſaythe Iulius

Capitolyn, the father of Marke Aurelee themperour, had ben pretour in exerciſes, and capitayne in the Frontiers, in the tyme of Traian the good, and Adrian the wyſe, and Anthony the meke, emperours. This is cōfirmed by that the ſame Marc Aurelee wrot (being at Rodes) to a frende of his called Polion, that was at Rome, ſayinge thus: Many thynges haue I felte and knowen frende Polyon, by the abſence of Rome, namely of that I ſe my ſelfe here alone in this yle: but as vertue makethe a ſtraunger naturall, and vice tournethe naturall to a ſtraunger: And as I haue ben .x. yeres here at Rodes to rede philoſophy, I therby repute my ſelfe as naturall of this lande, &amp; that hathe cauſed me to forgette the pleaſures of Rome, and it hath lerned me the maners of the yle. And here I haue founde many of my fathers frendes. Here was capitayne agaynſte the Barbariens, to my lorde Adrian, Anthonye my father in lawe, the ſpace of .xv. yeres. I lette the to wyte, that the Rodian people are curteis, and ful of good graces. I wolde haue redde phyloſophy as longe as my father had ben at Rodes in warre, but I maye not: for Adrian my lorde commaundethe me to go and kepe reſidēce at Rome, howe be it euery man reioyſethe to ſee his naturall countrey.
            ¶So by the wordes of this letter it is to be beleued, that Anio Vero, father to this emperour Marc, hadde applyed the mooſte parte of his lyfe in warre. It was not the cuſtome lyghtly to truſte a perſon to haue the office of a gouernour on the Frontiers, without he had bene well exercyſed in the feates of warre. And as all the glorie of the Romaynes was to leaue after theym good renowme, the ſayd Marc certaynly was taken for the mooſte vertuous, and had greatteſte frendes in the Senate, wherby he truſted on the conqueſt of the moſt cruell enmyes: accordyng

as the ſayde Sexto Cheronenſe hiſtorien ſaythe. The Romayns all though they had in theyr handes mooſte peryllous warres, yet they hadde in foure partes of the empire ſtronge and entier garniſons. That is to ſay in Byzance, the which is nowe Conſtantinople, by reaſone of them of the oryente: And Engades, the whiche nowe is called Calex a citie of Spayne, for loue of them of the weſte: In the ryuer of Rhodano, which is nowe ye ryuer of Ryne, for the Germaynes: And in Colloſſe, whiche nowe is calledde the Rhodes, bycauſe of the Barbariens. In the kalendes of Ianuarie, whanne the ſenate deuyded the offyces, beinge pourueyed of a dictatour, and of two conſulles yerely. Incontynente in the thyrde place they prouyded for foure mooſte excellente barons to defendethe ſayde foure Frontiers: The whiche ſemeth to be true, for the moſt famous and renowmed barons of theyr yonge daies were capitaines in the ſaid Frontiers. The great Pompeius was ſent to the Byzaunces Canſtantinople: The worthy Scipio was ſente to the Colloſſences and Rodyans: And the couragious Iulius Ceſar was ſent with the Gadytaynes of Calyx of Spayne: and the ſtronge eſtemed Marcus was ſente to theym of the ryuer of Ryne. This we ſaye bycauſe that Anio Vero father to Marc Aurele emperour, had ben prouoſte and pretour in the offices, and one of the capitaines of the Frontiers, whiche oughte to be in Rome one of the perſons moſt eſtemed.
         
         
            ¶What mayſters Marke Aurely hadde in his youthe. cap. ii.
            VVe haue not by any autentike hiſtories, fro whens, whan, or howe, in what maner, or in what exercyſes, or with what perſons, or in what londes was ſpent &amp; conſumed

the moſte parte of the lyfe of this good emperour. But to be ſhorte, Iulius Capitolyn ſayth, that he had ben xxiii. yere vnder the commaundemente of Adrian the emperour. Howe be it contrarye wyſe is founde by other hyſtoriens, accordynge as ſaythe Sexto Cheronenſe in his hyſtorie. It was not the cuſtome of the Romayns cronyclers, to wryte the thynges doone by theſe princes, before they were pryncis, but onely of yonge people, beynge in their yonge age, hauynge greatte and hye magnyficence, and doing great interpriſes. This ſemeth to be of trouth: for Sueton Tranquyll recounteth largely the fearefulle dedes and enterpryſes doone by Caius Iul. Ceſar in his yonge age, to ſhewe to princes to comme, howe it was a great ambicyon, that they had to attayn to the monarchy, and but of ſmalle wytte and maturitie to kepe theym ſelfe therin. It is noo newe thynge that menne gape for hye and frayle thynges. And the more hygher the magnificēce is, the more lower they fele fortune. And whan they were diligent to accomplyſſhe their deſyre, as moche thoughte had they to conſerue their quyetnes and reſte. In caſe thā that Anio Vero, father to Marke the Emperour, folowed the exerciſe of warres: yet he put his ſonne in the way to lerne ſcience. For there was a lawe ſore vſed and accuſtomed, and well kepte in the Romayne polycye, that euery citeſens ſonnes, that enioyed the lybertie of Rome, and had accomplyſſed .x. yeres, ſhulde not be ſuffred to goo by the ſtretes as vacabundes. Nor it ſhulde not be ſuffered by the Cenſure, who gouerned Rome, &amp; dayely toke hede to the forfaytes doone therin, to ſuffre a chylde no lengar than .x. yeres of his age to play the chylde. But fro thenſe forthe the father of the chylde ſhulde be bounde to noryſhe hym out of the circuite of Rome, or to laye a pledge, that his ſonne ſhulde doo no folyes. Whan Rome tryumphed,

and by theyr policie gouerned all the worlde, it was certaynly a meruaylous and monſtruous thing to ſe it then, and no leſſe fearefull vnto vs nowe to here therof. There was at that tyme in Rome .iiii. hūdred. M, inhabitantes, amonge whom there was .ii. hundred. M. yonge people, that were refreyned and brydled from their yonge pleaſures. The ſonne of Cato was chaſtyſed, bycauſe he was wylfull and preſumptuous. And alſo the brother of good Cyna was banyſhed, bycauſe he wente ydelly as a vacabounde. Without that Cicero begyleth vs in his bokes of the Romayne lawes, no Romayne ought to ſtraye abrode in the ſtretes of Rome, but if he bare in his hand the ſigne or token of the offyce, wherby he lyued. To thentente that euery man ſhuld knowe, that he lyued by his trauayl, and not by the ſweate of other men. This lawe was kepte of euery perſone. The emperour hadde borne before hym a brennynge brande: The conſulle an axe of armes: the prieſtes a hat in maner of a coyfe: the ſenatours a tongue in maner of a cruſyble on their armes, the Cenſure a lyttelle table: the tribunes a mace: the centuryons a ſygne or baner, the oratours a boke, the gladiatours a ſwerde, the tayllours ſheres, the ſmethes a hammer, and in lyke wyſe of all the other offices and craftes. We maye knowe than by this that is ſayde, that after that Marke Aurelye was borne at Rome, his father in his youthe had taughte hym good norture. And though it ſo were, that the beginnynge of his yonge aege ſhulde be hydde from vs: at the leaſt way we are certayne, that the myddell aege and ende of hym was ryght glorious. His father Anio Vero wolde that his ſonne Marcus Aurelius ſhoulde leaue feates of armes, and folowe ſtudy. And ſurely it is to be thoughte, that it was done more by the valyauntenes of the father, than the cowardenes of the ſonne, excepte the dedes of

them that be deed begyle vs that ben alyue, and the cauſe iudged by clere vnderſtandynge, and that we fynde moo ſentences of dyuers ſadde perſons, that there hath benne but fewe that ben loſte by writinges and lernynge, ye and a great meynye fewer that haue had auantage by armes. Reuolue all bokes, and ſerche throughe all realmes, and finally they ſhewe vs, that very few in theyr realmes haue ben happy in armes, but there haue bene many famous &amp; renowmed by ſcripture and lernynge. Take here example and ſe if it be true or not that I ſaye. Had the Aſſiriens mo than one kynge, that was Ninus, one Lygurge amonge the Lacedemonians, the Egyptiens one Ptholome, the Hebrewes one Machabee, the Grekes one Hercules, the Macedoniens one Alexāder: the Epirotiens one Pirrhe, one Hanyball the Carthageniens, and one Iulius Ceſar amonge the Romayns? It is not thus of lerned men: for if the Grekes had one Homer, noo leſſe the Grekes vaunteth theym of the .vii. ſages, whome we beleue more in their philoſophy, than Homer in the warres of Troy. For as difficile it is to fynde a trouthe in Homere, as a lye in theſe ſages. Semblably the Romaynes hadde not onely Cycero as ryght eloquent, but alſo they had Saluſt, Lucan, Titus Liuius, with a great company of noble men, and well approued, who haue left ryght great credence in their ſcriptures in the ſayinge of trouthe. What loſt Cicero in the ſenate for vſyng of inuectiues? And as we ſaye of ſo ſmall a nombre of Grekes and latynes, we may ſaye of the Aſſitiens, Perſians, Medes, Argiues, Acayens, Peniens, Frenchemen, Britons, Englyſhemen, and Spanyardes. All the whiche nations withoute comparyſon haue of theym ſelfe lefte more memorye, and haue honoured theyr londes and countreyes more by writing, thanne they that haue lefte ſignes by armes. Than lette vs leaue

theſe ſtraunge hiſtories, and retourne to the pythe of our emperour Marcus Aurelius, as Eutrope recountethe. According as this excellent baron lerned diuers ſciences, ſo he had dyuers mayſters to teche hym. He ſtudied grammer with a mayſter named Euphorion, muſyke with an other named Gemino Comode, eloquence with Alexander a greke, In naturalle philoſophy he had to his mayſters Comode Calcedonien an auncient baron, whiche expounded to hym Homer: and Sexto Cheronenſe, neuewe to the great Plutarche. Alſo he ſtudied in the lawes, and Voluſie Meciano was his mayſter. This emperour eſtemed to haue the knowlege of payntinge, and to graue in wood and metall, in erthe, and other ſculptures, in whiche arte his maiſter was Diogenito, in his tyme a famous and renowmed paynter. He trauayled alſo to knowe and ſerche what extended to the arte of Nygromancye. By accaſion wherof he wente openly to here Apolonio. And to thentēt that there ſhulde be nothynge vnlerned of hym, he aboue all ſciences ſette his mynde to Coſmography, in the whyche for his mayſters, he toke Iunio Roſtyco, that ſythe wrote his lyfe, and Cina Catule, the whiche wrote of his deathe, and the lyfe of Comode his ſonne. Of theſe noble and excellent barons, that flouryſſhed in thoſe dayes, he was taughte in vertues and ſciences. Cicero lamentethe the auncient policie of Rome, bycauſe that he ſawe great loſſe in the common welthe than preſente, ſayinge in his Retorike, that the auncient Romayns had alway regarde to that parte, where they thoughte mooſte domage and peryll ſhulde growe. There were .v. thynges amonge all other in Rome, whervnto they hadde euer a vigilante reſpecte, the whiche the ſenate neded not to care for, nor no lawe diſpenſed for them: and theſe bene they, the pryeſtes were honeſt: and the virgines veſtales ryghte chaſte: the

penalties right iuſte, the capitaynes full valiant: They that taught yonge chyldren were vertuous. It was not permytted in Rome, that he that was a mayſter in ſcyences, ſhulde be diſciple of vices.
         
         
            ¶What ſciences Marcus the emperour lerned. And of a meruayllous letter that he ſent to Polyon. cap. iii.
            
               PHiloſtrate ſaythe, that it was demaunded of Polion, who was the rycheſte manne of the worlde: He aunſwered, It was he that had moſte wyſedome. He was demaunded agayne, who was mooſte poore: He aunſwered, he that had leaſt wytte. Of trouth it was a worthy ſentence of ſuche a perſonne. The effecte therof we ſe dayly by experience, the wyſe ſlydynge in dyuers chances of fortune, releueth hym ſelfe: The vnwytty perſone, in very ſmall thynges thouchynge his lyuyng not greatly decayed, fallethe downe. There is nothynge that is ſo loſt, but that there is hope of recoueryng, if it be in the handes of a wiſe man. And cōtrary wiſe, there is no thynge ſo aſſured, but the recouerance therof oughte to be feared, if a fole haue the guidinge therof. It was axed of Xenophon the philoſopher, whether he hadde rather to be foolyſhe and a greatte lorde, or to be wyſe and poore. He aunſwered and ſayde, I haue pitie of a ryche foole, and I haue enuye of a wyſe manne waxen poore. For if a wyſe man haue but one fote, yet wyl he ryſe and kepe hym ſelfe from fallynge: And if ye gyue an abbaye to a foole, yf by fortune he fall, he wyll neuer releue agayn. ye may thynke that the father that dieth and leaueth his ſonne poore and wyſe, that he leaueth to hym moche: And he that leauethe

his ſonne ryſhe and folyſhe, I thinke he hath lefte him nothynge. Theſe thynges conſidered, Anio Vero, father of the emperour, as a father that loued his ſonne hartly, was not content, to delyuer one mayſter to his ſonne, to make him vertuous, and to lerne one ſciēce, wherwith he myght occupie his vnderſtandynge, but he gaue hym many maiſters, that refreyned hym from vices, and commaunded, that he ſhuld lerne many ſciences, to thentēt that he ſhuld be the more beſily exerciſed. Whan and howe moch he trauayled to lerne, and what ſciences, and with whom, and with what wyll he lerned, and what he knewe, he wrote hym ſelfe, beinge at Agrippine, nowe called Coleyn, to a frende of his, named Polion, as it foloweth.
            ¶Frend Polion, thou meruayleſt, why that I leaue not to lerne newe thynges at the ende of my dayes. He that hath but one meate to eate, and can not eate therof, he leueth it, and peraduenture it was holſom for hym, and eateth other thynges, that he ſeeth, which maye be hurtfull to hym. It is a great magnificence to a man, to haue dyuers ſortes of meates: for if he haue no luſte to one, that is good for hym, he maye take of an other, that is better. He that is wyſe, may vnderſtande me, without any more declarynge. As in all artes, a man is content at the laſte: ſo at the laſte, be they neuer ſo ſwete, they torne to a werineſſe. He that knoweth but one ſcience, though he be wiſe, yet he renneth in great daungier. For being annoied therwith, he wyll occupie his lyfe in other hurtefull thynges. The noble and worthy perſones, that dyd caſte ſlouthe awaye fro them, haue lefte of theym eternall memorie, not wyllyng to lerne al only one ſcience, to attempre their vnderſtāding with, but alſo trauayled, to lerne diuers other, wherwith they ſharped their wittes, to thentente that they ſhuld not be dulled and made blonte. In al naturall thinges,

nature is with righte lyttell content, but the ſpirite &amp; vnderſtandynge, is not ſatisfied with many thinges. And ſithe the vnderſtandynge is of ſuche condition, that it is loſte by libertie, and is lyghtely encombred, with ſubtilite it percethe, with quicknes it knoweth, &amp; with ignorance it waſteth: it is neceſſarie, by time to remount to very high thinges, leſt it bowe vnto lowe and yll thynges. Al corporall domages, that chance to mortall men, are by medicynes healed, or by reaſon remedied, or by length of time cured, orels by dethe ended: The only vnderſtanding, which is duſked in errours, and depraued in malyces, canne not be healed by medecines, nor redreſſed by reaſon, nor holpe by counſel. The aunciente philoſophers, in the ſayd happye golden worlde, and golden age, dyd not all only lerne one thing, wherby they myght ſuſteyne theyr life, and encreaſe good fame: But they trauayled, to knowe all that was to be knowen, and yet euer ſoughte to knowe more. ¶In the .lxxv. of the Olympiade, as dyuers perſons were aſſembled in the hygh mountayn Olympius, to celebrate the playes, by fortune thither came a philoſopher of Thebes, whiche had made all that euer he brought with hym. He made his ſhowes, his cote, and ſewed his ſherte, and had written his bokes, and ſo of all other thynges. They that were there aſſembled, were abaſhed, and meruaylled greatly, that one man coude do it. He was dyuers tymes aſked, where he lerned ſo many thynges. And he aunſwered and ſayde, The ſlouthe of man is the cauſe, that one arte is diuided into dyuers artes. For he that knoweth al artes together, muſte nedes knowe one alone. This philoſopher anſwered highly. And ſurely, they that herd him, ought to haue bene as greatly aſhamed of his wordes, as the philoſopher was of the vainglory of his apparel. Let euery man remembre hym ſelfe, and let no man blame the

ſhortnes of the tyme, nor wekenes of our nature. For ther is nothyng ſo hard, but it is made ſoft: nor ſo high, but it may be raught: nor kept ſo cloſe, but it may be ſene: nor ſo ſubtyle, but it may be felt: nor ſo darke, but it may be lighted: nor ſo profounde, but it may be diſcouered: nor ſo diſſeuered, but it may be gathered to gether: nor ſo loſt, but it may be found: nor ſo impoſſible, but it may be conſerued, if with al our hartes, we occupie our powers in good exerciſes, and applye our vnderſtandynge in hyghe thynges. I deny not, but our nature is lyttell worth: But I know well, that leſſe worth is our ſlouthfulnes. I wold demāde of euyll men, the whiche praye vs to be good, and axeth counſell of vs, for their ſenſualitie, ſayenge, that they be weyke and fraile, although they haue vnderſtandyng, to inuent euyls, and haue ſtrength inough, to put them in effecte, and to perſeuer therin, they neuer lacke conſtance. The cauſe is, we call it natural, for to do and commit vyces and miſeries. And ſlouth in vertue, we calle ſtraunge and weake, bycauſe of the werkes.
            ¶Lette no man blame our nature, for beynge weake and fainte: nor lay agaynſt the goddes, that they be cruell: for we haue no leſſe ablenes to do well, than redyneſſe to doo yll. Lette none ſay, I wold, and I can not withdrawe me from vice. It is better ſayde, I maye, but I wyl not folowe vertue. I wyll not defame ſtraunge realmes, but I wyll ſpeake of vs, that be latynes, and by theym ſhall be ſene, howe they haue benne full of malyce, and that they myghte haue done well. I wolde wytte of the dedes, that Marcus Anthonius dyd with Cleopatra: The proſcription, that Scilla made of the nobles of Rome: The coniuration, that Catilina inuented agaynſte his countreye: The bloudde, that was ſhedde for the cauſe of Pompeye, in the campe of Pharſale: And the greatte thefte, that Iulius

Ceſar made of the treaſour, the cruelties, that Nero dyd to his mother: the ſhames, that Calygula committed with his ſiſters, the treſon, that Brutus dyd to his father Gaius: the ſhrewdenes and cruelties, that Domician did to the virgins veſtales: the treaſons, that Iulius Patroclus vſed with the Syliciens and Syculians, the frayes &amp; murders, that Vlpio, the mariner, made in the temples and churches of Campayne. I wolde knowe of ſuche, as I haue reherſed, and diuers other, that I ſpeke not of, that applied them to ſo many ſhrewde turnes, who letted them (if they had wolde) to haue applied them ſelfe to do other good dedes? All this I haue ſayde, my frende Polyon, to aunſwere, to that ye haue demaunded of me. That is, in what ſciences I haue waſted and conſumed my tyme. Wherfore it pleaſeth me, to telle it to the. Anio Vero my father, ſuffred me but .viii. yere in my childhode: and than, tyll I was .x. yere of age, I went to ſchole for to write and rede: and fro .x. yere to .xiii, I went to ſtudye with Euformion, and lerned grammer: Fro .xiii. yere to .xvii. I lerned eloquence, with Alexander ye greke, a famous oratour: fro that tyme to .xxii. yere, I was with Sexto Calcedon, lernynge naturall philoſophy. Thoſe yeres paſſed, I was at Rhodes, and ſtudied humanitie, tyll I was .xxxii. yere of age. And than I wēt to Naples, where as I was thre yere with Fonton a greke, lernynge greke letters. And I put my good wylle ſoo moche therto, that I ſpake, and wrote greke more eaſily than latin. Than I retorned to Rome, where the warre of Dace aroſe, to the whiche Adrian my lorde ſente me: And bycauſe that in armes, and in tyme of warre, I coude carie no bokes of ſcience, I determyned me, to lerne the ſcience of muſike with Hieronyme Comode, to thentent that I myght with ſwetenes of inſtrumentes, reſtrayne my body fro certayn vices, which as than in

my houſe began to take force. All the reſte of my lyfe, thou knoweſt, it hath ben in bearyng of offyces in Rome, vnto the tyme that the weight of the monarchye was layde on my ſhulders. Hytherto the emperour ſpake.
            ¶Than by this letter, writen to his frend, it ſemeth well, that without ſleuth he paſſed his tyme. It is reaſon, to beleue it holly, in that he hath ſayd. For ſo excellent workes, that he made, and ſo hygh ſentences, as he wrote, myghte not procede, but of a prudent man, and a very wiſe ſpirite.
         
         
            ¶Howe for the wyſedome of Marcus, many wiſe men flouriſhed in his tyme. Cap. iiii.
            
               AS the lyfe of the prince is but as a whyte, for all other to ſhote at, and as a glaſſe wherin al the worlde doth beholde: ſo we ſe by experiēce, that whervnto a prynce is inclyned, the people trauaylynge to folowe the ſame, haue not the diſcretion, to eſchewe the euyl, and folowe the good. Certaynly they muſe no leſſe vppon a counterfayte fowle, made of fethers, thanne though it were of fleſſhe, and yet at the fyrſte flyght, it leeſeth the lybertie, and yet his hunger is not therby quenched. Whereby all the wynges of lybertie are tourned to peyne of ſeruage. It is a greatte offence, and an immortall infamye, to a prynce, that in the ſteede of gyuynge his hande of good lyuynge, to releue other, caſteth backewarde his fote of euyll example, wherby all other ouerthrowe. Than withoute cōpariſon, greatter is the wyckedneſſe of the people, than the neglygence of the prince. For if one lyueth ylle, and an nother loweth him, it is no meruayle: and thoughe there be but fewe, that folowe hym, it is no newe thynge. Nor in caſe, that many folowe hym, is noo fearefulle thynge: but all

the hole to folowe hym, is a great ſclander. If the people were ſuch, as they ought to be, one ſhuld rather tourne frō yll to good for many, than that many for one ſhuld torne frō good to yl. Certainly euery man knoweth, that though we be bounde to folow the honeſt cōmaundementes of our princes, yet we be not bounde to folowe theyr yll lyuynge. What ſhall we ſay thanne, ſeynge that nowe adayes, the delytes of menne are of ſo greatte pryce, and the rygour of theyr empire, in ſo poore eſtimation, that without ſhame, ſome diſprayſe their iuſt commaundementes, and folowe their euyll werkes. O, if the princes had ſuche nombre of good folke, that wolde fulfyll theyr commaundemente, as they haue greatte nombre of wretches, that folowe theyr doinges, I ſwere, that there ſhulde be no nede of any priſon for the myſdoers, or carcans for blaſphemers, chaines for ſclaues, nor heddynge blockes for traytours, nor knyues for aduoutrers, nor galowes for theues. I wyll gyue you example of all this, wherby ye ſhall ſe, that it is trew, that I ſay. If the kynge be inclyned to hunte, all wyll be hunters: if he be a player, all wyll playe: yf he vſe armes, all wyll tourney: if he be an aduoutrer, other wyll vſe the ſame: yf he be fierſe, other wyll be fierſe: yf he be vertuous, all wyll be vertuous and valyaunt: yf he be temperate and moderate, all wyll abſteyne: if he be hardye, all wyll be bolde: yf he be pitiefull, al wyll haue pitie: if he be wyſe, all wyll lerne. And to the entente, that we blame not all onely the princes of our days, lette vs call to memory, the princis of tymes paſte. Who that hath redde Sextus Cheronenſe, in his boke called the dyuers inclynatyons, that princis haue had, ſhall fynde, that Romulus, foundatour of Rome, honoured greatly grauers in ſtone: Numa Pompilius, his ſucceſſour, honoured prieſtes: Paulus Emilius, mariners: Caius Ceſar, goldſmythes: Scipio,

the capitaynes: Auguſtus Octauiꝰ, tennis players: Calligula, ruffyens, Tyberius, baudes: Cruell Nero, ſwerde players: Claudius, writters: Scilla, armorers: Marius, his compagnion, grauers of ymages: Vaſpaſian, good paynters: Titus his eldeſt ſonne, mynſtrelles: Domitian, his myghtye brother, croſſebowe makers: And aboue all other, our Marcus Aurelius emperour, wyſe menne. The dyuers inclynations, that princis had in dyuers thynges, hath made to vary the fauour &amp; disfauour of many pryncis, with their people. And as the common people regardeth more fauour, than Iuſtice, ſuche officers are mooſte fauoured, to whom princis doth mooſte inclyne. All this we ſay, to ſhewe, howe that in the tyme of this good emperour, wiſe men were fauoured. If the hyſtorians doo not lye, ſythe the tyme of Mecena, the Romayne (whiche was moche more happye, to haue wyſe menne to his frendes, than to inuent newe maner of meates and bankettes) vnto this Marcus Aurelius, haue paſſed .xvii. emperours, which were Iulius, Octauius, Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, Nero, Galba, Othus, Vitellus, Vaſpaſianus, Titus, Domitianus, Nerua, Traianus, Adrianus, Anthonius, and Aurelius. And of all theſe, we can fynde al onely but two, that fauoured wyſe men, that is to ſaye, Nerua and Traian. All the other emperours were not onely dyſciples of liers, but alſo were perſecutours of the trouthe. This ſemeth to be trewe: for Iulius perſecuted Cicero: Octauius baniſhed Ouide: Tyberius enpoyſoned Caluitio: Caligula cauſed to cutte the throtes of .iiii. oratours to gether: Nero ſlewe his mayſter Senec: Claudius ſette his vncle Lucan in priſon: Othus hanged vp Patroclus: Domitian banyſſhed all the oratours of Rome: And the more to ſhewe his curſednes, whā the wiſe men, yt were baniſhed, wēt out at one gate, there entred in at an other gate

all vnthriftes, the whiche by Tytus his brother, had ben banyſſhed and exiled. And as I ſaye of theſe fewe in nombre, I myghte ſay of many other. For certaynely the wyſe men were not thus intreated in the tyme of this good emperour Marcus: and that this is true, it ſemeth by diuers excellent barons, well lerned in diuers ſciences, that flouriſhed in his tyme: Iulius Capitolin recounteth of them as foloweth. Alexander, a greke, Traſion, Polyon, Euticius, Anius Macrion, Caninius, Crodiaticus, Fornius, Cornelius, Apolonius, Nius, Sextus Cheronenſe, Iunius Raſticus, Claudius Maximus, Cina Catulus, Claudius Seuerus, and the renowmed Diogenitus paynter, and the well lerned lawyer Voluſius Mecianus. All theſe were in this emperours palays, and reſidente in his perſence: And yet for all that, he had dyuers other wiſe preſons in Rome, and abrode in Italy. It was no meruail, to ſe in thoſe dayes, the multitude of men, that flouriſſhed in wiſedome. There was no father, but if he had two ſonnes, he wolde ſet one of them to ſtudy, and the other, accordyng to the Romayne lawe, ſhuld be ſette to the warres. And if this emperour wyſt of any wyſe yong man aboue al other he wolde fauour hym.
         
         
            ¶Of the emperour Marcus ſonne named Veriſſimus. Cap. v.
            
               THis emperour Marcus Aurelius, hadde only two ſonnes, as Herodian ſaythe. The greatteſt and eldeſt, was called Comode, and the yō
               geſt was named Veriſſimus. He was a fayre childe of perſon, and right vertuous of liuing. With his beautie he drewe to hym the eies of many, and with his good inclinations, he robbed the hartes of all

men. He was the hope of the people, and the glorie of his fathers age. And though the eldeſt was prince, yet themperour determyned, that the laſte borne, for his vertues, ſhulde inherite as the eldeſt: And he that was fyrſt borne, for his demerites, ſhulde be diſherited. And as good deſyres in the beſt tyme fayle often by vnhappy chance, this emperour being of .lii. yeres of age, and the ſonne. of .xvi. the glorie of Rome, and hope of the father, the lyfe of the ſonne toke an ende. And as moche was the deathe bewayled, as the lyfe deſyred. It was great pytie, for the ſenate by reaſon therof ſawe not themperour, nor the olde emperour for ſorowe ſawe not the ſenate of a longe ſpace. Rome was ryght heuy, and the ſenate withdrewe them to the heighte of the capitoll dyuers dayes. And as the myſtes and wyndes cauſe the leaues to falle, that were grene in ſommer, and the dedes of honour conſtrayne vs to forget the myſhappes of fortune, &amp; as a man of high lynage, and of ſtronge courage, thoughe that ſorowe remayne in his harte, and abydethe locked therin, determynethe to clenſe the braunches of ſorowes that is outward, fayning ioy and myrthe outwardely, kepynge the ſorowe within: ſo this Marcus the emperour, as a man whoſe vine freſeth and dyethe, wherin he had al his hope, contented him with that was lefte behynde. Whan his dere ſonne Veriſſimus was deed, he ſente for the prince Comode his onely inheritour, whiche ſythe the chylde his brother was deed, entred not in to the palays. And the emperour ſeynge the proude and outragious porte of his ſonne Comode, bedewed his eien with ſalte teares, remembrynge the ſhame of the one, and the dethe of the other. The whiche perceyued by Fauſtyne his mother, which loued hym moſte entierly, commaunded to haue her ſonne awaye fro the preſence of his father.
         
         
            
            ¶What wyſe and auncient men Marcus choſe to inſtructe his ſonne. Cap. vi.
            
               THoughe that the harte of this emperour was occupied with the death of his chylde, yet for all that he reyſed his vnderſtandyng, to haue the prince his heyre ryght well brought vppe. For certaynely princis bene ſuche, whan they come to mans eſtate, as they be brought vp in their tender youth. The father than knowynge the frayle inclinations of his chylde, not correſpondent to the good gouernaunce of the empire, as a good emperour ſent ouer all Italye for the moſte wyſeſt perſones in lernynge, the moſte famous of renowme, and the mooſte vertuous in dedes. And as in dyuers thynges the infamye is greatter in the yll doinge by malyce, than the faute of the treſpaſſour by weakenes: ſo in dyuers other thynges, the common voyce is more than the ſecrete vertue. For the whyche occaſyon after the aſſemblynge of theſe wyſe menne, the emperour commaunded to examyne them, and to be informed of the bloude of their predeceſſours, of the appoyntement in all their thynges, and of the treatie of their buſynes, and of the credence amonge their neyghbours, and of the purenes of their lyues, and grauitie of theyr perſones, and finally of their ſciences, what they coulde do, and this to be done in an order. The aſtrologiens in aſtronomie, the muſitiens in muſyke, the oratours in their arte of rhetorike: and ſome in other ſciences. And this not in one daye, but in many: and not onely by informacyon of other, but he wolde knowe hit by his owne propre experience. Thus they were all examyned, ſoo that there was none lefte behynde. And as for perfecte knowlege of thynges, wherin we haue great affection, it behoueth to haue ſtraunge aduyſe,

clere vnderſtandynge, and propre experience: ſo the emperour commanded to choſe out of dyuers a fewe, and out of fewe the wyſeſt, and of the wyſeſt the moſte experte, moſte worthy, and moſte auncient. And accordyng to the vii. artes lyberall there was aſſigned to euery ſcience two mayſters: ſo that the prince was one, and the mayſters xiiii. This renowme that the Emperour ſente ouer all, to haue mayſters for his ſonne the prince, cauſed to come to hym moo wyſe men from ſtraunge countreys, than of the marches and neyghbours of Rome. The good emperour conſiderynge that it was no reaſon, that ſuche as came to his ſeruice, ſhulde returne myſcontented, ſome with ioyfull wordes, ſome vpon certayne hope, and ſome with giftes and preſentes were diſpatched, ſoo that they were all pleaſed. And if this doinge was renowmed by the reporte of the wiſe men, it was no leſſe vertuous by the wiſedome and worthynes of the emperour, to ſende them home ſoo well content. For he ſent them away as well ſatisfied that were ouercome, as they were cōtented that ouercam them. And certaynly they had all reaſon, for ſome bare the ſwete wordes and ſatisfienge of the father: and ſomme aboode there charged with the enterpriſe of the ſonne. Yet the good emperour, not being contented with this, commanded that theſe mayſters ſhoulde be lodged in his palayes, and eate in his preſence, and acconpany his perſonne, to ſe if theyr lyfe were conformable to their ſcience, and whether their pleſant and wel couched wordes, agreed in effect with theyr warkes. It was a meruaylous thinge to ſe the ſtudy and thought that the emperour had to regard them, as well in goynge as fedynge.
         
         
            
            ¶Howe it chaunced to fyue wyſe men, wherfore they were put out of the emperours houſe. Cap. vii.
            
               IN the month of Septembre, the .xi. day therof, in halowyng the feaſt of the Emperours natiuitie, in the ſame houſe where as he was borne, in the place of moūt Celio: As a trewande and foole dothe lyke hym ſelfe, and ſemblably as he is accuſtomed to doo: And lyke as oone dothe the ſemblable thynges and cuſtomes, that he is wonte to doo: ſo the emperour ſet more his intention on wyſe men, than his eies on fooles. He ſawe .v. of them ſatte beatyng the pauement with their feete, and aroſe frome their places, clappynge theyr handes, ſpeakynge lowde, and laughyng excedyngely, the whiche was noo leſſe marked of the emperour than beholden. Whan the feaſte was done, he called them aſyde, and ſayde: Frendes lette abyde with me the pitiefull goddis, and lette the good dedes go with you. I haue choſen you to thentent that foles ſhuld be conuerted to wyſe men, but I ſee wyſe men become foles. Do ye not knowe, that with the fyre of myxture golde is drawen, and by the lyghtnes of fooles wyſe men are proued? Certaynly the fyne gold defendeth his qualities in the quycke fournayes: and lykewiſe the wyſe man ſheweth his vertues amonge fooles. Wote ye not, that a foole can not be knowen amonge fooles, nor a wyſe manne amonge ſage folke? Amonge wyſe men, the fole is made bryght, and amonge foles wyſe men do ſhyne. Do you not knowe, what ſhame it is to make the diſciples of foles, maſters of princis? Knowe ye not, that of the couragious vnderſtandyng procedethe the compoſytion of the bodye, the reſte of the perſon to be the temperance of the tonge? What profiteth

it you to haue an experte tongue, a quicke memorie, a clere vnderſtandynge, great ſcience, profounde eloquence, or a ſwete ſtyle, if with all theſe graces ye haue a wycked wyll? Wherfore wyl wiſe men haue their wordes ſo diſtincte and moderate, if their wordes be lyght? And to thentent that it ſhulde not ſeme to you that I ſpeake of pleaſure, I wyl brynge to you an antyke lawe of Rome. In the ſeuenthe table of the lawes of our fathers was written theſe wordes: We commaunde, that a more greuous chaſtyſement be gyuen to the wyſe manne for a lyght dede done openly, than to a ſecrete murderer. O iuſte lawe and iuſt men that ordeyned it. For the ſymple labourer ſleeth but one with his knyfe in his angre, but he yt is wyſe ſleeth many with the euyll example of his lyuynge. Curiouſely I haue regarded, that Rome begynneth to declyne, when our ſenate fayllethe of meke and wyſe Senatours, and multyplieth with theſe ſerpentines. The holy ſenate was adorned with olde prudent perſons: And not without teares, I ſaye at this houre it is full of ianglers and lyers. Auncientely in the ſcoles of Grece was taught onely wordes, leauynge the werkes: and than in Rome was taught to do werkes, and leaue wordes. But nowe it is contrarye, for nowe in grece the lyers and ianglers are banyſhed, and hath ſente them to Rome: and Rome hath baniſhed and ſent the good wyſe menne in to Grece: and in this maner I deſyre rather to be banyſhed into Grece with wyſe menne, than to abyde in Rome with fooles. To the prayſe of a good man (I ſweare to you my frendes) that whyles I was yonge, I ſawe in the ſenate the philoſopher Criſippus (broughte vp with good Traian) ſpeake oftentymes: and he was ſo ſwete in his wordes, that many tymes he was harde more than thre houres to gyther: And he neuer ſpake word but it was of eternall memorye. And whan ſo euer he wente

out of the ſenate, I neuer ſawe hym do dede, wherby he deſerued to haue greuous peyn. Certainly it was a meruaylous thynge to ſe &amp; here the eſtimation of his eloquence, &amp; the infamie of his perſon. All Rome was abaſſhed of his high eloquence: and all Rome and Italy were ſclandered with his wycked werkes. The proſperitie of Rome dured CCC. yere. And ſo long Rome was Rome, as it had ſimplicitie in wordes, and grauitie in workes. One thynge I ſhal ſhewe you▪ which is great confuſion to them alyue, and great admyration of them that be deed, that of all the auncient men I neuer redde a lyght word that they ſpake, nor an yuell dede that they dydde. What thynge was ſene than in that glorious worlde, but to reioyce in ſo glorious wyſe men? And nowe at this daye the worlde is ſo corrupted, bycauſe there is ſo many yong corrupt, ſurely I haue greatter enuie of their dedes thanne of our wrytynges. Their fewe wordes and good werkes haue lefte vs example of greate admyration. And the wyſe men of this tyme teache vs openly, and write vs ſecretely doctrines of pardition. Than by this that I haue ſayde, and by other examples that I ſhall ſay, ye maye knowe, what I meane. Whan the realme of Acaye ſubmitted his peryllous hornes and his proude heed, to the ſwete obeyſance of the empire, they drewe theym to this condicion, that they wolde haue benne the hooſtes of the garnyſons of all Aſye, and not diſciples of the oratours of Rome. At that ſeſon there was in Rome a great lorde, ambaſſadour of Acaye, temperate in wordes, and honeſte of lyuynge, with a whyte heed: He was enquired of the ſenate, why he was ſo cruel, to leade into his countrey for men of warre, poore and couetous ſquiers, and leaue wyſe men of greatte harte. He aunſwered with ſuche loue as he had to his countrey, and with ſuche grauitie as longed to ſuche a perſon, and alſo

with ſuche hardynes as his offyce required, ſaying O fathers cōſcriptes, O happy peple, It is .ii. days ſyth I yete any thynge, and .ii. dayes ſythe I ſlepte, curſynge the fatall deſtenyes of fortune, that hath brought me into Italye, and lamenynge vnto the goddis, that kepe me in this lyfe, bycauſe my ſpirite is betwene the harde anuelde and the importunate hammer, where as I do ſe all is as harde as the anuelde, wheron the hammer often ſtrykethe. The thynge moſte peryllous amonge all perylles, is to make election. ye conſtrayne me to choſe, and myne vnderſtandynge canne not attayne therto: and the goddis doo not ſhewe me, what I haue to chooſe. If I leade garryſons of menne of armes, it ſhall be verye noyfull to the familyes: if I brynge aduocates, it ſhall be peryllous for the common welthe. Sorowfull that I am, what ſhall I do? Oh heuy and vnhappy realme, that abydeth for theym, and ye cruel, that commaundeth them. Than ſythe hit is thus, I determyne me to leade them, that ſhall waſte our goodes, and ſpende them, rather thanne thoſe that ſhould corrupte and breake our cuſtomes. For a legyon and an army by neceſſitie may put to affliction and ſorowe onely a people: But an oratour or an Aduocate by his malyce, may corrupte a hole realme. Than ſayde the emperour to theſe wyſe men: Frendes, howe greatte is the credence of ignorant people, and loſſe of lerned men? Wherfore ſhuld they of Acaie rather gyue meate to poore ſowldiours, men of armes, than to haue for their neyghbours oratours and wyſe ſpeakynge aduocates? So whan this communycation of the emperour was ended, the .v. greate mayſters wente awaye with greatte ſhame, and the .ix. other taryed with great feare. In all this whyle it paſſed not two monethes after, that the prince Comode was come from his norces, where as he hadde lerned the doctrine of ſuckyng

of breſtes. Alſo he was but of tender age, and not of great delycate vnderſtandyng. This prince Comode was borne in Rome on the mount Celio, and nouriſhed at the gate of Hoſtie. He was more derely beloued of Fauſtina his mother, then hated of Marcus Aurelius his father. And to ſpeake with all due honour among them, the mother held her for certayne to be the chyldes mother: and the chylde accordynge to his cuſtomes was moche lyke his mother: and the father was in doubte, whether he were his ſonne, bicauſe he reſembled but lytel in vertues to the father.

               AL theſe matters beinge paſte, the good emperour for to eſteme the thynge that he hadde done, and to pouruey for that he had to do, he called aſyde the nyne wyſe men, and ſayde to them, There is greatte fame in Rome of that I haue done in thempire, to do ſuche dilygence as to diſcouer all the wyſe men, and of the curioſitie that I haue ſhewed as in certaynynge of the beſte. Of trouth yf ye be wyſe, ye can not be ſclaundered of any thynge. The annoyance of yl thynges commeth of wyſedome and vertue, but the admyration of good thynges procedethe of ſmalle vnderſtandynge or leſſe experience. The wyſe perſon wyl ſuffre none admyration. To ſhewe at the fyrſt bronte mocion in euery thynge, ſheweth to be conſtant in nothynge. I haue made ſtrayt examynatiō amonge you, for ſo ought ſuche to paſſe as ſhulde be admytted to ſtrayte amytyes. New amities is wery in thre dayes: and euer haue I ſene and proued by experience, that frendes lyghtelye taken,

are lyghtely lefte agayne. I chaunced in companye of an auncient Romayne, whiche was all whyte for aege: and bycauſe he merited it, I called hym father, and he for loue and nurture called me ſonne: the whiche in caſe of aduenture enquyred many thynges of me, but I wolde make hym none aunſwere. Than he ſayde theſe wordes to me: Son beholde, In the lawe of frendſhyp it is written, that the frende in all thynges truſteth to his frend, firſt regardynge who is his frende. Surely this councel was good. The curious man of armes (if he wil bye a horſe) fyrſte he wyll ſe hym renue and aſſayed, or he ſpeake of the ſale of hym: if he pleaſe hym not, thoughe he myghte haue hym for a leſſe price, he wyll not haue hym: yf he pleaſe hym, what ſo euer the price is ſet, he wyll not leaue hym. Than it is a lefull thynge, that the beaſte be examyned and felte er he be had into the ſtable. In lyke wyſe a manne ſhulde be examyned, er he be receyued in to amytie. And yf the horſe that eateth but hey, ſtrawe, and otes, be lefte for one yll tatche, moche more the frende, whiche is the inteſtyne of the harte, and oughte to kepe our ſecretes and affectyons, for dyuers fautes ought not to be receyued in to the ſame. There was a philoſopher named Ariſpo, the fyrſte that was in the tyme of Silla and Marius, who ſayde, that frendes ought to be lyke good horſes: That is to ſay, that they oughte to haue a lyttell heed by humble conuerſation: quicke of herynge, to the entent that they be redye whan they are called: a ſofte mouthe, to thende that theyr tongue be temperate: The houe of the foote harde, to ſuffer trauaylle: and theyr handes open to doo good dedes: their fete ſure to perſeuer in amitie: a baye colour for his good renowme: And fynally the hors retournethe, that is the manuall frende: And thereto is ioyned theſe wordes: That is, that he be without curbes or byttes: and that he

maye go where as any fatall deſtenyes tourneth the brydell and reyne of fortune. The goddes vnderſtande me, though that men can not atteyne therto or compriſe it. Retournynge than to the purpoſe, I wyl yee knowe, bycauſe I haue taken you for frendes, not to putte you awaye at length. And though that cherytrees produceth theyr floures in Februarie, we abyde not to haue the cheries but in Maye. Frendes oughte to be as molberies, that in ſuche tyme producethe their beries, whiche is theyr fruite, that they feare not the froſtes of Maye, as the vynes doo: nor the myſtes of Octobre, as the peches and quinces do. I wyll not that they come whan the proſperitie is good, and go away whan the fortune is nought. For that is no pointe of true frendes. As the lyes of wynes cauſeth dronkardes to vomyt in the tauernes, lyke wyſe aduerſitie driueth away faynt frendes out of the houſe, bycauſe the ſeruice is not acceptable, without the wyl be knowen of hym that dothe it. Than holde you ſure of my contentation, ſythe that I haue it of your warkes. I come nowe to the effecte of our pourpoſe. I haue taken you for to be mayſters of this chylde: and regarde, that I haue taken you fewe amonge many, to thende that my ſonne ſhuld be noted amonge fewe. His nurſes at the gate of Hoſtie haue gyuen hym two yeres ſucke of theyr mylke, and his mother Fauſtyne hath gyuen hym other two yeres to ſporte hym in the Palays, And I lyke a good father wyll gyue hym .xx. yeres of chaſtiſement. It ſoore diſpleaſethe Fauſtyne his mother to leaue hym ſo ſone, and I am ſory that I toke hym ſo late. It is no meruayle, for theſe womenne with theyr lyghtnes, and theſe chyldren with theyr ſmalle knowlege, occupy them ſelfe in thinges preſent: But worthy wyſe men oughte to thynke on that is paſſed, and alſo to ordeyne for that that is preſent, and with great ſtudy to

prouyde for the tyme to comme. I thynke on euery daye in the yere, and of the daye that the goddis haue gyuen me, and of the day that I gyue vnto you. The goddis to me, and I to you doo gyue hym mortall to be as a manne, and than you to me and I to the goddis do render him immortall to be wyſe. What wyll ye that I ſaye more? Certainly god hath made hym man amonge men by the ſowle: and I haue engendred hym a beaſte amonge beaſtes by the fleſhe, ye ſhall make hym a god amonge goddis by ſhape. I aſſertayne you of one thynge, whyche is, I haue not gyuen to my chylde but mortalle fleſſhe, wherwith he ſhall take an ende of his lyfe: but ye ſhall gyue hym doctryne, wherwith his memorie ſhall neuer peryſhe. If his youth knewe the weake and faynt fleſhe that I haue gyuen hym, and that his dull vnderſtandyng wold reache to the wiſedome that ye maye gyue hym, he ſhulde calle you fathers, and me an ylle ſtepfather. And thoughe he ſaye not ſoo, yet I confeſſe it, that is, that the naturalle fathers of the fleſhe are ſtepfathers of nobleneſſe, ſythe that we gyue the naturalitie of them ſubiecte to ſo many mutabilities, and bonde and captiue to ſoo many myſeries. For certayne ye ſhall be iuſte fathers to hym, yf as nowe ye canne enable his fleſhe in good cuſtomes, and then to bryng his vnderſtandynge to be occupied with high ſciences. And ſyrs, repute it nat ſmalle, that I committe to your charge and arbytrement, that thynge whiche pryncis oughte mooſte to regarde, that is, to ſe to whom they commytte the nouryſſhynge of their chylderne. To be mayſters of prynces in erthe, is to haue the offyce of the goddis that ben in heuen. For they gouern him that hath cure to gouerne vs: They endoctrine hym that ſhoulde teache vs: they ſhewe vnto hym, that ought to ſhewe vs: Chaſtyſe hym that oughte to chaſtiſe vs: and finally they commaunde one, the whiche

afterwarde aloone maye commaunde all the worlde. What wyl ye that I ſhal ſay more? For certayne they that haue the charge of a prince, be the gouernall of the ſhyp, The ſtanderde of an army, the gouernance of people, the guyde of wayes, the ſhylde of kynges, the treaſure of all, bycauſe they haue amonge theyr handes hym that afterwarde ought to gouerne all the worlde. And furthermore to the entente that ye haue hym in more eſtimation, I wyll tell you, that in gyuynge my ſonne vnto you, I doo gyue you more, than if I had gyuen you a realme. The pure &amp; clene lyuinge of the ſonne alyue, is the gloryous fame of his father that is deade. For of hym, that the ſonne truſteth in his lyfe, dependeth the renowme of the father that is deade. Thus haue ye hadde the goddis atte wylle, and the bryttel deſtenies of fortune happy to you, as vnto this howre ye haue not watched with chyldren of ſtraungers. Fro hensforthe wake ye with the prince, which is the profite of al other. And take good hede my frendes, that there is greatter difference in bryngyng vp of princis chyldren, than to teache yonge boyes of the common people. The moſte part of them, that come to ſcholes, come for to lerne to ſpeake, but I delyuered not my ſonne Commode to you to lerne hym to ſpeake many wordes, but for to ſette hym in the way to do good dedes. The glorie of foliſhe fathers is to ſe their children vanquyſhe other in diſputynge: but my glorie and ioye is to ſee my ſonne ſurmounte other in vertue: for the glorye of the Grekes was to ſpeake moche and to do lyttell, and the glorie of the Romayns is to doo moche and to ſpeake but lyttell.
         
         
            ¶Howe the mayſters of princis oughte to kepe them from vyces. Capitulo. ix.
            
               
               MArcus Aurelius folowing his purpoſe, ioyned this to his foreſayd wordes, and ſayd: Regarde well my frendes, and forget not, that I truſte you in myn honour, who am my ſonnes father, and of the ſtudye of Comode my ſonne, and of the glorie of Rome my naturall countrey, And of the ſolace and reſt of Rome, whiche is my ſubiecte: Of the gouernance of Italy, whiche is your countrey: And aboue all thynges of the peace and tranquillitie of our common welthe. Than he that is put in truſte with ſuche adminiſtration of other, hath no cauſe to ſlepe. Nowe lette vs come to more partycular thynges. Regarde as nowe, what thynge is moſte conuenable for my ſonne, whiche as a yonge colte wold go play in the grene medowes, and noyſome ſhall be the keper to hym, and a thynge peynefulle to kepe hym therfro. The firſt thyng, wherof I praye you, is to gyue hym a ſtronge bridel, and a ſharpe bytte, to thentent that he be well mouthed, ſo that none take hym with lyes. The greatteſt faut that can be in men of honeſtie, is to ſpare the trouthe, and not to be veritable: And the greatteſte vyllanye in a vyllayne is to be gyuen in largeſſe of lyes. Sette good order vppon hym. Take hede to his handes, to the entente that he accuſtome hym not to demaunde to play at the tables and dyce with ſuche as be loſte and noughte. The greatteſt token, that a prince wyll looſe and dyſtroye the empire, is whan in his yonge age, he is knowen to be vycious in play. The play is ſuche a vyce, that who ſo euer it bytethe, hit is lyke the bytynge of a madde dogge, the whiche rage endureth vnto deathe. I recommende to you my chylde, though he be yong, make hym ſad and moderate. Certaynly it is not ſo great a glorye vnto a prince

to haue the crowne on his heed, nor a chayn of gold about his ſhulders, nor the ſceptre in his hande, nor the greatte company and garde that he hath aboute hym, as to ſhewe ſadneſſe from his youthe. The open honeſtie ſuppliethe many fautes and debilities. Spare not to caſte on hym a ſtronge chayne, and to tye hym faſt, that he goo not to delytes and vanities. For an effeminate perſone neuer hath ſpirite to any hye or noble dedes. I am greately ſatisfied with that the teacher of Nero ſaid to his diſciple: Though I wyſt that god wolde pardon me, and that men knew no myſſe of me, yet for the vilany of the fleſſhe, I wolde not ſynne in the fleſhe. Surely they were good wordes, and yl borne awaye of Nero. Let not yet go the reyne. For yf he ſee the yonge mares, he wyll neigh or bray if he ſee tyme. The vyce of the fleſhe in all tymes, in all ages, and in al eſtates holdeth his ſeaſone or courſe, yf it paſſe not in the grene age of chyldehode, caſtynge of the reyne of reaſon, and ſtryking with the ſpurres of the fleſhe, and blowynge with the trompe of ſenſualite: Takyng the brydell in the tethe with a furious wyll, rennyng through mountaynes and woddes after the mare: In leauynge her goinge but ſoftely, and in the ouertakynge moche leſſe. And than afterwarde being therin deliberate, the body remayneth impotent, the vnderſtādinge acloyed and blynded, the reaſon troubled, the good name loſte, and yet neuertheleſſe at the laſte the fleſhe remayneth fleſhe. What remedy for this? I fynde none other but that a greate quycke fyre, couered and laden with erthe, dieth. And whan the vitious man is layde in his graue, he maketh an ende and may neuer correcte hym ſelfe. Wherfore I aduyſe you to gyue noo place to this yonge chylde to be vycious. And in the chaſtyſing of hym, gyue noo reſpyte, though he be younge, and my chyld, and well loued and cheryſhed with his mother, and

though he be the only heire of thempire. With chyldren of a ſtranger crueltie is tiranny, but with a mans own childe pitie is the occaſion of his loſſe in tyme to come. It is ſhewed vs by trees, howe we ought to noriſhe our childrē. Of trouthe the cheſtain trees bryng forth the ſoft ſwete cheſtnutte out of the ſharpe prickinge &amp; hard huſke: And on the nut tres amonge the ſwete ſofte leaues, is nouriſſhed the harde nutte. Applieng this to our purpoſe, we haue ſeene a pyteful father, bringe forthe a cruell ſon, and a cruel father a piteful ſonne. He that was lerned amonge all other lerned, and renoumed among al other renoumed, Ligurgus king of the Lacedemoniens, in giuinge his lawes in his realme, I remembre to haue red therin theſe wordes: We commaunde as kynges, &amp; pray as men, that all thing be forgiuen to them that be olde and broken: and to them that be yonge and luſty, to diſſimule for a tyme: &amp; nothing to be forgiuen to very yonge chyldren. In good ſoth theſe were good wordes ſpoken of ſuche a perſone, and ſemeth reaſone. For it is reaſon that the hors, that hathe runne and paſſed his courſe of cariage, ſhoulde reſte hym. And who that hath paſſed rightouſely, it is Iuſtice that he be ſuffred in reſte. And the chylde that wyll paſſe reaſonne, ought to be reformed. Cauſe hym to be alwayes occupied in vertuous actes. For if the vnderſtandynge be dulled, and the bodye ſlouthfull in ſuche aege, with greatte difficultie wylle they drawe to thynges that be ſtraunge to their delectations, bycauſe that the lyghteneſſe is in the heed, and reaſonne vnder the eyes. His youthe wylle demaunde you ſome recreation, whiche ye ſhall conſider, ſo it be not often nor to ſeldome. Fyrſte that it be by reaſonne: Secondely that they be taken in noble exercyſes. Take hede, For I gyue not my ſonne vnto you, that ye ſhoulde gyue hym recreation, but onely for to teache hym.

The henne hauynge her egges vnder her wynges, in that ſeaſon gothe not abrode in the yardes, and though the egges be not her owne, yet ſhe hatchethe theym, as yf they were her owne. For this cauſe at this tyme in Rome of a C. diſciples .lxxxx. cometh forth withoute doctryne, for yf theyr maſters waſt two houres in doctrine with them, they leſe with thē .xx. houres in mockerye. And therof it is, that of the ſmal grauitie of the mayſter, ſpryngeth great boldnes and lyttell ſhame in the diſciple. Beleue me frendes, that the teachers to princis, and mayſters to diſciples, profite more in one day with good exaumples, than in a yere with many leſſons. My ſonne ſeynge you drawe to vertues, wyll drawe to the ſame, if he ſe you ſtudie, he wylle ſtudy, if he ſe you peaſible, he wyll be ſtyll: he ſeinge you temperate in fedynge, wyl eate but lyttel: ſeing you ſhamfaſt, he wyll feare you, ſeinge you reſtefulle, he wyll reſte, and if ye do contrary, he wyll do contrarye. This ſurelye is true, for the auncient men onely with the euyll that they ſe, eyther do they corrupte their bodyes, or ſclaunder theyr owne iugementes, as chyldern do, that can ſay nothynge but that they here: nor do nothynge but that they ſe. I wil alſo that the prince my ſonne lerne the .vii. artes lyberalle. For I haue taken many of you, to thentent that ye ſhulde teache hym moche. And if at the laſte we ſhulde be ſorowfull, bycauſe he hath not lerned all, we ſhal not be ſorie, yf he knowe moche, nor thynke his tyme yll ſpent, nor be begyled, in ſaying, that he knoweth inough of that ſo yōge a chylde ſhulde haue to gouerne and rule thempire. A very philoſopher after the lawe of lygnage, ought to haue ſpeche at place and tyme conuenient, to fyght in the felde, and to ſpeke in the ſenate. If myn owne remembrance begyle me not, amonge myn antiquities I haue brought a ſtone out of Grece, the whiche Pythagoras ye philoſopher

helde at the gates of his ſchole, wherin was written with his owne handes, theſe wordes: He that knoweth not, that he ought to know, is a brute beaſte amonge men: He that knoweth no more, than he hath nede of, is a man amonge brute beaſtes: He that knoweth all, that may be knowen, is a god amonge men. O moſte highe wordes, Glorious is the hande that wrote them, the whiche not at the gates, as they were than, oughte to be written, but within mens breeſtes they ſhoulde be paynted and grauen. Our forefathers toke the laſte ſentence of this philoſopher, and the fyrſte rebuke abydeth to vs theyr laſt chyldren. For certayne amonge the Grekes and Lacedemoniens was atteyned as moche fame by theyr philoſophers and conqueſtes, as by theyr writinges, which they haue lefte vs. And our former emperours gatte no leſſe loue in theyr empire, by theyr profound eloquence, thanne they feared all the worlde by their noble triumphes. For a profe wherof, beholde Iulius Ceſar, whiche beinge in the myddell of his campe, with his lyfte hande wolde holde his ſpeare, and his penne in his righte hande. Ne he neuer lefte of his armour, but forthewith he toke his bokes. We muſt not lay excuſes, ſayinge with them that be ignorante, that the lyberall artes are to hye, and the tyme that we haue, verye ſhorte. For certayne the diligence of men in tymes paſte, reproueth our ſlouth at this day. One thyng I do ſe, that in a ſhorte whyle we lerne all yll, but in a longe ſeaſon we can not lerne goodneſſe. Wyll ye ſe, what is our fortunes and deſtenyes, and in what thoughte the goddes doo kepe vs, that for to do one good dede we lacke tyme, and for to do many ſhrewde tournes, we haue to moche tyme. I wyll ſay no more, but that I wolde my chylde ſhulde be nouryſhed in ſuche wyſe, that he ſhoulde lerne the feare of god, the ſcience of philoſophers, the vertues of aunciente Romayns,

the quietnes of you his mayſters, and the goodneſſe of all them that be good, as he hathe taken of me to be the heire of the empire. I proteſt to the immortal goddis, to whom I truſte for to go: and proteſt to the high capitoll, where my bones ſhall be brent, that neyther Rome now in my lyfe, nor the heuens in tyme to come ſhall curſe me after my deth, if by yll lyuynge my ſonne ſhoulde leſe the common welthe, yf by your ſmall chaſtiſement, ye ſhal be cauſe of the loſſe of the empire.
         
         
            ¶Howe themperour Marucs nouriſhed the princeſſes his doughters. Cap. x.
            
               MArcus Aurelius the emperour hadde but two ſonnes, that is to wytte, the prince Comode and Veriſſime: He hadde fowre doughters by Fauſtyne his wyfe, legittimate and heyres of thempyre. This emperour was excedyng diligent for to nouriſhe his daughters. As ſoone as any of them were borne, forthwith they were put to nours into ſome ferme without Rome: He wolde neuer ſuffre any of his chyldren, ſonnes nor doughters, to be nouryſſhed within the walles of Rome: Nor conſente, that they ſhoulde ſucke the breaſtes of delycate women. He hated delycate and gaye nourſes, and they that were laborous homely and holſome he loued, and to them and none other he betoke his chyldren to nouryſhe, and he wolde neuer agree, that they ſhoulde be brought home to his howſe. He was wont to ſay in his ſportynge: I haue more adoo to contente theſe nouryſſes, than to mary my doughters. Homere ſhewethe, that in Grece there dyed Arthemio, that was kynge of Argiue, withoute any ſonne to inheryte: and the nourſe, that hadde nouryſſhed hym, with all

her myght demanded the realme for a ſonne of hers, whyche hadde ſucked of the ſame mylke, that the ſayde kynge had done, allegynge, that ſyth they were bothe nouryſſhed togyther, and ſucked one mylke, that they bothe ſhuld enheryte one realme. This ſayde Homer, to reproue the nouryces of Grece, whiche toke more preſumption for nouriſſhynge of princis, than quenes dyd in bearynge of theym. Therfore this noble Marcus Aurelius emperour, wolde not that his doughters alonely ſhoulde ſucke groſſe and rude mylke, but he wolde not agree, that any reuerence honour or ſeruice ſhulde be doone vnto them, as it belongeth to the chyldren of ſo hygh princis to be doone, and as the cuſtome is to be doone. On a daye as the ſayde emperour was at ſupper, a foole named Galindo, at whoſe wordes the emperour often toke pleaſure, ſayde, Syr yeſterdaye I came from Salon, and fro the gate of Hoſtie, and there I ſawe the emperours chyldren goo lyke labourers, and I ſe here in thy houſe labourers chyldren go lyke emperours: Telle me, why do ye diſſimule as a wyſe man, for I that am but a foole, vnderſtandethe hit not. The emperour aunſwered: O Galyndo, bycauſe that yet at this tyme, Rome is not Rome, all thoughe throughe all the worlde hit be renowmed Rome. In my ſelfe I fynde farre more aſſuraunce, that my chyldren begynne lyke poore labourers, and ende as ryche emperoures, thanne to begynne as ryche emperours, and ende as poore ſquiers. Doeſt thou not knowe why Italy is nowe loſt? They wolde haue theyr chyldren to be wantonly and delycately nouryſſhed, and wyl not ſuffre theym to lyue in trauayle, and to leaue theyr heires poore and nedy, and theym ſelfe to ende in greatte peryl. This aunſwere was ſo excellent in fame, that it was euer taken for a prouerbe in Rome. Whan this emperours doughters were of two yere olde,

incontinent he prouided women and mayſtreſſes for to teche theym. Sextus Cheronenſe ſaythe, that he ſerched amonge the auncient matrones of Rome, which were cleaneſt of lyfe, mooſte eſtemed of good fame, of nobleneſſe of bloudde, of ſadde wytte, and that had ben mooſte vſed in bringing vp of princis chyldren. This emperour was ſoo thoughtefull in the orderynge and teachynge of his chyldren, that he wolde haue no woman, but if ſhe were of .l. yere of age at the leaſte, and .x. yere a widowe, and that ſhe hadde nouriſhed a. C. chyldren, doughters of ſenatours. Imagining, that ſhe that had medled in ſo many thynges of other mens, ſhulde not be ignorant in her owne. After that he hadde prouyded theſe mayſtreſſes, he cauſed his doughters to be broughte to theyr houſes, and there gaue them theyr charge. And frō the birth of any of his doughters, he wolde neuer conſent, that they ſhuld come into his palays, tyll they ſhulde haue huſbandes. It chanced, that Fauſtine the empreſſe chylded a doughter, and ſhe beinge certified, that it was lyke her, and very faire, moued with a ſoft herte of womanheed, and with a motherly affection, prayed themperour, that the ſayde chylde myghte be noryſhed in her preſence, ſythe euery man ſayd, the chylde was ſo fayre and ſo lyke vnto them. The emperour aunſwered and ſayde: Fauſtyne, for thoſe thynges that all other haue ſayde to you, dothe it beſeme you, to demaunde this of me? But I that haue red in this caſe, and in other caſes haue ſene, in no maner I ought to condiſcende therto. Do you not knowe, that the tyme, that the doughter is nouryſſhed in the houſe, the father is charged with thoughte, the mother with wantō flatteringes, enuy in the bretherne, boldnes in the doughter, and foly in the nouryce. I wolde wit of you, if ſhe were nouryſſhed in the houſe: what profyttethe it, if her mayſtres teache her ſaddeneſſe and honeſtie

with her wordes: and we entice her to lewdenes with our workes and dedes? what profiteth it, if the doughter deſerue chaſtiſemente, and the mother flatter and make her wanton? More reaſon it were, that your doughter ſhould folowe the good doinges of you, that are her mother, than the wordes of the ſtraunge wydowe, that is her mayſtres. Marke well Fauſtyne, if ye oughte to reioyce at her chyldyſhe toys. Remembre, that the pleſure of yonge chyldren, is but chyldyſſhe trifles. But if you nouryſhe theym not well, as the pleaſures were ioyful whan they were yonge, ſo whan they be olde, to refrayne them, ſhal be greatter diſpleaſure. Therfore, if you be vertuous, with drawe theyr iapynge trifles as nowe, for them that ſhall be vertuous. I wyll tel you one thynge, I wolde rather my doughters, in myne abſence, ſhulde be diſciples to vertues, than to be mayſtreſſes in lewdeneſſe in my preſence. And ſythe it is ſo, I deſire you, require it not of me. And I deſire you, that it be not ſoo. I am importune on you, that ye be not importunate on me. I pray you, that you pray not me. Orels I commaunde you, that you demaunde it no more of me. This harde aunſwere of the father, ceaſſed the importunitie and pitiefulle requeſte of the mother. Thus Fauſtine, all fearefulle, ſeinge the father within the walles of Rome, durſte not go ſe her doughter without, but as priuely as ſhe myght.
         
         
            ¶Howe Marcus themperour dyd choſe and proued his ſonnes in lawe. Cap. xi.
            
               LIke wiſe as Marcus Aur. the emperour ſurmounted in vertues al mortall men, yt died, ſoo for certayne in mariage of his doughters he ſemed to be kin to the goddes, yt euer lyue: &amp; by

the grace and gyfte of god, or by his fortune, he was as happy in vertuous ſonnes in lawe, as greatly infortunate of dyſhoneſt doughters. After the dethe of the good olde man, with the ſmalle thoughte of the prynce his ſonne in his gouernance, and vngoodly fame of his doughtes in theyr lyuinge, it ſemed to haue made an ende of the gloryous memorie of the father, but if it were by the ſouerayne goodnes of his ſonnes in lawe, that he hadde choſe by his lyfe tyme. It is dayely ſene, that the loſſe of the father by euyll chyldrene, is wonne by vertuous ſonnes in lawe. Than Marcus Aurelius, in choſinge huſbandes for his doughters, he toke not of dyuers, that the vanitye of the worlde offered hym: but of a fewe, that of manye folkes were eſtemed to be of good behauour, and that to his ſemynge were ſuche in dede. And as in mariages all the errour is to couete goodes that be in the pourſe, and not to examyne the perſone that is broughte to the houſe, He regardynge this, maried not his doughters to ſtraung kynges, but to naturall borne Senatours, not to ſuche as diſcended from hygh lygnage, as were the Sipions, Fabricions, and torquates: but to ſuche that with theyr vertues reyſed newely good lygnages: Nor he maried theym not to ſuche as were preſumptuous of the prowes and dedes of theyr predeceſſours: but to them that reſplendyſhed by the dedes of theyr owne perſonnes. Nor of trouthe he choſe none that were very riche, but ſuche as were vertuous: nor ſuche as were ſoone moued, but ſuche as were quiete: not the hyghe mynded: but to the moderate, that were no boſters, but ſhamefaſt: no bablers, but ſmall ſpekers: no quarellers, but ſuffrers: not to preſumptuous, but to them that were meke, not to haſty men, but to them that were pacient: not to them that were eſtemed amonge the commons, but vnto them that deſerued laude amonge

wyſe men. In this maner he truſted no perſon, for he maried not his doughters to ſuche as were prayſed a farre of▪ but to them that of longe tyme had ben proued nerehand. In good faythe herein his reaſone was good. For in the thynge that towcheth a mannes honour, he that is wyſe ought not to truſt in the onely information of ſtraungers: Nor he is not wyſe, that is ſo hardy, to doo al thynges by his owne ſemynge and opinyon. And he is but a ſymple perſone, that wyll do all thynge after the opinion of ſtrangers. And in theſe poyntes the emperour Marcus had a good reſpecte to kepe theym: In walkynge good reſt, In ſpeakynge great eloquence, in eatynge good temperance: In anſwering great ſubtiltie: In his ſentences and determynations great grauitie. And therfore in this caſe of maryage he was full of grauitie, tyl he was therin determyned. And this onely came not of hym, but of other, whan they came to pray hym. It befell that in a feaſt of the god Ianus, the emperour goinge to the campe of Mars, vppon a luſty hors fyers and flyngynge, he mette ſoo rudely with a trūpettour, that courſed as a knyght vpon a hors, that with the ſtroke of metyng, the trumpetour was ouerthrowen with his horſe, ſo that he was ſlayne, and themperours hors legge broken, and his owne fote hurte, and his arme out of ioynte. So greattely encreaced his hurt, that he was in perylle, Italye in heuyneſſe, and all Rome was in doubte of his lyfe. And bycauſe a fewe days afore that, he had communication of a maryage for his thyrde doughter, named Matrina, for the determination that he ſhulde haue made the ſame day, great ſuite was made to hym. But for the great peyne of his arme, and the bloude that was congeled in his bodye, and the anguyſſhe that was at his harte, as for the demaunde that was offered hym, he dyfferred the aunſwere tyll an nother daye. The

whyche daye commen, in open preſence he ſayde in this manier.
         
         
            ¶What the emperour Marcus ſayd to the father of a yonge man that wolde marye one of his doughters. Cap. xii.
            
               OFtentimes I haue ſene in other, and haue proued by experience, that the ſmall conſyderation paſſed, and the great acceleration in buſyneſſes nowe preſent, maketh great inconueniences in tyme to come, onles that at that point the thynge be commytted to the vertue of ſome wyſe perſone, rather than to his owne ſole opinion. Neuer the leſſe in the caſe of mariage, though the father be wiſe, yet without the opinion of an other, he ought not to determyn him lyghtly: For enuyous fortune, thoughe ſhe ſhewe her ſelfe ſomwhat frowarde in all thynges, yet in this caſe of mariage, ſhe ouerthroweth more than in all the other. He that wyll ſpeake of maryage, ought to entre into his owne ſecretenes, and to thynke profoundly theron, as of a thyng that all his welthe lyeth in, his credence, his lyfe, his honour, his good fame, the reſte of his owne perſonne, and his fleſhe, whiche is his chylde. I am of opinion, that yf all wiſe men were molten in a fournayes, they coude not gyue one good counſell to make a mariage: And wold ye that I, whiche am ſimple, ſhuld do it lyghtly by my ſelfe? Truely therin behoueth rype and ſadde counſell. For ones fallen into the peryll therof, none may haue remedy withoute greatter perylle. The renowmed Marcus Portius, whoſe lyuynge was a myrrour in his dayes, and his wordes and counſels remayne for a remembrance, ſayd openly in the ſenate: O noble fathers and happy people, by the

decrees openly proclaimed in places accuſtomed, I know that in a coūſel and ſenate ye ordeyned three thinges, that is, ye vndertoke to make a newe warre agaynſte the Parthes, to continue the enmitie agaynſt the Peniens, and to marie .v. hundred matrones of Rome, to .v.C. knyghtes of Mauritanie. And certaynely I am abaſhed, that amonge wyſe men ſo hyghe affayres ſhulde be ſo ſoone and ſodaynely concluded and determined. To ſatiſfie myn vnderſtandynge, and for the good wylle that I owe to the countrey, I ſhall ſaye one worde, that is, to begyn warre, and to purſue hatred and yll wyll, and to conclude mariages, In theſe cauſes a man ought to aſke counſell of all the men of the worlde, and al the goddis oughte to correct and amende it. And .x.M. counſaylynges wolde be holden vpon eche of theſe thynges. Theſe wordes were worthy of great recommendation. For one thynge by dyuers opinions ought to be determyned: But many thinges by one opinion oughte not to be determyned. And if this be for all thinges, it ſerueth then moſt ſpecially in mariages. My frēdes, ye ſay, that he that offreth hym to be my ſonne in lawe, is greatly deſyred loued and wel named amonge the common people. To ſell ſuche marchandyſe, ſet it not in ſo yll a ſhewe▪ The credence of an honeſt manne lyethe not amonge the common voyce of the people, but amonge philoſophers: not amonge many, but amonge fewe: not among howe many, but what they be. Ye know your ſelfe, that at this houre all that the commons thynke is but a vayne thynge: that they prayſe is falſe: that they condempne is good, that they approue, is nought, that they alowe is ſhamefull: and finally all that they laude, is but folye. Theyr prayſinge begynneth with lyghtnes, their folowynge without order, and it endeth with furie. O howe many haue I ſene in Italye lyke the lies of wyne caſte out

of the ſenate, and after put as fyrebrondes of tauernes in Rome, by whoſe opinions the cōmon welth is gouerned, and with great lyghtnes men put downe, and with no les lyghtnes exalted agayne. Beholde here, that the workes of the people are holden in mockage with wyſe men: and that that is agreed amonge theym, is eſtemed but for vanities with wiſe men. For that that is meale with philoſophers, is eaten but for branne &amp; chaffe with ſymple folke: and contrary wyſe, the meale of the ſymple, is but branne &amp; chaffe amonge wiſe men. Of al that our predeceſſours haue ſyfted, in theſe dayes the chylderne of vanitie worke thereafter, for they wyll be deſyred, and hate to be hated. All ſuche holdeth a generall rule, that euery man that deſyreth to be beloued of euery man openly, can not eſcape fro diuers ſecrete fautes. Shall I tell you, who is beſt beloued nowe adayes? Than harken to me, and I wyll tell you, as moche as it toucheth, to whom it may touche, hurt who it may hurte, fele it who that may fele it. The people loueth hym that can diſſimule with them, and him that is nought, and enuious of them that be good, &amp; alſo ſuche as fauour lyers, &amp; ſetteth trouth aſyde, and ſuche as accompanieth with mankyllers and murtherers, &amp; to be ſerued of theues, and fauoureth quarellers, and purſueth ſuche as be peaſible, delyuereth offenders, and ſleeth innocētis, renometh them that be ſhamefull, and ſhameth them that be of good fame: Finally he is moſt ſet by, yt putteth them that be good fro hym, and is the moſt vayne among them that be vayne. Certaynly there is great ſuſpection to ſette hym amonge wyſe men, that is allowed of all fooles. And the reaſon therof is, that the commons lyghtly loue none but men that with malyce refrayneth them that be vertuous, and letteth the rayne ſlyppe to them that be vicious. Truely wiſe men haue hym as ſuſpect that the commons

deſyre, whiche wyl not be diſpleaſed with his yl doinges. O howe often tymes dothe the goddis permytte the ambicious man in honours, that procureth to do yl many dais without Iuſtice, and dothe not beholde the ſodayne hole loſſe therof with ſhame? Than take this word of me, that in the multitude of men there are fewe to be prayſed, and many to be repreued.
         
         
            ¶Howe a ſon in lawe ought to be well examyned er he be acceptep to his purpoſe. cap. xiii.
            
               NOwe to come to our particular purpoſe. ye amonge you do prayſe this yonge man, and yf his werkes be as your wordes, ye ſhoulde not onely ſay, that he hath merited to be my ſonne in lawe, but rather meriteth to be onely inheritour of the hole empire. And therfore I wolde wytte of you, wherof you can praiſe this your kynſeman, that there be no contraritie betwene his werkes and your wordes. If he be ruſticall, it abateth hym ſoore: if he be of hyghe bloude, he wyll be preſumptuous: if he be ryche, he wylle gyue hym to viciouſnes: if he be pore, he wyl be couetous, if he be valiant, he wyll be ouerbolde: yf he be a cowarde, he is defamed: if he be a greate ſpeaker, he ſhall be a lyer: if he be to lyttelle a ſpeaker, he ſhall be noted as vnwyſe: yf he be faire, he wylle be coueted: if he be foule, he wylle be ielous. Than if he be quite of al theſe, I ſwere to you, that I wyll gyue hym my doughter Matrine with all my hart. I do not ſay this vnto you, bicauſe I ſuppoſe any yl in your kynsman: but to thentent that ye ſhulde thynke, that I ſay it accordynge to my naturalitie. And than ſyth I ſay it not agaynſt your credence, for the knowelege that ye haue of hym, miſtake not my ſuſpection, ſith that I am

hole ignoraunt of this yonge mans lyuynge. And I wyll not, that ye ſhoulde thynke, that the chylde my doughter, that hath ben brought vp in ſo great vertue in my palais, ſhulde be maried to this yong man for the onely fame that he hath amonge the people. O howe often haue I ſene in our tyme nowe, and haue redde of the worlde paſſed, the whiche as nowe by commaundement of the goddis, at an other tyme by their yll workes haue deſerued it, at an nother tyme by their ſorowfull deſtenies haue permytted it, wenynge for to brynge ſonnes in lawe into theyr howſe, haue brought in a hell: In ſtede of wyſe and fayre doughters, haue recouered adders: And ſeekynge ſonnes, haue founde baſilycke ſerpentes: In bienge of bloudde, poyſon delyuered: In ſekynge frendes, they haue founde ennemies: In demaundyng honour, ſhame hath be gyuen: and finally in marienge theyr chyldren, wenynge to haue lyued merily, the ſorowfull fathers haue hadde euyll lyfe and a wors dethe. And in caſe that ſuche ought to be moued more of them that be ioyous, than they that bene ſory, of them that ben ioyous, as well oughte we to approue the iuſte chaſtiſement of the iuſte goddis, by the vniuſte workes done to iuſte men. For he deſerueth great chaſtiſement, that with feareful hardynes as a foole determineth hym ſelfe in high and difficult thynges with ſodayn counſell. And therfore my frendes, if ye be vertuous, be not abaſhed of that that I ſaye, nor take the examination that I make in a ſclaunder: If I take this younge man to be my ſonne, to be ſonne in lawe to Fauſtyne my wyfe, huſbande to my doughter Matrine, brother to Comodus the prince, felowe to them of the ſenate, kynſman to my kynſfolke, and lorde of my ſeruantes: It is reaſon, that ſuche a robe ought well to be regarded, ſythe that ſo many perſons muſte weare the lyueray therof. The garmente that

ſo many perſons muſt weare, muſt be wyſely cutte, to content them all. We ſe naturally many thynges noyfull to vs, if it be nere vs, and yet nat domageable to vs ferre of. The ſonne with his ſhynynge beames dothe parche the fleſhe of the people of Ethiope, bycauſe hit is nere vnto them: and contrary wiſe it doothe no greefe to theyr perſones that inhabite in the ende of Europe: for bycauſe it toucheth them afarre of. There haue bene dyuers ſonnes of Rome, whiche beinge in ſtrange countreys, haue done greatte proufyte to the common welthe, and noo leſſe famed throughout the worlde, whiche after they were returned to theyr owne howſes, haue ſpylte more bloode of innocentes, than they had done before of the Barbariens. And that it is ſothe demaunde of Iulius Ceſar, of Pompeius, of Sylla, of Marius, of Caſius, of Catilina, and of Lypulus, of Octauius, and Marcus Anthonius, of Caligula, and of Nero, of Othus, and Domitianus. And as I ſay of ſoo ſmall a nombre of baſtarde chylderne that helde Rome, I maye ſaye of dyuers other tyrauntes broughte vppe in Italye. Beleue me in oone thynge, All that is agreable to vs abroode, agreethe not to vs yf we brynge them into the howſe. For there gothe many thynges betwene the entreatynge of a man in wordes, and to belonge conuerſant with hym in workes. Lyttell nedethe humayne ignorance for to begyle an other, and yet leſſe to be begyled of many an other. With a meke vyſage, ſwete wordes in the tongue, good delyberation in the perſonne, temperaunce in the worde euery one may begyle an other nowe adayes: and by ſhrewdenes and malyce, is begyled hym ſelfe. I ſay to you, I beinge a yonge man knewe the famous oratour Taurin propoſe dyuers tymes in the ſenate: And on a day he ſpake for a Romayn matron, which ſhulde haue maried an honeſt doughter of hers to a mayſter

of horſes, by ſemynge a Romayne, and not very well appoynted: And amonge other wordes he ſayde: O noble fathers, O happy people, commande not that thinge, that afterwarde ye wolde were not commaunded. An yll mariage is lyke as he that ſhoteth a pellet of duſte, it hurteth hym that it toucheth, and blyndeth theym that ſtande nexte. Sothelye theſe were hie wordes, and the compariſon well vnderſtanden, conteyneth in it ſentences of grauitie. It is manyfeſt to all men, that an ylle ſonne in lawe is the deathe of the wyfe that hath hym, ſhame to the frendes that procured it, and at the laſte an yll ende for hym ſelfe, and for his father that offered it. Than by all theſe thynges that I haue ſayde, ye maye vnderſtande what I thinke in this mariage. His ſayinges thus ended, the Senate was gretly edified therwith, and the knyghtes kynſfolke to this yong man, greatly abaſhed: and Fauſtin the empreſſe ſore confuſed, for by her introduction the matter was moued. And howe this mariage failed, the hiſtoriens write not, whom we haue folowed in this werke.
         
         
            How Marke themperour fauored al noble exercyſes, and hated trewandes and fooles. ca. xiiii.
            
               THe vertues of this good emperour, and the knowlege of ſciēces, the worthines in armes, and the purenes of his liuinge, cauſed hym to be named amonge the famous men of Rome. The gentel conuerſatiō that he had with euery man, made him to be renowmed amonge the worthyeſt of al the worlde. The thinge moſt agreable without reprehencion of the greatteſt, meane, and leaſt is, that a lord and prynce of many, be communicable and conuerſaunt with many. All the good werkes of good men may be condemned

with the yll intentions of theym that be ylle: But the good condicions haue ſuch a priuilege, that of yl the good is prayſed, and the good approueth the yll. In a mans lyuynge, there is none ſo great a vyce, but by good cōuerſation it is couered and hid. And contrary wiſe, no crime is ſecrete, but with ylle conuerſation, at the tyme that it hurteth, it is more openly knowen. Of two extremities hit is not ſo greuous to the common welthe, a man to be weake and faynt in ſecretenes, &amp; of gentyll conuerſation abrode, as it is of hym that is ſecrete, and is rude &amp; of yll conuerſation openly. Dyuers not being of good order and policie, we haue ſene cōuerſant a gret whyle in Rome, only for beinge well condicioned. And many mo we haue ſene, that in a ſhort whyle after they were put in office, haue ben ſoo proude and haſty in theyr condicions, that they haue ben depriued from theyr offyces. And this we ſay bicauſe this good emperour was ſo ioyous of vyſage, ſoo amyable in his cuſtomes, ſo louynge in his conuerſation, that lyghtly he wolde caſte his armes aboute the necke, and on the ſhulders of them, and take them by the handes, that had any thynge to do with hym. The porters ſhoulde not lette them that wolde accompany hym in the palays: nor his garde was not ſo hardy to put abacke ſuch as wold ſpeke with hym in the fieldes. In all his ages he applyed to that that euery age gaue hym by nature: He was a childe amonge children, yonge amonge yonge folkes, worldely with them that were worldly, good felowe with good felowes, a baron amonge barons, hardy with hardy men: and finally olde with olde menne. He was wonte to ſaye, whan any in his preſence that were yonge and not welle taught in their language, ieſted at the debilitie of age, or olde men at the foly of youth: Leaue them, ſith they leaue you. Many tymes of wyſe yonge men cometh olde foles,

And of yonge fooles cuſtomably cometh wiſe olde men: Naturalyte at the laſte maketh all thynge in kynde. As of greatte debilitie we canne drawe but ſmalle ſtrengthe, by our naturalitie we may for a tyme reſiſte it, but not vtterly mayſter it. I am ſore abaſhed, that ſomme wyll be ſoo lordely and valiant in vertues, and ſo hygh mynded, and yet wyll make vs beleue, that they lyuinge in the fleſſhe, and being of fleſhe, onely fele not the fleſhe. I can not tel, if nature hath made other of an other nature than I am of, or me of an other nature thanne other be. For I beynge neuer ſo faſte incloſed in the ſwete conuerſation of philoſophy, yea in the beſte tyme, this falſe fleſſhe wolle calleatte the gate with his noughtye fleſhe. The more that we reyſe and exalte vs with ſcience and gette lyberties, the more lower we doo putte the fleſſhe with her myſeries. Beleue me one thynge, that if a tree beareth not in Prymetyme his flowers, we hope not to haue the fruite in harueſte type: and a yonge man that hathe not paſſed his youthe with yonge people, we haue noo hope that he ſhulde paſſe his age with olde men. And as we may reſyſte our naturalitie, and not cleane to for do it, ſo thoſe fathers erre, that are ſo extremely affectioned, to haue theyr chyldren to begynne as olde men, whervpon it foloweth, that they ende as yonge. This emperour was ſoo wyſe in all thynges, that amonge them that were mery, he was of great myrthe. And in verities he was very veritable. In his paſtimes he was greattely temperate, and a louer of muſike, ſpecially in good voyce and inſtrumentes, and ſoore diſpleaſed if he harde any diſcorde therin. He paſſed moſte of his youthe in lernynge of ſciences. Whan he came to mannes ſtate, he exerciſed feates of knyghthode: he loued diſciplyne and not of adulation. He was apt and happye in armes, but yet in rydinge of horſes he hadde

ofte tymes yll happe. In his yonge age he delyted to play at the tennys, and at the cheſſe in his aege. He loued not theſe counterfaytyng players of farces and mummeries, and yet leſſe trewandes, that bene natural fooles, iuglers, and geſters for pleaſure. The players and geſters ſuffred great varietie in the empire, accordynge to the diuerſitie of emperours. Iulius Ceſar ſuſteyned theym, Octauian his neuewe droue theym away, Caligula called theym agayne, Cruell Nero banyſhed them, Nerua made theym come agayne, Good Traian banyſhed them out of al Italy, Anthony Pius brought theym in ageyne: And by the handes of this good emperour Marcus Aurelius, they ended. And the occaſion was, the Romayns dyd celebrate with great ioye, the .iiii. day of May, the great feaſte of the mother Berecynte, mother of all the goddis. The ſacred prieſtes flamines diales, wold haue brought thyther theſe mynſtrelles iugglers and geſters, for to reioyce the feaſte, and contrarye wyſe the holy nunnes veſtales wolde haue done the ſame, ſo that variance felle betwene theym, ſome with force, and ſomme with reſiſtence, and ſome ranne thider in fauourynge of bothe parties, and not a fewe, to departe theym. The cruell and greate noyſe of ſlaughter amonge them, was ſuche, that it tourned the feaſte to wepynges, the pleaſures into ſorowes, and theyr ſonges into waylynges. This good emperour laboured to peaſe this furie of the people, and to ſette peace among the neybours of Rome. Whan all was done, he made curious diligence to ſerche out all the players, iuglers, and ieſtours of Rome, and in all the circuite of Italy, that they might be chaſtiſed, and Rome delyuered of them. And for example of all the worlde, he ſente theym to the gate of Hoſtie, and commaunded to ſette them in Galies, and to banyſhe them for euer, into the yles of Helliſpont: whiche was accomplyſhed,

as the emperour commaunded. And fro that daye, was neuer ſene at Rome, iugler nor ieſter, as longe as the emperour lyued. But it paſſed not two yeres after his deathe, but they retourned, whan his ſonne hadde the rule. And excepte the bokes doo lye, there was in Rome greatter nombre of fooles than of wyſe men.
         
         
            ¶Of the good conuerſation of this emperour Marcus Aurelius. Cap. xv.
            
               WE haue ſayd of the hatred that this emperour had to trewandes, reuelers, getters, iuglers, geſters, and ſuche other: Nowe wyl we ſpeke of his laudable exercyſes of them that came to hym. To be welle condicioned, the malyce of mankynde is ſo great, that as good men are bounde to regard the yll, ſo do they that be yll, regarde to diſtroy the good. The trace of vertu is as good in good thingis, with them yt be good, as the vice &amp; diſhoneſtie of euyll folkes, is in euyll thinges. What greatter corruption in this worlde may be, than a vertuous perſone, for one worke of vertue, can not fynde one to helpe hym to worke it, and whan he alone hath wroughte it, there cometh tenne thouſande to gaynſaye hym? The greatteſt goodnes of all goodnes is, whan tyrannies are putte vnder by vertues acquyred: or to fynde remedye agaynſte accuſtomed vyces, with good inclynations. And the greatteſt euyll of all euyls, is whan a perſone forgetteth that he is a manne, puttynge reaſon vnder fote, ſtraynynge his hande agaynſt vertue, and letteth vice rule the bridell. This emperour Mar. Aurel. ſuſteyned in his lyfe great glorie, in the eſchewyng the villany of vyllaynes: no leſſe merited he immortall memorye, in ſufferynge dyuers dyſhoneſties in the execution of his

vertues. An vnfallible reule hit is, amonge the chyldren of vanitie, to chylde the vices of theym that be vycyous. And the vertues welle incorporate, nouryſſhe many enuious. They that be ylle, benne allwayes double ylle, bycauſe they beare armour defenſiue, to defende theyr owne yuelles: and armes offenſyue to aſſaylle the good maners of other. The trowthe is, if good menne be dylygente to ſeke other that be good, no leſſe oughte they for to hyde theym from theym that be ylle: for a good manne with one fynger, hathe power ouer all theym that be vertuous, but for to withſtande one ylle perſonne, he hathe nede of handes feete and frendes. And thoughe fortune be ylle to good menne, theyr owne propre fame ſhall be ſpente as of ſtraungiers. This good emperoure was ſtronge in vertue, meeke in wordes, attemperate in his exercyſes, homely with euery manne, ſadde amonge ſadde men, haſty amonge haſty men, mery with mery men, and wiſe amonge wyſe men, as it is conuenable for a curyous prince to be. And whan theſe are approued in the lawe of good men, by clere vnderſtandynge, as well ſhall they be condempned by theym that haue yll intencions. Thanne as the cooles canne not be in the embres without ſparkis, nor corruption of the carion withoute ſtenche: no more can he that hath a hole and clere herte be, without inforſynge hym to vtter louynge wordes: And he that hathe an ylle harte, alwayes ouercommeth other with wordes of malyce. For it is certayne, for a ſmall ſeaſone the louer maye abſteyne his loue, and yette leſſe tyme the payne of hym, that is payned with loue hydde. The ſorowfulle ſyghes, ſhewe the hurte of the harte, and the malicious wordes diſcouer the yll of the harte. We haue ſayde all this, bycauſe that the bountie of this good Emperoure Marcus Aurelius ſet all his ioy and gladnes in them that were good,

and bewayled theym that were ylle. And as in ſemblable thynges, the worthy men ſhewe their worthynes, and wiſe men their wyſedome, beinge vertuous in workynge, and wiſe in knowlegynge, were very wiſe in diſſimulyng. One of the vertues, that a wyſe man ought to haue (wherin he ſhall be knowen as wyſe) is that he can ſuffre well. For a man yt can ſuffre well, was neuer but wyſe &amp; wel manerd, and therwith to ſuffre the vertue of yll buſines, is a thing reaſonable, of all reaſonable beaſtis, and of them that be good, very good. And by contrarye wiſe, the man that can not well ſuffre, though it be in very iuſte thynges, hopeth not to be welle treated. And lykewiſe as this Emperoure Marcus in all vertues, hath ben egall with all the emperours of Rome, that haue benne, In this vertue of ſufferaunce, he hath ſurmounted all them of the world. He was wont to ſaye many tymes, I haue not attayned to the empire, by the ſciēces that I haue lerned of the philoſophers, but by the pacience, that I haue had with them that were frowarde and not lerned. And this ſemeth to be true: for oftentymes this Emperour, beynge with the Senate at Colliſee, or the Senate with hym in the hygh Capytolle, he ſeynge in his preſence dyuers that prayſed hym, and other, that in his abſence amonge the people blamed hym, and rebuked hym, his attemperance yet was ſoo greatte, and ſhewed him ſelfe ſo iuſte with one and other, that neyther his frendes, that agreed with him, were ſorowful, nor his ennemies, for any diſfauour, went away complayning and angrye.
         
         
            ¶Of the feaſte that the Romaynes kepte to the god Iano in Rome, and what chaunced to the ſayde emperour there. Cap. xvi.
            
               
               AMonge the ſolemne feaſtes, yt the auncient Romaynes had inuented, was one of the god Ianus, kept the fyrſt day of the yere, whiche as nowe is the fyrſte day of Ianiuer: He was paynted with two faces, to ſhewe, that it was the laſte daye of the yere paſſed, and the begynnyng of the newe yere. To this god was dedicate a ſumptuous temple in Rome, which temple Numa Pōpilius, called it the temple of peace. And except the temple of Iupiter, it was holden in moſt reuerence of all other. Whan the Romayn emperours went or came to Rome, to vyſite the high capitoll, and the veſtall vyrgins, forthwith they wente to praye, worſhyp, and to offre at the temple of Ianus. The day of celebration of the ſayd feaſt, all Rome reioyced, and put on them the beſte clothes that they hadde, brennynge great lyghtes in euerye hous, and made many playes of interludes, of geſtes and iuglyng, &amp;
watched all nyght in the temples, &amp; delyuered al the priſoners that were in priſon for dette, &amp; payde the debtes with the common treaſour. They had tables with meate before their doores, in ſuch haboundance, that more was left thā eaten, wherwith all the poore folkes in Rome were releued. The Romayns thought, that what ſo euer they ſpent that daye, that the god Iano (whiche was god of tymes) wolde rewarde them double. The Romaynes ſayde, that this god Ianus was not vnkynde nor no nygarde, for yf they ſpente a lyttell, he wolde recompence theym with a great deale. At this feaſte was made greate proceſſions, euery ſorte of people by them ſelfe, the ſenate went apart, the prieſtes aparte, The Cenſores aparte, the Plebeyens aparte, The matrones and yonge maydens by them ſelfe, and the ambaſſadours went in proceſſion with al the captiues and priſoners. Thus they wente euer two and two:

the ende of one company, was the beginnyng of an other. And thus out of the temple of Ianus, they wente aboute all the temples of Rome, and ſoo out of Porte latine into the fieldes, and rounde about the walles of Rome. And bycauſe the circuite of Rome was greatte, the proceſſions went but from one gate to an other, ſo that towarde night all the proceſſions of Rome had gone euerychone in theyr company aboute: And that done, they retourned all into the temple, that they came out of, and there offred echeone as they myght. And in the ſayde proceſſions it was of cuſtome, that the emperours went accompanied with the ſenatours: but this good emperour was ſoo famylier, that he wolde honour and accompany euery man. It was accuſtomed in Rome, that the ſayde day themperour ſhulde weare on his robe, and mantelle unperiall. And all priſoners and captiues that myght touch hym with their hāde, were deliuered, &amp; al treſpaſſours were pardoned, and baniſhed folke were forgiuen, and called agayn. And this emperour to vſe his clemency, and to leaue after hym perpetuall memorie, lefte the proceſſion of ſenatours, and without any gard, went the proceſſion with priſoners and captiues. The whiche doinge, was occaſion to leaue behynde hym perpetuall memory of hym ſelfe, and greate example of clemencie and lowlynes to princes for to come. Howe be it there is nothynge ſo well done of them that be good, but forthwith it ſhalbe contraried of them that be yl: And therfore this example was ſoo moche diſprayſed of theym that were yll, as prayſed and allowed of theym that were good. And in likewiſe as among them that be good, there is one noted to be pure good, ſo amonge them that be yll, there is one noted to be right ylle. And that worſe is, that the vertuous perſon eſtemeth not the glorie his vertue ſo great, as the malitious perſon by his malice is ſhamid.

This is ſayde, bycauſe there was a ſenatour in the ſenate, named Fuluius, whiche was as blacke by his malyce, as whyte by his heares. He laboured ſoore in the dayes of Adrian to haue ben emperour, and had Marcus always as competitour. And as it is a naturall thyng to theym that haue yll hartes, to ſhewe theyr malyce in ſmal thynges, ſo this emperour dyd neuer no good thynge openly, but this Fuluius wolde grudge therat ſecretely. And though this emperour was greatly prayſed for the delyuerynge of priſoners, yet the ſayd ſenatour coude not haue the prudence for to ſuffre it, and ſo part in mockery, and part in erneſte, he ſayd theſe wordes to the emperour in the ſenate: Why gyueſt thou thy ſelfe to all men?
         
         
            ¶Howe Marcus the emperour aunſwered a ſenatour in the ſenate. Cap. xvi.
            
               THe emperour Marcus Aur̄hering what the ſenator had ſaid to him, in the p̄ſence of the ſenators, yt is to wite, Wherfore he gaue him to all men, He aunſwered, Frende, I giue me to all men, bycauſe all men giue them to me, and ar glad of me. Beleue me, that ouer great rigour in a prince, cauſeth hatred of the people. The goddis wyll not, nor the lawes permit not, nor the agreement of the cōmon welthe wyll not ſuffre, ye princis be lordes ouer many, &amp; to accompany but with a fewe. I haue redde in bokes, &amp; haue proued it by my ſelfe, that the loue of ſubiectes, the ſuretie of the prince, the dignitie of thempire, and the honour of the Senate, do conſerue the prince, not with rigour, but with gentyll conuerſation. The fyſher goth not to take dyuers fyſhes of the riuer with one baite, nor ye mariner with one nette entreth into the ſee. I promyſe you the depeneſſe of

good wylles ought to be wonne with the depeneſſe of the harte, ſome with gyftes, ſome with wordes, ſome with promyſes, and ſome with fauours. The inſaciate couetous men are neuer content, nor wyll open their affection, but locke vp their treaſours. And ſuch as ſerueth for loue, ar leſſe content with openyng of their treaſure, than locking vp their wylles. It is an olde prouerbe of Pythagoras: Loue is payd with other loue. O how yl fortune it is to a prince, &amp; how vnhappy it is to a cōmon welth, whā ye people ſerue not their lordes, but for rewardes, &amp; the lordes to kepe &amp; mayntayne them, but for their ſeruice. With diuers ſtones and one ciment, buyldynge is reyſed, and of diuers men, and one lord, is compoſed a common welthe. And if geometrie begile me not, the morter that ioyneth one ſtone with an other, ought to be medled with ſande and ſlecked lyme by reſon. Separate the ſtones, and the wal openeth, and let the cyment fayle, and the edifice falleth. He that is wyſe, may well vnderſtande me. Loue betwene neybours ſuffereth to be mitigate with water: but hit is requyſite, that the loue of the prince and his people be pure. Dyuers trowbles, and acte dyuers tymes, I haue ſeene among the common people of Rome in one day moued and appeaſed: but one diſcorde, reyſed betwene the lorde and the common welthe, vnto the death, is neuer accorded. It is a difficile thinge, to make appoyntment of many with many, and more difficile, to accorde one with an nother. But without compariſon, more harder it is, to appoynt diuers with one, than one with dyuers. And in this caſe I wyl not ſaue the prince, nor leue the people vncondēpned. Fro whens (as ye thynk) cometh it now adays, that lordis with annoyance commaunde vniuſte thinges, and in iuſt thinges the ſubiectes are vnobediente? Nowe here me, &amp; I ſhall tell you. The prince doinge a thynge in dede, and

not of righte, wyl confounde the wyl of euery manne, and beleue his owne vnderſtandynge, and drawe of hym ſelfe and all other his onely wyl. Contrary wiſe, the multitude of the people diſprayſynge theyr lordes vnderſtandynge, do as they will: not as all wyll, but as euery manne deſireth hym ſelfe. Of trouth it is a greuous thing, although it be greately accuſtomed, to wyll, that all gounes ſhulde be mete fore one man, and that one mans harneis ſhuld be mete to arme all men. Than what ſhall we do, that our fathers haue lefte thus in the worlde, &amp; alſo we hold that we be theyr chyldren, and that worſe is, we leaue the ſame to our heires? O howe many princis of my predeceſſours, I haue redde of, that haue bene loſte in ſhewynge theym ſelfe ouer ſtraunge, and beloued of none? I wyll tell you of ſomme of them for exaumples, that I haue redde in my bokes, to thintent that pryncis maye ſe what they wynne by amiable conuerſation, and what they loſe by ouermoch ſtraungenes. In the realme of Aſſiens, greatter in armes than the Caldeens, and leſſe in aduantage and antiquitie than the Aſſiriens: One maner forme of kynges endured amonge them. CC. and .xx. yeres, by reaſon they were of lowable conuerſation. And an nother fourme and maner (as Homer ſayth) laſted but .xl. yeres, bicauſe their kinges were of an yll condition. And the .ix. Epiphanes of the Egiptiens was vnnombred and put down, bycauſe there was a lawe that eche one ſhulde be bare legged in the temples vpon the holy dayes. And this kynge on a day riding came before the god Apis, god of the Egiptiens, the whiche thyng was not ſuffred, for beſyde that he was put out of his realme, he was chaſtiſed. Alſo the .vi. Arfacidauel the inuincible kynge of Parthes, not onely was depriued, but alſo banyſhed out of his realme, bycauſe he dyned at a knyghtes bridale, and wolde not eate at the bridale of a

cōmuner. Yet alſo though the realme of Italy was ſcant, theyr hartes were greatte: for bycauſe one of their Marranes, for ſo were their kynges called, had ſhette his gates by nyghte, for to ſlepe the ſurelyer, he was depriued of his realme: bycauſe a lawe was made, that noo prynce ſhulde ſhette his gates nyght nor day. for they ſaide, they had made him kynge for to dryue awaye their ennemyes, and not to be daintily nouriſhed. Tarquine the laſt kyng of the Romayns was vnkynde to his father in lawe, diffamed his blod and kynrede, was a traytour to his countrey, cruell of his perſone, and aduoutrer with Luctece: but for all that he was not called vngentyll, nor infamed, nor traytour, nor cruell, nor aduoutrer, but he was named Tarquine the prowde, bycauſe he was of ylle condicions and complexions. And yet by the lawe of good menne, I ſwere to you, that if the ſayd vnhappy Tarquine had had good wyll in Rome, for the aduoutry of Lucrece he hadde not be put out of his realme, for as moche as other greatter and more greuous harmes hadde benne doone before his tyme, and alſo moche wors ſithen by aged emperours in the empire, the whyche crymes by theym commytted were ſuche, that the offence of this frayle yonge man was but ſmall in eſtimation. For thynge certayne theſe prynces holde, that if they gyue dyuers occaſions for their yll wyll, yet a lyttell thing ſuffiſeth if he ſhewe, that the hate that he hath is for none yll wyll: but the hate that the ſubiecte hath to the lorde, is bycauſe he hath no power. ¶Iulius Ceſar, the laſte dictatour and firſte emperour, bycauſe he forgate to be a man among men, but thinking to be a god amonge goddis, beynge a lawdable cuſtome, that the ſenate ſhulde ſalute the emperour on their knees, and the emperour to ryſe courteyſly agaynſte theym: bycauſe of a preſumptuous mind, he wold not kepe the ſeremonie,

he merited to leſe his lyfe with .xxiii. ſtrokes of pen kniues, And as I ſaye of theſe ſo fewe a nombre, I maye ſaye of many other. The phiſitions with a lyttel Rubarbe purge many humours of the body, and the emperor with a littel beneuolence taketh many greues fro the ſtomakes of his ſubiectes. The people owe obedience to the prynce, and to do his perſone great reuerence, and fulfyll his cō
               maundementes, and the prince oweth egall iuſtice to euery man, and meke conuerſation to all men.
            ¶Marcus Portius ſayde dyuers tymes in Rome: That the publycke welthe is there perpetuall and without any ſodayne falle, where the prynce fyndethe obedience, and all the people fyndethe loue with the prynce. For of the loue of the lorde bredethe the good obedience of the ſubiecte, and of the obedience of the ſubiecte bredeth the good loue of the lorde. The emperour in Rome is lyke to a ſpider that is in the myddes of her webbe. For if the ſayde coppe webbe be touched with the poynte of a nedell, forthwith the ſpider feleth hit. I meane that all the werkes of the emperour in Rome benne ſtreyghte waye knowen in all the erthe. I beleue that this daye I haue bene iudged of humayne malyce, for accompanyenge the proceſſyon of the captiues, and that I ſuffredde theym to towche me, that they myghte enioy the priuilege of lybertie. I yelde and gyue great graces to my goddis of my good happe, bycauſe they haue made me pitifull for to delyuer priſoners, and not cruell as a tyraunte for to make theym bonde that be free. The prouerbe ſayth: One ſnare maye take two byrdes: So it hath ben this daye, for that benefyte rebounded onely to the myſerable priſoners, but the fauour, to all theyr nations. And doo ye not knowe, that by the takyng away of their yrons, I haue drawen to me the hartes of all theyr realmes and countreys? Fynally

hit is more ſure to a prince to be ſerued with free hartes, and loue of them that be at libertie, than of ſubiectes conſtreyned with feare.
         
         
            ¶Howe themperour Marcus deuided the howres of the day for the buſyneſſes of thempire. Ca. xviii.
            
               HEre before we haue ſhewid how this good emperour had great hatrede of men that were of yll lyuynge, and that paſſed their tyme in ylle exercyſe. It ſuffiſeth not the philoſopher to repreue the vice of other by wordes, but it is neceſſary that he do the werkis that he requireth other to do: It is reaſon nowe to ſhewe, howe this Emperour by his great prudēce compaſſed &amp; diſpatched the great and huge buſyneſſes of the empire, the particularities of his houſeholde, the recreation of his perſone, thexercyſe of his ſtudies, the infinite reaſonynge with one and other, with ſuche peyne takyng, and in ſo ſhorte tyme. He was ſoo apte and wel aduyſed, that by hym there was no tyme yl ſpent. Nor neuer fayled to diſpatche the beſynes of the empire. And bycauſe the tyme is glorious of hym that gloriouſly ſpendeth it, and the tyme is accurſed, that to our domage and without profyte to other paſſeth, leauing vs ignorant as brute beaſtes: He departed the tyme by times, the order wherof was thus. Seuen howres he ſlepte in the nyght, and reſted one howre in the daye: At dyner and ſupper he waſted but onely two howres: he deputed two howres for the matters of Aſie: Other two howres for the buſyneſſe of Europe and Affrike: and in conuerſation of his houſe, and with his wife and children ſeruantes and frēdes that came to ſee him, he ſpente other two howres: And for the outwarde beſyneſſe, as to here the complayntes of theym

that were greued: The ſuites of poore men wantynge iuſtyce, the wydowes, the robberies of pyckers, of mychers, and vacaboundes, he deputed an other houre. All the reſt of the day and nyght in reding of bokes, to write workes, to make metres, to ſtudye antyquities, to practyſe with wiſe men, to diſpute amonge philoſophers, he paſſed thus ordinately in wynter: And in ſommer if cruel warres letted hym not, or that he were troubled with great and hainous matters, he went euer to bed at .ix. of the clocke, and awoke at .iiii. It was of cuſtome that emperours hadde euerlyghtes brennynge in their chaumbre. And therfore whan he awoke, bycauſe he wolde not be ydel, he had euer a boke at his beddes heed. And thus in redynge he ſpente the reſt of the nyght, tyll it was day. He roſe at .vi. of the clocke, and made hym redy openly, not angrely, but merily: he wolde demaunde of them that were preſente, howe they had ſpent all the nyght tyme. And there he wolde reherſe what he had redde that nyght. Whan he was redye, he wolde waſhe his handes with very well ſmellynge waters: for he was a great louer of al ſwete odours. He had a good and a quycke ſmellynge. Than in the mornynge before euery man, he wolde take .iii. or .iiii. morſelles of electuarie of ſticados, and two draughtes of Aqua vite. After that in ſommer he wold go forthwith a fote to the riuerſide, and there paſſe the tyme the ſpace of two houres. And as ſoone as the heate came, he wolde goo to the hygh capitoll to the ſenate. That done he wente to the colledge, where as all the procurours and ambaſſadours of al prouinces were, and there he wolde be a greatte parte of the daye, and here euery nation by hit ſelfe, accordynge to the tyme that was deputed by order. And towarde the euennynge, he wolde goo to the temple of the vyrgins veſtales. He eate but ones a day, and that was ſomewhat late,

and thanne he wolde make a good meale, and but of fewe meates. He had a cuſtome euerye weke in Rome, or other cities, where as he was, that two dayes late in the euennynge he wolde walke in the ſtretes without his garde or knyghtes, onely with .x. or .xii. pages, to ſe if any perſone wolde ſpeake with hym, or complayne of any officer of his courte and houſe, and this he cauſed to be demaunded of other men. This good emperour wolde often tymes ſaye: A good prynce that wyll rule and gouerne wel, and not to be a tyraunte, oughte to do thus: That is, that he be not couetous of tributes, nor proude in his commaundementes, nor vnkynde to ſeruices, nor bolde in the temples, nor defe to here complayntes. In fulfyllynge hereof he ſhall haue the goddes in his handes, and the hartys of menne ſhalbe his. Al the whyle that this Marke was emperour, he had neuer porter at his chaumbre doore, but if it were the two houres that he was with Fauſtine his wyfe. This good emperour had in his howſe a ſecrete cloſette locked with a key that he bare hym ſelfe, and neuer truſted none other therwith to the houre of his death. And than he cō
               maunded to delyuer it to Pompeiano, a prudent ancient bacon that was maryed to his doughter: In the which cloſet he had diuers bokes writen in all langages, as Greke, hebrewe, latyne, and Caldee, and other antike hyſtories.
         
         
            The anſwere of M. themperour, whan Fauſtine his wife demaunded the key of his ſtudy. ca. xix.
            
               AS it is natural to womē to diſpiſe that thyng that is gyuen them vnaſked, ſo it is deathe to them to be denayed of that they do demande. This emperour had the ſtudy or cloſet of his howſe in the mooſte ſecrete place of his palays, wherin he

neyther ſuffred his wyfe ſeruant nor frende to entre. On a day it chanced, that Fauſtin thempreſſe deſyred importunatly to ſe that ſtudy, ſayinge theſe wordes: My lorde, let me ſe your ſecrete chaumbre. Beholde I am greatte with chylde, and ſhall dye, if I ſee it not. And ye knowe well, that the lawe of the Romayns is, that nothynge ſhall be denyed to womenne with chylde, of that they deſire. And if ye do otherwiſe, ye doo it in dede, but not of ryghte. For I ſhall dye with the chylde in my bodye. And more ouer I thynke in my mynde, that ye haue ſome other louer within your ſtudy. Therfore to put away the peryl of my trauaylyng, and to aſſure my harte frome Ielouſie, hit is no great thyng to lette me entre into your ſtudy. The emperour ſeinge that Fauſtines wordes were of trouth, &amp; bycauſe he ſawe her wordes waſhed with wepyng, anſwered her on this wyſe: It is a thyng certayne, whan one is contented, he ſaythe more with his tongue, than he thynketh with his harte. And contrary wyſe, whan one is heuy, the eyen wepe not ſoo moche, nor the tongue can not declare that is locked in the hart. Vayne men with vayne wordis ſhewe and declare their vayne pleaſures: And the wyſe men with prudent wordes, diſſemble their cruel paſſions. Amonge wyſe men he is wyſeſt, that knoweth moche, and ſheweth to knowe but lyttell: And amonge the ſymple, he is mooſte ſymple, that knoweth but lyttelle, and ſheweth hym ſelfe to knowe moche. They that ar prudent, though they are demaunded, ſay nothyng: but ſymple folke wyll ſpeake ynough without aſkynge of any queſtion. This I ſaye Fauſtine, bycauſe thy wepynge hath ſoo hurte me, and thy vayn ſpeche ſo turmented me, that I can not declare that I fele, nor thou canſt nat fele yt that I ſaye. Dyuers aduertiſementes haue they writen, that haue writen of mariage, yet haue they not writen, how many trauailes

that one womanne cauſeth her houſbande to ſuffre in one daye. Of a ſuretie, it is a ioyfull thynge to reioyce in the chyldhode of chyldren, but it is a ryght cruel thing to ſuffre the importunities of theyr mothers. The chyldren do nowe and then a thing that tourneth vs to pleaſure, but ye women do nothynge but gyue vs diſpleasure. I ſhall agree with all maried men to pardon theyr chyldrens pleſures, for the annoyance that the mothers gyue to theym. One thynge I haue ſene, the whiche neuer begyled me, that the iuſte goddes do gyue to the vniuſte menne, that all the euylles that they doo in this worlde, ſhall be remytted to the furies of the other worlde: But if they doo commytte any ſynne for the pleaſure of any woman, the goddis commaunde, that by the handes of the ſame womanne, we ſhall receyue peyne in this worlde, and not in the other. There is not ſoo fyers or peryllous an ennemie to a manne, as is his wyfe. And though a manne can not lyue with her as a man, I neuer ſawe none ſoo lyght, beynge with a vicious woman, in doynge vyce, but that by the ſame woman at the laſt he receyued ſhame and chaſtyſement. Of one thynge I am ſure, and I ſaye it not bycauſe I haue ſene it, but experimented in my ſelfe, that though the huſbande do all that his wyfe wylle, yet wyll ſhe do nothynge that her huſband wolde haue done. Gret crueltie is among the barbariens to holde theyr wiues as ſclaues: And no leſſe madnes is it of Romaynes, to kepe them as ladyes. Fleſſhe oughte not to be ſoo leane, that it abhorre: nor ſo fatte that it cloye the ſtomake: but meane and enterlarded, to the ende that it be ſauourye. I ſaye that a wyſe manne canne not gyue ſo ſtronge a brydelle to his wyfe, that ſhe wylle obeye as an hande mayden: nor gyue her ſo lyttell of the brydell, but ſhe wylle exalte her ſelfe as mayſtreſſe and reuler. Beholde Fauſtine howe

ye womenne are ſoo extreme in all heedlonge extremities, that with a lyttell fauour ye wylle exalte, augemente, and growe into great pride: and with a lyttell disfauour, ye recouer greatte hatred. There is no parfite loue, where is no egalitie betwene the louers. And as ye and other are vnperfite, ſoo is your loue vnperfite. I wote well ye vnderſtande me not. Therfore vnderſtande Fauſtine, that I ſay more than ye wene. There is no woman, that with her wyll wolde ſuffre any greatter than her ſelfe: nor to be contente to haue an other egall with her. For thoughe ſhe haue a. M.li. rent, yet ſhe hathe, x.M. folyes in her heed. And that worſe is, though it chaunce her huſbande to dye, and ſhe leſe all her rent, yet endeth not her folyſhenes. Herken to me, and I ſhall tell you more. All women wolde ſpeake, and haue all other to be ſtylle: they wolde gouerne, and be gouerned of none other. One thyng they deſyre, that is to ſe, and to be ſene. And ſuche as be lyghte in folowynge theyr lyghtnes, they holde as theyr ſubiectes and ſclaues: and ſuche as be wyſe, and reproue theyr appetites, they purſue as enemies. In the annales Pompeyens, I haue founde a thyng worthy for to be knowen, and that is: Whan Gnee Pompeie paſſed into the Orient on the mountaynes Rifees he founde a maner of people called Maſagetes, whiche had a lawe, that euery inhabitaunt or dweller ſhuld haue two tonnes or fattes, bycauſe there was lacke of houſes in the ſayde mountaynes: In one was the houſbande, the ſonnes and men ſeruauntes: and in the other the wyfe the doughters and maydens. On the holy dayes they dydde eate to gether, and ones in the weke they laye together. Whan great Pompeye had queſtioned the cauſe of theyr lyuynge in that maner, for that he neuer ſawe nor knewe a more extreme thynge in all the worlde, One of them aunſwered: Pompey behold,

the goddis haue gyuen vs but a ſhorte lyfe, for none of vs may lyue aboue .lx. yere at the moſte, and thoſe yeres we trauayle to lyue in peace. And in hauing our wyues with vs ſtyll in companye, we ſhulde lyue euer dyenge: for we ſhulde paſſe the nyghtes in herynge their complayntes: and the days in ſufferynge their brawlynges and chydynges. In kepynge them this wiſe from vs apart, they nouriſhe their chyldren more peaſibly, eſchewynge the noyſes that ſleeth the fathers.
            ¶I tell the Fauſtin, that though we cal the Maſagettes barbariens, in this caſe they be wiſer than the Romayns. One thing I wyl tel you Fauſtin, and I pray you marke it wel. If the beaſtly mouynge of the fleſſhe enforced not the wyll of man to do his luſte, and that he wolde not deſire women, I doubte whether women wolde ſuffre it or loue it the leſſe. Of trouth if the goddis hadde made this loue voluntarie, as it is naturall, that is as we wolde we myght, and not as we wold and may not: with great peyn a man myghte be ſatisfied, though he ſhuld loſe him ſelfe for any woman. It is a great ſecrete of the goddis, and a great myſerie to man, that the faynt and weke fleſhe doth force the herte whiche ſhulde be free, to loue that it abhorreth, and to alowe that that domageth. This is a greatte ſecrete, that men can fele hit euery houre as men: and yet by diſcretion may not remedy it. I enuie not the lyuynge goddis, nor the menne that be deed, but for two thynges, and they ben theſe: The goddis lyue without feare of thē that be malycious, and they that be deed are in peace with out nede of women. The ayre is ſo corrupt, that it corrupteth euery man with two peſtilent plages ſo deadely, tha the fleſhe and the harte endeth. O Fauſtine, is the loue of the fleſhe ſo naturall, that whā the fleſhe fleeth ſcornefully we ſhulde leue the true harte as captiue? And the reſonne

as reaſon put her to flyght, the fleſhe as fleſhe forthewith yeldeth her to you as ouercome.
         
         
            ¶The emperour reherſeth the perylles of them that haunt women exceſſiuely. Cap. xx.
            
               THemperour folowynge his purpoſe declareth the vniuerſall domages, that come to man by ouermoche conuerſacyon and hauntynge of women. And after he had tolde ſome particular caſes that he had ſuffred with Fauſtin his wyfe, he ſayd: I am well remembred, yt in my yong age I folowed the fleſhe to moch, with purpoſe neuer to returne. And therfore I cōfeſſe, yt if I had good deſires in one day, in ſtede therof a. M. dayes I wrought yll. It is reſon that ye women flee from them that flee from you: to hyde you from them that hyde them fro you, to leue them that leaue you, to ſeperate you fro them, that ſeparate them fro you: to forgette them that forget you. For ſome ſcape fro your handes yll famed and effeminate: and other are hurt with your tonges, many ben perſecuted with your werkes, and the better to ſcape free, they come awaye abhorred of your hartes and bounde to your lyghtneſſes. Than who that feleth this, what getteth he by the attaynynge therof? O to howe many perylles offerethe he hym ſelfe, that with women is greatly conuerſant? If a man loue theym not, they count hym as a villeyne: if he loue them, they thinke hym lyghte: yf he leaue theym, they repute hym for a cowarde: if he folowe them, he is loſte, if he ſerue theym, he is not regarded, if he ſerue theym not, he ſhall be hated of them, yf he wylle haue theym, they wylle not haue hym: yf he deſyre theym not, they wylle ſeeke on hym: yf he haunte theym, he is ylle named: if he haunte theym not,

they recken hym no man. What ſhall the vnhappye man do? Let men take this for certayne, that thoughe the huſbande do for his wyfe all that he can do as a mā, and that he ought to do as a huſbande, and with his weakenes do the beſte that he can, for to fynde remedy agaynſte pouertie with his trauayle, and put hym ſelfe in danger for her euerye houre: al this ſhall not pleaſe his wyfe, nor make her the better, but ſhe wyll ſay, that the traytour louethe other, and that all that he dothe, is onely to accomplyſſhe his pleaſure on them. Many dayes ago Fauſtyne, I haue wylled to tell the this, but I haue differred it tyll now, hopynge that thou woldeſt gyue me occaſion to telle it the: the whiche longe agoo thou haſte cauſed me to feele. It is no poynte of wyſe men, that for euerye tyme they are annoyed with theyr wyues, forthewith to hurte theym with wordes. For amonge wiſe men the ſayd wordes are moſte eſtemed whan they are well appropried and ſayd to good purpoſe. I do bethynke me, that it is .vi. yere ſith Anthony Pie thy father dyd chuſe me to be his ſonne in law, and thou me to be thy huſbande, and I the for my wyfe: this my fatall deſtenie dyd permytte, at the commaundemente of Adrian my lorde. My father in lawe gaue the his fayre doughter to me for wyfe, and the very ſadde and ponderous empyre in maryage. I trowe we were all begyled: He to take me for his ſonne, and I to chuſe the for my wyfe. He was named Anthony Pius, bycauſe he was pitiefull in all thynges, ſaue vnto me, to whom he was cruell, for in a lyttell fleſſhe he gaue me many bones: and to ſay the trouthe, I haue no tethe to gnawe it, nor no heate in my ſtomacke to dygeſte hit: and manye tymes I haue thoughte my ſelfe loſte with it. For thy beautie thou were deſyred of many, but for thyn yuell condicions thou were abhorred of all. O howe vnhappy ben thy deſtenies Fauſtyne,

and howe yuell haue the goddis prouided for the. They haue giuen the beautie and richeſſe for to vndo the: And they haue denied &amp; refuſid to the the beſt, that is good condicions, qualitie, and wyſedome to maynteyne them. I ſay to the agayn, that the goddis haue ben very cruelle to the, ſythe they adreſſed the to the whyrlepoole, where as all yll folke peryſhe, and haue taken from the, the ſayles and oores, wherby all good folke eſcape. The .xxxviii. yeres, that I was without wyfe, ſeemed not to me .xxxviii. dayes: and the .vi. yeres that I haue ben maried, ſeme to me .vi. hundred yeres. I wyll aſſure the one thynge, that if I had knowen before, that I knowe nowe, and had felt than, that I fele at this houre, I wold ſay an other thyng. And though the goddis wold commande me, and Adrian my mayſter wolde commaunde me, I wolde not chaunge my pouertie and quietnes, for the mariage of the &amp; thempire. But I haue deſired the in thy good fortune, and my ſelfe to myn yll fortune. I haue ſayde but a lyttelle, and haue ſuffred a great deale: I haue feyned a great whyle, but I can feyne no longer. No man ſuffreth his wyfe ſoo moche, but he is bounde to ſuffre more. Let a man, that is a man conſider, and lykewiſe a woman that is a woman conſyder, what boldenes ſhe is of, that quarellethe with her huſbande, and that he is a foole that brawleth openly with his wyfe. For if ſhe be good, he ought to fauour her, that ſhe maye be the better: if ſhe be a ſhrewe, he muſt ſuffre her, that ſhe waxe not wors. Euery man knoweth, that all thynges ſuffereth chaſtiſement ſaue a woman, whiche (as a woman) wyll be deſired and praide. Fauſtine beleue me, yf feare of the goddis, the ſhame of her perſone, and ſpeche of the people, withdrawe not a woman from euyll, all the chaſtiſement of the worlde wyll not ouercome her. The harte of man is verye noble, and the harte of a woman

is deyntie, and wyll haue great hyre for a lytel goodnes, and for moch euyl no chaſtyſement. A wyſe man wyl knowe what he hath to do or he marie. Than if he determyne hym to take the company of a wyfe, he ought to enlarge his harte to receyue all that may come with her. It is but a ſmalle wytte in a man to ſette by the ſmalle fantaſies of his wyfe, or for to chaſtiſe openly that may be righted betwene them ſecretely. He that is wyſe and wyl lyue quietly with his wyfe, ought to kepe this rule: Admoniſhe her often, and reproue her but ſeldome, and lay no handis on her. For by other meanes he getteth no fydelitie in her, nor good entreatynge of her, nor good bryngynge vp of their chyldren, nor ſeruyce to the goodis, nor any hope of profyte of her. And thus Fauſtyne I wyll ſay no more to the, but that thou conſyder, that I do conſyder, and know that I do ſe, and that my ſuffrance vnknowen to the, may ſuffyſe to amende thy lyfe.
         
         
            ¶The emperours anſwere to Fauſtine for that ſhe ſayde, ſhe was with chylde. Cap. xxi.
            
               NOwe that I haue opened and put out the olde venym, I wyl anſwere to thy preſent queſtion or demande. To thentent that medicines may profyte them that be ſycke, it is neceſſary to diſpoyle the opilations &amp; lettes of the ſtomake: Lykewiſe none can counſaylle his frende conuenientely, but if he ſhewe fyrſte his grefe. Thou demaundeſt of me the key of my ſtudy, and thou thretneſt me, that if I gyue it the not, thou ſhalte be loſte and hurte with thy fruyte: ye womenne with chylde haue a good hoſtage or pledge, for vnder colour of trauaylynge before your tyme, ye wolde haue vs fulfylle all your fonde appetytes. Whanne the

holy ſenate in the vnhappy tyme made a lawe in fauour of Romayne matrones, they were not ſo deſirous. Nowe I wote not howe it is, but ye all anoyed and wery of all goodnes. And all ye in all yll are deſyrous and couetous. As farre as I canne remembre, whan Camylle made his vowe to Cybille the mother of goddis, to ſende hym victorie in a battayle, whan he had wonne the victorie, Rome was ſo poore, that it hadde neyther golde nor ſyluer for to make the ſtatute of promeſſe, the matrones than being, ſeing that their huſbandes dyd offre their lyues in the ſayde warre, they granted to preſent their iewels to the holy ſenate. It was a meruayllous thynge to see, that withoute any ſpekynge to them, or without any mans entyſement they determyned all togyther to go to the hye capitol, and there in the preſence of euery man preſented their owches hanginge at theyr eares, The ringes of their fingers, the bracelettes of their armes, the perles from their attires of their heades, the collers from their neckes, The broches of theyr breſtes, the girdelles aboute theyr myddels, and borders of their gownes. And though that their gift was eſtemed to a great value, yet their good wylles was eſtemed a greatte deale more. The rycheſſes that they offered there was ſo greatte, that there was not all onely inough to performe the vow of the ſtatute, but alſo to purſewe the warre. And as than the cuſtome of Rome was, that none dyd them any pleſure, but he was ſhortly recompenſed: the ſame day that the matrones did offre theyr ryche and faire iewelles in the capitolle, there was graunted vnto theym fyue maner of thynges in the Senate: The fyrſte, that at theyr deathes the oratours ſhuld preache, publiſhe, and ſhewe their good liuinge: The ſeconde that they ſhulde ſit in the temple, where as before they were wont to ſtand: The thirde, that they ſhuld were furred &amp; lyned gownes,

where as before they ware none but ſyngle: The .iiii. that in theyr diſeſes they myght drinke wyne, where as before on theyr liues they durſt drinke none, but water: The .v. that the matrones of Rome great with chylde, ſhulde not be refuſed of any thynge that they deſyred. Theſe fyue thinges for certayne were iuſtlye and wyllyngely graunted by the ſenate. And why this lawe that commaundethe to denaye nothynge to a woman with chylde was made, I wyll tel the the occaſion that moued the ſenate ſo to do. Fuluius Torquate beinge conſull in the warre agaynſte the Volſeos, the knyghtes of Mauritayne broughte to Rome a wylde man, that had but one eye, that they hadde taken in huntynge in the deſertes of Egypt. And the matrones of Rome were at that tyme as ſad and honeſte, as they be nowe bolde and lyght: ſo was the wyfe of the ſaid Torquate, that was nyghe the tyme of her delyueraunce great with chylde, of trouth a woman ſo honeſte, that for the ſobre ſolytarines that ſhe kepte in Rome, ſhe hadde noo leſſe glorie thanne hadde her huſbande in the warres for his worthynes, the whiche was well proued. For in the .xiiii. yere that Torquate her huſbande was in Aſye a warre fare, the fyrſte tyme that he wente thyder, ſhe was neuer ſene at the wyndowe lokynge out, and ſhe was not all onely regarded for that, but in all the ſayde .xiiii. yeres neuer manchylde nor manne aboue the age of .viii. yeres came within her gates. And not contente with this, that ſhe dyd to gyue example to all Rome, and to attayne perpetuall memory, where as ſhe had lefte with her thre ſonnes, the eldeſt of whom was but thre yeres of age: and as ſoone as they came to .viii. yere, ſhe ſente them out of her houſe to their grauntefathers. And thus dydde this excellent Romayne lady, to the entente that vnder colour of her owne chyldren there ſhulde none other yonge children

entre into her howſe. Thoſe yeres paſſed, after that the good olde man Torquate was retourned fro the warres of the Volſeos, the ſayde wylde man with one eye wente by the doore of the ſayde Torquate, and one of her maydens tolde her, that it was a meruaylous thyng to ſe: and the good lady hadde great deſyre to ſee hym, and bycauſe there was none to brynge hym to her, that ſhe myghte ſee hym, ſhe dyed for ſorowe. And for certayne thoughe he came often inoughe by her doore, yet ſhe wolde neuer goo nor loke out at her wyndowe to ſe hym. Her deathe was gretly bewayled in Rome, for ſhe was in Rome moſt derely beloued, and good reaſon: for many dayes afore was no ſuche womanne brought in Rome. And by the commaundement of the ſenate, the tenour of this writinge in verſes were ſet vpon her ſepulchre,
            ¶Here lyeth the glorious matron wife of Torquate, that wolde aduenture her lyfe to aſſure her good fame. ¶Beholde Fauſtine, this lawe was not made to remedy the death of this matrone, but to the ende that to ſuche as ye be, and to all the worlde it ſhulde be a perpetuall example of her lyfe, and memorie of her deathe. It was well done to ordeyne that law for an honeſt woman being with chylde, that it ſhulde be kept to all vertuous women. And as women wold, that the lawe of them that be with chylde ſhuld be kepte, ſo by the ſame lawe it is requiſite to require that they be honeſt. In the .vii. table of the lawe it is ſayd: we commande, that where there is coruption of cuſtomes, there lyberties ſhal not be kepte.
         
         
            ¶Howe tydinges was brought to the emperour, that the Mauritayns wold conquere great Britayne. Cap. xxii.
            
               
               IN the .liiii. yere of Marcus the emperours aege, and the tenthe yere of his election to thempire, In the month of Iuly, as he was in the citie of Naples, and not in verye perfite helthe, for he was ſoore payned with the goute in his foote: there came a Centurion in maner of a meſſager with great haſt, ſaying, that in great Britayn was ſodenly arryued a great nauye of warre, to the nombre of .C. &amp; .xxx. ſhyps of the realme of Mauritain, and the quantitie of .xx.M. men of foote: and .ii.M. men of armes: and that the kyng of Mauritayns brother was their capitayne, named Aſelipio, the whiche had taken lande at a hauen of the yle called Arpine, and that to reſyſte ſoo great a power, there were but a fewe people in the ſayde yle. The good emperour heringe theſe tidynges, though he felte it inwardely as a man, yet he feyned it outwardly as a diſcrete man with a ſadde countenaunce, and made fewe wordes. Than ſeinge, that buſines myght not be delayed, he ſayde theſe wordes: I wyll go with a fewe people, and do what I can. For better it were with a fewe to go betymes, than to tarye for many and goo to late. And forthwith the good emperour pourueyed, that all they of his palays ſhulde departe to go to Brytayne, and none to tarie behynde, to do hym ſeruyce. The cuſtome was, that the emperours ſhulde haue alwaye in theyr houſes ſuche men as were mete to be ſent forthe in any beſyneſſes that ſhulde happen for warre. And after that they were ſhypped, there ariued one of Britayne, that ſhewed, howe the Mauritayns were retourned, ſo that none of theym was lefte in the ile. Than this emperour kepte his houſe in a good poynt. Lyttel occaſion ſuffiſeth to them that be naturally of yll inclynation, to departe and ſprede throughe countreys to do harme: therfore he ſent them of his houſe

to the entent, that by occaſion of the warre, they ſhuld not leade an yll lyfe. Than the emperour fearyng the diſſolution of his courte, and boldenes of his offycers, to the intent they ſhuld not leaue vertue and growe in vice, he determyned on a day to call them to him ſecretely, and to ſay theſe wordes to them.
         
         
            ¶What themperour ſayd to them of his courte in eſchewyng ydelneſſe. Cap. xxiii.
            
               THe greatteſt ſygne in a vertuous mā is to do vertuous werkes, and vertuouſly to ſpende and occupie his tyme: and the greateſt ſigne of a loſte man is to leſe his tyme in naughtye warkes. The greatteſt happe of all, and the greatteſt deſire of men is to lyue longe. For dyuers chances that fall in ſhorte tyme may be ſuffered and remedyed by longe ſpace. Plato ſayde: A man that paſſeth his lyfe without profyte, as one vnworthy to lyue, oughte to haue the reſte of his lyfe take from hym. The fylthe of ſecrete chambres, the ſtynche of the pompe in ſhippes, nor the ordures of cities do not corrupt the ayre ſo moche, as ydell folke do the people. And as there is in a man, that occupieth his tyme well, no vertue but it encreaſeth, ſoo in hym, that occupieth his tyme ylle, there is no villanie but it is ſuſpecte in hym. A manne that is alwaye welle occupied, ought euer to be reputed as good: and the ydel man with out further enquerie, ought to be condemned as nought. Shewe me nowe, I deſyre you, what dothe nouryſſhe the corrupte and fowle wiedes, the nettelles that ſtynge, and the briers that pricke, but the erthe that is vntylled, and waxen wylde, and the fyeldes fulle of thyſtelles, whyche is not wyeded, and vyſyted with the ploughe?

O Rome without Rome, that nowe as vnhappy haſt but onely the name of Rome, bycauſe thou arte ſo dere in vertues, and makeſt vices good cheape. Yea yea, and I ſhall tell the, knoweſt thou wherfore thou arte ſo? bycauſe thou haſte vnpeopled the lanes and ſtretes of werkemen and offycers, and haſte peopled it all aboute with infinite vacaboundes. I knowe for trouthe, that the Samytes, Voſigoths, Aſtrogoths, and Peniens ſpredde in your territories, do you not ſo moche domage as do theſe ydell and loſte people ſtuffed in euery ſhoppe. All wryters canne not deny me, that if al natiōs wold cōquere Rome, they coude not take awaye one loope of the walles of it: and theſe ydell people haue troden and pulled vnder theyr feete the good renome of it. An infallyble rule it is: a man gyuen to exercyſes is vertuous, and one gyuen to lewtringes is a vicious perſon. What a diuine thing was it to ſe the diuine worldes of our predeceſſous, the whiche ſyth Tullius Hoſtilius, vnto Quintus Cincinatus dictatour, and ſith Cincinatus vnto Cyncinos, whiche were of the Syllans and Marians, there was neuer Conſulle at Rome, but he coude do ſome maner of offyce or occupation, wherwith they were occupied whan their offyce in the Senate was ended. Some coude paynte pyctures or other flatte workes: Other coude graue images and portry in wood or erthe, or other thynges, or coulde worke in ſyluer, and other mettalles: and other redde in ſcholes: In ſuche wiſe that the holy ſenate myght chuſe none, but if he were firſt knowen in ſome maner handy craft. I do fynde in the annales all that is aboue ſayde: and if I lye, I do gyue me to the flames of Vulcan. And there was an ancient lawe, that a myller, a ſmyth, a baker, or a poynt maker, myghte not be a Senatour, bycauſe men of the ſayd occupations were commonly taken with deceytes and gyles. Than regarde

the maner and change of tyme, and the corruption of cuſtomes, that .CCC. yeres euery man trauayled for ye renoume of Rome, &amp; this .viii.C. yeres euery man ſlepeth to the ſclander of Rome. Other thynges I fynd in the ſaid annales worthye of eterne memorie, the people of Rome hauyng .iiii. peryllous warres togyther (yonge Scipio ageynſt the Peniens, Mucio agaynſt the Cayens, Metellus ageynſt Alexander of Macedonie, and an other Metellus his brother agaynſt the Celtiberes of Spayne) the lawe beinge ſo ſoore kepte, that none ſhulde be taken from the myſterie and offyce that he occupied, &amp; the ſenatours hauynge extreme neceſſitie of meſſangers to ſende to the warres, whan the ſenatours had gone thre dayes aboute with the cenſors of Rome, they coulde not fynde one ydell man to be ſente forthe with their letters. I wepe for ioye, that I haue of this antyque felicitie: and I mourne for compaſſion of the myſerie nowe beinge. It is a confuſion to ſay, but I wyll ſay it: Twenty yeres I had offyce in the ſenate, and it is .x. yeres ſythe I haue ruled the empire, whiche is .xxx. in all, In the whiche ſeaſon I ſweare by the goddis immortall, I haue cauſed to whyppe, caſte in welles, to bury quicke, to hange, to prycke, and to baniſhe mo than .xxx.M. vacabundes, and .x.M. ydell women. Than what difference is there betwene that life and this dethe, that glorie and this peyne, that golde and this ordure, that antike Romayn werke and this our preſent inuentife ydelnes of Rome?
            ¶In the lawes of the Lacedemoniens this was written in the table of the ydell people: We commaunde as kynges, we pray as ſeruantes, we teche as philoſophers, and admonyſhe as fathers, that the fathers ſhall fyrſte teache their chyldren to labour the feldes, where by trauayle they may lyue, and not brought vp in places, where by ydelnes

they may be loſt. And that lawe ſaith ferthermore: If that yonge people obeye not as yonge, we wylle that the aged people do correcte and punyſhe them as aged. And in caſe that the fathers be negligent to commaunde them, or that they be diſobedient: We commande the prince than to be diligent to chaſtiſe them.
            ¶Certaynly theſe wordes are worthy to be noted: wherby Lygurge the kynge deſerued eternall memorie for his perſone, and the ſayd realme perpetuall peace in the common welthe. O Rome, what doſte thou? why regardeſt thou not theſe lawes of the Lacedemoniens, whiche with their frendely cuſtomes, dothe mocke thy brutall vyces? Slepeſt or wakeſt? O Rome thou wakeſt all the worlde to leaue ſwete trauayles, and ſlepeſt in vniuſte ydelneſſe. Thou arte ſure of ennemies, and thou careles art drowned in ſlouth and ydelnes. Than ſythe that they that bene farre of, do waken the, thou oughteſt to awakē them that thou kepeſt with the. I wolde ſpeake to al them to gyther of my palays, and longe ago I wylled ſo to doo, but the multitude of ſtraunge beſyneſſes ſomtyme cauſeth a man to forget his owne.
         
         
            ¶Of the peryllous lyuynge of them that haunt the courte continually. Cap. xxiiii.
            
               THan the emperour ioined theſe wordis to that he had ſayd. Many thinges I haue ſene, and of credible perſones I haue harde, whiche me ſemed to be yll, and none of them good. Specially one, whiche offendeth the goddis, ſclandreth the worlde, peruerteth the cōmon welthe, and endomageth the perſon ſelfe: whiche is this curſed ſlouth, and ydelnes that diſtroyeth them that be good, &amp; vtterly bringeth

to naught them that be yll. Sometime ſecretely, and halfe as in ſport openly I haue admonyſſhed and rebuked ſome of you, but I ſe it proufite none of you. On one ſyde the pricke of reſon conſtrayneth me to chaſtiſe you: ageine conſyderynge the malice of mankynde, all thoughe that it be prompte to yll, ſometyme I am determyned to ſuffre you. Many tymes I wold with furie chaſtiſe you as children, but I do refrayne it, conſideringe that ye are yonge, &amp; as yet knowe not the wiles of the worlde: for they holde ſo ſtyffely together the yl with the yl, &amp; among them make ſo great a leage of vices with the vices, that there be many that do by gyle ſuffre them ſelfe to be begyled, and that whan we eſcape fro a littell wyle, and knowe the begyler, we thynke that we are begyled all redy with other greatte wyles. I haue meruaylous great compaſſion of you my ſeruauntes, ſpeakynge to you as a lorde: and to you my chyldren ſpeakyng as a father, for to ſe you al the day and nyght wandryng through Rome as loſte perſones: and that worſte of all is, I perceyue that ye doo not perceyue your owne perdition. What greatter beaſtlynes can there be, than to ſe you wander lyke foles from houſe to houſe, fro tauerne to tauerne, from one gaſinge to an other, fro ſtrete to ſtrete, fro place to place, fro play to playe, fro reuellers to reuellers? And that more is, that ye knowe not, what ye deſire, nor what ye wold, where ye go, nor whens ye comme, what pleaſethe you, or what diſpleaſeth you: what is proufytable or loſſe vnto you. Nor ye remembre not, that ye were borne reaſonable menne, and that ye lyue as wylde folke amonge menne, and after ſhall dye as brute beaſtes. Fro whens wene ye that this comethe? The cauſe is the deſyre of beaſtelye mouynges, not reſyſtynge the deſyres of the luſte of youthe, and aboue all not applienge your mindes and willes to be wel ocupied.

Take hede amonge you of my courte, and forgette not this. Haue ye no thought but to ſeke newe paſtymes, and to borowe euery day? No man, of what condition ſo euer he be, excepte he haunt feates of armes, or other lernynge in ſome ordinarie exercyſe, ſhall haue his body luſtye and his ſpirite quicke: but ſhalbe acloyed in al other thinges, and wander frome ſtrete to ſtrete, as a vacabounde. The harte of man is noble, and hathe power continuallye for all actes, and all paſtymes of the bodye: and yet in three dayes it is annoyed of hym ſelfe alone, ſoo that with hym can not reſt one laudable exercyſe. Lyke as I am emperor of all the worlde, ſo it is reaſon, and muſte nedes be, that I haue folke of all nacions in my palays. And ſuche as the prince is, ſuche ſhal be his houſeholde: &amp; as his houſe is, ſo ſhal his courte be: &amp; as the courte is, ſo ſhal the hole empire be. For this cauſe a kynge ought to be ryghte honeſte: his houſe well ordered and ruled, his officers well lerned, and his courte well kepte in awe. Of my good life dependeth their good lyues, and conſequētly the yl liues. Euery nation lerneth in theyr particuler ſcoles, The Syriens in Babylon: the Perſians in Dorkes: the Indiens in Olympe: the Caldees in Thebes: the Grekes in Athenes: the Hebrewes in Helye: the Latines in Samie: the Frenche men in Orliance, the Spaniardes in Gades: and they all togyther in Rome. The vnyuerſall ſcole of all the worlde is the perſone, the houſe, and courte of a prynce. As we emperours do ſay, the ſame wyl our ſubiectes ſay: as we do, they wyll do: that we forſake, they wyll leaue: yf we leſe our ſelfes, they wyl loſe them ſelues: if we win, they wyl winne: and fynally our welth is theyr welth, and our harme is their harme. Truely the prince is bound to kepe his owne perſone honeſtly and well beſene, his hous and courte ſo well ruled, that all they that ſhall ſe it, maye

haue deſyre to folowe and do therafter: and that all they, that here therof, may deſyre to ſee it. Take ye hede, and let vs take hede: Haue ye in mynde, and let vs haue in mind, that they, which be of ſtrange lādes, going through ſtrāge landes into ſtrange landes, by their great trauayles commynge to haue and demaunde ſuccour and remedy of vs, may haue no cauſe to report any ſclanders of our yl cuſtomes. What thing more monſtruous can be noyſed among men, than that they ſhulde come and complayn of the theues of their countreys, to the theues of my courte? What greatter ſhame and inconuenience can be, than to demand Iuſtice of their menſleers, of the mankyllers of my court and houſe? What crueltie were ſo cruel, as to complayne of the vagaboundes of theyr landes, to the ſlouthfull and ydell folke of my houſe? What thyng can be more ſhamefull, than to come to accuſe theym that haue ſayde ylle of emperors, before them that euery day blaſpheme the goddis? What thynge can be more inhumayne, than to come to aſke iuſtyce on hym, that hath tranſgreſſed but ones, of them that neuer dyd good warkes? Truely in ſuche caſe the pore men ſhulde retourne with their ignoraunce begyled, and we ſhulde tarie with our cruell malyce ſhamed of men, and culpable before god. O howe many ſmalle matters do we chaſtiſe in men of ſmal reputation, which without breakyng of Iuſtyce we myghte forbeare? and howe many great thynges do the goddis ſuffre in the hye pryncis and lordes, the whiche not without Iuſtyce, they may greuouſely punyſhe? And by that cruell men as cruel, can pardon nothynge: and the goddis pitiefull ſcantely wyll chaſtyſe anye thynge. Yet for all this, I wolde that none ſhulde deceyue hym ſelfe, for though the goddis forbeare theyr iniuries, yet they leaue theym not vnpunyſſhed, by ſtraunge Iuſtice. The goddis ben in their chaſtiſementes

as he that gyueth a blowe to an other, the hyer that he lyfteth his bande, the greatter is the ſtroke on the cheke. By ſemblable wiſe, the mo yeres that they forbere our ſinnes, the more afterwarde do they hurte vs with peynes. Truelye I haue ſeene the goddis dyuers tymes to dyuers perſones forbeare dyuers ſynnes a greatte whyle, but at the laſte I haue ſene theym all vnwaares chaſtyſed with one chaſtiſement.
         
         
            ¶Howe the emperour wolde haue them of his courte to lyue. Capit. xxv.
            
               SIthe that the goddis haue ordeyned, and my fatall deſtenies haue permytted, that I ſhulde be choſen emperour (not to ſlouthfull) I haue laboured all that I myght, to vyſyte the Empire: ye lyttelle yonge folkes that are here, were gyuen to me of your fathers, for to nouryſhe you in my palays. And for you that ar bygger, I was deſyred to receiue you, in hope to haue gyftes and rewardes, and other I dydde chuſe to do my ſeruyce. The intention of the fathers, whā they bryng theyr chyldren to the court of princis, is to put theym from dalyance of their frendes, and banyſhe them from the wantonnes of their mothers. And me ſeemeth it is well done, for the chyldern from theyr youthe oughte to gyue them ſelfe to trauayle, wherby they ought to lyue, and reſiſte the diſfauour and falles of fortune. Ye are not come from your coūtreys to lerne the vyces of Rome, but to lerne many good maners that are in Rome, and leaue the yll maners of your landes. All that doo not this, and forſake trauayle: gyue them ſelfe to very ydelnes. The myſerable Rome hath moore nede of labourers for to labour, than of lordes and habytauntes, Patriciens, that

wyll but paſſe the tyme in reſt and pleaſures. I ſweare to you, that not for werynge the armes with the craft of weuynge, and the fyngers with ſpinnyng, the bordell houſes nowe adayes are fuller of ydel women, than the churches of good prieſtes. And I ſweare ageyne, that eaſelyer may be founde .x.M. yll women in Rome to ſerue in pleaſure of vyces, than .x.M. good menne to ſerue in the churches. I pray you, who ſleeth the marchantes in hye wayes? Who diſpoyleth wayfaringe men and pylgrimes on the mountaynes? Who piketh the lockes and breketh honeſt mens dores and wyndowes? Who robbe by ſtrengthe the churches? but theſe lewtrynge theues, which wyll not labour by day, but diſpoſe them to rob by nyght. O Rome, what harmes come to the for one onely euyll? Who hath fylled Italy ſo full of loſte people, the palays ſoo full of vnable perſones, the mountaynes ſo full of theues, the tauernes ſo full of yl women, and euery place ſo full of vacabūdes? but one, the canker of ydelnes and ſlouth, whiche deſtroyeth the god cuſtomes more than the windes and waters thyne olde worne walles. Beleue me oone thynge, for I wote that I ſay trouth therin, that the crafte of weauing, wherin all the naughty vilanyes are wouen and wrought, and the ſeede of all vnhappye vyces, the ſlydynge of all goodneſſe, the fallynge of all theym that be euyll, and the awakynge and prouokynge of all theſe, is but this fowle vyce of ſlouthe and idelneſſe. And more ouer I ſaye, that there is no vyce amonge all vyces, that bredeth ſo great a fyre, and cauſeth ſoo contynualle a ſyckeneſſe of ſlepe amonge aaged folke, and that puttethe good folke in ſoo great peryll, and dothe ſoo moche domage to theym that be euyll, as doth ydelnes. Who is it, that cauſeth ſedition amonge the people, and ſclaunder in Realmes, but they that reſte and doo nothynge: bycauſe they wolde eate the

foode gotten by ſweat of them that labour? Who is it, that fyndeth newe inuencions of tributes and forayne exactions, but ydell men, the which bycauſe they wyl not worke with theyr handes, fynde profite with infinite exactions? who maketh diſcētion betwene neighbors but idel folke? they deuide theyr ylle amonge theyr neighbours, bycauſe they occupy not theyr forces in good workes, nor refraine theyr tongues to clatter of other mens liues? who imagineth in theſe dayes ſo many malices in Rome, the whiche was neuer harde of our fathers, nor redde in our bokes: but vacabundes, that neyther apply nor ſette their wittes about nothynge els: but thynke howe to endomage other? The emperour that coude vanyſhe all theſe ydell perſons out of his empire, myght well auant him ſelfe to haue oppreſſed all the vices of the worlde. I wolde it pleaſed the immortal goddis, that of ſo many triumphis, that I haue hadde of ſtraungers, occupied in good exercyſes, that I hadde ſene one of the vacaboundes of Rome driuen out of all houſes. There was an auncient lawe, none myghte be taken and receyued for a citiſen in Rome, but he were firſt examined by the Cenſure. In the time of Cato Cenſorius, when any wolde be a citieſin of Rome, this examination was made of hym: He was not demaunded, of whens he was, nor what he was, nor whens he came, nor wherfore he came, nor of what kinne or auncient ſtocke he cam: but only they toke his handes betwene theyrs, and if they felte them ſofte and ſmothe, forthewith as an ydell vacabunde man they diſpatched and ſent him away: and if they found his handes harde and full of hard knottes, by and by they admitted hym a citezen and dweller in Rome. Alſo whan any officers toke any yll doers, &amp; put them in priſon, that was called Marmotine, in ſtede of information, the firſte thynge that they toke hede of, was theyr hondes, whiche

if they had bene as a labourers handes, and a worke man, though his crime were greuous, yet his chaſtiſement was mitigate, and more eaſye: and if the vnhappye pryſoner chāced to haue ydell handes, for a littel faut he ſhuld haue ſharpe puniſhement. It hath ben an old ſayeng: He that hath good handes, muſte nedes haue good cuſtomes. I ſay, I chaſtiſed neuer a labouringe man, but I was ſorye for it: nor I neuer cauſed to whyppe a vacabunde, but I was gladde of it. I wyll tel you more of this Catho Cenſorius, whiche was greately feared. For euen as chyldren in the ſcholes, herynge their maiſter commynge in, renne to their bokes, So when Catho went through the ſtretez of Rome, euery body went to theyr worke. O right happy baron, before whom the people feared more to be idel, than to do yl before any other. Than beholde ye at this houre, what force vertue hath, and howe valiaunte a vertuous man is, ſeinge that all the worlde feared Rome onely, for her worthynes in armes: and all Rome feared Catho, onely for his vertues. The aduentures of men are ſo dyuers, and the ſuſpect fortune gyueth ſoo many ouerthwart turnes, that after that a great ſpace ſhe hathe gyuen greatte pleaſures, incontinent we are cyted to her ſubtyll trauayles of repentaunce. O happy Cato Cenſorine, who with ſuche as haue folowed his wayes, are nowe ſure fro the abatementes of fortune. Than he that wyll haue glorye in this lyfe, and attayne glorye after deathe, and be beloued of many, and feared of all: lette hym be vertuous in doynge of good workes, and deceyue no manne with vayne wordes. I ſweare vnto you by the lawe of a man of worſhyppe, that if the goddes wolde accompliſſhe my deſyre, I had rather to be Cato with the vertuous policies that he vſed in Rome, than to be Scipio, with the abundance of blode, that he ſhedde in Affrike. All we knowe wel, that

Scipio hadde a great fame in beatynge downe of cities, and cuttynge innocentes throtes, and Catho hath attayned eternal, memorie in reformyng the people, pardoning treſpaſſours, and teachyng ignorant folke. Than ye may all ſee, yf I haue not good reaſon, more to deſyre to be Cato, to the profyte of many, than to be Scipio, to the preiudyce of ſo many. Lo my frendes, theſe wordes I haue ſaid, bycauſe ye may ſee, that our predeceſſours, ſomme in their owne londes, other in ſtrange landes, ſome beinge yonge, and ſome olde, in their tymes had glorye in their perſons, for them ſelfe: and for the worlde to come haue left no leſſe memory for their ſucceſſours and ofſprynge. And we doo all the contrary, I beinge emperour am lothe for to commande any yll, and our officers for theyr intereſt do wors. And where as we are ſet in dyuers pleaſures by our vice, we fall hourely into dyuers myſeries, and are noted to our greate infamie. By the which occaſion the iuſt goddes for our vniuſte workes, gyuinge iuſte ſentence, commaunde, that we lyue with ſuſpection, dye with ſhame, and to be buried with forgettefulnes, neuer to be hadde in memory. Than you of my courte take good hede, and prynte welle my wordes in your myndes: for who ſo ſeuer I ſe or fynde ydell from hensforth, I diſcharge hym out of my ſeruice. ye that be lerned may write and rede, ye that be men of armes and knyghtes, exercyſe you in feates of warre, ye that be officers, occupie you in your offices. And take this for certayne, that if ye take not this for a warnynge and monition, that I haue gyuen you betwene you and me, the punyſhementes that I ſhall gyue vnto you, ſhall be openly. And to the entente that ye haue it better in your memorie, and to be a doctryne to pryncis hereafter to comme, this preſente practiſe and remonſtrance I haue written in all tongues, and ſet it in the hyghe Capitoll with manye

other of my wrytynges. The goddis be kepers of you, and alſo they defende and kepe me from yll fortunes and myſaduentures.
         
         
            ¶Of a maruaylous and feareful monſter, that was ſeene in Scicile, and of his wrytynges. cap. xxvi
            
               IN the yere of the foundation of Rome vii.C.xx. and .xli. of the aege of Marcus the emperour, and .ii. yeres before he toke poſſeſſion of the empire, the .xx. day of the month Sextilis, which now is called Auguſt, about the tyme of the ſonne ſettynge, in the realme of Sycil, than called Trinacrie, in a citie called Bellyne, on the ſee now named Palerme, a port of theſe, there chāced a thing right perillous to them that ſawe it, and no leſſe fearefull to them that ſhall here it nowe. As they of Bellyne or Palerme were then celebratynge a feaſte with great ioye: for the gladnes that their Pirates had ouercome the army of the Numidiens, and had taken .x. of theyr ſhips, and caſt xxxii. perſones into the ſee, bycauſe at that time they were ennemies eche to other, and for the yl workes they dydde, were ſhewed the great paſſions, that paſſed among them. And as it is the cuſtomme, the thinge that theſe Pyrates get on the ſee, they departe it amonge them all, whan they come home. And whan they comme to lande, they ſpende that merily, that they gatte with greatte trauayle. It is a thynge well to be noted, howe all good and ylle hartes are applyed: The good men haue greatte deſyre to theyr triumphes, and couetous men to their lucre &amp; wynnynge.

Thus men ought to be beloued, though ſhortly after they ought to be abhorred. And alſo they ought to be abhorred▪ as though ſhortely after they ought to be beloued. Thus than the gouernours of the ſayde cytie, commaunded all the ſayde ſhyppes to be ſequeſtred into theyr owne handes, to the intent, that they ſhulde not be ſolde, nor the coueytous people to haue the aduauntage in the byenge of them. The cauſe was, for the cuſtome of the menne of the yles was, that all thynges ſhulde be kepte togyther, vnto the ende of the warre, or at leaſte tyll they had peace. This was a iuſte lawe: For many tymes is made ſtedfaſte appoyntmentes betwene great enmyes, and not all onely for the auncient hatred, but alſo for lacke of rycheſſe to ſatisfie the preſente domages. Thanne as all the people were withdrawen into theyr houſes aboute ſuppertyme, for it was ſommer, ſodenly there came a monſter into the myddes of the citie, after this ſhape: He ſemed to be of two cubytes of heighte, and he had but one eye, his heed was all pylled, ſo that his ſcul myght be ſene: He had none eares, but that a lyttell of his necke was open, wherby it ſemed yt he hard: He had two croked hornes as a gote: His ryght arme was longer than the left, his handes were lyke hors fete, he had no throte, his necke was egall with his heed: his ſhulders ſhone as pytche, his breſte and ſtomacke was all rough of heare, his face was lyke a man, ſaufe it had but one eye in the myddes of his forheed, and had but one noſethryll, from the waſte downewarde he was not ſeene, for it was couered, he ſatte on a chariot with .iiii. wheles, wherat were two lyons faſtened together before, and two beares behynde: and it coude not be determyned, wherof the chariotte was made, but there was no difference in facion therof, and other that were vſed commonlye: In the myddis of the ſayde chariotte was a caudron lyke a table

with two eares, wherin the ſayd monſter was: and therfore it was ſene but fro the gyrdelſtede vpwarde. He went about in the citie fro gate to gate a long ſpace caſtyng out ſpercles of fyre. The feare was ſo great, that dyuers women with chylde were delyuered with great peryll, and other that were weake harted fell in a ſwowne. And all the people great and ſmalle, leſſe and more, ranne to the temples of Iupiter, Mars, and Phebus, makyng importunate cries and clamours. And the ſame ſeaſon all the ſaid Pyrates were lodged in the gouernours palayes named Solyn. He was of the nation of Capue, and there was all the rycheſſe kepte. And whan this monſter had bene ouer all the citie with his charyot, than the lyons and beares brought hym to the palays, where the Pyrates were, and beinge very nygh to the gates that were faſte cloſed, the monſter cut an eare of one of the lyons, and with the bloode therof he wrote theſe letters. R. A. S. P. I. P. Theſe letters were a profe to all theym of highe ſpirite, to gyue declaration of them: and there were mo declarations than there were letters. But finally a woman diuinereſſe, or contrary, a ſothſayer, that was had in great reputation for her craftes, made the very declaration of the ſayde letters, ſayinge thus. R. reddite. A, aliena. S, ſi vultis. P, propria. I, in pace. P. poſſidere. Whiche all togyther is to ſaye, Render that perteyneth to other, yf that ye wylle in peace poſſeſſe your owne. Surely the Pyrates were ſoore affrayde of that dredeful commaundement: and the womā was greatly praiſed for her high declaration. Than forthewith the ſame nyght the monſter wente into a highe mountayne called as than Ianitia, and there by the ſpace of thre days was in the ſyght of all the citie: and in that ſeaſon the lyons made great rorynge and howlynge, and the beares and monſter keſte out greate fearefull flames.

And all that ſeaſon there neyther appered byrd in the aire, nor beaſte in the feldes, and all the men offred great ſacrifices to the goddis, in ſuche wiſe that they brake the veynes of their handes and fete, and offred their blode, to ſe if they myght appeaſe their goddis. After the thre days paſſed, ſodenly appered a clowde blacke and derke vppon the erthe, and it began to thunder and lyghten, with a greate erthequake, ſo that many howſes fell in the citie, and many of the dwellers and citeſins dyed. And than ſodaynely there came a flame of fyre from the monſter, and brent all the palays, where the ſayd Pyrates were, and the rycheſſes that were in it, ſo that all was conſumed in it, yea the very ſtones: and the domage was ſo great, that there fell mo than .ii.M. houſes. And there died as good as .x.M. perſons. And in the ſame place on the toppe of the mountayne, where as the monſter was, thēperour cōmanded to edifie a temple to the god Iupiter in memorie of the ſame. Of the whyche temple themperour Alexander, hauynge warre with them of the realme, made a ſtronge caſtell.
         
         
            ¶What befell to a citeſin of Rome in the tyme of this emperour Marcus. Cap. xxvii.
            
               THe ſame tyme that this aduenture chaunced in that Ile, there was dwellynge in the ſame citie a Romayne named Antygone, a lorde of noble bloude, and ſommewhat entred in age: and about two yere before, he, his wyfe, and a doughter of his were banyſhed Rome, and not his ſonnes. The occaſion was, There was an auncient laudable cuſtome, ſith Quintus Cincinatus dictatour, that two of the auncient ſenatours togyther ſhulde goo with the cenſure newly created, and the olde, in the month of Decēbre

for to viſite all Rome: and they to call euery Romayne aparte alone, ſhewynge hym the .xii. tables of their lawes and particular decrees of the ſenate, demandyng of them if they knewe any neyghbour in their quarter, that hadde broken theſe lawes. And if they dyd, it ſhulde be informed to the ſenate. And there all togyther to ordeyne punyſſhement, accordynge to the diuerſitie of the fautes that they hadde commytted: But the fautes commytted that preſente yere, they myght not chaſtiſe, but to aduertyſe them to amende afterwarde. And all ſuche as were ones warned, and in the nexte viſytation founde ſtylle vnamended, to be greuouſly punyſhed, and ſomtyme banyſhed. Theſe were the wordes of the lawe in the .v. table and third chapiter: It is ordeyned by the holy ſenate, by conſent of bliſfull men, receyuyng the auncient colonies, that if men being men in one yere do treſpas, the men as mē for the ſaid yere ſhall diſſimule and forbeare: but if they that be yll as yll do not amende, they that be good, as good, ſhal chaſtiſe them. Alſo the ſayd lawe ſaith, the firſt fautes are ſuffred, bycauſe they ar cōmitted with weake ignorāce: but if they cōtinue them, yt they be chaſtiſed, bycauſe their yll cometh of ſlouth and malyce. This inquiſition was euer made in the monethe of Decembre, bicauſe that ſoone after in the month of Ianiuer the offyces of Rome were dyuided. And it was reaſon, that they ſhuld knowe to whom they ſhulde giue or denye their dignities: to thentent that good ſhulde not be choſen in ſtede of yll, nor the yl in ſtede of good. The ꝑticular cauſe why they banyſhed the man &amp; his wife with their doughter was this: The ſecond emperour of Rome Auguſt ordeined, that none ſhuld be ſo hardy to pys at any dores of the tēples: and Caligula the .iiii. emperour commanded, that no woman ſhuld gyue any cedules to hange about the peoples neckes, to heale the feuer quartayne.

And Cato Cenſorine made a lawe, that no yonge man nor yonge mayden ſhulde ſpeake togyther at the conduites or welles, where they fetched water, nor at the ryuer, where they waſhed their clothes, nor at the ouens where they baked breadde, bycauſe all the yonge people of Rome that were wylde and wanton, ranne euer thyther. So it befell, that as the cenſures and conſules vyſited the quarter called mount Celio, there was a dweller named Antigonus accuſed, that he was ſene pyſſyng againſt the temple wall of Mars: and his wyfe was accuſed, that ſhe hadde ſolde cedules for feuer quartaynes: and lykewiſe his doughter was accuſed, that ſhe was ſene at the conduytes, ryuers, &amp; ouens, ſpekyng and laughing with yonge men of Rome. The whiche was a great ſhame to the maydens of Rome. Than the cenſures ſeinge the yll order, that they had foūd in the howſe of the ſayde Anthygone by the regeſters, by due examination, being warned afore, they were banyſhed into the yles of Cycill, for as longe as it ſhulde pleaſe the ſenate. And lyke as in edifices, ſumptuous and of greate eſtimatoin, one ſtone is not decayde or writhed out without ſhakynge or mouynge of an nother: euen lykewyſe is it in the chaunces of men. For commonly one vnhappynes chaunceth not, but an nother foloweth. And I ſaye this bycauſe Anthigone loſte not allonely his honour and welthe, but alſo he was banyſhed, and beſyde that by the tremblynge of the erthe his howſe fell downe, and ſlewe a welbeloued doughter of his. And all the whyle that this was done at Rome, &amp; that that befell of the monſter in Cicile, Marke the emperour was in the warres agaynſt the Aragons, and there he receyued a letter frome Antygone, wherin was reherſed his banyſſhynge▪ wherof the Emperour hadde great compaſſion, and to comforte hym, ſente hym an other letter.
         
         
            
            ¶Of a great peſtylence that was in Italy in this emperours tyme. Cap. xxviii.
            
               FIue yere after the dethe of Anthony the meke, father in law to Marcus Aurelius, and father to Fauſtine, there felle a peſtilence in Italye. and it was one of the .v. great peſtylences amonge the Romayne people. This mortalitie dured the ſpace of two yeres, and it was vnyuerſall thorough out all Italy, to the great domage and feare of all the Romains: for they thought that the goddis wold haue diſtroyed them, for ſome diſpleaſure that they had done agaynſt them. There dyed ſo many, as wel of great eſtate, as ryche and poore, greatte and ſmall, yong and olde, that the writers had leſſe trauayle to wryte the ſmal nombre of them that were lefte alyue, than to wryte the multytude of them that were deed. Lyke as whan a great buyldynge wyll falle, firſte there falleth ſome ſtone: In lyke wyſe the Romayns neuer had no great peſtilence in their tyme, but firſt they were thretned with ſome token, ſigne, or prodigie fro heuen. Two yere before that Hanyball entred into Italy, in an euenyng, whan the wether was clere and faire, ſodaynely it rayned bloudde and mylke in Rome. And it was declared by a woman, that the blode betokened cruel warre, and the mylke a mortall peſtilence. Whan Scilla retourned from Champayne, to put Marius his ennemy out of Rome, his men of warre and knyghtes ſawe in a nyght a fountayne that ranne bloudde, and who ſoo euer was bathed therin, ſemed to be poyſoned with venyme. Of the whiche prodigie folowed, that of .ii.C. and .l.M. dwellers in Rome, what with theym that dyed with the ſwerde, and other conſumed by peſtilence, were conſumed with Scilla, and of them that ſledde with Marius, of the

ſayde great multitude of Romayns, there abode alyue no mo but .xl.M. perſons. Certaynly Rome neuer receyued ſo greate domage in .vi.C. yeres before, as they dydde by their owne propre people. All the tyrantes were neuer ſoo cruell ageinſt ſtrange landes, as the Romayns were than ageinſt their owne propre landis. And this ſeemeth to be true, bycauſe the ſame day yt Scilla paſſed through Rome with his bloody ſwerde, a capitayn of his ſayd to him: Sir Scylla, if we ſlee them that beare armour in the feldes, &amp; them that bere no armour in their houſes, with whom ſhal we lyue? I coniure the by the hye goddis, ſith we be borne of women, let vs not ſlee the women: and ſyth we be men, lette vs not ſlee the men. Thou thynkeſt that in ſleinge al the Romaynes, to make a common welth of beaſtis of the mountaynes. Thou entreſt with a crie to defende the common welthe, and to put out the tyrantes that diſtroye the common welthe, and we do remayne tyrantes our ſelues. To myn vnderſtandynge that capitayn merited as great glorie for the good wordes that he ſpake, as Scilla dydde merite chaſtiſement for the crueltie that he dyd. This we haue ſaid, bycauſe that ere ſuche damages dyd falle, there appered before certayne prodigyes and tokens. No leſſe token was ſhewed before the mortalitie that fel in the time of this good emperour, the whiche was a fearefull thyng. The caſe was ſo: On a day as themperour was at the tē
               ple of the Virgins Veſtales, ſodaynly there entred in two hogges, and ranne aboute his fete, and there felle downe deed. And on an other day as he came frome the high Capitoll, for to haue gone oute at the gate Salaire, he ſawe two kytes ioynynge togyther with their talantes: and ſoo fel downe deed at the emperours fete. And within a ſhorte whyle or ſeaſon after, as the ſayd emperour came fro huntynge, his houndes rennynge at a wylde beaſt, as he gaue

two greyhoundes that he loued well, water to drinke with his owne handes, ſodenly they fel downe deed at his fete. Than he remembryng the ſwyne, the kytes, and the greyhoundes deed ſo ſodeynly, he was greatly diſmayed, and aſſembled all his prieſtes magitiens, and diuines, demandynge what they ſayde to the prodigies. And they by thoſe thinges paſſed, iudged the dede preſent, and determyned, that within two yeres the goddis wold ſende great &amp; greuous punyſhementes to Rome. Than within ſhort while after there began a warre agaynſte the Parthes, whereby there fel the yere after great famyn and peſtylence amōge the Romayns. This peſtilence came with ſores vnder the arme pittes, ſo that all the ſenate fledde away, and the emperour alone abode ſtyll in the capitoll. Than the ayre began to be ſo corrupt, that though he ſcaped the peſtylence, yet he was vexed with hote feuers. Wherfore he was fayn to leue Rome, and went into Champayne: and fynally in the citie of Naples he made his abode durynge the tyme that the peſtilence was in Rome.
         
         
            ¶How Mar. anſwered his phiſitions that wold haue him leaue his ſtudie. Cap. xxix.
            
               THe emperour beinge in the ſayde citie of Naples, where as other ſoughte paſtyme to conſerue their lyues, this emperour occupied him ſelfe in his bokes to augment ſcience. A man coude do hym no better ſeruice, than to ſeke to gette hym a newe boke: not ſuche as was written in his tyme, but ſuche as were forgotten for age. This emperour was not onely a louer of olde and antike bookes, but alſo of auncient ſtories, and ſet very great ſtoore by theym. And he thus beinge in the cytie ſycke and very yll at eaſe,

there was brought to hym out of a citie of Aſia called Helia, by certayne Hebrewes, a boke writen in Hebrew: &amp; he toke ſuche pleaſure in that boke, that ofte tymes he wolde leaue his meate and goo to ſtudy: and for all that he was in his hote feuer, he wolde not leaue to reede, for all that his phiſitiens warned him, and his frendes prayde hym: and they that were about hym, counſaylled hym, and demanded hym, why he lefte to procure the helth of his perſone in ſo moche redynge. He aunſwered: By the goddis that we honour I coniure you, and for the frendſhyp that is betwene vs, I pray you lette me alone. Ye knowe well, that ſuche as are of a delycate bloode, haue not ſoo moche ſolicytude as the ruſticall people, that haue hard ſynewes and be of a more harder complexion.

               dyng. This is the differēce that I haue of eyther of them: The ydeote kepeth dyete from bookes, and reſteth on his meate, and the wyſe man abhorreth meate, and draweth hym to his bokes. If they knewe, that knowe not, what thynge knowlege is, I ſweare to you, they ſhuld ſee what auayleth more the lyttell knowlege that a wyſe man hath, than the greatte ryches of the ryche man. For the myſerable ryche perſone, the more that he encreaſeth in rycheſſe, the more he diminiſheth in frendes, and groweth in ennemyes to his domage. And he that is wyttie, the wiſer that he is, the better he is beloued of theym that be good, and feared of them that be yll for his profite. One of the thinges, wherin I holde my ſelfe moſte bounde to the goddis is this, that they haue cauſed me to compas the tyme as I haue done, the whiche is no lyttel gift for a man to lyue in this worlde. I ſay it is, bycauſe I haue had great compaſſion of the poore, that be verye poore, of wydowes, of

them that be ſorowfull and vnhappy, and of Orphelins. But without compariſon, I haue had greatteſt compaſſiō of them, that lacke knowlege. For the goddis, making menne ignoraunt by naturalitie, myghte haue made them goddis by connynge and knowledge: and as the ſlouthefull men are tamed and made leſſe than men, by their negligence, ſo certainly bleſſed he is, that is not contente to be a man, but if he procure to be more than a man, by his vertue. And curſed is that man, that knoweth not to be a man, but maketh hym ſelfe leſſe than a man by his vyce. By the iugement of al philoſophers, there is but one, that is the fyrſte cauſe, which is one god immortal, and if there be dyuers goddis in the heuens, it is bycauſe there are diuers vertues in the erthe. And in the worlde, that is paſte, whan the ſymple men were ſeruauntes and bonde menne, and the good men rulers and gouernours, they were then ſo eſtemed, bycauſe they were knowen and renowmed for theyr good werkes in theyr lyfe. Soo that they were holden and reputed as goddis after theyr deathe. This is the ryghte rewarde, that commeth of vertue. It is a thynge conſonaunt to reaſon, that they that be good amonge ſoo many yll in this lyfe, ſhulde be greattely honoured among the goddis after theyr deathe. Ye are not wel content with me, bycauſe I am alwaye redynge▪ but I am worſe content with you, bycauſe I neuer ſe boke in your handes: ye thynke it great trauayle, to a ſycke man, to rede, and I repute it a very peryllous thynge, for a hole manne, to reſte and be idell. Ye ſay, my redyng is cauſe of my feuer quartayne in my fleſſhe: and I ſaye, that ydelnes engendreth great peſtilence. Syth I may profite by my bokes, let no man haue compaſſion of my trauayle. For I deſire rather to dye as a wiſe perſon, amonge wiſe men, than to lyue ignorantly amonge men. I demaunde one thynge of you:

A man, preſuming to be a man, and is not lerned, what difference is betwene hym and other beaſtes? Certaynly, the beaſtes are more profitable to labour the erthe, than ſymple perſons be, to ſerue the common welthe. A pore oxe giueth his ſkynne to make ſhone, his fleſhe to be eaten, and his ſtrength to labour: and a poore ſymple ſhepe doth profite, his flece and wol to make clothe, &amp; his mylke to make cheſe: But what profiteth a foliſhe ideote man? Nothing, but offendeth the goddis, ſclaundereth innocentes, eateth the breade of other, and is chiefe heed of vacabundes. Of trouth, if it lay in my handes to do, I had rather giue lyfe to a ſimple oxe, than to a malycious ideot. For the beaſt liueth, for the vtilitie of dyuers, without doing domage to any other: and the ſimple ideot man liueth, to the domage of all other, and without profite to any perſon. Therfore thinke well, why I am not pleaſed with theym that be ignoraunt, and loue them that be lerned. Harke ſyrs, what I ſhall ſhewe you: That man ſemeth good, that is meke and gentyll of condition, ſofte in wordes, and reſtefull in his perſone, and gracious in conuerſation: And contrary wiſe, that perſonne ſoore diſpleaſeth me, that is ſharpe of wordes, ſoore moued in his warkes, riottous in his condicion, and double of his promys, and harde harted. Alſo I ſay, that if any thing wante in a wiſe man by nature, he ſupplyeth it by ſcience: and he that is ignorant and folyſhe, if he want diſcretion, he ſupplyethe it with his malice. And truſt ſurely, that a worthy vertuous man therby becomethe wiſe, and he is to be truſted: and he that is of an other maner, beware of hym, for he goeth aboute to ſell his malice. He that wyll begile an other, the firſt thing that he doth is, he ſheweth hym ſelfe to be ſymple and ignoraunt. For a man beinge in credence, may ſoone ſprede abrode his malyce. The mothes and ſofte wormes, freete

freate the clothe, and the canker worme perſeth the bone, and flatterynge men begyle all the worlde.
         
         
            ¶Howe ſcience ought to be in princis. Cap. xxx.
            
               THe ſaid emperour, folowing his purpoſe, ſaid: Frendes beholde, howe greate domage ignorance dothe to all men. And thoughe it be domageable to euery man, yet it is moſte hurtefull to a prince, whiche oughte, not onely to be content, to knowe as moche as any other wiſe perſon knoweth, but to knowe that euery man knoweth, ſythe he is lorde ouer all other. To my iugement, theſe princis ar not choſen, that they ſhulde eate more meate, thā all other, nor to be apparayled rychelyer than all other, nor to renne faſter than all other: but with preſuppoſition yt they oughte to knowe more than all other. Whan a prince wyll refrain his ſenſualitie, than he ought to regarde, that his perſon be right honeſt, and remēbre this worde, that is, The gretter that a prince is of power, aboue other, the more ought he to be vertuous aboue al other. For certainly the greatteſt infamy is, to ſe a man moſt mighty &amp; moſt riche aboue all other, and than to be knowen an ideot, &amp; leſſe of knowlege than other. Al defautes in a gouernour may be borne ſaue ignoraunce: for ignoraunce in a prince, is a ſtroke of peſtilence: and it ſleeth dyuers, and infecteth all perſons, and vnpeopleth the realme, chaceth awaye frendes, &amp; gyueth harte to enmies of ſtrange natiōs, that were in drede, &amp; finally domageth his perſon, and ſclaūdreth euery one. ¶Whan Camyll triūphed ouer the frenche men, the day of his triumphe he wrote theſe wordes in the capytoll: O Rome, thou haſt ben moder of all wiſe men, and ſtepdame to al fooles. ¶Theſe were worthy wordes of ſuch a lorde.

and but if my remembrance begyle me, certaynely Rome was more renoumed for wiſe perſons, that came thyther, than for the featis of warre, that were ſente from thenſe. Our auncient Romayns were more feared, for their wiſedome and knowlege, than for their conqueſtes. Al the erth feared them more, that tourned leaues of bokes in Rome, than them, that were armed with armour. For that cauſe Rome was neuer vanquiſhed: and though their armyes were deuyded and broken, yet they neuer lacked wyſe mē. I can not ſay it without teares, Rome is fallen frome the moſt hight of her eſtate, not for faut of money and armes, for to fight withall, but for lacke of wyſe men, and vertuous, for to gouerne. Our forefathers wanne lyke men, and we leſe lyke ſimple chyldren. All thynges that are deſired of men, they atteyn by trauayle, ſuſteyn with thought, and departe fro, with great annoyance. And the reaſon is this: There is nothynge ſo good, nor ſoo well beloued, but the courſe of tyme, cauſeth vs to leaue it, and to diſprayſe and abhorre it, or to be wery therof. This is the vayn vanite of the world, and loſt tyme loſt: for with their yonge deſires, they do refrayne their deſires. They wolde oftentimes attayne a thynge, and after they ſtudy, howe to go therfro agayne. And yet to ſhewe further their lyghtnes, that that coſte moche, they gyue for a lytel price. That that they loue at one tyme, they hate at an other: and that that they with great ſtudy and labour haue atteyned, with greatte furye they forgo. And me thynketh this is the ordinaunce of the goddis, that he that loueth, ſhall haue an ende, and it that is beloued, ſhall take an ende: and the tyme that we are in, ſhall ende. Than it is reaſone, that the loue, wherwith we doo loue, ſhall ende in lykewiſe. Thus our appetite is ſo diſhoneſt, that in ſeinge we deſire it, and in deſyryng we procure it, and in procurynge, we attayne it, and in the attayninge

we abhorre it, and in the abhorryng, we leaue it: and than forthewith agayne, we procure an other thynge, and that newe procurynge, we abhorre agayne: In ſuche wyſe, that whan we begynne to loue a thyng, than we fall agayne to hate it, and in the fallynge to hate it, we begyn ageyn to loue an other thynge. So thus fynally, our lyfe dothe ende, er our couetyſe dothe leaue vs. It is not thus of wyſedome and knowlege, the which, if it ones entre into a mans hart, it cauſeth hym to forget the trauayle, that he toke in the attaynynge thereof. For he taketh the tyme paſt as good, and enioyeth with rightful ioy, the tyme preſent, and hateth ydelnes. Nor he is not contente with that he knoweth, but inforceth his appetite, to knowe more, louynge that other leaueth: and leauyng, that other loueth. Finally, he that is perfittely wyſe, ſporteth in this worlde with trauayle, and in trauailyng in bokes, is his reſte. We haue not to ſay of all thinges, but of that we fele of them. For it is an other maner to ſpeake by ſimilitude of a ſtranger, and of our owne experience. And in this caſe I ſaye, that though we hope of no rewarde of the goddis, nor honour amonge men, nor memorie of the worlde to come: yet am I ryght gladde, to be al onely a philoſopher, to ſe howe gloriouſly the philoſophers haue paſſed their tyme. I demaunde one thynge, whan myne vnderſtandynge is dulled, in that I haue to doo, and whan my memorie is troubled, in that I haue to determyne, and whan my bodye is compaſſed with dolours, and whan my harte is charged with thoughtes, and whan I am without knowlege, and whan I am ſet about with peryls, where can I be better accompanied, than with wiſe men, or els redynge amonge bokes? In bokes I fynde wyſedom, wherby I may lerne: alſo there I fynd worthynes, which I may folowe: I fynd there prudence, to counſell me, I fynde ſuche as be ſorowfull,

with whom I may wepe. I fynde them there that be merye, with whom I may laughe: I fynde there, ſymple folke, at whom I may ſport: I fynde that is nought, whiche I may leaue: And fynally, in bokes, I fynde, howe in proſperitie, I ought to behaue me: and howe in aduerſitie, I ought to guyde me. O, howe happy is that manne, that hath wel red: And yet more happy is he, that though he knoweth moche, yet ſtayeth vppon counſayle. And yf this be true generally, than moche more is it neceſſary, yt he kepe the true waye, whiche gouerneth all other. It is a rule infallible, that a prince being wyſe, can neuer be ſimply good, but very good: and the prince that is ignorant, can not be ſimply yll, but very yll. A prince, that is not wel fortunate, his wyſedome may greately excuſe hym to his people, of his myſfortune gyuen to hym by fortune. Whan a prince is greatly beloued of his cōmontie, and is vertuous of his perſone, than euery man ſaythe, if he haue not good fortune: Al though our prince wāt good fortune, yet his worthy vertues fayle not: and though he be not happy in his ententes, yet at the leaſte he ſheweth his wyſdom in the meane ſeaſon. And thoughe fortune denye hym at one howre, yet at an other tyme. ſhe agreeth, by his wyſedom. And contrary wyſe, an vnwyſe prince, and hated of his people, by yuell fortune, renneth into great peryll. For if ylle ſuccede to hym in weighty mattiers, than incontynent it ſhalbe ſaid, it is by reaſon of the ignoraunce of hym ſelfe, or by yll counſell of ſuch as be about hym: &amp; if goodnes ſuccede to hym, it ſhall not be attrybuted by reaſon of his good gouernaunce, but that fortune hath ſuffered it, and not by the circumſpecte wyſedome, that he hath hadde in the meane ſeaſone, but that it was of the pitie, that the goddis had of hym. Than ſithe it is thus, a vertuous and a worthy prince, in his ydell tymes, ought ſecretely to rede

is bokes, and openly to common and counſell with wyſe men. And in caſe, yll fortune wyll not permyt hym, to take their counſelles, yet at the leaſt, he ſhal recouer credence among his ſubiectes. I wil ſay no more to you, but I eſtem the knowlege of a wiſe perſō ſo moch, that if I knewe, that there were ſhops of ſciēces, as there is of other marchaundiſe, I wold giue al yt I haue, only to lerne, that a wiſe mā lerneth in one day. Finally I ſay, that I wil not giue, that litel that I haue lerned in one houre, for al the gold in the worlde: And more glory haue I, of the bokes that I haue red, and of ſuch workes, as I haue writtē, thā of al the victories, that I haue had, or of ye realmes that I haue won.
         
         
            ¶What a vilayne ſayde to the ſenatours of Rome, in the preſence of the emperour. Cap. xxxi.
            
               THis emperour, being ſicke, as it is aforeſaid, on a day, as there were with hym diuers phiſitiōs and oratours, there was a purpoſe moued amonge them, howe greately Rome was chaunged, not all onely in edifices, but alſo in cuſtomes, and was full of flaterers, and vnpepled of mē, that durſte ſay the trouthe. Than the emperour ſayd: The fyrſte yere, that I was conſul, there came a poore vilayne from the riuer of Danubie, to aſke iuſtice of the ſenate, ayenſte a cenſure, who dydde dyuers extortions to the people: and he hadde a ſmall face, and great lyppes, and holowe eyes, his heare curled, bare heeded, his ſhoes of a porkepes ſkyn, his cote of gotis heare, his gyldell of bulle ruſhes, and a wyld eglantine in his hand. It was a ſtrāge thinge to ſe him ſo monſtruous: and meruayl, to here his purpoſe. Certainly, whan I ſaw him com into the ſenate, I wende it had bene ſome beaſte, in the figure of a manne.

And after I had harde hym, I iuged hym one of the goddes, if there be goddes amonge men. And as the cuſtome in the ſenate was, that the complayntes of the poore perſons were hard, before the requeſtis of the ryche: this villayne had lycence to ſpeake, and ſo beganne his purpoſe, wherin he ſhewed him ſelfe as bolde in wordes, as extreme and baſe in his aray, and ſayd: O ye auncient fathers, and happy people, I Myles, dwellynge in a citie on the ryuer of Danubie, doo ſalute you Senatours, that are here aſſembled in the ſacred ſenate. The dedes do permytte, and the goddis ſuffre, that the capytayns of Rome, with theyr great pride haue reduſed vnder ſubiection, the vnhappy people of Germany. Great is the glory of you Romayns, for your battayles that ye haue wonne throughout all the worlde. But if writers ſay true, more greater ſhalbe your infamy, in time to come, for the cruelties that ye haue done to the innocentes. My predeceſſours had people nyghe to the flode of Danubie, and bycauſe they dyd ylle, the erthe wared drie, and they drewe to the frſeſhe water: than the water was noyful to them, and they returned to the main lande. What ſhal I ſay than? your couetiſe is ſo great, to haue ſteangers goodes, and your pryde ſoo renoumed, to commaunde all ſtrange landes, that the ſee maye not profite vs, in the depenes therof, nor the erthe, to aſſure vs in the caues therof. Therfore I hope in the iuſt goddes, that as ye, without reaſon, haue caſt vs out of our houſes and poſſeſſions: ſo other ſhal com, that by reaſon, ſhal caſt you out of Italy and Rome. And infallible rule it is, that he, that taketh wrongfully an other mans good, ſhall leſe the right of his owne. Regard ye Romains, though I be a villain, yet I knowe, who is iuſt &amp; rightwiſe, in holding his owne: and who a tyrant, in poſſeſſynge others. There is a rule, that what ſo euer they, that be yl, haue gathered in

many dayes, the goddes taketh fro them in one day: and contrarie wiſe, all that euer the good haue loſte in manye days, the goddis reſtoreth to them agayne in one day. Beleue me in one thynge, and haue no doute therin, that of the vnlaufull wynning of the fathers, there foloweth the iuſte loſſe to theyr chyldren. And if the goddes toke from them, that be yll, euery thyng, that they haue wonne, as ſoone as it is wonne, it were but reaſone: but in lettynge them alone, therby they aſſemble by lyttel and lytel diuers thynges, and than, whan they thynke leaſt theron, is taken from them all at ones. This is a iuſte iugement of the goddis, that ſithe they haue done yll to dyuerſe, that ſome ſhulde do yll to them. Certaynely it is not poſſible to any vertuous man, if he be vertuous, that he take any taſte in an other mans good. And I am ſore abaſhed, how a man, kepynge an other mans good, can lyue one houre. Syth he ſeeth, that he hath don iniure to the goddis, ſclādred his neibours, pleſed his enmies, loſt his frendes, greued them that he hath robbed, and aboue all, hath put his owne perſon in peryll. This is a ſhamefull thynge amonge menne, and culpable before the goddis, the man that hath the deſyre of his harte, and the brydelle of his warkes at ſuche lybertie, that the lyttel, that he taketh and robbeth fro the poore, ſemeth moche to hym: but a great dele of his owne, ſemeth to hym but lyttel. O what an vnhappy man is he, whether he be Greke, or latin, that without conſideration, wyll change his good fame into ſhame, iuſtice into wrōg, ryght into tyranny, or trouth into leſynge, the certayne into vncertayne, hauynge annoyaunce of his owne goodes, and dye for other mens? He that hath his principall intention, to gather goodes for his chyldren, and ſeke not for a good name, amonge them that be good: it is a iuſte cauſe, that he leſe all his goodes, and ſo without good name to

to be ſhamefull amonge them that be yl. Let all couetous and auaricious people knowe, that neuer amonge noble men was gotten good renoume, with ſpredynge abrode of yll gotten goodes. It can not endure many dayes, nor yet be hydden vnder couert many yeres: a man to be holden ryche amonge them that be ryche, and an honorable man amonge them that be honorable: for he ſhal be infamed, of that he hath gathered his ryches, with greate couetyſe, or kepeth it with extreme auarice. O if theſe couetous people, were as couetous of theyr owne honour, as they be of other mens goodes: I ſwere to you, that the lyttel worme or mothe, that eateth the gounes or clothes of ſuche couetous people, ſhulde not eate the reſte of theyr lyfe, nor the canker of infamie, diſtroye theyr good name and faame at theyr deathes. Harke ye Romaynes, harke what I wyll ſay, I wolde to the goddis, that ye coude taſte it. I ſe, that al the world hateth pride, and yet is there none, that foloweth mekenes and humilitie. Euery man condempnethe aduoutrie, and yet I ſee none, that liueth chaſte: Euerye man curſeth exceſſe, and I ſe none lyue temperately: euery man prayſeth pacience, and I ſe none that wyll ſuffre: euery man blameth ſlouth, and I ſe none, but they be ydel: euery one blameth auarice, and yet euery body robbeth. One thynge I ſay, and not without wepynge: I ſay euery manne, with his tongue onely, prayſeth vertue, and yet they them ſelfes, with al theyr lymmes are ſeruantes vnto vices. I ſaye not this onely for the Romaynes, whiche bene in Illirie: but I ſaye it, by the ſenatours that I ſe in the ſenate. All ye Romaynes, in your deuiſes aboute your armes beare theſe wordes: Romanorum eſt debellare ſuperbos, et parcere ſubiectis, That is, it pertainethe to Romaynes, to ſubdewe them that be proude, and to forgyue ſubiectes. But certainely ye maye better ſaye: hit partayneth to Romains,

to expell innocentis, and to trouble &amp; vexe wrongfully peaſible people. For ye Romayns are but diſtroyers of peaſible people, and theues to robbe frome other, that they ſweate for.
         
         
            ¶Of dyuers other thynges that the vylayne ſayd before the ſenate. cap. xxxii.
            
               O Ye Romayns, ſayd this vyllayn, what action haue ye, that are brought vppe nygh to the ryuer of Thyber, agaynſte vs, that are nyghe to rhe ryuer of Danubie? Haue ye ſeene vs frendes to your ennemies? or haue we declared vs your ennemyes? or haue ye harde ſay, that we haue lefte our owne lande, and inhabyted any ſtraunge londes? or haue ye harde, that we haue rebelled ageynſt our lordes, or haue troubled any ſtrange realmes? or haue ye ſente vs anye ambaſſadours, to deſyre vs to be youre frendes? or hath any hooſte of ours come to Rome to diſtroye you, as our enmies? or hath any kynge dyed in our realme, that in his teſtament made you heyres to our realme? or what antyke lawe haue ye founde, wherby we ought for to be your ſubiectes? Of trouthe in Almayne hereby, they haue felt your tyranny, as wel as we haue herde of your renoume. And more ouer I ſay, that the names of the Romaynes, &amp; the crueltie of tyrantes, aryued togither in one day vppon our people. I wote not what ye wyll ſay, that the goddis care not for the hardines of mē: for I ſee, he that hath moche, dothe tiranny, to him that hath but lytell. And he that hath but lyttell, though it be to his infamy, wyll ſerue him that hath moche. So that diſordred men appoynt thē with ſecrete malice, &amp; ſecrete malice gyueth place to open theft: and the open robbery no manne reſiſteth. And therfore it cometh, that the couetyſe of an yll man neceſſarily is had

to be complete, to the preiudyce of many good men. One thynge I wyl ſay, that eyther the goddis ought to thynke, howe theſe men ſhall haue an ende, or elles that the world muſt ende: or els the worlde, to be no worlde: Or fortune muſte holde ſure with you, if all that ye haue won in .viii.C. yeres, ye leſe not in .viii. dayes. And where as ye are become lordes ouer many, ye ſhall become ſlaues to all the worlde. Certaynely the goddis ſhall be vniuſte, withoute that thynge come, that muſte fall to the worlde hereafter. For that man that maketh hym ſelfe a tyraunt perforce, it is ryght, that he retourne to be a ſlaue by Iuſtice. And it is reaſon, that ſyth ye haue taken our myſerable lāde, that ye kepe vs in Iuſtyce. I haue great meruayle of you Romains, that ye ſend ſo ſmple perſōs to be our iuges. For I ſwere to the goddis, they can not declare your lawes, nor vnderſtande ours. I wote not whether ye ſente them thyder or no, but I ſhal ſhewe you, what they do there. They take openly, what ſo euer is delyuered to theym: and they doo their profytte with that they deſyre in ſecrete. They chaſtiſe the poore perſonne greuouſely, and they forbeare for money, them that be riche: they conſent to many wronges, to bryng them after to the lawes: &amp; without goodes it boteth not to demand Iuſtice: and fynally, vnder ye colour that they be iuges, vnder the ſenate of Rome, they ſay they may robbe all the londe. What is this ye Romayns? ſhall your pride neuer haue an ende in commandyng, nor your couetyſe in robbynge? Saye what ye wyll. If ye do it for our chyldren, charge theym with yrons, and make theym ſclaues: If ye do it for our goodes, goo thyther and take them: If our ſeruyce doth not contente you, ſtryke of our heedes. Why is not the knyfe ſoo cruell in our throtes, as your tyrannies be in our hartes? Doo ye knowe, what ye haue doone ye Romaynes? ye haue cauſed vs to ſweare,

neuer to retourne to our wyues: but to flee our chyldren, rather than to leaue them in the handes of ſo cruell tyrā
               tes. We had leauer ſuffre the beaſtly motions of the fleſhe for .xx. or .xxx. yeres, than to dye without wounde, leauynge our children ſclaues. ye ought not to do this ye Romains. Alond taken per force, ought the better to be ruled, to thē
               tent that the myſerable captiues, ſeinge Iuſtice duely miniſtred to them, ſhulde therby forgette the tyranny paſſed, and to ſet their hartes to perpetuall ſeruitude. And ſythe we are come to complayne of the grefes that your Cenſures do vpon the fludde of Danubie, peraduenture you of the ſenate wyll here vs. Wotte ye what they doo? Harke, and I ſhall ſhewe you. If there come a ryghte poore man, to demande Iuſtice, hauyng no money to gyue, nor wyne to preſent, nor oyle to promyſe: they fede hym with wordis,
ſayenge, howe he ſhall haue Iuſtyce, but they make hym to waſte the lyttell that he hath, and gyue hym nothynge, though he demaunde moch. And ſo the myſerable perſon, that came to complayne, retourneth complaynyng on you all, curſynge his cruell deſtenies, and maketh exclamatiō vppon the rightwiſe goddis. I lyue with acornes in winter, and cutte downe the grene corne in ſommer, and ſometyme I go a fyſhynge for paſtyme, ſo that the moſte parte of my lyuynge, is feedyng in the fieldes, and ye wote not why: here me, and I ſhall ſhewe you. I ſe ſuche tyrannies in your cenſures, and ſuche robberyes amonge the poore people, and I ſe ſuche warres in that realme, and hope of ſo ſmall remedy in your ſenate, that I am determined, as moſte vnhappy, to banyſhe my ſelfe out of myn own hous, and honeſt company, to thentent that my harte ſhulde not fele ſo great a hurte. It is a great peyne to ſuffre the ouerthrowe of fortune: but it is a greatter yll, whan one feleth it, and can not remedy it: and yet without compariſon my

greatteſt grefe is, whan my loſſe may be remedied, and he that may, wyll not, and he that wyll, can not remedy it. O ye cruell Romaynes, if the ſorowes all onely ſhulde be reduced to memory, that we ſuffre, my tonge ſhulde be wery, and all my membres faynte, and myne eyes ſhoulde wepe bluddy teares, &amp; my fleſhe wold conſume. This in my lāde maye be ſene with eies, harde with eares, and felte in propre perſone. Certaynly my harte departeth, and my ſoule is troubled, &amp; myn entrayles breake. And I beleue yet, the goddis wyll haue compaſſiion. I wylle deſire you to take my wordes for ſclaunder. For ye Romaynes, if ye be Romayns, ye may well ſee, that the trouble, that we haue, cometh by men, and amonge men, and with men, and by the handes of men. Than it is no meruayle, though men fele it as men. One thynge comforteth me, and dyuers tymes amonge other, that be vnfortunate, it cometh to ſuch purpoſe, the whiche is, I thinke the goddis be ſo ryghtwiſe, that their fierce and cruell chaſtiſementes come not but by our owne cruell ſhrewdnes: &amp; our ſecrete ſinnes awaketh vs ſo, that we haue open iuſtyce. But of one thynge I am ſore troubled, bicauſe the goddis can not be contēted. For a good perſon, for a lyttel faut, is greatly chaſtiſed, and he that is yl, for many fautes, is not puniſhed at al. So thus the goddis forbeare ſome, &amp; ſome haue no mercy. Thus it ſemeth, that the goddis wyl turment vs by the handes of ſuche men as greue vs extremely. So that if there were any iuſtyce in the worlde, whan they chaſtiſe vs with their handes, we ſhoulde not merite to haue our heedes on the ſhulders. Therfore I ſay to you, ye Romayns, and ſwere by the immortal goddis, that in .xv. days, that I haue ben in Rome, I haue ſeene ſuche dedes done in your ſenate, yt if the leeſt dede of them had ben done at Danubie, the galowes &amp; gibettes, had ben hanged thycker of theues, than

the vineyard with grapes and reyſons. And ſith yt my deſire hath ſene, that it deſireth, my harte is at reſte: in ſpredynge abrode the poyſon that was in it. If my tonge hath offended you in any thing, I am here redy, to make recō
               pence with my throte. For in good ſothe, I had rather to wynne honour, offerynge my ſelfe to the deathe, thanne ye ſhuld haue it, in takynge my lyfe fro me. Thus this vilain ended his purpoſe. Than the emperour ſayd: How thinke ye my frendes, what kernel of a nut? What golde of filth? what grayne of ſtrawe? what roſe of thornes? What marowe of bones, dyd he vncouer? what reaſon ſo hie? what wordes ſo wel ſette? what trouth ſo true, and what malice opened he ſoo? He diſcouered the duetie of a good manne. And I ſwere to you, as I may be deliuered from this euill feuer, that I haue, that I ſaw this vilayn ſtanding a hole houre on the erth boldly, &amp; we holdinge downe our hedes abaſhed, &amp; coude not anſwere him a word. The next day it was accorded in the ſenat, to ſend new iuges to Danubie. And we cōmanded the vilaine to delyuer vs in writing, al that he had ſayd, that it might be regeſtred in the boke of good ſayinges of ſtrangers. And the ſaide vilayne, for his wiſe wordes, was made patricien, &amp; ſo taried ſtyl at Rome, and for euer was ſuſteyned of the common treaſure.
         
         
            ¶Howe the emperour deſired the welth of his people, and the people his welthe. ca. xxxiii.
            
               IN the ſeconde yere that Mar. was choſen emperour, the .xlv. yere of his aege, as he retourned fro the warres, that he had in conqueryng the Germains and the Aragons, whereby he got glory &amp; riches for the Romaynes empire, he lay at Salon to reſte him, and to appointe his armye,

and to the entent, that the Romaynes ſhulde apparell his triumph in Rome right glorious and rychly: There was one thynge done, that was neuer ſene before in Rome. For the day of his triumph, by al the people and conſent of the ſenate, the prince Comodus, ſonne to Marcꝰ Au. was choſen after the dethe of his father to be emperour vniuerſall of thempire. He was not choſen by the petition of his father, for he was agaynſte hit with all his power, ſayinge, that the empire oughte not to be gyuen for the lawde of them that be deed, but he ſhoulde be choſen, for his owne good warkes. Often tymes this emperour wolde ſaye, Rome ſhall be loſte, whan the election ſhal be taken frome the Senate, and the Emperour to enheryte the empire by Patrimonie.
            ¶Nowe to returne where as we lefte. This emperour beynge at Salon, ſtudied ſore to entre into Rome in good order, and Rome ſtudied ſoore howe to receyue hym, as it appertained triumphantly for ſuche a warre. He was ſore deſyred of thempire: and euer he imagined, howe to do pleſure to the people, and the people were redy to dye in his ſeruice. Dyuers tymes was moued a pleaſant purpoſe in the ſenate, which of theſe thynges was moſte to be loued: The emperour to loue the people of the empire, or the people of thempire themperour. On a daye hit was determyned, to ſette iuges in that caſe: There were choſen the ambaſſadours of the Parthes and Roodes: and vppon that effecte they hadde writynge. It was layde for the emperour, the good dedes that he had done in his abſence, and the tokens of loue, that they hadde alwayes ſhewed in his preſence. And on an other day the emperour moued an other queſtion before the ſenate, ſaying, that it was a greatter glorie, to haue ſuch ſubiectes, than the glorie of the ſenate, to haue ſuche an emperour. Than the Senate ſayde

nay: Affirming that it is a greatter glorie that they had of hym, than he coude haue of them. And in this maner the emperour gaue the glorie to the people, and the people to the emperour. Thus in ſporte and play they toke iudges agayn. It was a merueylous thyng to ſe the ioy that they al had to proue their intentes. And the good emperour for a memorye gaue the laude to the people, bycauſe of theyr great obedience and ſeruice, and extreme loue that he had founde in them: And the happy people recounted the gret clemencie and mercy that was in the emperour, and his vertue and worthynes in gouernynge, his honeſtie of lyuynge, and his force and valiantnes in conqueringe. It was a great thing to ſe the honour that the people gaue to themperour, and the good renoume that themperour gaue to the people. The writinges were gyuen to the ſtraunge ambaſſadours, to thentent that the people myght lerne to obey theyr princes: and princes to loue theyr people. To the ende that by ſuch examples, as it was reaſon, the good people ſhuld enforce them ſelfes, and the yl to withdrawe. Thus this emperour adreſſed his entre with his capitaynes and captiues, and Rome apparayled theym with all their ſenatours and people to receyue hym. It was a huge thynge to ſe what people was at Rome to go forth to mete hym, and what people were with the emperour to entre. They that were at Salon hadde their eyes and alſo theyr hartes at Rome: and they that were at Rome hadde theyr hartes at Salon. In ſuche wyſe that theyr eies daſeled with that they ſawe, and their hartes aked for that they hoped to ſe. There is no greatter peyne, than whan the hart is deferred fro that it longeth ſore to haue.
         
         
            ¶Howe themperour gaue Lucilla his doughter lycence to ſport her at his palays. ca. xxxiiii.
            
               
               IT is to be knowen, that the Romaynes had a cuſtome, that in the monethe of Ianiuer, they ſhulde make triumphes to theyr emperours: and in the ſame ſeſon that the triumphes were apparailed, Fauſtin thempreſſe cauſed dyuers high perſones to pray the emperour to gyue lycence to a doughter of his, to com from there as ſhe was kept, to the palays, and ſporte her at the feaſtes. This mayden was named Lucie or Lucyll: She was higher than the prince Commodus her brother: ſhe was of a goodly geſture and wel proporcioned of her body, and wel be loued of her mother. And ſhe reſembled her not all onelye in her beautie, but alſo in her lyuynge. And thoughe the requeſt was pytifull, and they that made it familier, and he to whome it was made was the father, and the demaunder was the mother, and ſhe for whom it was made, was the doughter: the emperour graunted it, but not without great diſpleaſure. Neuertheles Fauſtine was full gladde, and as ſone as ſhe had obteyned lycence, ſhe broughte her doughter to the palays. And ſo whan the day of the great feaſte and triumph was comme, the damoyſell Lucylle beynge out of gouernance, and ſeinge her ſelfe at large, truſtinge thanne vppon her owne innocencye, toke noo hede of any ſtrange malyce, laughed with them that laughed, talked with them that talked, and behelde them that behelde her, and without care ſhe thought that none thought yl of her, bycauſe ſhe thought yll of none: yet in thoſe dayes a mayden to laugh among men was reputed as moche as a woman to haue done aduoutrie with the prieſtes of Grece, ſo great was the honeſtie of Romayn women eſtemed. And lightnes of maydens was a great infamie: for they were wors puniſhed for one open lyghtnes, than for two ſecrete fautes. Amonge all other ſeuen thynges the women dyd

obſerue ſurely, that is to wytte, not to ſpeke moche at feaſtes, not to eate moche at bankettes, to drynke no wyne in theyr helthe, nor to ſpeake alone with men, nor to lyfte vp their eies in the temples, nor to ſtande longe lokynge out at wyndowes, nor to go out of their houſes without their huſbandes. The woman taken with any of theſe dyſhoneſt thynges, was always after reputed infamed. Many thynges were ſuffred of perſons in ſmall reputation, that were not ſuffred in perſons of honour. For the noble women coude not cōſerue the reputatiō of their eſtate, but by reaſon of keping their perſon in great feare &amp; good order. Al thinges done vnkyndly is ſyn, &amp; may be amended: but the diſhoneſt woman is alway ſhamed. The noble ladies, if they wyl be taken as ladies, whā they excede other in riches, the leſſe lycēce ought they to haue to go wandring about. Certainly the plentie of goodes, &amp; the libertie of pſons, ſhuld not be a ſpur to pricke thē forward, but rather a brydell to kepe them in their cloſettes. And this is ſayd, for bycauſe that duryng the ſaid feaſtis, the damoyſel Lucille, as a yonge mayden, and Fauſtyne, her louynge mother not beinge olde, ſommetyme a foote, and ſometyme rydynge on horſebacke, ſommetyme openly, and ſommetyme meruaylous ſecretely, ſommetymes with company, and ſommetymes without companye, ſommetyme on the day, and nowe and than by nyghte, they wolde walke abrode in the ſtretes of Rome to ſe the feldes of Vulcan, in gardeynes Saturnynes, and drynke at the conduites of Neros water, and ſommetyme paſſe the tyme by the faire ryuer of Thiber, and in all ſuche other pleaſaunt ſportes as apperteyned to their age. And thoughe the fore ryped primetyme prouoked them therto, yet the grauitie of ſuche ladies ſhoulde not ſuffre it. I wylle ſaye one thynge, to thentent noble women ſhuld take aduertiſemēt therby,

and that is this: I knowe not whiche was the greatteſte diſſolution, eyther the walkynge abrode of Fauſtyne and Lucylle through the ſtretes and other places, or elles the boldnes of yll ſpeakers, ſpeakyng ageynſt their perſons and good names. The withdrawyng and kepinge of women clooſe is a brydell to the tongues of all men: and the woman that dothe otherwiſe, otherwiſe putteth her good name in daunger. Of trouthe it were better for a woman neuer to be borne, than to be defamed. Amonge the Romayns the lygnage of the Cornelies were had in great eſtimation. For of them all, neuer none was founde a cowarde, nor a woman defamed. The hyſtories ſhewe, that ones a lady of that lygnage beynge onelye defamed, was hanged on the galowes by the handes of her owne kynsfolke. Surely it was well doone of the Romaynes, to the entent that the wyckednes of one woman ſhuld not ſuffer yll fame to renne vppon the hole lygnage: where is there noblenes without ſhame? The thynges that to wche honour, ought not to be hyd but amended by Juſtice, and to put theym to deathe, that loſe their good fame. It is not ſufficient for a perſon to be good: but it is neceſſarye that he put fro hym all occaſions that are reputed to be yll. All the loſſes that a man may haue of any temporall goodis, can not countrepeyſe the leeſt loſſe of good fame. A man that layeth his good name for a farthynge at a but of this worlde, at a hundred ſhottes ſcantly ſhall he ſhoote one aryght. And contrary wiſe the man that feareth no ſhame, nor wyll not haue his perſonne in reputation, there is noo hope of goodnes in hym. Than this emperour, as a ſhipmaiſter, ſayling in moſte faire and calme wether, forecaſtethe, and is in greatte thoughte and feare of tempeſtes and ſtormes to comme, in the feaſtis of his greatte glory, was in doubte of theſe two ladies, leſte ſodenly any mysfame

ſhuld folowe. And certaynly he had great cauſe. For hit is an infallyble rule of enuious fortune, that this preſent felicitie is gyuen with a prycke of a ſodayne falle of myſchaunce. In thinges naturall, we ſe ſomtyme the ſee caulme, and yet forthewith foloweth a peryllous ſtorme, and conſequently the great heate of the daye is ſygne of thunder at nyght. I ſay fortune comynge with ſome preſent delyte or pleaſure, is a token that by flatterynge vs, ſhe hath made redy her ſnares to catche vs. Whan the miller is ſure, he dreſſeth his water gaate, and the labourer whan it reyneth not, couereth his howſe, thynkynge that an other tyme the wethers or raynes wyll falle theron and trouble hym: In lyke wyſe a wyſe and a vertuous man ought to thynke, as longe as he lyueth in this worlde, he holdeth his felicitie but at aduenture: and his aduerſitie for his naturall patrimony. Amonge all them that coulde reioyce in proſperitie, and helpe theym ſelfe in aduerſitie, this emperour Marcus Aurelius was one: whiche for any flatterynges that Fortune coulde ſhewe hym, he neuer truſted in them: nor for myſhappe that he had in this life, he neuer diſpayred.
         
         
            ¶What Marcus themperour ſayd to a Senatour as touchynge triumphes. Cap. xxxv.
            
               WHanne theſe feaſtes were paſſed, as Sertus Cheronenſe ſaith, a ſenatour named Aluinus ſayde to themperour, the ſame nyght that the triumphe ceaſſed: Syr reioyce you ſythe that this day ye haue gyuen ſo great ryches to the common treaſure of Rome: and I haue ſene your perſon in the triumph of glorie: and to the worlde to come of you and your houſe you haue lefte perpetuall memorye. The

emperour hering theſe wordis, ſaid in this maner: Frēdes it is good reſon we beleue, the hūter knoweth the fierſnes of veſtis, the phiſition the propretie of herbes, the mariner the perils of rockes, the capitaines the chances of warre, and the emperour that triumpheth, the ioyes that he hath of triumphes. As god helpe me, and as euer I haue part with my predeceſſours, and as euer I haue good fortune, the thoughtes that I haue had for theſe feſtes, haue bene farre greatter than the feares that I haue had in all the iourneyes and battayles afore. And the reaſon therof is very euydent to theym that haue clere vnderſtanding: For always in cruel battailes I was euer in hope to haue glorie, &amp; feared not the ouerthrow of fortune. What coude I loſe in battayle? Nothynge but the lyfe, that is the leeſt thyng that men haue, and alwayes in theſe triumphes I feare to loſe renowme, whiche is the greateſt gyfte that the goddis haue gyuen me. O howe happy is that man, that loſeth his lyfe, and leaueth behynde hym perpetuall memorie? Lette euery man vnderſtande this that wylle, and ſaye what they lyſte: that amonge noble and valyaunt barons, he dyeth not, that leeſeth his lyfe, and leaueth good renowme after hym: and moche leſſe tyme lyueth he that hath an yll name, thoughe he lyued many yeres. The ancyent philoſophers reckened not the lyfe of a man, though he lyued many yeres, but they reckened the good werkes that he hadde doone. The ſenate was importune vppon me, that I ſhulde take this triumphe, as ye knowe well: and I can not tell whiche was greatteſt, theyr deſyre or my reſiſtence. You knowe not the trouthe why I ſay thus. I dyd it not bycauſe of ambicion, and for couetouſnes of glorie, but it was bicauſe I fere ye humain malice. At the day of the triumph there was not ſo greate ioy ſhewed by the ſymple perſons, but the hyd enuy was

greatter among the greatteſt perſons. This glory paſſeth in one day, but enuy abydeth a hole yere. The plentifulle realme of Egipt, ſo happy in the blodſhed of their enmies, as in the waters of Nyle, hadde a lawe immouable. They neuer denyed theyr mercy to the captiues ouercome: nor they gaue no triumph to theyr capitaynes ouercomers. ¶The Caldees mocke at the Romayne triumphes, affirmyng how there is not gyuen ſo great chaſtiſement to the capitayne of Egipte ouercome, as the empire Romayne gyue to the ouercomer, whan tryumphe is gyuen to hym. And ſurely the reaſon is good, for the thoughtefull capytayne, whanne he hathe chaſed his ennemyes, that Rome hath in ſtraunge londes, with his owne propre ſpeare, in payement for his trauayle they gyue him ennemyes in his owne propre lande. I ſwere to you, that all the Romaine capitaynes haue not lefte ſo many enmyes deed by ſwerd, as they haue recouered ylle wyllars the daye of theyr tryumphes. Let vs leaue the Caldees, and ſpeake we of our auncient Romaynes, whiche if they myghte retorne nowe agayne in to the worlde, they wolde rather be tyed faſte to the chariottes as captiues, than to ſyt in them as vyctours. And the cauſe is, theyr neighbours ſeinge them goinge as captiues, wolde moue theyr hartes to ſet theym at liberte, ſo that the glorie of theyr tryumphes is a meane to cauſe them to be perſecuted and purſued. I haue redde in writyng, and herd of my predeceſſours, and haue ſeene of my neighbours, that the aboundaunce of felicitie hathe cauſed cruel enuie to be in many. O in what peril are they that with particuler honor wold be exalted among other? In the moſte higheſte trees the force of wyndes is mooſte aduaunced. And in moſt ſumptuous buildynges lyghteninge and thunder doothe mooſte hurte, and in greatte thycke and drye buſſhes the fyers kendle mooſte eaſelye:

I ſay that in them that fortune hath reyſed moſt hyghly, agaynſt them ſpredeth the greatteſt poyſon of enuye. All ſuche as be vertuous ſay: The mo ennemies they ſubdue to the common welthe: the moo enuious they recouer of their renoume. One ought to haue great compaſſion of a vertuous manne: bycauſe where he trauaileth to be good, there abydeth one thynge in hym, of the whiche all onely at the deth he ſeeth the ende. And that is, the more a man recouereth here renoume amonge ſtraungers, the more he is perſecuted with enuy amonge his owne nations. Homer ſhewethe in his Illiades, that Caluitio kynge of the Argiues was expert in clergie, valiant in armes, and indued with dyuers graces, beloued with his people, aboue al other he was a great louer of his goddis and worſhypper of them. This good kynge had a cuſtome, that in all thynges that he had to do, he wolde fyrſte aſke counſayle in the temples of the goddes: he wolde begynne no warre agaynſte other, nor ordeyne no newe lawe nor cuſtome in his realme: nor gyue aunſwere to the ambaſſadours, nor put no treſpaſours to death: nor ſet no tribute on his people: but firſt he wolde go to the temple, and make dyuers ſacrifices to knowe the wyll of the goddes. And bycauſe he went ſo often to the oracles, he was demaunded what anſwere the goddis made to hym in ſecrete, ſeinge he was ſo importunate. Then he anſwered and ſayde: I demand of the goddes, that they ſhulde not gyue me ſo lyttell, that euery man myght abate and ouercome me: Nor alſo that they ſhulde gyue me ſo moche, that euery manne ſhoulde hate me: but my deſyre is to haue a meane eſtate, wherewith euery manne myghte loue me. For I hadde leuer be felowe with many in loue, than to be kynge of all with hatred and enuy.
         
         
            
            ¶Of the great reproche that the emperour gaue to his wyfe Fauſtyne and her doughter. Capitu. xxxvi.
            
               AFter the feaſtes of the triumphe afore ſayde, this good emperour wyllynge to ſatyſfye his harte, and to aduertiſe Fauſtine his wyfe, and to teche his innocēt doughter, without knowledge of any other, he ſent for them and ſayde: I am not contēt Fauſtine, with that your doughter doth, and yet leſſe with that you do, which ar her mother. Theſe maidens, for to be good maydens, oughte well to knowe, howe to obey theyr mothers. And the mothers to be good mothers, ought to knowe how to bring vp their children. The father is excuſed in gyuynge counſaill, if the mother be vertuous, and the doughter ſhamefaſt. It is a greatte ſhame to the father, beinge a noble man, that his wyfe being a woman, ſhuld chaſtiſe his ſonne: And a great inconueniēce of the mother, beinge a mother, that her doughter ſhuld be chaſtiſed by the handes of her father. There was a lawe ordeyned by the Rodiens, that the father with the doughter, if ſhe hadde a mother, nor the mother with the ſonne, if he were a man, ſhuld not entermedle eche with other, but alonely men with men, and women with women, ought to be brought vp. And thextremitie of the lawe was ſuch, that amōge them that dwelled in one houſe, ſemed yt the fathers had no doughters, nor the mothers no ſonnes. O Rome, I wepe not to ſe thy ſtretes vnpaued, nor that there is ſo many gutters in thy houſes, nor that the batylmentes fall downe, nor the tymbre hewed downe, nor for the mynyſhynge of thine habitantes, for all this the tyme bringeth, and the tyme beareth away: but I wepe for the, and wepe for the agayne, to ſe the vnpeopled of good fathers,

and vnprouided in the nouriſhing of theyr ſonnes. Our countrey began to faille vtterly, whan the doctrine of ſonnes and doughters was enlarged, and theyr bridell lette go at libertie. For there is now ſuch boldneſſe in men children, and ſo lyttell ſhamefaſtnes in women chyldren, with the diſhoneſtie of the mothers, that where as one father ſuffiſed for .xx. ſonnes, &amp; one mother for .xxx. doughters, nowe .xx. fathers, ſcantly dare vndertake to brynge vp well one ſon, and .xxx. mothers, one doughter. I ſay to you thus Fauſtin, you remēbre not how you ar a mother, for you gyue more libertie to your doughter, than oughte to be ſuffred. And you Lucill remembre not, how you are a doughter: For you ſhewe to haue more lybertie, than requireth for a yonge mayden. The greatteſt gyfte that the goddis haue gyuen to the matrones of Rome is, bycauſe they are women, they kepe them ſelfe cloſe and ſecret: and bycauſe they be Romayns, they are ſhamefaſte. The day, whan the women want the feare of the goddis ſecretelye, and ſhame of menne openly, beleue me, eyther they ſhall faile the worlde, or the worlde them. The common welth requireth ſo greatte neceſſitie, that the women that dwell therin, ſhulde be as honeſt, as the capitaynes be valiant. For the capitaynes going to warre, defende them, and the women that abyde at home, conſerue them. As a. iiii. yeres paſſed ye ſawe the great peſtilence, and I demanded then to haue a compt of the people, and I founde, that of a. C.xl.M. women well lyuynge .lxxx.M. dyed: And of .x.M. yll womenne, in maner they ſcaped all. I can not telle for whiche I ſhulde wepe, eyther for the lacke, that we haue of the good and vertuous women in our common welthe, or elles for the greuous hurte and domage, that theſe yll and wycked women do to the youthe of Rome. The fyre that brenneth in mounte Ethna, dothe not ſo greatte domage

to them that dwelle in Scycille, as one ylle woman doth in the circuit of Rome. A fierſe beaſt and a perillous, ennemie to the comon welth, is an yl woman: for ſhe is of power to do moche harme, and is not apte to folowe any goodneſſe. O how many realmes and kynges rede we of, to be loſte by the yll gouernance of women, and to reſyſte agaynſte them hath ben nede of wyſedom, peryls, money, force, and worthynes of many men. The vices in a womā is as a grene rede, that boweth euery way: but the libertie and diſhoneſtie is as a drye kix, that breaketh: in ſuche wiſe that the more yll they vtter, the more vnlykely is the redres therof ageyn. Behold Fauſtin, there is no creature that more deſireth honour, and wors kepeth it, than a woman. And that this is true, ſe by Iuſtice, by orations, by writynge, and other trauayles, manne getteth renowme: but (without it be by flatterynge and fayre ſpeakyng) vnto this houre, by antyke writing, we can rede of fewe women or none, that eyther by writinge, redynge, workinge with nedell, ſpynnyng, or by weauyng, haue gotten them any great renoume. But as I ſaye of one, I ſaye of an other. Certaynly of dyuers we rede, by kepynge them cloſe in their houſes, well occupied in their beſyneſſes, temperate in theyr wordes, faythfull to their huſbandes, well ordered in their perſonnes, peaſible with their neyghbours, and finally beinge honeſte amonge theyr owne famylye, and ſhamefaſte amonge ſtraungers, ſuche haue attayned great renowme in theyr lyfe, and lefte eternal memorie of them after theyr death. I wol tel you an antike hiſtore, as profitable to reſtreyne our vices, as it dyd than augment vertues, and it is this: The realme of Lacedemoniens (as Plato ſheweth) was at a ſeaſon more diſſolute by the vnthriftines of women, than infamed by the crueltie of men: ſo that of al maner nations they were called Barbariens.

What tyme Grece as a mother, called philiſophie of philoſophers, Lygurge, a wiſe philoſopher in knowlege, and a right iuſte kynge to gouerne, partely with his doctrine righte profitable, and partely with his pure lyfe, made lawes in the ſayde realme, wherby he extirped all vices, and planted all vertues. I can not telle, whiche of theſe two were moſte happy, The kynge, hauynge ſo obedient people, or els the realme, to haue ſo rightfull a kynge. Amōge all other lawes, for women he made one greatly to be commended: He commanded, that the father that dyed, ſhuld gyue nothing to his doughter. And an other, that neyther lyuinge nor dienge, he ſhuld gyue any money to mary her with: to the entent that none ſhulde marye her for her ryches, but all onely for her goodnes: and not for her beautie, but for her vertues. And where as nowe, ſome be vnmaried, bycauſe they are poore, ſo then they abode vnmaried, bycauſe they were ſhamefulle and vicious. O tyme, worthy to be deſyred, whan maydens hoped nothynge to be maried with theyr fathers goodes, but by the vertuous werkes of theyr owne perſons. This was the tyme, called the golden worlde: whan neyther the doughter feared to be diſherited by the father in his lyfe, nor the father to dye ſorye for leauynge her without remedye at his deathe. O Rome, curſed be he that firſt brought golde into thy hous: and curſed be he, that firſte beganne to hurde vp treaſure. Who hath made Rome to be ſo ryche of treaſure, and ſoo pore of vertues? Who hath made menne wedde villaynes doughters, and leaue the doughters of ſenatours vnmaryed? What hath made, that the ryche mannes doughter is demanded vnwyllyng, and ye doughter of a pore mā none wyll deſyre? what hathe cauſed, that one mariethe a foole with fyue .C. marke, rather than a wyſe woman with .x.M. vertues? Than I ſaye, that in this poynte the fleſſhe

vanquyſheth the fleſhe, and er euer the vanytie of the malice therof is vanquiſhed. Howe cometh it, yt a couetous ꝑſon wyll ſoner nowe adays haue a wyfe, that is ryche and foule, than one that is poore and fayre? O vnhappy women that brynge forth chyldren, and more vnhappy be the doughters, that are borne, which to haue them maried, no ſtore is ſet by the blodde of theyr predeceſſours, nor the fauour of theyr frendes, nor the value of their warkes, nor the beautie of theyr perſones, nor the clennes of theyr lyfe. O curſed worlde, where the doughter of a good mā, without money, ſhall haue no mariage. But it was not wonte to be ſoo. For in the aunciente tyme, whan they treated of maryages, fyrſte they ſpake of the perſones, and after of the goodis: not as they doo at this houre, in this vnhappy tyme: for nowe they ſpeke firſte of goodes: and laſte of all, of the perſone. In the ſayde golden worlde, fryſte they ſpake of the vertues, yt the perſon was endowed with, and whan they were maryed, in ſportynge, they wolde ſpeake of the goodes. Whan Camillo triumphed vpon the Gaules or frenchemen, he had then but one ſonne, and he was ſuche one, that his perſon merited great lawdes. And for the renome of his father, dyuers kynges deſyred to haue him to theyr ſonne: and dyuers ſenatours deſyred to haue hym to theyr ſonne in lawe. This yonge manne, beinge of the age of .xxx. yeres, and the father at .lx. was importunatelye ſtyred by his naturalle frendes, and deſyred of ſtrange kynges, for to mary hym: but alway the olde Camyll repugned the counſell of his frendes, &amp; the importunitie of the ſtraungers. whan it was demaunded, why he determyned not vppon ſome maryage for his ſonne, ſythe therby ſhulde folowe the reſtefulle lyfe of the yonge man, and the quietnes of hym ſelfe in his aege, He aunſwered: I wyll not mary my ſonne, bycauſe ſomme offer me ryche

doughters, ſome noble of lygnage, ſome yonge, and ſome fayre: but there is none hath ſayde to me, I gyue you my vertuous doughter. Certaynly Camylle meryted to haue triumph, for that he dyd. And he deſerued eternall memorie, for that he ſaid. I ſay to you Fauſtine al theſe wordes, bycauſe I ſe you lede your doughter to the Theatres and playes, and do brynge her into the Capitoll. You put her to the kepynge of the ſwerde players, you ſuffre her to ſe the toumblers, and yet you doo not remembre, that ſhe is yonge, and you not aged: ye go into the ſtretes withoute lycence, and play by the ryuers. I fynd no vilany therin, nor thynke that your doughter is yl: but I ſay it, bycauſe you giue occaſion, that ſhe ſhoulde not be good. Beware Fauſtine, neuer truſte in the caſe of the fleſhe of yong people. Nor haue no confidence in olde folkes. For there is no better way, than to flee the occaſion of al thynges. For this entent the virgins veſtales are cloſed vp betwene the walles, to eſchewe the occaſions of open places, not to be more lyght and foolyſhe, but to be more ſadde and vertuous, fleing occaſions. The yonge ſhal not ſay, I am yong and vertuous, nor the olde ſhall not ſay, I am olde &amp; broken. For of neceſſite, the drye flaxe wyl brenne in the fyre: and the grene flagge ſmoke in the flamme. I ſaye, that a man beinge a diamonde enchaced amonge men, yet of neceſſitie he ought to be quicke and mery amonge women. And as waxe melteth in the heate, we can not denye, that thoughe the wodde be taken fro the fyre, and the ymbres quenched, yet neuer the les the ſtones oftentime remayne hote and brennyng. In lyke wiſe the fleſſhe, thoughe it be chaſtiſed with hote &amp; drie maladies, or conſumed by many yeres with trauayle, yet concupiſcence abideth ſtyll in the bones. What nede is it to blaſen the vertues, &amp; denye our naturalities? Certaynly there is not ſo croked a hors, but

if he ſe a mare, he wyll bray ones or twiſe. There is no mā ſo yonge nor old, but let hym ſe yong damoyſels, eyther he wyll giue a ſigh or a wiſhe. In al voluntary thinges I denie not, but that one may be vertuous: but in natural thinges, I confeſſe euery man to be weake. Whan ye take the wood fro the fire, it leueth brennyng: Whā ſomer cometh, the colde wynter ceſſethe: whan the ſee is caulme, the wawes leaue theyr vehemente mouynge: whan the ſonne is ſette, it beſhyneth not the worlde. I wyl ſay that than, and not before, the fleſhe wyl ceſſe to peyn vs, whan it is layde in the graue. Of the fleſhe we are borne, and in the fleſſhe we lyue, and in the fleſhe we ſhall dye. And therby it foloweth, that our good lyfe ſhall ſooner ende than our fleſhe. Oftentymes ſome holſome fleſhe for meate corrupteth in an vnholſome potte: and good wyne ſomtyme ſauoureth of the foiſte. I ſaye, though that the werkes of our lyfe be vertuous: yet ſhal we fele the ſtenche of the weake fleſhe, I ſay this Fauſtyne, ſith age can not reſiſt the hote enterpriſe, howe can the tender membres of youth reſiſt it? you being the mother, without you go the right way, ſhe being your doughter can not go the ſame way. The Romayne matrones, if they wil nouriſhe their doughters wel, ought to kepe theſe rules. Whan they ſe, that they wolde goo abrode, than breke theyr legges: and if they wold be gaſing, than put out their eies, and if they wyl harke, ſtoppe theyr eares: if they wyl giue or take, cut of their handes: if they dare ſpeke, ſowe vp theyr mouthes: and if they wil entend any lyghtnes, bury them quicke. wordes ought to be gyuen to an yll doughter: and in ſtede of preſentes and gyftis at her weddyng, gyue her wormes: and for her hous, a graue. Take hede Fauſtine, if you wyll haue great ioy of your doughter, take fro her the occaſiōs, wherby ſhe ſhall be ylle. To vnderſette a hous, behoueth dyuers proppes:

And yf the principalles be taken awaye, hit wylle falle downe. I wyll tell you, womenne are ſo fraylle, that with kepers with great peyne, they can kepe them ſelfe: and for a ſmall occaſion they wyll loſe all to gether. O howe mamy yll hath there ben, not bycauſe they wolde be ſo, but by cauſe they folowed ſuche occaſions, the which they ought to haue eſchewed? It is for me to entre into this battayle, but yet it is not in me to attayne the vyctorie. It is for me to entre into the ſee, yet it lyeth not in my handes to eſcape the perylle. It is in the handes of a woman to entree into the occaſion, and after that ſhe is therin, hit is not in her handes to delyuer her from faute.
         
         
            ¶Howe the emperour counſayled Fauſtine, to eſchue yll occaſions fro her doughter. cap. xxxvii.
            
               PAraduenture Fauſtine ye wyll ſaye to me, that none may ſpeke to your doughter Lucylle, but if you here hit: nor ſe her, but in your ſyghte, nor hyde her, but you knowe where: nor make none appoyntment, with out your knowledge. And atte this houre you knowe not, that they that do hate her, &amp; wold her yll, what diſhonour theyr tongues doo ſpeake of her. Newe loue in yonge bloudde in the ſpringinge tyme and flouryſhynge youthe, is a poyſon, that forthewith ſpredethe in to euery vayne: It is an herbe, that by and by entreth the entrayles: a ſwownyng, that incontinently mortifieth al the membres, &amp; a peſtilence, that ſleeth the hartes: and finally it maketh an ende of all vertues. I wote not what I ſaye yet, al though I knowe what I wyll ſay: For I wold neuer blaſen loue with my tonge, without I were ſore hurte in myn vnderſtandynge. Ouyde ſayth in his boke of the

arte of loue. Loue is I wote not what: that commeth I wote not whens: who ſent it I wote not: it engendreth I wote not how: it is contented I wote not wherwith: it is felte I wote not howe ofte, nor I wote not wherfore. And fynally loue taketh rote without breakynge of the fleſſhe outwarde, or percinge the entrayles inwarde. I wote not what Ouide meaneth hereby: but I trowe whan he ſaide theſe wordes, he was as farre banyſſhed from hym ſelfe, as I am at this tyme from my ſelfe. O Fauſtin, they that loue togither, ſhewe the ſignes of their hartes by dyuers wayes, and in ſlepyng they reaſon and ſpeake: and by ſygnes they vnderſtande eche other. The great voyce outewarde is ſygne of lyttell loue inwarde: and the great inwarde loue kepeth ſilence outwarde. The entrayles within imbraced in loue, cauſe the tonge outwarde to be muet. He that paſſeth his lyfe in loue, ought to haue his mouth cloſe. And to the entente that ye ſhall not thynke, that I ſpeake fables, I wyll proue this by auncient hyſtories. ¶We fynde aunciently, that in the yere .ii.C. and .lx. after the foundation of Rome, Eſtraſco a yonge Romayne that was dombe, and Veronne a fayre lady of the Latins, that was dombe alſo. Theſe two ſawe eche other on the mount Celyoit at a feeſt, and there fel in loue eche with other. And their hartes were as ſoore fixed in loue, as theyr tonges were tyed for wordes. It was a meruaylous thing to ſe them, and feareful to note here. The yong lady came fro Salon to Rome: and he went fro Rome to Salon, by the ſpace of .xxx. yeres togither without the wityng of any perſone, nor they two ſpake not. Than at the laſte died the huſbande of the lady Veronne, and the wyſe of Eſtraſco, and than they diſcouerd their loue, and treated a mariage betwene them, of whome deſcended the noble lygnage of our Scipions: whiche were more lyberalle in the feates

of armes, than theyr father and mother were in their tonges. Than Fauſtine marke this thynge: Lyttell aduantage it had ben to haue cut out the tonges of the two dōbe folkes, to haue remedied their loue, and not to haue cutte out theyr hartes.
            ¶Alſo I ſhall tell you of Maſſiniſſa a worthy knyght of Numedie, and Sophariſe a famous ladye of Carthage, al onely by one ſight, as they ſawe eche other on a ladder, he declared his deſire vnto her: and ſhe knowyng his luſt, breakynge the oores of feare, and lyftynge vp the ankers of ſhame, incontinent raiſed the ſailes of theyr hartes, and with the ſhippes of their ꝑſons, they ioyned eche to other. Here may we gather, how the firſt ſight of their eies, and knowlege of their perſons, and the leage of their hartes, and the mariage of their bodies, &amp; the pardition of theyr eſtates, and the infamie of their name, in one day, in one houre, in one moment, and in one ſteppe of a ladder were agreed. What wyll ye that I ſaye more to this pourpoſe? Do ye not knowe that Helayne the Greke, and Parys the Troyan, of two ſtrange nations and of farre countreys, with one only ſight in a temple, their wylles were ſo knyt togither, that he toke her as his captiue, and ſhe aboode his priſoner. In Parys appered but ſmal force, and in her but lyttel reſiſtence. So that in maner theſe two yonge ꝑſons, the one procuring to vanquiſhe, and the other ſufferinge to be vanquiſſhed, Parys was cauſe of his fathers deathe: and Helayne of the infamie of her huſbande, and they bothe of their owne deathes, loſſe to theyr realmes, and ſclaunder to all the worlde. All this loue cauſed one onely ſyght.

            ¶Alſo Cleopatra in the prouince of Bithinye, in the wod Sehyn, made a goodly banket or ſolempne feaſt to Marcus Anthonius her louer. And thoughe ſhe was not very honeſt, yet had ſhe with her right chaſte women: and thus the banket enduryng a great parte of the nyghte, and the wod beinge thicke, the yonge damſels were not ſo wily to hyde them, but the yonge men Romayns founde them: ſo that of .lx. doughters of ſenatours .lv. were gotten with chyld among the thycke buſhes: which thyng made a gret ſclandre in the people, and augmented the infamy of Cleopatre, and miniſhed the honeſtie of Marc Anthony. ¶Thus as I haue ſhewed of a ſmal nombre, I coude ſay of many other. Al men are not men, nor all women be not women. I ſay it bycauſe I wolde it ſhulde be ſayde: let it touche them that it toucheth, and let them that can, vnderſtand me. There is ſome ſhyppes, that are ſo lyghte, that they wyll ſayle with a lytell wynde, and there be ſome milles that wyll grinde with a lyttell water. I ſaye there be ſome women ſo brittel, that as a glaſſe with a fyllop wyll breke, and wyl ſlyp with a lytel myre. Shewe me Fauſtin,

haue you ſuffered your doughter to ſpeke but with her vncles, and kept company but with her coſins? I ſay in this caſe as moche wileneſſe hath the mother as the doughter to renne in peryll. Do you not knowe, that the quicke fire doth not forbere the wod be it wete or dry, but in lykewyſe it conſumeth the harde ſtones? Doo you not knowe, that the hongre exceſſiue cauſeth beaſtes to deuour with theyr tethe the thynge that was bredde in their entrayles? Doo you not knowe, that the goddes made a lawe ouer al thinges, except on louers, bycauſe they may not abyde it? And doubtleſſe it is ryghtwyſely done, that Rome condemneth not theſe folyſhe innocentes, bycauſe they haue none vnderſtandyng. The goddes gyue no peyn to amorous people, bycauſe they are depriued fro reaſon. Ye knowe whan I was cenſure, there was a yong woman that had a child by her owne father, and an other that had a chylde by her ſonne, and a nieſe by her propre vncle: and there was ſentence gyuen on them, that the fathers ſhulde be caſt to the lyons, and the chyldren buryed quycke, and the mothers were brente in the campe of Mars. The mattier was ſoo horrible to here, that I myght not endure to ſe the curſed men. And I commanded by my decrees, that none ſhulde be ſo bolde to ſpeake in ſuche a caſe any more. And if this caſe were fearefull to men, than certaynely the Romayne matrones oughte to lyue chaſtely. Than if the fyre of the father doo chaufe the doughter, enflameth kynſfolke, and bourne theym ſelfe: ye maye be ſicre, if he fynde after eyther couſyn or fayre ſiſter, the flames of his concupiſcence wyll not leaue to take holde on her for any parentage. If this riotous fleſhe wyll obey reaſon, than it maye be, that your doughter may ſpeake liberally with her couſins: but ſith that paſſion repugneth ſo moche at reaſon, I councel you truſt not to moche in her bretherne. you ſee by experience:

that the worme that is bredde in the thymbre, eateth the ſame tymbre: and the moothes that are bredde in the clothe, eateth the ſame clothe. I ſaye that ſommetyme a man bringeth vp in his houſe ſome perſone, that after taketh his life fro hym. Fauſtine take this that I haue ſayd for a warnyng, and theſe laſt wordes I gyue you for councell, If you wyll kepe your ſelfe from thoughte, and your doughter fro peryll, alway let your doughter be occupied with ſome good werkes. Whan the handes are occupyed with any good exerciſe, than the harte is voyde fro many ydell and vayn thoughtes. Euery lightnes done in youth breaketh downe a loope of the defence of our lyfe: but ydelneſſe, wherby our enuye entreth, is it, whiche openeth the gate to al vyces. Fauſtine wyl you wite: I ſe dayly the parditon of the yong Romayne doughters. For as ſone as they be borne, they preſume to be amorous: they as vnthoughtfull, with the recheleſnes of the father, and wantonnes of the mother, leaue the iuſt trauayle, and take vniuſt idelnes. Of ydell motion and outragious thoughtes the eies take licēce without leaue, the mynde altereth, and the wyll is hurte: and finally thynkynge to be the whyte, that amorous men ſhote at, they remayne as a butte ful of al vices. And in concluſion there is nothinge that more rechaceth the balle of the thought (in this playe) thanne the hand ſette a worke therwith.
         
         
            ¶What thought Marcus the emperour toke for the mariage of his doughters. ca. xxxviii.
            
               THan the good emperour Marc hauynge a clere vnderſtandyng, and a quiete wytte, toke righte great hede of thynges that were paſte, prudently wayinge thinges preſent, &amp; thinges to come.

Seinge that the pardition of princis, lay al in wyl, totally gyuinge them ſelfe eyther to ſtrange thinges, forgettynge their owne, or els to entend to their owne, nothing regardinge ſtrange thynges. His hart was ſo agreable to hym, that neyther the hyghe buſineſſes of them: nor for all the affaires of his houſe, he wolde not leaue one of thempire vnſped. I ſaye this, bycauſe this emperour Marcus had foure doughters, whoſe names were Lucylle, Porſena, Matrina, and Domitia. All reſembled their mother in excellent beautie, but they reſembled not theyr father in honeſtie and vertuouſnes. And thoughe they were in gouernance vnder their mayſtreſſes out of his preſence, yet he had them always in memorie: and the elder they were, the more ſtudy and thought he toke for them: and whan they cam to cōplete age, he ſtudied to fynd prouiſion for them. It was a laudable cuſtome, that the doughters of the officers of the Senate, ſhulde not marye withoute lycence, nor the emperours doughter without the aduyſemente of the ſenate. Than it was ſo, that one of the ſayd princeſſes his doughters, beynge of aege, and of wyll to be maryed, her father ſeinge her importunitie, to accomplyſhe her deſire, bycauſe he was ſycke, he ſente for Fauſtyne, that ſhe ſhulde goo and commune in the ſenate. The whiche with all her power ſhe withſtode, bycauſe that ſecretely ſhe had treated for an other mariage for her doughter. And openly ſhe excuſed her ſelfe, ſayinge, that her doughter was to yonge and tender of aege: and as the goddis had gyuen age ſufficiēt to the father, ſo had not the doughter of yeres Whan the emperour vnderſtode this, he called Fauſtyne to his bedde ſyde, where as he lay, and ſayd: Dyuers thinges are diſſimuled in particuler perſons, the leaſt of them is not to be ſuffred in thē that ſhuld enſigne all other. The prince is neuer well obeyed, but if he haue good credence

among his people. I ſay this Fauſtin, bicauſe you do one thinge in ſecrete, and ſay an other openly. Here in fayleth the credence of ſo high a lady, and putteth inconuenience in the auctoritie of ſo great an empire. If ye ſuppoſe my good deſires be ſiniſter in your hart for the welth of your owne chyldren: howe ſhulde we hope than in any of your good workes for the children of ſtraungers? It ſemeth to you better, to gyue your doughter to them that demād hir of the mother, and refuſe them that the father doth chuſe. Certainly bicauſe ye be a womā, you deſerue pardon: but in that you are a mother, you augment your faut. Do you not knowe, that mariages are guyded ſomme by fortune, and ſome by vertues and wyſedome? Suche as demande the doughters of the fathers, beleue me, their eyes benne moore vppon their owne propre vtilitie, than vppon the welth of an other. I knowe welle, you brynge forthe the chyldern, but the goddis wyll mary them, ſithe they haue endewed them with ſo meruaylous beautie. Doo you not knowe, that the beautie of women ſetteth ſtraungers on deſire, and putteth neyghbours in ſuſpection, to great mē it gyueth force, to meane men enuye, to the parentes infamie, and peryll to the perſon ſelfe? With great peyne it is kepte that is deſired of many. Of trouthe I ſay the beautie of women is nothynge but a ſygne for ydell folke: and an erly wakynge for them that be lyghte: where as of the ſtrange deſyres lieth the renome of them ſelf. And I deny not, but that a light perſon ſercheth ſoner a woman with a faire face than one of honeſt lyuyng. But I ſay, that a woman, that is maried only for her beautie, may hope in her age to haue a ſorye lyfe. It is an infallible reule, that ſhe that was maried for her faireneſſe, is hated for her fowlenes. O what trauayle he offreth him ſelfe vnto, that marieth a faire woman? It behoueth hym to ſuffre her pryde,

for beautie and foly alway go togyther. Alſo he muſt ſuffre her expences. For folye in the heed, and beautie in the face bene two wormes, that frete the lyfe, and waſteth the goodes. Alſo he muſt ſuffre her ryottes, for a faire womā wyll that none but ſhe haue her commandementes in the houſe: Alſo he muſt ſuffre her nyce mynionneſſe, for euery fayre woman wyll paſſe her lyfe in pleaſure: Alſo he muſt ſuffre her preſumption, for euery fayre woman wyll haue preeminence before al other. Finally he that marieth with a faire woman, aparaileth him to a right great aduēture: and I ſhall tell you wherfore. Surely Carthage was neuer ſo enuyronned with Scipions, as the howſe of a faire woman is with lyght perſones. O vnhappye huſbande, whan his ſpirite is at reſt, and the body ſleping, than theſe lyght perſons wyl come about his houſe, drieng his body with ielouſy, caſting their eies to the wyndowes, ſcalynge the walles with ladders, or clyminge ouer, ſingyng ſwete ſonges, playeng on diuers inſtrumētes, watchinge at the gates, treting with baudes, vncoueryng the houſe, &amp; waitynge at euery corner therof. Al theſe thinges, in caſe they ſhote at the pricke of the womans beautie, they leue not to ſhote at the butte of the ſorowfull huſbandes good name. And whether this be true or not, report me to my ſelf, that maried me with your beautie: and let them wite of my renoume that go ſo about the citie. I ſay moche, but truely I fele more. No man complayneth of the goddis for gyuynge hym a fowle wyfe, amonge his deſtenies. Whyte ſyluer is not wroughte but in blacke pytche: and the tender tree is not conſerued but by the harde rynde. I ſay the man that marieth a fowle wyfe, ledeth a ſure life, lette euery man chuſe as he lyſteth: and I ſay a man that marieth a faire wife, caſteth his good fame at haſarde, and putteth his lyfe in peryl. Al the infamy of our predeceſſours ſtode

in none exercyſinge of dedes of armes: and nowe all the paſtime of the Romayne youth is to ſerue ladies. Whan a woman is famed to be faire, than euery man gothe thyther, and taketh great peyne to ſerue her, and the women woll be ſene. I ſay Fauſtine, you neuer ſawe a yonge damoyſel Romayne, greatly renoumed in beautie, but either in dede or in ſuſpection there folowed ſom yl name of her. In that lyttell that I haue redde, I haue harde of dyuers fayre women, bothe of grece, Italy, Parthe, and Rome: and they be not put in remembraunce, bycauſe they were fayre, but for the greatte perylles and heuy chaunces that by their beauties felle in the worlde. For in maner by reaſon of their excellente beauties they were vyſited in theyr owne landes: and by their infamye ſhamed throughe all the worlde.
            ¶Whan the realme of Carthage was flouryſſhynge in ryches and happy in armes, they ruled the common welth by wyſe philoſophers, and ſuſteyned it by diſcrete armies on the ſee. Arminius the philoſopher was as greatly eſtemed amonge them, as Homer amonge the grekes, or Cicero amonge the Romaynes: he lyued in this worlde ſyxe ſcore yeres and .ii. Of the whiche happy age .lxxx. yeres he ruled quietly as a baron moſt peaſible of mynd: and was as ſtraunge to women, as familiar with his bokes. Than the ſenate ſeinge he was ſo broken with the cōmon welthe, and withdrawen from all naturalle recreations, they deſired hym with greate inſtaunce to be maried, bycauſe that memory myght be had of ſo perfytte a wyſe man in tyme to come: and the more importunate they were the more he reſiſted, and ſayd, I wyll not be maried: for if ſhe be foule, I ſhall abhorre her: if ſhe be ryche, I muſte ſuffre her: if ſhe be poore, I muſt maynteyn her: if ſhe be faire, I muſt take hede to her: if ſhe be a ſhrewe, I canne not ſuffre her:

and the leaſte peſtylence of all theſe, is ſuffycient to flee a M. men. With ſuche wordes this wyſe man excuſed hym ſelfe: and he in his aege, by reaſon of his great ſtudy, loſt his ſight. And the ſolytarines of his ſwete lyberties conſtrayned hym to take company of a womā, and ſhe had by him a doughter, of whom deſcended the noble Amilcares of Carthage, cōpetitours of the Scipions of Rome, the which ſhewed no leſſe worthyneſſe in defēce of Carthage, than ours were fortunate to augment Rome. ¶Tell me Fauſtine, may not ſuche ſuſpection fall vppon your doughters, though their vertue ſuccour in the peryl, and their honeſtie aſſure their perſons? I will diſcouer a ſecrete thynge to you. There is nothynge, that can be ſoo quyckely commytted, yf a womanne be enuyronned with chaſt kepers and feminine ſhamefaſtnes. Stedfaſtly they deſire, and with great leyſure they procure theſe thynges, that lyghtly may be atteyned. There is nothynge ſoo certayne, but that the welth of an other is matter for the own euyll. And Fauſtine ye knowe, that the mooſt honeſt womenne, by our malyce are moſt deſyred. Certaynely theyr ſhamefaſtnes and kepynge cloſe, ben arowes in defence of our honeſtie. We rede not that bludde, ryches, nor beautie of the vnhappy matrone Lucrece was the cauſe, that ſhe was deſired: But the clerenes of her viſage, the grauitie of her perſon, the pureneſſe of her lyfe, the kepyng of hyr ſelfe cloſe in her howſe, the exercytie of her tyme, the credence amonge her neyghbours, and the great renoume that ſhe hadde amonge ſtraungers, waked the foolyſhe Tarquine to commytte with her aduoultrye by force. What thynke you? Wherof came this? I ſhall ſhewe you. We that be yll, are ſo yll, that as yll we vſe the goodnes of them that be good. This is no faute to the ladyes of Rome, but rather in the immortall goddis. Their cleane honeſtie accuſeth

our cruell malice. Fauſtine, you ſay, your doughter is to yonge to be maried. Do you not knowe, that the good father ought to endoctrine his ſonnes fro their yong age? and to prouide for his doughters whiles they be yonge. Of a trouthe, yf the fathers be fathers, and the mothers mothers, as ſone as the goddis haue giuen them a doughter, forthwith they ought to fyxe in their hartes a newe remembraunce: and not forgette it, tyll they haue prouided their doughter an huſband. The fathers ought not to tary for ryches, nor the moder for hygh lygnage, the better to marie them: So what with the one &amp; the other, the tyme paſſeth, and the doughters waxe aeged: and than after this maner they be to olde to be maryed: and to abyde alone, they be maydens: and to ſerue, they be women, they lyue in peyne, the fathers in thought, the parentes in ſuſpection, leaſt they ſhuld be loſt. O what great ladies haue I knowen, doughters of great ſenatours, and not for faut of ryches, nor of vertues in their perſons, but all only for ſlacke of tyme, and driuinge of one houre to an other, ſoo that at laſte ſodeyn dethe came to the fathers, and no prouidence made for the doughters: So that in maner ſome were couered vnder the erthe after their deathe, and ſome buried with forgetfulnes. Eyther I lye, or I haue redde in the lawe of the Rodiens, where as it is written, We cō
               maunde the father in marienge .x. ſonnes, to trauayle but one day: but to mary oone vertuous doughter, lette hym trauayle .x. yeres, ye &amp; ſuffre the water come to the mouth, ſweate droppes of bloode, trauayle the ſtomake, diſherite all his ſonnes, loſe his goodis, and aduenture his perſon. Theſe wordes in this law were pitieful for the doughters, &amp; not leſſe greuous to the ſonnes. For .x. ſonnes by ye lawe of men ar bound to diſcouer, &amp; to go ouer al the world: but ye doughter, by ye good law ought not to go out of ye hous.

I ſay more ouer, that as thinges vnſtable threte fallyng, ſo lyke wiſe it chaunſeth to yonge damſelles, whiche thinketh all theyr tyme loſte and ſuperfluous vnto the daye of their mariage. Homere ſayth, it was the cuſtome of ladies of Grece, to count the yeres of theyr lyfe, not fro the tyme of their byrth, but from the tyme of theyr maryage. As if one demaunded of a Grecian her age, ſhe wolde aunſwere xx. yeres, if it were .xx. yeres ſith ſhe was maried: though it were .lx. yeres ſith ſhe was borne: Affirminge after they hadde a houſe to gouerne and to commande, that daye ſhe begynneth to lyue. The Melon after it is rype, and abydeth ſtyll in the gardeyn, can nat ſcape, but eyther rotteth, or elles muſt be gathered. I ſay the mayden that taryethe longe, tyll ſhe be maried, can not eſcape, eyther to be taken or infamed. I will ſaye no more. As ſoone as the grapes be ripe, it behouethe that they be gathered: ſo it is neceſſary, that the woman that is come to perfite age, be maried and kept. And the father, that doth this, caſteth perill out of his houſe, and bringeth him ſelfe out of thoughte, and contenteth well his doughter.
         
         
            ¶Of a ſyckenes, wherof themperour died, of his age, and where he dyed. cap. xxxix.
            
               MArcus the Emperour beinge olde, not onely by age, but by trauaile and great peines that he had taken and ſuffred in warres: In the xviii. yere of his empire, and .lxii. yere of his age, and of the foundation of Rome .vi.C. and .xl. as he was in Panony, now called Hungarie, with his hoſte, and Commode his ſonne, at a citie called Vendebone, ſituate vpon a ryuer, that had .iiii.M. fire houſis, and beinge in wynter, and the waters great, &amp; very weate

wether, he beinge in the fieldes about the .xxx. day of December: ſodainly vpon a nyghte as he wente with lanternes about his campe, there toke hym a ſyckenes or palſey in one of his armes, ſo that he coude not weld his ſpeare, nor yet drawe his ſwerde, nor put on his owne clothes. Than this good emperour charged with yeres, and with noo leſſe thoughtes, and wynter increaſynge with manye great ſnowes, and freſynge of the erthe, there felle on him an other malady called Lytarge, the whiche put the Barbariens in great hardines, and his hoſte in greatte heuynes, his perſon in peryll, and his frendes in great ſuſpect of his helthe. There was done to hym all the experience that coude be founde by medicins, as vnto great pryncis and lordes is accuſtomed. And all dyd him no profite: by reaſon the maladye was greuous, and themperour charged with yeres, and the ayre of the lande was contrarye to hym, and the tyme helped hym nothynge: and alſo he was not well intended. And as men of worſhyppe do ſette more by theyr honour than by theyr lyues, and had rather dye with honour, thanne lyue diſhonoured, to aſſure their honour, they aduenture euery houre their lyues, and had leauer haue one houre of honour, than a. C. yeres of lyfe: So thus this ſicke emperour, cauſed him ſelfe to be borne all about his campe, and went to ſee the ſcarmyſhes, and wold ſlepe in the feldes: the which was not without great peryll of his lyfe, nor without great trauaylle of his perſon. Thus on a day the emperour, beinge in a great feuer and letten bloudde, harde a great clamour or noyſe in the fielde: made by his men that had brought home great quā
               titie of forage, and theyr ennemies ſette on theym, to reſcue it: there was medlynge on bothe parties, the one to beare away, and the other to defende: The Romaynes for hungre, dyd what they coulde, to beare it a waye: And the

Hungaryens fro whenſe it came, made reſyſtence: They medled ſo one with an other, and their debate was ſoo cruell, that there was ſlayne .v. capitaynes of the Romayns, the worſt of them was more worthe, than all the fourage that they had won. And of the Hungariens were ſo many ſlayne, that all the fourrage that they had loſte, was not ſo moche worth. Certainly conſidering the crueltie that was there done, the profyte that came therby, was very ſmalle to the Romayns, ſo that there went but a fewe away with the fourage, &amp; of the Hungariens fewer was lefte to make reſiſtence. The emperour ſeinge the yll order, and that by the reaſon of his bloudde lettynge and feuer, he was not preſent at that acte, he toke ſuche a heuynes at his harte, wherby he fell into ſuche a traunce, that it was thought he had ben deade: and ſo he lay .iii. nyghtes and two dayes, that he coude ſe no lyght of the ſkye, nor ſpeake to any perſone. The heate of his ſyckenes was greatte, and his peynes greatter, he dranke moche and eate lyttelle, he cowlde not ſlepe, his face was yelowe, and his mouthe blacke. Somtyme he lyfted vp his eies, &amp; oftentymes ioyned his handes togyther: He ſpake nothynge, and ſyghed many tymes. His throte was ſoo drie, that he coulde not ſpytte: his eies were verye ſoore with ſobbynge and wepynge. It was greatte compaſſion to ſee his deathe, and a greate plage of confuſion to his howſe, and alſo the very greate loſſe of his warre. There durſte no manne looke vppon hym, and fewer ſpeake to hym. Panutius his Secretarye, ſorowynge at his harte, to ſee his mayſter ſo nere his dethe, on a nyght in the preſence of dyuers other that were there, he ſayd to hym.
         
         
            ¶The wordes of Panutius his ſecretary to themperour at the houre of his deathe. Cap. xl.
            
               
               O Marcus mi lorde, there is no tongue that can be ſtyll, nor any hart ſuffre, nor eies diſſimule, nor wytte that can permytte it. My bloudde congeleth, and my ſinewes dry, the ſtones openethe, and my ſowle wolde paſſe forthe: the ioyntes vnioyne aſonder, and mi ſpirites are troubled, bicauſe you take not the wyſe and ſage counſell, the whiche ye gaue to other that were ſymple. I ſee you my lord dye, and I oughte for to be ſoore diſpleaſed therwith. The ſorowe that I fele at my hart is, how you haue lyued lyke a wyſe perſone, and at this howre you do lyke a ſimple man. Tenne yere a knight gyueth meate to his hors, to thentēt that he ſhulde kepe him from peryll: and all that the wyſe man ſtudyeth for a longe ſeaſon, oughte to be to paſſe his lyfe with honour, and to take his deth with great vertue. Ryght dere lorde, I demande of you, what prouffyte is it to the maryner to knowe the carde of the ſee, and after to peryſhe in a tourment or tempeſte? What prouffytte is it to a capitayne, to ſpeake moche of warre, and after knowe not howe to gyue battayle? What profyteth it to a knyght, to haue a good horſe, and to falle in the ſtrete? What profyteth it one to teache an other the playne waye, and hym ſelfe to wander aſyde? I ſaye, what profyted it the force of your lyfe, that you eſtemed ſoo lyttelle, manye tymes ſeekynge your deathe? And at this preſent howre, that you haue founde deathe, you wepe, bycauſe it wyll take away your lyfe? What thynges haue I written with myn owne hande, beinge your Secretarye, dyuyſed by your hyghe and profounde vnderſtandynge, towchynge the ſtroke of deathe? What thynge was it to ſe the letter, that you ſent Claudine vpon the deathe of her huſbande? what wrote you to Anthygone, whan your ſonne Veriſſimus dyed? Wherin your vertue dydde conſolate his heuyneſſe. What

highe thinges dyd I write in the boke that you ſent to the Senate, in the yere of the great peſtylence: comfortynge them after the great mortalitie paſſed: therein you dydde ſhewe theym, howe lyttell men ſhulde ſette by deth, &amp; what profyte foloweth therby. And I haue ſeene and harde you blaſon dethe in your lyfe, and nowe you wepe, as thoughe you ſhulde lyue here ſtyll. Syth that the goddis cōmande it, and your age requireth it, &amp; your ſyckenes is the cauſe, and nature permytteth it, and fortune conſenteth to it, and is the fatall deſtenie of vs all, than you muſte nedes dye. The trauayles that come of neceſſitie, ought with a good courage to be abyden. For the couragious feeleth not ſoo ſore the harde ſtrokes, as the weake that falleth, or he be foughten with. You are but one man, and nat two: and ye ought to haue oone deathe and nat two. Therfore why wolde ye for one lyfe haue two dethes, enterrynge the body, and ſleinge the ſpirite with ſyghes? After ſo many perylles of longe lyfe to take a ſure porte, wyll ye lyfte vp the ſayles, and entre ageyne into the ſwolowe of the ſee, for to engloutte you? In the ſee you haue chaſed the bulle, and ſcaped his woodnes, and nowe ye refuſe to entre into the parke, where you may ſurely ſlee hym. You make aſſaute with vyctorie of your life, and wyl dye atteynyng the deth. you haue foughte .lxii. yeres in the campe of myſerie, and nowe you feare to entre into your ſepulchre: you haue got out of the buſſhes and thornes, wherin you were cloſed: and nowe at this howre you ſtomble in the faire way: you haue had in certayne the domage of your death: and now ye put in double the profyte of your death: you ar entred into the campe of defyenge of the worlde: and nowe you wolde tourne your backe, whan it is tyme to putte your handes to armes .Lxii. yere you haue foughte agaynſte fortune: and nowe you clooſe your eies, bycauſe fortune

wyl ſtrike you. I ſay it, bycauſe that willyngly you refuſe this preſent dethe, the whiche wyll cauſe vs, to haue your lyfe paſſed ſuſpect. What do you, high and mighty prince? Why wepe you like a chyld? &amp; why ſigh you, as one in dyſpaire? if you wepe, bicauſe ye ſhal die, why dyd you laugh ſo moche in your lyfetyme? For of moche laughynge in the lyfe tyme, cometh moche wepyng at the deth. Wyl you do that you can not do? and not be content with that you may do. The grounde and paſture, that is common, you wolde ioyne to your owne, the renowme of the common welthe you applyed to your owne heritage. Of a ſubſidy or lone, you wolde make your perpetuall ryghte. I wylle ſhewe you who be deed. All be deed and ſhall dye. And amonge all other you wolde all onely lyue. Wyll ye haue that of the goddis, that they be goddis for? That is, bycauſe you are mortall, that they make you immortall. And you to haue that by priuilege, which they haue by nature? I that am but ſymple, demaunde one thynge of you my lorde, that are auncient and wyſe: whiche is the greatteſt or leaſt welthe, to dye well or lyue yll? To lyue welle noo man can attayne certainely, for hungre, thirſt, ſolitarines, perſecution, yll fortune, ſickneſſes, and diſfauours. This can be called no lyfe, but rather a deth. If an ancient man wolde make a ſhewe and booſte of his lyfe, from the tyme of his birthe, to the layinge in his graue, and the bodye to ſhewe all that it hath ſuffred by dolours, and the harte to diſcouer all the ſtrokes of fortune: I thynke, that the goddis wolde haue maruayle therof, and men wolde be abaſhed therof, that the body coude ſuffre ſoo moche, and the harte beare it. I holde the grekes wiſeſt, whiche wepe, whan theyr children are borne, and they ſynge, whan an olde man dyeth: but the Romaynes ſynge at the byrthe of theyr chyldren, and wepe whan they dye olde. Certaynly

to laughe at the deth of them, that die olde, ſith they dye to laugh: and to wepe at the birth of chyldren, ſithe they are borne to wepe, and that the lyfe abydeth the ſentence of yl, proueth well, that the deathe is good. Wyll you, that I ſaye one veritie to you? I haue alwayes ſeene, that coū
               ſell in the wyſeſt man, ſoneſt faileth him. Such as wolde gouerne al thinges, by theyr opiniōs, of neceſſitie in ſome, or in the moſte parte, they do erre and fayle. O Marc my dere lorde, weene you, that haue cauſed to burye ſoo many, that ſome ſhulde not burye you in lykewiſe? As you haue ſeene the ende of theyr dayes, ſo other ſhal ſe the ende of your yeres. Therfore me ſemeth, it were better for you to dye, and to go your waye, to atteyne ſoo moche welthe, than to ſcape, and to lyue in ſo moche myſery. If you fele deathe, I haue no meruayle, ſythe you be a man. But I meruayle, that you do not diſſimule it, ſythe you are dyſcrete. They that haue clere vnderſtandynge, feele many thynges at theyr harte, that putteth them to peyne, which they ſhewe not outwarde, for the preſumption of honour. If al the poyſon, that is in a heuy hart, were ſpred abrode in the weake fleſſhe by ſmalle greynes, noo walles ſhulde ſuffyſe vs to rubbe, nor our nayles to ſcratche. For certainly the deathe is but a playe, wherin the player, if he be apt, aduentureth but lyttell, to wynne moche: and they that play, may ſe wel, that this is a wyly play, and not a ſtrōg. And that alſo, as well they leſe, that haue but a ſmal card, not fearyng dethe, as they, that with a greatte carde, loue long lyfe? What thinge is deth, but a trappe dore, wherin the tent is cloſed, in the whiche is ſolde, all the miſeries of our life? This the goddis do change vs, fro an olde filthy houſe, into a newe. And what other thing is the ſepulchre, but a caſtelle, wherin we be cloſed agaynſt the aſſautes of the lyfe? Of trouth you ought more to couete, to take that

you find at your deth, than the hurte of that you ſhal leue in your lyfe. I demand of you, what is it, that dothe you moſt peyne, in leſyng of the lyfe? If you peyn your ſelf, for Helie Fabrice your wyfe, bicauſe you leaue her yonge, wery not yourſelf, for ſhe is wel thought on in Rome, for any peryll of your lyfe. And as ſoone as ſhe knoweth it, I am in certayne, ſhe wyll not wepe moche, though you go your way. Thā you ought not to wepe, for leuyng of her. Theſe yonge damoyſels, maried to old men, haue euer their eyes fixed in the deth of their huſbandes. And holly faſten their hartes on him, that they think, to mary with ageyn. They wepe with their eies, &amp; laughe in their hartis. And thinke not contrary, though ſhe be an empreſſe, and can not fynde an other emperour, to be her huſbande, yet ſhe wyll fynde ſome other man. For if they be ſoo determyned, they wyll change their robes of ſylke, for a gowne of clothe. I dare well ſaye, they more deſyre a yonge ſheparde, than an olde emperour. If you care for your chyldren, whom ye muſte leaue behind you: I can not tell, why you ſhuld do ſo. For if your deth be diſpleaſant to them, moch more diſpleaſeth them, yt you liue ſo longe. It is great pein to the child, not to deſire the deth of his father: For if he be poore, it is for feare, how they ſhuld be mainteined: if he be ryche, thā bicauſe he ſhalbe his heire. They ſynge, &amp; you wepe, you fere the deth &amp; wepe, bicauſe you leaue your life. Doo you not know, yt after the night cometh the dewy mornyng: &amp; after yt cometh the bright ſon: &amp; after ye ſon comith a derk cloude, and after ageyn cometh faire wether, &amp; after that cometh lightnyng &amp; thonder: &amp; than again clere aire? Alſo I ſay, that after infancy, cometh childhode, thā cometh youth, &amp; age after that, and ſo at laſte cometh deth, and after dethe, fearefull hope, of a ſure lyfe. Sir, beleue me, in one thyng, The beginning, the meane, and the ende euery man hath.

Certainly, if you had ben takē as the floure fro the herbe: if you had ben cut grene fro the tree, if you had ben graffed in primetyme: if you had ben eaten in the ſowernes of the vyne: I meane, if in the fyrſte youthe, whan lyfe was at the ſweteſt, if dethe had come and knocked at the gate, ye ſhulde haue had cauſe to be ſory: but as nowe, the walles are weake and redye to falle, and the flowre wythered, and the very putrified, the ſpeare full of moſſe, and canne not drawe the knyfe out of the ſhethe. Herein you haue deſired the worlde, as if you had neuer knowen the worlde .Lxii. yere you haue ben priſoner in the dongeon of the body: &amp; now whan the ſhakles or gyues ſhuld be taken from you, you complayne: you lorde wold make newe of other newes. He that thinketh it nat ſufficient, to lyue .lxii. yeres in this dethe, or to dye in this lyfe, he wyll not be contente with thre ſcore thouſande.
            ¶Auguſte the Emperour ſayde, that after that men had lyued .l. yeres, they ought to dye, orels cauſe them ſelfe to be ſlayne, bycauſe that vnto that tyme, is the felycitie of man. He that lyueth beyonde that tyme, paſſeth his tyme in heuyneſſe, in greuous aches, deathe of his chylderne, and loſſe of his goodes, in importunities of his chyldren in lawe, buryenge of his frendes, ſuſteynynge proceſſe, payinge of dettis, and other infinyte trauayles: So that it were better, with his eies clooſed to abyde theym in his graue, thanne with his eyes open, to abyde theym in his lyfe dayes. Certaynly it is a fortune of all fortunes, and he is ryght priuie with the goddis, that at .l. yere, leaueth his lyfe. For al the time that he liueth after, is in decaying, and neuer vpryght, but rollyng, relynge, and redy to fall. O Marc my dere lorde, do you not know, that by the ſame way, that lyfe gothe, cometh dethe? It is .lxii. yere, that ye haue ſoughte the one from the other. And whan ye wente

fro Rome, where as you lefte your howſe, ye wente to Illirike, where you lefte a great peſtylence: and nowe you are retourned into Hungarie. Do you not knowe, that as ſoone as you were borne, to gouerne the erthe, incontinent dethe iſſued out of his ſepulchre, to fynde your lyfe? And if you haue honored ambaſſadours of the ſtraunge kynges, moche more ye oughte to honour deathe, that cometh fro the goddis. What lordſhyp can be loſte in this lyfe, but you ſhal fynde greatter in the death? Are you not remembred, whan Vulcan my ſonne in lawe poiſoned me, bicauſe he deſyred my goodes more than my lyfe, howe you, my lorde, for loue that you had to me, gaue me comforte and counſell, for the deth of my ſorowfull youth: and you ſayd to me, the goddis were cruell, in kyllynge of them that be yonge, and pitiefull, whan they burie theym that be olde. And alſo you ſayde to me, Comforte thy ſelfe Panutius: For if thou dydſt lyue to dye, now than thou dyeſt to liue. Therfore right high and myghty prince, I ſaye to you, as you ſayde to me: and I counſayle you, as you counſayled me, and that you gaue me, I gyue you ageyne. Fynally, of this repynge, take the beſt in worthe, &amp; let the reſt abide.
         
         
            ¶How themperour demanded to haue in writing, al that the Secretarie had ſayde. Cap. xli.
            
               ANd as of the contentynge of the wylle, oftentymes procedeth helthe and eaſe of the body, the emperour was wel ſatiſfied with the wordes of Panutius, whiche he eloquently vttered, and with profounde counſell, hardily and familyarly, and in due tyme, as a good frende. Great cō
               paſſion it is, to them that wold die, whā it is ſhewed them, what they ought to do. For of them that be about the bed,

ſomme robbe hym of his money, ſomme ſerue hym welle, ſome holde the place, to be his heire, ſome gape for gyftes, ſome wepe for loſynge of hym, ſomme laugh for the gaynes they haue by his death, and ſo in this maner the poore pacient, hauyng many, lokynge for their profyte, hath no body to counſel hym. We ſe dayly, that ſeruātes, whā they ſe the going out of the cādell of lyfe, care not for the clēſing of their lordes vyces. And therof cometh, that as ſone as he is deed, ſtreight way begynneth to ſtynke. And ſo I ſay, that the ende of his lyfe, is the begynnynge of his infamy. All they that were there, as well the olde ſeruantes as the newe, belongynge to themperour, capitaynes of warre, &amp; other, were not a lyttell abaſhed, of the ſayenge of Panutius, and they all allowed his ſayinge, and ſayde, he was worthy to haue the gouernaunce of thempire. The good emperour, all the ſeaſon that Panutius ſpake, wept with depe ſighes fro his harte. And bycauſe he was ſo ſore greued, he coude not forthwith giue hym an anſwere: At the laſte he commanded Panutius, to giue him in writyng, al that he had ſayd, to thentent that he myght ſtudye theron. For he ſaid, it was no reſon, to forget thinges ſo well ſaid. So all the reſt of that night, the Secretarie occupied hym ſelfe, to put in writing the ſame ſayinge: and the next day he delyuered it to themperour, whiche toke it, and looked theron all the day: and kept it ſtyll in his handes, and oftē times redde theron, And the next nyght themperour ſente for the Secretarie, &amp; in open audience he ſaid, as foloweth.
         
         
            The anſwere of themperour to Panutius. ca. xlii.
            HAppy was the mylke, that thou ſuckedſt in Dacie, &amp; the bread, yt thou diddeſt eate at Rome, &amp; the lernyng, that thou haddeſt in Athenes, and thy bringyng vp in my

hous. For in my lyfe, thou haſte wel ſerued me, and at my dethe, thou haſt well counſayled me. I commande Commodus my ſonne, to rewarde the for thy good ſeruice. And I pray the goddis, to recompence the for thy councel. The reward for diuers ſeruices a mā may make: but ye rewarde for good coūcel, all the goddis had nede to do. The gretiſt reward, that one frend may do to an other, is in a great &amp; weightie matter, to ſuccour him with good councel. Al the trauailes of the worlde are weightie, but the trauaylle of dethe is the weightieſt: all be perillous, but that is moſte perillous: al ben great, but this is the gretteſt: al thingis haue an ende at laſt by deth, ſaufe only deth, whoſe ende is vnknowē. He that is hurte with deth, is as he, yt is ſicke of the ſleping euill, hauing a quicke vnderſtandyng, &amp; yet he knoweth no man: &amp; many thinges beinge offered to hym, he can determine vpon none. Yet againe I ſay, he is a true and faithfull frende, that in ſuch time, wil giue good coū
               ſel to his frend. All they that here this, that I ſay, wyl ſay, that it is true. But I ſweare, that noo man can knowe it perfitely, but he that is in caſe, that I am in, redye to dye .Lxii. yere hath ben the cours of my lyfe, and nowe deathe commaundeth me, to cloſe myn eies, &amp; to folowe the cours of deth. Moreouer, as thou knoweſt not the infirmitie, ſo thou approcheſt not to the cure and helthe. The dolour is not there, as thou haſt made defenſiues, it is not the fiſtula, where againſt thou haſt giuen cautere, it is not ageinſt opilations, that thou haſt giuen ſiropes, it is not in ye veines, yt thou haſt giuen me inciſion: Thou haſt not wel heled the wounde, that thou haſt ſtitched me. I ſay, that thou muſt entre further in me, to knowe perfitely myne acceſſe. The ſighes that procede fro the botom of my hert, can not be vnderſtanden with heringe of them: the goddis alonly know ye thoughtes of ye hart. Alſo diuers thingis ar in me,

that I knowe not of my ſelfe, noo more than that is without me. O Panutius, thou accuſeſt me that I feare death. To feare it greatly, I deny it: but I confeſſe to feare it as a man. Of trouth, if I ſhuld ſay, that I feare not death, I muſte deny, that I am not made of fleſhe. We ſe, that the Olyphant feareth the lyon, and the beare feareth the olyphant, and the wolfe fearethe the beare, and the ſhepe fearethe the wolfe, and the ratte the catte, and the catte the dogge, and the dogge the man, and all onely theyr feare is, that they drede to be ſlayne. Than if theſe brute beſtes refuſe deth, not fearynge the fyghtynge with furious ſpirites, nor the enioyenge with the goddes: Howe moche rather oughte we to feare the deathe? For we are in feare to be torne in pieces with the furies in theyr peynes, or to be receyued in pleaſure with the goddes. Therfore I ſay, that the naturall feare of deathe, I haue ouer come with the bridell and lyberties of reaſon. Thinkeſte thou Panutius, that I ſee not my graſſe waſted, and my grapes gathered, that my houſe breaketh, and that I haue nothyng left, but the ſtocke of the grapes, the ſkynne of the fleſſhe, and but one onely blaſte of all my lyfe? Thou ſeeſte well, that by the tokens, the exerciſe is ſene. And nettes be caſte in the riuers, and in the parkes bulles bene chaſed. I ſaye that the rumour of deathe holdeth in ſauetie the lyfe that is in me, at this houre redy armed agaynſt dethe. I make batayle with deathe, at this houre barayne and naked of lyfe: and ſo redy to entre into the ſepulchre: at this houre I ſhall entre in to the campe, where as I ſhall not be gored with bulles, but ſhall be eaten with wormes: and fynally, I ſhal go, from whens I can not flee. Thus I hope abydyng deth. And this I ſay, bycauſe thou ſhalt knowe, that I knowe it, and that thou ſhalt fele, that I fele. And to the entent thou lyue vnbegiled, I wyll tell the a ſecrete.

ſecrete. The nouelties, that thou haſt ſene in me, as in abhorrynge of meate, bereuynge of ſlepe, liuynge alone, werynes of company, drownynge in ſyghes, and paſtyme in wepynge: Thou mayſte wel thinke, what turment ought to be in the ſee of my harte, whan ſuche tremblynges and motions of erthe and reynes are ſet in the erthe of my body. Shal I ſhew ye, wherfore my body is in this thought, and my herte in ſuche trouble? The cauſe, why I ſuffre dethe ſoo greuouſely, is that I leaue my ſonne Commode in this lyfe, in a perillous age for him, and ſuſpecious for thempire. By the floures the fruites are knowen, and the viues in burgenyng: by the colt the hors is knowen, whether he ſhall be meke or ſtubborne for labour or cariage: &amp; in the youthe the yonge man is knowen: and by the lytell that I ſe in my lyfe by my ſonne Commode, I feare me, it wyll be leſſe after my deth. Thou knoweſt not, why I ſay thus. And I ſay it not without cauſe: for my ſonne Commode is very yonge, and yet yonger in wytte. He is of an yll inclination, but he be forced: he gouerneth hym ſelfe by his owne wytte and vnderſtandyng, as thoughe he were a man of experince: he knoweth but lyttelle, and carethe for nothynge. Of the tyme paſſed he hath no knowledge: all onely he occupieth hym ſelfe with the tyme preſent. Fynally, by that I ſe with myn eies, and thynke in my harte, I feare me the perſonne of my ſonne ſhall be in peryll, and the memorie of his fathers howſe peryſſhe. Fauſtyne his mother hath foſtred hym to delycately: and by a harde ſtony grounde he hath a great way to go. He entreth as now alone into the pathe of youth without any guyde. I feare me he ſhall goo out of the ryght waye, and wander in the buſhes and thornes of vices. O Panutius, harken what I ſay, I ſay it not without teares, thou ſeeſte that my ſon remayneth ryche, yonge, and at libertie. Ryches youthe,

ſolitarines, and lybertie ben .iiii. peſtilences, that enpoyſone the prince, and waſte the common welthe: hit ſleethe them that be a lyue, &amp; infameth them that be deed. Beleue me one thynge, dyuers graces are requiſite to ſuſteyn diuers vertues. With the faireſt women the brothell houſes are peopled, the mooſte vilaynes are made ruffyens: the moſte hardye are robbers in woddes: the quickeſte of vnderſtandynge ofte proue fooles: and the mooſte ſubtylle becom theues. I ſay, that ſuch as are clothed with dyuers graces of nature, lacke the furres of accquired vertues. We may ſay, they hold in their handes a knyfe, wherwith they ſtryke and hurte theym ſelfes: fire on their ſhulders, wherwith they bren: and a corde about their necke, wherwith they hange: daggers at theyr ſtomacke, wherwith they are ſtayne: thornes at theyr feete, wherwith they are pricked: a ſtony way afore theyr eies, where they ſtomble, and ſtomblynge fall, and fallynge they leſe theyr life, and wynne dethe. The great trees of whom we haue fruite in wynter, and ſhadowe in ſommer, firſt be planted the rotes faſte in the entrayles of the erthe, or euer theyr wauerynge boughes are aduentured in the wynd. Marke Panutius, marke well. The man that from his youth hath, ſet before hym the feare of the goddis, and the ſhame of men, is habited in vertues: &amp; he that accompanieth with them that be vertuous, mainteyneth trouth to euery mā, and liueth without preiudice of any man. Malicious fortune maye ſomtyme cleue the barke of the welthe of ſuche a tree, wyther the floure in his youthe, breake the leaues of his fauour, gather the fruite of his trauaylle, breake downe a bough of his offices, &amp; bowe downe the height of his coū
               cell: yet for all the ſtrokes that the wynde can ſtrike, it can not be plucked vp by the rote. Certaynely the ſonne that the father hath endued with graces, and the ſonne applienge

hym in vices, ought not to be borne in this worlde: &amp; if he be borne, to be buried quicke. For the fathers ſweate by day, and watche by nyght, to leue honour to their children, whiche the fathers bye of the goddis with ſighes, &amp; the mothers delyuered of them with peyne, and bring thē vp with trauayle: and the chylde proueth ſo, that he giueth greuous age to the father in his lyfe, &amp; great infamy after his death. I conſider wel, that the prince Comode, beinge yonge and I olde, ageynſt his wyl, forbare vyces, &amp; I fere me, that after my deth, he wyll hate vertues. I remēbre diuers of his age, haue inherited the empire, whiche were ſo hardy in their lyues, that they deſerued to be called tyrantes after their dethes. Exāple of Denys, renoumed tyrant of Sycill, whiche hired theym that coude inuent vices, as our Rome rewardeth them that conquere realmes. What greatter tyranny can be in a tyrāt, than to make moſt priuie to him, thē that be vicious? Alſo I forget not the foure kinges, that ſucceded after great Alexāder, as Ptholome, Anthiocꝰ, Siluiꝰ, &amp; Antigonus, whiche the grekes called great tirantis: all that Alexāder had gotten with renomed triūphes, they loſt by their viciouſnes. And in this maner the world yt Alexāder had deuided amonge them .iiii. came to the handes of mo than foure .C. for Antigonꝰ ſet ſo litle by that had coſt his lord Alexāder ſo moch, &amp; was ſo lighte in his age, &amp; ſo bolde in his realme, yt in mockery in ye ſtede of a crowne of gold, he ware a garlande of Iuie: &amp; in ſtede of a ſcepter, he bare a thyſtle in his right hande: and after that maner, he wold ſyt amonge his men, &amp; whan he ſpake to ſtrangers. I lay ſhame to the yong man ſo to do, but I meruayle, that the ſadde and wyſe men of grece ſuffred it. ¶I remembre alſo Caligula the .iiii. emperour of Rome, a yonge man, in whoſe tyme it was harde to knowe, whiche was the greatter, eyther the diſobedience of the people

to their lorde, or the hatrede, that the lorde bare to the people. And this yonge prince went ſo farre oute of the waye in his youthe, and was ſo farre wyde frome reaſon in his tyrannies, that euery man ſtudyed, howe to take his lyfe from hym: &amp; he ſtudied to ſlee euery man. He wrote theſe wordes in a table of golde: Wolde to god, that all Rome hadde but one heed, to the entente that with one ſtroke, I myght ſtryke it of.
            ¶I alſo remembre Tyberie, ſonne adoptiue of good Auguſte, called Auguſt, bycauſe he augmented Rome. But this good olde prince dyd not ſo moche augmente it in his lyfe, but this yonge ſucceſſour diſtroyed it moche more after his deathe. The hate that the Romayne people had agaynſte Tyberie in his lyfe, was ryght welle ſhewed after his dethe. For the ſame day that he dyed, or whan he was ſlayne, the people made dyuers proceſſions, and the ſenatours offred great gyftes in the temples, and the prieſtes offred gret ſacrifices to their goddis, to thentent that they ſhulde not receyue the ſoule of the ſayd Tiberie into their glorie: but to ſende it to the furies of Hell.
            ¶Alſo I mynde Patrocle, the ſeconde kynge of Corynthe, whiche enheryted the realme, beinge but .xvi. yere of age, and he was ſo vycious of his body, and ſo lyberall of his mouthe, that where as his father helde the realme .lx. yere, he poſſeſſed it but .xxx. dayes.
            ¶Alſo the auncient Tarquin the proude, the .vii. kynge of Rome, whiche was ryght goodly in geſture, ryght valyant in armes, and of a cleane bloudde, as an vnhappye prince, defyled al his vertues with noughtye lyuynge: in ſuche wyſe, that he conuerted his beautie into lechery, his power into tyranny, for the villany that he did to Lucrece, the chaſte lady of Rome, wherby he loſt not onely his realme, but the name of Tarquine was banyſſhed for euer

out of Rome.
            ¶I remembre cruelle Nero, whiche inheryted, and dyed yonge: &amp; in hym ended the memorie of the noble Ceſars: and by hym was renewed the memorye of Antygones the tyrantes. Whom thynkeſt thou this tyrant wolde ſuffre to lyue, whiche ſlewe his owne mother? Tell me I pray the, what harte is that of a chylde, to ſlee his owne mother, to open the breſtes that he ſucked, to ſhedde the blood of her that nouryſhed hym in her armes, and to beholde the entrayles, wherin he was fourmed? What thynkeſte thou, that he wolde not haue done, ſithe he commytted ſuche an yll dede? The day that Nero ſlew his mother, an oratour ſayd in the ſenate, that Agrippyne his mother had deſerued deth, for chyldyng ſuche a chylde in Rome. Theſe thre dayes, that thou haſte ſene me ſo altered in my mynde, all theſe thinges came before me: and I haue drawen theym into the depenes of my harte, and diſputed theym. This ſonne of myn holdeth me in the gulfe of the ſee, betwene the wawes of feare, and the ankers of diſpayre, hopynge, that he ſhoulde be good, bycauſe I haue nouryſſhed hym well, and fearynge, that he ſhulde be ylle, bycauſe his mother Fauſtine hath brought hym vppe wantonly, and the yonge man is inclined to yll. And as ye ſe a thynge made by artyfice peryſhe, and a naturall thynge laſte: I am in great feare, that after my dethe, he wyl tourne that waye, that his mother hath chylded hym, and not as I haue noriſhed hym. O how happy were I, if I had neuer a childe, to leue behinde me to be emperour? Then a childe myght be choſen amonge children of good fathers, and I ſhulde not haue ben troubled with him, that the goddis haue gyuen me. Panutius, I demaunde one thynge of the, whether thou calleſt moſte fortunate, Vaſpaſian the naturalle father of Domitian, or els Nerua, the father adoptiue of

Traian? Vaſpaſian was good, and Nerua verye good, &amp; Domitian was of all other mooſte cruelle, and Trayane the myrrour of all clemency. Thā regard, how Vaſpaſian in the fortune to haue chyldren was vnhappy, and Nerua in the mysfortune to haue chyldren was happy. I knowe not why theſe fathers deſyre to haue children, ſith they ben the occaſion of ſo moche trauayle. O Panutius, I wyll ſay one thynge to the, as a frende to a frende (as thou knoweſt wel we be in this worlde) I haue lyued .lxii. yeres, in whiche tyme I haue redde many thinges, and haue hard, ſene, deſired, atteyned, poſſeſſed, ſuffred, and reſted moch, and nowe at this tyme I muſt dye: and of al thing I ſhal beare nothing away, bycauſe bothe it and I are nothyng. Great beſines the hart hath to ſerche for theſe goodes, and great trauayle to come to them: but without compariſon the greatteſt dolour is at the houre of the dethe, to depart and leaue them. What greatter diſeaſe can be to the body, than ſodaynely to be ſurpriſed with ennemies? What peryll of the ſee, or loſſe of frendes, can be egall, to ſe a vertuous man drawe to his deathe, to leaue the ſweate of his face, the auctoritie of the empire, the honour of his perſone, the company of his frendes, the remedye of his dettours, the rewardynge of his ſeruantes? and to leaue it to a chylde, that hath not merited it, nor hath not the power to wyll to merite it.
            ¶In the .ix. table of the lawes were theſe wordis written: We cōmaunde and ordeyne, that euery father, who in the opinion of all men is good, ſhall diſheryte his ſonne, that is yll in euery mans opinion. Alſo euery chylde, what ſoo euer he be, that diſobeyeth his father, or robbeth any temple, or hurt any wydowe, ſo that ſhe blede, flee fro the battayle, or do any treaſon to a ſtranger, who ſo euer is found in any of theſe fyue caſes, lette hym be banyſſhed for euer

the habitation of Rome, and caſte out fro the herytage of his father.
            ¶In good ſoth this lawe was good, and in the tyme of Quintus Cincinate, hit was ordeyned, and nowe by vs, whiche be vnhappy, it is cleane lefte and forgotten. Panutius without doubte I am wery to ſpeake, and alſo I haue ſuche an impediment in my ſtomacke, that I wante brethe: or elles I coulde ſhewe the all by order, if myne vnderſtandynge fayled me not, howe manye Parthiens, Mediens, Aſſiriens, Caldiens, Indiens, Egypeyens, Hebrewes, Grekes, and Romaynes, haue lefte theyr chyldren poore, and myght haue left them ryche: and all was bycauſe they were vicious: and other chyldren that were very poore, were lefte ryche, bycauſe they were good and vertuous. I ſwere to the by the immortall goddes, that whan I came fro the warres betwene the Parthiens and Rome, and that the triumphe and glorye was gyuen to me, and my ſonne confirmed to be emperour: I wolde the Senate hadde lefte me my ſonne Commodus poore, with all his vyces, and that I hadde made the Senate heire and lorde to the empire: and to haue chaſtiſed hym to the exaumple of all the worlde. I wyll that thou knowe, I ſhall carie fyue thynges with me out of this worlde intermedled, the whiche is great ſorowe to my harte. The fyrſte is, that I haue not determyned and iudged the ple
                  •
                and proceſſe of the noble wydowe Druſia, with the Senate, ſeinge that ſhe is very poore, and hath noo bodye to doo her Iuſtyce: The ſeconde is, bycauſe I doo not dye in Rome, to the intente that I myghte cauſe to be cryed and proclaymed euery where in Rome, er I dyed, to wyte if any complayned on me: the thyrde is, that where as I dyd ſlee .xiiii. tyrantes that vndyd the countreye, that I hadde not as well banyſhed all the Pirates that kepte the ſees▪
               
the fourth is, that I lefte my dere ſonne Veriſſimus deed: and the .v. that I haue lefte alyue, as heire to the empire, my ſonne Commodus. O Panutius, the greatteſt happe, that the goddis can giue to a man (not couetous but vertuous) is to gyue him renoume in his lyfe, &amp; a good heire, to conſerue him after his deathe. Fynally to conclude, I pray to the goddes, if I ſhall haue any parte with theym, that if by my ſonnes offences, Rome be ſclandred, and my renoume miniſhed, and my hous loſt by his life, that they wyll take a way his lyfe yet or I dye.
         
         
            ¶What themperour ſayde to the mayſters of his ſonne, and to the rulers of thempire. Cap. xliii.
            
               I Se you aunciēt fathers and noble Romayns, and ryght faythful ſeruantes, take peyne and ſorowe, for that I muſt yelde me to dethe, and leaue this lyfe, and treate with my ſepulchre. Ye ſorow for my ſorowe, ye are tourmented with myn anguyſhe, &amp; peyned for my peyne: it is no meruaylle. For the clere vnderſtandynge of the pure blod of true and faythfull frendes, is to double theyr trauayles, and to wepe for other: if one brute beaſt morne for an other, moch more ought one humayne creature to ſo towe for an other. And this I ſay, bycauſe I know by the teares of your eyes, the felynge of your hartes. And ſythe that the greatteſt rewarde for any benefite, is to knowe it, and thanke the patie therof: as moche as I can, I thanke you. And if my weake thankes be not correſpondente to your pitiefulle wepynge, I require the goddis, after they haue taken awaye my lyfe, to rewarde you for my duetie. It is greate pleaſure for the familie to knowe their mayſter

go with the goddis, and great peyne to hym to leaue them. For company of many yeres is loth to leaue the life. In my lyfe tyme I haue done with you as I ought to do, and as nowe I muſt do as I may. The goddis wyll take my ſowle away, Comodus my ſonne the empire, the ſepulchre my bodye, and ye my ſpeciall frendes my harte. And ſothly it is reaſon, that ſith ye were in the lyfe my hartes, that it be yours after my deth. And in that I wyll ſpeake more particular this nyght ſhall be our reaſonnyng. Now my harty frendes ye ſe, that I am come to the ende of my laſte iourney, and to the begynnynge of my firſte iourney with the goddis. It is reaſon, that ſyth I haue loued you in time paſt, that ye beleue me nowe. For the time is come that ye can demande nothyng of me: nor I haue nothing to offre you: nor myn eares as now can not here flatteries, nor my harte ſuffre importunities: if ye neuer knewe me, knowe me now. I haue ben he that I am, and am he that hath ben, in tymes paſte lyke vnto you, ſome what: nowe ye ſe I am but lyttell, and within a lyttell whyle I ſhalbe nothynge. This daye ſhall ende the lyfe of Marke your frende, this day ſhall ende the lyfe of Marc your parente, this day ſhal ende the fatal deſtenies of Marc your lorde, this day ſhal ende the ſeignory of Marke your emperour, and this day ſhall ende his empire. I haue vanquyſſhed many, and nowe I am ouercome with deth: I am he that hath cauſed many to dye, and I can not as now gyue my ſelfe one day of lyfe: I am he that hathe entred into chariottes of golde, and this day I ſhall be layde on a biere of wodde: I am he, for whome many haue ſonge meryly, and this day they wepe: I am he that hath had company in all exercites, and this day I ſhall be gyuen to hungrye wormes: I am Marcus greatly renoumed, that with famous triumph mounted into the high capytolle, and this

day with forgetfulnes I ſhall diſcende into the ſepulchre. I ſee nigh with myn eies, that was farre hyd in my harte. And as the goddis be fauourable to you in this worlde, &amp; equalle and fauourable to me in an nother worlde, as my fleſhe neuer toke pleaſure to paſſe this lyfe, but my harte was ſodaynly taken with the feare of death: than take no peyne for me, for eyther I muſte ſee the ende of you, or you of me. I yelde great thankes to the goddis, that they take away this olde perſone to reſt with theym, and leaue you yonge for to ſerue in thempire. For there is no comparyſon for to ſpeake of dethe to the lyfe, nor to eſchewe the deathe at the houre therof. And yet I wylle not denye, but I do feare dethe, as a mortal man. Whan the lyfe paſſeth, there is no prudence in a prudente, nor vertue in a vertuous, nor lordſhyp in a lorde, that can take away the feare of the ſpirite, nor peyne of the fleſſhe. Atte this tyme the ſowle and the fleſhe are ſo combyned and ſo conglutinate togyther, and the ſpirite with the bloude are ſoo annexed, that the ſeparation of the one from the other is the mooſte terrible, and the laſt terrible of all terriblenes. Certaynly it accordeth vnto good reaſon, that the ſowle departe dolorouſly, leauyng the fleſhe vnto wormes, and the bodye as enuious to ſe the ſowle go and ſporte with the goddis. O what lyttell thoughte we take in this lyfe, vntylle we falle grouelynge with oure eies vppon deathe. Beleue me, Sythe I haue paſſed from whens ye be, and haue experimented that ye doo ſe, that is the vanities of vs that are vayne, is ſo agreable to vs, that whanne we begynne to lyue, we ymagyne that our lyfe wylle endure a holle worlde: and whanne it is ended, it ſeemeth vs to be but a puffe or a blaſte of wynde. And bycauſe than ſenſualitie peyneth for ſenſibilitie, and the fleſſhe for the fleſſhe, reaſon guyded with them that be mortall tellethe me, that it

peyneth not with the departynge. If I haue lyued as a bruetbeaſt, it is reaſon that I dye as a diſcrete man ought to do. I dyenge, this day ſhal dye all my ſickenes, hungre ſhal dye, colde ſhal dye, al my peynes ſhal die, my thought ſhall dye, my diſpleaſure ſhall dye, and euery thynge that gyueth peyne and ſorowe. This day the nyght ſhall be taken away, and the ſonne ſhyne bryghte in the ſkye: This daye the ruſte ſhall be takem from myne eies, and I ſhall ſee the ſonne clerely: This daye the waye ſhall be made ſmothe for to goo righte: this is, the daye ſhall ende the iourney, wherin I ſhall not drede the ſtayes of Fortune. I thanke the goddes immortall, that haue ſuffered me to lyue ſo clerely, and ſoo longe a tyme. This daye I ſhall haue an ende of al vnhappy deſtenes of enuyous fortune, and not they of me. Of trouthe if the goddis haue commaunded my fleſſhe to be hydden in the ſepulchre, and to be as mortalle: yet if they be iuſte and doo well, they wyll make my renoume to be immortall, bycauſe I haue lyued well. Than ſith I change this wery lyfe and company of menne, for the ſwetenes of the goddis, and the doubtes of fortune for this ſure lyfe, and greate and continuall feare for perpetuall peace, and this ylle and naughty corrupte lyfe for good renoume and glorye, I thynke veryly this ſhuld be none yll change.
            ¶It is nowe thre ſcore and two yeres ſythe the erthe hath ſuſteyned and fedde the erthe of my bodye: It is nowe tyme that the erthe knowledge me for her ſonne, and I wyl alſo take her for my mother. Verely it is a pitiful mother, that wylle nowe take me in to her entrayles for euer, ſythe that I haue ſoo longe ſpace troden her vnder my feete. And yet thoughe that I were as I am, for to be as ſhe is, I am in certayne that ſhe wolde kepe me ſurer amonge her wormes, than Rome amonge the Senatours.

And all though it be peynefulle to you, if it pleſe the goddes to haue it thus, no mā can excuſe nor ſcape it. I ſhuld be right well eaſed, if this webbe were broken, and my poſſeſſion taken in the Sepulcre. Than ſhulde I haue the fyrſt thyng propre of myn owne, and perpetuall without any feare of leſynge therof. All thynges mortal, that mortalle folkes haue, and the enuye of them that be enuious maye be broken, except the deth and the ſepulcre, the whiche are priuileged from enraged hongre of enuy. I ſe you wel, ſhedynge teres from your eies, and reiſe heuy ſighes frome the depenes of your hartes. Wylle ye not that I ſhulde deſyre deathe, ſith the phiſitions gyue me but thre houres of lyfe? and there are conteyned in me .iii.M. yeres of peynes, the length wherof is a cyroniſme of deathe. And all though our debilite be weake, yet for all that our honour is ſo ſenſible, that at the houre of deathe, the more that the bones diſchargeth them of the fleſhe, the more is the hart charged with thoughtes. In manner that whan the ſinewes vntie them from the bones of the bodye, than newely they tye agayne a ſoore knotte to the herte. Nowe let vs leaue ſpeakyng of that that to wchethe particularly my ſelfe, and ſpeake we in generall of it that is conuenyente to a yonge Prynce, and to you that are his tutours and mayſters.
            ¶Ye ſe here my ſonne Comodus only prince and heire, abydynge for the heritage of thempire: neyther for beynge good, that he meriteth praiſe, nor for being yl reprefe.

Dyuers tymes whan he was a chylde, ye toke hym in your armes, to thentente that nowe he is a man, ye ſhulde ſette him in your hartes. Hytherto he hath taken you for his mayſters: and nowe at this tyme, he muſte repute you as his fathers. And whiles I lyued, ye

Hytherto ye onely helde him charge, as father, mother, and mayſters: he is nowe as a newe ſhyppe put this daye into the ryghte ſee, fletyng to the botomles ſwolowe, where as the ſayles of proſperitie wyll make hym fall, and the rockes of vnhappynes wyll drowne hym. Than amonge ſo many vnportunate wyndes and vnſtable waters, there is greatte neceſſitie of good oores. Surely I am very ſory for thempire, and haue great compaſſion of this yonge prince, and ſuche as wolde his welthe, ſhall more bewaylle his lyfe than my dethe. For ſcapynge fro the ſee I ſe my ſelfe at a good ſure porte, and vppon mayne lande, and leaue hym the ſweatte and trauayle. For as yet he knoweth not howe to aduenture to ſayle on the ſee: nor yet knoweth not whether he ſhal abyde the age of my long experience, nor whether he ſhall be a reaſonable emperour or noo. But what ſhall ſorowfull Rome do, whan it hath nouryſhed a good prynce, and that fatall deſtenies maketh an ende of hym? or that by enuy of them that be yll he is ſlayne? or the crueltie of the goddes taketh hym away: or that the body by his owne propre handes be lyfte vp in ſuche wyſe, that in the experiment of princes, al the life tyme parteth in be waylynge of the youthe of yonge princes, and the grauitie of theyr aunciente princes paſſed. O if theſe princis beleued at the beginnynge of theyr empire, other kynges that are fayled in the world, howe they be taught when it is ſo importable for one man without charge to rule ſoo many realmes, and he doinge nothynge but take theyr goodes, robbe him of his renoume, baniſhe theyr perſons fro him, and he to ende his lyfe, and his ſubiectes augmente theyr ſorowes: and ſith he is but one, he can doo no more than

one, though dyuers hope that he doth for all. Regarde in what myſaduenture a prince lyueth, whan the leaſt villain in Italy thinketh, that all only for hym and on hym alone the prince ſetteth his eies. And ſithe the worlde is ſo changeable, and the people ſo vnruly, the day that a prynce is crowned and exalted with a ſceptre ryalle, the ſame daye he ſubmitteth his goodis to the couetous, &amp; all his eſtate to the ſemblaunce of other. Thus than in this the goddis ſhewe their power. For al the vnderſtandinges are tacked to one free wyll. The ſemynge of all they codempne, and alowe but one. They giue the domination to one, and the ſubiection to many. To one they gyue the chaſtiſemente of all, and not al to the chaſtiſement of one. For the taſt of many, they gyue meate but to one: the ſauour wherof is ſwete to ſome, and ſowre to other: to ſome remayneth the bone, and to ſome the fleſhe: at the laſt ſome be drowned &amp; other be hyndred, &amp; at the ende al haue an ende. I wold demand of you that be moſte familiar, what is the crowne of thempire, or the ſceptre of golde, or the coler of perles or p̄
               cious ſtones, or rubes of Alexāder, or veſſel of Corinth, or chariottes of triūph, or what offices of Conſules or dictatours are deſired in change of their reſt? for it is certaine, they can not attayn to the one, without leſing of the other. And this is the cauſe yt there be yl mariners, &amp; to hardy pilottes, for they fle fro the ſee to the lande, &amp; fro the lande to the ſee. One thing I wil ſay, yt is ageinſt my ſelf: euery mā hateth warre, &amp; no man ſeketh for peace. Al ſorowe for one that is angred, and none is cōtent to appeace: al wold cō
               mande, but none wil be commanded. This hath ben in the world paſſed, &amp; now at this preſent tyme men be ſo light, yt they rather choſe to cōmand with peril, than to obey with reſt. Seing that my dayes are diminiſhed, &amp; my ſickenes augmented, ſuſpectinge thā that I ſe nowe, whan I returned

fro the warre of Sycill, I determyned to make my teſtament, the whiche ye may ſee here: Open and behold it, and therby ye ſhall ſe, howe I leaue you to be mayſters of my ſon, yet in loue and fidelitie ye be to gyther all as one. Great peryll the prince is in, and the common welth in an yll aduenture, where as be many intentions amonge the gouernours. Certainly the princis are gloryous, and the people well fortunate, and the ſenate happy, whan all agree in one counſell, and that the counſaylers be auncient, and many of them, and all their intētions agree vpon one thinge. Whan this was in Rome, it was feared and dred of tyrantes, hauynge their conſultations approued with iii.C. barons. And though their reaſons were diuers, yet their wylles and intentis were al one for the comon welth. I deſire and coniure you by the goddis, that ye be al frendes in conuerſation, and conformable in counſell. All the weake debilities in a prince may be ſuffred, except yl counſell: and al defautes of counſellours are tollerable, except enuy and yre. Whan the freting worme called a mothe, entreth among them, it cauſeth peril in Iuſtice, diſhonour to the prince, ſclaunder in the cōmons, and parcialitie in the ſuperiours. The counſaylour that hath his mynde ouercome with ire, and his harte occupied with enuy, and his wordes outragious to a good man, it is reſon that he loſe the fauour of the goddis, his priuitie with the prince, and the credence of the people. For he preſumeth to offende the goddis with yll intention, to ſerue the prince with yll coū
               ſell, and to offende the common welth with his ambition. O howe ignorant are theſe princis, that take hede of ſuche herbes &amp; venims that myghte poyſon theym in their meates, and care not for the poyſon that they of theyr priuye counſayle do gyue them? Doubtles there is no cōpariſon, for the herbes and poyſons can be giuen but on one daye:

but the venym of yll counſeyle is gyuen euery howre. Venym is defended by the horne of an vnycorne, by tryacle, and otherwiſe by vomites: but the poyſon of yll counſell hath no remedy, and leſſe defenſiues. And fynally I ſaye, that the venym gyuen by an enmy can but ſlee one emperour in Rome, but the poyſon gyuen by hym that is moſte priuye to euyll counſell, ſleeth the emperour, and diſtroyeth the common welthe. And where as euery vertuous prince ſetteth more by perpetual renoume than this fallyble lyfe, ye beinge gouernours of thempire, and mayſters to my ſonne, they that owe hym yll wyll haue not ſo moche power ouer his lyfe, as ye haue vpon his renoume. Therfore if he be awaked by his enmies ſtraungers, moche rather he ought to be awaked amonge his domeſticall frendes. One thynge I commaunde as to my ſeruantes, and I deſyre you as my frendes, that ye ſhewe not your ſelfe ſo priuie openly, as ye be in ſecrete: to thentente that ſome ſeme not as natural ſonnes, and other as hired ſeruantes. He that is vertuous, ought to haue great regarde to the profyte of his lorde ſecretely, and to be meke of conuerſation with euery man openly, els his priuetie wyll not lōge endure, and the hate of the prince with the people wyl increace. Oftentymes I haue redde of our predeceſſours, and I haue ſene it in the preſent Romaynes, whan many holde with one, that one holdeth but lyttell with dyuers, and leſſe with many, the which kepeth their wylles as far of, as the perſons be nigh. And ſith the ylnes of the time, and vnſtablenes of fortune neuer leauethe any thynge in one caſe, but all is as in maner of a dreame: the moſt ſure purchaſe is to flee fro peril, for then whā the princes haue paſſed their pleaſures entermedled in trauayles, they ſerche for many, and fynde not one. Therof cometh, that one preſent for feare wyll withdrawe hym, and an other out of

fauour and abſente, wyll not come. I wyll ſhewe you one thynge, the whiche you ſhal alway putte in my ſonnes memorie: They that in our trauayles haue determyned of a long ſeaſon to apply them, we ought to wynne theyr good wylles. The wyly labourer in one yere laboureth to gette cornes togyther, and in an other yere he ſoweth and gadereth. Be not to preſumptuous, for the preſumption of an auncient prince, fordoth the auctoritie of the yonge prince: yet for all this diſpaire nor rebuke hym not to moche: For the lacke of maners in the ſtate of a lorde engendreth vnſhamefaſtnes in hym, and boldnes to the ſeruant. I haue lefte in my teſtament the prince Comodus for your ſonne, and you for his fathers. But I wyll and commande, that euery man knowlege him to be their lorde, and to be at his commaundemente. And ye my other ſeruantes and ſubiectes to be in his obedience, and in all his highe beſyneſſes to be wel guyded as his frēdes and louers. Iuſtice ought to be ſene to, by wiſe oratours, accordynge to the opinion of you that be his gouernours. And alway the determination to be doone by the prince, whiche is lorde of all. One counſell I wyll gyue you (and if you finde it yll, blame me afore the goddis) wherby the empire of my ſonne ſhall be ſtable and permanent in Rome, and your priuetie ſure in his houſe, if your counſelles be moued by reaſon, and his wyll ruled by your counſels. I deſyre ſoore that ye be not couetous: and therfore I haue gyuen you dyuers gyftes and thankes in my lyfe, to take couetouſnes frome you afore my dethe. It were a monſtrous thyng and very dredfull, that ſuche as oughte to refrayne couetyſe fro ſtraungers, to haue their owne handes open for their owne propre lucres. The vertuous priue men, ought not to doo all the yl that they may, nor to deſire all that they may atteyn vnto, to the intente that the prince gyue theym ſoo moche

goodis for the profite of their howſes, as peyne and enuy of the people to their perſones. And as in meane ſhyppes men ſcape beſt in a meane ſee, ſooner than in great carrackes in the wawes of the rorynge and impituous ſees: in lykewiſe ſuche as be in meane eſtate among them that be but meanly enuious, lyue more ſurely, than ſuch as are ſet in high eſtate and priuitie beyng ryche, to be paſſioned amonge ennemies, that diſdainfully wold put them vnder. It is a notable rule amonge wyſe men, and an infallible experience amonge them that be good, and I thynke that by herynge therof the yll ſhall knowlege it: The glorie of one amonge great men maketh ſtryfe, ſuſpection in them that be egall, and enuy amonge them that be meane. One thinge, that they that gouerne well, ought to haue, is lyberalitie. The leſſe ye be couetous, the more ye ſhalbe liberall. For with the rage of couetouſnes the ryght of iuſtice is myniſhed. It is longe tyme ſyth I determined to gyue you the gouernynge of thempire, and the nouriſhynge of my ſonne. And to haue prouided to haue giuen you largely of my goodes, to put the couetynge of other mens goodes from you. I warrant you one thinge: if couetouſnes be amonge you, and be enuyed of your neyghbours, you ſhall lyue in peyne, and your hartes ſhall be peyned with other mens beſyneſſes, and your myndes ſhall be euer in ſuſpecte. Than ſhal ye folowe the Iuſtice of other, where as ye ſhal ſe your owne propre welth. One coūſel finally I wyl gyue you, which I haue taken alway my ſelfe, Neuer commytte your honours to the myſhappes of fortune: nor neuer offre your ſelfe to peryll with hope of remedy. For ſuſpecious fortune kepeth alwayes her gates wyde open for peryl, and her walles ben high, &amp; her wyckettes narow to fynde any remedy. And bycauſe I fele my ſelfe ſore trauayled, I pray you ſuffre me to reſt a lyttell.
         
         
            
            ¶How themperour at the houre of his death, ſent for his ſonne, and declared to him, who ſhulde gouerne the Empire. cap. xliiii.
            
               THus a great parte of the night paſſed, and the day began to breake, and the life of this good emperour began faſte to drawe to an ende: yet for all that he left not the remembrance of ſuch thynges as ſhulde be ordered after his death. There were that tyme in the warre with him diuers right excellēt men ſenatours of Rome: and in al thinges he ſhewed him ſelfe right wiſe, &amp; ſpecially he wold neuer haue any vicious perſon in his houſe. He hadde euer in his company .l. gentilmen knyghtes, and in eche of them he might haue put truſt to gouerne Rome. Oftentymes this good emperour wolde ſay, that princis lyued more ſurely with the gadryng to them men of good lyuyng &amp; conuerſation, thā with treſure of money ſtuffed in theyr cheſtes. Vnhappy is yt prince, that eſtemeth hym ſelfe happy to haue his coffres ful of treſure, and his councell full of men of yl lyuyng. Theſe malicious and yll men make princes poore: and a perfyte man ſuffiſeth to make a holle realme ryche. Surely this emperour ſayde well. For we do ſe daily, that what the father hath gotten in fiftye yeres, the ſon leſethe in halfe a yere. Than chuſinge amonge many a fewe, and of fewe to take the beſt, this emperour appoynted out .vi. notable barons: Thre of thē to be maiſters of his ſon, &amp; .iii. to be gouernours of thempire. One was called Partinax, whiche after was emperour: an other was called Pompeiano, huſbād to his doughter, as ſure in coūcell as he was aged in yeres: The .iii. Gneo Patrocle of the ancient ſtock of the Pompeies, whiche was no leſſe clene in this liuing than his heares were white: The .iiii. was called Andriſco

which in goodlynes of his geſture, highnes of body, vertue of courage, and wyſedome in conſcience, none was egall to him in Rome: The .v. was named Bononius, whiche at that tyme was conſule, and in the aunciente lawes very expert: The laſt was called Iuan Varius the good, and he was called the good, bycauſe that in .lx. yere neuer man ſawe hym do any yll workes, nor harde hym ſpeake any ydel worde, nor do any thynge but it was profytable to the common welthe. Though in caſe they were al egall in gouernynge: yet I ſay theſe laſte thre were princypall. For Iuan Varius particularly was left to be chiefe capitayne of the armye, and to hym was delyueted al the treaſure, and the teſtament was put into his handes: and with ſore weping the emperour recommended to him the prince his ſonne. Than whan the peine of his ſicknes encreaced, and that he loked for the houre of his deth, he comaunded to awake his ſonne Comodus, whiche without any care was faſte a ſlepe, and whan he was brought into the preſence of his father, it was greatte pitie to ſe the eien of the olde emperour ſoore diſcoloured with wepynge, and the eies of the ſonne allmooſte cloſed with ſlepynge: the ſonne was wakynge with ſmall thoughte, and the father coulde not ſlepe for great thoughte and peyne. And whan he was in his preſence, ſeing the lyttell care that the ſonne toke for the deth of his father, and conſideringe the great deſire of the father for the good lyfe of his ſonne, it moued to pitie the hartes of all the great lordes that were there, noo leſſe to leaue the company of the good old man, than the annoyance of the dealynge of the yonge prince. Than the emperour ſayde to his ſonne theſe wordes.
         
         
            ¶What the emperour ſayde to his ſonne at the houre of his dethe. Ca. xlv.
            
               
               VNto thy maiſters and my gouernours I haue ſhewed howe they ſhall counſel the: and nowe my ſonne at this houre I ſay to the, howe they (thoughe they be but a fewe) all for the alone ſhal gouerne: and it is not to be taken in ſmal eſtimation. The mooſte eaſyeſt thynge in the worlde is to giue councel to an other: and the moſte hardeſt and hieſte thinge is a man to take it for him ſelfe. There is none ſo ſimple a man but he may giue good councel, though there be no nede. And there is none ſo wyſe that wyl refuſe councell in tyme of neceſſitie. I ſe one thyng that al take counſell for all, and at the laſte take it for hym ſelfe. Sonne I thinke accordynge to my heuy fatall deſtenies, and thyne yll cuſtomes, that one thinge ſhall not profite the, that is, if the lyttell goodnes that thou haſt done was for feare of me in my lyfe, that thou wylte doo leſſe whan thou haſte forgotten my dethe. I do more nowe for to ſatisfie my deſire and the common welth, than for any hope that I haue of the amendement of thy lyfe. There is not a worſe complaynt, than that a man holdeth of him ſelfe. If thou my ſonne be yl, Rome wyl complayne to the goddis, that they haue giuen the ſo yll inclinations: They wyll complayne of Fauſtine thy mother, that hath brought the vp ſo wantonly: and they wylle complayne on thy ſelfe, that thou doſte not refrayne the from vices: and they ſhall not complayne of thyne olde father, that hath gyuen the ſo many good counſelles. I am in certayne, thou haſt not ſo great dolour to ſee the ende of this nyghte, and the ende of my lyfe, as thou haſt pleaſure to ſe the day that thou ſhalte be emperour: and I haue no meruayle, for where as ſenſualitie reigneth, reaſon is put aſyde. Dyuers thynges are beleued bycauſe they are not knowē certainly. O how many thynges of trouthe ben there, that if they were knowen

truely they ſhulde be lefte. But we ben ſo doubtful in euery thing, and go about our buſineſſis ſo variably and inconſtantly, that ſomtyme our ſpirites breake the purpoſe, and an other tyme they rydde vs not of trouble nor hyndrance. I ſaye we be ſo ſwyfte to do yll, that ſometyme we leſe by a carde of the moſte, and to do wel we be ſo dul, that we leſe by a carde of the leſte: and at the laſte we doo nothing but leſe. Sonne I wyl aduertiſe the by wordes, that I haue knowen in .lxii. yeres by long experience: and ſyth thou arte my ſonne and yonge, it is reaſon that thou beleue hym that is thy olde father. As we princes are regard of all men, and regarde all men, and are regarded of al other, this daye thou doſte enherite thempire of the worlde and the courte of Rome. I knowe well there be inowe in the court of princis, that knowe nothyng what is to make them ſelfe of worthynes, and to maynteyn them ſelf amōg ſo many trūperies as are treated in the houſes of princis. I lette the to witte, that in the courte is auncient parcialities, preſente diſcentions, feareful vnderſtandynges, euidente witteneſſes, entrayles of ſerpentes, tongues of ſcorpions, many detractours, and fewe that ſeke peace: and where as all men ſhulde harken to the comon voyce, euery man ſercheth his owne proufite. Euery manne ſheweth a good pretence, and all are occupied in yll workes: In ſuche wyſe that ſome by auarice leſe their good fame, and ſome prodigally ſpende and waſte all theyr goodes. What ſhulde I ſay more? In the courte euery daye the lordes chaunge and after the lawes, awake ſtryfes, and reyſe noyſes, abate noblenes, exalte the vnworthy, banyſſhe innocētes, and honour theues, loue flatterers, and diſpraiſe theym the whiche be vertuous, they embrace delites, and treade vertue vnder their fete: they wepe for them that be ylle, and laughe to ſcorne theym that be good, and finally

ly they take all lyghtnes for theyr mother, and vertue for theyr ſtepmother. And my ſonne I ſay more vnto the, The courte, the whiche thou ſhalt enherite this day, is nothing but a ſhoppe with waares, and a howſe of va
                  •
               aboundes, wherin ſomme ſelle vyle and corrupte thynges, and other byelyes, ſome haue credence, and ſomme haue renoume, ſomme haue goodes, and ſome haue lyuynge, and all togyther is but loſſe of tyme: and that worſte of all is, they wyll not beleue the poyſon therof, tyll it be at theyr hartis, they are ſo foolyſhe and ſturdy. Rome hath very hye walles, and the vertues is very lowe: Rome vaunteth it ſelfe to be very ſtronge in nombre of inhabitauntes, and afterwarde Rome ſhal wepe that there is more people than vertue, and vyces are not accompted. In a monethe a manne might recken all the ſtones of the proude edifyces, but in a. M. yeres he myght not compriſe the malyces of his yll cuſtomes. I ſwere to the by the immortall goddis, that in thre yeres I repaired all that was decayed in Rome, and in thirty yere I coude not refourme one quarter therof to good lyuynge. Good ſonne beleue me, the great cities full of good inhabitauntes oughte to be prayſed, and not the great edifices. Our predeceſſours haue triūphed on ſtrangers as weake and feeble: and nowe they may triumphe on vs alſo, as menne that be more vanquyſſhed with vyces than any of the other. By the myghtynes and proweſſes of our predeceſſours, we that be nowe, are greattely honoured and exalted: and by the ſmalle eſtimation of vs that be now, they that come after vs ſhall be greatly aſhamed. Of a very trouthe it is a great ſhame to ſaye, and no leſſe infamy to doo, that the goodneſſe and trauayle of the auncientes ſhuld nowe be tourned and conuerted to folies and preſumption. My ſonne loke wel on thy ſelfe, that the reyne of thy youthe, and lybertie of the empire cauſe the

nor to commytte vyce. He is not called onely free, that is free borne, but he that dieth within the ſame. O how well are the ſclaues borne, that after their deth are free by their goodnes? &amp; howe many haue died ſclaues by their noughtynes, that were borne free? There is fredome where noblenes abydeth. The prowes of thy perſone ſhal gyue the more hardines and libertie than thauctoritie of thempire. It is a generall rule, that euery vertuous man of neceſſitie is to be holden hardye: and euery vicious man of neceſſitie is to be reputed a cowarde. Nowe boldely they be chaſtiſed that be noted with any vice, and coldely they be chaſtiſed that deſerue chaſtiſement. Let the prince be in a certayn, that the loue of his people, and the lybertie of his offyce, hath not wherwith to vpholde hym in armes ſpred abrode on the erth, without the dyuers vertues aſſembled in his perſon.
            ¶Certaynly Octauius Ceſar ſubdewed mo nations by the renoume of his vertues, than dydde Gaius his vncle with his army of many men. All the worlde ioy of a vertuous prince: and it ſemeth that al the world ryſeth ageinſt a vicious prince. Vertue is a ſtrong caſtell, and can neuer be wonne: it is a riuer where nedeth no rowing, a ſee that moueth not, a fire that quencheth not, a treaſure that neuer hath ende, an army neuer ouercome, a burden that neuer werieth, a ſpie that euer retourneth, a ſygne that neuer deceyueth, a playne waye that neuer fayleth, a ſyrope that healeth forthwith: and a renoume that neuer peryſſheth. O my ſonne, if thou kneweſt what thyng it is to be good, and what a man thou ſhuldeſt be if thou were vertuous, thou woldeſt doo ſeruyce to the goddes, good renoume to thy ſelfe, pleaſure to thy frendes, and engender loue of ſtraungers, and finally all the worlde ſhulde feare and loue the.
            
               I remembre, that in the boke of yeres, of the battayle of Tarentyne, I founde, that the renoumed Pyrrhus, king of the Epyrothiens, bare in a rynge grauen theſe wordes: To a vertuous man, is but a ſmalle rewarde, to be lorde of all the erthe: and it is but a ſmall chaſtiſement to take a vicious mans lyfe fro hym.
            ¶Truly it was a worthy ſentence of ſuch a prince. What thinge is it, be it neuer ſo difficile, begonne by a vertuous man, but there is hope to haue a good ende therof. Sothly I haue ſene in dyuers parties of myn empyre, dyuers men very darke of good fame, very lowe in goodes, and vnknowen of their kynne and bloud: vndertake ſo great thynges, that to my ſemyng, it was a feareful audacitie to begynne: And yet by the wynges of vertue all onely they haue had good renoume at the laſt. By the immortal goddis, and as the god Iupiter bryng me in his mancion, and ſtablyſhe the, in all that is myne. There were ones, a gardyner and a potter, dwellynge in Rome, whyche only by their vertues, cauſed to put tenne vycious ſenatours out of the ſenate, and the fyrſte occaſyon was, for makynge a hedge of thorne, and a potte, for the workemanſhyp and labour whereof, the Senatours wolde not paye theym. I tell it the my ſonne, bycauſe that vyce maketh a bolde perſonne thoughtefulle, and vertue cauſeth hym, that is in thought, to take ſtrengthe and boldenes. I was wel ware of two thinges in my lyfe, not to pleade agaynſt the clerenes of iuſtyce, nor to take part ageynſt a vertuous perſon: For with vertue god ſuſteyneth vs, and with Iuſtyce the people are well gouerned and ruled.
         
         
            ¶Of other more partycular counſaylles, gyuen by the emperour to his ſonne. Cap. xlvi.
            
               
               NOwe to come to thinges more particular. Seinge ſonne, that thou arte yonge, and that nature can not denye the: And as in all dyfficile thinges, ripe counſelle is neceſſarie, no leſſe to comfort theſtate of our lyuing, we deſire ſome recreations. For thy youth, I leue ye with gret lordis children, with whom thou mayſt paſſe the tyme: And to teache the, I leue olde Romains, that haue nouryſhed the, &amp; ſerued me, of whom thou ſhalt take counſell. The inuention of interludes, of theatres, to fyſhe in pōdes, to hunt wilde beaſtes, to courſe in the fieldes, to hauke for byrdes, and to exerciſe dedes of armes, are the thynges that thy youthe deſyreth. And youth with youth ought to kepe companye, in doinge the ſame: But behold my ſon, that in orderyng of armies, to apply the warres, to purſue vyctories, to accepte truce, to confyrme peace, to reyſe tributes, to make lawes, to promote ſome, and diſmiſſe other, to chaſtyſe the yll, and recompence the good: in all theſe thinges, that be ſo chargeable, they that be of clere mynde, redy broken and trauayled of their bodies, &amp; whyt heared, ought to be takē to coūſel the. And ſith thou art yōge &amp; luſty of body, reioyce &amp; ſport with them that be yong: &amp; whan thou art emperor, than touching thy ſecrete affaires, take coūſel of them yt be old. Beware my ſon of all extremities. For as yll may the prince be, vnder the colour of grauitie, to be rulyd by the ancient perſones, as vnder the colour of paſtyme, to kepe cōpany with yonge folkes. It is no generall rule, that all yonge perſons ſhall alwayes be yonge and lyght, nor that all olde perſons, ſhulde be always wyſe. I am ſure of one thynge, that if the yonge man be borne with foly, the olde man lyueth and dieth with couetyſe. Therfore my ſonne beware, be not extreme in extremities. For the yonge people wyll corrupte the with their lyghtnes, and olde folkes

wil depriue thy mind with theyr couetouſnes. What thing can be more monſtrous, than a prince, that commaundeth euery man, to be commaunded of one? Sothely the gouernyng of diuers, can not be gouerned wel by the opinion of one alone. Than the prince, that gouernethe many, oughte to haue the intention and opinion of dyuers. ¶In the annales of the Pompeyens, I founde a lyttell boke of remembrance, the which great Pompeie bare alway with hym: wherin were dyuers good counſelles and aduertiſementes, the which were gyuen in diuers parties of the worlde: Amonge the whiche, I founde theſe, wordes: He that gouerneth the common welthe, and putteth the gouernance to them that are old, ſheweth hym ſelfe vnable: and he that truſteth in youthe, is lyght: and he that gouerneth by him ſelfe alone, is hardy and bolde: and he that gouerneth by him ſelfe and other, is wiſe. Theſe were notable wordes.
            ¶Than my ſonne, determin the to take counſel, and ſpecially in high thinges and matiers of difficultie, and other wiſe let them not be determyned. For whan the counſaylle is taken of dyuers, than if any faute be, it ſhal be deuided amonge them al. Thoughe the determination myghte be done by a fewe, yet take counſel of many. Amonge all thy welthes, here the common counſel. For one wyl ſhewe the al the inconuenience, an nother the peryl, an other the domage, an other the profitte, an nother the remedye. And ſette as well thyn eyes vpon the inconueniences, that they laye, as vpon the remedy, that they offre. Whan thou begynneſt any harde mattier, eſteme as wel the ſmal domages, that may befall afore, and ſtoppe them, as to remedy the gret miſfortunes, that come after. Of trouth the ſtrōg and myghty ſhyppe ofte tymes for a ſmalle takynge hede of the pylotte, is ſounken and drowned in a lyttell water:

and an other ſhyppe, not ſo ſtrong, with wiſe diligence, is ſaued in the gulfe of the ſee. Be not annoyed to take coū
               cel in ſmal matters euery houre. For many thinges forthwith require to be loked to, and in abydinge for councel, it endomageth. And that that thou canſt diſpatche by thyn owne auctoritie, without domage of the common welthe, put it not to any other perſon. For ſith thy ſeruice al onely dependeth of thyn, the rewarde dependeth of the alone. ¶In the yere .vi.C.xxx. of the foundation of Rome, after the cruell warres done ageinſt the kynge of Numedie, the day that Marius triumphed, without puttyng of any of the riches, that he brought, into the common treaſury, he deuyded it to his men of warre. And whan he was therfore accuſed, and aſked, why he toke not firſte the opinyon of the ſenate: He aunſwered and ſayde: Sythe they toke not the opinion of other, to do me ſeruice, it were no reſon, that I ſhulde take councell of other, to rewarde and recō
               pence them.
            ¶Son, yet I wil aduertiſe of other thinges. Peraduenture ſome wyll gyue the counſell, er thou demaund it: In that caſe kepe this general rule: neuer abide the ſecond counſell of a man, if he haue giuen the counſell before in the preiudice of an other. For he offreth his wordes in thy ſeruice, to bringe the beſynes to his owne profyte. O my ſonne, there are many thinges to knowe a man. Xv, yere I haue ben ſenatour, conſule, cenſure, capitaine, and tribune: and .xviii. yeres I haue ben emperour of Rome, and diuers haue ſpoken to me, in preiudice of other, and many mo, for their own profite, and none haue ſpoken clerely to me, for the profite of other, nor for my ſeruice. Great compaſſion oughte to be taken of princis: for euery man foloweth them for theyr owne profite, &amp; none for loue and ſeruice. One counſell I toke for my ſelfe, all the whyle that

I haue gouerned Rome: I neuer kepte man in my houſe, after that I knewe hym hatefull agaynſte the common welthe.
            ¶In the yere of the foundation of Rome .vi.C.lix. of the Olympiade .C.lxviii. Lucullus Patricien, greate frende to Sylla, goynge to the warre of Methridates, It chaunced, that in Tygoano, a citie of Caldiens, he found a plate of coper or braſſe, vpon the kinges gatis, wherin were certayne lytters, whiche they ſayde were grauen there by the commandement of Alexander the great: The letters were in Caldee, conteynyng theſe ſentences, That prince is not wyſe, that wyll holde his lyfe in peryll, and wil not aſſure his lyfe and ſtate with the loue of all men: That prince is not vertuous, that in giuinge moche to one perſon, wylleth all other to haue but lyttell: That prince is not iuſte, that wyll ſatysfie more the couetiſe of one perſon, than the voices of all men: That prince is a fole, that diſpyſeth the councell of all other, and truſteth all onely vpon the opinion of one: And finally that prince is to bolde and hardye▪ that for the loue of one, wil be hated of all other. ¶Theſe were wordes of eternall memorye. And in dede theſe princis, ſhulde haue this always in theyr preſence. Sonne yet I ſhal ſay more to the. This Lucullus Patriciens brought into the Senate, al the treſure that he had, and this plate, with the ſayd wordes theron, to thentente that they ſhulde chuſe the one, and leaue the other. And the ſenate refuſed all the treaſure, and toke the counſelles written theron.
         
         
            ¶Of dyuers and partycular recommendations, whiche the emperour commaunded his ſonne. Cap. xlvii.
            
               
               I Haue ſhewed, lyke a father, the thynge that toucheth thy welth: Nowe I wyll ſhew the, what thou oughteſt to do after my death, for my ſeruice. Thoſe thynges, that I haue loued in my lyfe, if thou wilte be ſonne to thy father, eſteme them after my dethe. Fyrſte my ſonne I recommende to the, the worſhyppynge of the temples, and the reuerence of the prieſtes, with the honour to the goddis. So longe ſhall the honour of the Romayns laſte, as they perſeuer in the ſeruice of the goddis. The realme of the Carthaginens periſhed not, bycauſe they were not ſoo riche, or more cowardes than the Romayns: but bycauſe they loued their treſors to moch, and were but yll worſhippers and louers of the temples. My ſonne, I recommend to the Helia, thy ſtepmother, &amp; remembre, that though ſhe be not thyn owne mother, yet ſhe is my wyfe: and on the peyne of my curſyng, ſuffre not, that ſhe be yl intreted. For the domage that ſhe ſhuld ſuffre by thy cōſent, ſhuld gyue euidence of the ſmal thought, that thou takeſt of my deth, which ſhulde be an iniury to thy life. I haue left to her the tributes and reuenues of Noſtie, for to maynteine her degre: and the gardens of Vulcan, which I cauſed to make for her recreatiō. And if thou take it fro her, thou ſhe weſte thyne ylneſſe. And to ſuffer her to enioy it, I commaunde the by thyne obedience, and to ſhewe her thy bountie and largeſſe. Remembre, ſhe is a Romain, yong, and a widow, of the houſe of my lorde Traian, and howe ſhe is thy mother adoptife, &amp; my naturall wyfe: wherfore I leue her vnder thy recōmendation. Alſo I cōmyt to the, thy breterne in law: &amp; thy ſiſters, my doughters. I leue them al maried not to ſtraunge kynges, but to the natural inhabitauntes and citeſens of Rome. They dwel all within the walles of Rome, where as they may do the ſeruice, and thou mayſt

do thē good. Son, intrete them in ſuche wiſe, that though their good father be deade, yet let them haue fauour. And though they ſe their brother emperour of Rome, yet let thē not be defouled. Womē be of a ryght tender cōdition, they wyll complayne for a ſmalle cauſe, and for leſſe they wylle ryſe vp in pride, thou oughteſt to conſerue theym after my deth, as I haue done in my lyfe. For otherwiſe their conuerſation ſhulde be fekyll to the people, and importunate to the. Alſo I cōmit to the, Lipula thy ſiſter, that is amōge the virgins Veſtales. Thinke, that ſhe is doughter of thy mother Fauſtin, whiche I haue greatly loued in my lyfe, &amp; vnto the houre of my death, I haue lamented hers. Euery yere I gaue to thy ſiſter .ii.M. ſexters, for her neceſſities: ſhe had ben as well maried as the other, yf ſhe had not be brent in the vyſage: whiche was eſtemed of euery man an yl aduenture, and ſpecially of her moder, that wept alway for her. But I eſteme that yll aduenture, a good fortune. For if ſhe had not ben brent in the face with fire, ſhe had in the worlde, as touchyng her renome, be brent with diuers tonges. Son, I ſwere to the, that for the ſeruice of the goddes, &amp; the fame of men, ſhe is more ſurer with the virgins in the temple, than though ſhe were in the ſenate, with the ſenatours. I deme, that at the ende of the iourney, ſhe ſhal finde her ſelf better at eaſe, cloſed and locked in, than thou with all thy libertie. In the prouynce of Lucany, I haue lefte for her, the .ii.M. ſexters: I wyll not, that thou take them fro her. Alſo I cōmytte Druſia the wyddowe to the, which hath layd a great proces againſt the ſenate, bycauſe yt by motions afore paſſed, her huſbande was baniſhed: I haue great compaſſion of her: for it is thre monthes, ſythe ſhe put, in her demande, and bycauſe of my great warres. I coude not declare her iuſtyce. Sonne, thou ſhalte fynde it trewe, that in .xxxv. yere, that I haue gouerned Rome,

there was neuer wydow, that helde her proceſſe before me, paſſynge .viii. dayes. Take compaſſion of ſuche. For womennes neceſſities are right peryllous, and at the laſte, yf their beſynes be longe in hande, they recouer not ſo moche of theyr goodes, as they leſe in their renowme. Alſo haue compaſſyon of poore men, and the goddis ſhall rewarde the, with great ryches. Alſo I commytte to the, my auncient ſeruantes, to whom my longe yeres and cruel warres, my often neceſſities, the diſpleaſure of my bodye, and my longe ſyckeneſſes, hath ben right paynefull. For they, as true ſeruantes, to gyue me lyfe, haue taken peyn vnto the deth. It is reaſon, that ſyth I haue taken their deth, that they inherite parte of my lyfe. One thing I holde for certayne, In caſe that my bodye abyde in the ſepulchre with wormes, yet I ſhall alwayes, before the goddis haue remembraunce of them. In this doinge, thou ſhalt do as a good chylde, to ſatiſfie them, that haue ſerued thy father. Take hede my ſon, euery prince, doinge Iuſtice, acquireth ennemies in the execution therof. And this is done by thē, that are mooſte nere to hym. For the more priuie they are with the prince, the more hatefull they are to the people. And though euery mā loueth Iuſtice in generall, yet they all hate the execution therof in particular. Whan a iuſte prince is deade, the people take vengeance of the vniuſte ſeruantes. Whan thou were a chylde, my ſeruantis noryſhed the, to the entent, that thou ſhuldeſt ſuſteyne them in their age. Surely, it were great ſhame to the empire, an offence to the goddis, an iniurie to me, and an vngentylnes of the▪ that thou haſt foūde them .xviii. yeres, with their armes abrode to halſe the, that they ſhulde finde one day thy gates ſhet ageinſt them. Theſe thinges I cōmit to the particularly, kepe them alway in memory. And ſith I remembre them at my deth, cōſider how I loued them in my life.
         
         
            
            ¶Of the laſt wordes that themperour ſpake to his ſonne and of a table that he gaue hym. Cap. xlviii.
            
               WHan the emperour had ended his ſaid recommendations, the daye began to ſprynge, and his eye ſtringes began to breke, and his tonge faultred, and his handes ſhoke. Than the ſaid happy emperour, felynge that weakenes began ſore to drawe aboute his harte, he commaunded Panutius to go into his ſtudy, and to brynge to hym a coffre that was there. And whan it was brought to his preſence, he opened it, and toke out a table of thre fote broode, and two fote longe, it was of wood Lybanus, &amp; rounde about garniſhed with vnycorne. It was cloſed with two leaues, ſubtylly wroughte of a red wood, that ſome ſayde was of the tree that the Phenyx bredeth in: and is called Raſyn. And as there is but one byrde Phenix bredyng in Arabie: ſo lykewiſe there is no mo trees in the worlde of the ſame kynde. On one of the outwarde parties of the table was pyctured &amp; grauen the god Iupiter: on the other the goddeſſe Venus: In the inwarde partyes of the Table that ſhette, was pictured god Mars, and the goddeſſe Ceres: In the principall of the ſayd table was pyctured a Bulle ſubtylly wrought to the quycke, and vnder that a kynge was pyctured. The whiche payntures were ſayde to be of the handy warke of the expert Appelles an ancient worke man in payntynge. Than the emperour toke the table in his hande, and with great peyne, he ſayd: Thou ſeeſt my ſonne Comodus, how I am al redy ſcaped from the trappes of fortune, and am enterynge into the heuy aduentures of dethe. I wote not why the goddis haue created vs, ſyth there is ſo great annoyance in our lyfe, &amp; ſo great perylle at our deathe. I vnderſtande not why the goddis

haue and vſe ſo great crueltie to the creatures .Lxii. yere I haue ſayled with great trauayle through the great perylles of this lyfe: and at this howre I am commaunded to take lande and diſcharge me of my fleſſhe, and to take erthe in the ſepulchre. Nowe vntyeth the lyuely thredes, nowe vndothe the ſpyndel, nowe ryueth the webbe, nowe endeth my lyfe. Nowe am I awaked from the ſlepynge euyll: remembrynge howe I haue paſſed my lyfe, I haue no more deſyre to lyue. And in that I knowe not whyche way to go, I refuſe dethe. What ſhall I do? I am determyned to put me into the handes of the goddis wyllyngly, ſythe I muſte do ſo of neceſſitie. Whome I require, yf they haue created me for any goodnes, not to depriue me fro them for my demerytes. I am nowe in the laſte gate: and to this howre I haue kepte the greatteſt and moſt excellent iewell that I coude fynde in all my lyfe. In the .x. yere of myn empire there aroſe a warre agaynſt the Parthes: wherfore I determyned in myne own perſon to giue theym battayle. After that warre I came by the auncient citie of Thebes, for to ſee ſomme antiquitie. Amonge the whiche in a priſtes howſe I founde this table, the whiche as a kynge was reyſed in Egypte, incontynente it was euer hanged at his beddes heed, and this prieſt ſhewed me, that it was made by a kynge in Egipte named Ptholome Arſacides, that was a vertuous prince. And in the memorie of him, and example of other, the prieſtes kepte it dilygently. And ſonne I haue kepte it alway with me: and I beſeche the goddis, that ſuch may be thy warkes, as therin thou mayſt fynde good counſell. As emperour I leaue the heyre of many countreys and realmes: and as thy father I doo gyue vnto the this table of counſayles. Lette this be the laſte worde, that with the empyre thou ſhalt be feared, and by this table thou ſhalte be beloued.

This ſayd, and the table delyuered to his ſonne, the emperour turned his eyen, and within a quarter of an houre he yelded the ſpirite.
            ¶Nowe to retourne to the ſayd table and writing. There was written betwene the bulle and the kynge a ſcrowe in Greke letters, in maner of heroicall verſes, conteynynge in our vulgar tonge thus: I neuer choſe ryche tirant, nor abhorred the poore iuſt man. I neuer denyed Iuſtice to a poore man for his pouertie, nor pardoned a ryche man for his great goodes and rycheſſe: I neuer dyd good deedes, nor neuer gaue hyre for affection, nor gaue correction onely for the peyne: I neuer left ylnes vnchaſtiſed, nor goodnes without reward: I neuer commytted an other to doo Iuſtice that was clere, nor darke iuſtice I neuer determined by my ſelfe alone: I dydde neuer deny iuſtice to them that demaunded it, nor mercy vnto hym that deſerued it: I neuer dydde correction for angre, nor promyſed any rewarde in my myrth: I was neuer charged with thoughtes in my proſperitie, nor diſpayred in myne aduerſitie: I neuer committed yl by malic, enor any villany for auarice: I neuer opened my gates to flatterars nor dyſſemblers, nor lyſtened myne eares to murmurers: I haue laboured always to be loued of them that be good, and to be dread and fered of them that be yll: And fynally I haue fauoured the poore, that myght do but lyttell, and haue be fauored of the goddis that may do moche.
            ¶Hytherto is ſhewed brefely the worthy and laudable lyfe of the emperour Marcus Aurelius, and of his deathe.

            ¶A letter ſente by Marcus Aurelius to Pyramon his ſpciall frende. Capitu. xlix.
            
               ¶The fyrſte letter.
               
                  MArke oratour Romayn, borne at mount Celio to Pyramon of Lyon, my greatte frende, deſiringe ſalutation to thy perſon, and ſtrength and vertu againſt thy ſiniſter fortune. In the thyrde Kalendes of Ianuarie I receiued thy letter, wherby I perceyue thou haſt receiued one of myn. I ſet ſmall ſtore by thy wordes, but I eſteme greatly what thou meaneſt by them. So that without declarynge therof I haue gadred the ſentence. Reaſon wolde bycauſe I haue written ſo often to the, that thou ſhuldeſt the better vnderſtande me: but thou arte ſo ſlouthfull, that though I call the, thou wylt not here: nor thoughe I ſtryke the, thou wylte not feele. But nowe to comme to the purpoſe. Thou knoweſt well Piramon, howe nere we be in parentage, auncient in frendeſhyppe, ſtedfaſte in loue, and tender of hartes: and whan ſo euer thou putte it in experyence, than one true frende ſhall proue an other. Thou remembreſt wel, when we were at Rodes, that we dwelled togyther in one houſe, and dyd eate at one table, and all that thou thoughteſt I dyd it in effecte: and that I ſayd, thou neuer gaynſaydeſt. Certaynly thou were in my hart, and I in thyne entrayles: I was thyne, and thou were myne. We beinge together, hit ſemed to all other that we were but one, and of one wyll. What is it my frende Piramon? Thou writeſt howe thou arte heuy, and yet thou doeſt not ſhewe the cauſe why: thou complayneſt yt thou art almoſt deed, and thou ſheweſt me not who taketh thy life fro the. If thou wilt not ſhewe to my thyn yll deſtenies, ſith thou

arte my frende, I wyll thou knowe, that I demaunde it of right. If thou wylte not, I wyl that thou knowe, that ye pitiefull goddes haue determined, that all pleaſures and profyte ſhall departe from my houſe: and that all heuines and domages ſhall be regiſtred in my perſonne. Sithe I am prince of al honour, being in tribulation, yf thou woldeſte, thou canſte not eſcape out of my ſeignourie. For if thou complayne, that thou arte vnhappy in fortune, than I eſteme my ſelfe to be happy in vnhappynes. I demand one thynge of the. Whan haſte thou ſene me haue ſufficiente, and thou nede? Whan haſte thou ſene me ſlepe, and thou wake? and whan haſte thou trauayled, and I reſted? Of trouthe ſithe the goodes and perſones are theyr owne propre, the trauayles and yl aduentures are always common. One thynge thou oughteſt to knowe, if in myne amitie thou wylte perſeuer, that all my goodes are thyne, and all thyn euylles are myn, ſyth thou arte borne to lyue eaſyly, and to be gentilly ordered and intreated, and I do lyue for to trauayle. I ſay not this faynyngely: for thou haſte hadde experience of me, that whan Iamaria thy ſyſter dyed, that was no leſſe vertuous than fayre, thou ſaweſt wel whan ſhe was buried deed, I was buried quick: and at the ſowne of my teares thin eies daunced. Sythe thou holdeſt ſuche ſureties of my perſon, ſurely thou maiſt diſcouer to me thy peyne. Yet as often as I haue demanded it, there hath not fayned reaſons fayled in the. I require the, and deſyre the agayne, and in the name of the goddes I pray the, and in theyr names I coniure the, that thou diſpoſe all thy ſorowes into myn entrayles. For the way that thou goeſte, I wyll not leaue one pace to go fro the ſame: if thou go, I wyll go: if thou reſte, I wyll reſte: yf thou worke, I wyll worke: if thou leue of, I wyll doo the ſame: if thou wylt dye, thou knoweſt well, I wyll not

lyue. Regarde frende what thou wylt do. For thyne euyls and myne, tormente bothe one harte. If thou haue diſpleſure, all thynges diſpleaſe me: if thou wepe, I ſwere fro hensforthe neuer to laughe: if thou diſcharge the of thy peyne, fro hensforth I ſhall take it for myne: if thou go alone, I wil forſake company, and forth with lyue ſolytarily. What wylt thou that I ſhuld deſyre? For al that euer thou wylt I wyll. Thou complayneſt, that in all thy trauayles thou canſt fynd no parent to remedy the, nor frend to counſel the. I ſwere to the my frende Pyramon, that of theſe two thinges I haue as moche pouertie in my howſe as thou haſt ſorow in thyn. I knowe wel the remedy ſhuld come by ryches, and by councell, and conſolation of them that be wiſe. And by reaſon of my heuy deſtenies, ſlouthe hath taken fro me the knowlege of wiſedome: and fortune wyll not permytte me to haue great riches. Certaynely I wepe for thy myſerie, and yet there is but ſmalle remedy in me. Thou ſayeſte in thy letter, that thy neyghbours and frendes in promyſynge haue behighte the many thynges: but in giuynge they do nothyng. Hereof I meruaylle: for the vertuous hand is not bound to make the tonge a fole. Truly though our fete daunce, our handes ſhulde werke at the ſowne of the tonge: our lyfe endethe in fewe dayes, and our renoume in fewer. Promys is an aunciēt cuſtome among the ſonnes of vanite, and of cuſtome the tonge ſpeketh haſtily, and the handes worke at leyſure. Nowe lette vs ſpeake more particularly.
               ¶Thou oughteſt not to complayne, in that thou fyndeſt not but in a fewe, that dyuers haue founde in the alone. Cuſtome is to receyue forthwith and meryly, and to gyue ſlowelye with ylle wylle and repentaunce. They that be preſumptuous do the one, and they whiche be ſloutheful, do the other. The Grekes ſaye: that he that promyſethe

and is longe in fulfyllyng, is but a ſlacke frende. We Romayns ſay, that he is moch better that denieth forthwith, bycauſe he wyll not begyle hym that aſketh. In this caſe I ſay, He that may gyue and gyueth not, is a clere ennemy: and he that promiſeth forthewith, and is longe or he do it, is but a ſuſpecious frende. What nede wordis to our frēdes, whā we may ſuccour them with workes? Is it not right, to whom we gyue our hartis, which is ye beſt thinge within vs, that we giue him our tongue, that is the worſte thinge of all our vyces? In good ſothe the goddis wylle not ſuffre in the place of amitie, to deſire any thyng of our frende in haſt, &amp; to be driuen it of with long delaying. Plato in his lawes ſayth, We commande, that in our gouernynge, that polytike counſayle be gyuen to them, that be in proſperitie, to thentent that they decay not: and to ſuccour them that be in heuines and trouble, to thentent that they deſpaire not. Certainly vnder theſe wordes are compriſed dyuers great ſentences. Thou knoweſt wel my frēd Piramon, that ſwete wordes cōfort the hart but lytle that is in tribulation, but if there be ſome good workes therwith. I wyl nat deny, but that they, to whom we haue giuen oure good wylles in the tyme of our proſperytie, be bounde to gyue vs of their goodes, &amp; to ſhewe vs fauour in our aduerſitie. I demande one thing of the, Wherfore holdeſt thou a preſumptuous lycence to demaunde? And reproueſt on the other part the lybertie of denieng. Truly as there is ſhame in the demanding, there is obligation in ſome thyng to deny: an importunate man is not worthy to haue mercy. Thou mayſt knowe, if thou knowe it not my frēd Piramō, that to attayn to euery thing yt is demāded, belongeth only to the goddis. To giue al thing that is demāded is no ſigne of any ſeruāt. And to deny any thing is of liberte. To wepe for yt is denied is the cōditiō of tirātis.

And to conne no thanke for that is gyuen, is the condition of the Barbaryens: and to haue euer a ſtedfaſte hoope of that is denyed, is the guyſe of the Romaynes. One of theſe thinges, wherein Gayus Ceſar ſhewed hym ſelfe to be of high courage was, that he had moſte greatteſt ioye whan the ſenate refuſed any thynge deſyred by hym. Oftentymes he ſayde: There is nothynge wherin Rome gyueth me more glorye and renowme to my perſone, thanne whan I ſhewe my ſelfe moſte haſty to demaunde, and they moſte ſtyffe to denye me: to thentent that after they ſhuld knowe, what is my power to abyde, and howe lyttel theyr ſtrength is to reſiſt. Me thynk it is better to haue recours to the goddis with vertues, than to diſpleaſe theym with quarelles. And to gyue contentation to thy repoſed wyll, whan thou ſeeſt thy ſelfe in tribulation: and that thou demaundeſt of the goddis and of men to be fruſtrate, thou oughteſt to meaſure it with a ryght meaſure, and to payſe it in a ryght balaunce, the great quantitie that hath bene gyuen to the, and the lyttell quantitie that hath be graunted the. O howe vncourteyſe be we to the goddis, and of ſmall remembraunce to men, whan we myniſhe with forgetfulnes, that we haue receyued of them: and that lytle that hath ben refuſed vs, we augment it with complayntes? Frende Pyramon, I am begyled if thou be not fyftye yeres of age, and all that ſeaſon thou haſte done nothyng but receyued gyftes: and yet for al that, I haue nat ſeene the do one day of ſeruice. Certaynly it is no reſon to complayne of .viii. dayes of yll fortune, beynge fyfty yeres of age. Thou ſayeſt in thy letter, howe thou haſt moch pein, bycauſe thou knoweſt all thy neyghbours to be enuyous. In good ſoth I haue peyne for thy peyne, and of thy meruaylyng I haue great meruayle. For all admiration procedethe but by ſurmountynge of ignorance, and faulte of

experience. Doth the quicke vnderſtandynge of men rule the lyfe of thē that be mortall, that they nede not to thinke of the trauayle to come, hauynge in theyr handes haſty remedy? If they be hungry, they maye eate: whan they are colde, they may warme theym: if they be ſlepy, they maye ſlepe: whan they be wery, they maye reſt: When they are ſycke, they may be healed: whan they are heuye, they maye reioyce, in ſuche maner, that the thoughtfull lyfe paſſeth, ſome to make tiltes and lyſtes, ſome to make armure and ſcaffoldes, ſome to inuente newe gynnes, and ſome to repayre bulwarkes. I ſay the world and the fleſh do nought els but fyghte ageynſt vs, and we haue nede at all tymes to defende vs fro them. All theſe remedyes are ageynſt the trauayle of the fleſhe. But what ſhall we do, that the curſednes of enuy extende not amonge all theſe? Curſed is that welthe, that euery man enuieth. Certaynly agaynſte enuy is no fortreſſe to defend, nor caue to hyde, nor hye hil to mount on, nor thycke wodde to ſhadowe in, nor ſhyppe to ſcape in, nor horſe to beare away, nor money to redeme vs. Enuy is ſo venomous a ſerpent, that there was neuer mortall man amonge mortalles, that coulde ſcape fro the bytynge of her tothe, and ſcratchynge of her nayles, foylynge of her fete, and poiſonynge of her poyſon. I ſwere to the my frende Pyramon, that ſuch as fortune lifteth vp with great ryches, ſhe full of crueltie gyueth theym profounde bytynges. Enuie is ſo enuious, that to them, that of her are mooſte denyed, and ſette fardeſt of, ſhe gyuethe moſte cruell ſtrokes with her fete. This vnhappye enuye prepareth poyſon ſecretely fro them that be in reſt among dyuers pleaſures.
               ¶I haue redde dyuers bookes of Hebrewe, Greke, Latyn, and Caldee: And alſo I haue ſpoken with many very wiſe men, to ſe if there might be foūde any remedy ageinſt

an enuious man. I confeſſe the truth: Rede all that can be redde, and imagine al that can be, demaunde all that can be demaunded, and ye ſhall fynde none other cure ageinſt this curſed enuie, but to banyſhe vs fro all proſperitie, and to ſytte with aduerſe fortune. O howe vnhappy ar they that be in proſperitie: for iuſtely they that be ſette vp in hygh eſtate, can not flee from the perille of Scilla, without fallynge into Charibdis. They can not ſcape the peryll, without caſtinge their treaſures into the ſee. I ſay that the malady of enuy wyll not ſuffre theym to ſcape fro dethe, and the medicine that is applyed to them, wyll not aſſure their lyfe. I can not determine me, whiche is the beſte, or to ſaye more properly the worſte, extreme myſerie without the danger of fortune, or extreme proſperitie, that is always thretened to falle. In this caſe to be ſo extreme I wyl not determin me, ſith in the one is a perillous lyfe, and in the other renoume is ſure.
               ¶I ſhall tell the, what wiſe Cicero ſayde, whan he was purſued with many at Rome: Beholde you Romaines, I holde you not for ſo good, nor my ſelfe ſo ylle, to ſaye the trouth always, nor always to make lyes. I am certayne, that ye bere me none enuie, for that I am not as ye be, but it is bycauſe ye can not be as I am. In this caſe I had rather that my ennemies had enuye at my proſperitie, than my frendes at my pouertie.
               ¶This oratour ſpake after the appetite of them that be in proſperitie, leuynge to gyue remedy to them that be ſorowfull. And after this Cicero had ſene the feldes of Farſalye, he toke other councell and remedy, ſuche as pleaſed hym in Rome. For if Ceſar had granted him his goodes, yet yt turned not his credence and renoume. Surely frend Pyramō I know no remedy to gyue the ageinſt enuy, ſith thou ſeeſt al the world ful therof, we ſe how we be the ſons

of enuy, and we liue with enuy, &amp; die with enuy: &amp; he that leueth moſt ryches, leaueth the greateſt enuy. The ancient wiſe men coūſailed rich men, that they ſhuld not haue pore folkes nere them: and they admoniſhed the pore, that they ſhuld nat dwell nere to the rych. And truly it is good reaſon. For the richeſſe of riche men is the ſede of enuy to the poore. And bycauſe the pore mā lacketh and the riche hath to moche, cauſeth diſcorde among the people. I ſwere by ye goddis immortal, frēde Pyramon, though they that be yl wolde that I ſhuld ſwere falſely, as moche as riches with thought noriſheth couetiſe, ſo moch the enuious noriſheth enuy therby. I tell the one thynge, and that is, that it is no good counſell to flee enuy, and to auoyde the vertu cō
                  trarye to the ſame. Homer ſaithe, yt in his tyme there were two Grekes extreme in all extremities: The one was extreme in riches, &amp; therfore he was ꝑſecuted by enuy, &amp; that was Achilles: &amp; the other was ſore noted of malice, but no man had enuy at hym, and that was Thieſtes. Certaynly I had leuer be Achilles with his enuy, thā Thieſtes without it. Thou knoweſt well, that we Romaynes ſerche not but for reſte in our lyfe, and for honour after deathe. And ſithe it is ſo, it is not poſſible but the man that euery man enuieth his renoume, ought to be exalted in the reſt of his lyfe. And ſithe I ſee theſe two thynges in the, ſuche as be thy frendes taketh lyttell thought, for that thyn ennemies murmure ageinſte the. Thou wryteſt to me, howe they of Lyons doo well, and are mery, excepte thy ſelfe, that arte heuy, and full of penſyueneſſe. And ſith they ſhewe not to haue pleaſure at thy diſpleaſure, ſhewe not thy ſelfe dyſpleaſed with their pleaſure. For it maye chaunce one day they ſhall be ſorowfull, whan that thou art merye: Than thou ſhalt be quite with them. In an euyll perſone there can be no greatter yll, nor in a good man a greatter faute,

than to be diſpleaſed with an other mans welthe, and to take pleaſure at an other mans harme. And in caſe that al do vs domage with enuy, yet moche more a frende, than the enemy. For of myn enmy I wyl beware, and for feare he wyll withdrawe: but a frende with his amitie may begyle me, and I by my fidelitie ſhal not perceyue. Amonge all mortall ennemies there is none wors than a frend that is enuyous of my felicitie. Pyramon my frende, I wylle conclude, if thou wylt withdrawe thy ſelfe fro ennemies, than kepe company with thyn owne familiar frendes. I wote not what to write more to the, but with all my harte I lamente thy heuyneſſe. Thou knoweſt howe thy nyece Bruſia was ſlayne with a dagger by her owne huſbande. I had great compaſſion for her deth, and for the renoume that ſhe lefte behynde her. Flauius Priſcus thyn vncle is newely made Cenſure. The proceſſe betwene thy brother Fornion and Britio is determyned by the ſenate, and hit pleaſeth me ryghte well, that they be frendes, and euerye man well content. The boke intytuled the conſolation of heuynes I haue ended, and layde it in the capitol. I haue writen it in Greke, and that is the cauſe that I ſent it not to the. But I do ſende the a ryche ſwerde, and a fayre gyrdell. Fauſtine my wyfe dothe ſalute the, and ſendethe thy wyfe two ſclaues. The goddis be my kepers, and comfort the in thy preſent heuyneſſe. Marke the man fortunate, to Pyramon ſore diſcomforted.
            
            
               ¶A letter ſent by Marcus the emperour to Cornelius of the trauayle of warre, and vanitie of triumph. ¶The ſeconde Letter.
               
                  
                  MArcke emperour of Rome to the Cornelius my faythfulle frende, ſalutation to thy perſon, and good fortune to thy deſired lyfe. As thou in tyme paſſed, haſte bene partener of my trauayles, I haue ſente to calle the to gyue the pleaſure of my tryumphes. By the haboundance of rycheſſe, diuerſitie of captiues, fierſnes of capitayns that we haue brought to Rome, thou mayſt perceyue what peryls we haue ſuffred in this warre. The parthes are good men of warre: &amp; as euery man findeth in their own lande defendeth their houſes with ſtronge hart: and ſurely they do lyke good men. For without reaſon we dye of affection to take other mens goodes: &amp; they with reaſon do labour to defende that is their owne. Lette no man take enuy at the Romayn capitayn, for any triumph that is gyuen him by his mother Rome: For one day of honour, he is a. M. dayes in diſpaire of his lyfe. I wylle not ſpeake that I myght ſay of them that be in warre, and dwell in Rome, &amp; ben cruell iuges of their owne fame. And ſith that the ꝓpre renome of a man lyeth in other folkes tonges, it is not ſayde bycauſe his perſone hath meryted, but bycauſe that they doo ſhewe theyr enuye. But our foolyſhenes is ſo folyſhe, and the reputation of men ſoo vayne, that for one vayne worde, more than for our profytte, we put our lyfe in daunger, and lay our honour to gauge with trauayle, rather than to lyue, and to aſſure our renoume with reſte. I ſwere by the goddis immortall, that the daye of my tryumph being in the chariot, I was as penſiue as I myght be. O Rome curſed be thy foly, &amp; wo be to hym that hath brought vp in the ſoo moche pride. And curſed be he that hath inuented ſo great pompe in the. What greatter or more vnegall lyghtnes can be, than that a Romayne capitayn,

bicauſe he hath conquered realmes, altered peaſibles, dyſtroyed cityes, caſte downe fortreſſes, robbed the poore, enriched tyrantis, ſhedde moche bloode, and made infinite wydowes, ſhoulde for recompence of all theſe domages be receyued with great triumph? Where haſt thou ſene a greter foly? Infinite nombre is diſtroyed in warre, &amp; one alone ſhal beare away the glorie therof. And though ſuche miſerable conquerours merited not to be buried, yet whan I went through the ſtretes of Rome (I telle it as a ſecrete betwene the and me) that whanne the charyotte tryumphaunt came, and the vnhappy pryſoners charged with yrons, remembring the infinite treaſures yll gotten, and heryng the lamentations of the wydowes ſorowfully wepynge for the dethe of their huſbandes, and callynge to mynde our manyfolde frendes deed: though I reioyced me openly, I wepte droppes of bloode ſecretely. I canne not telle what perſonne taketh pleaſure in hym ſelfe of an other mannes dammage. In this caſe I prayſe not the Aſſyriens, nor I enuye not the Perſians, nor am contente with the Lacedemoniens, nor approue the Caldeens, nor content me with the Grekes. I curſe the Troyans, and condempne them of Carthage, bycauſe they folowed not the zeale of Iuſtyce, but what they dyd in their tyme was with rage of pryde, wherby they and theyr realmes were brought into ſclaunder, and was occaſion to leſe vs. O curſed Rome, curſed thou haſte ben, and curſed thou ſhalt be. For if the fatal deſtenies deceiue me not, &amp; myn vnderſtandynge fayle me not, and that fortune holde not faſte, we ſhall ſe in tyme to come, Rome ſhall be in lyke caſe as other realmes be nowe in our dayes. And where as nowe with tyranny thou arte lady ouer all ſeignouryes, it ſhall comme by Iuſtyce, that thou ſhalte tourne to be bonde to theym, that are nowe vnder thy bondage. O ylle fortunate

Rome: I ſay it bycauſe that vertue is ſo dere in the, and makeſt folye ſoo greate cheape. Peraduenture thou art more autentike than Babylon, fayrer than Hely, rycher than Carthage, ſtronger than Troye, better peopled thanne Thebes, more ſtored with ſhyppes than Corinthe, more delicious than Thyre, more inexpugnable than Aquilie, more happy than Numancy: we ſee howe they all are peryſhed, for all theyr vertues and valiant defenders, and thou hopeſt to abyde perpetually, ſtored with them yt be vicious, and peopled with ſuche as be full of vyce. O Rome, marke this for certayne, that the glorie that thou haſt at this houre, was fyrſte theyrs: and this diſtruction that nowe is theyrs, hereafter ſhall be thyn. My dere frēd Cornelius, ſhall I ſhewe the the loſſe of the Romayne people, but I can not telle it the without wepynge? I the emperour of Rome commaunde, I make decrees for the warre: if any countreye aryſe, by ſownynge of a troumpette to make menne to reyſe theyr baners, and to create newe Capytaynes. And hit is a thynge very euydente to ſee, that whan they reyſe theyr ſtanderdes, and haue leaue to make and aſſayle ennemyes, chyldren leaue theyr mothers, Studentes leaue theyr ſcholes, ſeruauntes forſake theyr mayſters, and officers theyr offyces, to the entente that vnder the colour and crafte of goynge to warre, they ſhulde not be chaſtyſed by Iuſtice. They haue noo feare of the goddes, nor reuerence to the temples, nor obedyence to theyr fathers, nor loue nor awe of the people, and loue to lyue ydylly, and hate iuſte labour, and theyr exercyſes are domageable. Somme doo robbe the churches, ſomme make qarelles and ſtryffes, and ſomme breake gates open and beare the goodes away. Sometyme they take theym that be at lybertie, and delyuer theym that ſhulde be priſoners. They paſſe the nyghtes in playes,

and the days in blaſphemes: Finally they ar vnfete to do wel: &amp; are holly diſpoſed to do yl. What ſhall I ſay of their neclygence? I am aſhamed to write it. They leaue theyr owne wyues and take other mens, They dyſhonour the daughters of honeſte men, and begyle yonge maydens, They enforce theyr hoſteſſes, and neyghbours wiues: and worſte of al, the women that do go with them, ſette theym agog that do tarye. And ſoo in this maner none of theſe women that ſo go, ſcapeth without loſſe of honour, and the other ar ſtriken with vices in theyr hartes, bicauſe they tarye. Thinke ſurely Cornelius, that the enterpriſes are ſmalle, where as women do goo to warre. Thou knoweſt, that the women Amazones haue made greatter warre in Grece, than the cruell ennemies, and not for bycauſe they had not men ynowe, but bycauſe they were ſoo many women. Pyrrhus was ouercome by Alexander, The valyant capitayne Hanyball was lorde of Italy, as long as he ſuffred no women to come in his warres. And when he was enamoured of a fayre yonge damoyſell of Capue, he was faine forthwith to turne his backe to Rome, bicauſe Rome clenſed the felde fro lecherie. For the ſame cauſe Numancie was caſte to the erthe. And I my ſelfe haue ſene in the warre of Parthes .xvii.M. horſemen .lxxx.M. fote men, and .xxxv.M. women. And our beſines went ſo, that fro our hoſte I ſent away Fauſtine my wyfe, and ſo dydde other ſenatours their wyues home to theyr houſes, to thentent that they ſhulde ſerue them that were olde, and bring vp their chyldren. That daye that a Patricion is approued by the Senate, and ledde aboute Rome by the Conſules, the egle is hanged at his breſt, and his raymente is reade, and he after ryſeth in ſuche pryde, that he remembreth not the pouertie of the tyme paſſed, but thynkethe to be emperour of Rome forthwith. Beholde than what

they do. They writh their berdes, and ruffle their heares, boyſtous their wordes, they chaunge their clothes, &amp; rolle their eien, that they may ſeme the fierſer. And finally, they loue to be feared, &amp; hate to be loued. And woteſt thou not, that they wyll be feared? On a day being at Pentapolyn, I harde a capitayne of myn, not ſeinge me, ſwere and blaſpheme, ſayinge to a woman his hoſteſſe: ye vyllaynous people, wyll not knowe the capitaynes of warre: I wyll thou knoweſt mother, that the erthe neuer trembleth, but whan it is thret of a capitayne Romayne: and god neuer cauſeth the ſonne to ſhyne, but where as we be obeyed. But nowe frende Cornelius, ſythe I haue blaſoned his vaunt, harken his vertue and worthyneſſe. I ſwere to the, that the ſayde capytayne, for al his booſte, beinge in a cruell battayle, was the firſte that fled alone fro the batayle, and lefte the ſtanderde: wherin he dydde inough, to cauſe me loſe the field. But whan it was done, I cauſed to ſtrike of his heed. It is an infallible rule, that they, that ſhewe them ſelfe moſte fierſe, in effecte are moſte cowardes. ¶In dyuers bookes I haue redde, and of dyuers I haue harde, and in many I haue ſeene, that it can not fayle in a man, that can ſuffre and take pacience, to haue vertue and force: And it is meruayle, that he is ſtronge and valyant, that can not ſuffre. What ſhall I ſaye more of the greues and domages, that theſe menne of warre do, in paſſynge through realmes, &amp; of theftes and robberies, that they cō
                  mytte in the houſes, where as they lodge? I enſure the, the worme in ye tymbre, nor the mothes in the clothes, nor the ſparcle in the towe, nor the darnel amōge the corne, nor the weſel among the grayn, nor the caterpyllers in fruit trees, dothe not ſoo moche domage, as one companye of menne of warre dothe hurte the poore people. They leaue noo cattayle vnſlayne, no gardeyne vnrobbed, no wylde beaſt vnchaſed,

nor no mayde vndefloured: and yet which is wors, they eate without payment, and they wyll not ſerue without payement, nor no man can conuerſe &amp; endure amonge them. Whan they are payde, by and by they play it away: if they be not payde, they robbe, and grudge: and the caſe is come to ſo great corruption, that if thou ſaweſt it, thou woldeſt ſay, that eche of them were the heed of rumour, and the begynnynge of ſtryfe, poyſon to vertues, Pyrate of rouers, and capitayne of al wretched theues. I ſay not this withoute wepynge. It is the greatteſt mockynge of all mockeries: and the cauſe gothe to ſuche loſſe and pardition, that theſe myſcheuous people ar our homely &amp; familiar enmies: &amp; yet there is no emperour, that can haue lordſhyppe ouer them, nor iuſtyce chaſtiſe them, nor feare withdrawe them, nor lawe ſubdue them, nor ſhame refrain them, nor dethe that can kyll theym, for they be men remedyleſſe: They ouer renne, and eate, and diſpoyle euerye manne. O howe ſorowfull I am for the Rome, that was not wont to haue in the ſuche yll aduentures. Certaynely in the auncient tyme, whan thou were peopled with ryght and trewe Romayns, and not as thou arte nowe with baſtarde chylderne, than the armies, that wente froo Rome, were as well diſciplyned and morigerate, as the ſchooles of the philoſophies, that were in Grece. The olde auncient hyſtories wytneſſe, that kynge Philyp of Marcedony, and his ſonne Alexāder, were happy in warre, bicauſe they kepte theyr armyes ſoo welle ordered, that it ſeemed better, to be a ſenate ruled, than an armye that wolde fyght. I ſwere to the by min honeſtie, that fro the tyme of Quintus Cincinatus, vnto the noble Marcus Marcellus, (in the whyche tyme was the greatteſt proſperitie of Rome) the common people had great glorie, as longe as the diſcipline of knyghthoode was welle corrected: and we beganne

to loſe, whan our capitaynes beganne to deſerue, to be depraued and condempned. O curſed be thou Aſye, and curſed be the day, that we hadde conqueſt of the. The goodnes that hath folowed therby, we ſe it at our eye: and the domage that is come by the, ſhall all wayes be ſorowed. In the we haue waſted our treaſures, and thou haſte filled vs with thy vices: In chaunge of ſtronge and vertuous men, thou haſte ſent thy wantons to vs: We haue ouercome thy cities, and thou triumpheſt of our vertues: we haue beaten downe thy fortreſſes, and thou haſt diſtroied our good cuſtomes: by force thou art become ours, and with our good wylles, we are nowe thyne: Vniuſtely we are lordes of thy realmes, and we are iuſt ſubiectes to thy vices: Finally, thou Aſye ſhalt be the ſepulchre of Rome, and thou Rome ſhalte be the ſyncke and gutter of the fylthynes of Aſye. Certaynely Rome ought to haue ben contente with the landes of Italye, whiche is the nauyl of the world, without conqueryng the landes of Aſye, to bereue them from other. I lyke wel al thinges that I haue red of my predeceſſours, ſauynge that they were prowde, as we theyr ſucceſſours be to hardy. And I ſweare vnto the, that yet peraduenture, after the peyne, we ſhall becomme vertuous and good. All the rycheſſe and tryumphes, that our forefathers haue broughte out of Aſye, the goodes and the rycheſſe, and they alſo, with the tyme at laſte hadde an ende: but the wantonneſſe and vyces, that are in vs theyr chyldren, doothe remayne ſtylle vnto this daye. I wolde to god, that the princis knewe, what an outragious thing it is, to inuent warres in ſtraunge landes and countreis, and what trauayle they ſerche in theyr perſons, and what thoughtes in their mindes, and what murmure and mocion in theyr ſubiectes, what ende and waſtinge of theyr rycheſſes and treaſures, What pouertie to theyr frendes,

what pleſure to their ennemies, what domage to their natiue countreys, and what poyſon they leaue to their owne enherytours? I ſweare to the, that if I had knowen, that I do knowe (I wyll not ſay, but by bloude ſhedde they be taken) if they had offered them ſelfe with good wylle, and ſhedynge of teares, I wolde not haue taken theym. The trouthe is, that our capitaynes neuer ſlewe .xx.M. men of Aſie, with their armour, that they bare out of Italye, but they loſte mo than a. C.M. Romayns, with the vices that they brought to Rome: As eatynge openly in the palayes Auſonios, ſuppyng in their houſes ſecretly, the women to cloth them as men, and the men peynted as women, The Patritiens bearynge Meaſques, The Plebeyens vſinge ſmelles, and the emperours to weare purpul. Theſe .vii. vices of Aſie, Aſie ſent for a preſent to Rome. Seuen noble capitayns broughte them, I leaue to ſhewe their names, leste I ſhulde ſhame theym with their faultes, ſythe they were ſo noble men by their highe dedes. Nowe ye princis, beholde what profitte it is, to take ſtraunge realmes with our warres: I leaue the vices, that they recouer, and the vertues that they leſe, with the perdition of their treaſure that they loue. For certayne there is neyther kynge nor realme broughte to extreme pouertie, but by watrynge a ſtraunge realme, with fynall and extreme conqueſt. I demaund of the myne owne frend Cornelius, What cauſeth princis, to leſe their treaſure, and require them of other? Whan their owne can not ſuffyſe, then they take fro churches, ſerche dyuers lones, reyſe tributes, and inuent new ſubſydies, gyue and ſpende on ſtraungers, and make him ſelfe hated of his owne, pray euery man, and haue nede of euery man: aduenture his perſone, and aduenture his renoume? If thou knoweſte not this, I wyll tell the, if thou wylte here me. Theſe princis counſell with men, they liue

with men, and fynally at the laſt they are men. At one time by pryde, that ſurmounteth them, an other tyme by councell, that fayleth them, ſome imagininge by theyr fantaſies, ſome ſayinge, that if he haue great goodes, he ought to encreaſe his fame, and that no memory ſhuld be of him, if he inuented no warre, &amp; that the emperour of Rome by right, is lord of al the erth. And in this maner, as his fortunes is baſe, &amp; his thoughtes hygh, the goddis ſuffre, yt whā he thinketh iuſtly to wynne an other mans, than iuſtly he loſeth his owne. O princis, I can not tell what begileth you, for where as ye maye be ryche with pleaſure, ye wyll be poore with warre: where as ye may be beloued, ye wyll be hated: where as ye may play and ſporte your ſelf, and reſte in a ſure lyfe, ye wyll committe your ſelfe to the chaunces of fortune: and where as other haue neceſſitie of you, ye put your ſelfe to be in the neceſſitie of other. And thoughe the prince make no warre, he ſhuld not ſuffre his people to warre: Euery manne ought to leaue the warre. Frend Cornelius, I demaund of the, whether is more trauaylle to his perſone, or domage to his realme, a kynges ennemies, orels his owne armie? His ennemies robbe on the coſtes, but our men robbe all the londe: The enmyes maye be reſiſted, but we dare not ſpeake to our owne men. The ennemies enuade vs on one day, and recule backe ageyn, but our gariſons robbe daily, and abyde ſtyll. The ſtrangers haue ſome feare, but ours are ſhameles: and at the laſt, the farther that our ennemies goo, the more they waxe liberall, and our armies of men, euery daye encreaſe in crueltie, in ſuche wyſe, that they offend the goddis, and be importunate to theyr princes, and noyful to the people, lyuynge to the domage of euery man, and be vnprofytable to al men. By the god Mars, I ſwere to the, and as I maye be holpen in the warres, that I gouerne with my

hande, I haue mo complayntes dayly from the ſenate on the capitaynes that ben in Illyrike, than on all the ennemies of the Romayne people: I haue more feare in mainteynynge one ſtandarde of a hundred menne, than to giue battaylle to .l.M. ennemies. For the goddis and fortune diſpatche a battayle in an houre, be it good or badde: but with theſe other, I can do nothyng in al my lyfe. Thus it hath ben my frende Cornelius, and thus it is, and thus it ſhall be. Thus I founde it, thus I holde it, and thus I ſhall leaue it. Our fathers dyd inuente it, and we ſuſteyne it, that be their chyldren, and for ylle, it ſhal abyde to our heires. I ſay to the one thyng, and I thynke I am not deceyued therin: To endure ſo great domage, and to no profitte of the people, I thinke it a great foly in man, or els a great puniſhement of the goddis. Be the goddis ſoo iuſte in all iuſtice, and ſo true in all veritie, that they wyll ſuffre vs without reaſon, to do yl in ſtrange landes, to whom we dydde neuer good, and in our owne howſes to haue ſhrewde tournes of them, to whom we haue alwaye done good? Theſe thynges frende Cornelius, I haue writen to the, not bycauſe I thynke it nedefull, that thou ſhuldeſte knowe it: but my ſpirite reſteth in ſhewyng of it. Panutius my ſecretatrie went to viſite this land, and on the way I gaue him this letter, and I do ſend to the two horſes, I thynke they be good. The armour and iewels, that I won on the Parthes, I haue departed them. Howe be it I ſēde the a chariot of theym. My wyfe Fauſtyne ſalutethe the, and ſendeth to thy wife a riche glaſſe, and an ouche of precious ſtones to thy doughter: I beſeche the goddis, to giue the good lyfe and me a good death.

                  MArke of mount Celio, companion of the empire, to the Torcate, beinge at Gayette, patricien Romain, ſalute to thy perſon, and vertue and force againſt aduers fortune. It is a thre monthes, ſythe I receiued thy letter, the whiche myn eies myght not make an ende to rede, nor my handes to anſwere. I am ſo heuy for thy heuineſſe, ſo peinfull for thy peyn, and ſo hurt with thy wounde, that where as thou wepeſt with thyn eies outwardely, I weepe with my harte inwardly. I wote what difference is betwene the tree and the croppe, and the dreme fro the trouthe: I here of thy trauayles by ſtraunge perſons, and I fele them in myn owne perſon. But where as true frendes be, the peynes are in cōmen. The greate infortunes ought to be ſuffred for one thynge, bycauſe they declare, who ar the true frendes. I knowe by thy, letter howe thou arte banyſhed from Rome, and all thy goodes confyſcate, and that for pure heuynes, thou arte ſycke in thy body. I wolde go ſe the, and counſayle thy perſon, bycauſe that thou myghteſt ſee, with what harte and wyll, I doo wepe for thy myſaduenture. But if thou take me for thy trewe frende, beleue me, as I beleue the, that is, howe moche I feele thy myſaduenture. Of trouthe, as thou art banyſhed bodyly, ſoo am I banyſſhed inwardely in my harte. And yf thy goodes or ſubſtaunce be taken away fro the, I am robbed of a good frende and companyon. And yf thou lackeſte thy frendes, I am abydynge amonge myn enmies. Though I might remedy by workynge of my power, thy banyſhment: yet I wyl counſaile thy ſpirite with certain wordis.

If I be not forgetfull, I neuer ſawe the contente in this lyfe: bycauſe thou were euer beſye in thy proſperitie, and wery of any aduerſitie. And as nowe, I ſe the diſpayre, as though thou were but new come into this worlde. I haue knowen the this .xxxii. yeres in great ioy: and nowe thou complayneſt of .vi. monethes, that fortune hathe tourned her whele. O Torcate, nowe thou mayſt knowe, that vertuous men, feare more two dayes of proſperitie than two hundred of aduerſe fortune. O howe manye menne, and howe manye ryche cities haue thou and I ſene, ſlyppe fro their proſperities, throughe their vycyous lyuynge and ſtraunge enmities? In ſuche wiſe, that theyr vaynglorye and ſlypper proſperitie, endured but two dayes: and the hurtes and loſſe that they haue hadde, and the cruell and extreme enmities, the whiche alſo that they haue wonne, laſteth to this daye in their heires. Contrarye wyſe, we ſee ſome ſet in the height of tribulations, the whiche haue eſcaped by caſtynge away vyces, clothynge them with vertues, wery of euyll warkes, folowynge goodnes, beinge frendes to all, and ennemies to none. What wylte thou, that I ſhulde ſay more? They that are happye, are ouercome in peace, and they that are vnhappy, do ouercomme other in warre. Therfore my frende Torcate, it ſemeth to me, no leſſe neceſſite, to gyue good counſayle, than to proſper with great proſperitie, to remedy them that are in gret heuyneſſe. For as wery are they, that go the playn way, as they that coſteth the hyghe mountaynes. By thy letter I perceiue, that what tyme thou hopedſt to haue ben in moſt quietnes and reſt, this yll fortune and chaunce fell on the. Be nat abaſhed therof. For thoughe that all newe chaunces cauſeth newe thoughtes preſently, yet therby cometh more cauſe of ſtedfaſtnes in tyme to come. Certaynly the tree beareth not ſo moche fruite, there as it ſpringeth firſt,

as it dothe whan it is newe ſet in an other place. And all good ſmelles are more odoriferous, if they be wel medled and chaufed togyther. I pray the tell me, abydynge in the worlde, beinge a chylde of the ſame, and louing the world, what hopeſt thou to haue of the worlde, but worldly thinges? the worlde ſhall always be the worlde. At this houre thou art worldly, and ſhalt be worldly, and ſhalt be entreated as the worlde is accuſtomed to entreate theym that be worldly. If thou kneweſt thy ſelfe and thy weakeneſſe, yf thou kneweſt fortune and her mutation, if thou kneweſte the men and their malices, if thou kneweſt the worlde, and the flatteryng therof, thou woldeſt reyſe the fro the hande therof with honour, and not be chaſtyſed with infamye. O howe we hope to ſprede by fortune? O how often withoute reſpecte vnwares we paſſe this lyfe? O howe often we truſte the bobaunce of this worlde? and we truſt therin as moche as though it neuer begyled man. I ſay it not bicauſe I haue harde it ſayde, nor bycauſe I haue redde it in bokes: but for we ſe it dayly with our eies, ſomme decaye and leſe their goodes, other fall and looſe their credence, ſome falle in ſyght, and leeſe their honour, and other ariſe and loſe theyr lyues, and ſome thynke, that all are free by pryuilege, where as neuer none were pryuyleged. O my frende Torcate, of one thynge I am certayne, and let euery man take it for a warnyng: Men, by whom we be borne, be of ſo yll diſpoſition, and the worlde ſo fierſe and cruel, with whom we lyue, and the glydynge ſerpente fortune ſo full of poyſon, that they hurte vs with their fete, &amp; byte vs with their teethe, and ſcratche vs with theyr nayles, and ſwelle vs with their poyſon, ſoo that the paſſynge of the lyfe is no leſſe than takynge of deathe. And in caſe thou haſte ſene ſomme lyue longe without any falle of fortune, thynke not it is well, for it is not by good aduenture, but

the more his yll fortune. The worlde is ſo malicious, that if we take not hede to prepare againſt his wrinches, it wyl ouerthrowe vs to our greatter loſſe and hurt. Moche ſooner dye they that ben helthful with the infirmities &amp; ſyckenes of few days, than they that be weke with their lāgour of many yeres. I ſay this bycauſe I hold it for moſt ſuretie, that the myſerable manne, that maye not lyue without myſeries, ſhulde fele the peynes by lyttell and lyttell, and not all at ones. We eate diuers thinges by morſels, which if we ſhulde eate hole, wold choke vs. In lykewyſe by dyuers dayes we ſuffre dyuers trauayles, whiche al togyder wolde make an ende of vs in one day. And than ſythe the goddis wyll permytte, that thy mysfortune ſhall fall, and that the ryuer of thy decay ouerflowe her chanell, &amp; where thou weneſt to be moſt ſure, thou ſhalt be in greateſt peryl, we ſhall miniſter to the a ſyrope, to thentent that thou loſe not thy good renoume, though thou haue loſte thy goodis that be nought. Telle me I praye the Torcate, why complayneſt thou, as he that is ſycke? Why crieſt thou lyke a foole? why ſygheſt thou as a deſperate man? Why wepeſt thou as a chylde? Thou haſte gone an yll way, and complayneſt of thy reſte. Thou arte clothed to goo throughe buſhes, and thou ſayeſt that thy gownes do teare. Thou walkeſt amonge the ſtoones, and arte ſorye bycauſe thou falleſt. Thou haſt leaned, and thoughteſt not to fal, and fynally thou arte ſette with the worlde, and thynkeſte to be free with heuen. Wylte thou haue ſaufeconduite of Fortune, that is ennemye to many? She can not giue the naturalitie, whiche is mother to all thynges. I wyll axe the one thynge: I put caſe the ſee hadde promyſed the, to be alway in ſuretie of her, and the ſkye clere wether, the ſommer ſnowes, and the wynter flowres. It wyll not be of a ſuretie Torcate. If nature canne not fulfylle this, beinge

thyn owne mother, thinkeſt thou than, that fortune wylle gyue it the, whiche is thy vniuſte ſtepmother? Kepe this rule for certayne, and neuer forget it, that al natural courſes are ſubiectes to mutation euery yere. And all worldely folke that truſte on fortune, ſhall ſuffre eclyps euery moment. And than ſith naturall thynges can not be alwayes in one caſe, of neceſſitie the goodis of Fortune muſte peryſhe, ſythe they be ſuperfluitie. Ryght vniuſte ſhulde the ryghtwyſe goddis be, yf they had made perpetuall that, whiche is domageable to ſo many: Or that whiche is profitable, to haue created it fallyble. I wylle ſpeake no more of thy proſperitie in tymes paſte, but nowe I wyll comme to the banyſhement that thou ſuffreſt preſentely. Suſpecious fortune made a fayre at thy gate, knowynge what ſhe ſolde: and thou wyſte not what thou boughteſt: She made a dere bargayne, and ſolde it dere to the: ſhe hathe gyuen the ſowre for ſwete, and the ſwete is tourned into ſowreneſſe for the: ſhe hath gyuen the yuell for good, and hath tourned thy good to yl. And finaly ſhe hath begyled the at a iuſte price, not wenynge to the that ſhe wold haue done the domage: and though that ſhe was malycious in ſellynge to the, thou were no leſſe foolyſſhe in the byenge therof: for the more there is in fortunes ſhoppe, the more ſuſpecte is the marchandyſe. O howe vnhappy be we, for in that market is nothyng ſold but lyes. And ſhe truſteth nothynge but vppon the pledges of our renoume: and at laſte wyll not be payde but with the ſhotte of our lyfe, and that is the mooſte greatteſte and myſcheuous wounde. It is as openly knowē to euery man as to the, that where as they thynke not to leeſe theyr wares, falſe Fortune in that they purpoſe, to theyr myſhappe lyeth in awayte, and is redy to bye theym. Thou makeſt me very ſore abaſſhed Torcate. I haue reputed the ryghte wyſe and vertuous,

and nowe I take the for a loſte foole. In good ſothe whan I ſawe the yonge in Gayette, I iudged the worthy to gouerne Rome: and nowe that thou art olde, thou deſerueſt nothyng but to be caſt in a galey as a ſclaue. O howe many thynges are there to knowe a man by? There is not ſo hyghe a toppe of a hylle, but it is troden with feete: nor ſoo depe a ſee, but it is ſounded with leade. And in a hundred yeres one manne can not attayne to knowe an other mannes harte. Telle me I praye the, what lokedſte thou for of fortune, after ſoo greatte welthe? Lyuynge to the worlde, thynke to be in the world. The chyldren of vanite goo and walke ſoo longe, that at laſte theyr diſordynate deſyre canne not take fro the worlde their antike vilanyes and ſhamfulnes, the whiche fortune dothe not with them that ſhe hathe reyſed vnto the ſkyes, thynkeſte than, that ſhe ſhal bowe with the to the loweſte parties? O fole Torcate, thoughteſte thou to paſſe the ſee without peryll, to eate fleſſhe withoute bones, To drynke wyne withoute lyes, to walke in the wayes without fyndynge ſtones, To bye wheate without chaffe? In good ſoth, if thou thoughteſt to bye yl goodes without hindrance of thy good fame, and to maynteyn thy good renome without loſſe of yl gotten goodes, I wolde wytte of the, what thou dydeſt hope to do, ſithe ſoo longe ſeaſon thou haſte made a face in the worlde .xxxiii, yere thou haſt ben in the grace of the world, nowe it is tyme fro henſforth to fall at ſome diſcorde therwith, Abell, kyng of the Aſſiriens, hoped to haue but ſeuē yeres of good proſperitie. Queene Simiramis but onely ſyxe. Abell kynge of the Lacedemoniens fyue, Eutrete kynge of the Caldeens .iiii. Alexander kynge of the grekes .iii. Amylcar the great of Carthage but two, and our Gayus Ceſar Romayne but one onely, and many before and ſythe not one yere: And ſith thou were the mooſte vnknowen

of lynage, the groſſeſte of vnderſtandynge, and the leaſte of power, the darkeſt of fame, and the moſt weke in merites: wherfore than complayneſte thou on fortune? If thou haddeſt ben vertuous in all theſe .xxx. yeres, thou haddeſt neuer eaten without thoughte, nor neuer ſpoken without ſuſpection, nor ſlepte without ſtertyng, thinking what thou haddeſt to do, and wherin fortune myghte begyle the. He that is ſo longe beſette aboute with ſoo many enemies, I can not tell howe he ſhuld take any ſure ſlepe. Ah Torcate Torcate, the worlde hath ſo many falles, and we knowe ſo yll howe to continue amonge theym, that be worldly, that ſcantly we are fallen whan our handes and fete lyke ſclaues be ſo faſte tyed, that we can not loſe them. It fylleth our perſons full of vices, ſtrengtheth our ſinewes to wickednes, weaketh our hartes in vertues, and fynally rendreth our ſpirites in a traunce, and maſethe our vnderſtandynge, and chaungeth our taſte, and ſufferethe vs as beaſtes to ſhewe our euylles that we fele with waylynges, all though as men we durſt not ſhew it. And that this is true, it appereth, that whanne we ſee, that we loſe, we lament and complayne, and none can helpe hym ſelfe. This ſmal leſſon I writte to the, to the ende thou ſhuldeſt lyue in leſſe thoughte. The horſe colte that thou dyddeſte ſende me, leapeth very well: The ſpanyell that thou ſente to me, is well, but he is wylde: the calfe was verye fatte, and I wolde haue eaten it forthwith, but my wyfe Fauſtyn beſily prayed me to kepe it, and thynketh that it was ſtolen in a gardeyne. I ſende to the .ii.M. ſexters for to ſuccour the in thy trauayles. And as touchinge thy banyſhement, at tyme conuenient I ſhal diſpatch thy matters with the ſenate. The conſolation of the goddis, and the loue of man be with the Torcate. The ſodeynnes of euils, and the yre of the furies be ſeperate froo me Marcus Aurelius.

Fauſtyn my wyfe greteth the, and in lyke wiſe fro her parte and ours, to thy mother in lawe, and thy wyfe haue vs recommended. Marc of Rome ſendeth this writynge to Torcate of Gayette.
            
            
               ¶A letter ſent to Domitius of Capue to comforte hym in his baniſſhemente. The fourth letter.
               
                  MArke oratour Romayn, borne on mount Celio, to the Domitian of Capue ſalute and conſolation of the goddis conſolatours. In this right colde wynter there aroſe in this lande a myghty gret wynd, and by reaſon of the great wynde aroſe great quantitie of waters, and the waters haue cauſed great humidites, and great humidities brede dyuers maladies and diſeaſes: and amonge all the infirmities of this lande I haue the goute in my hande, and the ciatica in my legge. For the helth of my wyfe Fauſtine I can neyther go nor write. I ſaye it bycauſe I can not write to the ſo longe as the caſe wolde require, and as thy thankes meryteth, and my deſyre coueteth. It is ſhewed me, that by occaſion of a hors thou haſt had ſtrif with Patricio thy neyghbour, &amp; that thou art baniſhed fro Capue, and ſet in the priſon Mamartyn. Thy goodis are cō
                  fiſked, and thy chyldren baniſhed, thy houſe caſte downe, and thy neuewe is putte out of the ſenate, and banyſſhed the ſenate for .x. yeres. It is tolde me, that all the daye thou wepeſt, and wakeſt by nyght: in company thou dieſt, and doeſt loue to reſte ſolytarilye: Thou hateſte pleaſure, and loueſt penſyuenes. And I haue no meruayle: for the ſorowefull hartes lyue with teares and wepynge, and be

mery &amp; laugh in dienge. I am ryght ſory to ſe the loſt: but moche more, that for ſo ſmalle a thynge thou ſhuld be caſt away, as for a hors to leſe al thyn eſtate. O howe variable is fortune, and howe ſoone a myſaduenture falleth before our eies? Fortune gyueth theſe euyls, &amp; we ſee it not: with her handes ſhe toucheth vs, and we fele it not: ſhe tredeth vs vnder fete, and we knowe hit not: ſhe ſpeaketh in our eares, and we here her not: ſhe crieth alowde vnto vs, and we vnderſtande her not: and this is bycauſe we wyll not knowe her: and finally, whan we thynke we are moſte ſureſt, than are we in moſte peryll. Trouth it is, that with a lyttell wynde, the fruyte falleth fro the tree: and with a lyttell ſparcle the houſe is ſette a fyre: a ſmall rocke breaketh a greatte ſhyppe: and with a lyttell ſtone the legge is hurte. I ſaye, that oftentyme of that we feare not, cometh greatte peryll. In a cloſe Fiſtula, rather than in an open, the ſurgiens doubte the peryll: In depe ſtyll waters the pilote feareth more than in the great hye wawes: Of ſecret enbuſhement, rather than of open armies, the warriour doubteth. I wyll not onely ſay of ſtraungers, but of hys owne propre, not of ennemyes, but of frendes, not of crewelle warre, but of peace, not of open domage or ſclaunder, but of ſecrete peryll and myſchiefe, a wyſe man ought to beware. Howe many haue we ſene, that the chances of Fortune coulde not abate, and yet within a ſhorte whyle after, vnwarenes with great ignomynious ſhame hath ouerthrowen them? I wolde witte of the, what reſte can a perſone haue, that truſteth euer vpon the proſperitie of fortune, ſyth for ſo lyght a cauſe we haue ſene ſo great a ſtryfe in Rome, and ſuche a loſſe to thy howſe? Seynge that I ſee, I wyll not feare the wyndes of her trauayles, nor beleue in the clereneſſe of her pleaſures, nor her thunders ſhal not feare me, nor wil truſt vpon her flatteringes,

nor thanke her for that ſhe leueth with me, nor be ſorye for that ſhe taketh froo me, nor wake for any trouthe that ſhe ſayth to me, nor ryſe for any of her leaſynges, nor lawghe for any thyng that ſhe deſyreth of me, nor wepe for gyuing me leaue. If thou knoweſt not the cauſe of this, I ſhal tel the. Our lyfe is ſo doubtefull, and fortune ſo way warde, that ſhe dothe not alway threate in ſtrykynge, nor ſtriketh in thretnynge. The wyſe man gothe not ſoo temperately, that he thynketh at euery ſteppe to falle, nor lyue with ſo ſmalle athought, to thynke to ouerthrowe in euery playn pathe. For oftentymes falſe fortune ſhaketh her weapon, and ſtriketh not, and an other tyme ſtryketh without ſhakynge. Beleue me of one thynge Domitius, That parte of the lyfe is in moſte perylle, whan with lyttell thoughte or care men thynke them ſelfe mooſt ſure. Wylt thou ſe the trouthe therof. Cal to thy minde Hercules, that ſcaped fro many perylles by ſee and by lande, and yet dyed betwene his lēmans armes. Laomedon peryſhed not vnder Troy, but was ſlayne in his howſe. Greate Alexander dyed not in makynge warre ouer all the erthe, but he ended with a lyttell poyſon. The couragious Caius Ceſar ſaued hym ſelfe in .lii. battayles, and after in the ſenate was ſlayne with .xxxii. ſtrokes of penknyues. Aſclipio brother of Pompeie, peryſhed not flotynge .xxii. yere vppon the ſee, but he was drowned after in drawynge water at a welle. Tenne capitains that Scipio had with him in Affrike, that vanquyſhed many harde batayles, as they were mockyng on a brydge, they fel fro the bridge, and were drowned. Good Druſio that had ouercome the Parthes, the day of his triumph, goyng to his charyot, there felle a tyle that claue aſonder his heed, ſoo that vayneglorie was the ende of his good lyfe. What ſhuld I tel the more? Thou knoweſt well that Lucye my ſyſter, hauyng a nedel on her boſom, playenge

with her chylde betwene her armes, the chylde with his hande hytte the nedell ſuche a ſtroke into her bodye, that he ſlewe his mother. Gneo Ruffyn the conſulle, ſente ageinſt the Germayns, of our tyme was ſoo valyaunte in armes, that none of our predeceſſours ſurmounted hym: yet he kembynge his olde whyte heares, one of the teethe of the combe entred into his heed, wherby grewe an ympoſtume, by occaſion wherof he ended his honorable lyfe for ſoo ſmalle a caſe. Howe ſemethe the Domitius? As I do tell the of ſo ſmall a nombre, I coude recyte infinite exāples, What mysfortunes fell after good fortunes, What miſchaunce after great glorie, what myſaduenture after great happe, what greatte euyll they take of theyr deathe, after the begynnynge of greatte welthe in the lyfe. I beinge as they, knowe not what to deſire, but they beinge as I am, wyl rather chuſe the labourous and honourable deathe, than an yll death and an honourable lyfe. To my ſemynge he, that wyll be a man amonge men, and not a beaſte amonge beſtes, ought to trauayle ſore to lyue well, and moche more to dye better. For at the fynall ende an yll dethe putteth great doubte of the good lyfe: and the good dethe excuſeth the yll lyfe. I haue written to the at the begynnynge of my letter, that by reaſon of the humydities, the gowte greuethe me ylle. But to ſatisfie thy deſire, I wolde fayne write with my hande more at lengthe. Two daies the loue that I bare to the, hathe faught with the peine that I endure. My wille wolde write, but my fyngers can not holde my penne. The remedy is, ſithe I maye not as I wold, that thou wylte take as thine owne, that I maye do, as myne owne dede. Fauſtine my wife ſaluteth the, who by reaſonne of my diſeaſes, is halfe ylle at eaſe. It is ſhewed her, that thou haſte greatte peyne of a hurte of thy face, ſhe hathe ſente the a boxe with baume,

that thy hurte ſhal not appere in thy viſage. If thou canſt fynde any grene almondes or new nuttis, Fauſtine prayeth the, to ſende her ſome by this bearer. I haue but lyttel ſtore of money, therfore I ſende the a gowne, and thy wyfe a kyrtell. No more, but I pray the goddis to giue the that I deſire for the: and to giue me, that thou deſireſte for me. And beſide, that I do write to the with my hande, I gyue to the myne owne propre harte.
            
            
               A letter ſente fro the emperour to Claudius and Claudyne his wyfe, bycauſe they being olde, lyued as yonge perſons ¶The .v. letter.
               
                  MArcke of mount Celio to the Claudius and Cladine huſbande and wyfe, dwellynge in my warde, I deſyre helthe, ſendynge you this letter. The trouthe is, bycauſe ye are my frendes, &amp; vnder my charge, I enquire of them that come fro you, of your eſtates: and by theym that goo to you, I ſende recommendations to you bothe: yf ye haue my good wyll, demaunde hit of your hartes. And if in your ſtomacke ye repute and take me but as a ſuſpecious frende, thanne I thynke my ſelfe euen cleane condempned. The cruelle forgetfulneſſe, the whiche may be cauſex of myne abſence, peraduenture banyſheth the good dedes, that ye haue receyued of my perſonne. If in any thynge I haue entreated you with lyes, than I require, that ye entreate me nothyng with trouth. But if I haue bene alwayes your good neyghbour and frende, yf ye haue any nede of myne honour, thanne be to me as good. Gayo Furion my frende, as well as your parent, paſſynge this waye to Alexandrye, hathe ſhewed me

many thinges, the whiche were done in Rome: &amp; amonge other, he ſhewed me one thynge, that cauſed me to laugh, whan I hard it: and yet it was ryght greuous to me, whā I thought theron. Somme thynges we take ſodeynly in ſporte and mockerie, the whiche afterwarde, well conſidered, maketh vs verye ſorye. He ſhewed me, howe that ye ſeme to euery man right auncient, and very yonge in your doinge: for you aray your ſelfe dayly with newe apparel▪ as ye ſhulde go to weddynges: and where as men do honour you as ancient perſons, ye ſhewe your ſelfe wanton: and whan folke renne to ſe gewgawes, ye ar not the laſte. There is no lyghtnes in Rome, but it is regeſtred in your houſe. Thus ye gyue your ſelfe to pleaſures, as they that thynke neuer to haue diſpleaſure. And fynally, whanne ye ſhulde lyfte vp your handes, ye entre newely into the wages of the worlde. Truely my neyghbours and frendes, to ſpeake with dewe reuerence, I am aſſhamed of your vnſhamefaſtnes, and am no leſſe ſory for your fautes. There be dyuers greuous faultes, that are made lyghte by the honeſte withdrawynge of them. And ſome other that are but ſmal fautes: and fyndyng no ways to leaue them, are eſtemed very great. By all the goddis, I can fynde none occaſion, howfor to excuſe your euylles: but I ſee inowe, wherwith to condempne theym. Wherfore pardon me, yf that I ſeme vnhoneſte to ſpeake ſo moche, whan ye be not honeſte in your lyuynge. In good ſothe I denaye not, but that thou Claudius haſte bene ryght free and lyberalle of thy perſon, and thou Claudine ryght fayre of vyſage, and many perſons for the beautie of thy forhed haue ben curious to haue had the to wife, but I wold wit of the youth of ye one, &amp; beautie of the other, in vſyng all your liues in vanitie, what goodly trinkettes ye hope to were in the ſtraitnes of the Sepulchre. O great foles, ye and foles ageyn,

Do you not knowe yet, that the tyme fleeth with mouyng of wynges? The lyfe trauayleth on her way without lyftynge of her fete: fortune ſtretcheth her without ſtyrryng her armes, &amp; the worlde voydeth it ſelfe ſayenge nothyng, the fleſhe conſumeth without felynge, and our glorye paſſeth as it neuer had ben: and fynally dethe aſſayleth vs er euer he knocke at the gate. Certaynely it is impoſſible for to make ſynewes of blode, of veynes to make bones, of a craggy rocke a plaine way, and of poſſible to make impoſſible. I meane that none ſhal thynke, but that the greneneſ of youthe ſhall waſte and wydder in age. O worlde, what a world art thou: ſo lytel is our force, and our wekeneſ ſo great, that withoute reſyſtynge drowneſte vs wyllyngly in the depenes of thy peryllous whyrlepoole: and hydeſt vs in the thyckeſt of thy mountaynes, and leadeſt vs out of the brode way, wandring by thy narow pathes, and bryngeſt vs into the rugged waye. I doo meane, that they that be greatteſt in fauour, thou bryngeſt into daunger, to the entente that with one ſtroke of thy foote, thou mayſt ouerthrowe them. O worlde .lii. yere I haue benne in the, and yet thou neuer ſaydeſt one trouthe to me, and I haue taken the with .x.M. lyes. I neuer deſyred any thynge of the, but thou dyddeſt promyſe hit me, but thou neuer gaueſt me any thynge promyſed me: I neuer treted with the, but thou begyledſte me, I neuer arryued at the, but thou loſte me: I neuer ſawe thynge in the, wherby I ſhulde loue the. For all that we ſee in the, is worthy to be abhorred. And beſyde this, I wote not what is the world. O what faut is in vs thy worldly wretches? For yf thou hate vs, we dare not hate the: yf thou braule with vs, we muſte be ſtylle: yf thou ſpurne at vs, we muſte ſuffre the: if thou beate vs with a ſtaffe, we ſaye nothynge: And yet if thou woldeſt haue vs gone, we wyll not go. And worſte

of all is, that we hadde rather ſerue the for nothyng with trauayle, thanne the goddis with prayer and reſte. I ſwere to the by the immortalle goddis, that oftentymes I make accompte of my yeres paſſed: and an other tyme I reuolue my bookes, to ſee what I haue redde. And lykewyſe I demaund of my frendes, to gyue me counſel to know, wherin it is that I wolde ſpeake. I beinge at Rhodes, redynge Rhetorique, My lorde Adrian kepynge me there, at the age of .xxi. yere, my yonge fleſhe, and no leſſe weake than tender, at the fyrſte worke I founde ſolytaryneſſe, and the ſolytarineſſe with lybertie adored the worlde: In adoryng I felte it, in felynge I folowed it, in folowyng I ouertoke it, in ouertakynge I toke it, in takyng I proued it, in prouynge I taſted it, in taſtyng I found it bytter, in fyndyng in bytter, I hated it, in hatynge it, I felte it, in leauynge it, it retourned, and retournynge I receyued it. And in this maner .lii. yeres, we haue eaten of one breadde, and dwelled in one houſe. Whā I ſawe it diſpleſed, I ſerued it, whan it ſawe me thoughtfull it chered me, whan I ſawe it in proſperitie, I demaunded it, whan it ſawe me mery, it begyled me. And thus we be togyther vnto this day, not gyuynge me leaue to goo, nor I wyllynge to departe fro it. O worlde, thou haſte ſo many countenances in thy vanitie, that thou leadeſt all wandrynge in vnſtablenes. Syth we suffre the to take vs, thou wylt neuer deliuer vs: if we withdraw our fete fro the ſnare of fortune, forthwith thou fettreſt our legges faſt with yrons: and if by chance we fyle the yrons, anon thou manacleſt our handes: and though the way be ſtrayte, the pathe ſharpe, the iourneye longe, and our fleſhe weake, yet our bodies are euer laden with vyces, and our hartes fulfylled with thoughtes and penſyuenes. Of one thynge I haue greatte meruayle, and I can not deuyſe what it is: without any conſtraynt to the

contrary, we go ſurely ouer the brydge, and yet we wyll go an other way: and though the ſame waye be ſure, yet we wyll aduenture into the gulfre: if the wayes be drye, yet wyll we goo throughe the dyrte and myre and plaſſhe: hauynge meate for our lyuynge we ſerche for poyſon to kyll vs: we ſerche to be loſt, and may be aſſured: withoute intereſt we commytte ſynne, ſeinge peyne commynge withall: and fynally, to the entente that we ſhoulde be taken for good, we ſhote at the whyte of vertues, and hytte the butte of vyces. One thynge I confeſſe, though it be myne owne ſhame, Peraduenture in tyme to come it ſhal be profytable to ſomme other. In .l. yeres of my lyfe, I wolde proue all the vyces of this lyfe, to ſee if any thynge might haue ſatisfied the humayn malyce: And after I had ſene all thynge, I founde, that the more I dydde eate, the more I dyed for hungre: The more I ſlepte, the more fluggye I was: the more I dranke, the more thyrſte I hadde, the more I reſted, the more werye I was: the more good I hadde, the more couetous I was: the more I ſoughte, the leſſe I founde: And fynally I neuer toke peyne for any thynge, but I was euer lette: and thanne anone I hadde appetite to an other. Lette no manne thynke to lyue in the fleſhe, and ſatisfie the fleſhe. It hath power to take fro vs our lyfe: and we haue no power to take frome it the diſordinate couetyſe. I wolde fayne knowe of the goddis, why our dayes ſhulde haue an ende. O cruelle goddis, what is this? We can neuer paſſe one good lyfes day, we do but taſte it, and ſo paſſeth our lyfe, and lyfe is but a dreame, and dethe waketh it. Lette euery manne knowe, that the worlde taketh our wyll, and we with our good wyll gyue it therto: and it takethe our wylle, to the ende to contente vs, and prayſe that we prayſe, and the tyme paſſethe ſoo, that we lyue after the curſed tyme. To attayne vertues,

we haue good deſire: but to attayne to vices we putte to all our warkes. This haue I ſayde for you Claudyus and Claudine, that in thre ſcore yeres, ye wylle not yſſue nor goo oute of the pryſonne of the worlde: Hauynge your feete putrifyed with yrons and chaynes. What is thanne to be hoped of yonge perſonnes, whiche be of fyue and twenty yeres olde? Excepte my memorye fayle me, whan I was with you, ye hadde your neuewes, ſonnes of your chyldren maryed, and nyeces, doughters of your doughters maryed: and me thynketh, whan the guynes comme, the ſeaſon of cheryes is not comme: and whanne the newe wyne is tounned, the drye huſkes are caſte out. Canne ye ſuffre dyuers neuewes, ſonnes to your chyldren, in your howſe, and fewe yeres in your perſones? Very ſeldome we ſee fruite and the floweres togyther: for whanne the one is rype, and in ſeaſon, than the other is cleane goone and auoyded.
               ¶In this caſe I thynke greatte meruayle, howe ye can be of manye yeres, and ſeeme to be yonge. I knowe none other thynge, but whanne ye maryed Lambert, your own doughter to Druſio, and Matryne your nyece, doughter of your doughter, with Lamberte, that were all lyttell and yonge chyldren: and ſythe that ye be of a good aege, and lacke good, ye maye gyue vnto eche of them twenty yeres of your aege, in ſtede of theyr dowrie. And ſoo ye ſhall vnlade you of your yeres, and charge you with other mennes goodes and ſubſtaunce. Noo leſſe this mattier paſſeth in my thoughte, than the ſhorte clothe doothe in a falſe weuers handes. Ye haue ſtrayned it on the tentours, and drawen it on the perche, for to to lengthen the lyfe. If ye were made faire and clere cordwainers waxe, and ſwete of ſauour, that ye myghte be drawen out at lengthe, hit were welle doone, but ye are but as fruyte of almondes,

ſemynge drie without, and worme eaten within. For the loue that I haue to you, and for neyghbourheed that ye haue had with me, I deſire ſtyll frendſhyppe of you, that lyke as I knewe you yonge and very yonge, ſo to knowe you olde and very olde. I ſay not that ye ſurmoūt in age, but your wytte fayleth you. O Claudius and Claudine, I wylle ye knowe, that to ſuſteyne youthe, and to deface age, to length the lyfe, and driue awaye dethe: it is not in mennes handes that deſyre hit: it is the goddis that doo gyue it, whiche accordinge to iuſtyce and our couetyſe, giueth vs lyfe by weighte, and deathe without meaſure. Ye may know, that our nature is corruption of our body, and our bodye is putrifaction of our wytte, and our wytte is guyde to our ſoule, and our ſoule is mother of our deſyres, and our deſires are ſleers of our youthe, &amp; our youth token of our age, and our age ſpye of our dethe, and dethe the houſe of our lyfe, wherinto youthe gothe on fote, and from age we canne not flee on hors backe. I wolde wyte a thinge of you: what fynde ye in this lyfe? wherfore dothe lyfe content you after .lxxx. yeres of age? eyther ye haue ben good or yl: if ye haue bene good and vertuous, ye ſhal not reioyce you with yll goddis: if ye haue benne yll▪ than as well deſire dethe, to thentente ye ſhulde be no more yll,  orels iuſtly ye might be ſlayn by iuſtice. For he yt hath ben yll tyll .lx. yeres of age, in him there is no hope of amendmente. Whan the couragious great Pompeie, and Caius Ceſar were ennemies, and beinge in cruell ciuil battailes, Rome was infamed, and them ſelf loſt. The annales ſhew, that ſuche as came in fauour of Iulius Ceſar, cam out of the weſt, and the ſuccours of Pompeie out of the eaſte, among other there came certayne people out of Barbarie, dwellyng amonge the mountayns Riffees toward Inde: Their cuſtome was, whan they came to thage of .l. yeres,

to make great fyres, and brenne them ſelfe quicke in ſacrifyce to theyr goddis, and the ſame daye the parentes and chyldren wolde make great feaſtes, and eate of the fleſſhe halfe brente, and drynke wyne with the aſhes of the bones. This was ſene with the eies of Pompei, bicauſe that ſom accomplyſhed the yeres of fyftye in the campe. O golden worlde, wherin were ſuche men. O happy people, that in all the worldes to come, hath left ſuch a memorie of them. They diſpiſed the worlde, and forgatte them ſelfe. What ſtrokes gaue they to fortune? What delytes for the fleſhe? and howe lyttell ſette they by theyr lyues, and yet more, to ſet ſo ſmall ſtore by deathe? O what bridel was this for the vicious, and what hope for the vertuous, what confuſion for them that loued this lyfe, and what enſaumple, not to feare dethe, haue they left vs? And ſith they diſpiſed their owne propre lyfe: it is then to be thoughte, that they dyed, not to thentent to take other mens goodes, to thynke that our lyfe neuer ſhall haue ende, therfore our couetyſe neuer hath ende. O glorious people, and .x.M. tymes bleſſed, that lefte theyr ſenſualitie, and vanquyſhed theyr natural wyll, beleue not that ye ſe, but gyue faythe to that ye neuer ſawe, as they that ſe nothyng go agaynſt the fatal deſtenies: who goethe agaynſte the waye of fortune, gyue a wrynche to the lyfe, robbe the body at the dethe, wynne honour of the goddis, not that they ſhulde length your lyfe, but to take the reſte of the lyfe. Archagatus ſurgien, and Anthonius the phiſitien, and Eſculapius the father of medicines, I thynke wanne but lyttell in that lande. Who commaunded theſe Barbariens to take ſirope in the mornyng, and to take pylles at night, and to refreſhe them with mylke, to take clere barly to annoynt theyr lyuers, to daye to be lette blode, and to morowe to take a purgation, to eate one thing, and to abſteyn fro many thinges? Than

me thinke, that they beynge of .l. yere of aege, and you of lxxx. at the leaſte, ſhulde be egall with them in wyſedome. And if ye wyll not take deth in good worth, yet at the leeſt, amende the yll lyfe. I remembre well of a long tyme, that Fabricius, our neybour wylled vs, to beware of a mockerie, the whiche if it be not broken, there ſhall folowe great dyſſhonour. And ſith he ſhewed me ſoo good a leſſon, I wyll paye you with the ſame money. I wyll ſhewe it you, if ye poore aged folkes doo not knowe it: ye be ſuche, that your eyes are bleared, your noſes droppynge, your heares whyte, your herynge dulle, your tongue faulterynge, your tethe waggynge, your face wrincled, your fete ſwollen, your ſhuldres croked, and your ſtomake diſtempered, finally if the graues coude ſpeake, they myght ryghtfully calle for you to come, and inhabite in them. Of trouthe it is great compaſſion to beholde yonge ignoraunce, that open theyr eies, to knowe the infortunes of this lyfe, whan it is tyme to cloſe them and to entre into the graue. And therof cometh, that it is in vayne to giue counſaile to vain yong peple. For youth is without experiēce of that it doth, &amp; is ſuſpect of that it hereth, &amp; wyl not beleue that is ſaid, and diſprayſeth other mens coūſel, &amp; is ryght pore of their owne. And therfore I ſaye Claudius and Claudyne, my frendes, I fynde without compariſon, none ſo ylle an ignorance of goodnes, that holdethe theſe yonge perſonnes, as is the obſtinacy of theſe aged perſonnes in yll. The diffinition of yll, is a manne not to knowe that he oughte to knowe, yet it is wors to haue the knowlege of wyſedome, and to lyue lyke a brute beaſte. O ye olde goutye people, ye forgette your ſelfe, and renne in poſte after the lyfe, and ye neuer regarde whatte ſhall falle, tyll ye be ſuche as ye wolde not, and without power to retourne backe: &amp; herof cometh, that ye lacke of lyfe, ye wyll ſupplye it with foly.

Than awake ye that be ſlombringe, haue no force to ſlepe, open your ſlepy eies, and accuſtome you to do well: Take that is nedeful for you: and fynally appoynt you betimes with dethe, or he make execution of your lyfe .Lii. yeres I haue knowen them of the worlde, yet I could neuer know none ſo olde, nor ſo putrifyed in their membres, but that their hartes were hole to thynke vnhappyneſſe, and their tongues hole to make lyes. Take hede, ye poore olde perſons, me thynke ſyth ſomer is paſte, ye haſte forward with the tyme: and if ye tary a ſmall ſeaſon, yet ye make haaſte to take lodgynge. I meane, that though ye haue paſt the day in the ſee with peryl, the nyght of dethe wyll take you at the porte of helthe. Mockes do paſſe with mockynges, and trouth with trouthe: though I haue ſene you ryghte yonge and hardy, nowe I ſe you very olde: Though the knyght paſſe his courſe, yet it is not his faute, yf the hors be not well reyned: but at the ende of his courſe, he wylle trymme his hors. Let not that begyle you, that of cuſtom hath begyled men: That is, ye ſhalbe as wel eſtemed therby, as though ye had moche money. I beleue ye folow diuers, and yet they all haue enuy at you. But truſt me, that at the ende, honour is gyuen to a yonge perſone poore and vertuous, rather than to an olde perſon ryche &amp; vycious. The ryche may haue power to be more eſtemed with pore people, and accompanyed with ryche and couetous: but the vertuous poore perſon, ſhall be better eſtemed and leſſe hated. What can be greatter confuſyon to a perſonne, or more ſhame to our mother Rome, than to ſe in dyuers places, the old people behaue and appoynte theym, as yonge folke, as though they lyke the vyne leaues dyd newly burgein? What thinge is it to ſee the olde perſones, nowe in our dayes, brayde and make fayre theyr whyte heares, trymme and kembe theyr beardes, weare ſtrayte ſhowes,

their hoſen garded, their ſhurtes frounced, their clokes of ſcarlette, their bagges enbrodred, their chaynes of golde about their neckes, fringes of gold and ſyluer about their apparell, eſtrige fethers vppon their hattes lyke grekes, perles and rynges on their fyngers lyke Indiens, theyr gownes long lyke flamine priſtes, and fynally worſt of al, whan dethe hath gyuen them day, than they anſwere that newely they wyll ſerue a lady? O howe many haue I knowen in Rome, that were highly renoumed in their youth, and after through wanton lyghtnes they were but loſte in their age: and worſte of all, they loſte their renowme in their age, and the fauour of their parentes, and the profytte of their chyldren. Certaynly Guagyn Caten of the ancient lynage of the Catons, was in Rome, a prieſt of the lawe .v. yeres, &amp; prouoſt .iii. yeres, and Cenſure .ii. yeres, &amp; dictatour one yere, and Conſule .v. tymes, &amp; whan he was paſte the age of .lxv. yeres, than he began to ſerue Roſane doughter of Gneus Curcius, a lady ryght fayre &amp; yonge: and he doted ſo farre in her loue, that he ſpente all that he had to ſerue her, and wold wepe lyke a chyld whan he ſawe her. It fortuned this lady fell ſycke of a feuer, and ſhe lyſted to eate newe grapes, and it was in ſpringe tyme, whan there was none rype as than in Rome. He ſent for ſome to the felde of Danubius, that was a. M. and .v.C. myle thenſe, and this was ſhewed to the ſenate, and they ordeyned, that Roſana was cloſed in with the virgins veſtales, and the old man was banyſhed perpetually out of Rome, and his chyldren lyued in greatte pouertie, and the father dyed infamed. I beleue that ye haue harde of this. There were dyuers that reputed for a greate vylanye the dede of the olde louer, and prayſed the ſentence of the ſenate. But I thynke if Guagin had had as many yonge perſones in his banyſhement, as there were old amorous perſons that

toke by hym example, I thinke there ſhuld not be ſo many men loſte, nor ſoo many women ſo yll maryed. And therfore the beſt is, that ſuche people, whan they be warned by their ſeruantes, and reproued by their parentes, and deſired by their frendes, that they make not excuſe &amp; ſay, howe they be not amorous, but in mockerye. Whan I was very yōge both of age &amp; wyt, on a night I met with a neyghbor of myn nigh to the capitoll, I was his neuewe &amp; ſon to his ſonne, &amp; ſayd to hym, My lorde Fabricius ye are amorous thus and thus. He anſwered me, I do it but for paſtyme. Certaynly I had meruayle to mete hym at that houre, and I was abaſhed of that anſwere that he gaue me. In them that be ſoore aged and of ſadnes and grauitie, ſuche requeſtes ought not to be called amours, but rather dolours, not a paſtyme, but a loſte tyme, no mockerie but a foolyſhnes. For in loue with mockery, foloweth the trouth of infamie. To the Claudius and Claudine, I demaunde of you olde louers, what is it to be polyſhed and arrayed as ye be ſo gayly, but the bronde of the tauerne, where there is nothynge but vynegre, fayre egges and nothynge in theym, gylte pylles, and bytter in taſte, an olde botell and a newe ſtoppell, a hole wounde rancled vndernethe, the fygure of an oxe to take partriches, a ſlypper way, where no fote is ſure, and fynally an old louer is as a knyght decayd, that helpeth to leſe money, and can helpe no man fro peryll. Of trouth the old lecherous louer is as a ſwyne with a whyte heed and a grene rayle. Than me thynke ye that be my frendes and neyghbours, ye take no hede in breakyng the winges out of ſeſon, whan the fethers be gone: and yet ye begyle me not, to ſay that there is tyme ynough. Beleue me, that that may be done in the daye, leaue it not tylle the nyght of your age. For the blunt knyfe cutteth but yl with the edge, and he that is wont for to eate the fleſhe, can not

eate the boones. Than lette vs comme to the remedye, to redreſſe this dommage, that is, yf that the houſe begyn to falle, ſhore and ſtaye it not with pieces of ſclender tymbre, but with ſtreight pyllers of the lyfe, that we haue to yelde the goddis, and to men by good fame. And if the vyne of all our vertues, be redy to be gathered, at the leaſt lette vs gather that is lefte vs by vnderſtandynge. And ſythe the waters of our reſte, are waſted with our yll werkes, lette vs water them with newe muſte of good deſires, and thā the good goddis wyl be content with the ſeruyces, that we ought to do, for the merytes and rewardes that they do to vs, ſoo that if we deſire, to attayne golde for our warkes, yet to pay vs with the copper of our good deſires. And finally, I ſay to you Claudius and Claudine, if ye haue offred the floure of your youth to vyces, offre nowe at this tyme, the branne of your age to the goddis. I haue wrytten thus largely to you, as I thynke: and bycauſe ye ſhall not be taken as cowardes, nor I for hardy, gyue no parte of this letter to any perſon.
               ¶And I deſyre you to haue me recommended vnto all my neighbours in Rome, namely vnto Druſine the honorable wydowe. I ſende to the two thouſande ſexters, thou ſhalte gyue a thouſande of theym to Gaurina the doughter to thy doughter, I ſende it to her for a pleaſure, whiche ſhe dyd me at a feaſte. Fauſtine my wyfe is very ſycke. Thou ſhalte gyue the other thouſande to the Veſtale virgines, that they may praye for her vnto the goddis. Vnto the Claudine, Fauſtyne my wyfe, ſendeth a coffre, but by the goddis I doo not knowe what there is within it. Nowe that ye be aged, I beſeche the goddis to ſende you and me, and my wyfe, for to ende the reſte of our dayes in a good lyfe. Marke your neyghbour and frende hath writen this with his owne hande.
            
            
               
               A letter ſent fro Mark themperour to Labinia a Romain widowe, for to comfort her for the deth of her huſbande. The .vi. letter.
               
                  MArc of mounte Celio, firſt Conſule Romaine, ſent ageinſt the Daces, to ye Labinia Romain lady, wife to my good frend Claudine, ſalute to the, and conſolation of the goddis conſolatours. I think wel, thou haſt ſuſpect, that I haue ſo lytel ſet by the, ſith in thy profounde and greuous hurtes, my conſolation hath ben ſloutheful. But I remembre thy noblenes, which can neuer faile: and my good wil, the which hath neuer deſired to ſerue the. I am in ſuretie that thy great vertue ſhulde put awaye the ſuſpecte. For thoughe I am the laſte to comforte the, yet I am the firſte that feleth thy dolours, and ſhal not be the laſt to remedye thy troubles. And in caſe that ignorance is the ende of all vertues, eſperance for al vices, as well ſomtime great pleſure taketh away reſt from the wyſe folkes, and ſclandreth the innocentes: moche better amonge vs latyns we fynde with ignorance of vices, more than the grekes do with the knowelege of vertues. If that we be ignorant, we haue no peyne to abide it, nor ſorowe to take it. I ſay it bicauſe I haue knowen, that I wold not knowe, and that is, the trauayles are at an ende of Claudine thy huſband, and nowe beginnethe the ſorowe of Labinia. I haue knowen it certain days, and wold not diſcouer it to the, for it ſhuld haue ben crueltie. She that hath ben in trouble ſo long a ſpace with abſence, that I ſhulde haue gyuen knowlege of the deth of ſuche an entierly deſired huſbande: and it had ben no reſon, that ſhe of whom I haue receyued ſo many good dedis, ſhuld haue of me ſo yll newes. And ſyth the houre yt I knewe, that ye wyſte therof, my peyne hath ben double.

I fele his dethe, and nowe I fele in his deathe my ſolytarines, and thy deſolation. Thou haſte reaſon to wepe, not for that he is with the goddis in reſte, but for vs myſerable perſons, lyuinge in the power of ſoo many ylles, therfore we ſhulde not ceſſe to take peyne and ſorowe. O Labinia, oftentymes I haue thoughte, for what thynge I myght fyrſte wepe, for the yll that lyuethe, or for the good that dieth. For as moche hurteth the yll that is found, as the good that is loſte. It is great peyne to ſee theſe innocentes dye, and ſurely it is no leſſe peyne to ſee the malicious people lyue. But of that that neceſſitie muſte nedes come, whan it cometh we ought not to ſclaundre hit. Shewe me Labinia, doſte thou not knowe of howe good conuerſation the goddes be, to whom we hope to go, and howe yll the men be, with whom we are conuerſaunt, that as the yll are borne to dye, in lyke wyſe the good dyethe to lyue? For a good man alway lyueth in dyenge, and the yll alwayes dyeth in lyuynge. And than ſith the goddis haue cauſed him to come to theym, it is noo greatte thyng that they haue taken fro the. I am in certayne, thy deſyred huſban Claudyn, and my true frende, ſeing where he is, and remembrynge what he hath ſcaped, had rather to be ſtylle there as he is, than to returne agayn to the. Of trouth the remedyes for widowes is not to thynke of any company paſſed, nor of the ſolytarines preſent, but to thynke of the reſt that they hope to come to. If hither vnto thou haſt ben in peine, abidinge in thy houſe, nowe reioyce the bycauſe he abideth for the in his, for thou ſhalt be moche better entreated amonge the goddis, than here amonge men: nor conſent not to thynke, that thou haſte loſte hym all onely. For ſyth we all reioyced of his lyfe, we are than bounde to wepe for his dethe. The greatteſte ſorowe to a ſycke harte amonge all other ſorowes▪ is to ſe other reioyce, at his dolours:

and contrarye wyſe, the greatteſt eaſe amonge all greues of fortune, is to ſee that other feeleth their ſorowe. All that my frende wepeth for me with his eies, and al that he feeleth of my ſorowe, diſchargeth ſomewhat myne inwarde peyne. The bokes in the tyme of Auguſte the emperour ſheweth, howe as he was nere to the ryuer of Danubius, he founde a maner of people, hauynge this cuſtome: The ſame houre whan a huſbande taketh a wyfe, or a louer, they wold ſwere by their goddis, neuer to wepe nor ſorowe for any maner of infortune, but to forget theyr owne propre troubles, and to dye to remedye theyr louer, &amp; ſo in lykewiſe eche to do with other. O glorious worlde, O right happy age, O people of eternall memorie, wherin the men were ſo humble, and their louers ſoo true, that wolde forgette their owne ſorowe, and wepe for others. O Rome beinge Rome, O tyme yll ſpente, O lyfe ylle applied, O ſmall thoughte recheleſſe in theſe dayes, the hartes preſente ſeperate frome welthe, and aſſured withoute remedy in euyll, that men forgettynge that they be menne, tourne them ſelfe to be beaſtes? I deſire to gyue the lyfe, &amp; thou dyeſt to take awaye my lyfe: Thou wepeſt to ſee me laugh, and I laugh to ſe the wepe. And thus without profite of any of vs we leſe, and we reioyce in leſynge of our ſelfe. By the lawe of an honeſt man I ſwere to the Labynia, yf thy remedy lay in my handes, as thy ſorowe dothe at my harte, thy pytiefulle wepynges ſhoulde not hurte me, nor thy heuy and wofull ſolitarynes of thy huſbande: but ſyth thy remedy and my deſyre can not be accomplyſſhed, and that with deathe, nor with them that be deed we haue no power: than remyt it into the handes of the goddis, who can moche better delyuer vs than we can chuſe. We ſee by experience naturall, that ſome ſyckeneſſe is healed by wordes, that be ſayde to vs, and ſomme by wordes

that be layde to vs, and ſome with wordes do leaue other medicines. I ſay this, bycauſe the hartes that be in peyne make a ſee of thoughtes, ſomtyme comforted with benefites done to the perſone, more than with wordes ſpoken in their eares: an other tyme the ſorowfull harte is more cō
                  forted with wordes of a frende, than with all other ſeruyces of the worlde. O how ſorowfull am I, for in all theſe am I fauty, conſyderynge the hyghnes of the honourable lady Romayn, and the ſmall abilitie of me Marc of moūt Celio? I ſee my ſelfe ſo vnable to comforte the, and to remedy the I lacke ſubſtance, I haue made the a ſore woūd, the whiche wolde be taken in worthe. I wyll not paye the with ynke and paper, that whiche I may do with my perſone: for he that gyueth counſell with wordes, may remedy with workes, if he ſhewe hym ſelfe a frend in tyme paſt not taken in ſuſpecte to be an ennemye in tyme to come. If thou haſt reputed me hytherto for thy neyghbour and parent to thy huſbande, I praye the nowe to take me for thy huſbande in loue, and for thy father in counſayle, and for ſonne in ſeruyce, and for aduocate in the Senate, in ſuche maner that I hope thou ſhalte ſay, all that I haue loſte in many, I haue founde in Marke alone. And bycauſe that in greuous conflyctes, where as crafte and ſubtyltie is forgotten, the vnderſtandynge is altered, and the reaſone withdrawen, thanne there is as moche neceſſytie of good counſell as of a meane remedy. Claudyne nowe deed was my frende, and I Marc alyue am his, and alſo by thy deſeruynge thou mayſte commaunde me what thou wylte: and for the loue that I haue to the, thou mayſte deſyre of me any thynge nedefull. I pray the eſchewe the extremitie of the Romayne wydowes. For in al extremities lyeth the vyce, for al ſuche werieth them ſelfe, and anoyeth the goddis, and leſe them that be aliue, &amp; do no profit to them that

be deed, but gyue ſuſpection to them yt be yl, as dyd Fuluia wife to noble Marc Mercello, ſhe ſeing her huſbande buried in the felde of Mars, ſcratched her vyſage, &amp; tare her heer, &amp; brake her tethe, &amp; at euery pace ſwowned, &amp; two ſenatours held her by the armes, bycauſe ſhe ſhuld not hurt her ſelf. Thā ſaid Flauiꝰ Cenſurius, let her alone, for this day ſhe wyl folow the iourney of widowes, &amp; ſo it was, for whiles yt the bones of Marcello were a brennyng, ſhe was intreting to mary an other huſbād, &amp; yet more to be noted, one of the ſenatours yt led her, gaue her his hande, as one Romain to an other by perpetual mariage. This caſe was ſo foule, &amp; takē of euery mā for a great vilany, &amp; all the Romains there preſent were abaſhed, &amp; were in ſuſpect neuer after to beleue wydowe in Rome. I ſay not this Labinia, bycauſe thou wylt do ſo: for by the god Mars I ſwere, the hart of Marc hath of the no ſuch ſuſpect, nor thy great age wyll not ſuffre it, nor the auctoritie of ſoo ſadde a matrone wyll demande it. I require the ryght hartily, forgette nat the honeſtie that ought to be in a Romayn woman, nor retrayte that is requiſite in a wydowe. For yf thou be a wydowe of ſolytarines, that thou feleſt by hym that is deed, than comfort the of the reputation that is holden of the by them that be lyuing. I wyl ſay no more to the at this tyme but that thy renome may be ſuche with all men, to caſt ſuche a brydel vpon them that be yll, to cauſe them to be ſtil, and to theym that be good to gyue theym ſpurres to ſerue the. And if ye wyll thus do, take no thought for any beſines that ye haue in the ſenate. My wyfe Fauſtyn greteth the, and oftentymes wepeth for this myſaduenture. I ſend the money to pay thy creditours. The goddis that haue gyuen reſte to Claudine thy huſbande, gyue comforte and conſolation to Labinia his wyfe. Marc of mounte Celio hath writen this with his owne hande.
            
            
               
               ¶A letter ſent by Marc themperour to Cyncinatus his frend, bycauſe he beinge a gentylman became a marchant. The .vii. letter.
               
                  MArc Edilis Cenſure, to the Cincinatus of Capue ſende ſalutation for thy perſon, force and vertue ayenſt ſiniſter fortune. Syth the feaſt Bereſcinte, mother of the goddis, I haue ſene no ſeruaunte of thy houſe, nor letter of thy hand, that I haue redde, the whiche putteth me in great ſuſpection of thy helthe, and that thou arte in ſome peryll, or els thou diſprayſeſt our amitie. Dyſchargynge not thy ſelfe with ſoo lyttell thoughte, nor forgette vs not with ſo great recheleſnes: for thy trauaille can not be ſoo moche in writinge, as it ſhuld be conſolation to me to rede thy letters, and if thy hande waxe ſtowe frome trauaylle of writynge, yet enforce myn harte for myn eaſe, wherin is ſemblaunt of true frendes. In that I wyll put the fro annoyaunce, and thou to do me pleaſure: thou knoweſt wel the ſmal diſtaunce that is betwene Capue and mount Celio, was not the cauſe of our frendeſhyppe, but the ſpace hens to Illirico ſhuld not cauſe vs to be ſtraungers. The delycate wynes ſent out of theyr owne countrey to ſtraungers take the greatter myght: and the ferther that the perſons of true frendes be ſeperate, the ſooner they oughte to vnyte &amp; ioyne together their myndes. Shewe me I pray ye Cyncinate, ſyth thou haſt euer founde me true, why haſte thou any ſuſpecte of my deſyre? The grene leus outwarde ſhewethe, that the tree is not drye inwarde: and the good werkes openly notifieth the inward hart ſecretly. Where it is not perfite, there is always breakyng and faylyng in

ſeruice: for he that perfytly loueth, perpetually and faythfully ſerueth. And I am as moche aſtonied of thy ſlouthe, in demaundynge ſomwhat of me, as of thy couwardyſe to write. I wyl confeſſe to the one trouthe, if thou haddeſte as moche hardynes as wyll and thought of the ſmalle effecte of my letter myght ſatiſfie to the greatenes of thyne vnderſtandynge, it ſhulde abyde than for yll done, but not for ſhorte, as he that throweth his ſpeare. In tyme paſte whan I was yonge, and thou old, thou in thy counſayles, &amp; I wich my money eche gaue to other: but at this houre, that thy heed is whyte, men reken the to be olde, &amp; yet thy workes accuſe the to be yonge. Reaſon is that I ſuccour thy pouertie with money, &amp; to remedy thy lyghtenes with councel. For the good wyll that I haue to the, and for the lawe of amitie that I owe to the, I wyll aduertiſe the as a vertuous man ought to do, and that is to remembre the benefites that he hath receyued, and to forget the iniuries doone to hym: eſteme moche his owne ſmalle power, and holde the greatnes of other at nothyng: fauour the good, and diſſimule with the euyll: be great with the greatteſt, and communicable with your inferiours: preſentlye doo good dedes, and alſo of them that be abſent ſpeake good wordes: The greuous loſſes of fortune, holde theym in ſmall eſtemation, and the ſmal loſſe of honour, holde that in great eſtemation, for one thynge aduenture not money, and for dyuers doubtfull aduenture not a certaintie: and finally be frende to one and ennemie to none. Theſe thinges ought he to haue, that amonge good wyll be accompted good. I knowe well thou haſt lefte to be pretour of the warre, and nowe thou haſte ſette thy ſelfe by lande and by ſee to vſe marchandyſe. Thou makeſt me ſore abaſhed, to conquere thyn enmies as a Romayn, and nowe to take on the, the office, to perſecute thy frendes as a tyrant. Wylte

thou do yll to thy neyghbours, and leaue the ſtraungers? Wylt thou take away the liuynge fro hym that gyueth vs liuing, &amp; take away the deth fro him that taketh away our lyfe? wilt thou to them that be mouers and ſtrangers giue moderation, &amp; fro them that be ſobre take away their reſt? Thou wylt gyue to them that take awaye fro vs, and take fro them that gyue vs: delyuer them that be condemned, and condempne innocentes. Thou wylt be tyraunt to the common welth, and not defender of thy countreye. Than ſithe to all this he aduentureth hym that leaueth dedes of armes, and becometh a marchaunte: I ſtudye ſoore what hath meued the to leaue chiualrye, wherin thou haſte had great honour, and nowe to take on the an offyce, wherby foloweth ſo moche ſhame and rebuke. Surely I thynke in the none other excuſe, but that thou art olde, and canſt not clymbe the mountaynes, and nowe thou ſytteſt ſtylle, and robbeſt the playnes. To olde men olde malady, whan outwarde force fayleth theym, than forthwith they arme them with malyce inwarde. I ſaye it by the ſoore couetous perſons as thou act now. One thynge I wyll ſay, thou haſte taken an office, wherby all thy felowes haue robbed in dyuers days, thou ſhalt gyue accompte therof in one howre, ye and after the tyme ſhall come, that thou ſhalt leſe all in a moment. For the goddis permyt, that one ſhall be a chaſtyſement of dyuers, and longe tyme chaſtyſeth all. Howe is it my frende Cyncinate, that in the howſe of thy father Cyncinate were ſpeares, and not writynges hangynge? I haue ſene his halle full of armure, &amp; not of fardels: and portall and gates ful of knightes, &amp; not marchantis. Certaynly there haue I ſene the ſcole of noblenes, and not as it is now the denne of theues. O Cincinate, curſed be ſo vilayn an office, the marchātis lyue porely to dye ryche: &amp; let vs ſay ageyn, curſed be it, bycauſe the couetyſe of one that

is yll, wold be accompliſhed to the preiudice of many that be good. I wyll not hurte the by thy predeceſſours, but I wyl aduertiſe the of thy miſerie and of thy ſucceſſours. If thou thynkeſt, yt thy vertue ſhulde holde to the ende of the worlde, as the worlde holdeth to the, as hit ſemeth by thy white heares, holde me excuſed of the trauayle in perſwadynge the to here me. How be it, it is reſon, that the gate of ſo great a cauſe be knocked at with the hāmer of ſom warnyng, &amp; to bring it to good reſon, of neceſſitie it muſt paſſe the myll: and to make clere the vnderſtandyng from tyme to tyme, of very nede there requireth counſell. Dyuers times wiſe men fayle, bycauſe they wold faile, but if the thinges be of ſuche qualitie, that wyſedom ſuffiſeth not to aſſure them, than it is nedefull, that his wyll be vntyed, and his vnderſtandyng diſſolued, and his owne propre opinion voyd, &amp; than incontynent to take a threde to the aduyſe of an other. Take good hede Cincinate, where as the foū
                  dations be not wel edified, the buildinges ar in peryl. The dongeon of this world, wherin the children of vanite do abyde, is founded on the ſande. For let it be neuer ſo ſumptuous, yet a lyttell blaſte of wynde wyll cauſe it to ſhake, and a lyttell heate of proſperitie wyll open it, and a lyttell rayne of aduerſitie wyll diuide it, and within a ſhort while or ſpace, whan we leaſt take hede, it wyll fall all flatte on ye erth. If the pyllers be of ſyluer, and benches of gold, and though the benchers be kynges, and continue a thouſand yere, and rule into the entrayles of the erthe: yet they can fynde no ſtedfaſte rocke nor mountayne, wherin to clooſe the goodes of their predeceſſours, and their eſtates perpetuall. The goddis immortall haue made all thinges communicable to men mortall, excepte immortalitie: and therfore they be called immortall, bicauſe they neuer dye, &amp; we be called mortall and faylyng, bycauſe we al take an ende.

Howe ſtronge ſo euer the walles be, yet great age cauſeth it to fall to ruine. Two thinges ſemeth to be free, the whiche fortune can not ſet abacke, nor the tyme cauſe to be forgotten, &amp; they be theſe: The good or yll renoume amonge men, and the peyne or rewarde that they that be good or yll haue of the goddis. O my frende Cyncinate, thus acheueth the perſones, but the goddis neuer. What grene or rype or rotten holdeth any ſeaſon the fruyte of the tree floured? I eſteme it nothynge, bycauſe it muſte die by nature. Howe be it dyuers tymes in leaues and flowers we beare the froſte of ſome malady, or the blaſte of ſome enuious myſhap. Longe is the webbe in makyng: but it that is made in many days, is cut aſonder in a moment: Semblably it is a piteous thing to ſee a man dye with ſo great trauayle, and to be ſette in the ſtate of honour, and afterwarde we, regardynge neyther the one nor the other, and yet we ſe it periſh. And without any memory of any thing abydynge. O my frende Cyncinate, for the loue betwene vs I pray the, and by the immortal goddis I coniure the, beleue not the worlde, the whiche vnder the colour of a lyttell golde, hydeth moche fylthyneſſe: and vnder colour of trouthe chaungeth vs into a. M. lyes: and for a ſhort delyte gyueth vs a. M. diſpleaſures. To them whom it ſheweth moſte loue, it begyleth with greatteſt tromperies: to whom the worlde gyueth moſte goodes, it procureth moſt domages: to them that ſerueth it with mockeries, hit rewardeth with true recompences: and to them that loue it truly, it gyueth them goodes of mockeries: finally whan we ſlepe mooſte ſureſt, it waketh vs with greatte perylle. What wylte thou ſay than of the worlde, ſhewe me? One thynge I wyll telle the, and me thynke thou ſhuldeſte not forgette it: and that is, we ought not to beleue the vayne vanities that we ſe with our eies, rather than the greatte

meruayles that we here with our eres. One thing I haue regarded, and by longe experience I haue knowen it, that but a fewe howſes paynted nor ſtalles raiſed vp, we haue ſene in Rome: but of a ſmall tyme they take no thoughte for the walles, but they haue cruelle enmities with theyr neyghbours, and great anoy of their heyres, and importunate ſhame of their frendes, and double malyce of their ennemies, and enuious profite in the ſenate, &amp; ſomtyme to put a gouernour out of poſſeſſion, they ſet foure in honor: and finally all that with great thought haue be gathered for their childe, whom they loue wel with great reſt, ſometyme an other heire enioyeth it, of whom they thynke leeſt. It is a iuſte ſentence, that ſuche as begyle diuers with yll dedes in their lyfe, ſhuld be begiled of their vayn thoughtes at their deth. Cruell ſhulde the goddis be, and ryghte greuous for men to ſuffre, that the ylle that hath gathered for one heire in the p̄iudice of dyuers that be good, ſhuld enioye it many yeres. Me thinke it ſhulde be a ſouerayne folye to be borne wepynge, to dye ſyghynge, and to lyue laughynge. The rule to gouerne all partes ought to be egall. O Cincinate, who hath begyled the, that for a potte full of water, thou haſte nede of a greatte laake of this world to paſſe this wretched lyfe? Wylt thou flay away the ſkynne of thy handes with the corde of thoughtes, breake thy body in bataylle with great trauayle, and aduenture thyne honour for one potte of water? What wylte thou more that I ſhulde ſay? but that to fyl a potte of thy goodes thou wylt ſuffre a. M. perylles. And in the vyle exercyſing of thy marchandyſe, thou doubteſt not for leſynge of thy credence. And fynally I ſweare to the, thou ſhalt abyde deed for thurſte, as thoughe there were no water in the feldes. If thou wylt do by my counſell, deſyre deathe of the goddis, to reſte the as an aged wyſe man: and demaunde

not rycheſſe to lyue yll as a yonge foole. I haue ſoore wepte for many, that I haue ſene in Rome departed oute of this worlde, and for the I haue wepte droppes of blode, to ſe the retourne newly &amp; vylely to the worlde. My amitie and the credite of the ſenate, the bloude of thy predeceſſours, the auctoritie of thy perſon, and the honour of the countreye oughte to refrayne thy couetouſneſſe. Oh frende, thy whyte heares ſheweth honour and wyſedome, the whiche ſhuld exerciſe and be occupied in noble dedes. Regarde, It auayleth more to folowe reaſon by the ways of them that be good, than the cōmon opinyon, whiche is the large way of them that be yll. For though the one be ſtrayte for the fete, it reiſeth no duſte for to blynde the eies, as the other dothe, to lyghte younge perſons, the whyche procure lyghtneſſe, ignoraunce excuſeth them: but the diſordinate couetyſe of the olde perſones, cauſeth theym to occupie their lyfe with trauayle, and to take deathe with great annoyaunce, and in the one as welle as in the other abydeth great infamy. O Cyncinate, take this counſayle of a frende: Charge not thy ſelfe with takynge of theſe vayne goodes, ſyth thou haſte ſoo ſmalle a morſelle of thy lyfe. For ſuche as thou arte, we ſee conſume, and waſte, and not to quicken. Put no truſt in frendes in the preſent proſperitie, for it is a pronoſtication of an euyll fortune. And ſythe thou arte in a haſarde lyke a foole, me thynke thou oughteſt to diſcende a foote lyke a ſage perſon. And thus euery man wyll ſaye, howe Cincinate is diſcended, and not fallen. I wyll ſay no more, but the goddis be thy ſauegarde, and defende bothe the and me frome gylefulle fortune. My wyfe Fauſtyne ſaluteth the, and ſhe is withdrawen frome me, bycauſe I wrote this letter to the, and hathe coniured me to write this worde to the, that is, ſhe ſaythe thou oughteſt to haue wytte whan thy necke is full

of heare, and I thynke thou oughteſte in continente to take a barber &amp; ſhaue away the heare, that thy wytte maye come forth. I wold thy couetyſe ſhuld forſake the, and foly Fauſtin, and the gowte me, and the ſoner our ſoules may departe fro our fleſhe, than gile ſhuld remayne in our hartes. Marc of mount Celio writeth this with his hande.
            
            
               ¶A letter ſente fro Marc the emperour to Catulus cenſorious, that was ſorowfull for the deth of his ſonne Veriſſimus The .viii. letter.
               
                  MArc cenſore newe and yonge, ſalute and reuerence to the Catulus cenſorius olde and auncient. I haue writen two letters to the, &amp; thou haſte made aunſwere to none of them. If it be bycauſe thou couldeſt not, I holde my peace: If it be bycauſe thou woldeſt not, than I complayne me: If it be for forgetfulnes, thā I accuſe the: If it be bycauſe thou ſetteſte lyttelle by me, than I appeale the: If thou haſte dreamed, that thou haſte wrytten, I ſaye beleue not in dreames: And if thou wylte not it ſhulde vayle to glorifie me as a frende, yet thou mighteſt take it write in aduertiſinge &amp; repreuynge as the father to the ſon. Yong vertuous perſons are bounde to honour aunciente wiſe men, &amp; no leſſe old wyſe men ought to endoctrine the yong people and very yonge, as I am. A iuſte thynge it is, that the new forces of youth ſupply &amp; ſerue them that are worne by age. For theyr longe experience mocketh our tender age &amp; natural ignorance. youth is yl applied, when it ſurmōteth the force of the body, &amp; faylleth the vertues of the ſoule: &amp; age is honored, wherin the force dyeth outwarde, wherby vertues quickneth the more inward. we may ſe the tre whē the fruite is gadered the leues fal, and whan flowers dry,

than more grene and perfyte are the rotes. I meane that whan the firſt ſeaſon of youth is paſſed, which is the Somer tyme, than cometh aege called wynter, and putrifieth the fruite of the fleſhe, and the leaues of fauour falle, and the floures of delyte are wyddered, and the vynes of hope dried outwarde, than it is right, that moche better the rotes of good workes within be good. They that be old and auncient ought to prayſe theyr good werkes rather than theyr white heares. For honour ought to be gyuen for the good lyfe, and not for the whyte heade. Glorious is that common welthe, and fortunate is that prince, that is lord of yonge men to trauayle, and ancient perſons to counſel. As to regarde the ſuſteynyng of the naturalitie of the life, in lykewiſe ought to be conſydered the polycie of gouernaunce, the whiche is that al the fruites come nor drie not al at ones, but whan one beginneth an other fayleth. And in this maner ye that be auncient teachynge vs, and we obedient, as olde fathers and yonge pullettes, beynge in the neſte of the ſenate: Of ſome their fethers fallyng, and other yonge fethered: and where as the olde fathers can not flye, their trauaylles are maynteyned by theyr tender chyldren. Frende Catulus, I purpoſed not to write one lyne this yere, bycauſe my penne was troubled with thy ſlouthe: but the ſmalleneſſe of my ſpirite, and the greatte peryll of myn offices always called on me to demande thy counſell. This priuilege the olde wyſe men holde in their houſes where they dwelle: They are alwayes lordes ouer them that be ſymple, and are ſclaues to them that be wyſe. I thynke thou haſte forgotten me, thynkynge that ſythe the dethe of my dere ſonne Veriſſimus, the tyme hath ben ſo longe, that I ſhulde forgette it. Thou haſt occaſion to thynke ſo, for many thynges renneth in tyme, that reaſon can not helpe. But in this caſe I can not tel whiche is the

greatteſt, thy trumperie or my dolour. I ſweare to the by the goddis immortall, that the hungry wormes in the entrayles of the vnhappy chylde, are not ſo puiſante, as are the cruell dolours in the harte of the father ſore wounded. And it is no compariſon, for the ſon is ded but one tyme▪ &amp; ye heuy father dieth euery moment. What wilt thou more that I ſhulde ſay? but that one ought to haue enuy of his deth, &amp; compaſſiō of my life, bicauſe in dienge he lyueth, &amp; in lyuinge I die. In yl fortunes in caſe of lyfe, &amp; in ye ſubtyl aduerſities of fortune, where as her gyles profiteth but lyttell, and her ſtrength leſſe, I thinke the beſte remedy is to fele it as a man, and diſſimule it as diſcrete and wiſe. If all thynges as they be felte at harte ſhulde be ſhewed outwarde with the tonge, I thynke that the wyndes ſhoulde breake the harte with ſighinges, and water all the erthe with wepynge. O if the corporall eies ſawe the hurt of the hart with a true wound, I ſwere to the, there they ſhuld ſe more of a droppe of bloudde ſweatynge within, thanne all the wepynge that is made out warde. There is no comparyſon of the great dolours of the bodye, to the leeſt peyne that the ſpirite feleth. For all trauayle of the body, menne may fynde ſome remedy, but if the heuy harte ſpeke, it is not harde: if it wepe, it is not ſene: if it complayne hit is not beleued. What ſhall the poore harte do? Abhorre the lyfe, wherwith it dieth: and deſire deth, wherwith it liueth. The high vertues amonge noble vertuous people conſyſtethe not al only to ſuffre the paſſions of the body, but alſo to diſſimule them of the ſowle. They be ſuche that alter the humours, and ſhewe hit not outwarde: They brynge a feuer without alterynge the of poulce: They alter the ſtomake: They make vs to knele to the erthe, to ſuffer the water vp to the mouth, &amp; to take death with out leauynge of the lyfe: And fynally they lengthe our lyfe, to thentente

that we ſhulde haue the more trauaylle, and denyethe vs our ſepulture to thentente that we ſhulde not reſte vs. But conſideringe. If I be troubled with tribulations, as well am I lette with conſolations. For euer I haue either deſyre of the one, or werynes of the other. I take this remedye to diſſimule with the tongue, and to wepe with the eyes▪ and to 
                     •
                  ele it with my harte. I paſſe my lyfe, as he that hopethe to leſe all that he hathe, and neuer to recouer that is lost. I ſay this▪ though ye ſe me not now make funerall wepynges and waylynges, as I dyd at the deth of my ſonne, yet thynke not but it doth brenne my hart, ſo that with the inwarde greatte heate is conſumed the humyditie of the eies outwarde, for it brennethe all my ſpyrites inwarde. Thou mayſte knowe what an honourable father ſuffrethe to leſe a good chylde: In all thynges the goddes be lyberall, excepte in gyuynge vs vertuous chyldren. Where there is aboundaunce of great eſtates, there is greatteſt ſcarſitie of good inheritours. It is a great hurte to here, and greatter to ſee, howe theſe fathers clyme to haue ryches, and to ſee their chyldren diſcende to haue vycyouſenes: To ſe the fathers honour theyr chyldren, and the chyldren to infame theyr fathers: yea and the fathers to gyue reſt to theyr chyldren, and the children to gyue trouble to their olde fathers: yea and ſometyme the fathers dye for ſorowe that theyr children dye ſo ſoone, and we ſe the chyldren wepe bycauſe theyr fathers dye ſoo late. What ſhulde I ſaye more, but that the honour and riches that the fathers haue procured with great thought, the chyldren loſe with lyttell care. I am certayne of one thynge, that the fathers may gather ryches with ſtrength and crafte, to ſuſteyne theyr chyldren, but the goddis wyll not haue durable that that is begon with euyll intention, and is founded to the preiudice of other, and is poſſeſſed

with an euyll heire. And though the heuy deſtenies of the fader permit, that the riches be left to their childrē to ſerue them in all their vyces for their paſtyme, at laſt according to their merites, the goddis wyll that the heire &amp; heritage ſhulde peryſhe. Marke what I ſay, I hadde two ſonnes, Comode &amp; the prince Veriſſimus, the yonger is dead, that was greateſt in vertue. Alway I imagined, that while the good lyued, I ſhuld be pore: &amp; now that the yl remaineth, I thynke to be ryche. I ſhall ſhewe the why, the goddis ar ſo pitieful, that to a pore father they neuer giue yl chyld: &amp; to a riche father they neuer giue a good child. And as in al proſperite alway there falleth ſome ſiniſter fortune, either ſoone or late, ſo therwith fortune doth arme &amp; apparel vs, wherin ſhe ſeeth we ſhal fal to our greatteſt hurt. And therfore the goddis permit, that the couetous faders in gaderyng with great trauayle ſhuld die with that hurt, to leue their riches to their vicious childrē yll implied. I wepe as moch for my child yt the goddis haue left me, as for him yt they haue taken fro me. For the ſmall eſtimation of hym yt liueth maketh immortal memory of him yt is deed. The yl reſt &amp; cōuerſation of them that liue, cauſe vs to ſigh for the company of them that be deed. The yll is alwaye deſired for his ilnes to be deed, &amp; the good alway meriteth to haue his deth bewailed. I ſay my frend Catulus, I thought to haue loſt my wit, whā I ſaw my ſon Veriſſime dye: but I toke comfort ayen: for either he of me, or I of him muſt ſe the ende. Cōſidering that the goddis dyd but lend him to me &amp; gaue him not, &amp; how they be inheriters, &amp; I to haue ye vſe of the fruit. For al thing is meſured by the iuſt wyll of the goddes, &amp; not by our diſordinate wyls &amp; appetites. I thinke whā they toke away from me my chylde, I reſtored hym to an other, &amp; not that they haue taken myn. But ſith it is the wyll of the goddis to gyue reſt to the good childe,

and hurte the father bycauſe he is yll, I yelde thankes to them: for the ſeaſone that they haue ſuffered me to enioye his lyfe: And for the pacyence that I haue taken for his deth, I deſire them to mytigate therwith the chaſtiſement of their yre. And I deſyre, ſyth they haue taken away the lyfe from this chylde, to cauſe good cuſtomes to be in the prince myne other ſonne. I knowe what heuyneſſe thou haſte take in Rome for my ſorowe. I pray to the goddis to ſende the ioye of thy chylderne, and that I maye rewarde the with ſome toye, for that thou haſte wept for my peyne. My wife Fauſtine ſaluteth the: and thou woldeſt haue cō
                  paſſyon to ſe her: For ſhe wepeth with her eies, and ſygheth with her harte, and with her handes hurteth her ſelfe, and curſeth with her tonge. She eateth nothynge on the daye, nor ſlepeth in the nyght. She loueth darkenes, and abhorreth lyght, and therof I haue no meruayle: for it is reaſone, that for that was nouriſhed in her entrayles, ſhe ſhulde fele ſorowe in the ſame. And the loue of the mother is ſoo ſtronge, though her chylde be deed and layde in ſepulture, yet always ſhe hath him quicke in her harte. It is a generall rule, that the perſon that is entierly beloued, cauſeth euer great grefe at the deth. And as for me I paſſe the lyfe ryght ſorowfully: though I ſhewe a ioyfull face, yet I want myrth at my harte. And amonge wyſe men beynge ſorowfulle, and ſhe wynge their faces mery, is none other thynge but burienge the quicke, hauynge no ſepulture. And I ſweare by the goddis immortal, I fele moch more than I haue ſayde. And dyuers tymes me thynke I ſhuld fal downe, bycauſe I dare not wepe with myne eies, yet I fele it inwardly. I wolde fayne common with the in dyuers thynges. Come I pray the to Bryette, to thentent that we maye ſpeake to gether. And ſythe it hath pleaſed the goddis to take my chylde fro me, that I loued ſo well,

I wolde counſell with the, that art my louyng frend. But fewe dayes paſſed, there came hyther an ambaſſadour fro the Rodes, to whom I gaue the moſte part of my horſes: and fro the fartheſt part of Spayne, there were broughte me .viii. of whiche I ſende the .iiii. I wolde they were ſuche, as myght pleaſe the. The goddis be thy ſafegard, and ſende me, and my wyfe ſome ioye. Marcus Aurelius right ſorowfull, hath written this with his owne hande.
            
            
               ¶A letter ſent by Marc the emperour, to Marcurino being at Sanny, nowe called Benauente. The .ix. letter.
               
                  MY ſpeciall frende and auncient companion, a meſſanger of thyne, and a lackeye of myne, wente out togyther at Capue, the one bare my deſyre and affection to the, and the other broughte a letter to me. And if thou loke well, thou mayſte ſee my hart as full of thoughtes, as I ſe thy letter full of complayntes. Thou doſt ſende to comfort me in my feuer tercyan, I thanke the greately therof, and it is come in a good ſeaſon. For the goynge of the feuer out of my poulſe, and the ioy of thy letter to my ſpirite, is all one. And ſurelye if this caſe be lefte in my hande, and that my feuer retourne not, thā thy conſolation ſhal ſerue. Lo beholde the miſerie of man, that preſumethe to take away realmes from other, and yet cā not take the feuer out of my bones. Thou knoweſt well, that we loue togyther, and of a longe ſeaſon thyn amitie hath truſted in me. My trouthe byndethe me, that thyne ylles ſhoulde be myne, and my goodes thyne. And there is trewe loue, where be

two bodies ſeperate, and but one hart togither. And there is but a bytter loue, where the hartes be as ferre aſonder, as the ſtraungenes of their perſones. Take hede I praye the, that our loue be not inuenimed with vnkyndnes, nor our remembrance enpoyſoned with ſmall thoughtes, and I beinge an other than thou arte here, &amp; thou beinge an other than I am there, in maner that myn abſence with thy preſence, and my preſence with thy abſence, may ſpeake to gither. Thy meſſager hath ſhewed me the loſſe of thy goodes, and by thy letter, I knowe the anguyſſhe of thy perſonne. And it hath ben ſhewed me, that thou haſte hadde a ſhyppe peryſhed, and that thy factours, lyke wyſe men, to ſaue theyr perſonnes, dydde throwe thy marchandyſe in to the ſee. Me thynke, thy ſhyppe hathe eaſed the of thy charge. But I thinke, as it ſemeth by the, they threwe not ſo many fardels into the ſee, as thought is into thy harte. And accordynge as thou were before, I ſhoulde be moore bounde to ſerche for thy leade and tynne, thanne for thy harte. Thy leade is ſonken to the bottome, but thy counſell is ſprede abroode ouer all the worlde. If thou ſhouldeſte nowe dye, and thy bodye be opened, of trouthe I thynke, that thy hart ſhuld be rather found drowned with thy leade, than alyue with thy body. O Mercurius, atte this houre thou feleſt no maladye of any feuer tercian, as I doo, for the harte of thy bodye, and the dolour of thy ſpirite, cauſeth the to haue a quartayne. And this euyll is not in the body, but in the ſhyppe, not on the erthe, but in the ſee: not with phiſitions, but philoſophers. I coūſayle the to ſeke helth: For there thy lyfe is drowned, where thy leade is ſonken. Be not angry, for though thou haſte not thy leade with the, thy leade hath the with it. Ofte tymes auarice ſeketh out the auaricious, and ſomtyme the auaricious ſeke auarice. I
                     •••
                   ſhewed me, thou arte ſory, bycauſe

thy domage can haue no remedy: and doeſt thou not know, that where no remedy is, thou oughteſt to take pacience? O Mercurius, nowe thou knoweſte, yt whan thou diddeſt aduenture thy goodes to the ſuſpecious rockes, &amp; thy deſyres to the depe wawes of the ſee, and thy couragious auarice, to the importunate wyndes, and thy leed to ſtraunge waters, and as ioyous, and deſirous as thy factours went forth, in truſte of wynnynge, as moche nowe thou art ſure of the loſſe: and thus is thy deſire drowned, and thy hope ſcaped. Doeſt thou not remembre, that Socrates, caſtinge into the ſee, not leade, but golde, not a lytell, but a great deale, not goodes of other mennes, but of his owne, not by fortune, but by his wyſedome, ſayde, I wyll drowne theſe gylefull richeſſes, to thentent that they ſhall not drowne me? But I thinke, if a man ſhould ſe the do ſo, he ſhulde here the ſay: O my ſwete rycheſſes, I had rather drowne my ſelfe, thā other ſhuld drowne you? This auncient wiſe man durſt not truſt in golde, and thou wylt truſt on leade: caſt lottes among your goddis, he of Athenes, and thou of Rome, which of you hath moſt failed, or els is moſte aſſured? he, that caſt his gold from the erth, in to theſe, orelles thou that woldeſt brynge thy leade out of theſe vpon the erth? I knowe, that the ancient Romains wyl ſay, it is he, and the preſent couetous folke wyll ſaye, it is thy ſelfe. and I thynke, in this thou art diſprayſed in the prayſe therof, and the diſprayſed is alowed of all men. Thy meſſager tolde me, that thou were right ſorie and heuy, and crieſte out in the nyghte, callynge on the goddes, and wakeſte thy neyghbours, complaynynge on fortune. I am ſoore dyſpleaſed for thy heuines, bycauſe ſorowe is nexte frende to thy ſolytarines, and ennemy to company, and heyre of deſperation. I am ſorye for thy cryenges in the nyghte: for it induſeth foly. For the nyght, couerynge

all the worlde with derknes, thou alone wylt diſcouer thy harte with crienges. I am not pleſed, that thou cōplayneſt vpon the goddes, bicauſe they haue taken ſome thing fro the: bycauſe thou that were aloft, they haue broughte lower: Nor I am not pleſed, that thou awakeſt thy neighbours for thy ryches, that cauſed them to enuy the: thy pacience ſhuld moue them to cōpaſſion. Nor I am not cōtēt, that thou ſhuldeſt ſo complayne on fortune: for the thinge ſo wel knowē of many, ſhuld not be infamed by one alone. O Mercurius remēbre, that with them, with whom truce is taken, thou wylt entre agayn into the field of defiance. We vnbend, and thou wylt ſpend thy ſperes. Thou neuer cameſt into the fielde, and yet thou woldeſte enioy the tryumph. Al be ſtopped, and thou woldeſt paſſe ſurely. Thou yeldeſt thy ſelfe to fortune, and doeſt thou not knowe, how ſhe beteth downe the high wals, and defendeth the old roten houſes, and peopleth where there lacketh people, and vnpeopleth where as peple be? Of enimies ſhe maketh frē
                  des, and of frendes enmies, and diſpoileth the vāquiſhers, and crowneh them that be ouercom. Of traitours, ſhe maketh true men, and trewe menne ſhe maketh ſuſpecte perſons. And fynally, fortune is ſuche a mayſtreſſe, that ſhe ruleth realmes, ouercommeth armies, beateth downe kinges, exalteth tyrantes, to the deed ſhe gyueth lyfe, and to ſome renoume, and to ſome ſhame. Why ſtyckeſt thou to her? Doeſt thou not remembre the worde, that the kyng of the Lacedemoniens hadde at his gate, ſayenge, This houſe is at the puttynge downe of fortune. In good ſothe theſe were hyghe wordes, and of greatte vnderſtandyng, he knewe fortune moche better than thou, ſith he rekeneth his houſe at fortunes diſpoſition, and not for enheritance. And if he hadde loſte any thynge, as thou haſte doone, he thoughte, that ſhe reſtored it to other as theyrs, and had

not taken his. Reaſon holdeth confidence, to argue thy treaſon, by that ſhe depoſeth the fro thy heyghte, to be an heriter: for he that lyueth, heryteth deathe, and not death the lyfe, for all dyeth, and it heryteth al in theyr lyfe. Wilt thou take vengeance, of that hath giuen the ſo moch pein? Therfore take this councel: be frende to fortunes enmye, the whiche is the graue: Ouer them that be borne, and not ouer them that dye, is her empyre. O howe many greatte lordes haue ben the thoughtes of thy harte, ſoo as many wormes ſhall be in thyn entrayles? What greatter victory may be, thanne ſhe that ouercometh all lyuers, ſhall be vanquyſhed of the alonely by dethe. I ſaye one thynge to the, that all onely he that is cloſed in his graue, is aſſured of all thynges of this lyfe. Thy meſſager ſhewed me, that this ſommer thou woldeſt come to Rome, and nowe that it is wynter, thou wylte ſayle into Alexandrye. O, my frende Mercurio, whan thy lyfe draweth to an ende, thou beginneſt to be auaritious. Thou ſhalt fynde two cities in this worlde, in two extremytes, Rome the heed of vice, and Alexaundry the ende of all vertues. I ſay of thy merchaundyſe, in Rome thou dooſt charge thy body with vices, and in Alexaundrye thy harte with thoughtes. I ſwere by the othe of a iuſte man, that thou ſhalte haue more deſyre, of that thou leaueſt, then contentation of that thou beareſte away. Thou remembreſt not, howe it is wynter, and thou muſt paſſe the ſee, &amp; but if the pylotes lye to me, the caulme ſeaſon moſt ſure, is the vigil of the more vnfortune. Thou wylt ſaye, thy ſhyppes be voyde, and therfore they ſhal go more ſurely. I beleue they ſhal go more charged with auarice, thanne they ſhall come with ſylke. O what a good chaunge ſhal it be, if the auarice of Italy myght be changed for ſylke of Alexandry. I knowe ſurely theyr ſylke wil lade a ſhyppe, and our auarice wyl lade a hole flete. Great

is that couetyſe, whiche the ſhame of the worlde dothe not repreue, nor the feare of death ſtoppe, nor reaſon appoint. I ſay it, bycauſe that he, which in ſuch a tyme offreth him ſelfe to peryl, eyther couetiſe ſurmounteth hym, orels vnderſtandynge fayleth hym. And bycauſe I can finde none other excuſe ſufficient to excuſe me to the, but that thou art as moche knowen by the ſee, as vnknowen to the goddis, that is, the vnſtable wawes knowe the wicked harte and vnreſtefull, and the harde rockes vnruly menne: and one wind knoweth an other wynde. I pray the ſhewe me, what thou wylte go ſerche? Wylt thou go into the gulfe of Arpino for to ſeke thy leade? Than take hede, and thynke, how the fyſhe hath eaten thy harde leade, and let them not eate thy ſofte fleſhe. Thou wylt peraduenture go ſeke thy goodes with peryll of thy lyfe, and to leaue renowme at thy deth. Knoweſt thou not, that ſuche renoume, is a ſalue for a rewme, a baume for a ſwowning, lyght to a blynde perſonne, a nyghtingale to the deafe? I wyll diſcouer the enbuſhment, er thou falle therin. Thou ſekeſte thoughte for thy ſelfe, enuye for thy neyghbours, ſpurres for thyn enemies, wakynge for theues, peryll for thy body, damnation for thy renome, the endynge of they life, flighte for thy frendes, proceſſe for thy chyldren, and curſynge for thyn heires. And bycauſe the feuer haſteth toward me, I leaue my penne to write any more. My wyfe Fauſtine ſaluteth the, and is ſore diſpleaſed for thy loſſe. I ſende the a prouiſion, to the entent that a ſhippe may be gyuen the, bycauſe thou ſhuldeſt not loſe thy wytte. If thou be in Alexandrie, returne not by Rhodes, leaſte the Pyrates take the. The goddis be thy ſaufgarde, and ſend me and other good life, and good name with ſtraungers.
            
            
               
               ¶A letter ſent by Marc the emperour to Antigonus, comfortyng hym in a ſorowfull caſe. ¶The tenthe letter.
               
                  MArke pretour Romayne, Edile, Cenſorine, cō
                  panyon of the empire, to the Antigonus banyſhed, ſendeth greting to thy part, and good hope of the ſenate. To me beinge in Champain, thy heuy caſe was ſhewed, and at this houre in the temple of Iupiter was thy pitieful letter deliuered to me. I fele as moche as thou feleſte, and am hurte with as many woūdes. As thou art ſeparate fro thy neighbours, ſo in likewiſe I am baniſhed frō my wittes: and I wepe at this howre for the, as thou in my trauayles haſte wepte for me: and nowe I fele for the, as thou haſte felte for me. For to frendes afflicted with ſorowe, we oughte to gyue remedy to their perſones, and conſolation and compaſſion to their hartes. I ſwere to the by the lawe of good men, in this caſe I haue not ben vncourteys of aunciente tyme, nor cruell at this tyme, to feele it. As I redde the lynes of thy letter, I coude not holde my handes from ſhakynge, nor my harte from ſyghyng, nor myn eyen fro wepyng, to ſe the ſmall thing that thou ſendeſt to demaunde, and moche more for lacke of power to ſende to the. The greatteſt infortune of all infortunes, is whan a man may do lyttell, and wolde do moche. And the greatteſt fortune of all fortunes is, whan a man may do moche, and wylle doo but lyttell. In this I wyll ſe, if thou haſt forgoten our amitie, and aduentureſt at one tyme, that I haue truſted in the dyuers times. Thou knoweſt wel, that in the young dais of my youth, al thinges were diſcharged fro my hart, and charged them to thyne vnderſtandynge. Than it is a iuſte thyng, that thy trauayles ſhuld be diſcharged fro thy

wyll, and charged vpon my hart. And in this maner, thou and other, ſhall ſee and here, that my handes ſhalbe as redy to remedy the, as my teares of wepynge are for thy damage. Nowe come to the reſt of euyll fortune. Thou gyueſt me knowledge, that the goddis haue taken a doughter fro the: And the monſtrous erthequake hath throwen downe thy howſe, and the ſenate hath gyuen a ſentence agaynſte the, wherby thy goodes are loſte, and thy perſone banyſhed. The goddis be to me as propyce and meke, as they haue ben cruelle to the. I am ſoore abaſſhed, of that my ſpirite hath conceyued in this, as of the loſſe, that thou &amp; thy wyfe haue felt: yet am I not abaſhed of the monſter, that feareth the people, nor of the trymblynge, that hathe ſhaken downe thy howſes, nor of the fyre, that hath brent thy goodes, nor of the goddis that haue permitted ſuche thynges to falle: But I am abaſhed, that there is ſo moche malyce in the, and in thy neyghbours: For the whiche iuſtely ye do deſerue to haue ſoo horrible and cruelle chaſtyſementes. Beleue me in oone thynge Antigonus, and doubte it not, yf men lyued lyke men, and chaunged not the rule of conditours, the goddis wolde then be always as goddis, not to cauſe vs to be borne of oure mothers, to gyue vs ſo cruel chaſtiſemētes by the hande of monſtrous beaſtes. Certaynely it is iuſte and mooſte iuſte, that brute beaſtes be chaſtyſed by other brute beaſtes, and the monſterous, by other monſterous beaſtes: and ſuch as offend with greatte fautes, to be punyſhed with great peynes. I ſay to the one thynge, the whiche ſemeth a newe thynge to the, and that is this, the euyll perſons offende more by infamy, than the goddis gyue theym peyne for it, rather than for the offence that is cōmitted ageynſt them. As the goddis naturally be pitiefull, and alwaye haue the name therof, ſo we are always euyl, and our euylnes and ſhameful

werkes deſerue to haue ſore chaſtiſement. The ſymple folkes call the goddis cruell, in that they ſe theyr chaſtiſement openly, and for they ſee not our ſecrete ylneſſe. Than the goddis haue reaſon to complayn, bicauſe we with our ſinnes offend them, and they by our cruelnes are infamed. An ineffable rule it is, that the pitieful goddis do not punyſſhe extremely with extreme chaſtyſementes, ſythe that fyrſte the vicious men doo extremely with extreme vyces. The tyme that Camillus was banyſhed Capue, and that the frenche men poſſeſſed Rome, Lucius Clarus conſule was ſent by the ſenate to the oracle of Apollo, to demande counſell, what the Romayne people ſhuld do to be delyuered out of their great perylle. And there this conſule was xl. dayes within the temple on his knees before Appollo, offerynge right ſtraunge ſacrifices, and ſhedde many teares with wepynge, and yet he coulde haue none anſwere: and ſo with no ſmal inconueniences he returned to Rome. Than the holy ſenate ſēt out of euery temple two prieſtis, and whan they were proſtrate on the erthe, Apollo ſayde: As one beginnynge is correſpondent to an nother begynnynge, and one place to an nother, Meruaylle thou not, though by the reaſon of an extreme demaunde, I ſhewed my ſelfe extreme to anſwere. Ye Romaynes ſythe ye faylle men, ye come to ſeke to the goddis, for the occaſion wherof we wyll gyue you no good coūſayle whan ye haue nede, nor permytte that men ſhulde fauour you, whan ye goo to ſeke for them. Regarde my frendes, not for the ſacrifyces, that ye haue offred to me, but for the amitie, that I haue had with your fathers in tyme paſt, I wyl diſcouer to you a ſecrete, the whiche is, that ye ſhall ſay to the Romaynes fro me .vii. thynges. The fyrſte is, lette neuer man leaue the goddis for an other man, for feare that the goddis depart fro the myſerable man in his moſte greatteſt neceſſitie.

The .ii. is, that more auayllethe to holde the parte of one of the goddis immortall, that is in heuen, than with all the mortall men in the worlde. The .iii. is, that menne ſhulde beware to anoye the goddis, for the yre of the goddes doth more domage than the iniquitie of all men. The iiii. is, the goddis neuer forgette a man at any tyme, but if the goddes be forgotten by men a. M. tymes. The .v. is, that the goddis do ſuffre, that one ſhall be perſecuted by an other that is ylle, or they haue fyrſte perſecuted one that is good. And therfore ye are ſtryke with the feates of the frenchemen: bicauſe ye haue perſecuted and banyſhed Camyllus your naturalle neyghbour. The .vi. is, if the men wyl haue the goddis fauourable in the time of warre, they muſte ſerue them fyrſte in tyme of peace. The .vii. is, that the pitiefull goddes ſendeth not to any realme ſome extreme chaſtiſement, but if it be for ſome extreme offences commytttd in the ſame realme. And ſhewe to the Senate, that I wold make none anſwere to Lucius Clarus, bycauſe they ſent ſo yll a man to theyr god Apollo as ambaſſadur, the whiche they ought not to haue done. Ye Romayns take this counſell of me, and if ye fynde it yl, take no more of me. In a ſtraunge meſſage ſende alwayes the moſt eloquent men, and in your ſenate ſet the wyſeſt men: And commytte your hoſtes to valiant capitayns: and to your goddes ſende alway the moſt innocent men. The iuſt goddes neuer appeaſe their ires ageinſte vniuſt men: but if the requirers be very innocente and meke. For a fowle veſſell is not made cleane but with fayre water. For with foule handes it is hard to make the veſſel clene. The goddis be ſo iuſt, that they wyl not gyue iuſte thynges but by hādes of iuſt mē. Finally I ſay, if ye wyl driue the french men your ennemies out of your landes, fyrſte caſt out the paſſiōs fro your hartes. Thynke for trouth, that the goddis

wyll neuer driue your ennemies out of Italy, tyll Camyllus and al the gyltleſſe that be banyſhed, be returned ageyn to Rome. Certaynly the cruell warres that the goddis permytte at this tyme preſente, is but a warnynge of the chaſtiſementes for offences paſſed. For that the yl men haue done to the innocentes in diuers dayes, after by the handes of other that be yl, the paimēt is made in one daye. This anſwere Apollo made to the prieſtes flamynes, that were ſent to hym out of Rome, whiche thinge made the ſenate ſore abaſhed. I remēbre, that in the boke of the aunſwere of the goddis, in the annales of the capitol, there I founde it: the whiche boke the firſt day of euery monethe was red by a ſenatour, before al the other ſenatours of the ſenate. Therfore frēd Antigonus, as the god Apollo ſaid, if thou wylt not beleue me, that am thy frende, beleue the god Apollo. O Antigonus, beholde howe the vnderſtanding of vayn men are but beſtly to the ſpirites of the goddis, whiche are ſecret and hid: and where as they ſpeke, al other ought to be ſtylle. For one counſell of the goddis is more worth in mockerie, than al the coūſels of mē, though they be neuer ſo erneſt. Of whens thinkeſt thou that this cometh? I ſhall ſhewe the: The goddis are ſoo perfyte in all bountie, and ſo wiſe in al wiſedome, and we are ſo yl in all malyce, &amp; ſo ſimple in all ſymplenes, that though they wolde erre, they can not bicauſe they be goddis: and we yt wolde be aſſured, erre, bycauſe we be men. And herin I ſe what a brute beaſt man is: for all theſe mortall men are ſo entier in their owne wylles, that they wyll loſe more in folowyng their owne opinion, than wynne by the counſel of an other man: and that worſt of al is, they take ſo the bytte in the teeth in doinge yll, that there is no bridell that can refrayne them. And they are ſo ſlowe to do well, that there is no pricke nor ſpourre that can dryue theym forwarde.

Thou doeſt complayne of the pytiefull goddis, and of the ſacrate ſenate. Alſo thou complayneſt of ioyfulle fortune. Thre thynges there be, that one of them is inoughe with one ſtroke of a ſtone, to take away thy lyfe, and bury thy renoume. And whan eche of them hath drawen the apart, than al together wyl ſtryke on the with ſtones. Thou haſt taken great competitours, and yet I knowe not what thy worthynes is. I ſhal ſhewe the ſome ſtrengthes and valiantnes that the aunciente barons hadde, and therby thou ſhalt ſe, what they of this worlde dothe holde. ¶The felawe of Scipio Naſica toke a ſerpente in the mountayns of Egipt, whiche after it was ſlayne, flayed, and the ſkynne meſured in the felde of Mars, it was .vi. ſcore fote of length. Hercules of Thebes proued his force with the ſerpente Hydra, And in ſtrykynge of one of his heedes, there ſprange out .vii. other heades. ¶Mylon the giaunt to exerciſe his ſtrength was accuſtomed euery day to ouertake a bul with renninge a fote, and caſt hym downe, and he made many courſes with the bull, as it were an other naked yonge man: and yet, that was more meruayle, he with one ſtroke of his fiſt ſlewe the bul, and the ſame day wolde eate hym all together. ¶On mount Olympe Ceraſtus the giaunt of the nacion of Grece, wraſteled with mo than .l.M. menne, and none coude ſtyre nor ſhake him. And if Homere begileth vs not of this gyaunt, he was of ſuche fame and dedes, that euery foure yeres, there was a cuſtome, that al nations of the world went to wraſtle at moūt Olympe. And therof came the rekenynge of the Olympiades.
               ¶In the ſecond warre punike among the captiues of ſorowefull Carthage, Scipio brought a manne, a lorde of Maurytayne, ryght ſtrong and fierſe to behold: and in celebratynge a ſpectacle in the palayes of Rome, which was

than of greatte renoume, there were innumerable beaſtes ron at: This captiue priſoner lept into the parke, and kylled two beares, and wraſtled with a lyon a great whyle: finally being ſore hurte with the lyons pawes, he ſtrangled the lyon with his handes. This was a monſtrous thynge to ſe, and nowe it ſemeth incredyble to be belued. ¶In the yere .CCCCxx. of the foundation of Rome, Curio Ledent a renoumed capitayne, comynge fro Tarente agaynſt Pyrro kyng of the Epirotes: he was the firſt that brought .iiii. Oliphātes to Rome the day of his triumph. Stages and places were made for .xxx.M. men to ſe the rennynge of theſe Olyphauntes: and in the myddes of the paſtyme, the plankes brake, and ſlewe mo than .v.M. perſons. And among them there was Numatian, the whiche bare vpon his ſhulders a planke with mo than .iii.C. men, tyl that he and they were ſuccoured.
               ¶Gayus Ceſar beinge yonge, fleinge the companye of Sylla, bycauſe he was perteyninge to Marius, he being amonge the Rodiens wan his meate with courſyng &amp; runnynge of horſes, with his handes bounde dehynd hym. It was a monſtrous thinge to ſe, as the annales wytneſſe: howe he wolde guyde the horſes with his knees ſoo faſte, as thoughe he had drawen them with the reynes of theyr bridelles.
               ¶In the .xv. yere that the capitayne of Cartagenens entred into Italy, our auncient fathers ſente to the realme of Frigie for the dyeſſe Berecynthia, mother of the goddis: and whan ſhe arryued at the porte Hoſtie, the ſhyppe that ſhe came in, ranne vppon the ſande, and by the ſpace of .iiii. dayes .xxx.M. men, that came in the army, coude not remoue it: by chaunce came thither one of the virgins veſtales named Rea, whiche with her gyrdelle tyed to the ſhyppe, drewe it to the lande as eaſily as ſhe wolde haue

drawen a threde from the diſtaffe: And to the intente that we ſhulde beleue ſuche thinges, as we here were done in tymes paſt, we may know it by dedes done preſētly in our days. I remembre whan my lord Adrian came fro Dacie, he dydde celebrate a ſpectacle in Rome, wherin there was mo than .ii.M. wyld beſtes. And the thing moſt notable yt we haue ſene, there was a knyght borne by the riuer Danubio, who toke a hors, and ran into the parke, and ſlewe ſo many wylde beſtes, that there fledde fro him lyons, leopardes, beares, olyphantes, and we dyd fle fro them: and he ſlewe mo of them than they dyd of men. Theſe ſtrange thinges I haue recyted to the, that of all theſe I am not ſo abaſhed, as I am of the, to ſe the redye to doo armes ageinſt the goddis, and againſt the ſenate, and ageinſt fortune. Theſe thre are gyauntes in vertuous valyauntyſe, and happy at all tymes: and they be ſuche as commaund them that commande other. The goddis by their naturalyte and power cloſe vp the furies, and gouerne the ſterres: And the ſenate with their Iuſtyce ouercomethe realmes, and ſubdueth tyrantes: and fortune with her tirāny taketh them that they leaue, and leauethe them that they take: and honoureth them that they diſhonour, and chaſtyſeth them that ſerue her: ſhe begyleth euery perſon, and no perſon begyleth her: ſhe promyſeth moche, and fulfylleth nothynge: her ſonge is wepynge, and her wepinge is ſonge, to them that be deed amonge wormes, and to them that lyue in fortunes: at them that be preſent ſhe ſpurneth with her fete, and threateth them that be abſente. All wyſe men ſhrinke fro her, but thou lyke a fole ſheweſte her thy face. Of one thynge I am abaſhed of the, to complayne of the ſenate, and yet I meruayle not: for in concluſion they be but men: yet of trouth in thinges of Iuſtice they ought to be more than men. And to complayn on fortune, I meruayle

not a lyttell: for in the ende fortune is fortune amōg mortalle men. And all the heuens is of an aunciente quarelle, and whan we are beſette with mooſte greatteſt quarelles, than ſhe ſtryketh vs with moſt greuous hurtes. I haue great wonder, that thou being a Romain, cōplaineſt on the goddis, as if thou were one of the barbariens. We Romayns are not ſo moche renowmed among al nations, for the multitude of realmes that we haue ouercome, as we are for the great churches and ſeruices that we haue made. Thou complayneſt, howe the goddes haue broken thy houſes with an erthquake, and haue ſlayne thy doughter, felowe in thy banyſhemente, and al in one daye: But thou doſt not remembre the offences that thou haſt cōmitted in dyuers caſes. O my frende Antigonꝰ, thou knoweſt not, yt out of our yl proceſſes cometh forth good ſentences: and thou knoweſt not, yt our wicked workes are but a waking of true Iuſtice. Knoweſt thou not, that the fierſe chaſtiſementes, is but a preſſe that haſteth the gret cōminges of your yonge deſires? and knoweſt thou not, that it is no thynge that the goddes do chaſtiſe openly, to that they do diſſimule in ſecrete? Doſt thou not knowe, that in concluſion the goddis be goddis, &amp; the mortalles are mortalles, and they may do vs more good in one day, than we can do ſeruice in a. C.M. yere? Doeſt thou not knowe, that the leaſt yl done by the handes of the pitiefull goddis, is more goodnes than all the welth that may come by the handes of the cruel men? Thā wherof doſt thou complain? I pray the be ſtyl. And ſith thou art amonge ſtrāgers, ſuffre. And thou wilte haue honour, diſhonour not the goddis of the Romayns. For the vniuſt mē do gret iniuſtice to ſpeke yll of them that be iuſt, &amp; ſpecially of the goddis, for they are moſt iuſt. Certainly as Cicero ſayth, the greateſt faut in a man that is good, is to approue the yl rather thā ye good:

and the moſte greatteſt yuell in an yll man is to condemne the good for the yll. Thou knoweſt not howe iuſt the goddis be. Of trouthe they chaunge not for any prayer, nor leaue nat for any thretenynges, nor mocke not by wordes: nor be not corrupt with gyftes. Great ought thyn offence to be, ſithe the erthe hath taken vengeance for the goddis: and thy innocent doughter hathe payde the faute, for the offence of her father. O Antigonus, doſte thou not know, that in all thynges the goddis may werke after their own opinyon and wylle, excepte in Iuſtyce: for in that they be goddis of all, they oughte to be egall to all? And if theyr bountie doth bynde them to rewarde vs for goodneſſe, no leſſe their iuſtyce conſtrayneth them to chaſtyſe vs for our ylles. It is a greatte cuſtome, and a ryghtouſe Iuſtyce, He that wyllyngely draweth to ſynne, agaynſt his wyll is drawen to peyne. I ſay it bycauſe thy doughter hath lefte to do ſome good openly, or elles ſhe hath done ſome ſecrete ylle, ſithe in her youth her lyfe is bereued frome her father for enſample of chaſtyſement in other. And in the ende of thy letter thou complayneſt, that the peyne that men doo to the, is more greatter than the offences that thou haſte done to the goddis. And if hit be thus frende Antygone, thou oughteſt to haue no diſpleaſure, but pleaſure, no heuynes but ioye. And I ſwere to the by the immortall goddis, I wolde gladly chaunge my lybertie for thy captiuytie, and the ſtate of Rome for thy banyſhement of Sycile. And I ſhall telle the why: He is honoured amonge theym that be honoured, that fortune abateth without faute: and he is ſhamed amonge theym that be ſhamed, that fortune inhāceth without merite. For the ſhame is not in the incō
                  uenientes that is done to vs by men, but it is of the offēce that we commytte ageynſt the goddis. And in like caſe the honourable honour reſtethe not in the dygnyties that we

haue, but in the good workes, wherby we meryte. And therby the wordes ſeme trewe, that the .xi. emperour of Rome bare writen in a rynge on his fynger, whiche ſayde thus: More is he to be honoured, that deſerueth honour, than he that hath it and deſerueth it not. Theſe wordes are greatly to be noted, and ſpoken by a great lorde. Than retourne to the purpoſe. Thou complayneſt of the wronges and greues that men do to men, and leue the goddis. I haue no meruayle: for as the goddis do neuer vniuſte thynges, ſo the menne neuer lyghtly do any thynge iuſte. Note this that I ſay, and forgette it not. The ſenate gyueth an open peyne, and publyſſheth the ſecrete faulte, in ſuche maner that with the peyne they hurte vs, and with the faute they ſhame vs. The goddes are more pitiefull: for though they gyue vs pein, yet they kepe the faut cloſe. A my frende Antigone, though the goddes gather togider the ſlouthe and wyckednes, that we commytte ſecretelye, Beleue me and doubte not, the goddis gyue lyfe to many, the whiche men bereueth. Therfore I thynke, that thou ſhuldeſt thynke and wyſhe, that ſyth the goddis haue ſuffred the ylles that thou haſt done ſecretly, that thou muſt ſuffre open chaſtyſement, that men haue gyuen to the. For otherwiſe thinkynge to put away the peyne, thou ſhalt abyde charged with infamy. I haue written to the this lōg epyſtle, to thentent that thou ſhuldeſt haue ſome thyng to paſſe the tyme with. Certaynly the greatteſt eaſemente to eaſe hym that is in trauayle, is to exercyſe the wauerynge harte with ſome good occupations. I wyll write no more to the at this tyme, but as touchynge thy banyſhemente, truſte me I ſhal brynge the at one with the ſenate. I ſende Panutius my ſecretarie to the, gyue as moche credence to his wordes, as to my letter. And he bryngeth a gowne to the, and therwith my harte and wylle for to comforte the.

Salutation, peace, and good age be with the: and theire of the goddis and yll fortune be ſeperate fro me. Marke, my houſehold, wyfe, and chyldrē ſalute the as thyn own. And we ſalute all thy family as our owne. Thoughe the halfe of my letter be not of my hande, comforte the, for my harte is entirely thyne. Thou knoweſte howe I was greuouſly hurte in the warres of Dacye in my hande, and in moyſte wethers one of my fyngers ſlepeth. Thus I make an ende as always thyn owne.
            
            
               ¶An other letter ſent by Marc themperour to the ſame Antigonus ageynſt cruell iuges. The leuenth letter.
               
                  MArc the ſycke manne, to the Antigonus banyſhed, deſyreth ſalute for hym, and reſte for the. To eſchewe the enuious trauaylles of Rome, and to ſe certayne bokes of Hebrewe, that were broughte to me fro Helya, I came hyther to Sanya: I made great haaſte in my iournayes, howe be it at Salon the feuer toke me: and the .xx. day of Iune I receyued thy ſeconde letter, and the ſame houre the feuer quartayne toke me. I thynke none of vs bothe had the better hande. For neyther my longe letter dydde put away thy trauayle, nor thy ſhorte letter dyd put away my feuer. And though as nowe the felynge of thy trauaile miniſſheth that I had, the more brenneth the deſire to remedy the. Therfore I wyll ſay ſome thinge to the, but not that I fynde any conſolation that thou haſte nede therof. In the lawe of Rhodes I haue founde theſe wordes: we commaunde, that none be ſo hardy to gyue counſail with out remedy: for the wordes to hym yt is in trouble gyuethe ſmall conſolation, whā there is no remedy. Alſo the herte that is in ſorow, hath more reſt ſhewing his own greues,

then herynge the conſolation of other. Thou ſayeſt in thy letter, that the cenſures are right rigorous in that realme: and therfore al that nation hath yll wyll with the ſenate. I beleue well they haue good occaſion therof: for diſhonoured men make the miniſters of Iuſtice to be rigorous, and namely they of that yle. For there is an ancient prouerbe, that ſayth, lyghtly all theſe ylles ar yll, and the Siciliens worſt of all. Now adays the yll are mighty in their ylnes, and the good with their vertues are kepte ſo cloſe, that yf there be not ſome bridell by iuſtyce, the yll ſhuld poſſeſſe al the world, and the good ſhuld fynyſhe ſhortly. But finally to conſider how vnable we be borne, &amp; ar enuironned with ſo many ylles, beinge ſubiect to ſo many miſeries. I meruayle not of the humanities that the humain people commytteth: but I am aſhamed of the cruel ſentence that our Cenſures do, not as Romayns, but as cruell tyrantes. Of one thyng I am ſore abaſhed, and greatly it troubleth my wyttes, ſeinge naturally &amp; of right the iuſtyce of the goddis is good, and we offendyng them, and that haue iuſtice but lent to vs, yet we glorifie vs to be cruell: ſo yt the goddis do pardon iniuries done to thē, wherby fame of mekenes abideth to them: and we chaſtiſe the iniuries of other, wherby we wyn the fame of tyrātis. In good ſothe there is no man among men, nor humain among the humains, but he is as a brute beaſt, and wilde among wyld beaſtis, that nameth hym ſelfe to be of the fleſhe, and hath no pitie to hurte other fleſhe: Nor conſidereth not, that the goddis hath made hym a meke beaſt &amp; lowly by nature, &amp; he becometh a fiers ſerpent by malyce. In the .xii. yere of the foū
                  dation of Rome, Romulus the firſt kynge ſent a cōmādement into al places &amp; realmes nygh to him: as to the Volgues, Samites, &amp; Ruſſiens, to Capue, Tarentis, &amp; Albanoys: to thentent that all ſuch as were baniſhed troubled

and perſecuted in their realmes, ſhuld come to Rome, and there they ſhulde be receyued and well entreated: and except the hyſtories lye, Rome was more inhabited in tenne yeres, than Babylon or Cartage in a. C. yeres. O glorious harte of Romulus, that ſuche a thyng inuented: and glorious tongue, that ſuche a thynge commaunded: and glorious was the citie or coūtrey, that foūded them vpon ſuche mercy and pytie. I haue founde dyuers letters of dyuers realmes of the orient, ſent forth, mēcionyng thus: We the kynge of Parthes in Aſie, to the conſcript fathers of Rome, and to the happy people of Italy, and vnto all them of that empyre, hauynge the name of Romaynes, and ſurname of clemency, Salutation to your perſones. We ſende peace and tranquillitie to you, as we demaunde the ſame of the goddis.
               ¶Thus than regarde, what glorious title of Clemencie our predeceſſours Romayns hadde: and what exaumple of clemency they haue left for al emperours to com. Take this for certayne, that the Cenſures or mynyſters of Iuſtyce, forgettynge the pitie of the Romayns, ſhalbe reputed cruelle, as Barbariens: Nor Rome ſhall not repute them as her naturall chyldren, but as cruelle ennemies: and not for augmentours of the common welth, but infamours and robbers of clemency.
               ¶Whan I was of the age of .xxxvii. yere, beinge in the yle of Crete, nowe called Cypres, in wynter tyme, There was a mountayne called Archadio, whervpon foure pyllers were ſette, and a ſepulchre of a kyng of worthy fame, and in his lyfe pitiefull and ful of mercy: and as one ſhewed me, there were certayne wordes written in greke letters rounde aboute the ſepulchre, ſaying thus: I haue taken to me alwayes this counſayle, where as I myght do but lytell good, I neuer dyd harme: &amp; that that I myght

haue with peace, I neuer ſtroue for: Suche as I myght ouercome with prayer, I neuer feared with thretnynges. Where as I might remedy ſecretely, I dyd neuer chaſtiſe openly: theym that I myght correcte with warnynges, I neuer hurted with beatynges: Suche as I chaſtyſed openly, I fyrſte aduertyſed ſecretely: and fynally I neuer chaſtyſed one, but I forgaue foure. I am ryght ſorowful, bycauſe that I haue chaſtyſed: and am glad bycauſe that I pardoned. In as moche as I was borne as a manne, my fleſhe is here eaten with wormes: and bycauſe I haue lyued vertuouſly in my lyfe, my ſpirite ſhal now reſt with the goddis.
               ¶Howe thynkeſt thou my frende Antygonus, what an Epitaphye was this? And howe gloryous was his lyfe, ſythe the memorie of hym vnto this daye abydeth ſoo immortall? And as the goddis may helpe me in al goodnes, and defend me fro yll, I haue not ſo great delyte at Pompey with his army, nor at Gaius Iulius Ceſar with his Gaules of Fraunce, nor at Scipio with his Affricans, as I haue at the kyng of Cypres with his ſepulchre. For that kynge hath more glorie in that mountayne beinge deade, than all the other had in all their lyues, with al their tryumphes, that euer they had in Rome. I ſay not, but that the wyckednes of yll people ſhulde be chaſtyſed: for with out compariſon, he is worſe that fauoureth the ylle, than he that commytteth the yl: for the one procedeth of wekenes, and the other of malice. But it ſemeth to me, and to al other that be wiſe, that as the ſynne is natural, &amp; the chaſtyſement voluntarie: ſo ought the rigour of Iuſtyce to be temperate, ſo that the miniſters ſhoulde ſhewe compaſſion rather than vengeance: wherby the treſpaſſours ſhulde haue occaſyon to amende their ſynne paſſed, and not to reuenge the iniurie preſente. O whatte places and

realmes haue ben loſte, not for the ylnes that the yl people hath cōmitted, but rather by the diſordinate Iuſtyce, that the miniſters of iuſtice haue exerciſed? Thinkyng by their rigour to correcte the domages paſſed, wherby hath ryſen ſclaunders and ſtryfe, neuer none ſuch hard of afore. Whā a prince ſendeth any perſon with the charge of iuſtyce, he ought to ſay to hym theſe wordes, whiche Auguſte Ceſar ſayd to the gouernour of Affrike: I put not the cōfidence of myn honour into thy hondes, nor cōmitte to the my iuſtyce, to be a diſtroyer of innocentes, nor an executioner of ſynners: but that with one hande thou ſhuldeſt helpe the good to maynteyn them therin: &amp; with the other hande to helpe to reyſe them that be yll from their noughtyneſſe. And myn intention is to ſende the forth to be a preceptour of orphans, and an aduocate for wydowes, a ſurgion for all woundes, a ſtaffe for the blynde, a father to euery perſon, to ſpeke fayre to myn ennemies, &amp; to reioyce my frendes. In this maner I wolde thou ſhuldeſt vſe thy ſelfe in euery place, ſo that by the fame of pitiefulnes, ſuche as be myn ſhalbe in reſte &amp; content to be my ſubiectis, and that ſtraungers ſhalbe deſirous to come and ſerue me. ¶This inſtructiō Auguſt Ceſar gaue to a gouernour of his, bicauſe it was ſhewed him, that he was ſomwhat cruell in that realme. Certainly they were ſhort wordes, but they be right cōpendious: And wold to god they were writen in the hartes of our iuges. Thou writeſt, how that ile is ſore troubled by reſon of the cenſures &amp; iuges therof. It is a noyfulle trauayle to receyue the auctoritie of iuſtyce into the hande of an vniuſt man: and it is a thyng not to be ſuffred, that one with tyranny ſhulde tyrannyſe diuers other: not with the lyfe, but with the auctoritie to correcte good men, therby to be called a good cēſure. The auctorite of his office giuē to him by his prince oughte to be his acceſſarie,

and his good lyfe for principall: in ſuche maner, that by the rectitude of his iuſtice, the yll ſhuld fele the excution therof. Al that haue auctorite ſhuld tempre it with wyſedome &amp; purenes of liuinge. It is a great goodnes to the cōmon welth, and great confuſion to hym that is chaſtiſed with peyne, whā the miſerable that is chaſtiſed, ſeeth nothynge in hym that chaſtiſeth, wherby he hath deſerued to be chaſtiſed. And cōtrary, it is great ſlackenes in a prince to cōmaunde, and great ſhame to the comon welth to conſente, and great inconuenyence and reprofe to the iudge to execute: whan a poore wretche for a ſmal faute is put to more peyne for the ſame ſmal faut done in one day, than is gyuen to them that be greate for many tyrannyes, that they haue commytted during their life. Theſe be they that peruerte the common welth, and ſclander the worlde, and put them ſelfe out of auctoritie.
               ¶In the .iii. yere that great Pōpeie toke Elia, the which is nowe Ieruſalem, the ſame tyme beinge there Valerius Graccus, thyder came an Hebrewe, or a iewe, as the annales ſhewe, to complayne to the Senate of the wronges &amp; greues that were done to hym in that londe, &amp; ſo in doinge his errāde in the name of al that ꝓuince, he ſayd theſe wordes: O fathers conſcript, O happy people, your fatal deſtenies ꝑmitte, and our god leueth vs with Ieruſalē, lady of al Aſie, &amp; mother to ye Ebrues, to be in ſeruage of Rome, &amp; to the Romains: Certeynly gret was ye power of Pōpey, &amp; moch more the force of his army to take vs. But therfore I ſay, that greatter was the yre of our god, &amp; without compariſon the multitude of our ſynnes, wherby we dyd merite to be loſt. I wold ye knew one thīg, &amp; it ſore diſpleſeth me, yt ye Romaynes haue not proued it by experiēce. That is, our god is ſo iuſt, yt if among vs there had bē .x. iuſt mē, &amp; amonge .l.M. yl, one god, he wold haue ꝑdoned al ye yll:

And than ye Romayns ſhulde haue ſene as the Egiptiens dyd, howe our god alone may do moch more than al your goddis togyther. And certaynely as longe as we be ſynners, ſo longe ye ſhall be our lordes. And as longe as the yre of the Hebrues god doth endure, ſo longe ſhall the power of the Romayns laſte. And bycauſe in this caſe I folowe one way, and by your ſecte ye folowe an other waye, ye can not retourne to honour one god onely, nor I to honour dyuers goddis. I wyll leue this matter to the god, by whoſe power we haue ben nouriſhed, &amp; by whoſe boūte we be gouerned, and returne to the caſe of our embaſſade. Ye know what peace hath ben betwene Rome and Iudee, and betwene Iudee and Rome, we with you, and ye with vs. In all thynges we haue obeyed you, and ye vs. Noo iuſte thyng we haue denyed you. And bicauſe there is nothynge more deſyred of the people, and leſſe put in operation than is peace, and there is nothynge more abhorred, by the whiche abhorynge euery mā lyueth, thā is warre: I do warn you of this with truth, prouyde therfore iuſtice, put them awaye yt folowe your wylles to do vs yl: And let vs haue no ſuche malycious folke, as intyſe vs to rebell. The greatteſte ſigne and ſtrongeſte pyller of peace is to put away the perturbers of peace. What profyte is to ſaye peace peace, &amp; in ſecrete to ſay warre warre? I ſay this bicauſe ye haue baniſhed the eldeſt ſon of king Idumeo out of Lyon for his demerites, and ye haue ſente in his ſtede Campanius, Marcus, Ruffus, and Valerius Graccus for preſidentes. They be .iiii. plages. or .iiii. peſtilences, ſo that the leaſt of them were ſufficiente to enpoyſon the hole empire of Rome, than moche ſoner our myſerable realme of Paleſtyne. What thynge can be more monſtrous, than that the iudges of Rome ſhuld ſende men to put away ylle cuſtomes fro them that be yll, and they them ſelfes are the

inuentours of newe vyces? What greatter ſhame and inconuenience is in Iuſtice, than they that haue auctoritie to chaſtiſe wanton youth, to glorifie them ſelfe to be capitaynes of theym that be wylde? What greatter infamye can be in Rome, than they that ought to be vertuous and iuſte, to gyue example to other to be yll and vicious? I lye if they haue not ſo writhen and enlarged the diſciplyne of Iuſtyce, that they haue taught the youthe of Iude ſuche vyces, that haue not ben harde of by our fathers, nor red in no bokes, nor ſene in our tyme. O Romayns beleue me in one thynge, what counſelles Iude hath taken of Rome at this houre, lette Rome take of Iudee. Many realmes are gotten with myghty capitaynes, and moche ſhedyng of blode, and ought to be obſerued with a good iudge, not in ſhedynge of blode, but in gettynge of hartes. Certainly the iudge that wynneth moo good wylles than money, ought to be beloued: and he that ſerueth for moneye, and loſeth the good wylles, for euer oughte to be abhorred as peſtylence. What thynke ye is the cauſe nowe adays, that your preſidentes be not obeyed in a iuſt cauſe? Of a trouth it is bycauſe, that fyrſte they commaunde vniuſt thinges. The commandementes that be iuſte, maketh ſoft &amp; meke hartes, and ſuche as be vniuſt, maketh men cruel. We be ſo myſerable in all myſeries, that to hym that commaundeth well, we obey yll: and the more yl they commaunde, the more obeyed wolde they be. Beleue me in one thynge, that of the great lyghtnes and ſmall ſadnes of the iuges, is bredde lytell feare and great ſhame in the ſubiectis. We that be iewes thynk our ſelfe wel aduertiſed by the mouth of our god that ſayth, Euery prynce commyttyng charge of Iuſtice to him that he ſeeth vnable to execute the ſame, or dothe not principally for Iuſtyce ſake accomplyſhe iuſtyce, but dothe it for his owne profyte, or els to pleaſe the

nor can not remedy a ſmall matter, but inuent other more greatter, alteryng and troublyng the peace for theyr owne particular welth. They wepe for their owne harme, and no leſſe for the welth of other, and finally leſe them ſelfes. And therfore they aduenture them ſelfe into the gulfes, &amp; inflame theyr lordes, that haue gyuen them ſuche offices, to gyue them to ſuche as haue deſerued them. Thou mayſt know, that the beginning of them is pryde and ambition, and theyr middell is enuye and malyce, and their ende is death and diſtruction. And if my counſell were taken, ſuche ſhulde haue no credence with princis or gouernours, but as ſclaundred men to be ſeperate, not all onely fro the common welthe, but fro theyr lyues. Surely great is the couetyſe of them that be ſhameleſſe, which without ſhame demaunde offices of the ſenate or princis: but it is a more boldenes of malyce for the pryncis to gyue them. In this and in the other thinges theſe are ſo dampnable, that neyther the feare of the goddis doth withdrawe them, nor the prince doth not refrayne them, nor vengeaunce dothe not lette them, nor the common welth dothe not accuſe theym, and aboue all other reaſon, doth not commaund them, nor the lawe ſubdue them.
               ¶O my frende Antygonus note this worde that I write in the ende of my letter. In the yere of the foundation of Rome .vi.C.xlii. the Romaynes as thanne in the worlde hadde dyuers warres, as Gayus Celius ageynſt them of Trace, and Gneo Cordon his brother agaynſt Sardyne, Iunius Sylla agaynſt the Vmbres, Minutius Ruffus ageynſt the Macidoniens, Seruilio Scipio ageynſte the Luſitayns, and Marius conſull ageinſt Iugurtha kyng of the Numidiens, It befell ſo that Boco kynge of Mauritayne fauoured Iugurtha, and vppon them triumphed Marius, and they laded with chaines were led afore his

chariot, not without great compaſſion of them that ſawe it. After this triumph done, incontinent the ſame daye by counſell of the ſenate, Iugurtha was beheeded in priſon, and his companion Bocus had pardon of his life, and the cauſe was, It was a cuſtome none to be putte to Iuſtice, but firſte the auncient bokes ſhulde be ſerched, to ſe if any of his predeceſſours had done before any ſeruice to Rome, wherdy the captiue ſhulde meryte to haue pardone of his lyfe: and than it was found, that the grauntfather of Bocus came to Rome, and made great orations before the ſenate, by whoſe wordes and ſentences, his ſayd neuew merited to haue pardon of his lyfe: and amonge other of his ſayinges, he reherſed theſe verſes that ſayd: what is that realme, where is no good amonge the yll, nor yll amonge the good? what is that realme, that hath theyr houſes full of good ſimple perſons, and banyſheth away al wiſedom? Or what is that realme, that ſuche as be good are cowardes, and the yl hardy? or what is the realme, where al peaſible are diſpleaſed, and the ſedycious prayſed? What is that realme, that ſleeth them that wolde theyr welth, and are angry with them that wolde helpe theyr yl? or what is that realme, that permytteth the proude poore folkes, and the ryche tyrantes? or what is that realme, where they all know the euyl, and none procureth any goodnes? or what is that realme, where ſuche vices are openly commytted, that other realmes feare to doo ſecretely? or what is that realme, where as all that they deſyre they procure, and al that they do procure, they attayne, and all that is yll they thinke, and al that they thinke they ſay, &amp; al that they ſay, they may do, and all that they may doo, they dare doo, and put in operation that they dare do: and worſt of all, there is none ſo good to reſyſt it? In ſuche a realme there ſhulde be none inhabitaunte. For within ſhort ſpace the yll men

ſhall be chaunged, or elles diſpeopled of good men, or the goddis wyll confounde them, or the tirantis ſhal take thē. Dyuers thinges were ſaid, the which I paſſe ouer at this tyme. Howe thynkeſt thou Antigone? I ſwere by the immortal goddis, that my hart breketh to thinke of the great ſhame that was laid vpon Rome by ſuch wryting as was lefte to theym by the grauntefather of this kynge Bocus. This my letter I wolde thou ſhuldeſt rede in ſecrete to the pretours, &amp; if they amende not, we ſhall fynde the meanes to chaſtiſe them openly. And as touchyng thy baniſhemēt I promyſe the to be thy good frende to the ſenate, that we may ioy our auncient amitie to gether. And to get the out of that yle, certainely I ſhal do my diligence. I haue written to my ſecretarie Panutius to delyuer the .ii.M. ſexters to releue thy pouertie: and thus I ſende the my letter to comfort thy heuy hart. I ſay no more, but the goddis giue the contentacion of that thou woldeſt haue ioy, and reſt to thy perſon. And al corporall euyls, cruel enmies, and fatal deſtenies be ſeperate fro me Marke. For the behalf of my wife Fauſtine, I ſalute the, and thy wyfe Ruffa: She is thyn, and I am thyn. With viſitation of ioy I haue receiued thy letter, and thankefully I ſend the myn. I ſhal not reſte to deſire to ſe thy perſone in Italy, and there in Sicyle to leue my feuer quartayne.
            
            
               ¶A letter ſent by Marcus to Lambert gouernour of the yle of Heleſpont, whan he did baniſhe the vacabundis fro Rome. The .xi. letter.
               MArke emperour of Rome, lorde of Aſie, confederate with theym of Europe, frende of theym of Affrike, ennemye of the Maures: To the Lambert gouernour of the ile of Heleſponte, ſendethe of his parte contentation

and ſuretie fro the ſacrate ſenate. I am furred with ye furres that thou haſte ſent me, &amp; am clothed with thy mātel, &amp; am right well pleaſed with thy greyhoundes: If I hadde thought, that thin abſence fro Rome ſhuld haue procured ſo moche fruit in that yle: longe ago I ſhulde haue determyned as well for thy profyte as for my ſeruice. I ſente to the in demaundynge but ſmall thinges in my ſporte, and thou haſt ſent me many thynges in erneſt. In good ſothe thou haſt better proporcioned thy ſeruyce with noblenes, than I to commaunde with my couetiſe. For if thou remē
                  bre, I ſent to the for a doſeyne ſkynnes of furre, and thou haſt ſent me .xii. doſeyns: and I dyd ſend but for .vi. greihoundes, and thou haſt ſent me .xii. Truly in this caſe my pleaſure is double. For here in Rome thy great largeſſe is publyſhed, and my ſmal couetiſe there in Heleſponte. And bycauſe I am ſure thou haſt great thankes of me, I praie to gōd to ſende the ſalute and helthe: And that fortune be not denied the at a good houre. I ſende the .iii. barkes of mayſter foles, &amp; yet I haue not ſent the al. For if I had banyſhed all the foles in Rome, we ſhoulde haue peopled vs with a newe people. Theſe mayſter foles haue ben ſo wily to teche foly, &amp; the Romayn youth ſo apt to lerne, thoughe they be but in .iii. barkes, theyr diſciples wold lade .iii.M. Carrakes. I haue great meruayle of one thynge, and my hart ſclaundreth the goddis: for I ſe wel that erthquakes caſteth down houſes, &amp; gret waters bereth away bridges, froſtes freſeth the vines, ſodein thondring and tempeſtes breketh down toures, ſcarſitie of water cauſeth derth, corrupt aire maketh an ende of thē that be wiſe: &amp; yet there is nothinge that can make an ende of theſe fooles. All thinges at this day faileth at Rome, excepte all only theſe ydel trewandes, geſtours, tomblers, players, or dromſlayes, iuglers, &amp; ſuche other, of whom there is inowe &amp; to many.

O what a ſeruyce ſhuldeſt thou doo to the goddis, &amp; what profyte to Rome, that for thre barkes ful of foles to ſende one lade with wyſe men? One thyng I wyl ſay, that with the bones of the wyſe men that yle is halowed, that anciently were banyſſhed by the malyce and enuye of them of Rome: if thy ſmellynge wyttes be not loſt, as Italy ſtynketh of them that be ſymple, ſoo that yle ſmelleth ſwete of wyſe men. Whan I came fro the warres of the Parthes, the .iiii. yere of myn empire, I paſſed into that yle by dyuers ſees to ſee the ſepulchres of ancient wyſe men: and in the citie of Dorbite in the myddes therof, lyeth Ouide, that was banyſhed by Auguſt: and vnder the mountayne Arpines is the ſepulchre of the renomed Armeno oratour banyſhed by Sylla: at the porte of Argonaut thou ſhalte fynde the bones of Colliodorus recapituler of the antyke lawes, that was banyſſhed by Nero the cruell: and in the felde of Elinos, vnder a marble, is the pouders of Syſifo Seteno, that was ſo wel lerned in the .vii. artes liberal, as though he had newe founde them, he was banyſhed by the Marians. I ſay for trouthe thou ſhalte fynde it thus, for with my knees I haue touched their ſepulchres. And all that ſeaſon my tender eyes were as fulle of water, as theyr bones were harde in the erthe. Theſe were not banyſhed for no vylanies that they had done: but it was the meryte of our forefathers, that they wolde be priuated fro the company of ſo noble barons: and we theyr chylderne fro the pouder of ſo renowmed ſages. I can not tell whiche is the greatter, the fantaſye that I haue to thyn yle, or the compaſſion of myſerable Rome. I do pray the as my frende, and commaunde the as my ſeruant, to regarde the places that I haue ſhewed the. For it is a iuſte thyng, and moſt iuſte, that ſuche cities be priuileged by them that lyueth, whan they are peopled with ſuche deade wyſe men.

And more ouer, Centurion knoweth by wordes, the heuy caſe, that theſe priſoners had with vs, and we with them, the day of the feaſte of mother Berecyntia. I ſaye, I ſawe not that day ſo moch crueltie in Rome, as we cauſed infamye throughe all the empire. Rome, that neuer was ouercome, by them that were valyant and vertuous, that daye we ſawe ouergone, and troden vnder foote, by thoſe foles. The walles of Rome, that were neuer touched by the Poeniens, had that day their lowpes ful of armed trewandes: Rome that triumphed ouer al realmes, was triumphed vpon that day, with tomblers and iuglers. I am ſo abaſhed in this caſe, that I wot not what to ſay or to write. Yet one thing cōforteth me, that ſith Rome &amp; the Romayns vniuſtly doo reioyce with theſe fooles: ſhe and the famous wyſe men, iuſtly ſhalbe chaſtiſed for theſe foles. And in this the goddis ſhall not be diſpleaſed, that ſythe Rome laugheth at theſe trewandies and mockeries, one day ſhe ſhal wepe, with theſe tomblers and iuglers. I banyſſhe all theſe for euer fro Rome, not for the bloudde that they haue ſhedde, but for the hartes, that they haue peruerted: not for the occaſion of any that be deed, but bicauſe they were maiſters of folies. Without cōpariſon it is greatter offence to the goddis, and more domage to the cōmon welthe, theſe trewandes to take away the wyttes fro the wyſe folkes, than the murtherers to take away mens lyues. If the greatteſt gyfte, amonge all gyftes of fortune, be, to kepe a good wit, let no manne preſume, to be of a reſtfull vnderſtandynge, that is an extreme frende to theſe trewandes. Beleue me one thinge. As one byrde loueth an other, and one beſte an other, and one wyſe man an other: ſo one fooole loueth an other foole.
               ¶I remēbre, on a day, as I reuolued the regyſters in the Capitoll, I redde a ryght meruaylous thyng of Oruetus

a famous oratour, which is buryed in the yle of Heleſpōt, on the moūt Adamantine, Whan great Scipio came fro the warre of the Poeniens, better accompanied with hunger ſtoruen trewandes, than with valyant capitaynes, he ſayde to hym: Of trouthe, it is great ſhame to the, and a ſmall honour to the ſenate, that thou, that haſte ouercome the wyſe Affres, and beinge ſoo wyſe thy ſelfe, and of the blode of the wyſe Romaynes, wylte be accompanied with theſe trewandes and fooles. In that vnhappy realme, all the wiſe men coude not ouercome one, that was thoughte ſo mighty, amonge ſo many fooles. I ſay to the, that thy wyt is in more peryll here in Rome, thā thy life in Affrike. ¶Theſe were good wordes, and not of no worldely malyce. And within a ſhorte whyle after, and by dyuers lyght perſons, and for a ſmall occaſion, this poore olde oratour, and ryche philoſopher, by the frendes of Scipio, was banyſhed Rome, and ſent into that yle.
               ¶Than behold Lambert, let vs returne to theſe iuglers, and trewandes. Whan they ar landed in that yle, let them go franke &amp; fre, ſo that they vſe not their accuſtomed toys. Thou ſhalt conſtrayne them to labour, and chaſtiſe them, yf they be ydell. For theſe myſerable folke, fleing from iuſt trauayle, take on them vniuſt ydelnes, &amp; conuert mo men with their trewandyſe, than if open ſcooles of vacaboundes were kepte. There is nothing that our forfathers did, that diſpleaſeth me ſoo moche, as the ſufferaunce of theſe vnthrifty trewandes.
               ¶In the yere .CCxxvi. of the foundation of Rome, in the tyme of an horrible peſtilence in Italy, to reioyce the people, was firſt founde out the inuention of Theatres, by the aduiſe of the trewandes. It is a ſhameful thynge to here, that the peſtylence duryd but two yeres, and the rage of theſe vnthriftes, dureth .iiii.C. yeres.
               
                  ¶Lamberte, I beleue well, that the complayntes, that theſe priſoners haue begon here, ſhall neuer haue an ende there. Howe be it, I care not: for the grudge of them, that be ylle, iuſtifieth the iuſtice and ſentence of theym, that be good. As the mayſter of Nero ſayde: As moche as the ſhame of ſynne oughte to be fledde of them, that be good, ſo moche prayſe, is the infamye of the yll. I ſhall telle the one thynge, to the intent, that the chaſtyſement ſhulde not ſeme cruell to the. Seynge the emperours of Rome are ful of clemency to ſtraungers, it is no reaſon, that they ſhulde be to ſharpe to theyr owne. Sythe fatall deſtenyes hath brought me into this worlde, I haue ſene nothynge more vnprofytable to the common welthe, nor greatter folye in them, that be lyght of condicions, nor a worſe inuention for vacabūdes, nor a more cold reuocation of mortal folke, thā to lerne of theſe gamners &amp; trifelers, &amp; ſuch other iuglers. What thing is more mōſtrous, thā to ſe wiſe men reioyce at the paſtime of theſe vaine trifelers? what greatter mockery can be in the capitoll, thā the folyſhe ſayinge of a geſtour, to be prayſed with gret laughter of wiſe mē? what greater ſclaunders can be to princis houſes, than to haue their gates always open, to receiue in theſe foles, and neuer open to wiſe folkes? what gretter crueltie can there be in any perſon, than to giue more in one day to a fole, thā to his ſeruantes in a yere, or to his kin, al his life? what gretter inconſtācie can there be, than to want men to furniſhe the gariſons and frontiers of Illirico, and theſe trewādes to abide at Rome? what like ſhame can there be to Rome, than yt the memory ſhalbe left more in Italy, of theſe tomblers, trewādes, pypers, ſingers of geſtes, tabourers, cruders, dcāers, mōmers, geſters, &amp; iuglers, than the renome of capitains, with their triūphes &amp; arme.s And whan theſe caitifes wādred al about in Rome in ſauetie, ſownīg their

lewdenes, and gaderyng of money: the noble barons and capitaynes, went fro realme to realme, waſting their money, aduenturinge their lyues, and ſhedynge their blode. ¶In the vttermoſt parte of Spayne, whanne warre began betwene the Liberiens and Goditaynes, and they of Liberie laked money: Two iuglers and tabourers, offred to maynteyne the warre a hole yere. And it folowed, that with the goodes of two fooles, many wiſe men were ſlaine and ouercome.
               ¶In Epheſe, a citie of Aſie, the famous temple of Dyana was edified with the confiſcatiō of the goodes, of ſuche a trewande and fole.
               ¶Whan Cadmus edified the citie of Thebes in Egipte, with .l. gates, the mynſtrelles gaue hym more towarde it, than all his frendes.
               ¶If the hiſtories be trew, whan Auguſt edified the walles of Rome, he hadde more of the trewandes, that were drowned in Tybre, than of the common treaſourie. ¶The firſte kynge of Corinth aroſe by ſuche villaynes, I ſawe his ſepulchre at Corynthie. And as I ſaye of theſe ſmal nōbre, I might ſay of many other. Behold than Lā
                  bert, howe littell care the goddis take, and howe variable the caſe of fortune is, and how the dedes of men fal. Som be hadde in memory for their foly, and ſome for their wyſedome. One thinge is come to my minde, of the chaunce of theſe trewandes, and that is: while they be in preſēce, they make euery man to laugh at the folyes, that they do and ſay: and whan they be gone, euery man is ſory for his money, that they bare away. And of trouthe, it is a iuſte ſentence of the goddis, that ſuch as haue taken vayn pleſure togyther, whan they are departed, to weepe for their loſſes. I wyll write noo more vnto the: but I doo ſende the this letter in Greke, to the entente that thou ſhewe it ouer

all the yle. Sende forth ewith the ſhyppes agayne, for they muſte be ſente forthe with prouiſions into Illyryco. Peace be with the Lamberte, helthe and good fortune be with me Marc. The ſenate ſaluteth the. And thou on my behalfe, ſhalte ſhewe to the Ile, the ioyfull happy cuſtomes. My wyfe Fauſtine ſaluteth the, and ſendeth a riche gyrdell to thy doughter. And in recompence of the furres I ſende the ryche iewelles.
            
            
               A letter ſent by Marc themperour to Catulus his ſpeciall frende, of the nouelties of Rome. The xlii. letter.
               
                  MArcus the newe Cenſure, to the Catulus the olde Cenſurine. It is .x. dayes paſt, that in the temple of god Ianus, I receyued thy letter: and I take the ſame god to wytneſſe, that I had rather haue ſene thy perſonne. Thou wryteſte, howe my writynge is longe, but the ſhortnes of tyme maketh me to aunſwere the more brefely, farre awaye more thanne I wold. Thou deſireſt me, to gyue the knowlege of the newes here. Therto I aunſwere, that it were better to demaunde, if there be any thynge abyden here in Rome or Italy, that is old. For nowe by our heuy deſtenies, al that is good ond olde is ended, and newe thinges, that be yll and deteſtable, we may ſe dayly. Themperour, the Conſule, the Trybune, the Senatours, the Ediles, the Flamynes, the Pretours, the Centurions, all theſe thinges be newe, but the vilanies, that ben olde, &amp; al paſſeth to make newe offices, and to ordeyne ſtatutes and practykes, to come to the counceles, and to reyſe vp ſubſidies. In ſuche wiſe, yt there hath ben nowe mo nouelties

within theſe .iiii. yeres, than in time paſſed in .iiii.C. yeres. We nowe aſſemble together a. iii.C. to counſell in the capitoll, and there we blaſon and boſte, ſwere, and promiſe, that ſome of vs maye ſubdue and put vnder other, to fauour one, and diſtroye an other, other to chaſtiſe the yl and reward the good: To repaire olde, and edifie newe: to plucke vices vp by the rootes, and to plante vertues: to amende the olde, and folowe the good: to reproue tyrauntes, and aſſiſte the poore: and whenne that we are goone from thens, they that ſpake beſte wordes, are often taken with the worſte dedes. O heuy Rome, that nowe adayes hath ſuche Senatours, that in ſaying, we ſhal do, we ſhal do, paſſeth theyr lyfe: and than euery man, ſekyng for his owne profyte, forgetteth the common welth. Oftentymes I am in the Senate, to beholde other, as they regard me: and I am abaſhed, to here the eloquence of their wordes, the zele of Iuſtyce, and the iuſtification of their perſones: and after that I come thens, I am aſhamed, to ſe their ſecrete extorcions, their damnable thoughtes, and theyr yll werkes, ſoo playnely manyfeſte. And yet there is an other thynge of more meruayle, and not to be ſuffred, that ſuche perſonnes, as are mooſte defamed, and vſe mooſte dyſhoneſt vices, with their moſt damnable intentiōs, make their auowes to do moſte cruell Iuſtice. It is an ineffable rule, and of humayn malyce mooſte vſed, that he that is moſte hardy, to commytte greatteſt crimes, is moſt cruel, to giue ſentence ageynſt an other for the ſame offence. Me thinke, that we regard our owne crimes, as throughe ſmalle nettes, that cauſeth thinges to ſeme the leſſer. And we remē
                  bre the fautes of other, in the water, that cauſeth thynges to ſeme greatter than they be. O howe many haue I ſene condēpned to be hanged by the ſenate, for one ſmal faute, done in all the lyfe, and yet they commytte the ſame faute

euery houre.
               ¶I haue redde, that in the tyme of Alexander the great, there was a renoumed pirate or a rouer on the ſee, whiche robbed and drowned all ſhyppes, that he coude gette: and by commaundement of this good kynge Alexander, there was an army ſent forthe to take hym. And whan he was taken, and preſented to Alexander, the kyng ſayd to hym: Shewe me Dionides, why doſte thou kepe the ſee in danger, that no ſhyp can ſayle out of the eaſt into the weſte, for the? The Pyrate anſwered, and ſayd: If I kepe the ſee in daungier, why doſte thou Alexander, kepe all the ſee and lande as loſte? O Alexander, bycauſe I fyghte with one ſhyppe in the ſee, I am callyd a theefe, and bycauſe thou robbeſt with .ii.C. ſhyppes on the ſee, and troubleſt all the worlde with two .C. thouſande men, thou arte called an emperour. I ſweare to the Alexander, yf fortune were as fauourable to me, and the goddis as extreme ageinſt the: they wolde gyue me thyne empire, and gyue the my lyttel ſhyppe, and than peraduenture, I ſhuld be a better kynge than thou art, and thou a wors thefe than I am. ¶Theſe were high wordes, and well receyued of Alexander: and of trouth, to ſe if his wordes were correſpondent to his promyſes, he made hym from a pyrate to a great capitayne of an army: and he was more vertuous on land, than he was cruell on the ſee.
               ¶I promyſe the Catulus, Alexander dyd right well therin, and Dionides was to be prayſed gretly, for that he had ſayd. Now adays in Italy, they that robbe openly, are called lordes: and they that robbe priuely, ar called theues.
                ¶In the yere bokes of Liuius, I haue redde, that in the ſeconde troublous warre punyke, betwene the Romaynes and Carthaginens, there camme an ambaſſadoure Luſytayne, ſent fro Spayne, to treate for accorde of peace.

Whan he came to Rome, he proued before the ſenate, that ſythe he entred into Italye, he had ben .x. tymes robbed of his goodes, and whyles he was at Rome, he had ſene one of them that robbed hym, hange vp an other, that had defended hym. He ſeinge ſoo ylle a dede, and howe the thefe was ſaued without Iuſtyce, as a deſperate manne, toke a cole, and wrote on the gybet as foloweth.
               ¶O gybet, thou art made among theues, noriſhed amōg theues, cut of theues, wrought of theues, made of theues, ſet among theues, and thou arte peopled with innocentis. ¶And there as I red theſe wordis, was in the original of Lyuius, and in his hiſtories. I ſwere to the by the immortall goddis, that all the Decade was written with blacke ynke, and theſe wordes with redde vermylon. I canne not tell, what wordes I ſhulde ſende the, but that euery thing is ſo newe and ſo tender, and is ioyned with ſo yll ſyment, that I feare me, all wyll fall ſodeynly to the playne erthe. I tell the, that ſome are ſodaynly ryſen within Rome vnto valour, to whom I wyll rather aſſure their fall, than their lyfe. For all buyldynge haſtely made, can not be ſure. The longer a tree is kepte in his kynde, the longer it wyll be er it be olde. The trees, whoſe fruite we eate in ſommer, doo warme vs in wynter. O howe many haue we ſeene, wherof we haue meruayled of their ryſynge, and ben abaſſhed of their falles. They haue growen as a hole piece, and ſodeynly waſted as a ſcomme. Their felicitie hath ben but a ſhort point, &amp; their infortune as a longe lyfe. Finally, they haue are died the myll, &amp; armed it with ſtones of encreace. and after a lyttell grindinge, left it in vtyle al the hole yere after. Thou knoweſt wel, my frend Catulus, that we haue ſene Cincius Fuluius in one yere made Conſule, and his chyldren tribunes, and his wyfe a matron for yonge maydens, and beſyde that, made keper of the capitol, and after

that not in one yere but the ſame day we ſaw Cincius beheeded in the place, his chylderne drowned in Tybre, his wyfe banyſſhed froo Rome, his howſe raced downe to the grounde, and all his good confyſked to the common treaſourie. This rigorous example we haue not redde in any boke to take a copie of it, but we haue ſene it with our eies to kepe it in our myndes. As the nations of people ar variable, ſo are the condicions of men dyuers, and appetites of mortall folke: and me thynketh this is true, ſeing that ſome loue, ſome hate, and that that ſome ſeke, ſome eſcheweth: And that that ſome ſetteth lytel by, other make of. In ſuch wiſe that al can not be contēt with one thing, nor ſome with all thinges can not be ſatisfied. Let euery man chuſe as hym lyſt, and enbrace the worlde whan he wylle, I had rather mount a ſofte pace to the fallynge, and yf I can not come therto, I wyll abyde by the way, rather than with ſweatte to mount haſtily, and than to tumble downe heedlyng. In this caſe ſith mens hartes vnderſtand it, we nede not to write further with pennes. And of this matter regarde not the lyttell that I do ſaye, but the greate deale that I wyl ſay. And ſith I haue begon, and art in ſtrange landes, I wyll write the al the newes fro hens. This yere the .xxv. day of May, there came an ambaſſadour out of Aſie, ſayinge he was of the yle of Cetyn, a barone ryghte elegant of body, ruddy of aſpect, and right hardy of courage. He conſidered being at Rome, though the ſommers dayes were longe, yet wynter wolde drawe on, and than wolde it be daungerous ſaylynge into his yle: and ſawe that his beſynes was not diſpatched: On a daye being at the gate of the ſenate, ſeinge all the Senatours entre in to the Capitolle, without any armour vpon them, he as a man of good ſpirite, and zelatour of his countreye, in the preſence of vs all, ſayd theſe wordes:
               
                  ¶O fathers conſcripte, O happy people, I am come fro a ſtraunge countreye to Rome, onely to ſee Rome, and I haue founde Rome without Rome: The walles wherewith it is incloſed, hath not broughte me hyther, but the fame of them that gouerne it. I am not come to ſe the treſourie, wherin is the treaſure of all realmes: but I am come to ſe the ſacred ſenate, out of the whyche iſſueth the counſell for al men. I came not to ſe you, bycauſe ye vanquiſhe all other, but bycauſe I thought you more vertuous than all other. I dare well ſay one thinge, excepte the goddis make me blynd, and trouble myn vnderſtanding, ye be not Romayns of Rome, nor this is not Rome of the Romayns your predeceſſours. We haue harde in our yle, that dyuers realmes ben wonne by the valyātnes of one, and conſerued by the wyſedome of all the ſenate: and at this houre ye are more lyke to be diſtroyed, than to wynne as your fathers dydde: all their exerciſe was in goodnes, and ye that are their chyldren, paſſe all your tyme in cerymonies. I ſay this ye Romayns, bycauſe ye haue almoſte kylde me with laughinge at you, to ſe howe ye doo all as moche your diligence to leaue your armure withoute the gate of the ſenate, as your predeceſſours dyd to take them to defende the empire. What profyte is it to you to leaue your armes for the ſureties of your perſonnes, and putte them on, wherwith ye ſlee all the worlde? What profiteth it to the thoughtfull ſuiter, that the ſenatour entreth vnarmed into the ſenate without ſwerde or dagger: and his harte entreth into the ſenate armed with malyce? O Romaynes, I wyll ye knowe, that in our yle we hold you not as armed Capitayns, but as malicious ſenators: not with ſharpe grounden ſwerdes &amp; daggers, but with hard hartis and venomous tongues ye feare vs. If ye ſhuld in the ſenate put on harnes, &amp; therwith take away your lyues, it

were but a ſmall loſſe, ſeinge that ye ſuſteyn not the innocentes, nor diſpatche not the buſineſſes of ſuters, I can not ſuffre it. I can not telle in what ſtate ye ſtande here at Rome: for in our ile we take armour from foles, whether your armours are take awaye as fro foles or madde folkes, I wote not. If it be done for ambitiouſnes, it cometh not of Romaynes, but of tyrantes, that wranglers and ireful folke ſhuld not be iuges ouer the peaſible, &amp; the ambicious ouer the meke, and the malicious ouer the ſymple. If it be done bicauſe ye be foles, it is not in the law of the goddis, that .iii.C. foles ſhuld gouerne .iii.C.M. wiſe men. It is a longe ſeaſon that I haue taried for myn aunſwere and licence, and by your madnes I am now farder of, thā I was the fyrſt day. We brynge oyle, hony, ſaffron, wood, and timber, ſalt, ſiluer, and gold out of our yle into Rome: and ye wyl that we go elles where to ſeke iuſtice. Ye wyll haue one lawe to gather your rentes, and an other to determyne our Iuſtices. ye wyl that we pay our tributes in one day, and ye wyll not diſcharge one of our errandes in a hole yere. I require you Romayns determine your ſelfes to take away our lyues, and ſo we ſhal ende: or els here our complayntes, to thentent that we may ſerue you. For in an other maner it may be than ye know by heringe with your eares, which peraduenture ye wold not ſe with your eien. And if ye think my wordes be out of meſure: ſo that ye wyl remedy my contrey, I ſet not by my lyfe. And thus I make an ende. Verily frend Catulo theſe be the wordes, that he ſpake to the ſenate, whiche I gat in writing. I ſay of trouth, that the hardines, that the Romaynes were wōt to haue in other countres, the ſame as nowe ſtraungers haue in Rome. There were that ſayde, that this ambaſſadour ſhoulde be chaſtiſed, but the goddis forbyd: that for ſayinge trouth in my preſence, he ſhulde haue ben correct.

It is inough and to moch to, to ſuffre theſe euyls, though we ſlee nor perſecute thoſe that aduertyſe and warne vs of them. The ſhepe ar not in ſuretie of the wolfe, but if the ſhepard haue his dogge with him. I mene, dogges ought not to leaue barkynge for to awake the ſhepardes. There is no god commaundeth, nor lawe counſayleth, nor common welthe ſuffreth, that they whiche are commytted to chaſtyſe lyers, ſhuld hang them that ſay trouth. And ſith the ſenatours ſhewe them ſelfe men in their lyuinge, and ſometyme more humayne than other that be ſlaues, who elles ſhulde delyuer them fro chaſtiſement? O Rome and no Rome, hauyng nothyng but the name of Rome, where is nowe become the noblenes of thy triumphes, the glorie of chy chyldren, the rectitude of thy Iuſtice, and the honour of thy temples? for as nowe they chaſtiſe hym more that murmureth agaynſte one only Senatour, than they do them that blaſpheme al the goddes at ones. For it greueth me more to ſe a Senatour or cenſure to be worſte of all other, than it diſpleaſeth me, that it ſhuld be ſaid, that he is the beſt of all other. For a trouthe I ſaye to the my frende Catulus, that as nowe we nede not to ſeke to the goddes in the temples, for the Senatours are made goddes in our handes. This is the difference betwene theym that ben immortall, and they that be mortall. For the goddis neuer do thynge that is yll, and the Senatours doo neuer good thynge: the goddes neuer lye, and they neuer ſay trouthe: the goddis pardon often, and they neuer forgyue: the goddis are content to be honoured .v. tymes in the yere, and the Senatours wolde be honoured .x. tymes a day. What wylt thou that I ſhulde ſay more? but what ſo euer the goddes do, they ought to be prayſed: and the ſenatours in all theyr workes deſerue to be reproued. Fynally I conclude, that the goddis aſſure and affirme euery

thynge, and they erre and fayle in nothynge: and the ſenatours aſſure nothynge, but erre in all thynges: onely for one thynge the ſenatours are not of reaſone to be chaſtyſed: and that is, whan they intende not to amend theyr fautes, they wylle not ſuffre the oratours to waſte theyr tyme to ſhewe them the trouth. Be it as maye be, I am of the opinion, that what man or woman, withdraweth their eares fro heryng of trouth, impoſſible it is for them to applye theyr hartes to loue any vertues: Be it cenſure that iugeth, or ſenatour that ordeyneth, or emperour that commaundeth, or conſule that executethe, or oratour that precheth. No mortall man, take he neuer ſo good hede to his werkes, nor reaſon ſo well in his deſires, but that he deſerueth ſome chaſtiſement for ſome cauſe or counſaylle in his doinges. And ſith I haue written to the thus of other, I wyll ſomwhat ſpeake of my ſelfe, bycauſe of the wordes of thy letter. I haue gathered, that thou deſireſt to knowe of my perſonne. Knowe thou for certayne, that in the kalendes of Ianuarye I was made cenſure in the ſenate, the whiche offyce I deſired not, nor I haue not deſerued it. The opynion of all wyſe men is, that noo manne, without he lacke wytte, or ſurmounteth in foly, wyll gladdely take on hym the burden and charges of other menne: A greatter caſe it is for a ſhamefaſte man to take on hym an office to pleaſe euerye man, for he muſte ſhewe a countenaunce outwarde, contrarye to that he thynketh inwarde. Thou wylte ſaye, that the good are ordeyned to take the charge of offices. O vnhappye Rome, that hathe wylled to take me in ſuche wyſe, as to be the beſte in it. Greuous peſtylence ought to come for them that be good, ſith I am ſcaped as good amonge the yll. I haue accepted this offyce, not for that I had any nede therof, but to ſatisfie the deſyres of my wyfe Fauſtine, and to fulfyll the commaundement

of Anthonius my grauntfather. Haue no meruayle of any thynge that I do, but of that I leaue to be doone. For any man that is wedded to Fauſtyne, there is no vylany but he ſhal do it. I ſwere to the, that ſith the daye we were wedded, me ſemethe that I haue no wytte. I leaue weddynge for this tyme, and retourne to ſpeake of offices. Surely a peaſible man ought to be in offices, thoughe it be peynefull: for as the offyces are aſſured amonge theym that be vertuous, ſo perillouſly gothe the vertuous folke amonge offices. And for the trouthe hereof recken what they wynne, and than thou ſhalt ſe what they loſe. Saye that is good, if thou knoweſt it, and here the yl, if thou deſyre to knowe it. He that wyll take the charge to gouerne other, he ſeketh thought and trouble for hym ſelfe, enuye for his neyghbours, ſpourres for his ennemies, pouertie for his ryches, awakynge of theues, peryl for his body, an ende of his dayes, and tourmente for his good renoume. Fynally he ſeketh awaye to reiecte his frendes, and a repeale to recouer his ennemies. O an vnhappy man is he, that taketh on hym the charge of chyldren of manye mothers, for he ſhalbe always charged with thoughtes, how he ſhulde content them all: ful of ſighes bycauſe one hath to gyue hym: feare that one ſhulde take fro hym, wepyng if he leſe, and ſuſpection that they infame hym. He that knoweth this, without longe tarienge ought to ſette a bridel at his heed. But I ſaye of one, as I ſaye of an other. For I wyll ſwere, and thou wylt not deny it, that we may finde ſome nowe adays, that had rather be in the parke to fight ayenſt the bulles, thā be in ſuretie vpon the ſcaffold. Oftentimes I haue hard ſay: Go we to the Theatres to renne at the bulles: go we to chaſe the hartes and wylde boores: and whā they come there, they renne away, not the beſtes fro them, but they fro the beaſtes. In ſuche wyſe as

they went runnyng, they returne agein fleinge. I ſay theſe ambicious perſones procure to gouerne: &amp; are gouerned: they commaund, and are commaunded, they rule and are ruled: and finally thinkynge to haue dyuers vnder theyr handes, theſe wretches put them ſelues vnder euery mās fote. For the remedy of all theſe perylles my thoughte is comforted with one thing, and that is without procuryng or offeryng my ſelfe, the ſenate of their owne wylle hathe commaunded me. In the .viii. table of our ancient lawes be theſe wordes. We commaunde that in our ſacred ſenate charge of iuſtyce be neuer giuen to him that wyllingly offreth hym ſelfe to it, but to ſuch as by rype deliberation be choſen. This is certainely a iuſte lawe. For men nowe be not ſo vertuous nor ſo louinge to the cōmon welth, yt they wyl forget their owne quietnes and reſt, doing domage to them ſelfe, to ꝓcure an other mans profite. There is none ſo folyſhe, that wyl leue his wife, childrē, &amp; his owne ſwete countrey, to go into ſtrange countreis, but if he ſe him ſelf amonge ſtrange people, thinkyng vnder the colour of iuſtice to ſeke for his own vtilitie. I ſay not this without wepyng, that the princis with their ſmalle ſtudy &amp; thought, &amp; the iuges with their couetyſe, haue vndermyned &amp; ſhaken down the high walles of the policie of Rome. O my frend Catulus, what wylte thou that I ſhulde ſay, but that our credēce ſo miniſheth, our couetiſe ſo largely ſtretcheth, our hardines ſo boldeth, our ſhamfaſtnes ſo ſhameles, that we prouide for iuges to go &amp; robbe our neyghbours as capytayns ageinſt our ennemies? I lette the to wyte, where as Rome was beloued for chaſtiſing the yl, nowe it is as moche hated for diſpoylyng of innocentes. I do remembre, yt I red, in the tyme of Denis Syracuſan, that ruled al Sicile, there came an ambaſſadour fro Rhodes to Rome, beinge of a good age, welle lerned, and valyaunt in armes,

and ryght curious to regarde euerye thynge. He came to Rome to ſe the maieſtie of the ſacred ſenate: the height of the high capitol enuironned with the Colliſet: the multytude of ſenatours: the wyſedome of the counſaylours, the glorie of triumphes: the correction of the yll, the peace of the inhabytauntes, the diuerſitie of nations: the haboundance of the mayntenaunce, the order of the offyces, and finally ſeinge that Rome was Rome, he was demaunded howe he ſemed therby: He anſwered and ſayde, O Rome in this thy preſent worlde, thou arte fulle of vertues and wyſe men, hereafter thou ſhalt be furniſhed with foles. Lo what high and very high wordes were theſe? Rome was vi.C. yeres without nycetie of howſes of foles, and now it hath ben .iii.C. yeres without one wyſe or vertuous. Loke what I ſay, it is no mockery but of trouthe, If the pitiefull goddis nowe adayes dyd reyſe our predeceſſours fro dethe to lyfe, eyther they wold not knowe vs for their chylderne, or elles attache vs for fooles. Theſe be thinges vſed in Rome, but thou ſendeſt noo worde of that is vſed in Agrippine. I wyll write nothynge to the, to put the to peyne: write to me ſome thynge to reioyce me, if thy wife Dynſilla chanced well of the flote that came out of Cetin with ſalte, oyle, and honye, I cauſed hit to be well prouided for her. Wyte thou, that Flodius our vncle was caſte downe by rage of his hors, and is deceaſſed. Laertia and Collodius are frendes togyther, by occaſyon of a maryage. I do ſend the a gowne, I pray to the goddis to ſende the ioy therof. My wife Fauſtin ſaluteth the. Recōmende me to Iamyro thy ſonne. The goddis haue the in keping: and contrary fortune be fro me. Marcus thy frende to the Catulus his owne.
            
            
               
               ¶A letter ſent by Marke the emperour to the amorous ladyes of Rome, bycauſe they made a playe of hym. The .xiiii. letter.
               
                  MArke oratour lerninge at Rodes the arte of humanite, to you amorous ladies of Rome ſalutation to your perſones, and amendement of your deſyred lyfe. It is writen to me▪ that at the feaſte of the mother of the goddes Berecynthia, all ye togyther there preſent played, and geſted on me: wherin ye layde for an example my lyfe and my renoume. It is ſhewed me, that Auilina compoſed it, Lucia Fulua wrote it, and thy ſelfe Toringula dyd ſinge it, and ye all together dyd preſent it to the Theatre: ye haue portrayed and paynted me in dyuers maners, with a boke in my hande, tourned contrary, as a fayned philoſopher: with a tongue alonge, as a bold ſpeker without meaſure: with a horne on my heed, a common cuckolde: with a nettell in my hande, as a trembling louer: with a baner fallen downe, as a cowarde capitayn: with halfe a berde, as a femynate man: with a clothe afore myne eies, as a condempned vacabound: and yet not content with this, but the other day ye portrayed me in a new maner. Ye made my figure with fete of ſtraw, my legges of ambre, my knees of wod, the thyghes of braſſe, the belye of horne, the armes of pytche, the handes of mace, the heed of yeſſo, the eares of an aſſe, the eies of a ſerpente, the heares as rotes iagged, the tethe of a catte, the tonge of a ſcorpion, and the foreheed of leade: wherin was wryten in two lynes theſe letters, M, N, T, N, I, S, V, S, the whiche meneth (as I do take it) The mortall man taketh not the ſtatute ſo ſtrange, as the doublenes of the lyfe: &amp; than ye went to the ryuer, and therin tyed his heed dounwarde

a hole day. And if the lady Meſſalyn had not ben, I think it had ben tyed there tyll nowe. And nowe ye amorous ladyes haue written to me a letter by Fuluius Fabritius, wherof I receiued no peyn, but as an amorous man, from the handes of ladyes I take it as a mockerie. And to thentente that I ſhulde haue no tyme for to thynke theron, ye ſende to wyt a queſtion of me, that is: if I haue founde in my writynges, wherof, by whom, where, whan, what, and howe the fyrſte women were made. And bycauſe my complexion is to take mockes for mockynges, and ſyth ye demaunde it, I ſhall ſhewe it: you and your frendes and myne, and ſpecially Fuluius your meſſager hath deſired me therto. There is nothyng wherof I complayne, but I wyll holde my peace, ſaue to your letter and demaunde I wyll anſwere. And ſith there hath ben none for to aſke the queſtion, I proteſt that to none other, but to you amorous women of Rome, I ſende myn anſwere. And if any other honeſt lady wyll take the demaunde of you, it is a token that ſhe hathe enuy of the office that ye be of. Certaynly if any lady ſheweth her ſelfe annoyed with your peyne openly, fro henſforthe I condempne her, that ſhe kepe no faut that ſhe knoweth in ſecrete. They that be on the ſtage, fere not the roringe of the bulle: and he that is in a dongeon, feareth not the ſhotte of artillerie. I wyl ſaye, a woman of good lyfe, feareth no man with an yll tongue. The good Matrones may kepe me for their perpetuall ſeruant, and they that be yll for their chiefe ennemie. Nowe to anſwere the queſtion, to knowe werof the fyrſt women were made: I ſay that accordynge to the dyuerſitie of nations, that be in the worlde, dyuers opynions I fynde in this caſe. The Egiptiens ſaye, that whan the flode of Nyle ranne abrode, and watred the erth, there abode certayne pieces of erthe cleuynge to gether lyke greace, and thanne the

heate commynge in them created many wyld beaſtes: and ſo amonge them was founde the fyrſte woman. Note ye ladies, that it was neceſſarie, that the flode of Nyle ſhuld flowe ouer his brimmes, that the firſt woman myghte be made on the erthe. All creatures are bredde in the entrailes of their mothers, excepte the woman that was bredde without a mother. And this ſemeth true, that without mothers ye were borne, bicauſe without rule ye lyue, &amp; without order ye dye. Verily he putteth him ſelfe to many trauayles, and hath many wyles to fynde, and many times to thynke, and to aſke many ſuccours, and to abyde many yeres, and to chuſe amonge many women, that wyll rule one onely wyfe by reaſon. Be the beaſtes neuer ſoo cruelle and fierce, at the laſte the lyon is ledde of his keper without any bande: The bulle is cloſed in the parke: the brydell ruleth the hors, a lyttell hooke catcheth the fyſhe, and the wolfe ſuffreth to be tyed: onely a woman is a beaſt vnable to be tamed, and neuer leſeth her boldnes for any thīg that is commaunded her, nor the bridell, for not being cō
                  manded. The goddis haue made men as men, and beeſtis as beaſtis, and the humayne vnderſtandynge very high, and his ſtrength of a great power: but yet is there no mā, be he neuer ſo high, that ſhal ſcape the woman lyghtly, nor defende hym be he neuer ſo ſtronge. But I ſaye to you my ladies: There is no ſpurres that can make you goo, nor raynes that can holde you, nor brydelle that can refrayne you, nor angle or net that can take you: and fynally there is no law can ſubdue you, nor ſhame refrain you, nor feare abaſſhe you, nor chaſtyſemente amende you. O to what an yll aduenture putteth he hym ſelfe, that thynkethe to rule and correcte you. For if ye take an opynion in hande, all the worlde ſhall not drawe you from it: yf a man telle or warne you of any thynge, ye wylle neuer beleue hym:

If one gyue you good counſell, ye wyll not take it: if one threaten you, anone ye complayne: if one flatter you, thā ye waxe proude: if one reioyce not in you, ye are ſpitefull: if one forbeare you, it maketh you bolde: if ye be chaſtyſed, ye tourne to ſerpentes: Fynally a woman wyll neuer forgyue any iniurie, nor gyue thanke for any good dede. Nowe adayes the moſte ſymple of all women, I ſweare, wyll ſweare, that ſhe knoweth leſſe than ſhe dothe: and of trouthe the mooſte wyſeſt mans wytte ſhall fayle in their reaſons: and yet the wyſeſt of theym ſwarueth frome all wyſedom. Wyll ye know my ladyes, howe lytle ye knowe, and howe moche ye be ignorant? That is, ye determyne ſodenly in harde thynges of grauitie, as if ye had ſtudied for it a. M. yeres: and if any gayneſay you, ye take hym as a mortall enmy. Hardy is that woman, that dare gyue counſell to a man, but he is more hardier that taketh it of a woman. But I ſay he is a fole that taketh it, and he more foole that aſketh it, and he is moche more folyſhe that fulfylleth it. Myn opinion is, that he yt wyll not falle amonge ſo many ſtones, nor pricke him amonge ſo many thornes, nor blyſter hym amonge ſoo many nettyls, lette hym here what I wyll ſay, and doo as ye ſhall ſee: ſpeake welle and worke yll: In promyſinge promyſe moche, In fulfyllyng fulfyll nothynge, and fynallye allowe your wordes, and condemne your counſelles. If one ſhulde demande nowe adayes of dyuers ryght renoumed perſonnes, that benne deed, howe they dydde with the counſelle of women whan they lyued: I am ſure they wold not haue ryſen than to beleue them, nor at this houre to be reuyued agayne to here them. Howe was kyng Philip of Macedon with Olympias? Parys with Helayne? Alexander with Roſane? Eneas with Dydo? Hercules with Deyanira? Hanyball with Thamyra? Nero with Agrippine? And if ye wyl not

beleue what they ſuffred with them, demande of me howe I do amonge other. O ye women, I remembryng that I am borne of one of you, abhorre my lyfe: and I, thinkyng that I lyue with you, deſyre deathe. For there is none other deathe as to treate with you, and no better lyfe than to flee fro you. It is a common ſayinge amonge women, that we men be vnkynde, bycauſe we beinge borne in your entrayles, do entreate you as bond women and ſeruantis: and ye ſay, ſyth ye beare vs with peryll, and nouriſſhe vs with trauayle, that it were conuenient and iuſt that we always ſhulde be occupied in your ſeruyces. Oftentymes I haue ſtudied, why men deſyre women ſo moche. There is no eyes, but they oughte to wepe, no harte but it ſhoulde breake, no ſpirite but it ſhulde be ſorowfull to ſe a wyſe mā loſte by a foolyſhe woman. The foolyſhe louer paſſeth the day to ſatisfie his ſyght, the darke nyghte to tomble with vayne thoughtes: one day heryng tidynges, an other day he offereth ſeruice: one tyme louynge darkenes, an other tyme he hateth lyght: he dyeth with company, and lyueth ſolytarie: and finally the poore foolyſhe louer may that he wyl not, and wylleth that he may not. More ouer the coū
                  ſell of his frendes profiteth hym not, nor the ſhame of his enmies, nor loſſe of his goodes, nor the aduenture of honour, nor looſynge of his lyfe, nor ſekynge of deathe, nor comynge nere, nor goinge ferre, nor ſeinge with eyes, nor herynge with eares, nor taſtyng with mouthe, nor yet feelynge of hande: and finally to attayne vyctorie, he hathe alway warre agaynſt him ſelfe. I wold theſe louers knew fro whens loue procedeth, it is this: The entrayles that we are bredde in, is of fleſhe: the breſtes that we ſucke, are of fleſhe: the armes that we are nouriſhed in, be of fleſhe: the werkes that we doo, are of the fleſhe, by the which occaſions commeth the repeale of our fleſhe to their fleſſhe.

Many free hartes falle into the ſnares of loue. It ſemeth well my ladies, that ye are brought vp in puddels, as the Egiptiēs ſay: The puddels kepe no clere water to drinke, nor fruite to eate, nor fyſhe to be taken, nor veſſell to ſayle with: I do ſay ye are fowle in your lyuynge, ſhamefull in your perſons, in aduerſytie feble and lethy, in proſperitie ſubtyll and wyly: falſe in wordes, doubtfull in your werkes: In hatynge ye kepe a diſorder, extreme to loue, auaricious to gyue, vnſhamfaſte to take: and I ſaye ye are a receite of feare, where as wyſe men finde perille, and ſimple men ſuffre. In you wiſe men holde their renomes diſalowed, and the ſymple men their lyfe in penury. ¶Let vs leaue the opinyon of the Egyptiens, and come to the Grekes, whiche ſay, that in the deſertes of Arabye the ſonne ſhyneth moſte hote: and they ſay, that at the begynnynge there appered a woman alone with a byrde called Phenyx, the whyche byrde they ſay, was created of the water, and the woman of the great heate of the ſonne, and of the corruption of the powdre that falleth fro the trees, whiche the wormes do eate. In this wyſe there was a tree ſoore eaten with wormes, and it chaunced by heate of the ſonne, and dryth of the powder, that a fyre kendled, and ſoo brente it: and than of the fyre and powder of the ſayd brent tree, the fyrſte woman was made. And though I be a philoſopher Romayne, I wyll not ſay, that the opinyon of the philoſopher greke was yll. For of truthe ye ladyes that be amorous, haue your tonges of the nature of fyre, &amp; your condicions of the rottennes of the pouder of wood. After the diuerſite of beeſtis, nature hath put ſome ſtrēgth in dyuers partis of their bodyes, as the egle in the beake, the vnicorne in the horne, the ſerpent in the tayle, the bull in the heed, the beare in the armes, the hors in the breſt, the dogge in his tethe, the hogge in the groyne, the wod doue

in her wynges, and women in their tonges. Of trouth the flyghte of the wood doue is not ſo highe as the fantaſie of your folyes, nor the catte ſcratcheth not ſo ſoore with her nayles, as ye ſcratche foles with your importunities: nor the dogge hurteth not them, that he renneth at, as ye doo the ſorowfull louer that ſeruethe you: nor he is not in ſoo greatte perill of his lyfe that catcheth the bulle by the hornes, as the good fame of the louer is that falleth into your handes. And finally the ſerpent hath not ſo moche poyſon in his tayle, as ye haue in your tongues. Set all the good Romayne ladyes apart: for there be many, of whom there is no complaynt of their perſones, nor ſuſpection of their good names. Of all ſuche my letter ſpeketh not, nor my penne writeth not of them, but of other: I ſpeake of women that be ſuche, that all venemous beaſtes haue not ſo moch poyſon in their bodies, as they haue in their tonges. And ſith that the goddis haue commaunded, and our deſtenies do permyt, that the lyfe of men can not paſſe without women: therfore I aduertyſe theſe yonge people, and pray them that be olde, and awake wyſe men, and tech the ſymple, to flee away from women of yl name, rather than from a comon peſtilence.
               ¶Redynge the auncient lawes of Plato, I fynde writen thus: we cōmand, yt al women opēly infamed, be opēly put out of the citie, to thentēt that other ſeing their ſinnes not vnpuniſhed, may abhorre the ſinne for feare to fal into the ſame peyne. Alſo the ſame lawe ſayth: We command, that pardon be giuen to a woman of all the fautes commytted by her owne body, if any amendement be ſene in her: but neuer to pardon theym that haue commytted ſynne with their tonges. For commyttynge ſynne with an yl perſone, is of fragilitie, but with the tongue it is of pure malyce. ¶O diuine Plato, maſter &amp; meaſure of al vnderſtāding,

and prince of all philoſophers, whanne thou madeſte that lawe in the golden world, that there was neuer ſuch ſcarcitie of yll women, and ſo great aboundance of good women in Grece. What ſhall we doo nowe in Rome, where there be ſo many ylle openly, amd ſo fewe good in ſecrete? Naturally they were wonte to be ſhamefaſte in theyr vyſages, temperate in wordes, wyſe of wyt, ſobre in goinge, meke in conuerſation, pitiefull in correction, well regardynge their lyuynge, not kepynge companies, ſtedfaſte in promeſſe, and conſtant in loue. Fynally let not the woman that wyll be good, truſte in the wiſedome of wiſe men, nor in the flatterie of lyghte folkes: But lette her vertuouſly regarde her renoume, and beware alwayes of any manne that maketh her any promys. For after that the flames of Venus be ſet on fire, and Cupide hath ſhot his arrowes, the ryche man offereth all that he hath, the poore man all that he may, the wyſe man ſayth he wyll be her great frēd, and the ſymple alway her ſeruaunt: the wyſe man wyl loſe his lyfe for her, and the foole wyll take his deathe for her. The olde man wyl ſay, he wyl be frend to her frendes: and the yong man wyl ſay, he wyl be ennemie to her enemies. Some wil promys to pay her debtes, and other to reuēge her iniuries. Fynally to hyde their pouertie, and to ſhewe their beautie, they leaue theſe fooles loſing their perſones and good fames. I wille leaue to ſpeake of good women, for it is not myn intent to laye any thynge to theyr charge, but to aduertyſe them well. I demaunde of you amorous ladies, if Platon was there, whan ye made a playe of my lyfe, and drewe my fygure about in Rome? No ſurely, in dede by that I ſe in you at this tyme, it is ſuſpecious that is ſayde of other. For there is but a fewe in Rome, whom Plato and his lawe dothe excuſe. One thynge ye can not deny, if I were the worſte of all menne, at the laſte ye haue

founde the ende of my vilanies. And ye can not denye me, but ſhe that is leaſte yll of you, in all my lyfe I coude not ſhewe the malyce of her lyfe. It is greatte peryll to wyſe women, to be neyghbours to fooles: Great peryll it is to them that be ſhamefaſt, to be with them that be ſhameles: great peryl it is to them that be of a meke and ſtyll maner, to be with them that be bolde and rude: great perylle it is for them that be chaſte, to be with them that lyue in auoutrie: great peryll it is for the honourable, to be with them that be diſfamed. For the women defamed, thinke that all other be defamed, and deſyre that they ſhulde be defamed, and procure to haue them defamed: and ſay they be yll famed. And to thentent to couer theyr owne infamy, they infame all other that be good. O you ladyes in amours, it is longe ſyth ye knew me and I you: and if ye ſpeke, I ſpeke, if ye knowe, I knowe: if ye be ſtyll, I am ſtyll: if ye ſpeke openly, I wyl not ſpeke in ſecret. Thou knoweſt wel Auilina, that made the ieſte, how Eumedes ſolde calues deter in the boucherie, than thou ſoldeſt the innocent vyrgins in thy houſe. Thou knoweſt wel Turinga, that one day thou recknedſt all thy louers, but thou coudeſt not recken them on thy fyngers, but deſyredſt to haue a buſhell full of peaſon. And thou Lucia Fuluia knoweſt welle, whan thou were, thou woteſt where, with Breto, and madeſt peace with thy huſbande, thou tokeſt hym a ſyde, and ſaydeſte, but if thou myghteſt lye out of thy houſe ones a weeke, he ſhuld not lye in the houſe. And thou Retoria knoweſt wel, that in thy yonge dayes, two yeres thou were appoynted on the ſee with a Pyrate, ſo that he ſhulde take no moo to ſatisfie a. C. men of warre in the galey. Thou Egna Corcia knoweſt well, that whan the cenſure entred to take the, he founde .v. mens gownes, in which thou wenteſt euer by nyght: &amp; thou haddeſt but one womans gowne, that thou

wareſt on by day. Thou knoweſt well Peſylane Fabrice, that Aluinus Metellus &amp; thou beinge maried, before the Cenſure demaunded openly his part, of that thou gateſt in thy houſe with thy ſecrete louers. And thou Camil knoweſt well, not beinge content with thyn owne nation, but by reaſon of the great hauntynge that thou haddeſt with ſtraungers, thou canſt ſpeake all maner of languages. I wyl marke them that haue marked me, &amp; hurte theym that haue hurte me, perſecute theym that haue perſecuted me, and infame them that haue infamed me: All other my pen doth pardon, bicauſe they haue perdoned me in their play. And bycauſe my letter hath begonne in that ye haue done to my perſon, therfore I wyl end it in that it feleth of your good names. And thus I conclude, that a man may ſcape free fro all domages, with abſteynynge fro them: But fro women there is no way, but to fle fro them. Thus I ende and demaunde of the goddis, that I may ſee of you, as ye deſyre to ſe of me. And ſythe ye be louers, I counſell you as ye haue ſent me your ieſte for a mocke, in lykewyſe for a mocke to receyue the anſwere. Marke Rodian to the amorous ladies of Rome.
            
            
               ¶A letter ſent by Marc the emperour to Boemia a louer of his, that wolde haue gone with him to the warres. The .xv. letter.
               
                  MArc pretour Romayn ſent to the warres of Dacy, ſēdeth ſalute to ye his louer Boemia, which art in ye pleaſures of Rome. I being ſcaped fro the cruel battel, haue red the few lines writen with thy hande, &amp; haue harde of the a long informatiō. I ſay to the, thou haſte put me in a more great abaſhement, than the feare of

myn enmies. In takynge thy letter into my hande, forthwith the herbe of malyce entred into my herte. Whan I tempre my body with thy delytes, I thinke my hart is fre fro the venym of thy amours. I of my wyll, and thou bicauſe thou canſte do no more, we haue giuen vs to be free of our pleaſures, I thinke as wel as to make a deuorſe of our enmies. But ſuche as ye be, ſo ye do, banyſhementes of amours, and treaſures of paſſions. The loue of you al ought to be digeſted with pylles: but the paſſion of one of you wyll not be oppreſſed with al the Rubarbe in Alexandrie. Ye ſhewe your ſelfe cruell to pardon an ennemy, and euery day light to chaūge louers. Curiouſly I haue kepte you al the whyle that delytes ouerpreſſed my youth: yet I coude neuer ſe in any woman no certayntie, nor reaſon in loue, but hate at the laſt. Thy preſent lightnes quarelleth with my youthe paſt: and it is bycauſe thou ſeeſt not in me the auncient will towarde the, nor the preſent ſeruice. And certaynly herynge thyn accuſation, and not my iuſtification, as iuſtly thou paieſt me with deth, as I paie the with forgetfulnes: The whiche forgettynge is as ſtraunge to be in him that ſerueth, as vngentilnes in the ladye that is ſerued. Thinkeſt thou, that I haue forgotten the lawe of Venus, where as it commandeth, that the curious louers ſhuld exerciſe their ſtrēgthes in armes, and occupie theyr hartes in loue? and alſo that their apparell be very clenely, their fete well compaſſed, their bodies ſtedfaſt and not waueryng, their voyces lowe and ſofte, and ſadde in coū
                  tenance: their eies open gaſynge at wyndowes, and their hartes redy to fle in the aire. Of trouth my loue Boemia, he is but a groſſe louer, that holdethe his wylle in captyuitie, and his vnderſtandynge free. The vnderſtandynge oughte to be loſte, where as wyll is in priſon. I ſaye this to thentent that thoughe myne age haue lefte the exercyſe,

yet my ſpirite hathe not forgotten the art. Thou complayneſt, bicauſe I gyue my ſelfe to reſt, &amp; that I haue greatly forgotten the. I wyll not deny the trouthe: the day of forgettynge maketh the muſter of my thoughtes, and reaſon whiche is prouiſour declareth, that it is not to my grauite to permyt, that I ſhuld loue, nor thy age to ſuffre to be beloued. As nowe thou knoweſt, that dyuers thynges, that youthe diſſimuleth in yonge perſons, in age meryteth greuous correction. The dedes done in youthe procedethe of ignorance: but the vilanies done in age procedeth of malyce. Whan I kepte the Cautons, I ietted in the ſtretes, I ſange balades, I gaſed to the wyndowes, I played on inſtrumentes, I ſcaled the walles, I wakened lyght perſons: thinkeſt thou, that I wyſt what I dyd in my youth? and nowe that I ſe my ſelfe promoted fro theſe pleaſures, and decked with ſoo many whyte heares, and apparayled with ſoo many dolours, I thynke nowe, I was not than, or elles I dreame as nowe, not knowynge the wayes that I haue gone, not ſeinge the wayes full of ſtones, I haue fallen ere I was ware, I haue fallen in ſnares: ſeking no guyde, I was entred into the whirlepoole: and by the groſſenes of my boldnes, I was loſt, and therfore I haue deſerued pardon. And nowe that I am out of the thornes and buſhes, thou woldeſt haue me farther in than euer I was. And now that I can not take the purgations, thou offereſte to me ſyropes. I haue watched all nyghte, and touched newly the alarme. For thy ancient amitie I pray the, and coniure the in the name of the goddis, ſythe that my harte is rebell againſte thy wyll, whiche is right doutfull: cauſe me to leaue to deſire the thus without doubte. And to thentent that thou ſhuldeſt not think any vnkindnes in my white heares, as I may argue thy face of ydelnes, I wyll that we recken what we haue wonne, or hope

to wynne. Shewe me what cometh of theſe pleaſures: the tyme yll ſpent, good name in ſcaterynge to pardicion, the patrimonie waſted, the credence loſte, the goddis annoyed, the vertues ſclaundred, the name of brute beaſtes got, and ſurnames of ſhame: ſuche ye and we and other be. Thou wryteſt in thy letter, howe thou wylte leaue Rome, and come &amp; ſe me in the warres of Dacy. Seinge thy foly I laugh, and knowledgynge thy boldneſſe, I beleue the. And whan I thynke thus, I take the letter agayne out of my boſom, &amp; beholde the ſeale, doubtynge if it be thy letter or not. Thou altereſt my pulces and felynges of my hart, &amp; the colour of my face chaūgeth, imageninge, that either ſhame ſurmounteth in the, or elles grauitie fayleth in me. For ſuche lyghtnes ſhuld not be beleued, but of lyke light perſones. Thou knoweſt well, he that dothe yll, meriteth peyn ſoner than he that doth infamy. I wold wytte: whither thou wylt go? Thou haſt ben cutte for vertinace, and nowe thou woldeſt be ſolde for wyne. Thou beganſt fyrſt as cheries, and thou wilte be laſte as quynces: we haue eten the in bloſomes, and thou wylt be lyke the fruite: the nuttes ar very good, but the ſhales be harde, with ſtrawe and donge thou arte made rype, and thou art rotten, and if thou be rottē, thou art to be lothed. Thou art not cōtent with .xl. yeres, that thou haſte, of the whiche .xxv. yeres art paſſed in taſt as wyne, that is to be ſold: and as ſtraweberies hyd vnder the leaues that are corrupte and rotten. Art not thou Boemia, that lacketh two tethe, the eies holowed, with white heares, &amp; a riueled face, one hande loſte with the gout, &amp; a rybbe marred with childe beryng? whyther wylt thou go? put thy ſelfe thā in a barel, &amp; caſte the &amp; it into the riuer, &amp; thou ſhalt come out al weate. We haue eaten the freſhe fyſhe, &amp; nowe thou woldeſt bring hyther ye ruſty old ſalt fiſhe in ſted therof. O Boemia Boemia, now

I knowe there is no truſt in youth, nor hope in age. Thou complayneſte, that thou haſte nothynge. That is an olde quarell of the amorous ladies of Rome, whiche takynge all, ſay they haue nothynge: and that ye lacke of credence, ye do fulfylle with money. Therfore beleue me louynge frēde, the folyſhe eſtate, that procedeth of vnlaufull wynnynge, gyueth ſmall ſuretie and leſſe good name to the perſone. I can not tell howe thou haſte ſpende ſo moche. For if I drewe of my rynges with one hande, thou dyddeſt open my purſe with the other hande. I had greatter warres with my coffres than, than I haue nowe with myn ennemies. I coude neuer haue iewell, but thou woldeſt demād it: nor I dyd neuer deny the. Nowe at this houre I meruayle, for in this myn age I fynde great hynderaunce by my youthe. Thou complayneſt of trauayle and pouertye. I am he that hath great nede of that medicine for this opilation, and a playſter for that ſoore, and to haue ſomme colde water for that hote feuer. Art thou not aduiſed, that I banyſhed my neceſſitie in the londe of forgetfulnes, and dyd ſet vp thy wyll for the requeſt of my ſeruice. In wynter I went all bare, and in ſommer charged with clothes, I went on fote in the myre, and rode in the faire way: whā I was heuy, I laughed: and whan I was mery, I wept. For dred I drewe forthe my ſtrengthes, and out of my ſtrengthes cowardiſe. The nightes to ſigh, and on the day to wayte where thou wenteſt by. Whan thou haddeſt nede of any thynge, I was fayne to robbe my father for it. Tel me Boemia, with whom fulfilledſt thou thyn open folies, but with the yll orders that I putte my ſelfe to in ſecrete? wot ye what me ſemeth by you amorous ladies of Rome? ye are in the court as the lytel mothes eating olde clothes, and a paſtime for lyght folkes, treſorers of fooles, &amp; ſepulchres of vices. This that ſemeth me is, that if in thy youth

euery mā gaue to the, bicauſe thou ſhuldeſt gyue yt to euery mā, now thou giueſt thy ſelf to euery mā, bycauſe euery mā ſhuld giue him to the. Thou telleſt me, that thou haſte ii. ſons, &amp; lackeſt helpe for them. Yeld graces to the goddis of the pitie that they haue vſed with the, they haue giuen to .xv. children of Fabricio my neyghbour but one father, &amp; to two of thy chyldren onely, they haue gyuen .l. fathers. Therfore deuyde them amonge theyr fathers, and euerye mā ſhall not haue one fynger. Lucia thy doughter in dede, and myn by ſuſpecte, remembre that I haue done more in marienge of her, thā thou didſt in her procreation. For to the gettyng of her, thou didſt call dyuers, &amp; to mary her I dyd it alone. I write to the but lyttel, to the reſpect of that I wold write. Butrio Cornelio hath ſpoken moche on thy parte, he hym ſelfe ſhall ſhewe the as moche of my parte. It is longe ago ſyth I knewe thyn impacience. I knowe well thou wylt ſende me an other letter more malicious. I pray the ſith I wrote to the ſecretely, defame me not opēly. And whan thou redeſt this letter, remēbre what occaſions thou giueſt me to write, &amp; though yt we be not frendes, yet wyl I not leue to ſend the ſyluer. I ſend the a gowne, &amp; the goddis be with ye, &amp; bring me out of this warre with peas. Marke pretour in Dacie to his auncient louer Boemia.
            
            
               ¶The anſwere to the emperours letter ſent by Boemia. The .xvi. letter.
               
                  BOemia thyn ancient louer, to the Marc of moūt Celio her mortal enmy. I deſire vē
                  geāce of thy perſon, &amp; yll fortune for al thy life. I haue receyued thy letter, &amp; therby ꝑceyue thy dānable intētes &amp; thy cruell malices. Suche yll perſons as thou art haue this priuilege, yt ſith one doth ſuffre your vilanies ī ſecret,

ye wyll hurte them openly, but thou ſhalt not doo ſo with me Marc: for though I be not treſoureſſe of thy treſours, yet at leaſte I am treaſoureſſe of thyn ylneſſe: and where as I can not reuenge me with my perſone, I ſhall labour to do it with my tongue. And thynke, that though we women be weake, and our bodies ſone ouercome, yet wyte it for certayne, that our hartes are neuer vanquyſhed. Thou ſayeſt, that ſcapyng from a battayle thou dyddeſt receyue my letter, wherof thou were ſoore abaſhed. It is a very common thyng to theym that be weke and ſlacke, to ſpeke of loue, wanton fooles to treate of bokes, and to cowardes to babble of armes: I ſay it, bycauſe the anſwerynge to a letter was not of neceſſitie to reherſe to a woman as I am, whether it were before the battayle or after. I know well, thou art ſcaped fro it, for thou were not the firſt that fought, nor the laſte that fled. Whan thou were yonge, I neuer ſawe the go to the warre, that euer I dredde or had ſuſpecte of thy lyfe: for knowyng thy cowardyſe, I neuer toke care for thyne abſence, for therin I was mooſte ſure of thy perſone. Than Marc tell me nowe, what thou doſt in thyn age. I thinke thou beareſt thy ſpeare not for to iuſt in the warre, but for to leane on whan the gowte greueth the. Thy helmette I deme thou beareſt with the to drynke within tauernes, and not to defende the fro the ſtrokes of ſwerdes: for I neuer ſawe the ſtryke man with thy ſwerd, but I haue knowen the ſlee a. M. women with thy tonge. O malicious and vnhappy Marc, if thou were as valyaunt as thou arte malycious, thou ſhuldeſt be as greatly dredde of the barbarycke nations, as thou arte hated, as reaſonne is, of the matrones of Rome. Tell me what thy lyſte: at the leaſt thou canſte not denye, but as thou haſte ben a weake and ſlacke louer, ſoo thou arte nowe a weake and ſlacke cowarde knyght, an vnknowen frende, auaricious,

infamed, malicious, cruell, ennemy to euery man, and frend to no body. And we that haue knowen the, yōge ſtronge and luſty, condempne the for an olde foole. Thou ſayeſt, that takynge my letter into thy handes, thy harte toke the poyſon of malyce. I beleue it wel without ſwearynge, for any thyng beinge malicious forthwith fyndeth lodging in thy houſe. Beaſtes, that be corrupt, lightly take the poyſon, that they that ben of good complexion caſte away. Of one thyng I am in certayn, thou ſhalt not die of poyſon. For one venyme oftentymes dyſtroyeth an other venym. O malycious Marc, yf all they in Rome knewe the, as well as ſorowfull Boemya dooth, they ſhuld ſoone ſe, what difference were betwene the wordes that thou ſpekeſt, and the intention of thy hart. And if by the writinges that thou makeſt, thou meriteſt to haue the name of a philoſopher, by the ylnes that thou doeſt inuente, thou doſte merite to haue the name of a tyraunt. Thou ſayeſt, thou ſaweſt neuer certitude in the loue of a woman, nor ende of her hate. I haue great glorie, that other ladyes beſyde me haue knowlege of thy ſmall wyſedome. A ſe Marc, I wyll not mocke the, thou arte ſuche one, as neuer deſerued that one ſhoulde begynne to loue the, nor leaue to hate the. Wylte thou haue certitude in loue, and thou vnfaythfull of thy ſeruyce? Wylt thou ſerue with mockeries, and woldeſt be loued truely? Wylte thou enioye the perſonne without ſpendynge of any of thy goodes? Wylt thou haue no complayntes of the, and thou not ceaſſynge thy malyces? Thou ſayeſt, thou knoweſt the ylnes of women. I wil thou know, we be not ſo folyſhe, as thou thinkeſt, nor thou ſo wyſe, as thou weneſte, to prayſe thy ſelfe▪ yet hytherto hath ben ſene mo men, to folowe the appetyte of women, than there hath ben women folowynge the wylle of men. 
                     〈◊〉
                   none of bothe is great truſte, and yet we both practyſe

that one man hath his harte ſo myghty, to be more wyſer than thre wyſe women, and one woman thynketh her ſoo ſtrong, to put vnder her feete, and ouercome .iii.C. ſuche as be lyght. Thou ſayeſt, thou arte abaſhed of my lyghtnes, to leaue Rome, and come to the being in the warres. Great is the loue of the countrey, ſith that many leaue dyuers welthes that they haue in ſtraunge landes, and lyue ſtraitly, for to lyue in their owne lande: but greatter is my loue, ſyth that I wolde leaue Rome with al the pleaſures, to go and ſerche for the in ſtrange landes among the cruel battayles. O malicious Marke, O ſtraunge louer, yf I leaue Rome, it were to go and ſeke my harte beynge in the battayles with the. And certaynly dyuers tymes whanne I doo thynke on thyne abſence, I ſwowne and ſorowe as my hart were not with me, and yet I fynde no perfyte remedy. I thynke our loue is not lyke theſe beaſtes, that ioy of their pleaſures, without to wyll, and deſyre theyr wylles. I ſweare to the by the goddeſſe Veſta, and by the mother Berecinthia, that thou oweſt me more for one day of loue, that I haue had to the, than for the ſeruyces that I haue done to the in .xxii. yeres. Beholde vnhappy Marc, howe moche in thy preſence I haue always regarded the, and in thyn abſence I haue alwayes thoughte on the, and ſlepynge I haue alwayes dreamed of the, I haue wepte for thy trauayle, and laughed at thy pleaſure, and finally all my welthe I haue wyſhed the, and al thyn ylles I haue wyſhed me. I enſure the one thynge, that as nowe I fele not ſoo moche the perſecution that thou doeſt to me, as I do the mysknowlege that thou makeſt to me. It is a great ſorowe for an auaricious man to ſee his goodes loſte, but without comparyſon it is farre greatter for the louer to ſe his loue yll beſtowed. It is a hurt that is alway ſoore, &amp; a peyn alway peynful, a ſorow alway ſorowful, &amp; it is a deth

that neuer endeth. O ye men, if ye knewe with what loue women loueth you in perfytenes whan they loue, &amp; with what harte they hate whan they are ſet to hate: I ſwere to you, ye wold neuer cōpany with thē in loue: or if ye do loue them, ye wold neuer leue thē for feare of their hate: &amp; there is neuer gret hate, but where as moch loue was fyrſt. But thou ſhalt neuer be gretly hatid, for thou were neuer truly loued of ladies. The ſorowfull Boemia hath loued ye .xxii. yere of her lyfe, &amp; now ſhe only hateth ye tyl after her deth. Thou ſayeſt, I may be eaten for veriuyce, and yet I wold be ſolde for wyne. I knowe wel I haue erred, as one that hath ben yonge and lyght, and whan I perceyued that I had loſte my way, and that my myſaduenture can fynd no way nor remedy: It is the greateſt loſſe of al loſſes, whan there is no remedy. I haue erred lyke a feble and a weake woman, but thou haſt erred as a ſtronge man: I haue erred by ſimple ignorance, but thou haſte erred of a prepenſed and wilfull malice: I haue erred, not knowinge that I ſhulde haue erred, but thou kneweſt what thou diddeſt: I haue truſted to thy wordes, as to a faythfull gentylle man, and thou haſte begyled me with a thouſande leſynges as a lier. Telle me, diddeſt thou not ſeke occaſion to comme into my mothers houſe Getulia, to allure me her doughter Boemia to thy minde? Dyddeſte thou not promiſe my father to teache me to rede in one yere? and thou taughtehe me to rede the boke of Duidius, of the arte of loue? Diddeſt thou not ſweare to be my huſbaunde, and than withdreweſt thy hande as a falſe aduoultrer? Doeſt thou not knowe, that thou neuer foundeſt villanie in my perſonne, nor I neuer founde trouthe in thy mouthe? At leaſt thou canſt not denie, but thou haſt offended the goddis, and arte infamed of men, &amp; odious to the Romaynes, ſclaundred of good folkes, and example to the yll folkes,

and fynally a traytour to my father and mother, a breker of thy faythe, and to me ſorowefull Boemia an vnkynde louer. O malycious Marc, haſt thou not cutte me in leaues, offrynge to my father to kepe his vines ſurely? Ill may the chekyn truſte the kyte, or the lambes the wolues: &amp; worſe the to bring vp the doughters of thē that be good. O curſed Marke, a domageable keper of vines hathe the matrones of Rome founde the, in kepynge their doughters: I ſwere, that there was neyther grape nor cluſter, but it was eaten or cut by the. Thou dydſt eate me beinge grene. I promyſe the it hathe ſette thy tethe on an yl edge. Thou ſayeſte, I ryped by power of heate and ſtrawe. It diſpleaſeth me not ſo moche, that thou ſayeſt, as thou gyueſt me occaſion to ſay to the. Thy ſhame is ſo ſhamefull, and thy malyce ſo vnſhamefaſte, that I can not aunſwere the to the pourpoſe, withoute hurtynge or touchynge the quycke. I wolde wytte of the, whan thou maryedſte Fauſtyn, whether thou foundeſt her grene or rype? Thou knoweſt well, and lyke wyſe ſo do I, that other beſide the, gauged the veſſel, and thou drankeſt the lies: other gathered the grapes, and thou gleynedſt the vine: other dyd eate the grapes, and thou haddeſt the huſkes. O wycked Marc, beholde thyne euylles, and howe the goddis haue gyuen the iuſte chaſtyſemēt, that thou being yong meritedſt not to be deſyred of thy louers, nor that thy wyues kepe feithe to the in thyne age. For to be aduenged of thy perſonne, I nede none other thinge, but to ſe the maried to Fauſtyne. By the mother Berecynthia I promyſe the, yt if thy ſmall wyſedome myght atteyne to knowe entierly, what is ſaid of her and the in Rome, ſurely thou woldeſt wepe nyghte and day for the lyfe of Fauſtyn, and not leue the thoughtfull Boemia. O Marc, lyttell thoughte is taken for the, &amp; how fer is our vnderſtādyng vncoupled fro thy thoughtes:

bycauſe that with thy great doctrine by day tyme thy houſe is made a ſchole of philoſophers, and the wantonneſſe of thy wyfe Fauſtyne by nyghte, maketh it a bordell of ruffiens. It is a iuſte iugement of the goddis, that ſith thyn onely malyce ſuffiſeth to poyſon many that be good, that one alone may ſuffiſe to vnbend and loſe thy renome. One difference there is betwene the and me, and thy wyfe Fauſtine: for my dedes are but in ſuſpecte, and yours are openly knowen in dede: myn are ſecrete, and yours are euident: I haue ſtōbled, but ye haue fallen. Of one thyng alone I haue merited to be chaſtiſed, but ye haue deſerued no forgyuenes: My diſhonour is deed with the faut, and is buried with myn amendmēt, but your infamie is borne with your deſyres, and is broughte vp with your wylles, and lyueth ſtyll with your werkes: finally therfore youre infamie ſhall neuer dye, for you lyued neuer well. O malicious Marcus, with all that thou knoweſt, woteſt thou not, that forloſynge of a good name, an yll fame is recouered: and in the ende of a good lyfe, begynnethe a good faame? Thou ceaſſeſt not to ſaye ylle onely by ſuſpicion, the whiche thy falſe iugementes ſhewe the: and yet thou woldeſt we ſhulde not ſpeake that we ſe with our eies. Of one thynge be thou ſure, that neyther of the, nor of thy wyfe Fauſtyne there is no falſe wytneſſe: for the trouth is ſo euident, that there nedeth not to inuent any lyes. Thou ſaiſt, that it is an olde quarel of amorous ladies of Rome, that in takinge fro many we are the pooreſte of all other: bicauſe we faile in credence, we are honoured for ſyluer. It is of certayntie, that we myſtruſte the hollie bicauſe of his prickes, the acornes, for his huſkes, the roſes among nettyls, and thy mouth for thy malyce. I haue curiouſlye taken hede, that thou neuer ſaydeſt well by women, nor I neuer coud fynde, that any wolde the good. What greatter

correction ſhuld I haue of thy wickednes, or more vengeance for myn iniuries, but to be certayne, that all the louynge ladies of Rome are ſorye of thy lyfe, and wolde be gladde of thy dethe? The lyfe of that man is wycked, that many bewayle, and in whoſe dethe euery body reioyſeth. It is the propertie of poore vnkynde perſons as thou art, to forgette the great goodneſſe done to them, and to be ſory for the lyttell that they gyue. As moche as noble hartis glorifie them in gyuinge to other, ſo moche are they aſhamed to receyue ſeruices vnrewarded. For in giuinge they make them ſelfe lordes, and in receyuyng they are as ſclaues. I wolde wytte what thou haſte gyuen me, or what thou haſte receyued of me? I haue aduentured my good name, and gyuen the, poſſeſſion of my perſonne: I haue made the lorde and mayſter of all my goodes: I haue banyſhed my ſelfe out of my countrey, and putte my ſelfe in peryll only for thy ſake: and in recompence of al this, thou reprocheſt me now of miſerie. Thou neuer gaueſt me any thing with thy good wyl, nor I neuer receyued it willingly, nor it dyd me neuer profyt. Il thinges recouer a name, not for the common warke that we ſee, but for the ſecrete intention with the whiche we worke. And thou vnhappy man deſiredſt me, not to enioy my perſonne, but rather to haue my money. We ought not to cal the a clere louer, but a thefe, &amp; a wyly ſee rouer. I had a litel ringe of the, whiche I am determyned to caſte into the ryuer, and the clothynge that I had of the I haue brente in the fire. And yf that my body were any thing amēded with the breade that I haue eaten of thyn, I wolde cutte my fleſhe, and let out the blode without any feare. O curſed Marke, thy darke malyce wolde not ſuffre the clerely to vnderſtande my letter: for I entended not to aſke moneye, to releue my pouertie and ſolytaryneſſe, but reknowlegynge and thynkynge

to ſatisfie my wyllyng harte. Suche vayne and couetous menne as thou arte thy ſelfe, are pleaſed with gyftes, but the hartis incarnate in loue are lyttell ſatisfyed with ſyluer. For loue onely is payde with loue agayne. The manne that loueth not as a manne of reaſone, but as a brute beaſte, and the woman that loueth not but for the intereſt of her perſon: ſuche ought not to be truſted in theyr wordes, nor their perſones deſyred. For the loue of her endeth, whan the goodes fayle: and the loue of hym, whan her beautie fayleth. If thy loue proceded onelye of the beautie of my face, and my loue only for the money of thy pours: it were no ryghte, that we were callyd wyſe louers, but rather very nyce perſons. O wycked Marke, I neuer loued the for thy goodes, though thou louedſt me for my beautie: with all my harte I loued the than, &amp; with all my harte I hate the now. Thou ſayſt, the goddis haue ſhewed me great pitie, to gyue me fewe chylderne, and to them many fathers. The greatteſt blame in women is to be vnſhamefaſt, and the moſte vylanie in men is to be yll ſayers. Diuers thinges ought to be ſuffred for the fragilitie of women, whiche are not permitted in the wiſedom of men. I ſay this bicauſe I neuer ſawe temperaunce in the for to couer thyne owne malyces, nor wyſedome to excuſe the debilities of other. Thou ſayeſt, that my ſonnes haue dyuers fathers. I ſweare vnto the, that though thou dye, the chylderne of Fauſtine ſhall not be fatherleſſe. And of trouthe if the goddis, as thou ſayeſt, haue be pitiefull to my chyldern, no leſſe art thou to ſtrange children. For Fauſtyne kepeth the but to excuſe her blame, and to be tutour of her children. O curſed Marc, thou mayſt well reioyce &amp; take no thoughte, for thyn owne chyldren haue noo nede to be maried. For oone thynge we are bounde, that is for the example, the whiche thou doſte gyue of thy pacyence:

For ſithe thou ſuffreſt Fauſtine in ſo many infamies, it is no great nede that we ſuffre any ſecretes in the. I ſaye no more at this tyme, makynge an ende of my letter, deſyring the ende of thy perſon.
            
            
               ¶A letter ſent by Marcus the emperour to Matrine a yonge mayden of Rome, of whom he was enamoured, ſeinge her at a wyndowe. ¶ The .xvii. letter.
               
                  MArke themperour, the very deſyrous, to the Matrine greatly deſyred. I wote not if by good aduenture of myn yll aduenture, or by yll aduenture of my good aduenture, I dyd ſee the of late at a wyndow, where as thou heldeſt thyn armes as cloſe as myn eien were ſpred abrode, that curſed be they for euer. For in beholdyng thy face, my harte forthewith abode with the as pryſoner. The begynnynge of thy knowlege is the ende of my reaſon, and felynge of flyght. Of one trauayle cometh infinite trauayles to mē. I ſay it for this, if I had not ben ydel, I had not gone out of my howſe, and yf I hadde not gone out of my howſe, I had not gone oute into the ſtretes, and yf I had not paſſyd through the ſtrete, I hadde not ſene the at thy wyndowe, and if I hadde not ſene the at thy wyndowe, I had not deſyred thy perſone: and not deſyring thy perſon, I had not put thy name in ſo great perylle, nor my lyfe in trauaile, nor had gyuen none occaſion in al Rome to ſpeke of vs. Of a trouth lady Matrine in this caſe I condemne my ſelfe, ſyth I wold beholde the. And thou woldeſt be ſaluted, ſyth thou deſyredſt to be ſene. And ſyth thou were ſet as a whyte marke, it was no greate meruaylle that I that 

with the arowes of myne eyes at the buttes of thy beauty, with rollynge eies, with browes bent, well coloured face, incarnate tethe, ruddy lyppes, cryſpe heares, handes ſette with rynges, clothed with a. M. maner of clothynges, bearyng purſes full of ſwete ſmelles, and bracelettes full of knackes, with perles and ſtones at the eares. Tell me what becometh of a woman, with theſe thynges, that wyl ſhewe her ſelfe at a wyndowe? The mooſte cauſe is, that I can eſteme or thynke therin, that ſith you do ſhew your bodies openly to vs at the eie, that your wylle is, that we ſhulde knowe your deſires ſecretely. And if it be ſoo, as I afferme, that it is ſo, it ſemeth me madame Matrine, thou ſhuldeſt deſire hym that deſyreth the, to enforme hym that ſercheth the, to anſwere hym that calleth the, &amp; fele that he feleth: intende to hym that intendeth to the: and ſythe I vnderſtande the, vnderſtande me, and vnderſtande ſythe thou doeſt not vnderſtande. I am aduyſed, as I went by the ſtrete Falaria to ſe theues putte to Iuſtice, myne eyen ſawe the at a wyndowe, on whome dependeth all my deſires. Thou doeſt more Iuſtyce to me, then I to the theues: for I beinge at Iuſtice, thou haſte iuſticied the Iuſtice, &amp; none dare peyne the. The gybet is not ſo cruell to them that neuer knew but il doing, as thou art to me that neuer thought, but howe I myghte doo the ſeruyce. The theues ſuffre but one death, and thou makeſt me to ſuffre a. M. in a day: In one houre the theues liues are ended, and I dye euery mynute: I drawe towarde deth wrongfully, and they ſuffre for theyr fautes: I ſuffre an innocēt, they openly, and I in ſecrete. What ſhall I ſaye more to the? of trouthe they wepte watry droppes with their eyes, bycauſe they dye, and I wepe teares of bloud in my harte, bycauſe I lyue. This is the difference, theyr tourmentes ſpredeth abrode through all theyr bodies, and I kepe myn

together in my hart. O cruell Matrine, I canne not telle what iuſtyce it is to put men to dethe that ſteale money, &amp; ſuffre women to lyue that robbe mennes hartes: If theyr eares be cut of, that picke mens pourſes, why are women than pardoned, that robbe mens inwarde hartes and entrayles? By thy noblenes I pray the, and by the goddeſſe Venus I coniure the, eyther anſwere to my deſyre, or elles reſtore my harte agayne, whiche thou haſt robbed fro me. I wolde thou kneweſt the clere fayth of my harte, rather than this letter writen with my hande. If myn aduenture were ſo good, as to ſpeke with the, and that thy loue were not aſhamed therof, I wolde hope with the ſight &amp; ſpeche to wynne that whiche I am in ſuſpect to leſe by my letter. The reaſon is, bycauſe thou hereſt my ylle and rude reaſons redynge my letter. And if thou ſaweſt me, thou ſhuldeſt ſee the cruelle teares that I offre to the by my lyfe. I wolde my mouth coulde publyſſhe myn enraged euylles, as my harte feleth, than I ſwere to the lady Matrine, that my greuous dolour ſhulde awake thy ſmall thought. And as thy beautie &amp; myn affection haue made me thyn owne, ſo the knowlege of my paſſion ſhuld make the mine. I deſyre that thou ſhuldeſt regarde the begynnynge, and therwith regarde the ende. Certaynly the ſame day that thou enpriſonedſt my harte at thy wyndowe, in the doungeon of my deſyres, I had no leſſe weakeneſſe to be ouercome, thanne thou haddeſte force to conſtrayne me. And more greatter is thy power to putte thy ſelfe from me, than my reaſon is to put me fro the. I aſke no mercye of the, but that we myghte declare oure wylles togyther. But in this caſe what wylte thou that I ſhulde ſay, but that thou haſt ſo moch power ouer me, and I ſo lytel of my lybertie, that wyll I nyll I, my hart can not be but thyne? And hit beinge thyne, thou mayſte, and wylte not declare thy ſelfe

to be myn. And ſyth it may not be, but that my life muſt be condemned in thy ſeruice, be thou as ſure of my fayth as I am doubtefull of thy hope: For I ſhall haue a greatter welthe to be loſte for thy ſake, thanne to wynne any other thynge. I wyll ſay no more atte this tyme, but that thou accompte my perdicion and deathe, and drawe the lyfe of my teares into open ioye. And bycauſe that I holde my faith in thy fayth, and wyll neuer deſpayre in thy hope, I ſende to the .x. lyttell rynges of golde, with .x. ſtones of Alexandry: And I coniure the▪ by the immortal goddis, that whan thou doeſt put theym on thy fyngers, thou ſette me in thyn harte and entrayles. Marcus amorous wrote this with his owne hande.
            
            
               ¶An other letter ſente by Marc the emperour to the ſayde gentyll woman Matrine. The .XVIII. letter.
               
                  MArke habitant at Rome, to the Matrine his right ſwete ennemy. I cal the ſwete, for it is iuſte that I dye for the. And I cal the enemy, bycauſe thou makeſt not an ende to ſle me. I can not tel wherin it is, but ſyth the feaſt of Iano hitherto, I haue writen thre letters to the. And to ye anſwere of them, I wold that I had ſene two letters from the, if it were thy pleaſure. If that I ſerue the, thou woldeſt that I ſhulde not ſerue: if I ſpeke, thou wilt not ſpeke to me, if I loke at the, thou wylt not beholde me: if I call the, thou wilt not anſwere: if I viſite the, thou wilt not ſe me, if I write to the, thou wylt giue me none anſwere, and worſt of all, if other do ſhewe the of my dolours, thou makeſt but a mocke therof. And if I had as moch knowlege,

where to complayne to the, as thou haſt power to remedy the plaintyfe, my wiſedome ſhoulde no leſſe be prayſed amonge wiſe men, than thy beautie is amonge fooles. I pray the hartely regarde not the contrarieties of my reaſons, but regarde the faythe of my wepynges, the whiche in wytneſſe of my peynes I do gyue vnto the. I wote not what good may come to the of my harmes: nor what winnynge of my loſſe thou ſhuldeſt hope to gette: nor what ſuretie of my peryl thou ſhuldeſt attayne vnto: nor what pleaſure of my diſpleaſure thou mayſt haue. I haue had aunſwere of my meſſanger, that without redynge of my letters, thou haſt with thy handes toren theym all to pieces. It ought to ſuffiſe the to thynke, that my perſon were hewen in quarters, yet I wolde thou haddeſt redde theſe ſmall lynes lady Matrine: for by them thou ſhuldeſt haue ſene, howe my thoughtes were troubled. Ye women are ſo extreme, that for ye faut of one man, a womā wyl complain of all other men in generall, ſo that ye be cruel for one particular cauſe. Openly ye pardone all mens lyues, and in ſecrete ye procure euery mans dethe. I eſteme it nothynge dame Matrine that thou haſte done: but I lament me of that thou demaundedſt Valirius thy neyghbour to ſaye to me. One thynge I wolde thou haddeſt in memorie and not forgot, and that is, ſith that my lybertie is ſo ſmalle, and thy power ſo great, bycauſe I beinge all holly myne owne, I am tourned to be thyn, that thou ſhuldeſt thinke, that whan thou woldeſt iniurie me, thou ſhuldeſt do moſt iniurie to thy ſelfe, ſythe that by the I dye, as thou by me doeſt lyue. In this yll purpoſe perſeuer not, for thou doeſt aduenture the lyfe of vs bothe. Thou damneſt thy condytion, and diſtroyeſt my helth, and finally thou muſt come to the medicine. Forgyue me dame Matrine, if I ſay any malyce to the, that is, I knowe that ye women deſire one

thynge, and kepe vs in drede, that it ſhoulde not come by her thought. Thou were wont to be well conditioned, and at leaſte though thou doeſt not put it in vre, yet thou haſt the fame therof: and an auncient fame ought not be lefte for a newe vnkyndnes. Thou knoweſt well, what contraryneſſe dothe vngentylneſſe to the vertues in vertuous houſes, and thou canſt nat be called vertuous, but if thou be gentyl and courteyſe. There is no greatter vnkyndnes than to loue her that loueth not me: That I viſite the, and thou vyſiteſt not me, that I ſpeake to the, and thou ſpeakeſt not to me is nothyng, that I knowlege ye, &amp; thou wilte not know me is nothyng, though I wepe and thou laugh is nothynge, thoughe I demaunde, and thou denyeſte is nothynge: thoughe thou owe me, and neuer paye, yet it is nothynge, but where as I loue the, and thou not me, is a great thyng. That thyng that can not be diſſimuled with the eies, nor the harte ſuffre, al the vyces amonge mortall creatures, it is reaſon that they be forgyuen, bycauſe they are commytted by nature, ſaue onely the vnlouyng of women, and the vnkyndneſſe of men, whiche are vyces commytted of malyce. After dyuers ſeruyces by me doone to the, and moche moore that I haue to doo hereafter, thou Matrine mayſte all onely pay me with one thyng, I pray the refuſe not to gyue me remedy, ſyth I haue not offered me in the peryll. If thou ſaye, that Patroclus thy ſpouſe hath the propretie ouer the, yet at leaſte receyue me to the profe, and I ſhall pretende poſſeſſyon of the. And in this wiſe in the vayneglorie to be thyn, ſhal couer the domage not to be myn. Thou makeſt me to meruaile ſore, howe for ſo ſmall a mercy and rewarde thou canſte ſuffre ſuche importunitie ſo longe. For certayn many thinges we graunt to an importunate manne, the whyche are not graunted to a temperate man. If thou hopeſt to ouercome me Matryne,

I holde my ſelfe vanquyſſhed: if thou wylte loſe me, I holde me for loſte: if thou wylt ſle me, I yeld my ſelf as deade. For by the geſture that I make afore thy gate, and the ſyghes that I make in myn owne houſe, are gretly myne to reſyſte, and the greuous aſſaut of the, be edifices more to ſommon dethe, thanne to defende the life: If thou wilte that I ſcape this daunger, deny me not the remedy, bycauſe it ſhalbe a greatter vice in the to ſle me, thā vilany to gyue me remedy. And it were no iuſte thinge for ſo ſmall a pryce to loſe the fayth of ſo gret ſeruyce. I wote not what to do, to make the my debtour, and thou to pay me. And yet worſt of all, I wote not what to do, nor what to thinke nor to ſay, nor to whom to determine me, bicauſe I can not aſſure any profyte in me, but to be certayne in thy ſeruices. And bicauſe thou doſte truſte hym that hath done this meſſage, by hym I do ſend this open letter, and my ſecrete aunſwere. I do ſend the a iewell of perles, and a beſant of gold. To the goddis I do commende the. And I require the for to receyue it with as good a wyl as I do preſente it vnto the. Marc the oratour to the righte honorable Matrine.
            
            
               ¶A letter ſent by Marc the emperour to Lybia a fayre lady Romayne. ¶The .xix. letter.
               
                  MArke full of ſorowe and penſyfenes, to the Lybia takynge but lyttell thought or care: if thy ſmall thought paſſed any thynge on me, and alſo if my troubles and dolours were lodged and dydde reſte in 
                     〈◊〉
                   thanne thou ſhuldeſt perceyue and ſe howe ſmalle the quarell were, the whiche I make to the, in reſpecte of

the tourment that I doo ſuffre, if the blaſinge flames iſſued out, as the fyred brondes do brenne me within, the ſmoke wolde reache to the heuens, and make ymbres of the erthe: yf thou doeſt well remembre the fyrſt tyme that I ſawe the in the temple of the virgins veſtales, thou beynge there praydſte the goddis for thy ſelfe, and I on my knees prayed the for my ſelfe. I knowe well thou offredſt hony and oyle to the goddis, and I offred to the ſoore wepynges and ſyghes. It is a iuſte thynge to gyue more to hym that offreth his inwarde entrayles, than to hym that draweth money out of his purſe to offre. I haue determined, and diſpoſed me, to write to the this letter, that thou ſhuldeſt ſe howe thou art ſerued with the arowes of myne eies, that were ſhotte at the whyte of thy ſeruices. Alas, howe ſorowful am I to thynke, leaſt the calme tyme now, doth threten me with the tempeſt to come. I wyl ſay, that diſloue in the, cauſeth the hope doubtfull in me. Beholde what myſaduēture I had loſt a letter, and I as I retourned to the temple to ſeke for it, I hadde nere loſt my ſelfe, in going thyther ſo often, cōſydering my ſmal merite. I ſe well, that mine eies the ladders of my hope, are ſet on ſoo hie a walle, that no leſſe is the doubte of my fall, than the daunger of the clymmynge vppe. Thou bowinge downe the leaues of thy high merites, haſte broughte me to the poynte of continuall ſeruice. Lette me haue the fruite, and giue the leaues to whome thou wylte. By the immortalle goddis, I haue great meruayle, for ſurely I thought that in the temple of the virgins Veſtales, no manne ſhoulde haue had temptations. But as nowe I doo fynde by experience, that that woman is more lyberall, and ſooner ouercome, that is faſte and ſtraytly kept and watched, than other. Al the corporal domages are firſt hard of, er they be knowen, and knowen er they be ſene, and ſene er they be

felte, and felte er they be taſted, yet it is not ſo in loue. For fyrſt they fele the ſtroke therof, er they ſee the way howe it cometh. The lyghtnynge is not ſo ſodeyne, but it is ſene afore the thonder clappe, nor the wall fallith not ſo ſodeinly, but fyrſte ſome ſtones breake aſonder, nor the colde cometh not ſo faſte on, but ſome ſmalle ſheuerynges cometh before: but all onely loue is not felte tyll it be ſetled in the entrayles. Let euery man knowe it that know it not, and thou lady Libie if thou wylt, knowe: Loue ſlepeth whan we wake, and waketh whan we ſlepe, and laugheth whan we wepe, and wepeth whan we laugh: it aſſurethe in takynge, and taketh in aſſuryng: And ſpeketh whan we be ſtyll, and is ſtyll whan we ſpeke: And fynally it is of that condicion, that for to gyue vs that we deſyre, it cauſeth vs to lyue in peyne. I ſweare to the, whan my wyll becamme thy ſeruaunte, and thy beautie cauſed, that thou were my lady, whan I was in the temple and returned ageyn thyther, not deſyrynge the, thou beheldeſte me, and I as vnhappy loked on the. But O what a thoughte came to me, that my harte beinge hole, thou haſte dyuyded, beinge in helthe thou haſte hurte, being alyue thou haſte ſlayne, beinge myn thou haſte ſtollen it, and that worſt of all is, not helpynge to my lyfe, thou conſenteſt that loue aſſaylle me to the dethe. Many tymes lady Libia conſyderynge that al my thoughtes ben high, and my fortune lowe, I wolde haue ſeperate my felfe fro the. But conſyderynge that my trauayles are well applyed in thy ſeruyces, I ſay thoughe I myght, I wyll nat be ſeperate fro the. I wyll not denye one thynge, and that is, that curſed loue taketh away the taſte of al thynges, and yet therby alonly it gyueth vs appetite, the whiche gyueth vs moche yll proufyte. This is the profe of hym that loueth hartily. For one diſfauour of hym that is beloued, is more than all the fauour of this

lyfe. I thinke lady Libia thou art gretly abaſhed to ſe me outwarde as a philoſopher, and to knowe me inwarde a ſecrete louer. I praye the Lybia diſcouer me not: For yf that the goddis gyue me longe lyfe, I am mynded for to amende. And thoughe I be at this howre but a yonge foole in the arte of loue, whan I am olde I ſhall be wyſe: the goddis knowe what I deſyre, and the force that I do enforce me to: but as the fleſhe is weake, and the hart tender, and hath many occaſions and fewe vertues, and the worlde ſubtyll, and the people malitious, I paſſe this beginninge and ſpring of floures with hope that in harueſt I ſhall haue ſome fruite. Dame Libia doeſt thou thinke, that philoſophers thought they were neuer ſo ſage, be not ſtryken with the cruelties of loue? and that vnder their cours clothes their fleſhe is not ſmoth? Certaynly among the harde bones ſofte fleſhe is bred, vnder the ſharpe huſkes the cheſtnutte is nouryſſhed. I ſaye that vnder courſe apparel, is true and perfyte loue. I deny not but that our ſlacke nature reſyſteth not with vertues: nor I denye not, but there be yonge wāton deſyres not repreſſed with vertuous purpoſes: I deny not, but that the bytte of youth is not refreyned with the brydell of reaſon: I denye not, but that that the fleſhe procureth, is dyuers tymes withſtande by wyſedome. And alſo I knowlege well, that he that is not amorous, is a foole. And thou knoweſte, that thoughe we be wyſe, we leaue not therfore to be men. All that euer we lerne in all our lyues ſuffiſeth not to knowe howe to rule the fleſhe one houre. To wyſe menne in this caſe hathe fallen many errours: there be many mayſters in vertues, and many moo hath bene, and yet they haue ben ouercome with vices: wherfore than doeſt thou meruayle of me alone? I confeſſe of trouthe, that I had neuer myne vnderſtandyng ſo clere, as whan Cupyde fanned

wind on me with his winges. There was neuer none vnto my tyme, that euer was noted wyſe, but fyrſt he was a priſoner &amp; bound with the loue of Cupide. Gratian was amorous on Tamyr: Solon Salaminus giuer of the lawes, was amorous of Grecyane: Pytacus Mitelenus lefte his owne wyfe, and was enamoured of a bond womā that he brought from the warres: Cleobulus of Caria whan he was ful .lxx. yere olde, and haddered philoſophy xlv. yere, ſcalynge the houſe of his neyghbour, felle of the ladder and dyed. Periander prince of Acaye, and a great philoſopher of Grece, at ye preier of one of his louers ſlewe his wyfe. Anacharſis a philoſopher a Scithian of his father ſyde, and a greke of his mother ſyde, was ſo enamored of a woman of Thebes, that he taught her al his coū
                  nynge: and whan he was ſycke in his bedde, ſhe redde in the ſchole for hym. Epimenides of Crete, that ſlepte .xv. yeres without waking, and though he was .x. yere a great worſhypper of the goddis, yet he was banyſſhed frome Athenes for the loue of women. Archyta Tarentyn, mayſter of Plato, and diſciple of Pythagoras, occupied his mynde more to inuente the kindes of loue, than his forces in doctrines of vertues. Gorgio Cleontino, borne in Sycyll, kepte rather concubines in his chambre, than bokes in the ſcholes. All theſe were wyſe men, and yet we maye ſe, howe at the laſte they were ouercome with the fleſſhe. Than blame not me alone: for as I haue tolde of ſo fewe in noumbre, ſo I coude recyte of other a holle armye. Of trouth he ought to haue many thynges, that wylle be taken as curious in loue. He muſte haue his eien diſplayed on her that he loueth, his vnderſtandynge fore altered in that he thinketh, his tonge troubled in that he ſhulde ſay: So that in ſeinge he be blynded, in thoughtes wandring, and in ſpeakynge troubled. O lady Libia, the louynge in

mockerie paſſeth by mockerie: but where as the true hart is, there is the grefe and no mockerie. Loue ſhedeth her poyſone, and cruell Cupydo fyxeth his arowes vppe to the fethers. Than the eien wepe, the harte ſyghethe, the fleſſhe trymbleth, the ſynewes ſhrynke, the vnderſtandynge waxeth groſſe, reaſon fayleth, and ſo all falleth to the erthe, ſo that fynally the heuy louer abydynge in hym ſelfe, holdeth lyttell or nothynge of hym ſelfe. All this I ſay, bicauſe that knowlege to loue fayleth in me: yet be ye ſure, that the workes faile me not to worke in thy ſeruice. And ſyth it was myn aduenture to ſee the, nowe it is my chaunce to knowe the, I demaunde nothyng elles of the, but that thou wylte loue me truely, ſyth I loue the withoute feynynge. And if thou haſte harde, that I am ſycke at my harte, I deſyre the to do me ſome good: for ſythe it is all onely in the, it is reaſon that thou all onely ſeke for remedy. I was greatly comforted, whan Fabius Carlynus deſyred me in thy behalfe to be a priſoner, and I dyd incontinent all that thou dyddeſt deſyre, to thentente that thou on ſome day ſhuldeſt do that I deſyre. And beholde lady Lybia, the woman that is ſerued with ſeruyces, it is reaſonne that ſhe receyue ſome prayers. And though my ſtrengthes haue no power to open the gates of thy pourpoſe, as not to agree to thy demaunde, yet all my labours be bycauſe of thy renoume. I praye the diſcouer not the one, nor begyle me nat with the other. For now thou ſeeſt that in grauntynge is remedy, and in truſte is comforte, but promeſſe is deceyuable, the delayenge is peryllous, and the entreatynge byndeth. I ſee verye welle, that the haſty demaunde deſerueth a longe aunſwere: but I wold not that thou ſhuldeſt do ſoo: but as I deſyre the, ſoo deſyre me. I ſaye agayne, I am all thyne, and not myne owne. And as for my ſelfe in al thynges I wyll ſerue the.

And lady Libia regard, that it were as moche honour for the, as profytable for me, to tourne thy diſordinate deſyres and pourpoſes. For thou ſeeſt well it is moch better to heale ſhortly than to late with faylynge of thy pourpoſe. All women kepe one daungerous opynyon, that is, they wyll neuer receyue counſell that is gyuen them in a great cauſe: and if it be ſo, as I thynke, ſyth thou arte prayſed and eſtemed of great beautie, than be eſtemed to receyue good counſell. And in this maner in caſe that my domage be very great, and thy pacience very lyttell, I ſhalbe called wiſe to gyue the ſuche counſell, and thou ryghte gratious to folowe it. One thynge I ſaye, and pardone me, though I ſhewe it to the, howe that women be greatly infamed, that wyll take no counſell, and ſuche as wylle aſſure their renoume by the opinion of other, as moche as though they were determyned ſo to doo their ſelfe. Wherfore I wolde ye ſhuld do one thyng for an other, as I coū
                  ſayle you. And if thou fyndeſt any ylle therby, withdrawe thy hande. I wyll ſay no more to the, but that I doo preſent to the al my vnhappy troubles, my deſperate ſyghes, and my ſeruyces as thy ſeruaunt: My troubled dolours, my wordes of philoſophy, and my amorous teares. Alſo I ſende the a gyrdelle of golde, and I gyue it the on the condition, that thou ſette thyn eies theron, and apply thy harte to me. I pray the goddis to gyue me to the, and the to me. Marcus Aurelius the philoſopher writeth this in very great ſecrete.
               ¶THVS ENDETH THIS GOLDEN Boke of the eloquent Marc Aurelie emperour: who ſo euer be reder therof may take it by reaſon for a ryche and a newe labour, and ſpecially pryncis and gouernours of the common welth, and myniſters of iuſtyce with other. Alſo the common people eche of theym may fynde the labour conueniente

to their eſtate. And therin is conteyned certayne right hygh and profounde ſentences, and holſom counſelles, and meruaylous deuyſes ageynſt thencumbraunce of fortune: and ryght ſwete cōſolations for them that are ouerthrowen by fortune. Finally it is good to them that digeſte it, and thanke god that hath gyuen ſuche grace to a paynym, in gyuynge vs exaumple of vertuous lyuynge, with hye and ſalutary doctrines and meruaylous inſtructions of perfectnes. Certainly as great prayſe as ought to be gyuen to the auctour, is to be gyuen to the tranſlatours, that haue laboriouſly reduced this treatyſe oute of Greke into latyn, and out of latyn into Caſtilian, and out of Caſtilyan into frenche, and out of frēche into engliſhe, writen in high and ſwete ſtyles. O ryght happy trauayle, ſythe that ſuche fruyte is iſſued therof. And alſo bleſſyd be the handes that haue wrytten hit. A ryghte precyous meate is the ſentences of this boke: But finally the ſauce of the ſayd ſwete ſtyle moueth the appetite. Many bokes there be of ſubſtancial meates, but they be ſo rude and ſo vnſauery, and the ſtyle of ſo ſmal grace, that the fyrſte morſell is lotheſome and noyful: And of ſuche bokes foloweth to lye hole and ſounde in Lybraries, but I truſte this wylle not. Of trouthe great prayſe is due to the auctour of his trauayle. And ſyth there can be no grace equipolent in erthe, lette vs pray to god to gyue hym grace &amp; rewarde in heuen. Amen. Graces to god.
