            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).

THOMAS Earle of
Arundel, primer Earle of England, and
one of his Maiesties most honourable
Councell, &amp;c.
            
               RIGHT HONOVRABLE:
            
            
               SVch as my poore selfe, that am
only a looker on of your vertues,
as a Passenger in a streete beholding
the Frontispice of some delicate
Edifice, but debarred the
entrance and search into the inward
roomes, must be contented,
or if you please indebted to the
opinion and report of others; which I haue found so
ample and enlarged concerning your great Honour,
and greater worthinesse, that I will forbeare any further
insinuation, least I step into a kind of flattery, a vice incident
to most men, refused of none, yet in all fortunes
to be disclaimed of a Gentleman: only I must adde
this, that I am proud of mine owne assurance, that you
are borne to adorne our Country, and illustrate our
Court, wherein your industrie, loyaltie, and immaculate
truth shall make your vertues compleat and triumphant.
Therefore great Lord haue I chosen out this

History, meerely for the strangenesse, and charactred
you the Patron of my endeauours for the obseruations,
that the remarkeable passages heerein proposed, of
which euen Scotland had a part, may serue for all persons
in such dignity and eminent places, both for precept,
and caution.
            For Precept, to florish in their owne honours, and
moue in their owne orbes, sticking close to the glory
of their Countrie, and clinging to the sides of Maiesty,
that the King may aske, what shall be done to the man,
whom he would honour, and the Common-wealth follow
them with Panegyricall applauses, who preserue
her peace from the rauishing, and deforming of strangers,
be the hopes to the contrary neuer so probable,
or inductiue.
            For Caution, not once to put any confidence in deceiuers,
nor belieue the Diuell himselfe, though he promise
to giue the Kingdomes of the World, which are
none of his: yet, I confesse him Prince of the same,
that is, of the abuses and impieties therein both raging,
and raigning: and the rather, because the end hath euer
beene perdition of body, soule, honour, estates and
posteritie: nor can the pleading of simplicitie in the seduction,
or ignorance in the credulity serue the turne:
For though Princes ma
                  â€¢
               y times haue beene drawne to
pardon the offences of Subiects, and refractary delinquents,
wallowing or rather sunk ouer head &amp; eares in
the mierie bogs of such conuulsions: yet are they not
alwaies to be presumed vpon, nor will the Common-wealth
endure the indignitie, or giue way to any person
whatsoeuer in vilipending the gouernment.
            I humbly therefore request your Honour to reade

ouer this true and strange Story, and take in worth my
good meaning, which presenteth the same vnto you
I protest without any other motiue, then to see you florish,
as a supportation of our Common-wealth, and iewel
of our kingdome. As for the faults and my presumption,
I expect, that that vertue and goodnesse, which
must make you famous in this world, and happy in the
world to come, will extend but her owne properties to
my pardon and admission, knowing that if I haue done
ill; wisdome is not bought in the market, and yet God
bids vs come without money; if well, it is in your honourable
fauour, and noble acceptation.

               TO speake of the commendation of history is
not my meaning; nor of the necessity my
purpose: For besides the definition, and
explanation of Tully himselfe, you haue
at least forty seuerall bookes, which begin
(as I do) with a preface, as a preparatiue to
the Reader, to take their books within their gentle embraces,
meerely vpon the commendation of history. I leaue all vnnamed,
except Sr. Henry Sauill for Tacitus, Sr. Walter
Raleigh for his history of the world, Dr. Haward for the
three Norman Kings, and Henry the fourth. In whose
writings, let vs write, what we can, as much is written, as
either delight, profit, or priuate respect can extend vnto:
so that I say I desist from that generall insinuation concerning
the credit, or particular satisfaction of history, and
come to more familiar opening the carpet of the businesse
proposed. Onely this I will adde, that I had rather read
one true story handsomly set vpon the frame of Precept
and Caution,
               True Histories to be preferred before all prophane and deuised rel
                     â€¢
                  tions. then a thousand fictions diuerting my imaginary
conceits to thinke vpon, and (as wee say) spend themselues
on impossibilities, and corrupt my meditation with
vaine, foolish, beastly, and triuiall deuises, which are the

more ridiculous, because there is substance, and matter enough
in verity, to set on worke any humour and inuention
whatsoeuer, &amp; satisfie apprehensions euen in their wanton,
and exoticke wandrings.
            For in this house of repast, which my Iuy-bush inuites
you to, wouldst thou be made partaker of the attributes appropriate
to the Diuine Maiesty? Heere are manifested his
prouidence, wisdome, mightinesse, power, iustice, mercy,
preuention, loue, goodnesse, maiesty, &amp;c, Wouldst thou be
made acquainted with the secrets of Religion? heere are
demonstrated the vanities of ceremonies, the necessity of
adoration, the encumbrances of superstition, the simplicity
of times, the darknesse of Popery, the feare of excommunication,
the reuerence of Priest-hood, and the folly of deuises?
Wouldst thou know the policies of gouernment, and dignity
of a King? heere you shall see, what the desire of soueraignty
can doe, the iealousie of a Princes estate, the reuenge of
wrongs, the feare of troubles and innouation, the inconstancy
of the people; the danger of factions, und the senerall passages
of a prosperous, or declining estate? Wouldst thou bee
quickned with the remembrance of pleasure, heere are particulars
of delight, courtings of Ladies, amorous encounters,
triumphant shewes, deceitfull vanities, and some idle relations?
Wouldst thou see vertue mounted on a pinnacle of
her palace? heere are wisdome, grauity, constancy, magnanimity,
endurances of misfortune, and moderation of power
and greatnesse. Wouldst thou behold vice in her deformity?
heere are enuy, hatred, malice, pride, ambition, desire of
reuenge, rebellion, contumacy, stubbornnesse, and such like.
Wouldst thou be acquainted with passions? heere are ioy,
feare, sorrow, gladnes, iealousie, mistrust, &amp; all of that sort.
Wouldst thou see other varieties? Heere are Princes deceiued,

hopers abused, liers execrated, traytours punished, and
the Diuell himselfe confounded. In a word, wouldst thou
heare of strange aduentures? painefull endeauours? heroik
actions? dangerous attempts? military proceedings? heere
is Fortune, as we prophanely run away with the Embleme,
set vpon a wheele, and turned round about by the hand of
an inuisible, and inuincible Deity. Heere is the stage of variety,
and table of wonders? So that I am sure, from the
conquest to this houre, there is no story so remarkable, and
so full of obseruation, either for the ridiculous beginning,
dangerous continuance, or lamentable effects?
            For although the first contentions betweene the houses of
Yorke and Lancaster began questionlesse from the wrong
intrusiou of Henry the fourth,The house of Lancaster began the first wrong. when the right of the
crowne was in Mortimer, and his line by the daughter of
Clarence, King Edward the thirds third sonne, and elder
brother to Iohn of Gaunt: yet there was some probability
and inducement to the reuengers, either mighty armies,
strong factions, many confederates, the next of bloud powerfull
in his owne possession and friends, with such like. But
heere; besides the fanaticall inuention, men were transported
against their owne conscience and knowledge, and assumed
armes to doe they knew not what, onely because they
would be counted factious, stirring, and resembling the fish
Saepia, which cast into any water befroths the same, and in
the conclusion, the end as the beginning, and both like a paper
castle quickly set on fire, or if you will, a confection of
spicery, which after it is carried round about the house, is
placed vpon the table with great wonder, amazement and
delight both at the st
                  â€¢
               ffe, and contriuing: but what is the
issue? the lookers on at last fall to, and pull euen the guns
and houses a peeces, and eat them.
            
               In Ireland,
               Rebellion in Ireland naturall. I remember, they lay an imputation of basenesse
and cowardice on any man, that hath not beene in action,
as they tearme it, or hath not had his pardon and protection:
so that custome makes them Traytours, and the vainglory
of reputation many times brings their necks to the
halter: yet it is somewhat tolerable for the generality of
the fault, and enforcement of the motiue, being Bards, Rimers,
Harpers, Preists, whom the very women 
                  â€¢
               ug in
their bosomes, for seducing their Noble-men, and Gentlemen,
and enciting them to reuenge. Vpon this ground, they
must prosecute, first some things worthy the honor of their
ancestors, and next remember the deploration of Religion,
Liberty, and the vsurpation of their Countrey, all which
the English haue from time to time intruded vpon, and are
not to be endured in their tyranny, as they make them beleeue.
But in this our story, there is nothing sauouring true
heroiknesse, nor worthy the name of commiseration and
assistance. For the best excuse ariseth from shadowes,
smoake, vapours, foolish enterprizes, and vniustifiable actions,
wherein onely the power of God is manifested and
made apparant, that from so small beginnings, and slender a
fountaine, such turbulent streames and raging riuers should
arise, euen to endanger one of the flourishingst Kingdomes
in the world: yea, my heart trembles to imagine, that so
great a Prince, in the vnity of a right, by an vnpreuentable
marriage, should be heaued at in so formidable a manner by
an vpstart, and (as I may say) puppet stuft with straw, to
scare away crowes.
            I haue read of one Spartago
               Spar
                     â€¢
                  ago. a Fencer, that taking vpon
him the person of Scribonianus, drew a great party together:
which as Nero laughed to scorne, so indeed the Common
wealth quickly put to flight. Likewise, the other day

in Venice, Florence, and many principalities of Italy, a
strange Impostor after 30. yeares or thereabouts, made them
belieue he was Sebastian King of Portugall,
               Sebastian. slaine in Barbarie
at the battaile of Alcazar, as was supposed, but in
truth recouered, &amp; obscured for a time &amp;c. I might also add
the cunning of Richard Duke of Yorke, who being in Ireland,
animated the Kentish rebell Iack Cade to personate
the name of Mortimer,
               Mortimer. for a trial how the people would affect
that Title: But these florishes were only the rash burnings
of a bauin, as soone extinguished as on a flame, and
quickly ouerthrowne, vpon the first discouery: Only this
story for the varietie, the continuance, the manner, and all
other circumstances, hath made me (as I said before) amazed,
and may in the reading produce the same effects in
others: Yet againe, when I consider the estate of mans
frailty, mutable, troublesome, and full of encumbrances,
and ouerlooke the condition of mortality, which in Princes
themselues is subiect to inconueniences, and many times
fearefull conuulsions, I wonder the lesse, because God will
be knowne vnto them, and they haue for the most part preuailed
in their rights, and iustifiable endeauours. For
which I also pray, that they may still hold vp the heads of
triumphant &amp; vnchangeable greatnesse, wherein (no doubt)
the same diuine arme of potencie which hath protected
others, will also support them from all dangerous enterprizes
and fearefull treasons, either of Forraine or Domestique
aduersaries.
            But amongst other remarkeable accidents, this is not the
least, that so many examples, so many heads cut off, so many
Armies ouerthrowne,Treason did neuer long prosper. so many honourable families consumed,
so much blood spilt, so great reuenges taken (as if all
such enterprises were cursed in the wombe, and brought

forth like an vntimely Embrion) could neuer affright others,
nor be a sufficient warning to succeeding times, but
euery occasion of innouation, were it neuer so foolish or exorbitant,
still excited one or other to parts taking, and
brought them to vntimely ouerthrowes, either by their Armies,
and confederates discomfited, or by their enditements,
and accusations enlarged in iudiciall triall against them: but
this is the cunning of the Deuill, who to fill vp the vast
dungeon of Hell, make men so prodigall of their liues and
honours, or so couetous of reuenge, and vain-glory, that so
they may haue a name with Herostratus, who burned the
the Temple of Diana; they care not for the reproach, supposing
that as many will extoll them for braue stirring spirits,
as condemne them for Traitors and disobedient Subiects.
O ridiculous and abhominable conceits! O hatefull
and filthie imaginations! O deceiueable and imposturing
impietie: Nay, in a word, O horrible and flagitious madnesse!
without reason, likelyhood or inference of any probable,
or perswasiue circumstance.
            But least my Preface extend beyond the boundes of my
hearts commission, I will attend the particulars of my Story,
with this expostulation to all noble and generous spirits;
yea, I will kneele on my knees and hold vp my hands vnto
them, that they giue no way to any deceiueable seduction of
Pope, Iesuite, Priest, Faction, Innouation, Repining at the
State, Priuate ambition, Corrupted malice, and such like,
against the current of gouernment, or the ebbings and flowings
of the world and times. For the Maiestie of Kings will
not be tied vp with the slender bindings of rebellion, nor
taught any lesson against their wils either of fauouring, or
disfauouring, whom they please. As for personall faults;
Alas, Princes, Prelates, Officers, Maiestrates, and all sorts

of men will runne the race of mortality; and if it were
possible to remoue offenders at pleasure, the persons may be
changed, but the imperfections continue. Let them therefore
alone a Gods name; for they must stand or fall to the
estate of their liues, which he hath appointed: only this I
will be bold to say, I would haue no man for any priuate respect
runne in the outragious races of sinnes himselfe, or defend
any wickednesse in others, beare with great men in
their vices, flatter or temporize for profit or preferment,
yeeld vnto base or degenerating actions either for feare or
fauour; or in a word, doe any thing contrary to Gods word,
wherein as in a glasse men may perspicuously behold the
way of life and death, and the infallible positions,
which in the affirmatiue and negatiue
conclude all things either by
precept, or interdiction.

            THE TRVE AND
wonderfull History of PERKIN
VVARBECK.
            
               THE contentions betweene the houses
of Yorke and Lancaster, are the subiects
of many discourses, and therefore I
will insist the lesse either vpon Genealogies,
Titles, Vsurpations, Warres, Factions,
Encounters, Reuenges, Battails,
Slaughters, or other accidentall outrages,
which for 90. yeares filled the
wrinckles of the face of our Common-wealth of England,
with the blood and sweat of tenne Kings and Princes of the
race roiall: 60 Dukes and Earles: 1000 Lords and Knights:
and 150000 Soldiers and people. Only I must make a little
commorance and abiding in the wretched and ragged
house of enuie and malice, gouerned and ouerseene by a
woman, who was so opposite and aduerse to the Lancastrian
family, that for all King Henry the seuenth had obtained the
Crowne by a strong hand; and as we say, diuinitÃ¹s praemunitus:
yea, debarred all Titles, or fuming shadowes of Titles,
by consummating that mariage with the Lady Elizabeth eldest
daughter of Edward the fourth: she yet contriued all
the waies of his ouerthrow, and inuit Ã¢ fortunÃ¢ entertained
euery occasion, which might adde fuell to the fier of her inueterate

hate, and blood-thirstie humor of reuenge, as if she
had beene borne like certaine Antipathies in nature, which
cannot endure any neighbour-hood or commixture: such
as the Eugh and Palme: the Figge and Vine: the strings of
Wolues and Sheep, which makes me remember the story of
Eteocles and Pollinices the sonnes of Oedipus, whose hate was
so great in their liues, that after death, the bones being burnt
togeather, the flame of the sacrifice deuided asunder.
            This was Margaret Dutches of Burgundy,
               Margaret Duches of Burgundy chiefest enemy of Henry the seuenth. sister of Edward
the fourth, and a sworne aduersary to cast the red Rose
of England, into the black pit of confusion; who perceiuing
her first hopes frustrated, and annihilated concerning the
progression of Lamberts enterprises, studied night and day
vpon further and further instigations; yea, houered ouer
opportunitie like a hawke for her pray, to torment and trouble
the peace of England: embracing euery strange and
prestigious illusion, and not caring with what pullies of ridiculous
and impossible actions her malice and reuenges
were woond vp, so they might be hurried downe againe
vpon the head of the King, whom she cursed on her knees,
and hated, euen beyond the tendernesse of her sex, many of
her owne friends for his sake. Therefore to weary his patience
a little more, she set vp another puppet like the former,
one Peter Warbeck a Fleming, to act a part of wonder on the
Stage of dangerous Innouation, and take vpon him the Title
of Richard the fourth Prince of England, and white Rose of
the same: But before I play the Midwife, or (if you will)
Phisitian with her, to deliuer her wombe of this monstrous
birth of Peter Warbeck, whom she taught the cunning and
audacious impudency of personating Richard Duke of Yorke
murthered with his brother in the Tower by Richard the
third some eight yeare before. I thinke it not impertinent to
our purpose in hand, to tell you, what this Lambert was, and
wherein he seemed cosened with the whorish smiles of an adulterate
fortune by the only meanes, and coadiutement of
this Dutches of Burgundy.
            
            The first and second yeares of Henry the seuenth swelled

to so great a height of ioy, blessednesse, and contentment
from the rivulets of King Richards slaughter, the corroboration
of his estate, the amity of the Nobles, the mariage with
the eldest daughter of Yorke, the birth of Prince Arthur,
the league and amitie of forraine Princes, and the applause
of all his subiects, that the diuine prouidence thought it
meet to temper and allay the excesse of the same with
some mixtures of feares and displeasure, lest mortalitie
might presume too farre, and man triumph, that his owne
arme of flesh had contriued his establishment. So that
the Lord Louel;
               The Lord Louel and Stafford rebell against Henry the seuenth. 
               Humphrey, and Thomas Stafford, with
Sir Thomas Broughton and diuers others, attempted a
dangerous rebellion, and drew into the field a great Army
against the King; whom to preuent, the Duke of Bedford
with such forces as could be raised on a soddain,
made hast to an encounter; but his fortune was so good,
that with a successefull Oratory, not striking a stroake, he
preuailed to dissipate those threatning and thickning clouds
of disturbance. For after he had intimated the hainousnes
of their transgression, &amp; nature of their offences, which were
capital Treasons, &amp; with al inferred the Kings great mercy,
which was willing to pardon their rashnesse and pitiful ouersights,
so they would desist, and retire peaceably into their
Countries: the whole company surceased, and quietly deposed
their Armes; whereupon, the Lord Louel fled, and
the Staffords tooke Sanctuary in a Village called Culnaham
two miles from Abington: but because the Iudges of the law
alledged that the Townes of refuge among the Iewes were
ordained for other purposes;No Sa
                     â€¢
                  ct
                     â€¢
                  ary for Traitors. and that Ioab was killed holding
by the hornes of the Altar, and the places of priuiledges
in England were neuer meant to suborne Traitors:
Humphrey Stafford was taken by force from the Towne and
sent to the Tower, from whence they brought him to Tyborne,
and there put him to execution: His yonger Brother
Thomas was notwithstanding remitted, as a man, whom
consanguinitie and brother-hood had rather deceiued, then
wilfulnesse and malice against the King abused. O blessed

wisedome! that can so temper Iustice with the consideration
of mens frailties, and other maleuolent circumstances to
keep her a while from contracting a brow of reuenge vpon
euery offender, and had rather draw some men to a sweet obedience
from their penetencie and newnesse of life, then
cut off other-some by the strong hand of execution: and
thus in other cases of State it many times chanceth, that euen
accessaries are condemned, when the principals go free; yea,
in the highest degree of Treason, which is displaying of colours,
and taking vp Armes against a Prince; it is sometimes
better taken in action, then in coÌ„sultation: yet is there no presuming
on fauor in any of these cases, nor taking hands with
example to trace in the by paths of any indirect courses.
            But as mischiefes according to Euripides seldome come
alone, and vnd
                     â€¢
                   vndam sequitur: so presently vpon the neck
of this followed a strange and wonderfull trouble, through
the insurrection of one Lambert Siminel taking vpon him
the person of Edward Earle of Warwicke,
               
                  
                     â€¢
                   new Earle of Warwick. sonne of George
Duke of Clarence, newly come into the hands of the King,
and committed to the Tower. This Lambert was induced
(or if ye wil seduced) to this enterprise by the diuel himpostures
of Richard Simond a Priest, who was so hasty in his accounts,
and forward in his reckoning
                  â€¢
               , that he presently proiected,
that if Lambert could be King, he should be an Arch-bishop
at least: O manifest a phrenesis! whereby the way you
may obserue, that neuer enterprise was atchieued to the dissipation
of Monarchies and translation of Kingdomes; neuer
mischiefe set on foot, nor wickednesse put on the wings of
preuailing: but from the contriuance and coadiutement of a
Priest, &amp; such men as professed the Religion of tho
                  â€¢
               e times,
as in Histories may appeare. But if you descend into Europe,
and come lower amongst our selues, I dare say, that from
the conquest to this hower, all exorbitant actions, dangerous
attempts, terrible enforcements, neuer heard of Projects,
and monstrous commotions to the effusion of Christian
blood, and weakning the glory of our kingdome, haue
beene atchieved, and furthered by the meanes of Popish

Priests and Iesuites, and the damnable Doctrines and instructions
of their associates, meere hypocrites both in life
and Doctrine: yea, that monstrous terror of Christendome,
the family of Ottaman, and religion of Mahomet was blowne
so big, as you see it in the furnace of Sergius a counterfeit
Monke, and now set on the Throne of imperiousnesse
through his supportation and assistance in composing the
Alcaron.
            When this our Priest Richard Simond, or Versepelles Sinon,
well perceiued and vnderstood the gentle condition and
pregnancy of this Lambert, he wrought most cunningly
vpon him, and thought him a fit instrument to hammer out
the diuelish plots he proiected, whereby questionlesse you
may apprehend the cunning and malice of Sathan who can
entangle men with such strange illusions,The end of diuelish deuices our destruction. and all in the end
to destroy them, and bring them to confusion: How else
can any reasonable man apprehend, that a Scholler and
Priest should be so infatuated as to make a silly fellow take
vpon him the person of a Prince, laid long before in his
graue, and murthered by the tyrannie of an vnnaturall Vncle.
Yet did this nouice goe forward with these strange disguises,
like a ceeled doue flying into the hawkes feisure by
her own wilfulnesse and blindnesse, and as if the Poet should
cry out,
Medeae faciunt ad scelus omne manus:
So was he led by the hands of this Priest, who was now set
vpon nothing but wickednesse, and at the last plunged into
the Sea of turmoiles.
            But the chiefe originall of this disturbance arose from a
certaine fame, and report, that King Edwards children were
not dead, but secretly conueied into some other Country,
as Edward surnamed the Outlaw had in former times beene
into Hungary, and that Edward Earle of Warwicks should be
shortly put to death: O simple men! and oh vaine multitude!
that are caried away with euery winde, belieue vnconstant
reports, rely on foolish prophesies, and runne along
with vncertaine rumors, which makes me remember one of

ioy whereof brought him into such an extasie, that he quite
forgot the vnion of the houses, and how the King had married
the eldest brothers daughter, which must needs be a bar
to Warwicks claime, when wise men came to discusse of the
matter: but resolued in the errour of his illusion, he strongly
coni

               ily.
Besides, he knew that actio nulla laudata nisi peracta, and therfore
some thing must bee done to set the people on worke,
though it were with throwing firebrands of diuision and falsity
amongst them, euen to the dazling of their eyes with
smoake, and casting the sparks about their eares: wherupon
both craftily and audaciously he put his businesse to the triall
and sailed with his pupill ouer into Ireland, where his
Grand-father and Ancestors had gotten such loue and respect,
that euen the name of Mortimer and Yorke was sanctified
and religious amongst them: For barbarous nations are
strong obseruers of ceremonies &amp; customes, and whatsoeuer
hath taken root and impression amongst them, will hardly
be remoued or extinguished, as it is too lamentably apparant
at this houre, where the imposturing of Priests hath got
the vpper hand of all religion and piety, and to sweare by
Oneales hand, is of more efficacy, then to call God and Heauen
to witnesse.
            Heere he smoothly made relation of his owne, and the
Princes fortunes, and escape to certaine of the Nobility, especially
of Geraldines, whom hee knew euery way transpo

was iudiciously preuented, and hee had from a meere commiseration

manner, and to such a place, where he supposed true-hearted

honour was resident, and care of religion and humanity
maintained.
            Whereupon Th. Geral

ayd, comfort, and supportation. To this you must suppose
was an answer ready, and such an one deliuered with so
smooth and attractiue a demeanour, that though hee had
not beene such as hee protested: yet hee would haue sworne
him of 
                  â€¢
               igh birth and extraordinary bringing vp, which caused
him to assemble together all his affinity, and friends, to
whom he related the matter, as it chanced, with intimation
of the glory of the enterprize, and the good seruice to God
and the Church, for establishing a Prince deiected in his
throne, who was the

               rue and onely Plantaginet, left to spring
vp into a spredding tree of royalty, and therefore hee requested
their loyalty and resolued courages to take his part, that
the right heire of the crowne might bee restored to England,
and themselues eternized to heereafter memory, for so meritorious
a worke. Little needed a spur (saith our Prouerb) to
a forward horse, all that saw him beleeued it, and such as
heard onely the report, according to the Poet,
â€”&amp; errorem vocis, vt omen, amo,
Clapt their hands for ioy, that they should bee employed in
an enterprize of such wonder and important greatnesse:
whereupon money, horse, armour, men, and all things else
were promised, which might be aduantagious to such a businesse.
But alas, Ireland was too weake, and of themselues
they did onely discouer their malice, curbed yet with insufficiency,
giuing the King notice, how their wills exceeded
their power, and that they were ready to entertaine euerie
opportunitie to doe any mischeefe. Therefore they sent
ouer into England, acquainting many discontented persons
with the businesse: but most principally, as to the life of
their actions, they submitted to Margaret Duches of Burgundy,
               
sister of King Edward the fourth, for her directions.
This was a woman of a wonderfull composure, so adorned
with princely qualities,Margaret Duches of Burgundy entertaineth this quarrell. and setled in Maiesticall authoritie,
as you shall heare heereafter, that she was admired of all Europe,
and beloued in her owne countrey. Onely as stinking
flies lying secretly in boxes of sweet oyntments, putrifie the
same, did an innated malice, and virulent hatred to the Lancastrian
Family, corrupt her other vertues, and (as it were)
thrust vp her princely enduments into a meere bog &amp; poole
of dirt and filthinesse: For although shee knew the bloud of
Yorke extinguished, and that the Earle of Warwicke was in
King Henries possession, as taken forth together with the
Lady Elizabeth now his wife, out of the castle of Sherrington
in Yorke-shire, vnder the custodie of Sr. Robert Willoughby:
Yet insatiate in her hate and so consequently in her reuenge:
Nam ingentes parturit ira minas:
She admitted of euerie motion of disturbance, and inuented
meanes of her owne, to set in combustion the whole s
                  â€¢
               ate of
England, vnder a hopefull pretence to see the King ouerthrowne
and supplanted.
            Thus did she pile vp together the fire of this disturbance,
and countenanced the matter more with her greatnesse and
power, then all the other complices besides: but if you aske
me, how she continued in this authority, being a widow, amongst
strangers, and enemie to so great a Prince as the
King of England: I will answer in a word, and measure out
the cheefe and principall cord that bound her royaltie together.
Charles Duke of Burgoine, hauing married this Lady
Margaret, daughter to Richard Duke of Yorke, and sister to
Edward the fourth, had yet no issue by her, but left one sole
daughter behinde him named Mary, which hee had by his
first wife the daughter of the Duke of Bourbon: this was married
to Maximilian sonne to Frederick the Emperour, by
whom he had two Princes, Philip and Margaret, which children
after the death of the Lady Mary their mother, this
Lady Margaret Duches Dowager so entirely beloued, so
tenderly brought vp, so motherly nourished, and so carefully

preserued, that she was highly reputed of, and esteemed
for the same: To which, when she added a politique ordring
her affaires, both for the maintenance of their honour, and
administration of Iustice in the Common-wealth: so that I
may say with the ancient Poet,Eurip. M
                     â€¢
                  d
                     â€¢â€¢

               Saepenumero iam per subtiliores
sermones iui, &amp; ad contentiones veni maiores, quam conueniat genus
foemineum perscrutari, &amp;c. The whole bodie of the gouerment
willingly consented to be apparrelled and adorned
after her fashion, so that like an absolute Prince indeed, she
proceeded both in the gouernment for their benefit, and the
illustration of her owne greatnesse.
            In this Orb of reputation thus moouing herselfe, she still
shined like a full planet, from whose influence could proceede
nothing but sweet presages, till stepping aside into a
contrary motion of despight and rankor against the King, as
an enemie to knowledge and her owne conscience, she countenanced
this ridiculous &amp; yet vnhappy coniuration, which
by her meanes grew apace, like broad and stinking burs, vnprofitable
in themselues, and spoiling all the grasse about
them, vntill at last they were by a politique hand of preuention
pull'd vp by the roots, and cast vnder foot into the dirt.
For when King Henry was certefied of all these tumults and
comminations, and knew the deepnesse and fulnesse of the
channell, in which the tottered barke of this rebellion steered,
he verily supposed the best point of wisdome was principi
                     â€¢
                  s
obstare, and so attempted with all care and vigilancy to
turne the rage of those troubles another way, or else to preuent
them from flowing ouer the banks of his enclosures,
and although the collusion &amp; fraud of the inuention, vexed
him more then the matter or substance of such a rebellion:
yet hee moderated his anger, and with Ianus looked both
waies, smiling with one face at the ridiculousnesse and deceit
of the proiect: and marking warily with another, all the
meanes to redact the confused Chaos of this molestation to
better order and vniformity, desiring onely at Gods hands
to preuent effusion of bloud, which must needes bee spilt in
any settled warre and contracted army. Besides, in well ordred

battells, the euent was disputable, and many times punishments
were ordained, as well to reduce good men ad
correctionem and amendment, as to bring bad men to ruinam
and destruction. And therfore if it were possible, he would
rebate the insolency by other meanes, and diuert it from
handy blowes and bloudy contentions: whereupon he called
his Councell together at the Charter-house besides his
royal mannour of Richmond and there consulted, how to pacifie
this sudden tumult and conspiracy, without any further
disturbance or open defiance. This motion of the
Kings so tempered with grauity, mercy, and commiseration,
was so well accepted of the whole company, that they presently
applauded his high wisdome, and religious care, and
put in practise, whatsoeuer seemed conuenient for their intended
affaires.
            They first began with a generall pardon, published to all
offenders that were content to receiue the same,Articles agreed vpon by the Councell, to pr
                     â€¢
                  
                  uent the warre. and remain
obedient to the Maiestie of England. For although at this
very instant Sr. Th. Broughton, who had obscured the Lord
Louell a great season from the King, was in a manner ready
to giue him battell, with many friendly coadiutors and a
well-settled army: yet did the King thinke it policie to desist
from a forcible ouerrunning them; because, as desperate of
life or pardon, considering their former treasons and abuses,
they would hardly be reclaimed in their rages, but now fight
for their liues and liberties. Againe, in shewing exemplarie
Iustice vpon them, once subiect to accusation or condemnation,
he must needes proceed against many, yea such whose
offences in standing out, could admit of no pardon: and
therefore (as I sayd) he gently proclaimed the same, which
was much auailable to his purpose. For euen those, which
fauoured the Lord Louell most, began to stagger in their resolutions,
when they perceiued the Kings benignitie, and
knew with what lenitie and commiseration he was willing to
proceede.
            Secondly, they thought it necessary and pertinent to
their peace, to shew the sonne of Clarence personally abroad

in the Citie, and other publike places, whereby the rumor
might be dashed out of countenance, and the purblinde eies
of false opinion extinguished. For such an impression this

                  â€¢
               ictiue relation of his escape had made, that though they beheld
him present, yet durst some of them sweare, it was but
a deuise of the Kings: whereby you may obserue the danger
and inconueniences of idle reports, which if they be not
strangled in the cradle with Hercules Serpents, and smothered
betimes, ere they come to stronger groth and life, will
viper like after they haue receiued warmth in ones bosome,
fly in his face: Nay, such is the nature of deuices in a tottering
Common-wealth, that prohibitions to restraine them,

nothing but truth, left to their owne liberty; being prohibi

               ed,
diuulge more then they meant.
            Thirdly, It was determined, that Queene Elizabeth
wife to Edward the fourth should loose her lands, and be deposed
from all manner of sway in the gouernment, because
she had voluntarily submitted her selfe and daughters to the
hands of King Richard, whereby all former contract
                  â€¢
                and
pretences of establishment might haue beene frustrated,
through the inconstancie of a woman: or as the State pretended
a priuate ambition, or couetousnesse to set any loome
on worke to weaue the web of her owne pleasure and contentment,
which although was a heinous crime, and very
dangerous to the present Kings peace and tranquillitie: yet,
questionlesse the doome and iudgement seemed ouer rigorous:
Durus fuit hic sermo, and if euer 
                  
                     ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰
                   ius proued
summa iniuria, it was verified in this verdict. For questionlesse
they forgot the turbulency of those times, the rage of
the tyrant, the fearefulnesse of many accidents, the seducing
                  â€¢
               
of a King, and the flattering promises of a whole Common-wealth,
wherein stronger iudgements might haue falled then
a womans: But it should seeme that God hath a speciall
hand in the punishment of sinnes, and disposing of Kingdomes.
For without controuersie, if she consented to the
murthering of King Richards wife for her owne ease and emolument,

if she seemed an aduersary to the good pretended,
to England by vniting the 
                  â€¢
               amilies: or if she proiected her
owne aduancement in the present glory of the Kingdome,
forgetting the losse of her husband, the murther of her
kindred, the slaughter of her children, the odiousnesse of
the incest, and the curse of Heauen vpon crying sins: God
would neuer suffer such horrible faults vnreuenged, but
as you heare inflicted her wauering and inconsiderate timerousnesse
with this punishment: For, she was presently confined
to the Abbey of Barmondsey in Southwarke, and there
deceased after she had liued a while in some calamitous distresse,
and excruciation both of soule and body: such are
all humane instabilities, wordly chances, and the condition
of Princes themselues. Otherwise, she that being a poore widow
had resisted the Kings importunity, &amp; by her chast and
modest behauiour attracted his good will to marry her: she
that had founded a Colledge in Cambridge, bearing her

of learning, and education of Children and Students:
she, that had loued her husband, and the glory of England,
endeauouring all things to the augmentation of the honor
of them both: she, that seemed proud in workes of charity,
and to help forward the petitions of honest complainants
and distressed suiters: she, that kneeled on her knees for
Clarences liberty, and importuned the King to remember
his brother, by the example of Richard the first, who remitted
his brother Iohn a farre greater delinquent; had neuer
fallen so low into the dangerous pit of a sonne in lawes displeasure,
and seene her selfe generally maligned through the
kingdome: or else, as I said, the reuealed things belong to
vs, the secret to God, who questionlesse blew the coales of
this displeasure, to purge the contagion and infection of hi

heart, which was only knowne to himselfe.
            Fourthly, because they knew that reward and hope of
gaine might doe much with corrupted persons, and irresolute
men (as all Rebels were) they proclaimed a gratuity of
a
                  â€¢
               housand pounds sterling to any one which would present

the State with the body of this counterfeit Lambert, to which
they were the rather induced, because not long before, the
Tyrant Richard the third had preuailed with the like against
the Duke of Buckingham, whom his owne seruant Banister
betraied in hope of recompence from the State, which is
also a custome in Italy, where the heads of the Banditi are
vallued at so many checkinos or peeces of gold, and so the
Zaffi, or other desperate Ruffiani obtaine many preies and
booties.
            Last of all, it was concluded to haue forces in readinesse,
and an Army prepared, whatsoeuer should chance, with all
prouision and furniture belonging to the setting forth of the
same, and honour of such a Kingdome, that neither security
or presumption one way of their owne greatnesse and establishment,
might make them too confident of themselues,
nor vilipending and slight regard of the contrary, another
way too negligent against their enemies.
            When all things were thus befitted to the disposing and
ordering their affaires: On a Sunday ensuing, Edward the
yong Earle of Warwick was brought froÌ„ the Tower through
the publike streetes of London to the Cathedrall Church
of Pauls,
               The Earle of Warwicke shewne in publike. where he remained all Procession time and high
Masse, hauing open conference with many of the Nobilitie,
especially such, whom the King suspected might haue been
induced to the commotion vpon the full assurance of his escape.
But if he had asked them why he was imprisoned, or
what transgression the King could impute vnto him, to detaine
him in dures in that manner, and after put him to death
being an infant innocent, without law or reason, I meruaill
what they would haue answered, or how the Councell themselues
would haue satisfied a iudicious questioner in that
kinde: yet by this occasion the imaginations of diuers were
setled, and the better sort belieued, that these Irish newes
were simulatory, and represented Ixions boasting that he
had laien with Iuno, when it was but a cloude, as by the monstrous
birth of the Centaures did appeare.
            But it was not so with all: For, as it often happens in the

stopping of a violent inundation of water, that it causeth it
the more to rage and make a terrible noice, whereas running
in a deep channell it would goe quietly away: So fell it out
in the suppressing of these rumors, and mens hatred and malice:
many were the more exasperated, and by this gentle and
saire course to reduce them, thought all but trickes of policie
to deceiue them; proouing like certaine kinds of burs
and nettles, which soughtly handled sting the more violently,
but hardly crushed together lose their force and energie.
Of this sort was the Earle of Lincolne,
               Iohn de la Pooles sonne Duke of Sus

                   folke by a sister of Edward the fourth. sonne to Iohn de la
Poole Duke of Suffolke;
               Now Earle of Lincolne taketh part with Lambert. and Elizabeth another sister to Edward
the fourth: who much maligning the aduancement of
this Earle of Richmond farre his inferiour (as he supposed)
tooke hold of this open Rebellion as a meet opportunitie to
beate out his own ends on such a pestilent anuile, and therefore
determined to vphold, fortifie, &amp; support this Irish expedition,
and take part with his new cozen, who as he made him
selfe belieue, was escaped indeed, for all the prety conueiances
of the State. This Earle of Lincolne besides his blood,
experience, &amp; wisedome in &amp; great important affaire
                  â€¢
               , had a
priuacy of humor, which many men excepted against, as
fantasticall, and precise: For he was so cautelous in his
words, and singular in his phrases and actions, that he would
neither sweare nor tell a lie, by reason his communication
was still seasoned with sauorie Parenthesis and breakings off,
or if you will Apos
                     â€¢
                  opesis: As I will not confidently auerre it,
but it is so, and so, if men may be credited in their mortalitie.
            The number amounts to so many, if men faile not in
their computations: I dare not iustifie it further then one
my credit another, with such like. Yea, in his enterprises he
was both curious and Roman like for stricknesse of discipline,
yet valiant enough: To conclude in a word, had not
the mantle of greatnesse ouer-couered his gesture and actions,
the same garbe and fashion in an inferior might haue
beene thought ridiculous: but to our purpose in han
                  â€¢
               .
            When he apprehended a kind of feare and iealosie in King

               Henry through this false rumor, he determined with the same
water that draue the Mil to drowne it, and out of this fiction
to raise a matter of consequence, whereupon he presently repaired
to Sir Thomas Broughton and others, who like the
Theeues of Aegypt lying in the reedes by the Riuer Nilus,
breaking out vpon any hope of aduantage vpon the silly passengers,
watched all occasions to be reuenged on the King,
and yet could render no iust account of their discontentments,
and after diuers consultations, concluded to saile into
Flaeunders to his Aunt the Duches, being his Mothers owne
sister, and so without further commorance, after the King
had dissolued the Parliament at London, put the same in
practise, whither he was well commed with all worthy and
kind embraces. Not long after Francis Lord Louel repaired
vnto him well accompanied, where for the time secured, and
assembling themselues with this Position, that omnia efficit
consilium, quod &amp; ferrum hostile efficere potest, lest the World
should laugh them to scorne, for prosecuting idle and vaine
attempts,The Earle of Lincol
                     â€¢
                  e and Lord Louel goe into Ireland to Lambert. they resolue, that the Earle of Liucolne and Lord
Louel should repaire into Ireland, and adde a better countenance
to the businesse by their presence, in attending and
honouring their new King with all gracefull ceremonies and
markes of maiestie: Then, with the power of the Irish-men
to bring him into England, by which time the Duches forces
would be ready to ioine with them. Last of all to giue King

                  ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰
                battaile wheresoeuer: in which if they preuailed, they
might at their pleasures depose this counterfeit Lambert,
and deliuer the true Earle of Warwicke out of prison, in all
which they proceeded accordingly and with expedition.
            But King Henry supposing he had setled and appeased the
minds and vnstable humours of his Nobilitie, by the personall
presence of Edward Earle of Warwicke, began to be lesse
moued and disturbed, yea, as it were secure and carelesse of
any further malice and dangerous attempt against his estate
and dignitie, mistrusting nothing lesse, then any man to be
so foolish and mad, as to belieue that Lambert could be the
Earle: so that he coniectured nothing, but the suppressing

of those barbarous Irish, and the sedation of that trouble,
vntill he heard how the Earle of Lincolne was fled out of the
Realme, vntill he heard how the Lord Louel was confederate
with him, vntil he heard how diuers were vnited vnto them,
vntill he heard how the Duches of Burgoine coadiuted the
enterprise, vntill he heard they had raised a strong party, and
were resolued to giue him battaile; this somewhat moued
him, and exasperated his displeasure: For when he saw no
other cataplasme could serue the turne, but that he must cauterise
the sore, and sere and cut away the putrified flesh of
this corrupted and rebellious body, he determined with
strong hand and martiall power to doe the same.
            Whereupon he commanded his Musters to goe forward,The King rai
                  
                     â€¢
                  eth an Armie.
and appointed the seuerall Captaines a Rendezvous, where
the whole Armie might meet, as occasion and his aduersaries
should incite him, and lest others might pretend discontentments,
wants, debts, deuotion, pilgrimages, and such like,
and so goe out of the Realme after the rest, he gaue order to
all Lieutenants of Shires, Sherifes, Maiors, Bailifes, and officers,
to search and watch the Ports &amp; Hauens for the going
out, and recourse of strangers, or passengers vnlicensed and
vnlimitited.
            Thus what he could not with the Foxes, he was faine
to compas with the Lions skin, &amp; yet knowing, that Victoria

                     â€¢
                  , he did not cast away the other,
but when he saw no Councell nor policie could either l

               niat
their obduratnesse, nor diuert their inficious intents against
him, he resolued with an equall strength, to remoue the
blocks of his peace and quietnesse, cast thus in his way by
flagitious contumacy and ridiculous innouation. But some
fires are not so easily quenched, as raised or maintained: for
though all his aduises, and good order consorted with successe,
yet were they not sufficient to stop the mouth, or hinder
the passage of the present disturbance with deputies or
Commissioners: therefore he set forward in person, supposing
they would arriue from Flanders side on some of those
Coasts, and so came to Saint Edmonds Bury: where he was

certified, that the Lord Thomas Marquesse Dorcet was comming
to him to excuse and purge himselfe of those crimes
enforced against him, or at least such ouersights, in which he
perfunctorily performed his duty while he was in France.
To him was sent the Earle of Oxford by way of anticipation
to intercept at this time his iourney: For the King was too
full of troubles and cogitations about the suppressing his enemies
and new raised tumults, and so could not attend his
businesse:The Lord Mar
                     â€¢
                   quesse Dorce
                     â€¢
                   sent to the Tower. The Earle had only Commission to conuey him
to the Tower, which when some of the Councell supposed
a hard doome, he answered them plainly, What need further
words? If he be my friend, as I am confident thereof, he will
be contented a while to suffer a little reproach and rebuke
for my sake: yea, peraduenture pleasure, and contentment.
If he be otherwise, it is a place of security, and would I had
my aduersaries as safe there, as they would me in the like either
mislike, or contention.
            From thence the King went to Norwich, where he solemnised
the feast of Christmas, and so departed to Walsingham
vnder pretence of deuotion, as the superstition of those
times coacted. For according to that ancient Poet: Ritus

               reijcientes cultus deorum: It was an
instinct of Nature to confesse a Deity, and maintaine the Sacrifices
and offrings to the same. Now, because the most part
of the World knew not the true God, they inuented seuerall
Idols to represent their seuerall Deities, to whom they
brought their praiers and oblations, nor durst they enterprise
any businesse without offertories and deuotion, that
their true intents might be acceptable to the God which
commanded them: yea, such as professed Religion, and abused
their knowledge, inuented Images &amp; deuises to please
the naturall man; because, with the reason of Idolater, they

Now because our Lady was in these times the mediator of
the Papists, and the Lady of Walsingham the most famous
shrine of our Country, as that of Loretto is at this hower for

               Italy. The King went thither for the impetration of prosperity,
in his affaires, and ouerthrow and dissipation of his enemies:
which finished, he retourned to Cambridge, and so
to London.
            
            In the meane while, the fire-brand and fuell of this contention,
Lady Margaret Duches of Burgundy, had blowne
the coales to such a heat, that there were two thousand Almaines
in a readinesse,M

                  rtinus Swart. vnder the conduct of Martin Swart

bold, expert, and daring, whom after great rewards, and secret
directions from a well contracted Oratory, she sent into
Ireland with al his company, where they ariued a

               Dublin,
and were ioyfully welcomed by the Prince and the other
Lords the coufederates, especially the Earle of Lincolne, who
well knew, that no enterprise was to be entertained without
men and money, and good beginnings were the drawers on
of successe in the end. Thus they made no more adoe, but
in the pride and strength of their conspiracy, they proclaimed
yong Lambert King of England, withall the glorious titles,
and glorious manner appropriat, as the time and Countrie
afforded, which ended, with other ceremonies and some
circumstances, to set as vpright their businesse as they could,
they protracted no time, but knowing the secret of expedition,
which as their case stood, must be their best friend, prepared
for England: the Army consisting (as yet principally)
of high Almaines, and a multitude of beggerly Irish, which
according to the Roman saying, were many men, and few
Soldiers. For their best defences were Scains and Mantles,
and heere and there a slender dart, more fitter for a maigame
and to moue wonderment, then to oppose against good defences,
and well ordred troopes.Lambert with his Armie commeth into England. Of these the Lord Thomas
Gerardine was Captaine, and with these and the rest,
they landed for a speciall purpose (or if you will to vni
                  â€¢
               e
themselues with Sir Thomas Broughton, one of the chiefe
commanders in this vnhappy conspiracy) at the Pile of Foudray
within a little of Lancaster.
            
            These affaires so notorious, and so publike, could not

haue so secret a passage and contriuance, but the worthy and
wise King must needes be made acquainted with the same:
whereupon he dispatched certaine horse and scout-masters,
through the West parts of the Realme, to attend the arriuall
of his enemies abroad: yea, peraduenture to ouerwatch the
actions of his friends at home, as much troubled with the
vnconstancy of these, as perturbed with the rebellion of
them. Presently after he raised a sufficient Armie, ouer
which the Duke of Bedford, and Earle of Oxford were principall
commanders, whom he sent forward before him, then
he came in person to Couentrey, where the principall rendezuous
was appointed, and where he first heard of the landing
of his enemies. Within a while he could fill vp a scedule
with the chiefe Traitors names, and the manner of their
troopes and proceedings: Last of all, he called a Councell,
proposing only two principall matters vnto them: First,
whether it were better to encounter with his enemies out of
hand, as Achitophel perswaded Absalom to do against Dauid,
and so to dissipate them by maine force and expedition, according
to the Poet:
Tolle moras:Lucan. lib. 1. semper nocuit differre paratis.
Secondly, or weary them out by delaies and detracting of
time, as Quintus Fabius surnamed after Maximus did by
Hannibal, and so sent him far enough from Rome into Brutia
and Apuleia, whereupon he was eternized with,
Vnus homo nobis cunctando restituit rem.
            
            The conclusion was, that though many times great Armies,
whose fury at the first rushes could not be rebated,
were at last spent with time, expectation, and many inconueniences;
as want of pay, commotions, mutinies, encombrances
in a strange Country, feare of forraine people, mortalitie,
famine, and such like: yet as the affaires of the Kingdome
stood, all speed and an orderly festination was to be
put in practise, lest (like a ball of snow in a moist, cold, and
misty Country, which by often rowling groweth greater and
greater) they might augment their numbers with their rage
and madnesse, being so neere the Scots open enemies, and

in the north parts dissembling friends: Whereupon the
King remooued to Nottingham, and tooke a field neere vnto
a wood called Bowers, whither came vnto him the Lord
George Talbot Earle of Shrewsbury,
               The King with his army is ready to the encounter. the Lord S

                  range, Sr. Iohn
Cheny, and many other Commanders, with sufficient forces
and furniture, to encounter better men then heauy Almaines
and vnarmed Irish, and so the Kings army wonderfully encreased,
&amp; had the fulnesse of his subiects obedience, to his
great satisfaction, and the comfort of all the rest. For a
Prince can in nothing bee so well pleased, as in the loyalty,
loue, and obseruation of the subiect: nor the souldier contented,
as in the amity and full assurance of one another,
especially being all of a nation and language, to vnderstand
the wants of such as would be supplied, and be releeued with
the willingnesse of those which are ready to performe the
same.
            In this space, the Earle of Lincolne entred Yorke-shire by
easie iournies, for not ouerwearying his princely Nephew
vnaccustomed to trauell, and after his precize manner, hee
both commanded, that no violence should be offered to any
of the Inhabitants, &amp; commended all those, which repaired
vnto him, vsing such humility and affable demeanour, that
it wan the hearts of many as yet vnsettled, vnto him, and
strengthened the loue of such, as had already submitted
themselues. Notwithstanding, being much frustrated in his
expectation of many coadiutors, and failing in that sufficiency
which hee presumed vpon, hee began a little to entertaine
an ill companion to all noble designes, feare and mistrust;
casting vp an vntoward reckoning of his proceedings
in this manner: To retire backe againe, were to meet death
and destruction by a way which he looked not for: To goe
forward, hee was yet too weake, the King being so strong
and enabled, which irresolution made the Poet cry out:

                  Non satis est muris latebras quaesisse pauori?Lucan lib. 2.

multitude. For King Henry himselfe had, not two yeeres before

mightie armie, he absolutely determined to trie the fortune
of a battell,The Earle of Lincolne commeth forward to Newarck to meet the King. and encounter with his aduersaries, who not

               e them, in despight
of anie protraction, in what den or place soeuer, they meant
to obscure themselues: whereupon he marched from Yorke
to Newarck vpon Trent, presuming the King to bee two or
three daies iourney from him, and so he was sure not to lose
by the bargaine. But before hee came thither, King Henry
was in his bosome, as vnderstanding his egresse, regresse, and
progresses, which he vndertooke, and when he came there,
was ready to flie in his face. For hee settled himselfe the
night before the battell, approaching within three miles of
the contrary.
            The valiant and ouer-hardy Earle of Lincolne, nothing
terrified at the matter, but rather

And came forward apace: yet not in anie ouer-daring manner;
but vnstartled in his resolutions, retained his accustomed
grauity, and verie neere the Kings armie, at a village
called Stoke, quartred his forces, and tooke vp the field, with
resolution the next day,Stoke field. to call Fortune to the deciding of the
controuersie. The King likewise prepared himselfe, and only
acquainting the companie with matters of necessity, in an
equall and plaine field diuided the troops, and darraigned
the battalions.
            To tell you of any signes, wonders, prodegies, prophesies,
dreames, deuises, forewarnings, or portentous accidents,
making sometimes a cause either good or bad, would spend
time to lose time, and procure small thankes in the paines:
For the superstitious and ignorant would bee angrie, at the
opposition and repugnancy: and the truely religious offended
at the vanity and superfluity, as abhorring the participation
of diuine power to Men, Deuills, or Angells. To enlarge

my discourse concerning militarie proceedings, of entrenchings,
fortifications, encounters, diuisions of squadrons,
ordring the companies, &amp; setting forward the forces,
would preuent me from a fitter and more opportune occasion
heereafter. To discourse of the Captaines, the Souldiers
encouragements, the Earle of Lincolnes orations, the
Kings forcible and gracious speech, the intimation of the
imposture, and discouery of the treasons at large, were to
prolong the history without further profit, then a poore inuention,
which would questionlesse extenuate the worthinesse
of the businesse: therefore I desist from all extraneall
and superfluous discourses, and apply my selfe to a more succinct
enarration of the matter.
            When the field was fully and orderly agreed vpon,The armies ioyne. the
precize Earle, as if hee would amate the King with a kinde
of precedency, set forth the Vau
                  â€¢
               tguard of his armie, and
with a manly courage, onely animated the Souldiers, that
day to remember his honour, the Kings safety, and their
owne liues and liberties, and so gaue a signe to the battell,
whereat the Irish began their accustomed cry, or if you will
Lullal lullo, which neither affrighted nor troubled the English
on the contrary side, but ministred occasion rather to laugh
at. The Germanes perceiuing the skirmishes and violent
meetings of these warlike bodies, contrary to their vsuall
keeping of their stands and close fights, set vpon the Kings
Vauntguard, and as they were approoued and expert men
in many encounters, so did they for the time in all things, as
well as strength and policy could execute, equalling and answering
the English man to man, or battell to battell and for
the Generalls, had the Earle of Lincolne beene as nimble and
deliuer, as he was vigilant, valiant, and wary, he might well
haue paralleld the best of his aduersaries. But to decipher,
and truely to speake of Martin Swart, I shall much disable
his worthinesse and merit. For he was heroike in spirit,
strong in heart, and of great ability in body, expert, experienced,
and failing in nothing but his fortune: Eor when the
Irish, being most of them (as I sayd) vnarmed, were put by

their light manner of skirmishing a farre off, and charged
with strong horses on the Flancks, and as strong bodies of
pikes in the Front, to which you may adde the cunning of
the Kings artillery, and violence of the arrowes, which fell
downe like haile vpon these poore and naked soules, they
knew no way of resisting or retiring, but were subiect to a terrible
encounter and slaughter. And although they held out a
while, as long as an equall met man-hood protracted the
victory: yet were they so pressed and oppressed, that they
quickly yeelded, and shrunke vnder the stroakes of a mightier
arme. Againe, the Kings Foreward being full of companie
and well furnished, continually supplied with Wings
and Archers, &amp; wonderfully encouraged with the high deseruing
of the Commanders, at last brake the bodie of the
Almaines, and scattered their company with a lamentable
discomfiture: yet I must needes say, they were first more
terrified to see the Irish killed so confusedly, then exanimated
with their owne disasters.The King obtaineth the victory against the Rebells. What should I report? it is
with staggering troops and dispersed companies, as with a
man falling downe a paire of staires, who neuer leaues tumbling
till he come to the bottome: so these yeelded to the
fortune of a defeat without recouery, and onely met honor
in the way to a glorious death. Therfore I will stand the lesse
on descriptions. For neuer was a victorie so soon gotten, nor
a busines more quickly ended, many being slain, many taken
prisoners, many hurt, and few or none escaped: the cheefest
reason because the Lord Louell, the Earle of Lincolne, &amp; other

            The report was, that the Lord Louell tooke his horse, and

commanded, that none should kill or hurt the Earle of
Lincolne, that being brought vnto him, hee might discouer
the secrets of this mischeefe, and the viperous brood of false-hearted
subiects: but the souldiers would not permit it, lest
the sauing of his life might, by such detection endanger diuers
others, as good as himselfe, and so killed him by way of
anticipation.
            
            After this victory, the King would needes solemnize a

This the Bishops present durst neither deny, nor would willingly
approoue for feare of any diminution in their settled
ceremonies and glorious Cathedralls: but at this time the
Kings ardency preuailed, and he kneeled downe on the bare
ground in the open fields, and rendred thankes and praises
to God. Afterward, hee gaue order for the funeralls of the
dead, shedding teares himselfe in commiseration of so many
worthy men slaine for such an vniustifiable businesse, the
people yet vnmooued, and the souldiers not so much as
daunted, though they saw the bleeding carkasses and wounded
bodies, according to the saying,

               
                  Exemplo

Then he proceeded to the casting vp a new accounts of mercy
and forgiuenesse, proclaiming pardon to all, that would
penitently admit of the same, and to his eternall fame, not
onely gaue Lambert and the Priest their liues, but commanded,
that no man should abuse them with contumely and reproach,
as perceiuing the one (for his yeeres) vncapable of
the apprehension of treason, or flagicious circumstances
concerning the same: the other (for his orders &amp; profession)
to be a priuiledged person: yet most heroikly and wisely he
told him, that he which rolleth a stone vp a hill, may peraduenture
haue it fall vpon his own head, and he that looketh
too high in a dangerous entrenched ground, may fall into
the ditch. Notwithstanding, for his pennance he was committed
to perpetuall imprisonment: but Lambert admitted
into the palace, and from place to place, came at last to bee
one of his Maiesties Faulkoners. Last of all, he looked ioyfully
on his owne company, and in remuneration of their
loyalty and noble seruices, spred the mantle of honour ouer
diuers, and imparted seuerall rewards to the rest, according
to their places of eminency.
            This battell was fought on a Saturday the sixteenth of
Iune, 1489. and in the end of the second yeere of Henry the

hursts in peeces of it selfe, of which when she was aduertized,
and had cause sufficient of exclamation and repining against
her misfortune and disastrous preuention of her malice:
yet was she so farre from relaxation or pacifying her

Yea, she set vp such a loome out of her pestilent inuention,

that a man would thinke it impossible for a woman to contriue,
or prosecute: but that the old Poet hath so long agoe
told vs,

Yet for the time she deplored the miscarrying of the matter,
but was not ashamed to confesse, that she cared not by what
meanes King Henry might be debased.
            After this great mischeefe (like a peece of Ordnance ouercharged)
was thus broken in the fulnesse, and that with little
trouble, tumult, and expences, compared to many other
warres. The King (as you heard) returned thankes to the
Decider of all controuersies, and presently sent word to
London of his prosperity and aduenture, seeming sorry for
nothing, but the death of the Earle of Lincolne, assuring the
Duke of Bedford and Earle of Shrewsbury, that he delighted
in his humours, and had a determination to haue saued his
life, adding yet this by the way, that hee was amazed at nothing
more, then the audaciousnes of the man, that durst (so

Therfore it must needs be, that he presumed on further
suppliment, or some breakings out amongst themselues.
But seeing it hath pleased God, that we haue not onely escaped
this threatning storme of commotion and disturbance,
but also choaked with the dust of their owne dissention, the
interiour diuisions and conspiracies of the Kingdome: Let

            In this triumphant prosperity he returned to London, and
was as well welcommed to the people, as contented in himselfe,
and so ran forward in the race of all mundane felicitie
and maiesticall happinesse. But neither his owne wisdome,
the vigilancy of the Officers, the fidelity of his Nobles, the
policy of his Councellours, the loyalty of his subiects, nor
the whole regard of the Common wealth, could turne the
frame of heauen about, nor preuent his destiny, concerning
following mischeefes:
Nam fato prudentia minor:
That is to say, could put a scarlet cloth ouer the sting of that

but she must be tampering with the edge tooles of diuellish
despight, and beating on the annile of malicious calumniation,
or (if you will) conspiracy, hoping at one time or other,
to hammer out such a worke of disturbance, that neither the
King should be able to quench the flames, nor the Subiect
daring to disable the enterprize. Whereupon to preuent all
claimes, exceptions, and meanes of distrust, Some foure
yeeres after, she set vp another I doll of defiance, personating
Richard Plantaginet second sonne to King Edward the fourth
and Duke of Yorke,
               Another Richard the fourth supposed to be murthered with his brother
Prince Edward in the Tower, who (as it were) resuscitated

and followers, but exornated with certaine illustrations of

Fourthly, he enstructed the best of men, to consider

how to inueigle and incite this rusticall people to admit
of him, who besides their naturall inclination to rebellion,
and disorder, would now be glad of this new occasion

and businesse to reuenge the slaughter of their Countrymen:
And although it might seeme to reasonable men, and vnderstanding
apprehensions, that the vnhappy proceedings
of Lambert and his counterfet assoicat (the Priest I meane)
might haue beene a sufficient warning vnto them for euer
being taken againe in the net of such abuses, or entangled
with the snare of collusion: yet did he so demeane himselfe,
that he made these doubts the very ground of his acceptation:
For once againe insinuating with the houses of the Geraldines
and Butlers, he plaied the Orator with them, and as we
say, captare beneuolentiam, thus perswaded them to giue credit

the generality of my businesse, I hope you are not
vnacquainted with many instances of distressed Princes, flying
to one another for refuge and succor, when an ouerdaring
hand of a more mightier enemy hath suppressed them,
or cunning insinnuation spred abroad a mantell of more
forcible reasons to admit of his title in preuailing, rather
then to looke after the weakned estate of his wronged, and
abused Competitor. For so Ieroboam, and Hadad the Edomite
were entertained in the Court of Pharao, meerely from

for the defence of vertue, and propulsing of iniuries. As
for the ill successe of Lambert in personating my cozen the
Earle of Warwicke, and setting a foot that title, whereby
you may be terrified in heereafter prosecutions: Alas, I
confesse it was for my sake, and a meere deuise to sound the
foord of the troublesome streames of those times &amp; proceedings:
wherein, if my Vncle of Lincolne had any way thriued;
you must be assured, thogh they would not hazzard my person

of Clarence third son of our great Edward the third of England
and Heroos of his time: so that I hope this shall be no
barre or interception either to my interest, or your good
will, considering I am now come in person to offer vp my

was not a little reuiued with such a message, and supposed
himselfe exalted to heauen in being thus called to the familiarity
and acquaintance of Kings and Princes: so that comming
into France accordingly, he was roially accepted, and
after a Princely manner entertained, hauing a guard assigned
him, whereof the Lord of Congreshall was gouernour. Hither
also repaired vnto him, especially while he lay in Paris
Sir George Neuil the Bastard: Sir Iohn Tailer: Rowland Robinson,
and a hundred English Rebels: But alas all these were but

And when a peace was to be determined and concluded betweene
England and France, the French King quickly dismissed
the yong man and all his associats, vnder colour of
excuse, that he durst no longer protect him against his new
confederat and brother of England; but some others attending
vpon him, yeelded a more forcible reason for his departure,
that he himselfe suspected how King Charles would deliuer
him into the hands of the King of England: and therefore
he beguiled the Lord Congreshall, and fled from Paris
by night. But howsoeuer this may be disputed, and whether
he departed without the Kings consent, or no; he was
questionlesse deceiued in his expectation, and in a manne
                  â€¢
               
desperate of successe: so that loth to remaine amongst such

distrustfull enemies, hee quietly returned to his most assured
friend the Lady Margaret of Flanders, the master builder
of this worke.
            The Duches before he came,Perkin welcommed to Lady Margaret. thought euery hower from
his departure, a whole yeare, till his retorne: For to heare
how he proceeded, was a quiet to her thoughts, and to know
how fortune would deale with him a ioy to her heart, but to
see him a very rauishment: Yet when she vnderstood how
he was abiected and repudiated in the French Court, it could
not choose but be a great agony and amasement vnto her.
Notwithstanding, to preuent all suspition, she seemed at his
arriuall no lesse reuiued, then a mother is glad for the retourne
of her long absented sonne, or a person condemned,
for a pardon and restauration to his life and dignity: At his
first approach she receiued him with large embraces, and
hanging ouer his neck, seeming to shed teares of ioy and
comfort for his escape from many dangers and aduentures:
O dissembling and deceiuable hypocrisie! that euer a woman
should be the author of such diuellish deuises and hellish
proiects, and yet ouer-daube her mischieuous imaginations
with the sugred showes of loue, and regard of pitty
toward a Prince in distresse: but this made Hippolitus long a
goe cry out,

                     sti, &amp;c.
               
and this she had learned of her owne Phisitians,Eurip. Hippolitus Coronatus. who in administring
of bitter pils, had shewed her to roule them ouer
in some candide powder: and this we haue taught our selues
out of Gods one mouth, who in seuerall places of Scripture
hath puplished wherein a bad woman doth exceed all the
creatures of the World.
            After this extacy was past, she proceeded with a cunning
desire to haue him relate his first miraculous preseruation,
his after trauails and exploration of Countries, his next entertainement
in Ireland and France, and finally his resolution
to goe forward in his noble and necessary intendment for
his inheritance, and recouery of the Crowne of England:
               
wherein he proceeded so effectually, and orderly without
stammering or stuttering, that the whole company verily
belieued it, and such as were not present, the rather, induced
by the report of others, sorrowing for nothing, but that they
heard him not Vina Voce, and endeauouring what they could
to present their personall obedience vnto him: Whereupon
when she perceiued, how euery thing consorted to her owne
wishes, she assigned him a Guard of 50 persons in Murry
and Blue, and honoured him with a cloth of Estate, and denomination
of the White Rose and Prince of England.
            
            From thence forward the Nobilitie of Flaunders, and diuers
of England with all obsequious diligence attended him,
and from a reuerent estimation of his auncestors, performed
all the good offices, which belonged to the exornation of his
maiestie, and extention of their owne loues and dut

               es: so
that in a word, this Sinons horse entred the broken wals of
Troy, and feined inuention shadowed with the pretence of
verity and truth, preuailed with their credulitie, that they
adhibited the more faith and indubitate trust vnto it, supposing
verily he had been preserued by the wil and prouidence
of God, and so committed to the trust and custody of some
faithfull friend, either by King Edward or his mother, when
she was in Sanctuary: relying also on this impossibility, that
any Tyrant would so rebell against God, as infring the orders
of holy Church, and take him perforce from thence, as
yet the story manifesteth was to be done euen by the Cardinall
himselfe.
            By this time the same of this iuggled miracle was not only
blowne ouer Flanders and the Territories adiacent, but so
rumored in England,
               England strangely possessed with the humor of Perkin. by reason the present gouernment suppressed
all publique reports, libels, and writings, that in the

               er to bee quiet, till it were
vented out, and when it came to eruption, made the more

forcible and outragious noyse. For it was heere receiued, as
an infallible truth, and not onely beleeued of the better sort,
but entertained of the common people, who being more liberall
of audacious behauiour, and lesse fearefull to offend
God, began to confirme it with oathes, as a matter of truth,
which others but barely affirmed, as a report of vncertainty.
            Thus began trouble vpon trouble, and as the Spring putteth
forth the buds and blossomes like the messenger of
Summer, and pleasant times to ensue: So did this fantasticall
fable thus diuulged, prognosticate following calamity

                  â€¢
               nd consequent desolation. For after it was knowne, with
what honour he had beene entertained in Flanders, and reuerenced
in other places of Europe: there began sedition on
euery side in England, and no man was sure of his friend, the
times grew to such distraction. Some, that were fled to Sanctuaries
for great and hainous offences perpetrated, discharged
themselues, and went beyond the seas vnto him. Some,
that had confined themselues to priuiledged places for debts
and accounts, began to shew themselues vnder his support
and combination, then being safest, when the State is vnsafest.
Some, euen of the better sort, through rashnesse and

                  â€¢
               emerity, because they would bee counted factious and stirring,
drew apace vnto him. Some out of the nature of inconstancy,
or rather impression of melancholy, neuer to
be remooued from the opinion they haue once entertained,
beleeued verily, that this Perkin was the indubitate sonne of
Edward the fourth. Some, through simplicity and easinesse
of apprehension, without examining the probability and
likelihood of the matter, yeelded to any thing which was
told them. Some temporizers, to curry fauor in the change
of Princes, perswaded and solicited other to their opinions,
that so bringing many coadiutors, they might not onely be
reputed of strength and reputation in their countries, but
the better welcommed and entertained with the preuailer.
Some, through indignation and enuy, murmuring at their
slender aduancement, or grudging they were not more condignely
rewarded, for their former paines and aduentures in

his Maiesties businesse, resorted to this new Prince, in hope
of better acceptation. And some ouerwearied with e
                  â€¢
               se and
placability of idlenesse, greeuing to see the world stand at a

                  â€¢
               
and seditious conspiracy:
O tempora! Ã´ mores! Ã´ flagitiosa voluntas!
            
            But for all this rumour of this twice borne Duke Richard
of Yorke, and that England was diuided, and drawne into
parts taking, and seuerall factions: so that the minds of men
were vexed, either with the hope of gaine, or preferment: or
feare of losse and confusion: Yet was the King and his Councell
not much disturbed or affrighted, more then their maruell
and modest anger at so many persons, seeming in their
right wits to be seduced, either in the contriuing such a manifest
and notorious lie, or assenting and preparing themselues
to countenance the same without feare of God or
men, not once forecasting the dangerous penalty of treasons,
contempts, conspiracies, and practises against their naturall
Prince, and so sufficient a Gouernour. For it was not
onely a pernicious fable and fiction, strange and maruellous;
but prodigious and vnnaturall to resussitate a ma

                from
the dead, and with impudent asseueration to set it forth, and
palliate it with the vesture and garment of a professed verity.
But in such cases, be Kings ueuer so wise, nor matters so triuiall
and vnlikely, there is no sitting still, nor giuing way to
the businesse, especially there is no rebating an enemy with
proclamations, writings, and prohibitions, who commeth
forward with the clamors of war, &amp; well settled prep
                  â€¢
               ration
of offence. Therfore his Maiesty thought it the best course,
to looke about him, and both by force and policy to preuent
the mischeefe impending and threatned. For hee perceiued,
how already the fire of rebellion had taken hold of
some of the principall houses of England, whom hee knew
had vnderhand already sent messengers vnto Lady Margaret,
to vnderstand when Richard Duke of Yorke would come
conueniently into England, that they might be ready to help
and succour him, euen at his first arriuall.
            
               This businesse encreased to a fulnesse and ripenesse,Sr. Robert Clifford sent to Perkin. about
the eighth yeere of his Maiesties raigne, insomuch that the
confederates (by common assent &amp; agreement) posted ouer
Sr. Robert Clifford Knight, and William Barley into Flanders,
to be the better assured of all particulars: who were not only
gladly accepted, and louingly welcommed of the Duches,
with full intimation of the truth, and wonderfull deliuery of
strangenesse of the story.

letters of confidence &amp; credit to his associates in England, that
as the Queene of Saba told Salomon, she did not beleeue the
halfe of that which was reported, till shee had seene it with
her eyes: So he could not bee perswaded to so much, as rumour
had preferred, till he had ouerveiwed him in person:
But when these letters were receiued in England, the conspiratours
caused them to be openly published and diuulged in
many places, with full credence, that it was true and not fained,
which was spoken by the Duke of Yorke, and therefore
they neede not be afraid to be drawne to such a commotion,
and parts taking: all yet was carried so orderly and couertly,
that the King more then vncertaine suspition, could not
as yet detect any person of name or quality, which troubled
him so much the more.

and affaires: Then hee sent downe the Lieutenants and lustices
into their seuerall countries to detaine the people in
obedience, and muster the forces of the same, as occasion
should serue. Which order obserued, he vnderhand authorized

propagated, promising princely rewards to such persons, as
could relate the truth, and (as a man may say) enucleate the
secret. Besides, hee wrote louing letters to certaine trusty
friends, concerning the same; who to doe their Prince and
Countrey seruice, dispersed themselues into seuerall townes
and cities both of France and Burgundy, where they were
certified and assured by the testimony of many honest persons
(amongst whom some of especiall wit and behauiour
repaired to the towne of Tourney) that this fained Duke was
of meane parentage, and truly named Peter Warbeck, which
was principally confirmed by one Nathani

                  l Osbeck of his
owne kinred, who as it should seeme in hope of reward,
tooke vpon him more then the rest, and exprobrated him
for so countersetting, with this taunt out of the Poet:

                  Lumine qui semper proditur ipse suo?
               
And alas, howeuer he is now transhaped into a princely garb
and fashion, we of Peter named him Perkin, for his effeminatenesse
and childisnnesse.
            With this newes and man, the inquisitours returned into
England, and made a true report vnto his Maiesty of all that
euer they knew and heard, both concerning the assumpted

presumption and impudency of the counterfet, as also the
proceedings and purposes of all the conspiratours, which
was seconded by the faithful letters of especial persons, who
had larger commission to make their commorance the longer
out of England: when the King was thus satisfied, and (as
he supposed) to all seeming reasonable vnderstanding, had
openly and apparantly manifested it, heresolued to haue it
further published and declared, by open proclamations and
sound of trumpet, both in the Realmes of England and
Ireland, and in the courts of forraine Princes: for which
purpose he sent ouer diuers Embassadours to many Countries,
especially to Philip Arch-Duke of Burgoine,
               Embasie to the Arch-Duke. and his
Councellours, as a place which neerest concerned him. This
Embasie was the charge and commission of Sr. Ed. Poinings,
a most valiant Gentleman; and William Warrham Doctor of
the lawes, a man of great modesty, learning and grauity.
The generall poynts of their commission had large fields to
walke in, but the principall matters to be enforced had these
limitations.
            FIrst, to declare that the young man resident amongst
them with the Lady Margaret, was descended of a base
and obscure parentage, hauing falsly and vntruly vsurped
the name of Richard Duke of Yorke, who long before was
murthered in the Tower with his brother the Prince, by the
commandement of King Richard their vncle, as many men
liuing can testifie.
            Secondly, that from the probability of the matter and enforcement
of reason, there was no likelihood, that King Richard
dispossessing the Prince both of his life and Kingdom,
would leaue the other brother stil to affright him, and trouble
him in his gouernment.
            Thirdly, that Queene Elizabeth their mother, was therefore
attainted in Parliament, for surrendring her daughters
into the Tyrants custody, and committing them into his
hands, who, she knew, had already murthered their brethren.
            Fourthly, to desire the Arch-Duke, and the principall

Lords of his Councell, not to giue any credit to such illusions,
nor suffer themselues to bee any more blinded or seduced
with impostures, or shadowing appearances of truth.
            Last of all, to remember how King Henry had (some few
yeeres since) succoured and releeued Maximilian their principall
Lord, almost oppressed and ouercome with the forraine
hostility of the French King, and intestine rebellion of
his owne subiects, and therefore it must be vnprincely, and
a poynt of great ingratitude, either directly or indirectly, to
abett or maintaine any traytour, or trayterous practises against
him, or the peace and tranquility of his Kingdome.
            With these instructions the Embassadours failed into
Flanders, and were gently receiued, and honourably welcommed
by the Arch-Duke and his Councell, as appeared
by the solemnity of their audience, and quicke dispatch of
their businesse: wherein Doctor William Warrham in a well
penned oration declared the Kings minde, as before you
heard, and by the way touched the malice of Lady Margaret,
saying with the Poet,
â€”TantaenÃ¨ animis coele stibus irae:
And vnder a kinde of reprehension, rebuked her inficious
disposition against a Prince of so great worth and deseruing,
that neuer wronged her, nor entertained a preiudiciall motiue,
to inflict either her or hers with any malignant iniury;
wherin she only might be compared to a weak breath, which
spitting against a forcible winde, had it returned b
                  â€¢
               cke againe
into her face, adding withall somewhat vehemently,
that in her olde age, contrary to the nature of all births, shee
had brought forth two such detestable monsters, that is to
say, Lambert before disputed vpon, and now this Peter, that
the like was neuer heard of. And whereas, in the conception
of children, women were commonly deliuered in eight
or nine moneths, as nature did require, she could not be released
in eight or nine yeeres; nay, the youngest was fifteen
yeeres old, before her threnes were passed, and they iustified
to be shewed openly, and this was not sufficient neither,

but they must bee at least extracted of Princes, and able to
giue Kings battell in the open field: whereupon hee might
well conclude with that ancient Poet:

                  Sedres excellens est,Eurip. Andromache. contra reptiles bestias
                  Remedia mortalibus deorum prebuisse aliquem,
                  Quae viperas &amp; ignem superant:
                  Sed nullus contra mulierem remedia inuenit adhuc
                  Malam: huiusmodi sumus hominibus malum.
               
            
            This oration so effectually deliuered, and in the publique
assembly audaciously maintained, did not so much trouble
and vex the Duches, as aff
                  â€¢
               ight and dishearten poore Perkin,
who in a manner exanimated, lest his fraud and pestilentiall
enterprizes should not onely bee discouered, but discouraged,
began to be somewhat appaled, and by a fearefull countenance
seemed to discountenance both his honor and the
action, had not the Duches taken the cause in hand with a
more vndaunted courage, and like a true Virago raised her
spirits to a higher pitch of reuenge, thus resuscitating her
darling, and answering the Doctor.
            MY Lords Embassadors of England:
               The Duches answer to Doctor Warrham oran
                     â€¢
                  tion. For the dignity of
princelines commandeth no lesse, &amp; awfull regard of
Maiesty combineth me to such obseruation: Besides, I am
no way offended with your persons, but your message, wherin
I know the Oratour hath much transcended his bounds,
but speaking for his fee, and doing another mans errand, he
is the more pardonable, and therefore as neere as I can re
               
                  â€¢
               ember,
I will answer succinctly to euery point deliuered.
            First, whereas you impeach the miraculous and wonderfull
preseruation of this Prince. In which yet my credit and
knowledge of the truth, shall be of sufficiency to answer all
other obiections and intercedings, I cannot blame you, nor
him that set you on worke; For he well knowes that sonnes

                  â€¢
               re to bee preferred before daughters, and ashamed of the

                  â€¢
               reachery of his ancestours, he would put off the blame by
a tricke of policy in laying as great faults on the shoulders of
his aduersary, I meane my brother Richard, whose tyranny

and obdurate heart hath onely wrought this relenting in me,
that say &amp; do what England can, I will be now the Protectrix
of this euery way distressed Prince, and so to conclude this
poynt, assure your King,
Permanet in voto mens mea firma suo.
            
            Secondly, whereas you inferre the improbability and
vnlikelihood of sauing the Prince, being in a Tyrants custody,
and determining to murther the King himselfe, I answer
in a word: I am of your minde, if euer he had come into his
hands: But it is well knowne, that the Cardinall himselfe
was deceiued, and the childe conuayed away, in despight of
the maleuolent practises of so cruell an Homicide. Yet say
it had not beene so, I hope eldest brothers daughters are preferred
before a yonger brothers claime; and hee had fiue
Princesses, besides my Nephew Warwicke, to wrastle wi
                  â€¢
               hall,
before he could goe out of the lists with his owne triumphs.
Therefore it was not the feare of him, that did accelerate his
murther, as you suppose; but his resolution to bee King, in
despight of Heauen and Hell.
            Thirdly, concerning the dispossessing of the Queene their
mother by your Parliament, I am ashamed of your asseueration,
that euer man, and such a man, whom (as you say) the
Heauens protected, should bee attainted of inhumanity, to
thinke a woman might not bee affrighted with a Tyrant,
when hee himselfe ranne into euery corner from his reaches.
But say there had beene a fault perpetrated (through the
timidity of her sex and tendernesse of her widdow-hood)
would any man marry the daughter, and hate or distresse
the poore mother, in whose behalfe I may well say with
Ariadne to Theseus,
               
                  â€”Sinon ego causasalutis:O
                           â€¢
                        id. Epist.
                  
                  No

                      tamen est, cur tu fis mihi causa necis?
               
And therefore if there were no more then to reuenge her
quarrell, I will bee an enemy to Lancaster, while I liue, and
am no further mooued with your vnseasonable oratory then
afraid of his menaces.
            Fourthly, whereas you would insinuate with our Nobles

and trusty friends to desist from my allegiance, and a
                  â€¢â€¢
               
               sting
my Nephew in his lawfull claime: you thinke belike
we are as perfidious as your selues, that seeme glad of Treason
and turmoiles vpon the very sound of innouation: yea,
the least aduantage or disaduantage will cause you leaue
your Prince in the midst of his enemies.
            Fiftly, concerning your exprobration of Maximilian for
ingratitude, and not coadiuting your King in his petty reuenges
vpon France: First, his great dessignes are not to be
compared to your triuiall businesse, and hauing matters of
high consequence else-where, he could not leaue them to attend
your weaker importunities: Secondly, he well knew it
was but a folly to assist you in any businesse of France; for as
fas
                  â€¢
                as you got it one way, you would loose it another, so that
you cannot now show any Town or Fort, either of King Edwards
conquests, or Henry the fifts enterprises except Calice,
which lying so neere you, you cannot for shame but defend:
And thirdly, in my conscience he tooke pitty of you, knowing
you had a warre at home to attend, and so were not able
to prosecute both encounters at once: goe back therefore
and tell your politike Prince, that whereas words are but
womens weapons to his imagination, we determine to arme
our selues, and this Prince by Gods assistance: and my power
shall bid him base in his owne Kingdome with speare and
shield, and make an equall combat the decider of both their
Titles.
            Last of all concerning your inuectiue against women; alas,
I smile at your schollership, and am ashamed at your poore
discretion in adapting some poeticall inuention out of fury
or despight, to your present purposes, when both the same
man, and all others of the same condition are as forward to
commend as dispraise vs: For to answere your worne out
and threed bare Tragedian, hearke what our Diuine Petrarch

            With which words she arose, and carried away Perkin with
such state and maiestie, that Sir Edward Poinings, though he
were euery way inuincible for his courage, and a knowne
man for wonderfull and seuerall exploits, yet seemed amazed
at her Heroicall speech, and delicat manner of obstinacy.
            Notwithstanding, the Emb
                  â€¢
               ssadors and Councell of Estate
often met, and after long debating the matter, somewhat
to pacifie the King of England for many reciprocall
gratuities and benefits receiued, they concluded, that the
Arch-duke should neither aide nor assist Perkin nor his
complices in any cause, or quarrell whatsoeuer against the
maiesty of England. Only, if the Duches continued in her
obduratnesse, and would not desist from her feminine rages,
and terrible prosecutions, they were not to oppose against
her, nor was it in their power to let or withstand it: For, she
was an absolute gouernour in her owne territories, and the
seignories and lands assigned for her dower, were of sufficiency
to suffulciat her enterprises without their contradiction
or restraint.
            When this answere was giuen,The Embassador returne into England. they returned againe into
England with a true relation of all occurrences as they chanced,
and circumstances impending: whereupon King Henry
both politike and charitable (for of all other things he desired,
if it were possible, to auoid effusion of blood and hazzardous
danger of battaile, supposing that was the last remedy
of curing diseased Common-wealths, as Surgeons
doe to festered sores) contriued another worke, which although
it was branded by some with the character of traiterous
intelligences, yet it serued his turne for the present:
and so diuers were appointed to discouer the secrets of the
contrary by feigned dissimulation. Of these were two sorts,
one to feigne themselues Yorkists, and so learne out what they
could preiudiciall to King He

Sir Robert Clifford and William Burley for their returne to the
obedience of the King: and concerning the Plot it selfe, he
reputed it iustifiable as authorised by all Authors, ages, and
Common-wealthes, who set downe in their politique discourses,

perswaded (though with much adoe) Sir Robert Clifford to
desist from this foolish and dangerous collusion, which had
neither sure ground nor foundation to stay it selfe vpon: but
Master Barley could not be diuerted at this instant, till within
two yeares after almost tired out with expectation after

                  ter Warbecks fortunes and successe, he returned of himselfe
to the King, and had pardon both for life and liberty.
The others likewise proceeded so effectuaily, that they had
sure notice of especiall persons confederate, and adiured to
this blinde and foolish proiect; of which they presently enformed
the King, who by that means could not only personally
name his home enemies, but to preuent the worst,
did as personally attach the most principall: that is to say,
Sir Iohn Ratcliffe, the Lord Fitzwater, Sir Simon Mountford,
Sir Thomas Thwaits, William Dawbney, Robert Clifford, Thomas
Cressenor, and Thomas Astwood: with these were diuers
religious persons imprisoned, as William Rochford Doctor of
Diuiuitie, and Thomas Poines both Friers Dominicks,
Doctor William Sutton, William Worsley Deane of Paules, Robert

                  ford, Sir Robert Ratcliffe,
and William Dawbney were beheaded, as powerfull, factious,
and chiefe authors of the conspiracie: the rest were pardoned,
especially the Priests, who were in those times for their
orders sake sequestred from publique executions, what offences
soeuer they perpetrated, which made them so forward

in all facinorous actions; and others so superstitious, as to
beleeue any thing they either proiected, or attempted, from
which hypocriticall and deceiuable manner of life, all Poets
and Philosophers themselues haue had both generall and

                smarted
through the pride, couetousnesse and malicious wickednesse
of Priests and Fryars, and lastly Iesuites, as I said before:
But to our Story.
            Although the Lord F
                     â€¢â€¢
                  zwater was pardoned his life for
the present: yet comming after to Calice he was beheaded
for attempting to escape by corrupting his keepers, and so to
goe to Perkin: whereby this strange and intricate worke so
busied his Maiesty, that he would often compare it to the
conquering of Hydra, a beast so priuiledged by nature, that
as one head was struck off, seuen others grew in the place.
For his turmoiles both at home and abroad encreased, and
he seemed as much tormented with the suspition of bosome
friends, as affrightings of forraine enemies, which so exasperated
him, that as he supposed to preuent the worst, considering
Maximilian King of the Romans had ieofaild with him
in his wars against France and that Lady Margaret with the
Flemings had supported Perkin Warbeck against him, he in a
kind of re
                  â€¢â€¢
               nge banished all Low-Countrie men, and their
commodities out of the Realme, with restraining the Merchant
from hauing accesse into any of their Cities: But
alas this was to no purpose, and in truth rather a custome
of anger, then secret of policie, as if a man because his finger
torments him, should cut off his hand to ease himselfe:
for they did the like by vs, whereby the Mart being kept at
Calice, and no vent else-where for our Marchandize, many
poore house-keepers complained for want of worke, many
rich men murmured and were compelled to lessen their families,

and abate their retinue, many Merchants felt the
losse, and the Trades-man cried out-right, because the
Esterlings brought all manner of manuall worke ready made
into the Land,A riot 
                     ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰
                   the Esterlings. and tooke from them both their labour and
customers, whereby a riot was made vpon them at the Stilyard,
and the Maior of London with the principall Officers
had much adoe to appease the tumult, and this was the ninth
yeares disturbance.
            The King thus turmoiled euery way, repaired for diuers
reasons to the Tower of London, whither shortly after came
Sir Robert Clifford vnto him, partly trusting to the Kings
promise, partly mistrusting his owne company and Perkins
weakenesse: But the chiefest polecie of his resiance in the
Tower was to secure himselfe, and lay hold of all others suspected,
or accused in this conspiracy, who thither resorting
to the Councell, might with ease and without any tumult be
committed to prison, as it presently fell out: For after the
King had admitted Sir Robert, and insinuated with him in
excellent positions of Diuinity, and morality by way of disceptation,
vrging the loue and fauour of his Prince in his
true obedience and reconciliation, he not only related the
manner of Perkins proceedings, but on his knees with teare
                  â€¢
               
in his eies discouered the matter to be weake and impossible,
if it had not factious supportation from some of powerfull
houses of England, and very neere his Maiesties person,
whereof though many were punished, and the rest dissipated
and diuided: Yet Sir William Stanley remained vnsuspected,
and his heart trembled to accuse him: But when the
King heard Sir William Stanley named,Sir William Stanley accused. he started back amazed
and in a manner confounded, that Sir Robert was affraid
he had done him more harme in the relation, then good in
the detection.
            At last he burst out, what my bosome friend? my Councellor?
my Chamberlaine? then I see there is no trust in men,
nor as the Psalmist saith confidence in Princes: For as we shal
not want instruments to goe forward with what enterprise we
please, as Dauid had his Ioab: so shall we not lack enemies

let them be neuer so carefull and desirous to fauour the least
deseruer, but I may well now cry out, Heu cadit in qu
                     â€¢
                  nquam
tantum scelus! and with the kingly Prophet exclaime, It was
not mine enemies abroad, but my companions, and such as
eate at my table betraied me: What Sir William Stanley? he
hath the gouernment of my Chamber, the charge and controlment
of all that are next my person, the loue and fauour
of our Court, and the very keyes of our treasurie. He made
me a conquerour in the field, and by his hand I scourged tyrannie
out of his Throne, therefore it is impossible, and I
cannot belieue it. But when a second reply brought him to
the sight of fairer particulars, and that he saw the smoake,
though it was but a smother, came from some fire, he quickly
recollected his spirits, and with these verses of Euripides,
set himselfe downe at the table of preuention and reposednesse:

                  Ex amicis autem alios quidem non certos video amicos
                  Qui vero sunt rectÃ¨,Eurip. Herefu

                        . impotentÃ¨s sunt vt iuuent:

                        que
                      vel mediocriter amicus mini)
                  Assequatur amicorum examen certissimum,â€”
               
The same night vpon better consideration my Lord Chamberlaine
was restrained from his liberty within the quadrant
Tower, and confined to his owne Chamber for a season:
but when the crime was openly prooued, and the Councell
had as it were with a charming hand of Hecate turned his inside
outward, and found all his excuses to consist in distinctions,
and his reasons of defence manifest astipulations of the
matter, he grew out of all patience, and knew not what to
say, or to doe: For one way like an Noble Prince commiserating
his subiects, he feared lest his brother Lord Thomas
Stanley the life of his first roialty, as a man should say take it
grieuously. Another way he misdoubted, lest in remitting
the fault, some other might abuse his lenity and mercy, and
be the bolder to runne forward in the dangerous courses of
further treasons: At last by the aduise of his Councell, and
generall vouge of the Court, seuerity (considering the perill

of those daies) tooke place,Sir William Stanley beheaded. and mercy was put backe: so
that after a solemne arraignment, he had iudgement to dye,
and accordingly was brought on the 16. of February to Tower-hill,
and had his head struck off.
            The principall point of his enditement consisted in this,
that Sir William Stanley sware and affirmed, that he would
neuer fight nor beare Armor against the yong man Peter
Warbeck, if he knew of a truth that he was the indubitate
sonne of Edward the fourth, whereupon arose a coniecturall
proofe, that he bare no good will to King Henry. Again,
the principall motiue of his distasting and murmuring at the
King, was for being denied the Earledome of Chester, when
his brother Lord Thomas was inuested with the sword of
Derby: yet the King besides many rewards, &amp; other great offices
made him his chiefe Chamberlaine; what should I say? it
should seem ambition had blinded his eies, &amp; peruerted his
iudgement. For he still thought on the benefits which the
King receiued from the loue and seruice of his family, neuer
remembring the compensation and gratuities returned back
againe to him selfe, supposing that his vessell of oile should
still be filled to the brims, or else he harped on a Machiuilian
position, thankfulnesse is a burthen, but reuenge is sweete
and reckned as gaine. But it should seeme, that in possessing
King Richards treasure at the conquest of Bosworth field,
which King Henry franckly bestowed vpon him, and the
command ouer the people in the Country, he grew proud
and elated, and so vilepended the King: or from a continual
melancholy reuerberating mislike and hate vpon his staggering
conceits, he more and more ouer burthened his heart
with rage and despight, which as you haue heard vnpurged,
vented out those words of disloialtie to the losse of his life;
or in a word according to that of our old Tragedian:
               Animorum Iupiter vindex est minis superborum,Eurip, Heraclida.
               
the searcher of heart
                  â€¢
                was weary of his tumors and ingratitude,
and so tooke the Kings cause in hand and vpon good
inforcement thrust him into the house of destruction. Otherwise,
he could not choose but remember, how not twentie

yeare before the Law had interpreted the profuse and lauish
speeches of a Grocer named Waker, dwelling at the
signe of the Crowne in Cheapside, who bad his sonne learne
apace, and he would make him heire of the Crowne, meaning
his house he dwelt in, for which he was adiudged to
die: nor forget the Story of Burdet the Esquier, within whose
Parke King Edward hunting, a white tame Hart was kild by
chance, which he had brought vp by hand, which when Burdet
heard of, he wished the hornes in his belly that had moued
the king to come first thither, for which he was drawne,
hanged and quartered. Thus you see there is no iesting with
Princes, nor distasting them in troublesome times, nor presuming
in such cases on their clemency: For our Ouid tels vs:

                  Non ideo debet pelago se credere, si qua
                  audet in exiguo ludere cimba lacu:
               
            
            After this, many rumors and libels, yea defamatory speeches
both concerning the landing of the new Duke of
Yorke proclaimed all ready in Ireland, Richard the fourth:
and the Kings present feare and proceedings, were spread
abroad, which compelled as strange prohibitions, yea,
punishments and reuenges, according to the example of
that iudgement,Libel. 
                     â€¢
                  rs hanged. that hanged Collingbroke for a rime against
the vsurper:

                  The Rat, the Cat, and Louel the Dog,
                  Rules all England vnder a Hog:
               
so that he was farther enforced to haue many politike
searches through the whole Realme for such offenders,
and as many strong Guards and Watches for the defence
of the whole Kingdome, by which when he perceiued
the care, vigilancie and good will of the Subiect,
he entertained a greater fulnesse of contentment, and
shewed a better alacrity of spirit then his former griefes
would remit: Then he aduanced Giles Lord Dawbuy
a man of wisedome, experience and fidelitie, to be the
Chamberlaine of his house, and haue the Guard of his
person. Afterwards he tooke order with the Citie and
Merchants of the same, and had thei
                  â€¢
                faithfull Oath

and protestation to looke to it, and all the places of their
traffique abroad, concerning such things as might be offensiue
and preiudiciall to the Kingdome. The next thing hee
tooke care for, was the manning of the Cinqueports, and
fortifying diuers hauens, with a stict commanding the Lieutenants
&amp; Iustices of each Shire, to repaire into their Countries,
by which good order obserued, he grew somewhat secure
and bolder, to shew himselfe in publique assemblies vndaunted,
or any way discomfited.
            But this was yet farre from the fulnesse of his establishment,
as long as Ireland remained corrupted, and swelled
againe in euery place,Speciall Commissioners sent into Ireland. with the ouerblowen reports and rumours
of Perkins royalty, to which each trayterous eare lay
open, and abused heart went quite away with the nouelty.
Whereupon hee resolued on the necessity of purging and
cleansing the same, and determined to performe it by new
Officers and honest Surueyors: So hee sent thither with
powerfull authority, Henry Deane late Abbot of Langhton to
be his Chancellour, and Sr. Ed. Poinings (with a sufficient preparation)
to bee Lord Generall of his army. These had a
large Commission, vnder his Deputy the Earle of Kildare,
to suppresse all innouations, and spare no offenders: For it
was such a time, that mercy and fauour would rather embolden
men to abuses, then lustice offend with extremity. Besides,
the Maiesty of Kings was not to be controlled, either
in their fauour or reuenges, but they would simply command,
and haue the subiect honestly to obey, with which
instructions and the doctrine of Probity out of our ancient
author,

                  Probi enim viri officium est, &amp; Iustitiae i

                      semper:
               
They arriued in Ireland, and disposed of themselues accordingly.
            Now because the countrey was already infected with a
superstitious credulity of the preseruation of one of the sons
of Edward the fourth, and that the barbarous Irish once beleeuing
a thing, would neuer bee diuerted by reason or perswasion,

they proceeded the more cautelously and circumspectly
in their businesse. First, assembling the Nobility and
better sort before the new Chancellour, who with all attractiue
demeanour and elocution, perswaded them not onely
to persist in obedience to the King, and loyalty to the gouernment,
but to aide and assist his Maiesties forces vnder
Sr. Ed. Poinings, with their power, strength, and ability, especially
against such rebells, as rather through factious malice
and wilfull reuolts, then blindnesse of errour or folly had
adhered vnto Perkin, or any of his associates, in which they
knew there was reason and sufficiency of enforcement. For
amongst themselues, the petty Lords would endure no competition
of soueraignty, and their Law-Tanist established
him, that for his heroike actions deserued to bee honoured,
and by his worthy endeauors obtained the jurisdiction and
inheritance. So that their owne Priests could tell them, Ex
paruis magna comparantur, and if it were so in petty gouernments,
what was it in mighty Monarchies and with regardable
Kings, amongst whom:

                  Impatiens consortis erat:â€”
               
Therefore to auoyde the imputation of treason, and the
fearefulnesse of reuenge, from a Princes incensed indignation,
hee aduised them to a tenacity and strong continuance
in their loyalty.
            To this their answer was, as souldiers in a camp after a
mutiny, sad lookes and small repentance: faire words, but
little performance. For they all promised assurance off aith,
but no man determined the due performance, onely the
better sort, or (if you will) such as dwelled within the English
pale, or had beene enobled or enabled by the Prince, to liue
in richer forme and eminence then others: answered directly,
they would acknowledge no King but Henry, nor supreame
Lord, but such as should be extracted from the vnion
of the mariage betweene the two Roses, and to this they
were the rather emboldned, because the Earle of Kildire being
Deputy, seemed to maintaine their submission, and iustifie

their intents: so that Sr. Ed. Poinings had little to say at
that time, more then hee hoped in the confidence of their
promises, and relied on their worthy integrity: yet I dare
sweare, if hee had beene examined on his conscience, and
brought to the barre of discouery for his thoughts, he would
haue cried out with the Poet:

                  At paucos,Lucan lib. 5. quibus haec rabies aucthoribus arsit,
                  Non Caesar, sed Poena tenet: &amp;c.â€”
               
            
            Whereupon hee prepared all his forces against the wilde
Irish, to whom, as hee was enformed, diuers of the rest had
fled for succour. I could heere enlarge this discourse with a
topographicall description of the countrey, and conditions
of the people, because I haue personally ouerlooked their
actions, and beene a passenger euen from one side of the
countrey to the other, but the times are full of the experience
of many men, and diuers explorations haue discouered the
vnswept corners of this sauage and superstitious people,
whom neuer man shall see ciuill or once affecting the handsomnesse
and wealth of the other parts of Europe, till either
it grow more populous, or the King be as willing as hee is able,
to extirpate (as it were by the roots) the Bards, Rimers,
Harpers and Priests, that hang vpon them, and sticke close
vnto them, as some deformed wen in a straight growing tree,
or (if you will) venemous cankour, which will in time either
eat out root and rinde, or (for the time) disfigure and disproportion
the proudest comelinesse of the best Cedars in the
forrest. But to our story.
            Sr. Edward Poinings,
               The North of Ireland. according to his commission, marched
into the North: But alas, hee neither found France to
trauell in, nor French-men to fight withall? Heere were no
glorious townes to load the Souldiers home with spoiles,
nor pleasant vine-yards to refresh them with wine. Heere
were no plentifull markets to supply the salary of the army,
if they wanted or stood in neede, Heere were no cities of refuge,
nor places of garrison to retire vnto in the times of
danger and extremity of weather. Heere were no musters
ordered, nor Lieutenants of shires to raise new armies: heere

was no suppliment either of men or prouisions, especially of
Irish against the Irish, nor any one promise kept according
to his expectation. Heere was (in plaine termes) boggs and
woods to lie in, foggs and mists to trouble you, grasse and
ferne to welcome your horses, and corrupt and putrifie your
bodies: heere was killing of kine, and eating fresh beefe to
breed diseases: heere was oats without bread, and fire without
wood: heere were smoking cabins, and nasty holes:
heere were boggs on the tops of mountaines, and few passages,
but ouer marishes, or through strange paces: heere was
retiring into fastnesse and glins, and no fighting but when
they pleased themselues: heere was ground enough to bury
your people in being dead, but no place to please them
while they were aliue: heere you might spend what
you brought with you, but be assured th
                  â€¢
               re was no hope of
releefe: here was roome for all your losses, but scarse a castle
to reserue your spoiles and treasure. To conclude, heere was
all glory &amp; vertue buried in obscurity &amp; obliuion, &amp; not so
much as a glimmering of hope, that how valiantly soeuer a
man demeaned himselfe, it should be registred and remembred:
which makes me consider, what that worthy Politician
writes of the Sweuians and Heluetians in those dayes, and apply
them to these times and people:

            Whereupon the worthy Generall, with his other Captaines,
began to complaine, but knew no way of redresse, his
men died, the Souldiers were slaine, the army decayed, the
Irish insulted, the auxiliaries failed, and not a man which
promised assistance, came in to help him: so that he was enraged
at the perfidiousnesse, and compelled to retire to Dublin,
all exasperated to despight, by which hee aimeth at the

highest in his displeasure, laying the fault and blame of his
preposterous proceedings on Gerald Earle of Kildare,
               The Earle of Kildare accused by Sr. Edward Poinings. his
Maiesties principall Deputy, who remembring his owne
greatnesse, could not confine it within a little circuit of patience;
but answered this our Captaine somewhat like himselfe,
that he was as loyall to the King as he, as seruiceable as
he, as louing to his countrey and crowne of England as hee,
and so defied him to his face, which added only fuell to the
former fire, that the vndaunted Souldier apprehended and
attached him of high treason, which seemed an vnsufferable
peece of businesse, and had it not beene within Dublin, or
some principall place vnder the English command, an Herculean
and intricate Labour. But thus is this great Earle vnder
arrest, and without any more adoe carried into England
to answer the matter.
            But when he came before the King and Councell to bee
examined of treason, and matters laid to his charge, eyther
his innocencie was a Perseus shield against this Gorgons
head of calumniation, or his wit and delicate iudgement
brought him out of the labyrinth of those troubles, or the
times afford

King had other matters to thinke vpon, or indeed it was no
pollecie to rub these new soares with rude hands, according
to the rule
Horrent admotas vulnera cruda manus:
For hee was quietly dismissed, thanked, rewarded, and of
Deputie made Lieutenant, and so sent backe againe, vpon
the engaging of his hononr to withstand the landing of Perkin,
if euer he came into Ireland.
            By this occasion the King was without feare of battaile,
and determined his progresse about Midsommer to visit his
mother, lying at Latham in Lancashire, still wife to the earle
of Derbie: But as he was preparing his iourney,The King progresse intercepted vpon report of Perkins lan

                  ding. newes came
of Perkins landing in England, which a while diuerted him,
and enforced his retardance from his first determination:
For in truth, when the Duches of Burgundie had notice of
all the Kings proceedings both in England and Ireland, and

that the principall offenders were condemned, and executed,
and confederats dissipated, and ouerwatched: shee
found too late her owne slacknesse, and the first misfortune
of the King of France his retractions, from assisting the
Prince: For whether I name Peter, or Perkinâ–ª
                or Warbeck,
or Prince, or Richard Duke of Yorke, or Richard the fourth,
all is one man, and all had one end. And questionlesse, if
at his first repairing into Ireland, hee had made for England,
while that rumour had possessed the people, and the looking
after nouelty busied them with strange and impossible hope,
while euery one stood amazed to gaze after wonders, while
the conspiracy was in growth, and had diuers factious Nobles
to forme it to a larger birth, while the souldiers desired
to bee doing, and men grew weary of ease and quietnesse:
The businesse might haue plunged the Kingdome, and successe
tooke a flight with strong wings indeede, whereby you
may perceiue the sweetnesse and benefit of expedition in all
dangerous businesse, and resemble vniustifiable actions to
theeuish bargaines, which either must bee made away in the
darke, or hastned apace in the proudest market place according
to the saying:

            Notwithstanding, our great Duches remained vndaunted,
and in a manner of scorne to depend vpon others promises,
she aduentured on her owne power, and determined
to put him vnder the wings of Fortune, let her ouershade him
as she pleased: so gathering his forces together, and furnishing
her ships with a sufficient company, and some valiant
Captaines, shee sent him to sea, and onely prayed to the
wrathfull Nemesis, as authour of her reuenge, for successe and
thriuing in so glorious an attempt. Heere were of all nations
and conditions of men, Bankrupts, Sanctuary-men,
Theeues, Robbers, Vagabonds, and diuers others, who affecting
liberty, rapine and spoile, desisted from honest labor,
to be the seruants of dishonest rebellion. His fortune (as we
now prophanely abuse that terme) draue him on the coast

of Kent before Deale-Castle,Perkin commeth to Kent. where being becalmed, he cast
anchour, sending diuers on shore, to certifie the Inhabitants

But alas, this oratory flew like a shaft without a head; and
they had learnt other lessons of stability and loyalty, as finding
the sweetnesse of peace, and happinesse of gouernment.
Notwithwanding, they called a Councell, and I beleeue, if
they had beene fully resolued, that hee was the true Prince
indeed, they would haue entertained the motion. For some
of their fingers itched to be doing, but suspicious of his originall
and former weaknesse, and wisely apprehending, how
shame and reuenge dogged treason and rebellion at the
heeles, they concluded to continue firme and faithfull to
the State, and so with a kinde of policy to allure them to
land, they sent diuers to Perkin, with flattering hopes of
their assistance, while they were indeede mustering of forces
to surprize them as fast as they should land: which when
Perkin perceiued, he imagined that all could not be well, or
consorting to his expectation. For in this point, his wit and
experience serued him to vnderstand thus much, that common
people and multitudes stirred to sedition, vse no solid
councells or settled discourses: but come flocking with their
fulnesse and forwardnesse to assist their friends, and follow
their pretences, according to Euripides description of a confused
company and rebellious army:

                  â€”In infinito enim exercit
                        â€¢

Whereupon hee durst not land himselfe, and was sorry so
many of his company were on shore, but seeing there was
no remedy, he sent others, if neede were, to releue them, or
bring them backe againe to his ships.
            When the Kentishmen beheld such a rabble of strangers
and dissolute persons, and wisely foresaw that there was no

no man of honor or eminence to giue credit to the attempt,
they presently coniectured, that they came rather to spoile
and forage the coasts, then to releeue a distressed Prince in
his right: and so running the right way indeed, stood firmly
for their Countrey, and set vpon them as they were stragling
vp and downe in the villages, enforcing the better sort
and better armed backe againe to their boats, and surprizing
such, as could not maiutaine the quarrell, and had presumed

prisoners, yea, the principall Captaines themselues, while
they laboured to perswade the retreat, and to gather them
together after some martiall forme of resistance: viz. Moumford,
Corbet, Whight, Bets, Quintine, or Geuge: who were all
brought to Sr. Iohn Pechy high Sheriffe, and so raled in ropes,
like horses drawing in a cart, sent vp to London, and there
executed in diuers places adioyning to the City, whereby
Perkin had matter of disconsolation for the time, and time
enough to saile backe againe into Flanders, to entertaine better
aduice and more company.
            The King (as you heard) vnderstanding of this attempt,
left his progresse and came to London, where assured of this
good successe, he sent Sr. Richard Guilford into Kent to thank
the Sheriffe and the people, for their loyalty, obedience, and
valiant circumspection, which had so quickly dissipated his
enemies, and quieted the Countrey, giuing present order to
his Nauy to scowre the narrow seas, to the Prouince to keep
the coasts, to the Watches to fire the Beacons, to the Captaines
to prepare their Souldiers, and to all sorts to attend
their seuerall charges, according to the ancient and laudable
custome of the Kingdome.
            When Perkin and his Captaines were arriued in Flanders,
and found, how their former delaies had beene a great obstacle,
and hindrance to their proceedings, they resolued to
remedy the same in their following courses, and by the contrary
celerity and speedinesse to wipe away the blots of their
weaknesse, and faint proceedings, as if they had learned of
our Poet:

               
                  Sic agitur censura,Ouid. 6 6.

                  Cum ludex, alios quod monet, ipse facit:
               
Notwithstanding, because they were now resolued, that the
King taking notice of this on-set and attempt, would fortifie
the Coasts, and be in a readinesse with well prepared forces:
they determined to saile into Ireland,
               Perkin resolueth for Ireland, and so into Scotland. there to augment
their company, and corroborate their pretences, which accordingly
was effected, and the entertainment yeilded him
a little comfort and satisfaction: but because he well knew
the Irish were weake and vnarmed, and so vnable to preuaile
against the strength of England, and still out of countenance,
and quickly daunted, when they were drawne from
their bogs, and woods to solid battailes and strong charges,
contrary to their flight, skirmishes, and running encounters,
they thought it more meete and expedient to passe into
Scotland: Gens semper inuisa Britannis, and there make triall
of a new friendship, casting vp a forward account of their
happinesse, in this manner: First they were assured of the
naturall and generall hatred betweene the Nations, which
vpon very small occasions and probable opportunite, would
burst out into flames of despight. Next, they proiected,
that the nature of the businesse would allure them to his assistance,
vpon hope of vaine-glory, and a reputation of so
charitable a worke, as to help a Prince in distresse. Thirdly,
they relied on this hope, that if no other cause would be inductiue
to his supportation, yet the desire of spoile would
quickly incite them to warre against so plentifull a Country.
Fourthly, they perswaded themselues, that the Scots had a
good opinion of the house of Yorke euer since the cruelty of
the Lord Clifford against Rutland, for which they vtterly abandoned
Henry the sixt and the Queene. And last of all,
they concluded to promise them the surrendring of Barwick,
and to enlarge their territories if he preuailed by their assistance,
which was a sure motiue to draw them into any action
whatsoeuer: whereupon he departed from Corck and
landed on the West of Scotland, from whence he prepared
himselfe to go to the King with some solemnitie, wherein his

instructions preuailed with his fortune, because for the most
part the masse of people are guided by showes and ceremonies,
rather then matter of substance and truth, and so he
trauelled to Edinbourgh, whose Citizens vnaccustomed to
such glorious showes, began already to commiserate his fortune
and distresse: yea, the King himselfe assembled his
Lords and Courtiers, as their manner then was to entertaine
him and giue him audience; which when Perkin perceiued
to fall out to his good liking and hearts desire, he thus
framed his speech vnto him, or if you will reduced his instructions
to a manner of attracting Oratory.

and therefore I come not to you altogether like a cast away

with my creditours for a trifle, when there may be sufficient
to pay the principall: nor like a run-away from a
hard-hearted Master: or if you will, to take my liberty the
better, to cast of the yoake of honest and ciuill obedience,

as a stranger subiect to shipwrack, and the hassardous endurances
of a tempest, I am enforced to your refuge, as much
enduced with your Princely delight in deeds of charitie and
hospitality, as my owne wants or recouery: I might adde

And although I may confesse my selfe to resemble the man
in the Gospell that fell amongst theeues, whom diuers looking
vpon passed by without reliefe: yet, at last he found
one Samaritan to pay the cost and defray the charges of the
Surgerie: so haue I done a worthy aunt, friend, and noble
kinswoman to acknowledge her afflicted Nephew, who hath
helped me accordingly: so that I make no question, that
from the example of a woman your Princely commiseration

and powerfull coadiutement shall open their larger embraces,
considering that you aboue all other Princes haue
beene made acquainted with the distractions of our family,
and from time to time know how the house of Yorke hath
beene dilacerated, and torne in peeces by the cruell hand of
Tyrants and home-bred Wolues, which whether it were the
permission of God or the secrets of his diuine Iustice; I will
not now dispute vpon: Only, I must be bold to say, that
when my father obtained the Crowne, and reuenged his fathers
wrongs and death, there were signes of Gods fauour
and assistance in the faire issue prepared, and sweet fruit of
such a flourishing tree, namely two sonnes and fiue daughters,
who were simply committed to the tutelage and protectorship
of an vnnaturall Vncle, who proued a tyrant and
destroier of our blood and progeny, so that I may well cry
out as Ariadne to Theseus:

Notwithstanding, Most mighty King, how euer my Princely
Brother miscarried, as swallowed vp in the iawes of cruelty
and slaughter, It should seeme the murtherers were affrighted
at that they had done already, and desisted from a full
prosecution of the Tyrants command, or confounded with
compunction of spirit spared me, and secretly conueied me
out of the hands of such an homicide and blood sucker (for
so I hope without offence I may rightly tearme him) and although
by this meanes and the supportation of high borne
Buckingham he obtained the Diadem: yet did God follow
him with the swiftest pace of wrath and anger, and at last I
must needs say, scourged him with rods of vengeance indeed;
for he presently lost his sonne, and his friend and coadiutor
lost himselfe: what afterwards chanced vnto me, as
my strange deliuerance, my bringing vp in Tornay vnder certaine
supposed parents of honest reputation, my trauailes into
forraine Countries, my aduentures abroad, my endurances
at home, with such like; it would be to tedious to relate,
and therefore I desist to put you now to further wonder
and amasement at the same, because I haue them as it

were registred in a scedule, which at your Princely pleasure
you may ouer-looke, with the Duches and Councels of Burgundies
hands to confirme the same: so that I confesse when
the King of France sent for me out of Ireland, I was in a
manner secure of my estate, and thought vpon no further
assurance, then his gratious apprehension of my ind

are reserued for the glory of this businesse, and euerlasting
memory of so remarkeable an action, wherein I submit my
selfe, ships, and people to your guidance and direction, Oh
doe not then annihilate my confidence, nor reiect my demands.
For next to the high controuler of mens actions, I
haue put my selfe vnder the shadow of your supportation,
and altogether rely on the vnity of your willingnesse and
power, to beare me through the difficulties of this passage.
            When he had made an end and giuen them cause of some
amasement at his yeares and tendernesse of experience to
deliuer yet his minde so freely,The King of Scots resolueth to assist Perkin. and with some illustration of
words and readines of gesture, the King without any further
scruple or diffidence cheered him, telling him plainly he
would assist him, and what-euer he was, or intended to be, he
should not repent him of his comming thither, &amp; so concluding

he had time with his wearied people to repose himselfe, and
the King, occasion to thinke of many matters: yet rather for
custome then to be diuerted from his resolutions, he called
his Councell and disputed the matter with them; they again,
(as it happened to Rheoboam, and shall be withall the Princes
in the World) grew to contradiction, and deuided themseelues,
some standing for their Countrie, some for their
priuate affection, some to please the Prince, and some to enioy
a good opinion of polecie, and wisedome. The grauer
sort and of greatest experience disannulled all the former intimation
of the Prince, with the impossibility of the businesse,

as if he were but a bare assumer of titles indeed. The
quieter sort and such as had smarted with the dissentions betweene
England and Scotland disclaimed any further warr
                  â€¢
               ,
and were weary with that which had passed. The yonger
sort apprehended it, as a worthy enterprise, and though it
had but colour of commiseration, yet considering he was befriended
from the Emperour, King of the Romains, and the
whole state of the Low-Countries, it could not choose but
help them with many friends. There was another sort, who
confessing the pouerty of their Countrie, concluded, that by
this meanes by forraging, spoiling a
                  â€¢
               d getting good booties
in England, much wealth might inrich them without losse or
hindrance of their owne, and so cared not how the warre began,
nor how long it continued. The last sort consisted of
such, who because they would haue their credit enlarged
from an opinion of States-men, and high reaching capacities,
argued (as we say) on both sides, pro &amp; contra, and from
a kind of Enthymema raised profit and emolument to the
Kingdome out of their sophistry: That if the Duke were
assisted and preuailed, Scotland was sure to confirme their
owne conditions: If he were countenanced, though not
preuailing, the King of England would accord to any offers
or demands, rather then King Ieames should take part with
his aduersarie and so strange a competitor.
            Whereupon it was resolued, that without further diffidence,
or drawing the Duches of Burgundies businesse in
question, the King should entertaine the Prince, who presently
honored him accordingly, and caused him to be proclaimed
the Duke of Yorke, shewing him all the fauours the
Countrie could afford, and affording him such entertainement,
as they imagined was both befitting his person and
condition: He againe, as if that spes bona dat vires cheered
himselfe, and assumed a new kind of behauiour, both
tempered with grauity, and yet commended for cheerefull
and well becomming: so that by the way of solace and inuitation
to pleasure and delight, he hauked andâ–ª hunted,
yea, the Ladies of the Country graced the Court, and came

with all conueniencie and befitting their estates to the Citie.
For vnderstanding so great a Prince; in possibilitie to be one
of the mightiest Kings of Europe; not full eighteene yeares
of age, yong, wise, and in the compleate strength of beauty,
was resident amongst them, they conceiued matters beyond
the Moone, and thought themselues happy if he would
fancy or fasten vpon any of them. What should I say, although
with the Poet:
Tarda solet magnis rebus inesse fides:Ouid. Epist. Helena Paridi.
               
            
            Yet heere was no mistrust, nor any way giuen to feare and
displeasure, but as the time, businesse, and place afforded,
shewes, masques, and sundry deuises inuited him to his contentment,
and the present ouercomming all pensiuenesse: so
he courted with some, danced with others,The King of Scoss prouideth Perkin of a wife. iested with the
rest, and was acceptable to all, till at last (the King giuing
way to the motion) he fancied the Lady Katherine Gourdon
daughter to Alexander Earle of Huntle nigh kinswoman to
the Crowne: and because she should not thinke him barren
of education, nor heart bound to his ambitious designes, he
tooke an opportunitie thus to discouer his loue vnto her,
and good opinion of her.

of putting her from him and pulling her to him, and so againe

all peeuishnesse and nicety: or indeed rauished with the thing
proposed, she was loath to be silent, considering she was pleased,
and could not be displeased, considering he had begun
so kindely with her, and therefore answered him with a prety
blushing modesty, to this effect.

him to such a harbour, kissing the ground, which he

Genius:

But when he more and more perceiued, that the Scots
(like a peece of wax) were rolled together by his warming

made no question to hammer out his designes on the anuile

he should set footing in England: notwithstanding, they prepared
all things for an inuasion, and euery man was ready to

forward, that in hope of gaine, spoile, victory, renowne, and
reuenge, they cared not whether the Dukes title were good
or no, and so with a well appoynted army and sufficient forces,
they marched towards the confines and borders of the
North.The Scots inuade England in the behalfe of Perkin. But the King (out of discretion) loth to make more
haste then good speed, and vnderstanding policy, coniecturing
that the English, by reason of Perkins being in Scotland,
might alwaies haue an army in readinesse, or raise sudden
troops to lie in Ambuscado in the borders, by way of preuention:

and (for any thing they saw) they might make both incursions
and excursions at their pleasure: which although in
some cases made the King the rather to wonder, as if England
were secure from any idle proiect, or indeede scorned

such spoile, cruelty, and insulting, that neuer before or since
did they euer triumph ouer vs, or prooued so tyrannous: so
that I may well cry out, as the Poet doth against Scilla.

Wherein questionlesse they had gone forward, but that
they perceiued no ayde or succour to come from any parts
of England to restore this titular Duke. Besides, the souldiers
(full of spoile and bloud) would goe no further, till
they had sent their presents to their wiues and children, or
returned themselues to gratifie one another, after such a
victory: but in truth the King resoluing it would bee reuenged,
determined rather to retire with this assured victory,
then to tarry the nuncupatiue Dukes vnsure and vncertaine
proceedings, and so reculed into Scotland againe.
            Some remember,Perkin lamenteth the English slaughters. that at this time (though it was but a
very simple policy) Perkin vsed a certaine kind of ridiculous
mercy and foolish compassion toward the English people,
as though that rather mooued the Scots to the retreat, then
any thing else: whereupon, lest his cozening and illusion
should bee discouered, by reason so few resorted vnto him,
he thus complained to the Scottish King, and (as it were)
exclaimed of himselfe. O wretch and hard-hearted man
that I am, thus remorselesse to forage my natiue countrey,
and purchase mine enheritance with such effusion of bloud,
cruelty and slaughter. For now I see, ere this businrsse can
be brought to any good passe, houses must bee fired, countries
depopulated, women rauished, virgins defloured, infants
slaine, the aged murthered, the goods rifled; and the whole
Kingdome subiect to deuastation, which (to my greefe of
soule) I must needes deplore. Therefore, great King, I request
you from henceforth, doe not afflict my people, nor
deforme my country, in such a lamentable and remorse

losse and excruciation of minde, especially effusion of bloud
and barbarous enforcement.

then halfe mistrusting his dissembling, yea fully resolued on
his weaknesse and pusillanimity:

Me thinkes your care is rather ridiculous then super fluous,
to bee thus dolent for another mans possessions: yea, I see
not, but your claime is so remote and disanulled, that it must
be an Herculean labour to settle you in any of their cities
and petty prouinces. But for calling England your land and
Realme, and the Inhabitants your people and subiects, it
is as wonderfull to me, as displeasing to your selfe, that in all
this time, neither Gentleman, nor man of worth hath extended
a daring hand, or (if you will) commisserable arme of
assistance toward you: nay, though the warre was begun in
your name, for your sake, and within your Realme, of which
you say you are the indubitate heire, and inuited to the same
by your owne people and faction.
            Alas,Perkins answer replied the Prince, I confesse as much as you say:
but if it will please you to acknowledge the truth, the falling
backe of the King of France, yea, when I was in the speed of
my iourney, the failing of many promises to mine aunt the
Duches of Burgundy, and the defect and protraction of
my businesse, by the losse of an hundred Lords &amp; Knights,
some in their liberties, some in their liues, some from their
owne good motiues and intents, and all from their true
hearts and endeauours, by the Kings forces and vigilant eye
ouer them, hath not onely deceiued my expectation; but

with what difficulty the nature of aduersity and men in distresse,
attaine vnto any credit and estimation: so that wee
and you both haue had wofull experience of many great

Princes deposed from their thronesâ–ª and left friendlesse, succourlesse,
and quite destitute of releefe in the hands of their
enemies: and therefore, as mischeefe and misery are of mine
olde acquaintance, so am I not now vnprepared to entertaine
the same, but must submit to the calamity, and attend the
appointment of the highest God, concerning my lowest
deiection, and so I conclude with an ancient saying of
Euripides:
               
                  â€”Turbam enim recipere me puduit,Eurip. Helena.

            Although this came roundly of, and sauoured some what
better then the former: yet the King replied not at all, but
was content with his first reproofe, being more fearefull
euery day then other, that this intricate businesse would be
a worke of wonder, and to fashion the lump of such deformity,
to any handsome or substantiall proportion, must be
dangerous and preiudiciall for euer to the Scottish crowne.
            After the Nobles had beene thus startled in Northumland

certified the King of all this enterprize and inuasion, who
not a little abashed at the same, as more fearing the naturall
subiect for starting out of the sphere of his allegeance, then
any forraine comet in the greatest radiance, and presages, he
presently tooke order for the repressing of each tumults and
insurrections: but assured of the Scots retreat, and that they
were returned loden with spoiles and great riches, he resolued
vpon another course, hauing in the meane while so great
occasions of displeasure against Scotland, that all men either
to please themselues, or animate the King in his willing reuenges,
cried out to armes, to armes, and this was the eleuenth
yeeres worke.
            The twelfth yeere began with a Parliament, both for the

settling the vncertaine affaires of the Kingdome, and the
obtaining a subsidy, or other disbursements of money for
the furnishing an army into Scotland, to which all the Nobility
and Gentry opened willingly their cofers, and cheerefully
their hearts, exclaiming against their immanity, and
proclaiming their loyalty and endeauours, to prosecute
them with all reuenge, that durst so affright the Kingdome,
and affront the peace and tranquility of the Common-wealth.
Of this army, was Giles Lord Dawbney, the Kings
Chamberlaine, made Lieutenant Generall, a man of no
lesse wit then experience, of no lesse experience then hardinesse,
of no lesse hardinesse then moderation and gouernment.
But see the changes of human life, and the mischeefes
to which the best men and greatest Princes are subiect, as if
the Poet were againe to cry out:

As he was marching forward with his forces,Arebellionin the west diuerteth the army out of Scotland. a strange innouation
called him backe againe. For, as if Fortune meant
to play the wanton with Perkin on the one side, and bring
him (as weesay) into a fooles paradise, and misfortune on
the other side try the Kings patience: A new rebellion in the
West, had like to haue beene as a heauy burthen on his
shoulders, and set in combustion the whole Commonwealth.
For when the Parliament was dissolued, and that
Commissioners were speedily sent to gather in the money,
this excande scens populus, to whom such taxes and impositions
was a kinde of drawing bloud from their very life veins,
began to rebell, especially the Cornish men, inhabiting the
remotest parts of the Kingdome westward, who not onely
complained on their owne penurie and wants, as liuing in a
barren and sterile soile, ouercome with labour, watches and
toyles in the mineralls, and getting a poore maintenance
out of the cauerns of the earth, with fearefull endurances:
but threatned the officers, denying the taxes, and began temeriously
to speake of the King himselfe: yea, when there
seemed by the Iustices &amp; others in authority, a dam to be cast
vp against this fearefull inundation, they desisted from womanish

exclaimes, lamentings, and eiulations, and fall inconsiderately
to malicious calumniation, threatning the
Councell, and naming Thomas Moorton Archbishop of
Canterbury, and Sr. Reinold Brey, as principall directours
&amp; setters forward of these impositions against them, saying
plainely, it was a shame, that a small incursion of the Scots,
which was not onely customary, but as soone extinguished
as kindled, should raise such exactions, and incite the Kingdome
to vnsufferable turmoiles, with a generall warre and
tumultuous hurliburly: to which things, when the Commissioners
would haue gently answered, and honestly maintained
the Kings purposes and prarogatiues, Thomas Flamock
a Gentleman learned in the Lawes, and Michael Ioseph a
Black-smith, tooke vpon them the defence of the Commons,
threatning without further reasoning the matter,
both the receiuers, and all such, whom they imployed as inferiour
officers vnder them.

multitudo, improbos cum habuerit praefectos: he became a

the disorder, and correction on such persons, as were the authours
of their greefe and vexation, and when any seemed
to impugne and reprooue these seditious and vnreasonable
courses, affirming plainely, that (from all examples and
times) treasons and commotions haue ended with lamentable
effusion of bloud, both of the authors themselues, and
many innocents made accessaries, through constrant and
wicked instigation, they were called base dastards, cowards,
fooles, and louers of ease and surquedry, more then renown,
and their countries honour and liberty: so that what with
shame of taunts and rebukes, and what with feare of the losse
of their liues and goods, they vnited themselues to this outragious
company, and made vp a strong party well armed,
and too well enstructed: for the Captaines not onely praised

and extolled the hardinesse of the people, but rewarded such
as assisted and releeued the souldiers, whereby (after a generall
muster of 40000.) they came forward to Taunton,
where they slew the Prouost of Perin, principall Commissioner
for the subsidy in those parts, and from thence to
Wells, intending to goe forward to London, where the
King was resident, and such Councellours as they maligned.

till with a kind of sigh he vented out this saying of Euripides.

But to complaine of God or men, would rather aggrauate
his greefe, then procure his redresse, and therefore although
he well knew that Princes were the tennis-bals of fortune,

and subiects of mutabilitie and alteration, whereas he must
submit to the diuine prouidence: yet, he also vnderstood
there was no iying still in this deploration without the ordinary
practise of such remedies as God had appointed in
their seuerall workings, and therefore prepared his Armies
either to bring this disturbance to a quiet attonement, or
whip the Rebellion with the scourges of fire and sword: But
when againe he considered the Scots were his enemies, and
must be suppressed; the Westerne Rebels were at his doores
and must be repugned: France was wauering, and must be
looked vnto: Flaunders threatning, and must be appeased:
Perkin Warbeck lay at aduantage, and must be watched; yea,
ouer-watched as indeed the principall fire-brand, that set
all this on a blase, and in the midst of these hurliburlies
came ouer Embassadours from the French King, who must
be answered; he grew somewhat perplexed againe, till shaking
off all the hindrances of his amasement, he fell to practise
and orderly performances.
            Whereupon he called his Councel together, &amp; they without
any great difficulty determined the busines in this manner:
To attend vpon the Scots,The Armies in England raised.

a puissant and politike Captain, prisoner at the ouerthrow
of King Rich. the 3. and within two yeares set at liberty, and
after Iohn Lord Dinham made high treasurer of England, was
appointed to muster the forces of the Countie Palatine of
Durham, &amp; the borders round about, &amp; so atteÌ„d that seruice.
To represse the Western Rebels, the Lord Dawbney with his
whole power prepared for Scotland, was recalled to march against
theÌ„ wheresoeuer they encamped; to look vnto France;
Calice and Guisnes with the Garisons were much augmented,
and prouided for. To preuent Flaunders, the Nauy was prepared,
&amp; the Staples for the Merchants setled: To keep Warbeck
from comming into England &amp; ioining with the Rebels,
the whole nobility combined themselues, especially the earle
of Essex, &amp; Lord Montioy; who came of purpose to London to
offer their seruice to his Maiesty, &amp; so all places were looked
vnt
                  â€¢
                with a vigilant eye, &amp; manned with strength of soldiers:

and to answere the Embassadors of Charles the French King,
he sent honourable persons to receiue them and conueigh
them to Douer, and there a while to detaine them, till some
of these tumults and rebellions were extinguished and suppressed,
which indeed was so wisely and politikely handled,
that none of the Embassadors were troubled so much as with
the rumors of these commotions.
            But see the horror of despight, and with what a contracted
brow misfortune can looke vpon Kings themselues: so
that a man may well say to this Rebellion, as Ouid did to Cupido
in his first booke of Elegies:
               
                  Sunt tibi magna puer, nimium

            For, as these Rebels and Cornish men departed from Wels,
they entertained for their chiefe Captaine Iames Twichet
Lord Audley,
               Lord Audley Captaine of the Rebels. whose countenance and authoritie in the
Countrie strengthened them much. For, by this occasion
they went without intermission to Salsbury, and so to Winchester,
and from thence into Kent, hoping for further and
further assistance; but they were deceiued in their expectation:

but determined to offend them in their facinorous attempts,
and preiudiciall intrusion, which loialtie somewhat rebated
the forwardnesse of the Cornish-men, and they began to
suspect themselues, being so farre from their Countrie, and
remote from any supply. Notwithstanding, loth to dis

as also animated by their leaders and conductors, they
were now asmuch exasperated against the Kentish-men for

foure mile of London, and tooke a field in an arrogant ouer-daring
manner on the top of an hill, supposing all things
consortable to their arrogancy and deceiuable hopes, because
as yet they passed and repassed without fighting, or
strong encounters: But alas,
Blanditiae Comites tibi erunt terrÃ³r

and they were abused with a vale of ignorance and couering
of obstinacy: For the King disposed of his affaires with
great policie and circumspection, not determining to giue
them battaile, or exagitate them at all till he had them farre
from their proper dwellings and flattering friends, till they
were in despaire of reliefe and wearied with long and tedious
iournies, till their treasure was spent, their vitaile consumed
and prouision failing, till their company dropped from them
like rotten hangings on a moistned wall, and their whole designes
and expectation quite disanulled; and then, when he
imagined their soules vexed with the terror of a guiltie conscience,
their fury asswaged with compunction and penitency,
their spirits daunted with repentance and remorse, and
all their army affrighted with madnesse and doubtfull extacies,
would he set vpon them, and in some conuenient place
circumuent and inuiron them to his owne best aduantage,
and their irrecouerable damage and destruction.
            As for the Citie of London:
               London. I cannot but remember and
compare it vnto Rome, both when Hannibal passed the Alpes
to threaten the Monarchy being yet farre off himselfe, and
also Marius and Silla couered her fields with armed men,
and trampled on the bosome of their Countrie with ambitious
steps, and cruell feet of vsurpation: then spake the Poet
in this manner,

There was chaining the streetes, shutting vp the shops, making
strong the gates, doubling the watches, hiding their
treasure, cries, feares, terrors, and euery one more disturbed

for the losse of his priuat goods, then the encuÌ„brances of the
Common-wealth. Here was mustering of soldiers, watching
all day in armor, staccadoing the riuer, filling the streets with
companies of horse and foot, cutting down the Bridge, locking
vp their dores, shutting the Gates, and what else named
before, to be put in practise with aduantage of many peeces
of ordnance both in Southwarke and the Suburbs, and the
strength of the Tower which they knew was reserued for the
King himselfe. Notwithstanding, such was the instabilitie
of the Citizens being a little disturbed from their quietnesse
and rest, their dainties and ease, their banquetings and meetings,
their feasts and sumptuousnesse, their pastimes and
pleasures, that they rather complained on the King and his
Councell for the first occasion of these tumults, then exprobrated
the rebell for ingratitude and disobedience: But the
King without further disputing against their peeuishnesse, or
laying open the abuses of such refractary people, deliuered
them of this feare: For he presently sent Iohn Earle of Oxford,
Henry Burchier Earle of Essex, Edmond de la Poole Earle
of Suffolke, Sir Rice ap Thomas, Humphrey Stanley, and other
worthy martiall men, with a company of Archers and horsemen
to enuiron the Hill where the Rebels were encamped
round about: Him-selfe with the maine battaile and forces
of the Citie, much ordnance and great prouision tooke St.
Georges field; where, on a Friday at night he quartred himselfe,
and on the Saterday very early in the morning he poasted
Lord Dawbney to Dertford, who by breake of day gat
the bridge of the Strand in despight of resisters, which manfully
defended it a while, shooting arrowes a full yard long,
and demeaning themselues like scholerly and eloquent Orators,
pleading for the time in a bad cause with good words,
and handling an ill matter too-too well. From thence he
went couragiously against the whole company, and what
with the former Earles assaulting them on the one sideâ–ª and
his owne charges on the other side, as knowing how the
Kings businesse stood to make an end of the warre, the battaile
began apace, and not a man but prepared himselfe to

fight it out, till at last the Lord Dawbney engaged himselfe so
farre, that he was taken prisoner: but whether for feare, or
through his owne wit and pollicie,The Rebels 
                     â€¢
                  
                  uercome. they quickly released
him, and he as quickly dispatched the matter, and made an
end of the warre: For he put them all to flight, so that a man
may well say vnto them:

                  â€”Via nulla sa
                        â€¢
                     utis,
                  Non fuga, non virtus, vix spes quo
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      mortis honestae:
               
and I may truely report of the contrary: neuer was a battaile
so well fought and so quickly determined. For before
the King was ready to goe to dinner, there were slaine two
thousand Rebels, and many more taken prisoners, the
rest hardly escaped home; who for all their defeature, and
vncomfortable newes to the people, were rather accelerated
to reuenge their companions wrongs, then exanimated from
further attempts, or seemed grieued at the King and Countries
molestation, shewing sad lookes, but stomachous
hearts, and so remained intoxicated in their braines, and
ready vpon euery occasion to a new rebellion, as you shall
heare hereafter.
            When this battaile was ended, and so delicately contriued
(for the King lost not aboue foure hundred men)
some imputed it to the Kings policy, who appointing the
same on Monday, by way of anticipation fell vpon them on
Saterday, and so taking them somewhat vnprouided, had
the fortune to preuaile and thriue in his aduantage: Such as
were taken and apprehended had their pardon, except the
principall and fire-brands of the mischiefe: For the Lord
Audeley was drawne from Newgate to the Tower-Hill in
a Coat of his owne armes painted vpon paper reuersed and
all to torne,Lord Audeley executed. and there beheaded the 28. of Iune. Thomas
Flamoch and Michael Ioseph were executed after the order
of Traitors, and their quarters sent into Cornwall for
the terrifying of the people, some were dispatched at sundry
Townes as they deserued: amongst whom the Smith,
and diuers others of his immodest friends had no excuse
to make for this rebellion, but whether they preuailed

or no, they were sure to be registred to eternity for daring to
doe somewhat in behalfe of their Countries liberty, and bidding
battaile to Kings and Princes at their Pallace Gates,
and before the Citie Wals, euen London it selfe, that great
Citie, the Chamber for their treasury, and strength of their
roialtie: which makes me remember a saying of Lucan:
               
                  â€”Sed me velsola tueri
                  Fama potest rerum,Lib. 8. toto quas gessimus orbe,
                  Et nomen, quod mundus amat:â€”
                  And in another place:
                  â€”Quid plura feram?Lib. 9. tum nomina tanto
                  Inuenies operi, vel famam consule mundi:
               
and this was the end of the twelfth yeare.
            In this time you must know, that the King of Scots lay
not idle, but meerely vpon supposition of what would follow,The King of Scots prepareth against England.
prepareth himselfe, nor was so ill befriended, but he
had secret intelligences of all King Henries purposes, and intendments,
whereupon he enlarged his Army, barracadoed
his passages, entrenched and fortified the holds, kept good
Watch and Ward, and stood on the pinacles of a high presumption
to encounter with the proudest forces of England;
yea, to giue defiance if need were to the King himselfe.
Notwithstanding, he now lay a while only at defence, watching
with what warde the English would breake vpon him,
and wondring at my Lord Dawbneis retraction, and why he
came not forward as his espials had aduertised: but when
he vnderstood of the Westerne rebellion, he then coniectured
the truth, and a while reposed himselfe, till a Messenger
of these Westerne men came vnto Perkin and profered
their obedience and endeuours, if he would come and ioine
his Army with theirs, and so as their Prince and Captaine,
reuenge there wrongs: this was motioned to King Ieames,
who for all he confessed, that if they would ioine with the
Cornish men, there might be a gate open indeed to preuaile,
and walke in the fields of Victorie: yet he would by no
meanes aduenture his people so farre, and confessed plainly
he wanted ships for transporting so great an Army into those

parts: Only, because he would be doing to please the supposed
Prince, he meant to take this opportunitie of the King
of Englands disturbance, and once againe aduenture into
his territories,King of Scots besiegeth Norham Castle. and so with a sufficient preparation
he attempted the Castle of Norrham standing vpon the
Riuer of Twede, deuiding Scotland and England. But Richard
Fox Bishop of Durham, a man of great learning, courage,
experience and fidelitie, suspecting as much, had well stored
and fortified the same, and was in it with such power, munition
and prouision as he was able to raise, sending the King
word of the siedge, and inuiting the Earle of Surrey to come
to his reskue with all expedition: The Earle was mustering
of men in Yorke-shire, when this newes extended it selfe, and
like a worthy seruitor hastned his iourney the rather, and so
with twelue Earles and Barons of the North Countrie,The Earle of Surrey raiseth the siege. one
hundred Knights and Gentlemen of name, and twentie
thousand Soldiers well ordered, and armed he came to raise
the siedge, in which this braue Prelate was so engaged: Besides,
he furnished a hansome Nauy at Sea, whereof the
Lord Brooke was Admirall to giue their attendance whatsoeuer
should chance: But when the King of Scots and his
counterfet Duke of Yorke had full and certaine notice of the
Earle of Surreis approach, and that the Lord Dawbenies army
was also integrat and vnbroken, yea, ready to march forward
as a second to the former, they thought it better to retire
with securitie, then to tarry the aduenture with certeinty
of losse, if not hazzard both of life and honour, and so by
a voluntary consent they raised their campe and returned
vnder colour of commiseration of the people whom they
knew in the best war, must be subiected to slaughter or captiuitie:
and to this purpose they could yield a reason out of our
Poet to certain spirits, that wondred at their affrightings and
drawings back, seeing no perill apparant, nor hearing of any
stedfast reports, concerning a more forcible enemie, and so
calling for a book reading to them this le

            This answere of the Kings did rather harme then good to
poore Perkin. For, they perceiued the King was weary of
this warre, and loth to take his part any longer, and so they
rested a while displeasingly pleased.
            But the truth was the Earle of Surrey was so enraged at the
bragging and ouer-daring Prince, that he followed him at
the heeles, and in reuenge of many mischiefes perpetrated
by him in such audacious manner,The Earle of Surrey entreth Scotland. he entred Scotland, defaced
the Castle of Cundrestins, deuasted the Tower Hedonha
                     â€¢â€¢
                  ,
vndermined the Tower of Edington, ouerthrew the Pile of
Fulden, and sent Norey King of Armes to the Captaine of
Haiton Castle, the strongest fortification betweene Barwick
and Edinborough to deliuer the same, which he absolutely denied,
vntill the worthy Generall set himselfe downe before
it, made his approches, and cast vp a strong rampart
or battery for the expugnation, preuailing so farre, that
at last it was surrendred, their liues onely saued: who
were no soooner departed according to the conditions,
but our Generall quite ouerthrew and demolished the
same.
            The King of Scots was within a mile of the siedge, and
yet durst not reskue the same, only by way of ostentation,
he sent Marchemount and another Herrald to the
Earle of Surrey with a kind of defiance, and challenge
either to encounter with him Army to Army, or body
to body; conditionally, that if the victory fall to his maiesty,
the Earle should deliuer and surrender for his ransome

                of Barwicke with the fish-garthes of the same,
if the Earle againe were Victor, the King would pay 1000.
pound sterling for his redemption.The King of Scots offreth a priuate combate to the Earle of Surrey. The noble Generall welcommed
these Herralds, and like a couragious, yet vnderstanding
Captaine: quickly answered all the points of their
commission: First, he was ready to abide the battaile in the
plaine field, and would if he pleased for the same purpose

lay open the trenches, and make the passages so easie, that victory
should haue comfort of comming amongst them. Secondly,
he thought himselfe much honoured, that so noble
a Prince and great a King, would vouchsafe to descend to so
low a dregree of contention, as a priuate duello with him, for
which he would not onely repute him heroike and magnanimous:
but setting his loyalty to his Prince aside, performe
all good offices, which belonged to the sweet contract of
a perpetuall amity, if it were possible, betweene them.
Thirdly, for the towne of Barwicke, it was none of his, but
the King his masters, which hee would not so much as coni
                  â€¢
               cture
vpon without his consent and aduice, as he himselfe
might well iudge in the affaires of Princes, what was to bee
done. Fourthly, hee thought his owne life worth all the
townes of the world, and so would gladly hazard himselfe;
yea, was proud (as hee said before) that so great a Maiesty
would parallel him in such a kinde, onely he desired pardon
for a little vaine-glory, that if hee conquered the King, hee
would release him freely; if the King vanquished him, hee
would either yeeld him his life, or pay such a tribute and
competency, as is befitting the state and degree of an Earle,
to all which he was the rather induced, because he was confident,
that
Causa iubet melior superos sperare secundos:
            
            But it should seeme, these affronts were meere flourishes:
For neither battell, nor combat, nor any enterprize worth
the recording was put in practise, although the English forces
had layen long in the Countrey to the same purpose:
wherupon the Lord Generall, loth to spend his time so inconsiderately,
and somewhat wearied with the distemperature
of the Climate, and vnseasonablenesse of 
                  ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰
                weather,
the Countrey affoording nothing but mists and foggs at
this time of the yeere, raised his camp, and retired to Barwicke.
But when the truth was further enlarged, the King
commauded him so to doe by his letters of priuate intelligence.
For now came a time, in which the windowes of
heauen seemed to open, and the God of mercy thought to

recompence his patience and goodnesse, with a quiet end of
his troubles, and happy successe in his enterprizes, which
fell out vpon this occasion.
            
               Ferdinando King of Spaine,The King of Spaine would marry his daughter to Prince Arthur. and Elizabeth his wife, hauing
a purpose to marry their daughter Lady Katherine, to Arthur
Prince of Wales, and very loth that any content on betweene
the King of Scots, whom he much fauoured, and the
King of England, whom he highly respected, should be (as
it were) a wall of partition betweene their proiected amity
and royall affinity, especially that either probability of an
interest, or counterfet deuice of the issue-male from the
house of Yorke, should cast any blockes or hinderances in
the way of these pretences, he most prouidently sent one
Peter Hialos a man of great learning, experience, and prudency,
as an Embassadour to Iames King of Scots by way of mediation
to contract a league of peace and absolute amity betweene
the King of England and him,An Embassador to the King of Scots from Spaine. who proceeded with
such faire conditions, and preuailed so well in his proposed
message, that hee perceiued a glimmering sun-shine of this
peace a farre off, but that there were certaine thickning
clowds of mischeefe and disturbance, which by some effectuall
heat from the King of Englands breath must bee remooued
and dissipated, and therefore hee wrote to King
Henry, that if it would please him to send some worthy man
to be his associate in this enterprize, he perswaded himselfe,
that an honest oratory would quickly conclude the profitable
articles of amity. For the Poet had assured him, and hee
found by some experience, that
Addidit inualidae rebus facundia causae,
And for an entrance into 
                  ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰
                same, he assured the King, that
there was g
                  â€¢â€¢
               at likelihood to lay downe the bloudy colours
of defiance, and flourish the pleasant ensignes of tranquility.
For the King of Scots had already protested, hee was onely
emulous of King Henries vertues, and not maligned or despighted
his person, and for Perkins title he made it a matter
of conscience and charity. For he knewe him the right heire,
if he were the right creature, and the Cleargy warranted the

actions as meritorious. The better sort disclaimed all tyrannous
prosecutions: For except their obedience to the King,
they spent and consumed their estates, and onely returned
with teares and lamentations for the lo

               se of 
                  ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰
                friends.
The inferiour sort imputed all to the superiour commands,
and as for the formidable effects and bloudy issue of warre,
it was only the chance and fortune of encounters, the action
of fury, and the vengeance or curse appropriate to dissentions,
according to that worthy author of excellent sentences
and proprositions.

            Whereupon King Henry boasting of the character of
Prince of peace, so that he might not be branded with ignominy
of basenesse, pusillanimity and dishonour, quickly
consented to such agreement, and for the same purpose sent
Richard Fox Bishop of Durrham, who stilllay in the baÌ„ttered
Castle of Norrham, as his cheefe Commissioner,An Emb

associated himselfe with Peter Hialos, at the towne
of Iedworth in Scotland, whither the Embassadour from
King Iames likewise repaired. Heere were many matters disputed
vpon, many conditions layd open, many difficult

               es
raised, many greeuances vrged, and many conclusions argued:
but because they failed in the maine poynt, nothing
was determined. For the King of England required Perkin
Warbeck to bee deliuered into his hands, as the principall
fountaine of this venomous streame, the cheefe 
                  â€¢
               ccasion of
his vnquietnesse, the perturber of his Realme, the seducer
of his subiects, and the author of many rebeilions. But the
King of Scots (like a Prince indeed) would not buy his peace
with the bloud of Innocents, especially a man comming to
him for succour, shewing all the markes of a distressed and
abused Prince, allied vnto him by marriage, commended by
the Emperor, assisted by the Duches of Burgundy, &amp; in himselfe

of faire demeanour, sweet behauiour, and of a most
royall and well esteemed spirit. Therefore (I say) he would
by no meanes betray him into the hands of his enemies, that
was so long admitted into the bosome of his friends, nor
should it bee sayd, that in any such degree, for any wordly
respect whatsoeuer, King Iames of Scotland would bee base
or perfidious, which he had learned from the example and
punishment of Prusias King of Bithynia, whom the Romans
deposed, for consenting to betray Hanibal into their
hands, though they had promised large rewards, and threatned
seuere vengeance.
            The Commissioners answered directly, that they intended
not by way of defamation, or contumelious discouery
of the vanity of the man, or impossibility of his businesse to
make him odious or corroborate their owne purposes, by
the destruction of so silly a creature, or discrediting so poore
a businesse: but meerely to shew the truth, and vnfold the
secrets of the deceit, that such a Prince as King Iames, might
not be colluded with shadowes and apparitions, but orderly
drawen into this holy and generall league, wherein both
Emperour, France and Spaine desireth a combination of amity
with England, onely there wanted himselfe to make
the number compleat, that the horne of Achelous might bee
sent from nation to nation, from kingdom to kingdom. For
I can assure you, the Marchants of England haue been receiued
into Antwerp with generall procession, the Emperor is
pleased with this combination, the King of Spaine pretendeth
a marriage, the King of France endeauoureth a league,
and all the Princes of Europe seeke after a true confirmation
of quietnesse. Therefore once againe, be not an enemy
to the good of all Christendome, nor so aduerse to this holy
combination, that the world shall rather esteeme you wilfull
and preiudicate, then wise and considerate.
            Notwithstanding all this forcible and effectuall intimation,
the King of Scots would not consent to deliuer Perkin
               The King of Scots will not deliuer Perkin.
vpon any condition, but as hee came to him for refuge, hee
should depart vntouched, and not by his occasion bee in

worse case then the bruit beasts, or vildest condition of men,
as he had learned long since out of that ancient Tragedian:

                  Habet confugium b
                        â€¢
                     llua quidem petram,Eurip supplice

                  Fugit, calamitatem passa: Rerum enim humanarum
                  Non est quicquam perpetuÃ² beatum.
               
Yet with much adoe hee was brought to a truce for certaine
yeeres, and condescended to this, that Perkin should bee no
longer succoured, harboured, or maintained by him, or in
his territories and dominions: with which answer, and orderly
ratification of the same, the Embassadours departed,
the Armies retired, the Souldiers discharged, the King of
England satisfied, the Orators of France (who from Do
                  â€¢
               er
had audience at London about the same purpose) rewarded,
and of all others the worthy Peter Hialos, as principall
worke-man in this intricate businesse, liberally and bountifully
recompenced.
            Only poore Perkin, whose glorious meteor began now to
bee exhaled, seemed disconsolate and examinated at this
newes and determination, especially when King Iames began
to expostulate and reason the matter with him. First,
from a repetition of the benefits and fauours receiued by his
Princely liberality and gentlenesse. Secondly, from his consanguinity,
in marrying his kinswoman vpon dangerous
hopes and triuiall aduentures. Thirdly, from his many trialls
of sundry conflicts in England, proouing all his promise
                  â€¢
               winde
and smoke, and his best enterprizes triuiall &amp; fana
               
                  â€¢
               icall.
Fourthly, vpon the now combination of amity with
all the Princes of Europe, which could not be done without
the King of Englands consent and agreement. Fiftly, vpon
the fatherly regard of his Countrey, which had neede haue
some breathing time of ease and rest, and must questionlesse
take a loue day of consolation and desisting from turmoiles.
Last of al, from the care of the Religion &amp; Mother-Church,
vnto whose obedience and regard hee was now absolutely
sworne: Therfore he desired him to take some other course,
and depart out of his Realme. For (as hee heard) hee was

now interessed in the confederacy of the peace of Christendome,
Perkin discharged out of Scotland. and vnlesse hee should bee a periured and perfi
                  â€¢
               ious
Prince, hee could in no sort infringe the conditions, nor
breake the truce combined by a firme and vnseparable adiuration.
            When Perkin had heard him out, although euery word
was worse then the croking of some night-rauen or scrichowle,
and the amazement (for the time) might haue much
disabled him: yet loth to discredit his cause by any demisnesse
or pusillanimity, and seeing all answers were superfluous,
and the very messengers of despaire and disconsolation,
he raised himselfe with some outward cheerefulnesse, and as
well to auoyd ingratitude toward so great a Benefactour, as
to countenance himselfe and his businesse, he thus casting away
all feare and abashing timidity, replied.
            Most worthy Prince:
Mortale est quod quaeris opus: mihi fama perennis.
And therefore God forbid, that my commorance in your
Court and Kingdome, or the weakned cause of my attempts
should prooue disaduantagious o
                  â€¢
                ominous vnto you, both
in regard of the many fauours your Princelinesse hath heaped
vpon me vndeserued, and mine owne willingnesse not
to bee too too troublesome or offensiue vnto so benigne a
Maiesty, which rather then it should bee hazarded for my
sake without a cheerfull and liberall willingnesse, the fame
and glory of the enterprize shall be sufficient for mee, and I
will not onely disclaime my right and interest in the Kingdome
of England, my lawfull inheritance by descent: but
poure out my selfe, and spend my life most profusely for
your sake. Onely this I must entreat at your hands, to giue
me leaue to rigg and calcke vp my ships, and gather together
that dispersed company I haue, or such as would willingly
and voluntarily attend me. Which seeming but reasonable,
and no way repugning the former agreement with the Embassadours,
was quickly condescended vnto: so with many
gifts,Perkin retorne

                  h into Ireland. and royall furniture for his wife and family, he tooke
his leaue &amp; sailed backe the same way he came into Ireland,

determining (as the last anchor-hold of his fortunes) either
to vnite himselfe with the Cornish-men, whom he knew not
fully appeased, or to retire to Lady Margaret his most worthy
aunt and faithfull coadiutrix.
            He had not beene long in Ireland, but his false fortune
began once againe to play with him, as flattering him with
assured confidence and warrantize, that the Westerne men
would welcome and entertaine him, from whom he had this
notice: that they could not forget their former iniuries
and slaughters, nor determined a setled and true obedience
to the Lancastrian family: whereupon because something
must be done, or else he should be for euer discredited:
or that God in his Iustice derided all su

magnificence, quietnesse, religion, charitie, gouernment

               ecy on worke: he sailed out of Ireland with fiue
small Ships, and two hundred men, his wife and attendants,
his substance and wealth, and in a word all that
he had.
            But when he was to conferre about his landing and setting
forward his designes,Perkin ec

                  meth into England. he had such poore Councellors,
as a man would smile at for pity, rather then laugh at for
scorne. For his principall friends were now Iohn Heron a mercer,
and banquerout. Iohn of Water sometimes Maior of
Cork: Richard Sketon a Tailer: and Iohn Astley a Scriuener:
men in generall defame for dishonest actions, and in particular
reproach, for vnderstanding nothing but what consorted
to their own wilfulnesse, and outragious appetites; of whom
I may say, as Ouid complaines in another case in his Elegies:

With this crue about the month of September he landed at
a place called Bodnam, and there so sollicited, and excited
the multitude and wau

               ing people, that when they heard
him proclaimed Richard the fourth, as the indubitat sonne

of Edward the fourth, whom the Duke of Glocester, or if you
will, Richard the Tyrant determined to murther, but that he
escaped by the prouidence of God, they flocked vnto him
to the number of 4000. and according to the nature of children
running after newfangled toies or painted pictures:
submitted to his princelines, and sware with all allegeance to
maintaine his dignity &amp; royaltie: with which confidence &amp;
company after they had taken the musters of his Army, and
concluded to get some strong Townes into their possession,
that so they might not only augment their forces, but still
haue places of supportation and refuge to retire vnto, they
went directly to Excester,
               Perkin besiedgeth Excester. and besiedged it. But because they
wanted ordnance to make a battery, and other prouision to
raise their trenches, and approches, or indeed if you will,
were ignorant of martiall discipline, and the secrets of a true
Soldiers profession, they spent the more time against the
Gates, and endeauoured nothing but a forcible entrance,
assaulting the same with great peeces of timber like the Roman
rammes, crowes of yron, fire-brands, and impetuous
violence of great stones cast at ther
                  â€¢
               , and amongst them.
But the Citizens manfully defended themselues, and held it
out to their perpetuall fame, letting ouer the walls in secret
places diuers in baskets with strong cords to post to the king
&amp; acquaint him with their distresse. In a mean while seeing
a fire made vnder their Gates, and that the enemies fury encreased,
they suspected themselues, &amp; had no other shift but
to put force to force, &amp; with one fire extinguish, or if you will
deuoure another, and so they caused great store of faggots
&amp; timber combustible to be brought close to the posternes
and greater gates, where the mischie
                  â€¢
               e began, and set the same
on fire, which encreased with a filthy smoake, and smother,
and at last burst out into a flame and blazes, so that neither
the enemies could come in, nor Citizens goe out: but all
were compelled to desist from that worke, and apply themselues
to more new and necessary labours. For the Rebels
assaulted the most weake and broken places of the Wall, and
the Citizens ranne to the expulsions, and repaired the breaches

as fast as they were made; besides, they had leasure to
cast vp great trenches vnder their Gates, and by strong
barkes rampering the same made them more difficult passages
then before: The wals were mightely and impetuously
assaulted, but the worthy Citizens defended them with
that courage, and countermanding: that they slew aboue
two hundred Soldiers in that fury, and behaued themselues
as if they determined to obtaine a perpetuall name of renowne,
and vnmatchable Trophe of honor: so that I may
well and briefely say of them:

                  â€”Serpens, sitis, ardor, arenae
                  Dulcia virtuti: gaudet patientia duris.
               
            
            When Perkin and his associats saw so strong and strange
opposition,Perkin discomfited leaueth Excester and departeth to Taunton. they seemed both amased and defatigated at the
same, whereupon betweene rage and despaire, he retired his
lowsie and distressed Armie to the next great Towne called
Taunton, where he mustred them a new, but found a great
want of his company: For many of his desperate followers
were slaine and cut off: many of the honester and ciuiler
sort, seeing the Towne of Excester so well maintained, and
that very few resorted vnto him, contrarie to his former flourishes,
and ostentation; fell from him, and retired themselues
home: many wery of the wars, and coniecturing an impossibility,
to remoue a king so firmely established, or terrifyed
with the punishment impending on Treason, and presumptuous
rebellion, left him to his fortunes, and many politikely
forecasting for the worst, seeing not one of the nobility or
better sort to afford a helping hand to the lifting vp of this
frame, were contented to dispence with former protestations,
and so prouided for themselues, whereby (as I said) as if
the prouerb were verified:
Non habet euentus sordid a praeda bonos.
he came short of his reckning, and the Items of his accounts
went much curtailed of their former length and computation.
            But in truth the posts of the Country brought comfortable
tidings of the Kings Army approaching, of which the

Sir Edmund Carey, Sir Thomas Trenchard, Sir William Courtney,
Sir Thomas Fulford, Sir Iohn Hatwell, Sir Iohn Croker,
Walter Courtney, Peter Egecomb, William Sentnaure, and diuers
others, brought forward the forces of the countrey, to
raise the siege of Exester, which not onely animated and encouraged
the Citizens, but rebated the fury of the contrary,
and diuerted them from that sore and outragious manner of
assaulting the walls, where in the last onset, the noble Earle,
with diuers others, were hurt with arrowes; he wounded in
the arme, and the rest in seuerall parts of their bodies, but
very few slaine: And so with much adoe, this famous and
honour-thirsting City, with the honest Inhabitants of the
same, were deliuered and releeued.

               But to our story againe:
            
            When the King approached the towne of Tawnton,
whether out of policie not to hazard the whole army at
once, or out of suspicion of some reuolters in his company,
or humbly considering there might be a turning of Fortunes
wheele, as still Rota fortunae in Gyro in the encounters of a
battell, or harping vpon some stratagem and enterprize,
as prouidently forecasting both the worst and best,
which might chance: Hee sent before him Robert Lord

Princes, with the very shadowes of perill and danger, making
them confesse their frailty and ticklish estate of mortality, by
the seuerall encumbrances and mischeefes, to which they are
subiect: and another way confound the mightiest proiects,

mountaines of pride, sedition, conspiracies and ambition,
to powder and dust, and then blowing it away like smoake

            When King Henry knew that Perkin was fled, and departed
from his camp,The Lord Daubney sent after Perkin. he sent the Lord Daubney with fiue hundred
horse, to intercept him: but he was lodged before they
came, although most of his company were surprized and taken,
who as miserable caitiffs and poore wretched delinquents
were presented to his Maiesty: But when the residue
of this fearefull and staggering army, could neither vnderstand
what was become of their Generall, nor see their accustomed
Penons and Ancients, nor their quarters so well
ordred, as was the manner of Souldiers, nor their companies
so cheerefull and well heartned, they knew not what to say,

or to doe, some supposing he was fraudulently slaine, some
suspecting he was traiterously fled, some reporting the manifestation
of his deceit, some wondering at the strangenesse
of his proceedings, in that he had so myraculously
begun, and presumptuously prosecuted such a dangerous
worke: some exclaiming vpon the simplicity of
the matter, that built vpon no better grounds then vaine
hopes and presumptuous titles: some cursing themselues,
that they had so farre engaged their loialties against their
Soueraigne Lord and King: some continuing in their
rancorous malice, sware nothing but reuenge, and obstinacy:
and some neuer to be reclaimed, euen when their
forces failed, cried out to goe forward, rayling at the misfortune
of their businesse, that they must now faile, when
they were ready to pull downe the Towne wals with their
hands: Yet when they were assured of his cowardly
flight and base pusillanimity, the common feare, common
mischiefe, and common danger,The Army of Perkin submitteth to the King without fighting. made them cast
away their armour, and submit to the King, to whom
though they came with affrighted countenances, and venemous
hearts, sad lookes and little repentance, curses in
their soules, and promises of faith, loyaltie and obedience,
out of their mouthes: yet did the King entertaine them
with all cheerefulnesse, and acceptable comfort, as the
greatest benefit which God could at that time bestow
vpon him, nor disputing of their hypocrisie, nor determining
by more narrow searches, or artificiall incantations
to try out the depth, and search the bottome of their resolutions.
            Thus as a conquerour without manslaughter and
effusion of blood,The King r

of Excester, and knowing Praemium and Poena to be the
mastering curbes of all the things in the World, not
only praised and applauded the Citizens: but opened
the Treasure house of reward, and honour amongst them,
giuing some presents, aduancing others to the order of
knighthood, granting many petitions, according to the

worthy condition of a Prince, and the full corroboration
of their obedience: Then proceeded he to some exemplary
punishment of diuers refractary Cornish-men, whom
their owne companies accused, as Delinquents, and the
Maiestie of the gouernment would not endure without
correction.
            But all this was nothing in comparision of that which
followed: For his horsemen prosecuted the chase so diligently
and honestly, that they pursued the Lady Katherine
Gourden wife to this Perkin,
               Perkins Wife taken. euen to Michaels Mount;
who, notwithstanding, had she not been betraied by some
of her owne followers, might haue escaped: For transhaping
her selfe into one of her seruants habits, she had
gone quite away to her ships: But that some pittying the
distresse of the King, and turmoiles of the Kingdome;
and perceiuing the end of the warre and pacification of
these troubles to depend vpon her surprising, would by no
meanes giue way vnto new disturbances, but tooke her and
presented her to the Kings Commissioners: what should

Some report, he durst not let her marry for feare of ambitious

Some confirme, that she was of that greatnesse of spirit,
that she scorned all others in regard of her selfe, both by
the priuiledge of her birth-right, and the possibility of her
greatnesse. Howsoeuer, he intreated her most honorably
and amiably (such a power hath beauty and comlinesse
euer in distresse) and sent her to the Queene so maiestically
attended, as if she had beene a Queene indeed.
            In the meane while my Lord Dawbney imploied himselfe
and his company so effectually, that enuironing the
sanctuary wherein Perkin was with two companies of
light horse, who were vigilant, cautelous, strong and couragious,
and so lay in the aduantage

                protraction, and therefore loth to loose
him, or giue him liberty to runne with the blinde mole
into further cauerns of the earth to cast vp heaps and
little hills of commotion and affrighting his estate and
yet daring not to infringe the priuiledge of these holy
places (such a hand had superstition, and the Popes fulmination
got ouer all the Princes of Europe) he went
more politikely to worke, and sent diuers persons of
account to perswade his submission, and render himselfe
wholly into the Kings hands, who not only promised
him pardon of life, but comfort of liberty, yea,
honourable maintenance vpon the easie conditions of
desisting to perturb the Common-wealth any further,
and disclaiming so iniuriously to pretend any title to the
Diadem.
            When Perkin saw to what streights his Barke was
driuen, and that he must either split on the rocks of despaire,
or retire back againe into the troublesome Ocean

of despight, according to the nature of cowardly and irresolute
men, he chose the worst part to saue his life, and
submit to the Kings acceptation, not remembring, because
he was neuer acquainted with the secrets of maiesty, that
he, which hath beene once a Prince, must neuer looke
for a setled quietnesse in a priuat estate (because he is still
subiect to the Conquerors pleasure) but an ignominious
life, then which, an honourable death is tenne thousand
times better, which made the noble Hecuba, as a worthy
patterne to al vnfortunate Princes, thus answere the proudest
conquerors themselues.

But as I said he now only recounted the difficult passages
of his former trauailes, the dangers escaped, the deceit
pretended, the perill imminent, and the misfortune too-too
apparant, as being in no securitie in the place, he was
fled vnto, nor hauing any confidence in the persons, he
had chosen: For though he knew there was a reuerence
appropriate to sanctuaries; yet kings, if they pleased, vvill
be tied neither to law nor Religion, but performe what
they list, or vnder colour of their owne security, say they
are compelled vnto: Therefore without any further aggrauation,Perkin submittet, to the King.
relying on the Kings Pardon, and those honourable
conditions propounded, he voluntarily resigned
himselfe, and came to his maiesty, as a messenger
of glad tidings, that now all warres, troubles, and
commotions were by this meanes ended and determined.
            The King not much wondred at him: for he only found
him superficially instructed of a naturall wit, of reasonable
qualities, wel languaged and indifferent apprehension,
but farre from that highnesse of spirit, or heroick disposition
to deserue the character of a Prince, or lay claime
to a Diadem: yet loth with any boisterous strength to

handle a bruized arme, or draw the feltow into a new
selfe-loue, or good opinion of himselfe, hee passed ouer
his examination the slightlier, and brought him immediately
to London, being met all the way with great co
                  â€¢
               
               courses
of people, who both came to gratifie him and his
auspicious successe, and to see Perkin like some strange
meteor or monster: or, if you will, because wee will deale
more cleanlier with him, like a triumphant spectacle, to
mooue amazement, delight and contentment, according
to that saying of our Poet:
Nocte pluit tota, redeunt spectacula manÃ¨:
            
            But when they began to capitulate, that being a stranger
and an alien borne, hee durst not onely abuse so many
Princes and Common-wealths with lies, fictions, and abominable
deceit: but euen bid battell to Kings and Princes:
yea, bring Kings and Princes into the field for his assistance,
they fell from wondring at him, to raile and abuse
him, both with checkes and opprobrious taunts: yea, diuers
dared to put in practise many vndecencies, both of
rage and indignation, had not the reuerence of his Maiesties
presence diuerted their inconsideration, and commanded
no further rumour, gazing vpon him, or violent
threatnings against him. To conclude, the King brought
him quietly to London, and for all he had giuen him life,
and affoorded him a kinde of liberty: yet did hee set a
guard ouer him, that hee could neither haue free conference,
nor doe what he wantonly listed without them.
            By this time you must consider, that Lady Margaret
in Flanders, Duches Dowager of Burgundy, was not so
ill befriended, or negligent in her owne affaires, but
shee had both intelligence from England, and espialls
of her owne, to acquaint her with all occurrences and aduentures,Lady Margaret much troubled with this discomfortable newes.
as they chanced. But whether it was a newes
to her of bitternesse, and tormenting despight, or no;
let them iudge, that make their stomackes and inward
faculties a store-house of rankour and malice, and
cry out with Seneca, Foelix iacet quicunqu
                     â€¢
                   quos odit,

Premit: yet was she not tormented so much with the losse,
expences, or disaster of the businesse, which might be the
chance of warre, as in that shee could not preuaile in her
malignant courses, against her enemy the house of Lancaster:
So that shee bemoaned the lamentable successe of
her vnfortunate darling, and (as many did testifie) euen
shed teares againe; but they were so farre from co
                  â€¢
               punction,
or penitency, that they seemed rather signes of
rage, frenzy, and intollerable madnesse, in which shee
cried out on nothing, but reuenge: and repeated an exclamation
of Hermiones against Orestes:
               
                  Quae mea Coelestes iniuria fecit iniquos!
                  Quodue mihi miserae

                     idus obesse querar!
               
So that if shee had had power to her implacable hatred,
K. Henry should haue felt the scourges of her wrathfull
hand, euen to the lowest deiection, and she had questionlesse
shewed him a tricke of a womans will, or (if I might
speake without offence) wickednesse.
            In this while Perkin hauing two yeeres liberty to ruminate
on his businesse, and swell vp his vexed soule with vncomfortable
commemoration of precedent misfortunes,
would many times cast out abrupt and vncertaine speeches,
concerning his distresse, and the maleuolent aspect
of his fate, cursing his miserable life, and complaining on
his vnprofitable Genius, that had stood him in no better
steed, wishing hee had beene borne to any mechanicall
drudgery, rather then from the royall bloud of Plantaginet:
Insomuch, that his keepers mistrusted him in these
extasies, and the King was still troubled, that hee could
neither make him confesse the truth, nor disclaime this
high assumption of another dignity and royalty. But at
last, as all such discontentments and eruptions must haue
avent, and so a determination, whether the opprobry of
this kinde of imprisonment greeued him, or the vnquietnesse
of his thoughts vexed him, or the basenesse of his
submission abused him, or the losse of his sweet wife
confounded him, or the instigations of others disturbed

him: or indeede, because the last act of his Tragedy and
Catastrophe was now in hand, he not onely studied which
way to escape; but put the same in practise in despight of
his owne knowledge, that the King was acquainted with
all his discontentments. For alas; Princes haue long
hands and prying lookes, to reach into the furthest parts
of their Kingdome, and search into the secretest close

himselfe, his vaine suppositions, as in his former
enterprizes, still flattered him, that he should once againe
finde fuell enough, to set another rebellion and commotion
on fire: and his vexation to bee bereaued of so delicate
a creature as his Lady, made him desperate of all,
and set his wits on the 
                  â€¢
               enter-hookes, to put something
in practise to his further contentment. So that one
day reading the story of Mortymers escape out of the
Tower, by giuing his keepers a sleepy drinke, he in such a
manner deceiueth his guard, and betooke him to a resolution
of escaping and flying out of the land, wherein hee
prooued onely like the silly bird, that with striuing in the
net, entangles herselfe the more: or, as Deere that are
hunted, betray themselues to well-sented hounds, by their
faster running away, whereby they make the deeper impression
in their steps: So fell it out with him,
Incidit in Scyllam, cupiens vitare Charybdim:
And by seeking after liberty, hee brought himselfe to a
more straighter and vnkindlier endurance. For when hee
had gone to the sea-coasts, aud heard the exclamations of
the people against him, saw all places debarred, knew
great searches made for him, vnderstood what an indignation
the Countrey had conceiued of his mockeries and
illusions, and found the whole Kingdome vp in his search,
and posting after him, he was quite exanimated, and (like
a man distracted) knew not what to do. At last, vnstable
in his former wilfulnesse, he once againe altred his pretended
iourney, and came to the house of Bethelem, called

the Priory of Shene,Perkin commeth to the Prior of Shene. beside Richmond in Surrey, and
committed himselfe to the Prior, with a long and secret
conference, concluding with an impetration of his charity,
that being a man of God, hee would not thinke it strange
to see Princes subiect to disasters and fatall conclusions of
misfortune. For he well knew the story, both of the Abbot
of Westminster and the Bishop of Carlile, who in despight
of King Henries vsurpation, who had not only proiected
the deliuery of Richard of Burdeaux; but opposed
the King in his strength of soueraignty, against his wilfulnesse
to destroy the other deposed: and therefore he desired
him to obtaine his pardon of the King, yeelding forcible
intimation for the same purpose.
            The Prior (glad to haue interest in such a meritorious
worke, and proud to bee seruiceable to his Prince and
Countrey) came with conuenient speed to the Court, and
acquainted his Maiewy with the accident, leauing no circumstance
of any validity vnrecounted, which ended to
the Kings wonderfull content, and the whole Courts disdaine
and amazement. But all times are not alike, and
Princes (in their mercies &amp; pardons) are not so flexible, as
presumption buildeth vpon: Yet to please the Prior, hee
gaue him his life, which to a generous and free borne spirit
was more irksome then death. For hee was first taken
and brought to Westminster with all scorne and repr

then set in a paire off stockes with contumelious derision,
then carried through all the streets of London like a prodigious
spectacle, then put to the racke, which made
him not onely confesse his pedigree and originall, but
write it with his owne hands: Last of all, mounted on diuers
scaffolds he read it in publike, and that so disgraciously,
as in the commemoration was able to torment a
looker on so that hee might well crie out

In some of your Chronicles you haue this confession at

large, as in Grafton, which to make the story compleat, I
haue a little contracted, and thus expose the same.
            BE it knowen vnto all men,Perkins confession. that I was borne in the
towne of Tourney in Flanders, my father Iohn O

Controller of the said towne, and my mother Katherine
Haro, my grand-father Direck Orsbeck, after whose decease
my grand-mother married Peter Flamine Receiuer
of Tourney, &amp; Deane of the boat-men ouer Lescheld, my
mothers father was called Peter De Faro, which kept the
keyes of St. Thomas gate within the said towne. I had also
an vnckle Mr. Iohn Statime of St. Pias Parish, with whom
I dwelled very young, hee married mine aunt Iane, and
brought me vp very well; yet my mother not contented,
as being very chary of mee, had mee to Antwerp to
lea
                  â€¢â€¢
               e Flemish more exactly to a kinsman of my fathers
Iohn Steinbeck, with whom I remained a full halfe yeare,
but by reason of the wars I returned to Tourney, where I
was placed with Mr. Barlo, who within another yeere carried
me to the mart at Antwerp, where I fell sicke awhile,
and so was boorded in a Skinners house much conuersant
with the English nation, whereby I learnt the language,
as you see. From thence I went to Barrow mart, &amp; lodged
at the old man: Afterward, Mr. Barlo, left me at Middle-borough
with Iohn Strew a Merchant, who first made me
beleeue, I was better then I was. From Antwerp I sailed into
Portugall with my Lady Brampton in a ship called the
Queenes ship, &amp; serued a Knight in Lichborne called Don
Peter Las de Cogna, who had but one eye; yet the manner
of his behauiour and order of his house, made mee tarry a
yeere. Then Pregent Meno a Brittaine carried mee into
Ireland, and either commanded so by my Lady Margaret,
who (as shee said) was my aunt, or proiecting something
for his own priuate, would needs perswade me I was
a Plantaginet of the house of Yorke. For when I arriued in
Corck, because I was somwhat haÌ„dsomly apparrelled, they
would needs bestow vpon me the title of the E. of Warwick
               
sonne to George Duke of Clarence formerly in Ireland,
which Iohn Le Wellin the Maior maintained, and for as
much as my deniall was contrary to their expectation,
they brought me to the crosse, and made me sweare: which
I did, disclaiming him, or any of his kinred, vntill Stephen
Poitron, with Iohn a Water came vnto me, as resolued I
was King Richards bastard-sonne (then in the hands of the
King of England) perswading mee not to bee afraid or
daunted at any thing: For they would ayd me &amp; assist me,
euen to the obtaining the crowne of England; yea, they
knew of their owne knowledge, the Earles of Desmond
and Kildare were ready to aduenture their liues and estates
for my sake: After this they carried mee into Flanders,
to Lady Margaret Regent and Duches of Burgundy,
who preuailed so far with me, that I took vpon me the
person of Richard Duke of Yorke, second sonne of King
Edward the fourth, and so with reasonable preparation, I
returned backe againe into Ireland, where the sayd Iohn a
Water, Stephen Poinings, Iohn Tiler, Hubert de Brough, the
foresayd Earles, and many others entred with mee into a
dangerous rebellion, and I was proclaimed by them Richard
the fourth. From hence the King of France sent for
me by Loyte Lucas and Stophen Frian, but making peace
with England, he left me to my fortunes: Then I sayled
into Flanders, where my supposed Aunt made more of
me then before, so I attempted England, but was driuen
backe againe into Flanders, from whence I went into
Scotland, and from thence againe into Ireland, and so into
England.
            When the people had heard him out, they wondred
both wayes at the matter, and stood (as it were) confounded
betwixt shame and indignation. If it were a co

to thinke how grossely the Kingdome, and some of
the best therein, yea many Kingdomes had beene abused
with such an imposture, to the prosecuting seuerall 
                  â€¢
               acinorous
actions, and disturbance of the peace and tranquility

of the Common-wealth: If it were not so, and that for
feare of life hee confessed the contrary, being the true
Plantaginet, and a Prince borne to so great a fortune: then
they wondred if any man could bee so base, as to deiect
himselfe to such ignominy and opprobrious disgraces,
when to die had been honorable, &amp; to sell ones life in the
field, far better then to plead on a scaffold, where the many
changes must needs distract him, and make a poore soule
neither fit for life nor death: But whatsoeuer he was, they
could not chuse but deplore his estate and misfortune, as
naturally and ordinarily all men are bemoaned in aduersity,
especially such an one, that was so forward in the race
and iourney to Maiesty, and pulled backe so often by the
sleeue, and turned with a fury into the house of desolation,
and dungeon of disconsolate wretchednesse when to haue
perished at once, had beene a fauour of death and fortune
indeede, according to our Poet:

                  Mitins ille perit subita qui mergitur vnda,Lib. 3. de pont
                           â€¢

                  Quam sua qui liquidis brachia lassat aquis.
               
            
            When the King had this way satisfied himselfe, and
pleased the people,Perkin committed to the Tower. as he thought: hee made no more adoe,
but to preuent inconueniences, clapt him in the
Tower, from whence he escaped not, vntill hee was carried
to Tiborne, and there swallowed vp by the neuer satisfied
paunch of Hell, for his former abuses and intolerable
wickednesse, which hapned very shortly after. For
iust at this instant, a roguish Augustane Frier called Patricke,
on the borders of Suffolke, after Peter Warbecks example,
taught a poore scholler one Ralph Wilford to take
vpon him the title of the Earle of Warwicke, as yet in
the Tower of London: but supposed to escape, as corrupting
his keepers, intimating the glory of the action, and
the brauery of such an enterprize, wherein who would be
so base and cowardly, as not aduenture his life, and put
in practise any designe to attaine to a Diadem, especially
by so easie meanes, as personating a Prince, and assuming
the title of the next heire to the crowne: And when some

of his better vnderstanding friends laid open the danger &amp;
impossibility of the attempt, with the odiousnes &amp; perf
                  â€¢
               diousnes
of the Treason, he answered the first with one Poet:

                  And the latter with another:

But although this mischiefe was quietly blowne ouer like
a weake and thin cloud suddenly dispeirced by a forcible
winde (For both Master and Scholer were quickly apprehended:
the one hanged on Shrouetuesday at Saint Tho.

all such vapours, and gaue the law leaue to play her
part to the finall extirpation of the very roots of sedition,
which presently was thus set on worke.
            
               Peter Warbeck impatient at this restraint of his liberty,
and stomaching his former disgraces &amp; indignities, would
endure no longer, but studied euery hower how to escape,
not yet knowing what to do, when he did escape, to which
purpose by faire promises and false perswasions, he corrupted
his keepers: Strangwaies, Blewet, Astwood, and long
Roger seruants of Sir Iohn Digby Lieutenant of the Tower
to slay their said Master: and set both Perkin and
the true Earle of Warwicke at large, and so to make
their fortunes, as they could either by domestike or forraine
friends: to which, when the innocent Prince condiscended,
as glad any way to enioy his libertie, and to be
freed of his imprisonment (for you see birds kept in
golden cages beat and flutter vp and downe as scorning
their enclosure,Perkin corrupting his keepers to escape out of the Tower is tak

one day, or breathing time to giue them a taste of
any pleasure, or contentment, discouered the whole conspiracy
to the King and his Councell, not leauing out any
circumstance which might either exasperate his rage, or
pull forward death and destruction to the delinquents.
Whereupon, without further disputing the matter Perkin
Warbeck, Iohn a Water sometimes Maior of Corck, and
his sonne were the 16. of Nouember arraigned and condemned
at Westminster of high Treason, and the 23.
hanged at Tyburn: Perkin mounted on a scaffold reading
his confession, and contrary to all expectation, a

            Not long after Edward Earle of Warwick, who had
beene the 21. of Nouember arraigned at Westminster before
the Earle of Oxford high Constable of England for the
present,The Earle of Warwicke beheaded. was vpon the 28. 1429. beheaded at the Tower
Hill: For he quietly confessed the enditement, concerning
his consent and willingnesse to obtaine his libertie,
though it were by violating the law in that kinde, and
breaking of prison, whose simplicity I rather lament, then
condemne the offence. For it was a dangerous time for any
Plantaginet to liue in, and I may well cry out:
Omne tulit secum Caesaris ira malum:
But the King was indeed glad of this occasion, and fortune
gaue vertue the check, because as he had imprisoned
him without a cause, he knew not what to doe with him
without a fault: yet some report that the principall reason
of accelerating his death was a speech of Ferdinando's king
of Spaine, who should sweare, that the mariage betweene
Lady Katherine his daughter, and Prince Arthur of Wales
should neuer be consummated, as long, as any Earle of
Warwick liued. For the very name and title was not only
formidable to other Nations, but superstitions to the wau

and vnconstant English: whereupon the King was

the gladder to take hold of this opportunitie, where in the
conuiction of Law had cast this stumbling-block of treason
in his walke and race to a longer life, and yet was
there nothing done, but by orderly proceedings, and iustifiable
courses: more then when the silly Prince submitted
to his mercy, he thought it the greatest point of
mercy to looke to himselfe, and so for the benefit of his
posteritie, and the sedation of all troubles both present
and to come, struck off his head, and
with him the head of all diuision
and dissention.
