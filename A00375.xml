            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

             To the most reuerende father and lorde / lorde Christopher bysshop of Basyle / Erasmus of Roterdame wyssheth helth.   
            I Can scarse exp̄sse with wordes most reuerēde p̄late / howe yuel this trouble &amp; wrāglyng strife doth vexe &amp; greue my mynde / nowe of late reysed vp (I knowe nat by what persones) in this noble cytie / which at my cōmȳng hither / I foūd very qiete &amp; pesable.  We rede / how in ye olde tyme a strange Bore sente in by Diana / brought gret trouble to the people of the countrey / called Calydon / But this besynesse &amp; trouble (as I here say) was brought in to vs by an housholde pigge. The thyng of it self (I mean to ete flessh in lent) it not dāpnable I dare wel say / but yet that stubburn &amp; disobedient mynde / semeth to be redy &amp; prepayred

to any maner of mischefe / if the truthe be so / as I am enformed / by the cōmunication of many men
            We rede in the histories of ye 
               
                  〈◊〉
                / yt the rulers &amp; heed officers dyd punysshe a certayn boy / whose play and pastyme was / to pricke out the eyes of byrdes / wher so euer he mizt catch thē. Because that by this frowarde appetite &amp; sust of it self to do a mysse / they gessed that he wolde ꝓue a mischeuous citezin &amp; a cruel / redy to muder &amp; kyss. We rede also that a certayn other man was merced ī a gret sōme of money / bycause whan the officer after the maner of the countrey asked of him / whether he had a wyfe according to his own mynde / &amp; suche one as he wolde haue her to be: he answered bourdīgly. ye truely haue I / but by god nat accordyng to thy mynde / &amp; such one as thou woldest her to be. If one cō
               
panion had made this answere to a nother in tyme of recreation / it had ben a pleasant &amp; a mery iest / but by cause it was spoken out of season / neither in mete place / neither to person according: it dyd declare &amp; vtter a leude mynde / lytel regardynge or settyng by ye authorite of the cōmen offycer &amp; ruler. Therfore deserued punysshmēt / nat the sayeng it selfe / but the cyrcūstaunce &amp; maner of the sayeng. Custome confermed with long vse / is a very mighty &amp; strong thyng / whiche though it be neuer so 
                  〈◊〉
                &amp; vnresonable / yet after it hath ones takē place &amp; hath caught authorite / vnneth it can be broken without great troublīg of the cōmy naltie / neither cōmenly can it otherwyse be put downe / than by lytel &amp; lytel after ye same maner as it crope in at the begynnyng.  Nowe fastynge and choyse of meates are of

suche nature / that if a manne vse them right / they ar helping to good lyueng. Fyrste sobernesse &amp; temperaunce of meate / maketh ye mynde more free &amp; at lybertie / to gyue attē
               daunce to suche studies / whiche helpeth more nere to vertue &amp; parfyte lyueng. Moreouer as ye body was a minister and a prouoker vnto the mysdedes whan we dyd synne / and a felo we or ꝑtaker of ye wicked plea sure: so it is mete &amp; accordyng that in repentaunce he shulde be ꝑttaker of sorowe &amp; payne / &amp; be obediēt and do seruyce vnto the soule / returnīge to the right way agayne. Fastynge therfore and the choise of metes / are good for two purposes.  Firste to tame the wantōnes of ye body / yt he be nat wylde &amp; sturdy ayenst ye spyrite: For as prouander is taken awaye from feers horses / &amp; which be disobediēt to the ryder / &amp; to them in

stede of brede or otes is gyuen hayes So it is very well done / that norisshynge meate be withdrawen from the body / which rebelleth agaynst yt spirite / by the reason of abundaūce of iuce &amp; ranke humours: &amp; that su che kynde of metes be ministred vn to it / wherof it shulde kicke &amp; winch as lytel as were possible againste ye mynde: whiche is as a horsman or ryder to the body. For as meate taken away from ye body mynissheth the ranknesse therof / so are there certayne meates which so doth noryssh the body that he shal lyue but nat to ranke or wanton. Moreouer it is good &amp; profytable to pease ye wrath of god / ꝓuoked with our synful dedes: For verily whan he seeth vs to punyssh our sesues / he than remytteth his vengeaunce. No payne is more nere aꝑtaynyng to euery man than whan both ye mynde is vexed

with the hatered of synne cōmytted and the body also punysshed wt the abstynēce of thynges plesaunt &amp; desectable. And verely this way &amp; meane to appease the wrath of god / is shewed to vs in very many places of the olde Testament: And Christ him selfe taught / that there is a certayne kynde of deuyls / which is nat caste out / but by prayer &amp; fastynge. And though it were shewed before of the prophetes also / that the fcstes of the newe Mone / the sabbot dayes the fastes / the choise of meates / &amp; su the other shadowes of the olde lawe shulde vanissh a way / whan ye sight of the gospell began ones to shyne: yet for all that the churche of Christ beyng yet but yonge &amp; newe begonnen / &amp; al togider brethyng nothyng els / but the newe Must of ye Euangesycal spirite / after that her spouse was taken vp i to heuyn / embraced

nothyng more nor sooner / than fastyng &amp; prayer. And thā euery man fasted / and that dayly / though they were not cōpelled therto / by any cō
               maundement or lawe. And ye most parte of christen men / nat onely for beryng flesshe / but also refrayning from the eatyng of fyssh / &amp; all other thynges whiche so euer bare syfe / ly ued content with frute / herbes / and rotes: Whan Christ &amp; his apostels had gyuen leaue &amp; lybertie to euery man for to eate what so euer metes he 
                  〈◊〉
                / at laste whan the custome of fastyng was ones receyued &amp; approued of the cōmen people / in that no man grudged agaynste it / than was it cōfyrmed fyrst by ye authorite of other bysshoppes / &amp; anon as ter by the authorite of the pope or bysshoppe of Rome: Bycause than (as I wene) the charite of ye people waxing colde / the moste parte dyd

embrace &amp; loue carnalyte &amp; worldly pleasure. The auctorite &amp; cōmaundemēt therfore of the bisshops was added &amp; put to / as a spore to pricke forward ye myndes of weke ꝑsons / whiche than were fallyng to worse thīges. Than was put to also ye cō
               stitution &amp; lawe written / to restrayn ouermoch lybertie / as it were wt certayne graces / and to kepe the people within their bondes / that they shuld nat ronne to farre at large / &amp; gyue them selues to all maner synne and mischefe. Fastyng therfore &amp; the ab stinēce from certayn kyndes of metes / can not vtterly be condēpned of this cause that they do nat profyte &amp; helpe any thyng at al vnto good lyuyng / if they be vsed so as they ought to be. Moreouer an order is a great thyng / without the which ther can be no sure &amp; stedfast peace &amp; cō
               corde among men, Concorde is norisshed

&amp; maynteyned either by equa lyte or els by an order / that it to say whan euery man hath his roume a cordynge to his degree / &amp; euery one hath his office assigned &amp; gyuen vn to him / as (for an exāple in the body of man) bytwene the two hādes the eyes / the feete / the eares / there is equalyte: but betwene the eyes and the bely / &amp; the fete nat equalyte / but ordre norissheth cōcorde / which ones taken away / what good thing I be seche you is left amōg christen men whiche are (as Paule techeth) ye mē 
               
                  〈◊〉
                of one body. Who so euer therfore troubleth the order in a cōmen welthe / bringeth in no lytel or smal incōmodyte ther vnto / namely if he do it nat by occasyon or necessytie / but by a presūptuous stubbernes &amp; self mynde. ye / &amp; though it be but in trifels &amp; suche thīges / which of their owne nature though they were dyspised

it is no hurte or yuel at al. 
            As (for an ensāple) it is customa bly vsed in the church / that Alleluia is not song in the lente / yet to laude and praise god at what soeuer tyme or season it be done / is a vertuous &amp; holy thyng / and the churche in stede of alleluya hath apoīted other wordes / almost of the same strēgth and sygnification. yet neuertheles / if any curate īdispyte of the cōmen custom / wolde in his churche syng alleluya / and mocke or scorne other yt dyd not so to / shulde he nat seme by the iugement of al men / to cōmyt &amp; do a thyng worthy of great punysh ment? Or if any curate in the later ende of lente / nat by errour or mystakynge / but of sette purpose &amp; for the nones / dyd cōmaunde in his churche the belles to be rong / whan it is vsed of custome to call the people togyder with wodden clappers:

shulde he not seme worthy to be banysshed as a madde man? Some man wyl say / what trespas or faut hath he made? In the thynge of it selfe is no harm not offēce / I graūt but in the dispisyng of ye cōmen custome / &amp; in troublynge the order of thynges / is great hurte &amp; offence. &amp; so moche the more vnworthy of par don and forgyuenesse / is the malycious mynde of the trespasser / bycause he myght haue obserued and kepte the cōmen custome / without a ny incōmoditie. Howe moche more is the same thing to be thought and iuged in this mater? I mean of fastynge / whose ensample sprange to vs from the prophetes / from Iohan Baptist / from Christ &amp; his apostels whiche hath ben cōmended to vs by a longe vsage and custome of oure elders in tymes paste. Whiche thing also is of great strength / &amp; chefely

helpeth to apease god whan he is of fended with oure mysdedes / and to prepayre the sperite to the worde of god / to holy prayers / to godly hymnes / and to other vertuous &amp; godly studies &amp; exercises / mete for a trewe christen man. But if any thīg were receyued by vse &amp; custom / which for certayn cōsideratiōs or some incōue niēce yt sprong of it / or for some bet ter purpose / were better to be putte down &amp; layde away. It sholde be cō ueniēt &amp; acording / that it were done so by lytel &amp; lytel / that al wrāgling and stryfe myght be excluded. 
             Christ / although he wolde ye the shadowes of the lawe of Moyses shulde gyue place to the lyght of the gospel / whan it shulde appere &amp; be shewed. Yet lest he shulde gyue occa syon to any man for to be offended / he lefte none at al of those thynges vndone / which the lawe cōmaūded

to be done. Neither taught he opēly at any 
                  〈◊〉
                ceremonyes to be dispysed / whiche the iewes obserued more relygiously / than yt they coude suffre them to be condēned. No / neither condemned he vncurtesly those tryflyng tradicions which the Pha rises of their owne inuētyon added to the burthayns of the lawe. ☞ 
             This thyng onely he dyd rebuke / that the pharyses them selues kepte nat their owne constytutions / wher with they laded &amp; ouerlayde the people / &amp; that through the suꝑsticion of them / they brake the earnest &amp; sadde preceptes of the lawe. Neither dyde he so defēde his disciples that he said it was laufull for euery maner of cause to breke the sabbot day / but he excuseth them by necessytie cōstraynynge them / &amp; defendeth their innocency / by the ensample of Dauyd &amp; the preestes / though vpon ye sabbot

day (hungre cōpessynge them) they gathered the eares of corne. Moreouer Paule him selfe / whiche most feruētly &amp; styffely defendeth &amp; main tayneth the lybertie of the gospel / a mong ye iewes was made as a iewe shauynge of his heer of his heed / receyuyng a vowe on him selfe / obser uyng the ceremonyes belongyng to their sacrifyce / and purifyeng hym selfe with other in the temple.  
            The same Paule / though he knewe that an ydole is nothyng / and that the flesshe offred to an ydole is nothyng more vnlauful of it selfe / thā other flesshe: yet had he leuer neuer to eate flesshe whyles he lyued / than to 
                  〈◊〉
                occasyon to his weake brother for to be offended by the reason of his etyng. He had leuer for a season to apply him selfe to the suꝑstytion of the iewes / whiche coulde nat be ouercomen / than by turnyng the

hertes and myndes of them whiche were 
                  〈◊〉
                agaynst hym / to haue hyndred the goyng forwarde of the gospel. He had leauer forbeare for euer the eatyng of flesshe / than that they whiche were weake &amp; scrupulous in conscience / shulde haue had any occasyon gyuen of him / to suspecte that he was consentyng to the wicked supersticion of ydolatrers.
             The same Paule wylleth also / yt a bonde seruaunt / beyng a christen man / shulde be obedient to his lorde and maister / though he were an infydele / ye / and waywarde &amp; dyuers to please. He wylleth also / that the wyfe beynge a christen woman / be obedient to her husbande / though he be a hethen man: He wylleth / that christen men shulde content &amp; please the offycers whiche were gentyls in all thynges / whether they required tolle / trybute / or honoure / leste any

man myght haue had occasyon to be offended with the gospell / whiche no doute they shulde haue had / if ye professyon of Christ shulde haue se med sedicious &amp; cause of debate and stryfe. Paule knewe wel ynough / what is the lybertie of the gospell / but it was expedient for the fortheraūce of the gospell that knowlege shulde be subdewed / &amp; gyue place to charitie. For these men also (I meane the eaters of flesshe in lente) as I here saye / layeth for theym selfe the lybertie of the gospel / of the whiche they make Luther renewer &amp; defender. In whom it semeth to me / nat onely the trewe spirite of the gos pel to be wantyng / whiche is sobre / mylde / &amp; endewed with discrete sym plicite / but also natural wysedom / if they do nat fauour Luthers cause than they worke wysely / but if they do sauer it / they coulde nat by any

other waye haue hurte or hyndred it more / than by this. If their entente be / that the christen people shulde be restored agayne to their olde lyberte than take they the wrong way to the wodde / &amp; done al amysse. For theyr vndiscrete presūption doth nothyng els / but double the yoke &amp; bondage / cōpellyng the rulers &amp; offycers to en crease the bondage with sharpe and strayte cōmaundementes &amp; decrees. But these men whiche defendeth thē selues with the colour of the lyberte of the gospel / ought fyrst to do such dedes / for loue of ye which they 
                  〈◊〉
                be ꝑdoned &amp; holden excused / if they dyd lytel regarde these thyngs / as be ynge smaller &amp; of lesse value. Who so euer dothe al that he can to helpe his neighbour: Who so euer 
                  〈◊〉
                so mo che reuēgeth nat the iniuries &amp; wrō
               ges done vnto him / that he is redy to do a good turne for an yuel: Who so

euer is alwaye sobre / as thoughe he fasted: Whose mynde / raymēt / and cōmunication sheweth nothyng els but signes of chastite: Who so euer is altogider busyed &amp; occupied in do yng suche thinges / wherof it semeth that some great &amp; cōmen welth and profyte shal folowe: such a man pa rauēture shalbe ꝑdoned / though he seme lesse suꝑstitious in obseruyng the ceremonys which are more mete and according for the vnlerned and weake persons. But whose so euer hole lyfe serueth but vnto riote and voluptuousnesse: whose cōmunica tion is proude / seers / and vnchaste: Whose mynde in so moch is nat me ke &amp; mylde / that they be redy for the leest worde of reprefe in the worlde / to lay on wt their fiftes / or to thrust in with their dagger: suche felowes are shamelesse / if they preache of the lyberte of the gospel / for asmoch as

they are such maner men / yt they ou ght to be kepte vnder &amp; holden ī yet / with lawes &amp; cerimonys / as it were with grates of yron / euen lyke as ye iewes were / vntyl they do profyte &amp; growe vp to ye quicknesse &amp; strēgth of the Euangelycal spirite. Wherfore euyn as ye presūp tuousnesse of these men / nat without cause displeseth &amp; mislyketh al good &amp; wyse mē / So are there certayn thīges / in whi che the same men are sorye to se the flocke of Crist ouermoch wrapped and entāgled with iudaical ceremonyes / &amp; to be oppressed outher with the aucthorite / or els through the neglygēce of some certayn prelates of the churche. Of the which thyng saynt Augustyne also cōplayneth in his epystels / cryeng out that the con dytion &amp; state of the iewes were almost more easy &amp; tollerable thā the cōdition of christen men. So moche

of iudaical suꝑstitions euyn at that tyme was flowen so plētuously in to the cōmen vsage and custome of christen men. The people them selfe cōmenly sechen &amp; drawen suche bō
               dage vnto thē selues / euen lykewise as the wynde Cecias draweth cloudes vnto him selfe (as it is sayde in the cōmen prouerbe) But it were ye bysshopes parte &amp; duetie to prouyde and se for the lyberte of their flocke / whiche they haue taken &amp; receyued of Christ &amp; his apostels.  Nowe a dayes we do heape oftentymes but then vpon burthen / and tye snare to snare / so lytel we go about to rydde out of bondage the soules of ye people / &amp; al to the entent to haue them more thral &amp; in daūger to our tyrā
               ny / sekyng rather and so folowyng our owne sucre &amp; aduaūtage / than the helth &amp; sauegarde of their soules.
             Paule putteth no difference betwene

one day &amp; another / but he coū teth euery day for an holy day / neyther iugeth he any worke vnlauful to be done on the holy day / which is done accordyng to the charite of the gospel. After that our elders wylled for a very resonable cause truely / the sonday to be kept holyday / in whiche the people shulde cōe togider to here the gospel of god preached.
            Anon after holydayes were commaūded to be kepte from al maner bodily occupation &amp; labour / whan other whyles it were a more holy thi ge with handy labour to make prouisyon for their wyues &amp; childer / be yng in ieoꝑdy to perysshe for hūgre than to here the songes of ye preestes in the churche / which they vnderstā de not: I speke nat this by cause I do iuge the custome of antems and hymnes to be condēpned / wherwith the quere gyueth prayse to their god

and ours: but lykewise as Christe doth teache in the gospel / that man was not made bycause of ye sabbot day / but that contrariwyse / the sabbot daye was instytute &amp; ordayned for mānes cause. So I do iuge / yt al ceremonyes ought to gyue place so ofte / as the necessyte of our neighboure requyreth the offyce &amp; dede of charite. But the people / of whō they ought to lerne the truth of these thī
               ges of the same / are cōpelled oftentymes to do ye cōtrary. And it was nat thought suffycient that the people afterwarde was ouercharged with holydayes / &amp; dayly is charged more &amp; more. For in some coūtreys it is ī maner a cōmen custome / that euery bysshop dothe adde one newe holy day to the olde / as a thynge to cause hym specially to be remēbred perpetually after his decesse: &amp; that is done otherwhyles for very lyght

causes. One there is paraduēture / whiche ī tymes past hath had a wē
               che to his derling / whose name was Barbara / for this cause he wil that saynt Barbaras day be holy day. Anothers mother was named Katherin / this hath semed to be cause suffycient wherfore saynt Katherīs day shulde be holyday / &amp; kepe ye peo ple from their worke. Some others name is Wyllyam / &amp; therfore labou reth he al that he can / yt saynt wyllyam may haue his holiday by him selfe. Lette these thinges be rehersed bycause of exāple onely / for I had leuer vse fayned exāples than to of fende auy person. Some men also hath their priuate &amp; peculyer affecty ons: one man towarde saynt Eras mus / another towarde saynt Christofer. Ther is also certayn cōmen affections of orders / of natiōs / and of cyties / as ye blacke freers fauoureth

excedīgly their Domynike / the gray freers their Frances: ye paynters saynt Luke / surgions &amp; phisycions Cosme and Domian / shoma kers / Crispyne: Warryers saynt Martyn: french men Claudius: pa risyans Genouese: Oxforde men saynt Friswyde. Of this kynde is also ye affection of them / which wyl haue Christ &amp; the sayntes to be suꝑsticiously honored by ꝑtes / to whom it is not ynough yt the deth of Crist is so ofte rep̄sented &amp; dayly remembred in so mauy masses / &amp; that ye ho ly crosse hath his two holydayes / ex cepte also the blode whiche Christe shedde forth / the whiche they saye is kepte ī many places: excepte ye nay les / yt crowne of thornes / ye / except the prepuce of Christ / that is to wete (the skynne whiche was cutte from his priuy mēbres whan he was circūcised) whiche the worship ī some

place: Excepte oure ladyes mylke / which is shewed in many places / ha ue eche one their proper holyday.
            But if any of such maner thynges shalbe / which shal seme that it may be wel &amp; holyly honoured: It were ynough that holy day were solemly kepte in ye churches onely / to which it myght be lauful for ryche men to come / or who so euer els myght con ueniētly / &amp; let nat the poore men be cōpelled / whose handes norissheth a great housholde. And though these affections parauēture are nat to be repreued / yet ought nat the wysdom of the bysshops to sette so moche by them / that forth with euery saynt &amp; euery relyke shulde haue his proper holyday / his proper masse / &amp; proper seruyce / &amp; peculyare maner of worshippyng. What other thing is this than to dryue &amp; cōpel the poore people to famysshing / whan that thing

is taken from them / wherwith onelye they norisshe their housholde or meyny. ye / moreouer as the worlde goth nowe a dayes / what other thīg is it els / than to prouoke &amp; cal ye peo ple from honest &amp; holy labours / to ydelnesse &amp; ryotte? For what dayes do we synne more in excesse / dronknesse / lechery / at cardes / dyce / kels / &amp; suche vnlaufull games: in chidyng braulynge / quarellyng / fyghtynge / and murder / than on the holy days? And of howe folysshe iugemēt and clene out of order are we here in this thyng? If any man on the holyday be dronken from morne to nyght: if he haue cleued to an hoore: if he haue vsed vnlaufull games / no man putteth him to any busynes or trou ble: if he haue sowed but a shoe / he is accused as an heretyke. I say nat these thynges bycause I wolde that the lay people shulde dispyse the holydayes / 

but bycause me thynketh / that the sheꝑdes of the church shulde do very wel / if they vtterly dyd put downe suche maner halydayes / the sonday onely excepted / &amp; a fewe other prīcipal dayes / &amp; if in the same which they leaue vnput down / they dyd suffre ye pore people after masse and the preachyng / if nede requyred with their work &amp; labour / to sucour their chyldren &amp; housholde 
                  〈◊〉
                tes / or els to gete somwhat besydes that / to besto we vpon poore folke. But nowe oftentymes / whan after an hole monehes rayne / fortuneth one fayre day: the husbāde man is cōpelled to suffre his corne which is felde or cutte downe / to lye &amp; rote in the feldes / which in that same fayre day he myght haue caryed in to his barne / &amp; that bycause of suche holy dayes / whiche were neuer made by the auctorite of the olde fathers / but

brought in (to say no worse / nor to go any nerer the truth) by ye carnal affectiōs of certayn men. These thī
               ges at the fyrste begynnynge crepe in by lytel &amp; lytel / vnder the coloure or apparaūce of honestie &amp; vertue. Afterwardes they spring &amp; flowen in more plentuously. At the laste / whan they be ones cōfyrmed &amp; strē
               thed by vsage &amp; custome / they raign and occupyen tyranny / so that than they can nat scarcely be layde down or taken away / without great trou ble &amp; moche strife. Wherfore the bysshops ought nat to loke besyde these thinges / but dilygently &amp; straitly to loke vpon them at their fyrst comīg in / for generally what so euer partayneth to the lawes of man / are as remedies or salues vnto sycknesses or sores: &amp; euyn so are they to be attēpred &amp; applyed to the present state of tymes &amp; thynges. There be many

thynges / whiche in olde tyme it was a good &amp; godly thyng to instytute &amp; ordeyn / whiche selfe same 
                  〈◊〉
                ges afterwarde for some occasyon spronge vp / &amp; for the qualyte of tymes &amp; of mens maners chaunged / to be abrogated &amp; dysanulled / were a more godly thyng: whiche thyng for al that ought not to be done / by the rasshe presūption of the people / but by the auctoryte of the rulers / that al sedition &amp; stryfe might be auoyded / and the cōmen custome so chaūged / that vnytie &amp; cōcorde were nat broken / which thing lest it mizt happen / prouisyon is to be made by the delygēce of the bysshops / whom it is nat mete any longer to stoppe their eares &amp; to wexe 
                  〈◊〉
                / at ye iust and rightful cōplayntes of the people: Parauēture the same iugemēt is to be gyuen of ye wedlocke of prestes.  In the olde tyme / as prestes

were very fewe in nombre: so were they very holy in their lyuyng. The same that they myght the more frely gyue attēdaunce to holy excercises &amp; pastymes / wyllyng without any cō pulsyon / kepte them selfes chaste. And verely / so great loue of chastite was among the fathers in ye olde tyme / that certayn of thē were lothe to suffre any chrysten man to mary a wyfe / if he had ben vnmaryed at the tyme of his baptyme: And moche more lothe were they to suffre any to mary the seconde wyfe. Than that thyng whiche semed cōmenda vse &amp; alowable in bisshops &amp; preestꝭ was translated vnto the deacons / &amp; at the last to subdeacons also. The custome wyllyngly receyued / was in conclusyon confyrmed and stablysshed by the authorite of the bysshoppes. In the meane tyme the nō
               bre of preestes encreased and the holy

lyueng of them decreased. Howe many swarmes of preestes are notysshed in monasteries? howe many in colages? &amp; besydes these there is an innumerable multytude of p̄
               stes eueri where. And among so ma ny / ho we gret scarcenesse is there of them which lyueth chastely? I speke of them whiche kepeth concubynes opēly at home in the stede of wyues for I do not no we touche nor medel with the mysteries of ye more secrete pleasures of the flesshe. I do speke of those thīges onely / which be opē
               ly knowen to ye cōmen people. And though we do knowe these thynges wel ynough / yet are we in admyttī
               ge &amp; receyuyng them to holy orders very easy / &amp; in the releasyng of the cōstitution / whiche forbyddeth preestes to haue wyues / very harde and strayte / whan Paule teacheth clene cōtrariwise / that no man is swiftly

to be promoted to holy orders / &amp; in many places / dilygently prescribeth and apoynteth what maner men p̄
               stes ought to be / what maner men deacons: but as cōcernyng lyueng sole without wyues / neither Christe neyther the apostels haue apoynted or sette any lawe in holy scrypture / watchyng all the nyght long at the toumbes of martyrs / which was in the olde tyme receyued &amp; vsed by the cōmen custom of christen men / and that certayne hūdred yeres dyd contynue / the churche hath putte down many dayes ago. Fastyng wont to be prolōged &amp; contynewed vntyl euī tyde / the churche hath translated to noon. And many other thyngꝭ for necessary causes rissen &amp; sprong vp the churche hath chaūged. Why do we here cleue faste so obstynately to the cōstytution of man / namely seyng that so many causes doth re
                  
                     
                  
                  que
               re

a chaūge. For fyrst a great parte of the preestes lyueth with yuel fame / and with very vnquyete conscience entreate they &amp; dealeth with the holy mysteries. Furthermore / a gret ꝑte of the frute whiche shulde springe &amp; ryse of thē peryssheth / bycause their doctryne is dispysed of ye people / for their open shameful lyueng. But if to them whiche can not lyue chast lycence were graunted to mary wyues: both they shulde lyue more qui etely / &amp; with authorite shulde preche the worde of god / the people regarding their doctryn: &amp; they shlude ꝓuyde dilygently that their chyldren were brought vp honestly / &amp; in lernyng: neyther the one sorte of them shulde be shame &amp; rebuke to ye other
            I speke nat these thynges because I couete or entende to be a capitayn or a defender to those preestes / whiche nowe of late without the authorite

of ye bysshops / hath begon to be maryed men hauyng wyues / but to exhorte the gouernours of ye church and put them in remēbraūce to cōsy der &amp; ponder wel / whether it be expe dient that the olde constitution were applyed to the ꝓfyte of ye tyme that now is. In ye mean season I wolde also that the bysshops were put ī remembraūce / nat to receyue so rassh ly without probation / who so euer wol come vnto the order of preestes Lykewise I thinke that other are to be warned / that they examyne their owne selues dilygētly / whether they were able &amp; mete to execute ye offyce whiche they do take vpon them and that they take nat vpon them selues the charge &amp; burthen of so gret a ꝑsession for cause of lucre / or because they wolde lyue ydely &amp; in ease / pur chasyng bothe dampnation to their owne soules / &amp; rebuke &amp; shame / or

sclaūder to the churche. Moreouer / who so euer are consecrated &amp; made preestes al redy / although the bissho pes dyd open the way to matrymony / yet I wolde aduyse &amp; coūsayle them / yt they do nat entangle thē sel ues sodeynly &amp; without aduysemēt with wedlocke / lest it might fortune them to be vexed with double repen taūce / that is / both of preesthod &amp; of mariage. It is a great parte of chastite / a man to be wyllynge with al his herte &amp; mynde to be chast. Ther is nothyng more to be wysshed &amp; desyred / than that a preest without cō
               braūce of matrymony / at lyberte / &amp; hole / do serue his lorde god. But if whan al remedyes hath bén assayde non can helpe / neither the rebellyon of the flesshe can be ouercome / than it remayneth that he lyue chastely with one woman / hauynge a wyfe for a remedy &amp; nat for voluptuous

pleasure / enforcyng him selfe in the mean season to the vttermost of his power / to recōpence &amp; make amendes for the infirmyte of the flesshe / with other vertuous lyueng &amp; holy studies &amp; workes / for so shal al men ꝑceyue that a wyfe was sought sor necessyce / &amp; nat for voluptuousnes.
            And I doute nat / but yt the moste parte of the bysshoppes parceyueth right wel that these thynges ar euen so as I do say: but I feare leste in this thyng also / lucre doth withstād and be a lettynge / that we may nat folowe that thynge / whiche we do se and perceyue to be best: If the bysshoppes wolde go about to chaūge the cōstitution / their offycers ī their courtes parauenture wolde grudge and crye agaynste it / whiche feleth more profyte &amp; auaūtage to growe of preestes concubynes / than wolde growe of their wyues. But it is agayust

right &amp; reason / yt lure shulde bere so gret a swynge among vs / yt for it we shuld nat iuge indyfferētly and make iust prouisyon for Christes ministers / in a mater of so gret weight &amp; value. There are many other thynges of this kynde or sort / but lette these two afore rehersed / be putte for cause of example.
             Nowe I returne agayne to speke of fastyng / if any man be so strō ge that he can mesure &amp; tempre hym selfe by contynuall sobreuesse: this man hath no great nede of fastynge cōmaūded / excepte for a season the wrath of god were to be peesed with suche maner sacrifice. But you wyl say: certayn dayes of fastynge are apoynted &amp; cōmaunded for the rude and vnlerned persons. I am wel cō tentes lette that be coūted tollerable. But they cōmaūde &amp; apoynt 
                  〈◊〉
                one refection or meale in ye day / they

do assygne also what kynde of meates we shal vse. Neither they thinke this ynough / but they thretten moreouer euerlastyng dānation / to who so euer shal breake the custom brought in by men. For after such maner &amp; facion / certayne curates doth denoūce &amp; cōmaūde the fastyng dayes to the people: I wote nat whether they do it accordyng to the myndes &amp; wylles of the bysshops / or els no. Neither yet thynke they al this sufficiēt / but besydꝭ this they drawe and hale to punysshmēt / as it were one that had slayn his own father: who so euer hath tasted of a pigges flesshe in stede of fyssh mete. I sayd at the begynnīge / that disobediēce &amp; sedicious presūption is worthy eueriwhere of great punysshmēt. Neyther do I pleade any such maner of cause / or defende them which are begynners of debate or stryfe: but yet

neuertheles / me semeth that this iugement is nat onely vngētel / but al so folysshe &amp; out of order. Fyrst fastyng was cōmaūded: this was the chefe &amp; prīcipal poynt of the mater. To eate suche &amp; suche meates / was but an accessorie or secōdary thyng / Nowe they suppe eueriwhere generally on ye fasting dayes / &amp; no man is greued with it / neither maketh any gret mater therof / but if any mā haue tasted any flesshe / euery man cryeth out &amp; wōdreth / as though heuen / erthe / &amp; see / and al shulde go to gider / sayeng / the state of ye churche is decayde &amp; lyke to fal / heresyes encreaseth &amp; ryseth a flote: To suppe no man nedeth any pardon. That it may be lauful to eate flessh or egges / a pardon or dispensation must be bought of the pope of Rome. 
            So that thynge whiche draweth more nere in lyknesse to the supersti

tion of the ceremonyes of the iewes lawe / &amp; which is al togyder such ma ner a thyng / that a man might wor thely marueyle / that it hath ben so greatly receyued &amp; vsed of vs chrysten men / whiche do defye &amp; abhorre 
                  〈◊〉
                / &amp; other ceremonyes of the iewes (I mean choise of metes) We do greatly sette by / defendyng it stiffely with tothe &amp; nayle. And fastyng / whiche is a thyng more agre ynge with the doctryne of Christ / &amp; whiche helpeth more to the exercises of trewe vertue &amp; holynesse / we suffre to be abolysshed &amp; weare oute of vse: For albeit that prayer is the sa crifyce proꝑly belōgynge to christen men: whose felowe &amp; companion is fastyng / bicause these two / prayer &amp; fastyng / bothe in the gospels &amp; also in the epistels of ye apostels / almost alway are coupled togyder (for by fastyng the mynde is pourged and

strengthed / that the prayer might be pure / feruēt / &amp; lusty) yet in ye choise of meates / we holde faster the cōstitution of man / &amp; more toughlye do cleue vnto it / than in fastyng: how be it the christen men are also charged &amp; loden with more often fastes / than euer were the iewes.  Of the kyndes of meates / Christ him selfe sayde: What so euer gothe in at the mouthe / defyleth nat the man. And Paule nat disagreyng frō his maister / sayth: that ye kyngdom of god is nat mete &amp; drike. But in ye choise of meates / howe moche more greuous &amp; paynful is our burthen / thā was the iewes? for vnto thē it was lauful to eate euery kynde of fyfsh / of al maner foure foted beestes / of al maner foules / the best &amp; most hol somest. To vs it is forbydden to ete any maner flesshe at al / for a great ꝑte of the yere. And cōsyder I pray

you / ho we curious hath ben in this thynge / either the custome or els the authorite of our elders. At certayn tymes nothige is forbidden but one ly the eatyng of flesshe: somtyme it is lauful to eate bothe the oumbles and the satte: at another tyme but only the fatte or brewes: at another tyme it is not lauful to tast any ꝑte either of foule or els of beest lyuyng on the erthe. And here also ryseth ve ry many questions / ho we farre the signification of this worde flesshe / doth stretch or reche: for there be certayne beestes belōgyng to ye see / nat vnlyke to the beestes lyueng on the erthe: as Porpasses / seales / dogges and certayn lyueth both on ye lande and ī the water / somtyme in the one and somtyme in the other / as castor an otter. Moreouer they dispute about cocles / snayles / &amp; frogges / whe ther they be flesshe or nat. Agayne

some dayes / it is ꝑmytted &amp; vnlauful to eate egges / butter / chese / mylke: Another tyme / butter / mylke / &amp; chese / but nat egges. There be certayn dayes in whiche it is nat lauful to touche any of these thinges at 
                  〈◊〉
               . There be some dayes also / ī whi che it is forbydden to eate what so euer hath ones bron lyfe: so ye no we it is a great doute / whether it be lau ful to eate spōges / whiche (as Aristotel iugeth) hath felyng / &amp; be sensyble creatures: &amp; ther be some men whiche byndeth them selues / to fast to breed &amp; water onely. Though we do graūt yt these thynges are nat to be dispysed / 
                  〈◊〉
                who seeth nat / howe colde thynges they are / &amp; very tryfels / if they be cōpared to the precep tes of the gospel / whervpon we ought chefely &amp; prīcipally to sette oure care &amp; thought. Moreouer it is to be cōsydred / whether to exacte these

thinges of al men / so straitly &amp; so ri gorously dothe agree to the lybertie of the gospel / whiche Paule so 
                  〈◊〉
                defendeth.  Nowe lette vs se howe trewe it is euyn in this thin ge also / that whiche Paule sayth.
            Bodily exercitation is profitable but for lytel / good lyueng or in warde holynesse is profitable to al thī
               ges. No dayes hath the cokes more busynesse &amp; labour in the kechyns / than on the fysshe dayes / neither at any tyme is there more ordynaunce or greatter coste made to fare wel.
            So it is brought to passe / that the poore men be hūgry / &amp; the rich men lyueth more desycately.  Who had nat leauer eate Sturgion / trout / or lamprey: thā bacon hardened with smoke / or tough mutton? And among these thynges also / which are nat flesshe / there be many thynges whiche are more norisshynge than

befe or mutton: as whelkes / coccles and other thynges many. ye / &amp; prouoketh &amp; styreth more to lust of flesshely pleasure. And a mā 
               
                  〈◊〉
                fynde certayn thinges that doth ye same euyn amōg herbes &amp; frutes of trees also. What auayleth it to abstayne from mutton / if thou 
                  〈◊〉
                thy bely with rocket / dates / fygges / &amp; 
                  〈◊〉
                / musshernes / artickchouhges / &amp; such other thynges / which kyndleth the genitales more with wāton lust than hennes or pullettes? Sucket maketh the body more stronge &amp; lusty than befe dothe: &amp; yet non of all these thynges is forbydden. By this meanes it is brought to passe / that they whiche be poore &amp; of smal substaūce / be greued &amp; payned with suche cōstitutions whā they haue leste nede: &amp; the riche men through occasyon are called &amp; prouoked to more pleasures &amp; deyntie fare: Some mē
               
wys saye. This is caused through our own faute / I graūt: And ther fore parauenture ought suche thynges to be taken awaye / whan we pceyue more hurt thā good to growe of them. And it semeth nat very mo the more frute to come of fastynge / for they which be poore or weake of body / are fore greued with long fastyng. On ye othersyde / they whiche be stronge &amp; haue wher with / vitayleth them selues &amp; fylleth their bely with that / whiche were suffyciēt for thre dayes / so that after dyner they are mete for nothynge / but onely to slepe. And yet fastynge is ordeyned to be vsed for this cause most chesely / that the spirite shulde be the lesse cōbred or holde down with ye weight or burden of the body. What nedeth it here to reherse diuers diseases and sicknesses / ye weaknesse of olde men and yonge chyldren / pouertie / &amp; the

certayn peculyar nature &amp; complection of bodies / so that to some men the fasting of a sewe houres is deth ye / whan they be hole / &amp; to some al maner fysshe is as a Scorpion or a snake / or any venomous beest is to other. Moreouer in such countreys where is gret scarcenesse or lacke of fyssh / to forbydde ye eatyng of flessh What other thyng is it / than to com maūde the people to famysshe them selues? In so great dyuersyte &amp; inequalite / than of regions / of bodyes / of cōplexions / of ages: It appereth euidētly ynough / how many be gre ued with the lawe / whiche (as they wene) is equale &amp; indifferent to all men. There be some bodies whiche wyll be in good plyte / ye / &amp; ranke &amp; wanton though they were fedde 
                  〈◊〉
                hay. Agayne some there be / whiche scarsly are kept a lyue / though they be fcdde with partriches &amp; fesaūtes.

If the decree dyd cōmaunde / that in these fastynge dayes / the riche men shulde vse tēperaunce &amp; measure in their fare / &amp; that whiche they withdrawe frō their own tables of their wont fare / to be sent to poore folke for their refresshynge: than shulde there be made equalyte / &amp; the cōstytution shulde fauoure somwhat of Christes gospel. Nowe is that fulfylled and done eueriwhere / whiche Paule sayd, One is hungry / &amp; ano ther is dronken or to ful. The chaū
               ge of meates is apleasure to ye riche men / &amp; a remedy agaynst lothsomnesse or gluttyng / neither at any tyme do they fare better and fede more dayntilye / than whan they abstayn from they eatyng of flesshe. But in the meane season the pore husbande man gnawynge on a rawe pasnyp rote or on a leke / for lacke of other sole or cates / eateth ther with blacke

breed of the coursest sorte that can or may be made. And in stede of the meth / bragot / or ypocras of ye riche men / he 
                  〈◊〉
                sower whay or water of the podle / hauyng moche a do in the meane season to susteyne his wyfe / his chyldren / &amp; the resydue of his housholde meyny with cōtynual swette &amp; labour. Fynally the ma ners of men is come to that poynte nowe a dayes / that these thīges greueth thē onely / for whose cause they were nat so greatly instytuted &amp; ordayned / &amp; doth nothyng apertayne to them / for whose cause they were chefely ordayned. Sōe mā wyl say if any man be greued or ouer soore loden with these thynges / there is re medy ynough / wherby he may be ea sed. Howe I praye you? he may pur chace a lycence to eate flesshe of the bysshoppe of Rome. Thou spekest gayly wel. But neither al men haue

leayser to tonne to Rome / neyther al men haue plentie of money / wherwith they myght bye such pardons. And here agayne / it is comen to passe / yt to riche men (whiche had most nede to be forbydden the etyng of flesshe / &amp; whiche had moste nede to fast) the cōstitution is released al most al togyder for money / and the greuous yoke &amp; heuy burden lyeth onely on their neckes / which at pore and socoursesse.  Moreouer I do maruayle greatly in the meane season at this / that the authorite to release suche maner cōstitutions is re serued &amp; lefte onely to the bysshoppe of Rome / for so thynketh the cōmen people. Me semeth after my poore iugement / it were more conuenyent that authorite to dispence with men for such cōstitutions were gyuen to the curates (which ar succeded in to the roumes of the bisshops / as cōcer

nyng payns and labours: for they may easely knowe ye state of euery man / the plyte of ye body / the riches or habilyte / ye / &amp; the very mynde al so) Namely seyng these 
                  〈◊〉
                doth nat so greatly helpe to trewe holynesse &amp; vertuous lyueng. To them is cōmitted &amp; betaken the dyspensation &amp; besto wynge of Christes gospel: to them is gyuen power to mynister the sacramētes of the church / and authorite to here cōfessyons / &amp; to assoyle also from greuous synnes &amp; enormyties. It is lauful for them / ye &amp; they must nedes / puttīge their lyues in ieoꝑdy / be present and nere them whiche be sycke of the pestylence / or els any other sylthy / stī
               kyng / &amp; abhomynable diseases. 
            Why than is denyed to them ye authorite to gyue lycence to eate suche meates / whiche the weaknesse &amp; feblenesse of some persons requireth?

If the curate be vnmete to dyspence these smale trisles / certainly than is there great faute in the bysshoppes / whiche hath cōmytted the flocke of Christ to such maner persone. But if the curate be a mete &amp; able ꝑson / to whom the greatter &amp; more weigh ty thynges also might be cōmytted / it must nedes be that here lyeth hyd some secrete 
                  〈◊〉
                / for whose cau se these smaller and lyghter thinges may nat be cōmytted to the same ꝑsone also. But here agayne me thī
               keth / There the lucre &amp; aduauntage of certayne persons / redy to grudge and speke agaynst me: And wolde god that this cāker were clene scoured out of Christes churche / whiche suffreth nothynge any where to be pure / holy / &amp; vncorrupte / for cācred couytousnesse is the causer that the cōstitutions ordayned as a mean &amp; an helpe to godly lyueng / are no we

welnere nothynge els / but snares &amp; grynnes mete to catche money with al.  What auayleth it that so many sharpe &amp; strayte lawes hath ben made of the election of bisshops / ab bottes / &amp; other prelates &amp; rulers of the church: yf no we eueri where for money gyuen / the election is outher corrupted or els excluded. We rede that a tyrant of Sicilya called Dionisyus / gaue many lawes to his subiectes / &amp; whan they were publys shed &amp; cōmenly knowen / he wynked or loked besyde the trāsgressours of them for the nonce / vntyl at the last whan no man regarded them / neyther mystrusted any thing / he had a great meyny in daūger of thē. So the lawes were to hi as nettes / wher with he hunted for a pray. But god forbydde / that Christes vycars for like purpose / other shulde charge or lede ye people with newe cōstytutiōs

or els abuse the decrees of ye olde fathers. Without doute / nede there is of cōstitutyons made by them whiche are in authorite. And it chaūceth oftentpmes / that for certayn special causes / it were expedient &amp; profytable / that the rigoure &amp; straightnesse of the cōmen sawe were released / so that it were nat don eueriwhere / nei ther for sylthy lucre of money / neyther without discretion or iugement but for a great welth and profyte.
            It shulde be greatly profytable &amp; appertaynyng vnto ye purite of the doctryne / &amp; lyueng of the churche / if no releasyug or dispensatyon of the lawe were to be solde / &amp; that power to dispēce were cōmytted to thē / whi che might knowe the qualyte &amp; state of the person / whiche shulde enioye the dispēsation. Nowe to obtayne dispēsation / in a maner thou nedest nothyng els / but to shewe thy name

and pay thy money. If the cause be iuste &amp; suffycient / why is money required? if the cause be nat rightful what helpeth the dispensatyon?  Moreouer in some thinges I might vse this reason parauenture / if the cause be resonable &amp; laufull / what nede is there of a dispēsation? if the cause be not honeste &amp; riztful / what auayleth any dispensation?  The pope cōmaūdeth fastynge / but (as I wene) his mynde &amp; wyl is nat / ye yonge children / or very aged psons / sickely persons / or they whiche are diseased / shulde be boūde with this lawe / neither (to speke generally) any suche psons / whiche coulde nat faste without their excedynge great hurte. Here than where is a certayn and euydent cause / no nede is to release the lawe / but to interprete it 
                  〈◊〉
                ther. In a doutful cause / whō shuldest thou 
                  〈◊〉
                counsayle of / rather

than of thyne owne curate / or ye ordinary bisshop? If thou refusest his iugement to whom thou arte knowen / thou vttrest &amp; shewest thy corrupte cōscience. But if other hatered or ignorāce / or els any other thī
               ge doth lette / that he wyl nat graūt the rightfull dispēsation: lette than the way be open to haue socour and helpe of the archbysshop / or the bysshop of Rome. The processe selfe of oure disputation moueth vs &amp; putteth vs in remēbraunce most vertuous father / to cōsyder in fewe wordes / howe straitely such cōstitutiōs dothe bynde vs / whiche pertayneth onely to mānes lawe / of the which sorte no man wyl deny the popes decrees to be / whiche cōcerneth fastīg / choise of meates / and the wedlocke and mariage of prestes / for of other thynges I dispute nat.  There is some man which refuseth to socour

and helpe his father / beyng olde / sic ke &amp; nedy / with his riches or seruyce whan he hath ynoughe wherof he might do it. The bysshop commaū deth him to socoure his father / teachyng &amp; declarynge that honoure in the cōmaūdement of god (whan he byddeth vs honoure our father and mother) is vnderstande socour and helpe or relefe / &amp; not puttynge of the cappe or gyueng place / or goīge out of the waye. If this man refuse to obey / it is no doute but that he maketh hym selfe in dan̄ger of the fyre of helle. Agayne / if any man be at debate with his neighboure / &amp; if he whiche hath offended or hurte the other hath repēted / desyring forgyue nesse &amp; redy to make amēdes for the iniury whiche he hathe done: If he whiche is offended or hurte wolde re fuse to obey the bysshop / cōmaundyng him to remytte the vēgeaunce

and to be at one agayne wt his neighbour: It can not be douted / but that for this disobediēce / he byndeth him selfe to the fyre of hell. Why so? Bycause this that the bysshop commaūdeth / he cōmaūdeth it accordīg to the doctryne of the gospel / &amp; dothe rather offre &amp; put to him the cōmaū dement of Christ / than his own cō
               maūdemēt. But whether the same thyng be done in these thīges / wherof we nowe do speke: let vs cōsyder for what so euer I shall say I wyll speke it / nat as one affyrmyng / but as one inquiryng &amp; serchynge out yt truthe afore yt a bysshop / both most vertuous &amp; euyn so most exellently lerned. This is of suretie / that the most parte of these thynges / wherof we do nowe speke / came ī fyrst and were brought vp by custom. Nowe whom custome dothe bynde / and in 
                  〈◊〉
                thīges / &amp; howe forforth / whā
               
and howe longe: it where somwhat to long here to discusse.  Fyrste of al / this thynge me semeth might be proued by reason / that a custom bideth no man more straitly / thā their mynde &amp; wyl was / whiche were the begynners &amp; fyrst bryngers vp of ye custom: Let be excepted in ye meane season ye hurtyng of other mens cō
               science / &amp; contempte or dispisynge. It is to be beleued / that they whiche fyrst of their owne free wylles / layd downe their substaūce &amp; riches at ye seete of the apostels / dyd it for that purpose / that who so euer wold nat do 
                  〈◊〉
                / shulde be boūde to euer lastynge payne. Or that they whiche fyrst began to abstayn from the eatyng of flesshe / wolde be the begī
               ners of this custome / with ye mynde and wil / that who so euer afterwar de wolde nat do the same / shulde be boūde to euerlastyng deth. Nay / I

wene rather yt suche was their mide and suche their cōmunication / that if they had sene any mā beyng wea ke &amp; feble in body / whiche prouoked by their exāple / wold haue enforced to do the same: they wolde haue mo nysshed and coūseyled hym by these wordes. Trewly beloued brother / I whiche haue a body rebellious to the spirite / nat without cause do cha stice &amp; punysshe my flesshe with fastes: Thou hast a body both weake &amp; febly / &amp; also obedyent ynough to the spirite / whose weaknesse is to be cured / rather than wantōnesse to be kepte vnder &amp; punysshed. Wherfore prouyde &amp; se for the helth of thy body / takyng suche meates mesura bly / &amp; with gyueng thāges to god / whiche are mete for the / that thy body may ye more lustely &amp; coragiously do seruyce to his spirite. After su che facyon doth Paule coūsayle his

welbeloued Timothe / that he shuld vse a lytel wyne for the weaknesse of his stomake / &amp; often sickenesse &amp; diseases. Nowe whether custome / cōtrary to the wyl &amp; myndes of thē which haue ben the begynners of 
                  〈◊〉
                dothe bynde to ony synne (lykewise as whan any mā monyssheth another of his mysdede / although he do it nat for thentent that he whiche is monysshed shulde synne more greuously: yet he whiche monysshed of his synne doth nat repent &amp; amēde / synneth more greuously thā he dyd before) it is nat mete tyme nowe to discusse. This onely is to be consy dred / whether in these thynges / whiche beynge of them selfe lauful / are made vnlauful / onely by the cōstytution of man: it was the mynde &amp; wyl of the bysshops &amp; popes / whan they dyd cōfyrme the custome receyued &amp; vsed / that who so euer / nat of

any malycious cōtempte / but thorough frayltie &amp; negligence dyd nat obserue &amp; kepte the custom / shuld be boūde to ye fyre of hel. god is nat so cruel or vēgeable / ye for euery lyght faute he wyl caste them in to helle / whom he hath redemed wt his own blode: He knoweth the weaknesse &amp; fraylte of his creature / &amp; he suffreth many thynges in vs / afore that he wyllcutte vs awaye from the body of his own sonne. But who so euer cōmytteth a deedly synne / of the mē bre of Christ / is made the mēbre of the deuyl: of the heyre of heuēly lyfe is made yt heyre of euerlastyng fyre Seynge than that the bysshops are succeded in to the roume of him / whi che secheth to haue all men saued / &amp; to distroy no man: and if they bere fatherly affection towarde their flo cke / cōsydering also that their selues are men frayle &amp; weake / &amp; in many

thynges nedyng the mercy of god.  Howe is it lykely to be trewe that they were of this mynde / that they wolde with their cōstitutions made by them / whiche are nought els but men / bynde their brethern &amp; sonnes to euerlastyng payne? namely seīg they may knowe euyn by their own myndes / that the myndes of men be prone &amp; redy to synne. ye / &amp; oftenty mes are wonte to be styred &amp; prouoked to lust of synnyng / so moche the more bycause they are forbydden.
            Temporal &amp; laye princes / whiche beareth a swerde by their office / and whiche with feare &amp; punysshmētes by their professyon / holdeth the people backe from rōnyng to moche at large / yet wolde they nat although they myght / the lawes whiche they ordayn &amp; make / to be rigorus / that the transgressour &amp; breaker of them shulde forth with lese his heed. And

yet can they kylle nothyng els / but the body onely. And do the bysshopes / whose parte is to saue mē with the swerde of the worde of god / for a lytes meate or drinke / whiche Crist hath gyuen vs lyberte to take / re
                  
                     
                  
                  que
               re that the breker of their constitution shulde go bothe body &amp; soule in to yt fyre of hesle: namely seynge that it lyeth in their power / nat to cast on this bōde or snare / nor to bring men in to this great paryl &amp; icopardy.
             Moreouer ye bondes of the Euā gelical charite / is greter than ye bon des of kynred: &amp; the bondes of ye spi rite / than the bōdes of the flesshe: &amp; the bondes of god / than of nature. But what carnal father was there euer so cruel agaynst his sonnes / ye is he had forbydden them ye drīkyng of wyne / lest at any tyme ye drīkyng vnmesurably might cast them selues in to a feuer / he wolde requyre / 

that this his forbyddynge shulde be of so great strēgth / that if they dyd nat obey it / they shulde suffre dethe: namely seyng that they might drīke wyne safely ynough &amp; without any hurte / so they drinke it mesurably.
            No doute of it / he wolde forbeare and refrayne from gyueng any suche cōmaūdement / if he knewe that his sonnes shulde be in daūger of so great paryl / &amp; he had leuer that they shulde sal in to some feuer / than to ronne in to ieoꝑdy of theyr lyfe. Be sydes this / I do nat suppose ye there is any man but he wyl graunt / that the lawes of god which he him selfe made &amp; ordayned / are more to be re graded &amp; set by / than ye lawes made by men: but nat al the lawes of the olde Testament gyuen of god / dyd bynde in the olde tyme to deedly syn no / certayn of them boūde nat to any synne at al (if we gyue credence

to famous dyuines) of the whiche sorte I suppose it was / if any man had touched carion of any best whi che was nat slavne / but dyed by the owne accorde. And shal the bysshop which is nat the authour &amp; 
                  〈◊〉
                / but ye stewarde &amp; minister of a more gentyl Testament / requyre this / that al maner constytutions of his makyng shulde bynde his subiectes to the payne of euerlastynge fyre?
            I wylcome to the authorite of the apostels / whiche hath alwayes ben so moche regarded &amp; set by / by ye cō
               sent of al Christen people. I dare nat be bolde to affyrme &amp; say playn ly / that what so euer thyng they dyd cōmaūde they cōmaūded it / wt that mynde &amp; wyl that they wolde euery transgressour therof to be boūde to the fyre of helle.  Paule in many places forbiddeth couytousnesse / lechery / wrathe cōtention / &amp; enuy by

name / puttyng to these wordes. We knowe / that they whiche doth suche thynges / shal nat possesse the kyng dome of god. And yet the 
                  〈◊〉
                graūteth &amp; confesseth nat euery ma ner wrathe to be deedly synne / neyther parauēture al maner of enuy.
             Agayn the same Paule straitely cōmaūded / that women shulde nat speke in the church or cōpany assem bled / lest that sexe somwhat proude and highe mynded / might chalenge to them selues any authorite in the presence of their husbādes. And yet I do nat thynke that he cōmaunded that / beyng of this mynde &amp; wyl / ye if any woman through infyrmyte longyng to that sexe / had spoken a ny thyng in the cōgregation for desyre to lerne / forth with she shulde be made bonde to ye fyre of helle. I put forth these thīges so / that yet neuertheles it may be free for euery man

to iuge / as he thynketh lyke. Laste of al / parauēture euyn in the commaundemētes of the gospel also / a mā may fynde certayn / which doth nat forth with bynde euery man to deedly synne. We se that ye fathers os ye orders of relygious men / dothe openly witnesse this of their cōstytutions (whiche for cōcorde &amp; equalyte to be had in their couentes / they nedefully do adde &amp; put to ye cōmaū demētes of ye gospel) that they wyll nat any person to be boūde be them nat so moche as to venyal synne.
            Wherfore by so moch the more I do marueyle greatly / that there be certayn of that sorte whiche can suffre rather their brother eyther to dye / or els to be veved &amp; tourmented with a disease / which is more greuous thā dethe / than they wolde sycēce hym to cate flesshe. I wyl nat here reherse that certayn dyuines &amp; those of the

famous sorte / hath affyrmed playn ly / that no mortal prelate can binde his subiecte by his precept to deedly synne / except that whiche he cōmaū deth / doth depēde of the lawe of god which proposition or sayeng at this present tyme / I do neither approue neither disproue. This thyng onely I wyl aske &amp; enquire: whyder al such maner cōstitutions doth binde to euerlastynge payne / or 
                  〈◊〉
                a certayn of them onely. If they al do bynde to euerlastynge payne / thā is the yoke of christen men very heuy and greuous / seyng that there is so many cōstitutions of the bysshops / but if certayn onely so doth bynde / I wolde desyre to knowe / by what marke a man myght dyscerne those whiche doth bynde / from those whi che doth nat bynde. You wyll say / they do bynde whan these termes ar put to: We cōmaunde &amp; charge. &amp;c.

But at Rome euery yere suche maner cōstitutions are made &amp; publys shed newe / that no spouse shal gyue to his spousesse any token or gyfte / aboue the valoure of. xii. ducates / for let this be put forthe bvcause of example. I demaūde nowe / if any man without any masyce or dispite of that cōstitution dyd gyue a token or gyfte of. xiii. ducates: dyde he synne deedly? You wyl answer (as I trowe) it semeth no. yet in these &amp; other more lyghter thynges also / is added alway besyde greuous synne the payne of excōmunication in the dede doyng. And yet there be dyuynes whiche sayth / that no man may be excōmunicate / but onely for such a trespas whiche is deedly synne afore god. But this disputation / whi ther the bysshop or pope maye in all maner thinges bynde their subiects to deedly synne / I wil passe ouer at

this tyme.  This I wyl aske &amp; demaūde / whether it be probable and lyke to be trewe / that the pope were of suche a mynde / that although he myght he wolde after suche maner charge &amp; lode his subiectes. Paule is angry &amp; myscōtent that any man iugeth his brother in meate or drīke and shal I for meate or drīke thrust downe my brother in to helle?
             Nowe what is the mynde of the Bysshoppes and popes in other thynges / lette vs leaue that vndyscussed at this tyme. Certaynlye in fastynge it is euydente and open / yt their wyl was nat to bynde al men by their precepte and decree. Wherfore than / do we beyng cruell iuges against our neighbour / other wise interprete the popes sawe / than accordyng to his owne mynde. For it is nothing lykely to be trewe that his mynde &amp; wyl was to bynde any

man to fastyng or to etyng of fissh / whiche coude nat do it / without the gret hynderaūce &amp; appeyring of his helth / or els ieoꝑdy of his lyfe. Therfore he byndeth no yonge chyldren / nat very aged men / nat them whiche be sicke / nat poore folke / and to make an ende / nat any other ꝑsons / whiche for some other cause can nat awaye with fastyng / &amp; moche lesse he byndeth thē to abstayne from the eatyng of flesshe.  These persons nowe rehersed / if they do eate / they seme to eate by the mynde &amp; wyll of him which was maker of the lawe. You wyl say / but in the meane season yuel occasyon is gyuen to leudly disposed persones / whiche vnder this pretēce &amp; colour / wyl eate / whā they haue no nede or resonable cause. If this paryl &amp; ieopardy wherof you do speke / were pertaynynge to murder or to some other great yuel

or mischefe / than wolde I holde wel with your sayeng.  Nowe I suppose it myght better be suffred / that syxe hundred dyd eate flesshe without necessyte / than that one person through suche suꝑstition / shulde be put in ieoꝑdy of his lyfe. Wherfore I cōmende the maner and custome vsed in Italy / where euen in ye lente season / is solde openly in the shambles (though of fewer than at other tymes) both veale / kydde / &amp; lambe lest any thyng myght be wantynge to them whiche were sicke / or might yuel forbeare eatynge of flesshe, Neither any man there noteth or rebuketh the byer or eater / although he appereth nat by any outwarde tokens / to be sycke or dyseased: for there be many causes which a man can nat perceyue by the coūteuaūce or face.

what so euer may be done wel and lausully / dronknesse / backbytyng fylthy cōmunication / &amp; rebaudrie: dothe verily declare &amp; she we a leude person / euyn accordyng to the rule of the gospel. For these thinges whiche in very dede are yuell thynges / whan they come from the mouthe / declareth the fountayne of the herte to be corrupte / from whens suche stynche is breathed forthe: And yet with such thynges we be but lyghtly offended or greued. ye otherwhyses we reioyce in them / &amp; cōmende &amp; alowe them. But he that doth eate flesshe / we do so defye &amp; abhorre / as though he were no longer a christen man: Natwithstandynge / that the gospell dothe forbydde to iuge any man in those thynges / whiche of thē sllues are nat are nat yuel. ye &amp; Paule also wylleth nat any mā to be iuged for meate or drynke. Therfore who so

euer eateth flesshe for a gret weighty cause / he synneth nat at al agaīst the lawe / for as moche as he hath done nothing cōtrary to the mynde of him / whiche hath made the lawe. He that eateth without necessyte / yf he do a mysse / he trespaseth but only agaynst the lawe of man. But he that cōdemneth his brother / he that backbyteth / he that sclaūdreth &amp; defameth his brother / doth synne and trespas / bothe agaynst the doctryne of the gospel / &amp; also agaynste ye precepte of the

                Paule: And in my iugement doth more greuously synne / than he shulde / if he dyd eate flesshe hole. x. yeres togyder. They cal them Lutherians and heretykes whiche doth eate flesshe. Nowe this is nat the eatynge of calues flesshe / but it is the

                &amp; eatynge of thy brothers flesshe.  Whether of these two thīges I besech you / is the

more greuous offence &amp; synn? And yet at that thyng whiche the authorite of ye gospel doth forbydde / whiche Paule the apostel also doth forbydde / no man is moued or greued / at these thynges whiche cōtrary to the doctryne of ye gospel / the custom of men hath brought in: We do so shyuer &amp; quake / as though the hole christian relygion shulde atones go to wrake for euer? But here in the meane season aryseth two diffyculties or doutes / of the whiche the one semeth to pertayne to order / ye other cōcernyng the hurtyng or

                of oure neighbours conscyence.
            I graunt / that an order is gretly to be regarded / in so moche that it were better to suffre euyn some tyrāny or crudesyte / than by troublī
               ge the order / to make a cōfusyon &amp; a great styrte in the worlde.  And Paule byddeth that mānes cōpany

to be eschewed whiche dothe lyue inordinately / troublyng the cōmen or der. And the same / lest we shulde gy ue any man occasyon to be offēded / cōmaūdeth vs to abstayne / nat one ly from that thynge whiche is yuel in dede / but also from al maner thī ge / whiche appereth to be yuel. But that an order may be had &amp; establys shed / &amp; by reason of order trāquilytie: It is 
                  〈◊〉
                that the heedes &amp; rulers haue their authorite sure and stable / &amp; that the people obey them non otherwyse / than the vycats or deputies of god. I graunt al these thynges to be very trewe. And Peter the apostel cōdemneth them / whi che folo wyng their own sensual ap petites / dispiseth the cōmen officers and rulers / &amp; suche as be set ī highe authorite: &amp; yet he speketh there / as farre as I parceyue / of the heed offycers &amp; prīces / whiche were 
                  〈◊〉
               
               
men &amp; infydels. Howe moche more than ought the authorite of the bysshops to be sure &amp; inuyolate / which if they be good / they are to be obeyd as the frendes of god: but if they be yuel / &amp; yet dothe teche those thynges which be ryght &amp; good: we ought to obey the doctryne whiche they teche. But if they be neither good / nor yet doth teche good thynges / yet in my iugement they are sō what to be suffred / left by troublynge the order of thynges / gretter incōuenyēce &amp; mischefe myght ryse. This counsayle wolde I gyue to the christen people. But if the wickednes of them shuld go so farforth / that it were intollera ble bothe to god &amp; man (which thig god forbydde euer to come to passe) Christ him selfe can make suche ma ner scourges &amp; whippes / wher with he may dryue out of his temple / suche as he lyste nat to be cōuersaunt

there. For lykewise as nat without great cōsyderation &amp; wysedome / the election of ye 
               
                  〈◊〉
                hath ben trās lated from the people to a fewe mēl so I do not holde with it / that ye olde examples shulde be renewed &amp; brought vp agayne / wherby the cōmen multytude dyde expel &amp; put downe their bisshops for euery litel cryme /  For we rede that Brice for ye surmyse of fornycation / &amp; vnchaste lyuyng with his laūdresse / was deposed by ye cōmen voice &amp; noyse of the people. But as Paule cōmaūdeth the wyues / that in al poyntes they shulde be obediēt to their husbādes / and haue them in reuerēce 
                  〈◊〉
                their lordes: And agayn on the other ꝑte counsayleth the husbādes that they shulde mesurably &amp; gētely vse their authorite towardes their wyues / re mēbring that they are their felowes and matches in Christ / &amp; the cōheri

               : So in lyke maner the heedes &amp; rulers of the church are to be monysshed &amp; counsaysed / that they do nat either abuse their autho rite &amp; power on the people / neyther turne the obediēce of the lympse peo ple / in to their own tyrāny. They ar shepe / but the shepe of Christ / rather than of the bysshops: they ar shepe but for those shepe that highest and heed shepherde hath shedde his precious blode: they are shepe / but so derely beloued of their lorde / ye whā one of them was gone a straye / he with careful dilygēce sought for it / and at the last whan he had founde it / he brought it agayn to his feldes vpon his owne sholders: They are shepe / but resonable shepe / &amp; in this

            Wherefore albeit that the bisshop cō pared to eche one by him selfe of the people is more exellent / &amp; (as Pau le

to be gretter &amp; more worshypful / he that serueth &amp; wayteth at the table / or he that sytteth at ye table. Is nat he the gretter (sayth Christ) whiche sytteth at the table? But the people are those chyldren &amp; sonnes of the spouse / whiche as honorable ꝑsons sytteth at the table or borde of ye gos pel. The prelates of the churche be ministers which standeth by / &amp; walketh to &amp; fro lokyng about / that no thyng be wantyng to any of the gestes syttyng at that borde / and that whiche they perceyue to be most cō

What aught the

bysshops to do / whiche accordynge to the mynde of saynt Hierome / are fathers / nat lordes / but mynisiers / to whom the dispensation &amp; mynystration of the mysteries of god / is cōmytted &amp; betaken / nat the authorite whiche also may fal in to synne as wel as other men / &amp; are ignorāt them selues in many thynges. Let the bysshops therfore rule &amp; gouern the people / but as a fader ruleth his children or sonnes / &amp; as the husbāde ruleth his welbeloued spousesse or wyfe. Neither let the bysshop wene that it is lauful for him to do what soeuer him lyst with his flocke / of ye whiche he shal gyue accōpte &amp; recke nyng to the heed shepherde / &amp; the ve ry pastor Christ.

discrete are offended without cause / and for thynges of smal value / vn tyl that they also do profyte &amp; grow vp to suche strength of spirite / that they be no lōger offended with those thinges / which of their own nature are neither good nor yuel.  Paule as concernynge the vse of meates / other whyles among the iewes was made as a iewe / to thende yt he myzt wynne the iewes to Christ. Agayne among the gētyles he became a gen tile / to wyn them also But it shulde be an vnsemely thing &amp; against rea son / if any man no we a dayes also wolde lykewise amōg the iewes become a iewe / abstaynyng from the meates whiche are forbydden &amp; nat lauful to be eaten among them / 
                  〈◊〉
                he myght ronnein to the hatered of the iewes. Ye moreouer Paule rebu keth Peter / by canse that (whan the doctryne of Christ was so publysshed

and sprede abrode / that it was mete &amp; accordynge for the iewes beyng taugh &amp; monisshed to haue forsaken &amp; caste away their superstitious weaknesse) yet he / lest he shuld haue offended the iewes / dyde withdrawe him selfe from the company of the gentyles / and wolde nat eate with them / and so auoydyng to offende the iewes / he fell in to a more greuous offendyng of the gentiles.
            That tyme was / as aman wolde say / the infancy and fyrst age of the gospel. And the relygion of ye lawe which they had lerned and receyued of their forefathers / &amp; whiche also was confyrmed by long vsage and custom / was so faste grounded and roted inwardly in ye myndes of the iewes / that this affection for a season was to be pardoned &amp; to be suf fred in them / for as moche as it dyd springe and ryse of an honest cause

and coulde nat sodainly be agayne 
                  〈◊〉
                out of the myndes os men. Moreouer of this offendyng / great ieopardy shulde haue folowed.  
            ☞ The nation of the iewes / which toughly cleued to the custome vsed of their forefathers / was tourned to the hatered of the gospel. The gentyles so hated and abhorred the bur thayn of Moyses lawe / that many of them coulde fynde in their hertes rather to haue renoūced Christe agayne / than to receyue the ceremonyes &amp; lawe of ye iewes. And whan nothyng is more abhomynable thā idolatry / yet he that dydeate of the flesshe whiche was offred in sacryfyce to an idole at that tyme / gaue a sykely occasyon to be suspected / as though he dyd fauour and agree to the suꝑstition of them / with whom he dyd eate. And yet cryeth Paule / euen in this also / ye lawe to be abro

gated and of no strength: he cryeth that an ydole is nothynge / that the flesshe offred to an idole is nothyng els / but as other flesshe is: he rebuketh that man / who so euer wyttīgly offendeth his brother with his eatyng. But agayne he chydeth hym / whiche iugeth another mānes conscience in meate or drynke / &amp; whiche speketh yuel of his brother for the meate sake / for the which he gyueth thankes to the goodnesse &amp; lyberalyte of the lorde / which hath created and made al thynges / to the behoue and vse of men. He scorneth the folysshe wysedome of them / whiche as though they had taught a certayne great thyng / dyd saye. Touch nat / taste nat / handyl nat. As the superstitious choyse of meates which the iewes vsed by the coūsayle &amp; authorite of Paule hath begon to 
                  〈◊〉
                dispi sed / after that ye gospel is nowe suffyciently

publysshed &amp; openly knowen. So of lykelyhode it semeth / yt the meate offred to an ydole / is to be dispysed / seyng that it is nowe suffyciently knowen / that christen men may with pure and clene conscience eate al maner of meates / accordyng to the necessyte of the body / gyueng thankes to him / whiche hath ordayned and prouyded al thynges yt are in this worlde / for his worshippers. Whan he him selse is lorde of al thin ges / and whiche wolde nothyng to be impure or vnclene to those persons / whyche be pure and clene. 
            Wherfore to conclude / seyng that the lauful cause to be offended / cesseth: Seyng also that the kyngdom of god is neither meate ne drinke / &amp; seyng that the abstaynyng from certayne meates / prouoketh the moste parte of ryche men to superfluyte &amp; delycate fare / &amp; dothe cruelly greue

and payn the poore men. It is to be consydred and loked on / whether we ought to stryue so greatly as we do for suche maner constitutions. 
             In that tyme wherof we spake before / the apostels for a season dyd that thing which they thought most expedient for the fortheraūce of the gospel / which than was yonge and newe begon. Somwhat they applyed them selues to the affectiōs of men / remaynynge of the maner of lyueng whiche they had vsed aforetyme. And that they so dyd / it was but for a season / of charite and not of right or necessyte / and they dyde nat so in al thinges nor at al tymes neither yet without spekyng agaīnst suche infyrmite / as we haue sayde before. But no we adayes / how for tuneth it that occasyon to be offēded is takenne of suche thynges / the vse wherof is nat forbydden by the gos

pel / but rather ye forbidders of them are condempned by the writynge of Paule the apostel. Forbyddynge (sayth he) the meates / whiche god hath created to be eaten / and sorbyd dyng to mary or wedde. Finally howe farforthe semeth the greuyng or offending of our neighbour to be auoyded? Paule dyd forbeare and abstayne from ye flesshe which was offred to an idole / but nat except he had ben warned afore / that it was sacrifyced to ydoles. But the same Paule dyde eate all maner meates / askyng no question / for hurtyng another mannes conscience. And yet in this thynge / wherof we do nowe speke / the offendyng of other mēnes consciēce myght be auoyded / without any great grefe or incōmodite: for he that for a season dyd refrayn from flesshe offred to an ydole / had other flesshe at hande which he mizt

               
                  〈◊〉
               . If any man dyd 
                  〈◊〉
                frō builes flesshe whiche was offred to Neptunus / he myght eate partrych or capon / whiche was nat offred to any false god: and yet dyd they nat so moche as abstayne from flesshe which was offred to idoles / but one ly whan they sawe occasion. Some man abstayned from swynes flessh and dyd eate a plouer. But nowe a dayes whan for ye most parte of the hole yere / the eatynge of al maner flesshe is forbydden: thynkest thou it right or reason / that I for ye weak nesse and superstityousnesse of this man or that / shulde stande in ieoꝑdy of my helth and of my lyfe / seing that by this tyme / all christen men ought to haue ben taught / that they shulde nat iuge their neyghbour by suche maner thynges? But if it seme to be / that chusten charite so mo che ought to apply it selfe to ye weke

nesse of vnlerned or superstycyous persones / that to auoyde the offendyng of them / we wolde haue hym whiche is stronge in conscyence / to ronne in to ieopardy of his helth or of his lyfe. Why do we nat yt same / in those thynges wherin is iust and manyfest occasyon of offendyng other men.  There be prelates of ye church / whiche whan they haue yere ly rentes and possessyons / so great / that they maye compare in rychesse with any kynges / yet neyther they do teache yt people / and besydes that lyueth wickedly / euyn in the open syght of the people / so that the vnler ned men are offended therby. But here in this thyng / we do nothynge regarde the offendynge of their consciences / but rather of the weake per sons. We do require so gret fyrmyte and strength / that they are cōmaun ded to beleue / excepte they had leauer

be counted heretykes / that what so euer thynge is done by them / outher whā they lose or bynde / or whā they blesse or curse / or els whā they graunt forth pardons or restrayne them / is of the same strength / as if it had be don by the apostel Paule / Andrewe or Iames.  And yet this offendynge of the people ryseth of a thyng which of the owne kynde and nature is so yuel / that though men wolde take none occasyon therof to be offended / yet ought it to be auoy ded and eschewed / for as moche as it offendeth the eyes of god. Besyde this / though al maner of backbytige appereth to eche mā for to be vnlauful / and a greate synne: yet in this thyng we do nat regarde the of fendyng of weake persons / but bol dely and strongly we folowe oure owne appetyte and affection.  In these thynges onely whiche are so

lauful / that who so euer forbyddeth them / nedeth great defence / leste he myght seme to do clene agaynste the doctryne of the gospel: so moche we do regarde the offendynge of weake persons / that for the folysshe superstition of them / we wolde haue our brother to stande in ieopardy of his lyfe / rather than to eate certayn metes / whiche are necessary for him.
            Is nat this to transgresse the com maundementes of god / for the traditions of men? I knowe right wel most exellent prelate / that your holynesse hath sayd a prety whyle ago for what entente are these so many thynges spoken? Is it to disalo we the choise of meates / whiche the vse and custome of the churche hathe alowed / and yet dothe alowe?  To speke ye truthe playnly / as I do 
                  〈◊〉
               : I wolde fayne that al thynges whiche are of this kynde and sorte / 

or els at the lestwise / the exaction of suche thynges were clene rydde out of the way / so yt what so euer were abated or taken away from ceremonyes / shulde be added to the exercyses and workes of trewe holynesse. And so that as moche as the iudaical and superstitious maner of lyuyng shulde decreace and be minisshed / so moche ye trewe christian maner of lyueng / myzt encreace and be augmented. But if the cōmen sorte of vnlerned persons / can nat vtterly be kepte in doyng their dewty / wt out suche maner of ceremonyes / yet I wolde nat the christian lyberte to be clogged with very many suche / I wolde nat the consciences to be so bounde / that they shulde beleue that they dyd deedly synne if they dyd eate / except it were don of a froward / a stubburne / and a disobedient mīde. I wolde nat that of an vnresonable

iugement and clene out of or der / those thynges shulde be so gretly regarded / whiche of them selues are almost of no value. And those thynges nothing regarded and sette by / without the whiche there can be no good lyueng accordyng to ye gos pel. But these thynges / seyng that they be fast rooted by vse &amp; custom: I wolde nat that they shulde be sedy ciouslye dispysed / but outher to be put downe by lytel and lytel / or els to be taken awaye by the authoryte of the heedes and rulers / but so taken away / that in the meane season the people shuld be called and exhor ted to better thynges. But here parauenture some man wyl obiecte &amp; laye agaynst me / that suche maner ceremonys / though they do nat moche good / or be nat greatly profytable / at the lestwyse they do no hurte / ye / and this ferforth dothe helpe to

good lyuenge / that they putte vs in remembraunce of trewe &amp; inwarde holynesse / and are as guydes or lea ders / to enduce the weake and vnler ned persones to trewe vertue / lykewise as the lawe of Moyses was to the iewes: And we do se / howe gret the weaknesse is of christen men also. The eatyng of flesshe forbydden putteth vs in remembraunce &amp; teacheth / that al ryote and superfluyte and what so euer thyng is wonte to folowe superfluyte / are to be auoyded and eschewed. Fastyng cōmaū ded / putteth vs in remēbraūce &amp; tea cheth / that we ought to abstayn frō al vyces &amp; synnes / for that onely is the 
                  〈◊〉
                that is pleasaunt &amp; acceptable to god. If this reason doth lyke and please so greatly / than let vs be circūcised also / seyng that circumcisyon bothe doth abate of the delecta tion &amp; pleasures in gendring / &amp; also

putteth vs in remēbraunce / that the herte &amp; mynde is to be circūcised / frō al grose &amp; carnal affections. Let vs than also slee bestes &amp; make sacryfice of them / for this thīg putteth vs in remēbraunce / that the brutyssh &amp; beestly affectiōs of our myndes / are to be tamed and subdued. But that we might be monysshed &amp; put in

                by such maner of

                res / it is suffycient for vs / that these thynges were in the olde tyme relygiously obserued of the iewes / for if trewe holynesse were nothyng hyndred by ceremonys / why doth Pau le so feruēntly eueriwhere fyght agaynst the ceremonyes: of the lawe of Moyeses? Of a certayntie / these thynges if there be to many of them and vnmesurably vsed / oppresseth the lyberte of the gospel. To put our trust &amp; confydēce in these thīges (as the most parte of the people dothe)

is the very pestylence &amp; dystructyon of trewe holynesse / for of these thyn ges / to backbyte thy brother / is the venyin &amp; poyson of the relygion of the gospel /  No doute of it / Paule parceyued these thynges very well / whan he so fercely kept warre 
                  〈◊〉
                the lawe of the iewes / beyng aboute to breake in or to approch nye to the maners &amp; lyueng of

                men. Ye / if I had layser / I coulde make you perceyue &amp; vnderstāde / yt euery grettest decay &amp; myscheues of the christen cōmen welth / hath spronge out &amp; had their begynnyng of ceremonyes. I do nat alowe ye stubber nesse &amp; disobedient myndes of these men / which openly &amp; scornfully / as in dispite of the cōmen custom / hath eaten flesshe. But so farsorth I dis alowe them / that I do iuge them to be taught / to be monysshed / &amp; if nede requyre / to be rebuked also / but

nat to be accused vnto the heed offycers &amp; rulers / as thoughe they were gyltie of murdrīge their own father or mother. &amp; my iugement is / yt this mater is rather to be dispised &amp; made lyght of / than to be greuously hā dsed. At the lest wise for this cause / lest of this sparke kyndled a gretter fyre might growe / &amp; more hatered a gaynst the clergy / which is to great / and ouer moche al redy. It doth displease me / what so euer thyng ꝑtayneth to sedition &amp; stryse. But yet if no man shulde resyst &amp; withstāde su che maner ceremonyes alwayes increacyng &amp; waxing more &amp; more / ye syberte of the gospel shulde be distro yed for euer / but there is no man to whom it is more cōuenyent to with stande them / than the heedes and ru lers of the church. So crope in by ly tel &amp; lytel ye custom / which hath made ye friday a fyssh day. Afterward

The lyberte of the gospel / ought nat wt suche thīges brought in out of mesure / to be called away from more earnest &amp; sadde studyes / and exercises or pastymes. ☞ And thus farforth be it spoken generally

of suche maner thynges / nat bycause I wolde defende those presūp tuous &amp; disobedyent persons / but ye your wysedom / after that the circū

What wise man wolde nat say that I had ben a murdrer of myne owne selfe / if I had abstayned from flesshe beyng in that case? He yt wyl folowe Erasmus / lette him solowe him in euery poynt / and he shal nat be blamed.

Nowe there remayneth one doute / as concernyng the offendyng of weake persons. I do nat deny but that christian chary

tie counsayleth / in euery thynge as moche as maye be / to prouyde that weake persons haue none occasyon gyuen to them wherfore they might be offended. I here Paule redy to abstayne from the eatyng of flesshe al his lyfe long / rather than that he wolde offende his neyghboure with his eatynge. But the same Paule / as we haue sayd before: doth chyde and rebuke those which

                their brother for meate or drinke. And in the meane season he reckeneth them to be most pestylent / whiche dyd for bydde to eate the meates whiche god hath ordeyned to the vse of man. 
            ☞ Why doste thou (sayth he)

                another mānes seruaunt? he standeth or

                to his lorde or master &amp; wherfore am I iuged of another mannes conscyence in that thynge / for the which I gyue thākes to god? He that eateth / lette him not dispyse

him that doth nat eate: And he that eateth nat / let him nat iuge that par sone whiche eateth. After the mynde than &amp; iugement of Paule / he is the weaker person of ye two which doth nat eate. And he synneth more greuously / which iugeth one that is bet ter than him self / &amp; to whō he ought rather to haue gyue place. And yet charite / whiche attēpreth &amp; applyeth her selfe to al men / gyueth place for a season to the weaknesse of this ꝑsone / if he be offended of any probable or lykly cause / &amp; if he can nat be amended: but nat vtterly in euery thynge / &amp; at al tymes. For there is some thyng / wherin the weake person is to be monysshed and taught. Ther is / wherin he is to be rebuked or repreued. There is also / wherin he is to be dispysed / for els by conty nual applyeng to their myndes / to do nothyng els / but norisshe the disease

&amp; sickenesse of weake ꝑsons in conscyēce / is the straightest &amp; nexte way / to distroy al Euāgelycal holy nesse. And yet Paule speketh of infyrmyte &amp; weaknesse / whiche was welnere 
                  〈◊〉
                / which by ye reason that they had receyued it of their elders &amp; auncesters / &amp; also of longe vsage &amp; custome / was so depely soken &amp; setled in the myndes of men / that it coulde nat sodaynly be plucked out agayn / for so the iewes coul de nat suffre the lawe to be abrogat and disanussed / in whiche they were born &amp; brought vp / &amp; had cōtynued in the relygious obseruation therof to their olde age. So some man of the gentyls / if he shulde haue sene a christen man syttyng at the table among cōpany / where was set afore them flesshe / whiche had ben offred to ydols / he coulde nat but suspecte / that that christen man dothe cōsente

to the suꝑstition of thē / with whom he kepte cōpany at meale. And yet for al that / Paule cryeth out stoutly &amp; boldly in the meane season that an ydole is nothing / &amp; that it is lau sul to eate what so euer thyng is sol de in the shambles. He cryeth / that the ceremonyes of the lawe / whiche were ordayned for a season / ought to be abolysshed &amp; put a way / whan the gospel shulde take place &amp; be of strength. And to make an ende / he withstode Peter / &amp; rebuked hym to his face / bycause he was nat yet bol de to set lyght by the vayn offēdyng of the iewes. Therfore it was another kynde &amp; maner of offendynge ye neighbour / wherof Paule dyd speke / the occasyon wherof rose by rea son of a rooted custom / whiche they had vsed in their lyfe afore ledde.

                al togider to ceremonyes / hauynge no mynde or regarde of those thynges / whiche alone dothe make be trewly vertuous &amp; good lyuers.  But to returne agayn to myne owne cause howe so euer the mater standeth / as concernyng the auoydyng of offendynge our neighbour / neither ī this thynge shal any man thynke (as I trowe) that there lacketh in me charite / couetyng to gyue place to ye infyrmyte &amp; weaknesse of my neyghbour.  I had ordayned the popes pardon / as a preseruatyue agaynst

suche maner offences / for I do nat se for what other vse it is good or ꝓ fytable to me. furthermore / as mo che as I myght / I dyd eate flesshe se cretely. ye / moreouer I dyd vtterly abstayn from flesshe / euyn to ye ma nyfest and open ieopardy of my lyfe / oftentymes disobeynge the cousayls of phiscyciens. What can I do more / excepte that (for to auoyde the supersticyous weaknesse / I wyl nat say the peruerse masyce of certayne persones / whiche fyndeth sautes with euery thynge) I shulde also dye. He shulde be an vncharytable man (I trowe) whiche wolde requyre this thynge of me / &amp; I my selfe shulde be a manqueller / if I wolde do accordynge to his request.
             It belongeth to the charite of a christen man / to interprete and iuge euery thyng to ye best / what so euer maye be done with a good mynde &amp;

purpose. And those which be lerned in the christen faithe / ought to haue knowen that fastynge &amp; eatynge of fysshe / was nat cōmaūded &amp; apoyn ted for thē which are in ieoꝑdy by ye reason of sicknesse / but to such whi che are in ieoꝑdy by reason of rācknesse &amp; wantōnesse of ye flessh. But if any man yet be very suꝑstitious / if he that eateth flesshe / do monyssh and coūsayle him by these wordes.
             Brother / let nat myne exāple a ny thing offende you / I am cōstray ned to do yt I do / wolde god I were more helthy: I am glad of

               gth &amp; helth / do nat you wrongfully accuse my feblenesse &amp; weakenesse. He hath sufficiētly (as I wene) dis charged his own cōsciēce: but no we to make an ende. In lyke maner as I do iuge thē worthy to be sharpely rebuked / whiche of a sedytious presūption &amp; boldnesse / dothe violate &amp;

breake the cōmen custome / namely suche a custome which is nat cōtrary to trewe holynesse &amp; gode lyueng Some semeth yt the curates &amp; prea chers shulde do very wel / if by ye au thorite of the bysshops / they dyd denoūce fastyng to the people / in this wyse. Derely the hole lyfe of chrysten men ought by cōtynual sobernesse to be a certayn fast / nat onely from meates / but moch more from al maner riote / &amp; from al pleasures of this worlde / frō carnal affectiōs or desyres of the flessh / whiche warreth alwayes agaynst the spyrite. But yet neuerthelesse / the authorite of ye church / &amp; the custom of our elders &amp; fore fathers / exhorteth &amp; calleth vpon vs / that such as may for strength of body / for lauful age / &amp; plenty of substaūce / shulde prepare their myndes with fastyng to ye holy day. But let your fast be such as

becometh christen men / if you wyl that it be acceptable &amp; plesaūt to Iesu Christ: let it be an hole &amp; parfyte fast. It is the lest parte of fastyng / the abstynēce of certayn meates: it is an vnplesaunt fast to god / wherby peace &amp; cōcorde is broken. They that do fast / let thē gyue thankes to god for ye strēgth of their body / whi che by abstynēce &amp; fastyng / is made more apte &amp; mete to godly thynges. And they whiche do nat fast / let thē gyue thākes to the lorde / whiche of his lyberalyte &amp; goodnesse / doth my nyster dyuers plenty of meates / to norisshe &amp; cōforte our weake &amp; feble bodyes with al. They that fasteth / let them nat stande therfore in their owne cōceyte / as though they dyd a gret &amp; an exellēt thing / excepte they put to greatter and better thynges. They whiche fasteth nat / lette them so moche the more endeuer by godly

exercyses &amp; workes / that they maye make recōpence &amp; amendes for that thyng / whiche the weaknesse of body wyl nat suffre thē to do. He that doth nat abstayn / let him nat trouble the cōmen custome / &amp; let him auoyde the offendyng of weake persons / as moche as he may cōuenyently. He that dothe abstayne / lette him beware ye he iuge nat his neigh bour (agaynst the doctryne both of Christ &amp; the apostels) of such thynges whiche of their own nature are indifferent / &amp; maye be done outher wel or yuel. He doth lesse synne whi che suppeth al his lyfe without any nede / than he which for meate or dri 
                  〈◊〉
                sclaundreth &amp; backbyteth his ney ghbour / whom accordyng to the cō maūdement of god / he ought to loue as wel as his owne selfe. Suche maner monytions &amp; counsayls / by cause they helpe greatly to the purpose / 

are oftētymes among to be re hersed to the people. Moreouer this thīg also / I wolde sayn to be playn ly declared &amp; shewed, for the weake and fraysul consciences sakes / whi che cōstitutyons bynde / and whom they bynde: and whom they bynde nat: &amp; howe farforth they bynde / or nat bynde. Neither I do thynke in my mynde / that so narowe boūdes or meares are to be sette &amp; marked out / in these thynges which may be released of man / let these be gentyl and fauourable fatherly charitie.
            But agaynst enuy / against back bytyng / agaynst manslaughter / &amp; agaynst warres / and such other vn douted &amp; very pestylences and poysons of the christyan holynesse: let the authorite of ye bysshops be sharpe and cruel.  These thynges I thought best to write to you moost worshypful man &amp; most vertuous

prelate / nat that I wolde teache you whiche are moft lerned / or plede my cause: and defende my selfe before youre hyghnesse / whiche knoweth bothe my labours in studies / which I haue taken for the cōmen profytes sake / &amp; also this my mynde / whi che desyreth nothyng lesse thā meate or drinke / and the weaknesse of my body which is encreased by olde age and this presente disease whiche cleueth to me and vexeth me to to moche: But that by you I myght outher pacifye or heale other men / if my dede happely hath offended any men / or myne exāple hath drawen any to ouermoche lybertie or boldenesse. And that these thynges somwhat largely hath ben dysputed of me: there was none other cause els / but onely that I had very good opi nyon of your synguler wysedome / and gentylnesse or pacience.  For

whan I dyd consyder &amp; cal to my re nembraūce / the noblenesse of your

                maners &amp; exellent lernynge / ynally your synguler wysedome / and other gyftes &amp; vertues / semely for a bysshop / I dyd nat feare / feste you wolde take any thyng in to sus

                / whiche were spoken sōwhat boldly &amp; largely / of the oflyce &amp; dew tie of bysshoppes. I pray god that wel might your highnesse fare / most holy and vertuous prelate.
