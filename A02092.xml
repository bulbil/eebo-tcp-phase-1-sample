            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

            To all Gentlemen, Marchants, Apprentises,
and Countrey Farmers health.
            
               GEntlemen, Countrey men, and kinde
friends, for so I value all that are honest
and enemies of bad actions, although in
my bookes of Conny-catching I haue
discouered diuers formes of colonings,
and painted out both the sacking and
crosbyting lawes, which strumpets vse,
to the destruction of the simple, yet
willing to search all the substance, as I
haue glanncst at the shadow, &amp; to enter
into the nature of villanie, as I haue broacht vp the secretes of
vice, I haue thought good to publish this Dialogue or disputation,
betweene a hee Conny-catcher, and a shee Conny-catcher,
whether of them are most preiuditiall to the Common-wealth,
discoursing the base quallities of them both, and discouering
the inconuenience that growes to men, through the lightnes of
inconstant wantons, who being wholy giuen to the spoyle, seeke
the ruine of such as light into their companie. In this Dialogue,
louing Country-men, shall you finde what preiudice ensues by
haunting of whore-houses, what dangers grows by daliying with
common hat lottes, what inconuenience followes then 
                  〈…〉
               
pleasures of vnchast Libertines, (not onely by their consuming
of their wealth, and impouerishment of their goods and landes,
but to the great indangering of their health. For in conuersing

with them, they aime not simply at the losse of goods, and blemish
of their good names, but they fish for diseases, sicknesse,
sores incurable, vlcers brusting of the ioyntes, and sault rhumes,
which by the humour of that villanie, lepte from Naples into
Fraunce, and from Fraunce into the bowels of Englande, which
makes many crye out in their bones, whilest goodman Surgion
laughs in his purse: a thing to be feared as deadly while men liue,
as hell is to be dreaded after death, for it not only infecteth the
bodie, consumeth the soule, and waste wealth and worship, but
ingraues a perpetuall shame in the forehead of the partie so abused.
Whereof Maister Huggins hathwell written in his Myrror
of Magistrates, in the person of Memprycaius, exclaiming against
harlots, the verses be these:

                  Eschue vile Venus toyes shee cuts off age,
                  And learne this lesson oft, and tell thy frend,
                  By Pockes, death sodaine, begging, Harlots end.
               
            
            Besides, I haue here lay de open the wily wisedome of ouerwise
Curtizens, that with their cunning, can drawe on, not only
poore nouices, but such as hold themselues maisters of their occupation.
What flatteries they vse to bewitch, what sweet words
to inueagle, what simple holines to intrap, what amorous glaunces,
what smirking Ocyliades, what cringing curtesies, what stretching
Adios, following a man like a blood-hound, with theyr
eyes white, laying out of haire, what frouncing of tresses, what
paintings, what Ruffes, Cuffes, and braueries, and all to betraie
the eyes of the innocent nouice, whom when they haue drawne
on to the bent of their bow, they strip like the prodigall childe,
and turne out of doores like an outcast of the world. The Crocodile
hathnot more teares, Proleus, more shape, Ianus more
faces, the Hieria, more sundry tunes to entrap the passengers,
then our English Curtizens, to bee plaine, our English whores:
to set on fire the hearts of lasciuious and gazing strangers. These
common, or rather consuming strumpets, whose throathes are
softer then oyle, and yet whose steppes leade vnto death. They
haue their Ruffians to rifle, when they cannot fetch ouer with other
cunning, their crosbiters attending vpon them, their foysts,

their bufts, their nippes, and such like. Being wayted on by these
villaines, as by ordinary seruantes, so that who thinkes himselfe
wise inough to escape their flatteries, him they crosbyte, who
holdes himselfe to rule, to be bitten, with a counterfeyt Apparater,
him they rifle, if hee be not so to bee verst vpon, they haue a
foyst or a nyppe vpon him, and so sting him to the quicke. Thus
he 
                  •
               hat medles with pitch, cannot but be defiled, and he that acquainteth
himselfe or conuerseth with any of these Connycatching
strumpets, cannot but by some way or other bee brought
to confusion: for either hee must hazard his soule, blemish his
good name, loose his goods, light vppon diseases, or at the least
haue been tyed to the humor of an harlot, whose quiuer is open
to euery arrow, who likes all that haue fat purses, and loues none
that are destitue of pence. I remember a Monke in Diebus illis,
writ his opinion of the end of an Adulterer, thus:

                  Quatuor his casibus sine dubio cadet adulter,
                  Aut hic pauper eit, aut hicsubito morietur,
                  Aut cadet in causum qua debet indice vinci,
                  Aut aliquod membrum casu vell crimine perdet,
               
Which I Englished thus:

                  He that to Harlots lures do yeeld him thrall,
                  Through sowre misfortune too bad end shall fall:
                  Or sodaine death, or beggerie shall him chance,
                  Or guilt before a Iudge his shame inhance:
                  Or els by fault or fortune he shall leese,
                  Some member sure escape from one of these.
               
            
            Seeing then such inconuenience grows from the caterpillers
of the Common-wealth, and that a multitude of the monsters
here about London particularly &amp; generally abroad in England,
to the great ouerthrow of many simple men that are inueagled
by their flatteries, I thought good not only to discouer their villanies
in a Dialogue, but also to manifest by an example, howe
preiuditiall their life is, to the state of the land, that such as are
warned by an instance, may learne and looke before they leape,

to that end kind Country-men, I haue set downe at the ende of
the disputation, the wonderful life of a Curtezin, not a fiction,
but a truth of one that yet liues not now in an other forme repentant.
In the discourse of whose life, you shall see how dangerous
such truls be to all estates that be so simple as to trust theyr
fained subtilties: heere shall parents learne, how hurtfull it is to
cocker vp their youth in their follies, and haue a deepe insight
how to bridle their daughters, if they see them any waies grow
wantons, wishing therfore my labors may be a caueat to my contry-men,
to auoyde the companie of such cousoning Courtezins.

Fortune now alate growne so fauourable to
Foystes, that your husband hath lighted on
some large purchase, or hath your smooth
lookes linckt in some yong Nouice to sweate
for a fauour all the byte in his Bounge, and to leaue himselfe as many
Crownes as thou hast good conditions, and then hee shall bee one of

wittes, and tis by wit that I liue and will liue, in dispight of that peeuish
scholler, that thought with his conny-catching bookes to haue
crosbyt our trade. Doest thou maruell to see me thus briske, fayre
wenches cannot want fauours, while the world is so full of amorous
fooles, where can such girles as my selfe bee blemisht with a threedbare
coat, as long as country Farmers haue full purses, and wanton
Citizens pockets full of pence.

               Nan.
               In faith sir no, did I get no more by mine own wit, then I
reap by his purchase, I might both go bare &amp; penilesse the wholeyere,
but mine cyes are stauls, &amp; my hands lime twigs (elswere I not worthie
the name of a she Connycatcher) Cyrces had neuer more charms,
Calipso more inchantments the Syrens more subtil tunes, thē I haue
crafty slightes to inueagle a Conny, and fetch in a country Farmer.

Laurence beleeue mee, you men are but fooles, your gettings is vncertaine,

chance you light vppon a good boung

and you no great busines, as being now when Powles is shut vp, and
all purchasies and Connies in their burrowes, let vs to the Tauerne

I will proue that women, I meane of our facultie, a trafficque, or as
hase knaues tearme vs strumpets, are more subtill, more dangerous,
in the common-wealth, and more full of a yles to get crownes, then
the cunningest Foyst, Nip, Lift, Pragges, or whatsoeuer that liues at

               Trust me Laurence, I am so assured of the conquest, offering

to trie the ripenes of the wit, or the agillitie of the hand, then that
for him that wil be maister of his Trade, must passe the proudest Iugler
aliue, the poynts of Leger de maine, he must haue an eye to spye

                  e that feares the Gallowes shal neuer be good theefe while

Westminster, the Exchange, and such common haunted places, and
there haue a curious eye to the person, whether he be Gentleman, Citizen
or Farmer, and note, either, where his boung lyes, whether in
his hoase or pockets, and then dogge the partie into a presse where his
staule with heauing and shouing shall so molest him, that hee shall not

but looke be neuer so narrowly to it we haue his pursse, wherin sometime
there is fat purchase, twentie or thirtie poundes, and I pray you
how long would one of your Traffiques be earning so much with your
Chamber worke. Besides in faires and markets, and in the circuites
after Iudges, what infinit mony is gotten from honest meaning men,
that either busie about their necessarie affaires, or carelesly looking to
their Crownes, light amongst vs that be foysts, tush wee dissemble in
show, we goe so neat in apparrell, so orderly in outward appearance,
some like Lawyers Clarkes, others lyke Seruingmen, that attended
there about their maisters businesse, that wee are hardly smoakt, versing
vpon all men with kinde courtesies and faire wordes, and yet besng
so warily watchfull, that a good purse cannot be put vp in a faire,
but wee sigh if wee share it not amongst vs, and though the bookes of
Conny-catching hath somewhat hindred vs, and brought many braue
foystes to the haulter, yet some of our Country farmers, nay of our
Gentlemen and Citizens, are so carelesse in a throng of people, that
they shew vs the praie, and so draw on a theefe, and bequeath vs their
purses, whether we will or no, for who loues wyne so ill, that hee will
not eate grapes if they fall into his mouth, and who is so base, that if
be see a pocket faire before him, wil not foyst in if he may, or if foysting
will not serue, vse his knife and nip, for althogh there bee some foysts
that will not vse their kniues, yet I hold him not a perfect workeman

or maister of his Mysterie, that will not cut a purse as well as Foyst
a pocket, and hazard any limme for so sweet a gaine as gold, how answere
you me this breefe obiection Nan, can you compare with either
our cunning to get our gaines in purchase.
            
            
               Nan.
               And haue you no stronger arguments goodman Laurence,
to argue your excellencie in villanie but this, then in faith put vp your
pipes, and giue mee leaue to speake, your choplodgicke hath no great
subtiltie for simple, you reason of foysting, &amp; appropriate that to your
selues, to you men I meane, as though there were not women Foysts
and Nippes, as ne at in that Trade as you, of as good an eye, as fine
and nimble a hand, and of as resolute a heart, yes Laurence, and your
good mistresses in that mystery, for we without like suspition can passe
in your walkes vnder the couler of simplicitie to Westminster, with a
paper in our hand, as if we were distressed women, that had some supplication
to put vp to the Iudges, or some bill of information to deliuer
to our Lawyers, when God wot, we shuffle in for a boung as well
as the best of you all, yea as your selfe Laurence, though you bee called
king of Cutpurses, for though they smoake you, they will hardly
mistrust vs, and suppose our stomacke stand against it to foyst, yet who
can better playe the staule or the shadowe then wee, for in a thrust or
throng if we shoue hard, who is hee that will not fauour a woman, and
in giuing place to vs, giue you free passage for his purse. Againe, in
the market, when euerie wife hath almost her hand on her boung, and
that they crie beware the Cutpurse and Conny-catchers, then I as
fast as the best with my hand basket as mannerly as if I were to buye
great store of butter and egges for prouision of my house, do exclaime
against them with my hand on my purse,

when a woman cannot walke safely to market for feare of these villanous
Cutpurses, when as the first boung I come to, I either nip or
foyst, or els staule an other while hee hath stroken, dispatcht and gone,
now I pray you gentle sir, wherin are we inferiour to you in foysting,
and yet this is nothing to the purpose. For it is one of our most simplest
shifts, but yet I pray you what thinke you when a farmer, gentleman,
or Citizen, come to the Tearme, perhaps hee is wary of his
purse, and watch him neuer so warily, yet he will neuer be brought to
the blow, is it not possible for vs to pinch him ere hee passe, hee that is
most charie of his crownes abroad, and will cry ware the Conny-catchers,
will not be afraide to drinke a pinte of wine with a prety wench,

and perhaps goe to a trugging house to ferry out one for his purpose,
then with what cunning we can feede the simple fop, with what fayre
words, sweete kisses,

street, if the farmer or other whatsoeuer, bee not so forward as to motion
some curtesie to vs, we straight insinuate into his company, and
claime acquaintance of him by some meanes or other, and if his minde
be set for lust, and the diuell driue him on to match himselfe with some
dishonest wanton, then let him looke to his purse, for if he do but kisse

                           A pleasant Tale of a Country Farmer, that tooke it in scorn to
haue his purse cut or drawne from him, and how a Foyst
serued him.
                           IT was told me for a truth that not long since here in London, there
laie a country Farmar, with diuers of his neighbours about Law
matters, amongst whom, one of them going to Westminster-Hall,
was by a Foyst stript of all the pence in his purse, and comming home,
made great complaint of his misfortune, some lamented his losse, and
others exclaimed against the Cutpurses, but this Farmer he laught
loudly at the matter, and said such fooles as could not keep their purses
no surer, were well serued, and for my part quoth hee, I so much
scorne the Cutpurses, that I would thanke him hartily that would
take paines to foyst mine, well saies his neighbor, then you may thank
me, sith my harmes learnes you to beware, but if it be true, that many
things fall out between the cup and the lip, you know not what hands
Fortune may light in your owne lap, tush quoth the Farmar, heeres
fortie pounds in this purse in gold, the proudest Cutpurse in England
win it and weare it, as thus he boasted, there stood a subtill Foyst by
and heard all, smiling to himselfe at the folly of the proude Farmar,
and vowed to haue his purse or venture his necke for it, and so went
home and bewrayed it to a crue of his companions, who taking it in
dudgion, that they should be put down by a Pesant, met either at Laurence
Pickerings, or at Lambeth: let the Blackamore take heede
I name him not, least an honorable neighbor of his frowne at it, but
wheresoeuer they met they held a conuocation, and both consulted and
concluded all by a generall consent, to bend all their wits to bee possessers
of this Farmers Boung, and for the execution of this their vow,
they haunted about the Inne where he laie, and dogd him into diuers

places, both to Westminster Hall and other places, and yet could neuer
light vpon it, he was so watchfull and smoakt them so narrowly,
that all their trauell was in vaine, at last one of them fledde to a more
cunning pollicie, and went and learnde the mans name and where hee
dwelt, and then hyed him to the Counter and entered an Action against
him of trespasse, damages two hundreth pounds, when hee had
thus done, hee seed two Sargiants, and carried them downe with him
to the mans lodging, wishing them not to arrest him till he commaunded
them, well agreed they were, and downe to the Farmers lodging
they came, where were a crue of Foystes, whom he had made priuy to
the end of his practise, stood wayting, but he tooke no knowledge at all
of them, but walkt vp and downe, the Farmer came out and went to
Powles, the Cutpurse bad staie, and would not yet suffer the Officers
to meddle with him, til he came into the West end of Paules Churchyard,
and there he willed them to do their Office, and they stepping to
the Farmer arrested him, the Farmer amazed, beeing amongest his
neighbors, asked the Sargiant at whose suite hee was troubled, at
whose suite soeuer it be, sayd one of the Cutpurses that stood by, you
are wrongd honest man, for hee hath arested you here in a place of priuiledge,
where the Sherifes nor the Officers haue nothing to do with
you, and therefore you are vnwise if you obey him, tush saies an other
Cutpurse, though the man were so simple of himselfe, yet shall hee not
offer the Church so much wrong, as by yeelding to the Mace, to imbollish
Paules libertie, and therefore I will take his part, and with
that hee drew his swoord, an other tooke the man and haled him away,
the Officer he stooke hard to him, and sayd hee was his true prisoner,
and cride Clubbes, the Prentises arose, and there was a great hurly

                                 •
                              urly, for they tooke the Officers part, so that the poore Farmer was
mightily turmoyld amongst them, and almost haled in peeces, whilest
thus the strife was, one of the Foystes had taken his purse away, and
was gone, and the Officer carried the man away to a Tauerne, for he
swore he knew no such man, nor any man that he was indebted too, as
then they satte drinking of a quart of wine, the Foyst that had caused
him to be arrested, sent a note by a Porter to the Officer that he should
release the Farmer, for he had mistaken the man, which note the Officer
shewed him, and bad him pay his sees and go his waies, the poore
Country-man was content with that, and put his hand in his pocket
to feele for his purse, and God wot there was none, which made his

heart far more cold then the arrest did, and with that fetching a great
sigh he sayd, alas maisters I am vndone, my purse in this fraie is taken
out of my pocket and ten pounds in in gold in it besides white money.
Indeed sayd the Sargiant, commonly in such brawles the cutpurses
be busie, and I pray God the quarell was not made vpon purpose
by the pickpockets, well saies his neighbor, who shall smile at you
now, the other day when I lost my purse yon laught at mee, the Farmer
brooke all, and sat malecon

to paye the Sargiant, and had a learning I beleeue euer after to
braue the cutpurse.

choyce witted wench of your facultie, or she Foyst, hath euer done the

some twentie poundes about him, but hee had planted it so cunningly
in his doublet, that it was sure inough for finding. Although the citcie
Foyst layde all the plottes they could, as well by discoueryng him
to the Gaylors as otherwayes, yet hee was so pollitique, that they
couls not verse vpon him by any meanes, which greeued them so, that
one day at a dinner, they held a counsaile amongst themselues how to
couzen him, but in vain, til at last a good wench that sat by, vndertooke
it, so they would sweare to let her haue all that hee had, they confirmed

it sollemply, and she put it in practise thus, she subtilly insinuaed her
selfe into this Foysts company, who seeing her a prettie wench, began
after twise meeting to waxe familiar with her, and to question about a
nights lodging, after a litle nyce louing &amp; bidding she was content for
her supper and what els hee would of curtesie bestowe vppon her, for
she held it scorne shee sayd, to set a salarie price on her bodie, the Foyst
was gladde of this, and yet hee woulde not trust her, so that hee put
no more but tenne shillings in his pocket, but hee had aboue twentie
poundes twilted in his doublet, well to be short, suppertime came,
and thither comes my gentle Foyst, who makyng good cheere, was
so eagar of his game, that hee would straight to bedde by the leaue of
dame Bawde, who had her fee too, and there hee laye till about midnight,
where three or foure old Hacksters whom she had prouided vpon
purpose came to the doore and rapt lustely, who is there sayes the
Bawde looking out of the window, marry say they, such a Iustice,
and named one about the Cittie that is a mortall enemy to Cutpurses,
who is come to search your house for a Iesuite and other suspected
persons, alas sir sayes shee I haue none heere, well quoth they,
oape the doore, I will sayes shee, and with that shee came into the
Foystes Chamber, who heard all this, and was afraide it was some

might not be seene, why then quoth shee, steppe into this Closet, hee
whipt in hastely and neuer remembred his cloathes, she lockt him in

Turnmill street, what a sawcie Signor there is, whose purblind eyes
can scarcely discerne a Lowse from a Flea, and yet hee hath such insight
into the mysticall Trade of Crosbiting, that hee can furnish his
boord, with a hundreth poundes worth of Plate, I doubt the sandeyde
Asse, will kicke like a Westerne Pugge: if I rubbe him on the gaule,
but tis no matter if hee finde himselfe toucht and stirre, although hee
boastes of the chiefe of the Clargies fauour, yet Ile so set his name
out, that the boyes at Smithfield barres shall chalke him on the backe

from Hogsdon, perhaps it was there, and if you thinke Ilye, aske master
Richard Chot, and maister Richard Strong, two honest gentlemen

that can witnesse as well as I, this proofe of a womans witte.
There dweltt here somtimes a good auncient Matron that had a faire
whenc to her daughter, as yong and tender as morrow masse priests
Lemman, her shee set out to sale in her youth, and drew on sundrie
to bee suters to her daughter, some wooers, and some speeders, yet
none married her, but of her bewtie they made a profite, and inue agled
all, till they had spent vpon her what they had, and then forsooth,
she and her yoong Pigion turne them out of doores like prodigall children,
she was acquainted with Dutch &amp; French, Italian &amp; Spaniard
as wel as English, &amp; at last, as so often the Pitcher goes to the brooke
that it comes broken home, my faire daughter was hit on the master
vaine and gotten with childe, now the mother to colour this matter to
saue her daughters marriage, begins to weare a Cushion vnder her
owne kirtle, and to faine her selfe with child, but let her daughter passe
as though she ailde nothing, when the fortie weekes were come, &amp; that
my yoong mistres must needs cry out forsooth, this olde B. had gotten
huswifes answerable to her selfe, and so brought her daughter to bed,
and let her go vp and downe the house, and the old Croane lay in child
bed as though shee had been deliuered, and sayd the childe was hers,
and so saued her daughters scape, was not this a wittie wonder maister
Lawrence, wrought by an olde Witch, to haue a childe in her age,
and make a yoong whoore seeme an honest virgin, cush this is litle to
the purpose, if I should recite all, how many shee had cousoned vnder
the pretence of ma

               You haue almost brought me out of my matter, but I was
talking about the Lift, commending what a good quallitie it was,
and how hurtfull it was, seeing we practise it in Mercers shops, with
Haberdashers of small wares, Haberdashers of Hattes and Cappes,
amongst Marchaunt Taylors for Hoase and Doublets, and in suche
places getting much gains by Lifting, when there is no good purchase
abroad by Foysting.
            
            
               Nan.
               Suppose you are good at the lift, who be more cunning thē we

women, in that we are more trusted, for they little suspect vs, and we
haue as close conueyance as you men, though you haue Cloakes, we
haue skirts of gownes, handbaskets, the crownes of our hattes, our
plackardes, and for a need, false bagges vnder our smockes, wherein
we can conuey more closely then you.

               I know not where to touch you, you are so wittie in your
answeres, and haue so many starting hoales, but let mee bee pleasant
with you a litle, what say you to priggin or horse stealing, I hope you
neuer had experience in that facultie.

               Why tis impossible.
            
            
               Nan.
               In faith sir no, and for proofe, I will put you downe with
a storie of a madde, merry, little, dapper, fine wench, who at Spilsby
Fayre had three horse of her owne or an other mans to sell, as shee her
husband and an other good fellow, walkt them vp and downe the faire,
the owner came and apprehended them all, and clapt them in prison,
the Iaylor not keeping them close prisoners, but letting them lye all
in a Chamber, by her wit she so instructed them in a formall tale, that
she saued all their liues thus. Being brought the next morrow after
their apprehension, before the Iustices, they examined the men how
they came by those horses, and they confest they met her with them,
but where shee had them they knewe not, then was my prettie peate
brought in, who being a handsome Trul, blusht as if she had been full
of grace, and being demanded where she had the horses, made this answere,
may it please your worships, this man being my husband, playing
the vnthrift as many more haue done, was absent from mee for a
quarter of a yeare, which greeued me not a little, insomuch that desirous
to see him, and hauing intelligence he wold be at Spilsby faire,
I went thither euen for pure loue of him on foote, and beeing within
some tenne myles of the Towne, I waxed passing weary and rested
me often and grew very faynt, at last there came ryding by me a Seruingman
in a blew coat, with three horses tyed one at anothers tayle,
which he led as I gest to sell at the faire, the Seruingman seeing mee
so tyred, tooke pitie on me, aud asked me if I would ride on one of his

                     〈◊〉
                   horses, for his owne would not beare double, I thankt him hartily,
and at the next hill got vp, and roade till wee came to a Towne
within three miles of Spilsby, where the Seruingman alighted at a

house, and bad me ride on afore and he would presently ouertake mee, well
forward I road halfe a myle, and looking behinde mee cauld see
no bodie, so being alone, my heart began to rise, and I to thinke on my
husband, as I had ridde a little farther, looking downe a lane, I saw
two men comming lustily vp as if they were weary, &amp; marking them
earnestly, I saw one of them was my husband, which made my heart
as light as before it was sad, so staying for them, after a little vnkinde
greeting betwixt vs, for I chid him for his vnthriftinesse, he asked me
where I had the horse, and I tolde him how curteously the Seruingman
had vsed me, why then saies hee, staie for him, nay quoth I, lets
ryde on, and get you two vp on the emptie horses, for he will ouertake
vs ere we come at the Towne, hee rydes on a stout lustie yoong gelding,
so forward wee went, and lookt often behinde vs, but our Seruingman
came not, at last we comming to Spilsby alighted, &amp; broake
our fast, and tied our horses at the doore, that if he past by, seeing them,
hee might call in, after wee had broake our fast, thinking hee had gone
some other way, wee went into the horse faire, and there walkt our
horses vp and downe to meete with the Seruingman, not for the intent
to sell them. Now may it please your worship, whether hee hàd
stolne the horses from this honest man or no, I knowe not, but alas,
simply I brought them to the horse faire, to let him that deliuered me
them haue them againe, for I hope your worships doth imagine, if I
had stolne them as it is suspected, I would neuer haue brought them
into so publicke a place to sell, yet if the law bee any way dangerous
for the foolish deed because I know not the Seruingman, it is, I must
bide the punishment, and as guiltlesse as any heere, and so making a
low courtsie shee ended. The Iustice holding vp his hand and wondring
at the womans wit that had cleared her husband and his friend,
and saued her selfe without compasse of law. How like you of this
Lawrence, cannot we wenches prigge well.
            
            
               Laur.
               By God Nan, I thincke I shall bee faine to giue you the
bucklars.
            
            
               Nan.
               Alas good Lawrence, thou art no Logitian, thou canst not
reason for thy selfe, nor hast no wittie arguments to draw me to an exigent,
and therefore giue mee leaue at large to reason for this supper,
remember the subiect of our disputation, is this positiue question,
whether whores or theeues are most preiuditiall to the Common-wealth,
alas, you poore theeues do only steale and pur loine from men,

and the harme you do is to imbollish mens goods, and bring them to
pouertie, this is the only end of mens theeuery, and the greatest preiudidice
that growes from robbing or filching, so much do we by our
theft, and more by our lecherie, for what is the end of whoredome but
consuming of goods and beggery, and besides perpetuall infamie, we
bring yoong youthes to ruine and vtter destruction, I pray you Lawrence
whether had a Marchants sonne hauing wealthie parents, better
light vpon a whoore then a Cutpurse, the one only taking his money,
the other bringing him to vtter confusion, for it the Foyst light
vpon him or the Conny-catcher, he looseth at the most some hundreth
poundes, but if hee fall into the companie of a whoore, shee flatters
him, shee inucagles him, shee bewitcheth him, that hee spareth neither
goods nor landes to content her, that is onely in loue with his
coyne, if he be married, hee forsakes his wife, leaues his children, despiseth
his friendes, onely to satisfie his lust with the loue of a base
whoore, who when he hath spent all vpon her and hee brought to beggerie,
beateth him out lyke the Prodigall childe, and for a finall reward,
brings him if to the fairest ende to beg, if to the second, to the
gallowes, or at the last and worst, to the Pockes, or as preiuditiall diseases.
I pray you Lawrence when any of you come to your confession
at Tyborne, what is your last sermon that you make, that you
were brought to that wicked and shamefull ende by following of harlots,
for to that end doo you steale to maintaine whoores, and to concent
their bad humars. Oh Lawrence enter into your owne thoughts,
and thinke what the faire wordes of a wanton willdo, what the smiles
of a strumpet will 
                     •
                  riue a man to act, into what ieopardie a man will
thrust himselfe for her that he loues, although for his sweete villanie,
he be brought to loathsome leprosie, tush Lawrence they say the Poxe
came from Naples, some from Spaine, some from France, but whersoeuer
it first grew, it is so surely now rooted in England, that by S.
(Syth) it may better be called A Morbus Anglicus then Gallicus,
and I hope you will graunt, all these Frenche fauours grewe from
whoores, besides in my high louing or rather creeping, I me an where
meu and women do robbe togither, there alwaies the woman is most
bloodie, for she alwayes vrgeth vnto death, and though the men wold
only satisfie themselues with the parties coyne, yet shee endeth her
theft in blood, murthering parties so deeply as she is malicious. I

hope gentle Lawrence you cannot contradict these reasons they 
                     •
                  ee
so openly manifestly probable. For mine owne part, I hope you doe
not imagine but I haue had some friendes besides poore George my
husband, alas, hee knowes it, aud is content lyke an honest simple
suffragan, to bee corrinall with a member of other good companions,
and I haue made many a good man, I meane a man that hath
a housholde, for the loue of mee to goe home and beate his poore wife,
when God wotte I mocke him for the money hee spent, and hee had
nothing for his pence, but the waste beleauings of others beastly labours.

two cousoning companions, wherein I haue shakte out the notable
villany of whores, although mistresse Nan this good Oratresse,
hath sworne to we are a long Hamborough knife to stabbe mee, and all
the crue haue protested my death, and to prooue they ment good earnest,
they belegard me about in the Saint Iohns head within Ludgate

beeing at supper, there were some fourtéene or fiftéene of
them met, and thought to haue made that the fatall night of
my ouerthrowe, but that the courteous Cittizens and Apprentises
tooke my part, and so two or thrée of them were
carryed to the Counter, although a Gentleman in my company
was sore hurt. I cannot deny but they beginne to
waste away about London, and Tyborne (since the setting
out of my booke) hath eaten vp many of them, and I will
plague them to the extreamitie, let them doe what they dare
with their bilbowe blades, I feare them not: and to giue
them their last adue, looke shortly Countrimen for a Phamphlet
against them, called The blacke Booke, contayning
foure newe Lawes neuer spoken of yet, The creeping Law
of petty théeues, that rob about the Suburbes. The lymitting
Lawe, discoursing the orders of such as followe Iudges,
in their circuites, and goe about from Fayre to Fayre. The
Iugging Law, wherein I will set out the disorders at Nyneholes
and Ryfling, how they are onely for the benefite of the
Cutpurses. The stripping Lawe, wherein I will lay open
the lewde abuses of sundry Iaylors in England. Beside, you
shall see there what houses there bee about the Suburbes
and townes ende, that are receyuers of Cut purses stolne
goods, Lifts, and such like. And lastly, looke for a Bed-roll
or Catologue, of all the names of the Foystes, Nyps, Lifts,

say, I dare not doe it, yet I will shortly set it abroach, and
whosoeuer I name or touch, if hee thinke himselfe greeued,
I will aunswere him before the Honourable priuie Counsayle.

Courtizan.
               SIth to discouer my parentage, woulde double the griefe
of my lyuing Parents, and reuiue in them, the memory
of my great amisse, and that my vntoward fall, would be a
dishonour to the house from whence I came. Sith to manifest

ye place of my birth, would be a blemish (through my
beastly life so badly misledde) to the Shyre where I was
borne: sith to discourse my name, might be holden a blot in
my kindreds browe, to haue a sinew in their stocke of so
little grace. I will conceale my parents, kin, and Country,
and shroude my name with silence, least enuie myght taunt
others for my wantonnesse. Knowe therefore, I was borne
about thréescore miles from London, of honest and welthy
parents, who had many children, but I their onely daughter,
and therefore the Iewell wherein they most delighted,
and more, the youngest of all, and therefore the more
fauoured: for beeing gotten in the wayning of my parents
age, they doted on me aboue the rest, and so set theyr harts
the more on fire. I was the fairest of all, and yet not more
beautifull then I was witty, in so much that beeing a pretty
Parrat, I had such quaint conceipts, and witty words in
my mouth, that the neighbours said, I was too soone wise,
to be long olde. Woulde to God, eyther the Prouerbe had
been authentical, or their sayings prophecies, then had I by
death in my nonage, buried many blemishes that my riper
yeeres brought me to. For the extreme loue of my parents,
was the very efficient cause of my follies, resembling heerin
the nature of the Ape, that euer killeth that young one
which he loueth most, with embracing it to feruētly. So my
father and mother, but she most of all, although he to much,
so cockered me vp in my wantonnes, that my wit grew to
the worst, and I waxed vpward with the ill weedes: what
soeuer I dyd, were it neuer so bad, might not be found fault
withall, my Father would smyle at it, and say, twas but
the tricke of a child, and my Mother allowed of my vnhappy
parts, alluding to this prophane and olde prouerbe, an
vntowarde gyrle makes a good Woman.
               But now I find, in sparing the rod, they hated the chyld,
that ouer kind fathers, make vnruly daughters. Had they
bent the wand while it had béene greene, it woulde haue
beene plyant, but I, ill growne in my yéeres, am almost remediles.
The Hawke that is most perfect for the flight and
will, seldome proueth hagarde, and children that are vertuously

nurtured in youth, will be honestly natured in age: 
                     •
                  le
vpon such as say, young Saints, olde deuils, it is no doubt
a deuillish and damnable saying, for what is not bent in the
Cradle, will hardly be bowed in the Sadle. My selfe am an
instance, who after I grew to be sixe yeeres olde, was sette
to Schoole, where I profited so much, that I writ and read
excellently well, playd vpon the virginals, Lute &amp; Cytron,
and could sing prick-song at the first sight: in so much, as by
that time I was twelue yeeres olde, I was holden for the
most faire, and best qualitied young girle in all that Countrey,
but with this, bewailed of my wel-wishers, in that my
parents suffered me to be so wanton.
               But they so tenderly affected mee, and were so blinded
with my excellent quallities, that they had no insight into
my ensuing follies. For I growing to be thirteene yeere
old, feeling the rayne of liberty loose on myne owne necke,
began with the wanton Heyfer, to ayme at mine own wil,
and to measure content, by the sweetnes of mine owne
thoughts, in so much, that pryde creeping on, I beganne to
prancke my selfe with the proudest, and to holde it in disdaine,
that any in the Parish, should exceede me in brauery.
As my apparrell was costly, so I grew to be licencious, and
to delight to be lookt on, so that I haunted and frequented
all feasts and weddings, &amp; other places of merry meetings,
where, as I was gazed on of many, so I spared no glaunces
to suruiew all with a curious eye-fauour: I obserued Ouids
rule right: Spectatum veniunt, veniunt spectentur vt ipse.
               
               I went to see &amp; be seene, and deckt my selfe in the highest
degree of brau
                     •
                  rie, holding it a glory when I was wayted
on with many eyes, to make censure of my birth. Beside, I
was an ordinary dauncer, and grewe in that quality so famous,
that I was noted as the chiefest thereat in all the
Country, yea, and to soothe me vp in these follies, my Parents
tooke a pride in my dauncing, which afterward prooued
my ouerthrow, and their hart breaking.
               Thus as an vnbridled Colte, I carelesly led foorth my
youth, and wantonly spent the flower of my yeeres, holding
such Maidens as were modest, fooles, and such as were not

as willfully wanton as my selfe, puppies, ill brought vppe
and without manners, growing on in yeeres, as tyde nor
tyme tarrieth no man, I began to waxe passion-proud, and
to think her not worthy to lyue, y• was not a little in loue,
that as diuers young men began to fauour me for my beautie,
so I beganne to censure of some of them partially, and
to delight in the multitude of many wooers, beeing ready to
fall from the Tree, before I was come to the perfection of a
blossome, which an Unckle of myne seeing, who was my
Mothers brother, as carefull of my welfare as nie to me in
kinne, finding fit oportunity to talke with mee, gaue mee
this wholesome exhortation.
            
            
               A watch-word to wanton Maidens.
               COzen, I sée the fayrest Hawke hath oftentimes the sickkest
feathers, that ye hotest day hath the most sharpest
thunders, the brightest sunne, 
                     •
                  he most suddaine showre, &amp;
the youngest Uirgins, the most daungerous fortunes, I
speake as a kinsman, and wish as a friend, the blossome of
a Maidens youth, (such as your selfe) hath attending vpon
it many frosts to nyp it, and many cares to consume it, so
that if it be not carefully lookt vnto, it will perrish before it
come to any perfection.
               A Uirgins honour, consisteth not onely in the gyfts of
Nature, as to be fayre and beautifull, though they bee fauours
that grace Maidens much, for as they be glistering,
so they be momentary, readie to be worne with euery winters
blast, and parched with euery Summers sunne, there
is no face so fayre, but the least Moale, the slenderest
skarre, the smallest brunt of sicknesse, will quickly blemishe.
               Beauty Cozen, as it florisheth in youth, so it fadeth in
age, it is but a folly that feedeth mans eye, a painting that
Nature lendes for a tyme, and men allowe on for a while,
in so much, that such as onely ayme at your faire lookes,
tye but their loues to an apprentishippe of beauty, which
broken eyther with cares, misfortune, or yeeres, their

destnies are at liberty, and they beginne to lothe you, and
like of others.
               Forma bonum fragile est quantumque accedit
ad Annos,
               Fit minor et spacio Carpitur ipsa suo.
               Then Cozin, stand not too much on such a slippery glorie,
that is as brittle as glasse, bee not proude of beauties
painting, that hatched by tyme, perrisheth in short tyme,
neyther are Women the more admirable of wise men for
theyr gay apparrell, though fooles are fed with gards, for a
womans ornaments, is the excellencie of her vertues: and
her inward good qualities, are of farre more worth then her
outward braueries, imbroydred hayre, bracelets, silkes:
rich attire, and such trash, doo rather bring the name of a
young Maide in question, then adde to her same any title of
honour.
               The Vestall Uirgins were not reuerenced of the Senators
for their curious clothing, but for their chastitie.
Cornelia was not famozed for ornaments of golde, but for
excellent vertues. Superfluity in apparrell, sheweth rather
lightnes of mind, then it importeth any other inward good
quality: and men iudge of Maydens rarenesse, by the modestie
of their rayment, holding it rather garish then glorious,
to be trickt vp in superstuous and excéeding braueries.
Neither Cozen is it seemely for Maydes, to iet abroade, or
to frequent too much company.
               For shée that is looked on by many, cannot chuse but
bee hardly spoken of by some, for report hath a blister on her
tongue, and Maydens actions are narrowly measured.
Therefore woulde not the auncient Romaines, suffer
theyr Daughters, to goe any further then theyr Mothers
lookes guided them. And therefore Diana is painted with
a Tortuse vnder her feete, meaning, that a Maid shoulde
not be a stragler, but like the Snayle, carry her house on
her heade; and keepe at home at her worke, so to keepe her
name without blemish, and her vertues from the slaunder
of enuie.
               
                  
A maide that hazards herselfe in much company, may
venture the fréedome of her hart by the folly of her eye, for so
long the pot goes to the water, that it comes broken home,
and such as looke much must néedes like at last: the Fly dallyes
with a flame, but at length she burneth, flax and fire put
together will kindle, a maid in companie of yonge men shall
be constrayned to listen to the wanton allurements of many
cunning speeches: if she hath not eyther with Vlisses tasted
of Moly, or stopt her eares warily, shee may either bee entised
with the Syrens, or enchanted by Cyrces, youth is apt
to yeeld to swéet perswasions, and therfore cozen thinke nothing
more daungerous than to gad abr
                     •
                  ade, neither cozen
doe I allowe this wanton dauncing in younge virgins, tis
more comendation for them to moderate their manners,
than to measure their féete, and better to heare nothing than
to listen vnto vnreuerent Musicke: Sylence is a precious
Iewell, and nothing so much worth as a couetenaunce full
of chastitie, light behauiour is a signe of lewd thoughts, and
men will say, there goes a wanton that will not want one,
if a place and person were agréeable to her desires: if a maidens
honor be blemisht, or her honestie cald in question, she
is halfe deflowred, and therefore had maidens neede to bee
chary, least enuy report them for vnchast. Cozen I speake
this generally, which if you apply particularly to your selfe,
you shall find in time my words were well saide.
               I gaue him slender thankes, but with such a frump that
he perceiued how light I made of his counsayle: which hee
perceiuing, shakt his head, and with teares in his eyes departed.
But I whom wanton desires had drawne in delight,
still presumde in my former follies, and gaue my selfe either
to gad abroad, or else at home to read dissolute Pamphlets,
which bred in mee many ill affected wishes, so that I gaue
leaue to loue and lust to enter into the center of my heart,
where they harboured tyll they wrought my finall and fatall
preiudice.
               Thus leading my life loosely, and being soothed vp with
the applause of my too kind and louing parents, I had many
of euery degrée that made loue vnto me, as wel for my beauty,

as for the hope of wealth that my father would bestowe
vpon mee: sundry sutors I had, and I allowed of all, though
I particularly graunted loue to none, yéelding them friendly
fauors, as being proud I had more wooers then any maid in
the parish beside: amongst the rest there was a welthy Farmer
that wished me well, a man of some forty yeeres of age,
one too worthy for one of so little worth as my selfe, and him
my father, mother, and other friendes, would haue had mee
match my selfe withall: but I that had had the raynes of lybertie
too long in mine owne hands, refused him and would
not bee ruled by their perswasions, and though my mother
with teares entreated mee to consider of mine owne estate,
&amp; how wel I sped if I wedded with him, yet carelesly I despised
her counsayle, and flatly made aunswere that I would
none of him: which though it pinched my Parentes at the
quicke, yet rather than they would displease me, they left me
                     •
                  
in mine own liberty to loue. Many there were beside him,
mens sons of no meane worth, that were wooers vnto mee,
but in vaine, either my fortune or destenie dro
                     •
                  e me to a
worser ende, for I re
                     •
                  used them all, and with the Beetle, refusing
to light on the swéetest flowers all day, nestled at
night in a Cowsheard.
               It fortuned that as many sought to win me, so amongst
the rest there was an od companion that dwelt with a Gentleman
hard by, a fellowe of small reputation, and of no lyuing,
neither had he any excellent quallities but thrumming
on the gittron: but of pleasant disposition he was, and could
gawll out many quaint &amp; ribadrous Iigges &amp; songs, and so
was fauoured of the 
                     •
                  oolish sect for his foppery. This shifting
companion, sutable to my selfe in vanitie, would oft
                     •
                   times
be iesting with me, and I so long dallying with him, that I
beganne déepely (oh let me blush at this confession) to fall in
loue with him, and so construed of all his actions, that I consented
to mine owne ouerthrowe: for as smoake will hardly
be concealed, so loue will not bee long smothred, but will
bewray her owne secrets, which was manifest in mee, who
in my sporting with him, so bewrayed my affection, that hee
spying I fauoured him, began to strike when the yron was

hotte, and to take opportunitie by the forehead, and one day
finding me in a merry vaine, began to question with me of
loue, which although at the first I slenderly denyed him, yet
at last I graunted, so that not onely I agréed to plight him
my faith, but that night méeting to haue farther talke, I lasciuiously
consented that he cropt the flower of my virginity.
When thus I was spoyled by such a base companion, I
gaue my selfe to content his humor, and to satisfie the sweet
of mine owne wanton desires. Oh heare let me breath and
with teares vewaile the beginning of my miseries, and to
exclayme against the folly of my Parents, who by too much
fauouring mee in my vanitie in my tender youth, layde the
first plot of my ensuing repentance: Had they with due correction
chastised my wantonnesse, and supprest my foolish
will with their graue aduise, they had made mee more vertuous
and themselues lesse sorrowfull. A fathers frowne is
a bridle to the childe, and a mothers checke is a stay to the
stubhorne daughter. Oh had my parents in ouerlouing mee
not hated me, I had not at this time cause to complaine. Oh
had my father regarded the saying of the wise man, I had
not beene thus woe begone.
               If thy daughter bee not shamefast holde her straightly,
least shee abuse her selfe through ouer-much libertie.
               Take heede of her that hath an vnshamefast eye, &amp; maruell
not if she trespasse against thee.
               The daughter maketh the father to watch secretly, and
the carefulnesse he hath for her, taketh away his sleepe.
               In her virginitie, least shee should be deflowred in her fathers
house.
               If therefore thy daughter be vnshamefast in her youth,
keepe her straightlie, least shee cause thine enemies to laugh
thee to scorne, and make thee a common talke in the Cittie,
and defame thee among the people, and bring thee to publique
shame.
               Had my parentes with care considered of this holy counsaile,
and leuelied my life by the load-stone of vertue: had
they lookt narrowly into the faultes of my youth, and bent
the trée while it was a wand, and taught the hound while he

was a puppie, this blemish had neuer befortuned me
                     •
                   nor so great dishonour
had not befallen them. Then by my example, let all Parents
take head, least in

                  ouing their children too tenderly, they

in age, reforme your children betimes both with correction and
counsaile, so shall you that are parentes glorie in the honour of their
good indeuours, but leauing this digression, againe to the loosenesse
of mine owne life, who now hauing lost the glorie of my youth, and
suffered such a base slaue to possesse it, which many men of woorth had
desired to enioy, I waxed hold in sin &amp; grew shameles, in so much he
could not desire so much as I did grant, whereupon, seeing hee durst
not reueale it to my father to demand me in marriage, hee resolued to
carry me away secretly, and therefore wisht me to prouide for my selfe,
and to furnish mee euery way both with money and apparrell, hoping
as he sayd, that after we were departed, and my father saw wee were
married, and that no meanes was to amend it, he would giue his free
consent, and vse vs as kindly, and deale with vs as liberally as if wee
had matcht with his good wil. I that was apt to anyil, agreed to this,
and so wrought the matter, that hee carried mee away into a straunge
place, and then vsing me a while as his wife, when our mony began to
wax low, he resolued secretly to go into the Country where my father
dwelt, to heare not only how my father tooke my departure, but what
hope we had of his ensuing fauour, although I was loath to be left alone
in a strange place, yet I was willing to heare from my friendes,
who no doubt conceiued much heart sorrow for my vnhappy fortunes,
so that I parted with a few teares, and enioyned him, to make all the
hast he might to returne, hee being gone, as the Eagles alwaies resort
where the carrion is, so the brute being spred abroad of my bewtie, and

that at such an Inne laie such a fatre yoong Gentlewoman, there resorted
thither many braue youthfull Gentlemen and cutting companions,
that tickled with lust, aymed at the possession of my fauour, and
by sundry meanes sought to haue a sight of me, which I easily graunted
to all, as a woman that counted it a glory to be wondred at by many
mens eyes, insomuch that comming amongst them, I set their harts
more and more on fire, that there rose diuers brawles who should bee
most in my company, beeing thus haunted by such a troupe of lustie
Ruffiers, I beganne to finde mine owne folly, that had placst my first
affection so losely, and therefore beganne as deeply to loath him that
was departed, as earst I likte him, when hee was present, vowing in
my selfe though hee had the spoyle of my virginitie, yet neuer after
should he triumph in the possession of my fauour, and therfore beganne
I to affection these new come guests, and one aboue the rest, who was
a braue yoong Gentleman, and no lesse addicted vnto mee, then I deuoted
vnto him, for daily hee courted mee with amorous Sonnets
and curious proude letters, and sent me Iewels, and all that I might
grace him with the name of my seruant, I returned him as louyng

                     •
                  nes at last, and so contented his lusting desire, that secretly and vnknowne
to all the rest, I made him sundry nights my bedfellow, where
I so bewitcht him with sweet wordes, that the men began deepely to
doate vpon me, insomuch that selling some portion of land that he had,
hee put it into readie money, and prouiding Horse and all things conuenient,
carried mee secretly away, almost as farre as the Bathe.
This was my second choyce and my second shame, thus I went forward
in wickednesse and delighted in chaunge, hauing left mine olde
loue to looke after some other mate more fit for her purpose, how hee
tooke my departure when hee returned I little cared, for now I had
my content, a Gentleman, yoong, lustie, and indned with good quallities,
and one that loued mee more tenderly then himselfe, thus liued
this new entertained friend and I togither vnmarried, yet as man
and wife for a while, so louingly as was to his content and my credite,
but as the Tygre though for a while shee hide her clawee, yet
at last shee will reueale her crueltie, and as the Agnus Castus leafe
when it lookes most drye, is then most full of moysture, so womens
wantonnesse is not quallified by their warinesse, nor doo their charinesse
for a moneth, warrant their chastitie for euer, which I prooued
true, for my supposed husband beeing euery way a man of worth could

not so couertly hide himselfe in the country, though a stranger, but that
he fel in acquaintance with many braue Gentlemen whom he brought
home to his lodging, not only to honour them with his liberall courtesie,
but also to see mee being proude of any man of woorth, applawded
my beautie. Alas poore Gentleman, too much bewitcht by the
wilinesse of a woman, had hee deemed my heart to bee a harbour for euery
new desire, or mine eye a suter to euerie new face, hee would not
haue beene so fonde as to haue brought his companions into my company,
but rather would haue mewed mee vp as a He
                     •
                  ne, to haue kept
that seuerall to himselfe by force, which hee could not retaine by kindnesse,
but the houest minded Nouice little suspected my chaunge, although
I God wot placed my delight, in nothing more then the desire
of new choyce, which fell out thus. Amongst the rest of the Gentlemen
that kept him company, there was one that was his most familiar,
and hee reposed more trust and confidence in him then in all the
rest, this Gentleman beganne to bee deepely inamoured of mee, and
shewed it by many signes which I easily perceiued, and I whose eare
was pliant to euery sweete word, and who so allowed of all that were
bewtifull, affected him no lesse, so that loue preuailing aboue friendship,
hee broake the matter with mee, and made not many suites in
vaine before hee obteined his purpose, for hee had what hee wisht, and
I had what contented mee, I will not confesse that any of the rest had
some sildome fauours, but this Gentleman was my second selfe; and
I loued him more for the time at the heele, then the other at the heart,
so that though the other youth beare the charges and was sir pay for
all, yet this newe friend was hee that was maister of my affections,
which kindnesse betwixt vs, was so vnwisely cloaked, that in short time
it was manifest to all our familiars which made my supposed husband
to sigh and others to smile, but hee that was hit with the horne was
pincht at the heart, yet so extreame was the affection hee bare to mee,
that he had rather conceale his greefe, then any way make me discontent,
so that hee smoothered his sorrow with patience, and brookt the
miurie with silence, till our loues grew so broad before, that it was a
woonder to the worlde, whereupon one day at dinner, I being verie
pleasant with his chosen friend and my choyce louer, I know not how,
but either by fortune, or it may be some set match, there was by a gentleman,
there present a question popt in about womens passions, and
their mutabilitie in affection, so that the controuersie was defended,

                  pro &amp; contra, which arguments, whether a woman might haue a second
friend or no, at last it was concluded, that loue and Lordshippe
brookes no fellowship, and therefore none so base minded to beare ariuall.
Hereupon arose a question about friendes that were put in trust,
how it was a high point of treason, for one to betray an other, especially
in loue, in so much that one gentleman at the boord, protested by a
solemne oath, that if any friend of his made priuie and fauoured witly
the sight of his mistresse whom hee loued, whether it were his wife or
no, should secretly seeke to incroach into his roome and offer him that
dishonour to partake his loue, he would not vse any other reuenge, but
at the next greeting stabbe him with his Poynado, though hee were
coudemned to death for the action. All this fitted for the humor of my
supposed husband, and strooke both mee and my friend into a quandarie,
but I scornfully iested at it, when as my husband taking the ball
before it fel to the ground, began to make a long discourse what faithlesse
friends they were that would faile in loue, especially where a resolued
trust of the partie beloued was committed vnto them, and herevpon
to make the matter more credulous, and to quip my folly, and to
taunt the basenesse of his friends minde, that so he might with curtesie
both warne vs of our wantonnes, and 
                     •
                  eclaime vs from ill, he promised
to tell a pleasant storie performed as hee sayd not long since in
England, and it was to this effect.
            
            
               A pleasant discourse, how a wise wanton by her husbands gentle
warning, became to be a modest Matron.
               THere was a Gentleman (to giue him his due) an Esquire heere in
England, that was married to a yoong Gentlewoman, faire and
of a modest behauiour, vertuous in her lookes, how soeuer she was in
her thoughts, and one that euery veay with her dutifull indeuour and
outward apparance of honestie, did breed her husbands content, insomuch
that the Gentleman so deeply affected her, as he counted al those
houres ill spent which he past not away in her company, besotting so
himselfe in the beautie of his wife, that his onely care was to haue her
euery way delighted, liuing thus pleasantly togither, he had one spetiall
friend amongst the rest, whom he so dearly affected, as euer Damon
                  
did his Pythias, Pliades his Orestes, or Tytus his Gisippus,
he vnfolded all his secrets in his bosome, and what passion hee had in
his minde that either ioyed him or perplexed him, he reuealed vnto his
friend, &amp; directed his actious according to the sequel of his counsailes
so that they were two bodies and oue soule. This Gentleman for all
the iuward fauour showne him by his faithful friend, could not so withstand
the force

                  f fancy, but he grew enamoured of his friendes wife,
whom he courted with many sweet words and

                  yd who had
been an old seruant in the house, began to grow suspitious, that there
was too much familiaritie betweene her mistresse and her maisters
friend, and vpon this watcht them diuers times so narrowly, that at
last she sound them more priuiate then either agreed with her maisters
honor, or her owne honestie, and thereupon reuealed it one day vnto her
maister, he little credulous of the light behauiour of his wife, blamed
the mayd and bad her take heed, least she sought to blemish her vertues
with slaunder, whom hee loued more tenderly then his owne life, the
mayd replied, that she spake not of enuy to him, but of meere loue she
heare vnto him, and the rather that hee might shadow such a fault in
time, and by some meanes preuent it, least if others should note it as
well as shee, his wiues good name and his friends should bee cald in
question, at these wise words spoken by so base a drug as his mayd, the
Gentleman waxed astonished and listened to her discourse, wishing her
to discouer how she knew or was so priuy to the folly of her mistresse,
or by what meanes he might haue assured proofe of it, shee tolde him

that to her, her owne eyes were witnesses, for shee saw them vnlawfully
togither, and please it you sir quoth shee, to faine your selfe to go
from home, and then in the backhouse to keepe you secret, I will let
you see as much as I haue manifested vnto you, vpon this the maister
agreed, and warnd his mayd not so much as to make it knowne to any
of her fellowes. Within a day or two after, the Gentleman sayd, hee
would goe a huntiug and fo rise verie early, and causing his men to
couple vp his Honndes, left his wife in bed and went abroad, assoone
as he was gone a myle from the house, he commanded his men to ryde
afore and to start the Hare and follow the chase, and wee will come
faire and softly after, they obeying their maisters charge, went theyr
wayes, and he returned by a backway to his house, and went secretly
to the place where his mayd and he had appointed. In the meane time,
the mistresse thinking her husband safe with his Houndes, sent for he

                  eman
was not stacke to come, but making all the haste hee could, came and
went into the chamber, asking for the Maister of the house very familiarly,
the old mayd noting all this, assoone as she knew them togither,
went and cald her maister and carried him vp by a secret pair of staires
to her mistresse chamber doore, where peeping in at a place that the
mayd before had made for the purpose, he saw more then he lookt for,
and so much as pincht him at the very heart, causing him to accuse his
wife for a strumpet and his friend for a traytor, yet for all this, valuing
his owne honour more then their dishonestie, thinking if he should
make an vprore, he should but ayme at his owne discredite, and cause
himself to be a laughing game to his enemies, he concealed his sorrow
with silence, and taking the mayd apart, charged her to keepe all secret,
whatsoeuer she had seene, euen as she esteemed of her owne life,
for if shee did bewray it to any, hee himselfe would with his Swoord
make an ende of her daies, and with that putting his hand in his sleeue,
gaue the poore mayd sixe Angels to buy her a new gowne, the wench
glad of this gift, swore solemnely to tread it vnder foote, and sith it
pleased him to conseale it, neuer to reueale it as long as she liued, vpon
this they parted, she to her drudgery, and he to the field to his men,
where after hee had kild the Hare, hee returned home, and finding his
friend in the Garden, that in his absence had been grafting hornes in
the Chunnies, and entertained him with his woonted familiaritie, and
shewed no bad countenance to his wife, but dissembled al his thoughts

to the full. Assoone as dinner was done, and that he was gotten solitarie
by himselfe, he beganne to determine of reuenge, but not as euerie
man would haue done, how to haue brought his wife to shame, &amp; her
loue to confusion, but he busied his braines how hee might reserue his
honour inuiolate, reclaime his wife, and keep his friend, meditating a
long time how he might bring all this to passe, at last a humour fell into
his head, how cunningly to compasse all three and therefore he went
&amp; got him a certaine slips, which are counterfeyt peeces of mony being
brasse, &amp; couered ouer with siluer, which the common people call slips,
hauing furnished himselfe with these, hee put them in his purse, and at
night went to bed as he was wont to doo, yet not vsing the kind familiaritie
that he accustomed, notwithstanding he abstained not from the
vse of her body, but knew his wife as afore times, and euery time hee
committed the act with her, he layd the next morning in the window a
slip, where hee was sure shee might finde it, and so many times as it
pleased him to be carnally pleasant with his wife, so many slips he still
layd down vpon her cushnet. This he vsed for the space of a fortnight,
till at last, his wife finding euery day a slip, or sometime more or lesse,
wondred how they came there, and examining her wayting maydes,
none of them could tell her any thing touching them, whereupon shee
thought to question with her husband about it, but being out of her remembrance,
the next morning as he &amp; she lay dallying in bed, it came
into her minde, and she asked her husband if he layd those slippes on her
cushnet, that she of late found there, hauing neuer seene any before. I
marry did I quoth hee, and I haue layd them there vpon speciall reason,
and it is this. Euer since I haue been married to thee, I haue deemed
thee honest, and therefore vsed and honored thee as my wife, parting
coequall fauours betwixt vs as true loues, but alate finding the
contrary, &amp; with these eyes seeing thee play the whore with my friend
in whom I did repose all my trust, I sought not as many would haue
done, to haue reuenged in blood, but for the safetie of mine own honor,
which otherwise would haue been blemisht by thy dishonestie, I haue
bin silent, and haue neyther wronged my quandom friend, nor abused
thee, but still do hold bed with thee, that the world shall not suspect any
thing, and to quench the desire of lust I do vse thy bodie, but not so
louingly as I would a wife, but carelesly as I would a strumpet, and
therefore euen as to a whoore, so I giue thee hyer, which is for euerie
time a slip, a counterfect coyne, which is good inough for such a slipperie
wanton, that will wrong her husband that loued her so tenderly,

and thus wil I vse thee for the safetie of mine owne honour, til I haue

                  est honest, and thus with teares in his
eyes and his heart readie to burst with sighes, he was silent, when his
wife striken with remorse of conscience, leapi
                     ••
                   out of her bedde in her
smocke, humbly confessing all, craued pardon promising if he should
pardon this offence which was new begun in

                  , shee would become
anew reformed woman, and neuer after so much as in thought, giue
him any occasion of suspition or ielousie, the patient husband not willing
to vrge his wife, tooke her at her word, and told her that when he
found her so reclaimed, he would as afore he had done, vse her louingly
and as his wife, but till he was so perswaded of her honestie, he wold
pay her stil 
                     •
                  lips for his pleasure, charging her not to reueale any thing
to his friend, or to make it knowne to him that hee was priuy to their
loues. Thus the debate ended, I gesse in some kinde greeting, and the
Gentleman went abroad to see his pastures, leauing his wife in bed
full of sorrow and almost renting her heart asunder with sighs, assoone
as he was walked abroad, the Gentleman his friend came to the house
and asked for the goodman, the pander that was priuy to all their practises,
said, that his maister was gone abroad to see his pastures, but his
mistresse was in bed, why then saies he, I will go and raise her vp, so
comming into the chamber and kissing her, meaning as hee was wont
to haue vsed other accustomed dalliance, shee desired him to abstaine
with broken sighes &amp; her eyes full of teares, he wondring what should
make her thus discontent, asked her what was the cause of her sorow,
protesting with a solemne oath, that if any had done her iniury, he wold
reuenge it, were it with hazard of his life, she then tolde him scarce being
able to speake for weeping, that shee had a sute to mooue him in,
which if he granted vnto her, she would hold him in loue and affection
without change next her husband foreuer, he promised to do whatsoeuer
it were, then saies she, sweare vpon a Byble you will do it without
exception, with that he tooke a Byble that laie in the window &amp; swore,
that whatsoeuer she requested him to do, were it to the losse of his life,
he would without exception performe it. Then she holding downe her
head and blushing, began thus. I need not quoth shee make manifest
how grosly and greeuously you and I haue both offended God, and
wronged the honest Gentleman my husband and your friend, hee putting
a speciall trust in vs both, &amp; assuring such earnest affiance in your
vnfained friendship, that hee euen committeth me his wife, his loue,

his second life, into your bosome, this loue haue

constancy, in playing the harlot, that saith that he 
                     〈…〉
                  
you returned with trechery and falshood, in abusing mine honesty and
his honor, now a remorse of conscience toucheth me for my sinnes, that
I hartily repent, and vow euer hereafter to liue onely to my husband,
and therefore my sute is to you, that from hencefoorth you shall neuer
so much as motion any dishonest question vnto mee, nor seeke any vnlawfull
pleasure or conuersing at my handes this is my sute, and hereunto
I haue sworne you, which oath if you obserue as a faithfull gentleman,
I will conceale from my husband what is past, and rest in honest
sort your faithfull friend for euer, at this shee burst a fresh into
teares, and vttered such sighes, that he thought for very griefe her hart
would haue claue asunder. The gentleman astonied at this straunge
Metamorphesis of his mistresse, sat a good while in a maze, and at last
taking her by the hand, made this reply, so God helpe mee faire sweeting,
I am glad of this motion, and wondrous ioyfull that God hath
put such honest thoughts into your mind, &amp; hath made you the meanes
to reclaime me from my folly, I feele no lesse remorse then you doo, in
wronging so honest a friend as your husband, but this is the frailnesse
of man, and therefore to make amends, I protest a new, neuer hereafter
so much as in thought, as to motion you of dishonestie, onely I
craue you be silent, she promised that and so they ended. And so for that
time they parted, at noone the gentleman came home and cheerfully
saluted his wife and asked if dinner were ready, and sent for his friend,
vsing him wonderfully familiarly, giuing him no occasion of mistrust,
and so pleasantly they past away the day togither, at night when his
wife and he went to bed, shee told him all, what had past betweene her
and his friend, and how she had bound him with an oath, and that hee
voluntarily of himselfe swore, as much being hartily sory that hee had
so deepely offended so kinde a friend, the gentleman commended her
wit, and found her afterward a reclaimed woman, shee liuing so honestly
that she neuer gaue him any occasion of mistrust. Thus the wise
gentleman reclaimed with silence a wanton wife, and retained an assured
friend.
               At this pleasant Tale all the boord was at a mutinie, and they said
the gentleman did passing wisely that wrought so cunningly for the
safetie of his owne honor, but highly exclaiming against such a friend

as would to his friend offer such villany, all condemning her that wold
be false to so louing a husband. Thus they did diuersly descant &amp; past
away dinner, but this Tale wrought litle effect in me, for as one past
grace, I delighted in chaunge, but the gentleman that was his familiar
and my Paramour, was so touched, that neuer after hee would
touch me dishonestly, but reclaimed himselfe, abstained from me and
became true to his friend, I wondring that according to his woonted
custome, he did not seeke my company, he and I being one day in the
chamber alone, and he in his dumpes, I began to dally with him, and
to aske him why he was so straunge, and vsed not his accustomed fauours
to me. He solemnely made answere, that though he had playd
the foole in setting his fancy vpon an other mans wife, &amp; in wronging
his friend, yet his conscience was now touched with remorse, &amp; euer
since he heard the Tale afore rehearsed, hee had vowed in himselfe neuer
to do my husband the like wrong againe: my husband quoth I, he
is none of mine, he hath brought me from my friends and keepes mee
here vnmarried, and therefore am I as free for you as for him, &amp; thus
began to grow clamorous, because I was debard of my lust, the gentleman
seeing me shamelesse, wisht me to be silent, and sayd, although
you be but his friend, yet he hold you as deare as his wife, and therfore
I will not abuse him, neither would I wish you to be familiar with any
other, seeing you haue a friend that loues you so tenderly, much
good counsaile he gaue me, but all in vaine, for I scorned it, and began
to hate him, and resolued both to be ridde of him and my supposed husband,
for falling in an other familiar of my husbands, I so inueagled
him with sweet words, that I caused him to make a peece of mony to
steale me away, and so carry me to London, where I had not liued long
with him, ere he seeing my light behauiour, left mee to the world, and
to shift for my selfe. Here by my example may you note the inconstant
life of Courtezens and common harlots, who after they haue lost their
honestie, care not who grow into their fauour, nor what villany they
commit, they fancy all as long as crownes last, and only ayme at pleasure
and ease, they cleaue like Caterpillars to the tree, and consume
the fruit where they fall, they be Vultures that praie on men aliue, and
like the Serpent sting the bosome wherein they are nourished. I may
best discourse their nature, because I was one of their profession, but
now beeing metamorphosed, I holde it meritorious for mee to warne
women from being such wantons, and to giue a caueat to men, least

they addict themselues to such stragling strumpettes, as loue none,
though they like all, but affectionate only for profit, and when he hath
spent all, they beate him out of doores with the prodigall childe, but

Courtizins, to my selfe, who now being brought to London, and left
here at randon, was not such a housedoue while any friend stated with
me, but that I had visite some houses in London, that could harbour
as honest a woman as my selfe, when as therefore I was left to my
selfe, I remoued my lodging, and gat mee into one of those houses of
good hospitalitie whereunto persons resort, commonly called a Trugging
house, or to be plaine, a whorse house, where I gaue my selfe to
entertaine al companions, sitting or standing at the doore like a staule,
to allure or draw in wanton passengers, refusing none that wold with
his pursepurchase me to be his, to satisfie the disordinate desire of his
filthie lust, now I began not to respect parsonage, good qualities, to
the gratious fauour of the man, when eye had no respect of person,
for the oldest lecher was as welcom as the yangest louer, so he broght
meate in his mouth, otherwise I pronounce against him.
               Si nihil attuleris ibis homere foras.
               I waxed thus in this hell of voluptuousnes, daily worse &amp; worse,
yet hauing as they terme it, a respect to the maine chance as neare as
I could to auoyd diseases, and to keepe my selfe braue in apparell, although
I pay

                   a kind of tribute to the Bawde, according as the number
and benefite of my companions did exceed, but neuer could I bee
brought to be a pickpocket or theeuish, by any of their perswasions, although
I wanted daily no instructions to allure me to that villany, for
I thinke nature had wrought in me a contrary humor, otherwise my
bad nourture and conuersing with such bad company, had brought me
to it, mary in all their vices I carried a brazen face &amp; was shamelesse,
for what Ruffian was there in London, that would vtter mor edesperate
oaths then I in mine anger, what to spet, quaffe, or carouse more

grew so grafted in sin, that Consueto peccandit ollebat sensum peccati,
Custome of sin, tooke away the feeling of the sin, for I so accustomably
vse my selfe to all kinde of vice, that I accounted swearing no sinne,
whordome, why I smile at that, and could prophanely saie, that it was
a sin which God laught at, gluttony I held good fellowship, &amp; wrath

still delighted in iangling Ditties of ryhaudrie, thus to the greefe of
my friendes, hazard of my soule, and consuming of my bodie, I spent
a yeare or two in this base and bad kinde of life, subiect to the whistle
of euerie desperate Ruffian, till on a time, there resorted to our house a
Cloathier, a propper yoong man, who by fortune, comming first to
drinke, espying mee, asked mee if I would drinke with him, there needed
no great intreatie, for as then I wanted company, and so clapt me
downe by him, and began verie pleasantly then to welcome him, the
man being of himselfe modest and honest, noted my personage, and iuditially
reasoned of my strumpetlike behauiour, and inwardly as after
he reported vnto mee, greeued that so foule properties were hidden in
so good a proportion, and that such rare wit and excellent bewtie, was
blemisht with whoredomes base deformitie, in so much that hee began
to think well of me, and to wish that I were as honest as I was bewtifull.
Againe, see how God wrought for my conuersion, since I gaue

or princes on the earth. Oh let vs tremble that we but once durst haue
such wanton communication in the hearing of his diuine Maiesty, who
pronounceth damnation for such as giue themselues ouer to adultery.
It is not possible saith the Lorde, for any whoremaister or lasciuious
wanton, to enter into the kingdome of God, for such sinnes whole Cities
haue suncke, kingdomes haue beene destroyed, and though God
suffreth such wicked liuers to escape for a while, yet at length he payeth
home, in this world with beggarie, shame, diseases, or infamy, and
in the other life, with perpetuall dampuation, weigh but the inconuenience
that growes through thy loose life, thou art

                  ted of all that are
good, despised of the vertuons, and only well thought of, of reprobats,
raskals, ruffians, and such as the world hates, subiect to their lust, and
gaining thy liuing at the hands of euery diseased leacher. Oh what a
miserable trade of life is thine that liuest of the vomit of sin, in hunting
after maladies, but suppose, while thou art yoong, thou art fauoured
of thy companions, when thou waxest old, and that thy beautie is vaded,
then thou shalt be loathed and despised, euen of them that profest
most loue vnto thee, then good sister call to minde the basenesse of thy
life, the hainous outrage of thy sin, that God doth punish it with the rigor
of his iustice, oh thou art made bewtifull, faire, and well fourmed,
and wilt thou then by thy filthie lust make thy bodie, which if thou bee
honest, is the Temple of God, the habitation of the diuel. Consider
this, and call to God for mercy, and amend thy life, leaue this house,
and I will become thy faithfull friend in all honestie, and vse thee as
mine owne sister, at this, such a remorse of conscience, such a fearefull
terror of my sin strooke into my minde, that I kneeled downe at his
feete, and with teares besought him he would helpe me out of that misery,
for his exhortation had caused in me a loathing of my wicked life,
and I wold not only become a reformed woman, but hold him as dear
as my father that gaue me life, where upon he kist me with teares, and
so we went downe togither, where wee had further communication,
and presently he prouided me an other lodging, where I not only vsde

my selfe so honestly, but also was so penitent euery day in teares for my
former folly, that he tooke me to his wife, and how I haue liued since
and loathed filthie lust, I referre my selfe to the Maiestie of God, who
knoweth the secrets of all hearts.
               Thus Country men I haue publisht the conuersion of an English
Courtizen, which if any way it bee profitable either to forewarne
youth, or withdraw bad persons to goodnesse, I haue the whole end of
my desire, only crauing euery father would bring vp his children with
carefull nourture, and euery yoong woman respect the honour of her
virginitie.

a merry Iest, how a Conny-catcher was vsed.
            
            
               A merry Tale taken not far from Fetter Lane end, of a new
found Conny-catcher, that was Conny-catcht
himselfe.
               SO it fell out, that a Gentleman was sicke and purblinde, and went
to a good honest mans house to soiourne, and taking vp his Chamber
grew so sick, that the goodman of the house hired a woman to keep
and attend day and night vpon the Gentleman, this poore woman hauing
a good conscience, was carefull of his welfare and lookte to his
dyet, which was so slender, that the man although sicke, was almost
famisht, so that the woman would no longer staie, but bad his Hoste
prouide him of some other to watch with him, sith it greeued her to see
a man lye and starue for want of foode, especially being set on the score
for meate and drinke in the space of a fortnight, foure ponndes. The
goodman of the house at last, hearing how that poore woman did finde
fault with his scoring, the Gentleman not only put her out of doores
without wages, but would haue arrested her, for taking away his good
name, and defaming and slaundring him, and with that calling one of
his neighbours to him, sayd neighbour, whereas such a had to

                  ngued
woman hath reported to my discredite, that the Gentleman that lyes
sicke in my house wants meat, and yet ruunes very much on the score,
I pray you iudge by his diet, whether hee bee famisht or no, first in the

morning, he hath a Cawdell next his heart, halfe an houre after that, a
quart of Sugar sops, halfe an houre after that a neck of mutton in
broath, halfe an houre after thaat Chickens in sorrell sops, and an
houre after that, a Ioynt of rostmeat for his dinner, now neighbour,
hauing this prouision, you may iudge whether he be spoyld for lacke
of meate or no, and to what great charges his dyet will arise, whereas
in truth, the poore Gentleman would haue beene glad of the l

                  all of
these, for he could get none at all, but the cousoning knaue, thought to
verse vpon him, and one day seeing mony came not briefly to the Gentleman,
tooke some of his apparrell, his cloake I gesse, and pawnde it
for fortie shillings, whereas God wot, all he eate in that time was not

                  th a Crowne, well, the Gentleman seeing how the knaue went about
to Conny-catch him, and that he had taken his cloake, smoothered
all for reuenge, and watcht opportunitie to do it, and on a time, seeing
the goodman out, borrowed a cloake far better then his owne, of
the boy, saying that he would goe to a friend of his to fetch money for
his maister &amp; discharge the house, the

                  ending it him, away walks
the Gentleman though weake after this great diet, and neuer
came at the Taylors-house to answere him cloake or
mony. And thus was he Conny-catcht himselfe,
that thought to haue verst vpon
another.
