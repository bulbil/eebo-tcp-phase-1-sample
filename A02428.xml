            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).

            To the right Worſhipfull, Maſter Reginald Scot, Eſqure; dayly increaſe of wealth, Worſhip and wiſedom, in the true feare of GOD.
            
            
               
                  THIS pleaſaunt and profitable practiſe of blood letting (Right Worſhipful Sir) hath always, and that worthely been accompted and called of the auncient and latter Phiſitions, Vnum è maioribus remedijs, one of the greater remedies in the Arte of healing; (not as I take it) for that the ſame is of greteſt charge to the patient his purſe, a veine being commonly opened for twelue pence: but becauſe if the ſame be done with skill according to Arte, it bringeth great profit to health, without any great diminiſhing of wealth. How this ſo great a remedy in both the intētions, of Phiſick, Preſeruatiue and Curatiue, is greatly abuſed by vagabūd Horſe-leaches, &amp; trauailing Tinkers, who find work almoſt in euery village, through

whoſe wickednes (hauing in truth neither learning, knowledge, witre, nor honeſty) the ſober practiſioner and cunning Chirurgian liueth baſely, is deſpiſed, and accounted a very abiect among the vulgar ſorte. The whole world with wofull weepings too too plentifully can witneſſe, and many godly and faythful Chriſtians here and elſe where with pinching paines and griping griefs euen to the laſt gaſpe, haue pitifully felt. For theſe kinde of men are ſo farre off from repayrers of mennes bodies, as they would ſeeme to bee that they are, rather marrers and manglers of men, women and children, without all care to men whome they ought to tender, foſter and cheriſh, without all conſcience to God, to whom they muſt one day render a reckoning of this their deſperate and diueliſh dealing.
            No man brought vp among Chriſtian mē of any practiſe or calling, but hath long ſithence learned this leſſon; how frayle, infirme, and weake ſoeuer our mortal bodies are, yet it hath pleaſed God to call them his owne temples, his owne inſtruments, and his owne dwelling places: an vnſpeakable

dignitie, farre aboue that for which Alexander Magnus ſo contended, when hee would needs bee called the ſonne of Iupiter.
            
            
               Paul to the Theſſalonians willing vs to keepe our veſſels, viz. our bodies in holyneſſe and honour, ſuggeſteth vnto vs theſe two poynts: firſt the fragilitie and mortality of our earthly bodyes, comparing them to veſſels of earth, and pots of clay, which break with a blow, &amp; periſh with a knock: ſecondly, that yet they are not our owne bodyes, to vſe as wee liſt to ſenſuality like bruite beaſts; but to keepe them carefully, as veſſels which the Lord hath clenſed and waſhed with his owne blood, to his owne glory in all holynes and honour.

               cked ſuppoſal, that in ſo doing they pleaſed God, grieuouſly ſinned (as diuers affirme) both agaynſt nature and godlines; againſt nature, becauſe no man euer yet hated his owne fleſh, but nouriſheth and cheriſheth it as the Lord doth the Church: againſt godlines, becauſe works of pietie and religion

in our ſelues or in others, they either quite ſurceaſe, or are greatly hindered when the bodies of men are decaied in ſtrēgth, weakned in vigor, languiſhed with ſicknes, or finally deſtroyed by death.
            To let paſſe theſe things which diuers deliuer out of their pulpits, of the excellencie and dignitie of mans body: haue not the Philoſophers in the ſchooles called the ſame Microcoſmos, Orbiculus, a little world moſt beautiful in forme, &amp; fayreſt in ſhape, excelling farre all other liuing creatures whome the creator hath made. In whoſe braine, as in primo mobili, is fixed that ineſteemable Iewel called Reaſon, no monſter or Idole, but the mother of all Artes &amp; Sciences, by whome (God guiding the ſame) are wrought &amp; inuented marueilous matters by Sea and by land, in euery matter of ſpeculation or practiſe. This I haue hitherto diſcourſed to this drift, that thoſe blinde buſſards, &amp; runagate Artiſts, might at length ſee and conſider that they are no way willed or warāted like butchers to cut, rend and teare, the bodies of men without skil, either in letting blod or any other practiſe

of Chirurgi, but like brethren to cure, repayr and amend that which is amiſſe, refuſing no paine taking for their own parts, nor reiecting due conſultation with men experienced, that ſo the noble Science of healing may be generally honored, the diſeaſed recouered, &amp; the skilful workman worthily in fine rewarded.
            To met with this miſchief acording to my Mediocritie, and that ſuch as are deſirous of this practiſe either for pleaſure or profite, might be ſomwhat fraughted with a few pithy inſtructions and neceſſary rules in the ſame, and ſo at length attaine to the moſt exquiſite cunning &amp; deep knowledge therof: I haue thought it good not onely to publiſh this my rude collection, conteining (if I be not deceiued) the whole handiwork of Phlebotomy, but alſo to counteruaile my default as rudely, (yet moſt hū
               bly) to requeſt your worſhips fauour for the protection thereof.
            But for as much as Seneca that chriſtian Ethnicke (for ſo dooth Eraſmus terme him, for his profound wiſedome &amp; deepe indgement) willeth vs in beſtowing of any

gift to be careful that it be fit for the eſtate of the giuer, and alſo meete for the condition of the receiuer, leaſt in ſtead of expected thanks diſgrace may growe, and what the giuer meaneth of good will, may perhaps by the receiuer either limping in iudgmēt, or freezing in delight, be little regarded, &amp; leſſe countenaunced: I am in a worde or two to ſhew that for my part I haue not (as I thinke) much ſwarued from the ſound aduiſe of the Philoſopher, in making your worſhip patron of my poore ſeely paines.
            Firſt for that euen your ſelfe haue already in print in your booke called The diſcouery of VVitchcraft, openly &amp; biterly enueighed againſt one ſort of blood thirſty men, as I doo nowe againſt another ſorte: namely witchmongers, who are daily and hourely without iuſt cauſe conuenting before Magiſtrates, and haling to the halter (if the Magiſtrates dexterity in the adminiſtration of iuſtice did not moderate their malice in murthering) poore, plaine, ſeely and ſimple innocents, and olde women: whom by friuolous euidences, incredible proofes, vayn gheſſes, preiudicate preſumptions, meere

impoſſibilityes they would haue condemned and executed for witches. Theſe men, in mine opinion, ſhould farre better pleaſe God, and much better deſerue, of the Chriſtian cōmon wealth, if they would ſpeedily turne from this their heatheniſh Infidelity, extream folly, &amp; barbarous cruelty, &amp; ſeek rather by due execution of lawe &amp; iuſtice the blood of theſe bloodſuckers indeede, who for want of skil in this profitable practiſe of blood letting, in euery corner of the countrey without controlment, either preſently kyl, or at leaſtwiſe accelerate the immature deaths of dyuers faythful Chriſtiās to God, and good ſubiects to their Soueraigne. A poore man that robbeth or killeth but one man, is ſtrayght way truſſed vp at Tyborne, and theſe deſperate dicks which range the countrey with a budget of groſſe ſtuffe, a boxe of ſalue, and a caſe of tooles, liuing in the Sanctuary of Idlenes, skilful in palmeſtry, tellers of fortunes, coū
               terfeyting themſelues to be Iewes or Egiptians: imitatyng doctor Tocrub, with ſtrāge lookes, diricks, pricks, croſſes, figures, and ſuch fooliſh fantaſies, may ſafely kill thouſands:

no moe thē come vnder theyr hands, which is as many as they can get; for who is ſo bolde as blind Bayard? and withal mē muſt giue them money for murthering, whereas if they had had their iuſt hire, they ſhould haue had hanging.
            Secondly, I haue thought your worſhip a meet perſon to dedicate this booke vnto, not ſo much for that it was penned at vacant times during mine abode at Scots Hall, vnder which roofe I came by your good meanes; but rather for that, thorow you whē the ſame was firſt penned it paſſed the view and apportatiō of that right worſhipfull and wiſe man M. Doctor Coldwel, a piller in this our age of that noble profeſſion. I aſſure you I thought my ſelfe happy to haue my little Latine examined by the direction of his iudgement to whoſe worthy and famous faculty, the matters therein mētioned were moſt properly appertaining.
            Thirdly for that being thorowly acquainted with your gentlemāly conditions, I am not ignorant of that ardent affection which you haue alwaies caried vnto your friends, Gentlemen I meane of like qualitie with

your ſelfe: for, Amicitia inter
                     •
                  ares, Loue is among like, as ſayth the Philoſopher, whome as you loue earneſtly in time of their felicity, and health, ſo you neuer loathe in their calamity or ſicknes, putting in vre that work of compaſsion &amp; Chriſtianity commended, and commanded vs in the Goſpel of viſiting the ſick: which work as you now execute frendly without feare, ſo in fine you ſhall not finde without reward. In viſiting your ſick friends, for iner peritura perituri viuimus: this booke (if you will vouchſafe to beſtow ſome vacant time in reading of it) may ſtand you and them in ſome ſtead, though not by cū
               ning in the practiſe, yet by counſell in aduiſe: for verily it contayneth the right Methode and way of healing, practiſed by the auncient fathers in Phiſick, Hippocrates, Galen and Auicen. And as you like a good Chriſtian defie al magical cures which ar but couſonages, &amp; would haue other men doo the like: ſo here you may ſpie a very ready way rightly to cure all humane diſeaſes, compendious &amp; not coſtly, both for your ſelfe and for your frined. To let paſſe

               Lyſimachus a worthy Captayne to Alexander, Artemiſia a noble Queene, Gentian King of Illyrica, King Salomō, &amp; Queen Saba taught by Salomon in the ſecrets of Phiſick and Nature, to the encouragement of all learned and wiſe gentlemen whatſoeuer they doo otherwiſe profeſſe) to take now and then ſome Phiſicall diſcourſe in hād. I produce the example of Dioſcorides, no meane gentleman, but a noble Knight of Egipt who ſerued Anthonius and Cleopatra like a worthy Souldier in the field, &amp; was ſo delighted euen on the midſt of his martial affayres with the ſtudy of Phiſicke and Surgery: that one way vz. in the noble knowledge of Oiles, he excelled all men before his time, or ſince.
            For my ſelfe that am the giuer, if it bee obiected that this labour is friuolous, for that other men of far greater gifts than my ſelfe, euen of the ſelf ſame profeſsion, haue writtē of this argumēt in the engliſh toung long agoe, as namelie Sir Thomas Eliot, &amp; Doctor Bullein, with diuers others, men of famous memorie▪ the one writing a Caſtle, the other a Bulwark of health: My anſwere

is, that hardlie diſcuſſe we that argument, whereof ſomething before to that or the like effect hath not bin extant; &amp; this I add beſide, that theſe men intreating of manie things in one booke, were conſtrained euen purpoſelie to pretermitte ſome, yea diuers needful inſtructions which here may bee had largely diſcuſſed.
            If it be ſaid that a matter of Phiſick is no fit argument for a Diuine to handle, albeit I might eaſily waſh away this with the apparant examples of diuers Diuines to the contrarie, as of old Doctor Turner, Doctor Penie, &amp; Doctor Coldwel: Now with diuers others yet will I ſay ſomwhat more, namely, that both theſe the Diuine and the Phiſition work vpō one ſubiect, they aſſemble themſelues in one place, vz. the chamber of the ſick, they both viſite and buſie themſelues about the ſick to doe him good, he is no longer Homo but Cadauer if there bee once a ſeparation of the ſoule from the bodie. Vbi deſinit-Philoſophus, ibi incipit medicus, where the Philoſopher endeth, there beginneth the Phiſition: ſo may it be ſaide likewiſe in ſome ſenſe, Vbi deſinit medicus,
               
               ibi incipit Theologus: where the Phiſirion fayleth for the bodies recouery, there the Diuine is required for the ſoules health. For mine owne parte I am fully perſwaded in mine owne conſcience (think or ſay others what they liſt) that I haue done more good to the Church of God and common welth of this land, in this ſimple tranſlatiō or collection, call it whether you wil (for I haue but borrowed it of others &amp; brought it into the engliſh) then diuers dogged Diuines of this age, Penry, Browne, Barrow, and the ſectaries I meane, who in ſtead of the true bread of life that came down from heauen, euen Ieſus Chriſt with his whole &amp; wholſome doctrine, fed moſt daungerouſly the ſoules of men with diuiliſh deuiſes, &amp; their owne fantaſies accounted thēſelues terrene Gods, &amp; deſirous of nothing more then among their auditors, to haue their own poſitions horrible &amp; hereticall tobe admired &amp; embraced as oracles from heauen. If the end of this more then Phariſaical hipocriſie be not the diſturbance of Gods peace &amp; the Queenes, the wiſeſt men in this land haue vtterly loſt their wittes, which theſe men

with al their learning, if they haue it in ſuch plenty as they would ſeeme to haue, ſhall neuer make me beleeue for a trueth. Experience of theſe daies prooue, that by the meanes of theſe men, we are al ſo generally infected with Cleargie factions and Laie factions, that as we are full of fanſies, ſo we follow nothing but factions, which I pray God ſpeedilie redreſſe for his great mercies ſake. Finally as Atheiſme is moſt iniuriou y obiected to him that holdeth theſe poſitions. God to be the creator of al things: That God only ſeeth &amp; ſearcheth the harts and reines of men: That he onely worketh miracles: That he onelie maketh thunder, lightning, and tempeſt, and reſtraineth thē at his pleaſure: That he onely ſendeth life &amp; death, ſicknes &amp; health, wealth &amp; woe, &amp;c. And as he is moſt wrongfullie &amp; wickedly adiudged a Papiſt, who detecteth the abomination of their Idolatries, their peſtilēt practiſes of knauerie &amp; couſonage, their abſurdities in opinion and impurities of life, (al which &amp; much more then I here now ſpeake of or can call to memorie) are extāt in print, &amp; ſo in the ſight of the whole

world if men would not be wilfully blinded: ſo by this little labour beſide the exerciſes of my peculiar profeſsion, it may euidently appeare what loue &amp; liking I haue alwaies borne to good, godlie and profitable ſtudies, and how I loath loytering; and ſo conſequentlie luſt which is an vnſeparable companion of Idlenes &amp; ſlouth, how I haue rather paſſed (as I hope) with commendation from Paul his Epiſtles to Galen de Sanitate tuenda for publike profit, than to Ouid his de Arte Amandi with condemnation for my priuate pleaſure.
            Good Sir as you haue been hitherto euē (as I may ſaie) zealous for my preferment, and likewiſe iealous ouer my credit, an aſſured teſtimony of your true loue toward me, ſo I beſeech you take in good worth at my hands this poore gift which I offer of pure good will, which if I once perceiue that you do, I ſhal think my trauail ſufficientlie recompenſed: and my ſelfe enforced during life to the accompliſhment of your good pleaſure, ſo far forth as my tenuitie ſhall be able anie waie to extend.
            
               Your Worſhips vnfayned welwiller &amp; to command in what I may, Nicholas Gyer, miniſter of the word.
            
         
      
      
         
            
            The Engliſh PHLEBOTOMY OR Methode and way of healing, by letting of bloud.
            
               Of fulneſſe, emptineſſe, and their diuiſions. Chap. 1.
               
                  THat this treatiſe of bloud-letting may haue an orderly proceeding; we muſt begin with Fulneſſe &amp; Emptineſſe, which haue betweene them ſelues a mutuall relation. Abundance or fulnes therfore is called of the Grecians Pleonexia: and after Galen in his booke De plenitudine it is two fold. One fulneſſe is in qualitie, as namely, when the bare qualitie exceedeth without Humor. The other is of quantitie, as aboundance of meat or of Humors.
               Aboundance of meat is called of the Grecians Pleſmone; of the Latines Sacietas: wher we are to note, that ſome interpreters tranſlate verie ill, for Pleſmone, repletio: as in the ſecond ofthe Aphoriſmes. Aphoriſ. 22. Quicunque morbi ex repletione fiunt curat euacuatio; when it ſhould be thus conuerted: Quicunque morbi ex ſatiaetate fiunt, &amp;c. All thoſe

diſeaſes that come of fulnes, euacuation doth cure.
               Abundance of meat, called of the Latines Satietas, is alſo two-fold, according to Galen in his 2. booke of Aphoriſines, Comen. 17. One according to the great largenes or capacitie of the veines or veſſels called of the Latines quo ad vaſa: as when ſuch abundance of meat is receiued, as thereby the ſtomacke is ouerſtretched: the other abundance is according to natures ſtrength, called quo ad vires: as when more meate is eaten, then natures force can well ouercome.
               Abundance of humors is alſo of two ſorts. One of all the humors called in Greeke Plethos or plethora: in Latine plenitudo, or multitudo: whereof Galen writeth in his 13. booke. Metho. cap. 6. Ʋbiautem aequaliter inter ſeſucci ad aucti ſunt, idem plethos &amp; plethoram Graecivocant, nos ſuccerum plenitudinem ſeu redundantiam dicimus. VVhen as the humors are equally increaſed betweene themſelues, that the Grecians cal plethos or plethora; we call it, abundance of humors. Now whereas Galen ſaith in his 2. booke de Compoſi. Medic. ſecundum locos, cap. 1. That to be abundance of humors, when onely bloud is increaſed: wee are to vnderſtand that bloud there ſignifieth impure bloud, &amp; ſuch as is mixt with other humors, called bloud, of that

which principaly there aboundeth. For it can not be, that only pure &amp; good bloud ſhould be conteined in the veines, without ſommixture of choller, flewme or Melancholie: which muſt be ſo likewiſe vnderſtood, where it is ſaide that any other humor aboundeth, the ſame is not pure alone without mixture of othets, but that humor ioyned with others aboundeth in the veſſels.
               The ſecond abundance of humors, is called in Greeke Cacochymia, in Latine Vitium ſucci, or vitioſus ſuccus▪
                   and it is when one humor alone aboundeth. Hereof alſo Galen ſpeaketh 13. Meth. cap. 6. Vbi flaua bile, nigra, vel pituita, vel ſeroſis humoribus repletū corpus fuerit: Cacochymia. i. ſuccorum vitiū dicimus. VVhen the bodie is replete with yellow or black choler, with flewme or watriſh humors, we cal it Cacochymia. i. corruption of humors. And in the end of his booke de Plenitudine he ſaith: Plenitudo est copia humorū in vniuerſo animalis corpore. Fulnes is abundance of humors in the whole bodie: &amp; a little after, he plainly ſheweth the differēce between Cacochymia &amp; Plethora.
               
               Plenitude or fulneſſe of humors, is alſo two-fold: one in regard of natures ſtrength, called Quo ad vires or virtutem: which is, when the humors ſo abounde, that they oppreſſe and much grieue the naturall forces

of the body. And although there be not ſuch aboundance of bloud in this fulnes quae ad vires, as is in the other quo ad vaſa: yet thoſe humors which are in the body, oppreſſe the powers of nature, whereupon nature being oppreſſed and not able to gouerne thoſe humors: they being as it were forſaken of nature, loſe their goodnes, and offorce putrifie. And of this fulneſſe theſe are the ſignes: heauines, ſtretchings, a ſenſible werines, hauing a feeling like an vlcer: of which Galen ſayeth 2. Aphoriſ. Aphoriſ. 5. Spontaneae laſsitudines morbos praenunciant: Voluntarie wearines forſheweth diſeaſes.
               The ſecond fulnes of humors called Quae ad vaſa is, when there is ſuch aboundance of humors or of bloud; that the veines and veſſels are greatly extended or ſtretched: ſo that it is to be feared, leaſt the veines themſelues breake. And therefore Hippo in the firſte booke of Aphoriſines: Aphoriſ. 3. woulde haue in wreſtlers this dangerous fulnes ſpeedily euacuated, that the bodie might begin againe to be nouriſhed. And this plenitude quae ad vaſa is either of pure bloud only, or of all humors with the bloud. And this fulneſſe hath theſe markes: redneſſe of color, ſwelling, veines full &amp; ſtretched. Of theſe two Plenitudes and their ſignes ſpeaketh Galen in his booke De Plenitudine, reckoning vp

theſe markes: ſwelling and ſtretching of the veines, redneſſe, lumpiſhnes of the bodie, a ſlouthfulneſſe in motion of the bodily members. Alſo Method. 9. Cap. 5. He reckoneth theſe ſignes of repletion quo ad vaſa: obſtructions, ſtretchings, ſwelling &amp; redneſſe: Of this twofold, read Auicen, Secunda primi doct. tertia. cap. 3. Alſo Galen in his booke De Plenitu. &amp; Metho. 9. Cap. 5. &amp; 10. lib. eiuſdem Cap. vltimo.
               
               Becauſe theſe pointes taken out of the bookes of auncient learned Phiſicions, may ſeeme as yet hard to the vnskilfuller ſort, that yet raſhly and without skill or regarde of theſe things vſe the practiſe of letting bloud: It will not be loſt labour in my poore iudgement, with more plaine wordes to illuſtrate their ſayings, if it may be, to the vnderſtanding of all men that are this way ſtudious, and yet want the helpe of the Latine tongue &amp; Latine writers.
               It appeareth by the premiſſes what Repletion is, vz, a ſuperfluous aboundance of humors in mans body, which happeneth two waies, either in quantitie or in qualitie.
               VVe may alſo learne, that repletion in quantitie, is when the foure humors are more in aboundance than is proportionable to the bodie that conteineth them, or when one humor much exceedeth the reſt in quantitie:

For the bloud contained in the veines is not ſimple, or of one kind, as hath beene ſaid; but conſiſteth of flewme, blacke &amp; yellow choler, and pure bloud mingled together, which humors notwithſtanding ſo mingled, by comon agreement and continuall vſe of ſpeaking: we commonly call bloud.
               The iuſt and agreable proportion of humors is this: That in a man throughly healthfull &amp; of good temperature: there is leſſe yelow choler than Melancoly: leſſe Melancoly than flewme: leſſe flewme than pure bloud: ſo that that bloud is accounted beſt, not that hath like proportion of all humors, but ſuch an equalitie of the foure, as hath beene now ſpecified.
               Bloud therfore faulteth in quantitie when the humors being ſetled in a iuſt proportion, do paſſe and exceede the agreable meaſure of Nature: for then the whole frame of the bodie ſwelleth; the veines aboue meaſure are ſtretched, and all the members, ſpecially after any exerciſe, are wonderfully retched. This conſtitution of humors, though they be good, yet it faulteth, beclauſe it is come to an immoderate abundance, which accuſtomably is wont to bring great perill. VVhether therefore there be in the bodie abundance of other humors aboue the bloud, ſo that the equabilitie of the proportion be not obſerued

that waie: or that there be too much abundance of pure bloud. Yet becauſe the pure bloud in the permixtion greatly exceedeth the other humors; it is a 
                     •
                  ault not in the qualitie but only in the quantitie: and therfore both of theſe are conteined vnder this kinde of repletion in quantitie: and this is ſimply, abſolutely, moſt properly, &amp; commonly iudged repletion, &amp; is called Plenitudo ad vaſa, as is aforeſaid, becauſe it doth throughly fill the large capacitie of the veines, which are termed the veſſels or receptacles of the body, though it enforce not the powers therof. Firſt therefore, where al the humors ſuperfluouſly increaſe, filling &amp; extending the receptories of the bodie, as the ſtomacke, the veines, and the bowels: It is moſt properly called in Engliſh fulneſſe or repletion in Latine plenitudo, in Greeke Plethora as before.
               Repletion in qualitie; is when the bloud or other humor is hotter or colder, thicker or thinner than is conuenient to the bodie. This is the ſeconde kinde of repletion, mentioned by the foreſaide auucient writers in Phiſicke, and which is referred to the force, ſtrength and abilitie of the bodie.
               In this repletion, although the veſſels of the bodie be not ſo much puffed vp, n
                     •
                  ither ſwell, as in the other: yet they conteine more good bloud and nouriſhment

than the nature of the patient can wel rule or ouercome: For a litle nouriſhment to a weak nature, is often troubleſome and grieuous: and although at the firſt it be right good; yet it doth not long ſo continue: but being forſaken of the bodily heat, as not able to concoct the ſame: in protract of time and number of daies, it corrupteth and becommeth the cauſes of diſeaſes.
               This conſtitution of the Greekes, properly called Cacochymia, is when the bodie is infarced either with choler yelow or black, or with flewme, or with watrie humors, and of late writers is thus defined: Cacochymia est vitioſa humoris qualitas, qua is a iuſta mediocritase deſciſcit: Cacochymia is a corrupted qualitie of the humors, by reaſon whereof the humor departeth from his iuſt mediocritie. Vnder which Cacochymia is contained all corruption of humors in qualitie: wherby the powers of the bodie are hindred from their proper functiōs, wherby alſo the whole bodie waxethfilthie &amp; daily decayeth.
               Of this corruption of humors in qualitie, one kind is ſomewhat better and more tollerable: as namely, when either ſuperfluous humors are exceſsiuely heaped vp together; or when the humors mixt with the bloud, do not keepe their iuſt and naturall concord or proportion: the other kind is worſe and intollerable:

when the ſuperfluous humors or iuces in the bodie, both primi &amp; ſecundarii, both the principal humors, and theſe next the principall are fallen into corruption, from their naturall and conuenient temperature, which is the deſtruction and corruption either of the ſubſtance or of the temperament. Againe both theſe happen ſometime with rottennes and putrifaction, ſometime without. VVhere note, moreouer that the name Cachochymia largely taken, comprehendeth alſo the corruption of the excrements. Hippocrates Aphoriſ. 15. ſaith, where meate is receiued much aboue nature, it cauſeth ſicknes. Galon in his Commentaries declaring that place ſaith, more meate then accordeth with natures meaſure, is named Replecion. And afterward hee expoundeth that worde aboue nature, to ſignifie too much and ſuperfluouſly: As who would ſay, where the meate is ſuperfluouſly taken, it cauſeth ſickenes. Meate but a little exceeding doth not forthwith cauſe diſeaſes, but may yet keepe the bodie within the bounds of health, for meat ingendring ſickenes muſt not a little, but much exceede the exquiſite meaſure.
               It appeareth by Galen that in his time certaine denied this foreſaide diuiſion of fulnes, ſet downe by the auncient writers, and approued of the late practiſioners, ſaying that

the ſame was to bee conſidered onely by the ſtrength of nature, granting plenitudo ſecundum vires, but not quo advaſae. Theſe he confuteth in his booke de plenitud. about the beginning in theſe wordes. Qui ex ipſis tantum viribus plenitudinem metiuntur hi videnter nunquam vtres praeter modum repletosvidiſſe, nec ſe etiamplus quapar eſt vnquam impleu
                        •
                     ſſe 
                        •
                     ibo ita vt ventriculus inde distenderetur. 1. Thoſe that meaſure Replecion onely according to the forces of nature; they ſeeme neuer to haue ſeene mens bodies puffed vp like bladders or bottels, neither at any time to haue ſtuffed themſelues with meate, more than moderation required, and whereby the ſtomacke was ouerſtretched.
               Againe, others in Galens time graunted onely that plenitude which is quo ad vaſa. and denied the other quo ad vires. Theſe hee confuteth in the ſame place in theſe vvordes. Itaque ſubiecimus duas eſſe tum notiones, tum relationes multitudinis: alteram ad robur virefque illi us qui defert, alteram ad eius qui ſuſcipit capacitatem. Ideſt, Therefore vve haue added that there are two notions and reportes of fulneſſe, one according to the ſtrength of the patient, the other after his capablenes.
               The diſcommodities vvhich happen by Replecion are manifold, moiſtnes thereby is

too much increaſed, and naturall heate quenched, againe naturall heate reſolueth ſomewhat of the ſuperfluous meate and drinke, and of that which is reſolued of meate vndigeſted, proceede groſſe and vndigeſted fumes, which aſcending vp to the heade, and touching the rim wherein the braine is wrapped, cauſeth headach, trembling of the members, dimnes of ſight, and many other diſeaſes.
               Moreouer the ſharpenes of the ſaid fumes, pricke and annoy the ſenſible ſinewes, whoſe roots are in the braine, and from thence paſſeth through all the vvhole body. The ſaid fumes ingendred of Replecion, and piercing the innermoſt part of the ſaide ſinewes called ſenſible, greatly annoy the animall powers, there beeing: by occaſion whereof Vnderſtanding and Reaſon both, as touching the vſe of them, are vvonderfully let and troubled, and likevviſe the tongue vvhich is Reaſons Expoſitor, is greatly depriued and hindred of his Office: As it appearethin them vvhich are miſerably drunk, and in thoſe vvhich haue moſt extreame and grieuous paines in their heade, proceeding of Replecion.
               Thus much harme commeth to the body by too much nouriſhment, and although the ſtomacke doo his Office in concoction, yet

the veins too abondantly filled, are ſpred out, diuided, ſtopped and ſtuffed with winde, and greatly grieued. It is apparant that of replecion and fulnes of the veines (then the which in diſeaſes a more hurtfull thing cannot chance) diuers infirmities doo come, and the replecion of the belly, though the exceſſe may be expelled by vomit or ſedge, and ſo is more tollerable than fulneſſe of the veines: yet it is likewiſe to bee diſallowed. If a man haue at any time too much ingorged himſelfe by and by he may aſſay to vomit: for though hee doo well digeſt it, yet there is ſome danger, leſt the veines be oppreſſed with fulnes: eſpecially when the party continually liueth intemperately, neuer regarding or minding euacuation. It is good therefore to vomit firſt, before the meates bee corrupted in the ſtomacke, if any impediment hinder vomiting, a ſedge by ſtoole is a preſent helpe. If neither ſerue, ſleepe long, and oft in drinke vſe warme water. VVhen the ſurfet is ſufficiently digeſted chiefly by ſedge, it is expedient to waſh and vſe fomentations. i. plaiſters mittigating paine, and a little to taſt of ſalt meates, and to drinke wine or beare alaid or tempered with water. Theſe things by the way touching remedies for ſurfetting, which in our daies is too vſuall, to the great diſhonour of God, and the certaine deſtruction of our bodies, yea,

and of our ſoules alſo, if GOD grantvs not grace ſpeedily to repent and amend. But if neither ſiege, nor timely digeſtion of the meate recemed, doo not inſue our ſurfettings; then the ſignes of replecion are to be looked for, which are ſet downe by Oribaſius Euporiſt. lib. 1. which are theſe that followe: as Loſſe of appetite, delight in nothing, ſloughthfulnes, dulnes of wit and ſenſes, more ſleepe than was accuſtomed, crampes in the bodie, ſtarting of the members, fulneſſe of the veines, thickenes of the pulſies, horror and ſhroueling of the bodie mixt with heate.
               But the generall ſignes of abundance of bloud are theſe: bleeding at the noſe chiefly forth of the right noſthrill, ſpitting of bloud, veines full and great, chiefly in the face, rednes of colour, a ponderous waightines of the whole body vnapt to any motion, an vnacuſtomed drowſines, a ſluggiſhnes of minde without any euident cauſe, the skinne ſtretched, pulſes very full, debilitie of ſight, grieuous dreames, plenty of ſweete ſpittle in the mouth, ſwellings and bluſhings in the face, heauines and painefull wearines in the ſhoulders as it were after labour or bearing great burthens, vrine thicke and red. Replecion knowne by theſe notes, except it be ruled by Phlebotomy or otherwiſe, it choketh the naturall heate of the body as Galen ſaith, 1. Aphoriſ.
                  
                  Aphoriſ. 3. Nimia repletio calorem natiuum extinguit. Too much fulnes extinguiſheth naturall heate. Alſo Metho. 13. cap. 6. Plethora tum ſanguinis miſſione curatur, tum frequenti balneo, exercitatione, fictione &amp; digerentibus medicamentis. Repletion is cured by bloud-letting, often bathing, exerciſe, rubbing, and digeſtiue medicines. Looke more in Galen 3. &amp; 6. de tuenda ſanita. Theſe men therefore in vvhome bloude ſo aboundeth, are to bee holpen by Phlebotomy, by opening Mediana or Cephalica, or applying of Boxing-glaſſes with ſcarrifieng the place firſt, or othervviſe as after ſhall bee declared. Remembring by the way, that if either purging ſeeme too long, or the opening of a veine cannot bee done accordingly: that in theſe caſes Electuarii ſucci Roſarum are good to purge bloud. But hereof there is no place to ſpeake further at this time.
               Finally it is very behouefull to knowe in vvhat place the corruption or ilnes of the contents of the body is placed, or where the Repletion is, before vvee can addreſſe our ſelues fitly to euacuate. That fulnes therefore vvhich of the Greekes, vve haue ſaid to bee called Plethora, is chiefly reſident in the veines and habite of the body, and this being an abundance of all the Humors in quantitie, is euacuated by bloud-ſetting or opening

a veine, and with cupping-glaſſes. The Repletion called Cachochymia beeing an abundance in quantity of one Humor, is i
                     •
                   the whole body or in ſome particuler part. If Cachochymia bee in the vvhole: it is euacuated by purgation, by generall ſweate, by abſtinence, and that kind called inſenſibilis euacuatio.
               
               
                  Cachochymia particuler is thus euacuated: If it bee in the belly, by vomit and by ſiege: If in the entrailes, vvith Cliſters, Suppoſitors, and by ſiege: If in the Liuer, by the Vrine: If in the Spleene, by the Hemorroids: If in the Breaſt, by Coughing: If in the Heade, it is purged through the Noſthrils and roofe of the mouth: If in the Raines or Bladder by Vrine: If in the Genitals by Venus: If in the Skinne, by Svveating, Reſoluing and vvith Cupping Glaſſes.
               And thus I conclude this firſt Chapter containing the chiefeſt and principall points concerning Fulneſſe, Emptineſſe, and their diuiſions. Not intending to vvrite any thing at all of the ſubtile and abundant definitions and deſcriptions of Galen in his book De plenitudine, and likewiſe in his Commentaries vppon the Aphoriſmes of Hippocrates.
               
               
                  
For I hope it hath here ſufficed, to ſhew what replecion is, the kinds thereof, the operations of them good or euill: remitting them which be curious, and deſire a more ample declaration, to the moſt excellent workes of Galen, where he may be ſatisfied, if he be not determined to repugne againſt reaſon.
            
            
               What Euacuation is, and of the kinds and differences thereof. Chap. 2.
               FOraſmuch as things contained in the body againſt nature, while they remaine in the body, are the inward cauſes of infirmities, which by Art eſpecially are to bee remoued: therefore then Euacuation, as a moſt generall remedy is firſt of al to be attempted. Euacua
                  
                     ••••
                   therefore is an expulſion of thoſe things which are contained in the body againſt nature. There are contained in the body theſe three, ſpirits, humors and excrements. The excrements are the ordure or reffuſe of the belly: vrine and ſuperfluous humors, ſent from the braine and the lungs. Humors ſome are ſuperfluous, ſome neceſſary properly called ſucci. 1. iuces. Humors ſuperfluous ſeparated from the bloud by natures force, and as vnprofitable for the nutriment of the body: are ſent a farre off. As flegme inhereth in the maw, ſtomacke, and about the entrailes.

yeallow choler in his proper coffer, namely the gall. Melancholy in the Spleene: The iuces are conuerted into the ſubſtance of the body, nouriſhing the ſame: Of this kind are thoſe iuces whereof the bloud is compact, &amp; thoſe otherwiſe called ſecundarii humores. Nowe each of theſe are ſometime agreeable to nature, ſometime repugnant to nature. They are agreeable to nature, when they retaine the right quality and quantity, according to the law of nature for conſeruation of health. They are repugnant to nature, when they keepe meaſure neither in quality nor quantity. And therefore whatſoeuer of theſe manifeſtly departeth from the iuſt meane and meaſure which nature hath appointed, (becauſe it is the cauſe of ſickenes) if otherwiſe it cannot be amended, it is altogether to be taken away and expelled, the expulſion whereof is called Euacuation.
               The differences of Euacuations are to bee taken of the ſcituation of the contents and corruptions, which are either Plethora or Cachochymia as was ſhewed in the Chapter precedent. The meats and drinkes receiued into the body, if the ſtomacke and liuer doo their naturall Office, bee altered by concoction, in ſuch wiſe, that the beſt part thereof goeth to the nutriment of the bodie, the worſt being ſeparated by the members Officiall from

the reſidue, are made excrementes in ſundry formes and ſubſtances: which excrementes are like in quality to the naturall Humor, which then raigneth moſt in the body. Theſe excrements are none other as was ſaid
                     •
                  , but matter ſuperfluous and vnſauory, which by the powers of nature may not be conuerted into fleſh, but remaining in the body corrupt the members: and therefore nature abhorring them, deſireth to haue them expelled. Theſe excrements are in number three, Ordure, Vrine, Humor ſuperfluous.
               Of Ordure are two ſortes, one digeſted which paſſeth by ſiege, the other vndigeſted expelled by vomit. VVhere I ſay digeſted I meane that it is paſſed the ſtomack, &amp; turned into another figure. Likewiſe I call that vndigeſted which ſ
                     •
                  il retaineth the figure of meat.
               Vrine is the watry ſubſtance of bloud, like as whey is of the m
                     •
                  ke, which out of the meate that is altred, concoct, or boyled in the ſtomacke, is ſtreyned in the veynes called Meſacaicae, which proceedeth from the hollow part of the Lyuer, and ſent by the Raines into the Bladder, paſſeth by the Inſtrument which is ordained as well for that purpoſe as for generation.
               Humor ſuperfluous is of three ſorts either mixt with any of the foure Humors called naturall, or elſe it is gathered into the braine,

or is betweene the skinne and the fleſh, or lyeth among the Synewes, Muſcles, or Ioynts: Of Humors ſome are more groſſe and cold, ſome are ſubtle and hot, and are called Vapors, Now to expell theſe excrements there are nine ſundry kindes of Euacuations. Letting of bloud, pargation by ſiege, abſtinence, vomiting, ſc
                     •
                  rrifieng or cupping, ſweat, vrine, ſpytting, ſternutation, bleeding at the noſe, bleeding by the Hemmorroids, exerciſe: and in women there naturall purgations▪ But in this Treatiſe I will onely handle that Euacuation which is done by opening of a veyne, by Cupping-glaſſes, and by Leaches, ſhewing the commodities which by the diſcrete vſing of theſe, come vnto the body of man.
               And that the way of Euacuation may bee the more eaſie: wee may deuide the body of man into three general Regions, which being incloſed in their proper limits, haue not onely diuers receptories of ſuperfluities, but alſo diuers waies to purge the ſame.
               One and the firſt Region is extended from the meat pipe called Gula to the middle part of the Liuer, wherein are contained the maw, the ſtomacke, the venies Meſecaicae, as many as come to the entrance, the hollow or inner part of the Liuer, the Spleene, and Pancreas, that is, a thing betweene fleſh and kernel lying betweene the ſtomacke and the Liuer.
               
                  
The 2. Region runneth from the middle of the Liuer, through the thin &amp; ſmall veines, of all and ſinguler partes, comprehending the outward part of the liuer, and euery hollowe veine and the greater artery placed by it, and vvhatſoeuer is betweene the Armehole and the flanks.
               The 3. Region comprehendeth the muſcles, the vppermoſt skinnes, the bones, and the whole maſſe of the body, which extendeth from the very entrance and leſſer veines through euery part and the outmoſt skinne it ſelfe. Great is the diuerſity of theſe Regions, for ſo much as they are ſo incloſed within their owne limits, that there is betvveene them no fellowſhip at all. But the greateſt diuerſity is in their owne proper operations, hauing concoctions, excrements, and waies of purging diuers one from the other. By obſeruation and marking whereof vve ſhall the better proceede in Euacuation.
               Beſide theſe generall and vniuerſall Regions of the body: there are ſome more ſpeciall and particular, hauing alſo excrements, yet not retching ſo far, nor following through the whole body, of which ſort are the braines, lungs, raines, and belly. Hereof are deriued tvvo differences of Euacuations: one generall, the other particular. That is a generall Euacuation which draweth matter vniuerſally

from the vvhole body. Of this ſort are Svveate, Bleeding, Vomits, Euacuation, by ſiege. Each of theſe (thogh ſpecially &amp; for the moſt part they euacuate one Regiō or part of the body. Yet theſe alſo empty other partes, though not ſo abundantly. As vomit firſt and chiefly euacuateth the ſtomacke, if it continue long, it purgeth alſo the bovvels and the greater veines, laſt of all the ſtate of the whole body. Euacuation by ſiege or purging: chiefly and moſt of all purgeth the entrailes, ſtomacke, bowels, and the firſt veines, then the greater veines; Laſt of all the ſmall veines and the ſtate of the vvhole body. Opening a vaine firſt exhauſeth the veines and arteries ioyned vnto them: then the body and all the bovvels euen til it proceede to the firſt veins. Euacuation by ſvveat called in Latine, perſpicatio or diſſipat io per cutem: Firſt diſſolueth from the habite or ſtate of the body. Secondly, from the greater veines and arteries. Laſtly, from the bowels and inwarde Region of the body.
               Particuler Euacuation doth onely alleuiate ſome particuler part loden vvith Excrements: Of vvhich ſort are, purging of the braine through the palate and noſthrils, ſpitting of fleame vvhereby diſeaſes of the breſt and lungs are eaſed: Piſſing forth of ſand and matter from the raines: Paſſage of bloud by

the belly or Hemmorroids: the one cleanſing firſt the lower part of the body called Podex, the other the belly, and both of them the hollow veyne called 
                     Ʋena caua. VVhen the wombe therefore is prouoked either with a Cliſter or a Suppoſitory, or whatſoeuer eruption bee made in any other place through the skinne, it is likewiſe a particuler Euacuation. Again, of Euacuations, ſome are of their owne accord, ſome are done by Art. Naturall or voluntary Euacuation, is when any thing is expelled out of the body without any medecine, this chanceth ſometime euen naturally: For nature while it is in health, rightly gouerneth the ſtate of the body, and doth expell thence whatſoeuer ſuperſluouſly aboundeth or is corrupted; this Euacuation is both naturall and conuenient. This alſo chaunceth ſometime contrary to nature, as when the ſtrength of the body is ſo infeebled, that it cannot gouerne and reſtraine the Humors of the body, but letteth them quite flow forth: or when the vertue is ſtrong, yet it is ſomtime ſo prouoked either with abundance or acuity of the Humor, that it permitteth the Humor to paſſe of his owne accord out of the proper veſſels and receptories thereof: Both theſe are accidentall, vnprofitable, and beſides nature; becauſe the good bloud commeth forth mingled with the bad without choiſe or order.

Artificiall Euacuation is when the ſame commeth by outward help &amp; this is two fold.
               The one right profitable, onely Euacuating that which offendeth in iuſt quantity, &amp; quality. The other contrary to this, extraordinary and vnprofitable, exhauſing the Humor that annoieth not, which commeth by the vnskilfulnes of the Phiſition. Nature by her owne force, and by the vertue expulſiue, accompliſheth her Euacuation. The Phiſition doth his, by diuers neceſſary helps prouided for the ſame. And in letting bloud he openeth the veyne either with a fine penkife, ſleme, or lancet, or ſome other applyable medicin. Purgation hee attempteth with medicins, expelling euil humors from the body either by vomit, or by ſiege. Alſo he expelleth euill humors by breathings, euaporations, exerciſe rubbings, mouings, heat, bathings ſpecially ſulphurious, &amp; accidentally by abſtinence. Alſo the Phyſition vſeth particular Euacuations in particular parts (as ye haue heard) Hee purgeth the braine through the noſthrils by medicaments called in Greeke Errhinae. And through the palate of the mouth with medecines called, Apophlegmatiſmi, which chewed in the mouth bring Humors from the head, the breſt, and lungs, with medecines called Berhica. The Raines and Bladder with Diuretica. The wombe or belly with Hysterica. Againe,

the belly is ſoftned with ſuppoſitories and cliſters: againe euacuation or eruption is made in particular parts by medicines called Digerentia.

               What Phlebotomy is and from whence the opening of a vaine doth e uacuate. Chap. 3.
               FOR ſo much as the bloud in generall is mixed with the foure Humors which are alſo bedewed as it were with a thin watry ſubſtance, and that they all are ſo mingled together

through the heat and concoction of the Liuer, that neuer an humor can be ſeene, neuer ſo little, to be ſeuered from the others therefore, I ſaie, the retentiue vertue cannot ſo ſtrongly hold back the bloud in the crooked ſmall veines when a great vaine is opened, and that with a ſufficient large wound: but the ſame will iſſue and come foorth. If by chaunce it happen that the retentiue vertue go about gredily to ſuppreſſe the bloud, yet at length it will poure it out plentifully with oft handling &amp; rubbing of the veines. Neither doth this or that humor by it ſelfe alone come foorth, as in purging: but bloud generally; that is to ſaie, mixt with other humors in the veines.
               Touching the definition what it is: Phlebotomia (which is worde for worde out of the Greeke, the cutting of a veine:) is an artificiall eduction of bloud, either abounding iu quantitie, or offending in qualitie, by opening of a veine. I call it an artificiall inciſion, becauſe it muſt not want art and iudgement: For in it, conſideration muſt be had of the inflicted wound: of the quantitie of the bloud: of chooſing the apteſt vaine: either to pull backe bloud, or to euacuate it quite: or to make it onely leſſe in quantitie. Alſo, for that conſideration is to be had, whether the veine muſt be opened ſtreight downe, or

ouerthwart, of the ſame ſide of the bodie, or of the other: with diuers conſiderations beſides, whereof we will ſpeake in their proper places. Therefore Phlebotomie which is one of the greateſt remedies, the Phiſition vſeth, is for good cauſe defined an artificiall kind of educing. Galen in his 2. Aphoriſ. Coment. 17. defineth it to be an exquiſite euacuation of al the humors equally. Auicen defineth it vniuerſalem euacuationem, quae multitudinem humorum euacuat: or thus Vena ſectio est vniuerſalis euacuatio, quae anctionem humorum ſuper aequalitatem in venis exuperantium, euacuat. i. an vniuerſal euacuation which taketh away abundance of humors, repleniſhing the veines aboue meaſure.
               Though the bloud in the veines be in a moderate meane, or but little in quantitie, yet of the proper mouing, &amp; vehemencie of it ſelf it iſſueth out: nature litle or nothing at al protruding the ſame. Phlebotomie indifferently euacuateth both good &amp; bad humors conteined in the veines with the bloud. Neither in diſeaſes proceeding of corrupt conſtitution of humors, can nature ſo moderat the matter, as that, that humor alone ſhal flow forth that aboundeth in quantitie or offendeth in qualitie. I confeſſe, that in the iudicials of diſeaſes, called Criſes, many times nature ſeparateth &amp; as it were, excludeth by wayes conuenient,

thoſe ill humors prepared before by concoction: yet notwi
                     •
                  hſtanding, if then at that inſtant we open a veine, nature cannot therby in ſo ſhort time expel the hurtfull humor.
               Whereas Auicen ſaith, Phlebotomie eu
                     •
                  cuateth good bloud, the ill remaining behind, &amp; that he feareth, leſt opening a veine bring the patient, either to abundance of hot chollerik humors, or cruditie of flegmatike humors: if he mean it of the humors mixt in the veines, it is moſt falſ: for neither doth the watrie humor iſſue forth before choler, nor choler before flewme, or Melancoly, nor the bad humor before the good. VVhich daily experience proueth to be true: for when the bloud commeth forth, it appeareth ſimple &amp; of one forme: but in the porrenger it loſeth his colour, &amp; euery part therof congeleth ſe
                     •
                  crally in his own region. The watrie humor ſwimmeth aboue, not farre vnlike v
                     •
                  ine. Thinne choler &amp; the flowring part of the congealed bloud, is alſo aboue next the water. Melancoly abideth in the bottom: the red bloud &amp; the paler flewme keepe in the middle region. So that opening of a veine euacuateth all humors which are in the veines equally.
               VVe are here to ſet downe, from what place the evacuation is made: for, inaſmuch as bloud is moyſt and flowing: that firſt iſſueth forth which is next the opened veine,

then that which is next the ſame: thirdly, commeth foorth, not onely that which is in the veines and arteries, but alſo that which is in the bowels and whole habite of the body. For there is a wonderfull continuation and order of the veines, ſo that a way being once made, all the bloud often times floweth out of the bodie, and bringeth death to the partie. But when the paſſage is ſtayed, then the bloud is ſent foorth by the veines &amp; arteries, till there be a certain proportion in the whole bodie: For the emptied and wanting partes by the long ſmall veines draw bloud forth of the full partes, &amp; repleated members; and ſo 
                     ••••
                  or them, as it were in their need. Againe, the full members grieued with too much aboundance, vnburthen them-ſelues on the veines that are emptied. Againe, the humor being liquide and flowing voluntarily followeth the lower euacuated regions, and there continueth: whereupon it followeth, that whenſoeuer bloudletting ſhall emptie the veines; the ſame alſo ſhall euacuat the whole bodie. In regard whereof Phlebotomy in the definition thereof, is called verie well an vniuerſall euacuation, and that for two cauſes. Firſt, becauſe it withdraweth all humors whereof the bloud conſiſteth. Secondly, becauſe it euacuateth from the whole bodie; but yet not in like ſort. Foraſmuch as the

partes of mans bodie are placed in their order: therefore firſt it exhauſeth from the neere partes, then from thoſe that are further off. And againe, foraſmuch as ſome veines are ſpred into ſome partes of the bodie, and other into other partes: therefore bleeding with more celeritie and force draweth from thoſe partes which are rightly and directly placed, then from thoſe members, which are oppoſite or ouerthwart.
            
            
               Whether Phlebotomie must go before purging▪ or contrarie. Chap. 4.
               IN this place it is a neceſſarie queſtion to be moued, and aunſwered; whether bleeding or purging muſt go firſt, in this caſe (which is verie frequent) where they are both requiſite. Some will alwaies haue, that when purging is neceſſarie; bleeding muſt go before
                     •
                   and they bring out the authorities of Hippocrates and Galen. Others contrarily affirme that alwaies ſome extenuating or leſſening receit called barbarouſly Medicamentum minoratiuum muſt be firſt receiued, and them Phlebotomie ſucceede. But of theſe opinions neither is ſimply true, and yet both true, as the caſe may be limitted. And for the caſes wherein a gentle purgatiue is to proceed
                     •
                   
                  Phlebotomie: they are in number theſe ſixe.
               
                  
Firſt, when the ſtomacke, the Meſecaicae veines, the great veines, &amp; the waies &amp; paſſages of the bodie, or any of theſe be ſtuffed with filth, or incombred with crudities: or that the excrements are hardened in the bowels, although the whole bodie abound with bloud beſide, yet a gentle &amp; eaſie receit is to be taken; as Manna, Caſsia or a cliſter (but no violent receit) which may euacuate from the foreſaid veines, &amp; open the obſtructed paſſages. If the bloud ſhould firſt be drawen forth without ſome gentle purgation or euacuation in the greater veines: then the veines outwardly exhauſted by bleeding, through their attractiue vertue, would drawe vnto them ill iuces; ſpecially, if the diſeaſe require any plentiful bleeding. This is affirmed by Auicen &amp; Galen. 9. Metho. cap. 5. who did vſe to refraine from Phlebotomie, if there were cruditie of meat in the ſtomake, or rawnes in the veines called Meſecaicae, til their concoctiō wer ended, &amp; the excremēts deſcended.
               Secondly, when the bloud is verie viſcous, clammie &amp; groſſe, we do not only take medicines attenuating, but alſo leſſening things &amp; a dyet conuenient to prepare bloud: and to make the mēber bleed the better, vſe a bath: for oft it commeth to paſſe, that a veine being opened, no bloud iſſueth forth, becauſe of the thicknes &amp; clammineſſe thereof.
               
                  
Thirdly, it faleth out in many cholerike bodies, that choller contained in the vpper parte of the ſtomacke is eaſily moued, &amp; ſo boileth cauſing Lipothymia. i. ouercoming: in which caſe it behoueth to vſe before ſome Minoratiue receit, &amp; alſo in bleeding to vſe ſomewhat to keepe backe the boiling of choller.
               Fourthly, in diſeaſes wherein appeareth a difficultie by reaſon of Cacochymia or abundance of other humors mixt with the bloud. When a practiſioner perceiueth that he muſt vſe Phlebotomie, &amp; yet with ſome difficultie; in this caſe he may vſe ſome eaſie purgation, or one of ſome force: whereby it may fall out that nature ſhal thereby ſo be eaſed (which the ſiege &amp; eaſe of nature wil ſhew thee) that thou ſhalt not need bleeding at all, but onely preparation of the matter, &amp; then to renue the educing thereof as before.
               Fiftly, remember Au
                        •
                     cens ſaying: Sanguis fraenum cholerae existit: bloud is the reſtrainer of choler: therfore in diſeaſes mere cholerik, it were a raſh part to ſet bleeding before purging, which perhaps thou maiſt be without, after the exhibiting of the medicine. And if thou vſe the patient wel; let thoſe things ſuffice, which change or repell the ſharpnes of choller. Yet this is to be added, that if there ſhuld be ſuch abundance of choller as might cauſe a ſwelling aboue nature or inflamation; then bleding vpon that, is a preſent help.
               
                  
Sixthly, the ſame reaſon may ſerue in flegmatike conſtitutions. Wherein for many cauſes (although no ſmall fulneſſe appeare) yet we are not to vſe Phlebotomie before purging.
               The caſes wherein Phlebotomie preceedeth purging are theſe. Firſt, when great fulnes appeareth, which either hath cauſed, or is like to cauſe any vehement diſeaſe, as Apoplexia, which is a ſicknes engendred of groſſe humors, filling the receptories or veſſels of the braine, and thereby depriuing the partie of feeling, ſpeach, and mouing: as Peripleumonia, which is an inflamation or an apoſtume of the lungs, with a vehement Feuer, comming ſometime of it ſelfe, but moſt commonly following vpon great and ſharpe rewmes, ſquinances, pleuriſies, or ſuch like diſeaſes: as Suffocation; which is in Engliſh, ſtrangling: then &amp; in this caſe without faile, and chiefely if the wombe be laxatiue, vſe letting of bloud without precedent purgation. And this ſeemeth to agree with Galen lib. 10. de Compoſi. medica. ſecundum locos, ca. 2 VVhere he ſaith: if the bodie doe equally abound with humors: firſt let bloud &amp; then purge. And hereunto Auicen accordeth in quarta primi Cap. 4. This (ſaith he) is a truth, and the precepts of Hippocrates in lib. Epidemionium: that if both bleeding and purging

be neceſſarie, and that the purgatiue muſt be vehement, then begin with Phlebotomie.
               
               Secondly, in dangerous fluxes of bloud out of the noſe, or in ſpitting of bloud called Hoemoptoicapaſsio, or in bluddie fluxes: for to turne the matter a way in full bodies, wee preſently let bloud without medicine going before.
               Thirdly, in wraſtlers abounding with bloud: to whom the ſame abundance threatneth ſome great danger, &amp; that it is preſuppoſed that there are no ill humors in the circuite or compas of the bodie; in this caſe wee vſe Phlebotomie without purging.
               Fourthly, we may ſafely let blond (without medicine) thoſe that are whole, &amp; for abundance of bloud only, are accuſtomed to yerely bleeding; and that haue in the yere taken little or no Phiſicke, as it chanceth to many perſons in many countries of the North.
               Fiftly, we may open without purging, the inner vaine of the arme, in women with child, if they carrie Corpora Phletorica, full bodies, &amp; that in the 5. 6. or 7. moneth after the conception: yea &amp; alſo before they be quicke. This practiſe wee are to vſe ſpecially, when they being with child, waxe verie ſlowe, heauie, &amp; as it were, ouerladen with abundance of bloud, we may take Salua tella veine: or if plenitude ſo require; the inner veine of the

arme: for the quantitie reſpecting a diſcreete moderation.
               Sixtly, we may let thoſe bloud without medicine, that haue fallen from ſome high place, &amp; taken hurt in the breſt and ſtomacke, in whome is to be feared an inconuenience called of the Greekes Egchymoſis.
               
               Seuenthly, we ſpeedily let bloud ſuch perſons, without further Phiſick, as by reaſon of their fulnes through ſome accident, as feare, or ſuch like, waxe domme; in which caſe wee let bloud abundantly, ſo that both armes are opened together.
               Here I am to note a great error in Auicen; both repugnant to trueth it ſelfe, and alſo contrarie to Galen: For Auicen affirmeth, that when colde and thicke humors are in the bodie: firſt wee muſt begin with purging, and then open a veine. Diuers and many waies hath he erred in this. Firſt, becauſe in flegmatick humors, groſſe and colde mixt with bloud, hee woulde haue Phlebotomie not vſed before purging. And in this caſe, by all likelyhood of reaſon, the cure ſhould begin with bleeding. Secondly, in this hee diſſenteth from Galen, who 11. Method. Chap. 4. though there were obſtructions in the bodie of thicke and clammie humors: yet firſt hee would begin the cure with Phlebotomie.
               
               
                  
If Auicens meaning be, when flegmatike humors ouercome the bloud in multitude or abundance, that then wee muſt firſt vſe purging; then is hee greatly deceiued, for as much as hee proponeth a caſe in which Phlebotomie ſhould not auaile, except with thoſe many colde humors there be alſo ſome exceſſe of bloud, which chaunceth verie ſildome or not at all. But it may ſeeme that Auicen hath reaſon, namely this: that the bloud being extracted; thoſe humors would waxe more rawe: and ſo by opening a veine, the patient is brought to a marueilous cruditie of colde humors. This is no reaſon: for by Phlebotomy wee detract bloud; not becauſe of obſtructions, cauſed of groſſe and colde humors, but becauſe bloud ſuperaboundeth. For the ſtopping is afterward remoued with other helpes. Therefore, when obſtruction concurreth with abundance of bloud; wee muſt not extract verie much bloud, but keepe backe ſome, till the time of the cure, as Galen teacheth 11. Method. Chap. 14.
               
               And thus much, of the order betweene Phlebotomie and Purging: whereby wee ſee that a ſtrong purgatiue muſt followe bleeding: and that an eaſie purgation or cliſter may go before.
            
            
               
               Of the effectes, that is, Of the profits and diſprofits of opening a veine. Chap. 5.
               
                  Schola Salerni, in two verſes reckoneth vp three effects of bleeding:
               
                  Exhilerat triſtes, iratos placat, amantes
                  Ne ſint amentes, Phlebotomia facit.
                  It ſwageth wrath, and cheeres the ſad:
                  Preſerues loue-ſick, from being mad.
               
               FIrſt, it maketh glad thoſe that are penſiue. Secondly, it appeaſeth ſuch as are angrie. Anger is eſpecially cauſed through mixture of much yellow choler with bloud. And ſadneſſe, by commixture of much Melancoly with bloud. And foraſmuch as both theſe humors, choler &amp; Melancoly are exhauſted with the bloud, theſe two effectes muſt conſequently follow. Thirdly, it preſerueth loue-ſicke perſons, from madneſſe, by drawing humors from the head to the lower partes, and ſo expelling the ſame.
               Although occaſion will hereafter better ſerue to ſhewe the cauſes why wee vſe Phlebotomy: yet here nowe ſpeaking of the effectes, I will briefely ſhewe fiue cauſes, for which wee vſe to let bloud, and by the which may be gathered the profitable effectes of this practiſe: of the which fiue cauſes; one

onely cauſe is the direct, the other foure are indirect.
               The direct cauſe of bleeding is euacuation of the bloud. But foraſmuch as bloud is good for nature, therfore Phlebotomy muſt be vſed 
                     •
                  duiſsdly: that the ſame bloud only may be expelled, which is vnprofitable &amp; hurtfull to nature. Bloud, as you haue partly heard, is made vnprofitable to nature two waies: either when it doth not throughly keepe the proper qualitie that it cannot ſo nouriſh as it did before when it was good: or when in quantitie it ſo increaſeth, that it either preſſeth downe the powers of the bodie, or ſtuffeth &amp; ſtoppeth both the veines &amp; the arteries: In theſe two caſes, bleeding is good, as one of the direct euacuating helpes. Yet in theſe caſes bleeding is not to be vſed indifferently, but with this difference: in abundāce of bloud, much may be detracted: In little plentie, ſmall euacuation ſerueth. Hereupon Galen writeth lib. 9. cap. 10. Method. Si ſanguis vitioſus in corpore fuerit, paulatim quod vitioſum eſt, euacuare oportet, &amp; paulatim ad in o icem quod ſalubre est, pro eo reponere. If corrupt bloud be in the bodie, wee muſt by little &amp; little take away the bad; and by litle &amp; litle procure in the place therof, that which is good: which way of curing or amending of corrupt bloud, the Phiſicions call in Greeke

                  Epicraſis. And to this Alexander Tralleanus ſubſcribeth lib. 9. ca. 2. The reaſon why this is not to be done at once, is for that the powers of the bodie would relent &amp; giue ouer. And although that which is euacuated be ſuperfluous: yet by a ſudden &amp; thorough mutation, it doth more hurt than good. It is better therefore to emptie the bodie ſafely, and by little at once, than by making haſt, to diſpatch both the diſeaſe &amp; the partie diſeaſed.
               And here it appeareth, how much they abuſe Phlebotomy which detract the ill bloud ſo long, til the good alſo begin to come: wheras it may fall out, that all the bloud will flowe forth of the bodie, before that the good will appeare. It behoueth therefore the euacuatiō to be little. And (as Gaelen councelleth in this caſe) before the opening of a veine, to vſe Epicraſis. i. to giue the patient ſuch meat, as may cauſe good bloud; that good bloud may ſtill come in place of the bad: and then a little after, more bloud may be taken. This therfore is called the direct bleeding, becauſe it is don of it ſelf, to euacuate that which by opening a veine ought in deede to be withdrawen: namely, multitude of humors &amp; of bloud, of bloud principally; &amp; of humors ſecondarily: in aſmuch as they are mingled with the blod. The other are called indirect cauſes: and are vſed only to reuoke or call backe the violent

force of humors to the contrary part, or to turne the fluxe of them aſide another way.
               The firſt indirect cauſe is, for the greatnes of a diſeaſe, or for vehement inflamation of an impoſtume: for in apoſtumatiōs of great heat, in hote feuers, &amp; in vehement griefes, there is not found a more excellent remedie than opening of a veine.
               The ſecond indirect cauſe is, to allure the matter to the place of euacuation. Therefore in ſtopping of Termes or Hemorroids, the veine Saphena is to be opened. Fulnes cōming by ſuppreſsion of Termes is to be euacuated by the legges from the knee to the anckle, whether we cut a veine, or vſe ſcarifying, or launcing: for veines opened in the armes of weomen, reuoke &amp; draw vpward their naturall purging.
               The third indirect cauſe is, that the humors may be turned to ſome other place, contrary or oppoſite to the place, vnto the which they flow of their own accord. Therfore in immoderat fluxe of Termes, we open the Baſilica veine, that is the inward veine of the arme, which is alſo called Hepatitis; that the matter being called to a contrarie place, may be turned from his fluxe.
               The fourth indirect cauſe is, that ſome part of the matter being takē away by bleeding; nature may the more eaſily ouercom, the reſt:

For the vertue of the bodie being weaker, then that it can rule ſuch aboundance of humors, wee take away by bleeding ſome portion of them, leaſt thorough impotencie and debilitie of nature, the ſame humors ſhould flowe to the weaker members, and there breede apoſtumations, and ſwellings contrarie to nature. But of this more ſhal be ſpoken at large in the proper place therof, namely in the Chapter of reuulſion and deriuation of plucking backe, and turning aſide of the bloud &amp; of humors.
               Touching the vtilitie of bleeding: great is the profit therof: For Galen reporteth that therewith he hath oft cured feuers: and that it is boldly to be taken in hand when neceſſitie requireth it. Therfore we may worthily blame thoſe, which in our time, contrarie to Galens iudgement, &amp; againſt reaſon &amp; al experience, ſpeak euil of this profitable practiſe.
               Firſt, it ſharpeneth the ſight, making the ſame more cleare: the reaſon thereof is, for that it diminiſheth thoſe humors which thorough their fumes, hinder the clearnes of the eies: ſo that conſequently the ſight thereby is ſharpened.
               Secondly, it purgeth the braine, &amp; ſharpeneth the wit, by the foreſaid reaſon.
               Thirdly, it heateth the marrow, waſting thoſe ſuperfluous humors, by whoſe commixture

&amp; flowing the marrow in the bones waxeth cold.
               Fourthly, it purifieth all the ſenſes, taking away thoſe fumes and euaporations, which aſcend vp to the head, and there trouble the ſenſes.
               Fiftly, it purgeth the bowels and entrailes: The reaſon is, becauſe nature gouerning the body, being disburdened of that bloud which was (as it were) an oppreſſion to nature, and greued her (as it were) with ſome heauy burden: doth now with eaſe concoct and ouercome rawe and rude humors deteined in the bowels.
               Sixtly, it ſtayeth vomits and laskes: for it draweth the humors from the inwarde parts, to the outward parts. VVherevnto Auicen agreeth writing thus, Phlebotomia propteriae quod ad diuerſum trahit, naturam ſecundum plurimum retinet. Phlebotomy, becauſe it draweth to the contrary part, therefore commonly it reteineth nature. In which place it is to be vnderſtood that in fluxes of the womb, the veine of the Arme is to be taken, which preſently helpeth: But if you doo otherwiſe, that is, take the veine in the foote, or legge, it profiteth nothing. Sometime it chanceth that the belly by opening of a veine is more flowing than before, and that eſpecially chanceth two waies: firſt becauſe nature being disburdened

by bleeding, ſtrength is increaſed: ſo that ſometime it ſtirreth vp other euacuations, as namely by ſiege. The ſecond way is when through imbecility of the retentiue vertue, which imbecility by opening of a veyne is increaſed, ſo that the wombe is more ſtirred and prouoked.
               Seauenthly, it profiteth againſt immoderate watching, for it emptieth abundance of humors, from the which commonly diuers ſharpe fumes aſcend vp to the head and hinder ſleepe.
               Eighthly, it taketh away heauines, ſluggiſhnes, &amp; wearines of the body. For, as hath bin already ſaid before, bleeding disburdeneth nature, which ruleth our bodies of multitude of humors; which before was preſſed downe by them &amp; oppreſſed with them. And again, Melancholly, the chiefeſt cauſe of heauines, is expelled with the bloud, as the dregs and grounds thereof.
               Ninethly, it cureth difficulty of hearing, abating abundance of humors whoſe thicke &amp; ſlatuous ſpirits, carried vpward into the head, ſtop the hearing port and paſſege of the eares.
               Tenthly, it helpeth the voice, taking away ſuperfluous humidi
                     •
                  ies, which too much moiſten the arterie, or veyne of the voyce, and ſpeaking. From which humidities horcenes of ſpeech proceedeth,
               
                  
Eleuenthly, it refreſheth and increaſeth the powers and ſtrength of the body: For the body beeing freed from a multitude of humors, muſt of neceſſity haue the vertue and ſtrength thereof augmented. Theſe commodities of bleeding, are thus ſet downe in verſe by Schola Salerni.

                  To eare, to tongue, it brings reliefe,
               
               To be ſhort, theſe are the commodities of Artificiall bleeding: therby the organs of the ſenſes are cleanſed: weake bodies are made ſtrong, if yeares ſerue. By it are helped Repletions, Plureſies, hot tertians, frenſies, peſtilences and d

                  uers other diſeaſes as ſhall appeare in the Chapter enſuing.
               The onely diſprofit in bleeding is this, that the vitall ſpirits thereby are 
                     •
                  havven

foorth which thing Galen witneſſeth in his booke de Scarrificatione: ſaying, to open a veine oft in the yeare, I iudge not profitable: for with much bloud the vitall ſpirits are alſo exhaled: which beeing done too often, waſteth the whole body, making the ſame cold, and cauſing the liuely operations thereof, to waxe worſe and worſe. To frequent bleeding therefore bringeth on old age apace, and maketh the ſame ſubiect to many diſeaſes, as the dropſie, gowt, ſhakings, palſies, falling ſickeneſſes, and apoplexies. For naturall heate being too much cooled, and the principall moyſture diminiſhed: the bowels languiſh and crudity ruleth with many flegmaticke humors, which are the cauſes and originall of the foreſaid cuils. This Schola Salerni remembreth: And Auicen in primo teſtefieth the ſame.
               The beſt remedy to recouer vitall ſpirites decaied, is drinking of wine: for wine among things nouriſhing quickly and in ſhort time is the moſt principall. By meats alſo vitall ſpirits are recouered in time, but not ſo ſoone. Wherin is to be noted, that after bleeding muſt be taken meate eaſie of digeſtion, of good iuces, and of much nouriſhment, as potched-egs, &amp; ſuch like: which meate eaſie of digeſtion muſt be taken moderately the firſt and ſecond day after bleeding, as Rhaſes counſelleth writing

to Almonſ. lib. 7. cap. 21. For the vertue digeſtiue, made weake by bleeding cannot ouercome as yet much meate. Herevpon alſo Iſaacus in his dyets writeth thus: Meate to ſuch as haue bled, is to be withdrawen and diminiſhed; but drinke to be augmented, for in reſpect of the meat, drink is to be augmented; not in regard of his former vſe of diet: that now he may drinke more than hee was accuſtomed: for in truth, he muſt drinke leſſe than hee did before bleeding: becauſe the vertue concoctiue (as ye haue heard) is yet too weak to beare much abundance of drinke. The words of Schola Salerni touching this matter are theſe,
               
                  Spiritus vberiorque exit per Phlebotomiam.
                  Spiritus ex potu vini mox multiplicatur,
                  Humorumque cibo damnum lente reparatur.
               
               
                  Abundant ſpirite with bloud doth paſſe,
                  yet drinke of wine doth it reſtore:
                  By helpe of meate the ſame alaſſe,
                  will hardly come as twas before.
               
            
            
               Of Revulſion that is pulling backe, and deriuation, that is, turning aſide of bloud and Humors by opening of a veine. Chap. 6.
               REvulſion is a prouided remedy for bloud flowing out of the noſe or belly,

or that floweth to any part like them to cauſe inflammation. It is called in the Greek Antiſpaſis: That is, a turning to the contrary way: in Latine Reuulſio, that is, a pulling backe; and as the word impotteth, ſo is it deſined, a drawing of the running humor into the contrary part. Nothing can more ſpeedely keepe backe the force of a Fluxe than this practiſe. Now for to vnderſtand which is the contrary part, we muſt note that the Mathematicks call thoſe contraries, which be the extremities of one and the ſelfe ſame ſtraight line, which ſtand furtheſt off in a ſtraight proceeding or going forth of the ſelfe ſame vein; through whoſe paſſages the humors haue their courſe. For a veyne beeing opened, firſt the part next the wound is euacuated; &amp; that euacuated part draweth the bloud out of the further part. And foraſmuch as opening of a veine doth thus euacuate (through the helpe of the ſmall ſtraight veynes which nature hath ordained to allure and draw, as ſhee hath the ouerthwart veynes to expell:) The ſame opening of a veyne (I ſay) will prouoke more bloud and in ſhorter time from thoſe parts where the ſtreight veynes are ſpread then from the reſt. Yea, if the veynes drawe not at all, yet the humors voluntarily will flowe in the ſtraight courſe of the veynes: they that are in the right parts, followe the right members:

and they that are in the left partes follow the left members: and that courſe of humors is commended, which are carryed ſtraight wiſe; and that diſcommended when they are carried crookedly and ouerthwart, as declaring nature to bee violated and corrupted. The names of Phiſicall contraries in this practiſe are theſe: before, behinde, the right, the left, vpward, downewarde, within, without. Neither are theſe contraries in revulſion of humors, except they bee ſo placed in a ſtraight courſe of veines. For the left ſide is not contrary to a left Plureſie, or the left leg, from the knee downewarde, called in Latine Crus, contrary to the right leg inflamed. For herein this is a common and direct ſociety of veines, whereby the left leg beeing opened, draweth from the right: But from the right ſide to the left no veyne commeth with ſtraight and right ſtrings: Therefore a veyne opened in the ſame remoueth not a Plureſie on the right ſide: But either leaueth the hurtfull humor in the inflamed part, or mingleth it with the pure bloud, or bringeth a Plureſie in the left ſide: which often falleth out ſo.
               For as much therefore as all our indeuours and deuiſes muſt tende, by opening of a veyne, to exhauſt bloud abundantly and ſpeedely from the inflamed part:

take ſuch a veine as is ſtraitly ſcituated to the affected part. So in reaſon we ſhall followe nature, and imitate Hippocrates, who in a Plureſie willed to take the inner veine of the Arme on that ſide which is grieued. Neither onely doth the Phiſition open the inner veine of the right arme in a plureſie on the right ſide, but alſo in inflammation of the liuer: and yet all the veins are ioyned to the liuer in felowſhip. If that appeare not, we may take Mediana: If that neither appeare, we goe to 
                     Ʋena humeralis, rather than to the inner veine of the left arme; attributing ſo much to thoſe veynes which are directly and ſtraightly ſcytuated. Therefore Revulſion in a ſtreight courſe bringeth euident and ſpeedy helpe, whereas in a crooked or ouerthwart locution it bringeth none at all.
               Moreouer, a large veyne opened, withdraweth bloud plentifully and ſpeedely from the next places. Therefore when there is a great and vehement inflammation of ſome euill Humor, abundantly concurring in ſome principall member, and part of great ſenſe and feeling: a large veine muſt be opened in ſome neere place vnto it: which may abundantly and ſpeedely euacuate from the place affected. If the infirmity be but ſmall, a leſſer veyne may be choſen, and in a place further diſtant, to euacuate a leſſe quantity, and

at more leyſure. Revulſion in this ſort, not onely ſtayeth the Fluxe, but alſo exhauſteth firſt from the affected member the rotten and ill bloud, before it deale with the good bloud of the other parts and members of the body, and then all feare is remooued of any newe Fluxe to inſue. For when the part affect ed ſhall bee disburdened more than the other, through great euacuation lately made, very hardly in reaſon, can the ſame be grieued with another Fluxe of humors, except we go on with a freſh intemperate order of liuing. And againe, the members far diſtant (couetous as it were) becauſe of their great want: wil not ſuffer the bloud in them contained, to flow to the others. Neither will the member affected (except there remaine in the ſame great dolor and heate) allure or ſucke any thing from them, being now but weake and conſequently not requiring great nouriſhment.
               The opinion therefore of the Arabians concerning opening of a veyne muſt needes be falſe: VVho ſuppoſe that in a Plureſie a veyne opened on the ſame ſide doth increaſe the force of the Fluxe. Affirming alſo that for the plenitude (if it be much) leſt the Flux ſhould increaſe, the ſame is to bee taken from the lower veyne of the foote. After this that the Revulſion muſt bee made from the

inner veyne of the contrary arme. Laſt of all, that the reliques and remainder is to bee euacuated out of the ſame ſide. VVhat diſcretion I pray you is this? ſo oft to vexe the ſicke Patient, whom wee may cure at one time: For bloud abundantly taken out of the ſide affected, draweth plenty as it were at the well head, freeing that part from inflammation without ſuſpition 
                     •
                   orfeare of any newe Fluxe. Euacuation made from the ouerthwart veynes, onely abateth ſuperfluity of bloud and humors, with ſmall quantity of the corrupt bloud, and leſſe eaſe to the pained part: Or els the corrupted bloud remooued from the affected member, is mingled in the veyns with the good bloud, and ſo the euill that was to be remedied, is made worſe. VVhen a veyne is opened in a right and ſtraight courſe (e directo as they call it) it both euacuateth, pulleth the humor backe, and turneth it aſide. And as a ſlowe and continuall running, doth moſt ſafely pull backe from the furtheſt partes, and remooue a fluxe that might poſſibly inſue: So alſo the bloud being turned into a long tract, as it were of a new way, by litle and litle with Revulſion: it turneth from the old courſe, without offending the naturall powers any thing at all.
               Now that this Reuulſion, or calling backe of flowing humors to the contrary part: may

be practiſed with the greater profit; I am to giue here aduertiſement, that foure conditions are therein to bee reſpected, as Auicen ſetteth downe in quarta primi cap. 1. Firſt we are to conſider the diuerſity of the member, and ſtill to draw to the contrary part, as from the right part to the left, from the lower member to the hyer, from before to behinde, &amp;c.
               This conſideration to bee very needfull, Hyppocrates prooueth by experience: For 5. Aphoriſ. Apho. 68. hee writeth that paine in the binder part of the head, is cured by opening a veyne in the forehead: which Hyppocrates practiſed to auert the matter as Galen noteth in the Commentary. This auerſion or turning to the contrary is done either according to longitude, that is, aboue and belowe: or latitude, that is, from the right to the left, or according to the altitude, that is, before and behind.
               The ſecond condition is to haue a care of the fellowſhip and community of the veyns▪ therefore in abundant fluxe of termes, wee pull backe, applying the Cupping-glaſſes to the Paps. VVhich Hyppocrates moſt learnedly witneſſeth 5. Aphoriſ. Aphor. 50. For there is a kind of Affinite betweene the veynes of the wombe and the veynes of the Paps.
               
                  
Thirdly, care muſt be had of the rightnes and ſtraightnes of the veynes, which care being had great profit inſueth.
               The fourth condition is, to obſerue the farnes of the diſtance. But of theſe, two conditions eſpecially are to be obſerued. That is to ſay, the fellowſhip of the veynes, with their rectitude or rightnes: And therefore Hyppocrates counſelleth to open the inner veyne of the ſame ſide or arme, and not of the contrary arme. VVhich alſo Galen affirmeth, li. de cura. ratio. ſanguinis miſſione ca. 16. whatſoeuer Auicen would otherwiſe, in tertia primi. Therefore they are to be blamed that in a Plureſie of the right ſide, open a veyne in the left▪ as Galen teacheth, lib. artis medic. cap. 95.
               
               There are three waies of auerſiō or turning away and a ſide of humors called Deriuatio. One by repelling things that beat backe the matter, another by thinges reuelling, which pull the matter cleane away, and draw it forth to the contrary part. And the third way is, by thinges tranſmiſſiue, which ſende the matter from one member to another. So Diuerſio, or Deriuatio is as it were genus to Revulſion. If therefore (as yee haue heard) there be great inflammation, or a ſodaine and haſty Fluxe of humors; open a great veyne of the ſame ſide might, e d
                        •
                     recto, as theſe rermeit. I ſay, a

great or large veyne becauſe if the euacuation be in the greater veſſels, it is done with the more ſpeede: As Galen ſaith, libri primi arti
                        •
                      medic. cap. 95. And it is ſaide rightly in the ſame ſide, for this is the counſaile of Galen, lib. 13. Metho. cap. 11. But if the Fluxe of humors be ſlowe, &amp; not haſty as in the other, or that a veyne muſt be opened for preſeruation onely: A veyne further off may bee taken according to the iudgement and diſcretion of the Phiſition, as ye haue partly heard before.
               But foraſmuch as the Liuer is the Fountaine and originall of all the veynes, and Phlebotomy cuacuateth bloud, it ſeemeth that bloud ſhould neuer be abated, either for Euacuation or Revulſion, vnleſſe the veyne of the right arme bee taken, which chiefly doth euacuate and pull backe from the fountaine, that is, the Liuer. VVhich alſo may be prooued by that notable man Hyppocrates his authority, affirming our whole body to be Conſpirabile: That is, of one agreement, and of a common and generall accorde together, one member with another, and Confluxibile, that is, alwaies running together, and ſo allied, that each part thereof ſuffereth with the other.
               This beeing ſo, it ſeemeth that rectitude is not at all to be regarded in Revulſion. For

what veyne ſoeuer wee open becauſe of the conſent of the whole body with the parts the like profit will inſue.
               For the Solution hereof we make anſwere: that as it is now ſaid, it would follow in effect. But that nature a prouident dame hath ſo placed the midriffe, as it diuideth the ſtomacke from the lower bowels, and hath ſeparated the right parts from the left: Leſt one part being hurt, the other part ſhould alſo ſodainely periſh. And this is the cauſe that therefore rather the right with right, than with the left; and the left with the left, rather than the right, doo accord together, and mutually ſuffer one with the other. And therefore alſo Hyppacrates ſaid well. Sanguinis reuulſionem ſecundum rectitudinem (cat a Ixin) fieri debere. That Revultion of bloud muſt bee done according vnto rectitude. If therefore a veyne be thus opened wee ſhall ſoone ſee the apparant vtility, if wee doo otherwiſe or the contrary, it profiteth nothing.
               This is ſeene euen by naturall eruptions of bloud: For if in ſwelling of the Spleene, nature expell bloud out of the right Noſthrill, or in ſwelling of the Liuer from the left Noſthrill, no helpe inſueth. But if the bleeding bee according to rectitude called in Greeke Cata Ixin, as ſpeniticke perſons, out of the

left Noſthrill: and in diſeaſes of the Liuer out of the right euident profit will appeare. The contrary profiteth not, but oft hurteth diminiſhing the ſtrength of the body without helpe to the diſeaſe, as ſaith Galen de curand. rati. per ſang. miſſio. cap. 15. VVherefore as it were following nature, in that which ſhee doth well, and thoſe thinges which come voluntarily, and of themſelues, and are yet good and profitable to ſtoppe bleeding at the noſe from the left Noſthrill, wee apply cuppingglaſſes to the left Hypocondrium: which is the compaſſe of the ſide neere the breaſt and Paps, and if from the right Noſthril, to the right Hypocondrium. The rectitude therefore as an eſpeciall matter is to bee obſerued in Revulſion: yea, and more account is to bee made thereof, than of the differences of the members, neither are the parts of the body to bee iudged contrary each to other, except one bee oppoſite to the other according to rectitude.
               
                  An Obiection.
                  It ſeemeth that Galen reſpected not the location of grieued members, according to this rectitude, lib. 13. Method. cap. 5. VVhereas the hand being ill affected, he ſcarrified Crura the thighs, and one of the thighs ill affected he ſcarrified the other thigh that was well.
               
               
                  
                  The Solution.
                  
                     Galen in his practiſe obſerued rectitude of members. For there is a common and direct ſocietie of the veines, ſo that the opening of the left thigh: which draweth bloud from the right, for both the thighes receiue bloud from the hollowe veyne called 
                        Ʋena caua.
                  
                  
                     Auicen in 4. primi. 1. deliuereth two rules not to be neglected in Revulſions. Firſt that if in the member, from which wee will pull backe, there bee great paine: the paine muſt be aſſwaged, before we make Revulſion. Otherwiſe, the dolour greatly attracting, and wee alſo drawing backe with Revulſion, the humors to ſome other part, there would bee too great a contention, and an exceſſiue moouing of the matter: whereby the body might receiue much hurt.
                  His ſecond rule is, that when wee pull backe, the paſſage muſt not bee thwart any principall member. If any ambiguity ariſe concerning this rule, becauſe Hyppocrates is ſaide before, in ach of the hinder part of the head, to open a veyne in the forepart: we anſwere, that the ſame paſſage was not made vpon a principall member, to wit, the braine. VVe alſo affirme that the paſſage may be by a veyn of a principall member, though not by

the ſubſtance of the ſaid member: for the fluxe doth not abide, or reſt in the braine, as in termino, in his bound or limit. Therefore I coun
                        •
                     eil ag ine and againe, becauſe manie are killed through the vnskilfulnes of practiſioners in this point: at ſome of whoſe deaths I haue my ſeife beene preſent. In a pleuriſie of the right ſide, open a veine in the right arme: otherwiſe, the hart being ſituate in the middle, betweene the right ſide and the left: the paſſage ſhould be vpon a principall member, namely the heart. And hitherto chiefeiy of Revulſion.
                  
                     Parocheteuſis in Greeke: Deriuatio in Latine: in Engliſh, Deriuation, or pulling aſide; is defined, a drawing of the flowing humor to the next part. It is done by opening that vaine which is found in the verie member affected; and whereby alſo ſometime that member receiued nouriſhment. But now the ill iuce flowing, and that veine opened, the grieued part is preſently disburthened.
                  This practiſe is profitably vſed after reuulſion: In the beginning of inflammation, when the matter is now in fluxiō &amp; mouing, bloud is to be withdrawen from ſome farre diſtant place, according to rectitude: after that, euacuation muſt be made from the affected part, when the matter is come thither▪ and there ſettleth and abideth: then detract

bloud, either from the affected part, or verie neere vnto it, and this is called Parocheteuſis, deriuatio. VVee make deriuation from the member affected, when the ſame is not any noble or principall member: and this is done two wayes: either manifeſtly and ſenſibly by ſcarification or boxing: or immanifeſtly by euaporation, as Galen ſheweth, lib. Artis Med. cap. 95. But that deduction which is made to the next partes, is moſt properly called Deriuation. Thus to ſtaye bloud at the mouth, wee bring it to the neere partes, and prouoke bleeding at the noſe. So in weomen in fluxes of Hemorroids, wee ſtay them in prouoking Menstrua. i. their naturall Termes. Thus in inflammations of the mouth, wee bring them to the noſe. So in angina, opening the veines in the handes, and the veines vnder the toung, wee make deriuation to the next place. So in affectes of the guttes, we do not prouoke to ſtole, but draw it to the next partes: prouoking either vrine or ſwet. So in diſeaſes of the raines, wee prouoke not vrine, but drawing the matter to the next members, namely the bowels, wee prouoke to ſtoole.
                  But heere a
                        •
                     yſeth a doubt: howe the raines can be purged by ſiege, ſeeing there is no ſenſible waye or paſſage knowen, from

the raines thither.
                  To aunſwere this, wee haue but authorities, as namely of Galen and Hippocra. Galen affirming in his ſeuenth booke de Method. Chap. 13. that the raines, bladder, and bounch of the Liuer called Gibba Ierinoris are purged by ſiege. And experience ſheweth, that when the bellie is ſolluble and laxatiue; the vrine is the leſſe. Hippo. ſaying in like manner 4. Aphoriſm. Aphoriſmo vltimo: That much v
                        •
                     ine made by night, ſheweth little ſiege.
                  You haue heard before, that deriuaſion is vſed after revulſion, when the force of the fluxe is ſtayed, when the heat of the inflammation is layde, when there is no feare or ſuſpicion of any other inflammation likely to enſue: and alſo when the humor is yet moyſt and liquide in the member, from whence it may returne. But if you ſuppoſe the humor to be ſtuffed in the member, and is not able to returne: which often times falleth out in continuall olde inflammations, in which harde apoſtumated reliques remaine. In this caſe, when yee open the veine, vſe no deriuation but fomentation or bathinges, and emplaſters to digeſt and molleſie. Wherewith, if the humor cannot be diſſolued, the member not

being principall; neither any great pain there felt: the affected place may be launced, and the humor brought foorth: ſpecially, if the ſame be contagious, that it infect and hurt the members adiacent: which practiſe, thogh properly it cannot be called deriuation, yet it may ſtand in ſteede thereof.
               
            
            
               Whether purgation by ſiege or inward medicine receiued, cannot, or may not, euacuate the bloud. And thereaſons anſwered that are brought for proofe thereof. Chap. 7.
               IT ſeemeth, that an inward receit ſufficiently euacuating bloud by ſiege, may be both found, and vſed by Iſaacus: who in 1. vi
                     
                        •
                     tici, in the Chapter of Cephalaea paſsio, affirmeth: Quae proſunt Cholerae, proſunt &amp; ſangaini: Thoſe things that are good for choler, are good for bloud. But it is knowen that we haue euacuating receits for choler: therefore by the foreſaid authoritie, the ſame are alſo good and profitable to euacuate bloud. Secondly, there are receites to euacuate other humors, as choler, flewme, and Melancoly: therefore alſo there are to euacuate bloud, which is the principall humor.
               Thirdly, Auicen in 2. affirmeth: Pulpam evacuare ſanguinem; that the pulpe of Coloquintidae euacuateth the bloud. Fourthly,

                  Haly ſupra tegni, affirmeth, that Galen cauſed one to be hanged that gaue a receit to euacuate bloud: therefore there was ſuch a receit then, and may be now. The contrarie to theſe obiections is ſet downe by Galon, that no receit euacuateth the bloud or humor i
                     •
                   the veines, but Phlebotomy onely.
               A ſecond queſtion here may be moued, whether if there be ſuch a receit found, the ſame may be adminiſtred or not? It ſeemeth that it may, becauſe when other humors offend, we euacuate them by medicine: therefore it ſeemeth, wee may ſo do, when bloud offendeth. The contrarie to this is ſet downe by Haly aforeſaid, and warranted by Galens authoritie, who cauſed one to be hanged for ſo doing.
               For ſolution hereof, we are to vnderſtand, that although a medicine euacuating bloud may be found out, yet the ſame may not be vſed. The reaſon is: for that ſuch a medicine ſpecially or rather altogether reſpecting the bloud, would neither euacuate nor attract bloud, as the other humors are euacuated with their owne proper and peculiar receits▪ Yea, if it happen that it do euacuate bloud, as Pulpa Colocynthidis doth, according to Auicen: without doubt, it euacuateth tha
                     •
                   bloud which ſhould be ſtill retained for the good health of mans bodie. Serapio ſayeth,

that the impropriate or improper humor of a receit, is ſooner thereby euacuated then the proper humor: whereof he rendreth a reaſon, namely, that the proper humor to a rec
                     •
                  it, is the beſt beloued to the receit. Wherby (ſaith he) it commeth to paſſe, that the improper humor is ſooner for ſaken of nature, than the proper. The humor improper is quickly drawen to the receit, and therby ſooner expelled: whereas the humor called proper (which the medicine moſt properly reſpecteth) is, as it were, the moſt beloued friend, and as it were, the moſt natural childe to the euacuating receit, and therefore is ſtil rather reteined than expelled. By this reaſon o
                     •
                   
                  Serapio, foraſmuch as bloud is natures darling, &amp; more helping than the other humors, which are but ſuperfluities in reſpect of the bloud. If there were a receit euacuating &amp; reſpecting bloud, &amp; that the ſame were adminiſtred the other humors would be attracted &amp; cuacuated before the bloud, and ſo great hurt enſue to the bodie. And if it were ſo that onely bloud offended (which is not perhaps altogether true) yet neither ſhould the blo
                     •
                   alone be euacuated, as now it hath bin declared. Againe, according to the Philoſopher 4. de Animalibus, we are to make choice of the right way, and not to ſeeke crooked wayes. Now opening a veine is the righter &amp; ſafer

way to euacuate bloud, than medicine: for Phlebotomy euacuateth all humors at once, &amp; principally the bloud which moſt of all aboundeth in the veines: and this thing, medicine cannot do. Againe, euacuation is done for two cauſes: either for to remooue the aboundance of the humor, or to take away the corrupted qualitie of the homor. So euacuation of bloud is practiſed, either becauſe it aboundeth in quantitie, or offendeth in qualitie. If we open a veine becauſe bloud aboundeth in quantitie: then in like ſort there is alſo abundance of other humors. For abundāceof bloud cometh through good nutriment, cauſing bonū Chymū. i. good 
                     •
                  uce proceeding of meat digeſted: which doth not only bring repletion of bloud, but alſo of other humors as helpers vnto bloud. Therefore when bloud thus aboundeth in quantitie with other humors, it is better to euacuat them by Phlebotomie than by receit. If euacuatiō of bloud be made for that it corrupteth in the veines, then by reaſō it corrupteth the other humors alſo▪ ſeeing bloud is more abounding in quantitie than are the other humors: wherupon Galen ſaith, that in the feuer Sinocha, there is corruption of all the humors, &amp; in all the veines, &amp; therefore bloud is neuer to be euacuated without the other humors together. Now other humors may ſuperfluouſly abound &amp; be

corrupted in qualitie, without the bloud, and ſo conſequently may be euacuated without bloud by inward medicine: ſo that it is naturall for the other humors in this ſort to be euacuated, and vnnaturall ſo to euacuate bloud: which was the cauſe that Haly vpon Galens authoritie affirmed, that Galen cauſed one to be hanged, which euacuated bloud by inward receit.
               To the former obiections therefore wee anſwere thus: Iſaac his ſaying; Quod prodest Choleri prodest ſanguini, is to bee vnderſtood not of euacuating medicines, but of altering receits, as thus: thoſe things that are profitable to alter choler, and to extinguiſh the amitie thereof, they worke the ſame effect in alteration of the bloud. Or wee may vnderſtand it of euacuation, and expound it thus: Thoſe things which are profitable to euacuate choler, are profitable to mundefie the bloud; becauſe, by euacuation of choler, bloud is mundefied and cleanſed.
               To the ſecond we anſwere, that this argument (Bloud is naught and offendeth as do other humors, therefore it is good to euacuate the ſame by medicine, as other homors offending are euacuated) this is a fallax of the conſequent, or rather figurae dictionis: for it followeth not, that if bloud offend it muſt be euacuated by inward medicine; becauſe

the ſame may better and more ſafely be done otherwiſe; namely by Phlebotomie: and this may ſerue for aunſwere to the ſecond doubt before moued in like manner.
               To the third may be ſaid, that Pulpa being forcible, it greatly debilitateth the member: and therefore, when bloud is ſuperfluous, it looſeth and euacuateth the ſame, and letteth the bloud conteined in the member, to paſſe away; but it doth not attract the bloud: and this is verie pernitious to the bodie of man.
               The anſwere to the fourth, is plaine in the premiſſes. VVhere note, that although it haue bin declared in this Chapter, that bloud is not to be euacuated by ſiege, as other humors are: which fluxe of bloud that way, we rather account a diſeaſe, than a remedie: as in Dyſenteria &amp; ſuch like: yet this notwithſtanding we do not denie, but medicines may be verie profitably giuen, and receiued to mundifie &amp; to purge the bloud.
            
            
               Of the impediments or lets of Phlebotomy, and of the cauſes requiring and furthering the ſame. Chap. 8.
               THere are certeine things which put off bleeding for a while, and other things which altogether hinder &amp; forbid this practiſe: whereof, the firſt is indigeſtion of the

meat receiued: as when a man hath eaten much ouer-night, and in the morning feeleth himſelfe pained therby: feeling ſtill, as it were the ſent &amp; ſauour of the meat which he hath eaten remaining ſtill in his ſtomack, whereby the cruditie plainly appeareth. In this caſe, (except vrgent neceſsitie otherwiſe require) wee muſt forbeare bleeding til the digeſtion be accompliſhed; that is, til the rawe humors be concoct, &amp; alſo the excrements deſcended. The reaſon why cruditie and rawnes of humors through too much ingorging of meat ſtayeth bleeding for the time; may be gathered out of Auicen. 1. Doctri. 6. cap. 3. for that there are three things which attract matter vnto them: that is emptines of the place, heat of the members, the habit and ſtate of the whole bodie. If therefore (the bodie thus affected) wee chaunce to open a veine, the bloud vntimely woulde be drawen by the veines: firſt, part of this cruditie of humors: and the veines being deſtitute of their proper and conuenient nouriſhment, would drawe vnto them that which is not as yet concocted in the ſtomack &amp; Liuer: which vnconcocted matter ſent abroad to the oth
                     •
                  r members of the bodie, would not eaſely be amended. For (as Galen ſaith) the third dgeſtion doth not remedie the faults of the ſecond: nor the ſecond▪ the curls of the firſt: Si
                  
                  magnum ſit peccatum (as he ſaith) if the euill be great. So that now, if by this meanes the matter be turned into the members; there muſt, in the meane ſeaſon, of neceſsitie be abundance of excrementes remaining in the bodie, as the occaſion of ſickneſſes: and ſo at length ſickneſſes may enſue. Yea, it is far better (as it ſeemeth to Galen, lib. de Curand. ratio per ſanguinis miſsionem cap. 6. altogether to abſteine from bleeding in vntemperat drinkers &amp; gluttonous perſons: as from ſuch as cannot be cured either by purging or bleeding. For by their vntemperat life, they gather in ſhort time againe, great abundance of rawe &amp; vnconcocted humors. VVith ſuch it is not beſt to deale: for to what purpoſe is it, to haue the excellent vſe of this practiſe, by theſe mens intemperancie defaced among the common people, which hath been ſo preſent a helpe to diuers? See Galen. lib. 11: cap. 9. Method. Meden.
               
               The ſeconde matter, putting off this practiſe for a time, are the excrementes of the bellie. Therefore, firſt exonerate the wombe before bleeding, if it bee not ſoluble of it ſelfe, with a Cliſter of decoction of Mallowes, putting thereto Oyle and Salte, or with a Suppoſitorie, or with eating a little Caſsia fistula.
               
               The thirde impediment, is ſome other

voluntarie euacuation, that may be at that preſent time: as in fluxe of Termes in weomen, and in fluxe of the Hemorroids: whereunto Gaelen likewiſe conſenteth, lib. 9. Cap. 5. Method. Meden. in theſe words: If (ſaith he) in time of bleeding, it happen, that the Termes do flowe; or that the veine called Haemorrhois be open, if the force of the ſame fluxe ſeeme ſufficient, ſo that it alone may euacuate that which thou requireſt: thou ſhalt leaue the matter wholly to nature: if not, then thou maiſt detract ſo much bloud, till by both wayes, that be brought to paſſe, which thou wouldeſt haue done. But this is not alwayes to be followed: for in euacuation to turne away the matter, as in immoderate fluxe of Termes, or in the fluxe of the Hemorroides wee practiſe bleeding, as was afore ſhewed in the Chapter of Reuulſion.
               Againe, concerning theſe voluntarie eruptions of bloud, when wee intend to open a veine, if the eruption haue been much, then ſtay from further euacuation. But if it little or nothing haue withdrawen the matter of the diſeaſe, it debarreth vs not of further bleeding. Therefore, if the diſeaſe and preſent neceſsitie require it, &amp; that the powers of nature haue not beene damnified by that voluntarie eruption, wee may ſpeedily open a veine, as in a ſtrong pluriſie. If there

haue been much ſweating, vomiting or great ſieges, we are not to let bloud: but if theſe ſlake, and that the naturall powers are a little in time recreated, then wee may verie ſafely bleede. For thoſe being but accidents, &amp; not remouing the cauſe of the diſeaſe, can not ſerue in ſteed of bleeding. So in a hote agew, if the wombe be laxatiue, and that there happpen Lienteria (which is a fluxe of the ſtomacke, when the meate and drinke runneth from a man, as he tooke it, vtterly without concoction or alteration, riſing of great weakenes of the ſtomacke, ſpecially in the power retentiue, which is not able to keepe the meate till nature in ful time may concoct it, through immoderate drinking of colde water: from which, ſome cannot refraine in hote feuers: This (I ſay) doth not hinder bleeding, but becauſe thereby natures ſtrength is enfeebled, the ſame conſidered, the bleeding muſt be the leſſe, if voluntarie eruption of bloud remoue the matter of the diſeaſe, or in ſome reaſon bring eaſe to the patient; according to diſcretion, commit the matter to nature alone. If not, take away ſome bloud, that through natures worke and the Phiſitions practiſe togither, the cure may be accompliſhed. Thoſe things which nature of her ſelfe can finiſh, meddle not withall; but helpe her with Art, in that which ſhee beginneth,

and cannot of her ſelfe make an end: therfore I ſaid, in a Pluriſie, in a continual feuer, if bloud abundantly flow frō the bellie, hemorroids, or noſe: ſo that the quantie of the euacuation be iuſt, and the patient thereby eaſed, let no further bloud. If bloud come but ſmally from the foreſaide, and that the ſickneſſe ſtill continue vehement: that which wanteth is to be done by opening a veine: yea, although the patient be a woman in child-bed: yea, &amp; therefore ſometime in a bloudie fluxe, a purgation is giuen, that the ſame which commeth foorth but ſoftly and ſlowly, by reſon of the vnprepared paſſages; may flowe more abundantly by a more conuenient courſe.
               The fourth impediment, is the age of the partie that is to bleed, either being too old or too yong. Old folk are not to be let bloud, becauſe there is in them little good bloud, and much ill bloud: bleeding from them taketh away the good, and leaueth the bad behinde. Olde men after 70 yeares are not to be let bloud, except they be of a ſtrong conſtitutiō of body, &amp; that the vehemency of the diſeaſe require the ſame. But if in theſe yeres, the powers of the bodie be weake, &amp; that bloud aboundeth not: bleeding is not to be in them practiſed: for as Galen ſaith, in men of theſe yeres, there is little good bloud; but of rawe

humors great plentie: ſo that opening of a veine, ſendeth forth the good; but the ill blod gathered together in the chiefe veines, in the Liuer, &amp; that part called Meſenterion, which is the double skin that faſteneth the bowels to the backe: or rather, the branches of the veine called Porta, which conuey the iuce of the meat concocted from the ſtomake to the Liuer, it draweth forth into the whole bodie. Conſider therfore, the ſtrength of the body, the vehemencie of the diſeaſe: for not onely the number of yeres, but the conſtitutiō alſo of the body is to be marked. There are of 60 yeres that are not to bleed, being weake old men. The age fit for bleeding is at as florens, that is: after ſome, the 17 yeare of age: after ſome 9. after ſome 10. after others 14. or 13.
               
               Before the 13 yeare, after the moſt approued writers of our time, wee are not to let bloud, except thoſe youthes haue broad veines: be of ſanguine complexion, and that the diſeaſe be dangerous &amp; require this practiſe neceſſarily. In theſe caſes wee may open a veine, if the veines well appeare: or we may diminiſh bloud, by ſcarifying the legges or armes. Schola Salerni ſayeth: Denus ſeptenus vix Phlebotomon petit annus.
               
               
                  The ſeuenteenth yere of age ſcarce good:
                  To put in proofe letting of blood.
               
               
                  
Children then before they come to 13. or 14. yeares, are not to bleede, except ſome great dangerous diſeaſe of neceſsitie require it at nine or tenne yeares: the reaſon is, becauſe their fleſh and skinne is yet but tender, and eaſie to breath thorow, as Galen witneſſeth lib. 9. cap. 17. Method. Medendi, in theſe words: Puerorū ſubstantia omniūfacile digeritur ac diſsipatur, propterea quod eſt omnium humidiſsima, eſt omnium minime frigida. The ſubſtance or fleſh of children, is moſt eaſie of all reſolued or ſeparated, becauſe it is moſt moyſt, and leſſe cold than other fleſhie ſubſtances. It needeth therefore no euacuation, hauing naturally of itſelfe, how to be purged, calore extraneo by a forrein, outward and ſtrange kinde of heate. And againe Galen ſayeth, lib, 11. of the ſame worke Cap. 14 ſpeaking of Synochus a kinde of feuer: Si in puerum incidat, qui 14. annum non hactenus attigit, mitti illi ſanguis non debet, propterea quod tantillis, cum praeſertim calidi ac humidi ſint, plurimum corporis ſubstantiae quotidie defluat ac digeratur: it a quod ex incidenda vena, moliendum nobis fuerat, id vltro nobis ex curati corporis natura praestatur. i. If this feuer happen to a childe yet not 14 yeares of age; he is not to be let bloud, becauſe ſuch yong ones, being of a hote and moyſt conſtitution, haue much of their bodily ſubſtance daily diſſolued.

So that the ſame which we goe about to bring to paſſe by opening a veyne, is done already to our hands by the conſtitution of the Patient. Of this imp e diment, namely, the age, beſide old men and boyes, are alſo meant decrepits, and very Infants. Auicen remembreth in quarta primi, cap. 20. this matter writing almoſt in this manner: Thou oughteſt to beware of opening a veyne in a complexion too colde, in a Country too colde, in time of extreme paine in a member, after reſolutiue bathinges, after carnall copulation, in young age vnder fourteene, and in olde age, except thou haue great confidence in the ſolidity of the Muſcles, in the largenes and fulnes of the veynes, and rednes of the colour: ſuch either young or olde, boldly may be let bloud. Yet thoſe that are young of fourteene yeare olde, muſt bleede orderly by little and little at once, and at each time more than before: and all this did Auicen take out of Galen. So that although in Phlebotomy wee are chiefly to conſider theſe three thinges, that is to ſay, the danger of the diſeaſe, the age and naturall ſtrength of the party: yet the age is ſometime not wayed when the ſtrength of nature ſerueth, either in old or yong. Wherfore Galen lib. de curand. ratione per ſanguinis miſſionem cap. 13. willeth to let bloud young ſanguine children, and olde ſanguine men,

without conſideration of age, if the diſeaſe be vehement and dangerous, if the body bee ſufficiently ſtrong, and that there alſo bee vehemency of the Pulſies. In theſe caſes Neceſſitas non habet legem; Necesſity hath no Lawe. So in Spaine they let children bloud of three yeares olde and leſſe, and Auenzoar writeth, that hee let his ſonne bloud at three yeares of age, and ſo preſerued him from death, lib. ſepti. cap. tertio Collecta. Theſe limits of yeares in this point Hyppocrates did not ſet downe. Galen appointed them from fourteene, to ſeauentie.
               Mooued by the foreſaide reaſons; Rhaſes, in olde decrepite age, nothing at all fearing the danger of exhauſting the naturall heate, that remaineth in the body with the bloud, (whereof notwithſtanding often proceedeth the hazarde of life by vndiſcrete bleeding) by opening a veyne in decrepite perſons, did then helpe, and did great good in grieuous Plureſies and Perypleumonias. And concerning young folke, this wee find true by experience, that in the fifth or ſixth yeares of their age, by opening a veyne, Plureſies, inward inflammations, and other grieuous diſeaſes are cured.
               Yea, wee ſee by the very courſe of Nature, that Children and ſucking Infantes, oft plentifully bleede at the noſe without any

hurt of body, or any diminiſhing of their naturall ſtrength.
               The age of Childhood hath naturally her ſtrength and bodely forces, why therefore may we not euacuate bloud: according to the proportion of the ſame? Eſpecially, when the childe is plentifully fedde, hauing alſo large veynes, and is filled with good concocted bloud. Againe, if it bee graunted that the forces of nature are impaired by bleeding: whether is it better for the childe to peri
                     •
                  h through plenitude and abundance of humors? or to free him of his diſeaſe by abating that abundance, though the ſtrength of nature be thereby a litle hindered: Therefore ſomtime the necesſity of bleeding is great, euen in childred; as in Plureſies, inward inflammations, and continuall feuers. There is therefore no age in my poore iudgement, but may abide ſome meaſure of Euacuation by bleeding if the child bee paſt fourteene yeares of age: Yet conſideration is to be had of what conſtitution hee is, whether his bodely ſubſtance be fat or leane, thicke or thin, groſſe or ſlender, hard or ſoft, of much bloud or of litle: In the firſt we may proceed to open a veyne▪ in the other not: and here we moſt carefully remember, that in children becauſe of their hot &amp; moiſt temperature, leſſe bloud muſt be taken, than the plenitude ſeemeth to require.
               
                  
The fift impediment is an ill diſpoſition of the ſtomack incident to ſome men, more than other ſome, in whom chollerick humors flow to the mouth of their ſtomacks, and maketh them apt to chollericke vomits, although before they haue neither accuſtomed, nor had any deſire to vomit. In theſemen, bleeding is to bee forborne, becauſe thereby the troubled humors flowe to the mouth of the ſtomacke as to the accuſtomed place, and becauſe the ſtomacke cannot reſiſt ſo great a Flux of humors, being partly weake of it ſelf, and more weakened through their comming. Hereof diuers great diſcommodities growe to the body, yea this is the very cauſe, that ſome fall downe and faint in bleeding. For the chollericke humors flowing to the ſtomacke, bite and nip the ſame, and ſo per Simpathia through a certaine kind of compaſſion that is betweene the ſtomacke, the heart, and the braine: it cauſeth Syncope, that is, ſowning. VVherefore Galen lib. 12. Method. cap. 3. Durſt neither purge, nor let thoſe bloud, which haue the mouth of their ſtomacke very ſenſible, tender, weake and abounding with bitter choler: and which perſons alſo abounding with the ſame when they bleede, in the very beginning, long afore full euacuation bee made, oft fall downe and faint: by reaſon of the foreſaide choler, and crudity of

humors. And this is alſo the counſaile of Galen lib. de curand. ratio. per ſanguin. miſſio. cap. 1. and of Auicen in quarta primi cap. 20. Ye may perceiue the mouth of the ſtomacke to bee very ſenſible, (ſaith Auicen) when yee cannot ſwallowe downe ſharpe and bitter thinges without hurt. VVeakenes of the ſtomacke is knowen, by loſſe of Apetite to meate and drinke. Abundance of bitter choler is ſhewed, by bitternes of the mouth, by ſubuerſion of the ſtomacke long time connnuing, and by oft vomiting vp of choler. Theſe ſignes and tokens diſcried in any patitient, doo dehort from opening a veyne: Yea, this ill diſpoſition of the ſtomacke: bringeth not onely Sincope, but alſo ſometime preſent death. As Galen witneſſeth lib. 9. cap. 5. Meden. And Auicen in the former cited place.
               The ſixt, is weakenes of the natural forces▪ Of which there is a threefold condition, for they are either firme, or weake, or betwene both. The forces of nature being but weake they cannot indure Phlebotomy, ſo forcible an euacuation. As Galen 2. Aphoriſmo. Aphoriſm. encipienti. In quo morbo, &amp;c. &amp; 4. Simplicis medecinae witneſſeth. This is one of the principall conſiderations that are to bee regarded in opening a veyne, for either wee muſt dehort from it, if natures forces ſerue not, or incourage to proceede it, if they will ſerue vnto

it. For it ſtandeth with great reaſon, that bleeding muſt greatly infeeble, and put them in danger, that are already weake of nature. Yea it oft falleth out, that diuers being let bloud, carrying very weake bodies; can neuer again recouer their former and priſtinate ſtrength, as Galen lib. de curand. ratio per ſang. miſſio. ca. 6. &amp; li. 11. Method. meden. cap. 14. witneſſeth. If the body bee ſtrong, and that vrgent neceſſiity ſo require, wee may boldly let bloud. If neceſſity doo not vrge, bleede not at all, or very litle. If vpon great neceſſity in this caſe much bloud muſt bee taken, the body being feeble and not able to abide it, we are to euacuate now a litle and then a little. Yea, I giue heere againe aduiſe, eſpecially to regarde this conſideration. For many times when the age, diſeaſe, and time require this kind of euacuation, and the naturall ſtrength cannot brooke it, there inſueth Sincope, that is, ſowning: In the which caſe we muſt reiterate bleeding, as hath beene ſaid, or elſe ſtay it, putting the finger on the wound; which ſtay the Grecians vſed, and called Apphaſis.
               
               The ſeauenth ſtay or let is, the habite and conſtitution of the body, wherein wee are to regard the whitenes or blackenes, leannes or fatnes, thicknes or thinnes, of the bodies that are to bleede. Thinne, white, leane and ſoft bodies are not to bleede; becauſe many

ſuperfluities are reſolued from ſuch bodies, which being to them ſufficient, they need not any other euacuation. This doth Galen affirm lib. 9. Metho. Medend. fleſhy bodies, firme, and thicke, are ſubiect nothing ſo much to diſſipation of ſuperfluities, &amp; therefore may better abide bleeding: as for fatte and groſſe bodies, though they be alſo leſſe ſubiect to waſting &amp; disſipation of humors than other are; yet they hardly tollerat Phlebotomy, becauſe they haue but ſmall veynes, and they being emptied by bleeding, the fat of the body wringeth, and as it were preſſeth them down. So that it is gretly to bee feared, leſt by ſuch oppresſion, the heat of nature be quite extinguiſhed. In this point of the habit of the body, we are alſo to conſider, the capablenes of the veyns, which being great &amp; ſwollen, may better be opened than the narrow and ſmall litle veyns. Again, we are alſo here to regard, the naturall diſpoſition of the humors. For hot and thin humors are flowing and quickly diſperſed. Thicke and cold humors are not ſo: and becauſe groſſe &amp; thicke fat bodies, haue leſſer veynes, &amp; leſſer bloud than leane men, &amp; that in ſuch perſons, the very fat of their bodies oft preſſeth down the veyns: ſo ſuffocating and choking naturall heate: therfore wee ſee by experience, that oftentimes theſe corpulent fat men die a ſodaine death.
               
                  
VVherevpon alſo Hyppocrates, 2. Aphoriſ. Aphoriſ. 44. ſuppoſed that groſſe men die ſooner, and more ſodainly than leane perſons. This I my ſelfe obſerued, certaine yeares paſt, by the death of a Gentleman of good credite, in this ſhiere of Kent, one Maiſter Weldon Eſquiere, and ofthe Greencloth: VVho died very ſodainely beeing a very fat Gentleman at a pariſh called great Pecham.
               The eighth impediment is, the colde temperature of the Patient, or the coldnes of the complexion. For the bodily conſtitution beeing already colde, by bleeding, of force muſt be made more cold, VVhereby frigiditie ofthe body dayly increaſeth. And as Iſaac ſaith in 
                     Ʋrinis. Sanguis eſt fundamentum caloris naturalis, in quo calor naturalis confortatur. Bloud is the foundation of naturall heate, whereby naturall heate is ſtrengthened. Therefore Phlebotomy (euacuating bloud) diminiſheth the naturall heate, and conſequently bringeth a dangerous coldne
                     •
                   to the whole body. The foundation of inward warmth (namely bloud) being diminiſhed, inwarde heate decayeth, and the body ſtill by little and little waxeth more colde. And this is teſtefied by Galen, lib. de curanda ratio per ſanguin▪ miſſio. cap. 6. Yet when the ſicke is of a melancholy conſtitution, and is grieued with much Repletion, or that Melancholy

hath much bloud mixt with it: in this caſe hee may bleede. And againe, a hot and a moiſt conſtitution of body, hauing alſo the bodily ſubſtance conſiſting of found, whole, and maſſie members: which by reaſon of inwarde heate is daily much diſſolued; tollerateth not ſo plentifull euacuation, as other complexions. VVhere by the way yee are to note that in Phiſicke, that body which aboundeth with much humors in the veynes, is moſt properly called Corpus humidum, and may beſt of all away with euacuatiō by bleeding.
               The ninth is rawnes, ſlownes, and clammines of the humors: In which caſe wee are to forbeare bleeding. For otherwiſe crudity of humors will bee increaſed. After Galen 12. Method. Medend. cap. 2. And this is the cauſe, why in long continuing maladies bleeding is not vſed according to Auicen: for if it were, there woulde followe Crudity of Humors; Debility of Naturall vertue; Prolongation of the diſeaſe, with feare neuer to bee cured.
               And therefore againe, as the ſame Auicen ſaith further, in diſeaſes daily and continuall, called Morte Chronici; Purgation muſt goe before bleeding, and not bleeding firſt: although we are to vſe them both. VVhereof looke before. Chap. 4.
               
               
                  
Of crudity of humors there are two ſpeciall cauſes, the firſt is the exceſſiue multitude of humors in the body, choking the inwarde naturall heare, by reaſon of whoſe weakenes, and ſuffocation, nature not beeing able to ouercome thoſe humors, crudi

                  gh abundance of menſtruous bloud or of abundance of hemorroids. The reaſon is, for that although theſe humors abounde in the body: yet bleeding ſtayeth the fluxe of them both: of that that is of the menſtruous bloude, and alſo of the Hemorroids. This alſo Trallianus; affi

                  inde of dropſie, in theſe words. Omnium curatio a vacuatione incipiendaeſt,ſed Aſcitis quidem dicti, aut Timpaniae a ſolapurgatione, cus autem Araſarca nome

                     x ſanguine frigidonaſcitut. The cure of all dropſies muſt begin at eu cuation. But that kind of dropſie called Aſcitis or a Timpany, muſt beginne at purging onely. That dropſie (called Anaſarca) ſometime equireth opening of a veyne, as proceeding of colde bloud.
               This he faith not that this Anaſarca requireth

any further coldnes to be added, but becauſe the withdrawing of abundance of humors in this caſe, disburdeneth nature, and maketh her the more able to ouercome the ſame Repletion, being ſomewhat leſſened in quantity by bleeding. It is not therefore repugnant, but very agreeable to reaſon, in this caſe, to vſe Phlebotomy. For we ſee by daily experience, that a ſmall fire is put out by laying on too much wood at once, or ſuch wood as is greene, and that then it burneth when the woode is remooued which hindered the burning thereof. Euen ſo is inward heate of the bodie choaked with multitude of humors, and the ſame is againe refreſhed, when ſome portion of them is withdrawen.
               The ſecond cauſe of crudity of humors, is the debility of the inward naturall heate, which happeneth in men of colde Complexions, in men that haue beene long ſicke and in olde folke: in theſe bleeding is not vſed, becauſe bloud being taken away from them, which is the reſtorer and maintainer of the inwarde naturall heate (as yee heard before out of Iſaacus) conſequently the body muſt waxe colde, and crudity of humors increaſe. Bloud therfore muſt remain in theſe perſons, to concoct and ouercome the humors in the body.
               
                  
And therfore very well ſaith Auicen, Non quotieſcun

                  ies preſently to bee practiſed, whenſoeuer wee ſee ſignes of Repletion, as namely, when there is fulnes of raw humors in the body, and this doth Galen alſo affirme, lib. 12. Method. Medend.
               
               The tenth impediment is the vnfit diſpoſition of the Aire, when the ſame is too hot, too cold, too dry, or too moiſt. Alſo when the ſame is not cleare, but troubled. And therefore vnder the ſtarre called Canis, in the canicular or dogge d
                     •
                  ies, when thereis exceſſiue heate and drith, it is good to refraine bleeding: Except great necesſity doo vrge it. So likewiſe in ſeaſons too moiſt and too colde, as in the winter in a ſtate of the Aire temperately hot, as when the wind is ſouth, or ſoutheaſt, wee may bleede temperarately and ſparingly.
               In a more cold ſtate of the Aire, as when the North-winde bloweth, or North-weſt winde; wee muſt bleede more ſparingly than before. In a right temperate and mild ſtate of the heauens, we may bleed plentifully; eſpecially the Aire not beeing greatly diſquieted, with great force of tempeſtious weather.
               And here may be made a profitable collation in this practiſe: by folding vp together

as it were in one: three impediments here ſpecified. The ſtate of the Country being co
                     •
                  de, the time of the yere beeing cold, the preſent conſtitution of the Aire beeing colde. All which three are outward cauſes, and 
                     •
                  oyne in this third point: which is common to them all three: that is, the Country, the Aire, and ſeaſon of the yeare, compaſſe about euery Patient. Therefore in a cold Country and in winter, and when the Northwind bloweth; open no veyne. If in a colde Country and in winter the wind blow South, and that ſo necesſity require, wee may proceede with this practiſe; ſo in a hot Country, and in ſummer, the winde blowing at the South: bleede not, If necesſity in ſummer require bleeding, open a veyne when the North-wind tempereth the immoderate heate of the ſeaſon. For ſurely theſe outward cauſes, though obſcurely, and without any great perceiuing▪ yet they doo either keepe in, or diſperſe abroade and extenuate, the ſubſtance both of inward heat and alſo of the inwarde humors. And as in a temperature or complexion hot and moiſt, Phlebotomy is vſed beſt: and not to be vſed in complexions hot &amp; dry, or complexions cold and dry. So when the ſeaſon is hot and moiſt, as in the ſpring we may bleed ſafely. But not ſo, in a ſeaſon hot and dry, as is the ſummer, or very cold, as is the winter.
               
                  
The eleuenth let is ſome great inflammation, or extreme ach and paine, as appeareth by Galen and Auicen, who both forbid bleeding in hot inflamed feuers, and in apoſtumations of great paine. In theſe caſes the opening of a veyne doth cauſe much buſines, and agitation of humors in the body. Bleeding on the one ſide, drawing and emptying humors: the inflammation and ach on the other ſide, ſtriuing there againſt, and attracting humors thither. For all paine, if it be much and all heat, which concurreth with paine, attracteth and hindereth the fluxe of humors. VVhereby it commeth to paſſe, that by bleeding in this caſe, the inflammation is thereby increaſed, and nature more infeebled, and the ſame moſt chiefly when the bleeding hath beene temperate, and done according to Art. But in the foreſaid caſes: if the bloud be withdrawen in great quantity, euen till the Patient giue ouer and faint: it profiteth very much for, thereby the abundance of boyling bloud in g

                  eat inflammations is expelled, and the inflamed member is cooled: ſo that in vehement paines, opening a veyne is a preſent helpe: keeping backe the fluxe of bloud, which otherwiſe would haue recourſe to the pained place. And here it is not to be forgotten, that ſometime the expulſiue vertue, making haſt to expell the cauſe of the griefe,

And this is the intent and meaning of Galen, where he ſaith: In ardentiſſimis febribus, ſi vſque ad animi defectionem, ſanguis mittatur, ſtatim totius corporis habitus refrigeratur, &amp; febris extinguitur.

               The twelfth impediment is the extreame

coldnes of the Region, a Country which being cold cannot tollerate ſo large an Euacuatioṅ, as is this kind that wee nowe preſently handle. The reaſon is, for that the body being before ſufficiently cooled through the colde temperament of the place, muſt needes waxe more cold, when the naturall heate is drawen forth with the bloud. Moreouer a country too hot, cannot admit this practiſe, becauſe in ſuch a place extremity ofheate draw eth from the body much inward heat of nature, diſſoluing of it ſelfe, and diſperſing the naturall forces and humors of the body, and therefore in hot Countries, the naturall powers are leſſened: &amp; there is leſſe bloud in the veyns, which is the reaſon that alſo in extreame hot countries, the bleeding muſt be none at all, or very litle▪ A country ſomwhat colder and moiſter than this nowe ſpecified, keepeth in the humors and inward heate: diſſoluing very little thereof Therfore men in ſuch countries, may bleede more abundantly.

                  iō. And again, if the inward members ſhould be depriued of their natural &amp; inward heate; they were greatly in danger to periſh with extremity of outward cold. Look more of this before in the tenth impediment.
               
                  
The thirteenth hinderance, is the time or ſeaſon of the yeare, which is a matter alſo in letting bloud to be conſidered: as namely, whether it be too hote a ſeaſon, as in Sommer: or too colde a ſeaſon, as in VVinter: ſpecially when it is froſt and ſnowe. For to what purpoſe is it, when the bodie is alreadie ſufficiently cooled, through the colde ſeaſon of the yeare, to make it more colde by bleeding. And for hote ſeaſons, if the heat be extreme: thoſe that bleede in them, oftentimes die by ſowning or fainting called Sincope, or reſolutio: for extreme heat enuironing the patient, doth ouercome the vital ſpirites, which come foorth with the bloud; drying &amp; weakening the ſtate of the whole bodie. Therefore in ſeaſons extremely note, it is a point of wiſedome to forbeare bleeding: which thing Galen teacheth, lib. 11, c

Thou ſhalt not at all let bloud in Sommer time, in an hote countrey, and in an hote and drie ſtate of the aire: as vnder the dog-ſtarre, and from mid Iuly to mid September; or rather to mid Auguſt.

               The fifteenth, is a diſpoſition to vomit: of what cauſe ſo euer the ſame proceedeth. For in this cauſe of lothſomnes of ſtomack, if we let bloud, the veines by bleeding exhauſted do ſoone drawe vnto them that wicked and lothſome matter, which lyeth in &amp; about the ſtomacke: whereof looke more in the fifth impediment.
               The ſixteenth impediment, may be cuſtome, or a former order oflife: wherein wee are to conſider, to what meates wee haue beene moſt accuſtomed: what excrementes are ſtill reteined in the bodye, contr

                  od, may bleede more in quantitie than they that haue not bin accuſtomed to bleede. In this impediment, moreouer, conſideratiō muſt be had,

whether Hemorroids or Termes, are reſtreined, contrarie to former cuſtome. Or whether wee ſtill vſe our accuſtomed exerciſes or no. But although diuers matters herein are to be regarded: yet in cuſtome princicipally, theſe three are to be marked: The precedent order of dyet: the kinde of life, that we haue ſpent before: and former euacuations. Thoſe that haue liued ſparingly, either by their owne ordinarie preſcription, or by occaſion of ſicknes; are to bleede leſſe. Thoſe that haue liued more frankly, may bleede more plentifully. He that hath been alreadie let bloud, ſo that the natural powers be not thereby too much enfeebled, may, as I now ſaid, better abide to bleed, than they that neuer were let bloud. For this is a generall rule: Things accuſtomed, yea, if they be euill things, are the leſſe grieuous; whereby is confuted the opinion of the vulgar ſort: who greatly commend the firſt opening of a veine, as a matter greatly healthfull: and diſcommend all the other bleedings, making their reconing of this in their moſt extremities: that though they were neuer let bloud before: yet now they will ſend for the Phlebotomer, as their laſt refuge.
               The ſeuenteenth impediment is, carnall copulation: preſently after which, the opening of a veine is alſo forbidden, becauſe

                  Venus ſo lately embraced, hath thrown down and weakened the powers of the bodie, and warmed the ſame more than was conuenient. How the powers of mans bodie are looſened &amp; enfeebled through venerious actes: Galen moſt excellently declareth, lib. 1. de Semine. cap. 25. ſaying: In the time of carnall copulation, the ſtones or genitors, drawe forth of the veines all ſuch ſeedie humor as is conteined in them; which is not much in quantities and that which is the ſame, is admixed with the bloud in the likenes of dewe: and this to do, is the office of the Teſticles. So that firſt by the genitors hauing more ſtrength than the veines; the ſeedie moyſture is violently drawen from them. And againe, the veines drawe the ſame from the members next vnto them: Theſe partes againe exhauſt from thoſe next vnto them in like ſort: ſo that this extraction ceaſeth not, till it haue gone thorow euery part or member of mans body: by reaſon whereof, all the bodily partes are depriued of their proper nouriſhment: and always that part which is perfectly &amp; throughly euacuated, violently taketh from that which is next adiacent, and hath more plentie of ſeedie moyſture to be extracted. This (I ſay) being done alwayes, and all partes mutually participating among themſelues: neceſſarily all the receptories, and partes of the

whole bodie muſt be euacuated, till the ſtrongeſt of all the partes be filled. And further, it commeth to paſſe, not onely that the ſeedie moyſture is drawen from the partes of the bodie through carnall copulation; but alſo the vitall ſpirites paſſe out of the arteries with the ſame. And therefore it is no

And foraſmuch as now the bodie is more than inongh enfeebled &amp; brought lowe, thorough a long continuing and languiſhing ſickneſſe: by bleeding wee maye more eaſily quite extinguiſh the patient, than remedie the diſeaſe.

The nineteenth impediment, is ſmall quantitie of humors being in the bodie: for a good conſideration is to be had, how the humors offend in the bodie in quantitie or in qualitie: VVhether there be many or fewe humors in the pacient. And therefore ſometime vpon this ground, wee open a veine in weomen with child, if there be abundance of bloud, ſufficient both for the mother and the infant in the wombe, if the bodily ſtrength be firme, and that the greatnes of the diſeaſe in them ſo require it. But hereof more at large I meane to write in another place. And ag
                     •
                  ine, beſide the quantitie: the diuerſitie of nature in humors is alſo a profitable conſideration in this practiſe. For euen according to the varietie of humors, the patient is oft either to be let bloud, or not lettē bloud: which Galen ſeemeth to witneſſe, li. 4. de Sanita tuend. ſaying: Some humors come to perfect nutriment before the bloud: ſome are as it were, halfe concocted: ſome altogether rawe and vndigeſted: Some are but little different from the forme of bloud: ſome are wholly changed into bloud: ſome verie litle, ſome more, ſome verie much. VVhen humors are a verie little, as it were, from the nature of bloud, as not yet turned into the ſame: or when they haue a verie little exceeded further than the nature of bloud: wee

may confidently open a veine. VVhen the ſame is more than a verie little, either the one way or the other, on this ſide or beyond▪ wee are to deale herein more conſiderately. If the humors want much of, or exceed much beyond the nature of blond; we are altogether to forbeare bleeding.
               The twentieth let: after the ſmall quantitie of the other humors, may be the quantitie of the bloud: which the wiſe Phiſition in this practiſe will moſt wiſely regard. As for example: if there be little good bloud in the body, and abundance of other humors: wee are to make ſtaie from opening a veine. If any of the other three humors be but litle in quantitie, and the bloud abundant; we may boldly let bloud. Yea, by diligent obſeruation the Phlebotomer ſhall eaſily perceiue, what hurtfull humor may be withdrawen with the bloud: and therfore, if there be many cholerike humors in the body of man, and yet not mixt with the bloud: or that there be many flegmatike and rawe humors, and but little bloud; by no meanes is a veine to be opened. This doth Anicen forbid in quarta primi. Cap. 20. If the bloud be good and little, and that there be in the ſame bodie many ill humors alſo: bleeding taketh away the good, and leaueth the bad behind. And a little after he addeth: that the Phiſition is

diligently to beware, leſt by vnskilful bleeding in theſe caſes, hee bring the patient (after he hath extracted the bloud, (the ill humors ſtill remaining) to an exceſsiue heat of cholericke humors, or too much cruditie of colde and vndigeſted humors. And although (as ye haue heard before) Phlebotomy doth equally euacuate all humors. Yet becauſe now ſo little bloud is in the veines, whereof a little portion is withdrawen by bleeding: it followeth that but a little bloud, and leſſe than before, remaineth now in the veines with the other humors: and that there is great plentie of the other humors: foraſmuch as they come not out ſo redily, when a veine is opened, as the bloud doth: and therefore, by a neceſſarie conſequent, bloud being gone: which was, as it were, a bridle to other humors: choler muſt exceſſiuely boile, and flegme become more colde and vndigeſted. VVhereupon alſo I gather, that thoſe haue done ill, and verie vnskilfully, which haue reproued Auicen of error in this place, ſeeing he is rather verie highly to be commended: then vpon euery ſmall and light occaſion to be reprehended.
               Finally, wee are to forbeare letting of bloud after continuall vomitings, hunger, great watchings, extreme labours, and after

all ſuch things, as immoderately

               IN this Chapter I wil be but briefe, becauſe I was prolixe in the other before, from whence many things concerning this point, may be verie well, and with great profit taken. Neither determined 
                     •
                   at the firſt, to haue made hereof a diſtinct Chapter: but that in certaine Latine writers I found the like done before: whom I thought good to imitate. Firſt, therefore this practiſe is beſt for delicate, idle, and corpulent perſons, which vſe to feed plentifully on the beſt nouriſhing meates, without taking any great paine, as Auicen witneſſeth in prim.
               
               Secondly, for ſuch as haue abundance of bloud; which is knowen by many vnfallible ſignes, and ſpecially by thickneſſe of vrine: For abundance of bloud maketh the vrine thicke, as aboundance of yellow choler maketh the ſame thinne.
               Thirdly, for ſuch as abounde with Melancholy, hauing in their bodies, much naturall Melancoly running with the bloud, becauſe bloud is not throughly purified from it in the Liuer. And therefore in this caſe Phlebotomy muſt go before purging, and not contrane, as hath beene aforeſaide.
               
                  
And here is to be noted, that Melancolie is two-folde. One kinde is naturall: another kinde is not naturall. Naturall Melancoly is the refuſe of bloud: And when the ſame aboundeth, it runneth about in the bodie with the bloud: and to euacuate it, a veine muſt be opened: and ſo this kinde of Melancolie paſſeth with the bloud, becauſe bloud and the refuſe thereof, that is naturall Melancolie, commeth of one and the ſelfe ſame temperate heate. And when euacuation is thus done, a purgatiue may be vſed. But let purgation ſucceede Phlebotomie after ſome ſpace, namely, when the concoction is finiſhed.
               Fourthly, bleeding is much profitable to thoſe in whome is to be feared ſome extraordinarie heat, ſhortly to followe: or ſome extraordinarie boyling, either of bloud or of humors, or ſome other perturbation of bodie, through too much aboundance of theſe. Such perſons as feare or feele any of theſe things, are preſently to haue a veine opened. VVhere note, that this rule yet oft deceiueth diuers practiſioners: For when their pacients doe feele any heate or calefaction, preſently they iudge it ſome ebullition of humors, and ſo let them bloud: whereas the ſame may come through heate and inflammation of yellow choler: in which caſe

it is ſo farre off by bleeding, that the heat &amp; ebullition ſhould be allayed, that they are the rather thereby encreaſed and ſtirred vp. For bleeding (as hath beene tolde you before) prouoketh the humors to runne thorow out the whole bodie, with the greater violence. In ſuch a caſe, therefore opening of a veine ſhould not be vſed; except the ſame heat and ebullition came altogether of aboundance of humors: which is knowen through abundance of ſweat; chiefely that ſweat which is in the morning. For ſome do not ſweate, but when they haue neede of euacuation.
               Fiftly, it is to be practiſed on them alſo eſpecially, whoſe bodily powers are firme and ſtrong: and that are of a ſanguine complexion, that is hote and moyſt: and not colde and drye. Rhazes, lib. 7. ad Almonſo. Chap. 21. ſayeth: Corpora quae venas habent amplas, &amp; conſpicuas, quaeque hirſuta ſunt, &amp; colore inter rubrum fuſcunqne medio, adoleſcentum nimirum, iuuenum, &amp; ſenum non decrepitorum, Phlebotomiae preſidia magis tollerare poſſunt: pueris vero &amp; infirmis vena ſecanda non eſt, niſi maxima incumbente neceſſitate. i. Such bodies as haue large and manifeſt veines, that are hairie, and of colour betweene red and browne: ſpecially of ſtripplings,

yong men and olde men, not decrepites: may moſt ſafely awaye with the helpe of bleeding. But wee are not to open a veinein children, and weake folke, except great neceſsitie ſo require.
               Sixtly, this practiſe is with great heede to be vſed: or rather not at all to be vſed after the paine of the cholicke, or rather immoderat perturbation of the bowels: either aboue or beneath: whether it be Cholica paſsio, or Illiaca: For the Humors, as ye haue heard in the Chapter before, being mooued by bleeding, the chollericke humor would flowe vnto the ſtomacke, and inflame the ſame: nor yet after ſtrong vomits. For the like euent woulde followe: nor after a laske.
               Theſe and ſuch like extremities vehemently heating rhe bodie, and greatly diſſoluing the ſame: if they ſhould concur
                     •
                  e with Phlebotomy: they would too much inflame the bodie, exceſsiuely moue the humors, and mightily weaken the forces of Nature, as appeareth in the Chapter before. Fig. 20.
               
               Seuenthly, weomen with child, or hauing their termes, are not to be let bloud. In weomen with childe, this is the reaſon: becauſe naturall heat ſeruing for digeſtion, woulde

thereby be diminiſhed, and ſo nutriment would be with-holden from the child, which were verie dangerous, if the mother were farre gone with child. The fruit in the womb is nouriſhed by the Termes: and not hauing whereby to be nouriſhed, it muſt of force in the wombe (hauing life, and wanting nouriſhment) die for hunger. And againe being loſened from the naturall ſtaies in the womb, it falleth out of the naturall boundes, and ſo cauſeth aborſion. This (I ſay) ſooner happeneth when the yong frute in the wombe is growen much, and the mother farre gone therewith: for then it needeth the more nouriſhment, which it can neither finde nor haue, the bloud being diminiſhed. Fulchſius writeth more hereof 31. Coment. lib. 5. Aphoriſ▪Hippon. But here I am to adde: that albeit in auncient time it was accounted perilous to let bloud weomen with childe, as appeareth by that which hath beene now ſaid: yet out of the Chapter precedent Fig. 19. it partly appeareth, that this practiſe may be done diſcreetely and ſafely, in weomen with childe, if neceſsitie ſo vrge: chiefely, if bloud be abundant in them: if the bodie be firme and ſtrong. I affirme that they may bleede: But becauſe it hath beene reputed dangerous; wee muſt carefully ſee that we take not from them much bloud. To take a little after the

fourth or fifth moneth of conception hurteth not. Yea, experience prooueth, that women thereby are made merry and light, whereas before they were very melancholly, feeling alwaies about them an vnaccuſtomed heauines: yea, through a little bleeding they are inabled with the more facility, to beare their burden to the due and iuſt time of their deliuerance. Againe, ſome women being with child require twiſe to bleede: that is to ſay, when they are halfe gone, and in the beginning of the eighth moneth; but hereof take great heede, except the woman greatly abound with bloud. I haue ſeene ſaith Guinterus a woman with child, that hath beene let bloud three times, in the ſecond, the fifth and eighth moneth: becauſe ſhee was very ſanguine, and had experience once or twiſe before, of aborſion the third moneth, if ſhee had not bled the ſeconde moneth. In the other moneths the fifth and eighth ſhee was in danger of ſuffocation, except ſhee had bled againe. VVhen women are brought a bed, they muſt not bleede, except their ſeconde birth be ſuppreſſed, or a Feuer moleſt them: In the which caſes alſo, carefully conſider in the Patient, her naturall ſtrength. Thoſe that haue their termes naturally, according to the due courſe of nature, and the courſe of the moneth: are not to bee let bloud, except in

immoderate Fluxes, to drawe backe the matter. VVhen they breake forth naturally, the whole matter is to bee let alone to nature.
               Eighthly, bleeding is not good for ſuch perſons as are bounde, and haue the excrements retained. For as yee heard in the eighth Chapter, Fig. 2. The veynes beeing emptied, they attract matter from the next members, and they attract from the ſtomacke the moyſtnes of the excrements, whereby they become more dried and baked, bring diuers waies annoyance to the body. In which caſe the wombe by Art is to be made ſolluble, as appeareth in the place now cited.
               Finally a veyne may and is to bee opened, without hurt or daunger, whenſoeuer wee feele our ſelues to bee heauy, lumpiſh, and ſtopped or ſtuffed in our bodies; firſt conſidering the quantity and quality of the fulneſſe: which wee may knowe and diſcerne, by certaine tokens, whether it bee Plenitudo quo ad vaſa, or quo ad vires, as was ſhewed in the firſt Chapter, the more heauy and drowſie a man feeleth him ſelfe to be; ſo much the more it appeareth to bee that fulneſſe, which is quo ad vires: But if hee feele the former ſtuffing in his body increaſed,

than is it that plenitude Quo ad vaſa. And thus much to know the quantity of the Repletion.
               The quality of the fulneſſe is knowen, partly by the colours, partly by thoſe things which are very neerely ioyned to the nature of the humors: But of theſe ſignes ſufficient hath been ſpoken before in the firſt Chapter.
               In theſe caſes of Repletion, if the ſtrength of the body ſhall bee anſwerable, wee are to open a veyne: for as much as bleeding is the chiefeſt remedy to abate fulneſſe. But if the ſtuffing and fulneſſe of the body bee greatly grieuous, and the ſtate of the body not anſwerable: it is not alwaies neceſſary to let bloud, As Galen noteth, lib. de Curand. ratio. per ſanguinis miſſio. And againe, Phlebotomy is not onely profitable when any of the foreſaid fulneſſes grieue and oppreſſe vs: But alſo (as hath beene ſaide) in caſes without any fulneſſe: As in the beginning of an inflammation, which commeth either of a blow, ache, paine, or weakeneſſe of the member. For paine (as was ſaide) draweth the bloud vnto it, and of the weakeneſſe of the bodily parts, cauſe an inflammation without fulneſſe.
               
                  
Alſo when the diſeaſe is great and vehement, we let bloud, although no fulnes appear in the Patient: yet alwaies hauing a regard to the age and ſtrength of the party, as Hyppocrates ſetteth downe in theſe wordes, 4. Vict. acutorum, 17. In acutis morbis ſanguinem de

                     ivehemens morbus videatur, florueritque aegrotanti aet as, &amp; virium affuerit robur. That is, in ſharpe diſeaſe thou ſhalt let bloud if the ſickenes ſeeme great, if the age of the Patient permit, and that there be ſufficiencie of naturall ſtrength. And thus much of the perſons that are to bleede, concerning the which point, more may be eaſily coniectured and collected of the ſtudious Practitioner, from the Chapters precedent.
            
            
               What corruption of Humors bleeding remoueth from the veines. Chap. 10.
               IT hath beene ſaid, that bleeding generally, is the preſent and proper helpe, when Humors offend in the veyns either in quantity or in quality. It hath been already declared, that ſome humors it euacuateth, other ſome it reuoketh and pulleth backe, which is called revulſion, whereof hath beene ſpoken in a diſtinct Chapter by it ſelfe. Now order requireth in ſome briefe ſort to ſhew what corruption of humors generally, bleeding euacuateth

from the veynes. The defect of humors in the veynes is either Plethora, or Cacochymia, as was ſhewed in the firſt Chapter. The onely and peculiar remedy of Plethora, or abundance of bloud, is the opening of a veyne. And foraſmuch as fulnes of bloud is of two ſorts: One of fulnes ſimple and pure, conſiſting of a like proportion of the beſt humors: and the other vnpure and compounded, taking part with Cacochymia: that is, abundance of humors corrupted in the veynes. Therefore it is to bee marked, that in both theſe Repletions, the opening of a veyn greatly profiteth. VVhen ſo euer therefore the muſcles are ſounde, whole, and full, the veynes large, great, and ſwelling, menacing thereby imminent danger to the members: preſently bloud muſt bee detracted. After which eu cuation theſe effects will inſue: mitigation of paines cauſed by ouermuch retching of the veynes: eaſe vnto the body, which ſeemeth as it were nowe disburdened of a grieuous and waighty ponderouſnes: a more nimblenes to all exerciſe and labour than was before: an increaſe and refreſhing of the naturall heate: an opening of the ſtraight paſſages and pores of the members. Finally, there will follow a happy repulſe of diuers imminent dangers and diſeaſes, wherevnto by all probability in ſhort time the body

would haue beene brought.
               For it is greatly tobee feared, leſt the veynes ouerreatched with fulneſſe of bloud, ſhould open and breake, and through that meanes cauſe inflammation, or leſt ſome generall obſtruction ſhould ariſe, which might keepe backe the inwarde heate, and ſo vtterly choke vp the bodily forces wherby might bee cauſed ſome vehement hot feuer, or as it oft hapneth a ſodaine death of the party.
               Now from theſe daungers, can no man bee ſafely and ſpeedely freed, either by purging, exerciſe or abſtinence, but by bleeding, and with the bloud is this Repletion moſt ſafely abated.
               That fulnes which is vnpure and compounded, is not ſo ſafely cured by bleeding, and yet the more nigh that it commeth in likenes to that Repletion which is ſimple, and pure: the more confidently, and the more plentifully we may let bloud. And the more vnpure that it is, the more carefully and ſparingly ought a veyne to bee opened. Therefore thoſe perſons that haue an il conſtitution of body, and yet haue their veyns abundantly filled, or that beeing of a conſtitution, are yet repleat with corrupted meates: Theſe I ſay, are to bleede no longer, but to auoid the

danger of fulnes, and the impurities remaining behinde, are to bee expelled by Purgation.
               Hot chollericke Repletions, of all vnpure conſtitutions, are moſt ſafely abated by bleeding, becauſe bleeding in this caſe, not onely diminiſheth choler, but alſo cooleth the ſame mightily.
               Melancholly Repletions, can nothing ſo well away, with this practiſe, becauſe it doth not ſo exceede in heate, that it neede at all any refrigeration or cooling, and the flegmaticke conſtitution can in no caſe brooke it, for being a very cold complexion it quite reiecteth bleeding. For Phlebotomy by great cooling, ſo greatly increaſeth crudity and rawnes in the body, that it can neuer or very hardly bee recouered or amended.
               VVeakeneſſe of bodilie ſtrength, reſembleth this foreſaide Repletion, and therefore alſo by the ſelfe ſame reaſon, reiecteth any large euacuation. And in truth, is not in this reſpect to bee dealt withall, except the veynes abundantly repleate, threaten ſome great hurt, or that neceſſity ſo require it, and then it muſt not bee done all at once, but by little and little, as it hath beene before declared.
               
                  
Therefore in each and euery fulnes that is vnpure, we are to begin with opening a veyn, for without it wee cannot ſafely afterwardes purge. For a vehement purgation eſpecially (if bleeding haue not gone before) troubling and moleſting the full body both with much heate, and by force of the attractiue vertue: bringeth the Patient into greater hazarde than he was before, and therfore to conclude this point, the veynes being ſwollen, and filled, if moderate bleeding doo no good, it can doo no harme at all.
               The otherfulnes quae ad vires, which cannot very eaſily be knowen by ſignes, althogh it cannot ouerſtretch or breake the veynes, nor ouercome the inward heate: yet becauſe it oppreſſeth the weake forces of nature, leſt there ſhould inſue putrifaction or corruption of humors, it may be diminiſhed by opening of a veyne: Leauing yet behinde ſo much as nature may eaſily rule: yea, and the ſame alſo, (becauſe it bringeth no doubt of preſent danger) may be profitably taken away, with ſpare dyet or abſtinence. Of corruption and putrifaction of bloud and humors in the veynes without plenitude, called Cacochymia: that is, fulnes quae ad vires: There riſeth a great doubt, whether the ſame may aptly bee remooued by bleeding. VVee anſwer, that to remoue by bleeding a ſimple corruption

of humors in the veynes is profitable and eaſie (regard beeing had) both to the abundance thereof, and to the forces of nature in the Patient. For albeit when a veyne is opened, all humors iſſue forth equally, and that there remaine behind ſtill as there did before one and the ſelfe ſame proportion of humors: yet becauſe now by bleeding part is abated of that burden, wherewithall nature was before oppreſſed, the forces and powers natural waxe not the more feeble, but they become more ſtrong and chearefull, ſo that they can beare with the greater eaſe, thoſe humors, which as yet remaine ſtill behind, and nature hir ſelf gouerneth them with farre leſſe trouble than before. And herevpon in continuall feuers, when there is great crudity and corruption in the veyns, bloud being often times detracted, the vrine alſo beeing red, troubled, and thicke before: It appeareth nowe more cleare, and ſheweth forth euident ſignes of concoction. And note (here by the way) that the Phlebotomer muſt be very well exerciſed in thoſe ſignes, which prognoſticate fulnes, &amp; repletion. Yea &amp; ye muſt alſo know perfectly the place of each particular humor: leſt after the manner of the vnskilfuller ſort, when the noſe a little bleedeth, and the vrine appeare ſomewhat red, by and by yee doo let bloud▪ Whereas bloud often times eaſily commeth

forth, not onely by reaſon of fulnes, but vppon diuers other occaſions, nature her ſelfe often attempting voluntary eruptions of bloud. Hereof it commeth that ſuch perſons as haue (as it were) the ſmall litle mouths of the veines called Oſcula, eaten or gnawen: or that haue a weake and apoſtumated Liuer: and that Hydropicall perſons bleede oft at the noſe.
               Alſo vrine waxeth re
                     •
                   and bloudy, by the fretting of the ſtone in the Raines. Vrine waxeth yeallow in that kinde of yeallow iandies which is ſimple in Scirrho hepalis, That is in the hard part of the liuer: and in that kind of dropſie which is called Aſcites: Yet in theſe effects we are not to let bloud, for Cacochymia proceeding of corruption of the bowels, is not that way cured. Therefore the certaine knowledge when a veyne is to be opened neceſſarily, is onely gathered of thoſe markes and tokens which manifeſtly declare abundance of each humor: And hereby yee may gather, that bleeding alone ſpeedily helpeth that corruption of humors, which lyeth in the great veynes, and only freeth the Patient from this kind of corruption, except the ſame take beginning from the bowels ill affected: and in this kind of corruption, purgation is more meete than bleeding. And thus it app
                     •
                  areth in a generall ſort, what corruption of

humors the opening of a veyne doth remedy.
            
            
               A particular reherſall of thoſe diſeaſes preſent, or future, which are cured by bleding. Chap. 11.
               FIrſt as yee haue heard, a veyne is profitably opened in the two plenitudes, nature being ſtrong and the age conuenient. In the fulnes quaead vires, haue ſpeciall regard that the naturall forces be firme. But if in this plenitude, raw, cold, and vndigeſted humors bee greatly gathered together in the body, forbeare; taking this as a rule, that with great abundance of raw humors, the ſtrength of the body cannot ſtand as yee haue already partly heard, and as Galen witneſſeth, lib. de curand. ratio. per ſangui. miſſio. cap. 9.
               
               Secondly, it helpeth diſeaſes preſent, and future, and ſerueth both in the curatiue and preſeruatiue intention. VVe read that Galen in the ſpring time did let bloud thoſe perſons that were ſubiect to theſe diſeaſes following: to wite, Spitting of bloud: A polexies: Falling ſicknes: Peripneumonia: Plureſies: Anginaes: Stoppinges of Hemorroids or Termes: Swimmings in the head: The Gowt in the feete and in the ioynts. All which Auicen alſo ſetteth downe in quarta primi cap. de Phlebotomia.
               
               
                  
Thirdly, we doo not onely open a veyne in repletion, as Menodorus falſly ſuppoſeth; but alſo as hath beene ſaid without fulnes: when wee feare ſome inflammation through ſome fall or other accidentall griefe. And moreouer as wee haue already ſpecified, wee open a veyne for two purpoſes, ſometime to euacuate, ſometime to pull backe immoderate flux of humors to the contrary part, as Galen noteth lib. de Curand. ratio per ſang. miſſio. cap. 11 &amp; 9. Metho. Medend. cap. 11. As to ſtay bloud at the noſe we open a veyne in the arme. For this cauſe Galen lib. 13. Metho. Medend▪ ca. 21. in Letargus which is a drowſie and forgetfull ſicknes, riſing of impoſtumation, of cold putrified fleame, eſpecially, in the hinder part of the braine: whereby memory and reaſon almoſt periſheth, and the ſenſitiue power is greatly hindred, cauſing men commonly to forget their owne names, alſo to ſhut their mouthes after they haue gaped and by no meanes to ſtay from ſleeping. In this diſeaſe (I ſay) at the firſt beginning thereof, Galen willed to open a veyne, albeit the diſeaſe bee colde, rather as it ſeemeth to reuoke, than to euacuate the matter: or Galen ſo appointed it, becauſe fulnes is alwaies concurring with this forgetfull and drowſie diſeaſe.
               Herevpon Galen 11. Meth. Meden. cap. 15. affirmeth it to bee very healthfull to open a

veyne not onely in continuall feuers called Continentes: but in all feuers cauſed and kindled of a putrifieng humor, which ſhould not ſeeme to bee true, eſpecially in intermittant f
                     •
                  uers which leaue off for a time, as are tertian and quartan agues. Foraſmuch as in theſe, bloud offendeth not in the veynes: but ſome other humor beſide bloud, putrifieth without the veyns, which by bleeding in reaſon cannot be euacuated. This place of Galen cannot ſound to reaſon or experience, except we vnderſtand Galen to giue vs aduiſe to euacuate by bleeding the matter of ſuch intermittant feuers, as haue alſo with the bloud, fulneſſe, and abundance of other humors concurring: So that this may bee his meaning. Bleeding may bee vſed in intermittant feuers, if they fortune to haue abundance of humors ioyned with the bloud. For obſtruction as Galen ſheweth li. 11. Meth. Meden. cap. 4. happeneth in rotten and putrified feuers, ſometime through abundance of humors, ſometime through the clammines, groſnes and thickenes of them. Galen therefore counſelleth to let bloud in ſtaying and intermittant feuers: rather becauſe of the abundance, than the rottennes or putrifaction of the humor without the veynes. And that this is his meaning, appeareth by the words which Galen afterwards vſeth, ſaying:

Foraſmuch as nature ruling the body, by bleeding is lightned and disburthened of that wherwith ſhe was before oppreſſed, therfore ſhee will with eaſe ouercome that which reſteth and remaineth behinde, which is a 
                     〈◊〉
                   ſigne that Plethora or fulnes is alſo annox
                     •
                  d to ſuch feuers.
               Fourthly, in bleeding, we are not onely to conſider the diſeaſe it ſelf, which wee determine to remedie, but alſo oft times the cauſe therof: ſo that whatſoeuer the ſicknes be, if Phlebotomy may remoue the cauſe, then alſo it taketh away the griefe it ſelfe in the ende. Hereupō ſomtime, albeit the diſeaſe be cold, yet when the cauſe moueth vs to open a vein, we may ſafely bleede without hurt. Hippo. (ſaith Galen) ſheweth a cure of his done on a woman by letting her bloud in the Ankle. This woman after child-birth, was not freed ofher ſeconds: then a ſhaking came vpō her. This woman I cured (ſaith Hippo.) by letting her bloud in the Ankle, for all her ſhaking. Shaking is a cold affect, &amp; bloud is hote: and they that muſt be heated, muſt not haue bloud taken from them. He for al that, boldly did it: &amp; he ſheweth the reaſon. I conſidered (ſaid he) the cauſe, &amp; the occaſion of the cauſe. He knew the cauſe of ſhaking, was abundance of bloud kept backe, which was a burthen to nature. The occaſion of the cauſe

was the griefe of the matrix. This abundāce requiring euacuatiō, &amp; the affected part ſhewing the place moſt fit for eu
                     •
                  cuation: conſidering both theſe things together, he let her bloud in the ankle, becauſe the wombe or matrix was affected. In griefes of the womb or bellie, we take the vaine of the ankle, knowing by the Anotomie the communion betweene the veines: for ſome veines communicate to ſome part of the body, &amp; others to other partes. And euacuation is to be made from ſuch veines as haue fellowſhip with the member affected. For, as yee heard in the Chapter of Revulſion: if we take that veine which communicateth not with the part affected, wee hurt the whole bodye, &amp; do the griefe no eaſement. The profitable vſe of this fellowſhip of veines apeareth eſpecially in revulſion or pulling backe of humors, which is both wel &amp; ſpeedily done, when this cōmunitie of veins is obſerued, as was there declared. But let vs return to our former purpoſe.
               Fiftly, by opening of a veine, is cured the feuer called Synochus: both that which cōmeth of ebullition of blod without putrifaction, &amp; that which is cauſed with putrifaction of the bloud. So are alſo hereby cured continuing feuers, coming of putrifaction in the greater veines. And to theſe diſeaſes reckoned vp of Galen Fig. 2. we may adde theſe that follow:

Frenſies, Opthalmia parotis i. an apoſtumatiō about or behind the eares: diſeaſes of the Liuer &amp; ſplene: Nephritis. i. paines of the raines and backe: inflammations of the wombe or matrix: of the priuie partes: arme-holes: armes, thighes, &amp; ioynts. Finally, all inflammatiōs inward or outward, which the Greeks call Phlegmonae. Theſe inflamations are cauſed by flowing of bloud to a member when a veine is open &amp; broken: which bloud there abundantly heaped togither, bringeth forth a tumor or ſwelling. To theſe alſo are to be added: a conſumption in the beginning: vomiting of bloud: bleedings at the noſe, bely, or hemorroids: at the beginning of which diſeaſes, the opening of a veine greatly profiteth, ſtaying the force of the fluxe, &amp; by revulſion, if the veine be opened at the contrary part, calling back much of the matter frō the member affected: ſo that bleeding is a preſent helpe for thoſe diſeaſes whatſoeuer, which take the beginning from too much abundance of good bloud. Thoſe ſickneſſes which come of an vnpure &amp; mixt plenitude, becauſe they are ſomewhat neere linked vnto theſe; they may alſo be cured by bleeding. And although the matter of theſe diſeaſes be vnpure: yet either it lyeth in the veines, or procedeth from the veines. A gaine, by bleeding are cured Carbuncles, felons, moyſt

ſcabs, outward rednes in the skinne &amp; ſuch like: all theſe are cured by this practiſe.
               Thus alſo is cured the burning ague called Cauſus, &amp; all continuall feuers, whoſe putrifaction is conteined in the greater venies. Yet ſometime a continuall feuer commeth of an humor heaped togither &amp; inflamed about the ſtomack, chiefely about the mouth of the ſtomack, &amp; the flat parts of the Liuer, which feuer cannot be takē away by bleeding. Neither can the cauſe therof by this practiſe be remoued. Pure intermittant feuers, whether they be Tertians, Quartans, or Quotidians, becauſe the next matter &amp; proper cauſe of them is not in rhe greater veſſels, neither floweth from the veines, are not con
                     •
                  eniently cured hereby. And yet ſometime in theſe alſo we bleede, either when the veines ſwell with immoderat fulnes, ſo that therby ſome danger at hand may be feared: or when any accident of hote inflamed &amp; boyling bloud perſwadeth vs therto: as are namely beating paines of the head: toſsings &amp; mouing of the body this way &amp; that way: exceſsiue heat almoſt ſtragnling the pacient. Howbeit, theſe many times come alſo of boyling choler about the inward partes called praecordia, in the which caſes, bleeding remoueth neither the feuer, nor the cauſe therof: but onely aſſwageth the vehemencie of thoſe accidents,

which are preſent, or ſhortly like to enſue.
               Further, concerning perticuler affects cured hereby, we may adioyne, beating paines of the head: Letargus ſpoken of before fig. 3 and trembling of the heart. Theſe with the foreſaid, are not onely cured hereby, when they preſently affect and afflict the patient, but happening yerely vnto vs: ſo that it is verie likely we ſhalbe grieued with them in time to come. VVe may verie well preuent them by bleeding, whē we haue once eſpied plenitude to haue beene in vs, the cauſes of theſe infirmities. For there is one &amp; the ſelfſame way of healing common, both to maladies preſent and future. And thoſe thinges which are to be done when diſeaſes are preſent, may likewiſe be attempted when the ſame are but a beginning, or nigh at hand. And here is to be repeated that which hath bin alreadie ſaid, &amp; cannot be too often ſpoken: that ſome time we open a veine, not only without fulneſſe, but euen in emptineſſe: namely, when ſome euident cauſe: as a bruze, ache, or heat, cauſeth flux ofhumors, &amp; bringeth inflammation to the members: and this is done, not for any greatnes, or feare of any preſent griefe; but for ſome doubt of that which is a beginning, &amp; as it were, at hand.
               Here ariſeth a doubt, whether it be more vſuall to open a veine, the diſeaſe being now

preſent, or future &amp; nie at hand. The anſwere is, that when the fulnes is very great &amp; dangerous, though the diſeaſe be not yet cauſed, notwithſtanding, without hurt the pacient may bleed plentifullie, becauſe the bloud offendeth nature in the aboundance thereof. And hereby the Pacient is oft made ſafe, and eſcapeth the daunger of ſickneſſes approching. But when a diſeaſe is bred, and the forces of nature impaired or leſſened, either by the preſence or long continuance thereof: iuſt euacuation of bloud, without hurt, can by no poſſible meanes be made. Whereupon Hippo councelleth to preuent by bleeding accuſtomable impediments rather then to ſtay their approch and comming. Hereuppon alſo in that kind of feuer called Ephemera, which dureth commonly but one day, &amp; is cauſed of obſtruction. In the feuer called Synocris ſimplex, bloud is aboundantly withdrawen, before the matter do putrifie. Therfore this is the cōcluſion of this matter, that bloud is let more ſafely before the ſicknes be preſent &amp; already come, thē when in truth it is preſēt: &amp; with greater profit are we to ſee his comming a far off, and ſo beware of him, thē to ſtay til he come, &amp; thē labour to repel him: wherin we are to remember a prety and common verſe ſeruing fitly to this purpoſe.

               Reaſon imputeth thus much: that when ſicknes preſently poſſeſſeth any pacient, the ſame requireth a ſpeedie remedie, with a greater neceſſitie, than when as, it hath not yet inuaded. Wherupon this alſo followeth, that opening of a veine is more neceſſarie, when a griefe is preſent, then when the ſam e is but onely approching. The crueltie of a preſent aduerſarie vrgeth vs with a greater neceſſitie, than the daunger of an enimie that may come, but is not yet preſent. And ſo I conclude, that in a preſent diſeaſe there is a neceſſitie. In a diſeaſe onely imminent, there is but onely, in a manner, a ſecuritie. For a further inſtruction, to know what diſeaſes in particular are cured by this practiſe: I referre thee to a Chapter hereafter following, which declareth in particular, what veine is to be opened in ech particular diſeaſe.
            
            
               
               What voluntary eruption of bloud profiteth 
                     〈◊〉
                   ſicknes. Chap. 12.
               BLoud voluntarily and of it ſelfe iſſueth foorth from the noſe, the veines called Haemorroidae, and the belly: and ſometime alſo out of the mouth by coughing and vomitting. From other partes of the bodie it commeth not except very ſeldome, and that againſt nature. But from what part ſoeuer it come, if it bleede ſlowly and ſparingly, and albeit the ſame bee according to nature, yet we are to account it vnprofitable: for it nether remoueth the diſeaſe, neitheir diſſwadeth vs from that conuenient euacuation by art, which the vehemencie of the diſeaſe requireth. That voluntarie flux of bloud which is aboundant either in plenitude, oppreſſing natnre, or in that feuer called Sinocha is profitale, and oft cureth the ſame in the iudgement day called dies Criticus. For in aſmuch as then a generall euill equally (as it were) occupyeth all the veines, from whence ſoeuer abatement of bloud happen, it ceaceth theſe accidents of heuines &amp; fulnes.
               But in the feuer Cauſon, and in all other cō
                  tinual feuers, in the which other humors putrifie in the greater veines: bloud iſſuing forth neuer ſo plentifully, bringeth not ſuch profit; and bleeding at the noſe, though it

watchinges, rauinges, headach and other ſuch like accidents, yet very hardly it remoueth the proper cauſe, and roote (as it were) of the diſeaſe: except there fall out ſome immoderat bleeding, euen (as it were) to the diſſolution of the natural forces: which in very deed is neuer to be wiſhed or deſired. For corrupt bloud laſt of all floweth out of the noſe, yea and not before there hath paſſed great ſtore of the good &amp; profitable bloud. And therefore in theſe feuers, albeit the pacient bleed much &amp; oftentimes, yet a veine in the arm muſt be opened. Experiēce (I ſay) proueth, that oft out of the noſe commeth good bloud, both in colour and ſubſtance, when vnpure and filthy bloud is drawen out of the arme.
               A boundant flux of bloud in theſe diſeaſes, out of the Hemorroidae veines, are out of the belly: becauſe it floweth next of all from the holow veine of the loines: the ſame is to be accounted much more profitable thā the aboueſaid. Yet neither doth this many times take away the verie root of the feuer, which lieth lurking in the veines next the hart. Wherupon it cōmeth to paſſe, that oftētimes we let bloud in the arme, notwithſtanding: yet but ſparingly in flux of termes, in womē brought a bed, &amp; freed of their ſeconds: leſt we inflame &amp; kindle in them the heat of an

ague. A like reaſon and more apparant there is alſo ſometime to let bloud in the arme, when the hemeroids flow. For inflammation and other diſeaſes of thoſe partes which are aboue the liuer and midriffe: are litle or nothing at all eaſed by fluxe of bloud from the hemoroids or belly: Neither thoſe that occupy the lower partes by flux of bloud from the noſe. Alſo flux of bloud out of the right noſthril helpeth not affectes on the left ſide: nor contrary. And therefore voluntary eruptiō of bloud without reaſon forbiddeth not that bleeding which is to bee done according to art, reaſon and experience. Againe Phlebotomy helpeth diſeaſes either of it ſelf, or accidentally. Of it ſelfe it euacuateth or pulleth backe. Accidentally, ſometime it cooleth, drawing forth the hotter bloud: ſometime it openeth obſtructions, yet only thoſe which proceede of fulnes, and it is alwaies to bee vſed in thoſe affectes, which it helpeth of it ſelfe: but not alwaies in thoſe which it cureth by accident. To helpe hot diſtemperature of the Liuer by bleeding, when there is in the Pacient little bloud, is not the beſt way, but rather vſe for that purpoſe ſuch things as are of their owne nature cooling, and take proper remedies for hot diſtemperature: and thus much for this matter.
            
            
               
               How to know by certain
                     •
                   ſignes the greatnes of the diſeaſe, and the firmenes of the naturall forces: wherby coniecture may be made, whether the Pacient bee to be let bloud or no. Chap. 13.
               
               IN euerie affect, wherin bleeding auaileth: the ſame is out of hand to bee done, if the diſeaſe be vehement, and the ſtrength of nature agreeable. Touching the diſeaſe it is ſometime ſo ſmall, that it is cured alone of it ſ
                     •
                  lfe without the helpe of art. And although at other times the ſame be very vehement &amp; great, yet the forces of nature not onely ſceme, but alſo are indeede ſo weake, that they can not tollerat any euacuation. Yea vndoubtedly this practiſe would vndoo, diſ
                     •
                  roy, &amp; diſſolue the whole ſubſtance of the naturall forces, for whoſe preſeruation ſake (in truth) we take the cure in hand. Therfore to know thorowly and perfectly, how much bloud is to be takē in euery diſeaſe, we muſt firſt conſider how great and greeuous the ſicknes is, and how firme and ſtrong the powers of nature are. Now a diſeaſe is either already cauſed, and in ſtate, or is now a beginning or proceeding to ſtate. Againe a diſeaſe is called great &amp; greeuons, ether in regard of it ſelfe, or of the cauſe thereof, which conſiſteth in the humors, or in regard of the greuouſnes of ſome accident. But firſt, it is great

of his owne kinde and nature. Thus an inflammation in any mēber is more greeuous, then a ſimple diſtemperature in the ſame member. And again the greatnes of a diſeaſe is iudged by the great vſe and excellency of the mēber which it poſſeſſeth: as if it be any principall member, namely the hart, braine, or Liuer, and it is contraty when the griefe is in a baſe, vnnoble or no principall member. Againe, iudgement touching the greatnes of a diſeaſe, is to be giuen according to the locall placing of the members, as they ſtand next to the principall partes. Therefore next the diſeates of the hart, braine, and liuer, are to be accompted thoſe of the lunges, ſides, ſtomacke, and ſplen: and wee are otherwiſe to iudge of thoſe that are in parts further off: as namely the bowels, raines, bladder and the outward limmes conſiſting of bones, fleſh, and ſinewes, called in Latine Artus, and in all the other members, placed in the extremities of the body. Againe in this point iudgement may be giuen by the ſenſiblenes or feeling of the member wherein the griefe is, if the diſeaſed member haue a quick ſenſe, and a liuely feeling, the greater ferre is the danger, than if the member were but of a blunt and dull ſence.
               The greatnes of the cauſe in any diſeaſe is iudged by the condition and nature of the

humour that is gathered to the part affected, &amp; is there the continual matter of the griefe: wherein we are to conſider whether the humour be good or bad, putrified or not putrified, or of what ill quallity it is any māner of way. And alſo whether the ſame humour be too much or too litle: &amp; if the humor which is the cauſe of the ſicknes be wicked &amp; corrupt, thē we may ſoon iudge the griefe to be great. The greatnes of the antecedent cauſe is perceiued by the fulnes or emptines of the veins, bowels, &amp; of the whole body, &amp; by the purity or impurity of humours, cōteined in the ſame. We iudge the greatnes of the accidents, by the intention &amp; remiſſion of thoſe things which do chaunce: as the increaſing or diminiſhing of paine, thirſt, appetit, watchings, and ſuch like: all which bring down the forces of nature, and make the Pacient to languiſh.
               As for example: If any yll diſeaſe, as namely an inflammation, poſſeſſe the Liuer, braine, or parts next the hart, and that there be a venomed and putrified humour, wh
                     ••
                  ewith the veines of the body appeare to bee ſtuffed and filled; ſo that there inſueth in the patient, agitation of the bodie, ill appetite, thirſt, paine, &amp; watchinges: this ſicknes wo may eſteeme vehement, in the which euacuation may do great good. And againe a

diſeaſe in which theſe do not concurre, but rather their contraries, we may iudge a ſmall infirmitie, and not requiring any euacuation. Betweene theſe are their interiected ſickneſſes, of a middle ſorte, which are to bee euacuated more or leſſe according to the remiſſion or intention of the diſeaſe, and the accidents thereof.
               Now let vs come to the eſtimation of the forces of nature, of the natural powers ſome are ſetled, and bred in particular members: and are common, and flowing to all partes of the bodie. The forces of nature bred and ſetled in a member, haue one and the ſelfe ſame eſſence (as it were) of the inward heat: and they are called one nature, and are ingendred (as a man might ſay) of the internall ſpirits, and the firſt begotten moiſture: whereunto is added (as a matter thereunto requiſite) a ſound and whole ſubſtance of bodilie members. The eſſence of the common forces of nature, haue (as it were) a threefold originall or beginning, or is 
                     ••
                  threefold ſpirit diffuſed and ſpred into the whole body.
               The force called virtus animalis, the animall vertue, is diffuſed from the braine, by the ſinewes: The vitall force from the hart, by the arteries: The naturall ſtrength from the Liuer by the veines: The bodily powers

that are bred in ech of theſe parts: the brain, the hart, and the Liuer, are ſuſteined by thoſe common and flowing powers of nature: ſo that the whole liuing creature, name ly man is ruled and gouerned of both theſe vertues: Inſitae &amp; communes, ſetled and common (to vſe as good engliſh wordes as wee may) to make manifeſt this great point of phiſicks ſkill. Therefore if this liuing creature and moſt excellent creature man, bee in perfect health: of neceſſitie theſe powers of nature muſt be ſound and vncorrupted, which they will bee, if their ſubſtance conſiſt in a iuſt moderation, that is to ſay, in a iuſt or right quantity, and in a good temperament. And contrary wiſe, if the quantitie or temperament of their ſubſtance, be inuerted, chaunged, turned, or altered, they muſt needes ſuffer hurt and offence, and ſo become weake and enfeebled: Whereby their functions are preſently hindered, the rule of all the bodie is diſordered, and at length there will follow euen extinction of life it ſelfe. And therefore whether the natures forces are weake or ſtrong: may be knowen by their ſeuerall operations &amp; duties. Thus raw and vndigeſted excrementes, either by ſiege or by vriyne, when either the one or the other is thinne, watriſh, or like vnto water, wherein fleſh is waſhed, do ſhew imbe
                  
                     •
                  illity

of naturall force: ſo doth holding backe of theſe excremntes, or any other function naturall, that is ſtaied or hindered.
               Wee diſcerne the vitall ſtrength to be enfebled by obſcure languiſhing, and ſmal pulſe▪ by breathing hardly and with paine, and oftner, &amp; more quickly thā was accuſtomed: by ſmalnes and faintnes of ſpeach: ſo as the ſame onely come thereby, and not thorow fault of the lunges and breſt; as ſometime it doth, in whom notwithſtanding the vitall force may be ſufficiently ſtrong. The contraries to theſe, declare firme ſtrength of the vitall vertue.
               Theſe thinges declare the animall po wers to be enfebled: tumblings and toſſings of the bodie, the ſenſes offended, watchinges, rauings, and other principal actions hindered. The contraries hereunto ſhew the contrarie, that is, firmnes &amp; ſtrength of the animal vertue. By theſe functions then you ſee, how it may be coniectured what power in nature is hurt or offended.
               Againe theſe powers are offended, or ſeem enfebled two waies: either becauſe they are outwardly oppreſſed, or becauſe they languiſh inwardly of themſelues, &amp; in the euacuation it helpeth greatly to know the one from the other: for the forces oppreſſed require large euacuatiō, &amp; the other none at al.

And the diſtinction of theſe is to bee ſought out of their euident cauſes. If cauſes haue gone before, which haue already altered or waſted the ſubſtance of the forces naturall: then wee may iudge them that they are faint and languiſhed. If theſe cauſes haue not been precedent, but that the Patient is only troubled with an vnaccuſtomed ponderoſity: then theſe are but wronged and oppreſſed. The euident and outwarde cauſes which alter the temperament of the ſetled vertues: are burning Agues, which melt the bodily moyſtures, or whatſoeuer els, that exceſſiuely heateth, cooleth, moyſteneth, or dryeth, the ſounde, maſſiue, ſtrong, and ſolide parts of the bodie. The ſubſtance of theſe parts is waſted by very long ſicknes, which bringeth the Patient into an Atrophia that is, a kind of conſumption, wherein the body conſumeth away with leanneſſe, and is not nouriſhed albeit the ſicke continually eate his meate: Or into Tabes, which is an other kinde of conſumption, waſting the body by long ſickenes and lacke of nouriſhment, conſuming and putrifieng the Lites: drying away the Patient, for want of naturall moyſture, hauing matter and bloud mixt together.
               The threefold ſpirit of the flowing humor is altered, ether through ſome diſtemperature, or ſome poiſoned qualitie, of the aire

which compaſſeth vs about, or through the il quallity of other thinges, which violently breake in vppon vs: or through ſome w
                     •
                  cked diſpoſition of the bowels or other humours. The heate of the aire, not onely of that which outwardly compaſſeth vs about, but alſo that which wee draw into our bodies by breathing, inflameth firſt the lunges, then the hart, &amp; all the ſpirits, ſo far till often times a feuer is kindled, and cauſed thorow the ſame. Thorow which diſtemperature of the ſpirits, needs muſt the ſtrength of the body languiſh &amp; becom enfeebled: yea by this exceſſiue heat of the air, the ſpirits are not only ſubiect to alteration of temperament, but beſides they are alſo thereby greatly waſted &amp; diminiſhed. Euen ſo in like maner, immoderat cold outwardly, &amp; the ſame receiued inwardly into the body by breathing, weakneth the ſpirits, &amp; inward heat: yea &amp; ſōtime altogether put out, and extinguiſh the ſaṁe. The aire venemous &amp; peſtilent, drawen into the bodie with an infection quite ouerturneth the ſpirits of life and ofnature: wherof 
                     •
                  nſu
                     •
                  th grieuous ſickneſſes to the body, no litle decay of bodily ſtrength, yea life it ſelfe is taken away by the ſo daine diſeaſe, commonly called the plague.
               Now much more apparantly are the ſpirites infected with bi
                     •
                  ings of Scorpions, mad

dogs, and venemous beaſts, than by the contagion of the Aire.
               Moreouer they are inwarde and hidden cauſes, which doo greatly alter the ſpirits, and whenſoeuer any principall part of the bodie, is troubled with any diſtemperature, vpon any occaſion: If the ſame proceed far, it muſt of neceſſity goe to the ſpirites there bred and ingendred: And ſo by offending of them will leſſen the ſtrength and vertue of nature. Alſo if any corruption of humor rule in the body, the ſpirits are diſperced, and offended by the corruption or diſtemperature of the ſame humors. Therefore when abundance of rawe humors, paſſeth either the whole body or the ſtomacke: and chiefly the mouth of the ſtomacke, the ſubſtance both of inward heate, and of the ſpirits waxe cold, the Patient languiſheth, yea, ſometime hee giueth ouer the Ghoſt and ſoundeth. Herevppon alſo when hot choler burneth, as it were, the inwarde ſpirits with immoderate heate, or nippeth and pricketh the mouth of the ſtomacke: it is the cauſe of no ſmall euils in the body of man. Sometime alſo it falleth out, that ſome one or other humor in the body is mixed, beſprinckled or bedewed, as it were, with ſome kinde of venemous filth, as when the ſeedy moyſture is kept in and putrifieth: Or menſtruall termes in weomen

longer retained than is their due courſe: or when any clodded bloud remaineth behind, and is not expelled: the vapour of theſe and ſuch like, infecting and decaying the ſpirits; bringeth ſometime Sincope: ſometime ſuffocation of the wombe: ſometime the falling ſickenes, and ſuch other miſchiefes, which greatly annoy the forces of nature. And thus diuerſly are the ſpiriets offended through diſtemperature.
               Againe, the ſubſtance of the ſpirits, and naturall forces is diminiſhed, ſometime euen of it ſelf (and as a man may ſpeak) voluntarily of his owne accord: for the ſubſtance being of it ſelfe thin and waſtable, and included in an hot thin and open body: Therefore of it ſelfe it diſſolueth &amp; vani
                     •
                  heth away. Sometime the ſame is decayed by occaſion of outwarde and euident cauſes, as are namely theſe: The aire which compaſſeth vs round: hot and dry, immoderate euacuations: vehement motion: affects of the minde: paines, watchinges, great emptines, and all vnprofitable excrements: which cannot but carry with them from the body as they paſſe, a great quantity or portion of the vitall ſpirits: ſeeing their ſubſtance is ſpread ouer the whole body, and alſo flowing with other humidities: whereby it commeth to paſſe, that whether the belly be very laxitiue by nature, or by medecin: or that the

vrine bee made immoderately as in the infirmity called Diabete: or that matter or water go plentifully forth of the breſt, ſtomack, bel
                  
                     •
                  y, or any great apoſtumation: thereby of neceſſity the forces of nature muſt be mightely decayed. Much more manifeſtly muſt it ſo fall out, when there is any great euacuation of bloud, or good humors, whether the ſame pas forth of a wound, the noſe, hemorroids, Piles, belly, or other place. In like maner abſtinence which taketh away from the body needefull nouriſhment, enfeebleth nature. Labor likewiſe and heat diſperſeth the ſubſtance of the ſpirits by vapors &amp; ſweat: And therfore they which liue continually in labor about furnaces, &amp; hot baths, becauſe daily ſome of their ſubſtance decayeth: doo not commonly ſo abound with excrements, as thoſe that leade a ſlouthfull delicate and idle life.
               Moreouer they that liue very incontinently, haue alſo for the moſt part very enfeebled bodies, able almoſt to abideno Phiſick; &amp; by a continuall decay of ſeedy moyſtures, they haue their ſpirits mightely conſumed: wherof look before in the 8. cap. Fig. 17. Great ach &amp; paine worketh the ſame effect, more than labour doth. Alſo of paſſions of the mind, ſome ſuffocate the ſpirites and inwarde heate, as namely feare and ſorrowe: ſome waſt and ſpread them abroade, as mirth and gladnes.

Theſe are the cauſes, which being in exceiſe, do waſt &amp; conſume inward heat, the ſpirites of life &amp; ſtrength of the bodie: which being ſo apparant as they are, may be vnto vs aſſured markes &amp; ſignes, wherby to know, whether the forces of nature haue yet loſt, or do ſtill retaine their powers, vertue &amp; ſtrength.
               Thoſe cauſes which onely oppreſſe the ſtrength of the bodie are inward &amp; hidden, &amp; not ſo know en vnto vs, as the forſaid: and they are theſe: obſtructions, &amp; immoderate abundance of humors which ſtop the veines &amp; arteries, becauſe they are thick, groſſe, and ſlow humors: by meanes wherof they keepe in the ſpirits, &amp; do not ſuffer them to be cooled, as it were, by any kinde of winnowing: whereby the vſe of the ſpirits is taken away: their vertues are oppreſſed, and grieuouſly with the inward heat offended: which matter verie oft faleth out ſo in the Lungs, Liuer, celles of the braine, in the arteries: finally, in the verie habite of the bodie.
               Obſtruction cauſed of too much abundāce of humors, doth grieue, oppreſſe, &amp; ſomtime ouercome the inward heat and ſpirites of life. Fulnes alſo proceeding from any obſtruction: if the repletion be ſimple, or ſomewhat part-taking with that called Cacochymia: it choketh bodily ſtrength, as for example: Abundance of bloud in a wraſtler: Flewine

in Leucophlegmatica. i. the third kind of dropſie: cruditie of humors in the other dropſie: abundance of choler in the yellow Iaundies. As often therefore, as the powers of nature are deſcried to be weak by the excrements: the ſpirites of life by the pulſe, &amp; breathing: the animall facultie by her proper functions; and by any of the foreſaide vehement cauſes preceeding: wee may determine the ſpirites of nature to be empaired. VVhen none of theſe cauſes haue gone before, and that yet the bodily ſtrength appeareth weake: then iudge them to be onely wronged or oppreſſed: Specially, if there do concurre ſignes of pure and ſimple repletion, or of great corruption of wicked humors: the cauſes greeuing and oppreſsing the ſpirites of nature being remoued: preſently their ſtrength is recouered, and they come againe vnto themſelues, except they be beaten downe with the continuance of their oppreſsion. Here therefore I make three ſteppes or degrees of naturall ſtrength weakely affected: either the ſame is a little throwen downe, or ouercharged, or thirdly, altogether weakened: whoſe particuler tokēs apeare by that which hath beene ſaid in the premiſſes.
               There are ſome which only marke the pulſes as an infallible ſigne, to iudge the bodily ſtrength by, which in trueth, is a great marke:

but yet not alone ſufficiēt, being both doutfull and vnconſtant: and alſo becauſe it is troubled with diuers outward things, is oftē
                  times changed. Againe, euacuation too aboundant, affecteth not onely the vitall ſpirites, but alſo in like manner, the other faculties of nature: whoſe decay bringeth death as aſſuredly, as if the vitall power were extinguiſhed: and therefore in euacuation it is requiſite, aſwell to marke and obſerue the other faculties of nature, as the vital powers. For if the pacient be ſicke of a vehement &amp; continuall diſeaſe, as of Lienteria. i. a fluxe of the ſtomacke, or Atrophia. i. a kind of conſumption, or Maraſmus. i. the endes of the feuer Hectike: let him not bloud; albeit the pulſe be mightie &amp; full. And therefore I conclude this Chapter: affirming that we are in euacuation to conſider the ablenes and ſtrength, not of one only, but of all the three aboue-ſaid, running or flowing faculties of nature. Neither to conſider of theſe alone, but alſo of the ſetled faculties, in which is conteined the action of life.
            
            
               To knowe by the greatnes of the diſeaſe, &amp; the ſtrength of the naturall powers: the quantitie of bloud that muſt be withdrawen. Chap. 14.
               THe knowledge of the quantitie in euery remedie▪ is the hardeſt matter in al Phiſicke,

and moſt of all troubleth the carefull and wiſe Phiſition. And although to knowe the quantitie be but a coniecturall knowledge: yet the ſame is ioyned with leſſe danger, and is more ſecure here than the knowledge of the quantitie in a purgatiue receit. The reaſon is, becauſe wee may ſtoppe the bloud when wee will, as Galen witneſſeth 2. de ration. virt. in acutis Commen. 11. &amp; lib. de curandi rat

Neither is it in our power, when it is once in the bellie, to take away any part thereof: or, if neede be, to adde vnto it: VVhich in bleeding wee may do: and therefore leſſe danger is in this, than in the other.
               The quantitie of the bloud that muſt be extracted, is knowen by the ſtrength of the patient: and chiefely by his pulſe. Therefore while he bleedeth, let the Phiebotomer or Phiſition ſeele the Pulſeis with his hand: and ſuffer the bloud to paſſe, according to the alteration of the ſame: eſpecially, when any great euacuation (as euen vnto Syncope) is to be made: Leſt it fall out vnwares, that death it ſelfe doe come in the place of ſowning or fainting.
               And except neceſsitie doe greatlye vrge, it is beſt and ſafeſt to abſtaine from

ſuch plentifull euacuation after Galens councell, lib. de Cura rat. per ſang. miſsionem. Chap. 12.
               
               If at any time, the powers of nature being weake, the diſeaſe require ſome plentifull bleeding: it is good to deuide the ſame, to open a veine twiſe or thriſe, and at eache time to detract a little bloud, as ye haue partly heard before: and as it ſhall be ſhewed more at large hereafter. All ſickneſſe decayeth the ſtrength of nature, and ſo doth in like manner that euacuation, which is vſed to helpe nature. Leſt therefore it might ſeeme a verie hard dealing in this caſe, more grieuouſly to afflict one alreadie afflicted, and preſently grieued: the matter is ſo to be ordered, as the ſubſtance of the diſeaſe may be remoued, the forces of nature as little damnified as may be. Yea, it is a principall poynt in a skilfull practiſioner, ſo to worke, that the euill may be remedied, and the patient brought in hope of a more profitable recouerie for his health, than his former Phiſick hath been painful vnto him. Thoſe hurts which the naturall vertues ſuſtaine, by a moderate euacuation are but ſmall: and theſe are againe quieted, when the euaacuation is accompliſhed: for nature now freede of thoſe hurtfull humors, wherewith ſhee was before preſſed down, recouereth her former ſtrēgth,

Shee renueth that which was drawen from the inward heat and ſpirites, and become almoſt the conquerour of the diſeaſe. Shee ouercometh wholly at length, yea, that which remained behind: partly by inward concoction, and partly by outward diſsipation. It wiſe Hippo councelled to giue a ſmall dyet to the ſick patient, not fearing thereby more and more to weaken the ſtrength of nature, which was otherwiſe but weake: let vs ſo eſteeme of euacuation. But as in dyet, ſo in euacuation we muſt beware, leſt the vertues of nature extremely enfeebled, do quite giue ouer, and be altogether extinguiſhed: in regard whereof, we are circumſpectly to foreſee, how farre the patient can or may endure the ſame. For (in truth) a iuſt quantitie withdrawen without any great hurt, taketh away and cureth the diſeaſe. And this point of the iuſt quantitie is knowen, by a compariſon of the diſeaſe, and of the ſtrength of nature: for perſons firme and ſtrong may bleed as much as the ſicknes requireth: They that are not ſo ſtrong, may bleede leſſe: they that are quite caſt downe, are not to bleede at all.
               And here a profitable queſtion may be moued: whether naturall ſtrength may ſo greatly be enfeebled, that it cannot or may not away with any euacuation be it neuer ſo little. VVee ſee many times, that in great

of decayd ſtrength, there fall out voluntarie euacuations, which do much good, and procure health. And againe, it ſeemeth, that to ech diminution of ſtrength (be the ſame great or ſmal) the quantitie of the euacuation may be proportionated accordingly. Neither is it credible, that an vnce or half an vnce 
                     ••
                  blod taken, can doe no great hurt to the naturall vertues, albeit they bee alreadie much decayed. Theſe matters ſeeme ſomewhat obſcure: but that the queſtion may be explaned, and all ambiguities of auncient writers taken out of the way: we anſwere by diſtinction: affirming, that there are three degrees of quantitie in euacuation. The firſt degree is, when the ſame euacuation is thorow perfect and abſolute, taking away either all, or the greateſt part of the matter that cauſeth or continueth the diſeaſe. The ſecond degree is a profitable euacuation, but not ſo perfect and abſolute as the other: which taketh away onely ſome part of the ſicknes, making that which remaineth more eaſie and tollerable than it was before. The third ſtep is ſo ſmall &amp; little an euacuation, that the pacient therby is not one whit eaſed or relieued. Now to come to aunſwere the former queſtion: the naturall ſtrength is ſeldome ſo greatly deiected, except the ſame be altogether ouercom &amp; paſt all hope of recouerie, but that it may

abyde ſome little euacuation.
               But hereof the auncient writers haue made no mention at all, being, as it were, a matter altogether vnprofitable, ſeeing it is ſo little: not procuring reilefe to the 
                     ••
                  cke patient, but rather bringing more daunger to t
                     ••
                   naturall forces aire die decayed. And in fi
                     •
                  e, they haue decreede and ſet downe, that in this caſe no euacuation ſhould be vſed. Therefore, the naturall powers being firme and ſtrong, require an abſolute and perfect euacuation: The ſame but meane and ſomewhat enfeebled; an euacuation more vnperfect and yet profitable: altogether decayed; they require none at all.
               If the diſeaſe be verievehement, ſo that it cannot, either at all, or well be cured without bleeding: it requireth neceſſarily abundant euacuation: The ſame but meane, and not ſowehement; it requireth a more moderate bleeding: but yet the ſame greatly profitable, becauſe the cure may afterwardes be accompliſhed with the more celeritie and ſafetie. If the diſeaſe be ſmall, it requireth ſmall euacuation or none at all.
               Now let vs make compariſon of the greatnes of the diſeaſe, and firmeneſſe of the ſtrength together. VVhen the ſtrength is verie firme, and the diſeaſe meane, and not

verie vehement: bleeding is not altogether neceſſarie, but onely profitable, in which caſe, bloud may be ſafely taken, and as much as the diſeaſe needeth. There is no feare to diminiſh a little the bodily forces; ſo as the roote of the diſeaſe may be pulled vp. For they are againe verie ſpeedily and redily recouered.
               VVhen the ſtrength is firme and the diſeaſe daungerous, repleniſhing the veines with an immoderate fuldeſſe, as it falleth out in the bodily conſtitution of wreſtlers, and in feuers called Synochi: a plentifull euacuation is to be appointed, anſwerable to the greatnes of the diſeaſe. Yea, it profiteth (ſayeth Hippo to bleede euen vnto Syncope, If the patient maye abide it: in which place Hippocrates meaneth not that ſowning which commeth of feare or of cowardlineſſe, or of ſharpneſſe of humors, pricking and prouoking the mouth of the ſtomacke: but onely that which commeth of abundant euacuation. For ſo in an extreame diſeaſe Hippo. appointed as a rule and iuſt order of euacuation. And this defect of minde and ſtrength is called Lipothymiae, or Lipoſychia: in which the partie ſpeaketh, heareth, ſeeth, and knoweth them that are preſent.
               
                  
Nowe, Syncope, is (as it were) a ſuddeine decay of all naturall ſtrength, as in the falling ſicknes: in the which the patient neither ſeeeth, heareth, or doth any outwarde action. Lipothymia is more eaſie than Syncope, and accuſtomably goeth before the ſame. In the foreſaide affectes therefore, wee let bloud euen vntil Lipothymia come vpon vs: and yet raſhly or without iudgement.
               Now when the powers of nature begin to quaile and giue ouer through euacuation, we muſt ſtay the bloud. Neither are wee to proceede ſo farre as vnto Sincope: for then the partie eſcapeth but daungerouſly: albeit the ſtrength of the body be reaſonably firme. In conſideration whereof, wee are to withdrawe the abounding humor, as the bodily forces will permit. And whenſoeuer they are waſted, albeit ſome of the offending humor remaine ſtill behinde: yet wee are preſently to deſiſt: and this ſhalt thou moſt certainly vnderſtand, if thou diligently marke and obſerue the Pulſies, how they alter from great to little: from equall to vnequall: from ſtrong to weake: from apparant to obſcure: and by marking how the force of the fluxe of bloud beginneth to relent, and the patient to waxe weake.
               That practiſioner which ſetteth by his credite, and will auoide ill ſpeaches, muſt

neuer through bleeding, bring his Patient to Syncope: becauſe the ſame being, as it were, an image of death, terrifieth the ſtanders by, and putteth the Patient in a great hazarde of his lyfe. Yea, and it is better to let the patient ſtill remaine in griefe, than to take away with the diſeaſe, life it ſelfe.
               And hetherto we haue ſhewed, what is to bee done, touching the quantitie that muſt be withdrawen, when the powers of nature are firme and conſtant.
               If the diſeaſe be but meane, and the bodily powers but indifferent, the euacuation muſt be moderated, which may remoue the whole cauſe of the ſickneſſe with little or ſmall hurt to the ſtrength of nature.
               VVhich albeit, it be but a ſmall and moderate bleeding: yet the ſame is verie profitable, as ye haue heard before. If a great ſickneſſe concurre with ſtrength alreadie decayed, and that the ſame alſo require ſome large euacuation: yet becauſe the powers of nature cannot tollerate it, the ſame muſt not be done wholy at one time: but by iteration, as yee haue beene tolde: leſt wee take away both the diſeaſe and the partie diſeaſed: Natures forces being quite ouerthrowen, albeit the diſeaſe ſo require: yet the bodie can permit little or no euacuation:

for it is vnprofitable and ſuperfluous, not bringing any commodity, but diſcommoditie and perturbation to the ſicke. Therfore in this caſe this muſt be the practiſe: moderately and often to giue the patient meates of good iuice and nouriſhment, to confirm, ſtrengthen, and recouer nature: and ſuch as haue ſome vertue in them a proprietate againſt the preſent infirmitie, &amp; may redreſſe the inward corruption of humors. And whē thus the naturall forces ſhall be recouered, Phlebotomy may ſucceed. And this practiſe is much vſed in continual and long ſickneſſes, in ſharp diſeaſes, called morbi acuti: this long ſtay were doubtfull and dangerous.
            
            
               An obſeruation of things preſent &amp; paſt, and alſo a foreſight of things future: needful &amp; neceſſarie to the further knowledge of the quā
                  titie of bloud that muſt be taken. Chap. 15.
               OBſeruations of euident cauſes, touching the greatnes of the diſeaſe &amp; conſtancy of naturall forces, doth greatly further our knowledge in this behalfe. Of which euident cauſes, three of them are in ward and bred in our ſelues, as namely, the temperament, the complexion, &amp; the age: &amp; three of them are outward and accidentall: namely, the cō
                  ſtitution of the aire, according to the ſeueral ſeaſons of the year, the ſituation of the countrie &amp; ſtate of the heauēs. All which are included

in one cauſe, as groūded al vpon one reaſon: ſecōdly, former euacuatiōs, ether ſlaid or immoderatly flowing▪ thirdly cuſtome &amp; order in diet &amp; life, or kind of euacuations proceding. By knowledge of theſe forepaſſed cauſes, we may atteine to the vnderſtanding of the ſtrength both of nature &amp; of the diſeaſe: &amp; ſo conſequently of the quantity that wee muſt bleed: &amp; albeit that the cauſes preſent &amp; future haue not yet altered, either the diſeaſe, or ſtrēgth of nature: yet for aſmuch as they begin to diſſolue ſome humours frō the body, &amp; to waſt the ſtrength of nature, they haue ſome moment in this practiſe. For what theſe cauſes preſent or paſt can doo, ye haue heard in the 8. &amp;. 14. chap. to the which I refer you cōcerning the perticulars: here onely being contented to rekon thē vp by name 
                     〈◊〉
                   the tēperamēt: the ſtate of the body: the age: the countrietthe time of the year: the diſpoſition of the aire &amp; ſky: voluntary euacuatiōs, cuſtom, &amp; the reſt, as appeareth ca. 8, It is the part &amp; property of a wife &amp; ſkilful phiſition, to conſider not only the ſtate preſent of the natural vertues: but alſo to foreſee what will be their ſtate in time to come after bleeding. The natural powers after euacuation, are ſo to be conſerued, as that the ſame may be able afterwardes to take other helps &amp; continue out the prolixity of a cōtinuing di

Yea, we muſt reteine alwaies ſome bloud for future fits, and courſes of the diſeaſe which are yet to come. Leſt afterwards vrged thervnto, wee begin vnfitly, and out of due time againe to nouriſh the ſame. And this chiefly is to be done in bleeding, for corrupted and putrifying feuers, whoſe putrifaction &amp; obſtruction is not taken away by bleeding: but the putrifaction is afterwardes the better ouercome, by the ſtrong force of nature, when by opening of a veine, ſhee is ſomewhat relieued. Therefore to this purpoſe alwaies ſome bloud muſt be left for natures preſeruation, as Galen councelleth. lib 11. method. cap. 14.
               
               We may coniecture the future ſtrength of the patiēt, partly by the preſēt cauſes, which are alſo afterwards like to continue, &amp; partly by accidents, which may happen contrary to our opiniō. Among preſent cauſes theſe are the chiefe: the ſtate of the heauens, &amp; the order of mans life. If the conſtitution of the aire hath bene hot &amp; dry, &amp; is like ſo to cōtinue, the bleeding muſt be leſſe, than if wee ſuppoſe a cold aire to enſue. Again if we perceaue, that the patient will liue ſparingly, &amp; 
                     •
                  ēperatly, either for want of appetite, or becauſe the diſeaſe will not ſuffer him to feed: as in Augina the Quincie: which ſhutteth vp the Iawes: we are to take leſſe bloud, than

whē we ſee he wil liue more frankly and liberallie. In theſe caſes we muſt ſtill reſerue ſome bloud, as natures treaſure, to helpe at a pinch in time of neede.
               Suddaine accidentes and vnlooked for which greatly enfeeble natural ſtrength, are theſe, great paine and ach, watchinge voluntarie euacuations: and chiefly Sinc

                  ke of nature, or ſtrucken with ſome great feare, or becauſe the mouth of the ſtomake fi
                     ••
                  ed with bitter choler, is becom very vnſenſible and weake. When we ſuppoſe that ſome of theſe matters wil fall out: albeit the ſtrength be firme, yet no blood at all, or very litle is to be withdrawen: except by art wee naue preuented the former accidents. It is (I ſay) great wiſedome to foreſee a farre off, 
                     〈◊〉
                   beware of ſuch ſuddaine and vnlooked for accidents.
               This we will manifeſt by an example. Let the pacient be of a ſanguine complexion, of body, thicke and well ſet, of a floriſhing age, that hath long time led a leacherous life, feeding plentifully of good meats, and that hath omitted his accuſtomed exerciſes▪ and liued at home idely: in whom alſo accuſtomed eruptions of bloud, out of the noſe,

belly, or Hemo
                     •
                  roids are ſta
                     •
                  ed: ſo that by concourſe of theſe cauſes, the body hath greatly encreaſed or waxed, &amp; that the large veines through repletion, are greatly filled. Whē ſoeuer a ſtrong ague, or great inflammation, ſhall poſſeſſe ſuch a patient, preſently he muſt be let bloud, and that plétifully: Both the greatnes of the diſeaſe, and of the cauſe requiring the ſame. Moreouer this is confirmed by obſeruation of thinges paſt, if preſent cauſes agree to theſe, namely, that there bee a ſit temperature of aire, by occaſion of the countrie, ſeaſon of the yeare, and the preſent ſtate of the weather, moderatly cold and moiſt: and that the patient bee apt to euacuation: alſo that the ſickneſſe bee not like to continue long after, neither apparant ſignification of an exceſſiuely hot temperature of aire to come, no thveatning of future paine, or of abſtinence, watchinges, voluntarie euacuations: If all theſe thus agree together, who may doubt but that a large euacuation may in this caſe bee made: And none at all, when the con
                     •
                  raryes doo appeare. Sometime theſe obſeruations, are mingled among themſelues, and contrary to themſelues: In which confuſion a wiſe iudgement is needfull, by compariſon of them to preſcribe the iuſt quantitie of euacuation.
               
                  
The conſideration of paſſed matters many times perſwade a plentifull bleeding, which the obſeruation of things preſent by and by taketh away: As for example, if the Patient laying aſide his accuſtomed exerciſe, giue himſelfe to pleaſure and idlenes, ſtuffing himſelfe withmeats, and hauing ſome notable euacuation ſtaied in him: but his body is waxed fat, white of colour, looſe, open, ſoft, full of thiniuce, and that it be Summer, a hot &amp; dry country, a hot &amp; dry conſtitution of weather without ſtormes: In this caſe, let not bloud at all, for ſufficient is already euacuated from ſuch a body of it ſelfe, and that not obſcurely, but apparantly. In this foreſaid conſtitution, thou maiſt detract a little bloud, if it bee winter, in a cold country, and the wind▪ ſtanding at North: and in this mixture of things, thou muſt marke not onely the multitude of the obſeruations, but the force of them: Becauſe one many times exceedeth all the reſt in power and ſway, and he that can neither by art, experience, nor ſound iudgement define the quantity of euacuation, according to the aduiſe of Hyppocrates, let him rather euacuate leſſe, than more than needeth.
               In this place albeit ſomewhat hath beene ſpoken before to the ſame purpoſe, cap. 9. Fig. 7. It may be profitably demaunded, whether being with child, be to be accounted among

theſe obſeruations heere handled, ſhewe of truth, and ſome probability may be alleaged, that when women with childe are grieuouſly ſicke, we are not to let them bloud, becauſe of the young that is in the wombe. This is alſo defended by Hyppocrates ſaying, Mulier in vtero geſtans abortit, inciſa vena: idque magis, ſi faetus auctior fuerit, that is, A woman with child is deliuered before her time if ſhee bee let bloud, ſpecially if the young be much increaſed, and growen in the wombe. But this of Hyppocrates is not alwaies true, as neither that which hee ſetteth downe a little before, Mulierem in vtero gerentem acuto morbo corripi: Lethale eſt. That is, it is deadly for a woman with child to be taken with a ſharpe diſeaſe. For ſeeing a purgation made of wicked and venemous ſimples, ſtandeth with greater danger of the childe than opening of a veyne, and that Hyppocrates graunteth that women with child wexed with a diſeaſe cauſed of corruption of ill humors, may bee purged in the moneths betweene the third and the eighth moneth; truely with much more ſafety may we let thoſe bloud, being grieued with any ſicknes cauſed of Repletion. And if in the middle time of the going with childe, the ſame may bee done: Much rather in the beginning when the bloud more aboundeth, and the yong needeth leſſe nouriſhment.
               
                  
Againe, if women being with child, nature of her ſelfe oftentimes attempteth euacuation of that which is ſuperſluous (with great profit) out of the noſe, by the hemorroids &amp; belly, and that ſometime the Termes flowe healthfully at times appointed: why vpon great neceſſity may we not imitate nature in our Art? Yea, many women bring vntimely fruit except about the fourth moneth a veyne be opened, the young fruit beeing ouercome with plenitude of the Patient, neither onely in fulnes, but without the ſame a veyn is opened in the arme of a woman with child, when need conſtraineth, as in a Plureſie, or other vehement inflammation. It is dangerous in deede to open any of the lower veynes in women with child, becauſe the fluxe turned downewarde, the termes would flowe, and ſo the fruit in the wombe bee deiected and caſt downe. A veyne is opened very ſeldome in the eighth or nine moneth without cauſing of vntimely birth, foraſmuch as then a woman of euery light cauſe receiueth hurt, and is deliuered before her time, through the weakenes and ſlipperines of the wombe. In this caſe Cornelius Celſu
                        •
                     
                   only conſidered the greatnes of the diſeaſe, and ablenes of the ſtrength. Olde Phiſitions▪ (ſaith hee) were of opinion that the firſt and latter age could not brooke bleeding, and that a woman with child cured

by Phlebotomy ſhould bring foorth vntimely fruit: yet experience prooued afterward that none of theſe were perpetuall, but that better obſeruations wer to be conſidered, which the Phiſition is to remember: For the matter is not great what the age bee, or what a woman beareth in hir wombe, but what her ſtrength is: a fierce childe: a ſtrong olde man: a luſty ſanguine woman with child, may ſafely bleede. And thus you ſee howe a great belly in a woman may be an obſeruation concerning the quantity of bloud that muſt bee withdrawen.
               Another obſeruation to finde out the iuſt quantite, is to marke the alteration of colour in the bloud. So iudged Hyppocrates in Pleuritide ſecundo de ratione virtus in acutis Commen. 10. where hee counſelleth to let bloud if the paine in a Plureſie aſcend to the arme, or the Paps ſo long till the bloud came forth in colour more red or more yeallow: or for pure and red bloud, blacke and blewe, which both doo happen. For bloud in an inflammation▪ differeth in colour from the naturall bloud, as more heated and inflamed. If the naturall bloud before in the body were crude and vndigeſted bloud, that which is in the inflamed place, is a great deale redder and yeallower, if it were before redde through aduſtion, it becommeth now more ſwart and blacke: But if

                  ings are more weake, than in the middle eſtate: for then all things are moſt firme and ſtrong. Againe, why he ſhould ſtay for concoction in bleeding, I ſee no reaſon, for as much as bloud of his owne nature is alwaies concocted, and a veyne beeing opened it floweth out eaſily of his owne accorde. Againe, where Auicen in his reaſons ſaith, that by bleeding in the beginning, that corrupted bloud is not euacuated that ſhould be, which afterward puts ſtill the Patient to more pain, ſo that wee are forced oftentimes, after wee haue let bloud in the beginning of a ſicknes, to take medicines purpoſely to aſſwage dolors and paine: I perceiue not how bleeding can take the good and leaue the bad, ſeeing nature alwaies reſerueth to it ſelfe as a friend good humors, &amp; good bloud, reiecting thoſe

that are naught and vnprofitable. Alſo when he ſaith it attenuateth the humors, hee is contrary to himſelfe, for in quarta primi, cap. 4. he iudgeth rather bleeding to make humors thicke, than thin: The bloud and ſpirits themſelues which attenuate the humors by bleeding being withdrawen. Againe, this is wonderfull, that when the ſtate of the diſeaſe is paſt, and the Patient paſt danger, that he would haue then the miſerable Patient with a new wound and cutting of a veyne againe tormented.
               If any thinke Auicen to be blameles, as being of this iudgement, that a veyne is to be opened when nature hath attempted Criſin, that is, the iudgement of the diſeaſe: which fall
                     •
                  th out to bee vnperfect and litle, not able to doo the feat and accompliſh the whole force, neither doth this defende him: For by what reaſon would yee haue bleeding to euacuate the matter left behind of an vnperfect Criſis: The naturall vertue being made ſo weake by that time with continuall contending and ſtriuing with the diſeaſe: that it can doo no good or very little in the cure, and eſpecially when the reſt of that matter is daily vſed to be eaſily euacuated by purgations. In ſharp &amp; dangerous ſickneſſes therfore, euery one ſeeth here Auicens error: for in theſe ſharp, vehement, &amp; continuall diſeaſes, we muſt bleede or be purged the firſt day: ye
                     •
                  , ſtay in theſe, is very dangerous, as Hyppo. ſaith,

                  4. Aphoriſ. Aphoriſ. 10. If Auicen meant it of Morbi ſalubres. i. recouerable diſeaſes: in theſe truely neither firſt nor laſt, nor at any time are we to bleed: for then moſt vſually we let bloud when a diſeaſe is vehement and dangerous.
               The opinion of other ſome in this place is to be 
                     •
                  aughed at, who thinketh that Auicen admoniſheth not to bleede at the beginning in ſickneſſes not dangerous, as in a tertian, becauſe nature is terrefied by the newnes and ſodainnes of the diſeaſe: and theſe make, or imagine nature to be a thing indued with knowledge, or an vnderſtanding and knowing faculty: which is not ſo. But if nature be made afraide in ſickeneſſes not perillous, how much more will ſhe be afraide in daungerous diſeaſes, in which not withſtanding, wee haſten to let bloud euen at the very firſt. Theſe matters therefore are full of error.
               Let this therefore bee the concluſion, that wee muſt bleede in the beginning of ſickeneſſes. VVherevpon Galen counſelleth (the diſeaſe being come) to open a veyne, lib. de Curand. ratio per ſang. miſſio. cap. 9. &amp; cap. 12. If (faith hee) there bee repletion of hot boyling bloud, whereby a ſtrong ague is inflamed: preſently euacuat, yea, euen vnto ſowning: yet ſtill regarding the ſtrength of nature. And this is his aduiſe prim. Aphoriſ. Aphoriſ. 23. VVhat diſeaſes ſo euer are cauſed of plenitude, or other corruption of humors in the veynes; they

are at the beginning to bee cured by bleeding: for by this meanes, the diſeaſe likely to grow is kept backe, and ſo much as is already bred, nature will eaſily ſubdue: Thus hot Agues before they are yet inflamed with heate of boyling bloud, or by vehement putrifaction, are &amp; may bee cured. Alſo inward inflammations at the firſt, as long as the flowing humor cleaueth not to the member, but followeth the bloud may be cured. The ſaid humor iſſuing forth with the bloud, when a veyne is once opened, ſtrength at the beginning is firme and conſtant in the Patient, almoſt like vnto vs that are well in health: If therefore at any time bleeding bee needefull, the ſame may beſt be done at the beginning: he that in fulnes of bloud, or fluxe of matter, will ſtay from bleeding, and vſe other helps, in a peruerſe order of healing, he doubleth the griefe, and troubleth the forces of nature more than is conuenient: Yea, let the veyne ſo timely bee opened, as the ſtomacke and firſt veynes be not firſt ſtuffed, with either corruption or cruditie of humors or meats vndigeſted.
               Thus you haue heard the former words of Auicen to be erronious, howſoeuer certain labor to ſalue them vp: yea, &amp; Auicen ſeemeth to vnderſtand his owne ſaying, not only of particuler diſeaſes in the members: but alſo of all other diſeaſes. For afterwards ſpeaking of all Feuers, and eſpecially of Febris fanguinea, Feuers cauſed

of bloud, hee counſelleth in them not to let bloud abundantly: except there haue gone before concoction, and concerning this reaſon, that humors are leſſened by bleeding, it cannot be ſo, for yee haue already heard, that both before bleeding and after, there is retained in the body one and the ſelfe ſame proportion of humors. If any difference or mutation happen, ſeeing the thin humor iſſueth foorth with the greateſt ſpeed, and the thick humor but ſlow: it is more likely, and probable, that opening of a veyne ſhould rather make the bloud and humors thicke than thin. A gaine, whereas he ſaith in his reaſon that the humors thereby are agitated, moued, and driuen through the whole body: how ſhould there bee this agitation of humors, ſeeing rather this practiſe abateth the multitude of them which was before the cauſe of perturbation &amp; ſickenes. In reaſon all things now ſhould become farre more quiet than before. VVhereas he ſaith the ill bloud is mixt in the veynes with the good, what inconuenience commeth thereof if a veyne bee opened? then no doubt the bad muſt paſſe foorth with the good. Put the caſe there bee a ſtrong or vehement ſickenes cauſed of abundance of bloud onely, as are both the Synochi Feuers, as is the putrified feuer, cauſed through plenitude, as are Angina, Pleuriſis, Peripneumonia, alſo inflammations of the Liuer and other partes. In theſe

if they bee great and dangerous through much abundance of bloud, who will not preſently open a veyne? who will not while ſtrength ſerueth, take away that fulnes which bringeth a diſeaſe and danger of death? Hereupon in Syno
                     
                        •
                     ha preſently at the firſt, we haſten to let bloud euen till the Patient faint, and before the matter putrifie. But Auicen in a ſanguine feuer at the firſt letteth bloud ſparingly, &amp; more plentifully afterwardes, when ſignes of concoction appeare. But what concoction doth hee looke for of good bloud, and already well concocted, and offending onely in quantity? In theſe ſanguine feuers therefore, euen as in very ſharpe ſickeneſſes, either to put off, or to ſtay bleeding it is very ill, as Hyppocrates ſaith, if the diſeaſe be not ſo ſharpe or vehement, yet let bloud at the beginning, according to the proportion of the fulnes. If wee ſhould in theſe ſtay with Auicen, till concoction (the beginning and ſtate of the diſeaſe) be paſt: wee ſhould ſuffer the diſeaſe to grow &amp; increaſe, and cauſe for want of skill the Patient to bee cruelly hand'ed and intreated without helpe of Phiſicke, which wee may adminiſter, if the diſeaſe be deadly, it will neuer be brought to concoction: If it be doubtfull, or recouerable called Morbus ſalutaris (as ye haue heard) after the ſtate in the declination, &amp; when the Patient is paſt daunger, what profit doth Phlebotomy then bring? as ye haue heard before.
               
                  
Nature by concoction, ſeparateth the ill humors frō the good: theſe to conſeruation: thoſe to expulſion. This ſhe doth either by her ſelf, or by the help of Phiſick. But opening of a veine, indifferently without choice, euacuateth al humors. VVherefore then in bleeding, ſhall wee tarrie for this concoctiō &amp; diuiſion of humors? as for example: In apoſtumations, if the corupted bloud be made matter or filth, it is not then taken away by bleeding, but by ſome other meanes. So in feuers, whoſe matter is conteined in the veines: when the humor is concoct &amp; diuided, we vſe not to withdraw the ſame by bleeding; but by ſome other practiſe in Phiſick: in which caſe, by that time that concoction is accompliſhed, wee ſhall haue nature to helpe vs, who ofher ſelfe, indeuoureth to expell humors concocted &amp; diuided, the bad from the good. And if nowe after concoction &amp; ſeparation of humors we open a veine, we do not onely euacuat the bad, but alſo the good: and that which is worſe; thoſe humors which are ſeparated by nature, we ſhal mingle with the pure bloud, de filing the ſame, &amp; ſo both confound all, &amp; diſturb the good worke of nature herſelf. Therfore, when the apparant ſignes of concoction ſhall appeare, the cure muſt be done, not any more by opening of a veine, but either by purgation, or ſome other help, to turne the matter aſide ſome other way, except (which ſometime

chanceth) there appeare ſignes of cruditie.

               But Auicens opinion, that in the beginning of a diſeaſe, a veine is not to be opened: ſeemeth to haue grounde out of Galen. Chap.

therefore, neither muſt the Phiſition, at the firſt: when all things are yet vnconcocted, attempt any euacuation, and ſo much the leſſe, becauſe crude and vndigeſted matter not yelding to euacuation: ſtirreth vp grieuous accidēts in the bodie. Galen. li. 1. Aphoriſ. Cōmen. 22
               
               Again, ſay ſome (in Auicens) defence, it may be that in the beginning of a ſicknes: opening of a veine maketh the ſuperfluities of the body thinne: ſo that they may flowe &amp; runne thorough out the whole body, and ſo be mingled with the good bloud, wherby it fortuneth that the ſame is not extracted, which neceſsitie requireth to be expelled. VVhereby alſo it happeneth further, that the patient muſt be let bloud againe, ſometime euen the ſame day, and ſometime the day after, which too much enfeebleth the powers of the bodie. And thus it is contended, partly by reaſon, partly by authoritie in the behalfe of Auicen. And ſurely, if the words of Auicen might be reſtringed, that verie ſeldome, and onely in the caſe limitted, a veine is not to be opened at the beginning of ſicknes: it may wel ſtand to ſenſe &amp; reaſon: but Fernelius &amp; others gather, that Auicens words were ſpoken more generally, than that he can by this ſpeciall caſe only, be defended. And becauſe the matter is controuerted, as ye ſee, I haue ſet downe the reaſons brought both againſt Auicen, and for him. Leauing the depth

of the controuerſie, to be examined &amp; diſcided by others, rather as yet inclining for my part: (for ought that I can ſee) to the aduerſarie 
                     •
                  p
                     •
                  
                  niō to Auicens, ſtil affirming it to be more viual a great deale, to open a veine in the beginning of ſicknes, than to ſtay a longer time.
               And that this aſſertion may the rather appeare to be true: I will ſet downe certeine ru
                     •
                  es whereby it may truely be manifeſted &amp; approued ſo by ſcience and experience. Firſt, when wicked humors greatly ſwel, being (as it were) excited &amp; ſtirred vp through repletion of their owne accord: they perſwade to euacuation at the beginning of the diſeaſe, when the humors are not yet concoct. For otherwiſe, the vnconſtant humor, mouing from place to place, and frō member to member without order, might make ſtay at ſome principall member, to the great hurt of the patient. It happeneth in deede but ſeldome, that the humors are moueable, &amp; flowing from one part to another: for cōmonly they remaine firme &amp; ſtable in one place.
               Secondly, a veine is to be opened in the beginning of a diſeaſe: when quantitie of matter aboundeth in the veines, as Galen ſaith, Com. 29. li. 2. Aphoriſ. Yea, in this caſe alſo ſomtime a purgation is taken, that nature may eaſily 
                     •
                  ō
                  coct &amp; ouercome the reſidue of the matter of the diſeaſe, when the ſame is leſſened by art.
               Thirdly, when the diſeaſe is great &amp; vehement,

as in verie dolorous apoſtumations: albeit there be not in the bodie much matter antecedent: yet the humor that is, is to be repelled, leſt the apoſtumation open and breake ſooner than is conuenient. To auoid therefore theſe gr
                     •
                  at &amp; euil accidents: by &amp; by, at the beginning inciſion is to be made: which Galen teacheth li. 13. Cap. 20. Method. Medend. in theſe words. In ſuch affects (ſaith he) a veine muſt be opened at the beginning; ſo that none of thoſe things hinder, which we haue ſpoken of. i. either the abundance of raw e humors: childiſh yeares: the time of the yeare: the temperature of the countrey, too hote or too cold. For not only in ſharp diſeaſes &amp; inflamations, but alſo in wounds &amp; bruſes of particular parts; ſpecialy being principall: bloud is to be taken from the contrarie part, to repell the inflamation: albeit the bloud be but little in quantitie.
               In the beginning of ſharpe diſeaſes called morbiacuti, or peracuti: opening of a veine is paſsing good. For the better vnderſtanding whereof, you muſt remember, that a ſharp diſeaſe is two-fold: either exquiſite &amp; throughly vehement, paſsing not the fourth daye, which is called of Phiſitions Malus peracutus. i. thoroughly ſharp: and of ſome perperacutus, imitating barbarous authors in Phiſick. The other not exquiſite or throughly ſharpe &amp; vehemēt, whoſe greateſt force wilbe in the ſeuenth day.

Theſe diſeaſes being but ſhort, &amp; at their extreame fits in few daies, without any truce, preſently at the beginning, theſe are to be cured. And becauſe they proceed chiefly of hot humours, namely, of bloud and yellow choler, therefore ſpecially they require bleeding. Whereupon Hippo. lib. 4. writeth. De vict. ratione in morbis acutis. Aphoriſ. 19. In acutis morbis ſanguinem detrahes: ſi vehemens morbus videatur, florueritque aegrotanti aet

                     er it robur. In ſharpe diſeaſes withdraw bloud, if the diſeaſe ſeeme vehement, if the age of the patient be floriſhing, and that the naturall forces be firme and ſtrong. Schola ſalerni hath theſe verſes of this very matter.

                  Not ſo when child or old men bleede:
                  the ſpring requires the aduantage.
               
               As there is regard to bee had of generall times, ſo there is alſo of perticular daies and times, in the which diſeaſes come, ſpeciallie in thoſe diſeaſes, which haue by

courſe an appointed and ſet time of intermiſſion and remiſſion. For euacuation is not to be made when the diſeaſe is now fierce, but when the ſame is aſſwaged. Feuer, sand eſpecially thoſe that are called intermittents, diſcontinuing agues, euē naturally at the beginning and their firſt inuaſion, cauſe vomits: and at the declining, ſweats. At which times wee may by art prouoke theſe, but in no caſe vſe purging or bleeding. In the time of the fit likewiſe wee muſt refraine from theſe, as thinges which nature then can not brooke. If ſuch accidents of bleeding, or of ſiege come, they are but accidental, and are cauſed only of the heat and force of the diſeaſe. No euacuation can be done ſafely in ſuch fits, ſeeing they do too exceedingly hurt the powers of nature. Alſo when the humours do ſo boile with heat, that they are perturbed &amp; mingled together, there can not be made by practiſe of art any iuſt diuiſion of the ſaid humours. And if it chaunce that the hurtful matter of the diſeaſe, be inflamed without the greater veines, &amp; that in a fit, a veine be opened: it is to be feared, leaſt preſētly the ſame corrupted matter paſſe into the empty veines, &amp; ſo of an intermitting feuer, wil come a continuall. Wheras a veine opened in the moſt quiet time of a diſeaſe, troubleth not nature, but without any feare of an inflammation, taketh the plenitude out of the greater

veines. The greateſt time of quietnes, is the time in the middle, betweene the remiſſion &amp; intermiſſiō of the diſeaſe. If the time between the fits bee much, it is an eaſy matter to perceiue the ſaid middle time. If the time bee but little, then is it far more hard to diſcerne the ſame. Becauſe many times no leaſure can bee graunted either before or after bleeding, by reaſon of the ſwift courſes of fits, to nouriſh the party. Thus you ſee Phlebotomy is not to be practiſed in the day of the fit of any ſicknes, which in Latine is called Criſis, or dies Criticus, in the which day, neither bleeding, nor any other euacuation is to be attēpted, leſt the matter ſhould be drawen from that place, wherevnto nature hath driuen it, to be rid or diſpatched thereof: and therfore like wiſe neither in the fit it ſelfe ought the ſame to bee done. Excellently therefore did Galen giue in charge, Comment. 29. lib. 2. Aphoriſ. that in time of the fit, neither bleeding nor purging ought to bee vſed, becauſe then the concoctiō of the diſeaſe is chiefly wrought. Which is farre better accō
                  pliſhed in quietnes and reſt, then in motion or diſturbance. For what reſpect the ſtate hath to the whole diſeaſe: that compariſon hath the 
                     •
                  itt to the daies of intermiſſion. As therefore in the ſtate of a diſeaſe no euacuation is to bee vſed: ſo neither in time of the fit.
               Againe, it may profitablie here bee admoniſhed

notwithſtāding the premiſſes: that bleding is not preſently to be vſed at the very beginning of a diſeas, whē we iudge the Criſis or iudgement ofthe ſicknes to bee yet far of
                     •
                  . For bloud beeing the foundation of inward heat, wherwith, the ſame is vpholden: (natural heat beeing ingendred of bloud, as of a materiall cauſe,) If bloud ſhould bee detracted at the beginning of a diſeaſe, the natural heat would bee diminiſhed, which ſhould concoct the materiall cauſe of the ſicknes. Whereby further it commeth to paſſe, that the diſeaſe is longer time protracted, and the forces of nature enfeebled, through which two, namely the continuance of the diſeaſe, and imbecillitie of nature: great feare of death commeth in the end: and this is the caſe, wherein Auicens former opinion may ſtand true.
               There is therfore no preſcribed day for certaine, appointed to let bloud in. Whereupon Galen tooke occaſion to deride thoſe: lib. de curand. ratio. per ſang. miſſio. cap. 12. which from the 2. houre of the day to the 5. or 6. houre onely did let bloud, and at none other time. And Galen witneſſeth ofhimſelfe, that he did let bloud at all times without any daunger, yea euen in the night. And 9. method. Cap. 5. hee affirmeth it beſt, which hee alſo him ſelfe obſcrued, to mark not the number of the daies, but onely the ſtrength of the

Patient, becauſe by experience wee haue prooued that not onely the ſixt or ſeuenth daies, but alſo in the daies following the ſixt or ſeuenth, a veine may bee opened. But becauſe as Galen witneſſeth, Libro de Curand. ratio. per ſanguin. miſſionem. Capit. 20. in diuers diſeaſes through continuance of time, the ſtrength of nature is greathe abated: Therefore the occaſion of letting of bloud is not omitted for the number of the daies, but for that the naturall ſtrength is waſted: So that if the vertues of the bodie ſeem to be conſumed the ſecond day from the beginning of a diſeaſe: euen then wee forbeare opening of a veine. And he thertoo the wordes of Galen.
               
               Now in diſeaſes which are cured by bleeding when they are preſent, or propelled being but future: if they grant leiſure ſo that a choice of an houre to bleede in May bee made: in this caſe (I ſay) the fore noone houre is better then the after noone. For from the ryſing of the Sunne the bloud is quickened, reuiued, and beareth rule in the body: yea in that time of the day it becommeth thin, cleere, &amp; apt to flow.

               There are 3. moneths belonging ſpecially to the Mone (as ſome ſay. viz. May, April, Septeber: in which there are alſo certaine daies which are not good to bleed in, as ſome authors (not contemptible in mine opinion) do

affirme: namely, the firſt of May, and the thirtieth of the two other moneths. This for all theſe ſayinges of wiſe Clarkes, is not alwaies ſo found: for euen in theſe daies, if other thinges agree, a veyne may be opened, which I my ſelfe haue done without hurt inſuing. In like caſe that is falſe, which is ſet downe by ſome, that: the eating of Gooſe on any the foreſaid e three daies, is perillous: which ſeemeth to bee taken from the cuſtome and ſuperſtition of the Iews. Men in their flouriſhing yeares of a ſanguine complexion, may bleede euery moneth of the yeare: if neceſſity vrge by occaſion of great dangerous ſickenes, and that bloud abound in the veynes. For in theſe, ſubſtance of humors is not eaſily waſted or diſperſed abroad. But for conſeruation of health: bleeding is beſt vſed, in one of theſe three moneths, Aprill, May, September. And yetnot all alike, for in Aprill, and May, the Lyuer veyne is to bee opened for abundance of bloud in the ſpring: and in September the veyne of the Milt, becauſe in harueſt Melancholly aboundeth more than any other humor, and I would wiſh perſons greatly ſubiect to diſeaſes, cauſed of fulnes of bloud, and that are cured by bleeding, to bleed theſe two times in the yeare: that is to ſay, from the Lyuer veyne on the right arme in the ſpring, and from the veyne of the Milt on the left arme in September. Thoſe that thinke that if they bee

let bloud one yeare they muſt be ſo euery yere: Shall herafter in the twenty foure Chapter bee ſhewed to the contrary: for as one ſwallowe makes not the ſpring: So Phlebotomy practiſed once or twiſe, doth not import an annuall bleeding, and ſo we muſt iudge of boxing.

               Of Astrologicall obſeruation in bleeding, and of an other obſeruation neerely aanexed vnto the ſame: ſhewing what members, and parts of the bodie are to bee opened according to the ſeuerall ſeaſons of the years.
               AStrologicall obſeruation of the newe and full of the Moone, and other conſiderations heere ſet downe as follow, are to bee regarded in light and ſmall ſickeneſſes: but not ſo, if the ſame bee vehement and dangerous. For the heauenly cauſes are very farre off, neither did Hyppocrates make reckoning of them 4. Aphoriſ. Aphoriſ. 10. The firſt day wee muſt helpe (ſaith he) in ſharpe diſeaſes. And Galen de Cura. ratio per ſanguin. miſſio. cap. 12. ſaith: that thoſe perſons are preſently to be euacuated, in whom appeareth abundance of hot bloud, before the ſame begot to ſome principall part (as ye heard before) ſo that theſe things are not to be obſerued in a vehemēt plureſie: In Angina the quincie: Inimmoderat flux of bloud: In great plenitude of the veſſels: neither in diſcōtinuing agues or feuers that come by fits. In which the time of reſt, remiſſion, &amp; ſtay, is farre better than the morning time: In which wee let bloud at what houre ſo euer it be, of the night or the day: if the fit be off, and other things anſwerable. Therefore I ſay in theſe, we are not ſtrictly to obſerue

theſe rules Aſtrologicall: obſerue them, as matters of ſome force, in healthfull Patients, which bleede onely for preſeruation, and in light▪ and ſmall infirmities: if then it happen that thou do bleede.
               To come to theſe Aſtrologicall obſeruations we are not to let bloud in the new or full of the moone: nor elſe except the moone bee in theſe ſignes ♈. ♋. and the firſt halfe of ♎. the laſt halfe of Scorpio, or in ♐. ♒. ♓. Alſo not in the day of the change, the day next before, or day next after: Nor when the ſigne is in the place where the inciſion ſhould be made.
               Another obſeruation is this, to open a veyne in flegmaticke perſons: when the ☽ is in ♈. ſauing in the heade. In a melancholly man, the moone beeing in the firſt halfe, or firſt fifteene degrees of ♎. except in the hips: or when the moone is in ♒. ſauing in the legs. In a chollerick body when the ☽ is in ♋. ſauing in the breaſt. The laſt halfe of Scorpio: except in the priuy members, or in ♓. ſauing in the feete. Sanguine men may bleed in any of the ſignes, ſo the ſign be not in that member.
               Againe, after the Mathematicke, this is the conſtellation or election of time. In fiery ſignes it is good for flegmaticke perſons to bleede, as in ♈. ♐. Leo is excepted being the houſe of the Sunne, in the which there muſt be no bleeding. In Airie Signes good for Melancholly men:

as ♎. ♒. ♊. is excepted, and the laſt ſeauenteene degrees of Libra, becauſe ♊. reſpecteth the hands and the armes, in which commonly wee let bloud.
               In watry ſignes, good for chollericke men, as in ♋. ♏. ♓. In earthly ſignes it is ill to bleed, as in ♉. ♍. ♑.
               The generall rules of Ptolome for Phlebotomy in 30. of Centiloquium is this: Tangere ferro membrum cum Luna in ſigno illius membrieſt periculoſum. It is daungerous to open a member with a chirurginal inſtrument, when the moone is in the ſigne belonging to that member. Good aſpectes in bleeding are theſe ♂. ☽. and ♃. alſo ☽. &amp; ♀. ſo as ♀. be not cōbuſt ■. ☽. &amp; ♃. ⚹. ☽. &amp; ♃. ⚹. ☽. &amp; ♀. △. ☽. &amp; ♃. △. ☽. &amp; ♀. △. &amp; ⚹. ☉. &amp; ♃. or ☽. alſo △. ☽. &amp; ♂. or ⚹. ☽. &amp; ♂.
               Againe this is an other obſeruation, from the new of the moone to the firſt quarter, for pueri, i. thoſe that are in their childhoode from the firſt quarter to the full: for Iuuenes: that is, young men from the full to the laſt quarter: for 
                     Ʋiri: that is, thoſe that are of mans ſtate, and begin to grow in yeares, and from that time to the new againe: for old growen folke: Looke more hereof in a Table hereafter following. 28. Chapter.
               Another obſeruation, how particuler members are to be taken, according to the particuler times and ſeaſons of the yeare, is this: In

the ſpring and ſummer time, the veynes of the right ſide of the body are to be opened: namely of the right hand, right arme, and right, foot. But in harueſt and in winter, the veynes of the left hande, arme, or foote. In the ſpring time, bloud increaſeth: In the Summer yeallow choler: therefore in the ſpring time, and in Summer, thoſe veynes are to be opened which moſt abound with bloud and yeallow choler: that is, ſpecially the right raines: for in the right part of the body is ſcituated the member cauſing bloud: that is, the Lyuer: and Choledochos the Cofer of yeallowecholer: that is, the gall. In harueſt is ingendred melancholly, which is not diſſolued, but increaſed in the winter: therfore in harueſt and winter, thoſe veynes muſt haue inciſion, in which melancholly chiefly raigneth: that is, the left veynes for the Spleene, thereceptacle of melācholly is placed on the left ſide. Moreouer, theſe foure members, the head, hart, feete, and Lyuer: are to be euacuated according to the foure ſeaſons. The heart in the ſpring: the Lyuer in Summer: the head in winter: the feete in harueſt: Of which matter you ſhall heare ſpeake, Schola Salerni,

               Preparation before bleeding. Chap. 18.
               AS occaſion of the time is to bee taken, ſo there muſt be vſed before, ſome preparation of the body. The neglecting whereof, would bring great hurt to the party; and ſurely, the chiefeſt preparation is this. To purge and cleanſe the members, that are in the firſt Region of the body: touching this preparation many things are to be regarded, whereof mention is made in the eighth Chapter, from whence I purpoſe to take foure principall conſiderations in this behalfe, being vrged thereto, for perſpicuity ſake: leauing the reſt to thine owne diſcretion to be ſcanned.
               There are therefore (as there wee did ſet downe) foure things eſpecially which ſtay and put backe bleeding: That is to ſay, firſt crudity of the ſtomacke and firſt veynes. Secondly, a filthy gathering together of hurtfull humors. Thirdly, the belly bound with dry and baked excrements. Fourthly, the mouth of the ſtomacke weake, and very ſenſible. Theſe doo not altogether put off bleeding, but ſtay the ſame for a while till by Art they may be withdrawen or remedied. If a veyne be opened, while cruditie

ruleth in the ſtomacke, this euill will follow: that many rawe, vnconcocted &amp; vndigeſted humors wilbe congeſted, &amp; gathered together in the place of bloud. In hardnes of the wombe this miſchiefe enſueth: that the Liuer &amp; exhauſted veines, ſuck out of the excrements, ſilthie iuices, &amp; vncleane ſubſtance: in regard whereof it is moſt conuenient, to ſtay ſo long as the rawe matter may be concocted, &amp; till the excremēts deſcend. And if they cannot vtter of themſelues, as ye heard, cap. 8. They are to be prouoked with ſuppoſitors or clyſters, and the womb is to be made laxatiue with prunes or Caſsia. Cruditie &amp; indigeſtion is knowen by the qualitie &amp; quantitie of meates receiued. Alſo by the time in which they were eaten, and alſo by ponderouſnes, &amp; raw belchings of the ſtomack. Againe, corrupt humors abounding in the ſtomack, or partes neare vnto it: whether the ſame be bred there, or that they proceede from the head, Liuer, or ſplene; they perſwade the putting off of bleeding, til they may be purged; els this corruptiō of humors drawen into the veins would be more daungerous to the bodie than cruditie it ſelf, and infect the veines, farre with much more vncleannes: whereof do come obſtructions or a conſumption, proceeding of the ill diſpoſition of the body: or the diſeaſes which we would cure, grow greater, &amp; their accidents 
                     ••
                  rre worſe: yea, and becauſe theſe corrupt humors

are ſtirred, they become more fierce and hurtfull, nipping the ſtomack, &amp; the parts called praecordia. i. the fleſhie skin called the Midriffe, which ſeparateth the heart &amp; lungs from the ſtomack, Liuer, &amp; other bowels: whereby is cauſed appetite to vomite, convulſions, Lypothimia, Syncope, and other fearſull accidents. The ſignes whereby to know, whether the bodily partes are poſſeſſed with corruption of humors are theſe: loathing of meat, aptnes to vomit, vomiting vp the noyſom &amp; offenſiue humor: oft going to the ſtoole: heauines &amp; paine in the ſtomack, fulnes &amp; ſwelling of the ſtomack &amp; precordial parts. If theſe apeare in the patient, without cruditie of meats: then are we to expell the offenſiue humors out of the firſt region of the body, which hath bin the cauſe of the foreſaid euils. If the humor of himſelf giue vpwards, aſſay the expulſion by vomit: drinking a draught either of warm water, or of Hydrelaeū
                   warmed, that is water mixt with oyle: wherof take the quantitic of halfe a pound. If the humor gine downward, expell it by ſiege. Caſsia is not ſtrong enough to purge the humor from the ſtomack, as not being ſufficiēt to expel by ſiege ſuch clammie &amp; cleauing humors. For Caſsia hath but a meane vertue, and that onely to aſſwage and mollifie. Rubarb, or Senna, or ſome other gentle medicine, according to the qualitie of the humor: and not ſo

vehement, as to moleſt the ſtate of the whole bodie. And theſe we may vſe, not once or twiſe but oftener if neede require. After all this preparation, then we are to let bloud.
               VVhen the corruption of humors is ſpread throughout all the bodie &amp; euery particular part, ſo that the whole body is vnpure: then we muſt obſerue this order: that is, we muſt purge euerie part orderly: as firſt, the greater veines: and this called Meſentericae venae which are branches of the great carrying veine called Porta, by which both the guttes are nouriſhed, and the iuice of meat concocted, is conueyed from the ſtomacke to the Liuer, to be made bloud. Yea, theſe veines are the ſecond time to be purged, before wee euacuate the whole habite of the bodie, and not contrarie: that is, from the firſt veines to the greater: and from them to bring the humor into the ſtate of the bodie: which were not to purge the noyſome humor, but to infect and hurt the whole bodie therewith. But this is the courſe: to drawe the humor from the habite of the bodie into the greater veines, from them into the firſt veins, and then to bring it into the bely. Yea, this great corruption of humors not onely ſtayeth bleeding for a time, but often times altogether. And therefore wee let not bloud in the dropſie, in Cacheria, in hard apoſtumations of the Liuer and ſplene.
               
                  
The third matter of the preparation before bleeding was aboue ſaid, to be either the ſenſibilitie or imbecillitie of the ſtomack. For thoſe perſons haue notable quick feeling, whoſe veins ſent from the brain, are ſoft, tender, open &amp; redie to occur and meete with any matter, ſo that theſe perſons without hurt cannot eate anye ſharpe, ſower or ſalt things, as vinegar, pepper, muſtard. Imbecilitie of the 
                     •
                  tomake proceedeth either of diſtemperature, or of a verie thinne placing and ſtanding of the ſmall veines in the ſame place. And this is knowen by loſſe ofappetite, when meat cannot abide in the ſtomack, but that there will be always paine ofthe ſtomack, &amp; a promptnes ſtill to vomit. Thoſe perſons that are thus affected, are troubled greatly euen with the haſard of life, of euerie ſmall occaſion: as faſting, anger, ſorrow, feare &amp; alſo by bleeding. Phlebotomy in theſe (I ſay) waſteth greatly the vitall ſpirits, &amp; greatly moueth the other humors of the bodie beſide the bloud, whereupon there befall to them when they haue bled, conuulſions, the falling euill, ſownings &amp; other feareful accidents, which are cauſed hereby. In ſuch therfore, we muſt haue a foreſight, &amp; corroborat the mouth of the ſtomacke with things repelling the ſharpnes &amp; influence of humors: as with iuice of a Pomegranate, a Quince, Malum medicum, with iuice of Citrons, Lymons, &amp; iuice of Barbaries, ſower

grages, viniger, or ſyrops made of theſe. If there be doubt of a cold diſtemperature, vſe hote aromatike things, chiefely ſyrop of Mynts, Diacydonion, ſower or ſharpe wine, or ypocras. Take a little of theſe wines, or a morſel of good bread dipt in them, and when the patient hath a little reſted vpon it: open a veine, and this is the preparation, if the diſeaſe permit it. A vehement diſeaſe 
                     •
                  aſteneth bleeding, and cannot ſtay for this preparation: as repletion in wraſtlers, in whom preſent ſuffocation, or breaking of veines is to be feared: as a great Pluriſie: a fernent agewe: a great fall or bruſe: In the which wee are more to feare the preſent danger of the diſeaſe, than the hurt by defect ofthe preparation. If we thinke the humors in the bodie to be thicke, and that they will not flow (for which cauſe alſo we vſe to walke before bleeding) wee may enter into a bath, to make the humors ſubtile: not the ſame daye, in which we bleede, but a day or two before: Not in the ſelfe ſame daye, becauſe it maketh the skin ſoft &amp; thinne, and ſo in the ſtroke, the skinne ſlippeth &amp; ſtarteth from the Phlebotomer, which is verie dangerous. For this cauſe alſo wee giue a little ſyrupus acetoſus certaine dayes before bleeding, to ſubtiliate the matter. And again, that the humors may paſſe with the more facilitie &amp; become ſubtile: to prepare thē to this purpoſe, we vſe frication of the mēber,

to rub the arme or other parts, &amp; the members next vnto the place that is to receiue inciſion. Alſo we giue before bleeding to ſuch perſons as haue weak &amp; ſenſible ſtomacks nipped with ſharpnes of choler, flowing to the mouth of the ſame, ſome portion of meat: yet not all meates with indifferencie, but meates of good digeſtion: as a morſell of bread dipt in Syrupus acetoſus, which comforteth the ſtomacke through the ponticitie, to vſe the old barbarous word the ſharpnes or 
                     •
                  owernes thereof: which alſo letteth the fluxe of humors, &amp; keepeth them back from the ſtomack, by reaſon of a certeine frigiditie. For as ſoone as choler ſloweth to the ſtomack, ſo ſoone by the ſharpnes hereof, the ſame is repreſſed &amp; repelled.
            
            
               What is to be done in the verie time of the inciſion. Chap. 19.
               THe pacient is to bleede lying in the greateſt quiet that he may, both of body &amp; of mind: eſpecially if the ſtrength of the bodie be infirme, &amp; that there be doubt of Sincope, let him ſit vp in his bed, &amp; lift vp his head aboue the pillowes: for while we ſtand or ſit, that facultie which beareth vp the bodie, is in a kinde of trauell, and the entrailes &amp; bowels hanging of the precordiall partes, do enforce the vitall &amp; natural powers. By lying therfore (ſpecially ſome what vpright) the bodily ſtrength is preſerued,

according to Galen. prima particula. prognoſticorum. And as dead bodies are layde forth vpon their backs: ſo the lying of ſicke and weake bodies, muſt be vpon their broadeſt part, which is the back. Againe, the back bone is the ſtronger part of the body, being acording to Auicen the foundation of the bodie, as the keele or bottome of a ſhip is the ground worke of all the ſhipwrights labor.
               If the partie that is to bleede be fearfull, turne his face away to the contrarie ſide, &amp; let his minde be drawen by other talke of the ſtanders by from the preſent practiſe of the Phlebotomer. The member that is to be opened, muſt hang downward, that the courſe of the bloud may be direct and eaſie for that part which we deſire moſt to euacuat. Then that part of the member which we meane to take: as of arme, thigh, hande, or foote: muſt bee rubbed, to drawe the bloud vnto that part, euen vntill it waxe hote. Next wee take a ſtrong bond &amp; binde it next aboue the place, whoſe veine muſt be taken, that the bloud comming downe, the veine may ſwell and appeare in ſight. It muſt be bounde harder in ſome, than in others: as namely in ſuch perſons that haue their veines couered, as it were, with much fleſh or fatt.
               By this hard binding, the veine is ſtretched out, or ſwelleth: it ſtandeth ſure and flyeth not

frō the ſtroke of the Phebotomer. And thirdly, the bloud commeth forth with the more force: we vſe alſo to binde beneath the place, when the quiuering &amp; vnconſtant veine, ſlippeth aſide out of his place from the hand of the Phiſicion. They that haue a full &amp; thick skin, narrow veines, and deepe in the fleſh: or great veines, &amp; couered with fat, muſt be bound both waies, and haue the bond tyed faſter than thoſe of a contrarie conſtitution. If the veines be verie ſmall &amp; little, that they do not fully &amp; ſufficiently apeare by binding, as it happeneth in the veines of the hands, feet &amp; ankles. VVe ſoke them in warme water, or pour warme water vpon them: that the skin &amp; fleſh may waxe ſoft, and the veines beſeene: &amp; then we binde them, &amp; ſo they bleed the better. If the veine yet appeare not, wee ſearch for it, in the place where it ſhould be with our ſingars vntil partly thereby, &amp; partly by the fluxe of blod we wel perceiue the ſame. VVe bind the necke, but ſoftly, when wee take the veine of the forehead, or the veines vnder the tonug. Yea, many times in theſe wee take a table napkin, &amp; putting it about the necke, cauſe the partie himſelfe to hold both the endes, as he may ſuffer or indure the ſame. VVhen wee throughly and well perceiue the veine, we ſtrike the ſame ſoftly with the inſtrument, diligently taking heed, that he wound not in ſteede thereof, an arterie,

ſinewe, or ſome g
                     •
                  iſtly ende of a muskle called a Tendon, lying vnder the veine, or ſome other part neare vnto it. For ſomtime when we bind hard with the bonde, there appeareth a place puffed vp with wind, &amp; there ſwelleth a thing like a veine that is no veine. And ſometime, an arterie preſſed downe, doth not moue, and ſo ſeemeth to be a veine: and therefore to be more ſure, let him with the forefinger feele the place of the inciſion, &amp; the veine vnderneath. This done, let the Phiſition take his inſtrument at the verie fingers ends, with a good eye, and a good hande: and let him not put foorth more of the point than is ſufficient to pearce withall. And that the veine eſcape not the inſtrument, in one hand, let him hold the launcet, and with the thombe of the other hande applyed to the veine that is to be opened, let him ſettle, preſſe, and keepe downe the ſame, chat it ſtart not aſide: and ſo ſoftly without haſte, put in the inſtrument ſufficiently, and let the Phlebotomer haue good experience to open a veine with both hands: for a veine of the right aṙme, is beſt opened with the right hand▪ &amp; a veine of the left with the left hand. The veines in the ioynts in the bending of the arme, &amp; in the hammes being cut in rectum that is right, growe together but ſlowly, becauſe the ioynts with motion do open ſtill the lippes of the wound. Neither are we ſo to cut them, except

when wee neede to reiterate bleeding▪ Veines without the ioynts, as in the head, in the hands, in the feet, opened in rectum are quickly couered with a skarre, becauſe the ſides doe ſoone grow together againe.
               There lyeth vnder the inner vaine (called Baſilica) alſo an arterie: and vnder the middle veine, a ſinewe: and vnder both, for the moſt part, Tendons of the Muskles. Cephalica veine albeit it be heard to take: yet it is moſt ſafely taken of all the reſt. For in opening therof a mā cannot light vp
                     •
                  
                  ̄ any Tendon, arterie or ſinew. VVhen a Tendon or ſinew is prickt, there followeth great paine, aſtoniſhment, reſolution &amp; convulſion of the atme, with a ſwelling. VVhē an arterie is prickt, the bloud is verie hardly ſtayed: and conſequently through effuſion of much bloud: the ſtrength of nature is waſted. Neither doth the arterie heale vp or growe againe togither: but part of it is corrupted like Gangraena, which is a putrifying or rotting of the fleſh, by mortifying the ſenſible parts therof: if a ſinewe or Tendon be prickt, the ſame is perceiued by great paine, convulſion, &amp; ſwelling following.
               If there be doubt that a ſinewe is prickt: let not the wound grow together, till it be ſafe ſrō inflamation; &amp; that two or three dayes ar ouer paſſed: it may be kept from growing together, by bathing of it in warme oyle. After three

daies: if the paine ceaſe, &amp; that there come no new accidents, we may permit the vnion, &amp; ſuffer it to grow togethers againe: if not, then we are to vſe opening, &amp; attracting things, &amp; ſuch as wil help the pricking of ſinewes, as namely turpentine, putting therto ſomtime á litle Enforbium. VVhen an arterie is wounded there cōmeth forth thin bloud, red, fine &amp; ſpinning out. To help this caſe, make a plaiſter of Aloes, Mirrh, Frankencenſe, Bol-armoniak, the white of an egge, &amp; haires of an Hare: lay ouer theſe a linnen cloth dipt in Roſe-water, &amp; faſten the plaiſter wel with a bond that it come not off in 3 dayes: then (this being gently remoued) apply another like vnto it. If the arterie will not grow togither with theſe, cut the whole arteri

                   ouerthwart, that when the extremities are pulled vp on both ſides, the place may growe, and be couered with ſoft fleſh.
               Touching the maner of the inciſion, &amp; quantitie of the wound: if we iudge the bloud in the pacient to be thick, clammie &amp; Melancoly: &amp; that the conſtitution of the aire be colde; the wound muſt be reaſonaby large &amp; wide: that the thick bloud, &amp; groſſe fumes, may the better iſſue foorth: for the wound in this caſe being little &amp; ſtrait; the moſt thinne bloud alone floweth out, the groſſe thick bloud remaining ſtill behinde. A large wound therefore is beſt in theſe three caſes.
               
                  
Firſt, when the bloud is groſſe, thick &amp; Melancoly, that it may paſſe foorth with the more facilitie. Secondly, when there is great abundance of humors: for they are better expelled with a large than a narrowe or ſmall wound. Thirdly, when the countrey or ſeaſon of the yere is extreme colde, as in Winter, in ſroſt and ſnow: for cold maketh the humors thick. Contrariwiſe, a narrow or little cut is beſt, when the ſtrength of the bodie is but weake: leſt the wound being too large, the vitall ſpirites might immoderatly paſſe foorth with the bloud. Alſo in a hote countrey or ſeaſon, or when euacuation of ſubtile and thinne bloud is requifite: Schola Salerni ſayeth:

                     Fac plagam largam, mediocriter, vt cito fumus, exeat vberius, liberiuſ

                  unne. Melancoly &amp; ſlegmatike complexions bleede often times guttatim. i. drop by drop, &amp; therefore a larger wound muſt be made in thē than in others. When the veine is opened, we oft alſo looſe the band from the vpper partes, that the bloud may runne the better. If the bloud run ſufficiently, let it alone: if but ſlowly, &amp; that through fault of the inciſiō, amend it. If throgh groſnes of the bloud, or of any other cauſe; let the patient bend his fiſt hard together, or turne the ſtaffe about in his hand, or by coughing or

lowd ſpeaking, let him enforce the ſinewes, Muskles &amp; ſydes. And if need ſo require, bath the wound with warme water. If he be fearefull or faint harted when he ſeeth the bloud, &amp; that it be ſtayed through feare; leaue off a while til the ſtrength be recouered, by ſuch meanes as we ſhal declare anon: Yea, albeit the bloud flow reaſonably wel; yet it is good in the midſt of bleeding, to ſtop it with the finger, both to recreat the ſtrength, that it be not too much waſted: &amp; alſo that the filthie &amp; corrupt bloud may with the more ſpeede come from the inmoſt partes, &amp; ſo be expelled.
               The quantitie of bloud paſſed forth is to be conſidered, as wee ſhewed before 14 &amp; 15 Chapters, that it may be ſtayed in due time: &amp; in this behalfe therof two regards are to be had eſpecially. Firſt, the neceſsitie of the diſeaſe. Secondly, the conſtancie &amp; firmenes of natural ſtrength: wherof looke in the foreſaid places more at large. After good bloud apeares, bleed no more for feare of the crampe, convulſion, palſie, dropſie, &amp; ſuch like. In a ſimple plenitude, to auoid imminent dangers, it ſhal be ſufficient only to abate the abundance: albeit, a mediocritie ſtil remain. But in an vniuerſal diſeaſe, as is a feuer; a mediocritie will not ſerue, but bloud is abated more then ſo. And in inflamations we are not only to regard the quantity but in like maner the alteratiō of the colour &amp;

ſubſtance of bloud, and when great paine, or inflamation is in places neere the inciſion: ſtay not the bloud before the paine begin to aſſwage, or the colour of the bloud to change. For alteration of colour ſheweth that the ſame bloud (vnlike the other that good is) proceeded from the inflamed part. If the humor cleaue faſt to the member, or that by euacuation the ſtrength of nature bee waſted, then wee are vrged to ſtay bleeding, before the bloud doo chaunge in colour, and to detract that which remaineth by reiterating Phlebotomy, either the ſame day, or the day after. Hyppocrates, 2. vict. acuto. 10. In the cure of the Plureſie writeth, that in the cure of that diſeaſe, the inner veyne of the arme is ſpeedily to be opened, and bloud plentifully to be withdrawen vntill the ſame appeare far redder than it did at the firſt: or that for pure and red bloud, the ſame appeare ſwart and blacke, which both happen in Pluriſies. If the bloud were before rawe, crude, &amp; vndigeſted: and that it come from the inflamed place, neere an inciſion: it becommeth redder, or yeallower, becauſe this bloud is horter, than that which went before. If it were at the firſt thus coloured: namely, redde or yeallowiſh, than when it commeth from a member inflamed, it turneth to be black and ſwart, thorough aduſtion, and thus you ſee how to ſtop the fluxe of bloud, by the quantity, by the ſubſtance, and by the colour of the ſame▪
               
               
                  
As wee are to conſider the foreſaide thinges, in the bloud, ſo are wee to conſider ſtrength in the Pacient. Of defect of ſtrength theſe are the ſignes: The fluxe of bloud relenting: pa
                     •
                  e colour in the face: gapings: ſtretchings: noiſe in the eares: webs in the cies: and defect of ſeeing: All theſe ſhew a decay of the ſpirits oflife; they ſhewe faintnes of the heart; and that the bodily parts are forſaken of inward heate. To theſe may bee added, the hicket: and a deſire to vomit, which commeth of fluxe of the humor, to the mouth of the ſtomacke, as were already ſhewed. But the moſt certaine and aſſured marke, is the alteration of the Pulſe, which changing from thicke to ſlow, from great to little, from ſtrong to weake, from equall to vnequall; prognoſticate defect of nature, and a perturbation in the body, not much vnlike Epilepſia: that is, the falling ſickenes. If theſe come through feare, or of humors nipping the ſtomacke; ſtay bleeding, recreate and ſtrengthen the Pacient a while: that afterward the reſidue of the euacuation, may be perfected.
               The waies to recouer and fetch ſtrength againe, if the ſame giue ouer before a conuenient and commodious quantity of bloud may be taken, are theſe: to caſt colde water on the face of the Pacient: to ſprinckle vppon the face white odoriferous wine, to put to the noſe of the ſame party, vineger, ſtrong wine, muske, or

other aromatick thinges, if theſe helpe not, wee muſt cloſe vp the veyne a while with the finger, and if neede be, the euacuation is to be imparted or diuided. But to auoide all theſe accidents, the remedy is to let bloud, the party lying in his bed, for ſo the partes of the body are reduced into one equality of poſition, whereby the principall parts mutually beſtow one on an other inward heat and vitall ſpirits: if the Patient bee not brought againe by the foreſaide thinges, then prouoke vomit by tickling in the throat, or by pouring in a litle oile, for the force of vomiting ſtirreth vp ſtrength, and draweth away weakeneſſe of the ſtomacke and heart, and preſently after recouery, renue the ſtrength of nature, with wine, iuce of Pomgranats, broth of fleſh, with the receit called Diamo
                     •
                  cho, and other cordiall things.
               The inſtrument may bee annointed with oile, or other ſuch liquor, that it may inflict the wound without paine, and for the moſt part the wounde muſt bend ſomewhat aſlaunt or crookedly. The inciſion is made two waies, as Hyppocrates ſaith: one ſtraight Secundum rectum, or Edirecto, downeright: the other contrary crookedly, or a ſwaſh. In theſe two waies wee muſt vſe great diſcretion, to vſe them as neede requireth, and not deceiue our ſelues, vſing the one, when wee ſhould the other, (as many are deceiued in theſe daies.) To ſhewe which of

theſe is to bee preferred, would require a long diſcourſe, whereof read at large, Fuchſius in his Apologie againſt Brachelius.
               
               There is newe kinde of inſtruments to let bloud withall nowe a daies: as the Rapier, Sword, and long Dagger; which bring the bloud letters ſometime to the Gallowes, becauſe they ſtrike too deepe. Theſe inſtruments are the Ruffians weapons, more malitious than manly. But in this practiſe the veyne muſt be opened with a fine Launcet, no fleme with a beard like a bloud-iron wherewith Smiths let horſes bloud, for they will ſometime cut a veyn thorough on both ſides, cauſing a crampe and deadly convulſion. And here I giue aduiſe, that no Surgion except he be very skilfull himſelfe, open any veyne without the counſaile of the learned Phiſition, or the iudgement of ſome others, that haue auncient and tried experience in the practiſe. Ignorant Barbers doo great hurt herein, taking that which comes to hand firſt, or which appeareth greateſt (perhaps a ſinew for a veyne) ſo letting out the vitall ſpirits, and killing many: and when it is done, this is all their defence, to ſay the ſigne was there, and he would needs be let bloud.
               Vnction or annointing, is oft vſed in this practiſe: ſometime we rub the member, whoſe veyne is to be taken with oile, that thorough the warmth thereof, bloud may bee made the

more flowing: ſometime the inſtrument is annointed, as was ſaide before, to mittigate the paine of the inflicted wound. Sometime the wound it ſelfe is annointed, that it may bee the longer time, before it bee couered with the Scarre, and that the humors left behinde▪ may with the more liberty breath foorth, and that the ill humors remaining, may bee alſo the better diſperſed.
               Drinke, and eſpecially wine, may bee very well taken both in the bleeding, if Syncope happen, and after bleeding, to cauſe good bloud, and to recouer againe the vitall ſpirits.
               Bathing two or three daies before, is vſed in ſome cauſes (as was declared in the former chapter) but not the ſelfe ſame day.
               The common opinion is, that bleeding muſt be done faſting, and vppon an empty ſtomacke: but this is not approoued of the beſt writers, for many of them giue aduiſe to eate before bleeding a ſoft or poched egge, with a draught of wine about nine or ten of the clocke 
                     •
                  n the forenoone: and then preſently to open a veyne. For nature (the ſtomacke being empty, and being altogether deſtitute of nouriſhment) doth mightily holdfaſt, and retaine the bloud: whereas when a little nouriſhment is taken in ſmall quantitie, as is a poched egge, &amp; a draught of wine; ſhee permitteth the bloud eaſily to paſſeforth.
               
                  
It hath bin declared before Chapter 16. that if neceſſitie vrge, there is no preſcribed time of bleeding, but that if the diſeaſe require, the ſame may be done at all times, yea euen in the night. Yet the forenoone of the day is the moſt vſuall time. There is an houre of neceſſitie, which is any houre in the day or night: and beſide this, hora neceſſitatis, there is hora commodi

               Moreouer, if a veine opened ſend forth bloud whitiſh in coloure: ſtay the ſame, for it appeareth that the humours in the bodie are rawe, colde, and vndigeſted, through defect of naturall and digeſting heate. This is affirmed by Ariſtotle lib. 1. &amp; 9. de animalibus: and Hippocra. witneſſeth, that alwaies womens termes appeare not in their proper colour; &amp; that by reaſon of frigiditie and coldnes of white bloud, they oftentimesvomit, and haue fluxe of tearmes.
               Finally, as in purging, ſo in bleeding, as wee haue already ſaid, wee are to conſider the ſtanding of the wind, &amp; in winter to bleed whē the ſame is Sowtherly: &amp; in Sommer when the ſame is Northerly. For the North wind with cold tempereth the heat of the time.

               A preſcription, or regiment of the patient, after bleeding. Chap. 20.
               WHen a ſufficient quantity of bloud is withdrawen, proportionable vnto the greatnes of the diſeaſe, vnlooſe the bond, and drie the wound: leſt beeing moiſtened with clodded bloud, either it growe not together againe, or bring ſome doubt of impoſtumation. Theſe thinges not done accordingly, enforceth vs ſometime the eight day after, to open the wound againe. If any piece of fat come forth, the ſame muſt not be cut off, but ſoftly put againe into the wound. When the wound is wiped cleane, &amp; drie, cloſe vp the veine with linnen dipt in roſe water, or ſweete water; or with Oile, if wee purpoſe to bleede againe. Let the ſame bee tyed on

with bondes: not too
                     •
                  hard for writhing the ſkinne, or lippes of the wound.
               If a ſinew or Tendon be pricked, yee heard in the chapter before what is to be done. If there be doubt of fluxe of bloud, or an inflammation through pricking of a ſinew, we may beſide the premiſſes, apply after the practiſe of others, a plaſter of Ceruſe: and in compas about that, a Cataplaſme of Houſleeke, Nightſhade, Plantaine, and other cold things. After bleeding lye a while on the backe, for quietnes ſake, and to recreate the ſtrength of nature, and to recouer the vitall ſpirits. He muſt not frequent his accuſtomed affaires, nor moue his bodie haſtely, nor exerciſe himſelfe immoderatly, neither muſt he vſe Venus delightes, nor yet bath himſelfe. For the bloud and ſpirits naturall, vitall and animall which haue of late bin vehemently ſtirred by bleeding, are now by reſt againe to be ſetled: elſe the ſame bloud and ſpirites would by theſe outward vehement exerciſes, bee inflamed, and ſo waſt and conſume away. Neither muſt the party preſently ſleep, leſt either the languiſhing heat be quite extinguiſhed, or the leſſened ſpirits, altogether ouerwhelmed. Let him therefore watch, and reſt void of contention, either in mind or in body. When an houre or two is paſt after bleeding, a litle meate may bee giuen him: Little (I ſay) in quantity, but of good iuice, to nouriſh the

bodie, and profitable alſo to withſtand the preſent diſeaſe: &amp; when 2. hours are paſt this ſhort repaſt, he may then ſleepe, ſo as his keepers carefully take heed, that he tumble and turne not himſelfe on the arme that hath bled, or that the bond by tumbling and toſſing be not remooued, which may cauſe the bloud to ſlow againe a freſh, or ſome other diſpleaſure to fall out. Afterward the diet muſt bee increaſed by little and little, both in reſpect of the quantity, and of the goodnes of the meat. Neither as yet muſt we haſten to a full diet, for the heat of nature being abated by bleeding, can not as yet receiue or digeſt aboundance of meat. And againe, the veines lately emptied, would exhauſt out of much aboundance of meat, much raw and vndigeſted matter, wherwith the whole bodie is ſtuffed againe. If concoction bee perfected and accompliſhed, ſo that we may eate great quantity of meat, yet vſe a moderation: for to what purpoſe is it, preſently againe to ſtuffe the bodye with iuices and humours: for the abating and taking away wherof, we did ſo lately let bloud. Therefore after bleeding the patient is to liue more finely and exquiſitly, and not to goe to his old intemperat diet againe, as the dog to his vomit. Neither are theſe intemperat perſons meete men to be let bloud, as we prooued and ſhewed before in the 8. Cap. Fig. 1.
               
               
                  
Of reiterating bleeding, which they call Epaphaereſis, this is the order. Firſt in inflamations, great paine, hot feuers cauſed of aboundance of hot bloud: a veine muſt be opened, as is alreadie ſhewed, euen preſently at the very beginning before the matter be gone to ſom principal member: not only that the aboundance and exceſſiue quantity of bloud, but that much more a great deale, euen plentifully, and generally may be euacuated, yea euen till the patient giue ouer, if the ſtrenght of the body ſo permitte. And in diſeaſes cauſed of fulnes, the bodily powers are firme for the moſtpart: neither doo they ſhrinke or relent much, by this plentifull bleeding. And when Hippo. permitted bleeding ſo long, till the patient ſhould giue ouer: hee ment it ſo, when the ſtrength therevnto ſufficient, was able to beare it, and not otherwiſe. For if fainting doo happen whē the powers of nature are firme and conſtant, it doth only waſt the ſpirits in the arteries, thoſe forces remaine ſtill vnhurt and vndamnified, which narure hath bred in the hart, Liuer or braine. And albeit theſe decay in Lypothimia, yet of the ſetled forces other like preſently come in place whereby againe the Patient is reuiued. But when the ſtrengh of the bodie is weake, and greatly enfeebled, becauſe the forces of nature ſetled and ſeated in the principall members, are alſo impaired.
               
                  
If Lypothimia then chaunce, re
                     ••
                  itution wil hardly be made. Therefore (I ſay) the vertues of nature beeing greatly debilitated: beware of ouer comming or fainting. And this is the order in great and vrgent ſickneſſes.
               In ſmall generall diſeaſes, as in repletions, fulnes, feuers, and ſuch like, whoſe cauſe and principall matter is conteined in the veines: if bodily ſtrength permit, we muſt preſently euacuat, &amp; wholly at the beginning, &amp; at one time: not till the patient ouercome, but ſo much as is needefull▪ and as the infirmitie or malady requireth. And this euacuation without any hurt to the naturall forces, withdraweth the matter abounding, either before the ſame do wholly putrify, or that it poſ

                  e ſome notable member, or before any horrible accidents happen. He that for feare or any other cauſe parteth or diuideth in theſe, the euacuation: he continueth the diſeaſe long time, &amp; doth no good, but great hurt to the ſicke patient. But if for imbecillity of ſtrength the whole euacuation can not be accompliſhed or done: ſeeing it is better in this caſe, to marke the ſtrength of the party, then the vehemencie of the diſeaſe: we are inforced to vſe partition in the bleeding; and yet with a great circumſpection and care: and let the partition be within a litle diſtance of time, either by vndooing or vnlooſiug of the bound, or ſtay the blod with

applying the finger on the wound ſo long, as by the foreſaid meanes, the forces of the body may bee recouered. Sometime an hours ſpace is ſufficient, ſometime more houres 
                     •
                  re required, to the reſtoring of the forces of nature. The beſt way is not to deferre the partition of bleeding paſt one day: yet (I ſay) if ſtrength permit, &amp; that partition muſt be vſed, bleede twiſe in the ſelfe ſame day, in general diſeaſes eſpecially: &amp; except other imped

                  ts greatly let, euacuacuat in one day, aſmuch as is expediēt, before the matter come to putrffaction or that other euils do grow. But in partiall diſeaſes of particular mēbers, chiefly in inflammations, the parted or diuided euacuation may be put off a longer time, either to the day following, or to the day after to morrow: that in this ſpace, the corrupted humours, may goe from the member diſeaſed into the veins exhauſted: and ſo by the next inciſion, be euacuated. The member of the bodie that is afflicted with griefe or corruption, by little and little, euen in one day or two daies at the moſt, ſendeth downe the humours to the place where the inciſion was. And for aſmuch as they are corrupted, they are not there to remaine: albeit the former paines be mittigated and aſſwaged. But if the inflammation bee peſtilent and venomous, as is a peſtilent botch or carbuncle, the euacuation of neceſſitie muſt be

reiterated euen the ſelfe ſame day: leſt the peſtilent infection ſticke and ſtay any long time, in the veines, to the great hurt of the partie.
               But neither muſt reiterating of bleeding be vſed: For thereby the vitall ſpirites, and in ward heate is diminiſhed, and vntimely age is haſtened on apace, and the ſame when it commeth is made ſubiect to greeuous diſeaſes, as Chachexia, the dropſie, gout in the iointes, trembling, palſies, and apoplexies. Yea when the naturall heat is immoderatly cooled and naturall moyſture waſted, the bowels languiſh, crudity and vndigeſtion beginneth to beare rule, whereby are cauſed great and greeuous euils in the body of man. And thus much of the reiterating of bleeding, and order thereof.
               But let vs come againe to our former matter of preſcription, moderat motion, &amp; eaſy walking, as it was conuement before bleeding, to vnlooſe, and make the humours thinne, ſo alſo the ſame is neceſſarie after bleeding to diſperſe abroad the reliques of thoſe vapors and humours which are left behinde. And as bondes of linnen were vſed before bleeding, to the intent the veines might waxe bigge, appeare full, and bee the better perceiued and ſeene: and that the humour with the more facilitie might come to the place appointed

for inciſion: ſo afterward, they are alſo needfull, to ſtay the fluxe of bloud, and bind vp the wound.
               It was already ſaid that the partie let bloud muſt not ſleepe, that is to ſay, not within the ſpace of eight or ſixe houres at the leaſt▪ whereof this is alleaged as a reaſon, that the fumes cauſed by ſleepe, bee not carried vp to the head, and ſo offend the braine▪ There may hereof bee aleaged other cauſed more, as namely: leſt the veine opened ſhould take hurt by toſſing of the patient vp and downe in his ſleepe: which cauſe was lately aboue ſpecifyed. Alſo leſt in ſleepe the humors ſhould flow to the member, where the inciſion was made, and there apoſtumat. For pained places as Galen affi

                  uſing. For while the member is toſſed hether and thether with inordinat and vnorderly motion: the bondes are vnlooſed, the wound vnhealed, and (as it were) newly opened, notwithſtanding the late inciſion, it doth afreſh ſende foorth immoderat fluxe of bloud, the partie in his ſleepe not witting thereof▪
                  
whereby (as all men know) the life commeth into great danger. Againe, another diſcommodity by ſleeping immediatly after bleeding is: that fumous excrementes through ſleepe are againe inwardly reuoked to the principall members.
               Againe, the vitall ſpirits, and natural heat, which by opening of a veine, are drawen to the outward partes and members, by ſleepe are reuoked to the center, or middes of the bodie: and ſo very often, partly through a commotion made by inciſion, and partly through that retraction made by ſleepe: ſuch a boiling happeneth in the humours of the body, that oft therby at length a feuer is cauſed and kindled. It is therefore apparant, that ſleepe preſently after bleeding is not good, and chiefly if in the meane ſeaſon the patient haue receiued no meat. If after taking of meat hee ſleepe an houre or two, or more (diſpoſition ſo ſeruing) it hurteth not at all, or verie little.
               But for as much as the commotion of humours can not fully be ſetled in ſhort ſpace after bleeding, it is far ſafer to forbeare ſleepe, as we haue proued by ſundry reaſons. If neceſſity &amp; diſpotition v

                  ligent circumſpection, that the bonds bee not vnloſed, and ſo the Patient brought in perill of his life. Some bring in a

further reaſon, yet of the fore ſaid, namely, why we ſhould not preſētly ſleep after bleeding &amp; that is: becauſe the matter through ſleep▪ waxeth thicke, and ſo a bruſing or a confraction that way happeneth in the members: as is accuſtomed in a quartan, through the thicknes &amp; coldnes of the matter. Againe the veines &amp; ſinewes after bleeding, being now emptied, are becom cold, &amp; ſo the fumes which are brought vnto the veines and ſinewes in ſleepe, do alſo be come thicke and waxe colde: becauſe by ſleepe the whole naturall heat of the bodie is drawen euen into the depth and profunditie of the bodily partes. And when the veines and ſinewes are become cold, partly for defect of bloud, partly through cold fumes brought by ſleepe vnto them: they doo participate groſnes, coldnes, &amp; confraction to the other members: for it is a principle, Simile a ſimili facile afficit

                     r. Like of the like is eaſily affected. And thus much of ſleepe after bleeding, which is to bee vnderſtood of ſleepe onely following immediatly after, and not otherwiſe.
               The verſes of Scola Salerni concerning this point are theſe.

                  To feede ſtreightwaies, is farre amiſſe.
               
               The patient is a while after bleeding, to abſtaine from meat, till the motion of humors be appeaſed. For in this caſe, rawe iuices and meat not yet concected, is drawen with the bloud to aid the member afflicted. Looke Galen, lib. 4. Cap. 10. de Sanitate tuenda.
               
               Milke, &amp; meates made of milke, after bleeding are to be eſchewed: for certeine of thoſe humors which were troubled and moued in opening the veine, flowe vnto the ſtomack: and foraſmuch as milke is otherwiſe of it ſelfe, ſubiect to corruption: being nowe in this caſe inwardly receiued, &amp; mingled with the foreſaide humors: it is verie ſoone putrified: and becauſe of the ſweetnes thereof, though it be vnconcocted &amp; rawe, yet it is mightily ſucked vp, and drawen in of the emptie veines.
               Irem, all cold things, either in wardly taken, or outwardly applyed, are to be auoided: of which ſort are chiefely cold meats, cold drinks, cold bathings &amp; waſhings, cold aire, thinneſſe of clothes, bare ſitting vpon ſtones, coldnes of the head &amp; feete: for by theſe the body would be immoderatly cooled; natural heat being alreadie diminiſhed through bleeding.
               
                  
Item, miſtie &amp; cloudie aire is to be eſchewed: for ſuch weather ingendreth Melancholie bloud, &amp; maketh a heauie mind. He muſt therfore walke in cleare, bright &amp; faire weather: for thereby the ſpirits of life are refreſhed.
               Item, immoderat motion is to be forborne, &amp; a temperat quietnes to be imbraced, both of body &amp; of mind. For vehement mouings do yet more &amp; more ſtil diſturb the humors of the body, before excited &amp; ſtirred vp by bleeding▪ &amp; ſo conſequently the ſame weaken too much the bodily forces: wheras quietnes &amp; reſt ſoon appeaſeth this commo

Item, Beware of much meat, the firſt or ſecond day. And let the meat be of good digeſtion, and cauſing good blood: as ſoft egges: good wine: chickens, and ſuch like. Therefore Iſaac in dietis ſaith of ſuch as are let bloud: that their meat muſt be leſſened, and drinke increaſed: that is, the drinke muſt be more in reſpect of his meat that he eateth daily, not in regard of that cuſtome which he obſerued before bleeding. Yea, he muſt nowe drinke leſſe than he did before.
               Some after letting bloud, are verie drye in the mouth: which happeneth through the great motion of the humors, and by abundance and ebullition of choler, whoſe fumes ariſe vpward to the mouth &amp; other parts. Theſe are to drink Barlie water, to mitigate the acuitie, ſharpnes &amp; heat of choller: &amp; ſo muſt they do in like maner that are in doubt of inflammation of the Liuer and ſtomake, through abundant boiling of chollericke humors: ſpecially, if it be red choller, that aboundeth in them.
               If through hard binding of the arme, before or after bleeding, paine doe enſue, and ſo conſequently ſluxe of humors to the place cauſing apoſtumation in the arme: then according to Auicen, let bloud in the other arme: or according to Rhazes, aboue the place in the ſame arme; and apply to the place repercuſsiues to keepe backe the matter.
               
                  
The wound in the arme after bleeding ſomtime healeth but ſlowly, becauſe the inſtrumēt was annoynted with oyle, as wee ſaid before, that the ſame might enter the better &amp; do leſt hurt to the pacient, as Galen ſaith 9. Method. The cauſe now of this ſlowe healing is, for that the healing is much hindered, by reaſon of the oyle which is betweene the ſides or the lippes of the wound: For, as the ſame Galen &amp; other authors affirme, a wound is not cured or healed as long as there is any thing betweene the ſides or lippes of the ſame. Another cauſe why after bleeding the wound cloſeth but ſoftly is, that there hath bin too much euacuation of bloud, whereby the force of nature is debilitated, which hindereth the continuatiō or conſolidation of the wound. A third reaſon hereof may be, the oft mouing of the arme: for wounds do neuer heale, except the member enioy reſt, where they are inflicted. Therfore let this fault be remedied by contraries, as thus: Let not the inſtrument be oyled: euacuat not too much

               What veines are to be opened, both in generall, &amp; particular diſeaſes. Chap. 21.
               SOmetime are opened veines, &amp; ſometime arteries. Of opening of an arterie wee purpoſe to ſpeake afterward in a Chapter by it ſelfe. And now of opening onely of a veine;

which is vſed in many members: Sometime in the arme called Manus magna: ſomtime in the hand called Manus parua: ſomtime in the feete: ſomtime in the noſe: ſomtime in the forehead: lipps: toung: palat, or roofe of the mouth: ſometime in the corner of the eye, toward the forehead: ſometime in one place: ſometime in another: as this diſcourſe following doeth plainly teach. It is knowē to thoſe that haue ſeen Anatomies, that there are in the bodie of man, two ſortes of veines. Generall, &amp; ſpeciall.
               Fiue veines are opened in Manu magna, in the great hande: that is, ab aſcellis vſque ad cubitum, that is, from the elbowe forwarde, or downward, as Rhazes faith in 7. ad Almonſor. Chap. 21. and Auicen in quarta. i. Chap. 20. VVhere note, that Phiſicions by the great hande, do meane the whole arme, together with the hand: as by the foot, the whole legg, from the hippes or huckle bone, to the ſoale of the foote.
               The common or generall veines which appeare in the middeſt of a mans arme, are theſe: The firſt is Humeraria, or Humeralis, in Greek called Omiata, becauſe by the ſhoulder it commeth to the hande. It is alſo called in Latine Vena exterior, the outward veine, becauſe it goeth along on the outſide of the arme. It is againe called Cephalica, or the veine of the head.
               
                  
This veyne is moſt apt and fit, and moſt ſafe to bee opened, for diſeaſes of the vpp
                     •
                  r parts of mans body; it is leſſe dangerous than the reſt, becauſe there is no ſinew or artery vnder it, to hinder or indanger the opening thereof. If a man chaunce not to touch it at the firſt ſtroke, he may be bold to ſtrike it againe: for there is I ſay, no ieoperdy to cut any muskle. It is opened with a long cut to let out groſſe bloud: and albeit there be no feare of any ſinew, artery, or Tendon vnderneath it: yet wound it not too deepe, for feare of apoſtumation. This veyne is taken when the parts aboue the breaſt or necke (as the face or heade) are diſcaſed. Therefore it is opened profitably for paſſions of the heade, as Hemicrania: the Mygrame, and Mania: Madneſſe, which commeth of too much abundance of good bloud, hauing recourſe vnto the heade: And ſuch other like hote paſſions of the head, proceeding of ho

                  e matter.
               Alſo Cephalica is taken in headach: watchings: and paines of the eies. If it bee opened for headach, purge a day before with a certaine quantity of Pils of Hiera ſimplex, according as the learned Phiſition ſhall appoint thee to take. If you cannot finde out this veyne in the arme, take his braunch about the thombes ende. Galen cap. decimo ſextode Curand. ra

and pulleth backe from thoſe parts which are aboue the canell bone of the throat called Clauicula, and this it doth with the more celerity and greater ſpeede, if it be opened in the arme: more weakely, and with leſſe ſpeede, if it be taken but in the braunch thereof: that is, betweene the forefinger and the thombe. Inward and outward affects of the head, whether they be but yet a beginning, or that they are in Statis maximo, in the greateſt force; are cured and drawen backe, by opening Humeraria veyne in the right arme, if the affects be on the right part or ſide of the heade: or in the left arme, if the paine be on the left ſide. This practiſe may be done not ſo ſpeedily but at more leyſure, only to preuent the foreſaid cuils to come, by opening the braunch of Caephalica, iuſt betweene the thombe and the forefinger. Theſe affects are oft remoued without opening of a veyne, as are alſo ſometimes frenſies, rauinges, apoplexies, euen by ſcarrification of the ſhoulders, by boxing and bleeding at the noſe. Item eies inflamed, and burned with ſharpe droppinges, and cies that water, are remedied: Firſt by opening of Humeraria on that ſide where the paine is moſt: and afterward the matter of theſe affects is pulled backe, by applying cupping-glaſſes, to the hinder part of the necke and ſhoulders.
               The ſecond generall veyne in the arme, is the inner veyne of the ſame, called of the Greekes

                  Haepatitis: Of the Latins Fecoria, or Lienaris: late Phiſitions call it Baſilica or Regia in the right arme it is called Hepatica, the veyne of the Liuer: and in the left arme Pulmatica the veine of the lungs: it is alſo called vena interior, and it commeth or groweth thorough the armehole. Fuchſius calleth it Axillaris: that is, the veyne comming from the liuer to the arme hole: Of Axilla which is the arme hole, or hollow place vnder a mans arme, where the haire doth grow.
               The opening of this veyne is very doubtfull and dangerous, both for the artery, and muskle that lyeth vnder it, and alfo for the manifold and vncertaine courſe of the ſinewes in that place: &amp; ſpecially it maketh a man more doubtfull in the inner bought of the arme, than in other places, becauſe there the arme is leſſe fleſhy. Ignorant Barbers, thinking to open Baſilica open oftentimes a great ſinew hard by it, which is like a veyne, and ſo the vitall ſpirits, and life it ſelfe oft runneth out together with the bloud, and this doo ignorant Barbers take in cure for headach, and want of ſleepe, when they ſhould take Cephalica, of whoſe dangerous boldnes we ſpake before, Chap. 19.
               
               This veyne emptieth from thoſe parts which are beneath the necke, as are the breaſtes, ſides, lungs, heart, liuer, ſpleene and marrow: yea, it emptieth from the middle part of the body, vſque ad Clauiculam, to the canell bone of the

                  ituation of the Milt. In which regard, the Baſilica of the left arme is called aboue Lienaris. That repletion which commeth of a filthy gathering together of raw and crude humors, muſt equally bee taken out of both armes.
               In the cure of Feuers, this order of bleeding is to bee obſerued: A ſimple Sinochus feuer, or a ſimple feuer putrified or cauſed through putrifaction of humors: requireth to haue the Baſilicam of the right ſide, or arme opened. So doth an hote peſtelenciall feuer ſimple, and not compound. So doth a tertian, and a continuall quotidian. A quartan requireth the inner veyne of the left arme▪
                  
This is alſo the Methode in pure intermittant and diſcontinuing feuers, if either the plenitude or accidents will haue vs to open a veyne.
               Revulſion of matter from thoſe partes placed betweene the canell bone of the throate and the raines: is done from the right Baſillica or left, as the diſeaſe requireth, if the right parts be affected, open for revulſion Baſilicam dextri brachii: If the left, the other Baſilica: Open this veyne in the arme, if great and ſpeedy bleeding be needefull. If a more ſlacke and remiſſe bleeding will ſerue the turne, ſeeke the braunch of it in the hand, betweene the little finger and the fourth, as ſome ſay from the right kidney to the left, and paſſing ouer the bottome of the ſtomacke.
               Inflammations in the gut called Colon, which is a great gut riſing from the left ſide to the right, or in which is the diſeaſe called the Collick, albeit the ſame be vnder the raines, yet they are cured by revulſion; opening Baſilicam, or the inner veyne of the arme. For ſo the beginnings, and deriuations of the veynes doo ſhew.
               In inflamations of the lungs: take the Baſilica or inner veyne of the left arme, rather than of the right, becauſe the veynes of the lungs, come from the right ſide of the hart, which part of the heart is placed toward the left part of vena caua, &amp; ſo by the left wing, rūneth into the left arme.
               
                  
This order of inciſion alſo helpeth ſpitting of bloud, thorough extreame coughing: the diſeaſe called Tabes: trembling of the heart and ſuch like.
               In a Ṗlureſie, open the Baſilica of the arme, according as the paine ſhall happen in the right or left ſide. In a Plureſie of the right ſide, the right Baſilica, and ſo contrary. Item the interior veyne is taken in inwarde and outward apoſtumations of the breſt, or midriffe, and in inwarde Vlcers, which cauſe vs to ſpit bloud. Thus alſo by opening of Baſilica, are cured inflamations on the ſhoulders, and vnder the arme holes: except they come to the very bought of the arme: for then it were very dangerous to open the very part or member inflamed; but in this caſe we open a veyne in the hand, e directo: that is, ſtraight.
               In paines and inflamations of the Liuer, wee open the right Baſilica: and ſo the left Baſilica when the Milt is inflamed, grieued, or ill affected: and in all theſe wee muſt take the veyne in the arme if much bleeding be needefull: and if not, then the veyne in the hand. Deriuation from the Spleene, is not made as ſome do think, into the veynes called Hymorroide, but into the belly. So de
                     •
                  iuation from the hollownes of the Liuer▪ is made alſo into the belly.
               A poſtumations in the Raines, when the veynes alſo all full of bloud, are repelled by the

right Baſilica, if the right kidney bee grieued: by the left Baſilica, if the left kidney bee ill affected.
               If exceſſiue fulneſſe doo not vrge in theſe apoſtumations, the revulſion is better attempted out of the lower veynes, which are ſtraight and right, as out of the right or left anckle.
               Affects of the belly, as immoderate fluxe of termes, are ſtayed by opening Baſilica in the arme, which draweth the fluxe vpwardes: So doo alſo cupping-glaſſes, applyed either to the paps or nauill.
               That revulſion which is made by opening Baſilica in the arme (ſpecially the right Baſilica) is to be accounted generall: becauſe it draweth from the Liuer (which is the fountaine it ſelfe) from whence all fluxe of bloud commeth, whether the ſame bee fluxe of termes, or any other fluxe of bloud.
               Revulſion made from the lower veynes, is particuler: not euacuating firſt from the Liuer, the fountaine of bloud, as the other doth. And foraſmuch as things vniuerſall, goe before partiticuler things: therefore in inflamations vnder the kidneyes, wee muſt firſt pull backe with direct opening of Baſilica in the arme: and afterward wee are to open the lower veynes, which alſo haue ſome force to reueale: but if either the fulnes or the fluxe be great, it is not beſt firſt to open theſe v eynes below.
               
                  
Finally imminent diſeaſes like to ariſe thorough plenitude of bloud, are kept backe be opening the right Baſilica: that is, the inner veyn in the bought of the right arme.
               The third generall veyne in the arme, is the middle veyne, called of ſome very properly and fitly venacommunis: of other Cardiaca or Cordiaca: venanigra: and Mater: and of the barbarous Phiſitions, Mediana. It is called Media or Mediana for three conſiderations: Firſt, inregard of the ſcituatiō, hauing in the vpper part of the arme aboue it Cephalica vein, &amp; in the lower part of the arme beneath it the Baſilica veyne: and ſo theſe being as it were extreames, it poſſeſſeth the mids betweene them both: Yea, it is indeede a braunch of them both. And for this cauſe ſecondly it hath the name Mediana, as if it were made of them two, as the meane is made or conſiſteth of the two extreames. Thirdly, it hath the name Media or Mediana, for that it is Media: that is, in the middle in reſpect of euacuation: Euaeuating both from aboue and from belowe, aboue the necke, from the necke, and from beneath the necke: For it ſpringeth (I ſay) from the diuiſion or parting of both the other veynes, that is, Cephalica and Baſilica.
               
               By opening this veyn, there is made a generall euacuation of humors, through the whole body. A generall or vniuerſall euacuation I call it, not becauſe it ſpringeth frō the hart as ſome

affirme, but becauſe the fluxe commeth generally from all parts: This veyne being a braunch (as yee haue heard) both of Cephalica and Baſilica.
               
               This veyne is taken when neither of the other appeareth, and withdraweth bloud from them both, according to the iudgment of ſome: This veyne is the ſame which is called alſo Funi
                        •
                      brachii. Cephalica and Baſilica, are (as it were) the Parents of Mediana: As often therefore as thou art determined to open Baſilica, and that the ſame doo not appeare, take rather the Mediana veyne, than the Cephalica. And if thou purpoſe to detract bloud from Cephalica, and that the ſame doo not ſhewe conueniently; open rather Mediana than Baſilica: and being compact of Cephalica and Baſilica, it withdraweth bloud indifferently from them both: both from place and parts beneath, and alſo aboue.
               Some giue aduiſe (vpon what ground I doo not yet ſee) not to open Cardiaca if the Patient feele any weakenes at the heart: but if neceſſiity of bleeding bee vrged, the heart beeing enfeebled, wee are rather to open Cephalica or Baſilica.
               
               This veyne is opened to cu
                     •
                  e 
                     •
                  aſſions of the whole body, eſpecially when they proceede of heate of the heart, and of the Lungs▪ In opening whereof wee muſt bee very warie

and circumſpect, for vnder it there is a certaine muskle, which being very deepely cut or pearſed, bringeth the Patient in ieoperdy of life: and it is opened in paines of the breſt right ſide, and in Plureſies; and muſt be opened ſomewhat ouerthwart. The danger in the cut
                     •
                  ing for the ſinew vnderneath, is eſpecially, if the wound bee deepe: and the ſame daunger in the Greeke is called Aneuriſma. Yet for all this, there is leſſe perill in opening of this, than of Baſilica: and as being compound of Cephalica, and Baſilica, it euacuateth from them both: ſo it reuelleth and pulleth backe from them alſo, and is for the moſt part deepely wrapped in the fleſh, and appeareth not but as it were Soboles, an offſpring of Cephalica and Baſilica. VVhere note that albeit the opening of a veyne, as Galen, and Auicen do teſtefie, be an vniuerſall euacuation out of the whole body, yet not ſo of all veynes a like, but chiefly that is to bee called and accounted a common and generall euacuation, which is made out of theſe three common and generall veynes in the arme: And as affects of the vpper parts are cured by inciſion of the vpper veynes, in the arme; So are griefes of the neither partes, by opening of vey n es in the h
                     •
                  ms and anckles, as Galen faith, and as wee gaue inſtructions before in the eighteene and nineteenth Chapters. If wee doubt whether the 
                     •
                  atient will bleede effectually

or no. Firſt, bath the arme in hotte water, and when the wound is inflicted, drawe the wounde wide and abroade, that the groſſe melancholly bloude, may the more eaſſy paſſe forth. Note alſo that in all ſickeneſſes and times, except in time of peſtilent infection: that veyn of the three, muſt be taken: which appeareth biggeſt and moſt full: for by that yee may perceiue that the members appertinent to thoſe veins, are moſt abounding with ſuperfluous hot▪ bloud. And thus you ſee the profit of opening the common veynes in the arme.
               Moreouer a veyne opened in the arme, ſtayeth fluxe of hemorroids: If any inflamation be about the priuy parts, Areſe, Bladder, or other parts called Obſcaenae: ſo as ther be no venombd matter in the ſame; the fulnes and flux is to be abated out of the vpper veynes in the arme. After the which if neceſſity require, particuler revulſion may bee made out of the lower parts▪ And ſo in fulnes and fluxes of the thighs apoſtumated; firſt open a veyne in the arme, and afterwardes in the foote. If the plenitude or inflamation be but ſmall, omit the vpper veynes, that euacuation from the lower partes ſhall bee ſufficient: And this is the order of opening a veyne either in the beginning, or in the ſtate of diſeaſes.
               For detraction of bloud, to withhold diſeaſes like to come of preſent fulnes and repletion▪
                  
to ſtay the Hemorroids, withdraw the fulnes out of the vpper veines. If a member haue full veines broken, or like to break, &amp; that the mē
                  ber readily receaue fluxes comming vnto it, &amp; that there be yet no diſeaſe bred: do not euacuat the matter at a veine ve
                     •
                  ie nigh the affected part, but a farre off, and direct as it were: whereby the future fluxe may be ſtayed, and the accuſtomed force withdrawen another way. And thus much of the generall veines in the arme.
               Now to proceed to ſpecial veins: we are firſt of all to call to mind: eſpecially the veine called Saluatella, or Salubris: this veine is called of the Arabians, barbarous phiſitions, and of Auicen Sceilen. This veine appeareth in the hand betweene the ring finger and the middle finger, where wee are to note that oftentimes among the Arabians &amp; barbarous phiſitions, that veine which ſheweth it ſelfe, at the wreſt, and is compact of a braunch of Cephalica or Humeraria veine, and the veine called Axillaris, is called Sceilen: whereupon late writers call alſo the veine Saluatell
                        •
                      Axillaris.
               
               This veine is opened in the right hand, for obſtructions of the Liuer: and in the left hand for obſtructions of the ſplene: where of as yet there is no apparant reaſon, but that exper
                     •
                  ēce prooueth it to be ſo. Moreouer when we open

this veine, the hand of the patient muſt be put in warme water till the veine be puffed vp, and ſwell, and may eaſily bee ſeene: and that the humour may bee made ſubtil. Yea when the veine is opened, it is againe put into the water, that the bloud may the ſooner iſſue foorth: if it com forth but ſoftly as it accuſtomably happeneth to moſt of thoſe that bleed at this vein. Againe, it is good to let it bleede in the warme water, leſt the wound bee too ſoone couered ouer with the ſkarre. Rhaz. lib. 7. Cap. 21. ad Almonſ. and Auicen quarta prim, cap. 20. When this veine hath bledd as much as you will, apply on it a little Oile and Salt, and there is no feare in it, becauſe it is far from the hart. This practiſe (I ſay) of opening Saluatella for opilations of the Liuer and ſplene, hath no manifeſt reaſon, but is grounded vppon Galens experience: who hauing a patient troubled with thoſe diſeaſes, deemed, that if he did let her bloud of Saluatella veine, ſhee ſhould recouer: which hee did accordingly, and ſhe was cured preſently.
               
                  Saluatella in the right hand betweene the little finger and the next adioyning, is opened in opilations of the breſt, againſt gummy matter in the e

                  es, perbreakings, yellow iaund
                     •
                  es, paines of the cholicke in the right ſide of the belly. Saluatella in the left hand is opened againſt all diſeaſes of the ſplene comming of

repletion &amp; oppilation: it is good to heale the Hemorroids, frenſies, and chollickes in the left ſide, diſeaſes of the veines, and aboundancè of termes. And I am here to aduertiſe of the variety which I find among writers touching the place where Saluatella is to be opened. For the moſt part I take it to bee opened betweene the middle fingar &amp; the ring fingar. Yet another place of his inciſion (as ſome hold) is betweene the ring fingar and the eare fingar or little fingar.
               Of the inciſion of Satuatella ſixe vtilities are found &amp; numbred. Firſt it purgeth the ſplene: ſecondly it clenſeth the Liuer: thirdly it purifieth the breſt: fourthly it taketh away impediment in ſpeach: fiftly it conſerueth &amp; keepeth from hurts thoſe parts called Praecordia. i. the ſtrings of the hart, the mouth of the ſtomake, and all the ſpirituall members neere the hart: ſixtly it remoueth vnnaturall paines, euen from the ha

                  It purgeth partes praecordiall,
                  And makes the hart for to reioice.
               
               
                  
And thus you ſee from how many places the opening of Saluatella withdraweth bloud: that is from the ſplene, liuer, breſt, precordiall partes, and the hart it ſelfe: in whoſe opening, no daunger is to bee feared, onely with warme water (as yee heard) we muſt both ſubtiliat and make thinne the bloud, &amp; cauſe the ſmall veine, the better to appeare in ſight.
               Although (as yee heard in Saluatella) that this name Axillaris, of ſome writers bee giuen to the veine Saluatella: And that the veine called Sceilen of the Arabians, is alſo of ſome called Vena Axillaris: yet in truth, we following the moſt approued authors, take here Axillaris to be a braunch of Baſilica, &amp; that it appeareth in the bending of the arme downwards, &amp; for Phiſicke helpes is iudged to remedy thoſe diſeaſes, which are cured by opening of Baſilica.
               
               
                  Funis brachii is like Cephalica, &amp; is a branch of Cephalica deſcending, and the iudgement thereof in phiſicke helps, is as the iudgement of Cephalica aforeſaid.
               Arteries, as in whom is the greateſt danger, they are placed of nature far more inwardly, &amp; the veines are more outward, to keepe the body from dangerous hurts. Of Arteries wee purpoſe anone to ſpeake, in a diſtinct chapter: now here wee are yet to proceed further to more particular veines.
               
                  
Item there are two veines in the hinder part of the head, good to bee opened againſt the fren

               Item in the noſe is a veine, in whoſe inciſion you muſt tye the necke with a napkin vntill the partes of the head ſwell, and the veine appeare, &amp; this muſt alſo be done, when the veine in the forehead is opened. This veine in the tip of the Noſe, is opened againſt apoſtumations of the head, rewmes, and fluxes of the Eies: it purgeth the braine, and comforteth memory. This veine muſt bee ſought for

very ſuerly and wiſely, for it lyeth deepe▪ and therefore he that will be ſure of it, muſt find it euen in the very mids betweene the 2. ſides of the noſe end. The 2. veins within the noſthrils are opened againſt heauines of the head.

               Item, there is a veine called Illiaca next vnto the purple veine: which being wel takē, is good to heale paines of all the inward members.
               Item, there is a veine called vena pulſatilis, or

the beating veine, which is opened in trēblings of the heart, ſowning, &amp; Cordiaca paſsio.
               
               Item, there are two veines in the thombes, which are opened in diſeaſes of the head, bleared eyes, &amp; in moſt feuers.
               Item, there is a veine between the forefingar and the thombe, which is opened in ſtopping of the head, to purge ſuperfluitie ofcholer, alſo in agewes, &amp; diſeaſes of the eyes.
               Item, there is a veine between the ringfingar &amp; the little fingar, which is opened in diſeaſes of the head, lungs, &amp; ſplene.

               Item, there is a veine in the belly, which is opened in diſeaſes of the raines, and to purge out the Melancoly bloud.
               Item, there are 4 veines about the place called Pecten. i. the place where the haire groweth about the priuie members, on either ſides which may bee opened in ſuperfluous iſſues

of the Hemorroids: to aſſwage paine and diſeaſes in the bladder &amp; ſecret places: to ſtop bleeding at the noſe and other members: to heale Lyenteria, &amp; Stranguria.
               
               Item, there is a veine ouer the fore-skin of the yard, which is opened againſt the dropſie, and all diſeaſes of the ſame member.
               Item, there is a veine vnderneath the ſaide fore-skin, which is opened for the crampe, ſpalme, collick, ſwelling of the coddes, ſtrangurie, Diſſuria, the ſtone in the raines &amp; bladder.
               Item, there are two veines in the thighes, which are opened in diſeaſes of the raines and bladder.
               Item, there are two veines in the legges, which are opened in dropſies, paines &amp; apoſtumation of the bladder, raines, and priuie parts: in the gowt, &amp; ſwelling of the knees.
               Item, in the feete there are three vaines, Iſchiatica, Saphena, &amp; Vena poplitis: the veine of the hamme behind the knee. Theſe we open to reuoke bloud downward, as in prouoking of menſtruous Termes. But among all theſe, the veine in the ankle is moſt conuenient, as Auicen ſaith: For, vena poplitis, being more nigh vnto the wombe, it draweth bloud better frō thence than either Saphena, or Iſchiatica. When the plenitude in the bodie is not great, it is better to detract the ſame from the right lower veines of the hammes, &amp; the ankle.
               
                  
                  
                     Ʋena poplitis opened, prouoketh Termes: ſo doth it fluxe of Hemorroids: for the force of the bloud tending downwardes, as it were, openeth the womb, &amp; prouoketh conſequently both Termes &amp; Hemorroids.
               If there be any inflamation in or about the bely, at the biginning thereof, draw the matter vpward, and that directly: For from aboue, as from the head, the fluxe proceedeth. Neither in this caſe are we to feare in weomen ſtopping of Termes, by opening a veine in the arme: if preſently therewithall, we open a direct veine in the hamme or ankle, which is the waye to turne them aſide, as we hane ſaid alreadie. But if firſt you ſhould opē a veine below, the force of the inflammation would therhy be increſed.
               Affects in any part vnder the raines, are moſt ſpeedily cured by opening the greater veines of the hamme: the ſame are cured ſlowly, and with leſſe ſpeede, by opening Saphena in the ankle. The raines are in the middle betweene the vpper parts &amp; the lower: Yet I preſcribe &amp; appoint not the poſition, ſo much by order of the member, as by the original &amp; productiō of the veines paſsing into that part. And therfore inflamations in the right muskles, of that part called Abdemē
                   aboue the nauile. i. in the outward &amp; vpward part of the bely or panch, are reuoked by opening a veine below: and inflamations beneath the raines in the gut Colon
                  
are pulled back, by opening the inner vaine of the arme, as before.
               
                  Saphena is opened to withdrawe bloud from the raines, matrix, womb, ſtones, &amp; yard, &amp; frō all mēbers placed below. Saphena &amp; Iſchiatica are braunches of one veine as Galen ſaith 6. Aphoriſ. Saphena, on the inner ſide of the legge, is opened in ſtopping of termes, griefe of the matrix, raines, hippes and priuie members of men or of women.
               
                  Iſchiatica corrruptly called Sciatica beginneth aboue at the huckle bone, or haunch, called Iſchias. This veine may be called the outward Saphena, deſcending from thence on the outſide of the legges. It draweth frō the raines &amp; lower members that are outwardly placed: &amp; is opened in paines of the huckle bone, caled Sciatica: in griefes of the bladder &amp; bowels: gout of the hands &amp; feete: paines of the ioynts: palſeyes: in the diſeaſe called 
                     Ʋaux .i. when a crooked veine ſwelleth with Melancoly blod in the temples, bellie, or legges, &amp; in leproſie.
               Itē, there are two outward veines in the ankles, which are opened in ſtopping of Termes, ſickneſſes of the Splene, paines in the backe, ſtrangurie and ſtone.
               Item, there are two veines vnder the little toa, which are opened to purge ſuperfluities of the matrix, in ſcrophules on the face and legges.
               
                  
Item, there are two veines adioyning to the litle toe, which being opened, cure apoplexies, yellow Iaundies, and choler, palſies, and diſeaſes of the raines.
               Item, there are two veines in the leſ

                  er ioynt of the little toe, which are opened in olde coughes, puſtles, &amp; Opthalmia.
               
               Item, there are two veines in the middle toe, which are opened inſcrophuls, diſeaſes of the face, ſpots, rednes, pimples, watrie eies, canker, knots, &amp; ſtopping of the Termes.
               Item, there is a veine on the left ioynt in the great toe, which is opened in Opthalmia, ſpots of the face, &amp; legges, 
                     ••
                  ch, euil vlcers &amp; ſuperſluitres of the matrix.
               Finally, I conclude with Venatalii, the ankle veine, called alſo Saphena, that of the lower veines, it is of great profit, and to be opened in paines, ſtoppings, &amp; ſwelling of the matrix, or yard: &amp; is opened the foote being put in a veſſel of water. The Sciatica veine, which is one of the middle veines towarde the outſide of the foot, is next in vſe, for the diſeaſe caled Sciatica in the huckle bone: So as firſt we purge with Hiera, and annoynt the place outwardly with oyle of the ſame. And when bloud letting i
                     •
                   not conuenient, (as afterward you ſhal heare) as alſo in this practiſe for Sciatica, wee may applye boxes, with ſcarification: as the place, humours, and time requires, and as affectes

in the vpper partes are cured, by vpper veines, opened in the arme: ſo they in the nether partes, are cured by lower veines, opened in the hammes and ankles.
               As wee haue hitherto declared the veines in generall &amp; particular, with their profits in bleeding, for manifold diſeaſes: So alſo, to the intent that the practiſioner may be furniſhed throughly with knowledge in this point which is the moſt principal: and to know in euery diſeaſe what veine to open, &amp; ſo not to take Hob for Gib (as the prouerb ſaith:) it ſhall not be greatly amiſſe for the more perfectnes herein, to teach this leſſon forward and backward, as they learne their Gamma vt, both waies; that intend to be good Muſicians: ſo muſt thoſe be moſt perfect in this diſcourſe, that in this practiſe of letting bloud will be accounted skilfull and good Phiſicions. Nowe, therefore in a moſt compendious ſort, I will firſt ſet downe the diſeaſe, and then the veine that is to be opened for the ſame.
               And firſt, touching a body that is not yet ſick &amp; diſeaſed: but who that is ſicke, either in his whole bodie, or in ſome particular member in the ſpring &amp; the beginning thereof, he may be let bloud of any veine, of the great &amp; generall veines, &amp; ſo in the preſeruatiue intention, may be kept backe, continuall &amp; vniuerſall feuers, &amp; a general or vniuerſall gowt: if there be

doubt of any particular inflamation in any particular member, let bloud ſome veine in ſome part far off, whereby the v
                     •
                  e and cuſtome of nature, and alſo the fluxe of bloud may be turned from that member where the daunger is verie likely to reſt, into ſome other part farre diſtant, and in theſe two pointes reſteth the whole preſeruatiue intention of this practiſe.
               Concerning a pacient ſicke and diſeaſed, &amp; the curatiue intention of this practiſe: If he be ſicke, he is diſeaſed alſo, either in the whole bodie, or in ſome particular part: If the diſeaſe lye in the whole bodie, then the Baſilica or inner veine of the arme is to be opened, which directly anſwereth vnto the Liuer▪ which is the verie fountaine of bloud.
               If the pacient be ſick in any particular part, the ſame is either aboue the necke, as in the face, or in the head: or it is beneath the necke. The diſeaſes in the face and head are theſe 7. a Frenſie, an Apoplexie, the Letargus or ſleeping diſeaſe, the falling ſickneſſe, the Quincie, inflamation of the eyes, fluxe of bloud from the noſe.
               1 In a Frenſie, in the beginning thereof▪ bloud muſt be pulled backe from the head by opening ſome vaines, as will from farre withdrawe the matter: alwayes obſeruing rectitude with the parte affected: and this may beſt be done from the Cephaliea veine. In the ſtate

of a frenſ
                     •
                  e, or when the force thereof is ſomewhat abated, firſt take away the repletion of the whole body, and then let bloud, either in the member it ſelfe that is affected, or member very neere vnto it: as in this caſe the fitteſt veine is the veine of the forehead, or that veine which is betweene the noſethrils.
               2 In an Apoplexie, firſt in the beginning therofopen Cephalica: If that appeare not, open 
                     Ʋena communis, or Mediana, or that veyne which is betweene the thombe and forefinger
                     •
                   afterward if the diſeaſe be rooted and continue: open the veyne vnder the tongue.
               3 In Letargus or the drowſie diſeaſe, firſt open Cephalica: afterwards if the ſame continue long▪ open the veyne of the forehead.
               4 In the falling ſicknes, open the ſelfe ſame veynes that are opened for apoplexie.
               5 In Angina or quincie, firſt open Cephalica: then the veyne vnder the tongue.
               6 In inflammation of the eies, firſt open Cephalica, then the veyne in the inner angle or corner of the eie.
               7 In ſluxe of bloud from the noſe, open Cephalica, or Mediana, the common veyne.
               For diſeaſes beneath the necke, they are either aboue the raines, in the raines, or beneath the raines. Aboue the raines are theſe foure: A Plureſie, diſeaſes of the lungs, inflammation of the liuer, inflammation of the ſpleene.
               
                  
1 In a plureſie, &amp; the beginning therof, open the Baſilica or inner veine of the arme on that ſide, that is pained abating and putting backe the aboüdance of bloud ſo long, till the bloud chaunge in colour, if ſo be the ſtrength of bodie in the patient, will beare it.
               2 In diſeaſes of the Lunges, Vena Axillaris, or the inner veine of the arme is to be opened, or if that appeare not, the common or middle veine: or for the more forcible reuultion, wee may take the veine in the hand, betweene the ring finger and the middle finger: or that veine which is betweene the ring finger and the little finger: Alwaies reſpecting rectitude of opening in the right veine.
               3 In inflammations &amp; diſeaſes of the Liuer, doo as is ſaid for the lungs Baſilica veine: obſeruing alwais rectitude of members.
               4 In inflammations &amp; diſeaſes of the ſplene do alſo as before, obſeruing the rectitude on the left ſide. If the diſeaſes be in the rames thē
                  ſelues, that they are inflamed: &amp; that the ſame inflammation bee but a beginning: open the inner veine, or Baſilica of the arme. If the inflā
                  mation be in his ſtate, or ſomewhat relenting, open the inner veine of the ham, or anckle. If the diſeaſes be beneth the rains, they are either diſeaſes of the wombe or belly, or of the bladder, or priuy parts: or of menſtruous termes, or of the Hemorroidae veines, thigh, or haunche.
               
                  
1 In diſeaſes of the wombe or belly, if the fluxe be a beginning, and that there is repletion in the body: open a veyne in the arme, to turne the fluxe an other waxe: when the fluxe is don, and the affect bee not remoued, open the inner veyne of the ham or anckle.
               2 In diſeaſes of the bladder, do euen ſo: both in their beginning and in their ſtate.
               3 In inflammation and diſeaſes of the priuie parts, doo likewiſe euen ſo.
               4 In reſtraint of termes, open the veyne of the ham or anckle, or ſcarrifie vpon the anckles.
               5 In termes immoderately flowing, open the veyne of the arme.
               6 In reſtraint of hemorroids, open a veyne in the hamme or ſhanke, which is from the knee downe to the ancklee.
               7 In immoderate fluxe of hemorroids, open the Baſilica in the arme.
               8 In paine or ach of the thigh or huckle bone (called Sciatica) firſt open the inner veyn of the arme, to pull backe the matter: afterward open the outward veyne of the anckle, to euacuate the ſame.
               Finally, remember alwaies that when ſulnes hath adioined with it in the body, corrupt humors, or that with increaſe of much bloud, there is alſo ſome euill and corrupted iuces: as happeneth in that fulnes which is onely Quo ad vires: and in continuall feuers, ioyned with

putrifaction: than wee are both to let bloud, and to purge, as was ſhewed before in Chapter, 4.

                     For euils that be wood and wild.
                     There beene veynes thirty and two:
                     For wile is many, that muſt be vndo.

                     And ſixteene beneath I you plight.
                     In what place they ſhall be found,
                     I ſhall you tell in what ſtound.
                     Beſide the eares there beene two,
                     That on a child mote beene vndoo:
                     To keepe his head from euill turning.
                     And from the ſcale withouten letting.
                     And two at the temples muſt bleede,
                     For ſtopping and aking I reede:
                     And one is in the mid forehead,

                     Aboue the noſe forſooth is one.
                     That for the frenſie mote be vndone.
                     
                        
Alſo when the eien beene ſore,
                     For the red gowt euermore,
                     And two other be at the eien end,
                     If they bleeden them to amend.
                     And the web that comes thorow ſmoking,

               A profitable obſeruation of the bloud extracted. Chap. 22.
               WHen the bloud floweth foorth of the woūd, the ſame is to be receiued in clean wiped porringers of earth, glaſſe, tinne, or ſiluer: not of braſſe, leſt the ſame cauſe alteration of the ſubſtance, colour, or other quallity of the bloud, and ſo our iudgement by that occaſion be peruerted &amp; corrupted. Of theſe little veſſels, there muſt be many in number, that in each of them, the varietie of the bloud may appeare and be ſeene: and they are to be ſet in a faire place, that no duſt, ſmoke, winde, or Sunne, come vnto them. The firſt obſeruation1. Subſtanti. is the ſubſtance of the bloud, which ſometime is viſcous, &amp; cleaueth to the fingers like glue;

this floweth out but ſoftly and ſlowly, becauſe it is thicke, and it quickly againe congeleth. This kind of bloud is the cauſe of obſtructions in the body, and of ſuch diſeaſes as are cauſed by obſtructions. That bloud which congealeth not ſo ſoon in the porringer, is thin bloud. And that which waxeth not hard, being cold: is watriſh and putrified bloud. Thicke &amp; viſcous bloud, and compacted hard, is hardly cut or diuided, &amp; thin bloud very eaſily: putried bloud not at all: but as ſoone as it is touched with ones finger, or a knife, it is torne &amp; rent (as it were) into ſmall pieces.
               
                  2. Serum. Whey, which is (as it were) a yellow water ſwimming on the bloud, wehn it is clodded. ſheweth eitherimmoderat drinking, or a weak Liuer, as in hidropicall perſons: or weaknes of the raines, and obſtruction of the ſame. For theſe diſeaſes cauſe aboundance of watry wheyiſh matter in the veines, mingled with the bloud. The thicke bloud is verie hardly imparted, or diſtributed among the ſmall veines: for thereby they would ſoone be obſtructed.
               
                  3. Spuma. Froth ſwimming on the bloud except the force of the fluxe haue cauſed it, declareth heat, and inflammation of that humour, which the colour expreſſeth. Red fome ſheweth bloud: yellowe fome choller: white fome

The colour of the congealed bloud, being very red in the top, ſheweth a good profitable qloud. The colour red and cleere, ſheweth hot bloud: as that of the arteries.

White colour commeth of good concoction, chiefly in thoſe that haue full ſtrength: whoſe vrins appeare well concoct, with moſt white reſidencies in the bottom. The bloud of ſuch perſōs in the veines through concoction waxe white. If the bloud be white in colour, &amp; viſcous in ſubſtance: it ſignifieth aduſt flegme, by reaſon of burning heat in the ſame. If it bee not viſcous, but thin &amp; wat
                     •
                  iſh, it ſheweth natural flegme. The beſt colour in bloud is red, inclining to a certaine obſcurity or darknes. Purple colour very thin &amp; cleer, ſheweth choler as Galen witneſſeth inpri. de Chriſi. If it be very dark, it betokeneth groſſe bloud. Greene bloud ſheweth perfect aduſtiō.
               
                  
When the bloud floweth ſoorthſpedely, it is ſuetile and thin: when it ſpinneth not foorth, but comes guttatim, ſlowly drop by drop: it betokeneth that it is groſſe bloud: when meanly betweene both, then is it a mean bloud, betweene groſſe and thin. Againe ſometime it is quickly congeled, then is it g roſſe bloud: ſomtime ſlowly compacted, and then is it ſubtile. Thicke and groſſe bloud, ſheweth thicke and groſſe matter in the bodie: or it ſheweth great heat and drith, which hath conſumed the humidity of bloud. If it be ſubtile &amp; thin, it ſheweth want of digeſtion, and abundance of raw, vnconcocted humours, of hot humours, or of cold, as the colour ſhall diſcrie.
               If the bloud be oily, it betokeneth either a future leproſie, or too much fatnes in the body: for leproſy is cauſed of extremity of heat in the bloud, burning the ſame, and conuerting it into an oily ſubſtance. Againe, take a bat round in the end, and ſet it to the congeled bloud, if it withſtand it not, but giue place vnto it, and bee diuided: it is an argument of drith. If the bloud greatly reſiſt the entrance of the bat, then is it a very thicke and viſcous bloud. If between both▪ then is it a meane bloud▪ And thus of the ſubſtance of the bloud, which ſhould haue bin inſerted before. And touching the colour in like ſort, this briefe obſeruation by the way, which was alſo omitted, but may come in

here yet in good ſort a good bloud is of diuers colours, according to the diuerſitie of the parts: for in the vpper parte and in the compaſſe of the veſſell, it is of a red colour: for the good bloud (being light) alwaies aſcendeth vp to the higher partes: in the middes it is red, and not cleere: in the bottom it is blacke and melancolious. For melancoly (being heauy) reſteth alwaies in the bottome.
               
                  
                     
                        •
                     . Pinguedo. Sometime there ſwimmeth on the toppe of the bloud a certaine fatte, or oily matter, like a copweb. If the body bee very groſſe and fat: this is cauſed of the verie bloud, which is in ſuch bodies inclining to fat. If the body be very leane, it declareth the ſame now to beginne8. Subſidentia. to melt, and to languiſh.
               In the bottom of the clodded bloud there is reſident an earthly &amp; a filthy ſubſtance, which being deuided, or clouen aſunder, appeareth in colour, either red, darke, blacke, bright, or greene: whereby we may coniecture the nature of the humour mixt with the bloud: yea &amp; by the colour much or little, we may know, how much ech humour aboundeth in the veines.
               Some ſay, if the bloud bee cut or deuided, &amp;7. Grana. that there bee found in the ſame, certaine grainees like ſmall ſande, that it noteth leproſie, or inclination vnto it: which alwaies hath not been found true by certaine that

haue obſerued it.
               It is ſildome, that the bloud comming from the veines, doth ſinke: but if it doo, the ſame ſheweth corrupt and ſtinking humours, and is a token of vncurable putrifaction and corruption.
               No man doth willingly taſt detracted bloud, but if by chaunce it come into the mouth, and doo taſt ſweet, it is according to nature, good, and of perfect concoction. If it bee bitter in taſt, it ſheweth aboundance of choller: if it be ſowre, ſharpe, and reſtringent, it denotateth aboundance of melancoly: if vnſauery, aboundance of flegme: if ſalt, the bloud is mixt with ſalt flegme. After obſeruation of the ſubſtāce and colour of the bloud, conferre all the ſmal porringers, or veſſels of bloud together. If they ſhew all equally good bloud, it is to be ſuppoſed that the reſt in the veines, is like vnto it. Yet the ſame is to bee withdrawen, if it offend in quantity, and greeue the body, hurting the ſences, and cauſing in the body putrifaction and other euils. If bloud appeare corrupt, then with a greater profit, the ſame is to be withdrawē, becauſe it hurteth the body two waies: both with the quantity and qualitie thereof. If it be not ſufficiently withdrawen at one time, afterward againe, a veine muſt be opened: and beſide bleeding, if Cacochymia concur with plenitud: that is, that bloud offend both in

quantitie and qualitie, as wee noted in the 21. Chapter: beſide bleeding, the body muſt more ouer be purged with inward medicine.
               If that bloud which came firſt were good, and the other corrupt: then ſuppoſe that yet much ſuch bloud remaineth in the bodie, to be auoided by good order of diet, and orderly euacuation. But if it fall out ſo in inflamations, it is a good ſigne that the euacuation is abſolute and perfect: quite taking away the matter of the diſeaſe from the affected member. The bloud poured into warme water, hath thereby his partes and ſubſtances deuided: the wheyiſh and watrìe ſubſtance is confounded with the water, and cannot be knowen from it. Alſo the thinner and more ſubtile part of the bloud is mingled with the water likewiſe: whereby yet notwithſtanding after a ſort, wee may giue iudgement of the nature of the humor. The thicker parte of the bloud reſteth in the bottome▪ which is reputed good and naturall bloud: if ſo be it be whitiſh, thinne, bright, and cohering together. If the ſame be more groſſe, it ſheweth the groſneſſe of the bloud that remaineth in the bodie. If it be obſcure, blacke, or otherwiſe coloured, after the difference of the colour, iudge the bloud to be corrupted, or not corrupted with 
                     •
                  ilthineſſe of wicked humors. If it do not cohere, but be diſtracted and diuided: it betokeneth

vncurable putrifaction.
               Laſt of all, remember that the more vnpure and vnconcocted the bloud appeareth, being altered from the nature of good bloud, the ſame is to be withdrawen in the leſſe quantitie, and not ſo plentifully, as when the ſame draweth more nigh the ſubſtance of good bloud: which is done otherwiſe, and quite contrarie by our common barbors and letters of bloud. And looke howe much the humors doe paſſe and exceede, either leſſe or more, the nature of bloud: ſo much more ſparingly, are wee to let bloud. And when they exceede too farre from the nature of bloud, either the one waie or the other: then wee are altogether to forbeare bleeding, as wee haue noted in a certeine place alreadie.
            
            
               A ſhort reherſall of eight auncient errours, touching bleeding, and a ſufficient confutation of them, by auncient authorities. Chap. 23.
               FIrſt, that bloud muſt not be let, but in the morning. This is confuted by Galen, lib. de Curand. ratio. per ſanguin. Miſsio. Capitul. 12. ſaying: Feare not to let bloud by night: forit is ridiculous that ſome doe maintaine: onely letting bloud, from the ſecond houre

of the daye, to the fifth or ſixth, and no other time.
               The ſecond errour is, that obſtruction and putrifaction, are the cauſes of letting bloud. Galen alſo confutes this 2. Metho. Med. cap. 14. in theſe wordes: Neither obſtruction, nor putrifaction is the cauſe of le
                     •
                  ting bloud, but abundance of humors: for neither can ſtopping, or putrifaction be cured by bleding, but require other remedies.
               The third error. That opening of a veine is vnn
                     •
                  edefull, except the diſeaſe be preſent. This alſo is confuted by Galen▪ de Opt. ſect. ad Thraſis, Cap. 37. For the moſt part (ſaith hee) we vſe remedies, as purgagion and bleeding, when the diſeas is not preſent but future.
               The fourth error. That Phlebotomy muſt be done in the iudgement day of a diſeaſe. Auicen impugneth this in quart. primi. chap. de Phlebo. ſaying: Neither muſt bleeding nor purgation be done, in the day of the mouing of a diſeaſe, nor when the ſame hath Criſim. 
                        •

               The fift error. That bleeding dulleth the ſight. Gallen remoueth this error, li. de Curand. ratio. per ſangui. miſsio. Chapitul. 7. Some haue a weake ſight, hauing aboundauce of bloud: Euacuate ſuch, either with purgation,

if there bee other humors beſide bloud, or by bleeding: and ſo detracting of bloud doth good, not dulling, but quickening the ſight.
               6 The ſixth error is, that in fulnes alwaies a veyne muſt bee opened. Gaben confu

               8 The eighth error is, That there is no difference of the times of the yeare, to let bloud in. Galen contrary to this, writeth ad Glanco. cap. 14. Thoſe Phiſitions which conſider not of the ſtate of the times, and withdraw bloud, they kill men. Et 4. de vict. in morb acut is Commentar. 19. If the Aire be too hote and dry, we refraine from bleeding, though the ſickenes bee vehement, and the age of the party youthfull.
            
            
               
               A ſufficient confutation of the ſuppoſed neceſsitie of annuall bleeding. Cap. 24.
               THere commeth here to my minde, a common opinion among the ignorant people, which do certeinly beleeue, that if any perſon be let bloud one yeare, he muſt be let bloud euery yere, or elſe he is (I cannot tell, nor they neither) in how great danger. VVhich fonde opinion of theirs: whereof ſo euer the ſame ſprong firſt: it is no more like to be true, than if I ſhould ſay: when a man hath receiued a great wound by chaunce, in any part of his body, whereby he looſeth much bloud: yet after it is healed, he muſt needs haue the like wounde againe there the next yeare, to auoid as much bloud, or els he is in daunger of great ſicknes, yea, &amp; alſo in haſard to loſe his life: which opinion (if I did affirme to be true) albeit it be moſt falſe: yet I might vſe the like reaſon &amp; authoritie to defend it, that the comon people vſe, in the defence of theirs. For they can ſay nothing, if they be asked, why they thinke ſo; but that they haue heard many to ſay ſo. Therefore I would wiſh, that no man ſhould credit this foliſh opinion, being moſt falſe, vnleſſe he can ſhew ſome good reaſon for it, which I am ſure no man can do.
               This I think, that like as bloud letting is not

good againſt al diſeaſes: ſo is it not good in all perſons (as we haue ſet it down in the 9 Chapter) but only in thoſe that wil be content to vſe afterward a moderat &amp; conuenient diet. Thoſe therefore that do abound with bloud, &amp; wil be let bloud to preſerue themſelues frō the danger of any diſeaſe that is like ſhortly to enſue, muſt long time after be content to vſe a moderat diet: For intemperat perſons &amp; gluttons, great drinkers &amp; wine bibbers; they doe not only receiue no commoditie at al by bleeding; but often times greater hurt, than if they had bin without it: For, within 3 or 4 dayes after, they fill &amp; ſtuffe them ſelues with more rawe iuices &amp; humors, by vnmeaſurable dyet, than they had before: and often times theſe die through convulſion.
               And hereupon we are to note, that there is ſuch force in moderat diet, to eſchew ſicknes, that without obſeruation thereof, Phlebotomy is to no purpoſe. And therefore if this cō
                  mon ſaying of the comō people be true in any▪ namely, that they muſt be let bloud oftē, th
                     •
                  r are once let bloud: it is only true in ſuch as keep ill diet preſently after bleeding. Therefore to conclude this Chapter, I councell al perſons to beware of exceſſe after opening of a veine.
            
            
               Ofinciſion of Arteries. Chap. 25.
               
                  
AS a veine is opened, according to our former diſcourſe hitherto: ſo ſomtime alſo an arterie is opened, that is to ſay, only ſuch a vein, wherein the vitall ſpirites mixed with the blod do runne &amp; flowe: but for the hard ſtinting of the fluxe from an arterie: Phiſicions are in doubt to make inſicion thereof: and yet ſome ſometime practiſe it (as in the diſeaſe called 
                     Ʋertigo.) If in opening of a veine, we chance to ſtick an arterie, we can very hardly by &amp; by ſtint the bleeding: and although the matter▪ fall out very well, that the wound or inciſion be brought to a skarre by diuiſion: yet there will be a dilation, or ſpreading abroad of the cut arterie ſtil: as Galen witneſſeth, lib. de Curand. ratio. per ſang. miſsio. Cap 21. &amp; 22.
               
               The bleeding of an arterie is hardly ſtayed: partly for the heat of the arterial bloud, which is very quickly moued, &amp; by ſpreading abroad, openeth the arterie, whereupon inciſion of an arterie greatly furthereth the bleeding partly, becauſe the motion of the arteries neuer ceaſeth, as Galen witneſſeth, lib. 2. Cap. 20. de Sanitate tuend. whereby alſo it commeth to paſſe, that the wounds of the arteries, are the more ſlowly cured. For ſuch things as are to be healed, require reſt &amp; eaſe, Gal. lib. 5. Cap. 8. metho▪ medend. &amp; commet. 6. lib. 6. Aphoriſ. The opening of an arterie is to be vſed, when the body is repleate with thinne, windie, and verie hote

                     at. per ſanguinis miſsio. being warned (ſaith Galer) by certeine dreames, of which, two among the reſt, moſt plainly appeared vnto mee: I we
                     •
                  t to cut that arterie of the right hande, which is betweene the forefinger and the thombe, and I let it bleede, till it ſtayed of it ſelfe: for 
                     •
                  o (ſaith Galen) I was warned by my dreame: and there fl owed out not a whole pound and the continuall paine ceaſed, that was ſpecially in that part where the Liuer lyeth in the midriffe. I knowe one long troubled with continuall paine in the ſide, freede thereof, by opening an arterie in the arme: the ſame alſo being attempted through the warning of a dreame.
               It is verie dangerous, either willingly or vn willingly, to cut the greater arterie vnder the veine in the arme, or vnder the veine in the hammes: For the bloud being thinne, hote, &amp;

forcebly iſſuing out, will hardly bee ſtopped, and many haue dyed of Gangraena, riſing in the member where the inciſion hath beene: as did a Gentleman of new Rumney in Kent, a yeare or two paſt: and ſo much the ſooner, commeth this putrifieng, rotting and mortification to the member, when the Phlebotomer goeth about with a band to ſtay Haemorrhagiam: That is the dangerous fluxe of the arteriall or vitall bloud. If the bloud bee ſtayed, the wound cannot bee brought to a skarre, without Aneuriſma: by reaſon of the continuall pulſe, and the thicke and hard tunicles in the ſame place. If neceſſitie ſo require, it is beſt to cut the whole greater artery ouerth wartly, for the bloud is ſooneſt ſtaid, when the ends and extremities of the artery cut aſunder bee pulled vp, whereon the plaiſter of Aloe before ſpoken of Cap. 19. is to be applied.
               VVithout theſe dangers we may cut the leſſer arteries, which are in the outwarde lims or members: as in the head, hands, and feete. For theſe may bee faſtened together, chiefly in ſoft, moiſt bodies, as of women and children. Theſe are opened in continuall and great paines, about the vppermoſt skinne of any member: which paine, is like a pricking, or kinde of ſhooting, becauſe of ſenſiblenes, and much feeling of the Membrana or outmoſt skinne: and it is therewithall a beating paine, by reaſon of the moouing

of the arteries. The cauſe of theſe pricking paines, is abundance of much thinne hot bloud, incloſed in the arteries of the pained place, and the ſame is taken away, when the outward arteries, are found out and cut, which proceede from thoſe inwarde affected members.
               Fewe in our daies cut arteries, becauſe they are not manifeſt to appeare in ſight, nor eaſie to come by. Arteries cut in the temples doo remedy, hote biting humors, and fluxes of the eies, in which caſes▪ theſe arteries are wholly cut, and burnt with an hote iron, or ſome burning medicine.
               Arteries behinde the eares are cut in ſwimmings, and continuall paines of the head, cauſed of winde and of heate: Alſo in rednes of the face, and in other long continuing affects of the head.
               The artery betweene the thombe and forefinger is opened with continuall paines of the ſides, betweene the bowels, and the Midriffe.
               An artery about the anckle is opened: in long continuing paines of the huckle bones, alwaies choſe that artery, which is direct to the affected member, as wee aduiſed before in opening of veynes.
            
            
               
               Of particuler euacuation of bloud, and firſt of bloudſuckers or horſeleaches. Chap. 26.
               TO this diſcourſe of opening a veyne, which is a generall euacuation of bloud, is to bee added, the particuler euacuation thereof, by leaches and ventoſas: whereof wee will briefly ſpeake in theſe two Chapters, and ſo conclude this our preſent Pamphlet.
               VVhen bloud is ſo in any member, that it cannot be pulled backe by opening of a veyne or by ſome other practiſe: the ſame is to bee withdrawen from the affected member, by ſuch remedies, as may outwardly abide vpon the griefe, and ſo free the ſame of the preſent euill. Of this ſort are Leaches. Launſing, cupping or boxing: which apparantly drawe bloud, from the member affected.
               Leaches or bloudſuckers, are wormes found in waters, which applied outwardly to the member, draw forth bloud: They make a three ſquare wound, which penetrateth not only the skinne, but alſo more deepely if the skinne bee tender▪ (as is the skin of children and infants.) Theſe being empty and well applied, ſucke out bloud greedily and ſafely, and that ſo long, till they ſwell with fulneſſe, and ſo fall off: And ſometime when they are off, the bloud ſtill followeth plentifully, eſpecially if they were fixed

vpon ſo open and manifeſt veyne: In which caſe, they ſtand in ſteede of Phlebotomy. Thus applied to the hemeroide veynes, ſometime they doo ſo prouoke bloud, that to ſtoppe the ſame, we are neceſſarily forced to vſe thinges aſtringent: yea, and applied to the arme of children, they are equall to bleeding: And that extraction which is thus drawen from a hollo we veyne, is to bee accounted for an vniuerſall euacuation. But when they are fixed to the hard skinne vnder which there is no great veyne, they onely empty that place that theſe touch: extracting very litle from the neerer parts, and nothing at all from the members far off. And therefore leaches are onely vſuall in corruptions of the vppermoſt skinne: as in the ſcab in 
                     Ʋitiligo, which is a fowlenes of the body with ſpots of diuers colours, whereof are three kinds: In Impetigo a diſeaſe which wee call the Ringworme. In the diſeaſe called Panus, which after Celſus is a kind of kernell growing in the grind of a man, or behinde his eares: In rednes of the noſe and face, and little ſwellinges in leaprous perſons. So oftentimes wee apply them to the Arſe-hole called Anus, againſt melancholly diſeaſes, cauſed of the ſtopping of hemorroids. In ſcabs, itch, and wicked wounds, they are very profitable: the body beeing firſt euacuated by letting of bloud. Yea, the drawing of horſeleaches is more conuenient in fulnes of bloud,

than ſcarrifieng is: Foraſmuch as they fetch bloud more deepely, and alſo that which is withdrawen by Leaches, is more of the ſubſtance of bloud: Albeit the opinion of ſome is, that they drawe no bloud, but corrupt bloud; and ſuch as is not agreeable, and proportionable vnto our bodies. And therefore in griefes which happen betweene the skin and the fleſh, of bloud corrupted, theſe are more conuenient than ſcarrifieng.
               The attracting of bloud by Ventoſas and horſeleaches, hath this difference: that theſe drawe more deepely from the body: Ventoſas but from the ſuperficiall partes. Therefore let Leaches bee applyed to thoſe places, from whence we would drawe humors more deepely.
               Their vſe and application is this: Firſt, before they bee put to any part of the body, they muſt be kept all one day before, and nouriſhed with a little bloud, which wee may giue them in a little piece of freſh fleſh: then we muſt put them, and keepe them in cleane water, ſomewhat warmed: and before we vſe them, with a ſpunge wipe away the skinne that is about them: Rubbe the part of the member affected whereto you will apply them with ſalt: or ſcratch the ſame till it looke red: or annoint the ſame with a little freſh bloud. Some lay on them a ſpunge, that when they be full, they may

fall away. They are with moſt ſafety let downe in a reede or a pipe to the affected member, leſt they might touch together, and ſo by that meanes of ende thoſe partes that are ſounde and whole. And firſt before you apply them, ſo preſſe them and wring them out, that they may vtter and caſt forth all their venome, ſo as their backes bee greene, and their bellies reddiſh.
               VVee are to chooſe ſuch Leaches as are not in fowle troubled blacke waters: nor ſuch as haue long rayes or ſtrikes in them, like roddes: called Hyrudines Ʋirgulatae. Nor ſuch as are of the colour of Lapis Lazulus: for theſe are venemous. But wee are to chooſe them, that bee redde, inclining to the colour of the Lyuer, hauing two redde lines or ſtrikes: or inclining to a certaine greenneſſe, hauing little heads, and beeing very ſlender, and had out of cleare flowing waters. Let them not bee blacke, nor hauing a certaine white hearineſſe vppon them, as wee ſee there is vppon certaine hearbes as Clarie, and vppon certaine fruites, as vpon the Quince: but (as yee heard before) take ſuch as haue greene backes, and red bellies.
               To make them fall off if neede require, put to their heads Salt, Lyme, Duſt, Aſhes, or Vinegar: ſtrawe any of theſe vppon them, and they will fall away, if you will haue them

off ſooner, put a horſe haire betweene their mouthes and the place, and drawe them away: when they are off, waſh the place with a ſpunge. To

If you will keepe them longer, put in the ſame water ſome Lambes bloud; or ſuch like, that ſo they may be kept aliue ſome ſeaſon. For further matter herein, I referre thee to Galen, who hath written a booke De Hirudinibus: That is of Bloudſuckers.
            
            
               
               Of Cupping, or boxing &amp; ſcarification, the other two particular euacuations of bloud. Chap. 27.
               FOraſmuch as it is not conuenient to be let bloud oft times in the yeare: for that much of the vitall ſpirit paſſeth forth with the bloud, and that the blould being taken away, the body waxeth colde, and the operations of nature become weake and enfeebled (as we haue before in a certeine place declared:) therefore I counſell (ſaith Galen) that the baſer partes of the bodie, as the legges, be boxed or cupped, which is the moſt ſure remedie, as well to conſerue health, as to repaire the ſame being decayed.
               For it cureth the eyes annoyed with long diſtillations. It profiteth alſo the head, &amp; vpper partes of the bodie, as the breſt and backe, and againſt ſundrie other diſeaſes. For in what member ſo euer the bloud is gathered, the bodie being firſt purged by cupping, the griefe may be cured. Alſo Oribaſius affirmeth, that it helpeth Quincies in the throat: diſſolueth ſtoppings of all places. Notwithſtanding application of boxes about the ſtomack, in hote feuers, where reaſon is troubled, are to be eſchewed, for feare of ſuffocation. Likewiſe, put vnto the head vndiſcreetly, they hurt both

the head and the eyes.
               Boxing helpeth ſwellings, letteth foorth winde, ſtoppeth immoderate Termes, and the bloudie flixe: helpeth appetite: when a woman ſowneth, it reuiueth her 
                     •
                  pirites againe. It draweth foorth water: aſſwageth hard ſwelling: clenſeth Melancolie, and that chiefely in weak bodies. It will remoue humors from place to place: as from the head to the necke: from the neck to the ſhoulders.

VVhich effectes ſhall hereafter be reheaſed, with their cures by this practiſe more particular.
               There are three cauſes which perſwade vs

to vſe this practiſe, and to refraine letting of bloud.
               Firſt, becauſe our purpoſe is to euacuate from ſome one member, and not from another: and therefore particular euacuation is done by boxing or Cucurbitulas, which they that follow barbarous authors in Pinſicke doe alſo call 
                     Ʋentoſas. Nowe particular euacuation cannot be made by Phlebotomy: for the ſame euacuateth and emptieth from the whole bodie.
               Secondly, becauſe the ſtrength is weake, or the age vnfit to bleed: or that there is ſome other of thoſe impediments ſpoken of in the 8 Chapter. For as Rhazes ſayeth in 7 Ʋentoſas drawe bloud but from the little veines: and therefore the heat and ſpirites are thereby but a little dimini
                     •
                  hed: whereas opening of a veine greatly debilitateth nature, drawing from the greater veines with the bloud, much heat &amp; vitall ſpirites.
               Thirdly, becauſe our intent is to euacuate onely from the baſer members. Bleeding euacuateth from the moſt noble members, and greater veines: 
                     Ʋentoſas from the meane members, and little ſmall veines, which arein the outward bodily partes, and lye without the greater veines.
               Of boxings there are two ſortes, the one gentle without ſcarification or launcing: the

other with ſcarification, which both in ſteede of bloud-letting are vſed, when age, debilitie, the time of the yeare, or other conſiderations will not permit the op ening of a veine. Hereby is produced the thinne bloud next the skinne: and being preſently vſed after ſcarification, when little inciſions and holes are made in the member, that bloud and humors may eaſily come foorth: it mightily withdraweth by force and flame of heat, not onely the thinne &amp; flowing humors and ſpirites which are about the member after ſcarifying, but alſo that which is in places further diſtant. If the skinne (I ſay) be firſt exaſperated with the Iron, it doth this that wee heare ſpeake of more manifeſtly. If the skinne be whole and not ſcarified, it prouoketh bloud and humors from the furtheſt parts into the skinne, and bringeth it to that parte, whereunto the cupping boxes are applyed. The cupping glaſſe infixed (the skinne being incided or launced) purgeth the outmoſt parts of the body more mightily, than if to the affects wee onely vſed either ſcarification, or only leches.
               Boxings without ſcarification, which are called eaſie cuppings, do not apparantly withdrawe bloud, but only the ſpirites: yet it doth pull backe vnto it humors, and forcible fluxes: and applyed to the contrarie part, it ſtayeth effuſion of bloud in any place whereſoeuer:

chiefely, when infirmitie of ſtrength will not permit revulſion, by opening of a veine. Moreouer it ſtayeth fluxes of the wombe, or of humors: and applyed to the member where the fluxe of humors is, it turneth the ſame anothet way. Alſo, it prouoketh outwardly that fluxe of humors which lyeth deep in the bodie: &amp; therfore it ſerueth as a remedie in aſtoniſhmentes, palſies, &amp; in veterat paines: it waſteth winde &amp; ſpirites, included in any member: and therefore quickly ſtayeth tremblings or pantings of the heart, or elſe-where within the bodie, the hicket, colick, &amp; paines of the raines. And this preſent kind of remedie, is without daunger: neither hurting the bodie, nor weakening the ſtrength.
               That eaſie &amp; light boxings are beſt for revulſion, as to pull back Termes, appeareth by Hippo. 5. Aphoriſ. Aphoriſ. 50. Simulieri menſtrua ſistere volueris, Cucurbitulam quam maximam, ſub mammis defige. If thou wouldſt ſtay Termes in a woman, apply a good great cupping glaſſe neare or aboue her pappes. And Galen. 5. lib. Ther. Metho. with eaſie boxing, applyed Hypocondiis. i. the ſides &amp; ſhort ribbs, aboue the nauill, where the Liuer lyeth on the right ſide, and the Splene on the left: affirmeth bleeding at the noſe to be ſtayed, being applyed on the Liuer, or right Hypocondrion, if the fluxe come foorth of the right noſthrill, and on

the left Hypocondrion, and on the Splene: if from the left, and vpon them both, if it proceed from both the noſthri's.
               Againe, gentle cupping is vſed in ſuch perſons as are alreadie euacuated, in ſtuffed bodies, wee vſe them not, nor in inflamed members, nor in the beginning of other affectes, but where as nothing elſe hath beene before, or where the bodie hath beene alreadie euacuated.
               In this caſe of revulſion by cupping without ſcarification, as in fluxe of Termes, as ye heard out of Hippo, and in fluxe of bloud from the noſe, as ye heard out of Galen, be verie circumſpect to apply the cupping glaſſes on the member ſet ouer againſt the place, from whēce wee purpoſe to pul-backe, according to rectitude of poſition: that the place cupped may haue agreement with the place, from whence wee purpoſe to reuoke. Otherwiſe wee doe no good, as we ſhewed before, ſpeaking of revulſion in bleeding, Chap. 6.
               Againe, gentle cupping is vſed without ſcarification, when wee will drawe humors from deepe and inward partes of the bodie to the outward members. Therefore Galen. 13. Method. Medend. ſaith: that it is caeteris attractiuis fortius: ſtronger than any other attractiues: thus in harde apoſtumations, it draweth the matter outward: yea, and by it, hard apoſtumations

may be remoued, if generall euacuation haue gone before, according as the fulneſſe in the patient requireth.
               Againe, it is vſed without ſcarification when we ſtay any member, or bring a member to his proper place. Thus when the bowels fal down, we applie 
                     Ʋentoſas aboue the bellie, to reteine them or bring them back.
               Alſo, it is vſed without ſcarification, to diſſolue windines, as in the collick: ſo a cer em fat woman troubled with the collick, tooke two narrow mouthed pots, &amp; did put them magret braſen veſſel, &amp; ſhe did put the veſſel of braſſe to the fire, &amp; afterward applyed the two hot pots to her bellie: firſt couering the ſame with alynnen cloth, &amp; ſo ſhee was healed.
               Item, it is vſed without ſcarification to mittigate paines, &amp; that in all apoſtumations and colliks generally, whether the ſame be cau

Alſo when the parts are filled with ſharp matter, or outwardly infected with venome: or when we will draw the matter from one member to another. Alſo, it is vſed with ſcarification in ſharpe diſeaſes, when the ſtrength is weake, and nature not able to tollerate bleeding. And thus you haue heard, in what caſes boxing is vſed without ſcarifying, &amp; with ſcarifying, which is a worthie and profitable obſeruation.
               The difference betweene 
                     Ʋentoſas &amp; Phlebotomy is, that Phlebotomy euacuateth the groſſe bloud, and the other ſubtile and thinne bloud. Againe Ventoſas are called attraction per vacuum, and differeth frō attractions made by medicine, or not made per vacuum. Attractiue medicines which do purge, attract &amp; euacuat ſome certeine determined humor. Phlebotomy all the humors indifferently, and Ventoſas, or attraction per vacuum, that humor that is moſt ſubtile and thinne among them all in that part.
               The difference betweene the attraction made by 
                     Ʋentoſas, and that made by leaches is this: that the leaches drawe humors from the profound and deepe places, and 
                     Ʋentoſas but from the ſuperficiall partes.
               Item, fat perſons are not to vſe cupping: for it is with them, as with water pypes in the ground, which being filled and ſtopped with

earth or other matter, ſtay the water courſe that it cannot run: ſo the veynes in the body, are like thoſe water pipes, and are ſometime ſo filled with fleſhy fat, that the bloud cannot haue his courſe thorow them, and therefore the veynes in fat folke, beeing either ſo ſtrict, or ſo ſtopped, the Ventoſas cannot withdrawe from them, but with great violence: and if they attract any thing, it is the moſt ſubtile bloud, the groſſe bloud cannot paſſe thorow the ſtopped places.
               Concerning the time, they are not to bee vſed at the new of the moone, becauſe then the humors are quiet, and ſo hardly drawen, nor in the laſt quarter: for this ſeaſon being cold, the humors are not eaſily attracted: but in the middle ſeaſon: when the humors are flowing, and are not too colde: and vſe them in the third houre of the day, for then by reaſon of heate, the poores are opened, and the bloud beeing then eaſily mooueable, is with the more facility attracted to the members, and from the members,
               After bathings we are not to vſe them, for there were to bee feared, too great a fluxe of bloud, yet if we can perceiue the bloud to bee too groſſe, wee may to ſubtiliate the ſame, vſe bathing before in ſuch a caſe, as was ſaide in the rules of Phlebotomy.

               Boxing without ſcarrification are vſed, to reuoke and pull backe matter, called before revulſion: or to turne bloud and humors aſide, which was called deriuation, cap. 6.
               Thus cupping reuoketh bloud at the noſe, as yee heard aboue out of Galen, by applying the Ventoſas vnto the ſides: that is, vpon the Lyuer and right ſide, if out of the right noſethrills, &amp; contra, as before.
               Thus we ſtoppe fluxe of termes, applying a great cupping-glaſſe to the roote of the Paps, as ye heard out of Hyppocrates.
               
               Thus the falling downe of the wombe or matrix, is reuoked by application of the cupping-glaſſe, neere to the nauill.
               
                  Thus to reuoke matter from the head,
                  we apply them, to the inſide of the Thigh: where note, that this better prouoketh termes, than the opening of Saphena vein.
                  Thus againſt ſtopping of termes,
                  we apply them, to the inſide of the Thigh: where note, that this better prouoketh termes, than the opening of Saphena vein.
                  Thus againſt ſtopping of hemorroids,
                  we apply them, to the inſide of the Thigh: where note, that this better prouoketh termes, than the opening of Saphena vein.
               
               
                  
Cupping-glaſſes are not vſed for deriuation ſake: that is, to turne bloud &amp; humors aſide another way, except when the body is firſt euacuated, or when the humors are ſetled in any part, and that the member is ſwollen, in this caſe, for deriuation ſake, we apply Ventoſas to the hinder part of the necke than to the partes called Spatulae, which ioine to the necke; ſometimes alſo to the but tocks and haunches.
               Boxing with ſcarrification is vſed, when ſome euacuation of bloud is required, ſtanding in ſteede of Phlebotomy (as we ſaid before) when certaine occaſions hinder the ſame. Firſt, in this practiſe wee apply the Ventoſas to the member. Afterward we open that very part, in many places in the skinne onely, with a ſmall penknife, for the purpoſe, and ſo applying the glaſſes againe, wee euacuate bloud. But wee muſt not doo this before the body bee firſt euacuated, chiefly in vncleane and corrupt bodies, leſt too great abundance of humors bee drawen into that part. Boxing with Scarrification is vſed, either in the vpper partes, in the middle partes, or the lower partes of the body.
               Cupping-Glaſſes applyed to the forepartes of the heade: offende the Senſes and vnderſtanding. Applyed on both the middle partes of the necke, or vppon Nucham Puppis: they ſtande in ſteede of opening 
                     Ʋena Nigra,
                  
and they helpe heauineſſe of the browes, and lighten the eie-lids: they helpe ſcabbines of the eies: they cauſe both the Parent and the childe begotten by him, to bee forgetfull. 
                     Ʋuerkerus.
               
               
                  
                     Ʋentoſas applyed to the lower part of the neckwhich is called Acheal ſtandeth in ſteed of opening Baſilica: they helpe pains of the ſhoulders and gullet: that is, the place whereby meate and drinke paſſeth into the ſtomacke: they helpe diſeaſes of the breaſt, cauſed of bloud: the crampe cauſed of bloud, and trembling of the heart.
               
                  
                     Ʋentoſas applyed to the vpper part of the necke: that is, the very ioyning together of the head and necke: are in ſteed of opening Cephalica, and helpe in affects of the head, as the ſhaking, and particuler palſie of the head: yea, and in affects of the parts of the head, and therfore it profiteth for toothach: paines of the eies and eares: but there muſt goe before purging of the whole body: leſt matter bee drawen vp againe to the heade, and fill the ſame, and ſo the diſeaſes increaſe againe: as Galen ſaith, 13. Method. Medend. cap. 4. we muſt beware here in this caſe, not to apply them thus too oft, becauſe they hurt the memory.
               VVhere as a litle before we ſpake of an applicatiō, which ſerued in ſteed of Baſilica: ſo we ſay now that Ventoſas applied aboue Spondiles,
                  
ſerueth alſo in ſteede of Baſilica, and cleanſeth the breaſt: and yet hurteth the mouth of the ſtomacke, and cauſeth trembling of the heart: and therefore they are ſubiect to theſe diſeaſes, muſt beware howe they vſe them, and yet according to Rhaſes. 2. ad Almonſon. It helpeth in trembling of the heart, cauſed of repletion and with heate. But it ſhould ſeeme, that either Rhaſes meant of application of 
                     Ʋentoſas to the lower part of the necke, called Acheal, which indeede (as we ſaid before) helpeth trembling of the heart. So confounding this application with the former. VVhich the rather may ſo ſeeme, becauſe it is ſaid: that they both ſerue in ſteede of Baſilica: or els (that this application hurteth the heart) is ignorantly added, and put to of ſome vndiſcrete writer.
               
                  
                     Ʋentoſas applyed to or vnder the chinne, helpeth the teeth, the face and the throat, clenſeth the heade and the Iawes: eſpecially they cleanſe the face from ſcabs and itch.
               
                  
                     Ʋentoſas applyed in the ioyning together of Spatula with the necke, profiteth in paſſions of the face, as ſcab or itch, and in ſtincke of the mouth. It may be, that this application is euen the ſelfe ſame which immediatly went before. And thus much of particuler application of Ventoſas, to the vpper parts.
               Now of their application to the middle parts of the body, applyed between the two Spatula:
                  
his hands, or hath allanderous tongue, &amp; can do they help diſeaſes of the breſt cauſed of bloud, and a crampe comming of the ſame caſe, and in theſe two, this application agreeth with that, to the lower part of the necke, before called Acheal: but this laſt application, hath two diſcommodities: for they weaken the ſtomack, and cauſe trembling of heart. VVhere note, that this application ſeemeth one and the ſelfe ſame, with that Super ſpondiles, and ſo it is true, that was there ſaide, concerning the offence of the ſtomacke and heart thereby.
               
                  
                     Ʋentoſas applyed aboue or vppon the raines, helpe apoſtumations and puſhes of the thighs or haunches, ſcabs, gowt, and hemorroids, leproſie, windines of the bladder, &amp; matrix, itchings of the back, and all diſeaſes of the lower parts.
               
                  
                     Ʋentoſas, applyed vnder thoſe parts called in Latine Cauillas, otherwiſe Alchahab, helpeth ſtopping of termes: the gowt in the feete, and the Sciatica gowt, and thus of application to the middle parts.
               Thirdly, concerning their application to the lower parts. 
                     Ʋentoſas applyed aboue or vppon the thighs, or rather the ſhanke from the knee to the anckle: which part of the leg in Latin is called Crus, they ſtande in ſteede of Phlebotomy: they mundefie the bloud, prouoke termes, and are better than the opening of Saphena, to prouoke termes, in white, ſoft, and weake women.
               
                  
                  
                     Ʋentoſas applyed to the former part of Coxa: That is, the Thighes or Haunches, helpeth apoſtumations of the teſticles and woundes of the Thighes, Haunches, and Shanks applyed to the hinder part thereof, they helpe apoſtumations of the Arſe, and Buttocks: and goinges out of the fundament, and blames, and puſhes in the ſame part.
               
                  
                     Ʋentoſas applyed betweene the two Anches: That is, hypsor buttocks: helpeth the two Anches: and the two inner partes of the thighs or h

                  unches. Alſo the hemorroids: the gowt in the fecte: and ruptu

                  iuie parts of men or women.
               
                  
                     Ʋentoſas applyed vpon the buttockes, attract from the whole body, and the heade, and helpeth the bowels: alſo they helpe corruption of menſtruous termes, and by meanes thereof lighten the body.
               
                  Ventoſas applyed vnder the ham behinde the▪ knee, helpe beating &amp; ſhaking in the hams, cauſed of an hot humor: alſo wicked puſhes, &amp; corrupt vlcers in the ſhanks, &amp; in the feet: and thus much of the particuler application of cupping or boxing glaſſes.
               There is another kind of boxing that we haue not here to deale withall: neceſſary and good ſometime to bee vſed, as for example ſake: If you haue any ſawſie Lowt, or loytering Lubber in your houſe, that is either too buſie of

nothing but play one of the parts of the foure and twenty orders of knaues, there is no pretier medicin for this, nor ſooner prepared, than boxing is, three or foure times wel ſet on a ſpan long on both the cheeks: &amp; althogh perhaps this wil not alter his lubberly conditions, yet I aſſure you, it will for a time change his knauiſh complexion, and helpe him of the greene ſickenes: and euery man may practiſe this, as occaſion ſhall ſerue in his owne houſe to reforme them.
               Becauſe as we haue ſaide, boxing is often vſed together with launcing: therefore a word or two of ſcarrification and ſo an end.
               Launcing is done with a Lancelot or ſome inſtrument called in Greeke Epidermes: and in Latine Scalpellum. The member is cut by little and litle with this Chyrurginall inſtrument, ometime it ſtriketh but the very skinne: ſometime it goeth in deeper. It euacuateth onely out of the diuided member, except by hap it wound and hurt the veyne. Scarrification cauſeth the humor vnderneath to paſſe forth, not forcibly extracting any thing from places diſtant and further off: and the deeper the Inſtrument goeth in, the more aboundant is the effuſion of bloud: It ſerueth to purge the skin, and helpeth thoſe affects which Leaches doo cure: and thoſe which are in the skinne, and ſticke ſtifly vnto the ſame: As old inflamations of corrupt matter, as the diſeaſe called Scirchus mentioned

before as Gangraena, a cankerous mortification of a member, or part of a member: as Sphacelus, which is when any part or member is mortified, thorow inflamation and ſuch like, in which diſeaſes, naturall heat beeing (as it were) choked vp, and ſtrangled, deſireth (as it were) to bee winnowed. VVhere note, that Launſing doth more plentifully draw bloud, if preſently vpon it, boxing bee vſed, as was partly ſignified before.

               A principall rule and obſeruation.
               AS in other thinges, ſo in bloudletting the cauſe is firſt skilfully and circumſpectly to be conſidered, as that it bee to purge the body of ſome vnnaturall, naughty, and ſuperfluous humor, whoſe ſubſtance is either ſimple, or mixt: Simple, when it doth of it ſelfe without the admixture of any other degenerate, as bloud doth when it putrifieth in the veyne, the Pores being ſtopped: mixt, when it is mingled with ſome that is already corrupted, as in the dropſie, where the bloud is mixt with water

The cauſe beeing thus allowed, and certainely knowen for needefull and good to the Patient otherwiſe letting of bloud is very dangerous, and openeth a way to grieuous infirmities, as ye haue heard in this treatiſe.
               
                  There remaineth to be conſidered, how it ſtandeſh with the Patient.

                        The Moone being in ♉. ♊. ♌. ♍▪ or the laſt half of ♎. and firſt of ♍.
                        The Sunne, the Moone, or lorde of the Horroſcope being in the ſ
                              •
                           gne that ruleth that member.
                        The Moone being in any parte of via lactea, or in via combuſta, or in domo caſus ſui, or being vacua or tarda curſu, or in terminis infortuniorum, or in the duodenarial diuiſion of the 12. houſes, placed either in 1. 6. 8. or 12. place thereof, or applying to the lord of the houſe.
                        The d

                           y before the day it ſelf: the day after the chāge of the Moon.
                        Halfe a naturall day, that is 12. hours before &amp; as many houres after the quarters of the Moone.
                        A day before &amp; a day after the full of the Moone.
                        A day before &amp; a day after the coniunction, quartile oppoſition of the ☽ with ♄ or ♂.
                        A day before the coniunction of the ☽ with ☿. ♀. or the head or the taile of the Dragon infortunate, and euill.
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                  The conuenienſt time of the yere.

                        For the Sanguine: the Moone being in any of the ſignes.
                        For the cholericke: the Moone being in ♋. or ♓.
                        For the Melancolick: in ♒. and firſt halfe of ♎.
                        For Flegma
                              •
                           ick: the Moone being in ♈. or ♐. Howbe
                              •
                           t ſome commend ♋. ♒. and ♓. for bloud letting.
                     
                  
               
               
                  Alſo the best &amp; moſt laudible aſpectes for this purpoſe are theſe, according to our ſoundeſt writers.

                        The coniunction of the Moone with ♃. or ♀. are ſimply the beſt: ſo that ♀. bee not combuſt.
                        The △. or ⚹. of the ☽. with ♃. ☉. ♀. and ☿. are good: but eſpecially with ♃. or ☿.
                        The ♊. or ☍. of the ☽. with ♃. or ♀. doth well.
                        The △. or ⚹. of the ☽. with ♂. are indifferent good.
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                  The time of the Moneth for

                        Youth: from the chaunge to the firſt quarter.
                        Middle age: from the firſt quarter to the full.
                        Elderly age: from the full to the laſt quarter.
                        Old age: from the laſt quarter to the chaunge.
                     
                  
               
               A reaſon of this rule is: Like reioyſeth in his like. Howbeit as we haue taught in this Treatiſe no childe would bee let bloud before fourteene yeares of age▪ nor olde man after threeſcore and ten, vnleſſe his ſtrength be the greater and ſomewhat more than ordinary, at thoſe yeares.
               
                  
                     5 The time of the daie.
                  The time of the day muſt be either

                        Morning: after the riſing of the Sun, when a man is yet faſting: which is ſimply the beſt, excepting the houres of ♂. and ♄▪ and chooſing the houres of ♃▪ and ♀. whoſe nature is moſt temperate.
                        Afternoone: after reaſonable good, or rather perfect digeſtion and expulſion of of ſuperfluities.
                     
                  
               
               
                  
Herewithall regard muſt be had of the aire, that it bee neither too hote, nor too colde: or clowdy: but milde, cleare, and temperate: the wind being then either Northerly or weſterly. The Southwind is counted no friend to Phlebot
                        •
                     my: whereof this is the reaſon, heate looſeneth too much: cold bindeth too much.
               
                  An Exception.
                  NOtwithſtanding the premiſſes of bloudletting before: The Frenſie, Squinancie, Plureſie, and Apoplexie, or for a continuall headach proceeding of choler or bloud, for any hote burning Feuer, or other extreme paine and deſperate diſeaſe: A man in ſuch a caſe may not tarry a choſen time regularly ſet downe by the Aſtronomer or Phiſition: for ſo the Patient might miſcarry in the meane ſeaſon. But incontinently with all conuenient ſpeede, hee is this way to ſeeke his remedy: except either he bee very weake, or like to ſowne, or that the Moone bee in the ſame ſigne that ruleth that very part of the body. VVhere alſo note, that in the foreſaid caſe of extremity, bloud is not to bee let in ſo great a quantity as otherwiſe it would, if a choſen time might conueniently be expected.
                  As before bloudletting theſe circumſtances of complexion, age, and times are to be conſidered▪
                     
So after the ſame, conſideration is to be had of our meats and exerciſe.
                  For meates ſuch muſt bee taken as are of an eaſie and light digeſtion.
                  For exerciſe wee are to abſtaine from all excluſiue, vntill the fourth day, not onely thoſe that be vehement: as riding, running, leaping, vawting, wraſtling, fenſing, tenniſe, &amp;c. But alſo ſuch as are more milde, as walking, bowling, bathing, and eſpecially Venerie: whereof wee haue ſpoken in the twentith Chapteer: and I doubt not but I may effectually conclude, (both antecedent and conſequent limitations duely and orderly obſerued) this auncient practiſe of Phlebotomy to bee very commendable both for the preſeruatiue and curatiue intention of Phiſicke.
               
               
                  Concluſio Operis.
                  And thus according to my ſimple skill, and poore talent, I haue ſet downe thoſe remedies, which withdraw bloud, either from the whole body generally, as Phlebotomy: or from certain parts particulerly, as Leeches, boxing, and ſcarrification: which was my purpoſed determination at the beginning to doo. If any thing bee here ſet down repugnant to ſound skill, I craue pardon, hauing no skill to iudge, becauſe Phiſicke is not my profeſſion: onely drawen with

a delight in this practiſe: Firſt, for my pleaſure, now (I truſt) for orhers profit, I haue further trau
