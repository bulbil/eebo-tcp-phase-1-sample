            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

               MY Lord, I may perhaps bee thought, besides the boldnesse, to be guilty of absurdity; in offering a Translation to him, who so exactly understandeth the Originall; and one, who if hee had a minde to see how it would looke in English (were able to s
                     •…
                  t a much fairer glosse upon it, then I have done: yet my Lord, this absurdity may have a good colour; for it may not be unpleasing to you, to see your owne perfection, in the glasse of anothers imperfection, seeing even the best Diamonds, seeme to take a pleasure in having of foiles. Besides, I have my choice of another colour, for being to passe a world of
               
               hazard, in the Censure of the world; I am willing to passe the Pikes at first, and account this done, having once passed yours. And towards it my Lord, I have two Comforts; One for the Reader; that the Authours Gold, is so much over waight, that though much be lost in the melting, yet it holds waight enough still, to make it be currant. The Other for my selfe; that by this meanes I may have a Testimony remaining in the world, how much I honour you; and in how high a degree, I most affectionately am,

                  THE LETTERS of Mounsieur De BALZAC.
                  
                  
                     To Mounsieur Moreau, Counsellor to the King, and Lievtenant of PARIS. LETTER. I.
                     
                        SIR, I comē to renew my old importunity, and require your Authority, to call the Printers of Paris to account: They have set forth, in my name, certaine Letters, which I acknowledge to be mine, and deny not to father; but yet I ought to have beene of counsell to them, considering I never meant they should gadde about the streets. By this meanes, when I thinke

I am in my Closet, I finde my selfe upon the Stage; they carry me abroad, when I desire to be private, and what I intended an inclosure to my Friends, they lay in common for all the Country. You know Sir, that this kinde of writing hath alwayes beene priviledged; and that many things are entrusted to the bosome of Letters, which neither curiosity, nor hatred ought to prye into: nor ever will, if that be any thing discreete; This, any thing generous. An Enemie in warre, that neither spares mens goods nor lives, yet makes a conscience of opening Letters; and the law of secrets, seemes more forcible than the law of Armes: Yet so unfortunate am I that what an Enemy will not offer in Warre, I suffer in Peace; and that by men, that would be thought to have no thought of doing me hurt. I have nothing so properly mine, which they thinke not as properly theirs; Nothing kept so close, which they bring not to light. If hold could bee layd on intellectuall things, they would dive (I thinke) into the very thoughts of my heart: but since 
                           〈◊〉
                         armes are too short for this, they snatch them from me, assoone as ever I have made them sensible, and given them a body upon paper; in such sort Sir, that I should not dare to write my very Auricular Confession, for feare they should put it in Print, and make it be cryed upon the Exchange; and I must be forced at last, either to renounce all commerce in this kinde, or at least to invent some strange unknowne Characters to speake in secret, and to preserve my conceits

from their Arresting. They arrogate to themselves a more soveraigne power than Princes do, who alwayes leave to private men, the free use of that which is theirs, and never offer to make a High-way of my Garden, nor a thorow-fare of my Court-yard. This is a disorder, whereof the consequence reflects upon you, and wherein you are more interrested, than my selfe; for I do not beleeve, you would be willing to see those excellent discourses which I have heard you make to your Auditours, bee disfigured by an uncorrected Impression; and it would grieve you, that prophane hands should touch them without choyce or discretion, and thereby marre their lustre, and defile their purity. I therefore humbly intreate you in this point to take care of your selfe, and to do your selfe right: The boldnesse of these mercenary persons is not restrained by Respect, it must have a stronger Bridle; and if you give it not a stoppe by feare of punishment; neither our Closets, nor our Beds will have any thing so secret, which will not bee cryed upon the Market place, and to speake in the Comoedians phrase: That which Iupiter speakes to Iuno in her eare, shall bee made Table talke for all the people. You being as you are, the censor of manners, and Pylot of the state; it belongs to your place to restraine this so Tyrannicall an usurpation upon the liberty of mens spirits, and whilst you desend from violence our fortunes and our lives; you must not expose to the same violence, other of our goods, no lesse deare to

us than those. And herein, I promise to my selfe, some consideration of my owne particular, and that for my sake, you will let your courtesie goe further than your justice. And having obliged me to you already upon the like occasion; I doubt not but you will maintaine that first favour, with a second, and make the Printers know, that you have taken my Name and Writings into your protection, to defend them against all their practises. This shall bee to me a singular favour, and which shall binde me, all my life, to seeke out meanes to testifie, that I am
                     
                        Sir,
                        Your most humble, and most affectionate servant, BALZAC.
                     
                  
                  
                     To Mounsieur Rigault. LETTER. II.
                     SIR, having adventured to speake Latin, I feared my boldnesse might have had but ill successe; and I doubted, whether in a forraigne Country I might passe for an Enemy, or for a Friend. But your Letter hath given me assurance of my condition. I account it as the Letters Pattents of my Naturalizing; and where I

was afraid to bee held a Barbarian, I see my selfe suddenly become a Cittizen of Rome. For since there is now, no more Vse, that can serve for the Law; nor People, that can serve for the Iudge of a dead language; I have therefore recourse to you Sir, in whom I seeme to see the very face of the most pure Antiquity; and who, after the dissolution of the body of the Common-wealth, do yet preserve the Spirit. It is false to say, The Gothes and Vandalts could justly bragge they left nothing of any worth behinde them: I finde still the full Majestie of the language in your writings; and your stile hath in it, not onely the Ayre and Garbe of that good time; but the very Courage and the Vertue. You draw your Opinions from the same Well, and I see no cause that any man can have to contradict them. It is certaine, that to gaine beleefe, one must keepe himselfe within the bounds of likelihood; and present to posterity examples which it may follow; and not Prodigies, with which it may be frighted. Words that are disproportionable to the matter, seeme to savour of that Mountibankes straine; who would have it beleeved, he could make a statue of a Mountaine, and would perswade us, that a man were a mile long. There are some mens workes, not much lesse extravagant than this Mountibanks designe; and most men seeme to write with as little seriousnesse; and with as little care to be beleeved. And though men make a conscience in dealing with particular persons; yet when they come to deale with the Publike,

they seeme to thinke themselves dispensed with; and that they owe more respect to one neighbour than to whole Nations, and to all Ages to come. You know notwithstanding, that this is no new vice; and not to make a troublesome enumeration of the antient adoters of Favour: Is not that base delight of Velleim come even to us? and was he not a Bondslave, that desired one should know he was in love with his Chaine? I could curse the ill fortune of good letters, that hath bereft us of the booke which Brutus writ of vertue; wherein wee might have seene the infamous profession he makes of unmanlinesse; to have more care of the orders of a corrupted Court, than of upholding the maine structure of the Latine Philosophie. If it had beene his fortune to have outlived Sejanus; I doubt not, but hee would have taken from him all the praises hee had given him to make a present of them to his successour Macron: and if the gappes and breaches of his booke were filled up, one should see he had not forgotten so much as a Groome in all Tiberius house, of whom he had not written Encomiums. Wee live in a Government much more just, and therefore much more commendable; the raigne of our King is not barren of great examples. It is impossible the cariage of M. the Cardinall, should bee more dextrous, more sage, more active than it is: yet who knowes not that hee hath found worke enough to doe for many Ages, and battailes enow to fight for many Worthies: That hee

hath met with difficulties worthy of the transcendent forces of himselfe, farre exceeding the forces of any other; it is necessary, that Time it selfe should joyne in labour with excellent Master-workemen to produce the perfection of excellent workes. The recovery of a wasted body, is not the worke of onely one potion; or once opening a veine: the reviving a decayed estate, requires a reiteration of endeavours, and a constancy of labours. The salving of desperate cases, goes not so swift a pace, as Poets descriptions, or Figures of Orators. Wee must therefore keepe the extension of our subject within certaine bounds; and not say, that the victory is perfected, as long as it leaves us the evills of warre, and that there remaines any Monster to bee vanquished, seeing even poverty is it selfe one of the greatest Monsters; and in comparison whereof, those which Hercules subdued, were but tame and gentle. With time, our Redeemer will finish his worke; and he that hath given us security, will give us also no doubt abundance. But seeing the order of the world, and the necessity of affaires affoords us not yet to tast this happines; it shall bee a joy unto mee, to see at least, the Image of it in your History: to returne and re-enter by your meanes into these three, so rich and flourishing yeares, after which the peace hath shewed it selfe but by fits; and the Sunne it selfe hath beene more reserved of his beames, and not ripened our fruits but on one side. You shall binde mee infinitely unto you,

to grant me a sight of this rare Peece, and to allow me a key of that Temple, which you keepe shut to all the world besides. I assure my selfe I shall see nothing there but that which is Stately and Magnificent; specially I doubt not but the Pallace it selfe is admirable, and that your words doe Parallell the subject, when you come to speake of the last Designes of our deceased King; and of the undoubted revolution he had brought upon the state of the world, if he had lived. And though in this there be more of divination, then of knowledge; and that to speake of such things be to expound Riddles; yet in such cases it is not denyed to be Speculative; and I do not beleeye that Lyvie recounting the death of Caesar, did lightly passe over the Voyage he intended against the Parthians; and that he stayed not a little to consider the new face he would have put upon the Commonwealth if death had not prevented him. If all my affaires lay here, yet I would make a journey to Paris, expressely for this; and to reade a discourse, made after the fashion of this Epitaph, which pleased me exceedingly. He had a Designe to winne Rhodes and overcome Italy. I should have much a doe to hold in my Passion till then; but now I stand waiting for your Tertullian, that I may learne of him that patience which he teacheth, that I faint not in waiting till it Printed, and in state to be seene; and till he come abroad under your Corrections; like to those glorious bodies, which being clensed from all impurity of matter, doe

glister and shine on every side. This is an Authour, with whom your Preface would have made me friends, if I had otherwise beene fallen out; and that the hardnesse of his phrase, and the vices of his age had given me any distaste from reading him. But it is long since, that I have held him in account; and as sad and thorny as he is, hath not beene unpleasing to me. Me thinkes, I finde in his writings that darke light; or light some darkenesse, which an ancient Poet speakes off; and I looke upon the obscurity of his writing, as I should looke upon a peece of Ivory that were well wrought and polished. This hath beene ever my opinion of him. As the beauties of Africa, doe not therefore leave to be Amiable, because they are not like to ours; and as Sophonis be would have carryed the prize from many Italian faces; so the wits of the same Country, doe not leave to please, though their eloquence be a forreiner: and for my part I preferre this man before many that take upon them to be imitators of Cicero. Let it be granted to delicate Eares, that his stile is of Iron but then let it be granted also, that of this Iron; many excellent Armours have been forged, that with it he hath defended the honour and innocency of Christianity, with it he hath put the Valentinians to flight, and hath pierced the very heart of Marcyon. You see I want not much of declayming in his Praise, but to avoid this inconvenience, I thinke best to breake off abruptly. I am neither good at making Orations, nor at venting of Complements;

                        I am a bad Advocate, and as bad a Courtier: yet I entreate you to beleeve, that I am very truely:
                     
                        Sir,  
                        Your; &amp;c.
                     
                  
                  
                     To Mounsieur du Moulin. LETTER. III.
                     SIr, no modesty is able to resist the Praises that come from you. And I vow unto you, I tooke a pleasure to suffer my selfe to be corrupted, with the first lines of your Letter. But it must be one, that knowes himselfe lesse then I doe, that dwels long in this errour. After a pleasing dreame, One is willing to awake; and I see well enough, that when you take such advantage to speake of my Travell: you make not use of the whole ability of your Iudgement. You doe me a favour, I cannot say you doe me justice; you seeme to have a will to oblige me to you, by hazarding to incurre the displeasure of Truth. Now that you are your selfe at the Goale; you encourage with all your forces those that are in the race; and to perswade them to follow you; make them believe they shall goe beyond you. An admirable tricke of Art, I must confesse; and which at first I did not discover. But whatsoever it be, and from

what ground soever this wonderful cōmendation of yours proceeds; I esteeme it not lesse then an ambitious man doth a Crowne; and without piercing into your purpose. I take a joy in my good Fortune which is not small Sir, to be loved of you, whom I have alwaies exceedingly loved; and whom I have a long time looked upon in the Huguenot Party, as an excellent Pylot that affronts a great Fleete, being himselfe but in a Pinnace. The Right and Authority is on our side; the Plots and Stratagems on yours, and you seeme not lesse confident in your courage, then we in our cause. It is certaine, that this is the way to give a sedition, the shew of a just warre: and to a multitude of mutiners, the face of a well ordered Army. By this you keepe many in a good opinion of that which hath now lost the attractivē grace of Novelty; and though it be now bending to its declination; yet it cannot be denyed, but that it holds still some colour, and some apparance, by the Varnish of your writings; and that never man hath more subtilly covered his cause from shew of weakenesse; nor more strongly upheld his side from ruine then your selfe:
                     
                        Si Pergama Dextra

                     This is my ordinary language, when it comes in my way to speake of you. I am not of the passionate humour of the vulgar; which blancheth the liberty of their judgement; and finds never any fault in their owne side, nor vertue

in the opposite. For my selfe, from what cloud soever the day breake; I account it faire; and assure my selfe that at Rome honest men commended Hanniball; and none but Porters and base people spake basely of him. It is indeed a kinde of sacriledge to devest any man, whatsoever he be, of the gifts of God, and if I should not acknowledge that you have received much; I should be injurious to him that hath given you much; and for difference of the cause, wrong our Benefactor that is indifferent. It is true, I have not alwaies flattered the ill disposed French; and was put in some choler against the Authors of our last broyles; but observing in your Bookes, that our intendments are alike; and that the subjection due to Princes is a part of the Religion you professe; I have thought I might well speake of your conformity herein, as much as I say; and in so doing, be but your Interpreter. Whether the tempest rise from the Northerne winde, or from the Southerne; it is to me equally unpleasing; and in that which concernes my duty; I neither take Councell from England, nor yet from Spaine. My humour is not to wrestle with the Time; and to make my selfe an Antagonist of the Present; it is paine enough for me onely to conceive the Idea of Cato, and Cassius; and being to live under the command of another, I find no vertue more fitting then obedience. If I were a Switzer, I would thinke it honour enough to be the Kings Gossip; and would not be his subject, nor change my liberty for the best Master

in the world; but since, it hath pleased. God

hath beene respected in them, whom it hath touched; and great adversities have sometimes rather given a Religious respect, then received a reproach. But thus to speake of the good successe of the Kings Armes were to speake improperly. Both sides have gained by his victory. All the penalty that hath beene imposed upon you; hath beene but this, to make you as happy as our selves, and you are now in quiet possession of that happinesse, for which before your Townes were taken, you were but suppliants. Our Prince will put no yoke upon the consciences of his Subjects; he desires not to make that be received by force; which cannot well be received but by perswasion; nor to use such remedies against the French, which are not good, but against the Moores. If the King of Sweden use his prosperity in this manner, and soile not so pure a Grace with proscriptions and punishments; I make you a faithfull promise, to doe that which you desire me to doe; to employ all my cunning and all my engines, to erect a statue to the memory of his Name. You touch the right string of my inclination, when you pray me to praise and to magnifie that Prince. If all the Crownes that are wrought upon his Scarfe should be changed into so many Kingdomes, they could never in my opinion sufficiently recompence so rare a vertue; nor be able to fill so vaste a Spirit as his is: As I expect nothing but great from his valour, so from his honesty I hope for nothing but good; and although in Spaine it be

                     To Mounsieur, the Abbot of Baume. LETTER. IV.
                     SIR, I am true, if not liberall; and I send you that I promised, though I cannot send you what I would. This is neither a mooveable for the use of your house, nor an ornament to beautifie your closet; it is matter of discourse onely for two or three dayes at your table; and a Novelty that will quickly grow stale. But if your selfe have any better opinion of it, and that you account it of any value, I am contented that you leave my stile to the mercy of any that will arrest it; so you please to justifie my intentions to men that are reasonable, and not suffer in the Country where you are, that an honest man should bee oppressed with the hatred against his side. If I were a revoulted Spaniard, and that the words I write did come from the mouth of a Fugitive, they might with good reason bee taken in ill part; and we finde that a Graecian at Athens, was once punished for serving the Persians to bee their Interpreter: but I desire you to consider, that the cause I maintaine is the cause of my Prince and Country, which I could not maintaine coldly, without a kinde of treason. We punish Prevaricatours and Traytors, but true and lawfull enemies wee prayse, and I cannot thinke

that M. the Cardinall of Cueva, will thinke the worse of my passion, for the publike liberty, who hath shewed himselfe the like passion, for one particular mans Regency. I am not afraid that a good action should make me lose his favour, or that being himselfe extreamely just, hee should not more esteeme of my zeale, which is naturall and honest; than the choller of Doctor Boucher, a mercenary man, and a Pentioner to a stranger. It will be no Novelty to say that of Spaine, which hath beene alwayes said of great Empires, and that rapine and cruelty is a reproach even to Eagles and Lyons. To be a Tyrant and an Vsurper, is it not in other termes to be a Grandee, and a Conqueror? And are not violence and severity vices that exceed the reach of vertue, and which makes our morality ridiculous; I blame sometimes the counsailes of Kings, but I never lay hands upon their royalty, and if I seeke to cut off superfluities and excesses, it cannot therfore be justly sayd, I teare that off which I seeke to prune. Crownes are to me sacred, even upon Idolaters heads; and I adore the marke of God in the person of the great Cham, and of the great Mogoll. Having now made this declaration which yet is more expressly delivered in my booke: I hope there will be no place left for calumnie, and I promise to my selfe, that for my sake you will whip the Spaniards in point of generousnesse, and shew them, that she hath shewed her selfe principally to doe a favour to enemies, and to mingle things which seeme hard to bee mingled,

courtesie and warre together, I demand not these good offices from you, I expect them from your friendship, and I doubt not but you will continue it to me in spight of all the spightfulnesse and bitternesse of the opposites, seeing I know you are free from those petty passions of vulgar spirits, and that you know I am

                     To Mounsieur Bouthillier, Counsellor of the King in his Counsailes, and Secretary of his commands. LETTER. V.
                     SIR, I vow I am one of the worst Courtiers of France, and to justifie Fortune, for having little favoured me, I will accuse my selfe for having little courted her, yet for the love of you I have used an extraordinary endeavour. My affection hath gone beyond my action, and I have put my selfe to the venture to goe as farre as Gascogny to seeke you out. If you had gone by Cadillac, as I was told you would, you had found me at the waters side at your disimbarking,

and I should have put hard with the best of the Country to have had the honour to offer you my service first of any, but God did not thinke me worthy of my desires. It was his pleasure I should make a journey of fifty leagues not to see you, and I conceive my happinesse to be such, that if I should goe to Paris with the like intention, God would presently inspire the Kings heart to send you away in some Embassage: Be pleased therefore Sir to spare me this travaile; I dare undertake no second voyage, for feare least such a thought onely should remoove you from the station where all the good of life is seated, and out of which a man can have no contentment, but what he can get by the force of Reason and Philosophie. It sufficeth me that I have this one way left me, to present you my Complements; and that from time to time I can make you reade that your Idaea is the deare company of my solitude, &amp; your reputation the comfortable trouble of my repose. In the estate I now am in, this in effect, is all the part I claime in the affaires of the world; these are the newes for which I retaine still my whole enquiery; I professe unto you the publicke prosperities would be lesse deare unto me if yours were not bound up in one volume with them. It doth not trouble me I confesse that our affaires are prospe

                        ous, and that our armies have glorious successe, but to thinke that you are one of the instruments of so flourishing a kingdome, and that the king makes use of your pen to communicate

himselfe to his owne people, and to strangers, and to distribute both good and evill to all Europe, this is that which ravisheth mee with extremitie of joy. From your words are framed the Oracles that are at this day given to all Nations, you trouble not your braines any more with the petty interests of Tytius and Maevius; Italy and Germany are now your clients; and the Princes that either feare or suffer oppression expect their destinies from your answers. I had the pleasure Sir to see all these things before they were visible; I saw the fruit when it was but in the budde, I knew the Gold when it was yet in the mine, I remember your happy entrance into the world, and that you have not needed a time of probation for being perfectly an honest man, you sayd things to mee in your infancie which I make use of now in my old age; and I keepe for a Monument a letter you once writ to me from Villesavin as a seede of all the dispatches, and of all the instructions you shall ever make. At that time I was proud of my fortune, and you gave me leave to boast of your friendship, I dare not now use the privacie of such tearmes; it is fit my ambition should be more modest and more moderate. I crave now only an acknowledging and a protection, and this I hope Sir you will not deny me; but take me for one of the charges descended upon you, with the inheritance of Mounsieur d' Ayre your deceased Vncle; Beare with my passion as a thing of your owne, and which you cannot put

away, since in effect I am and can never bee other.

                        Then your, &amp;c.
                     
                  
                  
                     To Monsieur, the Earle of Excester. LETTER VI.
                     SIR, if I had made a vow of humility, you give me here a faire occasion to bee proud for not breaking it, yet this should not be an effect of the love of wisedome; it should be a marke of aversion from goodnesse, if I did not testifie the joy of the Newes I have received I could never expect from your honour a more sweet recompence of my travaile then this, which is presented to me by your hands, and when I see the sonne of the great Cecile let downe his spirits so low as to mine, and make himselfe lesse then hee is by representing me in his Country; I cannot forbeare to vow unto you that it hath touched the most sensible part of my soule, and that with joy thereof my miseries have given me a comfortable breathing time. For your selfe Sir, all the 
                           •…
                        aine you can take herein is but this, that it may bee sayd, you have your sports as well as your businesses, and that all the houres of

your life are not equally serious, but seeing the gods in times past have changed their shapes, and disguised themselves in a thousand fashions; I conceive it may be justly allowed to you to give us the morall sence of those fables, you are able without any wrong to your selfe, to shew us, that great persons cloyed with their felicitie are glad sometimes to imitate the actions of private men, and to put on Maskes to save themselves from the imp

                        rtunity of their greatnesse, whatsoever your designe were I cannot but turne to my advantage, for by this meanes I am certainly an honester man in England then in France: seeing I speake there by your mouth, I therefore most humbly thanke you for the favour you have done me, in making mee better then I was; and I joy in this, that by your meanes I am improved in value, which inables me to make you the more worthy present, in presenting you my affection, and the desire I have to be all my life,

                        Your, &amp;c.
                     
                  
                  
                     To Mounsieur de Boyssat. LETTER VII.

I feele a joy at the only sight of your name, &amp; the honour you doe me to remember me, is so deare unto me, that though perhaps it be fortune that doth it, yet I cannot but thank you for it. You are one of those whose least favours are Obligatorie, &amp; you never cast them from you so carelessely, but that they deserve to bee carefully gathered. When others beare you affection and hold you deare, it is but to be just, and to pay debts, but when you doe the like to others, it is to be liberall, and to bestow favours. You may then imagine what glory I account it, that the meanenesse of my spirit hath the approbation of your judgement, and I am not a little glad that my inclination hath so good successe, not to be hated of one whom I should love, though hee hated mee. For a traine to this first favour I require from you a second; be pleased Sir that I aske you, if it be in truth my selfe whom you exhort to moderation, whether you thinke in your conscience that I am fallen into the vice contrary to this vertue? It is now foure yeares that I suffer outrages, they thinke it not enough to doe me wrongs unlesse they print them too; they doe me hurt, and would have me thinke my selfe beholding to them for it; an infinite Army of enemies are come into the field against mee, under the Colours of Philarque; it is not two or three private men, it is whole Companies, whole Troopes that set upon mee: I am the Martyr of a thousand Tyrants, and if this unhappy influence passe not over, or abate not, I

shall come at last to be the object of persecution for all the world. They have painted mee out a publicke sinner amongst honest men; a a man that cannot reade amongst Schollers, a mad man amongst the sober: These good offices they have done mee hitherto without any revenging, I am as yet a debtour of these charities to them that have lent them to mee; I have taken these blowes with hardinesse in stead of repelling them with force, and my patience hath beene such, that many have called it want of courage: If this bee so, you will grant me Sir that you trouble your selfe about that which cannot be, that another mans praises should be insupportable to mee, when I have not been sensible of my owne Calumnies: I am not like to be in hast to hinder by my violence the making of friendship, who have by my remissenes as it were consented to my owne hatred. There is no colour to thinke that I should complaine of words feigned, and such as declaymers use in sport, who have not so much as spoken a word of the most cruell action that ever the most premeditated malice could bring forth. Let our friend if hee please make an Epitaph or a deifying of—let him imploy all his Morter and all his Art, to build him either a Sepulcher or a Temple, and to speake after the manner of—, let him erect him a shrine, and place him amongst his houshould saints: I say nothing against all this, nor condemne his proceeding, whether it be that he honour the memory and merit of the dead, or that hee

stand in awe of the credit and faction of his heires. I easily beare with these small spots in my friends, and exact no more of them then they can well spare. I know that Greeke and Latine make not men valiant, nor are things that descend to the bottome of the soule, they scarce reach to the outermost superficies: they stay commonly in the memory and in the imagination, and polish the tongue without fortifying the heart: I should therefore desire too much, if I should desire at all that these goodly knowledges should get a new vertue for my sake, and should worke a greater effect in the spirit of—then they wrought in the Poet Lucan, whom fearē constrained to accuse his mother, and to praise a tyrant. If it stay but upon mee that this deare child should see the light, after so many sower lookes and so many throwes, I am ready my selfe to serve for a Midwife. I am content it shall be published to day, and to morrow bee translated into all Languages, that the Author may not lose a day in his glory, and that his glory be not bounded within River or Mountaine. Never feare that I will impaire his ill nights, or adde the care of one processe to his ordinary watchings, if hee have no other u
                           •…
                        quietnesse but what he is like to havē from me, he may be sure to enjoy a perpetuall calme, and a perfect tranquility, if he be not awaked but by the noise you thinke I will make him, he may sleepe as long as Epimenides, who going to bed a young man was fifty yeares elder when

he rose. Besides, I have too much care of my owne quiet, to goe about to trouble his; and I love his contentment too well, not to procure it, being to cost me nothing, but the dissembling his weakenesse, And this I entreate you Sir, to assure him from me. But knowing you to be wise and vertuous in the degree you are, I doubt not, but of your owne head, you will tell him, that it becomes not a man of his gravity, to countenance such petty things; and in a point of Schollarship to use as much formality and ceremony, as if it were the Negotiation of an Ambassador, but much more, that it is a base quality to juggle with his friends; and after having said a truth, which was not for all mens taste to make a Comment upon it, of a Sophister. I have read Tacitus, and the Bookes of—and therefore should know the stile of Tyberius; and the Art of Equivocation; but I should be loath to seeme ingenious, to the prejudice of mine honour, and to make use of poyson, though I had one so subtill that would kill without leaving any marke to be seene; I have loved men in affliction; and have made use of men in misery. Lightning hath not driven me from places which it hath made frightfull; I have given testimony of my affection, not only where it could not be acknowledged, but where it was in danger to be punished. I am not now so dealt withall my selfe; and yet if the justice of my cause were not as it is to be regarded; me thinkes the violence of my adversaries ought to procure me some favour;

doth not even honour oblige those that have any feeling of it, not to joyne with the multitude which casts it selfe upon a single man? Oppression hath alwaies beene a sufficient ground for Protection; and Noble mindes never seeke better Title for defending the weaker; but the neede there is of them; and to take part with a stranger, it is cause enough that many assault him, and few assist him. and such also I doubt not is your mind. I am not lesse perswaded of the generousnesse of your mind; then of the greatnesse of your Spirit, and assure my selfe you are not the lesse on my side, because I have many persecutors, as because also, I am firmely,
                     
                        Sir  
                        Your &amp;c.
                     
                  
                  
                     To Mounsieur Huggens, Secretary to the Prince of Orange. LETTER. VIII.
                     SIR, I complaine no more of fortune, shee hath done mee at least some courtesie amongst her many injuries, and since shee suffers that you love me, it is a signe shee hath care of me amidst her persecutions, this good newes I have learned by a Letter of yours to

M. the Baron of Saint Surin, who will beare me witnesse, that after I had read it. I desired nothing more for perfecting my joy, but that I might be such a one as you make me, and be like my picture. If this be the coale of Holland with which you make, such draughts, it surpasseth all the colour that we use here to paint withall, and yet the beauty costs you nothing, but you shal handly make me beleeve it; I know Gold and Azure, and can easily distinguish it from coale, I see Sir the Ambushes you lay for me. The Facilitie of your stile covers the force of it, but weakens it not, and under a shew of carelesnesse, I finde true Art and Ornaments. It secures not your turnes to doe better in the place where you are than wee; and shutting us out to hold possession of the ancient and solid vertue, but you goe about to take from us all that is any way passable to corrupt estates, I meane the glory of Language, and not suffer us to have this little toy to comfort our selves withall, for the losse of all our truer treasures. After fifty yeares overcome you will now be talking of a parley, and thinke to make your selves masters of men by a more sweet and humane way then the former, as much in effect as to bee, that you have sometimes beene termed the brothers of the people of Rome, and heyres of the old Catoes, who made profession of severity, and yet not enemies of the graces. This is to perfume Iron and Copper, and to the libertie and discipline of Sparta, to adde the bravery and dainties of

                        Athens, M. de Saint Surin hath thereunto made us excellent relations; and you have sent him backe to us with his heart wounded, and his minde tainted with that he hath seene, and he wants not much of being become a bad Frenchman, at least he reteines nothing for his country but a dutifull and reverent affection; his love your Iland hath gotten possession of, and I am much afraid you will find more loadstone to draw him to you, then we shall finde chaines to hold him with us. He is ful of the objects he hath left behind him, and when I talke to him of our Court and of our confusions; hee answers with telling mee of your government and good order. And here you shall pardon me if I change my complement into blame, and require to be righted by you for dehauching a friend, who with one looke of his countenance allayes and sweetens all the bitternesse of my life. The number of my persecutors is in a manner infinite, but for how many thinke you I account so brave a champion? Take him from me and you leave mee quite disarmed against ill fortune, I loose my comfort for adversitie, and my example for vertue. And finding you the principall author of this disgrace, I know not how I should but hate you, and persevere in the resolution I have taken, to be most affectionately,
                     
                        Sir,  
                        Your, &amp;c.
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     To the Baron of Saint Surin. LETTER. IX.
                     SIR, I learne by the Gazette that you have received a wound at Mastricke, so it bee light I forgive it you, but though it bee but a scratch I love you too well not to accuse you of too much forwardnesse. They that are poore in reputation ought to presse up to the trenches, and such fervour is as well beseeming fresh souldiers as young Fryers; but for you, you have seene too many warres to be called by the first name, and your valour having beene shewed in the presence of the Prince, and approved by the testimony of the very enemy; it seemes to mee that your part is not so much to bring it forth as a new matter, as to keepe it up as a knowne good. I would have you make good actions, yea ordinary; but I would have you doe it now, if it might be had with a body charmed and with inchanted Armes, that leaving behinde you all danger, you might have before you nothing but glory. If God had given us three or foure lives, we might at any time venture one, and sometimes in a bravery let one goe, being assured we have another in store, but to be prodigall in poverty, and to be carelesse of ones head when no art can make him a new, this is a point hath no apparence of reason. Wee must not set so light by the

beauties of heaven and the Rayes of visible things, nor turne our eyes from a spectacle so magnificently erected for us: I offend perhaps the eares of your courage with this discourse, and you are like to send my counsaile away as it came, yet take not distastfully an officious injury and thinke it not strange that I acquaint you with my feares, seeing a goddesse was not ashamed to attire her sonne in a womans habit to preserve him; it would greeve me exceedingly to see you come halting home, or with but one eye, and to bring such untoward favours from the warres; I will not be bound to flatter your griefe with that word of a Lacedaemonian mother, Courage my sonne; you cannot now take a steppe that puts you not in minde of your vertue, and lesse with that example in the histories of Salust, he made ostentation of a face remarkeable onely for skarres, and for having but one eye, wherein he tooke a pleasure though it made him deformed, and cared not for losing one part of himselfe, which made all the rest the fuller of honour. Spare me I beseech you this kinde of consolation which I should give you, if you suffer the like losses, and be not so hot in seeking after a faire death which can gaine you nothing but a faire Epitaph. Give mee beleefe onely this once, and after this I will leave you to your owne beleefe, and commend you to your good Angell. You shall have leave to dispose of your time some otherwise then thus, but remember that Melons are past, and

make not—stand waiting too long for you: Our Rivers never ranne more cleare, not our Meddowes were ever more greene. I make use Sir of all things both reasonable and insensibe to perswade your returne. In the name of God come and draw me out of the unquietnesse you have put me in, I have something, I know not what, lies heavy at my heart, and nothing will lighten it but your company: That which a superstitious man would doe for a dreame, or for some idle presage, do you I pray you for a friend: who carries you alwayes in his minde, and who is more then any in the world,
                     
                        Sir,  
                        Your, &amp;c.
                     
                  
                  
                     To my Lord the Cardinall De la Valette. LETTER X.
                     SIR, the Letter you did me the honour to write unto me, the thrirteenth of the last Moneth came not to my hands till the beginning of this, otherwise I had sooner given testimony how deare these last markes of your remembring me are unto me, and how much I receiv
                           •…
                         of secret glory, seeing all other is denyed

me, in that I have done any thing which seemes not altogether unpleasing to you. It is no small matter to entertaine eyes that use not to stay upon vulgar objects; and to minister pleasure to a minde which hath nothing in it but lawfull passions, and indeede Sir the height of my ambition is bounded there. If I had no other payment for all my travaile, but onely your good opinion of it, I should not complaine for being ill payd, and your goodnesse hath made me full recompence for all the wrongs I have received. The number of my enemies is great, I see it well, the time doth not favour me, I confesse it, but having your favour Sir what can I feare under so powerfull a protection? Seeing those to whom God hath given clearer eyes then to other men, and a more soveraigne reason, as well as a more sovereigne dignitie, have no ill opinion of my opinions, what neede I care for the censure of the base world? and how can I but hope that the truth assisted by a few sages, will be alwayes able to withstand a multitude of Sophisters? I now send you Sir my answer to such of their objections, that seeme worth the refuting, and which have but any sparke of apparance to dazle the eyes of simple people; the rest are so ridiculous that I dare not oppugne them, for feare you should thinke I had devised them my selfe to make matter for discourse; or that I coaped with them about points where I were sure they could doe mee no hurt. And yet why should I dissemble my

ill happe? Those ridiculous objections finde abettours and uphoulders, although I have justice on my side, yet am I sued still, and persecuted by men I never offended; and that when I give over the field and intreate for my life, see the dealings of cruell mindes towards those that are good. They have no feare, but because I make no resistance; they magnifie themselves in the wrong of their advantage; they have not taken it; it is my selfe have given it them. Their first successe which my sufferance hath incouraged have beene new bonds for the continuance; and because I have used no words against their blowes, they thinke I judge my selfe worthy to endure them; yet all this shall not make me change my resolution, and I am bent to stay within the bounds into which I have voluntarily put my selfe. Although I am neighbour to a Marshalls Court, yet I chuse 
                           •…
                        ather a disgracefull quietnesse then to entertaine the best quarrell in the world. I have got as it were a habit of carelesnesse, I dare not say of patience, least I might be accused to praise my selfe for a vertue. It may happen that their persecution shall not continue so long as my innocency, and that I may see an end of that which would be my end. It may bee a calmer season will follow after this, and perhaps the tempest that threatens my head will fall but at my feete. However the world goe, I will alwayes comfort my selfe with the Letter you did mee the honour to write unto me. I will put your good

will in ballance against all mens malice, and against all the injuries of Fortune, I will account my selfe not altogether unhappy as long as I shall have place in your remembring mee, and that you will beleeve I am,
                     
                        Sir,  
                        Your, &amp;c.
                     
                  
                  
                     Another to the same Cardinall. LETTER XI.
                     SIR, I never durst adventure to be suter to you in behalfe of others, and finding my selfe unworthy of your favour, I have never offered to counterfaite a Favorite But though I did stand so farre in your grace as to doe good offices for any, and that you allowed me the liberty which I dare not take of my selfe; yet I should doe very untowardly to begin with a suite in behalfe of Mounsieur Conrades, and to steppe before you in your owne inclinations. I know your love to him, is one of the most ancient you ever had, and hee therefore one of the first servants you ever entertainde: The choise of so judicious an infancie as yours, hath not I dare say beene rashly made; and I discover daily by the opening of his heart and thoughts unto me, the reasons you had to love him at first; I come not therefore as his Solicitour

but as his bare witnesse; and assure you most undoubtedly, that I know not a man living more religious towards the memory of his masters, more firme in performance of his duty, more fervent in his passions, nor more passionately affected to your service then himselfe. Now that he hath lost M. the Marshall Scomberg, by whose commandement I came expressely from Burdeaux, to offer him on his part all the contentment hee could wish; hee thinkes hee hath right after him to place his hope in you, and that you will doe him the honour to uphold with your protection the affaires he hath at Court. I concurre with him in this opinion; and knowing that in this so generall a corruption of the world, this age of ours owes unto you the last examples wee see of goodnesse, &amp; that without you neither the dead should any more finde pitty, nor the miserable consolation; I have conceived you will not take it ill that I confirme him in this beleefe, and that I take this occasion to say that unto you which in the suddennesse of my departure, I had not time to say that I am perfectly and ever,
                     
                        Sir,  
                        Your, &amp;c.
                        At Angoulesme 
                           23. Novemb. 1632.
                        
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     To Mounsieur de Bois Robert. LETTER XII.
                     SIR, you are a better man than you would have me beleeve you are. Your words of Fire and Blood agree ill with the sweetnesse of your spirit, and having received from you a Letter of challenge, I expect from you another of friendship. You may make your profit of the good examples you have seene on that side the Mountaines, but follow not the Italian examples of being captious and retaining of spleene, as if it were a jewell. It is not fit the holy weeke should passe upon your choller without abating it. It would not bee an act of courage, but a hardnesse of heart, and the best extremities partake so much of vice, that even supreme right is no better than supreme wrong. Play not therefore the tyrant towards your friend, but stay your selfe within the bounds of ordinary justice. The limits that part justice from wrong are not so well marked out, but that one passeth them often before he is aware; and it is neither a lawfull greatnesse to make ones selfe terrible to those he loves, nor an honest resistance to stand obdurate to the prayers of men in misery. But perhaps I offer remedies to one in better state than my selfe; perhaps I am affrayd of in artificiall choller, and am frighted with

that which is but a Vizard. It may be you have a desire to know in what degree I love you, and that your hard dealing with mee is but to try me; such experiments would proove dangerous to any other man besides your selfe, but you may make them safely, for I make you promise that my patience shall bee more insensible then your sence is tender. But yet muse a little upon the honour of our friendship, and upon the opinion of the world. I make confession to you of my faults, and I am told you publish briefes of your dislike; I have told you confidently that I suffer in it, and because I tell it not with a good grace, you are offended with the incivility of privacie. Me thinkes you should not exact from a plaine country man so punctuall a discretion, by living amongst clownes I have forgotten all the good manners I learned with you: the wilde man you had civilized is returned backe to his naturall condition. I doe not any longer walke in the woods, I wander there, and had it not beene to see my Lord Mayors shew, I had not beene seene in the City, although to say the truth, so obstinate a retyring might justly enough have beene censured as a kind of rebellion; and as the study of wisedome takes from mee all admiration of vaine pompe, so yet it leaves mee the reverence of lawfull authority. And to this purpose (that I may change the tenour of my discourse) I must tell you that I am very well pleased with my voyage, and doe not repent me to have performed

a small Complement which hath discovered unto mee an eminent vertue. I have studied M. de Brassac now eight dayes together, I have observed him in publicke and in private. I have seene him handle different subjects, with so equall force, that I am even ashamed, that having so perfect knowledge of his owne Art, yet he knowes mine much more better then my selfe. Hee is none of these limited wits that count themselves full, if they have but three words of Latine, and have but read one of Plutarkes lives: Take them out of certaine common places within which they entrench themselves and draw all discourse thither, every where else they are utterly disarmed and without defence; but his knowledge is so universall, and comprehends such an infinite number of thinges that one cannot touch upon any point where hee is not ready for you, and to draw him dry I doe not thinke there are questions enow in the world to put unto him. In one day I have heard him discourse with Gentlemen about hunting and husbandry; with Iesuits about Divinitie, and the Mathematicks, with Doctors of lesse austere profession about Rhetoricke and Poetrie, without ever borrowing a forreigne terme, where the naturall were the fitter, and without ever flying to authority where the case in question were to be decided by reason. To answer a premeditated oration from point to point upon the suddaine, and to send backe our oratours more perswaded by his eloquence then satisfied with their owne,

this I have seene him oftentimes doe, and no man ever came to visit him, whose heart hee did not winne with his words, or at least left in it such an impression as is wont to bee the first elementing and foundation of love. No libertie can be so sweete as so reasonable a subjection; such a yoake is more to be valued then the Mayor of Rochels Halberds, and when one is once assured of the sufficiencie of his guide, it is afterwards but a pleasure to bee led. In lesse then one weeke hee hath new made all spirits here; hath fortified the weake, hath cleared the scrupulous, and hath given to all the world a good opinion of the present, and a better hope of the time to come. I vow unto you I never saw a man that had a more pleasing way of commanding, nor better knew how to temper force and perswasion together. I have indeede knowne some not unfit to command, but it hath beene in a Gally not in a City; such might serve for excellent followers, but are never good to make Governours; they understand not the Art of governing Freemen; there are even some beasts of so generous a disposition, that it would be rudenesse to carry a hard hand over them; much more whom one might leade in his garter to curbe them, besides a bridle with a Cavasson. They thinke that power cannot subsist but by severity, and that it growes weake and scorned, vds it be not frightfull and injurious. This method and manner of governing is not like to come from the schoole and discipline of M. the

Cardinall, from whom nothing is ever seene to come that relisheth not of the mildenesse of his countenance, and receiveth not some impression from the clearenesse of his eyes. All that have the honour to come neare about him are knowne by this Character, &amp; weare all the same livery, though they bee of different deserving. There is not so sullen an humorist that is not mollified by his presence, nor so dull an understanding that he makes not pregnant with a word of his mouth; this you know, and I am not ignorant of; hee makes powerfull use of weake instruments, and his inspirations lift up spirits to such a highth as their owne nature could never carry them. Hee needes in a man but a small seede of reason to draw from him exceeding effects of prudence, and he instructs so effectually the grossest spirits; that what they want in themselves they get by his instructions. These are workes which none can doe but he, materialls which none but he can put in frame; yet I thinke I may say without offence, that this is more of his choyse then of his nature. To spirits that languished for want of roome to stirre themselves in, hee hath given scope and imployment, and where he hath found a vertue neglected, to make it as bright as it was solid; he hath not forborne to crowne it with his friendship. There is not a mouth in all his Province that blesseth not his Election; and every man beleeves to have received from him that power which he hath procured to him, who

will not use it but for our good. Amongst the showtes of exultation which waite upon him in all places where he goes; the joy of the people is not so fixed upon present objects, but that it mounts to a higher cause, and gives thankes to the first moover of the good influences which the lower heavens powre downe upon us. And in effect if Caesar thought hee tooke a sufficient revenge of the Africans, for their taking part with the enemy, by placing Salust to be their Governour; who did them more hurt by his private Family, then a Conqueror would have done with all his Army; by the contrary reason wee may gather that the true Father of his Country hath had a speciall care of us in advancing M. de Brassac to the government of this Province, and meant herein to honour the memory of his abode there, and to make happy that Land, where perhaps he first conceived those great designes which hee hath since effected. I should not have spoken so much in this point if I did not know that you mislike not in mee these kinds of excesse; and if it were not the vice of Lovers now adayes to speake of the object of their love without all limits. Besides, I have beene willing to make you forget the beginning of my Letter by the length of the middle, and by a more pleasing second discourse, to take from you the ill taste I had given you by the first. And so adue Mounsieur Choler, never feare that I will provoke you againe; it was my evill Angell that cast this temptation

upon me to make me unhappy; I might have beene wise by the example of—whom you handled so hardly in presence of—I shall be better advisde hereafter: and will never be
                     
                        Sir, 
                        But your, &amp;c.

                     SIr, if you take mee for a man hungry of Newes, you do not know me; and if I have asked you for any, it is because I had none to tell you; and because I must have something to say, I have done it against the streame of my resolution quite, which is, to quit the world both in body and minde: but custome is a thing we often fall into by flying it; and we sweare sometimes that we will not sweare; I desire so little to learne that I know not, that I would be glad to forget that I know, and to be like those good Hermites who enquired how cities were made, and what kind of thing a King or a Commonwealth was; I am well assured that Paris will not be removed out of its place that Rochell will not be surprized againe by Guiton; that petty Princes will not devest great Kings;

that favour will never want Panegyricks and Sonnets; that the Court will never be without Sharkes and Cheaters: that Vertue will ever be the most beautifull, and the most unprofitable thing in the world. And what can you write in the generall of affaires, that hath not relation to one of these points? And for my owne particular, what can I heare, but that either some Booke is written against me, or that my Pension is like to be ill paid, or that I shall not be made an Abbot, unlesse I be my selfe the Founder of the Abby: such newes would be terrible to a man more interressed than my selfe, but to me, they are in a manner indifferent, and trouble mee no more, than if you should tell me it will be foule weather all this Moone, or that the water is growne shallow in our river, or that a tree in my Wood hath been overturned by tempest. I have had heretofore some pretentions to Church preferments, but now they are all reduced to this one preferment of being a good Ch

I would corrupt—, I make my selfe

this promise Sir, that you will stand strongly in defence of your innocent friend, and that in so just a protection you will embarque also that excellent personage, of whom you speake in your letter. I am, as you know, unhappy enough not to know her, but seeing the honest men of Greece have used to adore upon adventure, and built Altars to unknowne Deities, it may as well be lawfull for me to use devotion to this Saint upon the credit of the people of Rome, who have now these three yeares looked upon her, as upon one of the true Originalls, whereof they revere the Statues; they all agree in this, that since the Porciaes and the Corneliaes there never was any thing scene comparable to this; and that those divine women, which were the domesticall Senate of their husbands, and the rivalls of their vertue, have no other advantage over this French Lady, but that they died in an age of funerall Orations. You send mee word that you finde her in the same estate you left her, and that she is now as fresh and amiable as ever she was, and I easily beleeve it; this long continued state of youth is no doubt the recompence, of her extraordinary vertue: the calme within sweetens and cleares the ayre without, and from the obedient passions of her minde, there riseth neither wind nor cloud to taint the purenesse of her complexion, as there are certaine temperate Climates which bring forth Roses all the yeare long; and where it is counted for a wonder, that such a day it was cold or snowed: so are there likewise certaine

faces priviledged, preserved to the end of old age, in the happy estate of their infancie, and never lose the first blossomming of their beautie. But it is not for a man buried in the darkenesse of a Desart, to talke of the most illustrious matter that si in the world: it befits me rather to reade that over again which you have written, than to adde any thing to it, &amp; for feare least any word should scape from me that is not Courtly, and which may marre all I have said already, without further discourse, I assure you that I am,

                        Your, &amp;c.

                     SIr, I take great joy to heare you harken after me, &amp; that you neede no remembrancer to put you in minde to be mindfull of me. This thought of yours is so much the more deare unto me, because it comes from a heart that ha

                        eing thought of. This ought to be the ambition of men that are worth ought, and a vertue that is not approved of you, shewes there is something in it that is defective. If then I have this marke, I have the seale and confirmation of the true good, I have both

                        he good fortunes, that of Vertue, and that of your Favour, and herein at least I have some resemblance of an honest man. There are some whom blinde chance hath lifted up above you, of whom I cannot speake in this manner, one may set their blame and their praise in equall degree of indifferencie, and there is no Obligation to follow them in their Opinions, but when they get it by constraint, or else by purchase, all their greatnesse is in their Titles, there scarce appeares upon them one little beame of it in dayes of Ceremony; and if they will have us to respect them, they must be faine to send a Herauld to put us in minde. For you Sir, it is not onely upon the Bench that the world reveres you, but your authority followes you wheresoever you are; shee accompanies you even in your ordinary conversation: you cannot so disguise your selfe; but that I shall alwayes take you for a Judge; and this gravity of your countenance, which changes every word you speake into a Decree, and gives a dignity to your very silence, may serve to verifie that Paradoxe of the Stoikes, That a wise man can never be a private person; and that

It is not the noyse and the flashes that make the faire dayes, it is a calme and cleare Aire; and a life led in tranquilitie and judgement, which is the worke of Reason, is preferrable before one halfe of the great successe the world admires, which are but the extravagancies of Fortune. See here the Decree of a Countrie Phylosopher, and matter of meditation for one of your walkes at Yssy. To tell you true, I have a great longing to come upon you one day on the sudden, and to surprize you in some of your conferences, but it shall be then with a purpose to returne as soone as I have seene you, without so much as seeing Paris; to make you thereby see, I can with more ease, goe a

hundred miles for a man I love, than foure paces for the miracle of the world. Such a bravery would be an affront, &amp; subject to interpretation not I suppose; yet I am assured thatthose who are diseased with opinion, and infected with custome, would make no ill censure of it, and it little concernes me, that the common people condemne me; if you, and those other good men doe justifie me, and beleeve that I am

                     To Mounsieur Chaplain. LETTER. XV.
                     SIR, Expect not from me a Regular Answer to your letters; for besides that I yeeld an absolute assent to all they containe, and that in treating with you, I desire rather to beleeve than to dispute, and to be found faithfull rather than reasonable, I should doe wrong to the acknowledgement I owe unto you, to make you see it, in the pensivenesse I am now in, and to dislustre so pure a matter with the impression of so blacke a vapour. I therefore reserve it for fairer dayes: when my minde shall enjoy its former serenity; and that I shall possesse it

without distraction at that time if I continue my ill occupation, and after I have plaid a Prince, it comes in my fancy to play a friend: you, I assure you, must be the man I shall set before my eyes; and shall not seeke a mor
                           •…
                         illustrious Originall, nor a more remote: yet it grives me Sir, that you should love with so little successe: it is not reasonable you should weary your selfe in a soyle that will beare nothing, and that you should take pleasure to imploy your husbandry in tilling of stones and thornes; you can never dive to the bottome of my ill fortune; you are, I denie not a powerfull agent, but it must be upon an apt subject; your industry is great, but Art corrects not destiny, and I am ashamed to see, that all humane wisedome should be unprofitablely imploied in governing of me, when whole common wealths are governed sometimes with lesse adoe, a whole fleete would not put you to so much labour as one poore barke; and to succour one particular person, you must enter combate against heaven and earth. It is better Sir, that this perpetuall Object of scandall be removed by my absence; and that I leave peace to my friends by leaving the field to my adversaries. This resolution is not so unmanly as some would point it out unto me, change onely the termes; and that which they call cowardice and running away, is but to be better advised &amp; to yeeld to the time. I have read a word in a letter which Cicero writ to Brutus that confirmes me much in this opinion;

You withdrew your selfe, saith he, out of a corrupted city, you gave place to Varlets; for you Stoickes say, That a wise man never runnes away. Cato himselfe, who would rather die, than live to see a Tyranny; was he not resolved to goe voluntarily into banishment for avoiding a more supportable evill? And thinke you, that hee had more reason to love his liberty, than I to love my quiet? Or that his griefe was more just than mine? As all resistences are not honest, so neither are all flights shamefull, and as there are some naughty joyes, so there are some reasonable griefes; and you shall see in the Paraphrase of your friend, that for a disgrace which Saint Paul received at Ephesus, his heart failed him, and he grew weary of his life. The authority of so great an example, bindes you to pardon in me, the weakenesses you charge me with; for my selfe, mee thinks I heare continually sounding in my eares, the voice that cried to Arsenius, Fuge, sede, tace; which seemes to councell me, to give my selfe satisfaction by my quiet, and to give others contentment by absenting my selfe, and by my silence. Some further reasons I will acquaint you with, when I shall have the honour to see you; having no meaning to doe any thing without your liking, and without your leave; whose I am

                     To Mounsieur de Nesmond Counsellor to the King, and Controller of the Princes House. LETTER. XVI.
                     SIR, my deare Cousin, wee were put in hope we should have the happinesse to see you in this country, and that here you would make one of the reposes of your voyage, but you have not beene pleased to make us so happie; It seemes you thought not our walkes pleasant enough for you, you scorne now the fountaines of Maillou, and the river of Balzac; these sweet Objects, which heretofore gained your inclinations, and enchanted the innocencie of your tender yeares, are not now able to excite in you the least desire, nor so much as to tempt your graver age. I finde in this something to be offended at, and whereof to complaine. If you had to doe with a Poet, hee would make a mighty quarrell betweene you and the Deities of the Woods and Waters; and would send you most reproachfull Elegies in behalfe of the Nymphes whom you have scorned. But it makes well for you that I understand not the language of the Gods, and that I can speake no otherwise than the common people doe: this will defend you from a

number of naughtie Verses; and I will say nothing to you more spightfull than this, that you seeme to reserve your selfe all for Paris, and feare to be prophaned with the basenesse of a Village. Princes and their affaires leave not in you so much as one poore thought for us; and the pleasures of the country are too grosse and meager, for a taste that is used to more delicate and solid pleasures. You see Sir, my deare cousin, that my complaints are sweete, and that I justifie you in accusing you. It is certaine, there is a part of the active life, which one may call delightfull; and though Vertue have her joy with lesse tumult than Vice, yet the very secrecie of her joy augmenteth also the sweetnesse, and vapours not out the puritie thereof; and so it happens, that while you sought but after honesty, you have found withall delight also: you dreamed but of being vertuous and profitable to your Country, and into the bargaine, you have contentment also and pleasure for your selfe. For in effect considering your humour, I doubt not but the paines you take, is your sufficient recompence for the paines you take, and that your very action keepes you in breath; or rather refresheth you; and as one in Aristotle said, That it was a death to him, when hee was not in some office; so I verily beleeve, that to take away imployments from you, were as much as to take away your life, and that you would refuse even felicitie it selfe if it were offered you without having some thing to doe.

You doe well to love a burden that graceth you more than it weighes, and not to thinke it a trouble to be in a race which you have entred with as much applause as they can desire that are going out. You have beene mens joy, from the instant you were first seene, and your many imployments that have since so happily succeeded, have but ratified the good opinion that was had of you being yet unknowne. There are some men that get more reputation by playing upon advantage; but yours is a lawfull acquest, and this integritie which hath nothing in it, either fierce or fearefull, this learning which is neither clownish nor quarrelsome this course which can avoid Precipices without turning out of the right way, are none of the qualities with which men use to abuse the world, none of the enchantments which you make use of to dazle our eyes. And though our eyes were capable of illusion, yet having merited the grace &amp; favour of a Prince, the clearest fighted the hea
                           •…
                        ens ever made, and whose gift I value lesse than his judgement; It is not for us any longer to examine your sufficiencie seeing he hath chosen you for an instrument of managing his affaires. You would not beleeve the pleasures that Madam Co
                              •…
                           pagnole and my selfe take in the consideration of this matter; and what reflection wee receive of all those good successes that accrew unto you; I can assure you, she forgets you not in her devotions, and if God but heare her prayers, you, neede not make any wishes for your selfe; We promised

our selves wee should see you in our Desarts, but since your honour calls you otherwhere; it is reason we rest satisfied with so sweete a necessity, and to beare with patience that the publicke hath neede of your service. It is farre from me to preferre a short satisfaction of my eyes before the long and durable joyes I expect from the progresse of your reputation; and if I should desire that for your comming hither you should put your selfe the farther off from your ends, my desires should bee indiscreet, and I should not be the man I ought to be.
                     
                        Sir, my deare Cosin, 
                        Your, &amp;c.
                        From Balzac 1. Octob. 1632.
                        
                     
                  
                  
                     To Mounsieur de Pontac Monplesir. LETTER XVII.
                     SIR, my deare Cosin, if the counsaile I have given you did not give me an interest in the resolution you have taken, yet I could not chuse but acknowledge it to bee good, considering the good successe it hath produced. It is true that till now I never liked of long deliberations, nor of stayd lovers; but seeing your wisedome hath concluded in favour of

your love, and that it is no longer an idle contemplation of the person you love; I seeme to conceive the designe you had in drawing out the lines of your love to such a length; in which it cannot be sayd there hath beene time lost, but that you would taste all the sweetnesse of hope before you would come to that of possession; this is not to be irresolute but subtill, and not to make a stoppe of contentments but to husband them. This is not to have an apprehension of being happy, but to have a desire to be happy twice, so that in this point you are fully justified. This circumspection which I accused wrongfully, and which is equally remooved from Furie and Effeminatenesse, puts the passions into a just and durable temper, and makes the minde capable of its felicitie by a serious preparation; and I vow unto you that the life you have begun was well worthy you should take some time to study it; It is not fit to enter the state of marriage rashly, and by the conduct of Fortune; all the eyes that prudence hath are not too many to serve for a guide in this businesse; many men fall into a snare whilst they thinke to finde a treasure, and errours are there mortall where repentance is unprofitable; but God be thanked you are out of danger, and your happinesse is in sanctuary. There is no Nectar nor Roses now but for you; (accept from mee I pray this one word of a wedding Complement) and in the estate you are in, what are you not? Since a Conquerour that is crowned

is but the figure of a lover that injoyes; the lover receiving that really which the Conqueror but dreames. You offend not the peoples eyes with proud inscriptions, nor astonish them with the clamour of your conquest; you celebrate your triumphs covertly, and draw no mans envie upon you; you reigne by your selfe alone, and all the pompe which greatnesse drawes after it, is not comparable to that which you injoy in secret. I am not acquainted with lawfull pleasures, and ought not to bee with forbidden; but I have heard it sayd, that in the first there is a certaine peace of spirit, &amp; a confident contentment which is not found in the other: And as the Hony is lesse gathered from the flowers then from the deaw which falls from the stars; so these chaste pleasures are seasoned from heaven &amp; receive their perfection from the heavenly grace and not from their owne nature. I have learned from the antient Sages, that there is not a more antient nor a more excellent friendship then this; that in this sweet societie greefes are divided, and joyes doubled, and that a good wife is a catholieon or universall remedy for all the evills that happen in life. I doubt not but she whom you have chosen is worthy of this name; and though I should hold your testimony in suspition; yet I have heard it deposed with so great advantage on her part; and by so tender and judicious spirits, that I am not onely glad in your behalfe for the good company you have gotten you, but give you thankes also in my

owne behalfe for the good allyance you have brought me. I am exceeding impatient till I see her, that I may betweene her hands abjure my wrong opinions; and if neede bee, make honorable amends before her for all the blasphemies I have heretofore written against marriage. I solemnely by this Letter ingage my selfe to doe it, and intreate you to dispose her, that shee may accept my retractations, which proceede from a heart truly penitent and full of passion, to testifie to you both, that I am

                     To Mounsieur Huggens, Counsellor and Secretary to my Lord the Prince of Orange. LETTER. XVIII.
                     SIR, your Letter hath runne great hazards before it arrived here; It wandred about seaven moneths together, and that now at last it is come to my hands; I ascribe it to the remorse of a man unknowne, who being but halfe wicked, contented himselfe onely with opening it, but would not by any meanes that I should lose it. Happy were I if I could as

well recover other things I greeve for, and that I could say, hee were but strayed whom I loved with my heart; but I have lost him for ever, and you are never able to restore mee that I lent you; yet I lay it not to your charge, nor to the charge of your innocent Country. I am not of that mans humour, who spake a thousand villanies against poore Troy, and taxed all her Histories and Fables, because (forsooth) his brother dyed there, and perhaps of a maladie that he had gotten somewhere else. My greefe is wiser then his, I should take my losse unkindly at your hands, if you were your selfe the richer for it, but now the losse is common to us both; we both lament a common friend, and your selfe have rather the greater share in this sad societie, in as much as herein you have advantage over me, for having performed to him the last duties. Hee saw your teares fall amongst his blood, you filled your eyes and your spirit with all circumstances of his death, and I doubt not but it hindred you from being perfectly sensible of the victory at Mastrich, and to shew a joyfull countenance in the most joyfull day of all your Princes life. For my selfe, I am not as yet capable of consolation, yet have layd upon my wound all the plasters Philosophie could minister. Mee thinkes my griefe is to mee in place of my friend; I possesse it with a kind of sweetnesse, and am so tender of it, that I should thinke it a second losse, if I had it not to passe my time withall; yet I must intreate it a little forbearance,

that I may have time to make you an account of your liberalitie, and that you may know what is become of the presents you sent me; I received them Sir after your Letter, and that by another kind of adventure. I have imparted them to the worthiest persons of our Province, I am at this time adorning my Closet with them, and make more reckoning of them then of all the riches your Havens can shew, or then all the pretious rarities the Sea brings to you from the farthest parts of the earth. There is as much difference betweene your friends stile, and that of other Panegyrists, as betweene the stoutnesse of a Souldier and the coynesse of a Courtesan. This manly eloquence full of mettall and courage, seemes rather to fight then to discourse; and rather to aide the King of Sweden then to praise him. The ordering of his Tragedie is according to the rules and intention of Aristotle; precise decencie most religiously observed, The verses lofty and worthy of a Theater of Ivory. Every part pleased me, but that of the Chorus'es even ravished me, and because I sigh alwayes after Italy, that Chorus of the Romane Souldiers put me in passion; I finde my selfe touched with it at the very quicke, and in all company where I come I cannot forbeare crying out, as if I were in rapture with divine fury: O laeta otia Formiae; Lucrini O tepids lacus, Baiarum O medii dies; O sola Elysiis aemula vallibus: Lassi temperies Maris: Campani via littoris, lia Baccho ac Cereri vetus, &amp;c, I have onely

                        le a naturall body should be formed of two as differing peeces as are in my opinion, the Iewish religion and the Heathenish. My doubt growes from my ignorance, and not from presumption: I aske, as desirous to learne, and not to picke a quarrell, specially with a man, who in such Criticismes is a King, and whom I acknowledge for the true and lawfull successor of the great Scaliger; I have read his two Tracts upon the Satyre of Horace, which are indeede two Master-peeces; and I doe not thinke, I ever saw together so much antiquitie renued, so much reason displaied, so much subtiltie fortified with so much force. Hee stands not dreaming upon a word of no difficultie, erecting as it were Trophees of like passages, after the fashion of our Note-makers now adayes, who heape up places upon places, and bring nothing in their writings, but the cruditie and indigestion of their reading. He handles Grammar like a Philosopher, and makes Bookes to be subject to Reason; and the authority which time hath given them to the Principles, which truth hath established; he hath discovered that Idea of art, which the best workemen never yet came neere, and hath added that last perfection, which shewes spots and impuritie in the most elaborate writings. I have a great designe

Sir, to goe make my selfe an Artist under his discipline, and to be at once both your Courtier and his Schollar. I have thought upon this Voyage a yeare since; but I would faine your warres would make passage for mee the way I would goe, and that there were nothing Spanish betweene Paris and the Hage. The sanctitie of Oratours and Poets is not reverenced over all the world, they beare no awe amonst Barbarians; these publike enemies would not spare Apollo himself, nor the Muses, and my person would find as little respect at their hands as my Booke did, which in full councell they caused to be burnt by the hands of the Marquesse of Aytona, yet I think you may say, you never heard speake of a more illustrious Executioner, nor of one that doth more honour to his trade; and that the Counts of Egmont and Horne were not handled in their punishment with such pompe and state. I dare not laugh Sir, at this extravagant crueltie. The Truce I had taken is expired, and I cannot possibly stretch the leave which my griefe gave me any further. I therefore leave you to returne to her, and end with swearing, Per illos manes numina doloris nostri, that there is nothing in the world more deare unto mee than your friendship, and that I am with all my soule,

                     SIR, my deare Cosin, I never doubted of your affection towards me, but I thought it proceeded of pittie rather then of merit; and that having nothing considerable in me, but my ill fortune; your good nature was thereby onely excited to doe me this charitie, but now I see, you propose to your selfe a more noble Object, and thinke to finde a better reason for your loving me; yet I know not whether it be so just as the former, and whether you may as lawfully respect a vulgar person as you may protect an unfortunate? If I had had any such seedes of goodnesse in me as you speake of, my ill fortune would have stifled all their vertue. Nothing can bud forth in an aire perpetually tempestuous. It is not enough for the labouring man that he take paines in his husbandry, and that his soyle be good, but there must be a sweetnesse of the season also to favour his trauell: which I have hitherto proved so contrary, that I wounder how I have the heart to be alwayes planting for tempests to spoile. I finde more good for me in idlenesse than in labour, and more gaine by doing nothing than by doing well. When I am idle, I am at least at

quiet; and envy rests as well as I, but as soone as once I offer but to stirre, there is presently an alarum raised in the Latine Province: and opposition is made before I have conceived any thing to be opposed. Other mens good deedes are rewarded, mine onely, if any of mine be worthy the name, must looke for nothing but defacing: a very hard suiteit would be, but to get their pardon: and I follow not vertue, onely without reward, but I follow her with danger. You thinke not withstanding that I take a pleasure in this ungratefull occupation; and that I have a greater forwardnesse to it, than I finde resistance. You thinke my spirit should never shrinke for ill successes, and that of its owne fertiltie without either one beame of the Sunne, or one droppe of dew, and at the mercy of all windes, it is able to budde and bring forth some thing. You judge too favourably of a vigor that is halfe extinguished, and consider not that melancholy indeede, is ingenious and pregnant when it comes from the temper which Aristotle commendeth, but that it is drie and stupid when it proceedes from the continuall outrages of adverse fortune. And therefore Sir, my deare Cousin, expect nothing from me to answer your expectation, and to merit the veneration you speake of in your letter. I cannot endure such a great word in your mouth; are you not afraid to come under my office of a Grammarian? One such improper terme is unexcusable, unlesse it be you had relation to that old Verse, Res est sacra miser;
                        
or to that brave fellow in the controversies of Seneca, who in the life time of the Oratour Cestius, but upon the wane of his spirit, affirmed that he reverenced his very Cynders, and would use to sweare by his shadow, and by his memory. It shall suffice me that you handle me in this manner, that Mounsieur your President and your selfe would sometimes say in lamenting me, he had beene further off than now he is, if he had met with fewer ambushes in his way. I require your recommendation of my service to that rare personage, whom I dare not call the last of the French; I remember what was laid to Cremutius Cordus his charge; but how ever, I account him worthy of the antient France, and of the Senate which we have not seene, that had the honour to be Arbitrator betweene the Emperour and the Pope; a mediator betweene the King and his People. I require from you but onely the like favour, and I acquit you of your veneration, provided that you keepe for me your good will, which I cannot lose if you be just, since I am.

                     SIR, the account I make of you is farre from being a scorne. One should doe you wrong to take you for any other than your selfe; and it would be a hard matter to finde a man for whom you could be changed without losse. I see therefore your drift, you would not thinke the number of your Vertues compleate, if you added not humility, and you would make me see that there are Capuchine Huguenots. Indeede a fine noveltie, but it belongs not to you, to be so modest; nor to take upon you Perfection who have not yet attained Conversion. To speake uprightly, your respects and your submissions are not sufferable, men used to speake otherwise in the golden age; and to say nothing more hardly of you, you are too unjust a valuer of your selfe. Doe what you can, you are never any more able to weaken the Testimony which Madam de Loges, and Mounsieur Chapelain have given of you, then you can deny me your friendship which I crave of you in their name. You see how contagious an ill example is; and how I imitate you in condemning you. I can play the Reserved as well as you, and seeke for mediators and favour to obtaine that favour you have granted me already. These are the subtilties of my passion, to the

end I may taste a second joy; I will make you tell me twice one thing; I will have you once again lay forth your letter to our former view, thereby to husband the better for so long time, the pleasure I take to heare you assure me that you love me. Such assurances should perswade me but little in the mouth of many men; but for you, I know with what Religion you make your promises, &amp; of what holinesse your word is. I know you approve of no lies, but those of the Muses, and that fictions in Poetry you can beare withall, but banish them from your conversation; I am glad therefore I have found one face among so many vyzards, and that I can lay hold of something, I can feele, and that hath truth in it. It is nothing but the freedome of my minde that gives mee the boldnesse to approach other vertues, with all which I am at defiance, if I finde not this freedome in their companie. By this Sir, you have wo

These flashes have so often abused me, that I am now growne to be afraid of any thing lookes r

                        d de, least it should be fire and burne me. I suspect these Barkes that are so painted and guilded over, I have often made shipwracke in such: I desire those that are sound and safe, and enter them as Vessells to sayle in, and not as Galleries to walke in. When I speake of a friend, I meane not a companion in

trade or in disorder, nor one that can returne visites the next day aftet hee hath received them, and is not failing in the least duties of a civile life, but I meane, a witnesse of the conscience: a Physitian of secret griefes, a moderatour in prospe ritie; and a guide in adversitie. I have some few left me of this sort, but have had many losses, and very lately one, which but for you would be irreparable; you whom God hath sent to comfort me, and whom I substitute in the place of one of the honestest men that was in France. Our contract if you please shall be short and plaine. I will propose no matter of lustre to engage you in it; onely I assure you my heart, and a sinceritie answerable to yours. It is now of proofe from the most dangerous Ayre of Christendome, I have brought it from Rome, I have preserved it at Paris; It is not therefore likely that to deceive you, I am come to lose it in a Village; and that I have any designe to falsifie my faith; seeing I assure you, I will ever be

                     To———LETTER. XXI.
                     SIR, since you will have me to write that in a letter, which I spake unto you by word of mouth, this Letter shall be a second testimony of the account I make of—, and of the feeling I have of the courtesies received from him. During the time wee had his company, I considered him with much attention; but in my conscience observed nothing in the motions of his spirit, but great inclinations to great designes, and to see him doe wonders in the world, you neede wish him no more but matter of imployment. Hee hath all the Intendments of an honest man, all the Characters of a great Lord: by these he gaines mens eyes in present, and their hearts in expectation, and afterwards brings more goodnesse forth than ever he promised, and exceedes expectation with performance. And in truth, if this Heroick countenance had no wares to vent but vulgar qualities, this had beene a tricke put upon us by Nature, to deceive us by hanging out a false signe. The charge hee exerciseth in the Church, is no burden to him, hee hath in such sort accōmodated his humour to it, that in the most painefull functions of so high a duty, there lies nothing upon his shoulders, but ease and delight. He embraceth generally all that

hee beleeves to be of the decencie of his profession, and is neither tainted with the heate which accompanies the age wherein he is, nor with the varietie which such a birth as his doth commonly bring with it. In a word the way he takes goes directly to Rome. Hee is in good grace with both the Courts, and the Pope would be as willing to receive the Kings commendation of him, as the King would be to give it. He hath brought from thence a singular approbation, and hath left behind him in all the holy Colledge a most sweete odour, and that without making faces; or making way to reputation by singularitie. For in effect, what heate soever there be in his zeale, hee never suffers it to blaze beyond custome: his piety hath nothing either weake or simple, it is serious all and manly, and he protesteth, it is much better to imitate S. Charles, than to counterfeit him. Concerning his passion of horses, which he calls his malady; since hee is not extreme in it, never counsell him to cure it, it is not so bad as either the Sciatica or the 
                           •…
                        out; and if he have no other disease but that, hee hath not much to doe for a Physitian. One may love Horses innocently, as well as Flowers and Pictures: and it is not the love of such things, but the intemperate love that is the vice. Of all beasts that have any commerce with men, there are none more noble nor better conditioned; and of them a great Lord may honestly and without disparagement be curious. Hee indeede might well be said to be sicke of them,

who can sed mangers of Ivory to be made for them, and gave them, full measures of peeces of gold; this was to be sicke of them, to bestow the greatest part of his estate upon beautifying his Stable, and to make a mocke what men said or thought of chusing a Consull by his horses neighing. You shall give me leave to tell you another story to this purpose, not unpleasant. It is of Theophylact, Patriarch of Constantinople, who kept ordinarily two thousand horses, and fedde them so daintily, that in stead of Barley and Oates, which to our horses are a feast, hee gave them Almonds, Dates, and Pistache nuts; and more than this, as Cedrenus reports, he watered them long time before in excellent wine, and prepared them with all sorts of precious odours. One day as hee was solemnizing his Office in the Church of Saint Sophia; one came and told him in his eare, that his Mare Phorbante had foaled a Colt; with which hee was so ravished, that instantly without having the patience to finish his Service, or to put off his Pontificall Robes, hee left the mysteries in the midst, and ranne to his Stable to see the good newes hee had heard, and after much joy expressed for so happy a birth, he at last returned to the Altar, and remembred himselfe of his dutie which the heate of his passion had made him to forget. See Sir, what it is to dote upon horses; but to take a pleasure in them, and to take a care of them, this no doubt may make a man bee said to love them: and neverthelesse not the lesse the wiser man.

Even Saints themselves have their pleasures and their pastimes, all their whole life is not one continued miracle; they were not every day foure and twentie houres in extasie amidst their Gifts, their Illuminations, their Raptures, their Visions; they had alwayes some breathing time of humane delight, during all which time they were but like us: and the Ecclesiasticall Story tells us, that the great Saint Iohn, who hath delivered Divinitie in so high a straine, yet tooke a pleasure, and made it his pastime to play with a Partridge which he had made tame and familiar to him. I did not thinke to have gone so farre; it is the subject that hath carried me away, and this happens very often to mee when I fall into discourse with you. My complements are very short, and with men that are indifferent to mee, I am in a manner dumbe; but with those that are deare unto mee, I neither observe Rule nor Measure; and I hope you doubt not, but that I am in the highest degree,
                     
                        Sir,  
                        Your, &amp;c.

                     To Mounsieur Godeau. LETTER. XXII.
                     SIR, there is no more any merit in being devout; Devotion is a thing, so pleasing in your Booke, that even prophane persons find a rellish in it, and you have found out a way how to save mens soules with pleasure. I never found it so much as within this weeke, that you have fedde mee with the dainties of the antient Church, and feasted me with the Agapes of your Saint Paul. This man was not altogether unknowne to me before, but I vow unto you, I knew him not before, but onely by sight; though I had sometimes beene neare unto him, yet I could never marke any more of him than his countenance and his outside: your Paraphrase hath made me of his counsell, and given me a part in his secrets; and where I was before but one of the Hall, I am now one of the Closet, and see clearely and distinctly what I saw before but in cloudes, and under shadowes. You are to say true, an admirable Decipherer of Letters, in some passages to interpret your subtilty is a kinde of Devotion, &amp; thoroughout the manner of your expressing is a very charme. I am too proud to flatter you, but I am just enough to be a witnesse of the truth; and I vow unto you, it never perswades me more that when it borrowes your style.

There reflects from it a certaine flash which pleaseth instantly as beauty doth, and makes things to be lovely before one knowes they are to be loved. Your words are no way unworthy of your Authour, they neither weaken his conceits by stretching them out at length, nor scatter the sence by spreading it out in breadth. But contrariwise the powerfull spirit which was streightened within the bounds of a concise stile, seemes to breath at ease in this new libertie, and to encrease it selfe as much as it spreads it selfe: hee seemes to passe from his fetters into triumph, and to goe forth of the prisons of Rome where Nero shut him up, to enter into a large kingdome, into which you bring him with royall magnificence. There are some so curious palats, they cannot rellish the language of the Sonne of God, and are so impudent as to accuse the holy Scriptures of clownishnesse and Barbarisme, which made Monsieur—, who died Archbishop of Benevent, that he durst not say his Breviary, hee was afraid to marre his good Latin by contagion of the badde, and to take some tincture of impuritie that might corrupt his eloquence. I will not speake at this time what I conceive of his scruple; onely I say that if in the vulgar Translation there bee Barbarisme, yet you have made it civill, and if our good Malherbe should come againe into the world, he would finde nothing in your paraphrase that were not according to the strictnesse of his Rules, and the usage of the Court whereof he

spake so often. Some other time we will conferre about the Preface, and the letters I received, which I have in a manner all by heart, but specially I have culled out these deare words to print in my memory, and to comfort my spirits. A little patience will crowne you, all their throwes seeme like those of sicke men, a l

Honest persons are for you, and I make account you care not much for pleasing others. The people have often times left Terence for dancers upon the Rope, and banished Philosophers, to gratifie Iesters. I have nothing to adde to this; and will take heede how I sow Purple with packethread. I content my selfe Sir, at this time to assure you that I passionately am,

                     SIR, I will not raise to you the price of my teares, though I have shed them for you 8. dayes together: I content my selfe to tell you that I am now comforted since, the newes of your death, is changed into tidings of your hurt; and that I am made assured, you may be quitted of it, for a little paine and a little patience. I know well that Vertue is more happily imployed in well using honest pleasures, than in patient bearing troublesome crosses, and that without an absolute distemper in the taste, one can never finde any sweetnesse in paine: yet you shall confesse unto me, that there is a kinde of contentment in being lamented; and though the joyes of the minde be not so sensible as those of the body, yet they are more delicate and more subtill, at least, you have come to know of what worth you are by the feare, which all honest men were in to lose you, and that in a time when halfe the world weighs the other way; and every one reserves his lamentation for his owne miseries; yet all in generall have mourned for you, in such sort Sir, that you have had the pleasure to heare your owne Funerall Oration, and to enjoy the continuance of a happy life, after receiving the honours done to worthy men after death. If

the warre of Italy continue till Winter, I will come and learne from your owne mouth, all the particulars of your adventures, and I shall then know if your Philosophy have not beene moved, and waxed pale, at the sight of the Probe, and of the Rasour. In the meane time doe me the honour to be mindefull of him who exceedingly honours you, and to keepe for me that part in your affection which you have promised me, since I truly am,

                     SIr I had heard that before, which you sent me word off by your footeman; and had rejoyced already, for the new Dignity of Mounsieur the President Segnier. It seemes you thinke he is made Keeper of the Seales, for none but for you, and that no Feast for the joy of it should be kept any where, but at Cadillac. Within these fourē daies, you shall see it kept all the Country over; it is a favour the King

hath done the whole Realme. It is not so much for the purity of the Aire, and for the fruitefulnesse of the earth, that we ought to call it a happy yeare, as for the election of worthy Magistrates. I therefore take a joy in this Newes,

                         Lam a Subject of the Kings; &amp; this is my first part of joy I have in it: but beyond this, I have a second Right of rejoycing, in that I am interessed in the advancement of a modesty, which I know; &amp; make account to be made happy, by the prosperity of him, of whose honesty I am assured. I put not forth this last word, at adventure: I am ready to make it good, against whosoever shall thinke it rash, and I know he hath preservatives against all the Poysons of the Court; and a judgement that cannot be corrupted with all the bribes of Fortune. There is nothing of so high a price, for which hee would be willing to leave his vertue: if hee had lived in Neroes time; he had beene a constant Martyr, but living now under a just Prince he will proove a profitable Officer. To preserve a life, which is to continue but a few daies: he would not obscure that life, which ought to

                        ot upon his honour, would be more insupportable to him, then the effusion of all his blood. He knowes that in the administration of Iustice, being the Interpretor of God; he cannot worke of himselfe; that this Divine Act ought to be a Generall Suspension from all humane affections, and that in the exercise thereof, he is no longer at his liberty, to shew love

or hatred; revenge or gentlenesse. He considers that he makes not law, but onely declares it, that he is a Minister, and not a Master of his Authority, and that the Soveraignty is in the Law, and not in himselfe. This is the reason why in every cause he censures, he bethinkes himselfe of his owne proper cause, which shall one day be censured; he so judgeth, as if Posterity were to take a review of his Iudging; and as though the present time, were but subalternate to the future. Thus I have heard him to make his account; and from his Principles I have drawne my conclusions, and in a conference I had sometimes with him; he seemed to me a better man then I have set him forth. In such sort Sir, that I am not of a minde to contradict you, in your writing of him to me, you say nothing wch is not of my knowledg, &amp; in my writing of him to you, I do nothing but follow your conceits. Never feare that the common errors will deprave his Spirit, he hath laid too sure a foundation in the knowledge of Truth, he is too strongly confirmed in the good Sect. Having often and seriously meditated on the conditiō of humane affaires, he values them just as much as they are worth, but hee addes nothing by opinion, he hates neither riches nor authoritie; this were the peevish humour of the Cynicks, to hate a thing that in it selfe is lovely, he makes use of them after the manner of the Academy, and of the Lycaeum, which never thought them impediments to happinesse, but rather aides and furtherances to Vertue.

Or may we not say more probably that he hath drawne his doctrines from a Spring nearer hand; and that hee hath not gone out of himselfe to finde out the truest wisedome? Hee hath examples at home, which may serve him for Idaeas of perfection, and Sages in his owne race, which are Artists of vertuous life. Whilst he governes himselfe by their Rules, hee may well passe by all forraine doctrines; and having his diseased Vncle before his eyes; hee neede not care to have Socrates for a myrrour: Quippe malim unum Catonem quam trecentos Socratas. The memory of this illustrious personage is in such veneration thorough all France, and his name hath preserved so excellent an Odour in the prime Tribunall of Christendome; that it is not now so much the name of a Family; as it is the name even of integritie and constancy it selfe. Remember the Greeke Epigramme I shewed you in a Manuscript; which saith, that in a place at Athens when one named Plutarch, there was an Eccho answered Philosophy, as taking the one for the other, and making no difference betweene the two. By the like reason the Muses might use the same Figure, and act the like miracle, in favour of this new Pillar of justice. They never neede to use reservations; nor feare too deepe engaging themselves, whatsoever they lay forth before hand for his glory, shall all be allowed them againe in the reckoning. Having beene bredde up in their bosome; and being entred into their Sanctuary, he will never suffer them to stand waiting and

catch cold at his gate, no that a Swytzer shall keepe them out from entring his base Court. They shall never have I assure my selfe that unhappy advantage to have given him all; and receive backe nothing from him againe, to have enriched his minde with a thousand rare Knowledges, and then hardly get him to seale them an acquittance. Let us now come to the other part of your Letter; and assay to satisfie your Doctour concerning his Objection. Hee findes fault with me, because I praise the Pope for his beauty, and sayes that such praise is for women and youth, and belongs not to old men and Priests. First Sir I answer, he wrongs mee in changing my termes; for I make a great difference betweene beauty and a good Visage: of this I spake in the person of the Pope, and should never have thought I had committed a sinne, though I had spoken of the other also. As concerning age, you know there are beautifull old men, though there be not beautifull old women, and you remember that antient personage, who by report of History was of equall pleasing to all companies thorough all the ages of his life. As concerning the quality, besides that God rejected in sacrifice all leane and unsound Oblation, 
                           •…
                        e required also to have hansome Priests, and you may shew your friend in the Bookes of Moses, that not onely the lame and pore-blinde, but even the flat nosed, were exclused from being Ministers in sacrificing. But if being as he is a prophane Doctour, the holy Scriptures doe not please him; yet hee

might have remembred that old word of the Tragicke Poet, 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        , upon which I had an eye when I said, This Visage worthy of an Empire. And yet more being a Gascogne Doctour, I wounder hee never read the Panegyricke, which a countrie man of his pronounced at Rome before the Emperour Theodosius; where hee should have found these words; Augustissima quaeque species, plurimum creditur trahere de Coelo; sive enim Divinus ille animus venturus in corpus, dignum prius metatur hospitium, sive cum venerit fingit habitaculum pro habitu suo; sive aliud ex alio crescit; &amp; cum se paria junxerunt utraque major a sunt, parcam Arcanum Coeleste rimari; Tibi istud soli pateat imperator cum Deo consorte secretum. Illud dicam quod intellexisse hominem &amp; dixisse fas est; talem esse debere qui a gentibus adoratur cui toto orbe terrarum privata vel publica vota redduntur; a quo petit Navigaturus serenum, Peregrinaturus reditum, Pugnaturus auspicium. Virtus tua meruit imperium, sed virtuti addidit forma suffragium. Jlla praestitit ut oporteret te principem sieri; haec ut deceret. In this discourse, there are some termes which yet may seeme fitter for a Pope than for an Emperour: and here is to be noted, that Theodosius was no young man, when Latinus Pacatus praised him thus for his beautie, for it was after his defeate of the tyrant Maximus; and when after many victories obtained against the Barbarians, hee was in full and peaceable possession of his glory. Sometime before this Gregory Nazianzon had upbraided

the Emperour Iulian for his ill favoured Visage, for the ill feature of his face, and for other deformities of his body, of which neverthelesse hee was not guilty. Though one might here question the holy Oratour, whether in doing this hee did well or no? Yet from hence wee may at least gather, that the qualities contrary to these hee blames, ought justly and may be lawfully made account of, and that such praises which reflect upon the Creatours glory, are much more Christian than those accusations which trench upon the scorning of his knowledge. Your friend therefore is certainely more severe than hee neede to be. He is much to blame to reject in this sort the blessings of heaven, and the advantages of birth; and to imagine that holinesse cannot be Exemplar and Apostolicke, unlesse it be pale and leane, and looke like one were starved. These are the dreames of Tertullian, who will have it, that our Saviour was in no sort beautifull, and therein gives the lie to all Antiquitie, and to the tradition of the whole Church. He drawes a Picture for him, which is not only injurious to his Divine, but dishonorable also to his humane Nature. This in my opinion is one of his greatest errours, and which most of all startles me in reading his Bookes. If hee would have it, that his watchings and abstinence had dried up his blood, and made him looke gastly; it may perhaps be granted him: but to say, that to the burnt colour of Africke, hee added also that of burnt Melancholy, and of overflowing choler;

I like not such accusing, either the Sunne of that countrie, or the temperature of that body, but leave every one in his naturall estate; and so should he have done. But to goe about to disfigure the most beautifull amongst the children of men, and to eclipse all the beames and lustre of a divine countenance, this is an abuse which no patience can beare, no charitie can ever pardon. You wondered at this strange opinion when I last shewed it unto you; and I perceived you suspected I did him wrong; now therefore to justifie my credit with you, and to let you ree I did it not to abuse you: I send you here the passages I promised you to looke at. The first is in his Booke of Patience; where Christ is called Contumeliosus sibi ipsi. The second in his Booke against the Iewes, where hee is said to be, Ne aspectu quidem honestus, but heare the third, which will fright you to heare, in his Tract of the flesh of Christ; Adeo ut nec humanae honestatis corpus fuit; tacentibus apud nos quoque Prophetis de ignobili aspectu ejus, ipsae passiones, ipsaeque contumeliae loquuntur; passiones quidem humanam carnem; contumeliae vero inhonestam. An ausus esset aliquis ungue summo perstringere corpus novum? Sput aminibus contaminare faciem nisi meruentem, &amp;c. Let us see what Mounsieur Rigaut thinkes of this; and whether he be of these sharpe and soure ones that would take from heaven its starres, and from the earth its flowers. Certainely my censure is of this number; for I perceive beautie offends him, and hee

would easily subscribe to Tertullians opinion. Yet say no more to him of all this, but that which hee must needes know, and spare sending out a second Processe against a man that hath too much of the first, and deserves you should take some care of his quiet; since hee is from the bottome of his heart,

                     To my Lord the Bishop of Nantes. LETTER. XXV.
                     SIR, It is told mee from all parts that you speake of me, as of one that is deare unto you, and of my ill fortune, as of a thing that concernes you. If this tendernesse proceeded from a soft effeminate spirit, yet it would not be without merit; and oblige me infinitely unto you; but now that it comes from a feeling of the purest spirit in the world, and the least capable of weakenesse; how much ought I to esteeme it, and of how great price to value it? It wants not much of making m
                           •…
                        e love that griefe which procures mee so glorious a consolation; and I vow unto you, that to be pittied

of you, is a more pleasing thing than to be favoured of the Court. In that country men goe upon snares and ruines, the best places there are so slippery that few can stand upright; and if the miserable pretenders avoid a sudden falling, it is by enduring a tedious hanging, receiving perpetuall affronts, and returning perpetuall submissions. I therefore like much better to hide my selfe here with your good favour, and my owne good quiet, than to beare a shew there with their frights and soure lookes; and I blesse the winds, and count my Shipwracke happy which hath cast mee backe upon my old home. Some that were more sensible than my selfe, would in this case complaine of the world; but I content my selfe to forget it: I will neither have warre, nor commerce with the world: I have sounded a retreate to all my passions; as well those that be troublesome as those that be pleasing; and I protest unto you Sir, I should reade with more delight, a relation of one of your walkes at Cadillac, then the most delightsome passage of all the German History; when I thinke upon you in company with—, me thinks I see Laelius come to visite Scipio, and confirming him in the resolution he hath taken to stand a loofe from the tumults and turbulencies of worldly affaires, and by a quiet retreate to place his vertue, and his glory in a sure hold. I am extreamely glad of the honour hee will doe my father to passe this way, and bring you along with him; and you may well thinke

that after this I shall not reckon our Village inferiour to Tempe or to Tyvoly. If it were not for the fit of an Ague which is now leaving me, but very quickly to returne, I would goe as farre as Rochel to get before this good fortune, that I might bee at the first opening of those Largesses of the Church, which a mouth so holy and eloquent as yours must needs distribute. But I am not happy enough to see you, and gaine a Iubilee both at once; It must be your pleasure to be so gracious as to accept of such a compliment as I am capable of; and to rest assured with my assuring you by this messenger that I am, and alwayes will be with all the forces of my soule,
                     
                        Sir,

                     Another to the same. LETTER. XXVI.
                     SIR, there are some of your bounties I have cause to complaine of; they are such as cannot be acknowledged, and in the least of your actions you are so great, that if I take measure of my selfe by you. I cannot appeare but very little. Your libertie makes me rich, but withall it discovers my necessitie, there

being no proportion betweene you and mee, how extreme soever my passion be, it can bee no competent price for yours, and in the Commerce that is betweene us, I returne you but Flints for Diamonds, yet I present them to you but in forma pauperis, not as a Mountibanke, and know I give you nothing though I keepe nothing for my selfe. I am well assured Sir that I honour you infinitely, but am infinitely unsatisfied to offer you so meane a thing; there is no reasonable man that doth not as much, and since so much is due to you for onely your vertue, how much am I to pay you more for your affection? Of this last moyitie I am altogether Non solvent; my services; my blood are not all worth it; and I confesse unto you, I shall never be able to deserve but these foure words of your Letter, Non discedo abs te Mi Fili, sed avellor; nor those Delicias in Christo meas; nor this, Dulce decus meum, with which you graced mee at another time. Mounsieur Gyrard who knowes all my secrets, and offers to be an agent for me with you, will tell you with a better grace how sensible I am of your so great favours, and how proud of so illustrious an adoption as you are pleased to honour mee with, of which I make farre greater reckoning then to be adopted into the family of the Fabians or the Marcelli; you shall also heare by him, that since your departure from hence, you have beene (I may say) solemnly invocated, and most honorable commemoration hath beene made of you in all our

innocent disorderly Wakes. Our Curate beleeves verily that your presence hath brought a blessing to the fruits of our Parish, and wee looke for better Harvests then our neighbours, who had not the happinesse thereof as we had. There is therefore just cause that every weeke we make a feast upon the day of your comming to Balzac, Et ut tibi tanquam futuro in posterum loci Genio non uno poculo libetur. If this kinde of acknowledgement will content you, I shall perfectly acquit my selfe of performing my duty, having learned in Lorraine, and the Low Countries the meanes of testifying that I am,
                     
                        Sir,

                     Another to him. LETTER XXVII.
                     SIR, though I know the good deserts of—are not unknowne unto you, and that you neede no forreigne commendation to increase your respects towards him, yet I cannot hold from doing a thing superfluous; and assure you by these few lines that it will be no blemish to your judgement to let him have your testimony of his pietie. Ever since the time

he renounced his errour, hee hath continued firme and stedfast in the doctrine you taught him: of an erronious Christian you made him an Orthodox, and your hand is too happy to plant any thing that doth not prosper. He is therefore your workemanship in Christ Iesus, and otherwise so perfect a friend of mine that I know not, if in the order of my affections, I ought not to set him in equall ranke with my owne brother. This at least I know, that the least of his businesses is the greatest of mine, and I will not onely part your favour betweene him and me, but will become your debtour for the whole my selfe alone. I am now polishing those writings which I had condemned, but that you asked their pardon; and since it is your will they should not perish, I revoke my sentence, and I am resolved your selfe shall be the other person of my Dialogue; after the example of that Roman you love so well, whose bookes of Philosophie are commonly his conferences with Brutus, or other Sages, the true and naturall judges of such matters; yet Sir it is impossible for me to dissemble any longer a griefe I have at my heart, and to end my Letter without letting you see a little cut you have given me there; you made me a promise to come backe by Balzac, and now you have taken another way: Thus the wise men of the East dealt with Herod; yet I am neither tyrant nor enemy to the Sonne of God. This kind of proceeding is farre unlike the Belgicke sinceritie, and it is not fit for

Saints to mocke poore sinners. But how unkindly soever you deale with me, I can never turne Apostata, and should you proove more cruell, I should yet never be,

                     To———LETTER. XXVIII.
                     SIR, since you have taken pleasure in obliging me, I will not have you have the greefe to loose your obligation, nor that my incompetent acknowledgment should make you have the lesse stomacke for doing good. I know your goodnesse is cleare and free from all forreigne respects, and hath no motive but it selfe; it is not at any mans prayers that the Sunne, riseth neither doth he shine the more for any mans thankes; your courtesies are of like condition: Your favours have not beene procured by my making suite; and as of my part nothing hath gone before the kindnesses I have received, so on your part I assure my selfe you expect not that any thing should follow them; yet something must bee done for examples sake, and not to give this colour for shewing little courtesie to such as complaine

that men are ungratefull. The place where you are is full of such people; all commerces are but Amusements, and to make men beleeve the whole world is given to deceive; and it is a great merit in you that you can follow so forlorne and solitary a thing as truth is; in a Country where Divines maintaine her but weakely, and where shee dares scarce bee seene in a Pulpit, doth it not shew an extraordinary courage to take upon him to distribute her amongst the pretenders, and that in open Theater? It is no meane hardinesse to be good at the Court, to condemne false Maximes where they have made a Sect, and where they have gotten the force of Lawes. I have beene assured you make profession of this difficult vertue, and that in the greatest heate of calumnie; and the coldest assistance that ever a poore innocent had, you have beene passionately affected in my behalfe, being altogether unknowne unto you, but by the onely reputation of my ill fortune, and even at this present you are taking care of some affaires of mine which I in a manner had abandoned, and upon the report you heard of my negligence you make mee offer of your paines and industrie. The onely using your name were enough for all this, I might well spare my owne unprofitable indeavours, where my negligence being favoured by you shall without all doubt be crowned. You have heard speake of that Grecian whom the love of Philosoph
                           •…
                        e made to forget the tilling of his ground; and of

whom Aristotle said that hee was wise, but not prudent. Hee found a friend that supplied the defect of his owne ill husbandry, and repaired the ruines of his house. If my estate was like his, I should expect from you the like favour; but I aske not so much at this time. All that I desire now,—hath promised me a dozen times over; and I see no reason to distrust an Oracle. Hee is neither inspired by any false Deitie, nor hath made mee any doubtfull answer; so that resting my selfe upon this foundation, there seemes to have beene a kinde of Religion in my negligence: and I am not altogether in so much blame, as—would make you thinke mee. Hee is, I deny not, an Authour worthy to be credited; and his testimony ought to be received; but yet hee hath not the gift of not erring, and never beleeve him more, then when hee assures you that I am.
                     
                        Sir,  
                        Your, &amp;c.
                        
                           From Balzac 9. of Feb. 1630.
                        
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     To Mounsieur du Pleix, the Kings Historiographer. LETTER. XXIX.
                     SIR, since the time that persecution hath broken out into flames against mee, I never received more comfortable assistance then from your selfe, and I account your strength so great, that I cannot doubt of the goodnesse of a cause which you approve. You were bound by no Obligation to declare your selfe in my behalfe, and you might have continued Neutrall with decencie enough, but the noblenesse of your minde hath passed over these petty rules of vulgar Prudence; and you could not endure to see an honest man oppressed, without taking him into your protection. This is to shew mee too much favour in a Kingdome where Justice is no better than Mercenary, and where paiment comes not, but after long solliciting. I know well that the soundest part is of my side; and that my state is not ill amongst the wise; but on the other side, there are so many opposites on the By, make warre upon mee; that I am ready to leave my selfe to the mercy of the multitude, and to be perswaded by the number of my enemies, that I am in the wrong. It is therefore no small Obligation I am bound to you in, that you have preserved the libertie

of your judgement amidst the altercations and factions of passionate men, and have taken the paines to cleare a truth, which is to mee of great advantage, and was to you of small importance. I doe not desire that men should count me learned; this qualitie hath often troubled the peace of the Church; and they are not the ignorant that make Schismes and Heresies. And lesse I pretend to the art of well speaking; many bad Citizens have used this as an instrument to ruine their country, and a dumbe Wisedome is much more worth than an ill minded eloquence. That which I desire, and which would trouble me much to have taken from me is honesty; of which onely I make profession, and without which wee are never able to attaine salvation, where with all the Greeke and Latine of our Books we may incurre perdition. Mounsieur Gyrard, a man you dare trust, and one that hath never borne false witnesse, will answer for me concerning this last point. Hee hath seene my soule to the very bottome, and can assure you without deceiving you, that I am no lover of vice; and if you desire assurance that I am an extreme lover of vertue, hee will enter into bond for me that I am,
                     
                        Sir,  
                        Your, &amp;c.
                        
                           At Balzac 12. Aug. 1630.
                        
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     To Mounsieur Maynard. LETTER. XXX.
                     SIR, that sorrow is happie which hath you for a comforter. I finde more contentment in your compassionating me, then I finde affliction in others persecuting mee: and I am farre from wishing ill to an age, to which I am beholding for so excellent a friend. In this respect I easily pardon it, the wrong you say, it hath done me; and should be more unjust than it selfe is; if being beholding to it for a treasure; I should thinke much to partake of its iron and rust. It is not now onely that opinion governes the world; there hath beene disputing against Reason in all ages. Contentions and Heresies have ever beene, and the truth it selfe was not beleeved, when it came into the world in person and would have spoken. I seeke not the favour of the multitude, it is seldome gotten by honest and lawfull meanes; and in that Enchanters have advantage over Prophets. I seeke the testimonie of few; I number not voyces but weigh them: and to shew what I am, one honest man is Theater enough. Therefore never trouble your selfe that things have befallen me as I made account they would, and never aske for reason of the vulgar who have it not. Ignorance can never be just, nor goe right in the darke: Alarums

are given, and surprizes are made by the favour of night: this is the time of murthers and robberies, shee the mother of dreames and phantasmes. Your selfe have had your part in this experience as well as others. And at this very time I am talking with you, it may be you are accused by some for being a miscreant, for not beleeving that Saint Gregory made prayers to God for Trajans soule; or that Saint Paul was ever a bosome friend of Seneca. It may be you are called Haguenot for doubting the infallibilitie of Philarchus, and denying some of his miracles. It may be you are charged with seeking in vaine to perswade a Master of Art, that Aristotle had as much learning as Ramus; and that Ciceroes stile is as good as that of Lipsius. What shall I say more? It may be your deare and well beloved Martiall puts you to more paines to defend him than to imitate him: some Scholler of Muret maintaine boldly against you, that hee is a beastly Buffon; and perhaps the contrary will not be beleeved upon your bare word.
                     
                        Forsitan &amp; stupidas bona carmīna perdis ad aures.
                     
                     It is fit to laugh at such disorder, and not to grow in choler; and if you will make a Satyre of it, that it be of the Charocter of Horace, and not of Iuvenal. I cannot abide victories that are cruell; I aske mercy for my enemies, and love that my revenges should be imperfit, and that your Penne should not be bloody, as indeede it could not be, but of a base obscure

                     To Mounsieur Descourades. LETTER XXXI.
                     SIR, my deare cousin, if I could with any honesty leave the businesse I have in Angoumois:—should not goe into Languedoc without me; and I would make this journey of purpose onely to have the happinesse to embrace you; you would know mee presently by the old yellownesse of my face; and thereupon the force of blood would draw along with it a little tendernesse, and I doe not beleeve but you would make a difference betweene your owne and strangers. The effects of Grace destroy not the affections of Nature; they onely take away that which is impure and earthly; and I assure my selfe you doe not love me lesse than you did, but that you love me in a better fashion. I am told that the kinde of life you have chosen is not austere, but onely to your selfe, and that your thornes pricke no body else; in truth, a devotion that

pleaseth me exceedingly, and I could never away with this studied sadnesse, which disguiseth the hatred it beares to men, under pretence of the love of God. I am right glad you have taken the other way, because wee may now come safely to you, and never be afraid your vertue should scratch us. Christian Philosophie hath nothing in common with the Cynicke. This disguiseth, and that reformeth; one composeth the countenance, the other regulates the spirit; and indeede without an exact managing the superiour part: all the paine that is taken about the inferiour is to no purpose without that, Mortification is not so good as Carnalitie; and if you doe nothing but change your cloath of gold for a russet coate; and your cutworke band for a demy collar, you shall no doubt be a loser by the change. But the case is not so; you have left cares and trouble, for calmenesse and quiet; and you possesse a happinesse which Kings can neither keepe with thēselves, nor suffer amongst their neighbours; I speake of Peace, which in vaine is expected from their Alliances and from their Leagues, being not to be obtained but onely of God, and who gives it not but to his friends. You are a happy man to be of that number, and you may beleeve mee that I am not troubled about it, seeing there is good hope I may have a benefit by it my selfe, and that your prayers may draw mee after you, I doubt not but they are of great power and efficacie, and doubt as little that I am my selfe of the number of those you hold

deare unto you, but as one that hath more neede than any other, I conjure you to double them unto me, who am in heart and soule,
                     
                        Sir my deare Cosin, 
                        Your, &amp;c.

                     To Mounsieur D' Andilly, Counsellor of the King in his Counsels. LETTER XXXII.
                     SIR, I perceive that Mounsieur the great Master is a great extender of Expositions, and hath tied you to explaine your selfe in a matter whereof I never doubted. Herein hee hath exceeded his Commission, and done more than hee had in charge to doe. I seeke no new assurance of your friendship; this were to shew a distrust in the old, whereas the foundation already laidis such that makes me forbeare even ordinary duties, for feare I should make shew to neede them, and as if I would hold by any other strength then your owne inclination. Care and diligence, and assiduitie are not alwayes the true markes of sincere affections, which I speake in your behalfe as my owne:

Truth walkes now a dayes with a lesse traine, men use not to make open profession of it, but rather to confesse it as a sinne: her enemies are strong and open, her adherents weake and secret: yet Sir, if she were in more disgrace, and were driven out of France by Proclamation: I should beleeve you would be her receiver, and to finde her out, I should goe directly to Pompone. I therefore never doubted of your love; God keepe me from so evill a thought, onely I marvelled that—knew nothing of it, and that you let him take possession of his government, without recommending unto him, your friends there. To satisfie my selfe in this point; I said in my minde, that certainely this proceeded from the great opinion you had of his justice; and that conceiving there would not be with him any place for Grace or Favour; you would not doe me a superfluous office. This is the interpretation I made of an omission, which in appearance seemed to accuse you; and this is the conjecture I made of your silence, before I came to know the cause. Now I see I was in the wrong, to imagine you had such subtill considerations; or that you were restrained by such a cowardly wisedome which dares not assure the good to be good, least such assuring should corrupt it. For my part I renounce a prudence that is so dastardly and scrupulous, that feares to venture a word for a vertuous friend, because this friend is a man, and may perhappes lose his vertue. You doe much better than so, and Pam glad to find you

not so jealous of the glory of your judgement, but that you can be contented to be slighted and scorned, when it is for the benefit of a friend you love: let us leave fleame and coldnesse to old Senatours; and never make question whether wee ought to call them infirmities of age, or fruits of reason: These are good qualities for enabling men to judge of criminall causes, but are nothing worth for making men fit to live in societie: and he, of whom it was said, that all he desired, hee desired extremely, seemes to mee a much honester man than those that desire so coldly; and are so indifferent in their desires. If you were not one of these violent reasonable men, and had not some of this good fire in your temper, I should not have your approbation so good cheape. That which now galls you would not at all touch you; and things which now descend to the bottome of your soule, would passe away lightly before your eyes. There came yesterday a man to see me, who is not so sensible of the pleasures of the minde, and tooke great pitty of me and my Papers: hee told me freely that of all knowledges which require study, he made reckoning of none but such onely as are necessary for life; and that he more valued the stile of the Chanc
                           •…
                        ry than that of Cicero; he more esteemed the penning of a Chancery Bill, than the best penned Oration that ever Cicero writ. I thought this at first a strange compliment, but thinking well of it, I thought it better to seeme to be of his opinion, then undertake to cure a man uncureable.

I therefore answered him, that the Patriarch Calarigstone so famous for the peace of Uervins, was in a manner of his minde, who being returned from his Embassage, and asked what rate and admirable things hee had seene at Paris; made mention of none but their Cookes shoppes; saying to every body, as it were with exclamation Ueramente quelle rostisseries sono Cosa stupenda; as much as to say that there are Barbarians elsewhere, then at Fez and Morocco. One halfe of the world doth not so much as excuse that which you praise: our merchandise is cried downe long since, and to bring it into credit againe and put it off, there had neede returne into the world, some new Augustus and Antoninus.—saith, that whilst he waites for the resurrection of these good Princes; hee is resolved to rest himselfe; and not to publish his Verses, till they shall be worth a Pistole a peece. I feare it will be long ere we shall see this Edition come forth; for my selfe who make no such reckoning of my Prose; I have no purpose to make merchandise of it; yet desire I not nither to tire my hands with writing continually to no profit. I meane to make hereafter no other use of my Penne, then to require my friends to let mee heare of their healths; and to assure you Sir, that I am no mans more,
                     
                        Than yours, &amp;c.

                     To Mounsieur Conrart. LETTER. XXXIII.
                     SIR, I had a great lon ging to see—and you have done me a speciall kindnesse to send it mee over. Yet I must tell you, that your sending it gets him a greater respect with me then his owne deserving, and if you appoint me not to make some reckoning of him, all that I shall doe for his owne sake, will bee but to beare with him. A man had neede be of a sanguine complexion, and in a merry veine before that should be mooved to laugh at his poore jests. Melancholicke men are too hard to be stird, that which goes to the Centre of other mens hearts stayes without doores in theirs, at least it toucheth but very weakely the outside; and oftentimes I am so sadly disposde and in so sullen an humour, that if a Ieaster be not excellent I cannot thinke him tollerable nor indure to heare him. It is certaine the Italians are excellent in the art of jeasting, and I could marke you out a passage in Boccace that would have made—and all his predecessours the Stoick Philosophers to forfeit their gravitie. But there are not two Boccaces, nor two Ariostoes, there are many that thinke themselves pleasant when they are indeede ridiculous; I would our good—would leave his wrangling about controversies,

and fall to this kinde of writing, in which in my opinion hee would prove excellent. This would draw his Genius out of Petters, and give it the extent of all humane things to play in; onely he should spare the Church for her eldest sonnes sake, and forbeare the Pope for M. the Cardinalls sake, one of the Princes of his Court. These are respects you ought to have, untill your conversion furnish you with other more religious, and change this your honest civilitie into a true devotion. If we be not bound to speake of mens-honour reverently, yet we are bound to speak seriously, and even at this day we call Lucian an Atheist, for scoffing at those Gods who we know were false. For the rest Sir, I pray take heede you shew not my Letter to—, he would give me a terrible checke in behalfe of—, hee would not indure I should speake so insolently of an Author approved by the Academie, De gli insensati de Perouse, and indeede I had not spoken as I did, but that I dare trust your silence, and know, that to discover a secret to you is to hide it. Make much of this rare vertue and never leave, and be pleased to beleeve me that I am
                     
                        Sir,

                        At Balzac.

                     To the same another. LETTER. XXXIIII.
                     SIR, I am going to a place where in speaking good of you I shall finde no contradiction, and where your vertue is so well knowne, that if I say nothing of it but what I know, I am sure I shall tell no newes. I bring along with me the last Letter you writ unto me, and meane to bee earnestly intreated by Mounsieur—before I yeeld to grant him a Coppy. As for Madam—shee should entertaine an enemy upon this passeport, and though shee were resolved to give me no audience, yet shee would never deny it to the reader of your writings. I know of what account you are in her heart, and how much I ought to feare least all the roome there be taken up before hand with your favour. Yet such opinion I have of her justice, that I willingly make her Arbitratour of our difference, and require her to tell whether she think I have done wrong to—in desiring him to give over his going to Law, and to passe the rest of his dayes in more quiet and sweet imployments. The art of jeasting, whereof I speake is no enemy to the art of morality whereof you speake, rather it is the most subtle and most antient way of retailing it; And that which would fright men, being used in the naturall

forme, delights and winnes them sometimes, being used under a more pleasing maske. A wisedome that is dry, and altogether raw, is it for the heart? it must have a little seasoning, such a kind of sawce as Socrates was wont to make it; that Socrates I say whom all the Families of Philosophers account their Founder, and acknowledge for their Patriarch. The story sayes he never used to speake in earnest, and the age hee lived in called him the feoffer. In Platoes Booke you shall finde little else of him but jeasting; with disorderly persons you shall see him counterfet a Lover, and a Drunkard, thereby to claw them whom he would take. He shunnes the stile of the Dogmatists, or to speake definitively of things, as thinking it an instrument of Tyranny, and a yoake that oppresseth our libertie. In short he handles serious matters so little seriously that hee seemes to thinke the shortest way to perswade was to please; and that vertue had neede of delight, to make way for her into the soule. Since his time there have come men who contented not themselves with laughing, but make profession of nothing else, and have made it their recreation to play upon all the actions of humane life. Others have disguised themselves into Courtiers and Poets, and left their Dilemmaes and their Syllogismes to turne jcasters, and to get audience in privie Chambers. Wee see then the world had not alwayes beene sad before Ariosto and Bernia came into it, they were not the men that

brought it first to be merry; Ieasting is no new invention, it was the first trade that wise men used; who thereby made themselves sociable amongst the people. Theophrastus who succeeded Aristotle thought it no disparagemen
                           •…
                         to Philosophie, nor that there was in it any uncomlinesse unfit for his schoole Lycaeum, he is excellent at descriptions, and counterfeitings, and his Characters are as so many Commedies, but that they bee not divided into Acts and Senes, and that they represent but onely one person. Seneca, as solemne and of as sullen humour as he was otherwise, yet once in his life would needs bee merry, and hath left us that admirable Apotheosis of Claudius, which if it were lost, I would with all my heart give one of his bookes de Beneficiis to recover againe; and a much greater ransome if it were possible to get it entire. No doubt but you have heard speake of the Caesars, of the Emperour Iulian; that is to say, of the sports of a severe man, and of the mirth of a melancholicke man, and from whence thinke you had the Menippaean Satyrs their names? Things so much esteemed of by antiquity, and under which title the learned Varro comprised all wisedome divine and humane; even from Menippus the Philosopher, who was of a Sect so austere, and so great an enemie to vice, that Iustus lipsius doubts not to set it in comparison with the most strict and reformed order of the Church. I am much deceived but Madam—will not bee found so scrupulous as you, and not

give her voyce in favour of an opinion authorised by so great examples. And indeede Sir, why should you not like that our friend should reserve some mirth and some pleasure for his old age? and having declaimed and disputed abroad all day, should come at night to have some merry talke in his owne lodging; why should you thinke it amisse, that after so many warres and cumbats I should counsaile him to refresh himselfe with a more easie and lesse violent kinde of writing; and to afford us such wares as may bee received as well at Rome as at Geneva? These thirty yeares he hath bin a Fencer upon Paper, &amp; hath furnished all Europe with such spectacles; why should hee not now give over a quarrell that he is never able to compose? He may in my opinion honestly say, it is enough, and content himselfe to have outlived his old adversaries, without staying to looke for new. Having had to doe with Mounsieur Coeffeteau, and with Cardinall Perron; it would bee a shame for him to meddle now with a dizzy headed father, or with the Anticke of Roan; and a poore ambition it would be in my judgement to erect Trophies of two such broken Bables; it were better hee left individualls and fell to judge of species in generall, and that he would consider other mens follies without partaking of them. It were better to discredit vice by scorne, then to give it reputation by invectives, and to laugh with successe, then to put himselfe in Choler without profit. Though there be many

sorts of disciplining men, and correcting their manners; yet I for my part am for this sort, and finde nothing so excellent as a medicine that pleases. Many men feare more the bitternesse of the potion that is given them, then the annoyance of the infirmitie that offends them; we would faine goe to health by a way of pleasure, and he should bee a much abler man that could purge with Raspices, then he that should do it with Rhubarbe. Our Gentleman by—his leave is none of these; for commonly hee neither instructs nor delights, he neither heales nor flatters their passions that reade him; hee hath neither inward treasure nor outward pompe; and yet I can tell you, as beggarly and wretched as hee is, hee hath beene robbed and ransacked in France. Hee could not save himselfe from our Theeves; and you may see some of his spoiles which I present you here.
                     
                        My fidling Doctor in his visage various,

                        Which he with eyes and fingers did not fish;
                        And so forth.
                     
                     You see wee live in a Country where even Beggars and Rogues cannot passe in safetie; though they have nothing to lose, yet they lose for all that, and men pull the hayres

great which leaves not place for injuries. Cottages are pillaged as well as Pallaces; and though coverousnesse looke more after great gaines, yet it scornes not small. But all this while you must remember that my discourse is allegoricall, and that I speake of Poets and not of Treasures. I am

                     SIR, though I know your life is full of businesse, and that it hath neither festivall, nor day of rest; yet I am so vaine as to fancy to my selfe that I shall be able to suspend this your continuall action, and that the recreation I send you shall finde some place amidst your affaires: you are not one to be wrought upon, you know the true value of things, and soe in Arts those secrets which none but Artists themselves see. There is no thinking therefore to deceive you by a shew of good, and by false flashes of reputation; no way to gaine estimation with you, but by lawfull wayes, and rather by seeking commendation from ones selfe, then testimony from others. This is the cause

that I come alwayes directly to your selfe, and never seeke to get a favour by canvasing and suite, which is not to be gotten but by merit. If my Booke be good that will be a sollicitour with you in my behalfe; and if it make you passe some houres with any contentment, you will let me understand it when you have read it. Howsoever I hope you will grant, that the Pension which the King gives me is no excesse that needs reformation; and feare not to bee accused of ill husbandry, if you please to pay me that which is my due. There have beene heretofore in the place that you are now in certaine wilde unlettered persons, who yet made show of valuing humane learnings, and to respect those graces in others which were wanting in themselves; forcing their humour and sweetning their countenances to winne the love of learned men; and eithér out of opinion or out of vanitie have revered that which you ought to love out of knowledge, and for the interrest you have in it, I say for the interest, because besides the vertues of peace, having in you the vertues of warre; it concernes you not to leave your good atchievements to adventure, but to cast your eyes upon such as are able to give your merits a testimony that may be lasting; I dare not say that I my selfe am one of that number, but thus much I can assure you most truly that I am,

                     SIR, I have received your Letter of the 27. of the last month; but it makes mention of a former which never came to my hands: and it must needes be that Fortune hath robbed me of it, for feare I should be too happie, and should have two pleasures in Sequence. This is an accident which I reckon amongst my misfortunes; and I cannot sufficiently complaine of this Violatour of the law of Nations, who hath beene so cruell as to breake our Commerce, the very first day of our entring into it; and to make mee poore without making himselfe rich. I am more troubled for this losse, than for all that shall be said or written against mee: Slander hath a goodly catch of it to be at warre with mee, it shall never make me yeeld; it is an evill: is it not a glory for a private man to be handled in such manner, as Princes and their Officers are? And is it not a marke of greatnesse to be hated of those one doth not know? I never sought after the applause of—, which cannot chuse but have corrupt affections in such sort, that when they praise me, I should aske what fault I had

done? Though their number were greater than you make it, this would be no great novelty to me, who know that truth goes seldome in the throng; and hath in all times beene the Possession but of a few. Even at this day, for one Christian there are sixe Mahometans; and there was a time, when Ingemuit orbis, &amp; se Arrianum esse miratus est. If God suffer men to be mistaken in matters of so great importance, where their salvation is at stake; why should I expect hee should take care to illuminate them in my cause which no way concernes them; and to preserve them from an errour which can doe them no hurt? Whether I be learned or ignorant; whether my eloquence be true or false, whether my Pearles be Orientall, or but of Venice: what is all this to the Commonwealth? There is no cause the publicke should trouble it selfe about so light a matter; and the fortunes of France depend not upon it. Let the Kings subjects beleeve what they list; let them enjoy the libertie of conscience which the Kings Edicts allow them. A man must be very tender that can be wounded with words; and hee must be in a very apt disposition to d

The good opinion of honest mindes, is to me a soveraigne remedy against all the evills of this nature. I oppose a little choise number, against a tumultuary multitude, and count my selfe strong enough, having you on my side;

and knowing you to be as vigorous a friend of mine, as I am

                     SIR, I am unfortunate, but I am not faulty. I was assured you had written to me, but I received not your letters. You have beene my defendour; and I have beene a long time without knowing to whom I was bound for defending me: whether it were a man or an Angell that was come to my succour. These are honest injuries, and generous supererogations. This is to deceive in charitie, and to his advantage that is deceived. This is to bring againe that good time, wherein Knights unknowne to become free-men, that were oppressed without telling their names; or so much as lifting up the Beavers of their Helmets. You have done in a manner the like; you have hidden your selfe under a borrowed shape; thereby to take away from a good action, all apparence of vaineglory; and to let them that are interessed, see, that you are vertuous without looking for reward. For my selfe, I doe not thinke I am bound to follow the intention

of this scrupulous vertue. If you have a will to shun noise, and the voice of the people; yet you cannot refuse the acknowledgement of an honest man: nor let me from paying what I owe you. Because you are modest, I must not therefore be ungrateful, as I am not by my good will, I assure you. You possesse my heart, as absolutely, as you have justly purchased it; I am yours by all the sorts of right, not forgetting that of the warres. I will even beleeve that my enemie hath gotten a full victory, to the end I may more justly call you my Redeemer; and that you may have the crowne that was due to him had saved a citizen. Mounsieur Borstill, whose wisedome and integritie you know, will answer for the truth of my words: and for my selfe, I shall neede none to answer, being ready to testifie by my actions; that there is not in the world, a man more than my selfe,
                     
                        Sir,

                     To Mounsieur the Master Advocate in the Parliament. LETTER. XXXVIII.
                     SIR, I have too great a care of your reputation, to seeke to have you be found a liar. It shall not lie upon mee, that you be not a man of your word; and that your friend is not contented; and seeing it is expected to see this present day what I have written of his companie; It is not fit to put off till to morrow the effect of your promise: or that hee should languish in the expectation of so small a thing. It is true my Booke is not here, and my memory is not now so faithfull, that I dare trust it to deliver that I gave it to keepe: yet I conceive after I have stined it up in your name, which is so deare unto me, I shall finde enough to satisfie your desire, and receive from it this good office. I seeme therefore to remember I said, that after so many yeares, that the Christian Muses have beene in France: hee is the onely man hath entertained them with honour; and hath built a Pallace for this soveraigne science to which all other are subject and inferiour. He hath drawne her out of an obscure and close mansion, where like the poore Socrates she discoursed in prison of the supreme felicity, to place her in a seate worthy of her, and to set

up a stately and sumptuous race for the exercise of her children. From hence wee may apprehend the dignitie and merit of our Sorbone: for which a man the fullest of businesse in all the world, hath yet had so particular a care amidst the most violent agitation of his thoughts, that the designe of the house hee crects for her, hath found place in his breast, amidst the Forts and Rampires of Rochell. If our predecessors the Gaules next to their gods, gave the second place of honour to their Druides, who shewed them but a dimme and confused light of the state of our soules after this life; what respect then, what reverence can be too great for those venerable Fathers, who teach us by a knowledge most infallible; what the chiefe and supreme good is; who discover to us in certainty, the things that are above the heavens, who make us true relation of that admirable commonwealth of happie citizens that live without bodies, and are immateriall; and who deliver to us the wounders of the intellectuall world, more pertinently and more directly, than wee relate to blinde men the ornaments of this visible world. With them are had the springs of pure D
                           •…
                        ctrine; where with others, but onely Brookes and Streames; with them are had resolutions of all doubts, remedies for all poysons: with them Time wrongs not antiquitie; nor doth old age either neede painting, or feare tainting: with them this sixteenth age of the world, behold Christianity preserved and kept in its first

lustre. Seing the memory of the most part of the Romane Lords is perished together with their Baths, their Aqueducts, their Races, their Amphitheaters; whereof the very ruines are themselves ruined and lost; I find that M. the Cardinall understands more than ever they did, and goes a straighter way to eternity, travelling in a place where his travell can never perish &amp; leaving the care of his name to a company that of necessitie shall be immortall, and shall speake of his magnificence as long as there shall be speaking of Sinne and Grace, of good and evill Angells, of the paines and rewards of the life to come. I assure my selfe I have not spoken too much; and I thinke I could not have spoken lesse: it is lawfull for us to set a price upon our owne; and if an antient writer said, that more worthy men came forth of Isocrates Schoole; then out of the Trojan Horse: why may not we say as much of Albertus Magnus, and of Saint Thomas? Me thinks I know not how to speake to our countrimen, but of the Lycaeum and of the Academy: and it is now five and twenty yeares that I have beaten my braines about the Gymnosophists the Brachmanes and the Rabbins: but when all is done, wee should remember that wee are Christians; and that we have Philosophers that are nearer to us, and ought to be dearer to us then all they. I am glad occasion hath beene offered me to put my opinion hereof in writing; and thereupon to let you know I make no mysterie of my writings; and specially with you, to

whom I have opened my very heart; and whose I am wholly without reservation,

                  LETTERS OF Mounsieur de BALZAC. LIB. II.
                  
                     To my Lord the Earle of Exeter. LETTER. I.
                     
                        SIR, if you had wholly misliked my Booke, I had wholly defaced it: but seeing some parts of it, seemed to you not unsound, I have thought it sufficient to cut off the corrupt part, that you might be drawne to endure the rest. I now therefore send you an Edition of it reformed, done expresly for you, and which I have taken care to cleanse from the staines, that in the two former were distastefull to you. It is not my purpose to stand disputing in an Argument, where I am willing to be confuted: nor to defend that which is condemned by you, where the question is to give you satisfaction by my rigour; I presently grow insensible of the tendernesse of a Father: and shall he uncompassionate

to my dearest issues, as often as your pleasure shall be that they should perish. My Writings are to mee no better than Monsters when they offend your eyes, and to seeme vile to you, is to be vile indeede; and therefore in stead of asking there pardon, I have beene my selfe the hastner of their punishment. There cannot a greater test
                           •…
                        ony be given of a mans integritie, then when the Delinquent concurres in opinion with the judge; and is the Executioner, where he is the condemner. All this have I already done; and although in that unhappy passage which gave you distaste: I had not somuch a meaning to bite as to laugh; yet I confesse I tooke my marke amisse for laughing justly. Oftentimes one countenance for another changeth the face of the most innocent action of the world: and though I failed onely in ill explaning my selfe; yet it was fault enough, seeing thereby I gave you cause to doubt of my intention. Truly, my Lord, it was never my meaning so much as to touch the resplendent glory of your divine Princesse. I know well enough, it was fitter to consider her by the magnanimity of her spirit; whereof your whole posteritie shall taste the fruits, then by the light flower of bodily beauty; which not onely falls away by death; but runs away at the very first approaches of age. I should come out of another world, if I were ignorant of the Encomiums shee hath in this kinde received by all peoples voyces. She hath I know beene stiled the Starre of the North:

the goddesse of the sea; the true Thetis. I have read in a Letter, which Henry the great writ unto her in the hight of all his troubles; and in the violence of the league: these words, I will Madam be your Captaine Genorall. Even hee that excommunicated her, spake of her with honour: and hee was, as you know, an understanding Prince, and admirable in the Art of Ruling. Hee tooke a pleasure to be discoursing of her with Embassadours resident at his Court; and would sometimes say merily, that if hee had beene her husband, certainely Greatnesse and Authority would have beene the issues of so renowned a marriage. But though she had not ascended to this high degree of reputation, and though shee should be devested of all these glorious markes of honour; yet there are two considerations; lesse specious indeede in the eyes of the world: but more sensible to my spirit, that would binde mee strongly to reverence her memory: One Sir, that she hath not scorned our Muses; the other, that shee hath loved your house. I was taught by Cambden, the knowledge shee had in all kindes of learning; so farre, as that she had happily Translated out of Greeke into Latine some of Sophocles Tragedies; and some of Isecrates Orations. Of the same Authour also, I have learned the great part your Ancestours bare in her confidence and secrets; and your name is so often used in the history of her life, that where soever Elizabeth is mentioned, there Cicile for the most part is never left out. So that she being

by good right your domesticall Deitie, and the reverence you beare her, your most antient inclination; it is farre from me to violate that which you adore, or to hate that which you so dearely love; seeing I am,
                     
                        Sir,

                     To my Lord the Archbishop of Thoulouse. LETTER. II.
                     SIR, I have never beene sociable since your departure from hence; no man can make me speake; and I doe not yet breake my sullen silence, but onely to tell you, I am the saddest Hermite that ever was. Those whom Saint Hierome reports to have beene companions of Serpents and Scorpions, were never of so untoward an humour as I, for I have their vexation, and I have not their consolation. Nothing pleaseth mee in the place where I am; you have carried away with you all its worth and goodnesse, and it is not the hardnesse of the season, it is your absence that obscures the beauties of my solitude. It was not well done

Sir to accustome mee to a pleasure which you meant so suddenly to take away from me, or to say better, to shew mee onely my good fortune thereby to procure me envie, and then goe presently and make others happy with enjoying it; and yet I know well, that such petty considerations owe obedience to a greater, and that particular interests ought alwayes to give place to publicke. Mine therefore is not so deare unto me, but that I willingly forget it upon such occasions, and easily forgoe my owne conceits, to enter upon the purpose of divine providence. The peace wee hope for shall perhaps by your voyage be advanced, and you are now perhaps sent from heaven to goe whither you thought to have gone without commanding; If peradventure there be found some particular men that are too much heated, your Eusebius and your Theodoret will helpe to allay their heate, and if they be too stifly bent upon severitie, you will make them abate their rigour by the examples you bring them, of the moderation of their fathers; I have too good an opinion of so many worthy Prelates as are in your assemblies, to imagine they would ever agree to arme Princes, either against a penitent, or against an honest man, mistaken; and would not in the interests of their order content themselvs with imploying the Thunderbolts of the Vatican, but would doe their uttermost to call forth also those of the Arsenall; Whatsoever may be sayd in defence of such proceeding, it can never in my opinion

have so generall approbation, but that some honest spirits will bee scandalized by it. This would bee to bring excommunication into a poore account, to make it serve onely for an Essay, and for a preparative of punishment, and to make it the first plaster of a light wound, wch ought to be the last remedy of the extremest evills. Such practise would be farre from the custome of the antient Christianitie, and of the age of Martyrs; and I cannot conceive, neither can it be, that Christian Pastors should become Butchers of their Flocke; and that the Church which hither to hath beene in persecution, should now it selfe begin to persecure. This Church Sir, as your selfe and my masters your brethren teach us, is not a cruell Stepdame, proud and maligning her spouses children; but it is a naturall mother, compassioning her owne, and desirous to adopt even Proselytes and strangers: You tell us that shee runnes after the greatest sinners, and goes as a guide before all the world, which is farre from saying that it stands not with her dignitie to be an instrument of their conversion, nor so much as once to take care what becomes of them; It is you who assure us that shee is content to lose her richest vessels, so as thereby shee may recover the sacriledge of her robbers; it is from you wee learne that shee is farre from animating justice to ruine innocents, who gives sanctuary of pardon to Delinquents. I have heard speake of the sweet nature and signing of the Dove; but never of her cruelty

nor of her roaring; and to give her clawes and teach her to love blood, would be no lesse then to make her a Monster; this would bee Sir to make love it selfe turne wilde, and metamorphise it into hate. This would bee to imitate the antient Pagans, who attributed to their gods all the passions and infirmities of men; no man I hope shall be able to lay such prophanation to our charge, wee will be no corrupters of the most excellent puritie, no handlers of holy things with polluted hands, no stretchers of our defects to the highest point of perfection: They which doe so, in what part of the world soever they be, are Anathemaes in your Bookes, accursed in your Sermons, condemned by the rules of your doctrine, and by the examples of your life. These false Saints doe not serve Christ, but serve themselves of Christ; they sollicite their owne affaires in his name, and recommend it as his cause when it is their owne suite. Periwasion that they doe well makes them more hardy in doing ill; they call their choller zeale, and when they kill, they thinke they sacrifice. Thankes be to God no part in the whole body of our Clergie is so unsound; it is returned to its oyle, and to its balme, in whose place the civill warres had substituted deadly Aconite and bitter Wormewood. The League is dead, and Spaine heartsicke, our Oracles are no longer inspired by forreigne Deities, the spirit of love and charity animates all our Congregations; and no doubt he that ought to be the mouth of the

assembly, will consider that Bishops are Ministers of mercy, and not of justice; and that to them our Lord said, I leave peace with you, but said not I leave vengeance with you; the wisedome of M. the Cardinall will strip off all the thorny prickles of passions, and sweeten all the bitternesse of figures, before they arrive to come neare the King. This divine spirit is farre surmounting all orations, all deliberations, and all humane affaires, and in this he will easily finde a temper both to preserve the honour of the Church, and yet not oppresse the humilitie of him that submits, both to give full satisfaction to the first order, and yet not withdraw regard from the merit of the second; both to make us see heads bowed and knees bended before the Altars; and yet no houses demolished, nor governments destroyed, whereof the Altars should receive no benefit. I am in hope you will doe me the favour to informe me of the occurrents of the whole history, whereof I doubt not, but you are your selfe one of the principall parties, and I expect by your letters a true relation of all the newes that runnes about. In the meane time Sir, I trust you will not take it ill that I speake unto you of this great affaire, as a man that sees it a farre off; and whom you appoint sometimes to deliver his advise upon matters, of which he hath but small understanding. At your returne we will renue the Commerce we have discontinued, and since you will have it so, I will once againe play the Oratour, and the

Politician before you; yet I feare me much, you will scarce bee suffered to keepe your promise with me; I see you are more borne to action then to rest, and that our rurall pleasures are not worthy so much as to amuse so great a spirit as yours is, I therefore wish you such as are worthy of you; that is, the solidest and the perfectest, and such as glorious Atchievements and glorious actions leave behind them; and I love not my selfe so much that I am not much more,
                     
                        Sir,  
                        Your, &amp;c.

                     To Mounsieur Arnaut, Abbot of St. Nicholas. LETTER III.
                     SIR, the small service you desired of me is not worth considering, but onely for the great thankes I have received for it; I had altogether forgot it when I received your Letter, which makes mee yet forget it more in making m

                        o remember it. You have words that change things, and in your Language a

                        n immortall obligation.

If you make so great account of good desires, I merveile what price you set upon good deeds; and if you thus bestow your compliments without necessitie, I feare you, will want them when you have neede; you should goe more reserveldy to worke, and retaine more providence for the future. A man may be a good husband, and yet not bee covetous; and seeing limits and bounds are fit in all cases, they cannot bee unfit in the case of courtesie: Thinke not therefore Sir, that herein you have done an act of acknowledgement, you have gone farre beyond the bounds of this vertue. If there be a vice opposite to ungratefulnes, your too great officiousnesse hath made you fall into it, and by the excesse you have avoided the defect. The interests of M. the Cardinall Bentivoglio have no neede of recommending, but amongst people that are not yet Civilized; that which concernes his honour, is no matter of indifferencie to them that know his vertue, and they that know it not are no better then Barbarians. If to doe him service I had not run whither you prayed me to goe, and if I had not required an absolute suppression of that discourse, whereof you required onely but a sweetning; I had performed my duty but very weakely, and had deserved blame in that for which you praise me. Though his name were not resplendent in history, nor his dignitie in the Church, yet he should have I
                           •…
                        stre enough in his very stile and writings, and though he were not a grandchild of Kings,

and a Senatour of the whole earth; yet I finde something in him more worth then all that: I consider him without his Purple, and devested of all externall ornaments; regarding onely those that are naturall to him; and which would make him most illustrious, though hee had but a blacke cap on his head, and most eminent, though he were but a private man. These are advantages hee hath over other men, and which hee communicates to this age of the world, goods that hee possesseth and I enjoy. For I vow unto you that in this sad place whither my owne humour hath miss-led me; and where there is no talke but of Suits and quarrells; I should not know in the world how to passe my time; if I had not brought his booke along with me. This hath beene the companion of my voyage, and is now the comforter of my Exile, and after I am dulled with a deale of troublesome discourse, and have my eares filled with idle chat, I goe and purifie my selfe in his delicate relations; and gather my spirits together, which the noyse and clatter had before dispersed. I never saw in so sober and chast a stile, so much fulnesse and delight; if nature herselfe would speake, shee could never make choyse of more proper termes then those he useth; and where proper termes faile, shee could never more discreetly borrow forreigne then he doth. The Character of his phrase is so noble, that by this onely, without any other signes I should easily know hee is come of a good house; and I see that fortune

which hath beene so great an enemy of his blood, and hath done so much hurt to his ancestors, hath not yet beene able to take from him the marke of their greatnesse, nor the manners and language of a Prince. At your departure from thence you gave me thankes for loving qualities that are so lovely, and that making profession of Letters, I am put in passion for him who preserves their honour, and who in his country is the Crowne and glory of our Muses; as often as there is question for his service I shall neede no second consideration to put mee in heate about it; I tell you plainely, I shall doe it no whit the more for any love of you, I intreate you to provide some occasion apart from all interests of his, where you may see the extraordinary account I make of your merits, and the desire I have to manifest unto you that I am,
                     
                        Sir,

                     To Mounsieur Ogier. LETTER IIII.
                     SIR, you could never have fallēn againe to your pen upon better termes then you have

done; and I have a conceite your silence hath not beene so much a neglect as a meditation. The Letter you pleased to write unto me is so full of infinite excellent things, that it seemes you have beene making provision three yeares together to make one feast, and that your sparing for so long a time had no other meaning but to bee magnificent for one day. The dispatch of the Constantinopolitan slave you sent me, and the newes of Koppenhagen you writ unto me are so inriched with ornaments of your making, that I see plainely whatsoever passeth thorough your hands receiveth an impression of excellencie, and that glorious atchievements have neede of you to be their historian. It is not strange unto me that M. your brother hath pleaded my cause, I am an eternall clyent of your family, and as it is my part to honour my benefactor, so it is yours to preserve your benefits: But verily I could never have thought this last action should have had the Court of Denmarke for a Theater, and the King and his daughters the Princesses for Iudges. You sent me word I had a famous decree passed on my side, and that the assailant was as much hissed at, as the defendant was applauded. God be praised that grants us justice amongst the Gothes, for injuries done us by the French; and that raiseth up in an end of the world a soveraigne defender of persecuted innocencie, such succour sometimes hee hath extraordinarily afforded when men abandon her; the Lyons have become humane, rather

then leave her without protection; &amp; in the most frightfull desarts there have beene found Nurses for children, whom the crueltie of their mothers had exposed. Let us therefore never beleeve that sweetnesse and humanitie are qualities of the earth or of the Ayre; they are neither proper goods of the easterlings, nor captive vertues of the Grecians. They are wandring and passant, all climates receive them in their turne, and it is not the Cimbricke Chersonesus any longer, it is Athens and Achaia that at this day are Barbarians. This divine princesse of whom your brother writes such wonders, hath no doubt contributed much to this change, and though there should shine no other Sunne upon the bankes of the Balticke Sea, this one were enough to make vertue bud forth in all hearts, and to make Arts and discipline to flourish in all parts. This is a second Pallas that shall have her Temples, and her suppliants shall be president of Letters and studies, as well as the former. Even that which you say of the defect of her birth, and of the obscuritie of her mother, might bee ground enough for a Poet to make an entire worke and to assure us that shee was borne and came out of her fathers head at least Sir if your relations bee true, shee is the lively Image of his spirit, the interpretour of his thoughts, the greatest strength of his estate, and who by her eyes and tongue reigneth and ruleth over all objects that either see or heare. Why should I dissemble or hide my contentment?

I must confesse I am proud in the highest degree for the praises shee hath given me. Never Prince passed the Rhine more happily then mine hath done, seeing so good fortune hath attended him there, and that there hee should be crowned by a hand which was able to give wounds to all others. What shall I say more? I scorne all the antient triumphes when I thinke upon this: I hope for no lustre, but for her splendour, I seeke for no glory, but in her recommendation; her onely voyce is instead of the suffrages of a whole Diet of all the north; and what reason they should not forever be banished the Empire who blame that wch she praiseth, or that would oppose the soveraignty of her excellent judgement? As for our common enemie, condemned by her; to keepe company with the Hobgoblins of Norway; since hee is no longer in the world. he is no longer in state to do her obeysance. If it be not that God will have that to bee the place of his purgatory which shee would have to be the place of banishment, and that this proud spirit is confind to live amongst the tempests &amp; other frenticke issues of the North, as Varro speakes of Satyres. You have read I suppose the Dialogues of Saint Gregorie; and therefore must needs know that all soules are not purged after one manner, but some passe thorough the fire, and others endure the Ice; and the extremitie of cold is no lesse an instrument of the divine justice, then extremitie of heate. But I purpose not to set a broach a question of divinitie,

for I should then beginne a new Letter; and it is now time I should finish this; but telling you first, that he which shall deliver it to you, hath in charge to present you a larger discourse; and to let you see, that there is both Greeke and Latine in our Village.

                     To Mounsieur Sirmond. LETTER V.
                     SIR, be not scandalized, nor take exception at my silence. The greatest part of the Letters I writ; are but the paiment of my old debts: and before I answer one, I cast up my reckoning three or foure times. I seldome stay upon matter of compliment, all I can doe, is but to defend my selfe untowardly; I thinke

my selfe sufficiently honest, if I be but indifferently uncivill; and because I am apt to doe courtesies voluntarily; I expect also voluntarily to receive them; of you Sir especially, who judge not friendshippe by the looke, and knowes that superstition is more ceremonious, then true pietie. The new favours I have received from your Muses are to mee as they ought to be, exceeding sensible: yet thinke not, that this makes me forget your former benefits: and that I carry not in minde, that it is you that gave me the first taste of good, and the principles of vertue; you doe but build upon the foundation you laid your selfe; and give estimation to your owne paines. Having beene my guide in a countrie which I know not; it is for your honour it should be beleeved, I have made some progresse there, that so it may apppeare your directions are good. Thus your Poeme hath in it a hidden art, which few understand; and I am but the colour of your designe. You enjoy your selfe all the glory you have done me; all the glory you have imparted to mee stayes still with your selfe; and you have found out a way how to praise your self, without speaking of your self: and how to be liberall without parting from any thing. If you come this Sommer to Paris, I will give you account of an infinite number of things that will not dislike you; and in revenge thereof, I require to heare from you some newes of our male content;
                     
                        
                           
Cui mos in trivijs humili tentare Veneno
                        Ardua &amp; impositos semper Cervice rebelli

                     I know not whether you will be able to bring the state into his favour; but this I know, it is no small worke for perswasion to effect, seeing hee is no lesse obstinate in his errours, then you strong in your Reasons. Whatsoever he say of the time; and of the carriage of things; the impunitie with which he triumphs, is a visible marke of the moderate goverment of this Kingdome; and in any country but this; his Head long before this time had paid for his tongue. But I heare he is of so vile an humour, that he is angry for his very liberty; and thinks it is done in scorne, that hee hath not all this while been put in the Bastyle. He valewes himselfe to be worthy of an informer; and of Commissioners, and thinkes hee hath merit enough to be punisht in state. Let us beare a little with his malady; he is otherwise not evill, nor of evill qualities: It is onely the temperature of his body that is faulty: and if Mounsieur Cytois can purge away his choller, hee shall procure to M. the Cardinall a faithfull servant. I expect hereupon an Epigramme of your making, and am with all my soule,

                     To Mounsieur Colombiers. LETTER. VI.
                     SIR, I finde by the Letter which Mounsieur de Mantin writ unto you, that you have done mee good offices with him; and that upon your word, hee takes mee for more than I am worthy. It is your part now to make that sure unto him which you have warranted, and to disguise mee with so much Art, that may make good your first deceit by a second. For to think that I shall be able to answer his expectation, and satisfie your promise: I know he expects too much; and know you have promised too much, that which hee speakes of me and of my writings, seemes rather to come from the passion of a lover, than from the integritie of a Judge; and I ought to take it, rather as a Present, then as a Recompence. I know besides, that the placē from whence hee writes hath alwayes beenē the habitation of courtesie; and that the sparke of the Court of Rome which hath rested there, since it parted from thence; hath left a light which gives an influence to the manners and spirits of the Country. Yet distinction must be made betweene the civilities of Avignon, which extend

to all sorts of strangers, &amp; the resentments of an able man, which respect nothing but reason, and a difference must be put betweene the honesty of a compliment, and the Religion of a testimony. Mounsieur Malherbe deceased, who never gave any mans merit, more than its due: and but coldly praised the most praise-worthy things; yet hath heretofore to me, in so high a degree extolled this man, of whom we speake; that I could not but thinke, it must needes be a very extraordinary Vertue that transported him so unwontedly, and a very pressing verity, that forced him to open himselfe so freely, I have since beene confirmed in my judgement of him by divers persons of good qualitie, and generally by the voyce of all our country: But yet there is in this more cause for me to feare, than hope: Wise men doe but only taste an errour; with which common people drinke themselves drunke: They do not plunge themselves in false opinions, they passe them lightly over; and I am afraid you will ere long receive another letter in retractation of this, he hath now written so much in my favour, if the worst come to the worst; and that there be no meanes for me, to keepe all the good you have gotten me; I yet may lawfully require to have a part left me; which Mounsieur your brother in Law cannot honestly deny me. I am unfit for the termes hee gives me; I willingly returne them backe to himselfe. Let him keepe his Admiring for Miracles; or at least for the great stupendious workes of Nature; I aspire

not, nor have any pretence to so high a degree of his account; but I thinke I have right to his friendshippe; and that both of you are my debters of some good will; seeing I honour you both exceedingly, and passionately am

                     To———LETTER VII.
                     SIR, I am not altogether prophane, yet am but a simple Catechumene neither: I adore your mysteries, though I comprehend them not; and dare not give my spirit that liberty which you give it. Is it fit to be a judge of a Science, of which it is yet but learning the Alphabet? It scarce knowes visible Objects, and runnes a hazard, when it considers but the exteriour face of Nature; as for that which is above, it climbes not to it, nor soares so high. My curiositie is not so ventrous: and concerning the condition of superiour things; I wholly referre my selfe to the Sorbone. Never thinke therefore that I will give my Censure of your Booke: I have not yet discovered the bottome; onely the barke, I must tell you seemes very precious; and I am ravished with

the sound and harmony of things, I understand not, this kinde of Writing would have astonished Philosophers whom it could not have perswaded: and if Saint Gregory Nazianzen had but shewed such a peece as this to Themistius, he could not chuse but have beene moved with it, and must needes have admired the probabilitie of Christianity; though he had not knowne the secret. These are not words that one reades, and are painted upon paper: they are felt, and received within the heart. They live and moove, and I see in them the sinewes of the first Christians; and the style of that Heroicke age, where one and the same vertue, gave life both to discourse and actions; gave influence both to the soule and to the courage, made both Doctours and also Martyrs. Tell mee true, Did you not purpose to your selfe a Patterne to follow? Have you not beene at the Oracle of—: have you not received some inspiration from our excellent friend? Me thinkes I meete with his very Character. In certaine passages I observe some markes and traces of his spirit; and when I reade them, cannot sometimes forbeare crying out: Sic oculus, sic ille manus, &amp;c. You neede not take offence at my suspition: so noble a resemblance is an inferiority lifted up extremely high. You are not therein his Apc, but his Sonne: There is nothing base nor meane in the imitation of so high and perfect an Idea: and you know the example of Plato, made Philo goe checke by jowle with him.

All I aske of you at Paris, where you so liberally offer me all the good offices you can doe, is but this; that you will doe me the favour, to assure that great personage of the great reverence I beare to his merits: and what glory I count it to be counted his friend: but I require withall the continuation of your owne love, with which you can honour none, that is more truely then I am,

                     To Mounsieur Coeffeteau, Bishop of Dardanie. LETTER VIII.
                     SIR, since your departure from Mets; there hath nothing hapne
                           •…
                         worthy of the History I promised you, but onely that the Emperour as I heare, hath presented to the view of brave spirits, certaine new and very strange recreations by which hee hath gained a great opinion of his knowledge. As to make the Images in a peece of Tapistry, to walke, and move: to make all the faces in a roome, to seeme to be double; to make a river rise in a Hall; and after streaming away without wetting

of any, make a company of Fayries appeare and dance a round; these are his ordinary sports, &amp; to use the phrase of our friend; but the outside of his secret Philosophy. Signior Mercurio Cardano, sweares hee hath seene all this, and more; enough to finde you discourse for many meetings: and if you appoint him to set hand to his Penne, he will be a Philostratus to this Appolonius. Hee hath told me, as hee hath heard it from him, that for certaine, the heavens meuace France, with a notable revolution; and that the fall of—, hath not beene so much the end, as the change of our mysteries. For my selfe who know, that God never makes Mountibanks of his Counsaile; and that the vertue of the King, is able to correct the malignity of the starres: I laugh at the vanitie of such Presages; and looke for nothing but happinesse from the ascendant and fortune of so great a Prince. But to change this Discourse, and this Mountibanke for another: I have seene the man Sir, that is all armed with thornes: that pursues a Proposition to the uttermost bounds of Logicke; that in most peaceable conversations, will put forth nothing, nor admit of nothing that is not a Dialemma, or a Syllogisme. To tell you true, what I thinke of him; he would please me more if hee had lesse reason: this quarrelsome Eloquence affrights me more than it perswades mee. They which commonly converse with him; runne in my opinion the same fortune, which they doe, that live neere the falls of Nilus; there is no overflowing,

like that of his words, a man cannot safely give him audience; a Headache for three dayes after, is the least hurt hee can take, that but heares him after dinner. The Gentleman that brings you this Letter, hath charge given him from all in generall to entreate you Sir, not to forsake us in so important a matter: but to come and free our companies from one of the greatest crosses, that hath a long time afflicted civill societie. You are the onely man in whom this Sophister hath some beleefe: and therefore none but you, likely to reduce him to common right; and to bring his spirit to submit it selfe to Custome and Vsage. You can if you please make it appeare unto him; that an honest man proposes alwayes his opinions, no otherwise than as doubts; and never raiseth the sound of his voyce, to get advantage of them, that speake not so loud, that nothing is so hatefull, as a chamber Preacher who delivers but his owne word; and determines withou warrant, that it is fit to avoid gestures, which are like to Threatnings, and termes which carrie the stile of Edicts; I meane, that it is not fit to accompany his Discourse, with too much action; nor to affirme any thing too peremptorily. Lastly, that conversation reflects more upon a popular estate, then upon a Monarchie; and that every man hath there a right of suffrage: and the benefit of libertie. You know Sir, that for want of due observing these petty rules, many have fallen into great inconveniences; and you remember one who maintained an argument

at the Table, with too great violence, disturbed and drove Queene Margaret from her dinner. Such men commonly spoile the best causes; whilst they seeke to get the better, not because their cause is good; but because themselves are the Advocates; Reason it selfe seemes to be wrong, when it is not of their side, at least not in its right place, nor in its ordinary forme. They disguise it in so strange a fashion that it cannot be knowne to any; and they take away her authority and force, by painting her in the colours and markes of folly. Against these Ringleaders, it is that wee desire you to come, and to take the paines of applying your Exorcismes, particularly upon—you will have a thousand Benedictions, if you can drive out of his body, this devill of dispute and wrangling; which hath begunne already to torment us. Wee expect you at the end of the weeke; and I remaine,
                     
                        Sir,

                           From Mets, 15. Augu. 1618.
                        
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     To my Lord the Earle of Brassac. LETTER IX.
                     SIR, that which I have written of you; is but a simple relation of that I have seene of you: and if there be any ornament in it: It must needs be, that either your selfe have put it there; or else that Fortune hath lent it to me. I had done it very innocently, I assure you, if I had spoken any thing well; who was so ill prepared for it. I should have hit a marke which I aimed not at; and have drawne a Picture, by the casuall falling downe of my Pensill. My drift was to entertaine my friend, who was accustomed to the negligence of my style: and with whom; if I committed any fault, I was sure of Pardon. Hee cries not out murther, upon seeing one Vowell encounter another, nor stands amazed at meeting with an untoward word as if it were a Monster: This favour I receive from him; and he, the like from me: we allow all liberty to our thoughts: and if in treating together, wee should not sometimes violate the lawes of our Art, wee should never shew confidence enough in our friendshippe. Rhetoricke therefore hath no place in Writings where Truth takes up all: There is great difference betweene an Oratour, and a Register; and my private testimony ought not to passe for

your Encomium. Yet you will have it to be so; you had rather accuse me of being eloquent, then confesse your selfe to be vertuous; and you avoid presumption, by a contrary extremitie. It seemes this occasion is dangerous to you; and as in a shipwracke, where all runne to save the dearest things: so you abandon your other vertues, to preserve your modesty. Shee doth her selfe wrong Sir, to stand in opposition to the publike voyce; and to reject the testimony of noble fame. Shee ought not to contradict the two chiefe Courts of Europe; whereof the one honoureth your memory, the other makes use of your counsels. Aristotle would never approove of this; who speakes of a vice, with which if a man be tainted, he resembles him to one, who will not confesse hee hath wonne in the Olympicke games, though men come and adjudge him the Garland; and calls himselfe still culpable: though three degrees of the Areopage, pronounce him innocent. Be not you, of solittle equitie to your selfe; and suffer mee to tell you what I thinke; seeing I thinke nothing, but that which is the common opinion; and I deliver not so much my owne particular conceit, as the generall beleefe of the whole world: They who preferre a Captaine of Carabins before Alexander the Great; and know not how to praise the integritie of a Statesman, without affronting that of Aristides; fall into that excesse which reason requires should be avoided. Yet we ought not for all this, generally to slight all merit of the present age; and fancie to our selves, that we are not bound to

revere vertue, unlesse it be consecrated by Antiquitie. For my selfe, I judge more favourably of things present, and doe not thinke I run any hazard in subscribing to the Popes judgement of you, that in serving the King, you have beene his governour. This would be to be too scrupulous, to feare mistaking, after him that they say cannot erre; and you are too courteous, to count it a courtesie that I doe my dutie; and to give mee thankes that I am not a Schismaticke. Concerning the last Article of your Letter; I say it gives me not so much, as a temptation: neither am I indeede capable to receive it. It sufficeth me Sir, that you protect my repose here; for to enter into defence of my interests in the place where you are, as you doe me the honour to promise me; I would advise you not to undertake it. You could never looke for better successe, then the prime man of this age had, who could not obtaine of—; the favour he required of him, in my behalfe. It is much easier to breake downe the Alpes; and to bridle the Ocean, then to procure the paiment of my Pension: and there is nothing that can make a worker of miracles see, there is some thing impossible for him to doe; but onely my ill fortune. There are the bounds of this power, which is so much envied: The good will hee beares me, cannot draw from Spaine the eight thousand pounds which are due unto me: and it is Gods will hee should be disobeyed in this, that I may be a witnesse against them who say that he is absolute. I onely intreate you, seeing you desire to oblige me

to you, to shew him the constancie of my passions, which is obdurate against ill successes, and preserves it selfe entire amidst the ruines of my hopes, It shall be satisfaction enough for me that hee doe me the honour to beleeve I can adore freely and without hope of reward; and that I should doe him as great reverence if he were not in so great a height of happinesse. I expect this favour from your ordinary goodnesse, and promise my selfe that you will alwayes have a little love for me, seeing I have a will to be all my life most perfectly,
                     
                        Sir,

                     SIR, say what you can, I am not so indulgent to my passion as you are injurious to your owne merits. Amongst all your good qualities, you have one that seemes an enemy to all the rest, detraction doth you more justice then you doe your selfe, and envie it selfe

gives you that which your owne modesty takes away from you. This is not to handle the truth civilly, to respect her then when shee embraceth you? This is to render her evill for good, to call her fabulous, when shee calls you vertuous. I finde in this Sir more scruple then Religion: The first and most antient charitie is thereby broken, and you are faultie in the first principle of your dutie; if before doing justice to all the world, you deny to doe it to your selfe alone. It must bee a great precisenesse of conscience that shall finde in you the evills you accuse your selfe of, and a sight more cleare then mine that shall see defaults in the course of your life. If you have any that are surely immateriall, and such as fall not under sence. They come not within the knowledge of any; It must bee a secret betweene your confessour and you. None is knowne Sir, at least not knowne to be revealed, and if any were so knowne, it would rather be found a proofe of humilitie then a marke of imperfection. I am none therefore, as you say I am, of these charitable lyars, who attribute to them they love all that they want, nor of these forgers of commonwealths, who carry their imagination beyond all possibilitie of things; I present not unto you an Idea to make you better then you are, but taking you into consideration I propose you as my example to stirre me up to goodnesse; I draw your picture for my owne use and not for your glory; I intend more the instructing my selfe then the pratling with

you. The object of so elevated a vertue fills my minde with great desires, and if it astonish me sometimes with its heighth, it makes mee at least see by experience, that an inferiour vertue is possible to be acquired; so that to say true, I studie you more then I praise you, and am in this more swayed with interest then with passion: I meane this passion without eyes, that riseth onely from the animall part, for as for that which is reasonable and works with knowledge I have that for you in the highest degree, and by all kinds of obligations and of duties am

                     To Mounsieur Heinfius, Professor of the Politicks at Leyden. LETTER XI.
                     SIR, I acquit my selfe of a charge that was laid upon me, and send you from Mounsieur Favereau the verses hee lately made for the King; they have had the approbation of all France, but they have not yet had his owne, and if this publicke judgement bee not confirmed by your particular, he takes it but as the passion of a mother; and that France doth

but flatter her children. He thinkes no glory is legitimate whereof you are not the distributour, and that things are not so good by their owne goodnesse, as by the account you make of them; you see by this Sir what ranke you hold in the Commonwealth of Letters, and that I am not the onely man that looke upon you with veneration, being seated in the Throane of the great Scaliger, and giving lawes to all the civill parts of Europe. The highest degree that a man can aspire unto, who is Prince amongst his owne, is to become a judge amongst strangers; and there to get reverence where he cannot pretend subjection. To this uppermost Region of merit are you ascended; the light of your doctrine shines upon more then one people, and more then one country; it spreads and communicates it selfe in divers places and kinds; it hath as well adorers a farre off, as admirers at home: He of whom I speake Sir is worth a whole multitude, and makes not onely a part of a choise company, but is himselfe alone a company and a number. Doe you aske for qualities intellectuall and morall? for vertues civill and militarie? would you have a Philosopher a Mathematitian, a Poet, for Latine, Italian, French? you shall finde them all in his one person. Hee hath the key of the most sublime sciences, and the superintendance of the noblest Arts. Heretofore he hath beene the dispenser of the conceits of Marino, the reformer and pruning knife of the superfluities of

his stile, at this time he is overseer of all curious workes; the Oracle that Carvers consult, and the spirit that guides the hand before Painters. Hee meddles in an infinite number of things with equall capacitie, and hath as many trades as Sage Stoicks had; but makes better workes of them then he did. It is not possible either to fill his spirit, or to set it about worke enough; so greedy and unsatiable it is of knowledge, so impatient of rest, and growing fresh with action. And to impart to you the expression of a gallant friend of ours; hee is in as great a heate for the pleasures of the minde, as the Princes of Asia are for the pleasures of the body; and as they have many Concubines besides the Sultana which they marry, so hath he one profession as his principall studie, but leaves not for all that to follow other exercises, though follow them but with inferiour affection; so that it cannot be sayd of him, that hee knowes all, but that hee ought to know; and that hee is nothing lesse then that hee ought to be. Hee acquits himselfe most worthily of his charge, and never stands in contemplation, when it is time to be in action. If hee be a great Poet, he is no lesse a great Lawyer; hee makes as well the draught of a Processe as the description of a Tempest; and having sung Phillis and Amarillis with an admirable grace, he treats of Seia and Sempronia with no lesse soliditie. I give this testimony as religiously of him, as if I gave it before a Iudge, and as if my writing were upon oath. Is it not fit you

should be ignorant of his merit, whom without any merit you ought to respect, though but onely for his respect to you. It is fit you know that he is an elevated person, humbling himselfe before you, and a Saint offering you sacrifice. It is fit also I should satisfie his desire, which you shall see in the word he hath written to you, as hee was going out of his Inne and taking Coach, but that done Sir, it is not fit I should forget my selfe; I entreate you therefore you will be pleased that in presenting to you the vowes of another, I may offer you also my owne, and make you this true protestation, that I am,

                     SIR, the Letter you tooke the paines to write unto me hath calmed my spirit, and given it ease; I could have no comfort of the newes of your death, but onely by that of your resurrection; and to make an end of weeping for you, it was necessary you should

come your selfe and stay my teares. I am none of these broachers of Paradoxes, whom too much reason makes unreasonable, and have no feeling either of joy or greefe. My spirit is more tender, and my Philosophie more humane; and let them as long as they please call these passions infirmities, yet for my part I had rather have my maladie then their health; If I had lost you, I had lost part of my selfe, and should never thinke my selfe an entire man againe, and if I had not hope to enjoy againe your learned conversation, I should finde nothing but bitternesse in my life; nothing in my studies but thornes, at this time especially when I am promised a retreate three miles from Bloys, and that I shall come under the jurisdiction of M. the Lievetenant Generall. I doe not much rejoyce at this your new Dignitie, because I doe not rejoyce at the servitude of my friends; and because I doe not count it any great happinesse to bee alwayes handling the Sores and Vlcers of the people. I make more reckoning of your idlenesse then of your imployment, and of the Elegie you will make then of all the judgements you will give. If you please to send it, or please to bring it your selfe to Paris, you shall make choyse your selfe in what place of my booke you will have it set; and I shall not bee a little proud to have so faire a marke remaining of your friendship. I had more to say, but I was pull'd away from my Letter, and your owne best friends debauch me; I must therefore

perforce leave you, yet assuring you once againe that I am infinitely glad I shed my teares for you without cause, and that no man is more truly then my selfe,
                     
                        Sir,

                     To Mounsieur Chapelain. LETTER XIII.
                     SIR, if your ticket had overtaken me at Orleans, I had certainly returned to Paris to receive that honour it promised me; and not have lost so pleasing a visit, which would have comforted me for a troublesome one that afflicted me not a little the day before. But the mischiefe is, that I was come hither before your ticket, and all I can doe now, is to let you know the greefe I take, that my inclination and my affaires lye not alwayes in the same place. They have drawne mee from the suburb Saint German, to make me ride Poste in the greatest violence of the late heate; and have exposed my head to all the beames, or to speake like a Poet, to all the Arrowes of the Sunne. I vow unto you that being in this case, I even repented my selfe of all the good I had ever said of it, and would faine call backe my praises, seeing it made no difference at all betweene

mee and my Post boy who had never praysed it. Thankes be to God I am now in place of safety, where you may well thinke I seeke rather to quench my thirst, then to make my selfe fat, and looke more after refreshing then tricking my selfe up. To this purpose I forget nothing of that I have learned in Italy: My ordinary Diet is upon the fruits of Autumne; being of opinion that no intemperance of these pure Viands can be dishonest, and that it is not fit to be sober as long as the Trees offer us their store, and tempt our appetite. Bee pleased Sir, that my businesse may not be to doe untill the Trees shall have nothing upon them but leaves; and that I may not goe to the Citty but when the Winter drives mee from the Country. In the meane time, I leave mine honour to your care, in the place where you are, and recommend unto you a little reputation that is left me, having so many warres upon me, and so many combinations made against me. I would bee glad my name had lesse lustre, and my life more quiet, but I know not where to finde obscuritie; I am so well knowne, it not by my good qualities, at least by my ill fortune, that though I should banish my selfe into a strange country, I doe not thinke I could be hidden. Ubique Notus perdidi exili

                            locum, I have no remedy therefore but to continue in this famous miserie, and to be labouring continually to provoke the envious, and to make worke for the idle; wherein notwithstanding, if I shall doe

any thing that pleaseth you; I shall not thinke my labour ill bestowed—: I am in truth in great impatience to make knowne to all the world, the account I make of your vertue: and to leave a publike testimony, and if I durst say it, an eternall; by which posterity may see, that wee have loved one another; and I passionately have beene and am,

                     To Mounsieur Mainard. LETTER XIV.
                     SIR, I have heard this day by a Letter from Mounsieur Chapelain, that you are at Paris, and that in some businesse of his; you have obliged him exceedingly: wherein you have done more than ever you ment; and your action hath in it a double merit. I owe you thankes for it in my owne behalfe: and besides, being joyned as I am with him in communion of all goods and evills; you cannot fasten upon him, and leave me free. Hee sends mee no word of the nature of his businesse, in which you have

done him such good offices: but I doubt me, it is some imployment beyond the Alpes, and dependance upon some Ambassadour to Rome. Whereof I thinke I may truely say, without giving reines to my Passion at all; that hee hath both the substance and the supplenesse, which are necessary in dealing with the braines of that country; and that hee, under whom he serves, may lie and sleepe all the time of his imployment, without any prejudice at all to the Kings service. They who see but his outside onely, take him for a neate man, and one of excellent and pleasing qualities: but I, to whom hee hath discovered that, which hee hides from all the world besides: I know him to be a man capable of great designes, and that besides speculative knowledge, hee possesseth those also which serve for use, and are reduceable to action. I would say more, if the Poste would suffer me. I will onely adde this in point of his honesty, which I said to you once, of an antient Roman, that I see no example of vertue, in all the first Decade of Titus Livius, that is of too high a straine, or too hard for him. Never therefore withdraw your affection, from so worthy a place; and so long as you thus oblige my friends, It is I that will be,
                     
                        Sir,  
                        Your, most humble and most obliged servant, &amp;c.

                     To———LETTER XV.
                     SIR, in the Letter which—received from you, I saw a line or two for me, that would even tickle a heart that were harder then mine, and which I could not reade without some touch of vaineglory. There is a pleasure in yeelding to such sweete temptations, and though I know my merit hath no right to so gratious a remembrance, yet by what title soever I come to be happy, I am not a little proud of my fortune. These are Sir the meere effects of your goodnesse, and your experiments in that art, with which you know how to gaine hearts, and to purchase men without buying them. The fairest part of the earth in which you have left a deere remembrance of your name, gives this testimony of you by the mouth of its Princes, and of their subjects, but seeing in the place where you are, you meete with spirits of love and tendernesse; it cannot be that any should escape you, upon whom you have any designe to take hold. All things are biting beyond the Garonne; the Sheepe of that Country are worse then the Woolves of this; and I have heard a great person of our age say, That if France had a soule, certainly Gascognie should be the Irascible part. Yet I heare Sir, you have already sweetned all you found fowre

there; and that your onely looke hath melted all the stcele of the courages of that Province. Mounsieur de—and my selfe make account to goe see the progresse of so admirable a beginning, and this next Summer to come and behold you in all your glory. But if we goe thirtie miles for——wee would more willingly goe three hundred for———and I begin to thinke already of a vow to Loretta, that I may thereby have a colour to goe to Rome, to be there at the time when you shall doe honour to France, and maintaine the Kings rights. This cannot be too soone for his service, nor soone enough for my desire, who am,

                     SIR, I am very slow in answering your Letter, but I could not doe it sooner; after three moneths of continuall agitation, this is my first houre of leasure, and the first place I finde of commerce, to tender you the Compliment

I owe you. I see well that your word is not subject to the accidents of the world, and that I have chosen a plot which is out of the reach of Fortune. Your affection to mee is not of this brittle matter that friendships at Court bee made of; it is of a more excellent stuffe, and such as neither time can weare out, not my negligence weaken. I neede not doubt of preserving a good that you keepe for mee; your faithfulnesse is more then my negligence, and I am more assured of your honestie then of my owne; notwithstanding what certainty soever I have of your love, it is no trouble to me to have new assurances: Men that are well enough perswaded, yet will goe to a Sermon, and take a pleasure to heare that they know already. For my selfe I can never be weary of reading a thing that gives mee satisfaction, and though it were as feigned as it is true, yet you write it with so good a grace that it would bee a pleasure to be so deceived; yet it is fit to stay my selfe there, and not to fall from joy into presumption; how can you looke my spirit should containe it selfe within its bounds, knowing that I am talked of at Rome, and that my name is sometimes pronounced by the most eloquent mouth of Italy? you should have concealed the expresse charge you had from M. the Cardinall of Bentivoglio, to send me his History; or at least for a temper to my vanitie, you should have told mee at the same time, that I must not impute a favour to my owne sufficiencie, for which I am beholding

to your good offices; I may beleeve Sir that he had never had this thought of me, if you had not stirred it up in him by some favourable mention you made of my person; and I know he puts so great a trust in you, that after you have once made a commendation, hee would make a conscience to use his owne judgement in examining my worth. From what ground soever my happinesse comes, I am bound to acknowledge the visible cause, and to that I destinate my first good dayes journey that God shall send me. I will not faile to give thankes to M. the Cardinall, and to give him an account of my reading, that hee may see I know as well how to receive as hee to give. In the meane time I offer him a present farre unworthy of the magnificence of his, and which will shew him, how with his hooke of Gold hee hath fished but grasse, such as it is you shall doe mee a favour to present it to him, and to let mee hold the possession I have in your love, whose I am all my life,
                     
                        Sir,  
                        Your, &amp;c.

                     To Mounsieur de Nesmond, Controller of the Princes house. LETTER XVII.
                     SIR, my deare Cousin, your Letter hath told me no newes, it hath onely confirmed mee in my opinion; and testified that you are alwayes good, and alwayes doe mee the honour to love me. You have qualities of greater luster then this, but you have none of greater use; and they that could live without your wisedome, yet cannot beare the misse of your goodnesse. My sister and I continue to implore it in a businesse which is already set on foote by your commendation, and which attends a full accomplishment by your second endeavour. It is neither without example nor without reason; it needes but such an undertaker as your selfe, and you may easily save it from rigorous justice, if you will but lend a little ayd to its equity. Of your will I make no doubt, it is the continuall agitation of the court that makes me feare, which drives men one way and their affaires another. But if the heavens helpe us not, wee are not like in hast to see it in any state of consistence; it will bee alwayes floting like the Island of Greece, untill a great birth shall make it stay; and that God make sure the Kings victories by the Queenes fruitfulnesse. In the meane time it is not fit

you should stay at home, but that you should make one in all voyages; but you must not bee of these voyages that get many hoasts, and few friends. You are in a state of obliging and making men beholding to you by doing alwayes good; and now for feare you should want matter to worke upon, I offer you matter here to set you aworke. Be pleased Sir; my deare Cosin, that I intreate you to deliver to—the Letter I writ unto him; and when you deliver it, to testifie withall unto him, that having the honour to bee to you as I am, the things that touch me must needs concerne you; Heretofore I have held good place in his confidence, and to use the termes of a man you hate not: Vetus mihi cum eo consuetudo, &amp; cum privatus eraet Amici vocabamur. Even lately at Paris hee offered mee courtesies that might have contented a prouder mans vanitie then mine; and I received from him more good words then was possible for mee to returne him. But these illustrious friendships require continuall cares, and an assiduitie without cessation. I know they are subject to a thousand inconveniences, and that they grow cold if they be not stirred up and kindled continually. Three words of your mouth spoken with a due accent, may save me the solliciting of three moneths, and my requests ought not to seeme uncivill; seeing I desire nothing but this, that—should not doe mee the honour to make a promise, and then leave there, and think that enough. To this purpose I send

you a short instruction for—: and you may be pleased to be a meanes, that hee cast his eyes upon it; at such time as the businesse hee hath about your person shall permit him. I would not sollicite you so boldly: nor presse upon you so burdensome a familiarity, if you had not your selfe made the overture first. It is a persecution you have drawne upon your selfe by the liberall offers you made mee in your Letter; and I conceive you speak as you meane, as I doe, in protesting that I honour you with my soule; and am,
                     
                        Sir, my deare Cosin,

                     To Mounsieur de Borstell. LETTER XVIII.
                     SIR, I doe not know my selfe in your Letters: you are like those Painters, that care not for making a face like, so they make it faire. Certainely you thought upon some honester man than my selfe; when you tooke the paines to write unto mee; and your Idaea went beyond your subject: or else you meant to excite mee to vertue by a new subtilty; and the

praises you give mee are but disguised exhortations. They could not be Sir, either more fine, or more delicate: and I doe not thinke, that your pretended Barbarisme, comes any thing behind the Grecian eloquence. But tell me true; Is it not as artificiall as Brutus his folly? And are not you in plaine termes a Cosener, to make us beleeve you come from that climate, from whence the cold and foule weather comes? Whereas it cannot be you should be borne any where but in the heart of Paris: or if any place be more French then Paris: that certainely must needes have beene your Cradle. You speake too well, not to speake naturally; this garbe, and this purity, in which you expresse your selfe, is not a thing that can be learned by Bookes: you owe it to a neerer cause; and study goes not so farre as it. There have strangers beene Marshalls of France, but their accent hath alwayes discovered, they were not naturall: and they have found it more easie, to merit the leading of our Armies, and to gaine the favour of our King; then to learne our language, and attaine a true pronouncing. But Sir, seeing in your person, there is seene an Ambassadour of eighteene yeares old: and a wisedome without experience: there is not so great a wonder in the world as your selfe: nor any thing incredible after this. It is fit onely, that you make more account than you doe, of this so rare and admirable a quality: and that you should use it, according to its merits; and not employ it upon

base subjects, that are not worthy of it. Otherwise how good an Artist so ever you be; you will be blamed for making no better choise of your Materialls; and my selfe, who draw so much glory from, our fault; had yet much rather see you employ your excellent language, in treating of Princes interests, and the present estate of Europe; then in advancing the value of a poore sicke man: who prayes you to keepe your valuing, for—; and askes you nothing but pitty; or at most but affection: if this be to merit it, that I passionately am,
                     
                        Sir,  
                        Your, &amp;c.

                     To him another. LETTER XIX.
                     SIR, I remember my promise, upon condition you forget not yours: and that in case you come within sixe miles of Balzac: you will allow mee the halfe dayes journey, I require. It is not any hope I have to send you away well satisfied, either with your Hoste, or with your lodging: that makes mee to make this request: but it is Sir, for my owne benefit: for you know very well, we never have commerce

together, but all the gaine remaines of my side. I finde that in your conversation, which I seeke for in vaine, in my neighbours Libraries: and if there fall out any errours in the worke I am about, the faults must be attributed to your absence. Leave mee not therefore, I entreate you, to my owne senee, and suffer mee to be so proud, as to expect one of your Visits, if you goe to Santoigne, or otherwise to prevent it, if you stay at Lymousin. There are some friendships that serve onely to passe away the time, and to remedy the tediousnesse of solitarinesse: but yours Sir, besides being pleasant, is withall I vow, no lesse profitable. I never part from you, that I bring not away pleasuros that last, and profit that doth you no hurt. I make my selfe rich, of that you have too much; and therefore as you ought not to envie me my good fortune, which costs you little: so you ought to beleeve also, that as long as I shall love my selfe, I shall be,
                     
                        Sir,

                     Another to him. LETTER XX.
                     SIR, at that time when Mistris—parted from hence; I was too much out of order to present my selfe before a wise man; and I chose rather to be failing in the rules of civilitie, then to be importunate upon you with my Compliments. Now that I am a little at qulet; and can fall to worke indifferent well; I must needes tell you, that the confidence I have of your love, sweetens all the bitternesse of my spirit, and that in my most sensible distasts; I finde a comfort in thinking of this. It is certaine Sir, the world is strangely altered, and good men now a dayes, cannot make a troope. This is the cause, that seeing you are one of this little flocke which is preserved from infection; and one of those that keepe vertue from quite leaving us; I therefore blesse incessantly Madam Desloges, for the excellent purchase I have made by her, meanes: and proclaime in all places, that shee discovered me a treasure when she brought me first to be acquainted with you. If I husband it not, and dresse it with all the care and industry, it deserves; it is not, I assure you, for want of desire: but so sweete and pleasing duties, have no place amidst the traverses of a life in perpetuall agitation, and your ordinary conversation is reserved for

men more happy than I. I waite therefore for this favour from a better fortune than the present, as also occasions by which I may testifie, that I possionately am,
                     
                        Sir,  
                        Your, &amp;c.

                     To him another. LETTER XXI.
                     SIR, although I am ravished with your eloquence, yet I am not satisfied: but you remaine still unjust, and I not well pleased. I see what the matter is; you are so weary of your Pennance at Lymousin: that you have no minde to come and continue it in Angoumois. You like better to goe in a streight line to the good, then to goe to it by the crooked change of evill; and preferre a safe harbour before an incommodious creeke. Wherein Sir, I cannot blame your choise; onely I complaine of your proceeding; and finde it strange, you should disguise your joy, for escaping a badde passage, and that you are content to be unhappy at Rochell; because you will not venture to be unhappy here. These high and Theologicall comparisons

which you draw from the austeritie of Anchorets, concerning workes of supererogation; concerning Purgatory and Hell, make me know you are a mocker, and can make use of Ironies, with the skill and dexterity of Socrates. Take heede I be not revenged upon this Figure of yours by another, and returne your Hyperboles. For this once, I am resolved to suffer all; hereafter perhaps, I shall helpe my selfe with my old Armes. But howsoever the world goe: and in what stile soever I write unto you, you may be sure I speake seriously, when I say, that I very firmely am;

                     SIR, I am exceedingly beholding to you, for remembring mee; and for the good newes you have so liberally acquainted me withall. If the—loved Suger, as well as they love salt; they should have enough of it, never to drinke any thing but Hyppocras; nor to eate any thing but Comfits. Without jeasting I vow, these are excellent Rebells; and

their simplicitie is more subtill than all the Art and Maximes of Florence. These Mariners reade Lessons now to the inhabitants of Terra firma; and are become the Paedagouges of Princes. There is nothing of theirs that troubles mee, but the proposition of their Truce. They should reject it, as a temptation of the devill: and I dare sweare, it was never set a foote, but to gaine time and opportunity: The good will, the Spaniard makes shew to beare them; is the baite they shew upon the hooke they hide, hee seekes not after them, but to catch them; and he makes shew of kindnesse; because hee could doe no good with force. Though I have not read the Booke you spake to me of; yet I doubt not of its worth and goodnesse; I know the Authour is a man of great learning and experience, and one that hath beene brought up at the feete of Gamaliel; I meane of—: who no doubt hath acquainted him with all the Mysteries of our state. For my selfe, it must needes be that I speake but at hap hazard of this matter: for it would be a miracle, if by living in the woods, I should learne the skill to governe cities; and that I should be a Polititian and a Lawyer, being scarce either a man or a citizen: for to speake truely, if the first be a sociable creature, and the other a manager of some part of the common wealth: I see not in the estate I am in, how I can justly pretend to either of these two qualities. In favour therefore of Mounsieur—I yeeld up my right in all the good I receive from you; and in all

the praises you give me, as things that much more belong to him than mee. Admire as much as you will, his subtiltie; but yet make some reckoning of my freenesse; and give him that which I leave him; but yet keepe for mee, that wich you cannot take from mee, without doing mee wrong: I meane your good-will; which ought to be the prize of my passion, and of the fidelity, with which I shall be all my life,
                     
                        Sir,  
                        Your, &amp;c.

                     To him another. LETTER XXIII.
                     SIR, I should be extremely culpable, if you were not extremely good; but I know, you are no rigorous exactour of that which is your due, and that you have much indulgence, for the faults of those you love. My idlenesse is even become stupidity; and hath taken from me all use both of speaking and writing; yet all things considered, this is no ill qualitie at this time: no man is bound to give account of his silence; and many become Delinquents for their speaking. I doe not thinke therefore

you would aske mee newes, in a time, when reporting it is dangerous: and when one may be called in question to make explication of it before Magistrates; though the litterall sence of our words be innocent, they may search the allegoricall, and stand punctuall upon an equivocall terme to make us culpable of another mans subtiltie. But I defie the most pregnant Grammarian, and the most severe inquisitour to finde any fault in the protestation I make of most perfectly honouring your vertue, and of being with all my soule,
                     
                        Sir,  
                        Your, &amp;c.
                        
                           At Paris 4. May, 1631.
                        
                     
                  
                  
                     To him another. LETTER XXIV.
                     SIR, if my Letters had beene lost, you should have knowne long ere this the joy I have had in being cleared of the most important debts that troubled me, and in learning from your selfe that you doe me alwayes the honour to love me; not that I ever doubted of your goodnesse, but I have so much knowledge of my owne unfortunatenesse, that I cannot heare any ill newes so incredible which I doe not

beleeve to be very probable. Yet I perceive Sir by your holding out so firmely in behalfe of a partie ruined, that you are not easily altered either in your opinions, or from your errours. That which you have once spoken, and indeede that you have but once conceived, is never changed nor revoked; and therefore as I have nothing more deare nor more pretious then your friendship, so have I nothing also more assured or of more soliditie. This antient German Probitie is not a whit altered by contagion of our ill examples, and the strength of your constitution hath beene able to resist the ill aire of our Court. It is not out of ignorance that you follow not the false maximes of this; but follow your owne and those that bee lawfull; and if it be true, that the king of the Flies hath a sting indeed, but never stings, it is much more true of you, that having the power and abilitie to doe evill, yet for all that you are no evill doer. But this would bee too little to praise you but thus; they that understand you well will say with mee, there is nothing in vertue so high or difficult, to which your spirit is not aspired; and as nature hath given you al the good qualities that cannot be acquired by studie, so your owne studie hath procured you all the good qualities that are not in the gift of nature. Though your courtesies had left mee my first libertie, and that there were neither Obligation on your part nor Resentment on mine, yet I should say as much as I doe, and give this testimony of you before all the

world, and I am not lesse true of my word then I am,
                     
                        Sir,

                     SIR, this bearer will toll you how often in a day I am speaking of you, and in what esteeme your vertue is in all places where I am heard speake; yet I speake but of the kind of life you have chosen, and this I propose as the peace of passions, which with others are so mutinous, and as the kingdome of wisedome, which is not free in the great world. Never repent you of so hardy a flight, nor of so noble a banishment; the leasure that you take is farre better then the imployment that others desire, and you are that close happie man that enjoyes true happinesse without either pompe or envie.

                     This me thinkes is your very description, and might bee mine also, if I had cut off a little thread by which I hang still about Paris; out of a fancie of my friends, without any hope at all in my selfe, for thankes bee to God I have purged my spirit from all smoakes and fumes of the Court, and my ambition goes no further then the border of my village. I have no longer any thoughts but rustique and provinciall; and demand not of—but onely abatement—and returne of Quart d' Escus; if these be two things, and as it is said, both within his power. One conference with you will fully accomplish the setling me in a good state, and you cannot deny your councell to a man that hath a longing to put it in practise; and who is with his whole heart,
                     
                        Sir,

                        At Balzac

                     SIR, this day being the six and twentieth of Aprill, I solemnly renounce all Complements, yet after I have told you first that I never used any with you, but such as were most true, and that whatsoever I have written unto you heretofore untill now, is of as great force and vigour as if it had passed before a publicke Notarie. I have with a great deale of pleasure read the Latin which you did mee the favour to send me; the force of the reasoning, and the Oeconomie of the discourse content me exceedingly; onely one little word distasts me, and your friend might well have forborne to couple us with Mahometans and Infidells. The libertie which the King gives his Subjects, not to bee of his opinion, ought not to reach to the scandalizing of that opinion, and seeing he holds it a glory to bee the eldest sonne of the Church, to call this Church a whore, is in good French to call—He deserves Sir more respect, and your Doctours should have more descretion: For in truth, if their Religion were the prime Religion of the kingdome, and that they were at libertie to preach it in the Lovure; they could

never speake in higher termes, nor handle Catholicks in a ruder manner then they doe. I assure my selfe you will bee in this of my opinion: One must alwayes remember the condition of the time, and the state of affaires; wise men will never provoke them that are easily able to undoe them; and in the antient triumphs it was lawfull for the Souldiers to scoffe at their Generall; but it was not lawfull for the vanquished to speake reproachfully of the Conquerour; you may please to make some reflection hereupon, and I know you will conceive that innocencie it selfe becomes culpable if it draw on persecution. I bid you goodnight, and am,

                     SIR, without accepting the challenge you sent me, I thanke you for the care you had to make me winne honour; If it came of it

selfe I would perhaps not sticke to receive it, but if it cannot bee had without contesting, I will none of it; I love my ease too well, I say not to lose it, but even to hazard it in the best quarrell of the world. I am as patient and as utterly disarmed as an Anabaptist; I am afraid of a Potgunne or a Squibbe; farre from running upon Muskets and Swords points, as they say in our Vicinage. It would be a hard matter to draw a man of this humour to a combat; but a much harder matter to make me stand in argumentation, being resolved to let the world hold what opinion it pleaseth, and ever to forsake my owne, if any man will wrangle with mee for it. I desire neither to establish my owne Maxims, nor to destroy other mens; and if a Master of Arts should come and try me with Omnis Homo Currit, I would answer him Lascialo andar; and if hee should goe on and say, sed Petrus Currit, I would reply, Lascialo star; and if he would conclude, Ergo Petrus non est Homo, I would take my leave of him and say, Che m' Importa? I have very seriously considered of the Letter of——and absolutely lost all remembrance of my owne; I thought I had reason, and perhaps I was wrong, his intentions might bee good, but my interpretation of them was naught. The Conclusion is; Hee is a man I make infinite account of, and his friendship shall alwayes be dearer to me then my owne opinion. I conjure you to give him assurance hereof, and to get his leave that I may live; seeing I

am already beholding to you for so many other courtesies, and am also with all my soule,

                     To Mounsieur de Bois Robert. LETTER XXVIII.
                     SIR, if it had not beene for a troublesome rheume which hath followed mee now these fifteene dayes, I should have sooner thanked you for the new courtesies you have done me, and for the late paines you have taken for the most unprofitable servant you have. God will reward a nature so free and noble, for my selfe I can but praise it, and give it the testimony that is due unto it. But to make it perfect, I entreate you it may bee as sweete as it is gracious, and heale me if it may be without thrusting your nailes into my sores. I desire not to be left in my ill estate by flattery, but I desire to be drawne out of it without roughnesse; workes alone seasoned with sweetenesse content mee more then good deeds that are dry, and come from a proud hand. Be not

therefore like the friends of Iob, who reproached him in conforting him; but be compassinate a little to humane infirmities, and remember you cannot alter me unlesse you new make me. I dare not say, that I preferre the libertie of Desarts before the magnificence of Courts; and that chaines though never so well made and guilded over, doe yet not tempt me, I onely say, I know my selfe too well to meddle in a trade whereof I am not capable, and to beginne a life which ought to be ended in beginning it. Thus Sir I doe that out of consideration which you thinke I doe out of lazinesse, and the faintnesse of my spirit comes from that of my body. But I know it is impossible to perswade you to this, and no meanes is left me to justifie my sicknesse but by my death, and when you have lost me, then you will finde and say I had reason to complaine. In the meane time I understand that the devils of Paris, of Bruxells, &amp;c. are all let loose, and commit outrages upon me in foure or five Languages. The contrary faction fortifies it selfe daily, and there seemes to be merit and pietie in tearing asunder my reputation. Leave me not therefore to adversaries so incensed, and adde not your rigour to their crueltie. I conjure you to take some care of an afflicted soule; if I have defects, supply them by your vertue; if I bee negligent in my affaires, be you my tutour, but exact no more of mee then nature hath given me. You are too generous to put backe a man that casts himselfe betweene your

armes; and one that is more than any other in the world,
                     
                        Sir,  
                        Your, &amp;c.

                     To Mounsieur Descartes. LETTER XXIX.
                     SIR, your Letter found mee in the blackest humour I was ever in in all my life. To tell you, that in that estate it brought mee joy; were to speake too boldly for a man in misery: but it is true, it did a little mitigate my sadnesse, and made mee capable of consolation. I did not then live but in the hope I had to go see you at Amsterdam; and to embrace that deare Head, which is so full of reason &amp; understanding. This is that which hinders me from inviting you to come hither; or—: He is ever in the slavery of Ceremonies &amp; Compliments; and plaies the coward with such a valour of spirit, that one could not imagine. He hath the soule of a Rebell; &amp; the submission of a slave: if you may beleeve him, he hath no ambition; yet he consents to that of another; and dies of a sicknesse that is not his owne. See what it

is to be a sycophant; and to be undutifull by obedience. But you Sir, have raised your minde above these vulgar considerations: and when I thinke upon the Stoicks Wiseman, who onely was free, was rich, was a King; me thinkes, I see you foretold long agoe; and that Zeno was but the Figure of Mounsieur Descartes:
                     
                     
                        Foelix qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas,

                        Subjecit pedibus.
                     
                     Either you are this happy man, or heē is not to be found in the world; and the conquest of truth, for which you labour with so great force and industry seemes to mee a more noble businesse, then all that is done with so great bruite and tumult in Germany and Italy, I am not so vaine to pretend, I should be a companion of your travell herein; but I shall at least be a spectator; and shall enrich my selfe with the rellicks of the prey; and with the superfluitie of your abundance. Thinke not that I make this proposition by chance; I speake it in great earnest; and if you stay never so little in the place where you are; you shall finde mee a Hollander as well as your selfe; and my Masters, the States, shall not have a better citizen: nor one more passionate for libertie than I am. Although I love extremely the aire of Italy; and the soyle that beares Orenges; yet your vertue is able to draw me to the bankes of the frozen sea; and even to the uttermost border of the North. It is

now three yeares, that my imagination goes in quest after you; and that I even die with longing to be united to you, and never to part from you againe: and to testifie unto you, by a continuall subjection, that I passionately am,

                     To Mounsieur de la Motte-Aigron. LETTER XXX.
                     SIR, I have heard of the happy accomplishment of your marriage; and that it hath beene one of the great solemnities of Rochell. I have celebrated it here in my particular; with lesse pompe indeede and tumult; but with as much joy, and satisfaction of minde, as they that sung the Hymenaeus. Though perhaps you would not have it so; yet your contentments are mine; you have not any passion so proper to your selfe, which is not common with me, and play the cruell, as long as you will; I will have a share in that which is yours; even then,

when you will not affoord to give it mee. At the worst, I will love you still, as I have ever done, as a creature supremely excellent; though not supremely just: As there are some vertues that are fierce and scornefull; so there are some sciences which have attractives amidst their difficulties, and which draw us on in thrusting us backe, You are like these abstract knowledges: Your merit sweetens all your rigours: and how hard soever the persecution hath beene, which I have suffered: yet I vow unto you, I could never finde in my heart to hate the Tyrant. I have still so great a care of his reputation, that I would not be thought innocent; for feare he should be blamed to have done me wrong; and I had rather be a Prevaricatour, and treacherous to my selfe, then to seeme I had cause of complaint against him. We ought to condemne the memory of this disorder; and to suppresse this unfortunate Olympiade. Wee ought to perswade our imagination, that the matter is not so indeede; but that it is onely dreamt. When you shall please to remember your word; I shall see your Verses; and your friends Sermons. In the meane time Sir, if you will not have it be a meere liberality: I send you something, to exercise commutative justice, and beginne a trafficke whereof the Toll is not agreed upon to be taken of right. Never was man so miserably busied as my selfe; I am intricated with an infinite number of petty affaires: which, as you know, are no lesse cumbersome than the great: One thrust of a sword

hurts not so much as a hundred prickes of a Pinne: and the Arabians have a saying; It is a better bargaine to be devoured of a Lyon, than to be eaten up of Flyes. If I had you, I should have a Redeemer; but your State-businesse, is preferreable before my interests; and it is better I should want you, than come to have you with the curses of the people. I am, and shall never be,

                     To Mounsieur de Granier. LETTER XXXI.
                     SIR, thē day I parted from Paris; I dreamt not of taking any journey; but a newes which I received, made me take horse within an houre after I received it. This is that which hindred me from taking my leave; and to use such compliments with you, as in such cases are accustomed. If I did not know you to be an enemy of the tyranny of Ceremonies; and that you, as well as my selfe, cut off from friendshippe all vaine pompe and superfluities, I should study for long excuses to justifie my journey: but in so doing, I should offer wrong to a wise man; to thinke hee had opinions like the vulgar: and that hee would either give or

take so good a thing as liberty. I enjoy it as I would wish within these three or foure dayes; and I have received it at the banke of the river where I left it the last yeare. I banish from my minde all thoughts of the streete Saint Iaques; and dreame not either of my Prince or Commonwealth, either of enemies Bookes, or of my owne: I dreame, to say true, continually of you; and finde no Image in my memory so pleasing, as that which presents mee the time of our being together. I would willingly employ Atlante, or Melisse, to procure me a more solid contentment; and to convey you and your library hither in a night. I cannot forget this deare retreate of your repose; for, I know, that without this, you would finde even in Tyvolie, a want in your felicity; and that without your Bookes, our fruits would be but sowre; and our good cheere but of ill taste unto you. These are imaginations Sir, with which I flatter my selfe; whilst I stand waiting to returne to Paris; that I may there goe finde out a happinesse which cannot come hither to finde out me. If in the meane time you please to fend me some newes, whereof, you know provincicall spirits are extremely greedy; you shall give me meanes, to make a whole country beholding to me; and you neede deliver them, but onely to—: who will ease you of the paines of writing them. In these, I require not the straines of your understanding, nor the politique Animadversiana which come from this accurate, and

Collineant judgement; (to use the barbarous eloquence of our friend) it shall be enough for me that I may know in generall some part of that which passeth, and may have some Epitome of the History which you send weekely to Mounsieur D'Andylly. I humbly entreate you, to assure him that I honour him, continually with passion; and assure your selfe also, that I am,
                     
                        Sin, Your, &amp;c.

                     To Mounsieur de la Nauve, Commander of a Company in Pyedmont. LETTER. XXXII.
                     SIR, my deare Cousin, I cannot endure you should be cmoe backe into France, for nothing but—: and that hee should solely and without me, possesse a happinesse, which more belongs to mee than him. His Letters speake nothing but of your conversations, and of your feastings: newes which he sends me, rather to brave mee, and to set mee in a longing, then to give me any part in his good fortune, and to justifie my stay at Paris. I shall one

day have meanes to be revenged of him, for this malice: I doubt not to have libertie to walke abroad, when hee shall be tied to stay at home; and to have my turne in feasting and making merry, when hee shall stand waiting upon enterrements, and goe exhorting men that are to be hanged. Yet hee is all this while your Favorite in my absence, though hee ncede not thinke mee absent, unlesse hee will; for if hee love mee enough, to be troubled for losing mee, hee may easily recover mee, by looking upon your face. This resemblance betweene you and mee, is not the least of my vanities; and I vow unto you, I am proud of it in the highest degree: every day I thanke my mother for it in my heart; and doe a secret homage for it to Nature. It were enough for mee, to be taken for your Coppy; but my gray haires tell mee to my shame, that I am rather your Originall, and put mee in minde of this untoward advantage. I should not do much good, to paint them, unlesse withall, I could discharge the pensivenesse that hath changed them: for the tincture of this blots out all other. It is fit therefore to be merry, and to banish sorrow, seeing this is the onely meanes to new make us, and to make us able to resist old-age. I resolve my selfe to do so, though it be but to doe Fortune a spight; and to take from her by my not grieving, the pleasure she thinkes to take in her crueltie. But this goodly resolution stands in neede of you; my joy would be perfect, if you would sometimes

be a man of the Province; and that there were any appearance of hope, to see you at Condeville. I know no reason you should scorme an Iland, in which our Ariosto would have charmed his dearest Heroes; and whereof hee would have made a thousand other strange devises, if hee had beene able to discover it. Venture to come thither this next Sommer, I conjure you to it by the memory of—: and I will promise you, though not the good fellowshippes of Paris; yet at least the faire dayes of Pigneroll. But I feare mee much you are not setled enough to undertake so high a designe; nor good enough to come to civilize a clowne; who yet is beyond all I can say,
                     
                        Sir,  
                        Your, &amp;c.
                        
                           At Balzac 3. Ianua. 1634.
                        
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     Another to him. LETTER XXXIII.
                     SIR, my deare Cousin, the beginning of your Letter had frighted mee, and I was taking Alarum at these words of death and Physitians, but I recovered my spirits when I saw the first had failed of his blow, and that you use not the other but to strengthen you in an estate they have already put you; such dayes as this will prove more healthfull to you then all their Drugges, and the sweetnesse which begins to spring from the puritie of the Elements is the onely medicine that heales without corrupting, and cleanseth without fretting. For my selfe I thinke not of dying when I have once gotten March over my head, and me thinkes I finde my selfe renewed at the onely smelling of the Violets. I make use of them to more then one service, they serve me for Broaths as well as for Nosegayes. I cannot bee perswaded that cold purgeth the Ayre, or drives away sicknesse; and I am glad at heart to heare the Duke of Feria is dead of the Purples in the moneth of Ianuary, and that in Germany. At least this will justifie the Summer and the hot Countries, and will serve us for a proofe against—when according to his custome he will pleade our adversaries cause. I am more happy then I thought I was; seeing

you assure me that I am sometimes the subject of your conferences; and though in this you run the hazard of being in the number of those Oratours who were blamed for making ill choyse of their subjects; yet pardon mee if I account the testimony of your remembring me, more deare unto mee then the glory of your well speaking; and if I like rather you should talke of my idlenesse and of my walkes, then to discourse of publicke affaires or voyages of Princes. I regard not the estimation of the people, I would give a great deale to buy out that with which I have gotten it; but there are certaine friendships upon which onely I relie, and to be razed out of all accounts in the state would be lesse grievous to me then to be blotted out of your memory. Continue therefore these conferences which are so pleasing to mee, and of which I am in spirit a partaker, or rather deny me not these consolations which are so sweete unto mee, and whose effect I feele a hundred miles off. I cannot dissemble the neede I have of you, I could not live if you did not love me, but withall you could not love a man who is more passionately then I am,
                     
                        Sir,  
                        Your, &amp;c.

                     Another to him. LETTER XXXIIII.
                     SIR, my deare Cosin, I am exceeding glad to heare of your newes; as for newes of the world I set so little by them, and interest my selfe so little in generall affaires, that I may boldly say, I never yet read a whole Gazetta through; you may thinke this a strange distaste of the present time, and a remarkeable impatience, specially in a man who complaines that Livies History is too short, and wishes Herodotus would never make an end. Things that wounded me heretofore at the very heart, doe not now so much as superficially touch mee; that which I accounted as my owne is now become a stranger to me, and my heart is hardned against all accidents that happen, if they concerne not either my selfe or my friends. It is true the death of—wrought in mee some compassion; I can never hate men that are extraordinary, &amp; it grieves me that cowardice should triumph over vertue; and the lazie cause the valiant to bee murthered. For this man it would not serve to take him at table, it was necessary to come behinde him; for else the most resolute of the conspiratours would never have had the courage to doe the act, would never have a
                           •…
                        idden the splendor

of that terrible countenance, and would have thought he had alwayes heard this voyce.

                     If I should say more, I should seeme to make his Funerall Oration; I am neither fit nor officious enough to goe so farre, my designe was onely to write a word or two, and to pay you all your Compliments with this one little word, I am but most truly,

                     SIR, my deare Cousin, I meane not to shew your Letter to the Doctour that brought it to me, it would make him lose that little

humilitie that is left him, and he would thinke himselfe already In statu perfectionis acquisitae; you doe not well to use him as hee were some rare personage, it is the way to spoyle him altogether, and to harden a vanitie which durst not otherwise shew it selfe. I shall have something to doe to make him come to himselfe, and to take downe the swelling of his spirit, which your testimony hath put him into. It is an casier matter to corrupt then to reforme, the good workes more slowly then the evill; and I much feare my remedies will not bee so forcible as your poyson; Vnder this name austere Philosophers would comprise the Present you have sent me. They conceive that perfumes are made of sweete and pleasing poysons, and that if they make no impression upon the body, they yet effiminate the vigour of the minde: For my selfe I speake no such harsh Language, but content my selfe to say with an honester man then they; Cursod bee these Effaminate persons that have cryed downe so innocent and so good a thing. The use of it is lawfull, the excesse is forbidden; I know the first, and you would cast me upon the other. For to speake truly what good can come of so exorbitant a liberality? and what meanes this abundance of Orenge flower water with which you have loaded our messenger? If he had done any thing that pleased in the place where you are, you should not have imputed the greatest part of it to me, and it might have beene spoken without Hyperbole, and without putting mee

upon so high a straine. Your good deeds have no spice of the present povertie, one may see in them the abundance of the golden age, and an image of that happy time of which a Poet writes; They powred out by Floods what they received by Drop; yet you have done well to get before hand, hereafter the sumptuary lawes will not suffer you to be so liberall; and you are threatned with the comming forth of a Proclamation that will bring things backe to the antient frugality of our ancestours. Perfumes shall not be used but in Temples, and about the sacrifices at great festivalls, nor
                     but about the pallace or at the Kings Coronation, so that you shall learne the vertue of moderation by a lesson from the Prince, and you shall be made a good husband if you will but be a good subject. I my selfe who profit by disorder must tell you thus much, that if you reduce not your great bottles to little violls, I shall enforme against you, and yet will alwayes be,
                     
                        Sir,  
                        Your, &amp;c.

                     To Mounsieur Bardyn. LETTER XXXVI.
                     SIR, never was Host better payd then I, for making you poore Cheere; if you should make any long journey at this price, you would make your selfe a poore man before you come home, and your first courtesies are such, that they scarce leave any place for second. You are so good that you are unjust; to compare our fruits to those of Italy is not so much to advance our Village, as to vilifie Naples and Florence. This is to affront her whom Virgill adored, and to whom he sayd upon his knees and holding up his hands;
                     
                        Salve magna Parens fragum Saturnia tellus
                     
                     
                        Magna virum, &amp;c.
                     
                     There is no reason to pardon this excesse to a man that makes profession of the truth, and who ought to speake that plainely which it is lawfull for Poets to disguise. These fellowes make waste of their ornaments and their figures; they call the worst wine they drinke Nectar; and though the house of Cacus were no better then an Oxe stall, yet in their Verses it is made a Kings Pallace; such libertie is not allowed to Philosophers, and without derogation to this qualitie, which you have so good title to possesse, you could never have bestowaed your prayses upon such base Viands as I

was faine to set before you. And for my entertainement with which you seeme much better satisfied, even that was yet much poorer, &amp; more meager then my cheere. You know Sir that in our commerce I contribute nothing but my Dociblenes, &amp; my eares; I am the people &amp; you the Theater; I meane a Theater reasonable and intelligent, inspired with sentences and instructions, to whose spectacles I would run from one end of the world to another, and never complaine of my paines nor of my journey. I would not onely returne you your visit in Touraine; but to heare you; would doe much more, and goe much further, willingly untertake as long a voyage as Appollonius did, who traveiled many kingdomes, and passed many Seas, onely to see Iarchas in his Throane of gold, and heare him discoursing of the nature of things. Your Indian visage and your yellow colour make shew of a Gimnosophist; but Gimnosophists had not the vertue that lies hidden under this yellownesse; for though they made Trees to speake, and sent tempests on their errands, where they pleased, yet these were effects of their divellish arts, and no arguments of their wisedome. Yours is not onely more humane and more lawfull; but is used also with lesse pride and lesse violence. Instead of filling the eies with unprofitable wōders, it makes to flow and streame in the soule necessary verities; it doth not astonish mee with prodiges, nor affright me with Thunder, but it perswades me to doae that I ought to doe, and instructs mee

to know that I ought to know. It is the same I thinke that appeared under the Empire of Trajan; and communicated it selfe to men by the mediation of Plutarch. How have you decked her without disarming her? how sweetned her countenance without weakening her force? how covered her Bones and Muskes with a faire flesh, and made her a body of a Carkasse? The Syllogisme, which by the saying of a Grecian is the Trident and Mace of Philosophie, is in your writings all painted and perfumed: After you have purged it from the rust of Barbarians, and from the poyson of Sophisters, you make with it a wholesome and delightfull lancing, and no man seekes to ward your blowes, because they heale and tickle. With these rare knowledges you should entertaine your friends, and not with the fruits of our Orchard, nor with those of my studies, which are as vulgar the one as the other; But yet seeing they please your taste, and that you demand of mee particularly the last peece you saw of my making, I have intreated—who carries it to Paris to deliver it unto you in the place where you are; By your example I call it my dissertation, because wee live in a country of libertie, and where faults of this nature are not under the jurisdiction of the Kings commission. But I durst not be so bold at the Court, where there is no longer any favour for naughty words, nor safety for innovatours of our Language. Remember therefore that I speake under Benedicite,
                        
and in our most strait confidence; and imitate herein that Queene, who in publicke called her sonne by the name of her husband, but in private by the name of her favorite; much after this sort doe I; having conceived my worke from the acquaintance I have with the Latin; I let it in truth carry a French title, but in secret and speaking in the eare I give it the name of his father. It is now three moneths that M. de Nants hath beene in Britanie, and M. de Tholouze in Languedoc. Vpon the first opportunitie I will not faile to send them your rare Presents, and let them know in what heigth of account you hold them both. Do me the like office to Mounsieur Bourdelot, and assure him that I have great pretensions upon his learning, and that I ground my selfe much upon his honestie. Hereafter one of them shall bee my treasure in the necessities of my spirit, the other my Sanctuary against the malice of the world. For you Sir, it is impossible for mee to expresse the high opinion I conceive of you; when the question is to speake of your vertue, I cannot finde words that give mee satisfaction, and therefore at this time you shall have from me but the common conclusion of all my Letters, that I am,
                     
                        Sir,  
                        Your, &amp;c.

                     To Mounsieur de Aigue bere Commander of a Company in Holland. LETTER XXXVII.
                     SIR, your Letter hath staied here a long time for me; if I had beene here at its first arrivall, I had sooner testified to you the joy with which I received it: and the especiall account I make of the meanest of your favours. I seek not after new acquaintance; I had rather I could forgo one halfe of those I have already but for yours; I vow unto you I have much desired it, and you had attractives for me, even in the malancholy of my Quartaine Ague. I discovered a great worth under the veile of your disvaluing your selfe; and saw well, that you sought rather to goe safely and solidly, than to goe in pompe and state, and had more care to nourish your minde, than to set it out in colours. I doe not therefore take you for a simple Captaine of Holland, who talkes nothing but Stoccadoes; and Circumvallation; and studies such other words in that country, to come afterwards and fright us with them here in France, I know you possesse no lesse the vertues of peace, than those that make a noise and handle iron: and that you are a man of the Library, as well as of the Arsenall.

Mounsieur Huggens, I assure my selfe, is of the same minde; and I doubt not, but having observed you in both these kinds, hee rellisheth as well your spirit, as he values your courage. I am very glad of the correspondence that is betweene you; of which, if you please, I shall make use hereafter, for the safetie of our Commerce. But Sir, I have another, more important request to make unto you; and I earnestly entreate you to doe for me, with my Lord—: the good offices, which I have right to hope your goodnesse will affoord me. It hath beene written to me from Paris, that hee had some sinister conceit of me; and indeede the coldnesse of his countenance, the last time I had the honour to doe him reverence, seemed to shew as much. This misfortune comes not to me by any fault of mine: for I sweare unto you Sir, that I have alwayes carried towards him a most religious respect, and have never spoken of him, but as of a man of very extraordinary parts. It must needes be, that this is some rellicke of those impressions, which—hath left in him: and that he judgeth of me by the report of my enemies. I will not revenge my selfe upon the memory of a dead man; nor lay aspersion upon the passion of so great a Worthy; though there have beene some moved with motives lesse reasonable, that have wept for their Dogges; and built Tombes for beasts they loved. In that, I acknowledge the good fortune of—: but you know better than any other what his honesty was: and you

ought upon this occasion to give your uttermost testimony in behalfe of calumniated innocencie. I conjure you to doe it effectually: and from what coast soever the evill come, take into your protection an honest man, who passionately is,
                     
                        Sir,

                     SIR, I have received in one Packet, a Letter from you, of the foure and twentith of March; and another from Mounsieur Huggens of the fifteenth of December. I give you a thousand thankes for each of them; and complaine not, that I staid a while for the latter, seeing if it had come a readier way, it had perhaps not come so safe away: neither containes it any newes, wherof the knowledge might not be forborne without any danger: no matter in it, that either concernes the life of the Prince, or the good of the state. It might have come time enough, tonne yeares hence; for it speakes of nothing but of Kings and Commonwealths, that have beene long agoe. Our commerce hath

no object, but our Bookes; and I have no reason to complaine of a slownesse, that does a favour to my negligence. But my good neighbour,—suffers me to be idle no longer; she will have me hereafter make use of her messengers; and by consequent, ease you of your conveying them. Yet for my part, I exempt you not altogether, but if you returne into Holland, at the time you have appointed; you shall doe me a favour to remember the note I send you. I intreate you also to demand of our friends in that country, what reason they have to bring into our language a new fashion of speaking; and which by the communication you have with them, is gotten into the letter you sent me. If you say, my Masters the States; you may as well say, Mounsieur the Counsell; and Madam the Assembly: and more than this; if many Senatours that make the body of a republike, may be called, my Masters the States, then every Senatour, which makes a part of that body, may be called Mounsieur the State: and if this be suffered, the most strange opinions of—shall be authorised by publike use: of the same words will be made another language, and after this it cannot be thought strange, that—should speake of the Seigneury of Venice; as of the Infanta of Portugall; and that shee should marry with Mounsieur the Kings brother. It is true the League committed the like incongruitie when ita ve the Duke de Maine, the title of Lieutenant of the State, and crowne of France, but

this was not without a checke: you know what sport the Catholicon makes at it; and with what force hee defends at once, both the rights of the Kingdome, and the lawes of Grammar. And where the same Authour in another place, calls the Assembly, which was held at Paris; My Lords the States; he did that but to make it rediculous; and not with meaning to speake regularly: Our deare friends may make of a little citie, a great; but of a bad word they cannot make a good: and though their liberty extend very farre, yet it reacheth not to license Barbarisme. Mounsieur Huggens will consider of this point; and if in propounding to the Counsell so important a matter, he shall speede well; he shall have the honour to purge his coūtry of a vitious phrase, as much in the judgement of Grammarians, as to free it from a Hidra, or Chymaera, and therein shall shew himselfe a Hercules, or a Bellerophon. This is a way I take with my friends, to make my selfe laugh; because I am given to pensivenesse, when I am alone; and I cannot stirre up any joy in me, but by the presence, at least the representation of some person, which is both deere unto me, and chosen for the nonce: of this number Sir, you are, and know well, that I am,
                     
                        Sir,  
                        Your, &amp;c.

                     To Mounsieur de Bois Robert. LETTER XXXIX.
                     SIR, in the meane time, till I see you; be pleased to receive from mee a compliment, which shall not be tedious: Onely to let mee congratulate with you the recovery of your health. God hath now a kinde of interest in preserving it; seeing you have consecrated it to him; and your life is vowed to a perpetuall meditation of his Mysteries. I doubt not of his blessing this your holy desire; and looke at my returne to finde a great Preacher under your Cassocke. You will shew me as many Homilies, as heretofore you have shewed me Sonnets: and instead of Parnassus and Permessa; you will speake of Sion, and of Siloe. Yet moderate your selfe a little at first: and be reserved in a strange Country. I would not have you dive too deepe into the Abysses of Predestination; famous for the shipwrackes of so many Pilots; or to speake more plainely, for the heresies of so many Doctours. If you will take my counsell, you shall let the Iesuites and the Iacobins fight it out betweene themselves about the Question De Auxilijs; and never meddle amongst them, nor goe about to part them. The often using of Syllogismes is very dangerous for health; there is nothing that heates the bloud, or enflame's choler more than Disputation.

Besides, though you make your selfe hoarse with speaking for the Truth, and make it never so plaine: yet you shall never make your adversary to confesse it; or ever be able to take hold of him, so long as he can slip from you by a distinction. Above all Sir, let not the love of Divinity make you forget your temporall affaires, and the care of your fortune: for otherwise, It were better, I should study with you to halfes; and that you should make the Court both for your selfe and me. As I am like to acquit my selfe extreme badly; so you are likely to grow soone to perfection; and I despaire not, one of these dayes to salute you by the Title, Of Most Reverend Father in God. I know you doe not dislike that wee should write to one another in this kind of stile, which Cicero and Trebatius made use of, before such time as untoward compliments had corrupted friendship; and that this base jangling was brought into fashion. This Trebatius was a famous Lawyer: of whom Cicero made great account; and yet is alwayes wrangling with him about his Science, and his formall writs: the like liberty I am bold to take with you; whom I honour infinitely; and should not in this sort contribute to our common joy, if I were not with a perfect freenesse of heart,
                     
                        Sir,  
                        Your, &amp;c.

                     SIR, I pitty your good fortune, the court that followes you at your Chamber would be to me an unsupportable honour, who would not give my mornings for all the Compliments of Paris. It is the flower and prime of the day that is taken from you; it is the time of meditation and Prayer which flattery intruds upon. There is no Creditour nor Sergeant that you might not deale withall better cheape then with these troublesome friends. You are unfortunate to be so beloved, and a man of whom so many other have use, can be of little or no use to himselfe. It is better yet to passe for a clowne, then thus to prostitute ones selfe by civilitie, and better never to sacrifice to the graces, then to make ones selfe the beast for the Sacrifice. You would perhaps intermit this course, but the time is past for that; a breach would draw upon you a warre; and you would runne the fortune of that poore Saint, who was murthered with pricks of Penknives, and cut in peeces by his Schollers. You would be the object of a Rhetoricall, an Historicall &amp; a Poeticall persecution; and the muses which now court you would grow furies, and fall a tearing you, so that you have no remedy now but to hold it out, if you looke for safety

in the place you are in, you must ever bee the mediatour betweene Apollo and Poets; you must alwayes have a thousand businesses both in Prose and Verse, your chamber must be the passage alwayes from the Vniversitie to the Court. This backe doore whereof you have sent mee a Platforme, is in truth an excellent invention, but this will presently bee discovered, and you will gaine nothing by it, but to be beseiged in more places at once. Doe better Sir, quit the place that is not tenable, and come save your selfe at———I am not so poore, but I can make you a reasemblance at least of the good cheere of Paris, and furnish you with innocent pleasures, such as Philososophie and Priesthood will allow of; It shall be for as short a time as you please; and onely to make an ill custome take another course. All the family desires this voyage, particularly——who is in good hope his sonne cannot prove ill, seeing you have no ill opinion of him, and for his daughter of whom you write mee so much good: I cannot stay my selfe from vowing to you, that shee is not altogether unworthy of it; and perhaps would have deserved an Ayre with three couplets of your making, if shee had appeared in the time when you were the great Chaunter of France. But now that you have changed your course of life, there is no looking for any thing from you but spirituall discourse and Christian meditations, which yet will serve as fitly for a Sex to which devotion belongs no lesse then

beauty. Bring therefore to us the Originall of your Pietie and of your Divinitie, at least shew some sorrow that you cannot doe it, that I may see my affection is not scorned, and that I am not without revenge,
                     
                        Sir,  
                        Your, &amp;c.

                     Another to him. LETTER XLI.
                     SIR, if you hold your old wont, you will tax me with ignorance, and write mee a man of another world; one delivered me but yesternight observations upon the processe of the Marshall of——and I set my selfe to reading all the time my groome set himselfe to sleeping. In very truth they gave me a
                           •…
                         excellent rellish; &amp; I vow unto you I never read a stile more subtile, nor that hid its Art more cunningly; I entreat you to send me word who the Author is, and to whom I am beholding for so pleasing a night. It must needs be some man who understands two things equally well, affaires and how to write, one that partakes of the life of a schollar, and of a Courtier; like to that God of whom the Poets say, he is of the one and other world, Utroque facit commercia

mundo. From the knowledge of Bookes, he drawes the vigour and force of his phrase, and from the practise of the Court; the colours and sweetning of his matter. Hee speakes the language of the Closet, and brings proofes of the Pallace; but in such sort, that neatenesse doth not weaken his Reasons; and his force is so tempered; that even Ladies may be judges of the processe. Once againe, I entreate you to send me the name of this sage Observer, and besides, to give me account what grace I stand in with Mounsieur de—: I was told in no very good grace; neither I, nor my writings neither. If I made but little reckoning of him; I should easily comfort my selfe, for this disgrace: but in truth, it would grieve me much to be condemned by a judgement, to which I should make a conscience not to subscribe; and I rather beleeve, there are many defects in my Writings; then that in his taste there is any defect of Reason. Assure him Sir, if you please, that I am at least capable of discipline: and am 
                           •…
                        pt enough to follow any method he shall prescribe me, for attaining a proportion of knowledge to content him. Let him but tell me my faults, and see how quickly I will mend them; let him but say, what it is in my stile that offends him; and see, how ready I shall be to give him satisfaction. If my Hyperboles displease him; I will blot them out of my Letters the next time they are Printed; I will truely confesse, all I have ever used, and make a sollemne vow never to use more. Yet it cannot

be truely said; that to use this Figure; is a matter that deserves blame; for, not to speake of humane Authours, wee should then blame the Sonne of God; for saying, It is easier for a Cammeil to goe through a needles eye, then for a rich man to enter into the kingdome of heaven. But I will not seeke to save my selfe by so supreme an authority: In this, I will respect our Saviour, but not follow him; I will beleeve that such examples are farre above all humane imitation; and will not attempt it no more then to walke upon the water, and to goe forty dayes without eating. In good earnest, I would doe any thing to give contentment to a man; that gives contentment to M. the Cardinall; and hath perswaded the King of Sweden, If hee will play the tyrant with those that seeke his favour, let him; I refuse not hence forward the hardest conditions he can lay upon me; and to gains his protection; I renounce with all my heart my very liberty: It is now foure and twentie houres, since I laid my eyes together; It is time therefore that I bidde you good morrow, or good night; take which of them you please; and beleeve me alwayes,

                     To Mounsieur the Master Advocate in the Parliament. LETTER XLII.
                     SIR, you know I have fed upon the fruits of Pomponne, even beyond the rules of temperance; and I have signified to you in each place where they grew, that they are generally excellent; yet I now specially declare my selfe, in favour of the last you sent mee, and finde them, farre surpassing the Amber Peare, or all other kindes, which I cannot name. It is true, I affect specially the Tree it selfe that beares them: and I account the meanest of the leaves, no meaner than jewels: yet their owne goodnesse is such, that though they grew in the garden of—: or grew upon a stocke that Father—: had planted; yet I should not for all that, but highly esteeme them, and take a pleasure in their taste. In a word, to leave speaking in Allegory, and not to flounder my selfe in a Figure, into which you have most maliciously cast me: I say Sir, that in all your Presents, I see nothing but excellent; and least you should thinke, I meant to exempt my selfe from giving a particular account of my judgement, by speaking in generall termes: I let you know, that in the first place, the two lives spoken of at the end of the discourse, please me infinitely; and next to this that place which is

written upon occasion of—: that France is too good a Mother to rejoyce in the losse of her children; and that the victories gotten upon our selves, are fit to weare mourning, and be covered with blacke vailes. All that cuold have beene said upon this Argument, would never have beene comparable to this ingenious silence. And as he hath dexterously shunned a passage so tender, so he enters as bravely, and as proudly upon a matter that will beare it; when speaking of—: hee saith, that having overcome the waves &amp; the winds, that opposed his passage, &amp; traversed the fires of so many canons of the enemies; with a few poore Barkes, hee made his way thorough a Forrest of great shippes. And a little after; where hee saith: that God, who bestowes his favours upon Nations, by measure; seeing, that the admirable valour of ours, would easily conquer the whole world; if it had Prudence equall to its courage, seemes therefore to have given us, as a counterpoise to the greatnesse of our spirits; a kinde of impetuositie and impatience, which to our Armies have oftentimes beene fatall, and cause of ruine. But that now the case is altered in this point: for now the French are no longer French, then they are valiant: now these Lyons are growne reasonable; and now, to the strength and courage of the North; they joyne the prudence and staiednesse of the South, &amp;c. Also where hee saith, that the carriage at Cazal, is a thing incomprehensible; and for which we must be faine to looke out some new name;

for it cannot be called a Seige, seeing the place was surrendred before ever it was battered: nor it cannot be called a Battell, seeing no man strooke a stroake: nor it cannot be called a treatie seeing treaties are not made with weapons in hand, &amp;c. But that which pleaseth mee most of all, because it toucheth indeede the string of my owne inclination; is that which he speakes of the Marquesse of Rambovillet: that there had beene Statues erected in honour of her vertue; if she had fortuned to be borne in the beginning of her race. For, as you know Sir, this illustrious woman, is of Romane stocke; Et de Gente Sabella; of which Virgil speakes. These are the passages I can call to minde, having not the Originalls by me: being taken from me, by a neighbouring Lady; who affects the King of Sweden with the like passion, as Madame Rambovillet: so elevated a spirit may chastly enough be loved of both sexes; and let the slanderous History speake its pleasure; I for my part thinke no otherwise of it, then as the Queene of Sheba loved Salomon: and as Nicomedes loved Caesar. I had begunne something for the triumph of this great Prince, but his death made my Penne fall out of my hand; and therefore you are like to have nothing from me at this time; in revenge of your Sonnet. For your French Prose, I send you another, which I will never beleeve to be Latin, untill—shall assure you, it is; to whom I entreate you to shew it from me: Vir plane cum Antiquitate conferendus,

&amp; qui mihi est in hoc genere, vnus curia, Censor &amp; Quirites. I have read many things of his with infinite satisfaction: but I know, hee hath certaine mysteries in his Writing, which he lets not common people know; and—hath told me of a continuation hee hath written, of the History of M. de Thou; which is not imparted but to his speciall friends; and which, I am infinitely desirous to see: but I am not a man that will enter by force upon any mans secrets: and my discretion in such cases, shall be alwayes graeter, then my curiositie, Opture licebit, si potiri non licet, If I should not presently: make an end of my Letter, I should kill you with Latine; for I find my selfe in an humour that way; and in this desert where I live: I have no commerce, but with such as speake all Latin, I would perswade you to revive them in our language; by an imitation which you are able to doe, not much unlike those great examples; I meane of Cicero, of Salust, and of Livie; not of Cassiodore, or Ennodius Ticinensis, or Sidonius Apollinuris. They that love this impuritie of stile, are in a ficker state, then they that love to eate coales and ashes. Farre be it from us, to have such disordered appetites, and let us never be so foolish, to preferre the corruption and decay of things, before their prime, and their maturitie, I am,

                     SIR, Hee that delivers you this Letter, knowes as much of my newes as I my selfe, and will make you ample relation of all that hath passed at—: He hath a businesse in the Parliament, which is of no great difficulty; and which may be spedde without any great Eloquence: yet I addresse it to you, but upon condition, that you shall not imploy your whole force about it; but that your labouring for him may be a refreshing to you, from some other labour. I heare with a great deale of pleasure, of the progresse of your reputation, and of the effects of my prefages. The acclamations you cause in the Pallace, are sounding in all places; and wee are not so out of the world, but that the Eccho of them comes to us. But Sir, I content not my selfe with clapping of hands, and praising your well-speaking, as others doe; I desire to have some particular ground, for which to give you thankes, and am willing to be in your debt, for compliment and reverence; this shall be, when you have spedde my friends suite: and which shall be a cause, if you please, that I will now at the end of my Letter, adde a superlative; and say I am;
                     
                        Sir,

                     SIR, I make no secret of our friendship, it is too honest to be hidden; and I am so proud of it, that I thinke my selfe of no worth but by it. Mounsieur Iamyn, acknowledgeth my good fortune herein, and is himselfe in passion to get your acquaintance, to which hee perswades himselfe; I should not be his worst introductor; and that by my meanes he might be admitted to your studies. I will make my selfe beleeve, that he mistakes me not; and that for my sake, you will adde to your accustomed courtesies a little extraordinarie. They who saw Pericles, how he thundred and lightened in the publike Assemblies, were desirous to heare him in a quieter estate; to know whether his Calme were as sweete and pleasing as his Tempest. This man hath the like desire; and though my recommendation, were as indifferent to you, as it is deere; yet so honest a curiositie would deserve to be respected. Hee is the sonne of one of my best friends, and though perhappes you know it not, you are the example that Fathers propose for imitation to their children; and by whose name they excite to vertue all their youth. I neede not say more to you of this; onely be mindefull of our resolute and undaunted Maximes; and in this

age of malice; doe not scorne the praise I give you for your goodnesse. I kisse the hands of all your reloquent family, and am,

                     To Mounsieur de Caupeau ville Abbot of Uictory. LETTER XLV.
                     SIR, the time which my malady permits me, I bestow upon you, and make use of the respite of my sits, to tell you, I have received your last Letters, and the new assurances of your friendshippe; which is so much the dearer unto me, because I know you use them with discretion; and that there be not many things you greatly affect. This makes for my glory, that I can please so dainty a taste; and that I can get good from one that is so covetous. It is no small matter to draw a wise man out of himselfe; and to make Philosophie compassionate of others evills. Although the place, to which she hath raised you cannot be more eminent, nor more sure; yet my disgraces may because that her prospect is not so faire or pleasant:

and how setled soever the peace of your minde be, yet the Object of a persecuted friend, may perhaps offend your eyes. Our Mounsieur Berville, I assure my selfe, dislikes not this kinde of wisedome: he likes to have that husbanded &amp; dressed, which Zeno would have to be rooted out; hee knowes that magnanimity hath its residence betweene effeminatenesse and crueltie; and that the sweete and humane vertues, have place betweene the Fierce and the Heroioke. Poets sometimes make the Demy Gods to weepe; and if an old womans death were cause enough to make Aeneas shed teares; the oppression of one innocent, cannot be unworthy of your sighes. Yet I require from you, none of these sadde offices: your onely countenance is enough to give me comfort. I doe not live, but in the hope I have to see it, and to get you to sweare once againe, in presence of the faire Agnes, and the rest of your chamber Divinities, that you love me still. After that, if you will have us make a voyage in your Abby, I shall easily cōdiscend: Provided Sir, that you promise me safety amongst your Monkes: and that they be none of those, that are angry at good language, and have no talke, but of Analysis and Cacozoale. If you have any that be of this humour, you are an unfortunate Abbot; and you may make account to be never without suites. First, they will aske you a double allowance: next they will question your Revenew; and if you chance by ill happe to make a Booke, you are sure to be presently cited before the Inquisition;

or at least before the Sorbonne. God keepe you Sir from such Friers, and send you such as I am, who eate but once a day; and who will not open my mouth; unlesse it be to praise your good words, and to tell you sometimes, out of the abundance of my heart, that I am,
                     
                        Sir,  
                        Your, &amp;c.

                     To————LETTER XLVI.
                     SIR, I am able to live no longer, if you be resolved to love me no longer; and thinke not that the good you promise mee, can countervaile the losse of that you take from me. Keepe your estimation and your bountie, for those that have nothing in them but Vanitie and Avarice: I am endowed from heaven with better and more noble passions; I like better to continue in my povertie, then in your disgrace; and will none of this cold speculative estimation, which is but a meere device of Reason; and a part of the Law of Nations, if you give it me single, and nothing else with it. I must tell you, I thinke my selfe worthy of something more; and that the Letter I write to

you, was worthy of a sweeter answer then you sent me. If therein I said any thing that gave you distaste, I call that God to witnesse, by whom you sweare; I then wandred farre from my intention. I meant to containe my complaints within so just bounds; that you should not finde the least cause to take offence. But I see I have beene an ill interpreter of my selfe, and my rudenesse hath done wrong to my innocencie: yet any man but your selfe, would I doubt not have borne with a friend in passion, and not so unkindly have returned choler for sorrow. As for my pettish humour, it is quickly over, and there is not a shorter violence, than that of my spirit: whereas you have taken sixe whole weekes to disgest your indignation, and in the end come and tell me, you would doe me any good you can, upon condition to love mee no longer. I vow unto you, it is a glorious act to doe good to all the world, and to make even ungratefull men beholding. But Sir, if you thinke me one, to whom you may give that name; you doe me exceedingly much more wrong, then it is in your power to doe mee right: Neque decorum sapienti, unde amico infamiam parat, inde sibi gloriam quaerere. I am wounded at the very heart, with this you have written; but since you will not suffer mee to complaine; I must be faine to suffer and say nothing; onely I will content my selfe, to make a declaration contrary to yours; and tell you, I will never make you beholding to mee, because I am not happy enough to be able to

doe it; but yet I will love you alwayes, and will alwayes perfectly be,
                     
                        Sir,  
                        Your, &amp;c.
                        
                           At Balzac, 1. March, 1633.
                        
                     
                  
                  
                     To Mounsieur Trovillier, Physitian of the Popes house. LETTER XLVII.
                     SIR, having alwaies made speciall reckoning of your friendship; it is a great satisfaction to me, that I receive assurance of it, by your Letter. I doubt not of your compassionating my disgraces; and that the persecution raised against me, hath touched you at least with some sence of griefe; for even meere strangers to me, did me these good offices; and though the justice of my cause, had not in it selfe beene worthy of respect: yet the violence of my adversaries, was enough to procure me favour and protectours. There is no man of any generous spirit, that found not fault with the bravadoes of your Philarchus: nor a man of any wisedome, that thought him not a Sophister. Yet I cannot blame you for loving him: seeing I know well, you doe it not to prejudice mee, that your affection corrupts not your judgement. You are too intelligent, to be deceived with petty subtilties; and too strong, to be broken with engins of Glasse; but in truth, being as you are, a necessary friend, to a number of persons of different qualities; it cannot be, but you

must needes have friends of all prices, and of all merit, and that the unjust as well as the innocent are beholding to you. You shall heare by Mounsieur—, when hee comes to Rome, the little credit I have with the man you spake to me of, to whom I present my service, but onely once a yeare; and that I doe too, least I should forget my name, and mistake my person. If in any other matter which is absolutely in my owne power; you will doe me the honour to employ me; you shall see my course is not to use excuses and colours; but that I truly am,
                     
                        Sir,  
                        Your, &amp;c.
                        
                           At Paris 4. April 1631.
                        
                     
                  
                  
                     To Mounsieur Gerard, Secretary to my Lord the Duke D'Espernon. LETTER XLIX.
                     SIR, you cannot complaine, nor be in miserie by your selfe alone: I partake of all your good and evill, and feele so lively a reflection of them, that there needes but one blow to make two wounds. And thus I am wounded by the newes you write, and though your griefe be not altogether just, yet it is sufficient to make me partake with you, that it is yours. We weepe for one not onely whom we knew not, but whom we know to be happy: one that in sixe weekes staying in the world hath gained that, which St. Anthonie was afraid to lose after threescore yeares pennance in the

Wildernesse. I wish, I could have had the like favour; and have died at the time, when I was innocent: being my selfe, neither valiant nor ambitious: I account those warres the best that are the shortest; and that, though in Paradise there be divers degrees; and diverse mansions; yet there is not any that is not excellent good. Observe onely your goodly making of Saints, and you shall finde of all sorts; I meane of the one, and the other sexe: Religious and Seculars, Gascoignes, and French. You know well. I have appointed you here a chamber; and that you are my debtor of a visite, now a whole yeare, if you be a man of your word; but I feare me you are not, and that as your custome is, you will content your selfe with praising my quiet course of life; yet I would have you to flatter at least my spirit, though it be, but with some light hope of so perfit a contentment: promise me you will come, and make me happy; though you breake your promise, I shall enjoy at least, so much of good; and in doing so, you shal amuse me, though you do not satisfie me. I send you all I have of that admirable Incognito; of whom there is so much talke, and who hath made himself famous now these three yeares, under the name of Petrus Aurelius: I cannot for my life find who he is. Mounsieur de Filsac, told me lately at Paris, that of him that brought the leaves to Printing, hee could not possibly learne any more than this, that he was a man, who desires to serve God invisibly. And in truth, if you knew, in what sort he carries his secrecie; and with what care

and cunning he hides himselfe; you would confesse he takes more paines to shunne reputation, then ambitious men take in running after it. Farre from being a Plagiary, to robbe others of their glory, who refuseth that which is his own, and suffers a Phantasme, to receive those acclamations and praises which belong to himselfe. This is no man of the common mould; even in the judgement of his adversaries; and his writings savour not the compositions of his age. They are animated with the spirit and vigour of the former times; and represent us a Church we never saw. Yet it seemes in some passages, he hath lesse of Saint Austins sweetnesse than of St. Hieroms choler; and that he is willinger to doe that, which justice onely permits him, then that which charitie counsells him. I could wish he had shewed a little more respect to the gray haires, and rare merit of Father Sirmond; or rather that hee would have laid aside his Armes, and dealt with him in a gentler warre. But there is no meanes to bridle a provoked valour, nor to guide a great force, though with a great moderation. All Saints are not of one temper; it is enough for Religion to cut off vices; and to purifie the passions. Our morall Divinitie acknowledgeth some innocent cholers: and it is the beauty of Christs flocke, that there be Lyons amongst the Sheepe, and that as well the sublimest and strongest spirits as the basest and sweetest submit and prostrate themselves to the greatnesse of Christianitie. If I had learned nothing in his booke but onely to know what respect men owe to a Character

reverenced of the Angells, I had not lost my time in reading him. If Bishops be of such eminent authoritie: shall we make any difficultie, to call a Prelate, My Lord; and esteeme him lesse than a Grande of Spaine, or then an Earle of England? You will tell me more of this, at your next meeting; and I doubt not, setting aside the interest of——: send it mee backe when you have read it; and forget not the Chapters of honest Bernia. I am more than I am able to expresse,
                     
                        Sir,  
                        Your, &amp;c.
                        
                           At Balzac 15. Octo. 1634.
                        
                     
                  
                  
                     To my Lord the Bishop of Nants. LETTER LI.
                     SIR, I am now growne shamelesse, and make no longer any conscience to be trouble some to you. Yet hold on your course of goodnesse: which hath from the very first beene so ready to me, and freely makes me offer of that, for which it ought to make me be a suitor. I send you now foure leaves for Ruell, and if you please to let three of your owne lines beare them company, I doubt not but they will have a happy arrivall, and that the skiffe will procure passage for the great vessell. But because Fortune her selfe, hath done one halfe of my discourse, and that I have little commerce with any but Latines borne, I humbly entreate you my Lord, to be so good, when I am fallen to helpe me to rise, and not suffer me to goe astray, in a Country, where you are Prince. I know you love your owne elections, with more then naturall tendernesse, and that

you respect me, as none of the least of your Creatures. This is a cause, why to keepe me in your favour, and to ingage you in my interests, I will not tell you to your face, that you are the Chrysostome of our Church, that you are privy to the most secret intentions of Saint Paul, That there is neither Iew nor Gentile, that hearing you speake of the greatnesse and Dignity of Christianity, doth not willingly submit himselfe to follow Christ, I will onely say, it hath beene your will to be my Father, and that I am,
                     
                        My Lord, 
                        Your, &amp;c.

                     Another to him. LETTER LII.
                     SIR, you have a right to all occasions of doing good. I see not therefore, how I can forbeare to offer you one, and to the end, you may alwaies be meriting of thankes, why I should not alwaies be craving new courtesies. The bearer of this Letter is my neere Kinsman, yet our friendship is neerer, then our alliance, and the knot which Nature made, Vertue hath tyed. I humbly entreate your Lordship, to let him see you slight not things, whereof I make such reckoning, and to doe that for my sake, which you would much willinger doe for his owne sake, if he were knowne unto you. He is a man of mettall and spirit; and hath served the King in this Province, having also had the

honour, to be in person before him in very famous actions. At this time, he is troubled against all right and reason, and they that have drawne him, from the exercise of his charge, to make a walke to Paris, have nothing to say, but that they doe it of purpose to vex him. And therefore their manner of fight with him, is by flights and retreates, and they cast so many bones of difficulty, betweene his Iudges and him, that it is impossible they should ever come to any issue. They are not able to hinder his justification at last; but they are able to delay, and keepe him off a long time. You Sir, may save him this long journey, and may breake this Project of Calumny, if you please but to facilitate the overture, he will propose unto you, obtaining for him of—only one quarter of an houres audience. I assure my selfe, he will not be loath to heare him, being able to informe him of the state of things in these parts; and which he will doe faithfully. You shall therefore my Lord, infinitely oblige him, to take him into your protection, and you may be pleased to remember, that it is your deere sonne, that makes this request unto you, one whom in the extasie of your Fatherly affection, you have sometimes called your glory; and the ornament of this Age, who yet accounts no quality he hath so glorious as that which he will never part with, whilst he lives; to be
                     
                        My Lord,

                        SIR, being not able to bring you this untoward Present my selfe, I humbly entreat you to excuse mee that I send it. Wherein I bind you not to a second perusall, and to read that againe, which perhaps you have read already with distast. It is true Sir, that something is altered in the Copie, and well neere one halfe added to the originall; but the spight is, that base wares get no value by store, and the water that comes from the same Spring, can never be much differing: but if in any of the passages, I have not altogether come off ill, and that I have had some tolerable conceits, I acknowledge Sir, that I have had it all from the good education I had with you; and that it is the fruit of those Instructions, which you have done me the honour to impart unto me. For, no man ever had conceits

more pure, more pregnant, than your selfe; no man ever saw things more cleerly than you doe; you can tell precisely in what degree of good and evill any thing stands; and to find out the truth, there needs no more, but to follow your opinion. But to speake truly, I feare this qualitie in you, no lesse than I esteeme it; you have too much knowledge in you for a Discourse that requires simplicitie in the Reader. Neither am I so unadvised, to expose it to the severitie of your judgement, I submit it rather to the protection of your goodnesse, and hope you will not lay open those faults, which none but your selfe can see: Humbly entreating you to protect a spirit of your owne making; and not so much to consider my manner of expressing, as the affection with which I am
                     
                        Sir,  
                        Your, &amp;c.
                     
                  
                  
                     To the same as before. LETTER II.
                     SIR, I am negligent, for feare of being troublesome, and least I should be importunately complementall; I forbeare to shew my selfe officiously dutifull. But my fault growing from

discretion, I hope you will not take it ill, that I have a care not to trouble you, and that you will pardon the intermission of my Letters, which hath no other end, but the solacing your eyes. I seeke no colours of Art, to paint out the affection I owe to your service; This were to corrupt the naturall puritie. Truth is simple and shamefast, and when shee cannot shew her selfe by reall effects, shee will scorne to doe it by verball expressions. It is not in my tongue to expresse her otherwise, than in such termes as are the engagements of a lye; and when I shall have made you most sincere protestations of inviolable fidelitie, there will come a coozening companion that will out-vie me, and endeare himselfe beyond all my oathes. I could wish there were some marke to distinguish protestations that are true, from those that are feigned; for if there were, I should have great advantage over many Courtiers, more officious and more hot in offering their service, than I am, and you should acknowledge that the eminency of your vertue, not to speake of the eminency of your dignitie, is of no man more religiously reverenced, than of my selfe, who am, and ever will be
                     
                        Sir,  
                        Your, &amp;c.
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     To Monsieur Godeau. LETTER III.
                     SIR, Disguising will not serve your turne, you are a remarkable man, and whether it be that you call the dissembling of Art, Negligence, or that you cannot put off those ornaments which are naturall in you; I let you know that the excellency of your style, extends even to your familiar speech, and that you are able to sweeten it without sawcing it. A man may see that come springing &amp; flowing from you, which in others is brought 
                           •…
                        farre off, and that with engines; you gather that which others pull off, and though you write nothing loosly, yet you write nothing with streyning: yet I must tell you, they are not the periods of your sentences, nor the pawses that winne mee so much unto you; I am too grosse for such slender and fine threads; if you had nothing but rich conceits and choice words, this were but the vertue of a Sophister, and I should place you in the number of things that may please but not of things that one ought to love; I make more reckoning of the honesty of a dumbe man, than of the eloquence of a varlet; I looke after the good of societie, and the comfort of life, &amp; not after the delight of Theaters, and the amusement of company: Let us make then a serious profession of our duties, and let us give good examples to an evill

age; let us make the world see, that the knowledge wee have of vertue, is not meerly speculative; and let us justifie our Bookes and our Studies, that now are charged with the vices and imperfections of their Teachers. Philosophy is not made to be playd withall, but to be made use of, and we must count it an Armour, and not a painted Coate. They are men of the worst making, that now adayes make the worst doing; sots take upon them to be subtle, and wee have no more any tame Beasts amongst us, they are all savage and wilde. For my selfe, who have seene wickednesse in its Triumph, and who have sometime lived in the Countrey of subtlety &amp; craft; I assure you, I have brought nothing from thence, but loathing, and before ever I tasted it, was cloyed. I am exceeding glad to find you of the same dyet, and doubt not of the Doctrine I Preach, seeing I read the same in your owne Letter; Beleeve it Sir, there is none more wholesome, none more worthy of our Creation. Which I am resolved to maintaine, even to Death, and will no more leave it, than the resolution I have made, to be without ceasing;
                     
                        Sir,  
                        Your, &amp;c.
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     To Monsieur Godeau againe. LETTER IIII.
                     SIR, I have knowne a good while, that you are no longer a Druyde, and that you lately made your entry into Paris: I doubt not but with magnificence enough, and not without bestowing some publike largesse. I never knew you goe a forraging, that you returned not home laden with bootie; and your Voyages have alwayes enriched your followers. I pretend my selfe to have a feeling of this, and though farre remooved from the place where you act them, yet I cannot learne, that my absence makes me loose my part in the distribution of your good deedes. Cease not Sir, I entreat you, to bind me unto you, and to deserve well of my tongue. Fill our Closets with the fruits of your braine, and since you can doe it, make us to gather more sheaves of Corne, than the best workmen hitherto have left us eares. My devotion stands waiting continually for your Christian workes, and I entreat you, they may be done in such a volume, that we may carry them handsomely with us to Church. That which I have seene of them, doth so exceedingly please mee, that I would be a Poet for nothing else but withsome indifferent grace to prayse them, and to say,
                     
                        Verses blesse him that makes such blessed Verses.
                     
                     
                        
If I did not love you well, I should envie you the conversation of Monsieur Chaplaine, from whom in fifteene dayes I have received but one small sparke of a Letter by the ordinary Post. Thus I doe but tast of that whereof you make full meales; yet remember, I have as good right in him as your selfe, and though I trust you with the keeping him, yet I doe not quit my part in him; To him and you both, I am most affectionately
                     
                        Your, &amp;c.
                     
                  
                  
                     To Monsieur Conrat. LETTER V.
                     SIR, I had undertaken to have answered to every point of your eloquent Letter, but when I had spent a whole moneth about it, I could not satisfie my selfe with my undertaking. That which I had written, was not worthy, me thought, that I should Father it; and I began to thinke I should doe you a great courtesie, to save you the reading of an ill Oration. But seeing of evills, the least are the best, you shall have cause to thanke your selfe for this complement, which will cost you no more but one looke to looke over, and never put you to the labour of turning over the leafe. I have this onely to say at this time, that the report which was spread of my death, hath not killed me, and

that in despight of rumour and mortall Presages, I intend to be happy by your meanes, and not to forgoe the good fortune presented to me in your person: so I call your excellent friendship, with which no burden is heavie, no calamitie dolorous. For I know I shall finde in you that ancient generousnesse, whereof Monsieur de la Nove, and Monsieur de Ferries, made profession. I account when I discover secrets to you, I hide them; and shall have no jealousie of my honour when I have put it into your hands. In such sort Sir, that my soule should be of a very hard temper, if it did not feele a kind of tickling in so present and great advantages, and if I should not most perfectly be, as you oblige me to be,
                     
                        Your, &amp;c.
                     
                  
                  
                     To my Lord the Bishop of Nantes. LETTER VI.
                     SIR, I was upon the point of sending my footman to you, when I saw your footman enter my lodging, who brought me newes exceeding joyfull; and now I depend no longer upon Fortune, since another besides her selfe can make me happie; and am so indeed as much as I would wish, and should never know the value of your friendship, if I made it not the bounds of my ambition. To complaine of fortune,

and to be your favourite, are things that imply a morall contradiction: it is an easie-matter to comfort a pension ill payd, when a man is in possession of store of treasure, and having neither the gift of impudency, nor of hypocrisie, it is not for me to prosper in an age which esteemes them most that are owners of these qualities. It is enough for me, that M. the Cardinall doth me the honour to wish me well, and condemnes not your judgement of mee; all other disgraces, from whence soever they come, I am prepared to beare, and take for a favour the contempt that is linked to the profession of vertue. But it is too much to say of mee, that which Seneca said of Cato: Catonem saeculum suum parùm intellexit. These are transcendencies of M. de Nantes, and impostures of his love. He stretcheth all objects to infinitie, and all his comparisons are beyond proportion. The Sunne and the Starres are common things with him, and he can finde nothing in Nature goodly enough to serve for a similitude of that he loves. It is this deceitfull passion hath made you beleeve, that I am of some great worth, and that my barren soyle is fruitfull in high conceits. But Sir, I count all this nothing, if this love of yours perswade you not to come &amp; stay a while in it, and to be mindfull of your word. I have put Monsieur—in hope hereof, and make my selfe sure since you have made me a solemne promise; knowing that Truth is residentupon the mouth of Bishops.

                     The Authour of these Verses shall be your fourth suppliant: it is one that hath been of your olde acquaintance, and was accounted the Virgill of his time. I make use of him upon this occasion, because perhaps you will make more reckoning of him than of me, who yet am more than any man in the world.

                     Another to my Lord Bishop of Nantes. LETTER VII.
                     SIR, I speake Latin but once a yeare, and yet as seldome as it is, it comes more upon hazard than out of knowledge, and holds lesse of learning than of rapture: vouchsafe therefore to take it in good part, that in my setled braines, I answer you in the vulgar tongue, and tell you, that never eares were more attentive, nor more prepard to hearing, than those of our family when I read your Letter before them: they were not satisfied to have onely a literall interpretation, and to make me their Gramma
                        
                           •…
                        ian, but I must declaime upon it, and make a

Paraphrase as large as a Commentary. If you will know the successe, I can truly say, that all the company was well satisfied; but to tell you all, was even ravished with admiration of your bountie, specially my Niece, who in the greatest vanitie, that sexe is capable of, never durst imagine shee should ever have the honour to be praysed in Latin, and should serve for an Argument of commendation to the greatest Doctor of our age. Shee saith, this is a second obligation you bind her in, to make her a Romane after you have made her your daughter; and to give her so noble a Country, after giving her so worthy a Father. And yet to these two favours, I can adde a third, which shee forgot: methinkes Sir, shee fattens and grows gracefull with these prayses you give her; shee is fayrer by one halfe than shee was before. And if from vertue there issue certaine beames which enlighten the objects that are neere it; and that beautie flowes from goodnesse, as from the Spring, I need not then goe farre to seeke from whence this varnish of her looke, this amiablenesse of her countenance, is growne upon her: It is certainly your late benediction that hath painted her; and to speake it in the words of the Poet,
                     
                        Formosam Pater esse dedit, Lumen

                            Juventae
                        Purpureum, &amp; laetos oculis afflârat honores.
                     
                     I have considered of the Letters whereof you pleased to send me a Copie, and in my judgement, you have all the reason in the world to

rest satisfied with it. They could never have been more in favour of you, if you had endited them your selfe, and our friend himselfe had writ them: if you had been the King, and he the Secretary, if I be not deceived, this stile will bring a cooling upon the joy of—and make them see, they have at least mistaken one word for another, and that the absence of—hath not been a discharge of his authoritie, but onely a breathing from the labours of his charge. I am wrestling still with—and preparing you an after-dinners Recreation, which I will bring my selfe to Burdeaux, if you stay there till the next moneth. In the meane time, since you desire new assurances of my fidelitie, I sweare vnto you, with all the Religion of Oathes, and with all the libertie and sinceritie of the golden age, that I am
                     
                        Sir,  
                        Your, &amp;c.
                     
                  
                  
                     To Monsieur de la Nauue, Councellour of the King, in his first Chamber of Enquests. LETTER VIII.
                     SIR, my deare Cousin, your noblenesse is not of these times, but you are generous after the old fashion. To call the paines I put you

to, a favour, and to thanke a man for persecuting you, this is a vertue which Orestes and Pylades perhaps knew, but is now no where to be found, but either in old fables, or in your Letter. The offers you make me, doe not so much give me a possession, as confirme me in it, and assure me the durablenes of a happinesse which wants nothing of being perfect, but being durable. Monsieur de—hath stretched his beliefe yet further; he hath told mee of your comming into this Province, and hath promised me at lest some houres of those Grand daies that bring you hither: if they were as long as those of Platoes yeare, they should not be too long for me, if I might be so happie to spend them in your company. I make account to husband the least minutes of it I can take hold of, and am about in such sort to deck up my Hermitage, that it may not be offensive to your eyes. I can present you but with grosse pleasures and Country recreations; yet you that are perfectly just, will not refuse to take a little contentment where you are perfectly loved, and preferre a lively passion, and a heart sincere, before false semblances and a dead magnificence. My complements are short, and I am by profession a very bad Courtier, but my words carry truth in them, and I am with all my soule,
                     
                        Sir, my deere Cousin,
                        Your, &amp;c.
                        
                           At Balzac; 1. June. 1634.
                        
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     To Monsieur de la Motte le Voyer. LETTER IX.
                     SIR, I am going from Paris in hast, and carry with me the griefe that I cannot stay to tell you in how great account I hold the offer you make me of your friendship. If this be the price of so poore a marchandise, as that I sent you, never was man a greater gainer by traffiking than I: and you seeme in this, not unlike those Indians, who thought to over-reach the Spaniards, by giving them Gold for Glasse. I have long since knowne your great worth, though you would not be knowne to have such worth in you; all the care you can take to hide the beautie of your life, cannot keepe the lustre of it from dazeling mine eyes, and though you make your vertue a secret, yet I have pierced into it, and discovered it. And yet I must confesse unto you my infirmitie, I finde it too sublime for me, and with my uttermost abilitie am not able to reach it; all I can doe, is to respect it with reverence, and to follow you with my eyes and thoughts. The world cannot all rayse it selfe above the pitch of the presentage, and be wise in equall rank with Aristides &amp; Socrates; I am contented to be in a lower forme of vertue, for I am a man, and they demy Gods; I neither aspire to be their equall, nor their rivall, much lesse Sir, to be their judge or accuser.

                        Anitus and Melitus would be much mistaken in me, if they should thinke I would joyne with them in their accusation, as though I thought all opinions to be bad which are not like mine own; I had rather thinke, that it is I that loose the sight of Orasius Tubero sometimes, than thinke that he is strayed, or out of the way; &amp; rather charge my selfe with weaknesse, than accuse him of rashnesse. Let him leave the middle Region of the ayre below him, and mount up above the highest; let him take upon him to judge of humane things, from Shepheards to Kings, from shrubbes to starres, provided, that he be pleased to hold there, and bow his wings, and submit his reason to things divine. I have not time to tell you, how much I value him. Monsieur de—will at more leisure entertaine you with discourse about it, I onely will assure you, that what maske soever you put upon your face, I finde you alwayes exceeding amiable, and that I will ever be
                     
                        Sir,  
                        Your, &amp;c.
                        
                           At Paris, 6. Septemb. 1631.
                        
                     
                  
                  
                     To Madam de Villesavin. LETTER X.
                     MAdam, seeing it is my ill fortune, that I cannot finde you when I come to see you, I entreat you to let me speake to you by an Interpreter,

and that I may make this benefit of my being so farre from Paris, to have a right of writing to you when I could not have the power of speaking with you. Indeed as long as you were taken up with entertaining your deare sonne, whom long absence had made as it were new unto you, and as long as you were tasting the first joyes which his returne had brought with it; It had been a great indiscretion in a stranger, to intrude himselfe into your private feast, &amp; not give you the libertie to make choice of your Guests; but now, that your extasies of joy are over-passed, and that a more calme estate makes you sociable to others abroad: Now Madam, you may vouchsafe to accept my complement, and to heare me say, with my Countrey freedome, that you want much of that I wish you, if you want any thing of absolute felicitie. I make no doubt but Monsieur Bouthillier your sonne, as he parted from hence a right honest man, so he is returned hither an understanding man; and that to the lights which are given by Nature, he hath added those that are gotten by practise, and by conference. The ayre of Italie which is so powerfull in ripening of fruits, hath not been lesse favourable to the seeds of his spirit, and having been at the spring-head of humane prudence, I assure my selfe, he hath drawn deepe of it, and hath filled his minde with so many new and sublime knowledges; that even his Father (if it were not for the great love he 
                           〈◊〉
                         him) might not unjustly grow jealous at it. This Madam, is that happinesse I speake to

you off, and which I have alwayes wished to you, and to which, there can nothing be added, but to see shortly so excellent an instrument set aworke, and so able a man employed in great affayres. When this shall be, I shall then see the successe of my ancient predictions, and of that I have long read in his very face; so that, you may well thinke, I shall take no distast at your contentment, as well for the reputation of my skill in Physnomie and Prognosticating, as for that I perfectly am
                     
                        Madam 
                        Your, &amp;c.
                        
                           At Balzac 2. Octob. 1631.
                        
                     
                  
                  
                     To Monsieur de Gomberville, LETTER XI.
                     SIR, the mischance at the Tuilliries, hath disquieted me all night, and my unquietnesse would have continued still, if you had not taken the paines to calme it. The newes you send me, gives me life; A man cannot be innocent, whom Madam de Maiso
                              •…
                           fort judgeth culpable, shee is not one that will complaine where there is no fault; and truly, if she had taken the mischance of her page in another fashion than shee did, I would rather have abandoned reason than maintaine it against her, &amp; would not have

trusted my owne testimony, if shee rejected it. You remember, that but hearing her Name, I fell downe in a trance, and that the very sight of her livery, strucke into me a religious horrour, and a trembling respect, which is not borne, but to things divine. And in this ranke, I place so rare a beauty as hers is; and though I be no man of the world, yet I am not so very a stranger to the occurrents of the world, but that I very well know, shee is universally adored; I must not alwayes passe for an Hermite; this I am sure, shee carries with her the desires and vowes of all the Court, and shee leades in triumph those Gallants, who have themselves triumphed over our enemies: yet I know withall, they depend more upon her by their owne passion, than by her endeavours, and follow without being drawne. These are Captives, whom shee trusts upon their word, for their true imprisonment, and whom shee suffers to be their owne Keepers. In the course shee holds of honestie, her favours are so morall, or so light, that either they content none but the wise, because they desire no more than what is given them; or none but the unwise, because they take that to be given them, which was never meant them; so there are some perhaps well satisfied, but it is by the force of their imagination, and no body hath cause to be proud of a Fortune, which no body possesseth. As her vertue is as cleere as the fire that sparkles in her eyes, so her reputation is as much without blemish as her beautie; &amp; of this, honest people give testimony by their

words, and Detractors by their silence. Shee makes thornes that they cannot pricke, and makes slander it selfe to learne good manners. And therefore Sir, I should be very unfortunate, if I had been cause of displeasing her, whom all the world endeavours to please; and it would be a shame to our Nation, that a Frenchman should beare himselfe unreverently towards her, to whom very Barbarians beare a reverence. If this mis-fortune had besallen me, it is not the saving my Pages life, should make me stand in the defence; and I would never desire to augment my traine, but to the end I might have the more sacrifices to offer upon the Altar of her choler. But shee is too mercifull, to punish meane Delinquents, and too generous, to give petty Examples: shee reserves her justice for the Great ones, and the Proud; for those who having more tender senses, are better able to feele the weight of her anger; or els in truth her purpose is to shew me a particular favour, by a publike declaration, and to let the world see, shee makes a reckoning of that of which the world makes none. And knowing what the gratefulnesse of good Letters is, shee is desirous to have them in her debt; shee payes our studies before-hand, for the fruit shee expects from them, and obligeth the Art which can prayse the Obligation: shee is made beleeve, that I have some skill in this Art, and I perceive I am not in so little respect with her as I thought; and of this I am assured, by the paines it cost you, to make her take her Page againe that was hurt;

and by the civill language shee desired you to deliver from her. It exceeded indeed all bounds of moderation, and it seemes shee would not only for my sake protect an innocent, but would be ready, if need were, to reward a delinquent. For acknowledgment of which generous goodnesse, all my owne spirit, and all my friends put together, can never be too much. It is particularly your selfe to whom I must have recourse in this occasiō: you Sir, who set the Crown upon Beauties head, who have the power to make Queenes at your pleasure; and to whom Olympia and Yzatide, are beholding for their Empire: having bestowed so great glory upon persons that never were; and set all France a running after Phantosmes, you may well take upon you to defend the reputation of a sensible and living vertue, and choose a subject that may be thankefull to you for your choice; and this is a matter you cannot deny, of which wee will talke more, and conclude it after dinner in presence of the Lady that is interessed in it, into whose presence, I must entreat you, to be my usher to bring me, that so I may ever more and more be,
                     
                        Sir,  
                        Your most humble and most obliged servant, &amp;c.
                        
                           At Paris, 1. June: 1631.
                        
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     To Monsieur de Villiers Hottoman. LETTER XII.
                     SIR, being equally tender of the good will you beare me, and of the account you make of me, I cannot choose but rest well satisfied with your remembring me, and with the judgement you deliver of my writings; you are not a man that will beare false witnesse, and you have too much honestie to deceive the world, but withall, you have too much understanding to be deceived your selfe, and one may well relie upon a wisedome that is confirmed by time and practise. This is that which makes mee to make such reckoning of your approbation, and such account of your counsell, that I should be loath to be defective in the least tittle of contenting you. It is farre from me, to maintaine a point, that you oppose; I give it over at the first blow, and yeeld at the first summons: yet I could never have thought, that of a jeast, there should have been made a fault; or that a poore word, spoken without designe or ayming at any, should have been the cause of so great complaints. You know, that in a certaine moderne Schoole, there is a difference made, Fra la virtu faeminile, &amp; la Donnesca; and it is held, that to make love, is more the vice of a woman, than of a Princesse; and lesse to be blamed in the person of Semirdmis or Cleopatra, than in the person of Lucretia
                        
or Virginia: I carry not my opinions so farre, and I meane to be no Authour of so extravagant a Moralitie. It may suffice, that without descending from the thesis to the hypothesis, I protest unto you, I should be very sorry, I had trenched upō the reputation of that great Queen, or intended to corrupt the memory of so excellent an odour, as shee hathleft behinde her; of whose great worthinesse, I have in other places sayd so much, that I should but shame my selfe to say any otherwise; and indeed, the termes I used were free, and not injurious, and such, as if they wound a little, they tickle &amp; delight much more: I neither spake disgracefully of the dignitie of her royall birth, nor gave her any odious or uncivill names, as some others have done, whom I condemne extreamly for it; yet Sir, I will yeeld to confesse, that I have said too much, and though my saying too much should have attractives to charm me, and were as deare to me as any part of my selfe, yet seeing it is distastfull to you, I will for your sake cut it cleane off, and never looke for further reasons to induce me to it. I can deny nothing to my friends, and therefore make no doubt of the power you have over me, and of my testifying, upon this occasion, without further opening my eyes, that I am
                     
                        Sir,  
                        Your, &amp;c.
                        
                           At Balzac, 4. Jan. 1632.
                        
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     To Monsieur de Borstell. LETTER XIII.
                     SIR, I am so farre from seeking to justifie my negligence, that I will not goe about so much as to excuse it: nothing but my being dead, can be a valuable reason why I waited not upon you, to offer you my service; all other impediments would prove too light, to have kept mee here: but such is your graciousnesse, that it is impossible to fall foule with you; such your indulgence, that you remit a fault before I can confesse it: you give me no leisure to aske you, at the very first, you oblige me to thanke you, and I have received my pardon here at home, which I never looked to obtaine, but at Oradour, and that with long solliciting. I have not yet seene the Ambassatrix, who hath done me the favour to bring it to me, and I cannot imagine, shee should be surprized with that despaire, as your Letter represents herein. Alclones affliction, in respect of hers, would be but meane, and those women whose teares Antiquitie hath hallowed, did but hate their husbands, in comparison of her: I know not whether you doe her a pleasure, to raise her sorrow to so high a pitch; for after this you speake of, shee shall never be allowed to lift up her eyes, and you give her a reputation whereof shee is not worthy, if shee leave but one haire upon her

head. I much distast your exaggerations, and cannot thinke shee will beare you out in the report you make of her miserable estate: if it were such, as you make it, it would be capable of no remedie: Epictetus and Seneca, would be too meane Physitions, to take her in hand; yet I meane not to contradict you:
                     
                        I thinke when death her husband sea'de,
                        Angelica with her Fates displeasde,
                        Lookt pale i'th face as Alablaster:
                        Charging the guiltlesse starres with blame
                        In the th'hard language, Rage could frame
                        When it is growne the Reasons Master.
                     
                     Yet the glory of her spirit makes me beleeve withall, that this sad humour was but a Fit, and continued not long, and that the same day upon the tempest there followed a calme. A man shall meet with some women of such spirits, that neither time nor Philosophie can worke upon them; and some others againe, that prevent the worke of time &amp; Philosophie, by their owne naturall constitution. As there are some fleshes so hard to heale, that no Balme can cure the pricke but of a pinne; so againe, there are some bodies so well cōposed, that their wounds are healed with plaine Spring water, and they close and grow together of themselves. I assure my selfe, our faire Lady is of this perfect temper, and that she wouldbe no example, to make widowes condemned for curling their locks, or for wearing their mourning gowns edged with

greene. You should alledge unto her the Princesse Leonina, so highly esteemed of the Court of Spaine, and the prime ornament of this last age. Knowing that her husbands quirry was come, to relate unto her the particulars of his death, &amp; hearing that his Secretary was to come the morrow after, shee sent the quirry word, to forbeare comming to see her, till the Secretary were come, that so shee might not be obliged to shed teares twice. There is no vertue now adayes so common as constancy, nor any thing so superfluous, as the custome of comforting. All the Steele of Biscay, and all the poyson of Thessalie, might well enough be trusted in the hands of the mourners of our time, without doing any hurt. I scarce know a man that would not be glad to out-live, not onely his friends &amp; parents, but even the age he lives in, &amp; his very Country, and rather than die, would willingly stay in the world himselfe alone. Speake therefore no more of keeping Angelica here by force, who in my opinion is not of herselfe unwilling; and not having lost the King of Sweden, may therefore the more easily repayre her losse. I would to God Sir, I could be no sadder than shee is, and that I could forget a person, who is at this present the torment of my spirit; as he hath heretofore been the delight of my eyes: but melancholick men doe not so easily let goe the hold of their passions, and the good remedies you have sent to comfort mee for his death; I approve them all, but apply none of them: yet I give you a thousands marks,

though six moneths after they were due; and though I say not often, yet I say it most truly, that you shall never take care of any man, that is more than my selfe,

                     To Madam—LETTER XIIII.
                     MAdam, seeing I could not come to see you at your departure, as I was bound to doe, I doe not thinke I shall doe you any wrong to send you a better companion than that I promised you; I meane the Booke I now send you, whereof you have heard so much talke, and which you meant to have carried with you into Perigord, to be your comforter for the losse of Paris. It is in truth worthy of the good opinion you have of it, and of the impatience with which I am a witnesse, you have expected it. And if wagers have been layd upon Queenes great bellies, and assurance given they should be brought abed of a sonne, why should I wonder that you have given before hand, your approbation of a thing that deserves the approbation of all the world? It will certainly bring you

out of tast with the Present I gave you, when you desired me to looke you out some of my Compositions. In it you shall finde that, that will shorten he longest dayes of this season; That, that will keepe you from tediousnesse when you are alone; That, that will make you thanke me for my absence. For to say true, all visits will be unseasonable to you, when you set your selfe to the Recreation of so sweet a reading; and whosoever shall come to trouble you at such a time, must needs have from you some secret maledictions, what civilities soever you make shew of, as your custome is. I would be loath to fall into this inconvenience, it is better I give my opinion a farre off, and in a Letter, which you may entertaine without any solemnitie: since then you will have me beleeve, that my judgement is not altogether bad, nor my opinions wholly unsound; I professe unto you Madam, that setting aside the affection I beare to the Authour of this worke, I have observed in the worke it selfe, a number of excellent things, which I could not chuse but prayse, even in an enemy. He is not so cholerick I hope, but that he will pardon me if I say that he is one of the most pleasing lyars that ever I saw. I complaine not of his impostures, but when he ceaseth to deceive me, because I would gladly have them last alwayes. His History hath quite removed my spirit out of its place, and hath touched to the quicke all that I have sensible in me. I will not hide my weaknesse: I knew at first, that the painting I looked on, was all false, yet

I could not hold from having as violent passions, as if it had been true, and as if I had seen it with mine eyes: sometimes sorrowfull, sometimes glad; as it pleaseth Monsieur de Bois Robert to tell me tales of good or bad fortune. I find my selfe interessed in good earnest in all the affayres of his imaginary Kings; I am put in feare for the poore Anaxandra, more than I can expresse, and as much I am humbled for the mis-fortunes of Lysimantus, and I have seene them both in such extremities, that I made solemne vowes for their safetie, when at the very height they were miraculously delivered. In conclusion Madam, though I have a heart hard enough, and eyes not very moyst, yet I could not forbeare to shed teares, in spight of my selfe; and I have been even ashamed to see, that they were but the dreames and fancies of another man, and not my owne proper evils which put into me such true passions. This is a tyrannicall power, which the sence usurpeth over the reason, and which makes us see, that the neighbour-hood of the imagination, is extreamly contagious to the intellectuall part, and that there is much more body than soule in this proud creature, which thinkes it selfe borne to command all others. The Aethiopick History hath oftentimes given me these Alarums, and I cannot yet reade it without suffering my selfe to be deceived. As for other writings of this kinde, it is true, I make some choice, and runne not after all Spanish Romanos, with equall passion. They are indeed for the most part, but Heliodorus
                        
in other clothes, or as—sayd, but children borne of Theagenes and Chariclea, and seeme to resemble their Father and Mother so neere, that there is not a haires breadth of difference betweene them. But in this worke Madam, I make you promise you shall see novelties, and shall finde in it this sweet ayre of the wide world, and these dainties of the spirit, which are not common in our Provinces. I confesso unto you, there is in some passages some thing that may seeme too much painted, and perhaps too garish, and which will not beare examining by the rigour of Precepts; but then you must confesse as well that Fables looke chiefly after beautie, and care not though it be a little immodest, seeing this kinde of writing is rather a loose Poesie, than a regular Prose. As soone as I shall be able to ride, I will come and heare your Oracles hereupon, and tell you, as I use to doe, that as your selfe is one of the perfectest things I ever saw, so I am more than of any other,

                        Your, &amp;c.

                     To Monsieur Hobier, President of the Treasures in the Generalitie of Bourges. LETTER XV.
                     SIR, though you should say, I present you alwayes with flowers that prick you, and offer you services that may seeme unseasonable, yet I cannot forbeare the sollicitations of my Letters, nor the trading with you by this way of Complements. The Booke which I have desired Monsieur de—to deliver to you, shall passe if you please, but for an Essay; and I am contented that my discourses Morall and Politick, shall contribute nothing to the mending of my own fortune, so they may contribute something to the recommending of my Sisters businesse: if it become me to speake of a person that is so neere unto me, and if you thinke me worthy to be credited in the testimony I shall give of her, I am able Sir, to say thus much, that shee is a womā, either lifted up by her own strength above the passions of her sexe, or that Nature hath exempted her from them, by a peculiar priviledge: so farre, as that amongst us, shee stands for an example, and leads a life that is the edification of all our Province. But though shee make profession of severe vertues, yet shee aspires to no glory by sullen humours; shee hath

nothing muddy, nor clownish in her, but tempers her austerity with so much exterior sweetnesse, that without endeavouring to please any, shee seemes to be pleasing to all the world, I therefore sollicite you for her, in behalfe of all the world, and crave your favour with violence; for to crave it with discretion, would make but a weake shew, of the desire I have to obtaine it. In matters that concerne my selfe onely, I am held backe by a certaine naturall

                        unitie of the suppliant; and when you shall know her better, you will find no great excesse in that I write, and will blesse my persecution. You have already obliged us exceedingly, and have put the businesse in an infallible way of prospering; it onely remaines Sir, that you crowne your courtesie, and draw a concluding word from the parties, whom I shall call Publicans, and couple them with Heathens, if they be not converted and led with that you shall say unto them: but I cannot doubt of the effect of your perswasions, who know, that both by your tongue, and by your pen, you practise our Art, with assured successe. Let us now see the proofe of it, in this occasion, and I p

was more commended, nor shall be more recommended, than yours shall be. The consideration of a good deed, being joyned to that of vertue, you shall possesse me by a double title, and I shall not be lesse of due, than I am by choice,

                     SIR, seeing the Relations that come from Paris, tell us no Newes at all of you, I entreat you to be your owne Historian, and not suffer me to be punctually informed of a thousand things, that are indifferent to me, and remaine altogether ignorant of the state of your health, which is so infinitely deare unto mee. It is very likely, you have all the care that may be of it, as of a thing necessary for exercising the functions of a vertuous life; and I doubt not but you containe your selfe alwayes in that excellent meane, which is between disorder and mortification. You are no longer hungry after the glory of 
                           
                              〈◊〉
                           , and if the Artillery of

the Valstin carry not so farre as the Realle, I assure my selfe, it can doe you no hurt: my minde therefore is at quiet in that point, and I am not afraid to loose you, as I have lost some other valiant friends; and you doe well to leave the warre to others, and stay your selfe upon the Victory. I aske you pardon for this untoward Aequivocall word, I have rather written it than thought it, and it is a mis-fortune which surprizeth me but very seldome: I onely say Sir, that it is better to be Abbot a dozen miles from Paris, than to be Generall of an Armie in Tharingia or Westphalia; and that a Crosse of so many pounds a yeare, is much more worth than either Hercules clubbe, or Rowlands sword; and that he that gave you so honest and so rich an idlenesse, hath not ill deserved of your Philosophy, to which I recommend me with all my heart, and wish unto it the continuance of this happie repose; but upon condition, that it make you not distaste our friendship, and suffer you to place one of the most noble vertues of the mind in the number of her maladies and infirmities. Be not a Doctour so farre as that, and remember, you are my debtor of some affection, if you forget not, that I am

                     To Monsieur de Forgues, Commander of a Company in Holland. LETTER XVII.
                     SIR, my deare Cousin, I thinke my selfe a rich man with the goods you have given me another that should have received the same present, should not owe you for it the same obligation, but the opinion of things, is the measure of their value; and because I have neither minde nor eyes that be covetous, I account the Emeraudes of your Glasse-windowes, of as great a price as those of Lapidaries: at least, whereas they are without life and motion, these live and moove in my base Court. I know my riches, and am known by them, and after I have read my selfe starke blind, I goe and refresh my wearied sight in that admirable verdure, which is to me both a recreation and a remedie. Base objects, not onely offend my imagination, but even provoke my choler; and I should never receive a Monkey from the best of my friends, but onely to kill it: but I vow unto you, that beautie pleaseth me wheresoever I meet it; yet because it is a dangerous thing in womens faces, I like better to behold it in the feathers of birds, and in the enameling of flowers. Pleasures so chast, are compatible with Lent, and

offend not God: and therefore upon these one houre in a day, I take pleasure to stand gazing and amuse my selfe: I thanke you for it with all my heart, and passionately am

                     To Madam d'Anguitur. LETTER XVIII.
                     MAdam, It shall never be laid to my charge, that you speake of me with honour, and that I understand it without feeling. A good opinion is obligatory, from whence so ere it come, but infinitely more, when it comes from an exquisit judgement, as yours is; and I doubt not, but Socrates was more touched and tickled with that one word the Oracle spake of him, than with all the prayses the world had given him. The favourable discourses you have held of me, ought not to be held of me in lesse acoūt than words indeed inspired, &amp; if I should place them in the number of humane testimonies, I should sh
                           •…
                        w my selfe ignorant, that it is Heaven which hath been your Instructour; and that from thence, you have received those cleere lights, whereof the Starres are but shadowes.

I doe not amplifie any thing at adventure, nor suffer my selfe to be swayed with flattery; but in this point of Illumination, Madam, I alwayes except matters of Faith, least your Ministers should take advantage of my words. We must needs, I say, hold for certaine, that either you have been instructed by an extraordinary way, or confesse that you owe it all to your selfe, and that comming to know the truth, without studie and discipline, your vertue is a meere work of your owne making. It is no small matter for one that lives in parts remote from the Court, to be but tolerably reasonable, &amp; able to maintaine his common sence against so many opposites and oppositions, as he shall meet with; but in those remote parts, where you have no choice of Examples, there to discover the Idaea, from whence Examples are taken, to breath in an infected Ayre, and full of Errours; and yet reteine still sound opinions; to be continually opposed with extravagant questions, and yet alwayes returne discreet answers; To take pittie of silly Buffons, when others admire them; to make a difference between jeasts picked up here and there, and those that come from the Spring it selfe; between wise discourses, and harmonious fooleries; between a sufficiency that is solid, and that which is onely painted; to doe these things Madam, ought to be called even halfe a miracle: and no lesse a raritie in these dayes than in former times, it was to see a white Aethiopian, or a Scythian Philosopher. Our Country may justly be proud of so admirable

a birth; It is the great worke of her famous faecunditie, and wee may boldly say, there is that found in Saintoigne, which is wanting in the Circle; that which hinders the Court from being compleat, and that which is necessary for the perfecting of Paris it selfe. But as well here as there Madam, if ever you will heare the vowes of those who wish your happinesse, I would thinke it fit, you should not make your selfe a spectacle for the vulgar, nor suffer your entertainment to be a recreation for idle persons. It deserves not to be approached unto without preparation; &amp; that they should examine themselves well, who present themselves before it. All spirits at all times, are not capable of so worthy a communication, and therefore, let men say what they will, I account the reservations you make of your selfe, to be very just, and it cannot be thought strange, that being as you are of infinite value, you take some time to possesse your selfe alone, and not to loose your right of reigning; which admits, as no division, so no Company. To use it otherwise Madam, would not be a civilitie, or a courtesie, but indeed an ill husbanding of your spirit, and a wastfull profusion of those singular graces, of which, though it be not fit you should deprive them that honour you, yet it is fit you should give them out by tale, and distribute them by measure. It is much better, to have lesse generall designes, and to propose to ones selfe, a more limited reputation, than to abandon ones spirit to every on
                           •…
                         that will be talking, and to expose it to the curiositie

of the people, who leave alwayes a certaine taynt of impuritie upon all things they looke upon: by such vitious sufferance, we find dirt and mire carried into Ladies Closets: if there come a busie fellow into the Countrey, presently honest women are besieged, there is thronging to tell them tales in their eares; and all the world thinkes, they have right to torment them: and thus, saving the reverence of their good report, though they be chast, yet they be publike; and though they can spie the feast sullying upon their ruffes, yet they willingly suffer a manifest soyling of their noblest part. You have done Madam, a great act, to have kept your selse free from the tyrannnie of custome, and to have so strongly fortified your selfe against uncivill assay lants; that, whilst the Louver is surprized, your house remaines impregnable. I cannot but magnifie the excellent order, with which you dispose the houres of your life; and I take a pleasure to thinke upon this Sanctuary of yours, by the onely reverence of vertue made inviolable: in which, you use to retyre your selfe, either to enjoy more quietly your repose, or otherwise, to exercise your selfe in the most pleasing action of the world, which is the consideration of your selfe. If after this your happie solitnde, you come sometimes and cast your eyes upon the Book I send you, you shall therein Madam, doe me no great favour: the things you shall have thought, will wrong those you shall reade; and so it shall not be a grace, but an affront I shall receive. I therefore humbly entreat

you, there may be some reasonable intermission, between two actions, so much differing: Goe not streight from your selfe to me, but let the rellish of your owne meditation be a little passed over, before you goe to take recreation in my worke. To value it to you, as a piece of great price; or otherwise, to vilifie it, as a thing of no value, might justly be thought in me an equall vanity. They who praise themselves, desire consent, and seeke after others approbation; they who blame themselves, seeke after opposition, and desire they may be contradicted. This latter humilitie, is no better than the others pride. But to the end, I may not seeme to goe to the same place, by a third way, and desire to be praysed, at least with that indifferency I ascribe to you; I entreat you Madam, that you will not speake the least word, either of the merit of my labour, or in default of merit, of the fashion of language I have used in speaking to you: I meane not to put this Letter upon the score; to speake plainly, I entreat you to make me no answer to it; so farre I am off, from expecting thankes for it. It is not, Madam, a Present I make you, it is an homage I owe you; and I pretend not to oblige you at all, but onely to acquit my selfe of the first act of veneration, which I conceive I owe you, as I am a reasonable creature, and desiring all my life to be

                     SIR, I never deliberate upon your opinion, nor ever examine any mans merit, when you have once told me what to beleeve. But yet, if I should allow my selfe the libertie to do otherwise, I could but still say, that I find Monsieur de—well worthy the account you hold him in, and my selfe well satisfied of him, upon his first acquaintanee. By further conversation, I doubt not, but I should yet discover in him more excellent things, but it is no easie matter, ever to bring us together againe: For, he is a Carthusian in his Garrison, and I an Hermite in the Desart; so as that which in our two lives makes us most like, is that which makes us most unlikely ever to meet: yet I sometimes heare Newes of him; and I can assure you, he is but too vigilant in looking to his Charge; hee hath stood so many Rounds and Sentinells, that it is impossible, he should be without rhumes, at least, till Midsomer. These are, to speake truly, workes of supererogation; for I see no enemy this Province need to feare, unlesse perhaps, the Persian or Tartarian: the very Name of the

King, is generally fortification enough, over all his Kingdome; and as things now stand, Vaugirad is a place impregnable; that if Demetrius came againe into the world, he would loose his reputatiō before the meanest village of Beausse: but this is one of your politician subtleties, to make Angoulesme passe for a Frontier Towne, and to give it estimation, that it may be envied. Doubt not, but I shall give you little thankes for this, seeing by this meanes you are cleane gone from us, and I must be faine to make a journey of purpose into Lauguedoc, if I ever meane to enjoy the contentment of embracing you, and of assuring you, that I am

                     To Monsieur de Serizay. LETTER XX.
                     SIR, if you were but resident at Paris, I should hope sometimes to heare of your Newes, but now that you are bewitched there, it will be an ungratefull worke for you to reade 
                           •…
                        ine. They are alwayes such as must be pittied. In my way there are as many stones to dash against, as in yours there are flowers: and life it

selfe is an evill that I suffer, as it is a good that you enjoy: you left me blind, and may now find me lame; my causes of complaining never cease, they doe but change place; and the favours I receive, are so husbanded, that I cannot recover an eye, but by the losse of a legge. I was yesterday in a great musing upon this, when suddenly a great light shined in my Chamber, and dazeled mine eyes, even as I lay in my bed. And not to hold you long in suspence, the Name of the Angell I meane, was Madam d' Estissac, who thus appeared unto me, and willing to make the world see, how much shee hath profited in Religion, runnes after all occasions, to put her Christian vertues in practise. This somewhat abates the vanity I should otherwise have taken in her visite; for, I see it is rather charitie than courtesie, and I am so much beholding to my infirmitie for it, that shee made a doubt whether I were sicke enough to merit it; as much as to say, a Paralitick should have had this courtesie from her sooner than I. They must be great miseries that attract her great favours; pittie which teacheth the fayrest hands of the world to bury the dead, may well get of the fayrest eyes that ever were, some gracious lookes to comfort the afflicted. What ere it be, I have found by experience, that no sadnesse is so obstinate and clowdie, but pleasing objects may dissolve &amp; pierce, not any Philosopher so stony and insensible, but may be softned and awaked by their lightest impression. I verily thinke, another of her visits, would have set me on my legges, and made

me able to goe: but shee thought me not worthy of a whole miracle, and therefore I must content my selfe with this beginning of my cure. I enforme you of these things, as being one that reverenceth their cause, and as one that loves me too well, to make slight of the goods or evills I impart unto him. This last word of my Letter, shall serve, if you please, for a corrective to the former, I revoke it as a blasphemie, and will never beleeve, that all the Magick in: Paris, is able to make you forget a man, whom you have promised to love, and who passionately is

                     Another to him: LETTER XXI.
                     SIR, this is the first opportunitie I could get to write unto you, and to comfort my selfe for your absence by this imperfect way, which is the onely meanes left mee to enjoy you. These are but shadowes and figures of that ture contentment, I received by your presence; b
                           •…
                         since I cannot be wholly happie, I must take it in good part that I am not wholly miserable.

I will hasten all I can to finish the businesse I have begun, thereby to put my selfe in state to see you; and if my minde could goe as fast as my will, I should my selfe be with you as soone as my Letter. It is true, there cannot be a more delicate and daintie place, than this where I live banished; and a friend of ours said, that they who are in exile here, are farre happier than Kings in Muscovia: but being separated from a man so infinitely deere unto mee, I doe not thinke, I could live contented in the Fortunate Islands; and I should be loath to accept of felicitie it selfe, if it were offered me, without your company. Wherefore assure your selfe, that as soone as I can rid my selfe of some importunate visits, which I must necessarily both receive and give, I will not loose one moment of the time, that I have destinated to the accomplishment of—and will travaile much more assiduously than otherwise I should doe, seeing it is the end of my travaile, that onely can give me the happinesse of your presence. In the meane time, I am bound, first to tell you, that I have seene here—and then to give you thankes for the good cheare he hath made me. He beleeves upon your word, that I am one of much worth, and gives me Encomiums, which I could not expect from his judgement, but that you have corrupted it, by favouring me too much. I earnestly entreat you, to let mee heare from you, upon all occasions; and to send me by the Post the two books, which I send for to Monsieur—if you have not received

them of him already; but above all, I desire you, that we may lay aside all meditation and art in writing our Letters; and that the negligence of our stile, may be one of the marks of the friendship between us: and so Sir, I take my leave, and am with all my soule,
                     
                        Your, &amp;c.

                     Another to him. LETTER XXII.
                     SIR, eyther you meane to mocke me, or I understand not the termes of your Letter; I come to you in my night gowne, and my night cap upon my head, and you accuse me for being too fine. You take me for a cunning marchant, who am the simplest creature in the world: if another should use me thus, I should not take it so patiently; but what ere your designe be, I count my selfe happie, to be the subject of your joy, and that I can make you merry, though it be to my cost: when I write to you, I leave my selfe to the conduct of my penne, and neither thinke of the dainties of our Court, nor of the severitie of our Grammar; that if there be any thing in my Letters of any worth, it must needs be, that you have falsified them, 
                           〈◊〉
                         so it is you that are the Mountebanke, and

will utter your counterfeits for true Diamonds. You know well, that Eloquence is not gotten so good cheape, and that to terme my untoward language, by the name of this qualitie, is a superlative to the highest of my Hyperboles. Yet it seemes, you stand in no awe of Father—as though you had a priviledge, to speake without controll, things altogether unlikely; for this first time, I am content to pardon you, but if you offend so againe, I will enforme against you, and promise you an honourable place in the third part of Philarchus. The man you wrot of, hath no passions now; but wise and stayed; he hath given over play, and women, and all his delight now, is in his Bookes and vertue. Rejoyce, I pray you, at this happie conversion, and if you be his friend so much, and so much a Poet, as to shew your selfe in publicke, you may doe well to make a Hymne in prayse of Sicknesse; as one hath heretofore done in prayse of Health: for to speake truly, it is his sicknesse that hath healed him, and hath put into him the first meditations of his health: I expect great Newes from you by the next Post, and passionately am

                     To Monsieur Ogier. LETTER XXIII.
                     SIR, I cannot but confesse that men in misery, never found a more powerfull Protectour than your selfe; and that you seeme borne to be a defender of oppressed innocency. The Fathers of the Minimme Order, are as much beholding to you as my selfe; whose right, you have so strongly maintained, that if I did not know you well, I should verily think, the Saint you speake of, had inspired you. And as by his prayers he gaines a jurisdiction over the fruitfulnesse of Princesses, so by the same prayers he hath contributed assistance to this excellent worke you send mee. After this, it is not to be sufferd you should make shew of distast, and tell me of your sloathfulnesse. When fire shall cease to be active, I will then beleeve, you can be sloathfull; but will never thinke you hate Bookes, untill—shall give over his suits in Law; or if I must needs give credit to your words, I then assure my selfe, this distast could never come unto you, but by your too great fare, nor this wearinesse, but by your too great labour. I am my selfe a witnesse of your assiduitie in studie; and you know, how early soever I rise in the morning, I alwayes find you in the chamber next to the Meteors; which high region, I conceive you have chosen, that you may

be the neerer to take in the inspirations of Heaven. I thinke it long till I come and visit you there, to take counsell of your Muses, in a number of difficulties I have to propound unto you. In the meanetime, I have this to say, that the Newes you send me, hath even astonished me, and it seemes to me, a kinde of Enchantment Monsieur—will shew you certaine Letters, which I entreat you to consider of, and by which you shall see, that if I be deceived, yet it is not grossely, nor without much cunning used. Make me beholding to you, by opening your minde more particularly in this matter, and by beleeving that I am with all my heart
                     
                        Sir,  
                        Your, &amp;c.
                        
                           At Balzac, 4. Feb. 1629.
                        
                     
                  
                  
                     Another to him. LETTER XXIIII.
                     SIR, there is no friendship in the world of more use than yours: it is my Buckler in all my battailes, it is my Consolation in all my calamities; but specially, it is my Oracle in all my doubts. That which before. I have your advice, I propose to my selfe with trembling, I soone as once I have your approbation: I make it a Maxime, and an Aphorisme: and when

have once consulted with you, never did an Ignoramus take upon him to be some great Doctour better than I doe: You have knowledge enough to serve your owne turne, and your friends; you are the God that inspires the Sibylle: for my selfe, I am no longer an Authour, but an Interpretor, and speake nothing of my selfe, but preach onely your doctrine. I give you a thousand thankes for your great magnificence, in giving me so great a treasure; and for the learned Observations you have been pleased to communicate unto me: Assure your selfe, I will cry them up in good place, &amp; make your Name alledged solemnly for an Authoritie. Gratefulnesse is the poore mans best vertue, and seeing I cannot be liberall, I will endeavour, at least, not to be unmindfull: And so Sir, I am most perfectly, and more than any other in the world,
                     
                        Your, &amp;c.

                     To Madam Desloges. LETTER XXV.
                     MAdam, being in a fit of a Feaver, I heare you are at Oradour, where I should have the honour to see you, if the joy of so good Newes had the power to carry me thither, and

were able to give me the health, which it is forward to promise me. Being therefore not in case to assure you in person, how sensible I am of your many courtesies; give me leave to testifie unto you, that I am not unmindfull of the very last you shewed me, and that I give you thankes for the beginning of my amendment, whereof you are the cause. It is certaine, that when I was burning in a most extreame fire, I received a notable cooling and comfort, to heare you but onely Named; and this, Madam, is the first miracle you have done in this Countrey, if you stay but a while here, I hope we shall see many more and greater, and that you will leave some excellent markes, that you have beene here. Our Desarts shall be no longer rude, or savage, having once been honoured by your presence, the sweet ayre, that breaths on the bankes of the Loyre, shall spread it selfe hither; and I doubt not, but you will change all the choler of Lymousin into Reason, and make our Lyons become men. I doe not thinke, there is any will oppose this truth, unles perhaps—who had the heart to part from you with drie eyes, and could not finde teares to accompany yours. I have told him of it to his shame, before Monsieur de—and both of us agree, that in this occasion, he might honestly enough, have broken the lawes of his Philosophie, &amp; might have lost his gravitie, without any lightnesse. Whilst wee were together, they desired to see a part of my Prince, which as yet I dare not call by so illustrious a Name; for in truth, Madam,

he can be but a private person, untill such time as you proclaime him, and that he receive investiture from his Soveraigne: so I call your approbation, which is with me in such respect and reverence, that I should preferre it before Reason it selfe, if they were two things that could be separated, and that I were allowed to choose which I would have. I would say more hereof, but that methinks, I have done a great worke to say so much; for my head is in such violent agitation, with the heat of my last fit, that all I can doe at this time, is but to set my hand to this Protestation, that I honour you exceedingly, and am as much as any in the world,
                     
                        Madam 
                        Your, &amp;c.

                     Another to her. LETTER XXVI.
                     MAdam, I am jealous of my Lacquies fortune, who makes now a second journey to you, and consequently, shall be twice together twice as happy as I: he should never have this advantage of me, if to a journey to see you, there went nothing but courage, and if the rellicks of my disease, which prey upon weaknes, did not tyre me more than the extreame violence

did, when I had some strength to resist it. By staying in my chamber, I loose all the fayre dayes that shine in the garden; all the riches of the fields are gathered without me; I have no part in the fruits of Autumne, whereof the Spring gave me such sweet hopes; and I am promised health at winter, when I shall see nothing but a pale Sunne, a thread-bare Earth, and dead sticks, that have brought forth grapes, but not for me to eate. In this miserable estate, I have no comfort, but onely the Letter you did me the honour to write unto me, which is so precious to me Madam, that I even honour it, with a kinde of superstition, and am ready to make a chaine or bracelet of it, to try whether the wearing it about me, may not proove a better Remedy against my Feaver, than all the other I have used. There is but one word in it that I cannot endure, being not able to conceive why you should call your selfe Unfortunate: are you not afraid, least God should call you to account for this word? and charge you with ungratefulnesse, for making so slight reckoning of his great benefits and Graces? He hath lifted you up above your owne sexe, and ours too, and hath spared nothing to make you compleat; the better part of Europe admires you; and in this poynt, both Religions are agreed, and no contesting betweene Catholike and Protestant; The Popes Nuntio, hath presented our Beliefe even to your person, all perfumed with the complements and civilities of Italie; Princes are your Courtiers, and Doctours your Schollers:

and is this Madam, that you call to be unfortunate? and that which you take for a just cause to complaine? I humbly intreat you, to speake hereafter in more proper termes, and to acknowledge Gods favours in a more gratefull manner. I know well, that your loyaltie hath suffered by your brothers Rebellion; and that in the publike miseries you have had some private losses, but so long as you have your noble heart, and your excellent spirit left you, it is not possible, you should be unfortunate; for indeed, in these two parts, the true Madam Desloges is all entire and whole. It is I Madam, that have just cause to say, I am unfortunate, who am never without paine, never without griefe, never without enemies; and even at this very time I write from a house of griefe, where my mother and my sister being sicke on one hand, and my selfe on the other, I seeme to be sicke of three sicknesses at once; yet be not afraid, least this I send you should be infectious, as though I had a designe to poyson you with my Presents: for I have not yet medled with any of the Musque fruits, which I hope you shall eate; I have not durst so much as to come neere them, least I should chance to leave some light impression of my Feaver upon them: They are originally Natives of Languedoc; and have not so degenerated from the goodnesse of their auncestors, but that you will find them, I hope, of no unpleasing taste, and besides Madam, rhey grow in a soyle that is not hated of Heaven, &amp; where I can assure you, your Name is so often rehearsed,

and your vertue so highly esteemed, that there is not an Eccho in all our woods, but knowes you for one of the perfectest things in the world, and that I am
                     
                        Madam 
                        Your, &amp;c.

                     To—LETTER XXVII.
                     MAdam, see here the first thankes I give you, for you know, that having never done me but displeasures, I have never yet returned you but complaints: but now at last you have been pleased to beginne to oblige me, and after so many sentences of death, which you have pronounced against me, and after so many cruelties, which I have suffered, you have bethought your selfe, ten yeares after, to send me one good Newes, which truly is so pleasing to me, that I must confesse, you had no other way to reconcile your selfe unto me; and I cannot forbeare to blesse the hands that brought mee a Letter from Madam Desloges, though they were dyed in my bloud, and had given me a thousand wounds. The sence of former injuries, hath no competition with so perfect a joy, and of two passions equally just, the more violent is easily

overcome of the more sweet. You have hastened the approach of my old age, and made gray one halfe of my haire; you have banished mee this Kingdome, and forced me to flie your tyranny, by flying into another Country: finally, it is no thanke to you, that I have not broken my owne necke, and made matter for a Tragedie: and yet foure lines of Madam Desloges, have the force to blot out all this long story of my mis-fortunes, and willingly with all my heart, I forget all the displeasures I have received, for this good office you now affoord me. I make you this discourse in our first language, that I may not disobey Monsieur de—who will have me write, but will not have me write in any other stile; for in truth, and to speake seriously, now that he leaves me at libertie, I must confesse unto you Madam, that I am exceedingly bound unto you, for the continency I have learned by being with you, and for the good examples you have given me: your medicines are bitter, but they heale; you have banished me, but it is from prison: and if my passions be cooled by the snow of my head, I have then never a white hayre, which I may not count for one of your favours. I therefore recant my former complaints, and confesse my selfe your Debtour of all my vertue. The time I have imployed in your service, hath not been so much the season of my disorderd life, as it hath been an initiating me into a regular life which I meane to leade. Your conversation hath been a schoole of austeritie unto me, and you have taught me, never to

be either yours, or any others, but onely in our Lord,
                     
                        Madam, 
                        Your, &amp;c.
                        
                           At Balzac, 10. Octob. 1629.
                        
                     
                  
                  
                     To Madam Desloges. LETTER XXVIII.
                     MAdam, my evill Fortune, gives one common beginning to all my Letters: I am impatient even to death, to have the honour to come and see you: but now that I am well, the ayre is sicke, and all the Countrey drowned: There is no Land to be seene between this and Lymousin; and the mischiefe is, that there is no navigation yet found out, for so dangerous a voyage. This bindes me to waite, till the waters be fallen, and that God be pleased to remember his Covenant with Noah. As soone as this shall be, I will not fayle to performe my vow, and to come and spend with you the happiest day of all my life. In the meane time Madam, give me leave, to tell you, that I am not yet well recovered of the extasie you put me in, by writing unto me such excellent things, that I could not reade them with a quiet minde, nor indeed without a kinde of jealousie. All Frontignon would be sufficiently paid with that you

write of a dozen paltry Muske-fruits I sent you; &amp; you prayse my writings with words, which have no words worthy of them, but your own. This, of one side makes me envious, and of the other side interessed: and if the honour I receive by your flattering Eloquence, did not sweeten the griefe of being overcome, it would trouble me much that I had no better defended the advantages of our sexe, but should suffer it to loose an honour, which the Greekes and Latines had gotten for it. Yet take heed, you hazard not your judgement too freely, upon the uncertaintie of humane things: you reckon him a Prince, who is not yet borne, you should have seene his Horoscope from the poynt of his conception, before you should speake of him in so loftie termes. But besides that nothing is lesse assured, than the future; and nothing apter to deceive, than hope: Consider, Madam, I beseech you, that you favour an unfortunate man, and that Faction oftentimes carries it away from truth. It will be hard for you, your selfe alone, to withstand an infinite multitude of passionate men: and it may be said to you, as was said to those of Sparta, upon occasion of the great Armic of the Persians, that you can never vanquish as long as they can die. Herein there is nothing to be feared, but for your selfe; for as for me, I finde in your favour, all I seeke for; and having you of my side, I care not what fame can doe, having once your testimony, I can easily flight hers; and all her tongues put together, can never say any thing for me, that is worth

the least lyne of your delicate Letter. It is at this time, the delight and joy of my spirit; I am more in love with it, than ever I was with—and if shee shew you that which I write to her, you shall finde, I make not so much reckoning of my ancient Mistris, as I do of your new messenger; and that I desire all the world should know, that I perfectly am,
                     
                        Madam 
                        Your, &amp;c.
                        
                           At Balzac, 13. Octob. 1629.
                        
                     
                  
                  
                     Another to her. LETTER XXIX.
                     MAdam, I will not take upon mee to give you thankes, for the good cheare you made mee; for, besides that I have none but Country Civilities, and when I have once said, Your humble servant, and your servant most humble; I am then at the end of my cōplemnts, and can goe no further. It were better yet to let you hold your advantage entire, and owe you that still, which I can never pay. I forbeare to speake of the dainties and abundance of your Table, enough to make one fat, that were in a Consumption; nor I speake not of the delicacy of your perfumes, in which you laid mee to

sleepe all night; to the end, that sending up sweet vapours into my braine, I might have in my imagination, none but pleasing visions. But Madam, what but Heaven can be comparable to the dainties of your Closet, and what can I name to represent sufficiently, those pure and spirituall pleasures, which I tasted in your Conversation? It is not my designe, to talke idly, nor to set my stile upon the high straine; you know, I am bound to avoyde Hyperboles, as Mariners to avoyde Sands and Rockes; but this is most true, that with all my heart, I renounce the world, and all its pompes, as long as you please to inhabit the Desart, and if you once determine to stay there still, (though I have sent to Paris to hyre me a lodging) yet I resolve to breake off the bargaine, and meane to build me an Hermitage, a hundred paces from your abode: from whence Madam, I shall easily be able to make two journeys a day to the place where you are, and shall yeeld you a subjection, and an assiduitie of service, as if I were in a manner of your household. There shall I let nothing fall from your mouth, which I shall not carefully gather up, and preserve it in my memory. There you shall doe me the favour, to resolve me when I shall have doubts; set me in the right way, when I goe astray; and when I cannot expresse my selfe in fit termes, you shall cleere my clouds, and give order to my confusednesse. It shall be your eares, upon which I will measure the cadences of my sentences; and upon the different motions of your eyes, I will take notice

of the strength or weaknesse of my writings. In the heate of the travaile, and amidst the joyes of a mother, that lookes to be happily delivered, I will expose the Infant to the light of your judgement to be tryed, and not hold him for legitimate, till you approve him. Sometimes Madam, we will reade your Newes, and the Relations that are sent you from all parts of Christendome: Publike miseries shall passe before our eyes, without troubling our spirits; and the most serious actions of men, shall be our most ridiculous Comaedies. Out of your Closet, we shall see below us the tumults and agitation of the world, as from the top of the Alpes, we stand and safely see the raine and hayle of Savay. After this, Monsieur de Borstell shall come and reade us Lectures in the Politiques, and Comment upon Messer Nicholo unto us: He shall informe us of the affayres of Europe, with as great certaintie, as a good husband would doe of his Familie. He shall tell us the Causes, the Proceedings, and the Events of the warre in Germany; and therein shall give the lye, a thousand times, to our Gazets, our Mercuries, and such other fabulous Histories. Wee will agree with him, that the Prince he is so much in love withall, is most worthy of his passion; and that Sweden is no longer able to containe so great a vertue: After the fashion of Plutarch, he shall compare together the prime Captaines of our age; alwayes excepting—who admits of no comparison. He shall tell us, which is the better man, the Italian, or the Germane;
                        
what meanes may be used to take off the Duke of Saxony from the house of Austria; and what game the Duke of Bavaria playes, when he promiseth to enter into the League; and is alwayes harkening to that which he never meanes to conclude. From these high and sublime Newes, we will descend to other meaner, and more popular subjects. It shall be written to you, whether the kingdome of Amucant be still in being, and whether there appeare not a rising Sunne, to which all eyes of the Court are turned: Monsier de—shall send you word, whether he persist in his pernicious designe, to bring Polygamie into France, and to commit nine Incests at once; I meane, whether he have a good word from those nine Sisters, to all whom he hath solemnly made offer of his service. Wee shall know whether the Baron of—put Divines still to trouble: whether Monsieur da—have his heart still hardened against the ungratefulnesse of the time, and whether Monsieur de—continue still in his wilfulnesse to punish mankinde by the suppression of his Bookes. By the way of Lymoges, wee shall get the devises of Boissiere; the Epigrammes of Mayn
                              •…
                           d, and other toyes of this nature. The Stationer des Espies Meurs will furnish you plentifully with Romances, and with that they call Belles Choses: and if it come to the worst from the very Cindera of Philarchus, there will spring up every moneth a new Phaenix of backbiting Eloquence, that will find 
                           〈◊〉
                         recreation for one houre at least. And these

Madam, are a part of those imployments, in which I fancy in my minde, we may spend our time all the time of the heat; for when the returne of Aprill shall bring againe the flowers and fayre dayes, and invite you abroad awalking: we must then looke us out some new pleasures, and change our recreations: wee will have swannes and other strange Birds, to cover this water at once both quicke and still, which washeth the feet of your Muses: wee will fall a planting of trees, &amp; dressing the allies of your Garden: wee will digge for Springs, and discover treasures, which loose themselves under ground, which yet I value no lesse than veynes of silver, because I judge of them without covetousnesse. And finally, Madam, we will fall abuilding that famous Bridge, by which to enter your enchanted Palace, and wherof the onely designe, puts all the neighbouring Nobilitie already into a jealousie. If you like of this course, and of these Propositions, and that my company may not be troublesome to you, there remaines nothing to doe, but that you command mee to come, and I am instantly ready to quit all other affayres in the world, and to come and testifie to you, that I am

                     MAdam, wee receive the Answers of Oracles without making reply; perfect devotion is dumbe, and if you had left me the use of my tongue, I should then have had one part at least, of my spirit free from this universall astonishment that hath surprized it. You are alwayes lifted up above the ordinary condition of humanitie, and the divinenesse of your spirit is no longer an Article in question amongst people that are reasonable; yet I must confesse, you never shewed it more visibly, than in the last Letter you writ unto me, &amp; if at other times I have beene dazeled with some beame, you have now made me starke blind with the fulnesse of your light. Spare Madam, I entreat you, the weaknesse of my sight, and if you will have me be able to endure your presence, take some more humane forme, and appeare not all at once in the fulnesse of that you are, I were never able to abide such another flash of brightnesse. My eyes are weary with looking upward, and with considering you, as you are a creature, adorable and divine. Hereafter I will not looke upon you, but on that side you are good and gracious, and will not venture to reason with you any more, for feare I should to my owne confusion illustrate the advantage of your spirit over

mine. You shall have nothing from me hereafter, but prayers and thankes; and I will make you confesse, that I sollicite better than I praise. I therefore send you now Madam, divers crosses at one time, and persecute you with no lesse than three afflictions at once, I meane, three Letters of recommendation, which I request from you, in behalfe of—I humbly entreat you to deliver them to this messenger, and to write them in such a perswasive style, as might be able to corrupt all the Catoes of Paris; although indeed, the cleernesse of our right, hath more need of their integritie, than of their favour. I expect Madam, this new courtesie from your goodnesse, and am alwayes more than any in the world,
                     
                        Your, &amp;c.

                     MAdam, in the state I am now in, there is none but your selfe could make me speak: and I never did a greater worke in my life than to dictate these foure untoward lynes: my spirit is so wholly taken up with the consideration of my misery, and flies all commerce and company, in so violent a manner, that if it concerned

me not exceedingly, you should know that—finds himselfe infinitely obliged to your courtesies, and my selfe no lesse than he; I thinke verily, I should have let—depart, without so much as bidding him Farewell. Pardon Madam, the weaknesse of a vulgar spirit, which feeles no crosses light, and falls flat downe at tho very first blow of adverse Fortune. Perhaps in prosperitie, I should carry my selfe better, and I doe not thinke, that joy could make me insolent; but to say the truth, in affliction I am no body, and that which would not so much as leave a scratch upon the skin of a Stoick, pierceth me to the very heart, and makes in it most deepe wounds. Griefe dejects me in such sort, and makes me so lazie in doing my dutie, and so unfit for all functions of a civill life, that I wonder no longer at those that were turned into trees and rockes, and lost all sence with onely the sence of griefe. Yet Madam, as often as I call to minde, that I hold some part in your account and love; I am forced to confesse, that my melancholy is unjust, and that I have no good foundation for my sadnesse. This honour ought to be unto me a generall remedy against all sorts of affliction, and the misery that you complaine of, is not so much to be pittied as to be envied. From thence it is, that I draw all the comfort I am capable of, humbly entreating you to beleeve you shall never pitie a man in misery, that will be more gratefull than my selfe, nor that is more passionately, than I am

                     MAdam, I receive but just now your Letters of the five &amp; twentieth of the last moneth, and though I know not, by whom to send an answer, yet I can no longer hold from expressing my joy, nor keepe my words from leaving my heart to fall upon this paper. The last time I writ unto you, I had heard of the unfaithfulnes of a friend of mine, which struck me to the very heart; since which time, a better report hath somewhat quieted me; but it is you, Madam, that have restored to me the full use of my reason; and are a cause that I am contented to live. Although corruption be in a manner universall, and that there is no more any goodnesse to be found amongst men, yet as long as you are in the world, it is not fit to leave it quite, but your vertue may well supply all its defects. Besides Madam, if it be true, as you doe me the honour to write unto me, that you account my interests as your owne; this very consideration is enough to make them dearer to me than they were before; and I am therefore bound to preserve my selfe, seeing it seemes, you would be loath to loose me. One gracious word, which I observed in your Letter, hath wonne me to you, in such sort, that I have no longer any power of my selfe, but what you leave me; and in all your

Empire, which is neither meane, nor consists of 
                           〈◊〉
                         subjects; I can assure you, that you possesse nothing with more soveraigntie, than my will. If your occasions draw you to Aunix this next Spring, I hope to have the honour to see you at Balzac, where I am trimming up—with all the care I can, that it may be a little more worthy of your presence, and that the amusement I shall thereby give you, may keepe you from working the ill cheare you are like to finde in a Country village: My sister is infinitely bound to you, for the honour you doe her, in remembring her; and I am my selfe, with all my soule

                     Another to her. LETTER XXXIII.
                     MAdam, my indisposition hathbin the cause of my silence, and I thought it better to say nothing, than to entertaine you with a troublesome discourse: Besides, I was in a continuall expectation of the performance of your promise; and looked to have the honour, to see you here in May. But seeing you have made my hopes recoyle, and that you make your abode

in Limousin for some longer time, be pleased Madam, that I send—to bring me a true relation of the state of your health; and to tell me, if you use, as you ought, the shade of your woods, and the freshnesse of your fountaines: For my selfe, who make my harvest at the gathering of Roses and Violets; and who reckon the goodnesse of the yeare, by the abundance of these delicate Flowers; Now is the season for my humour, and in one onely subject I finde cause enough, to scorne and slight both the perfumes of the sheet St. Honore, and the pictures of the faire St. Germain. Thus I make my selfe happie, at a very easie rate, and have not so much as a thought of any want. And indeed, to what purpose should I grieve for pleasures that are absent, and curiously hunt after all the defects of my Estate. If my commerce be onely with dumbe Creatures, at least I am not troubled with the importunitie of Courtiers, nor with the verses of a paltry Poet, nor with the Prose of Messieurs—: These are the inconveniences of Paris, which I count more troublesome, than either the dirt, or the justling of Coaches, and at the worst, if by living in the Desart, I should become a meere savage, yet I am sure to recover the garbe of the world, as soone as I shall but see Madam Destoges, and make my selfe neat and civill, with but one halfe houres conversing with her. This is my wish Madam, and passionately I am

                           SIR, My deare Cousin,
                        
                        one cannot say you nay, in any thing: to doe you a second pleasure, I am about to commit a second treason, and to send you the Verses, of which I told you who was the Poet. I was bound by a thousand Oaths to keepe them secret, but I must confesse you are a strange corrupter, and your perswasions would shake a firmer fidelitie than mine: yet to the end, we may at least save the apparence, and give some colour to my fault; you may be pleased to say, that it is the translation of an Ode, made by Cornelia, mother of the Gracchi, and that you found it, in an ancient Manuscript: you may say, shee made it for one of her sonnes, being in love with a woman, whom afterward he married; and that seeing him one day looke extreamly pale, shee asked him, what it was had made him sicke? There is nothing more true than this Story, and there needs nothing, but to change the Names. It is not indeed, the same person, but it is the same merit, and I am sure, you doubt not, but a French Lady is capable of as much, as Quintilian spake of a Romans: Graccorum eloquentiae multum contu

Whatsoever it be, if he had but read Virgill, a woman would have sayd unto him with great indignation; and is it then such a miserable thing to die? And if he had been in the Levant, he might have learned of a Turkish Proverbe, That it is better to be a Cock for one day, than a Henne all ones life.

                     MAdam, I have not dared now a good while to send you any Letters, for feare you should conceive, they carried an ill ayre about them; nor yet to send you any more Melons, which yet prove excellent good this yeare; for doubt you should suspect them, as comming from a Countrey extreamely disparaged: but since I understand by your Letter, that you are not so much frighted as I was told, and since also, I can protest unto you most religiously, that I write from a place most cleere from any taint of the neighbouring misery, and that hath kept sound in the midst of infection: I am most glad

Madam, that I have the libertie to tell you, that I value you more, than all the ancient Romanes, and that I have no comfort to thinke of, in the deepest houres of all my solitude, but onely you, and your incomparable merit. What businesse soever I am about, I take pleasure to let this thought make me a trewant at my travaile; it is a recreation, for which I abandon all affayres; and there is neither Morall, nor Politique, Plato nor Aristotle, but I presently give him over as soone as you are once presented to my imagination. I hope I shall need to use no Oaths, to make you beleeve this veritie: you are well enough acquainted with my pride, and know that this Country swayne would not, turne flatteret for an Empresse. There are but three persons, I am resolved to prayse; you Madam, are one; and if you have the leisure to reade that I send you, you will easily guesse, who the other two are; and so I b

                     MAdam, you shall receive from me no premeditated excuses, I had rather confesse my fault ingenuously, than take the paines to justifie it untowardly. Indeed a fatall sluggishnesse, cousin german to a Lethargie, hath seazed in such sort upon me since my comming hither, that I have not so much as written to my owne mother; so as having fayled in this first poynt, I thought not fit to fayle by halfes; and therefore never troubled my selfe much in the rest of my dutie. I speake Madam, of this exteriour dutie, and this affection in picture, which is oftentimes but a false representation of the soule, for as for the true respect, and the passion, which hath residence in the heart: I assure you, I have that in me for you, as pure and entyre as ever, and that he that calls you his Soveraigne, yet honours you not more perfectly, than I doe. Monsieur de—will I doubt not, be my witnesse herein; and will tell you, that what part soever I be forced to play amongst jeasters and merry companions, yet under my players cloathes, there will alwayes be found an honest man. I have beene sensible, Madam, of the losse, which—hath had, and have not bin sparing to speake of his unfortunate vertue; yet I never thought, he needed any comforting

for it; for, seeing he sees that God spares not his own Images and that his neerest friends have their disgraces and troubles, he ought not to thinke any thing strange that happens in this inferiour world, and upon inferiour I persons; what consideration soever may otherwise make them dea

                         Madam, it shall be if you please upon this condition, that parting with the Letters, you shall never let your memory part with the truthes they containe, but hold undoubtedly that I very firmely am, though I doe not very often say I am

                     MAdam, my labour is happie, since it is never from before you, and since I am told, you make it your ordinary entertainment. The end of all fayre Pictures, and good Bookes, is but onely to please your eyes, and to delight your spirit, and the good you have not yet set

a price upon, is not yet come to its uttermost perfection. I have therefore all that an ambitious man could wish for, I may perhaps have fortune from others, but glory I can have from none but you; and another perhaps may pay me, but none but you can recompense mee. The paines I have hytherto taken, have beene but ill required. I have tilled a ground that brings mee forth but thornes; yet Madam, since they grow for your service, I am contented to be pricked by them; and I love the cause of my disgraces, if they proove a cause of your recreations. The first Newes, you shall heare, will tell you what I meane; and that my patience never makes my persecutours weary. You shall see Madam, that there is no conscience made to contradict you, and that, that which you call excellent and admirable, hath yet at Paris found enemies, and at Bruxells hangmen. I will say no more at this time, but that I am

                     MAdam, I writ unto you about six weekes since, but my packet not being delivered where I appointed it, I perceive some curious body hath seazed on it, and sought for secrets, which he could not find. The losse is not great, to loose nothing, but a few untoward words; and small comforting would serve me, for so small a crosse; yet because they were full of the passion I owe to your service, and carried in them the markes of my dutie, I cannot but be troubled, they came not to your hands, and that my mis-fortune, gives you cause to complaine of my negligence. I dare not undertake to cleare my selfe altogether; for though in this I committed no fault, yet I cannot forget some other faults committed before. The truth is Madam, I have been for some time so continually taken up with businesse, that I have beene wanting in the principall obligations of a civill life, and I have drunke besides so many bitter potions, and tasted so many bitter Pills, that I should but have offended you with my complements; which could not choose but carrie with them, at least some tincture of my untoward humour. What pleasure could you have taken, to see a medley of choler and melancholy, powred out vpon paper? and instead of pleasing

Newes, to reade nothing but pittifull Stories, and mortall Predictions? But enough of this unpleasing matter. I expect here within three or foure dayes, my Lord the Bishop of Nantes; and I would to God Madam, you could be here at that time, and that you were at leisure to come and taste the doctrine of this rare personage. I have heard you say heretofore, you never saw a more holy countenance than his, and that his very looke, was a Prologue of perswasion. This conceit, makes mee hope, that he is the man, whom God hath ordained to be your Converter, and to bring you into the bosome of our Church. Beleeve mee Madam, and you shall not be deceived; trust that enemy, who wounds not, but onely to draw out the bloud that causes a Feaver, and never make difficultie to commit your selfe to one, that intends your freedome. The triumph which the world makes you feare, is no way injurious to those that be the captives; nor like unto that of which Cleopatra tooke so sadde an apprehension: but in this case, the vanquished are they that are crowned, and all the glory and advantage of the victory rests on their side: I am not out of hope to see so good a dayes worke; and seeing you are rather layd asleepe in the opinion of your mother, than obstinate in a wrong cause: I intreat you, that you will not be frighted with phrases. Wee will not use this hard terme to say, you have abjured your heresie; wee will onely say, you are awaked out of your

                         Heaven; and the Angels would rejoyce at the prosperitie of the Church. My zeale Madam, is not out of ostentation: for it is most true, that such a change, is one of my most violent wishes; and to see you say your prayers upon your Beads, I would with all my heart give you a payre made of Diamonds; though I am not rich, yet I hope you doubt not of the truth of these last words, and that I am with all my foule,

                     MAdam, it hath beene, as much my shame, as my glory, to reade your Letter, having so ill deserved it, and the remorse of the fault, I committed, makes mee; that I dare not yet rejoyce in the honour, I received. You

are good and gracious, even to the not hating o
                           •…
                        evill actions; Your delinquents, not onely obteine impunitie, but you allow them recompence, and idlenesse hath more respect with you, than diligent service with ordinary Masters. This is the faelicitie of the Golden age, where Plentie had no neede of tilling; and where there was reaping without sowing. Yet Madam, I must not so abandon my cause, that I forbe are to alledge the good it hath in it; it is long since I writ unto you, it is true, but the cause hath beene for that these six moneths, I have every day been upon comming to see you: and according to the saying of the Oratour your acquaintance, I have dispenced with my ordinary dyet, in hope of a great Feast, and to performe my devotion with the more solemnitie. If Monsieur de—have kept his word with mee, he hath told you, how often he hath found me upon the very poynt of comming; but as many journeys, as I intended to make, so many crosse accidents alwayes happened to hinder them, and the mis-fortune that accompanies me, makes every dutie, though never so casie to another, impossible to me. Yet Madam, I have never ceased from doing continuall acts, of the reverence I beare you, and I never sweare, but by your merit. My braine is drie in any other Argument, and wordes are drawne from me one by one; but when there is occasion to speake of you, then I overflow in words; upon this onely Text, I take

a pleasure to be Preaching; and Monsieur de—to whom I am alwayes before a harkener; as soone as I beginne discourse of you, becomes my auditour. I can assure you Madam, he honours you exceedingly; and neither his ambassage to Rome, from whence Gentlemen returne not commonly without a certaine conceit of soveraigntie; nor the imployments of the State, which make particular men, thinke themselves the Publike, have beene able to make him take upon him, this ungratefull gravitie, which makes Greatnesse ridiculous, and even vertue it selfe odious. He hath protested here, before good companie, that hee will never be found other, and that Fortune should have an ill match in hand, to thinke to corrupt him. I used my ordinary rudenesse, and intreated him, to be mindfull of his word, and to be one of our first examples of so rare a moderation: You shall see Madam, in a Letter I send you; that which hereupon I am bound to say of him: and I intreat you, to maintaine for me, that I am no common prayser: and that, if I were not perswaded of what I say, it is not all the Canons of the Towne should make mee to say it. It is onely the worth of things, or at least, the opinion I have of their worth, that drawes from mee the prayses I give them. If Monsieur de—should returne to be a private person, I should not respect him a jot lesse, than now I doe: and if you should be made Governesse of

the Kings house, I should not be a whit more than I am,

                        MAdam, never trust me any more, I promise that I cannot performe, but though I be a deceiver, I am an honest one; my promises are alwayes true in my intention, though oftentimes false in the Event. I know not what to say of this unfortunatenesse, nor to what knowne cause, to attribute this long trayne of mischiefes. It must needs be, there is some Devill imployed, to hinder voyages to Lymousin: and that will not suffer me to goe thither to see you: sometimes he rayseth up suites in Law against me, sometimes puts me into a quarrell; and when these be composed, and that I am ready to take horse, either he sends mee companie to divert mee, or prickes my horse in shooing, or puts a legge out of joynt; for, all these crosses have befallen mee, as he that delivers you this Letter can be my witnesse. But withall Madam, he shall assure you, that though

I flie away by night, and be carried in a chayre, it shall not be long ere I will have the honour to come and see you. In the meane time, vouchsafe to accept from me, the amusement of halfe an houre, and be pleased to reade an Inscription, which was lately found, and taken forth of the ruines of an old Building. It is engraven in Letters of Gold, upon a Table of blacke Marble, and seemes Prophetically to speake of you and mee. If I were a man could make Verses, you might doubt it were some tricke put upon you, but my ignorance justifies mee, and seeing, as you know, Poets are not made, it were a strange thing I should be borne at the age of seaven and thirtie yeares. I expect from you a Comment upon the whole Mystery; and remaine

                     MAdam, my eyes are yet dazeled, with the brightnesse of your Cabinet, and I vow unto you, the Night was never so fayre, nor so delicately trimmed up, as lately at your House.
                     
                        
                           
Not when the Moone accomplishing her way
                        Vpon her silver wayne, beset with starres
                        Within the gloomy world, presents the day.
                     
                     I have shewed our Ladies the Description of this proud and stately Night, and of the rest of your magnificence, which if it were in a severer Common-wealth than ours, would be called a Profusive Wast; they admire you in your house, as well as in your Verses, and agree with mee in this, that Wisedome hath a hand in every thing, and that, after shee hath discoursed of Princes, and matters of State; shee descends to take care of her Hosts, and lookes what is done in the Kitchin. But from a vertue of their own, they alwayes come to that of yours, asking me continually for Newes of your entertainment, and for Copies of your Letters: and by this meanes, the happinesse which I have from you, is instantly made common to all the neighbourhood, and yet stayes not there neither, but spreads it selfe both farre and neere, that when you thinke, you write but to one particular man, you write indeed to a whole Province. This is not to write Letters, but rather to set forth Declarations and Edicts; I know Madam, you were able to acquit your selfe perfectly, in so noble an Imployment; complements are below the dignitie of your style; and if King Elisabett, should come againe into the world (you know of whom this is spoken) no question but he would make you his chiefe

Secretary of State. Monsieuer de—extolls you yet in a higher strayne, and is infinitely desirous to see you in this Country. Yesterday, of his own accord he made himselfe your Tributary, and hath bound himselfe to send you, every yeare, a reasonable number of his Loaves; if you shall like them, they will grow into more request than the Gloves of the Frangipani: but because your people of Lymousin, may take occasion to Equivocate here: I entreat you to advertize them, that this Perfumer hath thirtie thousand pound rent a yeare; and holds the supremest dignitie of our Province, and that this Glover is a Romane Lord, Marshall of the Campe of the Kings Armies, cousin to St. Gregory the Great, and that which I value more than all this, one of the honestest men that lives. I am bold to use my accustomed libertie, seeing you allow mee to doe it Madam, having given me your Letters Patents for it, and will beare me out to laugh in graver subjects than this is. It may therefore suffice me to say, but most seriously, that I am

                     MAdam, your place is before all other things whatsoever, and therefore no lawfull impediment can be alleaged, for sayling in the dutie, that is due unto you. I have these two moneths had great affayres; which in the rigour of your Justice, is as much as to say, I have these two moneths neglected my dutie. Having not written to you, in all this time, I am contented to call it, a Disorder, which otherwise I should call a Businesse, and I doe not thinke, I could with all the reasons of the world have made you patient, to stay so long, for the thankes I am to give you. Your present hath equally wherewith to content both the covetous and the vaine; it hath soliditie no lesse than lustre; the onely sight of it, refutes the modestie you use in speaking of it: you are injurious Madam, to so excellent a thing; it deserves the most stately inscription, you could devise to give it, and if I were worth the having of a Cabinet, this should be the prime piece, I would make choice of to adorne it. Because vulgar people have nothing but eyes, therefore they value nothing but Candlestickes of Crystall, and guilded vermillian dishes, but men of understanding, who see lesse with their eyes them with their spirits, they reflect upon objects,

that are more simple and immateriall, and preferre not the peoples errour, and Artificers fingers, before the truth of things, and before the Master-pieces of the workes of reason. Hee, to whom you did me the honour to send me, is farre above all the Encomiums I can give him: I have onely this to say Madam, that I have with me here, a famous Authour, who as soone as he hath once read him, is resolved instantly to shut up shop, and give over his Trade. He protests he will never more set hand to Penne, unlesse it be to signe his last Will; and therefore meanes to make you a sacrifice of all his Papers. I shewed him the incomparable Sonnet, De L'Amant qui meurt, at every verse, he called you Divine, and made such lowd Exclamations, that he might have beene heard to the great high way: which you know, how very farre it is from my Chamber. Hee sayth, he will maintaine it, even to the sheete Saint Jaques, that Parnassus is fallen upon the Distaffe, and that Racan hath given over the right he pretended in the succession of Mal

                           erbe. He speakes in this familiar manner, of these two great Personages; and I never heare him use any meaner style: if I can keepe him with me a while; I will tell you more of him, and promise you a collection of all his Apophthegms. I saw yesterday Monsieur de—who is a most just valuer of vertue, and by consequent, most perfectly reveres yours. He infinitely desires you would come amongst us, and that you would make choice of one of his

houses for your abode: if you were pleased to doe this, I should have no more journeys to make: I should be the happiest unhappie man that ever was, if I had you here to be my comforter, and that I might be alwayes telling you, that I alwayes am,

                     MAdam, you never heard speake of such a diligence, in two moneths your Letter hath gone twelve myles; so as a businesse that required hast, had been this way in a good case: and if therein you had given me advise for saving my life: I might have had good leisure to dio, before your advise came. I have made grievous complaints hereof, to my good kinswoman—who layes the fault of her fault upon a thousand that are innocent; upon her Gentlewoman, her Nurce, three maides, foure men, &amp;c. so as Madam, there have beene great arraignments upon this matter; and never was

any crime so long and so rigourously in examining; for my selfe, the joy I take to heare of your health, makes me forget my most just complaints, and sweetens all my choler. I thinke no more of the late receiving it; I content my selfe, that I have received it at last; and I finde enough in your Letter, to make me amends, for the slownesse of your messenger. Besides Madam, I give you to understand, that I have had some few dayes, with mee here, Monsieur Bardyn, as much as to say, The Living Philosophie: or Socrates risen from the dead. You make doubt perhaps, what the subject of our conference hath beene? Indeed Madam, it hath been your selfe, and we have concluded to erect your statue in the most eminent place of his Lycaeum: and if any Stoick come to new build the Particus, and any other to restore the Academie, no doubt but they will honour you with the like respect, and you shall alwayes be reverenced of wise men, next to wisedome it selfe. If you write shortly to—I entreat you Madam, to doe me the favour, to put in your packet the dispatch I send you.

                     MAdam, I am of your opinion, and can by no meanes approve the ambition of your fayre neighbour: her head is full of state and soveraigntie, and aymes certainly at a Crowne. God loves her too well to second her bad desires, and to give her that shee askes: so rare a beautie ought to be the recompence of vertue, and not the prey of Greatnesse: It is fit, that he who possesseth her, should understand, when things be excellent, should know the value of this, and all his life be thankfull to his good fortune for it: it is fitter to make a Gentleman happie, than to give contentment to a tyrant; fhee might perhaps be some amusement to him, when he were cloyed with killing of men; but withall, shee might be sure to be the next object of his crueltie, at the next fit of his wicked humour. You know the Story of Mariamne; our Theaters at this day sound forth nothing so much, as the cryes of this poore Princesse: hee that put her to death, loved her above measure, and after her death, kneeled downe a thousand times before her image, praying her to forgive him. Poppea was first the Mistris, afterwards the wife, and alwayes the Governesse of Nero; shee had vanquished this Monster, and made him tame, yet at last he slipt from

her, and in an instant of his choler, gave her a kicke upon the belly, which was her death. His unkle Caius dealt not so roughly with Caesonia, yet in the greatest heat of his fire, he made love to her in these termes: This fayre head shall be chopt off, as soone as I but speake the word: and told her sometimes, that he had a greater minde to put her on the racke, to make her tell him, why he loved her so much. The meaning Madam, of all this is, that the tamest of all Tygers is a cruell Beast, and that it is a most dangerous thing, to be woo

                     MY Lord, besides the thankes I owe you for my Head, I have a speciall charge from Madam de—to thanke you from her, and to give you a testimonie of your Coachmans skill. He is in truth, a great man in his profession; one might well trust him, and slip from hence to Paris: He glides by the brinke of Praecipices, and passeth broken bridges with an admirable dexteritie, say what you can of his manners otherwise; Pardon mee, my Lord, if I maintaine that they be no vices, and that you doe him great wrong to reproach him with them in your Letter. Hee doth that by designe, which you thinke hee doth by inclination, and because he hath heard, that a man once overthrew the Common-wealth, when he was sober, he thinkes, that to drinke well, is no ill qualitie to well governing: Hee takes otherwise no care for going astray, seeing he hath a God for his guide, and a God that was returned from the Indies before Alexander was come into the world. After so long a voyage, one may well trust Father Denys, with a short walke; and hee that hath tamed Tygers, may well be allowed to

mannage horses. Your Coach-man, my Lord, hath studied thus farre; and if they, who hold in their hands the reynes of the State, (to use the phrase of—) had beene as intelligent and dextrous as he, they would have runne their race with a better fortune, and our age should not have seene the fall of the Duke of—nor of the Earle of—: it is written to me from the Court, that—: These are the onely Newes I received by the last Post; but I send you, in their companie, the Booke you desired, which is as you know, the booke of the wickednesse of the world, and the ancient originall of all the moderne subtleties. The first Christians endevoured to suppresse it, and called it, Mendacoorum Loquacissemum: but men at this day, make it their Oracle, and their Gospell: and seeke in it rather for Sejanus and Tygellinus, to corrupt their innocency, than for Corbulo or Thraseus, to instruct them to vertue; at our next meeting wee shall talke more hereof: The great Personage I have praysed, stands in doubt, that his Encomium is at an end, and presseth me to conclude, that I am

                     SIR, I am sorry to heare of the continuance of your maladie, though I hope, it be not so great as you make it. These are fruits of this unseasonable time, and I doubt not, but your 
                           •…
                        leame, which overflowes with the rivers, will also with the fall of the rivers, returne againe to its naturall bounds. I have had my part in this inundation, and it would be no small commoditie to me, that things should stay in the state they now are in; for by this meanes, my house being made an Island, I should be lesse troubled, than now I am by people of the firme Land: But seeing upon the abating of the waters, depends the abating of your Rhume, I am contented with all my heart, they shall abate; a
                           •…
                         above all things desiring your health: yet withall, I must tell you, there is care to be used: you must absteine from all moyst meates, forbeare the good cheare of Paris; and follow the advise of an ancient sage, who counselled a man troubled with your disease, to change the rayne into drowth. You see how bold I am, to send you my praescriptions; I entreat you to follow them, but not to imitate me; for in this matter of Medicines, I confesse my selfe a Pharisee; I commend a Julippe to others, but

I drinke my selfe the Sweetest Wines. But to speake of something else, I cannot imagine, why Monsieur de—should keepe me languishing so long, and having made mee stand waiting three moneths after his time appointed, should now require a further prorogation; and a longer delay. For my part, I verily beleeve, he spake not in earnest, when he made you this untoward answer, and that it was rather for a tryall of your patience, than for an exercise: He hath the reputation of so honest and just a man, that I can make no doubt of that he hath promised to Monsieur de—and I am perswaded, he accounts himselfe more streightly tyed by his word, than by his bond. Monsieur the—beleeves that I have fingred my silver a yeare since, and you know it is a summe provided to stoppe three or foure of my Persecutours mouthes, who will never leave vexing you with their clamours day and night, till they be satisfied. It is therefore your part to use all meanes possible, to content them, at least if you love your libertie; and take not a pleasure to be every morning saluted with extreame unpleasing good morrowes. I expect hereupon to heare from you; and am

                           At Balzac, 17. Jan. 1630.
                        
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     To—. LETTER XLVII.
                     SIR, you are too just to desire such duties from a sicke friend, as you would exact from one that were in health. The reasons I can give of my silence, are much juster than I would they were, and me thinkes, three moneths continuing in a Feaver, may well dispense with any obligation whatsoever of a civill life. Yet seeing you will needs have me speake, I cannot but obey you, though I make use of a strangers hand to quarrell with you. I cannot endure the dissimulation you shew, in doubting of my affection, and of the truth of my words. I understand no jeasting on that side; these are Games that I am uncapable to learne, and in matter of friendship, I am of that tendernesse, that I am even wounded with that, which is perhaps intended but for a tickling. I perceive I have beene complained upon to you, but I entreat you to beleeve, it hath been upon very false grounds; and I require no better justifier, than her owne conscience that accuseth mee. Within a few dayes, I will come my selfe in person, and give you an account of all my actions; and will trayne my selfe

on to Paris, in hope to enjoy the happinesse of your companie. In the meane time, be carefull to cure the maladie you tell me of, which brings us forth such goodly Sonnets, and makes so well agree the two greatest enemies that are in Nature, I meane, Passion and Judgement: so I bid you Farewell; and am with all my heart,
                     
                        Your, &amp;c.

                     To Monsieur de Coignet. LETTER XLVIII.
                     SIR, I am much bound unto you for your writing to me, and for sending me Newes that exceedingly pleaseth mee. You may well thinke, I have no mind to crosse my own good; and to refuse giving my consent to the Earle of Exceters request. To have so illustrious an Interpreter in England, is morethan a full revenge upon all the petty Scribes that oppose mee in France: it is the crowning and triumph of my writings. I am not therefore so a Philosopher, that I place the honour he doth mee, amongst things indifferent, but rather to tell you plainly, I have perhaps received too sensible a contentment in it; and upon the poynt of falling againe

into my old desire of glory; of which I thought my selfe to have been fully cured: I send you a word, which I entreat you to deliver to him, which shall witnesse for mee, how deare and glorious, the markes he gives mee of his love and account, are unto mee; Otherwise Sir, I doubt not, but I owe a great part of this good fortune to the good opinion you have of me, which is to be seene in every lyne of your Letter; and that you have confirmed the English in this Error, which is so much in my favour. Onely I entreat you, never to seeke to free them of this errour, but so to deale with them, that if you convert them from other, it may still be with reservation of this. The truth in question is of so small importance, that it deserves not any curious examination; and in which, to be in a wrong beliefe, makes not a man to be either lesse honest, or more unfortunate: Never therefore, make scruple to oblige me, seeing you shall oblige a thankfull man, and one who is;
                     
                        Sir,  
                        Your, &amp;c.

                     To Monsieur de Neusuic. LETTER XLIX.
                     SIR, If I were onely blind, I would try to make some answer, to the good words of your Letter; but the paine, which my ill eyes put me to, makes mee uncapable of this pleasing contention: and I cannot draw from my head, in the state it now is, any thing else but Water and Waxe. And besides the unhappie blindnesse I speake of, I am in such sort overflowed with Rheumes; that if it were in the time of the old Metamorphoses, I thinke verily, I should be turned into a Fountaine, and become the subject of some new Fable. I have lost as well my smelling, as my taste; my Nose can make no difference betweene Spanish Leather, and an old Cowes hide: and I sneeze so continually; that all my conversation, is but to say, I thanke you; to them that say, God helpe you. Being in this estate, doe you not wonder, I write unto you, and have the boldnesse to be sending Letters? In truth, never complement cost me so deare as this, and if I would make use of the priviledge of sicke men, I might very justly require a Dispensation; but I had not the power, to let your servant goe away, without telling you, that you are a very honest Impostour; and that the Perigurain you send, is the most refined Frenchman that ever ranne

afoote to Paris. It must needs be, that the people of your Village is a Colonie of the Louver, that hath preserved the first puritie of their language amidst the corruption of their Neighbours. There never were such fine things written upon the banke of Dordonne; at least, not since the death of Monsieur de Montaigne, yet I esteeme them not so much, because they are so fine, as because they come from you, whose I passionately am,

                        Your, &amp;c.

                     To Madam Desloges. LETTER L.
                     MAdam, I am alwayes of your minde; and like not Ladies that would be Cavaliers. There are certain bounds that part us, and ma
                           •…
                         us out our several duties and conditions: which neither you nor we can lawfully passe. And the lawes of Decencie are so ancient, that they seem

to be a part of the ancient religion. Moses hath extended the commandements of God, even to the distinction of your apparell, and ours: and you know hee expresly forbids to disguise our selves in one anothers cloathes. Women must be altogether women: the vertues of our sex, are not the vertues of theirs; and the more they seeke to imitate men, the more they degenerate from their owne kinde. We have had some women amongst us, that would ride Spanish horses would discharge Pistols, and would be parties in maintaining quarrels. M. the Marshall Scomberg shewed mee once a letter which he writ to a Gentleman of—at the end whereof were these words; I kisse the hands of this valiant and pleasing Lady, that is your second in the day, and your wife at night. This Lady might perhaps bee valiant, but to my humour, she could not be pleasing. If she had had abeard, she could not have had a greater fault. Women that are valiant, are as much to blame, as men that are cowards. And it is as unseemly for Ladies to weare swords by their sides, as for Gentlemen to have glasses hanging at their girdles. I professe my selfe an enemy, Madam, to these usurpations of one sex upon another. It strikes me with a kinde of horrour, when I reade in historie of the ancient women Fencers, whom the Romanes beheld with such pleasure in their Amphitheater; and I account not Amazons in the number of women, but of Monsters and Prodigies. Sweetnesse and tendernesse are the qualities that belong to you

and will your she Friend give over her claime to these, that is, to the succession of her mother, and the priviledges of her birth? will she not be as well content as you, with the partition which Nature herselfe hath made? I cannot conceive with what face she can goe a hunting amongst such violence &amp; tumults, and how she can run hallowing all day, till shee bee out of breath, after a kennell of Hounds, and a troope of Huntesmen. God made her for the Closet, and not for the Field: and in truth, it is a great sin to distend so handsome a mouth, and to disfigure so comely a face, with blowing a horne. To expose such excellent things to all the boughes of the Forrest, and to all the injuries of the weather; and to endanger such pretious colours with winde and raine, with the sunne and dust. And yet, Madam, to see hunting, without being a partie, to goe in Coach, and in Parkes inclosed, where a multitude of beasts are kept prisoners, and come to dye at Ladies feet, such a recreation as this, I doe not condemne, being onely entertained with the eyes, and may passe either for a spectacle, or a walke; and is as farre from agitation as from rest. But this serves not her turne, she calles these but lazie and sedentarie recreations, and takes no pleasure, but when it is with hazard of her life. But what would be thought Madam, if one should come and tell you, shee is slaine with a fall, by ranke riding, or that shee hath met with a wilde Boare, that was too hard for her? In such cases, ther
                           •…
                         would not

onely be no excuse for her death, but it would bee a blot upon her memory for ever: and to save her honour, there must bee feigned some other accident in her Epitaph. As for that other discoursing Lady you complaine of, and whom I know, she commits not, in truth, such extravagant faults as this doth; yet shee hath her faults too: and I can no more allow of women to bee Doctors, than of women to bee Cavaliers. She should take you for a pateme, and make profit of the good example you give. You know indeed, an infinite number of excellent things; but you make no open profession of your knowledge, as shee doth, and you shew, you have not learned them to keepe a schoole. You speake to her, when shee preacheth to you, and making popular answeres to her riddles, and giving distinction to her confusion: you doe her at least, this good office, to expound her to her selfe. Neither in the tune of your voyce, nor in the manner of your expressing, is any thing seen in you, but that which is naturall and French: and although your spirit bee of an extreame high clevation, and farre above the ordinarie reach, yet you so accomodate it to the capacitie of all that heare you, that whilest the meaner sort doe understand you, the more able spirits doe admire you. It is a great matter, Madam, to have gotten the knowledge of such excellent things: but it is a greater matter so to hide them, as if they were stollen, and to call them, as you doe, by the name of your secret

Particularly I desire to know, whether you bee yet a Grand-mother in Holland: and whether my Ladie, your daughter in law, have brought you Captaines or Senatours, at least, Madam, they shall bee children much bound to their mother; seeing, besides their birth, they shall owe her for their libertie, a thing they should not doe to a Fleming of Bruxels. I have seene the Cavalier you have so often spoken of, and I thinke you judge verie rightlie of him. Hee consists wholly of a Pickedevant, and two Mustachoes: and therefore utterly to defeate him, there needes but three clippes of a paire of Cizers. It is not possible to bring one——to bee afraid of him. Hee sayth, that if he wore a Lions skinne, and carried in one hand a Torch, and in the other a Clubbe, yet in such equipage hee would bee more ridiculous than redoubtable. Hee beleeves hee hath choler enough, but beleeves not hee hath any heart; hee reckons him, in the number of beasts that are skittish and resty, but not that are cruell and furious: And when I tell him, he hath been often in the field; hee answeres me, it hath been then, rather to feed, than to fight. You can, if you please, returne mee a hundred fold for this my untoward short relation: and it will bee: long of you, if my man come not back laden with histories, which must certainly have been written to you by the

                     MAdam, my deere Cousin; There is nothing heard in all quarters, but benedictions and prayses, which our poore pleaders give you. They invocate you, as their Redeemer; and if Themis be the goddesse of good causes, you, it seemes, are the goddesse of good successe. For my selfe, I have knowne a long time, that you are powerfull in perswasion, and never speake without prevayling. This is the cause, why I have promised Monsieur de—, not that you shall sollicite for him, but that you shall speed for him; and I am this day warranted of the Event. I could tell you, to make you respect him the more, that he is able to thanke you, in five or six languages; that

But I will content my selfe to say, that he is my friend, and your Oratour: that if my commendation, and your own glory be deare unto you, you cannot but very shortly send him backe with full satusfactuib, I promised to send you the two Sonnets, you have heard so much spoken of, but my bad memory, makes me fayle in a part of my promise, and I can send you, but one and a halfe:

                     The Authour of this last Sonnet, hath made one in Spanish, which in the Court of Spaine, goes under the Name of Lopez de Vega, and another in Italian, which Marino verily beleeved, he had read in Petrarke; It is a Spirit, that changeth himselfe at pleasure, and transformes himselfe into what shape he list: yet he deserves better prayses than this, and his Morall qualities are nothing behinde his Intellectuall: I will tell you his Name, when it shall be lawfull to love him openly, and to make his Encomium without soruple.

                     To Madam de Campagnole. LETTER LIII.
                     MY most deare Sister, I send you the Book which you required of mee, for my Niece, and I beleeve, that this and her Prayer-Booke, make her whole Librarie: shee shall finde in it, a Devotion that is not too mysticall, nor too much refined; and which hath nothing but Morall and reasonable. I like this popular Divinitie, which meets us halfe way, and stoops a little, that we may not strayne our selves too much. It followes the example of its Authour, who made himselfe familiar with common people, and put not backe so much as Courtisans and Publicans, farre from making division in families, and withdrawing women from obedience to their mothers, and their husbands. It commends this obedience, as their principall verue, and calles it a second worship, and a second religion. I shall be glad to see my Neece make profession of a pietie, so conformable to naturall reason, and so good a counsellour of all other duties. But let her not, I pray, climbe higher, and undertake Meditations of her owne head: Grenada whom I sent her, hath taken this paines for her, and hath meditated for her, and for all other that shall reade his Bookes. There is nothing more dangerous, than to

mount up to Heaven without a helper and a guide; and it is a great confidence, one must have in his Spirit, to let it goe so farre, and be assured, it will ever come backe againe. It is not long agoe, there was in a Towne of Spaine, a Societie of devoted persons, who continued in meditation so many houres a day, leaving off all base works, to live, as they sayd, a more heavenly life; but what thinke you, became of it? even a thousand domesticall disorders, and a thousand publike extravagancies. The lesse credulous, tooke the pricke of a pinne, for a Saints marke, the more humble, accounted their husbands prophane; the wiser sort, spake what came in their heads, and made faces perpetually. In so much, that when in the moneth of May, there did not past three or foure runne madde; it was counted a good yeare. It is fit to stay ones selfe upon the true vertue, and not to follow the vaine Phantasmes of holinesse. And it is farre safer, to ground ones selfe upon a solid and certaine reading, than to goe wandring in a hollow, and unsteady contemplation. If I had more time, you should have more words; but hee that brings you the letter, calls upon mee for it, and I can no more to it, but that I perfectly am

                     MY dearest Sister, all the world tells me
                           •…
                        , that my Niece is fayre, and you may beleeve, I will challenge no man, for saying so. Beautie is in Heaven a qualitie of those glorious bodies, and in Earth the most visible marke that comes from Heaven. It is not fit therefore to slight these gifts of God, nor to make small account of this sparke of the life to come: It is not fit to be of so crosse an humour, to blame that which is generally praysed. Marke when a comely personage comes in place, having but this advantage of her birth, you shall presently see all that were talking, to hold their peace; and what noyse soever there was before, you shall have all husht, and an universall calme upon a suddaine: you shall see a whole great multitude, all busie in different labours, to make presently but one body, and that onely to stand to gaze and wonder: some leave to make up the reckoning they had begunne, some curtoll their complements, and cut them off in the midst; every man puts off his conceits to some other time, onely to take a

full view, and to contemplate this divine thing that presents it selfe. If it be at a Sermon, they leave hearkening to the Preacher, and they are no longer the auditours of M. de Nantes, but the spectatours of Calista. The fayre can never be seene without respect, without prayses, without acclamations. They triumph, as often as they appeare, and their youth hath not mor
                           •…
                         dayes, than their beautie hath Festivalls. But the mischiefe is, my deere Sister, that the Festivals are short, the youth is not lasting, and the fayre at last come to be ill favoured. Queenes and Princesses grow old, and there is no old beautie, but that of God, of the Sunne, and of the Starres. These heads that now have neither skinne, nor flesh, nor hayre; These carkasses and dry bones have beene in their time, the divinities and wonders of the world: and was heretofore called the Dutchesse of Valentinois, the Dutchesse of Beaufort, the Marquis of—: Besides there may happen diseases, which will doe old ages worke before hand, and are oftentimes more gastly than death it selfe. Wee are frighted sometimes to see the spoyle and ruines of Faces, upon which the foote of sicknesse hath troaden, and there is nothing, in which wee may more observe the lamentable markes of the inconstancie of humane things. From hence I conclude, that beautie being a thing so frayle and tender, subject to so many accidents, and so hard to keepe; it is fit wee should seeke after another beautie,

that is more firme and permament, that can better withstand corruption, and better defend it selfe against the force of time. Above all, it is not fit, that women should be proud of a qualitie, that is infamous for the losses and wracks of many poore Consciences, and which as innocent and chast as it can be, will yet be a cause to rayse in others, a thousand fowle desires, and a thousand unhallowed and wicked thoughts. Say, my Niece hath some thing in her that is pleasing, some thing that is fayre and beautifull, as her friends conceive, yet shee ought alwayes to be afraid of such a good, that is so dangerous for doing hurt to others. I set before her eyes, the sad Picture of that which shee shall be hereafter; to the end, shee may not grow proud of that which shee is now. There is no hurt in meditating a little upon this poynt. But allow her the libertie wee even now tooke from her; yet withall, put her alwayes in minde, that of the foure beauties I have shewed her in my Tasso; there is but one of them, that will be a fit example for her to follow. Shee must leave Armida and Erminia, for the Gallants of the Court, Clorinda is for the valourous men of Gascoigne, and Perigord; but shee that I propose for her Patterne, is Sophronia. And if shee have not courage enough to say to the Tyrant, as shee sayd, It is I that am the Delinquent you looke for; let her at least, have the other conditions, that are necessary to the being her follower,

and imitate her in them. This fayre Saint made profession of modestie, and neglected her beautie; shee was alwayes, eyther hidden under a veile, or shut up in her Chamber, and all the world might suspect her to be fayre; but there was scarce any at all that knew it but her mother. Shee had no designe to entrappe any mans libertie, and therefore layd not her snares in their way, nor went to Church to see and to be seene. My deare sister, I cannot choose, but take upon me here to be a reformer of corrupt manners, and make my complaint to you, of a Custome, which as well as many other naughtie things, the Court hath cast upon us. What reason is there in the world, that women should enter into holy places, of purpose to draw upon them, the view and attention of the Company? as much as to say, to trouble and disturbe the whole devotion of a Towne, and to doe as bad, or worse, as those buyers and sellers did, whom Christ whipped out of the Temple? By this meanes, good actions become evill, and Pietie comes to have no better odour before the Altaus, than Perfumes that are mustie and corrupted. Women now adayes, are bound to be seene to be at Church; and this very desire of being seene there, is the ordinary prophanation of the place where they are seene. And in truth, seeing this place is particularly called the House of God, what is it but to vilifie God, even in the highest degree, to come and offend at his owne doores, and as it were to his

face? It is even as great an Impudency, as that of the first Angells, who sinned in Paradise. Yet herein certainly, the Italian women are more pardonable than the French; for they indeed, have no other breathing time of their unfortunate libertie, being at all other times, kept up as slaves and prisoners: but in France, where women are not denyed the company and visits of honest men, they can have nothing to say, in justification of this incontinency of their eyes, and of this unsufferable vanitie, to seeke to part stakes with God, in mens vowes, and to share with him in his publike Adoration. You little thought this morning to heare a Preacher, and I as little thought to be one, but as you see, the zeale of Gods House, hath brought mee to it; and finding my selfe at leisure, I was desirous to bestow part of it upon you. The Text was given mee yesterday, by the company that was here; where my Nieces beautie was so much extolled, that, sending you Newes, which are to her so glorious, I thought fit, to send her withall, a cooling, to keepe her glorying in some temper: and so my deare Sister, I take my leave, and am with all my soule,
                     
                        Your, &amp;c.
                        
                           At Bolzac, 3. May. 1635.
                        
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     Another to her. LETTER LV.
                     MY dearest sister, having both of us but one passion, it makes us alwayes talking of one thing. My Neece is the subject of all our Letters, as she is the object of all our cares. For my owne part, I see not a good or a bad example, which I make not use of, for her instruction, and endevour to imploy it to her profit. You remember a woman the other day, who values nothing, likes of nothing, excuses nothing; and let her be in the best &amp; most pleasing company that may be, yet she is sureto put them all into dumpes and melancholy. You can come on no side of her, but she pricks and bites: all her coasts are craggie and rockie. And it was not without cause my brother sayd, that if the man you wot of, had married her, there would certainly have nothing come of that marriage, but Teeth and Nayles. It is impossible to live in peace with such a savadge chastitie. I make no more reckoning of it, than of that of the Furies, whom the ancient Poets call virgines, and wonder not, that women of this humour, love no man, seeing they hate the whole world.

This sad and sullen poyson taking up all the roome in their soules, leaves no place at all for other passions that are sweet and pleasing. They flye pleasures, rather by having their mouth out of taste, than by having their judgement in perfection: and are so continually fretting, that they have no leasure at any time to be merrie. As long as they bee chaste, they thinke they may lawfully bee discourteous, and scratch men, so they doe not kisse them. They have a conceit, that by wanting one vice, they have presently all vertues: and that for a little good fame they gaine to their husbands, they may keepe them under yoake, and affront all mankinde. It is true, the losse of a womans honour is the greatest disgrace she can possibly incurre; and which once lost, shee hath nothing left her that is worth the keeping: But yet it followes not, that the preserving it, is any such royall act; and I doe not admire any, for not being willing to live in misery and disgrace. I never heard, that a woman should bee praised, for not falling in the fire, or for not casting her selse downe a rock. We condemne the memorie of them that kill themselves; but we give no reward to them that preserve themselves. And so indeed it is, a woman that magnifies her selfe for being chaste, magnifies herselfe for not being dead, and for having a qualitie, without which she were as good bee out of the world, seeing shee stayes not in it, but for a plague to her name, and to

see her owne infamie. I say yet more, that shee ought not so much to consider the vice as an evill thing, as to consider it as an inpossible thing, and not to have it so much in detestation, as in ignorance. For indeed, if a woman bee truly vertuous. shee will sooner believe there are Meremaids and Centaures, than that there are any dishonest women: but will rather conceive that the world is given to slandering, and that Fame is a lyer, than that her neighbour is false and disloyall to her husband: though with her owne eyes she should see the fault committed, yet it is her part to suspect her eyes mere mistaken, and that it was but an illusion which she saw; at least, shee should never give sentence upon this sort of delinquents, seeing Christ himselfe would not doe it to the adulterous woman. When others wrong a woman, it is her part to be sorrie: and when others say, she hath beene unfaithfull, it may bee enough for her to say, she hath beene unfortunate. And yet more than this too, I could wish, if it were possible, that where shee findes most weaknesse, there she should make report of most goodnesse: und I would no
                           •…
                        , that vertue should beget this bad qualitie. It is an enemie to societie, and deserves not to have so good a mother: and one may well flie and blame the vice, so as the flying it, bee without oftentation, and the blaming it be without choler. For otherwise, it would bee as much as to require a statue for doing nothing: and in

the smart of the punishment, to seeke for the pleasure of revenge. An honest woman reformes the world by the example of her life, and not by the violence of her spirit. She ought not to proclaime warre against any; not against the most indiscreet and insolent: and if there chance any licentious or uncivill word to be uttered in her hearing, she ought to checke it, either by giving no care, or by falling into some other discourse, or by casting upon the speaker a beame of modestie, that may cover his confusion, and pierce his very soule: and thus she shall use a chastising without offending. There is as well a severitie in modestie, as a sweetnesse; and which keeps insolence it selfe in awe: and a woman that carries this excellent vertue in her eyes, keepes men within the bounds of their dutie, without ever falling into out-rage, or into words of choler. Other vertues are hidden, and have nothing in them that is visible, or that falls under sence. This This vertue hath a body of light, and riseth up into the face, in those pretty straines, which bashfulnesse that is her usher, as Aurora is the Sunnes, sends up: into it. And in truth, the Purple, whereof the Poets speake, which appeares at the breake of day, is nothing so rich and glorious, as that which is disclosed in an honestie a little bashfull; the effect whereof in noble tempers is not an over-flowing of blood, but onely one single drop well husbanded. It is not a masse of red, which sets the face on fire.

It is onely a first impression, and as it were, a shadow of tincture, that lightly colours it. This honest blush, which is so pleasing a thing in maydens faces, and which I distinguish from that, which is sottish and untoward, is a barre, and sufficient defence against the audaciousnesse of the most impudent; and when it is seen to shine in a womans looke, there is no licentiousnesse that is not dazeled with it, and is not stopt from daring to proceed. And therefore there is no necessitie of using any straining of the voyce, any churlishnesse of words, or any agitation of gestures, to doe that, which may better be done by silence, and with quietnesse. And indeed women are bound, if for nothing else, yet for the very interest of their beauty, to shunne a passion, that makes such villanous faces, and sets so many wrinkles upon their countenance. I have heard some of them complaine, that the sent of a Rose was too strong, and that Muske made their heads ake, because it had not milde sweetnesse enough: and why then will they not take that sweetnesse into themselves, which they seek for so much in other things? and finde fault with the want of it, in that Art, which proposeth to it selfe no other end? If without this sweetnesse, there grow from the most pretious odours, a certaine qualitie which offends them; and if there bee some Flowers, and some perfumes that please them not, what likelihood is there, that Brimstone and Salt-peter can please them, and that

their humour can have any thing common with these violent substances? It is true perhaps, that sweetnesse and mildnesse have their excesses; but yet, even those excesses are more lawfull, than the justest temper of shrewishnesse and incivilitie; at least in a woman, they are much more commendable: and it becomes her better to dissemble that shee knowes, than to discover verities that are odious: and better she should be thought to come out of another world, than to carry to a man the first newes of her stinking breath; and teach another to know the infirmitio of her race, which perhaps hee knew not before. These liberties are not sufferable in the freest conversations, they draw on other more dangerous liberties; and though your sex be inviodable, and have the priviledge of sanctuarie, yet prophane persons stick not to lay hands on the Saints themselves, and on their Altars, and nothing is so sacred, that can escape the hand of sacriledge. Onely those persons that can revenge offences, may venture to give offences; and a man that will give the lye, must be of a condition to fight a Duell, &amp; maintain it by Armes. My Neece hath no great need of these precepts, nor indeed of any forraigne instruction; she cannot wander from the right, if she goe not astray from her owne inclination; nor can be troublesome to others, if she borrow not a vice which is none of her owne. I have therefore represented to her, the woman of the other day: but after their example,

who shewed their slaves drunke to their children, and that is to make her afrayd of fil
                        
                           •…
                        hy objects, and to make that hatefull to her, which is not in it selfe lovely; to confirme her in the principles which you have taught her, and to draw her out some rules from her own actions: she is (I know) naturally good; but the best natures have need of some method to guide them, and direction doth never any hurt to vertue: she is able to keepe herselfe in termes extreamly obliging, without ever falling into the basenesse of flatterie: She is able to please without colloguing; and though shee call not every thingby the right name, nor bee so very curious to speake in proper termes, yet her stile shall not for that, bee the lesse liked, nor her companie the lesse desired. She may call them wise that want the reputation of beeing valiant; and women that are sad, she may say they are serious. If a man bee not of a quicke spirit, she may say, he is of a good judgement: and if one bee unfortunate in his actions she may say, he hath a good meaning in his counsails. But yet in this there is a measure to bee held, and a choyce must bee made, in laying her colours, that shee seeke not to disguise all sorts of subjects: for there are some indeed that are not capable: of disguising. Those that are pale, she may praise for their whitenesse: but those that have a dropsie, she must not praise for their fatnesse: shee may say, that scruple is a bud of pietie. But shee must not say, that prophanenesse

is an effect of Philosophie. Shee may make a favourable construction of things doubtfull, and sweeten the rigour of particular judgements; but shee must not contend against common sence, nor bee opposite to verities that are publicke and manifest. Shee must make a difference betweene errours and crimes, betweene a docible simplicitie and a presumptuous stupiditie, betweene sots that are honest, and those that are wicked. And if shee happen to bee in companie, where some weake spirit is oppressed, as the world is full of such that will triumph over the weake, and take no pittie of any, shee must then, by all meanes, bee a protectresse of such a one, and make herselfe a Sanctuarie for all those, whom stronger adversaries would otherwise ruine. This onely is to bee observed, that shee so undertake the maintaining of weake causes, that it may appeare by the tune of her voyce, that it proceedes from excesse of goodnesse, and not from want of knowledge: and that shee compassionates humane infirmities by an act of charitie, makes not herselfe a partie by false perswasion. I am now at the end of my paper; and should have beene a good while since at the end of my letter: but I alwayes forget my selfe when I am with you, and never thinke howres shorter, than those I bestow upon your memorie. And so my

deare sister, I bid you farewell, not without great longing to see you: and if you and all your company come not hither the next week, I proclaime it to you, that I am no longer

                     To my Lord the Cardinall, Duke of Richelieu. LETTER I.
                     
                        MY Lord, being stayed here by some occasions, I suffer this hard necessitie with a great deale of paine, and account my selfe banished from my Countrey, being so long a time deprived of your presence. I deny not, but the victorious and triumphant Newes, that comes continually from the Armie, gives me some resentment of joy, and that

the brute of your Name in all quarters, toucheth me very sensibly; but it is no perfect satisfaction to me, to learne that by others relating, which I ought to know as an eye-witnesse, and I conceive so great a pleasure to consist, in the sight of your glory, that there is not a common Souldier under your Command, whose happinesse and good fortune, I doe not envie. But my Lord, though I cannot serve you with my bodily actions, yet I revere you day and night, with the thoughts of my minde, and in this so worthy an imployment, I never thinke the noblest part of my selfe, can doe service enough. Your Lordship, next to the King, is the eternall object of my spirit, I never turne my eyes from the course of your life; and if perhaps, you have Courtiers more officious than my selfe, and such as doe their duties with greater oftentation and shew, yet I am most sure, you have no servant that is more faithfull, and whose affection comes more truely from his heart, and is fuller of life and vigour. But to the end, my words may not be thought vaine, and without ground, I send you now a proofe of that I say, by which, you shall perceive, that a man that is himselfe perswaded, hath a great disposition to perswade others, and that a Discourse, founded upon the things themselves, and 
                           •…
                        ated with the truth, both stirres mens spirits with greater force, and also begets a firmer beliefe, than that which is but feigned, and comes but in the nature of Declayming. This, my Lord,

is a part drawne out from the whole bodie, and a piece, which I have taken most paines to polysh; which, I freely vow unto you, that all the houres of a calmer leisure than mine, and all the powers of a more elevated spirit than ordinary, would have found worke enough, to bring to perfection. In it, there is handled, Of the vertue, and victories of the King; Of the Justice of his Armes; Of Royaltie and Tyrannie; Of usurpers and lawfull Princes; Of Rebellion chastened, and libertie mainteined; but because the Prince I speake of, is a stirrer, and makes no stay any where, and that in following him, I should imbarque my selfe in a world of severall subjects; I have therefore, prescribed to my selfe certaine bounds, which in his actions, I should never have met with: and after the example of Homer, who finished his Ilias with the death of Hector, though that were not the end of the warre; I have thought fit, not to goe further, than the taking of Suze, though this were but the beginning of the wonders, wee have seene of his. You know my Lord, that this kinde of writing, which I propose to my selfe, is without comparison, the most painfull of all other; and that it is a hard matter, to continue long in an action that must be violent, and to be violent in an action that must continue long. This prayse belongs properly to Oratours, I meane such as know how to perswade, how to please in profiting, and can make the people capable of the secrets of

Governning a Common-wealth. For as for Philosophers, that have written of this argument, their discourse is commonly so drie and meager, that it appeares, their intention was rather to instruct, than to reconcile; and besides, their style is so thornie and cumbersome, that it seemes they meant to teach none, but the learned. And in this, there is no more difficultie, than there is in healing of men that be in health. And for a man, to make himselfe obscure, there needs no more, but to stay upon the first notions wee have of truth, which are never, eyther wholly pure, or purely mingled, and which falling from the imagination upon paper, leave upon it such a confusion, that it resembles rather an informed abortion, than a perfect production. Besides, in the composition of a Historie, especially where the Politiques have to doe, an Authour is carried, and borne out by his matter, and the things being all made to his hand, which case him of the paines of invention, as the order of the time caseth him of the care of disposing; he hath little to doe for his part, but onely to contribute words, which is by some made so small a matter, that when Menander was pressed by some friends to publish a worke of his, that he had promised: He made answere, it shall presently come forth; for it is in a manner all finished and ready, there wants nothing, but to make the words. But in the perswasive kinde of writing, (besides, that there must be a better

choice made, and a stricter order used, in placing the words, than in simple Narrations, which for all their lustre and riches of expression, require no more but plainnesse, and fit termes) they which desire to attaine perfection, or indeed to doe any thing at all of worth, endeavour all they can, to put in use, and reduce to action, the most subtle Idaea's of all Rhetoricke; to rayse up their understanding to the highest poynt of things; to search out, in every matter, the verities lesse exposed to view, and to make them so familiar, that they who perceived them not before, may by their relation come as it were to touch them. Their designe is, to joyne pleasure to profit, to mingle daintinesse and plentie together; and to fight with Armes, not onely firme and strong, but also fayre and glittering. They endeavour to civilize Learning; drawing it from the Colledge, and freeing it from the hands of Pedants, who marre and sully it in handling: and to say the truth, adulterate and corrupt it, abusing this excellent and delicate thing in the sight of all the world. They seeke not to avoyde Rockes by turning aside from them, but rather by slyding gently over them, and rather to escape places of danger, than to shunne them. And to make it appeare, that nothing is so sowre or bitter, but that it may be sweetned and allayed by Discourse. Finally, they suffer themselves sometimes to be transported with that reasonable fury, which Rhetoricians have well

knowne, though it goe beyond their Rules and Precepts: which thrust an; Oratour into such strange and uncouth motions, that they seeme rather inspired, than to be naturall; and with which, Demosthenes and Cicero were so possessed, that the one of them sweares by those that dyed at Marathon, and of his owne authoritie makes them Gods: the other, askes questions of the Hilles and Forrests of Alba, as if they had eares, and were able to heare him. But if I were one that did come any thing neere so noble an end, (which I neither will nor dare beleeve) and that I were able to make strangers see, that all things in France are changed for the better, since the happie Reigne of our King, who no lesse augmenteth our spirits, than he encreaseth our courage: yet it is not I that should merit the glory of this, but I must wholly attribute it to the happinesse of my time, and to the force of my object. Howsoever, my Lord, if I cannot be taken into the List of learned and able men, at least, I cannot be denyed a place amongst honest men, and loyall servants; and if my abilities be worthy of no consideration with you, at least, my zeale and affection, are better worth, than to be rejected. With which meditation, I am sometimes so ravished, that I doubt not, but my resentments must needs content you; and that it is no unpleasing recreation to you, to cast your eye upon a Philosopher in choler. And though true love content it selfe with the testimony of its owne

Conscience; and that I give you many proofes of my most humble service, which I assure my selfe, will never come to your knowledge; yet for your satisfaction, I desire you might heare me sometimes in the place where you are, and might see, with what advantage, I maintaine the publike cause, in what manner I controll false Newes that runs about, and how I stop their mouthes that will be talking in disparagement of our affayres. It is certaine, that it is not possible our State should be more flourishing than it is, or that the successe of the Kings Armes should be more glorious than it is, or that the Peace of the People should be more assured than it is, or that your Government should be more judicious than it is; and yet wee meete with certaine spirits, that are troubled with their owne quietnesse, are impatient of their owne felicitie, cannot be held in any good beliefe, but by prosperities that are supernaturall; and longer than they see miracles, give no credit to any thing. If present affayres be in good termes, then they cast out feares of those to come; and when they see, the events prove happie, then they fall affrighting us with Presages. They take an Oath, to esteeme of no persons, but forreyners; of no things, but farre fet. They admire Spinola, because he is an Italian, and their enemie; they cannot abide to prayse the King, because he is a Frenchman, and their Master. They will hardly be drawne to confesse, that the King hath overcome, though they

see before their eyes, an infinite number of Townes taken; of Factions ruinated; eternall Monuments of his Victories: and more easily the King hath gotten the applause of all Europe, than these mens approbation. They would perswade us, if they could, that he had raysed his Siege before Rochell; That he had made a shamefull Peace with the Protestants; and that the Spaniards had made him run away. They doe all they can, to exterminate his History, and to extinguish the greatest light that shall ever shine to posteritie. I doubt not, but they cast a malicious eye upon my Booke; for presenting an image of those things which offend them so much. And they who beleeve Fables and Romances, and are in passion, for an Hercules or an Achilles, who perhaps never were; They who reade with extasie of joy, the actions of Rowland and of Reinold, which were never done, but upon Paper: These men will finde no rellish in a true History, because it gives testimonie to the vertue of their naturall King. They can like well enough, that against the credit of all Antiquitie, Xenophon being a Graecian, and no Persian, should frame Cyrus a life after his owne fancie, and make him die in his bed, and amongst his Friends; when yet hee dyed in the warres, and overcome by a woman: and they can like well enough, that Plinie should tell a lye in open Senate, and prayse Trajan for temperance and chastitie, who yet was given to wine, and to another vice so fowle

that it cannot honestly be named; but they can by no meanes like, that I, who am the Kings subject born, should say that of him, which no man can deny to be most true, and that being to make a patern for Princes, I should rather make choyce of his life, than either of that of Cyrus, which is fabulous, or that of Trajan, which is not the purest, that I may not speake of that of Caesar Bogia, which is all blacke with licentiousnesse and crimes. Heaven it selfe is not able to give this kinde of people a Governour to their minde. Hee that was according to Gods owne heart, should not be according to theirs: They would not thinke Salomon wise enough, nor Alexander valiant enough. They are generally enemies of all sorts of Masters; and accusers of all things the present time affoords. They make our heads ake with crying out, that there was no necessitie to make a war in Italy; but if you had stayed still at Paris, they would have cryed out much lowder, that it had not been honest, to suffer our allyes to perish. Because some of our Kings have made unfortunate voyages beyond the mountaines, therefore they will needs have it, that our King, though he follow not their counsels, should yet fall into their misfortunes. They accuse your conduct with old proverbs, because they cannot with sound reasons. They say, Italy is the Church-yard of the French: and being not able to observe the least fault in all your carriage in that countrey, they lay upon you the

faults of our aunestors, and charge you with the errour of Charles the eighth. Yet I conceive that these mens sinne is rather of infirmitie than of malice, that they are rather passionate for their opinions, than Pensioners of our enemies; and that they have more need of helpe by Physicke, than of restraint by law. But it is a grievous thing to see, how the busie-bodies of our time, speake the same language, which Rebels did in times past; and abuse the happinesse of libertie, even against him, who hath procured it unto us. They come continually, and tell me, wee are like to receive much prejudice by the discontent of such a Prince, that is gone from our side. And I answere them, it is better to have a weake enemie that cannot hurt us, than hold a troublesome friend, that would doe us no good. They will by all meanes, that the King at any price, should succour Cazall; and I tell them, that he hath succoured it alreadie, by his conquest of Savoy: and that in the state as things now stand, it cannot bee taken, but to be delivered backe. They are not contented that you performe actions that are extraordinarie, they looke you should performe some that are impossible: And though there arise sometimes such difficulties in things, that they cannot by any possibilitie be encountred; I say not, by defect in the undertaker, but by reason of repugnancie in the subject; yet they will not take for payment, such reasons as wise men are satisfied withall, but they would have the King doe

that, which the Turke and Persian joyned together, were not able to doe. These things, my Lord, would put mee extreamly into passion, and I could never bee patient at such excesse of ungratefulnesse, if I did not remember, that there hath sometimes beene a spirit, so sullen, and so sawcie, that it dared to finde fault with the workes of God himselfe, and was not afrayd to say, that if hee had been of his counsell, as well in the creation as in the government of the world, hee would have given him better advice than hee tooke at first, or than hee now followes. After so immense a folly, you must not thinke it strange, if there be some Extravagants; and the vulgar at all times hath beene found but an unjust Iudge of vertue; and yet for all that, it hath never beene without admirers: and now, if those that have but little instinct, and can doe nothing but murmure, and doe not favour him, it is for us, my Lord, to testifie unto you, that reasonable men, and such as know how to speake, are of the better side.
                     
                        Your most humble and most obedient servant, Balzac.
                        
                           At Balzac, 4. Aug. 1630.
                        
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     Another to him. LETTER II.
                     MY Lord, hearing that Monsieur de—meanes to question mee about the Benefice you did mee the honour to give mee: and that by vertue of his dispensation, hee hath sent to take possession, I have conceived no better shelter, to avoyd this storme, than under the greatnesse of your Name; nor any safer defence against the forces of such an adversario, than the respect of such a Protector as you are. I require not in this any strayning of your Lordships power; I know you are sparing of it in your owne proper interests, and reserve it for occasions that are publicke and important: I onely require the continuance of your love, and that you would signifie to him that troubles mee, you would bee glad hee would let me bee at quiet. For besides that to stand in suit with a man of his robe, were as much as to fight with a Master of Fence, and to put ones whole right in hazard. It would trouble me, my Lord, though I were assured of successe, to thinke I should owe any part of it to any other besides your selfe, seeing I account

it more glorie to receive from you, than to wrest from another. Monsieur de—may doe well, to keepe his dispensation for a better market, and draw much more profit with a little patience. And indeed, I verily believe, hee lookes for nothing to make him surcease, but for some demonstration from you, of your desire: and that he rather hath an ambition to bee intreated by M. the Cardinall, than any designe to take your gift from mee. I humbly intreat your Lordship to give him contentment in this poynt, and not suffer me to fall, at this first step of my Fortune; and that I may not alwayes bee unfortunate, being as I am with all my soule,
                     
                        My Lord, 
                        Yours, &amp;c.
                        
                           At Balzac, 8. Novem. 1631.
                        
                     
                  
                  
                     Another to him. LETTER III.
                     MY Lord, I am infinitely bound unto you for the honour you have done me, to remember

me, and for the paines you have taken, to write in my behalfe to Monsieur de——It is true, your paynes hath not had so good successe, as I verily hoped it would: for though hee had given out, that for his satisfaction hee required no more but some small signe, that it was your desire: yet having received that signe, hee continues still in the same termes, and holds the same rigorous course he did. It makes mee thinke, my Lord, that hee knowes not of what worth your commendation is: certainly, if it had been imployed for any other but my selfe, it had found all the yeelding and respect it meriteth: but indeed, I cast unfortunatenesse upon all matters I deale in: my evill Fortune suffers mee not to make benefit of your love; you have no sooner a thought to doe me good, but presently a thousand impediments arise to hinder it. You give mee presents, and I doe not receive them: You command I should be payd my pension, and your command is not obeyed. Not yours, my Lord, of which one might say, Est fatum quodeunque voles. You have read my booke with pleasure, and spoken of it with commendation; and yet I suffer persecution for making it, as much as to say, for being a true Frenchman, and a lover of publick liberty. For as for the objections they make against mee, they certainly are but colours and pretences: If my words be not learned, or eloquent, they are yet found, and full

of truth. There is not one to bee found in all my worke, which a meane Advocate were not able to defend before the severest Tribunall in the world. The makers of libels, who condemne them, are the men of all other, that first corrupt them. I begin my Lord, to bee wearie of this long and obstinate injustice; my Philosophie beginnes to faile mee in this case: and I should bee cleane and altogether out of heart, if I had not your goodnesse to relye upon. For this, at this day, is the common refuge of all oppressed innocents, and no man invocates it in vaine. I therefore make my selfe believe, that it will at last send mee also some faire dayes, after so many stormes and tempests raysed against mee by mine enemies: and that after you have saved Nations, and set Princes in their Thrones, it will bee no hard matter to relieve a poore private man who adores you, and whom calumnie seekes to ruine. I know some my Lord, whom you have made happy, and yet scarce knew their names; when you did mee the honour to give mee your good word, and yet fare never the better for it. And some I have knowne advanced by you, that lay hidden in the throng, when your selfe drew mee out, and placed mee amongst the few, yet what get I by it? For in truth I could never make any use of this advantage, because indeed I could never serve you with

such care and subjection, as the forwardnesse of your favours obliged me to doe. My indisposition hath alwayes hindred my good designes; I have alwayes combated with weaknesse of body, and never durst venture to begin a life, which I was not assured I were able to hold out. This hath forced me, my Lord, to court you in a new fashion; and to seeke to doe you service by my absence and ease, and not trouble you with unseasonable officiousnesse, and with many low curtsies to no purpose. I am able to say, unworthy as I am, that I was the first man that preached the wonders of your life unto the people, exhorted all Frenchmen to doe their duties; have in mine owne person given good example in the Provinces, and have healed many spirits that were sicke, and ill perswaded of the present government. I am not so well knowne by my name, as by my forwardnesse in your service. And when the spitefull rumour ran abroad of late, many persons of qualitie can tell, how generally I tooke it: and how I resolved to follow you to the worlds end, if so bee the unfortunatenesse of France should remove you from the Court. Yet I am not troubled, that I make you not these proofes of my Fidelitie, though they would be lesse difficult to me, than to entertaine you, as now I doe, with my interests; which to say true, is a cruell torture I put my selfe to. It is not my desire, you should have misfortunes, to the end I might make use

of my consolations: nor is it my wish, there should be disorders in my countrey, and disgrace to my master, to the end I might the better shew my selse a good Frenchman, and a loyall servant. But yet my Lord, why may I not be of some use in a calme, and have a place as well in the joy, as in the sorrow? You alone are the authour of your victorie; but you alone cannot furnish your tryumph, but must have many Artificers to worke about it. I have materials enough to make many large Fabrickes; but to undertake the worke, I must entre at your Lordship I may have a little contentment, or at least, a little quiet. The splendor of your person is so great, that it sends forth beams of light to your remotest servants: and the power which heaven hath given you, is so redoubtable to all sorts of tyrants, that to give a period to my persecution, there needs no more, but that you give some signe you meane to protect me; which favour I perswade my selfe you will not deny me: for besides the common cause of being oppressed, you have knowne a long time, that I make a speciall profession to be

                     SIR, my curiofitie were undiscreet, if I should aske you newes of occurrents in the Armie; but you cannot take it ill, that I aske you newes of my Lord the Cardinals health. I learne the progresse of his glorious actions by the mouth of Fame: but I must learn from you how he fares in his continual agitation; and whether the temper of his bodie feele no alteration by the violent motions of his spirit. I conceive that God doubles his force when there is need; and that hee hath regard to the necessitie of so many people that cannot misse him: but I know also, that hee makes use of the second causes, and that your cares and industrie concurre with his providence. The services you doe to one particular man, are obligations to all the world. Never had any Science a more worthie or more profitable imployment than yours hath: And if the Romanes erected a statue to Antonius Musa, for healing of him who oppressed their libertie, why may not you justly expect a publicke

acknowledgement for preserving of him, who makes us all both free and happie? I send him the discourses which——I humbly entreat you to take care they may come to no other hands but his: and therefore that you will keep them in your custodie, that they may be safe untill I come my selfe to Paris. I expect this courtesie from that good will you have alwayes promised mee: and here I make you this solemne protestation, that you can never honour any man that is more passionately than I am
                     
                        Sir,  
                        Your, &amp;c.
                        
                           At Balzac, 5. Aug. 1630.
                        
                     
                  
                  
                     To Monsieur de Chastelet Counsellour of the King in his Counsell of State. LETTER V.
                     SIR, it is great worke of memorie to bee mindfull of mee at the Court: but it is an

effect of a divine goodnesse to make it raine dainties in the desart: Since Manna, there was never seene there, such a thing as you sent me; and if you were bound to furnish mee with such fare, fortie yeares of banishment at this diet, would be to me fortie yeares of felicitie. To speake in plaine tearmes, your present is unvaluable: and to helpe my selfe in speaking of it, I have beene forced to fetch comparisons from heaven, because inferiour things are never able to expresse it. You doe it wrong to give it the name of a Preface: but what may we expect from the worke it selfe, before which such a preface is set? If the outside be so rich, and there bee so great magnificence in the Gate-house, what will bee in the Galleries, and Cabinets? and what will the Palace be that is worthie of such an entrance? I see indeed that it is a mark of greatnesse, but I feare withall, that it is a want of proportion, and being not possible the rest should equall the the beginning, you will bee accused for disturbing the order of things, and for putting perfection out of its place, which should not come in but at the last. See here an accusation that is verie nice, and whereof it is a glorie to bee convinced. In this there is lesse account to be made of vertue than of vice; and the disorder which makes a magnificence, is more worth than the method which retaines a povertie: Blame not sir, the event of this dispute: Beautie begets the prize in all causes

where the eyes are judges: and they who blame you for adorning too much your refutation of the Bookes of Flanders, blame you for having your Armour too much guilded, and that in striking you dazle their eyes. It seemes they know not that the Lacedemonians never tricked up themselves, but when they went to fight; and that Caesar made his vaunt, hee wanne battailes with perfumed Souldiers. The pompe of your stile arrests not the sight without profit: It is pleasing to the Reader; but withall it is fatall to slander. In it there is to bee seene the luster and braverie of Tournaments; but withall, there is to bee seene in it the force and terriblenesse of warre. The onely pittie is, you had not a competent Enemie to fight withall, and that so much force and valour should bee spent upon a feeble furie, and which is now at the last drop of its poyson. The wretched man you pursue, and who dyes blaspheming; was not worthie of so noble a Resentment as yours, having nothing considerable in him, but that you vouchsafe to speake of him: you make him of some worth by alledging him so often. In undoing him, you make him famous, and his objections will one day not be found, but in your answeres. It is five and twentie yeares since hee was a fugitive from his order, and should have had his triall before the Generall of the Iesuites. And if these good Fathers did not deale too gently with delinquents, and

change imprisonment into banishment, hee had from that time beene suppressed, with all the filthy bookes hee hath made ever since. But it was necessarie, that (to crowne his inconstancie) after hee had abandoned above a dozen sides, hee should now for his last prize, become a parasite to the Spaniards, and a Secretarie to those bad French that are at their Court. Let it never trouble us Sir, that hee calles us Flatterers: Atheists call honest men superstitious. Catiline called them all slaves that would not be parracides; and it hath alwayes been impossible, to be vertuous with approbation of the wicked. They are delinquents themselves, that find fault with our innocency, &amp; they are idle fellows, who prostrate themselves every day before a Don Dego, or a Don Roderigo, and yet thinke much wee should doe any reverence to M. the Cardinall Richlieu. But it is fit they should be taught, that here is the true worship, at Bruxells but Idolatrie; and that to adore a forreigne Power, and such a one that doth mischiefe to the whole earth, is not, at least an action so truely French, as to revere a vertue, that is native of France, and that doth good to all the world. Seeing they abuse our tongue, in praysing their Tyrants, and justifying our Rebells; It cannot be denyed us, to bring it backe to its naturall and proper use, and in more honest subjects, to purifie and make cleane those words and phrases, which they have prostituted to the conceits of the Marquis

of Aytona, or made to serve the passion of Spaine. If tyrannie were more to be feared than it is, and that the unfortunatenesse of France should make it reach hither; yet it should never make mee to unsay the propositions I hold, and it shall be all my life a most pleasing object to mee, to see my selfe enrolled in the Catalogue of Authours, condemned by the enemies of my Countrey. I thinke, I may boldly say, I was one of the first mainteiners of the truth, and he perhaps that layd open the field, where so many Oratours and Poets finde themselves exercise: It is time now, that I leave it to younger men, and such as are more able than I am. Yet I intreat you to remember Sir, that I give place without running away; and that it is the coldnesse of my bloud, and the abatement of my strength, that forceth mee, 
                           〈◊〉
                         not any want of courage or change of will. Never thinke I will ever fayle in these: I alwayes preserve in my heart, the principles of good actions, I meane, good desires; and when I can no longer be a runner in the Race, yet I will be one of the most earnest Spectatours, and fight at Cuffes, when I can doe nothing else. In the meane time, to the end, that a good part of my ancient travaile may not be lost, and that I may not make that an unprofitable secret, betweene my Muses and mee, which may perhaps serve for some edification to the Publicke: I thinke fit, to make you account of certaine things I have

heretofore conceived; and to shew you, that in actions of my dutie, I oftentimes content my selfe with the testimony of my owne Conscience. These are Pieces that were wrought before the second voyage into Italie, and before the lamentable Divisions of the Royall Familie. In the puritic of publick joy, amidst the applauses of all the Kings subjects; and even of those who have since lost their loyaltie, and now lye rayling upon us at Bruxells. I send you some sheets, as I first light upon them, and I send them Sir, rather to doe you Homage by laying my Compositions at your feete, than to make a Challenge, as opposing them to yours, rather to acknowledge the superioritie of your Eloquence, and to goe in your Lyverie, than to make my selfe your Competitor, and seeke to brave you, with so rash a Comparison. If you finde any rellish in Discourses so farre short of the force and merit of yours; and if you thinke they may give my Masters of the Universitie, any the least contentment, I earnestly entreate you, to present them a Copie; and withall, my humble submission to their judgement. I know, this Societie is at this day the supreme Tribunall that Censures all workes of the Braine, and gives Rules to all other Tribunalls of France. I neither doubt of the susficiencie, nor suspect the integritie of the Judges that praeside there: Moreover, I confesse Sir, it could never have a more happie Conception, seeing your selfe was the first

that spake it, nor a more illustrious birth, seeing M. the Cardinall was a Patron to it; and therefore, borne in Purple, as were those Princes in Constantinople, whom I would call, Porphyrogenetes, if the Academie had Naturalised this Forreigne word. The honour it hath done me, to make me a member of their body, without binding me to part from hence, and the place it hath given mee, without taking away my libertie, are two singular favours I received from it, both at one time. And to say the truth, it is no small benefit to a man of the wildernesse, that turnes his face sometimes towards the world, and is not altogether devested of humane affections, that hee may injoy together, both the repose of solitude, and yet flatter his imagination with the glory of so pleasing a Societie. This I cannot doe without thanking you for so great a favour; and if they understand not of my Resentment by your mouth, they may have just cause to condemne me for one of little Gratefulnesse. Lend mee therefore, I beseech you Sir, some five or six words, I would aske you more, but I know they are of that worth, and so high in their account, that these few will be enow, not onely to satisfie for the complement I owe; but for the Oration also, it is expected I should make them. You will not, I hope, denie mee the testimonie of your love, and I require it of you by the memory of the other Obligations I owe

                        To Monsieur de Bois Robert. LETTER VI.
                     
                        SIR, I heare you have beene seene at Paris, from whence, I conclude, you are not at the warre in Flanders, but are content to goe and give it your malediction upon the Frontiers. If you would acquaint us with the passages of that Countrey, you should infinitely oblige your old friend, who feeds upon no other nourishment but Newes, and takes no Newes to heart, but those which concerne the King.

Hee is so carefull of the Reputation of his Armes, that he cannot abido his victory should be spoken of with doubtlng: To make him confesse, wee have lost one man, it is necessary there should be foure Regiments defeated; and when he is spoken to, of the Emperours ayde, that this is a Remedie to be lookt for, when the contrary part is dead. To make this man a Present, the Poet you wot of, made lately some Verses upon the estate of affayres in Lorrayne, and answers another Poet, who had written, that the King would never be able to hold it, and that the relliek of affection, which the Country beares to its ancient Duke, would never suffer any familiaritie or friendship to reflect upon us. The——that are the Latins of this Countrey, would make him beleeve, that he hath found a meane between the Character of Catulus, and that of Martiall, and that hee hath avoyded the drinesse and harshnesse of the former times, without engaging himselfe in the luxurie and intemperance of the latter times. With these new Verses, I send you the old Prose you desired, and which hath lyen so long asleepe in my Closet. Though they be writings of an old date, yet you know, they are alwayes in season; and seeing they entreate of the soveraigne ve
                              •…
                           tue, that is of M. the Cardinall, they entreate of a mattet that is immortall, and can never loose the grace of being new. Thermopylae and Platea, are to this day the common places of the

                           Graecians that are in the world; and our remotest posteritie, which shall more quickly enjoy the labours of this rare man, than wee doe; shall speake more often, and more honourably of them than wee doe. I beleeve, the Letter to Monsieur Chastelet, will not dislike you, and that you will find something in it worth your reading. I had word sent me from Paris, that his style was too much paynted, and too full of Figures for a military style; but you shall see, how in praysing him for the rest, I justifie him in this; and with what byace I defend the cause of worthy things. I entreate you to aske him for me, the last Libells of—: and to deliver them to—to bring them to me. You have heard by—the cause I have to complaine of Monsieur de—: Delayes in such cases are very dangerous, and if you have not already made an end of the matter, I feare mee, the Stocke that was appoynted for paying of me, will goe some other way. Doe herein what you shall thinke fittest, and I shall remaine

He hath, since that, shewed mee other Verses, which hee made for M. the Cardinall, and intreated mee, to shew you some of the places, which I thought the most accomplished, but upon this condition Sir, that at least for this once, you shall be a conscionable Judge, and shall tell us upon your Oath, whether you thinke this good, or that bad:

                     SIR, I am your vexation in ordinary, and because you have not rejected my first importunities, you have given me encouragement to continue them still. Hee that brings you this Letter, beleeves that my commendation would doe him no hurt with you; and I beleeve so too; and seeing his interests are very deare unto mee, I earnestly intreat you, to let him finde that our common beliefe is not ill grounded. The savours you doe mee, are so much the more pure, in that they looke for no requitall, and that you have no friends that have suits at Balzac. You therefore may worke, as your custome is, by the onely motions of your vertue; and as it is fit, you should be more ambitious than I, so you must be content, to leave me all the profit of our friendship, and keepe for your selfe all the glory. I expect an answer out of Holland, where, I doubt not, but your worke is in high esteeme, as well for the merit of the

matter, as for the excellencie of the forme: I meane, as well for that it is the Production of a great Poet, as for that it is the action of a good Citizen. As soone as I heare newes from thence, I will acquaint you with it; and intreat this favour from you, that you will beleeve I passionately am,
                     
                        Sir,  
                        Your, &amp;c.

                     To Monsieur Girard, Secretary to M. the Duke D'Espernon. LETTER IX.
                     SIR, your last Letters have exceedingly comforted mee, and you have such things for me, that they make me forgetfull of all my

miseries. With such a friendship, I can mocke at ill fortune, and it makes mee taste contentments, which good fortune knowes not of. It is true, that your absence is a perpetuall cooling Card to my joy; and possessing you but in spirit, it requires a very strong imagination, to desire nothing else. Shall wee never come to be Citizens of one Citie? Never to be Hermits in the same Desart? Shall my Counsayle be alwayes twenty myles from me? and must I be alwayes forced to passe two Seas to fetch it when I need it? I hope your justice will doe me reason, and that Heaven will at last heare the most ardent of all my prayers; but in the meane time, whilst I stay waiting for so perfect a contentment, I would be glad to have of it, now and then, some little taste: which, if it be not in your power to give mee; at least lend it mee for some few dayes, and come and sit as supreme President, over both my French, and Latin. I promise you, I will never appeale from you to any other; onely for this once, give mee leave to tell you, that the word Ludovix, which you blame as too new, seemes to me a more Poeticall and pleasing word, than either the Aloysius of the Italians, or our Ludovicus; and besides, It savours of the Antiquitie of our Nation; and of the first language of the Gaules; witnesse these words, Ambiorix, Eporedorix, Orgetorix, Vercingetorix, &amp;c. In which you see the Analogie to be plaine; yet more than this, I have an Authoritie, which

I am sure, you will make difficultie to allow: you know Monsieur Guyet, is a great Master in this Art; but perhaps you know not that hee hath used this very word Ludovix, before I used it; for I tooke it from excellent Verses of his:
                     
                        Non tulit hoc Ludovix, justa puer acer ab ira,
                        Etpatriae casum sic videamus, ait.
                     
                     For other matters Sir, you may adde to that which was last alledged in the cause of Madam Gourney, this passage out of the divine Jerusalem, where Aladin calles Clorinda the Intercessour of Sophronia, and of her lover,

                     To my Lord the Earle of Port. LETTER X.
                     SIR, I have received a letter from you since your being in England, but not being able to read the Gentlemans hand that writ it to me, for want of a decipherer, I have been forced to bee uncivill till now, and have therefore not answered you; because indeed I know not whom to answer: but now, that this Gentleman (whose name is a mysterie in his letters) is by good fortune, come againe into this countrey, I can by no meanes suffer him to part without some testimonie of the account I make of your favour, and the desire I have to preserve it, by all the possible meanes I can. I will make you Sir, no studied Protestations, nor send complements to a man that is borne in the Countrey of good words, I will onely say, there are many respects that make your person dea
                           •…
                         unto mee: and that besides the consideration of your vertue, which gives mee just cause to honour you, that also of the name you beare, and of the ranke you hold, are things that exceed the value of indifferencie.

I love all them that love France, and wish well to our great Prince, of whom in truth I have heard you speake so worthily, that as often as I remember it, it stirres mee up to doing my dutie, and to profit by so good an example. If hee had been seconded in Italy, wee should have seene all we could have hoped. But God himselfe saves none but such as contribute themselves to their salvation. Saguntum was taken while the Senatours were deliberating: and a wisedome that is too scrupulous, commonly doth nothing for feare of doing ill. The most part of Italians are themselves the workmen, to make their owne fetters: they lend the Spaniard their blood, and their heares, to make a slave of their countrey, and are the particides of their mother, of whom they might have been the redeemers. But of all this, wee shall talke more at Paris, if you come thither this Winter, as I am put in hope you will. In the means time doe mee the honor to let me have your love, and to believe mee, there is none in the world more truely than I,
                     
                        Sir,  
                        Yours, &amp;c.

                     To my Lord the Bishop of Nantes. LETTER XI.
                     MY Lord, the joy I take in the recoverie of your health, is not yet so pure, but that it alwayes represents unto me a terrible Image of your last sicknesse. The imagination of a danger, thogh past &amp; gone, yet makes my momorie afraid, I looke upon it rather in safetie, than with assurance. We missed the loosing you but very narrowly: and you were upon the poynt to leave us Orphans. I speake it seriously, and without any flattery at all, all the victories we have gotten, or shall get, would never be able to make us amends for such a losse: you would have made our conquest turne to mourning: M. the Cardinall would have found something to complaine of in his great felicitie, and would have watred his triumph with his teares. Let it not be Gods will to lay this crosse upon our time: and if it be a crosse inevitable, yet let it be deferred to our posteritie. It is necessarie the Pho

age, and that the world should be allowed time for enjoying the possession, and so profitable and sweet a life as yours. It is true, the world is not worthy of you; but, my Lord, the world hath need of you: your vertue indeed should long since have beene crowned, but that your example is still necessarie: and the more happie ones there be in heaven, the fewer honest ones will be left upon earth. Love therefore your selfe a little for our sakes; begin now at last to studie your health, which hitherto you have neglected, and make a difference hereafter between cold and heate, betweene good and bad aire; between meates that are sweet, and those that are bitter. Though you take no care of your health for your owne sake, yet you must take care of it for the common good: For, I beseech you my Lord, tell me, what should become of the cause of the poore? what of the desolation of widowes? what of the innocencie of men oppressed? I speak not of the hope of such as hope for preferment by you: for though I write to you my Father, and call you Monsieur,——yet I am none of that number. I desire nothing from you at this time, but that which you may give me without asking it of another; your love and good will is the onely object of my present passion. I renounce with all my heart, all other things in the world, so I may keepe but this, and shall never complaine of my shipwracke, if it leave me so solid a planke as this to rest upon. Be

                     To Monsieur Senne, Theologall of the Church of Saints LETTER XII.
                     SIR, I have been in extasie to heare of your health, and that you keepe your bodie in that reasonable fulnesse of flesh, which contributes something to your gravitie, and addes nothing to your weight. I would not wish you to seeke to abate it, nor long to be like the city and tawnie skinnes of the first Christians. For all Tertullians saying, all Saints have not been leane and melancholick.

Monsieur de—made me so rich a description of your health, that I could not choose but begin my letter with this complement. I have seene since Monsieur de—who delivered me one from you, and with-it, our friends booke, for which I thanke you with all my heart, I have yet perused onely some Tracts, which in truth seeme verie learned, and are as intelligible as the obscuritie of the matter would well beare. It is true, the Title deceived me; and seeing you will have me speake freely what I thinke, I must tell you, I thinke they are nothing lesse than Orations, and that they are

I had thought to have found in them the perswasive motives of Oratours, in the highest straine of their stile, and I finde nothing but the dry doctrine of Philosophers, and of them neither, nothing but the ordinarie language of their precepts: that it makes me think of these new Companies of souldiers which are levied under the name of Horse, but are put to serve on foote, when they come to the Armie.

                     SIR, my persecution should be sweete unto me, if in suffering it, I might have the happinesse to see you; but your absence makes it insupportable: and it were as good for mee to

goe and be killed in the place where you are, as to come hither and die with languishing Being here against my minde, I finde nothing that pleaseth me: and the objects which I beheld before, as the riches of Nature, I cannot now looke upon but with horrour, and count them but as the moveables of a Prison. I sigh continually after your Cabinet, which hath so often served for a haven to my tossed spirit: and from whence I have so often fetcht Armes and courage to defend me against Fortune. I am not out of hope to see it once againe, and to sit mee downe in that greene chaire, where you know I have used to be inspired, and foretell things to come, as Sibil did from her Tryvet.

These are persons that without wearing purple, or bearing office, are yet illustrious and in Authoritie, at least in the reasonable world, and amongst men, that can rightly judge of things.

I here oftentimes told you, that you are naturally eloquent; but yet I must confesse you have gotten new graces, by being in Ciceroes country, and the Aire of Rome seemes to have purged your spirit, of all vulgar conceits. Monsieur de—is in this of my opinion: and you have written to us such excellent things, that they were able to comfort us for your absence, if we loved you but a little; but in truth, no Copie can be so good, as the Originall; and if you come not backe very shortly, I could finde in

my old loves, and makes me with so much pleasure, remember the sweetest part of the earth, that I even die with longing, till I see it againe. It is a long time that Italy hath had my heart, and that I sigh after that happy cowardice, with which the valiant reproach the wise. If I could have lived, as I would my selfe, I had beene a citizen of Rome ever since the yeare 1620. and should now injoy that happinesse in possession, which you but onely make mee see in Picture, but my ill fortune would not suffer me: shee keepes mee in France, to be a continuall object of persecution: and though it be now foure yeares since I left the world, and lost the use of my tongue; yet hatred and envie follow me in to the woods to trouble my silence; and pursue mee even in Dennes and Caves.

                     SIR, I have word sent mee from Paris, that you make complaints against me: but being well assured, you have no just cause, I imagine, it is not done in earnest, but that you take pleasure to give mee a false Alarum. Yet I must confesse, this cooling word, I heare spoken, puts me to no little paine: for though it make me not doubt of the firmenesse of your affection, yet it makes me challenge the malice of my Fortune. I have beeue for some time so unfortunate in friendshippe; that it seemes there needes nothing but pretences to ridde me of them; the sweetest natures grow soure and bitter against mee; and if this sit hold, I shall have much adoe to keepe my owne brother of my side. I would like as well, to be a keeper of the Lyons, as of such harsh friends; for though I were more faithfull than Pylades and Acates put together; yet they would finde matter of discontentment; and my fidelitie should be called dissimulation. I cannot beleeve that you are of this number; but if you be, it is time for me to go hide my self in the desarts of Thebai

is done me: and if you should deale as hardly with me as others have done: It were fit, I should resolve to live no longer in a world, where goodnesse and innocencie are so cruelly persecuted. These sixe moneths, I have received from you, but onely one Letter; to which, I made no answer, because it was delivered me, but in Aprill: at which time, you sent me word you should be in France.

I know not from whence should come this coldnesse in you; seeing for my selfe, I am all on fire: nor how, you, with your great wisedome should be altered and growne another than, seeing I continue still the same, with nothing but my common sence. Great spirits are above these petty suspitions which move the vulgar: and I wonder you could conceive ill of my affection, knowing how well you had preserved your owne. If it be the jealousse of eloquence that provokes you; I am willing with all my heart, to leave you all the pretensions I can have to it; and if you please, I will make you a Surrender before witnesse.

                        ence. Give mee leave to live: a man that cannot be lost, what

neligence be used in keeping me; and remember that the least respected of all my friends is much dearer to me, than all Sciences or all Bookes. Yet such is my unhappinesse, that few of them returne me the like, but seeme rather they would make a benefit, of my paines and sorrowes. Because they see I am persecuted, they will make every the least courtesie they doe me to be of great value, and set an excessive price upon their friendshippe, because they know I stand in neede of it. But I desire them, and you also to take notice, that my friendship was never grounded upon any interest; but my love is ever without any mercenary designe, or hope of benefit. If they be not willing to embroile themselves in my affaires, I would have them know, I am as unwilling as they, they should: and if they be not strong enough, to defend the truth in publike; and when it is opposed; at least let them not disavow it, when they are in place of safety; let them not deny their friend when the storme is over, and that there is no longer any danger in confessing him. You saw my heart, the first time you saw my face; you were at that time my Confessour; and I have not a sinne that is hidden from you. I conceive you are too generous to make advantage of this excesse of freenesse you finde in me; and I doe not thinke you so subtle, that you would make a shew of discontent, for feare least I should beginne first. These are subtilties indeede of the country from whence you come: but in my opinion very remote from your naturall

disposition: and you neede not make complaints of me, to prevent the complaints I might else make of you. It is certaine, that if I had not equitie enough to excuse my friends for things they were not able to performe; I might then perhappes have colour to complaine they performed not their promise: but I am one, that know there happen a thousand impediments which hinder a man from keeping his word, and that every thing that is promised and not done, is not presently a violating of fa
                           •…
                        th, or a breaking of promise. Some have laboured to perswade me, that—: but I never beleeved any such thing, and I could never imagine that you would goe about to build your reputation upon the ruines of the reputation of your friend. If any shall make use of such like artifices, to doe ill offices betweene you and me: I earnestly intreate you to make use of the like remedies, to preserve your opinions sound, and not to suffer your judgement to be corrupted. I take God to witnesse, there is nothing in the world more deare unto mee then your friendship; I make publike and open profession of honouring you: I highly esteeme a number of eminent qualities in you, both Morall and Intellectuall; I have oftentimes shedde teares, when I read in your Letters of your griefes; all this, me thinkes should deserve a little affection, and make the Fathers themselves that are my adversaries, not take it ill that you should love me; especially when they shall know, that I passionately am,
                     
                        Sir,  
                        Your, &amp;c.
                        
                           At Paris 8. Feb. 1631.
                        
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     To Mounsieur de Sainte Marte. LETTER XVII.
                     SIR, I am paid for my paines before hand, and looke for no greater recompence than you have already made mee. My ambition should be very excessive, if it were not fully satisfied with your excellent Verses: and if I did not thinke my selfe happie to be honoured by a hand, which crownes none but Soveraigne heads, and travells not, but about triumphall Arcks, and publicke Monuments. I have long since knowne, that all excellent things grow in your Garden; and that the Latine eloquence, which is but borrowed by others; and a stranger every where else; ought with you to be accounted as your patrimony: but I knew not till now, that this rare quality, is accompanied with so perfit a courtesie; and that a man so worthy of his name, and that addes new glory to that of the great Scavola, could admire any other mens wonders, besides his owne. I will doe all that possibly I can, to deserve this your favourable judgement, and not to make you sorry for being deceived to my advantage: but howsoever, if I be not able to preserve your good opinion by my merit; I hope at least to merit your favour by my affection, and to make you see that I truely am,
                     
                        Your, &amp;c.
                        
                           At Balzac. 2. Sept. 1630.
                        
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     To Mounsieur D'Argenton Counsellor of the King, and Master of Requests in Ordinary. LETTER XVIII.
                     SIR, having taken the paines that I have done, I cannot altogether disvalue my worke; yet I am not a little glad to be confirmed in my opinion by a man of your worth: and that my labour is not unpleasing to the soundest judgements. The second censure you make of it, assures me of the integritie of the first; seeing I should be too presumptuous to beleeve, you could be deceived twice together. But let us stay there, I beseech you; and thinke not, I will ever entertaine the vanitie you put upon me. I neither pretend to instruct the world, nor take upon me to teach you, in any thing: it is enough for me, that I can finde wisemen some recreation; &amp; can lay things beforeyour eyes, which you know already better than my selfe. I may perhaps be some helpe to your memorie, and refresh your old Ideas; but to adde any thing to your knowledge, and impart to you any new Doctrine, this requires qualities that are not to be found in me. I rather hope to be much bettered in knowledge by you; and make account, to account you hereafter, for one of my Oracles. Prepare your

selfe therefore to be persecuted with Questions, and looke to receive importunities from me in ordinary. Thus I use my friends when they are abler men than my selfe; and this advantage which is not great, is accompanied with this inconvenience, which is not small. You shall beginne to finde it, at our next meeting: but in the meane time, I intreate you to beleeve, that what badde designe soever I have against you, yet I remaine perfectly to be,
                     
                        Sir,  
                        Your, &amp;c.
                        
                           At Balzac, 17. Sept. 1631.
                        
                     
                  
                  
                     To the most Reverend Father, Leon, Preacher of the Carmelites. LETTER XIX.
                     SIR, you do me too much good at once: your friendship is of great worth being alone; and you send it to me accompanied. It brings with it an infinite number of excellent things, and resembles that happy River which leaves plenty in all places where it passeth. The Present I have received, comes from such a fruitefull Vine: it is not a vaine shew of magnificence,

which gives onely a light satisfaction to the eyes; but I finde it essentiall and solid; and any spirit that is capable of speculation, may well finde nourishment enough in the juyce onely of your Preface. I will not take upon me any more, though you sollicite mee to doe it; and instead of giving my advice, would have me, I should pronounce a Decree. Take heede my good Father, what you say; and consider what a goodly thing it would be to raise my Village into a Parliament, and make appeales, from Paris to Balzac. Though you had humilitie enough to submit to an unlawfull Magistrate: yet I have not presumption enough to intrude upon an unlawfull charge: Remember your selfe besides, that your Booke is dated from Mount Carmell, which is to say, out of our jurisdiction, and that Decrees are of no force, where time out of minde, there have beene Oracles. You know what Suetonius saith of it, in the life of Uespatian, he makes no bones to make a God of a Mountaine. I like not the boldnesse of such Metamorphoses: yet I am not ignorant, how farre the force of pletie may reach; and knowing it hath right to remove Mountaines, I doubt not but Carmell at this day may be in France; and that upon a place so holy and so high, there may descend more grace and light from heaven, than there ascends ignorance and vapours from the earth. Accept from me this true confession I make unto you, and dispence with mee for that soveraigne judgement you require of me: Though

I am not willing to be your President, yet I am not the lesse,
                     
                        My most Reverend Father;
                        Your, &amp;c.
                        
                           At Balzac 25. Aprill 1635.
                        
                     
                  
                  
                     To Mounsieur Chaplain. LETTER XX.
                     SIR, I have now these three weekēs taken mine ease, in spight of my selfe; and one of my feete, which I have not very free, keepes me in my bed, with more inconvenience than paine. Heretofore it hath put mee to torture; and therefore I count it now a favour, that it onely keepes me in prison, which I sweeten as well as I can, with my. Bookes and my friends. You thinke you contribute nothing to the comfort I receive; but I assure you, the best part of it comes from you: and nothing comforts me so much for the faire dayes I lose, as that excellent Ode you sent me: I am even ravished with every part of it; the choice and marshalling of the words; the structure and harmony of the composition; the modest greatnesse of the conceits; the force which savoursnot of any violence; all these are worthy to be ranked with the best Antiquitie. In some

places you doe not onely touch me, but touch me to the quicke: the agitation of the Poet, is transferred upon the reader; and no Trumpe

I know for my selfe, I shall never stay till your death, for putting you in the number of my Authours: and as often as in my presence, there shall be speaking of the siege of Rochell; of the forcing of Suza; of the taking and keeping of Pigneroll; so often shall I alleadge the divine Verses you have written of them: and these also, which I lay not lesse carefully up in my memorie,

                        Et sans que sa vigueur soit jamais affoiblie,
                        Qu'ou cede ou qu'ou resiste, il va d'un mesme cours.
                     
                     And these other that are so sage and morall.
                     
                        L'or pour luy cesse d'estre un metal pretieux,
                        La beauté perissable est un bien qu'il mospuso:
                        Pour l'un il est sans mains, &amp; pour l autre sans yeux.
                     
                     And these other that are so noble and so Poeticall;
                     
                        Cepandant que la Lune accomptissant son cours
                        Dessus un char d'argent enuironné d'estoiles
                        Dans le sombre univers represente le cours.
                     
                     And now after all this; tell me, if I have not profited by my reading, &amp; have not made good use of your presents. I should quickly grow rich, if you would send me such presents often; but this is too inordinate a desire, I must be content with one croppe in a yeare; and I may very well entertaine my selfe a long time, with that you have already sent mee, for which I thanke you with all my heart, and am,

                     To Mounsieur Bonnaud, Counsellor in Ordinary to my Lord the Prince. LETTER XXI.
                     SIR, I acknowledge nothing in your Verses due to me but only my name, all the rest belongs to some body else; and is unfitter for me, than a Crowne for a private man. I cannot therefore value my selfe the more, for having a thing I cannot use; nor is it fit I should put on Ornaments, which being as unfit for me, as in themselves they are rich, would disguise me rather, than adorne me. A courtier would complaine that you mocke him; Et que vous en faites une piece, A Doctour would say, you undertake a Paradox, and trie the strength of your wit, upon the noveltie of an irregular subject. I thinke, I must my selfe be of this opinion; and charge you Sir, with abusing Poetry; and for chusing an incredible thing to make it beleeved. Neverthelesse, seeing the Philosopher Favorinus tooke upon him to praise a feavour: and the Romanes adored it: I wonder not at your designe; for I perceive, there is nothing so bad of which may not be spoken some good; and whereof, Quelques vus n'ayent Chaumé le feste. After this extravagant Encomium, and this ridiculous Temple; you might

doe well to take my miseries too, and consecrate them in your stances, and take me too, and make me a thing adoreable and divine: for they are but the sports of your wit; which delight, though they doe not perswade and amuse with pleasure, because they are witty; but doe not deceive me because I know their craft. For the assurance you give me by your Letter of your friendship: I am infinitely beholding to you, and make account to reape no small benefit by it, for having a soule as you have, full of vertue, you make me a Present that is invaluable, to bring mee in to so worthy a possession: and whilest you offer me 
                           •…
                        eenesse and fi
                           •…
                        elity, you offer me the two greatest rarities this age affords. I beleeve you speake more seriously in Prose than you doe in Verse; and that you are content to be a Poet, but have no meaning to be a Sophister. I likewise entreare you to beleeve, that the least word I speake, is accompanied with a Religion, which I never violate; and that there is nothing more true, than the promise I here seale you, most perfectly to be,
                     
                        Sir,  
                        Your, &amp;c.
                        
                           At Balzac 6. Octob. 1635.
                        
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     To Mounsieur Souchote. LETTER XXII.
                     SIR, by your reckoning you have written to me thrice for nothing, when indeede I knew not of your first Letters, but by your last: if I had received them, you may be sure I should have answered them; for though I be not very regular in observing compliments, yet I am not so negligent of necessary duties, that I should commit so many faults together. How profound soever my slumber be; yet I awake presently, assoone as I am once stirred; and specially when it is by so deare a name, and by so pleasing a voyce as yours is. Never therefore require me to give it in charge to some other, to let you heare from me; such a request would be an offence to our friendshippe, an action fitter for a Tyrant than a Citizen: it were to take me for the great Mogull, who speakes to none but by an Interpreter. I like not this savage statelinesse; it is farre from me to use so little civilitie towards men of your worth: when it is I, that am beholding to you; I pray let it not be my groome that shall thanke you for it. I will take the paines my selfe to assure you I am wholly yours; and whereas, I did not bid you farewell at my going from Pari
                              •…
                           ; you must not take it for an argument of slighting your person; but for an effect of the libertie I

presume of, and of the renouncing I have vowed to all vaine ceremonies. They that are my friends give me this leave; and you are too well acquainted with the soliditie of things, to ground your judgement upon apparances; neither doe I thinke you will require them of me, who am as bad a courtier, as I truely am,
                     
                        Sir,  
                        Your, &amp;c.
                        
                           At Balzac 20. Iuly 1630.
                        
                     
                  
                  
                     To Mounsieur Tissandier. LETTER XXIII.
                     SIR, you shall receive by this bearer the rest of the workes of—: or to speake more properly, the continuation of his Follies. They are now as publike; as those Du grand preuost diuin, que vous auez visite autres fois dans les fame uses petites maisons. Hee useth me still with the same pride and insolencie he was wont: and you would thinke that hee were at the toppe of the Empyriall heaven, and I at the bottome of hell; so farre he takes himselfe to be above mee: but I doubt not, ere long, his pride shall be abated, and his insolencie mortified. He shall shortly be made to see, that he is not so great a man as he thinkes himselfe; and

if hee have in him but one sparke of naturall justice; hee shall confesse he hath triumphed without cause, and must be faine to give up all the glory he hath gotten unlawfully:
                     
                        Turno tempus erit magno cum optaverit 
                              〈◊〉
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        Intactum Pallanta:
                     
                     Mounsieur de—, is still your perfect friend, and he never writes to me, but hee speakes of you. He is at this present at Venice, where he meditates quietly the agitation of all the world besides; and where he enjoyes the honest pleasures which Italy affoords to speculative Philosophers. But Sir, what meane you by speaking of your teares; and of the request you make unto me? Doe you not mocke mee, when you pray me to comfort you for the death of your Grandfather; who had lived to see so many Families, so many Sects, so many Nations, both to be borne and die: a man as old as Here
                        
                           •…
                         it selfe: the League was younger than hee; which when the Cardinall of Lorraine first conceived; hee caused a Booke to be printed, wherein hee advertized France of the conception of this Monster. You weepe therefore for the losses of another age; it is Anchyses or Laertes you weepe for; at least it is for a man who did but suffer life, and was in a continuall combate with death. He should long agoe have bin one of the Church Triumphant, and therefore you ought to have beene prepared for either the losse, or the gaine that you have made?

Mounsieur 
                           
                              〈◊〉
                           
                         was not of your humour; I send you one of his Letters, where you shall see, hee was as much troubled to comfort himselfe for the life of two Grandmothers that would not die, as hee was for the death of a brother that died too soone. I commend your good nature; but I like not your Lamentations; which should indeede, do him you sorrow for, great wrong, if they should raise him againe to be in the state in which you lost him. It may suffice to tell you, that he is much happier than I; for he sleepes, and I wake; and he hath no more commerce with men unreasonable and inhumane, and that are but Wolfes to one another. You know I have cause enough to speake thus; but out of this number, I except certaine choise persons; and particularly your selfe, whom I know to be vertuous; and whose I am,
                     
                        Sir,
                        Most humble, &amp;c.
                        At Paris,

                     Another to him. LETTER XXIV.
                     SIR, if it had not beene for the indisposition of my body; I had not stayed so many dayes from thanking you for your many courtesies; but for these two moneths I have not stirred from my bed; so cruelly handled with the Sciatica, that it hath taken from me all the functions of my spirit, and made mee utterly uncapeable of any cenversation: otherwise you may be sure I should not voluntarily have deprived my selfe of the greatest contentment I can have, when I have not your companie: and that I should not have received three Letters from you, without making you three Answers. Now that I have gotten some quiet moments from the violence of my torture; and that my paine is turned into lamenesse: I cannot chuse but take you in hand, and tell you, in the first place, that you are an ungratefull man, to leave our Muses, and follow some of their sisters, that are neither so faire, nor so worthy of your affection. I intreate you to beleeve, it

is a temptation your evil Angell hath cast upon you; and that you ought to reject it, as the counsell of an enemie. Things are not now to beginne; it is no time now to deliberate; you are gone too farre in the good way to looke backe, and to be unwilling to finish that little which remaines. To leave eloquence for the Mathematickes; is to refuse a Mistris of eighteene yeare old, and to fall in love with an old woman. God keepe you from this unhappinesse, and inspire you with better thoughts, than those that have carried you to this desire of change. It would be a disloyaltie, I should never pardon you; but should blame you for it as long as I live. For making that reckoning of you as I doe; and expecting great matters from you: it were an infinite wrong you should doe, to make me lose the most pleasing of all my hopes. I therefore by all meanes intreate you to persevere in your first designe, and to resolve upon a voyage of 3. months, to come and be reconciled to her whom you have offended, and to make her a publike satisfaction by the edition of your writings, by which it will plainely enough be seene, the great favours she hath done you. And for my part, I promise you a chamber, where you shall have the prospect of a garden twelve miles long; and so you shall be at once, both in the citie, and in the country. Besides, I binde my selfe to set before your Booke an Advertisement to the Reader, to the end that no man may be ignorant of the part I beare, in that which concernes you.

Consider whether you like of these conditions, and whether you have courage enough to come and lodge Au Pre aux Clerks: where I will waite for you, without any designe of knowing, either what you meane, or what you meane to doe. You shall be sure Sir, to have there admirable visions, and shall meditate nothing but with successe. And in truth, seeing the least motion of your spirit, puts mee into extasie; what will it be, when you shall employ your whole forces? And if your conceits be so just, and so well governed, in the midst of confusion, and unseasonable disturbances: what a man will you be, when you shall be at leasure, and have the libertie which now you want? Take my word for it, you neede not feare the censure of the world; Ile undertake, you shall have the approbation of all honest peoples provided, that you make a truce with your Mathematicks, and never intricate your braines with that melancholicke and doting Science, which cost Archimedes his life; at least, before you cast your selfe upon such high and sublime speculations, it is fit you should get you credit by exercises that are more sweete and popular. And now Sir, this is all you are like to have at this time, from my Sciatica, that I am,
                     
                        Sir,  
                        Your, &amp;c.
                        At Balzac 23. March 1628.
                        
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     Another to him. LETTER XXV.
                     SIR, I doe but now receive your Letter of the twelfth of this Moneth, which confirmes mee in the opinion I have alwayes had; that my interests are as deare unto you as your owne. To compliment with you for this, would be to thanke you for being good, as much as to say for being your selfe; It is much better to returne you friendship for friendship, then to pay you with unprofitable words. In a word Sir, I make profession to bee an honest man, and therefore all the thankefulnesse that can be desired from a person obliged you may expect from me. As concerning——I assure you I wish him no ill, because I conceive he hath done me none; it is sufficient for mee that my friends have no good opinion of his opinions; and that his owne friends beginne to take notice of his false dealing. In all this there is nothing eyther new or strange; I am not the first innocent that have beene persecuted in the world, and if I could not beare detraction and slander, I should be more dainty then Princes, and their principall officers are, who forbeare not to doe well, though for their well doing they be evill spoken of; the best and soundest part is of my side, I want no protector eyther Males or Females, and if I would make use of

all my advantages, I could oppose Doctour to Doctour, and Gowne to Gowne;
                     
                        Fratribus &amp; fratres, &amp; claustra minantia Claustris.
                     
                     But it is fit sometimes to make spare of ones forces, and to restraine resentment within lesse bounds then justice allowes. The Prince you desire to heare of, is yet in the Idea of the king his father, farre from comming as yet to Paris or Thoulouze; for my selfe I am alwayes blocked up by my 'Sciatica, and I thinke all the stormes of the middle region of the ayre fall downe upon my unhappy legges; but it is you that will bring mee health and faire weather, and your presence will worke that miracle which I expect from Mounsieur de L'orme; come therefore I intreat you speedily, and suffer not a man to die for want of succour, who passionately is,
                     
                        Sir  
                        Your, &amp;c.
                        At Paris 
                           30. March, 1628.
                        
                     
                  
                  
                     To my Lord, the Duke of Valette. LETTER XXVI.
                     SIR, it greeves me much that the first Letter you see of mine, should not be pure and free

from all my interests, &amp; that in stead of intertaining you with matters of weight &amp; proportionable to your spirit, I should bring it downe to the petty affaires of a private man; yet I cannot beleeve that you being all gracious and all generous as you are, will thinke any occasion of doing good unworthy of you, but that your vertue in this doth imitate the supreme, which is never so busie in governing of heaven &amp; the other nobler parts of the world, but that he takes care as wel for governing the meanest of all his creatures. I humbly beseech your Lordship to consider me in this last qualitie; and if it bee no incivilitie to make such a request, that you will undertake the businesse I present unto you, but as a disburthening you of some more weighty; if it be not that my unfortunatenesse makes the easiest that are become unpossible, I see no reason you neede to imploy your whole forces about this matter; there needs no more but onely the motion of your will, and a light impression of your credit, with——to give it all the soliditie and lustre I desire. I should not seeme to understand the tearmes of the last Letter he did mee the honour to write unto mee; if I had not yet some little hope left, and a kinde of satisfaction in my owne conscience. Yet I alledge to him no merit of my part, but much generousnesse of his, nor speake of any services of mine to recompense him, but of his goodnesse that prevents them, and subjects not it selfe to the rigours of ordinary justice; This my Lord is all the right I

alledge for my selfe, and all the title upon which I ground my pretensions; but now I leave following it my selfe, and put it wholly into your hands; a place perhaps to which my ill fortune her selfe will beare a respect; but if shee shall be opposite to your desire, and prevaile above your favour, yet at least I shal thereby know the force of destinie to which all other forces give place, and which cannot be mastered by any force, nor corrected by any industrie; but yet it shall not hinder me from resting well satisfied, seeing I shall in this receive much more from you then I am denied by him, if I hold any part in your grace and favour, which is already my comfort against whatsoever ill successe can happen. It sufficeth me to bee happy with this kind of happinesse, which is more deare to mee than all the happinesse the Court can give me, being a man no more ambitious then I am,
                     
                        My Lord, 
                        Your, &amp;c.
                        
                           At Balzac 25. Decemb. 1634.
                        
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     To my Lord, the Bishop of Poitiers. LETTER XXVII.
                     MY Lord, although Mounsieur de—hath promised me to give you assurance of the continuation of my service, yet I cannot forbeare to adde these few lines to his testimony, and to tell you that which I tell to all the world that your vertue is a transcendent farre above the abilities and cariage of our age. It is a match for antiquitie in its greatest purenesse and severitie. When the Camilli and the Scipioes were not in imployment, they reposed themselves and tooke their ease as you doe; and when I consider sometimes the sweetē life you leade at Dissay, I conclude that all the imployments of the Pallace, and all the intricacies of the Court are not worth one moment of a wise mans idlenesse. It is well knowne that from your childhood you have despised vanitie even in her kingdome, and that in an ayre where shee had attractives able to draw the oldest and most reluctant spirits. All the pompe of Rome hath not so much as given you one temptation; and you are so confirmed in a generous contempt, that if good Fortune her selfe should come to looke you out, you would scarce goe out of your Closet to meete her in your Chamber. This is that I make such reckoning

of in your Lordship, and which I prefer before all your other qualities; for those how great soever they be, are yet but such as are common with many base and mercenarie Doctors, where as this force and courage are things that cannot bee acquired in the noyse and dust of Schooles. You found not these excellent qualities in the Vatican Library, nor yet got them by reading of old Manuscripts; you owe them indeede to Mounsieur your deceased father, that true Knight without spot or wrinckle; equally skilfull in the art of warre, and in affaires of peace, and that was the Heros of Muret, of Scaliger, and of Saint Mart. I propose not a lesse object for my worship then they did, neither indeede is it lesse, or lesse religious then theirs was; and though you did not love mee as you doe, and though you should denounce warre against me, and become head of a faction to seeke my ruine, yet I should not for all that forbeare to revere so rare a vertue as yours is, but should stil remaine,

                     To Mounsieur Guyet. LETTER XXVIII.
                     SIR, I feare not much to lose a thing I esteem but little, but holding your friendship in that account I doe, if I should not have it, I should never see day of comfort more; you must not therefore thinke it strange that I was mooved with the Alarum that was given mee, for though I know my selfe to be innocent, yet my unfortunatenesse is such that I conceive any bad newes to bee no more then my due. Now that Mounsieur de——hath quieted the agitation of my minde, and hath assured me of your love, I cannot forbeare to signifie unto you the joy I take, telling you wit tall that so I may preserve a friend of your merit and worth, I doe not greatly care for losing him that will leave me. There is litle to be seene amongst men but malice &amp; weaknesse, and even of good men the greatest part is scarce sound; there is a cause why a firme and constant spirit as yours is, is of wonderfull use in societie, 'and it is no small benefit to them that are wearied &amp; overtoyled as I am, to have a person to rest upon, that cannot fall. There is neede of courage to maintaine a friendship, and indeede of prudence to performe the meanest duty of life; tis nothing worth to have a sound will, if the understanding bee

defective, our—does a great matter, to make vowes and sacrifices: Nil veta furentem, Nil delubrajuvant, hee complaines without cause upon his tax and other inferiour matters, this is to accuse innocents: the evill no doubt comes from a higher place, and it is the braine that is cause of all the disorder. The knowledge I have hereof makes mee have compassion of him, and excuse in a Doctor of three score yeares old, those base shifting tricks that are not pardonable in a Schollar of eighteene. Any man but my selfe would call his action a cowardice and a treason; but I love to sweeten my griefe as much as I can. I cannot become an enemy at an instant, and passe from one extremity to another, without making a little stay by the way. I honour still the memory of our former friendship, &amp; cannot wish ill to a man to whom I have once wisht well; but this is too much, I to complaine and you to quarrell; doe me this favour I bese

very bottome of my heart, will, I doubt not most willingly adde his testimony to my protestations, that I truly am,
                     
                        Sir,  
                        Your, &amp;c.
                        
                           At Balzac 25. Septem. 1630.
                        
                     
                  
                  
                     To Mounsieur de L'orme, Physitian in ordinary to the King, and Treasurer of France at Burdeaux. LETTER XXIX.
                     SIR, it is not now onely that I make a benefit of your friendship, I have had profit by it a long time, and you have often bin my advocate with so great force, and so good successe, that they who had before condemned me, were glad to revoke their sentence as soone as they heard you speake yet all this while you did but onely speake well of me, now you begin to doe well for me; it is you whom this yeare I may thanke for my pension. Without you Sir my warrant would never have perswaded my partner, it would presently have beene rejected, and he still have continued einexorable. But it must bee confessed there is no wilde beast but you can tame, no matter so bad but you can make good; as you heale maladies that are incurable, so you prevaile in

causes that are desperate, and if you finde never so little life and common sence in a man, you are able to restore him to perfect health, &amp; make him become a reasonable man. I desire not to have the matter in any better termes then you have set it, I am glad I shall not need to invocate M. the Cardinall for my dispatch, and that Mounsieur—hath promised not to faile to pay me in September. If he should pay it sooner, I should bee faine to desire you this favour, to keepe it for mee till that time. Now I onely intreat you, to draw from him a valuable assurance of it, and for so many favour's and courtesies done me, I shall present you with something not altogether so bad as those I have already shewed you; and seeing one cannot bee called valiant for having the better of a coward, neither can I bee accused of vanitie, for saying I have exceeded my selfe. I am therefore bold to let my Letter tell you thus much, that if my false Pearles, and my counterfeit Diamonds have heretofore deceived you, I doe not thinke that the shew I shall make you of my new wares will use you any better. Yet my meaning is not to preoccupate your judgement, who neither of my felfe not of my writings will have any other opinion then what you shall please to allow me. Since the time I have wanted the honour of seeing you; I have made a great progresse in the vertue of humilitie, for I am now proud of nothing but of my friends affections; Let mee therefore never want

yours, I entreate you, as you may beleeve, I will all my life, most passionately be,
                     
                        Sir,  
                        Your, &amp;c.

                     To my Lord——LETTER XXX.
                     MY Lord, I hope you will not take it ill, that I put you in minde of a man, to whom you have heretofore made demonstration of your love; and that after a long intermission of these petty duties which are then troublesome when they are frequent, you will give mee leave to tell you, that I have indeede omitted them, but more by discretion than by negligence. I know Sir, you have no time to lose; and to put you to the reading of unprofitable words, what were it; but to shew an ignorance, how much the King imployes you, and how much the State needes you? It is therefore the respect I beare to your continuall imployments, that hath caused my

                        lence; and I should be very absurd, if in the assiduitie of your cares, I should present you with little pleasing amusements; and should looke for an answer to some poore compliment,

when you have so many commandements of importance: and so many orders of necessitie to deliver forth. It is enough for me that you doe me the honour to cast your eyes upon the protestation I make you; that in all the extent of your command, there is not a soule more submisse, nor more desirous to beare your yoake, then mine is; and that as much, as any in the world, I am,

                     To Mounsieur Senne, Theologall of the Church of Saints. LETTER XXXI.
                     SIR, you neede not wonder to see your name in the Booke I fond you: Lovers you know, leave markes of their passion; and if they were able, would fill the whole earth with their Cyphers and devises. It is a custome as ancient as the world, for with that beganne writing also 
                           〈◊〉

                        . If any man wonder, I should be in love with a Preacher; why wonders hee not at that Romane, of whom a

                        Grecian said, that he was not onely in love with Cato, but was enchanted with him? You have done as much to other

                         in this country; and I have as many Rivalls as you have auditors. Yet there is not the same Object of all our affections: they runne after your words, and hang at your mouth: but I goe further, and discover in your heart, that which is better than your eloquence. I could easily resist your Figures and your Arguments; but your goodnesse and your freenesse take me captive presently: I therefere give you the title of a perfect friend in your Encomium: because I account this, a more worthy qualitie, than to be a perfect Oratour: and because I make most reckoning of that vertue in a man, which humane societie hath most neeede of. For other matters, Remember your selfe, in what termes I speake of the businesse you write of; and that onely to obey you. I have beene contented to alter my opinion. I was well assured, the enterprise would never take effect; but I thought it better to faile by consenting than by obsti

                        acie, and rather to take a repulse, than not to take your counsell. I have known along time that fortune meanes me no good, and the experience I have of her hath cured me of the malady of hope and ambition. Make mee not fall into a relapse of these troublesome diseases, I beseech you; but come and confirme my health: you Sir that are a soveraigne Physition of soules, and who are able to see in mine, that I perfectly am,

                     SIR, having heard of the favourable words you used of me at the Court; I cannot any longer forbeare to give you thanks; nor stay till our next meeting from telling you, how highly I esteeme this favour, I cannot but confesse, I did not looke to finde so great a graciousnesse in the country of maliciousnesse; and seeing, that the greatest part, eveu of honest men, have so much love for themselves, that they have but little or none left for strangers; I thought with my selfe, that the infection of the world had but lightly touched you; and that either you had no passions in you at all; or at least, but very coole and moderate: but I see n
                           •…
                        w, that you have more generousnesse in you than is fit to have, amongst men that are interessed; and that you put in practise the Maximes of our Ancestours, and the Rules of your Epictetus. It is I that am for this, exceedingly bound unto you; seeing it is I that receive the benefit of it, &amp; that am the Object of your vertue You may then beleeve, I have not so unworthy a heart, as not to feele a resentment answerable to so great an Obligation; at least Sir, I hope to shew you, that the Picture mine enemies have made of me, is not drawne after the life; and that their colours disfigure

me rather then represent me. I have nothing in me Heroicall and great, I confesse: but I have something that is humane and indifferent. If I be not of the number of the vertuous; I am at least of their side. I applaud them whom I cannot follow, and admire that I cannot imitate. I am glad if I can be praised, not onely of the judicious and wise, such as you, and our Mounsieur de Boissat are, but even of the simpler sort that are honestly minded, such as—I know Sir, how to love in perfection, and when you shall know me better, you shall confesse there is none that can be more than I,

                     To Mounsieur de Uoyture. LETTER XXXIII.
                     SIR, If I did not rely upon your goodnesse, I should take more care than I doe in preserving your favour: and I should not let a messenger goe from hence, by whom I should not persecute you with my Letters. But knowing, you are no rigorous exactor of that which is your due; much lesse expect I should give you more; I have conceived, I might be negligent without offence; and that having an absolute power over mee as you have; you would

use it upon me, with the moderation of good Soveraignes. And I should still continue to follow mine owne inclination, which findes a sweetenesse in idlenesse; if I did not thinke it necessary to advertise you that I am in the world; least you should thinke all your courtesies lost, that you have done me. I would have beene glad I could have loved you all my life long without any kinde of interest, or temporall consideration; yet it troubles me not to give honour to my friend, by giving him matter for his vertue to worke upon. I am content you shall hold the higher part in our friendship, which is to doe good, but then I looke to hold the lover and lesse noble part, which is to acknowledge; and this is so setled in my heart; that a greator cannot be desired from a man exceedingly sensibly, and exceedingly obliged. But though it were so, that you had no tie upon me; and that without ungratefulnesse, I might forbeare to love you; yet I intreate you to beleeve, that the knowledge I have of your worth and merit; would never give me leave to do it; but that the naturall respect we owe to things that are perfect, would alwayes binde me infinitely to honour you, and to be with all my soule, as I am,

                     Another to him. LETTER XXXIV.
                     SIR, you are welcome from Flanders, from England and from Spaine. I am not onely glad for your returne; but I refresh my selfe after your voyages. For if you know it not, I must tell you, that my spirit hath gone these voyages with you; &amp; you never passed the sea, that I was not neare a shipwracke. They that knew what it is to love; will not mislike the noveltie of this compliment, I have borne my part in all the fits of your Feavour: I have drunke part of all your potions; I have accompanied you in all your strange adventures. It is therefore great reason I should give you thankes, for giving my friendship rest, and that by fiuishing your travell, you have finished my unquietnesse. It is better Sir to be a private man at home, where there is courtesie and freenesse, than to be a Lord Ambassadour among publique enemies; and if the Iewes said well, that the Graves of Judea were more beautifull than the Pallaces of Babylon; why may not we be bold to say, that the Dirt of Paris, is better than the Marble of Madrill? It is a juster thing to adore M. the Cardinall, than to put off ones hat to the President Rose, or to the Marquesse of Aitona; and it would have beene a newes no lesse shamefull than lamentable, if we had

come to reade in the Gazets these pittifull words; A Sonne of France was waiting for the King of Spaines rising up;

                     Thankes be to God, the face of things is changed, and a great Princes libertie hath cost but the life of a good Horse. At our next meeting, you shall tell me all the fortunes you have passed; and in requitall thereof, I will tell you newes out of the Wildernesse: and it shall be at Mounsieur de Ch

                         Chamber, that our conference shall be; at least if you care any thing for it; and that I be in his favour still. How soever, this I am sure, he can never love any man that honours him more perfectly than I doe, or that hath a greater opinion of the beautie and noblenesse of his minde. Hee is alwayes one of the deere objects of my thoughts; and I still take him for one of those true Knights, which are no where to be found now, but in the History of France. I want such an example before my eyes; tostirre up the faintnesse I feele in my duty; and to thrust me forward in the love of Vertue. The least of his words makes my spirit but higher and greater, the onely sound of his voyce gives the both life and strength; and I doubt not but I should be twice as good as I am; if I could but see him once a moneth, and make a third in your excellent

conferences. But this is a happinesse which is at home with you, but farre off from mee, though I have a designe to come nearer to it; you injoy it to the full, and leave to others onely a desire of it and a jealousie, and jealous indeede I should be if I did not love you more then I love my selfe, and if being bound to you for a thousand favours I did not acknowledge my selfe more bound to take a contentment in your good fortune. Enjoy then your happinesse, sir and never feare I will oppose it, seeing I shall alwayes preferre your contentments before my owne, and shall be all my life,

                     SIR, I am a thirst for the waters of Uya, ever since I heard you thinke them to be wholesome; the reputation you give them hath made me to send for them, to try whether this Drug will do me any more good then others; I am apt to beleeve for the satisfaction of my taste, that there are no better medicines then those that, are least compounded, and which come ready

made from the bosome of our common mother; but specially I have a confidence in nature when shee comes authorized by your judgement, and hath the warrant of so esteemed a name as yours, and by this meanes Sir you have saved mee a voyage into Italy; For so but for you I was taking a journey of two hundred and fifty Leagues upon the word of an antient Poet, to the end I might be of those happy ones, of whom he writes these verses,

                     I have since received your learned Letter, wherein you prescribe mee the order I must hold in using this wholesome disorder, and teach me to drinke with art; in truth you have more care of mee then I am worthy of, my health is no matter of any such importance that it should be managed with such curiositie. It is not worth the paines you have taken in treating of it so learnedly, and writing these two leafes of paper you have sent me.

                        nto you for this favour, yet I doubt whilst you set me at so high a price, there is none will take me for such as you would vent me; but I regard it not, I bound my reputation by your account, and desire no other Theater nor other world but you; It sufficeth mee that in your spirit I enjoy the glory you give mee, and sweetly possesse my good fortune, which I know I merit not if you weigh it in the Skales of Scrupulous justice, but which you will yet preserve to me, if you have regard to the passion with which I testifie unto you, that I am,

                           •…
                        on continue, I shall bee forced to give place to envie, and to goe

waite in the place where you are for a change to time, which in this kingdome is so adverse unto me. It is indeede my adversaries designe to make all sorts of governments my enemies, and not to suffer me to breath at liberty, either in Monarchie, Aristocracie, or Democracie. You have seene his manifests printed, which have flowne beyond the Alpes; you know the cunning he useth to draw the publike state upon me, and to make mee ill thought of, as well by the Kings Allies as by his Subjects. He goes about to banish mee out of all states, to shut all places against me that are open even to fugitives, and not to leave my innocencie one corner of the earth to be in safety; yet Sir let him doe his worst, and practise what hee can, I hope you will beare me out to say, that he shall never hinder me from having a place in your heart; nor be able to take from mee this pleasing refuge. And besides that Ambassadors houses enjoy the priviledges of the antient Sanctuaries, and that there is neither justice nor violence but hath respect unto them; I assure my selfe your onely affection will interesse it selfe for my safety, without any other publique consideration, and that you will defend me as a thing deare unto you; though the defence of a man afflicted were not otherwise in it selfe, a thing worthy the dignitie of an Ambassadour, and wheresoever you shall have power to speake, I shall be sure of a strong protection, being as I am assured of your good word, and this eloquent mouth, which perswades

the wise, and makes that appeare which is just, shall gaine no doubt a good opinion of my cause to the undertaker, and a favourable censure of those judges at least that I acknowledge. I expect this issue from your almighty Rhetoricke, and hope Sir that in these troublesome incounters you will double your love and your good offices unto mee. Though I should be worse intreated of the world, and of fortune then I am, and should have nothing before my eyes, but lamentable successes, and deadly presages, yet you would remember how that Cato stood firme upon ruins, and held himselfe constant to a side which the gods themselves had abandoned. I doe not thinke my case is yet in this extremitie, it hath yet subsistence and foundation; and as it is not so badde but that an honest man may maintaine it with a good conscience; so neither is it so weake but that a meane courage may undertake it without feare. The Gentleman that brings you this Letter hath promised to make you a more amplē relation hereof, and to informe you of my whole story. I humbly intreat you to give him audience, untill I come and crave it my selfe; and that I assure you in your Pallace amongst your other Courtiers, that I truly am

                     To Mounsieur de Thure, Doctor of the Sorbone, and Chanon of the Church of Paris. LETTER XXXVII.
                     SIR, my deare Cousin, the newes you sent me surprized me not, I am so accustomed to receive disgraces, that I finde in this nothing extraordinary; it is true I am a little more sensible of it then of the former, and the place from whence it comes makes mee take it a little more to heart; yet seeing you seeme to compassionate my miserie, I finde my selfe comforted of one halfe of it; and having you for my Champion, I feare not what my persecutors can doe against mee. Suffer mee to call them so, that sollicite your Colledge against me; and make it lesse favourable to me, then I had good right to hope for. It is not their zeale of Religion, nor interest of the publike that sets them on worke; it is an old spight they beare mee, which I could never master with all my long patience, it is the hate of a dead man which lives still in his Tombe; it is his rellicks that warre upon me; and whereof some ill disposed French doe serve themselves to disgrace a worke which hath no other end but the honour and service of the King. I never doubted of your good nature, and I know if neede were, your charitie would

cover the multitude of my faults; but in this ease I thinke I have reason rather to aske justice at your hands, and to tell you, that if you take the paines to consider my words as I meant them, and not as my enemies corrupt them, you will easily grant they containe nothing contrary to the orthodox doctrine, or that is not maintaineable in all the Schooles of Christendome. This being so my deare Cousin, I doubt not but you will strongly defend my cause, at least my person, and will be pleased to assure my Masters of your fraternitie; that having alwayes accounted their Colledge as the Oracle of true Doctrine, and as the interpretor of the Church in this kingdome; I could not wish a more sweet or glorious fruit of my travailes then to see them entertained by so learned and holy personages, that my greatest ambition is but to merit their good acceptance, and to deserve their favourable censure, and if for obtaining of this I have not either happinesse enough, or not enough sufficiencie, I have at least Docible
                           •…
                        esse enough to learne of them that which I know not, and to confesse that in their learned conferences they possesse the secret and certaintie of all holy points, whereof wee in our private meditations have but suspitions and conjectures, that if I were assaulted by strangers I could perhaps make a shift to resist, and that with successe, but that I preferre obedience which I owe before a victory which I might get; that I desire not to contest with my fathers, nor pretend to have

reason against their authority, to which I submit my selfe in such sort, that I am resolved to assure my selfe of nothing, but upon their word and credit, and from hence forth to acknowledge no truth, but that which they shall please to teach me: I leave it to you to augment, to reforme, or embellish this compliment, as you shall thinke fit; I make you Master of the whole businesse: and never meane to disavow any thing you shall doe, being absolutely,

                     To Mounsieur de Uougelas, Gentleman in Ordinary to my Lord, the Kings onely Brother. LETTER XXXVIII.
                     SIR, I humbly intreate you to take for your selfe, all the excuses you make to mee; and to beleeve that I have alwayes a love answerable to your vertue: though I say it not so often, as by the lawes of Civilitie I am bound to doe. Since the comming hither of Mounsieur de—: you have beene the most ordinary and most pleasing subject of all our conference; and I am

much more curious to heare of your studies, than to heare all the newes of the great world. Yet I intend not hereby to aske it of you with importunitie; and to engage you in a Commerce of unprofitable words, which would but wrong your necessary imploiments: I am well enough satisfied with the assurance I have of your love; and am well contented you should keepe your compliments for those you love not so well, when I shall finde my selfe to stand in neede of you: I am not growne so bashfull, but that I can use the libertie, I have long used; and yet doe you no inconvenience by my freenesse. Hitherto it hath afforded you nothing but trouble; and it was your evill Angell that inspired you with a desire at first to be acquainted with me. But one day perhappes I shall be mure happy; and for so many and great favours you have done me, it may be you may draw from me some small argument of acknowledgement. In the meane time Sir, I desire you, not to cast upon mee a reputation, which I am not able to maintaine; make no more mockes at my pratling; and hide the shame of your friend, which your other friend hath published. Hee onely is guilty of the fault that was done; and you may well thinke, I was not so impudent to send false Latin to the Vniversitie of Paris, as much as to deliver false money to the Mint; and thinke to make Mintmen take it for currant. It shall suffice mee, that you approve of the French, I meane to bring you; or at least, that you make it worthy

of your approving, by making it new, with your corrections. If Mounsieur Far

                     SIR, my last Letters, are great Bookes; and I have nothing to adde, but only that I intreate you to t
                           •…
                        ke the paines to reade them over again, and to draw them into heads for the helpe of your memory, which though I know to be very excellent, yet I know also, it is extremely full of businesse, and that I am but the five and twentieth of your Clients I set downe nothing so precisely, but that I leave you liberty to change my orders, if you finde them not fit; and to saile with the winde. Nothing but good successe can be expected from your sterning
                           •…
                        ; you will so manage, I assure my selfe,

my resentments with Mounsieur de—, and make him see so much respect and modestie in my griefe
                           •…
                        , that he will perhappes be sorry he ever disobliged me. I assure my selfe also, that when you fall upon my Chapter, where I treate with Mounsieur—that you will not carry your selfe, as onely my instrument, and as one that hath charge of me; but that you will doe as an honest man should, that is perswaded to it by the truth, and interessed in the cause of oppressed innocencie. Concerning the perfumes I desired of you, I could wish you would bring me a shopfull; but you must use some body else to chuse them for you, for you know them not your selfe, but onely by name; and you may perhaps have the oyle of Nuts given you for the oyle of Iasmin; Et du pain d'espice, pour des pastilles. So it is that petty things are unknowne of great personages: you would thinke you should doe your selfe wrong to descend to such pedling wares, and of an Ambassadour, and a Philosopher, become a Merchant and an Apothecary; yet Aristipp

                           nes pitied. You send me word, that Mounsieur de—hath great Designes in the Commonwealth of Letters; and that he is resolved to be an Authour and a Preacher both at once. If you remove him not from so dangerous a resolution, you shall see Bookes that will be the Funeralls of common sence; and let but the

name be changed, and it will besaid of his Sermons, as an excellent man of our time, said of the Sermons of Fryer Lazarus;
                     
                     
                        Peu de zele, moins de Science

                        Preschant des Cas de conscience
                        N'estoit quasi pas apperceu.
                     
                     As much as to say; that though the Clocke hath beene long a striking, and that hee hath beene talking a long houre, yet so little heëde is taken of him, that none will beleeve there is any man in the Pulpit. Before he comes to the Ave Maria, all his Auditors are out of the Church, and hee may call them Apostataes from the word of God, and Fugitives from the Church; yet with all he can say, he shall never make one of them to come backe. I have not these two yeares written thus much, with my owne hand; it is to me, as one of Hercules labours: and can you then doubt, how much I would be willing to doe, to doe you service? I kisse the hands of all the Family, which you see; and which I honour exceedingly; and am,

                     SIR, I love you better than I thought, since you parted from hence, I have had a number of Alarums for you: and though I stand in convert yet that keepes mee not from the foule weather of your voyage. But I hope by this time you are upon returning; and that shortly, we shall sit by the fires side, and heare you tell your adventures of Beausse, and of Mantelan. Whatsoever Mounsieur de—have said unto you, when you tooke leave of him; I doe not thinke, that in all the whole Discourse, there can one passage be found, that is subject to any badde interpretation: if it be considered as a member depending upon the body, and not as a piece that is broken off. There may perhappes be found some proposition, a little bold, but never to goe so farre as rashnesse: the Antecedents and the Consequents so temper it, that if a man will not be too witty in another mans intentions, hee can never make any doubt of mine. It was never intended, you know, but onely to prove a Monarchie to be the best forme of governement, and the Catholike Church to be the onely Spouse of Christ, Neither yet doe I write so negligently, but that I am ready to give a reason of that I write; and am able to

defend my opinions against those particular persons that oppugne them; for as for the soveraigne authority, you can witnesse for me with what humility I submit my selfe unto it. The day after your departure Mounsieur de——came to Balzac, whom I kept with me three whole dayes; I never saw man lesse interessed, lesse ambitions, lesse dazeled with the splendour of the Court; and to speake generally, better cured of all popular diseases. By this I come to know the noblenesse, and even the soveraigntie of reason, when it is well schooled and instructed, we neede not mount up to heaven to finde cause of scorne in the littlenesse of the earth, the study of wisedome will teach it as well: A wise man counts all things to bee below him; Pallaces to him appeare but Cottages, and Scepters but baubles, it pitties him to see that which is called the greatnesse and fortune of Princes, and from the heighth of his spirit,

                     I have at last found the Letter you required of me, which I now send you by this Post; our good father hath taken a coppie of it, and saith it is fit to be kept for an eternall monument in our house; and addes moreover that Erasmus never had so much honour done him by the Sorbone, which instead of condemning my

divinitie hath given a faire testimony in praise of my eloquence; for so hee pleaseth to call the little ability I have in writing; for it is his custome to make choyce of very noble termes for expressing of very vulgar qualities. For your selfe Sir, you know it very well, and I intreate you to advertise our other friends that know it not, that all this testimony and all this honour that is done me, is happened to mee by a meare mistaking. I had satisfied the desire of the Sorbone long before it, if I had understood they desired any satisfaction from me; but two Editions of my booke comming forth at one time, my charitable neighbours in my absence delivered the Sorbone the lesse corrected Copy, in which indeede my proposition was not so fully cleared &amp; unfoulded as was fit, but never told them that in the other Copy I had cleane taken away all colour of wrangling, and justified before hand, that wherein I imagined they could finde any thing to say against mee; I expect to heare by the next messenger of your comming to Paris, and am with all my heart,

                     SIR, my Philosophy is not of so little humanity, but that I grieved exceedingly at the reading of your Letter, and was touched to the very quicke, for the death of—yet seeing he is happier then they that mourne for him; and that he hath left the world, in an age when he yet knew it not; I thinke it no wisedome, to be obstinate in an ill grounded sorrow,

or to account that an evill to another, which is the greatest good, could have happened to my selfe. Christianity will not let me say, Optimum non nasci, Bonum vero quam citissime interire: but it hinders me not to believe, that one day of life, with Baptisme, is better then a whole age of iniquity. I write this letter to you from—whether I am come to lodge, after I had entertained my Lord—untill n
                           •…
                        ght. I conceived, there was some necessity, to deliver him your Letter with all speede; and therefore I exposed my person to all the injuries of an incensed sky; and ventured to make a voyage, that would have frighted a stouter man then my selfe. By this you may know that I count nothing difficult, which reflects upon any interest of yours; or which concernes your contentment; and I love you so much, that I should not say so much, if I had more craft in me then I have. But my good Nature exceedes al other considerations of vulgar Prudence; and I would not keepe you from knowing what great power you have over me, though I knew before hand, you would abuse this power. For other things, I am very glad to heare, you beginne to grow sensible of the charmes of musicke, and that Consorts are in reputation with you. Yet I have seene the time, when your eares were no learneder then mine, and when you made no great difference betweene the sound of Lutes, and the noyse of Bells. See what it is to frequent good company; and to live in a Country of neatenesse. I

that stirre not from the Village, know no other musicke, but that of Birds; and if sometimes I heare a more silver sound; it comes from those noble Animals, which Mounsieur Heinsius praiseth so much: and which by Lucians saying, serve for Trumpets in the Kingdome of the Moone. I give you a thousand thankes for your newes; but specially for the last: it is certaine, that the choice of Mounsieur de Belieure to be Ambassadour for Italy, is a thing will be generally well liked; men talke wonders already of his beginnings: of the readinesse and Vivacitie of his Spirit, of the force and stay

And for my selfe, who am one, that love my Countrie exceedingly; I cannot but exceedingly rejoyce, in this new fruitefulnesse which comes upon him, at the latter end of his old age. It doth me good to see famous deceased men, to live againe in their excellent posteritie; and I doubt not of the good successe of a Negotiation, where a Belieure, a Thou, or a Sillery, is imployed. These were our Heroes of the long Robe; and the Princes of our Senate: and now their children (that I may continue to speake Latine, in French) are the Princes of our youth, at least they are names more happy, and that portend more good to France, then the name of—and no doubt, she will have cause to thanke M. the Cardinall, for respecting races, that are so deere unto her: and for stirring up in the Kings

the old inclinations, of the Deceased King his Father. I fall a sleepe alwaies, when I am talking with you, and am rather in case to make ill dreames, then good discourses: and so I take my leave of you, my deare and perfect friend, as I also am to you, as much as possibly can be,

                     To Mounsieur Talon; Secretary to my Lord the Cardinall De la Ualette. LETTER XLII.
                     SIR, I tooke infinite pleasure, to see my selfe in one of your Letters; and Mounsieur——who imparted it to mee, can witnesse for me, with what greedinesse I read that passage which concerned me. I cannot say, that he is here, though it be true, that he is not in Gascognie; for we enjoy nothing of him here but his Image; he is so married, that he would thinke it a disloyalty to his wife, if hee should dare to laugh when shee is not by. All his sociable humour he hath left with her, and hath brought nothing to us, but his Melancholy.

When I would make him merry, he tels me, I goe about to corrupt him. All visites he makes in her absence, though it be to covents, and Hospitals, yet he calls them De bauches. So as Sir, you never saw man better satisfied with his present estate; nor a greater enemy to single life. He is not contented to pitty you and me, and to lament our solitude; but he reproacheth us outragiously, and cals us unprofitable members of the Common-wealth, and such as are fit to be cut off. As for me, I make no defence for my selfe, but your example; I tell him, let him perswade you to it first, and he shall soone finde me ready to follow his counsell. I hope we shall meete together ere long; and then we shall not neede to feare his being too strong for us, in our conferences, when we two shall be against him alone. Provide therefore Solutions for his Arguments; but withall deny me not your assistance in other encounters, where it may stand me instead. You can never doe courtesies to a man more capable of acknowledgement; nor that is more truely, then I,

                     SIR, I am exceedingly well satisfied with the newes you send me; and with the assurance you give me by your Letter of the continuation of your Friendship. Not that I was afraid, I should lose it, but because it is a pleasure, to heare ones selfe called happy; and that one cannot have too many titles for a possession, which can never be too much valued. I take not upon me to contend with you in Compliments; or to dispute of civility with you, who live in the light of the world; and have whole Magasins of good words. For besides, that I never had any skill of the Cou
                           •…
                        ; it is now so long I have beene a countriman, that it were a miracle, if I had not cleane forgot it all. Pardon therefore a rudenesse which I cannot avoide, and seeing I am not able to answer you; give me leave to assaile you, and require you to give a reason of the present state of things: What can you say Sir, of these wretched Flemmins, who shut their Gates against good Fortune when she would come in to them? and are in love with their Fetters, and their Keepers? I doe not thinke there be truer slaves in all Asia: and I doe not wonder our Armes can doe no good in their Country, seeing it is a hard matter to take a yoake from

mens heads, who preferre it before a Crowne: and Soveraigntie when it is offered them. Sicke men are then to be despaired of, when they throw their medicines on the ground, and account of Potions as of Poysonings. It is not therefore our fault if they be not cured: wee have active power enough to worke, but it must upon a matter that is apt and disposed. I expect hereupon a Decree from your politician; and remaine,
                     
                        Your, &amp;c.

                     To Mounsieur D'Espernon, Marshall of the Kings Armies. LETTER XLIV.
                     SIR, my compliments are very rare; and I take no great care for preserving your friendship. I account you so true of your word, that I cannot doubt of having your love, seeing you have done me the honour to let mee have your promise. It is to no purpose to sollicite Judges that cannot be corrupted; It is enough for procuring their favour, that the cause be good. You see therefore, I doe not much trouble my selfe to commend mine unto you, and I present my selfe so seldome before

you; that if you had not an excellent memory, you had certainely forgot mee long agoe. I pray you not, to doe me good offices: for knowing that you let slippe no occasion of doing good: I may be sure to have my part of your good deedes, though you have none of my prayers. Your new Acquests at the Court; make you not leave that you have on this side the Loyre: your friends that are alwayes with you; take not up all your heart: there is some place left for your friends farther of: of which number I am one; and more in love Sir, with the comtemplative life, than ever. I am alwayes under ground and buried with my trees; and they must be very strong cords, and very violent cōmandements that should remove me: yet I am contented to give my thoughts a libertie: and my spirit is often in the place where you are; and my absence is not so idly bestowed, but that I can make you a reckoning of it. I speake to you in this manner, because I know you are no hater of delightfull knowledges, and have an excellent taste to judge of things. Though by profession you be a Souldier; yet I refuse you not for a judge, in our peaceable difference; being well assured, there are not many Doctours, more accomplisht, or of a founder judgement than your selfe. This qualitie is no opposite to true valour; the Romanes, whose discipline you seeke to reestablish; used to leade with them the Muses to warre; and in the tumult of their Armies, left alwayes place for these quiet exercises. Brutus read Polybius,
                        
the night before the battell at Philippi; and his Vncle was at his Booke the very houre before he meant to die. Never therefore feare doing ill, when you follow the example of such excellent Authours: none will ever blame you for imitating the Romanes, unlesse perhappes the Crabates or other enemies, as well of Humanitie as of France. But to be thus blamed by Barbarians, is an infallible marke of merit; for they know no points of vertue, but such as are wilde and savage; and imagine, that roaring and being furious, are farre more noble things, than speaking and reasoning. I leave them to their goodly imaginations; and come to tell you, that though your Letter to my Sister, be dated from the Army in Germany; yet it is eloquent enough to come from the Academy of M. the Cardinall; it neither smells of Gunpowder, nor of Le pais de adieu pas; I know by certain markes, I have observed in it, that your Bookes, are part of your Baggage; and I finde nothing in it, that is worthy of blame, but onely the excessive praises you bestow upon mee; and if you were not a stout champion, and able to maintaine it with your sword, you would certainely ere this, have had the lie given you a thousand times for praising me so. I should be verry sorry to be a cause of so many petty quarrells; and so unworthy of your courage; a forraigne warre hath neede of your spirit; make not therefore any Civill, for my sake; I desire no such violent proofes of your affection: it serves my turne, that you love me quietly; and

if you so please secretly too; to the end, that our friendshippe being hidden, may lie in covert from; injuries; and that possessing it without pompe, I may enjoy it without envie. I reckon it alwayes amongst my solidest goods, and will be sure never to lose it, if perfit faithfulnesse will serve to keepe it; and if it will suffice to be; as I most passionately am,

                     To Mounsieur de Roussines. LETTER XLV.
                     MY deare brother, I have upon this last occasion, received nothing from you, but the offices I expected; I know you to be just and generous, and one that will alwayes religiously pay whatsoever you owe, either to Bloud or friendship, yet this hinders me not from being obliged to you, and to your good Birth for it. This hath bestowed a friend upon me, which I never tooke paines, either to looke out, or to make; It is a present of Nature, which I should have taken, if shee had given me my choise. I desire you to beleeve, that I never stood lesse in neede of comfort than now; Loppose nothing against the rage of a

thousand adversaries, but my scorne: I am Armour of proofe against all the tales from the Suburbs St. Honoré; and from all the Libells of the streete St. Iaques. They encrease daily in sight, and if the heate of their spirits doe not abate, there will shortly be a little Library of follies written against me. But you never yet heard, of such a gravitie as I haue, nor of a mind that could take such rest in the midst of stormes and tempests as I do, and this I owe to Philosophie, under whose covert I shelter my selfe: it is not onely, higher than mountaines, where we see it raine and haile below us: but it is stronger also than a Fortresse, where wee may stand out of danger, and make mouthes at our enemies. All that hurts me in the warre of——; is that, which concernes the interest of others: it grieves me extremely, that his crueltie should leave me, and fall upon my friends. I wish I could have bought out the three lives, that touch the honour of—with a third Volume of injuries done to my selfe, and where no body else, should have any part: and I may truely say, that this is the onely blow, which that perfidious enemie hath given mee, that goes to my heart; and the onely of all his offenses that I have felt. I intreate you to let my friend know of my griefe; and to make sure unto me this rare personage by all the cares and good offices your courtesie can devise. His Vertue ought to be inviolable to de traction, but drtraction will not spare Vertue it selfe, but takes a delight in violating the

best things. I have reason to place him in this ranke, and considering him as one of the most accomplisht worke of Nature; I must needes consider withall, that Nature it selfe, is sometimes calumniated. Madame de—enquires often after you, and hath a great opinion of your heart and spirit. You may be sure, I say nothing in opposition to the account, she holds you in; but am rather glad to see my judgement confirmed by so infallible an authoritie: see, you be alwayes good; and alwayes lay hold upon our antient Maximes; and be assured, I am and alwayes will be

                     To Mounsieur Breton, LETTER XLVI.
                     SIR, you are a man of yourword, and something more. You promise
                           •…
                         lesse than you performe, having undertaken to furnish me but with Gazets; you extend your largesse to large volumes of Bookes. This Jonnius, whose Verses you sent me is no ordinary man. The boldnesse, and beautie of his phrase, comes veri neare the greatnesse and magnificence of

                        Horace. Hee chuseth and placeth his words with the same precisenesse, and care; he speakes alwayes loftily, and if in all things there be bounds and limits; hee sometimes seemes to goe beyond them. For example, upon the Canonization of Ignatius, made by Pope Gregory the fifteenth;
                     
                        Nam te ille primus Vaticanis ritibus Admovit aris Caelitem
                        Mixtumque superis aureo curru dedit perambulare sydera.
                     
                     A Pagan Poet could have said no more of the deifying of Iulius Cesar, yet in saying so much, he should have said too much: there being great difference betweene consecrating the memory of a mortall man, or the giving him a Divinitie, between the declaring, or the making a God; between being Augustus, or being Iupiter. I know not also, why speaking of Protestant Ministers; he stands so punctually to descant upon the word, which of all cōceits is the poorest;
                     
                        Maleque ominata Verba &amp; inter Obscana
                        Exinde lege publica reponendum
                        Solus Ministri Carnifex geret nomen.
                     
                     I should thinke, that this descanting, makēs not much for the honour of Princes chiefe counsellours; and it seemes, the Poet in this place, forgot M. the Cardinall; who guides the publike fortune and governs the world under this name of Minister. There is no great reckoning to be made, no great matter to be built upon three or foure little syllables, which signifie

nothing, but what custome, without any reason pleaseth, &amp; are of no more value than use gives them. This word Vates, is taken sometimes for a foole, sometimes for a sor
                           •…
                        erer, sometimes for a Prophet: and the word Prophet it selfe, is sometimes taken for a Juggler; witnesse the Greek; Proverbe 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        : Will you upon this goe raile upon Prophets, and send them with their name to the Grave, or shut them up Dans le petites maisas? and yet further to endeere this subtilty of Ionicus, you may say that Ministers at all times have beene enemies of Christ, and prove it by this, because a Minister was one of those that stroke him on the face in presence of the high Priest; as it is sayd, U
                              •…
                           us ex Ministris Caiphae, &amp;c. The ground upon which such Figures are built is so weake and ruinous, that there is no meanes to make it stand firme: our adversaries may make use of it as well as wee, and to be even with you for your Text of the Minister of Caiphas, they will I doubt not bring you another Text where our Saviour himselfe is sayd to be a Minister, come to execute in the world the decrees of him that sent him, and to doe the eternall will of his Father. This is called triumphing for syllables and words, and running after Phantasmes. If the antient Rome had used to play in this fashion, Bishops called by them Pontifices would have beene but makers or Bridges, nor Dictators any more then Schoolemasters. Poc

the Beshie would not have had one day of rest, they would have beene forced to get themselves adopted into some other Families, and to change their names, thereby to save themselves from the opprobrious Figures of Orateurs and Poets. I meant to have written but two or three lines, and I am come to the bottome of my Paper; this is the pleasure to bee talking with you that deceives mee thus, and makes me thinke that we are walking together and conferring about our Bookes and Studies. After all that hath beene sayd, I conclude that your Poet is a great Lyricke Poet, and would have had a Pension of Augustus, and have sate at Table with Mecoenas. I bid you good night, and am,

                     SIR, I am at leasure for no body but you, and though I am pestred with a multitude of small affaires, yet I quit them all to come and tell you, that I have received your last dispatch, and finde my selfe infinitely obliged to Mounsieur de—seeing you put

me in hope that hee will spend this winter at Paris, I purpose at that time to bee a daily waiter upon him, and try what I can doe to mend my fortune. I am told that you are growne friends with the graces, and will no longer be any enemy to honest pleasures. Hold you firme I beseech you in this resolution, and never give it over if you meane well to your life. There is no danger in refreshing your selfe sometimes with pleasing companie, that so you may returne more fresh and vigorous to your learned exercises. It is better to bee innocently merry at the Inne in Venice, then to goe kill ones selfe in the vaute of the Church, as the poore—I lament him in truth as a man dead and miserable, and it greeves mee he had not time to bethinke him of his soules health, and to aske pardon of God; but to concerve that by his death a great light is extinguished, and that the world hath lost a great man; I knew him too well to have any such opinion. Hee was to say true a man of mettall, and

                         of wit that were not unpleasant so long as they were not biting; but who would endure him to be enrolled amongst moderne Authors, or give hisverse a place amongst the Poets of this time? yet he him selfe counted his courage and his military vertues as nothing in comparison of his eloquence and excellent gift of speaking &amp; writing, wherein he was so highly conceited of himselfe, that onely for telling him one day of it he never loved me after, and is dead I assure

my selfe with a heartburning against me for it. They that reproove me for writing Nonvelles. Victorienses in my first Letter to M. the Cardinall, make it appeare they are no farre travellours in the Latin Country, and never come to discover Victrices literas, Laureatas literas, Nuntiam laurum, &amp;c. Malice is a very unjust thing, but ignorance much more; Homine imperito, you know the rest. And never take offence that there bee some will not so much as allow mee for a Grammar Scholler, and perhaps have reason. Wee oftentimes thinke our selves to bee the true owners of things, of which indeede wee are but usurpers; there is nothing secure against wrangling, every thing is matter of suite in this wretched world, yet I meane not so easily to yeeld and give up my right, for if I were not able to write according to the rules of Art, I must certainly be one of a most dull capacitie, and altogether uncapable of all discipline. For did I learne nothing by seeing the Cardinall Perron? nothing by being a Schollar in the French tongue under Master Nicholas Coeffeteau? nothing by a thousand conferences with the good man Malherbe? and lastly nothing by lodging with father Baudoin? Vel in Bicipiti somniasse Parnasso? for one is as much as the other, as you know well. This man in truth is no ordinary father, his conceptions and productions are without intermission; he fills our studies with his bookes; he amends, reformes, embellishes the bookes of others; hee smells a

Barbarisme or an incongruitie seaven miles off; hee hath counted by tale all the improprieties that are in——: hee is admirable in the knowledge and use of all particles, and I am sure he loves me not so little to hide any secret or mysterie of all his knowledge from me; I intreat you to kisse his hands for me, and to beleeve that I am most truly,

However I must put on a resolution for all events; and comfort my selfe with Philosophie, and with you; you that are my true and faithfull friend, and that stand betweene mee and all the stones my enemies throw at mee. Your affection is no small helpe to me in these troublesome encounters,

and the tendernesse you shew to have of me, bindes me in a very sensible obligation to you.

When time and place serves we will handle him as hee deserves, and doubt not but his lightnesse shall light heavily upon him; onely doe you collect some common places upon this matter, and remember your selfe of all that hath passed betweene—to the end the history may not be lost. I have had speech with the man whose whole life is nothing but a continuall meditation of death; I never found him so austere, nor so great an enemy of bravery as now; his devotion respects neither right of nations, nor lawes of civillitie. I have not beene able to get him to write to that person that loves him so dearely, and complaines to you so often about it. All the answer he returnes to his long Letters, are but these three words of the Gospell, Noli amplius peccare, which in sweeter and more courtly termes is as much as to say,

I received the other day a most elegant and gentle Letter from one Mounsieur Ytterius, a Lawyer of Antwerpe; but I know not by what meanes it came to my hands, nor by what direction to returne an answer. Pray enquire after him, and let our friends know that in spight of the Marquesse of Aytona, I have adherents in Flanders, and therefore hee neede not make his bragges for having burnt my booke at Bruxells. Scilicet illo igne, vocem omnium Gentium, &amp; libertatem Europae, &amp; conscientiam generis humani abolere arbitrabatur. By the next Post I will write to Mounsieur Hottoman, and will give Mounsieur de la Pigeonnerio thankes for the verses you had of him to send me. Wee have read them here in good companie, both of Males and Females, and they all agree that the Fathers my adversaries are none of those Christian Ulysseses, hee speakes of, that have nailed their Passions to the crosse of Christ. I forgot to aske you of Mounsieur Seton, and to desire you to call to him for the papers hee promised me. I regard him as one of the great Doctours of our age, and make use of the riches of his Spirit with so great privacie that hee seemes to be but as it were my Treasurer. I know not how to make an end, nor yet am willing to say more, because I must reserve something for Monday next. I therefore take my leave, assuring you there is none more truly then I,

                        SIR, I make use of you with the like libertie as I desire you would make use of me; if therefore you have any spare

                           , you may allow it to the affaires of — but so as you allow it to mine first, and that you make a difference betweene friendship and courtesie. I doubt not but you will give your best advice to the Gentleman that is recommended to you, and will set forward the best you can the designe we have to make him one day an honest man. I finde the Booke more neately and more correctly printed then I could have imagined; and I would tell you that you are an able Grammarian, but that I feare your Divinitie would be angry for giving you so small a Prayse, and so much vilified by the Messieurs our Masters. The two tracts you sent mee are as different of stile as they are of matter. Any man that can but rellish the antient puritie will take the first of them for the worke of some Romane that lived in the times of the republicke, but the other can bee but the writing of some Gaule or Spanyard that came to declaime at Rome, in the raigne of the sixth or seaventh Emperour. One meetes at the beginning with something that dazells and makes a faire shew

of some great good to follow, but at the bottome there is no such matter to bee seene; nothing but swelling and obscuritie, oftentimes false traines, and every where bragges and bravadoes that are not tollerable. It is a pleasure as I am told to heare this famous Authour talke of himselfe; hee thinkes his Penne as much worth as the King of Swedens sword, and no lesse fatall to states and Princes. Hee saith it is he that bestowes glory or dishonour, makes men famous or infamous as he pleaseth, and th

                           t he hath meanes enough to be revenged of the Emperour or of the Pope, if the Emperour or the Pope should offer him any wrong. Scaliger, Lipsius and Casaubon were by his owne saying but his Forerunners, and all the light of the former age, but the Aurora of his, and yet for all this he hath but a very little head, and but very staring eyes, and but a very sumbling speech, and but a very silly discourse, that you may know his judgement is not the predominant part of his soule. But the world talkes otherwise of him; that he is a lost man, and one that hath forfeited his braines, not onely swallowed up of a strong and vaste imagination, not onely bending under the burden of an overcharged memory, but apt to lose himselfe in the walkes of Platoes Philosophie, for which yet he is become an Apostate from Aristotels doctrine. I confesse unto you now that the time hath beene I have made much reckoning of this man, and am still of those ill husbands that give presents, but pay no debts.

It is certaine I discharge my duty extreamely ill; and Mounsieur Videll hath just cause to thinke me the most uncivill man that lives. But you know the secret of this matter, and that in my incivillitie there is a kind of Religion which I have not dared as yet to violate. Vnlesse I should sinne against my

                            faith given, I can neither enjoy the good he hath done me, nor give him the thankes I owe him, and this is the extremitie of my miserie, that I have received a most pretious gift, and yet can neither be rich by it, nor thankefull for it. Take some course for Gods sake, that I may dispense with an oath that is so contrary to honestie, and so directly crosseth the right of nations and all good manners. Intreat our friend to give me my libertie againe; which I have solemnly promised to imploy wholly in doing him service, and in accommodating that confusion which makes me commit this disorder. Mounsieur de Plassac hath so powerfully confuted that which I writ the other day to Madam D'Anguitour, that I am become perswaded my selfe, and am no longer of my owne opinion, but willingly confesse that if I should bee obstinate in desending my false maxims, I should doe as ill as make a schisme amongst Ladies, and bee the Author of a most pernitious doctrine. I have put his Letter in my packet, that you may see I yeelded not for nothing, and that you may shew it also to Mounsieur—who hath desired me he might see it. The Encomium of Mounsieur de la Valette, which your

brother desired of me; is in the 103. Booke of the Histories of Mounsieur de Thou. Change but the date onely, and you will agree with me, that it was certainely made for our Mounsieur de la Valette, that is now. I send it you by this Post, and remaine,

                     To Mounsieur de Gues. LETTER L.
                     SIR, my most deare Father, you have obliged me exceedingly unto you; for imparting unto me the good newes that is come, and for communicating with me, the joy you take, in the happy successe of the Kings Army. I doe not thinke he hath a better subject in all his kingdome, then your selfe; never servant was more zealous for his Masters greatnesse; never Persian more religiously adored Monarchy. You love your children, I know infinitely, yet this is but your second love; that of the State, and of the Publicke, goes farre before it, and I feare me, you would give us all for the poorest Frontier Towne of Flanders, or for any paltry Fort of Millan. That which I read in the Postscript of your Letter, did not so very well please me, the good opinion, which Mounsieur de—hath of me, is more a burthen to me, then an honour: and I could wish, he would make lesse reckoning of me, so he would let me be more at quiet. You have a strange friend of him; to take me for his common places, and to thinke that I am an Index. for finding out conceits and figures. In the matter, you propounded to me on his behalfe; I can say no more then what I have said already,

but if he please to take the paines to Translatē my French into Latine, he may easily doe it in such sort, that he shall be taken for the Author, and I but for the Translatour. I have told you, of the Dignity of the Language, in which he meanes to write, and what great advantage it hath over ours; it is certaine, that it elevates and raiseth up the low thoughts of the Authours; and gives much more to them, then it receives from them. Whereas ours contrariwise, hath no beauty, but as the Authours embellish it and set it out; It hath no subsistence: but by the matter, no force, but from the subjects that are handled. I have made choice of some, which I thought fittest for his purpose; if he finde them for his turne, hee may make use of them: and better them much, by putting them into Ciceroes stile and phrase: and these are they. Good men ought to desire great Dignities, as a necessary meanes to performe great atchievements; which if they performe not; both God will call them to account, for his graces, no better employed, and the world will justly complaine, it is left a prey to the wicked; and that the desire of their owne private quiet, makes them abandon all care of the publike. This is to tell you my Lord, that you ought to reserve your humility, for actions that passe betweene God and you; but that for other matters, you cannot have too much credit, nor too much greatnesse, seeing it is fit that wisedome should be obeyed, and that there are some vertues which cannot be acted by those that are

poore, &amp;c. Though we be not so out of the world, but that we heare newes of it; yet it passeth through so many places, that it cannot chuse but receive divers impressions; and can never come to us in purity, seeing it gathers 
                           •…
                        dde, in comming but from the Louure. Yet I have come to know, and fame hath sounded in our desart, the great battles that have beene fought for the honour of Fance, and how you have vanquished the spirits of strangers; which is a greater victory, then to vanquish their forces. I have come to know, that Italy hath rigged up all subtilties, and imployed them to deceive us, and yet could not, and that these Spirits which thought to raigne in all assemblies, and to be the Masters of reason, have not beene able to defend themselves against you, but with spight and choller, Nor to complaine of any thing, but that you perswaded them to that, which they came resolved never to doe, so as they which called us Barbarians; and got alwaies as much by their Treaties, as they lost by our Victories, have found at last, that there is wisdome on this side the Alpes, as well as beyond: and are driven to acknowledge, that we had a man amongst us now, able to hinder them from deceiving us as they had done. They wondred to see a servant, that could not endure there should be a greater Master then his owne, that felt the least evils of his Country, as if they were his proper wounds, and thought it a hurt to himselfe, if there were but an offer made, to touch the Dignity of this Crowne, but when

they saw that you: applyed remedies upon the suddaine, to all inconveniencies which they thought you could never have avoyded, that you not onely answered all objections they made, but prevented all they intended to make, that you dived into their soules, and tooke hold of their intentions there, and at the first conference, made answer to that which they reserved for the second, then in truth their fleame turned into choller, and then you quite rooted all their humane Prudence, and all their politicke Maximes, &amp;c. I am not able to dissemble the joy I take, to heare that your good services are acknowledged, that when divers counsels had beene tryed, yet yours at last was still faine to be followed, and that in guiding the fortune of France, you are no lesse President of all affaires of Europe. It is true, that of all externall contentments, I have none so sensible to me as this, but on the other side, when I heare that your health, is continually assaulted, or at least threatned by some accident or other; that the rest which the quietnes of your Conscience ought to afford you, keepes you not from having unquiet Nights, and that in the midst of all your glory, and good successes, yet you oftentimes are as it were weary of your life, then in deede, &amp;c. And can it not be, that you should come to heare the publicke acclamations, but in the unquietnesse of your watchings? nor of your praises, but in your paines: Must the Sense suffer, and the Spirit rejoyce? Must you be upon the Rocke, when you are in your Triumphs?

Must you doe two contrary workes at once, and at the same time, have neede both of moderation, and of Patience: if vertue could be miserable, and that the sect which accounts nothing evill but paine, nothing good but pleasure, were not universally condemned. Certainely the divine Providence, would at this day be complained upon, by all places of this Kingdome: and all honest men, would in your behalfe finde something amisse, in the worlds governement. But my Lord, you know better then I, that it is the happinesse of beasts onely, of which we must beleeve the body, for as for ours, which resides in our highest part, it is as little sensible of disorders that are below her, as they which are in Heaven are uncapable of offences by stormes of the aire, or by vapours of the earth. And this being so, God forbid, that I should judge of your condition, by the state of your health; and not thinke him perfectly happy, whosoever is perfectly wise. Doe but imagine with your selfe, that you have made a division of the infirmities of humane nature, with other men, and then you shall finde the advantage is on your side, seeing there is in you, but a small portion of paine, for infinite passions and defects that are in others. Yet I cannot but thinke, that the tearme of your patience is neere expired, and that the time to come, is preparing contentments for you that are wholy pure, and wil make you young again after the time, as before the time you have made your selfe old. The King that hath need

of your long life makes no wishes in vaine, and heaven heares not the prayers of the enemies of our state. Wee know of no successour fit to undertake what you leave unfinished, and if it be true that our Armies are but the armes of your head, and that God hath chosen your counsaile for establishing the affaires of this age; why should we feare a losse which hath no right to come but to our posteritie? he will not in this only point leave imperfect the happinesse he hath promised us; he loves men too well to deprive them of that good which you are borne to doe them. When Armies are defeated there may new be levied, and a second Fleet may be set forth when the first is lost; but if you my Lord should faile us, &amp;c. It shall be in your time that people oppressed shall come from the worlds end to seeke the protection of this crowne; that by your meanes our Allies shall bee well payed for their losses, that the Spanyards shall be no conquerours, but the Fronch shall be the f

It shall be in your time that the holy seate shall have her opinions free; that the inspirations of the holy Ghost shall be no more oppugned by the cunning of our adversaries, and that there shall be raised up couragious hearts, worthy of the antient Italia, and able to defend the common cause. Finally my Lord it shall be by your wis
                           •…
                        dome that there shall be no more tyrannie in Christendome, nor rebellion in this kingdome: That the people shall leave in their superiours hands both liberty and religion; and

that from this legall government, and from this perfect obedience there shal arise that happinesse which Polititians seeke for, and which is the end of all civill societies. My hope is that all these things shall come to passe thorough your wise government, and that after you have made sure our peace and our neighbours, you shall your selfe enjoy the benefit of your good deeds with pleasure and at your case, and shall see the state of things continue flourishing, whereof none but your selfe have beene the Author. I earnestly entreate you so to deale with Mounsieur de—that he may rest contented with this; and dispense with me for any new meditation which would require more leasure then I am like to have. This bearer will deliver you the History of Queene Elizabeth, which may serve you for a recreation till the end of the weeke, and then I shall come and aske your opinion, and desire you to give me some light of that time out, of the great experience you have of many things. I desire of God with all my heart that he will be pleased to afford you yet some great matter to exercise your selfe in, and that this wise old age of yours which wee so much admire may long continue to be a strength and ornament to your family. These are my earnest wishes, and withall, to make you by a perfect acknowledgement of your favours, a perfect proofe that I am,

                     To Mounsieur de Boisrobert. LETTER LI.
                     SIR, the Muses never favoured man as they doe you; you are the onely man that neede neither retr
                           •…
                        ite nor leasure for your meditations; In the troubles of the world you possesse your spirit in peace, and seeing the bruite of the court diverts not your attention, neither can the Sea and all its waves hinder your compositions. It is no small advantage to finde that solitude in ones selfe, which others seeke for in the Desart, and not to bee bound to goe out of the world for setching in of sound opinions and perswasive words. If the merit of yours take place, we shall shortly see at Comaedies as many long Cassocks as short robes, and the most austere Philosophers will have their hands and eyes in the recreations of the people, and so Sir of a mischiefe you shall make a remedy; you shall set timourous spirits at liberty, and shall free us from two terrible monsters, scrupulousnesse, and vitious bashfulnesse. You make mee long to beare a part in this action, and in this sort to defend the Theater; to take the field after you is not so much to fight as to pursue the victory, and I thinke it no wrong to vertue to justifie an innocent pleasure, and that which is onely worthy of her; this we owe to Iason, to Masinissa,
                        
to Brutus, and to other worthy men, who live at this day in the person of the man you so much commend, and whom I admire as often as I heare. It is certaine that the grace with which he pronounceth verses gives them a degree of goodnesse which the Poets could not. They are more beholding to him that pronounceth them, then to him that made them, and this second father (if I may so speake) purgeth by his adoption all the vices of their birth; the tune of his voyce accompanied with the dignitie of his gestures gives a kind of noblenesse to the most vulgar and base conceits. No soule is so strongly fortified against the objects of sence which he forcethnot; No judgement so wary and so well prepared, which is not caught with the imposture of his words in such sort, that if in this world there be any happinesse for verses, it is certainly in his mouth, and in his pronouncing, by which as evill things get the colour of good; so good things get the uttermost of their perfection. Let me know Sir whither I hit right upon your inclinations, and in the meane time I give you many thankes for your many favours, particularly for the Letter of my Lord you tooke the paines to send me. Hee writes indeede in the stile of a Conquerour, and these words Accepi, legi, probavi, savour much of these, Veni, vidi, vici, of Iulius Caesar, and of these 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        , of another Caesar that was afterwards. Though I should never receive other marke of his love but this, yet were this

a full recompence for all the passion I owe to his service; yet I must tell you, I cannot forget the honour he hath done mee, in procuring me a promise that I shall be payd of——I have done all possibly I could to blot this thought out of my minde, but I confesse unto you that my imaginative part is a little strong. I could never hitherto satisfie my selfe herein, and what bad answer soever I receive from men yet still I relie upon this word of God, who commands me to hope well, and therefore I waite still for the accomplishment of the Oracle. All our world is extremely bound unto you for remembring it, and I am my selfe more then all the world together,
