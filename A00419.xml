            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

               HOw euer the greatnesse of your
place, or the necessitie of the
times, may challenge your vertue
(most Noble Lord) to bee
wholy taken vp, in the contemplation
of high, and serious affaires,
as ambitious or couetous
to enjoy a full and absolute
man, and making euery thing
that is not equall with your worth, too much too inferiour for
your eye; yet this excellent glorie of Nobilitie, well tempered
Curtesie (in which you are flowing rich) persuad
                  •
                me
that the arguments handled in this Booke, shall not appeare
so triuiall in your Iudgement, but that as to the tale of an honest
Husbandman, you will bend your Noble eare. And
though not for the bettering of your owne knowledge, yet for
the benefit which may spring vnto your neighbours, grant it
your most Noble patronage and defence, from the stormes
and frosts of Enuie and Detraction: It first belonged to
your most Noble and Heroical Father, as the gift of a

learned and well experienced Gentleman, who in the translation,
tooke a long and well-meriting labour; it must needs
then, now be yours, both by order and inheritance. And
though when it came to kisse his hand, it was all French, except
the language, so that many wanted skill to make vse,
and some were fearefull how to vse a knowledge so differing
from their practise: yet now it is put into other garments,
and how homely soeuer the stuffe be; yet it is cut with
that art and iudgement, that without doubt, it will both endure
the wearing, and become any Husbandman of
this Kingdome; or the other, who were first breeders
of the same: to whose particular profit I leaue
it, and my s

So I am vndoubtedly persuaded (right honourable) that you hauing
made your chiefe and speciall choce of the things which are
from aboue, and striuing therein to set vp your rest of contentation,
would with like delight haue welcomed some such thing, as

any course, countrie and domesticall discourse (such as I am here to

a turfe, or matter for a mattocke. And indeed I could haue wished
that the Heauens had stoupt as low to haue reuealed vnto you some
of her sacred mysteries: as the earth hath aduanced it selfe herein,
and opened her mouth to shew vnto you her cabinet of rich prouision,
and casket of pretious iewels. Or else, that according to your
place and calling, some Caesar had affoorded you some learned
Commentarie of Martiall Stratagems: or some Lycurgus, such treatise
of Policie, as wherein you might haue had pointed out and delineated,
as with Polycletus his golden rule, the exquisit rules of vpright
iustice and lawes of Common-weales safe gouernment. But

And Tempus in agrorum cultu consumere dulce est, haue not suffered
them to want their due laud and praise: so the common and delightfull
reading and studying of the second; besides the lawrell
garland and fauour, with preferment, at the hands of the mightiest
Princes, euer readie and ordained for good writers, doth sufficiently
declare their merit and desert; yea vnlettered and senselesse

in penning and pointing out the summe of all that art and cunning.

reuenues will liberally reach, taking heed of pordigalitie; and
stirreth thee vp to the knowledge of the ordering and dressing
of ground, or whatsoeuer other thing: that so thou mayest not
onely see what is to bee done, and how, but also iudge thereof
when it is done. If an inferiour person and hauing nothing
but what thou labourest for, lacking also skill, and
so suffering thy field to grow barren: hee teacheth thee all good
meanes for the making of it fruitfull. If for lacke of will,
pouertie come vpon thee as an armed man, know that there
is neuer a precept of paynefull toyle and laborious husbandrie
throughout the whole Booke, but it soundeth an alarum, and
proclaimeth an open defiance against thee as a Sluggard. If
through skill ioyned with will, thou reape the plentifull increase
of a rich Haruest, but abuse it, to the malitious vexing
and troubling of thy neighbour in the Law, or to the corrupting
of the honest and chast liues of Maides, or any of thy
neighbours Wiues, hee calleth thee from such courses vnto the
labours of thy ground: for scarce to take thy lawfull recreation
at lawfull delights (such as are Hawking and Hunting)
will hee affoord thee any leasure: If a Farmer, hee teacheth thee
kindnesse by deuising something to gratifie thy Lord withall; and
gentlenesse in louingly intreating thy seruants. If thy neighbour
enioy any goodly commoditie of Grasse, Corne, or other dead
thing, or any other liuing thing whatsoeuer that is excellent, because
hee would not haue thee to looke vpon the same with a repining,
greedie, and couetous eye; hee calleth thee to the prouiding
of such of thine, by teaching thee how to doe it. If thou
bee a seruant, hee willeth thee to bee both painefull and pittifull;
that so all thy businesse may bee well done, and in due time: and the
beasies wherewith thou art charged, may bee tendred of thee in all
mildnesse. And finally, that all vnhonest and disgracefull waies
may bee farre from thee, hee hath taken the paines to instruct
thee in so many things, as that if thou wilt applie thy selfe thereunto,
and to doe them well: thou shalt not find the leasure to lend
a thought to the euill that might allure thee. And that he might
not bee mistaken and thought to forget that woman was made

for a helper, hee hath called her to her taske, and that neither
little, nor consisting of a few or base things, hauing committed
vnto her (besides many other matters) the cure and charge of
families health. But leauing to speake any more of her charge in
particular, I could wish all such of that sexe as are religious, to
looke before they leape, and to bee wise according to sobrietie and
grauitie: Sobrietie, not medling, aboue their place and reach, in
matters of Physicke: and Grauitie, as not hauing any thing to doe
in the matter of Fukes, either for vsing or preparing of them; seeing
they argue, if not plainely proue, a light, a loose, and very sinfull
life.
            
            And finally, seeing that the whole earth was once a Tempe,
an Eden (that is, a place of all pleasures and delights) and
the assigned possession and naturall inheritance of man and woman,
to labour and liue in, with exceeding great ioy and felicitie;
and that through their sinne it was cursed, and they were cast out
of the most pleasant, commodious, and beneficiall part thereof:
I could wish them iointly to record such their former felicitie, and
the losse thereof, to the end that they may applie their hearts vnto
wisedome, and learne, that although they doe continually labour,
yet if they wallow in sinnes, they doe but throw downe twice as
much as they build vp, destroy and marre mare they make,
driue farre away the creatures of meate and maintenance, which
they labour so greedily to scrape and pull vnto them, and euen
bereaue the earth (if it were possible) of all manner of fruits
and increase, that so it might not any more either feede or cloth
them: For knowledge, skill, toyle, paine, rising early, lying
downe late, with euery other helpe, doth loose his vertue and
come short of his end, if delight of sinne bee ioyned as a companion
therewithall; it being the heauie load and burthen vnder
which all creatures doe grone; the burning ague that drieth all
sappe and moisture; and that cursed seede which causeth them as
a vaporous brood not onely to fret out their mothers bowels, and
bring a curse vpon her bodie; but thereby also to curse and crosse
themselues in all that wherein they would most gladly thriue and
prosper.

                  What manner of Husbandrie is entreated of in the
Discourse following.
                  
                     EVen as the manner of building vsed at this day,The varietie of Countries causeth a diuers manner of labouring of the earth. for the couering
and rest of men, is nor like vnto that of old time:
so we see the manner of the labouring of the earth for the
nourishment and sustenance of the same, to differ greatly,
according to the Countries, Soyle, Grounds, and Situation
of the Places wherein they are seated: yea, there
is not so much as their language, apparrell, or household-stuffe
and working tooles, but they change after the fashions
of Countries, which notwithstanding doe not hinder,
but that in euerie thing wee may be as well fitted as they which went before vs. By
this we may see our late kinde of Husbandrie to attaine and bring with it the like issue
and effects which that of the Auncients did, which is nothing else, but to liue of
the encrease of the Earth, well husbanded and tilled by vs.
                  Wherefore I haue thought it impertinent and vnseemely to tie my self to the seuerall
sorts of labour vsed of men in times past, and that because that Countries inhabited
by diuers sorts of people, haue, according to the seuerall varietie of them, euerie
one affoorded many particular and seuerall sorts of liuing; as also for that it
hath alwaies beene the custome of men (to the end they might the more easily fit and
apply themselues to the good liking of others) to compose and frame themselues according
to the manners of the Countrey, without affecting, either by the reading of
old Writers, or their owne ouer-reaching curiositie (the ruine and ouerthrow of all
good wits)Ouer-much curiositie the ruin

knowledge of them, men haue beene brought oftentimes vtterly to spill, spoyle, and

borders of his quicke-set hedge shall containe a frame of Railes in forme of an Arbor
for Vines to runne vpon, for the furnishing of our household store with Veriuice,
and other necessarie hearbes for the house: and we shall not altogether neglect or forget
to prouide and plant in the same place hearbes sit for medicine. And yet furthermore
in this garden also you shall plant things to make your profit vpon, as Saffron,
Teazill, Woad, red Madder, Hempe, and Flaxe, if it seeme not better to reserue
this part of Husbandrie for fields that are full of Fennes or waterish Places. In
the other part wee shall make a garden for flowers and sweet smels, with his ornaments
and quarters, garnished with many strange Trees. About the Hedge we shall
set, for to make pottage withall, Pease, Beanes, and other sorts of Pulse, as also Melons,
Citrons, Cucumbers, Artichokes, and such like: in which place wee shall entreat
of Bees.

plant such stocks as whereon we intend to graft. After, or next hereto, our square of
old growne trees, and such as haue beene transplanted, taken vp, and remoued: and
together with these things we will write of Silkewormes, and prescribe the waies to
distill Waters and Oyles, as also to make Cyders.
                  
                     
Next in order to our foresaid Greene plot,The Summe of the fourth Book. lying neere some one or other little
Brooke, we are to lay our Medow Grounds, or Pastures for feeding, compassed about

to these, the great and large Medowes for the prouision and reuenues of the

We will also make mention of Parkes for wild Beasts, of the hunting of them, but
that in a few words (for there is no need that a good Householder should trouble his
braine with much hunting) and of the breeding of Herons. Finally, we will briefely
describe the order and manner of taking of Birds. So that after all these things,

                  CHAP. III.
                  What things are requisite before we goe in hand with building
of this Countrey Farme.
                  
                     AS concerning the proprietie of Inheritance (whereof manie Authors, both
Greeke and Latine, haue entreated so exactly and curiously) I doe not at
all intend to incomber my selfe therewith, supposing, that this Countrey
Farme, and the Land belonging vnto it, is either descended by succession,
and that there is an intent to make it in such case as may serue most commodiously to
the ease and good liking of the owner: or that (if you haue purchased and bought it
with your money) you haue c

                     eered it from all incombrances and claimes before you
goe about the building and sitting of it in euerie point as you would haue it. For like
as some say,The Kitchin must be the first piece of building in a good house. that the first foundation of a good House must be the Kitchin, that is to
say, the Reuenues and Grounds thereto belonging for the maintenance of the same:
euen so, the first point and principall care of an Householder, before he build or trim
vp his House, is to bethinke himselfe how he may make the state entire and absolutely
vnto himselfe, and so to haue nothing to doe with such as are vnder age, Creditors,
Rentors, or others in superiour place, which may interrupt and commaund him from
his intended purposes and necessarie affaires.Purchase by statute, the surest of al others. He must also see, that all such Charges,
Rites, and Customes, as Law doth require, be fully answered, and by name that it be
cleere of all former Sales▪ Bargaines, and Statutes, which is the safest manner of purchasing
in these daies:That there be 
                           〈◊〉
                         foolish buyers than sellers. for there are found a farre greater number of foolish buyers
than of foolish sellers. Let there be past a yeare and a day before he make any exchange,
raising and mouing of new debts, for the cleering of his Inheritance, and let

him not lay out to the value of a penny, before he haue fully ended all things, measured
and bounded his grounds from his neighbors, and assured his peace euen against
the most wayward and troublesome. To be short, let him be free from all manner
of Courts and Sutes: and if it cannot be otherwise, but that one or other controuersie
doe still hang vpon him (seeing,That Land

and bring with them strife in the Law) yet let it be of such nature, as that he may
be plaintife rather than defendant: I meane in respect of duties to be performed to
the chiefe Lord, and other impositions by the Prince; in discharging whereof, euen
to the vttermost Penny, Capon, or whatsoever else it be, he ought to be no lesse carefull
and diligent, than in mending one tyle in the roofe of his house, which in course
of time being left vnrepaired and vnput in againe, causeth others also to fall, and so
causeth great annoyance to the lodgings vnderneath.

House, as should be so perfect and exquisite, at that nothing should be wanting
therein, I might iustly seeme to my selfe to be void of all reason. It is verie true, that

skill to content themselues otherwise than with the situation of their owne Countries:
some of them sometimes being too hot, too cold, verie subiect to corruption
and putrifaction; othersome lesse profitable for the bringing forth; and some againe
of a meane and indifferent condition, and contrariwise. Notwithstanding, although
the place be not so fertile as a man could wish, neither yet so commodious as that
great Husbandman Cato doth desire it; yet it must be prouided and foreseene aboue
all other things, that it haue the benefit of a good Aire: for suppose, that the grounds

make choice of a place farre from marishes, farre from the Sea shore, and where as
neither the Southerne nor Northerne winds doe ordinarily blow, and which lyeth
not altogether open to the South Sunne, nor yet vnto the North: but principally see
that it be placed neere vnto some one or other good and honest neighbour,Neere vnto a good neighbor. seeing it
is an insupportable thing to be daily haunted of a brawling and wicked neighbour:
let it not be placed neere to Holds or Townes of Garrison, thereby to auoid the
outrages of Tyrannie, and inrodes of Souldiors:Farre from places of garrison. let it in like manner be farre from
Riuers and Brookes, which are subiect to ouerflow, and that in respect of the vnauoidable
charges for the repayring of such ruines and spoyle as such ouerflowings
doe cause.Farre from Riuers and Brookt And yet I could willingly wish, and greatly desire, that it might not be
farre off from some smooth and gentle streame, able to beare a ship, to the end that
victuals may with the lesse cost be transported thence to other places for your better
commoditie sake: as also neere some great good Towne, that so the things of readiest
sale may be sold for the best aduancement and making of the most of the reuenues
of the same. Although to wish to haue a Farme in euerie point so perfect and
well seated, as that nothing should be wanting vnto it, were (as hath beene said)
an vnreasonable thing: as it is also to expect or looke for grounds and fields so well
conditioned, as a man could desire in a ground of speciall and principall praise and
commendation. It is true, that besides that Necessitie doth beget skill, and prouoke
and stirre vp men to take all possible paine, industrie, and care; it doth also procure,
that there should not that discommoditie be found to offer it selfe, which shall not
be recompenced and counteruailed either by one or other commoditie: as for example,
in hot places there are growne good Wines and Fruits of long continuance:
in cold places, great store of sweet waters, and sometimes sea-water, which greatly
encreaseth their profit: in others, for the most part, when the Earth is barren in the
vpper part, it containeth some good things vnderneath, as it falleth in Stone-pits,

where we must dwell and settle our habitation: and if it be not such as some
curious man in his desire, or one that is hard to please, might require and looke
for, then wee shall straine our selues to mend it by the meanes see downe hereafter.
                  There are verie few Farmes to be found so seated, as that there is not something
to be supplyed, as want of Water in high and ascending places; such as are the Countries
of Beaux and Campaigne, notwithstanding that their grounds there be strong,

sort, as that the earth, cast vp by the way, may retaine moisture a long time: and if
the ground proue it selfe strong, you shall not need to manure and dung it so oft,
neither yet to let it lye fallow more than euerie fourth yeare. If you cast Pits,

you must digge them of a conuenient widenesse and length, that is to say, fouresquare;
but somewhat more long than wide,Pits called Aranques. after the fashion of the Pits Aranques,
which are in vse in the gardens of Prouence and Languedoc, with their trough laid
to the brinkes of the Pits, to receiue such water as is drawne: but if the water be so
low in the ground, that such kind of Pits cannot be made, then there must Pits be
made to go with a wheele, and those so large, as that at euerie draught you may draw
vp halfe a pipe of water at the least, which you shall emptie into particular troughes,

such water is nothing wholesome for men, as neither yet for beasts; it were farre better
to straw with greene hearbes all the bottome of the said Cesterne, and cast in little
pebbles of the Riuer vpon them, for by this meanes rather the water would be
made better.

to set your building so well, as that it may take the Easterne Equinoctiall, and not
lose the rising of the Sunne in March and October, or rather in September.
                  If there be euer a Hill,A Hill to build vpon. build vpon the edge thereof, making choise to haue your
lights towards the East: but if you be in a cold Countrey, open your lights also on
the South side, and little or nothing towards the North, if it be not in your Barnes
where you put your Corne, or such other things, as are subiect to the Weasell and
other vermine. Ouer-against the North you shall procure some row or tuft of Trees
for to be a marke vnto you of your place, and defence also for the same against the

Northerne windes in the Winter time. But if you be in a hote countrey, you must set
your said tuft of Trees on the South side, against such windes and heat of Sunne as
come from thence, and boldly open your lights, especially in the said Barnes which
lie on the North side.
                  Make good choice of the best parts of your Grounds, to be most fit for Fruits,
Corne, and Medowes, and plant your Vineyard, to haue the South open vpon it.
You shall make also certaine crosse Barnes with their counter-windowes, in the place
towards the South, to open them in the time of a Northerne wind. Such places are
found in Countries full of Mountaines, which doe greatly desire the East; and yet
notwithstanding would therewithall take part of the South, which is so needfull for them.
                  In this and such like places Wells are in greater request, and much more necessarie
than in valleyes and plaine grounds, and that wee may find out the place where it
is best to make them, wee must chuse the Easterne side, at the beginning of the descent,
somewhat therewithall bending towards the North, but wee may not haue any
thing to doe with the Westerne side: and yet somewhat better toward the South,
where hauing ouer night digged the earth in diuers places the quantitie of three
feet ouer and fiue in depth, and after returning in the morning at the Sunne-rise, you
must make triall how it soundeth, being strucken with the end of a Holly staffe, armed
at the said end with some round peece of Iron or Latten, after the manner of the
end of a Shepheards staffe without the Crooke; and there, by the iudgement of the
eare, to obserue and marke how it soundeth vnderneath, as whether it sound like a
Mortar, or like fat Earth, Potters clay, or some other that is very hard, or like a Glasse
halfe broken, or else like a very deepe Pit, that toucheth the Quarrie or Veine lying
vnderneath: and this is the best way to iudge and make triall. Or otherwise in the
moneth of August or September, at such time as the Earth is verie drie, a little before
the Sunne rise, you must lye downe flat vpon the ground, hauing your face toward
the East, and chuse out that place where you shall espie a vapour to rise vp out of the
Earth, after the manner of little Clouds, for this is a token of a proud (or plentifull
store of) water. Or else to make a shorter triall, to make deepe trenches of foure foot
within the ground, and therein to put sponges or fleeces of Wooll verie drie and
cleane, couering them with boughs of Trees, or leaues of Hearbes: then, after some
time, to take them out of the Earth, and they being wet and moist, doe argue abundance
of water, according to the qualitie of moisture which they haue within them:
whereas if on the contrarie they be drie when they be taken vp, it argueth that there
is no water to be come by. Diuers there be that gather figures of the springing vp
of water in place where, by their seeing of small clouds and vapours rising from
thence into the ayre, in drie, faire, and calme seasons. But howsoever, it is not conuenient
to content ones selfe with the bare viewing of the hearbes which grow thereupon,
without hauing first made some triall: for vnder Crowfoot, Folefoot, Plantaine,
Dogtooth, Cinquefoile, Milfoile, and three-leaued Grasse, Water is not farre
to seeke, but it is naught worth, if one digge not verie deepe, as is to be seene at
Bagnolet Belle-Ville vpon the Sand, and other places of Liury. Vnder Veruaine is
oftentimes found good Water, and deepe, according to the nature of the ground:
and withall, if the head doe spring from grounds apt to boyle, as red Sand, or gray
Rocke, and not from those sides which by and by are dried vp. Aboue all, to the
end we may have Wells containing water of a good rellish,

springeth from the grounds where Sallowes, Roses, Reeds, and other such Plants,
which are engendred of a watrie humour, doe grow: for although that such places
doe yeeld great store of water, notwithstanding that water is naught worth, and will
easily be dried vp. Wherefore as much as lyeth in you procure that your Wells be
farre off from such ditches, as wherein they lay the dung of Stables, Cattell, or Swinecoats

to rot, or any other place which may annoy in regard of the pissing of beasts, if
they be not well digged and made verie deepe.Wells of good Water. True it is, that Wells will be a great
deal
                        •
                      the better, if they consist of a high rising water, and not such a one as lyeth
deepe in the earth. For howsoeuer that such Wells be lesse hot in Winter, and in
Summer lesse cold, yet notwithstanding it shall be infinitely better, because it hath
more helpe of the Sunne and Aire, which are the two things which doe greatly amend
and make better the water: and if necessitie force the water to lye so deepe and
low, wee must seeke to helpe the inconuenience, by drawing but a little, and oft, for
the iumbling and stirring of the water will rectifie it: and amongst other things, you
must haue speciall care not to keepe it couered.
                  FountainesFountaines. in like manner rising from such places of Mountaines, are had in request,
as well for the profit of the water, which is a great deale better and more pleasant
than that drawne out of Wells,To find out the beads of Fountaines. as also for the beautifying of the Country Farme.
And for to find their Head, or Spring, wee must vse the like meanes as wee haue layd
downe for the finding of Wells, excepted that wee must make chiefe choice of such
as breake forth vpon the North at the bottome of high and great Mountains, hauing
hollow places, and compassed about with plaines, for in such plaine grounds the water
gathereth it selfe together, and distilleth through the earth. Now this kind of
prouision of water is when you desire it in great aboundance: but if you stand vpon
and desire the best and most excellent water, you must make choice of high places,
and such as are not ouer-shadowed, the fall whereof doth enioy the Sunne-rising,
for water out of such Fountaines is a great deale more light and pleasant in tast, and
by how much it runneth the swifter and longer way in the Aire and Sunne before it
come to the bottome, so much it groweth the better; as when it falleth from high
Rocks, it is (as it were) beaten and broken in falling through the downe-right places
of stones and craggednes

full of Dogs-tooth, Plantaine, Fox-taile, wild Penny-ryall, transmarine Sage, which
is called Adianthum, Milfoile, Chameleon, and generally, all other hearbes and
plants, which grow without being planted, and are by nature greene, well branched,
good and thicke, and well flowred.

great heat of Summer, hath no moisture of raine left remaining in it, and then also
we may gather assurance of such as will neuer drie vp altogether.

Trees haue an oylie humour, and hot, which easily resisteth the hurtes which water
might cause: Next to them are those which are made of Pot-earth, if that the water
carried along in them were not the cause of breeding obstruction. These must be
two fingers thicke, and sharpe at one end the length of halfe a foot, to goe the one of
them into the other: the worst sort is those made of Lead, because the water carried
along by them purchaseth from the Lead an euill qualitie, and that because of the
Ceruse thereof, so that it oftentimes causeth bloudie fluxes and other such like diseases,
if we beleeue Galen and them which for this cause call the inhabitants of Paris
Squitters, because they vse Fountaine-water which runneth through Leaden pipes:
which point notwithstanding seemeth not to be without all doubt, seeing that Ceruse
cannot breed, nor be made of Lead, without vineger, and for that we see also diuers
Countries doe drinke of such waters, without being troubled with bloudie fluxes:
whatsoeuer it is, wee must set well together and soulder the pipes with a compound
made of vnquenched lime, and the grea

these things doe hinder corruptions and rottennesse which the water might cause.

make them way: if any Valley, we must reare arches, such as are to be seene in a Village

                  But it is not sufficient to haue found out those Heads of Wells and Fountaines,What Waters are best. but
we must further consider of the goodnesse and wholesomenesse of the Water, as
Aristotle teacheth vs: For seeing the greatest part of our life dependeth vpon the
vse of this element, it is requisite that the Master of the Household should haue care
to procure good Water, in as much as Water must be the most of his seruants drinke,
and that the Bread which he and his familie doe eat, is kneaded therewith, and the
greatest part of his victuals boyled therein. The best and most wholesome Water
of all others is Raine Water falling in Summer, when it thundereth and lightneth
verie much; and yet notwithstanding, Raine Water causeth costiuenes

Earth, and also by the Stones lying vpon the vpper part thereof, which otherwise
might haue fallen and beene cast there: in manner as sometimes it falleth out, that
men find vpon vntilled grounds the liuely shapes of Fruits and Corne gathered
together and growne vnto the Stone, which is to bee seene neere to Mommirall

Corne,Why the earth is termed by the name of a Mother. Fruits, Hearbes, Timber-trees, Mettals, Stones, and other things, and this

better by the leaues and hearbes of manie yeares, which of it owne accord it brought forth
before it was tilled, becommeth afterward sufficient to nourish and bring forth
great abundance of fruits: and so it commeth to passe also, that being robbed of her
former nourishment, in time it groweth leane, loosing the freshnesse and moisture
which was maintained by the couert, and therefore continueth not so fruitfull as it
was at the beginning.

but these craue rest, which is the principall remedie to helpe their weake and feeble
estate, and also to be sowne with varietie of graine, as after Rye, some kind of pulse.
The way to know such grounds is common: when the great Sand is fast and yellowish,
it is then found to be good for Corne; and when it is white and drie, it is good
for Wood and wild fruits. But it behoueth the Farmer to apply himselfe vnto the
nature and temper of his field,What is

                         to know the nature of great Sand. and according vnto it to sow and plant in euery place
such things as are best agreeing with them, as Pulse, Millet, Panicke, Ryce, Lentils,
Fetches, and other things, which doe not require great store of fatnesse. But in our
English Soyles we find, that our sandie and hard grounds doe beare best Barley at
their first breaking, or when they are fattest; after, Rye, Oats, Fetches, or Tare.
                  The strong,Strong grounds, heartie, and fat Soyle is good for Vineyards, and is apt to beare great
store of Wheat-Corne, foreseene that the yeare be drie, especially in the moneth of
May, but small store of any other encrease: yea, and if the times be much giuen to
raine, they will beare but a little Corne, and great store of chaffe. Yet if the Seedsman
haue a carefull hand in the bestowing of his seed, and doe not (as it were) cloy
or choake his ground therewith, these fat Soyles will beare very well and sufficiently
the first yeare, either whole Straw-Wheat, Pollard-Wheat, or Barley; and the second
yeare, Beanes, Pease, or both mixed together; and the third yeare, Wheat or
Rye, or both mixed together, which is called Maslyne or blend Corne.

harrow it and manure it verie oft with great store of dung, so you shall make
it better and lesse subiect to the iniuries of the Sunne, Winds, and Frost: but especially
desire that they may not be watered with raine, for water is as good as a poyson

Anjou, which are fertile in all manner of fruitfulnesse and aboundance of goods, rich
in Hills, Vallies, Pasture-grounds, Vale-grounds, Vineyards, and all sorts of fruits:

therewithall keepe this moisture and refreshment a long time; if in Winter time it
become not hard in the vpper part thereof; if without being husbanded or mended

and those good and well-rellished in their kinds: and if it yeeld great fruitfulnesse
of Corne: if by being watered, or rained vpon, it become blowne vp, and as it were
stretched out and blacke, and not hard bound, or turned white: if the water springing
forth of it be sweet, or if the greene soddes thereof being broken in pieces, and
steept two or three houres in water that is sweet and of a good tast, doe not marre or
make worse the tast of such water, which must be tried by tasting of it, after that it
hath beene strained and clarified: For naturally water issuing out from a spring, or
wrung from something that hath beene steept in it, retaineth and carrieth with it the

tast of the Earth: and on the other side, if the Earth steept in Water, the same Water
doe after such steeping yeeld a sweet and pleasant rellish: if cast vp, and two or three
dayes after throwne into the said ditch againe, it gather on a heape, and rise higher
than the said ditch; for in doing this, it shewes it selfe to be a fat Earth: and whereas
one shall doe nothing but pare the said ditch, without doing anie more, it will be but
indifferent: but and if he come not to touch the edges of the said ditch, it will be
light earth: furthermore, if it be watred with raine, it yeeldeth a pleasant smell. On
the contrarie,Naughtie earth. the Earth must be iudged of no value, if it haue not all these signes of
goodnesse: and principally, that which is cleauing like Glue, like Potters Clay,
Chalkie, Whitish, which shaketh and trembleth, which is too hard, rough, and
strong, which is watrie and marish, which hath a salt or bitter tast, which bringeth
forth Trees and Hearbes that are bitter, cold, and thornie, as Brambles, Ferne, Bryers,
Wormewood, Iuniper, Lauander, Broome, Butchers Broome, and other such like: as
on the contrarie side, Rushes, Roses, small Grasse, three-leaued Grasses, Thornes,
Dane-woort, wild Plum-trees, and such other things, doe shew the goodnesse and
fruitfulnesse of the Soyle: for the things aboue named are not found or nourished
anie where almost but in the sweet veines of the Earth. Yet, according to the opinion
of Serres, all Clayes which are blacke, gray, or marlie, albeit a little tough and gluie,
yet, if after their drying they become not hard, but crumble, and (as it were) fall to
cynders, or if they be not much subiect to a kind of vomiting or casting vp of water,
or to an extraordinarie excesse of coldnesse, they are to be reputed the fattest and
best Soyles for Corne, though not for the Vine: and though they are lesse apt to
breed or put forth Wood, yet the Wood growing vpon such Soyles is euer the best
and the longest lasting.

neither to couet greedily, or aspire to possesse other great and stately Farmes, when
he is not able to husband and till that which he hath alreadie in possession, if so be
perhaps that a man long not to bring himselfe wilfully into the danger of the Lords

Farme, must make account, that the earnest desire and watchfull regard he hath to
vphold and maintaine his grounds in good plight, will not be accomplished or manifested
by deed of Indenture, or posting ouer of the charge to another, but rather it
standeth him vpon in his owne person to see such as are to labour therein, to be set to

And as for the rest of the Buildings, or the base Courts, it maketh no great matter vpon
what Coasts or Quarters you dispose them:The base Courts howbeit, if you so contriue them, as
that they may marke vpon the North, they cannot but be to good purpose. These
instructions for Lights and Windowes are not so strictly enioyned, as that the differing
qualities and conditions of Countries, where such building must be made, may
not moue you to dispose them otherwise: for seeing there are found in some Countries
such Winds as are almost ordinarie, and may be said to haue gotten (as it were)

such other, and therefore bring with them some noysome qualitie, or at least little
profitable; it must needs be permitted in such places to alter and change the former
directions. And to speake the truth, seeing that by the meanes of Windowes and
counter-Windowes you may cut off the entrance both of Sunne and whatsoeuer
Winds, it shall be left in your free choice to make such Lights as may seeme most
necessarie in your owne iudgements, being euermore directed against such annoyance
as the Ayre might bring from that place whatsoeuer from whence it

                      yet my meaning is, that your cost and course in building
should be according to the reuenues of the grounds, or value of the profits, and
that (as saith Cato) the dwelling House be not set after seeking of Grounds, nor
Grounds caused to goe seeke Houses and Roomes: for great Plots of Building, and
Inclosures of Pleasure, cost much to build and maintaine: and Buildings which are
lesse than were requisite for the profits of the grounds, are a great cause of much losse
in the Fruits of the same.
               
               
                  CHAP. VI.
                  The dutie of a Father of a Familie, or Householder.
                  
                     AFter I haue thus disposed of Roomes and Building,
                        
                           〈…〉
                        
                      I wish and desire, that
the Lord of the Farme may be a man of great knowledge, well acquainted
and giuen to matters of Husbandrie: for who so is ignorant of them, hauing
had but small practise in them, as also he which doth take his chiefest
delight in other things, and spendeth his time otherwise, must of necessitie commit
himselfe to the mercie and discretion of a Farmer, which will mocke him to his face,
and will impaire his grounds and house also, heaping thereto a world of quarrels and
suits, which he will raise: or else he must trust to some other accomplisher of the businesse,
either in gouerning or waiting &amp; attending: and he asking counsell of other the

                        •
                     armers thereabout, they wil make him beleeue things to be not so good by the halfe

                        •
                     s they are. And indeed we read for a certainetie in the Roman Histories, That the
Earth was neuer so fruitful as then when it was allured &amp; woon by the industrie of the
famous Roman citizens, &amp; deliuered out of the tyrannous handling of gros
                        •
                     e-headed
peasants, whom we see before our eyes, notwithstanding that they are altogether ignorant,
to grow rich at our costs &amp; charges, &amp; to the great spoile of the ground which
they husband &amp; till. There is nothing comparable to the ouer-looking eye of a prudent
&amp; discreet Lord, and one that is accustomed to Husbandry, and which looketh
after &amp; contenteth himselfe with such estate as may stand with his profit, and keepeth
to himselfe the principall charge, which is a watchfulnes &amp; earnest desire to preserue
his goods, and hath alwaies care of his companie, and farmeth not nor yet renteth ou
                        •
                     
any thing but that which he will haue nothing at all to do withall, except a little ouersight:
Neither yet would I haue him,What things are most fit to be farmed out. in so doing, that he should passe any bargaine
by the way of Notaries, or by Writing: for by this meanes he robbeth himselfe of his
libertie. Let him learne well to know &amp; vnderstand the natures and choice of Men,
Cattell, &amp; Grounds, and let not that work possibly fall out, which he himselfe knoweth
not to doe, if he should stand in need, or else to giue directions in and to command
vnto others; at the least let him vnderstand the times &amp; seasons when, as also the manners
how, things were accustomed to be done: for as a man which seeth not any place
whereby he may giue light to another, can neuer lighten him so well; euen so that
Lord of a Farme, which vnderstandeth nor, neither knoweth the seasons and proper
times for to do any thing belonging to his gouernment &amp; iurisdiction, neither yet the
ordering of things, to execute euery thing accordingly, shall neuer know so well what
to command, and doth nothing to the workman but t
                        •
                     ouble and grieue him: and it is
the manner of men to mocke at such as command &amp; will things to be done which are
nothing to the purpose, but must afterward be vndone again, or els abide without any
profit. This is it which the great Husbandman Cat
                           •
                        
                      hath written, That the ground is
very ill entreated &amp; grieuously punished, whose Lord &amp; owner knoweth not to teach
&amp; cōmand that which is to be done: but must depend &amp; relie wholly vpō his Farmer.
Therefore it is most necessarie, that the father of the Familie, or owner of the Farme,
be most expert in euerie worke due for euerie Season of the yeare, as thus: first, for
such Earths as are applyed onely to Tillage, he shall know, that if the Soyle wherein

he liueth be a stiffe, strong, heauie, and tough Clay, he shall then, from Plow-day,
which is euer the Munday after Twelfth-day, till S. Valentines day, breake vp

                     ait,
which is, till it haue receiued Frost and Raine, that thereby the Mould may breake▪
but if his Earth be a mixt Earth, and of a more light nature, then from Plow-day to
S. Valentines, he shall breake vp or 
                        •
                     allow that Earth which he intends to keepe

Pease, Fetches, or other Pulse whatsoeuer: prouided alwaies, that he sow his Beanes
first, he Pease next, and his smaller Pulse last of all: He shall from S. Chaddes day till

season sow his Wheat, Rye, or Mas

to drayne the water from his arable land, because the drier that it lyes, the better
it is, and euermore the more fruitfull, as the experience of Husbandmen find by a
continuall practise. And as hee thus knoweth how to dispose and order his arable
ground, so hee shall also know how to husband his Pasture or Medow ground: as
namely, in the months of Ianuarie and Februarie he shall first plash and cut his Hedges

your ground be not verie fruitfull, but of an indifferent temperature, you shall lay all
those grounds of which you intend to haue Hay: but if they be fertile, and beare
much burthen, then if you lay them at May day, it will be fully early ynough. At
Midsummer you may mow your fruitfull low grounds, and at the translation of
S. Thomas you may mow those which lye higher and are lesse fertile: obseruing this,

                  As concerning the Sunne (which is the other Instrument of the whole World,
performing the greatest part of his actions really and in deed during the day, whereof
it is the author, as the Moone doth hers during the night, as being then when she
is in her force and vigour) it by his naturall heat, influence, actions, and casting forth
of his coelestiall beames, giueth vnto earthly bodies their forme and vegetatiue life,
accompanied with certaine powers and vertues, so farre forth as euerie naturall bodie
is capable, and deserueth or requireth it: Which operations of the Sunne in
these Earthly matters, are wrought and effected by certaine his motions, accomplished
in the foure quarters of the yeare, which is that time wherein the Sunne dispatcheth
his whole course. Wherefore the wise and prudent Husbandman shall giue
heed to the foure quarters of the yeare, which are the Spring, Summer, Autumne,
and Winter, to the end, that according to the motion and power of the Sunne in
these foure quarters, hee handle, manage, and gouerne all his affaires of Husbandrie.
And this is the thing that wee will more particularly handle at large in the
Chapter following, by the workes that the Husbandman must doe in euerie seuerall
moneth of the yeare.

some one or other worke, he shall dispose of his workes so, as that they
may euerie one haue his certaine time, and he shall know at his fingers
ends what things is to be done euerie moneth and time of the yeare. Yet thus euer

Kingdome of France than to any of her neighbours, they shall, for their satisfaction,
because the Booke is now intended generall, returne to the sixt Chapter, and there

                  The condition and state of a Huswife.
                  
                     I Doe not find the state or place of a Huswife or Dairie-woman to be of
lesse care and diligence than the office of her Husband, vnderstood alwayes,
that the woman is acquited of Field matters, in as much as shee is
tyed to matters within the House and base Court (the Horses excepted)
as the husband is tyed to doe what concerneth him, euen all the businesses of the
Field. Likewise, according to our custome of France, Countrie women looke vnto
the things necessarie and requisite about Kine, Calues, Hogges, Pigges, Pigeons,
Geese, Duckes, Peacockes, Hennes, Fesants, and other sorts of Beasts, as well for the
feeding of them as for the milking of them: making of Butter and Cheese: and the
keeping of Lard to dresse the labouring men their victuals withall. Yea, furthermore
they haue the charge of the Ouen and Cellar: and we leaue the handling of Hempe
vnto them likewise; as also the care of making Webs, of looking to the clipping of
Sheepe, of keeping their Fleeces, of spinning and combing of Wooll to make Cloth
to cloath the familie, of ordering of the Kitchin Garden, and keeping of the Fruits,
Hearbes, Rootes, and Seeds: and moreouer, of watching and attending the Bees. It
is true, that the buying and selling of Cattell belongeth vnto the man, as also the disposing
and laying out of money, together with the hyring and paying of seruants
wages: But the surplusage to be employed and layed out in pettie matters, as in Linnens,
Clothes for the household, and all necessaries of household furniture, that of a
certainetie belongeth vnto the woman. I meane also that she must be such a one as is
obedient vnto God and to her husband, giuen to store vp, to lay vp and keepe things
sure vnder locke and key, painefull, peaceable, not louing to stirre from home, mild
vnto such as are vnder her when there is need, and sharpe and seuere when occasion
requireth: not contentious, full of words, toyish, tatling; nor drowsie-headed. Let
her dispose of her stuffe and implements vnder her hand in such sort, as that euerie
thing may haue his certaine place, and that in good order, to the end that when they
be to be vsed, they may be found and easily come by and deliuered. Let her alwayes
haue her eye vpon her maids: and let her be alwayes first at worke, and last from it,
the first vp, and the last in bed. Let her not suffer to be lost or purloy
                        •
                     ed, no not the
least trifle that is. Let her not grumble at any time for any seruice done to the Lord
of the Farme: for the value of the least crum of Bread denyed, or vnwillingly graunted
or giuen vnto him or his, may loose the quantitie of a whole Loafe afterward. Let
her not trouble her braine with the reports &amp; speeches of others, but let her acquaint
her husband with them in good sort and manne
                        •
                     . Let her gratifie her neighbors willingly,
neuer attempting to inueagle or draw away any of their men seruants or maids
from them: neither let her keepe companie with them, except when shee may doe
them good, or helpe them, or when she maketh some marriage, or assemblies of great
companie. Let her not suffer her daughters to gad and wander abroad vpon the Sabbath,
except they be in such companie as is faithfull, or that she her selfe be present
with them. Let her compell her sonnes to be formost at worke, and let her shew them
the example of their father, that this may be as a double spurre vnto the men seruants.
Let her not endure them to vtter or speake any vnchast word, oath, or blasphemie in
her house: and let her cause Tale-bearers to be silent, and not to trouble themselues
with other folkes matters. Let her keepe close vp her Stubble and lopping of Trees
for fuell for the Ouen. Let her not suffer the stalkes of her Beanes, Peason, Fetches,
Thistles, Danewort, the refuse of pressed things, and other vnprofitable hearbes, to
be lost, for in winter they being burnt into ashes, will affoord prouision to lay Bucks
withall, or else be sold by little and little vnto the Towne. Let her giue good account
vnto the Mistresse or Lord of the Egges and young ones, as well of Birds as of other
Beasts. Let her be skilfull in naturall Physicke, for the benefite of her owne folke

and others when they shall fall out to be ill: and so in like manner in things good for
Kine, Swine, and Fowles: for to haue a Physition alwayes, when there is not verie
vrgent occasion and great necessitie, is not for the profit of the house. Let her keepe
all them of her house in friendly good will one toward another, not suffering them to
beare malice one against another.To

                        se Bread temperately. Let her gouerne her Bread so well, as that no one
be suffered to vse it otherwise than in temperate sort: and in the time of Dearth, let
her cause to be ground amongst her Corne, Beanes, Pease, Fetches, or Sarrasins Corne,
in some small quantitie; for this mingling of these flowers raiseth the paste, maketh
the Bread light, and to be of a greater bulke.Prouision for Drinke. At the same time she shall reserue the
drosse of the Grapes shee presseth, affoording them some little corner, for the imploying

that so the Wine may serue for her husband and extraordinarie commers. But the
naturall remedies which shee shall acquaint her selfe withall for the succour of her
folke in their sicknesses, may be those, or such as those are, which I shall set downe
by writing, in manner of a Countrie Dispensatorie, leauing the other more exquisite
Remedies to bee vsed by the professed Physitions of the great Townes

Regina prati, after that shee hath caused the same to be steept in white
Wine: or else shee shall cause to lye to steepe in the iuice of Citrons a
peece of Gold, or the powder or leaues thereof, for the space of 24
houres, and afterward mixe that iuice with white Wine, and the powder or decoction
of the root of Angelica, and so giue it to drinke to the infected. Or else let her
take two old Walnuts, one Figge, tenne leaues of Rue, one graine of Salt, powne and
temper them altogether, and rost them vnder the ashes, and afterward being sprinkled
with Wine, let her giue them to be eaten. Or else let her take one head of Garlicke,
twentie leaues of Rue, as many of Clarey, and powne them altogether with
white Wine and a little Aqua vitae, afterward let her straine them out, and giue the
partie to drinke thereof a good draught. The water of NapheNaphe. drunke to the quantitie
of six ounces, causeth the malignitie of the Plague to breake forth by Sweats: the
iuice of Marigolds, Scabious, and of the flowers of Betonie doe the like. Apply vpon

stopped, must be rosted vnder the ashes till it be rotten; after that powne it well in a
Mortar, and apply it: or else, if it be strained, the iuice drunke, and the drossie part
applyed to the place, you shall perceiue the like effect.

vpon either wrest of both the armes, the iuice of the stinging Nettle, mixed with

from the Hub of the Chimney, and well beaten togeth

and apply it fast bound vpon the wrest of the right arme: or else shee shall
take the heart of a water-Frog, and apply it vpon the heart or backe bone of the sicke
partie: or else she shall apply vpon the region of the Liuer, or vnto the soles of the
seet, quicke Tenches. Many for this cause doe stampe the small Sorrell, and make a

drinke for the great heat thereof, as also make a Cataplasme thereof to apply to the
wrests of the sicke partie. Others doe the like with the water which they straine out
of a great Citrull. Others cause to steepe in water the whole seed of Flea-wort for the
space of a night, and minister of this water, with a little Sugar, to the sicke partie to
drinke.

white Mulleine, before it put forth his stalke, pressed or drawne forth with
white Wine, and drunke a small space before the fit: The like effect hath the iuice
of Folefoot; the decoction of the leaues and rootes of Veruaine boyled in white

root of Asarum (otherwise called Cabaret) dryed in the Sunne, or in the Ouen, and
taken in the weight of a French crowne, with white Wine, halfe a quarter of an houre
before the fit. Furthermore, the Liniment made with Mithridate, or the oyle of Scorpions,

rite against such manner of agues: that is to say, they eat nine dayes together, being
fasting, the leaues of Sage; the first day nine, the second eight, and so consequently,
they diminish euerie day a leafe vntill the last of the said nine dayes: and the confident
persuasion that they haue of this medicine doth cure them. Some find it verie
singular in a Quartane Ague, after purging, to drinke white wine, wherein there hath
beene Sage steeped all night: if you eat before the fit a head of Garlicke pilled, you
shall scape the fit of shiuering cold: if you drinke one or two ounces of the iuices of
the root of Elder stamped and strained some small time before the fit, and take the
same againe two or three times, you shall lose your ague. The distilled water of the

day six leaues of Cinquefoile, that is to say, three in the morning, and three at the
euening▪ or the iuice of Smallage, of Sage, and good strong Vineger, of euerie
one an ounce, three houres before the fit. The most soueraigne remedie that some
men doe find for it, is to drinke fasting, fiue houres before the fit, two ounces

of the iuice of Pomegranats, and presently after to lay to the wrists, temples, and soles
of the feet small pills, of the bignesse of a Pease, made of an ounce of the oyntment

boyled with Goose grease, to rub the brow and temples of the sicke partie withall

singular remedie.

                  Against Vomiting,Vomiting. take a tost of bread and steepe it in the claret water hereafter
described, or in the iuice of Mints, spread it ouer with the powder of Masticke, apply
it warme vnto the stomacke, renewing it euerie three houres. Otherwise, take
two handfuls of Mints, and one of Roses, boyle them in Wine, take afterward two
ounces of tosted bread, and let it be well steeped in Wine, and afterward compounded
with Masticke and the said Mints and Roses, make thereof a playster to lay to
the stomacke before you goe to meat. It is true, that if the vomiting be with an ague,
it will be good to boyle the Mints and Roses, and to steepe the tosted bread in vineger.
In like manner, Mints brayed and mingled with oyle of Roses, applyed vnto
the stomacke, is a singular helpe for any kind of vomiting: it is good likewise at the
end of meat to swallow downe one gulpe of Water, or a morsell of Marmalade of
Quinces, not drinking afterward: and in the morning, two houres before meat, to
swallow fiue or six Pepper-cornes whole with Wine, or the sirrup of Mints, or of
Wormewood, or greene Ginger preserued: It is also good to set cupping Glasses
vpon the bottome of the Stomacke, or vnder the Nauell, and then chiefely
when the partie eateth: to take rest after meat, and to talke or cough any thing
at all.

take the crums of a good thicke Loafe, and being dipt as it commeth hot out of the
Ouen in the Oyle of Camomill, and wrapt in a Linnen cloth, let it be applyed vnto

French crowne, well mingled with white wine, for the space of nine dayes: or else of
the decoction of the leaues and roots of Strawberries: or else take Missletoe of the
white Thorne, gathered before the Sunne rise, about a handfull, three or foure roots
of Parsley, bray them all together with white wine, let them runne through a linnen
cloth or strainer, and drinke of this euening and morning a reasonable draught: This
is a more excellent remedie than many others; which notwithstanding women with
child must not vse, but in place of it you must apply to the wrists and soles of their
feet the leaues of Missletoe of the Oake, of great Celandine, and Horehound, the
whole being brayed with a little wine, and made in forme of a Cataplasme. Some
commend highly against the Iaundise, to take of the wormes of the earth, to wash
them in white wine, and after to drie them, and making a powder of them, to giue
thereof a small spoonefull in white Wine, or the decoction of Wormewood, or of
Horehound: or to drinke fasting ones owne vrine certaine dayes: or to drinke for

that to carrie in the left hand three leaues of wild Rocket, doth cure the Iaundise.
Some also hold, that to weare vnder the soles of the feet the leaues of Shepheards
purse, or of great Celandine, next vnto their bare feet, doth the like.
                  For the Dropsie,Dropsie. it is good to make a drinke with the seed of Broome, pouned and
brayed in white wine: or to make a drinke of the iuice of the root of Gladiolus or Asarum
with white wine: or to drinke fasting his owne vrine for the space of certaine
dayes: to apply in like manner vnto the moist places a Cataplasme of Cowes dung
warme; with which, as Galen testifieth, a Physition of Misia did maruellously heale
all manner of Dropsies: or to apply vpon the swolne place shell-Snayles aliue, not
washed, but carefully bruised. A secret remedie against the Dropsie, is to drinke with
honied water the powder of Glasse seuen times burned and seuen times quenched in
the iuice of Flower-de-luce, or white wine.
                  For the paine or heauinesse of the Spleene,Paine of the Spleene. drinke wine wherein hath boyled Scolopendrium,

infant newly borne, and that the Ring do touch the flesh. There is also nothing more
singular, than to drinke, in a pretie draught of white wine, the red pill which is to be
found in the space and cartilaginous gristles of Walnut kernels, dried in the moneth
of August, and made into powder: or to drinke foure or fiue ounces of the oyle of

downe while it is fresh and new: or the said heart of a Larke fastened to the
thigh. As concerning outward remedies, some approue greatly to take the skin of a
sheepe all new, or the kell of the intrailes of a sheepe newly killed, &amp; to apply it vnto
the bellie: or to make a bag of Millet, Branne, Wheat, and Salt fried together, to lap

vpon the bellie: A Cataplasme made of Wolues dung is also profitable against the
Collicke: the same dung drunke with a little wine doth verie much good: the bones
found in the dung of a Wolfe, powned small, and drunke with wine, haue the like
qualitie. Some say, that if you take ashes comming verie hot from vnder the coales
of fire, and put the said ashes in a dish or pot, and afterward poure thereon a good

                  For a greene wound,A greene wound. you must take Garden Baulme, the great and small Comfrey,
and a little salt, poune them all together, and apply them vpon the wound. It
is good also to drop into the wound the iuice of Nicotian, or for the more profitable
vse thereof to apply both the drosse, as also the iuice thereof stamped, and to bind
vp the wound by and by, and assure your selfe, that within three dayes it will be recouered.
Otherwise, take the Elme apples, the flowers of S. Iohns wort, and of
Rosemarie, the knops or buttons of Roses, put all together in a glasse-bottle full of
oyle Oliue, stop the bottle diligently, and set it to the Sunne so long as till all be so
farre consumed as that it may seeme to be rotten; afterward let it runne through a
linnen cloth diuers times, and then keepe it in a violl to drop into wounds. The readiest
and most soueraigne remedie is the iuice of Nicotiana, and the drosse or substance
likewise, and also the oyntment made thereof, which wee will handle hereafter,
viz. in the seuentie six chapter of the second Booke. This oyntment is very singular:

mortar; being stamped, put them in an earthen vessell well glased, with seuen pints
of white wine, to boyle till halfe of it be consumed, the vessell in the meane time being
close couered, and the fire burning cleare and softly: after draw the vessell somewhat
further from the fire, and let it coole vnto the next morning, then straine it out
a little, warme the grosser parts, that it may so be forced through some hairie strainer,
and adde thereto of white Pitch melted by it selfe, and also strained through a
hairie strainer, a pound, halfe a pound of white Waxe in graines, Masticke and Turpentine
of each one ounce, make thereof an oyntment of good consistence. Likewise
there is nothing more singular than to take of Greeke Pitch, Brimstone, and Olibanum
equall parts, to bray them together with the whites of egges, and after you
haue stanched and wiped away the bloud in handsome sort, to ioyne and bring together
the edges of the wound, and to apply it thereto with a linnen cloth and a Cataplasme,
afterward to bind and roll it vp with double linnen clothes, and so to
leaue it for certaine dayes: or else boyle the leaues of Carduus Benedictus and flower
of Wheat in Wine vnto the forme of an Oyntment, wash the Vlcers twice a day
with Wine, afterward lay thereunto this Oyntment: Or else wash the wound

with the decoction of Dent de lion: more easily thus; Take the dyrt which you find
vnder Buckets, Troughes, or such like, and apply it vnto the cut, it closeth it vp incontinently.
                  For all wounds,Old or new wounds. as well old as new, vlcers, and whatsoeuer cuts in the flesh, take the
leaues of Plantaine, Spearewort, or small Plantaine, Mallowes, All-good, of each a

greene Waxe, and Perrosine, of each as much as two Nuts, melt them, that so they
may all be brought vnto the forme of an oyntment, of which you shall make vse for
all sorts of wounds. Otherwise, take Brimstone most

then couer it by foure or fiue singers, set it out vnto all the heat of the Sunne you can
for the space of tenne daies, and stirring it about manie times with a Spatull of cleane
and faire wood, and keeping the said vessell close shut continually, to the end there
may not any dyrt fall thereinto. At the end of the tenne dayes emptie out all the
oyle, by leaning the glasse softly to the one side (seeing it hath extracted all the substance
or essence of the Brimstone) into another Glasse-bottell by the helpe of a
funnell, and let not any of the drosse or residence goe in withall: after which, you
shall stop the bottell verie carefully, and at such times as you would vse it, you shall
dip Lint, white linnen Cloth, Cotton, or blacke Wooll in it, and apply it vnto
the parts that are hurt, whether by Vlcers or Cuts, as also vnto Impostumes, and
that so long, as vntill they be cured: You may powre in oyle againe the second time
vpon the residence (left after the oyle powred out, as beforesaid) and doe as was done
before. Make account of these two later Remedies as of those which will not
faile you.

Or else take a Toad, drie her either in the Sunne or in the Ouen, make her into powder,

                  For vlcers comming of the Pocks,Vlcers of the Pocks. and such other maligne ones, take tenne pints of
water, quench therein hot yrons so long as till the tenne pints become but fiue, and in
these fiue pints infuse for the space of foure and twentie houres a pound of vnquencht
Lime, after that straine the water, when it is strained, dissolue therein fifteene graines
of Verdegrease, and as much of Vitrioll, and twentie graines of Camphire: this water
is singular to mundifie, cleanse, and drie vp Vlcers. Otherwise, set to boyle in a
new earthen vessell verie cleare water, when it beginneth to boyle, put into it by and
by vnsleckt Lime, and presently thereupon powre it out into another vessell all new,
let it rest there so long, as vntill (after it be scummed) it become cleare, the Lime falling
to the bottome of the vessell in manner of pap; in the end you shall gather the
water swimming aloft, by leaning the vessell and letting the Lime abide vnstirred in
the bottome: and this water thus gathered shall be reserued in a cleane violl or other
vessell well stopped, that so it may serue for your vse; in which, being warme, dip
a linnen cloth, and apply it in stead of an emplaister vnto the Vlcer, and renew
it oft.

these iuices displease thee, in stead of braying, bruising, or stamping of the things aforesaid,
you may make a decoction in common water, adding in the end of the decoction,
white Wine, honey of Roses, and syrrup of drie Roses. In the meane time
the wound must be cleansed with white Wine warme, and there must be layed vpon
it a leafe of red Coleworts warmed at the fire, and reasonably greene: and there must
care be had to keepe the wound from salt and thicke meat, from strong wine, great
paine, and vse of women.

following: Take Virgins honey one pound, Rubarbe, or Sene, or Agarick, euen
of any one of them, or all three made into powder, foure ounces, mixe this powder
with the honey, and let it stand in the shadow sixtie daies in a potwell couered▪ stirre

will keepe all the force of the medicine, and will cast vp in a scumme the substance
thereof, in such sort, as that still it will abide without mixture. To make this composition
the more pleasant, you may mixe therewithall some one or other drug that is
pleasant and of a good rellish. If you further desire to be instructed in diuers other

Milke, shee must not make any account of that which commeth from the Cow after

in Summer, especially in Autumne and the Spring, in which seasons, Milke, because
of the heat and temperature of the time, would be spoyled and presently turned: but
as soone as she can, she shal gather her Creame, greene Cheese, Butter, pressed Cheese,
Whay, and other commodities, which a good huswife is wont to rayse according to
the time: although in Winter the Kine yeelding small store of Milke, as being then
with Calfe, she may gather three or foure meales together, which will not so soone be

turne all her Milke into Cheese. It is true, that seeing Cheese is not of so great price
in Winter, neither yet so good and daintie as in Summer, Spring time, and Autumne,
by reason of the grasse, that therefore it shall be no great danger to gather the Butter
cleaner from the Cheese in Winter than at any other time.

of milke to make two pounds and a halfe of Butter. To make this Butter, shee shall
beat or cherne it a great while in Vessels made for the purpose, especially whiles the
times of greatest heat endure, seeing such heat is the cause that Butter commeth not,
and is not made so soone as at other times. If she will make account to sell it, she shall
salt it, and put it in pots of earth, such as wee see brought to Paris from Britaine,
Normandie, and Fl

white colour is the worst: but that which is gathered in May, is better than either of
the other.
                  As concerning the making of Cheese,The making of Cheese. shee shall chuse the most grosse and fat
milke, being pure and newly drawne, to make Cheese that shall keepe a long time:
and of such milke she shall gather neither Butter nor Creame; but such as it commeth
from the Cow, such shall be put in Vessels for to coagulate and turne to curds. The
way to curdle it,To curd the milke. is to mingle therewith of the Runnet, of a Lambe, Kid, or Hare, or
the flowers of wild Thistle, or the seed of blessed Thistle, or the iuice of the Fig-tree,
which commeth out of the Tree when one cutteth the greene barke thereof: or the
leaues and hoarinesse which groweth at the small end of the Artichokes, or Ginger,
or the inner skin of a house-Hennes stomack, or the spawne egges of a Pike, and with
these it is vsuall to make Cheese to be eaten in Lent: or the blacke mutable Thistle,
therefore called Chameleon niger. Let her beware of casting in any the least quantitie
of vineger, for one onely drop of vineger is sufficient to hinder the turning of the
milke into curds. But aboue all, the best and most principallest RunnetThe best runni

old, well washt, salted, cleansed, and seasoned with Cloues, Mace, and a little Nutmeg,
and so kept in a close pot with Bryne, and so vsed according as occasion serueth.
The pot in which the milke is, must not be without some quantitie of heat for to
keepe it warme; and yet notwithstanding it must not come neere vnto the fire, as it
may not stand farre off: And when it is curded and gathered together, it must be
put presently into slices, tormes, or fats, for it is profitable that the Whay should run
out, and separate it selfe from the Curd. But chiefely, and aboue all other things, it

Hennes are not so giuen to lay: wherefore Hennes of middle size are to be preferred

them sound also: if you giue vnto them young Nettles chopped and boyled with
Branne, they will lay great store of egges.
                  They leaue laying about the third of Nouember,To haue egges all Winter time. which is at such time as the cold
beginneth: but if vpon curiositie you would keepe by themselues some of the fairest
to lay egges all Winter long, you must feed them with tosted bread steept from
euening to morning, and giue them to their breakfast: and for their meat in the day
time and at night to cast them some little quantitie of Oates, Barley, or Wheas,
which doth warme them: or some Mustard seed, which aboue all other things causeth
Hennes to lay egges good store, that is to say, in the sharpe cold times of Winter;
which thing you shall proue verie true by experience, if you make triall of it:
or else to seed them with Earth-wormes, which will also cause them to lay egges in
great number. You must not let them sit presently after their first yeare of laying▪
and when they are past three yeares old, you must eat them. You must also dispatch
and make away with those that are barren and lay not at all: and as for those
that doe lay very much, you must change their Neasts often, and marke their egges,
to set them in time, if it be possible. When they are casting off their feathers, otherwise
called of the common people moulting, you must not suffer them to goe out
of the place whereinto you haue shut them, except it be to refresh them when
it is verie faire, and then to keepe them that the Eagle and Kite doe not fall vpon
them.
                  It is vsuall to set Hennes the second yeare of their laying,The time to set Hennes. and so the third and
fourth: and so let any set many Hennes at one time, and vnder their straw some pieces
of yron, for feare it shou'd thunder, or else some Bay leaues, or the heads of Garlicke,
or else some greene grasse, for some say that this is good against the Pip and the monstrous
fruit. They are put there in the growth of the Moone, after the twelfth day of
the new Moone vntill the foureteenth, saith Florentine; and Columella saith, from the
tenth vnto the fifteenth, to the end that the Hennes may hatch in the next new
Moone, for to that end they stand not in need of any moe daies than one and twentie.
And the Neasts of these Hennes must be made in the bottome of a Tunne or Pipe, to
the end that when they come off they cause not any thing to fall or roule. Some perfume
the straw that they are to sit vpon, before they lay the egges therein, with Brimstone,
to keepe the Henne for hatching before her time. And you shall set vnder her
the egges that you haue marked, and of those the fairest and newest, and if it be possible,
those of her owne: And looke that they haue beene layd since the seuenth of Februarie,
and before the two and twentieth of September: for such as are layd at any
other time, are nothing worth, no more than those which were first layd, or yet those
which were layd by the Henne without the help of the Cock: and there must alwaie

after Aprill one and twentie. The greatest part of the inhabitants of Lyons doe admit
of no other number than three and twentie. After the second of October they
set not any more, neyther indeed ought they, if it be not in Ouens, according to the
vse of the inhabitants of Maliha,Ouens to set egges in. and some of those of Beauceron: But Hennes are
too much punished and put to paine to breed and bring vp Chickens in Winter. As
also there is a common opinion receiued, That after mid-Iune Hennes are small

                     e so rightly; and well to the purpose.

of the Goose, Peacocke, or Indian Henne, or else of Ducks, then let them be put vnder

egges, you need not to set the Henne any sooner vpon them, then and if they were her
owne; for they require no more time to be hatcht in:To haue Henne-birds or Cock-birds. And if you would haue them
all Henne-birds, then set such egges as are more round and blunt, for the long and
sharpe-pointed ones are commonly Cock-birds.
                  Some are carefull not to put one after another into the Neast,A Ceremonie obserued in setting of egges. but set them in rowes
in a Woodden Platter, and thence let themslide downe into the Neast verie softly.
And care must be had, that neither Cockes, nor any other Hennes, may goe in to sit
vpon them: and to that end twice euery day to set meat and drinke so neere vnto the
Henne,The Hennes meat &amp; drinks must be set within the thing she siteth in. as that shee need not rise for to feed her selfe; for if but for her meat shee once
cast off her care of them, it will be much adoe to get her to returne vnto them againe,
if she be not a free and verie kind Henne. If the Henne haue small care to returne vnto
her egges, to sit vpon them equally, it will be good sometimes to turne them ouer
softly when she shall be from her Neast.
                  There are some women that cannot stay to the end of the Hatching:The impatiencie of women. but about the
fourth day after the setting of the Henne, they will be heauing euerie one of them vp
one after one to looke vpon in the cleere Sunne-shine, and if they see not bloudie
streames or threads within them, they cast them out, and put vnder others in their
places. And in like manner, at the one and twentith day, if they find that she stayeth
from hatching, they take off the Henne. But good sitting Hennes will not returne
any more to their Neasts, after that the egges haue been touched. Likewise the good
Huswife sayth, That as for the egges which are vnder the Henne, they ought not to
be touched till they be hatched. Likewise they must be well chosen and viewed in
the Sunne betwixt both her hands before that they be put vnder the Henne.To trie the egges that must be set. Such as
doe any thing doubt that the egges are not all good, and that the Chickens cannot
come forth by reason of the hardnesse of the shell, must not faile to bath them about
the eighteenth day in a hollow dish and warme water, and to take away such as swim
aboue the water, putting the rest vnder the Henne againe. But you must not force the
Henne to rise off the Neast in your thus doing.
                  You shall greatly pleasure the Henne, if when the Chickens begin to chirpe, and
there be found some which will not let the Chicken come forth, by reason of the
hardnesse of the shell, that then you helpe her to breake the same: howsoeuer indeed
this is the part of a good conditioned Henne, as also to flye at your face if you come
neere to her, after she hath once heard them cheape or chirpe vnder her.
                  The little Chickens,The Henne Pip. newly hatched, must be put vnder a Sieue, and lightly perfumed
with Rosemarie, for to keepe them from the Pip: and for the space of two
dayes you must not giue them any thing to eat, but put them vnder some Henne that
hath not manie, and which is not either of Partridge colour, or wild and vntamed,
that thereby they may be kept warme whiles the other are in hatching: or which is
better, to put them to follow some Capon so soone as they be hatched, rather than
any Henne; for by that meanes they will be better defended both from Cold and
rauenous Birds, as also better fed: besides that, hereby the Henne will be the fitter to
fall to laying of egges againe. It is true indeed, that there must choice be made of
a

                     ound and couragious Capon, to plucke away his feathers from vnder his belly,
and to nettle him with the strongest and most stinging Nettles that you can get,

and after to make him drunke with bread steeped in wine, and to put him vnder a
basket made of Osiers, with his brood of Chickens, and so leaue him these some time▪
to the end he may fall in loue with them. So soone as he shall be at libertie, hee will
beare them vp, keepe them, lead them, and become a more foolish, doting, or true
louer of them, than the Henne her selfe would haue beene: Howbeit, the naturall
dame is verie carefull, and giuen to keepe them vnder her wings verie wisely, without
doing them any manner of harme or hurt. When as therefore they be two day
                        ••

hatched at one time, giue and put the Chickens of the one vnto another of the eldest
and most vsed to lead, or else to a Capon, as hath beene said, and let the younger
Hennes returne againe to the Cocke: but see that you put not aboue fiue and twentie
or thirtie vnto any one Henne, because shee will not be able to couer or brood aboue
that number. Againe, there must good care be had, that the Henne which le

them be not curst and brutish, that so she may not hurt them as she is scratching,
or set them in a heat by flying; neither yet that she be giuen to much climbing, or gadding
into such places as her little ones cannot follow her into. Wherefore it shall be
good not to suffer them to goe so soone to the Court-yard, but rather, for the space
of fortie dayes, to keepe them that they goe not from the place where they were
hatched. You must likewise beware that the Snake doe not breath vpon or hisse at
them: for the smell of such breath is so pestilent vnto them, as that it generally killeth
them all. The remedie is, to burne oftentimes, neere vnto their Cowpe, Hart

                  It is a paine to goe about to hatch Chickens without the heat of the Henne:To hatch Chickens without the heat of the Henne. and
although the thing may be done, yet it is not so certaine nor so profitable. They are
set on a row, the sharpe pointed end vpward, in an Ouen verie meanely warme, and
vpon warme Hennes dung, which must be renewed euerie six dayes; and ouer and
vnder them thus set, some doe put bagges of Feathers, and they must be stirred now
and then: after the eighteenth day, they must be bathed in warme water; and th

one and twentieth, they must be holpen to breake the shell. Againe, it may be done
otherwise: The same day that you set a Henne (to the end that you may the better
remember, because it is not so easie to number the dayes as to tell the egges) you may
take as manie egges as you haue set, and put them vpon bagges full of Hennes dung
(well dryed, sifted, and compassed about with Downe, or such soft Feathers as are on
the inside of the thighes) and made after the manner of Neasts. And againe, others
doe make a bed of the said Downe vpon the bagges, and vpon this bed they rank
                        •
                     
their egges, as hath been said, and after couering them with other Downe and bagges
aboue, in such sort, as that the Downe and bagges lye close round about, and euerie
where touching the egges: which done, after three or foure dayes, they must be 
                        •
                     urned
once euerie day, and that so softly and nimbly, as that they may not hit one vpon
another: And at the twentieth day (being such time as the Hennes begin to
picke the egge-shells) you must helpe to make way for this your brood to come
forth, and after put them to some Henne that hath but a few. But there is nothing
beyond and besides naturall inclination and disposition to be attempted in any
thing.
                  The Henne will sit all Winter as well as in Summer, if shee haue meat made of
Branne, mixt with the leaues and seed of drie Nettles.
                  You must make choice of such egges as are of blacke Pullets,Y

                         know a good egge. as much as are more
holesome, daintie, full, and substantiall than those of other Hennes, by how much they

want of being so old: let it not be aboue two dayes old, let it be white and long, according
to the common verse,

                        The egge is good, and for delight,
                        Thats long and new, and white in sight.
                     
                  
                  To know if the egge be new, you must make such triall as we haue set downe to be
vsed, to proue and know such as are good to be set.
                  The huswife that maketh account to sell egges,How egges may be kept in Winter and Summer. must in Winter keepe them warme
vpon straw, and well couered; and in Summer coole in Bran, according to the aduise
of old Writers: but (be it spoken vnder correction) I am quite of a contrarie mind;
for the Straw is coole, and the Bran hot: Adde further, that egges kept in Bran in
Summer doe corrupt the sooner. They which doe couer and powder them with salt,
or lay them in brine, doe impaire them, and leaue them not whole and full, which
will be a hinderance in the sale of them: and there is no doubt but that the egge doth
take some bad rellish also by that meanes. The Cellar is a good place to keepe them
in both Winter and Summer.
                  I doe not intend here to make any discourse, which of the two was first made, the
Egge or the Henne: Looke for the deciding of this curious question in the end of
Macrobius, and in Plutarch his Opuscula: And you shall learne a great deale better
of Aristotle and Plinie, than of Hippocrates, how the Chicken is made within the
egge of the white, and nourished by the yolke, seeing that the yolke is of more easie
digestion than the white.
                  As concerning the cutting of Cock-Chickens,To g

                        ld Cockreld. it must be done shortly after that
their dam hath forsaken them, and that they run not chirping after her, but begin to
crow and to fall in loue with Pullets; for if they scape the first yeare and halfe, then
there is no order to be taken with them: and you must take the best bodied, and those
which are best thriuen and set with feathers, and yet not growne to that full perfection
and naturall growth of feathers which Cocks are garnished withall: for after you
haue made choice of such as shall serue for the benefit and leading of your Hennes, to
keepe them, as those which are the best made, and most bold, you must cut the other,
for to feed and fat either in the Cowpe or in the Chaffe-house.
                  Some men (as for example at Mans and in Bretaigne) doe put out their eyes,To fat Capons. as
they doe vnto Gossings, and giue meat of corne halfe boyled,capons of Means and Bretaigne. and of paste well
crusht and braked, and made into gobbets, and thus they become fat within fortie
dayes at the most: but they must be well looked to, and haue all their feathers pulled
from about their heads, to the end to keepe them from vermine.
                  As concerning other particulars, of the Henne, of the Egge and of the Medicines
which the Husbandman may draw from them for the good of his health:
                  The Henne will hatch Chickens of diuers colours,Chickens of diuers colours. if 
                        •
                     hee sit vpon egges drawne
with variable and diuers or painted colours: as also shee will hatch Pullets of verie
pleasant colour to behold, if you make her tread by male Pigeons, or Partridges, or
Feasants. To be briefe, you shall haue Pullets, Pigeons, Feasants, and such other
kinds of Fowles of diuers colours, if you prouide aboue, beneath, and on euerie side
of their Cowpes, or other place where they make their abode, places of receit and couertures,
of such colour as you shall wish them to be of.
                  Hennes will lay great egges,Great egges. if you pound Bricks, and mixe them with Bran and
wine, bray them all very well, and giue them to the Hennes to eat: or else make a fine
pouder of Brick, mix it with Barly Bran, &amp; giue it them to eat. Some for the very same
purpose do mollifie the Fullers earth that is red, and mix it among the Hennes meat.
                  If by the space of foure dayes,To make egges soft. or seuen at the most, you steepe an egge in verie
strong vineger, you shall so soften the shell, as that the egge may easily be so handled
as that you may draw it through any sort of ring that you shall weare vpon your singer,
and thrust it into such a Violl as you your selfe would wish to haue it put in:
likewise you shall bring it to his former shape, if you steepe it in coole water. In like
manner, an egge steept in Aqua vitae for some space of time, doth quite wast and
spend it selfe.
                  
                     
If you would keepe egges long,How to keepe egges. that they should not breake, set them so orderly
in baskets, as that they may stand right vp, and that the end which is sharpe-pointed
may be vpward, and by this meanes a man may carrie such a burthen of them as shall
be layd vpon him, without breaking any of them. Likewise this is a thing verie true
and well approued, that an egge hath so firme and strong a frame, as that no man, be
he neuer so strong, is able to breake it betwixt the palmes of his hands, being taken
and holden long-waies.
                  It hath beene obserued of a long time,What egges will keepe best. that the egges layd after the new of the
Moone in the moneth of August, or in the wane of the Moone in the moneth of
Nouember, as those likewise which are layd on the day of the Natiuitie, or on the
day of the Ascension, are lasting and durable, and not easily corrupted. Whereof
there cannot be deuised any other reason, than that in some of them the shell is made
hard, and not to be pierced through of the ayre by the coldnesse of the time: and in
the other there is a most quick exhaling and expending of that which might be corrupted
within the egge, by the heat of the tune and season then being.
                  Some find within the stomacke of a Capon a stone,The stone in a Capons stomack. of the bignesse of a Beane,
which maketh a man strong and lustie vnto the act of carnall copulation; and withall,
maketh him louing, fauorable, and gracious amongst women.
                  Some hold it for an vndoubted truth,To rost an egge without any fire. that for want of fire an egge may be rosted,
being turned and whirled about a long time in a sling.
                  An egge will take any forme of character that you will,An egge written vpon. on the inside thereof, if
you write vpon the shell with inke made of Galls, Allome, and Vineger, and after
that such writing is dried in the Sunne, put the egge in brine that is verie strong, and
after boyle it and take away the shell, and there you shall find the writing.
                  The shell of the egge emptied all out,An egge lifted vp into the aire. and filled with May dew, and layd forth afterward
in the Sunne-thine at noone day, is easily lifted vp into the ayre without the
aid or assistance of any other thing.
                  An egge armed with thread, and put into the middest of a hot burning fire, keepeth
the thread from burning at all.
                  A Henne slit in two,The applying of a Henne to draw forth venome. and applyed all hot vnto the bitings of venimous beasts,
draweth out the venime thereof: or otherwise, if you take and plucke the fundament
of any liuing fowle verie bare, and apply it to the parts offended by the stinging of a
Snake, or to the Carbuncles and Buboes rising of the infection, doth the like. And
this sheweth, that a Henne hath a naturall contrarietie against poyson. And this
may further be knowne, because that Hennes doe eat venimous things, as Toades,
Vipers, Snakes, Aspes, and other Serpents, without their taking of any harme thereby.
                  The inward membrane of the Hennes stomacke or maw,The innermost skin of the Hens stomack, against the flux of the be

                        y &amp; grauell. as also of a Capons, dried
and powdred, is a soueraigne thing against the flux of the belly, grauell in the reines,
and difficultie to make water.
                  The broth which is made of a Henne, or old Cocke, is good to loosen the bellie:
and yet more effectually, if one stuffe a Henne with Mercurie, Germander, wild
Saffron,The broth of a Henne good to loosen the belly. and such other hearbes. Also the broth of a Henne or Cocke is singular against
euerie disease, if she be stuffed with hearbes appropriate and fit for the cure of
the said diseases.
                  The stones of a Capon,The stones of a Capon. nourished and fed with meat steeped in milke, are soueraigne
for the speedie restoring of them which are worne away and consumed by
continuance of long sicknesse.
                  The fat of a Henne washed in Rose water,The fat of a Henne. is good for the chops and clifts in the
lips, as also for those which happen in the hands by reason of Winter cold.
                  The gall of a Henne or Capon dropt into the eye,The gall of a Henne. doth take away the spots of the
eyes, if you mixe it with the water of Eye-bright.
                  The dung of a Henne dried and finely powdred,Henne-dung. and applyed to the eyes which
haue lost their haire, causeth the same to come againe, if you mixe it with honey, or
oyle of Linseed: If it be tempered with oyle of Roses, and applyed, it is good

against burnings: being brayed with vinegar and honey, it cureth within an houre
such as are neere strangled by eating of Mushromes, for it maketh them to vomite a
thicke and flegmatike humor. A Physition in Galens time did cure all manner of old
Collickes, giuing the sicke to drinke of this dung with Hypocras made of honey
and wine.
                  A hard rosted egge eaten with vineger stayeth the flux of the belly,A hard rosted egge. if you mixe
with it the powder of Harts horne.
                  A Cataplasme made of the yolke and white of an egge well beaten with the iuice
or water of Plantaine and Nightshade,The yolke and white of an egge. applyed vnto burnings, doth quench and extinguish
them.
                  The white of an egge beaten,The white of an egge. and with the powder of Frankincense, Mastick, and
Galls applyed vnto the browes, doth stay the bleeding at the nose.
                  The yolke of an egge swallowed alone,The yolke of an egge. stayeth the Cough, and such other distillations
as fall downe vpon the lungs and other parts of the breast. The yolke of an
egge, which is layd in the full of the Moone, doth cleanse and take away all manner
of spots appearing in the face. The thin membrane or skin which is on the inside of
the egge-shell dried, finely poudred and mixt with the white of the egge, doth heale
the clifts of the lips. The egge-shell made into ashes, and drunke with wine, doth
stay the spetting of bloud, and is good to whiten and cleanse the teeth, to comfort
and incarnate the gummes. The egge-shels, out of which there haue come Chickens,
being poudred and mixed with white wine, doe breake as well the stone of the reines
as of the bladder. The white of the egge mixed with vnquencht Lime, the shell of
an egge burnt to ashes, old Tyle well poudred, and Bitumen, maketh a Cement verie
excellent to glue and ioyne together againe the broken parts and pieces of Glasses.
An egge spread vpon wood, or any kind of garment, doth keepe the same from the
burning of the fire.

and easements of water, especially running streames, is not so fit to
breed and nourish Geese: except for priuate commodities sake it fall
out, that the Farmer doe make him some Fish-ponds or standing Lakes
of his owne,Geese loue to bath and tumble themselues in the water. and at his owne proper costs and charges: For the Goose, as well as the
Ducke, doth loue to swim, and to coole, plunge, and tumble her selfe euerie day; neither
doe they tread almost any where else but in the water. There is great profit, and
there is great losse also thereof: profit, because the charge of keeping or feeding them
is not so costly,The Goose is a bird of great profit and disprofit. as their watch and ward is good and gainefull; being indeed better
than that of the dogge, as hath beene shewed long agoe by the Geese of the Capitoll
in Rome, who awaking the souldiors and standing Watch, were the cause that the
enemie was repulsed and driuen backe: Againe, she declareth when Winter draweth
nigh, by her continuall squeaking and crying: shee layeth egges, hatcheth Goslings,
affoordeth feathers twice a yeare, for the Bed, for Writing, and for Shafts,
which are gathered at the Spring and Autumne. The losse or discommoditie is, because
they craue a keeper; for otherwise they will bruse and knap off the young
siences of Trees, the hearbes of the Garden, and the shoots of Vines, as also iniure
and hurt the Corne when it is shooting and putting forth his stalke, as well by breaking
it,Wild Geese. as by dunging vpon it: in such sort, as that in the Countries where wild Geese
(which are fowles keeping together in flocks as well as Cranes) doe make their greatest
and principall haunt, as in Holland, Heynault, Artoys, and other where, there is
found sometimes a great piece of Corne all wasted and destroyed in lesse than halfe a

day. And the house or tame Geese doe no lesse harme, if they be let alone and suffered
to do it; for they pull vp the corne by the root: besides that, where as they dung,
there will nothing grow for a long time after.
                  The best Goose and Gander is of colour either white or gray; and she that is of a
mixt or two colours, is also of an indifferent goodnesse: notwithstanding the white
doth abound more in laying of egges than the others, and hath also a better flesh;
and it is good to make choice of such a one as hath the knee, ioints, and space betweene
the legges great and large. The Goose goeth ouer her laying time thrice a
yeare, if she be kept from sitting and hatching: but indeed it is a great deale better
when she is set vpon egges, because the young ones thereby brought forth doe nourish
better than the egges, as also doe encrease the flocke: And at euerie laying time,
some lay twelue egges and moe sometimes, others but fiue at the first, foure at the second,
and three at the last; and these three seuerall times come betwixt the first of
March and the last of Iune.The memorie of a Goose. And they do neuer forget the place which you shall haue
brought them to at the first to lay in: so that looke where they lay their first egges,
they will lay all the rest; and in the same place also set them, if you will. Likewise
you must not let them lay out of their walke or fold, and for that cause you must
keepe them shut in at such time as when you thinke they will begin to lay: and if you
take not vp their egges, they will begin to sit so soone as they haue their full number:
but and if you take them away as they be layd, they will not cease laying till they
come to an hundred, yea two hundred egges; yea, so long, and so many, as some say,
as vntill their fundament stand gaping and open, they not being able to shut it, because
of the effect wrought by their much laying.
                  Geese loue not almost to sit any but their owne egges;To set Geese. and at the least you must se
                        •
                     
that the greater part that you set her on be her owne: And she is not commonly to be
set vpon fewer than seuen or nine at the least, nor vpon moe than thirteene or fifteene
at the most, and you must looke she be set vpon an odde number. And who so putteth
vnder the straw whereupon she sitteth some Nettle roots, doth preuent that the
Goslings, when they be hatched, are not so soone hurt. Some Geese in a good and fauourable
weather do hatch in fiue and twentie dayes at the most. And neere vnto the
place where the sitteth you shall place steeped Barly in such quantitie, as that she may
take it out of much water: for shee loueth not to leaue her young ones, for sometimes
she will rather die for hunger; and to the end also that she may not stand in need to
stirre or rayse her selfe, except a verie little for to feed, seeing that thus her egges
might take cold. And furthermore, call againe to mind that which hath beene said
of the Henne: you may also set Hennes vpon Geese egges, and that with better su

and then the fairest and greatest must be chosen. They must be put in a Cowpe in
some Cellar vnder ground, or in some darke and warme place, where the younger
sort is to be kept thirtie daies, and the elder sort two moneths. They must haue giuen
them thrice a day Barly and Wheat meale tempered with Water and Honey, for the
Barly maketh the flesh white, and the Wheat maketh them fat, and maketh a great
liuer. Some doe make them meat with new or drie figges and leauen, and giue them

drinke aboundantly, vsing to rowle their meat all ouer in Br

of their head and belly, and also the fat feathers of their wings, and doe also
put out their eyes for to fat them: Aboue all things, you must not pinch them in
their meat and drinke, because they are great eaters, and giuen much to drinke. Thus
you shall haue them fat at the most within two moneths.
                  The common meat of Geese,Meat for Geese. is all manner of Pulse tempered with Bran and

set them this meat morning, euening, and at noone: and for the rest of the day they
send them to the Medowes, and to the Water-Pooles, vnder the custodie of some
little small Iacke, who may keepe them from going or flying into anie forbidden
places, as also out of the Nettles and Briers, as also from feeding of Henbane, which
some call the Goose-bane, and from Hemlockes, which set them on such a deepe
sleepe as that they die therewithall.
                  Ancient Writers haue not permitted moe than three Geese to one Gander, but we
doe freely allow sixe, and cause to be taken from them the Downe or soft feathers on
the inside of their thighes,The quills of dead Geese are not so good as those of the liue. and the great feathers of their wings to write withall in
March and September: for the quils of the dead Goose are not so sit for all vses, no
more than is the wooll of slaughtered sheepe, or those which die of themselues. And
seldome doe we see much fewer than thirtie Goslings in one roome, howsoeuer our
predecessors would not put anie moe than twentie together, for the greater doe beat

and kept asunder with hurdles, in such sort as sheepe are kept asunder: and they
must haue new straw oftentimes, and that such as is cleane and verie small, for their
house must be alwaies drie, and oftentimes made cleane for feare of vermine.
                  And moreouer,The diseases of Geese. they are subiect vnto the same diseases and casualties that
Hennes be, and therefore they must be tendred after the same manner: Which

also let them haue the libertie of such Ponds as you put your fish into which you
meane to salt, as also of the next Riuer, as you doe your Geese: notwithstanding, it
were good that some should see that they haunt or frequent not your Ponds with
fish, because indeed they will eat vp the small therein. But in other points they need
not so much attendance, seeing for the most part they are nothing in loue with Gardens.
And as for their Neasts to lay in and to sit, they make themselues: and there is
no care greater than this, namely,The egges of Ducks see vpon by a Henne, are better than if they were hatched by the Duck her selfe. to know their haunt, especially that of the wild
ones, in or about what place of the Ponds they vse, that so you may take their egges
to put vnder some Henne to sit them, thereby to make them tame: for the fowle that
is thus or dered will be better than that of the yard, and which stirreth not out of the
Court, or from about the sides of the streets to tread.
                  To take such wild Ducks as are about your Ponds, to make them tame, you must

root and seed of Henbane a good quantitie, and lay it to steepe in a basen full of water
a whole day and a night, afterward put thereinto Wheat, and boyle all together
vntill the said Corne be well steept and swelled, afterward you shall put of the same
Corne in the said place, for the wild Duckes will runne vnto it, and as soone as they
shall haue eaten it, they will fall downe all astonished and giddie. This kind of fowle
is made fat in such manner as the young Geese, that is to say, with the same food; onely
it remaineth, that you should giue vnto them, besides that, the small of the fish, and
so you need not to cowpe them vp: and as for your common ones, the more you suffer
them to runne, the better it is for them.

wast therein. It is sufficient for two paire to take their pleasure in your Pooles,How manie Swannes are ynough to be together. or
foure, if they be verie great, and one paire onely is ynough in your Fish-pond: and
they must haue a house apart in the Orchard or Garden couered ouer a little, and
free from disturbance, often made cleane and refreshed, for they defile verie much.
If they haue not ynough whereon to feed in the place of their abode, you must cast
them some softened bread, or some of the smallest fishes. This is a great eating fowle,
and chargeable to be kept: he maketh his Neast himselfe, and hatcheth but once a
yeare, and three egges at the most at a time, but he is a verie beautifull and pleasant
bird. There is a certaine kind of Swanne which hath his right foot diuided into
fingers, and fashioned with nailes and clawes or tallons, as birds of the prey haue,
whereupon in striking into the water, he catcheth and footeth his prey, but his left
foot is fashioned after the common manner of others, and with it he roweth vpon
the water. Such a one was seene and killed at the Abbey of Iuilly neere Dampmartin,
in the yeare 1554. This kind of Swanne feedeth no where but in the water, and
vpon his prey, and is altogether wild, and cannot handsomely be tamed: but the
common Swanne is not such a one.
                  
                     Socrates in Plato saith, that this bird is dedicated to Apollo, because of the gift of diuination
which he hath, by which he foreseeth his death, and singeth verie sweetly
and melodiously when he perceiueth the same at hand, as seeming thereby to foresee
what good Death doth bring with it. I haue obserued, that he doth not onely foresee
his owne death, but also the death of men, especially when he appeareth in such
places as he was not wont to haunt: Witnesse hereof is S. Bartholomew his day in the
yeare 1572, two or three dayes before which were seene manie Swannes, flying,
swimming, and diuing in the Riuer of Seyne, betwixt S. Clou and the Port of
Nully.
                  Cranes are not much vnlike to Swannes,Cran
                           ••
                        . and are not birds of continuall haunt,
but yearely remouing from the Countries that are more hot vnto those Countries
that are more cold. Their departure is about September, and their returne shortly
after the Spring seed time: and although they doe addict themselues vnto watrie
places, yet they feed, for the most part, of that which the drie land yeeldeth, and not
of things affoorded by the water, for they liue and feed vpon Corne as doe the wild
Geese. There is no cause why you should make any great account of the Crane: for
although hee stay a certaine time with you, yet hee layeth not anie moe than two
egges all the yeare long. Wherefore if you be willing to keepe of them, you may
doe it rather to please your sight withall, than for anie hope of encrease, for they
neither lay nor sit anie moe than two egges. And further, their flesh is of a verie
hard digestion, especially if it be new killed: but if you will eat it, stay some time
after the taking of them, and hang them vpon the arme of some Figge-tree, that
they may grow tenderer: Also eate them rather a long time after they haue
beene dressed, than whiles they are yet warme. When you see them flye aloft
in the Ayre, without making anie noyse, then looke for faire weather: but
and if you see them rest themselues vpon the ground, be ye assured that it will
be raine.
                  If your Farme be neere vnto marishes and places, where Snakes, Lizards, Adders,
and other such like Beasts abound; you may set vp some small Spire or Turret
about your house, or plant vpon some piece of high mounted ground some well-spread
Tree,Storkes. of a great height, for the alluring of Storkes to the same, that they may
helpe to free your house of those said venimous beasts, for they will kill them to
feed their young ones therewith. But yet perswade not your selfe, that you can
easily draw and allure them, nor yet retaine and keepe them, Summer being once
passed; for vpon Winters returne they will be packing into another Countrey.
Notwithstanding, there are some, which not hauing beene disturbed in the time of
their ayring and bringing vp of their young ones, doe euerie yeare repayre to
their wonted ayres, and that by a long 
                        •
                     light out of a farre Countrey, and doe ayre
and neast themselues willingly also in the tops of high Towers, not frequented,

as iudging the place to be such as will not suffer any man to doe them annoyance.
And in the meane time you need not take any care of their Neast, laying, sitting, or
feeding, for they be birds carefull ynough of themselues, and not needing the help
                        •
                     
of any other, and which doe come and goe in such sort as one cannot perceiue them;
in such sort, as that we may rather see them when they be commen, than foresee their
comming, for as much as their comming and going is in the night. Some doe thinke
that they haue no tongue; make no account of them for to eat them, seeing they are
of a verie euill iuice and venimous feeding: and yet this good is in them, that hee
which shall haue eaten of a Storke, shall not haue his eyes bleared or running all that
yeare. It is obserued in this bird, that the young doe feed the old that breed them,
when they cannot flye any more, nor get their prey.

                  Of Feasants.
                  
                     IT is a point of great curiositie to keepe Feasants,Hennes of Numidia. which Columella calleth
Hennes of Numidia: but he that can do it, hath both pleasure and profit;
and he must be such a one as almost doth nothing else: for this bird is
chargeable to maintaine; she will haue her house by her selfe, raised high,
and leaning to the inclosure or wall of the Court, and long also, that her troughes
may be in the ayre, and where the Sunne giueth. And euerie seuerall bird must haue
her owne roome: and yet there must be but one dore vnto their Henne-house for the
cleansing thereof and giuing of them meat. The rest of their house shall be all open
vpon the fore-part, and yet in such sort, as that it shall be sure and fast, by being thick
latted, and of clouen boords, about the height of a fadome below, and verie well couered
aboue.
                  Feasant Cocks and Hennes are hard to tame,Feasant Cocks and Hennes not so 
                           •
                        asie to make tame. if they be not so hatched, or else taken
within the yeare: for the elder sort grow sullen and malecontented, and doe accord
and buckle themselues either to lay or sit. And as for the young, they must be
gently handled, vntill they be well trained, and can easily be content with and apply
themselues to the enduring of a constrained ayre, and that such a one as is not like to
that where they were taken. There must be one Cocke to euerie two Hennes. The
Henne hath but one season wherein she vseth to lay, and that is March, at which time
she beginneth and so continueth vntill she haue orderly layd twentie, and after she
fitteth them all together, or else fifteene of her owne, and some others of another
kind, if you put them vnder her: and she sitteth thirtie dayes; and in the time of her
sitting, you must vse her with the like diligence that you doe the Henne: but this
must be all within her owne house. The young ones being hatched, shall be fed
with flower of Barly boyled and cooled, and afterward with the flower of Wheat:
and sometimes you shall mix herewith, or else giue them by themselues, some Gras-hoppers
and egges of Ants: and you must oftentimes giue them fresh water, and
cleane, for they are subiect to the same diseases that the Henne is.
                  Men of old time were wont to fat their Feasant Cockes and Hennes for Feastiuall
dayes,To fat Feasant Cocks and Hennes. or Banquets and Feasts onely, and not for brood, and gaue vnto them the first
day honied water and strong wine, to cause them to forget their naturall place: after
that, of the flower of Barly tempered with water, of ground Beanes, and of cleane
Barly, of whole Millet, of Turnep seed, and Linseed boyled and dryed, mixt
with the flower of Barly: and for to heat and cleanse their stomackes, they gaue
them Mustard seed for fiue dayes, and so fatted them vp in their Cowpes for
threescore dayes.
                  This is the thing that diuers Cookes of Paris, with certaine other rich Victuallers,
doe know verie well to doe: and they must (as saith Columella) giue them their

                  Of Peacockes.
                  
                     THe Peacocke is a bird of more beautifull feathers than any other that is:
he is quickly angrie, but he is as farre off from taking good hold with
his feet: he is goodly to behold, verie good to eat, and serueth as a watch
in the inner court; for that hee spying strangers to come into the lodging,
he fayleth not to crie out and to aduertise them of the house. It is true that he
is not kept with a little cost and meat, being a great eater, and quickly digesting his
meat: noysome to the house, for that he spoyleth the Gardens, if there be not some
little Medow ground for him to frequent: hee breaketh the roofe and high place of
the house: And the Cocke being ouer-ranke by nature, doth breake the Hennes
egges, thereby to keepe her from sitting, that so he may the more freely enioy and
vse her. The Cocke liueth a long time, as from twentie to fiue and twentie yeares,
but the Henne somewhat lesse, both the one and the other somewhat troublesome to
reare and bring vp whiles they be young, but they need not to haue any great care taken
of them after they haue once left the dam, except it be in keeping them from
hurting the Corne. They loue a hot and temperate ayre, and that is the cause that
they are not brought vp in manie Countries of France, but with much adoe. The
place where they most abound in all the Countrey, is toward Lisieux in Normandie,
for from thence there come great numbers to Paris, for great and sumptuous
Banquets and Marriages: There they make them fat with the drosse of Cyder
and Perrie.
                  People of old and auncient time did cast Islets on the backside of their Gardens,The Peacock
                           •
                         walke.
onely for Peacocks, and there set vp some little shed for them at their pleasure to repaire
vnto, and another for the partie that should feed them. And in Italie vnto this
day they vse, in places neere vnto the Sea shore, to bring vp Peacocks in Islets somewhat
neere vnto the Sea, that so they may preuent such harme as the Foxe might
otherwise doe them; which was also the drift why our auncient predecessors tooke
the same course: but wee▪ which make not so great account of them, are content to
keepe them in some roome ouer the Hennes, euen in the highest part of the Henne-house, for they loue to rowst on high, and in an open ayre, sitting verie often for that
cause vpon trees, but wee prouide them some place below whither to repaire in the
day time. This place must be kept verie cleane, and looked diligently vnto, euen
as the Henne-house,The diseases of Peacocks. for this bird is subiect vnto the same inconueniences and diseases
that Hennes be, and must haue the same remedies administred vnto them.
The place of their abode and haunt must be strewed with Straw, or greene
Grasse,The nature of Pea-hennes. for the Hennes doe lay but seldome, sitting downe low, as is manifest,
in that her egges are found oftentimes dropt downe from her vnder the Pearch:
and this happeneth by their falling from her as shee is asleepe. These birds
bring foorth verie well after they be three yeares old; but before nothing, or
verie little.
                  The Pea-henne hath three seuerall times or seasons of laying in the yeare:The sitting of the Pea-henne. but she
that is set, hath but one, and passeth ouer her other times in hatching and leading of
her young ones. She beginneth her first laying time at mid Februarie, and layeth fiue
egges one after another: at the second, she layeth foure or three: and at the third, three
or two. If the Cock and the Henne tread not, you must bring them to it by such food
and meat as wil set them in heat, as with Beans rosted in hot ashes. And to know when

the Cocke is in the pride or heat, you need no other signe than his viewing of himselfe,
and couering of his whole bodie with the feathers of his tayle, and then we say
he wheeleth.
                  When the Pea-henne sitteth,A Peacock of a white colour. she withdraweth and hideth herselfe from the Cock
in the most secret place she possibly can; for he ceaseth not to seeke her, by reason of
his excessiue rankenesse and lustinesse of nature: and if he find her, he beateth her,
to cause her to rise from off her egges, and then breaketh them. If while shee 
                        •
                     itteth,
shee be couered with a white Linnen cloth, shee will bring forth Chickens all
white, and not of the colour of the Vine bud. And to that end you may shut her
vp in Cowpes or Houses ouer-layd or garnished with some white Cloth or Paintrie,
to the end that whatsoeuer shee looketh vpon while shee sitteth, may be of a
white colour. At the end of thirtie dayes, when the young ones are hatched, and
the Henne diligently fed in the place where shee did sit them (as wee haue said
of the Henne) she must be put vnder a Cowpe in some place where the Cocke cannot
come;
for hee hateth and hurteth his young ones, vntill they be growne to haue
a coppell vpon their heads: and at such time as this is growing out of them,
they must be kept verie warme, for then they be verie sicke, and for the most
part die.
                  You must feed the young ones the first day with Barly meale tempered with wine
in manner of thicke pottage:The feeding of yong Peacocks. and for the thickening of it, some put thereto soft
Cheese, well kneaded, pressed, and purged from Whay, for Whay will hurt them
greatly. Sometimes they must haue Grashoppers giuen them, their feet pluckt away,
Weesels, Spiders, and Flies for their Physicke; for they driue away vermine na
                        •
                     
                     rally,
so that there is scarce any found where they haunt. After six moneths they eat
boyled Barly as the dam doth, and are suffered to runne abroad: but euen then they
must be kept from cold and raine, for they chirpe and hang the wing by and by,
especially in this Countrey, where they are hard to bring vp, if they be not hatched
by mid Iune: for when Autumne doth find them verie young, they doe neuer hold
out Winter.
                  They which will haue the Pea-hennes to hold their three seuerall times of laying,The laying of Pea-hennes.
must set their first egges vnder Hennes that are great, well gouerned, and old, and
that in the beginning of the growth of the Moone, that so the Pea-hennes may hold
on their seuerall courses of laying. And as wee haue alreadie said in the feeding of
Hennes, there must be put vnder the Hennes some fiue of the Pea-hennes, and nine
of her owne: after the tenth day, the nine Henne egges shall be taken away, and other
nine put in their place; by this meanes you shall find, by the end of thirtie daies, that
all will be hatched together: And thus you shall vse manie Hennes at one and the
same time. And seeing the Pea-hennes egge, for the greatnesse of it, cannot be well
turned by the Henne, you shall turne it your selfe verie softly at such time as the
Henne is a feeding, and marke with ynke the place you leaue vppermost, that so you
may know thereby whether the Henne doe turne them, or no, for else you might possibly
lose your time and labour: and when all are hatched, giue all the Chickens to
one onely Henne, and the young Pea-chickens to a Pea-henne, and see that the
Henne leading her brood, do not haunt where the Pea-henne and her Chickens do
come, for so she would leaue her owne, for the disdaine and iealousie she conceiueth
in seeing the fairenesse and greatnesse of the others.
                  Peacocks are verie sicke when they moult,The diseases of Peacocks. and then they must be heartened with
Honey, Wheat, Oates, and Horse-beanes: They are verie hot in the Dog-dayes, so
that then you must not let them want fresh and coole water: and euerie Cock would
haue fiue or six Hennes for change, for he is grieued at them that are readie to lay,
and faileth not, if he can, to breake their egges.
                  The flesh of Peacocks is melancholike,The flesh of Peacocks is hard. and of hard digestion: but to make it tender,
you must kill your Peacocke in Summer a day before you eat him, and in Winter
foure daies, and hang some heauie thing to his legges, or else tye him vpon some
figge-tree staffe, because the wood of the figge-tree hath vertue to make flesh tender

that is tough and hard: The rosted flesh of a Peacock is well kept a whole moneth,

lately discouered by the Spaniards and Portugalls, whether wee call
them Cockes or Peacockes of India; hath more fitted and prouided
for the tooth than for any profit: For they may rightly be tearmed Cofers
to cast Oates into, a deuouring gulfe of meat, and wherein there is no other
pleasure to be taken, but onely in their crie and furiousnesse, when they are come to
be great ones; or continually chirping whiles they be little: besides that, both the
one and the other are ill-fauoured and ougly to behold, for the deformitie of their
heads; for the male hath no combe, as our Cockes, but in stead thereof a red fleshinesse,
and vnder his chinne a great wide and long throat, which swelleth and changeth
into manie colours when he beginneth to be angrie.That a Peacock is better meat than a Turkies. It is very true, that his
flesh is fine and delicate, but without taste, and of hard digestion: And this is
the cause why men vse to powder them, larde them much, and season them
with Spices. There is much more pleasure and goodnesse in the flesh of a Peacocke.
                  The meat fit for this kind of Bird,What meat is fit for Turkies. is the same that is good for Hennes, and so
made, and with like diligence: and because his propertie is to be abroad, to feede
vpon Grasse, Wormes, and Hearbes, therefore it remaineth that wee set downe
what is required ouer and aboue: And the Farmer may well say, That looke how
manie Turkies he hath in his yard, euen so manie Mule Colts hath he in respect of
their feeding. Their ordering is lesse troublesome that of the Peacockes,
saue that they doe not so well endure and abide the cold, neither doe they require
to be pearched so high in the open ayre: but they eat vp and make great wast in
Gardens, and are filthie as Goslings, and therefore some must be readie to make
them cleane euerie day. In Winter they must be set in a warme place, and drie:
their pearch must not be aboue eight or tenne foot from the earth, because they doe
not flye high.
                  As concerning their laying and sitting,The times wherein Turkies doe lay. it is altogether like to that of the Peacockes,
and their egges may as well be set vnder Hennes, and ledde afterward
by the same, whiles the Turkie Hennes doe accomplish their seuerall times of
laying.
                  Their diseases and remedies are also all alike,The diseases of Turkies. so that it were in vaine to speake of
them here againe.

pleasure than for breeding) shall be ordered after the manner of the
Feasant-house, that is, after the manner of a great Cowpe, so leaning against
the wall of the back-yard, and open toward the light, wouen and
wrought with the strings of a small Bow, put through wood, after the manner of
Bird-cages, with a dore of the same: And within, especially toward the corners,
there shall be great store of Perches, and branches of boughes of Iuniper, Bayes, and
other trees, within which there shall be tyed against the said wall small baskets to allure
them to lay and sit in, if so be they haue any inclination thereunto. It shall be of
the height of a man: and ouerthwart, and euerie way, you shall hang Perches, stayed
vp at both ends, for seats for them to sit vpon; and vnder their Perches much fresh
straw, which you must often renew when you make them cleane. On that side towards
the light, all along their house, you shall weaue and worke in two boords of a
good length, and a third vnderneath them, and there shall you make places for the

to eat their meat, and to set their water-pots for them to drinke, which you shall refresh
and make cleane verie often. These birds are all of them such as vse to got
together in flockes, and delight in hot ayre, and in cold weather flye ouer the Sea
out of one Countrey into another. And therefore to tame them in such manner,
as to make them like our house-birds, would be a verie hard and difficult thing:
And againe, wee make no further account of them than for their daintinesse and
delicatenesse; which is the cause why they are of such request in Feasts and
Banquets.
                  Of all these fore-named kinds of Birds, there is none more apt to tame than the
Turtle doues,Turtle doues. neither yet sooner fatted: for to take them after they be somewhat
great, and slie well, you must giue them wine, for by the means of it they doe quickly
fall to forget their libertie and freedome; for this bird is of a great stomacke, and
beareth it therefore verie mournefully, when shee perceiueth her selfe taken: for
which cause also they almost neuer lay when they be restrained and kept in, neithe

eaters, and more hard to tame: in Winter they loue a sup of wine, and doe grow
verie fat, so also doe the Turtles. Againe you must take heed not to forget your
Grauell.
                  The browne or Woodcocke-coloured Partridge is more easily tamed than the
spotted,Partridges of browne colour, and spotted. or any other sort; likewise they haue not so delicate and fine a flesh: being

sicknesse and headach, that it causeth the falling sicknesse, conuulsion, and distension
of the Muscles, and for that cause that they ought to be stuffed with Millet,
or boyled therein: or else if anie should find themselues ill after them, for to drinke
the decoction of Millet, or of Mittle tree berries: and it will be good also to giue the
same to Quailes to eat. The Cockes are nothing lesse hot than the Partridge: The
Henne so soone as she hath layd her egges, sitteth them, and by and by after the hath
hatched her young ones, she draweth them into some other place, to the end that such
as goe about to take them, may not find their place: They be birds vsing to flocke together,
and they goe away at Spring time, and returne in Winter, and in the beginning
of Autumne.
                  Thrushes are not naturally breeding in this Countrey,Thrushes▪
                      as being an excessiue cold
place: and hardly at anie time doe they endure this aire, and therefore it were but
foolishnesse to goe about to fat them here. This bird is addicted to hot Countries,
as also to such places as where there are great store of Oliue trees: for they doe
greatly delight in Oliues, and grow fat at such season as they grow ripe. It is a
bird also giuen to make great hauocke and spoyle: for the Thrushes doe poure
downe themselues vpon the Oliue trees in great flights, and hauing eaten their full,
they also carrie away at their departure one in their bill, and one in their clawes, after
the manner of men of Warre. They are found also and made fat in the mountaine
and hillie Countries, but it is in Winter time: for they gather fat, and fill themselues
in cold weather, if it be anie whit moderate. The men of old and ancient time
did much esteeme them,Sous. and sold them in the time of the Romanes for tenne Sous

owne Countrey, those of Lyons, Prouence, and Auuergnac: but they are not so
great on this side the mountaines, as they are beyond. This bird is more sullen than
anie of the afore named, and dieth shortly after she is taken, if she be carried out
of her ordinarie ayre, or if she be not put presently amongst other old tame ones:
They must haue their meat cast them vpon a verie cleane floore,The ordinarie meat for Thrushes. and farre from
their Perches: and some cast them dried figges stamped with the flower of meale,
and that so much, as that there may something remaine more than they can eat:
And sometimes, for change of diet, they may haue cast them the fruit of Masticke
or Mulberrie tree, or the berries of Iuie and wild Oliue trees: and yet

notwithstanding their meat-pots must alwaies be full of Millet, for this is their chiefe
meat. Againe, you must see them prouided of cleare water as well as other bird

they get their owne liuings the most part of the yeare, and in that they lay sixe or seuen
times a yeare two egges a peece: yea, and oftener and greater, if you change
the young House-doues Pigeons with those of the Cote, after that they be once
eight daies old, to the end they may accompanie the Cocke Pigeons which goe
by themselues without anie Matches: but this must be done so cunningly, as that
the dams doe not perceiue it. It is true, that this bird is of great charges, and w

much in respect of grounds: and for this cause there is no ground Pigeon-house
allowed, but to such as be Lords in see simple; neither yet verie oft anie Dofeu-houses
in vpper roomes, except it be to such as haue a competent quantitie of arable
ground.
                  Let vs then prepare to our good liking,Where a ground Doue-house is permitted and lawfull to be had. and for the ease of the Huswife, a ground
Doue-house, out of the noise of folkes, the dashing of Trees one against another, and
the roaring of Waters, and let it be set in a place somewhat raised: or else let vs
build it right in the middest of the base Court, which is the place of our Countrey
house, before in this Booke appointed, and that after the fashion of a stone Tower
made for a Wind-mill, or somewhat neerely resembling it: but let it be distant:
flight or two from anie water, to the end that the old Pigeon may warme that which
shee bringeth for to giue to her young ones: For it is certaine, that as the Pies and
Sparrowes, the male and the femalePies and Sparrowes, male and female, do sit. doe sit by courses, and as while the one of them

the East quarter in this Countrey, but that it take part also of the South, because this
bird doth greatly delight in the Sunne, beating and casting his beames vpon their
house, and entring in at their windowes and loope-holes, or higher lights, especially
in the Winter time: and further, that vpon the South there be prouided a sh

and opening window in Winter, to giue some heat vnto the Pigeons. There
must not anie window be made vpon the North side:A dore window. or if there be anie, for to let in
the coole aire in Summer, yet it must be verie close stopt vp while the cold endureth.
Let the South window be turned toward the Barne dore: and by the side of the said
dote let there be a Water-pot set vpon a pillar of stone for the Pigeons to drinke at,
and let that Water-pot be made in manner of a basen, diuided into manie partitions
to drinke at, to the end, that when the Pigeons haue pickt vp the Corne scattered
from the Fanne, or striked abroad by the Flaile, they may haue their water neere
and easie for manie to come by together, either to drinke or bathe themselues in.
And you must procure and see that this Doue-house be built and layd with a good
and broad foundation, well couered, and the floore close beaten and loamed ouer,
to preuent the danger of the dung, which doth vndermine and corrupt the
foundation. It must also be well and close layd and drawne ouer with Morta

within,Beasts to be kept out of Doue-houses. and the ehinkers or clefts which may grow must oftentimes be searched out
and stopt, for feare of Rats or Mice, which is a mischiefe often happening where
there is not anie plaister to come by: and it must also be drawne ouer in like manner
on the outside, for the crackes that happen in Lime and Sand are in stead of ladders
for Fulmers, Weasels, Cats, and other beasts to climbe vp by. And for the verie same
cause you shall make round about the Doue-house, on the outside, two out-casts of
hewed stone, or round rings of plaister, as broad as three or foure chesse of stones:
the one of these rings or out-laies shall be about the middest of the Doue-house; and
the other close vnder the window, at which the Pigeons vse to goe in, &amp; vpon which
the Pigeon also may sport and turne her selfe round. As concerning the falling window
and chiefe entrance into it, it must be made higher than the dor-window, and
larger also: And yet I meane, that this window without be round compassed with
white plates well nailed to the walls,A draw lattice window. and that is shut with a falling lattice thicke
wrought, made to rise and fall by an engine euening and morning, thereby to preuent
the danger of Owles and Iennie whuppers. The holes made of earth troden with
straw, are more kind for the Pigeon than those of Boord, or square Tyles, or of Plaister,
howsoeuer they be subiect to grow full of chinkers and vermine, which infeeble
the Pigeons when at anie time they seize vpon them: And therefore, if you will haue
them good, you must draw them ouer with a strong crust of Lime within and without.
Againe, howsoeuer you make them for matter, yet they must be made so large,
as that the Pigeon may turne her selfe in them, keeping her feathers vnruffled; and so
high, as that the Pigeon may stand vpright in it, and not touch the top with her back.
If either of these two points be missing, then she leaueth her hole desolate and forsaken,
and oftentimes the house to.
                  It will be good also, in respect of some beasts which are enemies vnto Pigeons, to
hang in the Doue-house the head of a Wolfe, which partly by the smell, and partly
by the shape, driueth away such beasts: or else to sticke some branches of Rue in the
windowes or dores of the Doue-house. Vpon the pinnacle of the

                     oofe make the
picture of a Pigeon, either of Potters clay, or of Plaister, to draw such as flie by, thither.
Prouide in some place about your Doue-house good store of Pots for Sparrowes,
with stickes of thorne to hang the Pots on, and others to rest the Sparrowes
vpon: and withall, beware that this mournefull birds doe not take vp his habitation
in your Dout-house, for hee would make wild and estrange your young
Pigeons.
                  To store a Doue-house,To store a Doue-house. you must first consider the contents of it, as whether it be
made to containe manie, or but a meane sort, or but a few, and so to put therein an answerable
number of Pigeons: Twentie paire of Pigeons are ynough for three hundred
holes: Likewise if the Doue-house be of a thousand holes, or moe, then so small
a companie would not be ynough; neither indeed would they loue it, they being of
so small a number, but would goe away or die in the end.
                  The Pigeons wherewith you mind to store your Doue-house must be young ones,
taken when they are halfe downe and halfe feathered, together with the old ones
their dams, and so put at libertie in your Doue-house, or rather in great Cowpes,
and cause them to be fed with Fetches and water with some skilfull handler of Pigeons
twice a day, so long as till they become to eat and drinke by themselues: for
by this meanes they will soone haue forgotten both their old house, as also the old
ones, and so will yeeld themselues willingly to tarrie in such Doue-house, as wherein
you will first lodge and put them; which the old ones would not doe: for being
translated from another place, they would find out the way to take their flight directly
to their former and first home, so soone as you had made them way to get
forth, how farre soeuer they had beene brought. The Pigeons good to encrease
store, are the ash, browne, and blacke coloured; the rough-footed or coppild ones
are too mournefull, and keeping too much at home: so in like manner are they
which are of colour like to a Snailes bellie; the pie-coloured ones and the hooded
ones, those which glister like gold about their neckes, and haue their eyes and

feet red, are the freest of all other. The white are strong to bring vp, but most subiect
to the Kite and other rauenous birds, because they are verie easily perceiued as
they flye by a farre off. You must make your choice of the May flight, because there
is no such feare of them for the cold: They grow more easily, and thriue better, and
are sooner able to get their owne meat. Aboue all things, let them not be pinched of

much) and sometimes Wheat among the ridled scraps, and let them not goe out till
after fifteene daies of your putting of them in, during which time you shall cut their
wings: you shall keepe a net spread ouer the windowes, to the end that they may
haue the light of the day, and yet not be able to get forth: About the end of fifteene
daies you shall permit them the fields, taking away the said nets, and yet not
before night approch, the time being cloudie, darke, and inclined to raine: for they
will not goe farre from the place of their late inlargement, neither will or can they
possibly but returne vnto the Doue-house, if it were but to hide their heads that
night: In doing whereof, they will learne to marke the place of their receit, and
not forsake or leaue the same, hauing neuer had the

made for them to light vpon at the comming to the Cote, a loafe made of
red earth, Cummin seed well bruised, Honey, and Brine, all being well boyled together,

fayle to returne thither againe, they are so much giuen to the pleasing of their
taste: And further, by the verie sent and smell of this remayning about their
billes, they will bee the meanes to allure others along with them euen to their
Cote, which for the foresaid commoditie sake they will learne neuer to leaue or
forgoe.
                  You shall also keepe them from flying away, if you giue them Lentils steeped in
honied water, or boyled in some cuted wine: or else drie Figges, mixed with the
meale of Malt and Honey. Some say also, that Pigeons will neuer goe away, if
there be set vpon the Turret of the Doue-house the head of a Bat, or the branch of
a wild Vine: or if the dores and windowes of the Cote be rubbed or annoynted
with the oyle of Balme: as also that Pigeons when they flye into the fields will bring
home others with them, if you rub their wings with the said oyle of Balme: or if
you giue them, before their going thither, Fetches, besprinkled with wine: or shall
haue steept in such liquor for them the seed of Agnus castus; for other Pigeons,

                     NOtwithstanding that wee haue yeelded and giuen the ordering of the
Kine vnto the Huswife, and that Oxen are to be kept and ordered in
their meat after the same manner: notwithstanding, in Countries, and
about such Farmes, as where they are kept for the Plough and sale, there

                        •
                     s prouided a man, which hath no other charge but to thinke vpon and order them,
obserued and noted that he hath almost as much pains and labour to take about these
as about a Horse. It is true, that a Cow is not of so great charge to maintaine and
keepe, neither in respect of her meat, neither yet of her handling and managing,
neither yet in furniture: but the force and strength whereby the Oxe doth cleaue the
ground, and draw the Cart, requireth one that should doe nothing but attend them:
notwithstanding that, he must feed two for one; and that three of the best Oxen in
Bourbon, or in the Forest, do not so much as one good Horse of France, or of Beaux.
In like manner it is out of doubt, that the labour of Oxen is not admitted of but
where meere necessitie forceth, because there is no conuenient and commodious
keeping of Heards of Horse, or where Horse is not to be come by, but out of some
farre Countrey. For though the feeding be good and singular for Oxen, as in Flanders,
and elsewhere; yet it falleth out so, that if they can haue Horse to doe their
worke, they doe like better thereof than of the Oxe: Euen as in Prouence, Languedoe,
and Auuergnac, men doe vse the labour of their Mules and their young Colts

rather than of Oxen and Kine, because they effect not, or dispatch their worke 
                        〈◊〉
                     
well, or yet so speedily: howsoeuer, yet the labour of the Oxe is maruellous good▪
auaileable, and profitable in strong grounds; for they draw the Ploughes deepe into
the earth, and turne ouer great furrowes: as may be seene in Italie, where there are
great Oxen, long and broad breasted, in Gascoigne, Bourbon, Poitou, Aniou, and
Mayne. Againe, men of ancient time vsed no other beast but Oxen, because that
Oxen are more sparing for the profit of the Farmer; for they are contented to feed
vpon pasture, without anie other food or prouender, besides the great profit and
good prouision comming of them: for being either shoulder-shot or bruised in ani

kind of Cattell (I meane the Horse) doe not affoord.
                  The Oxe-house must be built of stone,The Oxe-house. paued with grauell, or sandie ground,
somewhat descending and sloping, that so the moisture may not stand. It must also
stand vpon the South, that so it may be the more drie, and lesse subiect vnto cold and
frostie winds: it shall be nine foot wide, and onely of such height, as that the Oxe
may stand vpright, and the Oxe-keeper may haue space ynough to goe round about
them, to see and serue them with fodder: as also to the end that seeing Oxen
will be striking one another with their hornes, the weaker may haue space to
withdraw himselfe. The Rackes must be so high, as that the Oxen cannot easily
reach them.
                  The charge of him that is to keepe the Oxen,The Oxe-keepers charge. is to be gentle and louing vnto the
Oxen, dressing and giuing them their meat, prouiding them good litter, either of
straw, or some other thing, to rub them euerie euening before they lye downe, and
in the morning to eurrie them and wipe them cleane gently, washing their tayles oft
with warme water: To keepe their house cleane, and not to let Hennes or Swine come
therein; for feathers will kill Oxen, and the dung of a diseased Swine engendreth the
Murraine or Plague: To giue fresh straw vnto these Cattell, and to cast to them in
Summer the greene sprouts and tender

Winter, of Beane stalkes and grasse euening and morning. Let him be skilfull to discerne
when Plough Oxen haue labored much or little, that he may accordingly giue
them a proportionable quantitie of meat, and also such as shall be necessarie: he may
not let them take paine or labour in verie hot or verie cold weather, neither yet when
it is verie moist: he may not let them drinke quickly after their trauell: but if they

                     e
shall put vnder an Onion, rosted verie soft betwixt two coales, tying it thereto with
a cloth. Let him oftentimes make cleane and refresh their pasternes, and not suffer
them to cleaue or rend: and to that end let him euerie yeare cause to be repaired the
pauement of his Oxe-house, which will serue also to keepe away beasts and

least they should strike one another. When they labour not, let him water then
twice a day in Summer, and once in Winter, and that in cleare, cleane, and coole water:
For as hath beene said heretofore, the Oxe seeketh after the water that is clear
and most bright, as the Horse after that which is troubled. Let him carefully looke
vpon their comming from field, whether anie of them haue got anie thorne in his
foot, if they be sweatie, if the Collar or the Yoke haue caused them anie hurt abou

so long as he is in the house, let his hornes be tied, and he close made fast to
the cratch. Couple him with another of the same greatnesse, grosenesse, age, and
strength, tie them the one by the other, lead them into the fields tied together, to the
end they may one of them loue another: let them oftentimes see the Oxen that draw
the plow, or which till the ground, or doe any other manner of worke: and to the
end they may loose their naturall wildnesse, lead them to heare the noise of mills, of
men, of forges, and other things which make great rumbling: neere vnto the time
when you would haue them to draw, which is from two yeares and a halfe to three,
giue them the yoke and beele fit for beasts of their age, and sixtie daies after you shall
fasten them to the waine with the teame, to draw it through the fields, or foure daies
after you shall fasten vnto the teame a piece of wood or other load. In the end, accustome
them to be put to draw before Oxen, which are in the plough incouraging
and cherishing them and that without any stroakes, vntill such time as they
bee made cunning: trouble and wearie them not too much with labour the first
yeare.
                  If you buy Oxen for labour,To buy Oxen. take them of the same coast and quarter that your
Farme is: for they cannot acquaint themselues so easily with a strange ayre, as horses
doe: and if vpon occasion you buy them in a strange Countrie, then buy them such
as were bred in a barren and plaine Countrie, and those will thriue and take well
vvith euerie place, whether the ayre be hot or tender, or subtile and thin. Furthermore,
it remaineth that you chuse them of three yeares old or thereabout, for sooner
you cannot traine them to labour, though you haue bought them: doe not labour
them much for the first yeare, and especially in the time of great heat, feeding them
rather with good hay than with grasse; so they will grow able by little and little
to endure all paine, and will feare the heat the lesse, and will continue sound and
cherefull a longer time, yea and they will spend you lesse: for your cartell not feeding
vpon grasse, you shall gather the greater store of hay in your meadowes, and
better then and if your beasts had broused the grasse, being but young and peeping
out of the ground. You shall know how old they are by looking in their mouthes,To know the age of an Oxe.
for within ten moneths of the first yeare they change their fore-teeth: and sixe moneths
after the next, and at the end of three yeares they change them all, and when
they be in their middle and best age their teeth are white, long, and euen: but when
they grow old, shey become short, vneuen and blacke.

of a peck of Barly meale, wherein you shall put a whole egge, the shell excepted, and
with a quarter of a pint of cured wine, you shall make him drinke it with a hor

or otherwise: Or else take of Dogges-grasse and stampe it, after mixe and steepe it
in warme water with Beane meale, cold Gruell, and the meale of Lentils, all this being
well mixed, you shall giue it to the beast early in the morning. For an old Cough
it is sufficient to take two handfuls of Hysope, old or new, and make a decoction in
common water: after, when you haue strained it, you shall mix therwith of the flower
of Starch two parts, and cause the beast to take them thus. The distilled water of Hysope
may be put amongst, or else the decoction of Mints and Hysope together. The
iuice of Leekes is good for the same, being pressed out well and strongly, and giuen
with oyle Oliue: for there hath not beene knowne so old and long growne a Cough
which the roots of Leekes, washed, made cleane, and giuen in decoction with the
flower of Wheat, hath not put downe and rebated the strength of. Of the same effect
is the flower of the euerlasting Tare, commonly giuen and vsed, or offred with ho

                  For all manner of pains,Paine. in what parts of the bodie soeuer they be, causing the Oxe
that he can neither goe nor doe anie other thing well, make somentations, and apply
cataplasmes, with the decoction of Camomill, Melilot, and Linseed.

Smithes Forge.
                  In the diseases of the flanks,The diseases of the flankes. wherewith Oxen are oftentimes tormented, you must
make a Cataplasme of three handfuls of the seed of Coleworts, with a quarter of a
peck of Starch well powned together and mingled with cold water, applying it afterward
vnto the pained places. But the most soueraigne that may be found, is, to
take of the leaues of Cypresse, without the boughes, three handfuls, and to doe as
is abouesaid, adding thereto strong vineger, to knead and dissolue the same in:
but if this will not, then take three ounces of Perrosin, or Colophoni, which is more
hard, and dissolue and make them liquid at the heat of the fire, and whiles it is yet
good and hot, mixe therewith the flower of Barly, and make it all boyle together,

and so you shall applie this cataplasme verie hot vpon the flankes, and so vp to the
reines.
                  It is to be knowne that the Oxe hath paines in his reinesThe paine of the reines. when he seemeth to draw
his hinder parts after him, and cannot lift his legges behind for his best ease; he staggereth
and soltreth behind; he breaketh not vp his taile, but suffereth it to draw all
along after him; his stale hath an ill sent, and all his hinder loynes shew heauie,
mooue not but constrayned, and that in mincing manner. If there be any inflammation
about them, he pisseth red as bloud: If this continue, and that he cast forth much
such, there is then no more remedie: but and if it be but a little coloured with bloud,
there is some hope of recouerie. For this disease you shall cause him be let bloud vpon
the taile veines behind, or else of the veine called the Mother-veine, which is found
alongst the flanke, to draw neere vnto the reines. For his drinke make him to take
the juice of Leeks vvith vvarme vvater, or else his owne vrine.
                  For the inflammationInflammation. of the muscles as well outward as inward of the reines and
flankes, vvhich commeth of some fall that the beast hath taken in some hard and stonie
place, and vvhich happeneth not without the companie of a contusion, appoint
that the Oxe which hath fallen, so soone as he commeth into his house, doe not remoue
from one place, bath the hurt part vvith cold vvater: after that, vse and applie
vnto it comfortable liniments and seare-clothes which may not be too hot. The
markes of this disease are, the outward parts ouer against the reines are hard, the cods
hung short, being gathered into the bodie, and that in such sort as that there is not
much of them left out to be seene; he stirreth not his hinder legs vvith any ease: and
vvhen he is laid, he riseth not but vvith verie great paine.
                  Of verie great cold gotten by hauing trauelled in snowie and frosen places;Paine in the heele. or else
after some thaw: the fault also may be committed in not hauing his pasternes so well
bathed vvith vrine, and couered ouer with dung as they should at euening after his
labour: for vpon these causes the heele groweth exuleerated, and maketh shew as
though it would fall off and loose his place; there beginneth a bearing out, vvhich
afterward turneth to an vlcer, and troubleth the gate of the Oxe: the place must be
verie deepely scarified, and a sleight fire applied afterward to the places searified,
and againe vpon the places so scorched the sweet oyntment, otherwise called oyntment
of Roses, vvith a defensatiue of vinegar and vvater, and so bound vp and rolled.
The core once fallen out, the place must be vvashed vvith vrine and vinegar
made hot: after this, there must be an emplaister or cataplasme of Melilot made, either
of the fore appointed, or of old Swines-grease, vvrought and plied betwixt your
two hands.
                  If the cods be swolne vpon any occasion whatsoeuer,The cods swolne you shall annoint them euening
and morning vvith sweet seame, or else bath them vvith strong vinegar, wherein
shall be tempered sine fullers earth, and the dung of Oxen. Some hold it for a naturall
remedie to haue the dung of a dogg to cure the swellings of an Oxes genitories,
if so that they be often rubbed therewithall.

cause him to take downe through his nosthrils; Bitumen judaicum, Brimstone, Bayberries,

Salt, all being boyled in vvater, and taken in the same vvater vvarme, and giue him
nothing to drinke or eat vntill it haue done purging. And to the end that you may
keepe him from being sicke all the yeare, at the beginning of the Spring, Summer,

Poppie, stalke and root, stampt with Honie, serueth to make a medicine for this purpose.
                  In the paines of the flankes,Paines of the Flankes. which oftentimes torment Oxen, you must make a
cataplasme of three handfulls of Colewort seed, with a quarter of a pecke of Starch
well stamped together, and tempered with cold water, and after applie it vnto the
parts pained. The best remedie that can be found for them, is to take of the leaues of
Cypres without the boughs three handfulls, and to doe as before, adding to them
strong vinegar to worke and dissolue them in.
                  In the paines of the reines,Paines in the Reynes. you must let him bloud in the veines vnder the tayle
behind, or else the veine called the Mother-veine, which is found along the flankes
drawing neere vnto the reines: for his drinke giue him of the juice of Leekes with
warme water, or else with his owne vrine.

the hoofe at the tip thereof euen to the quicke, and so cause it come forth, and wrap
his pasterne in a Leather pouch, in such sort, as that the water may not hurt him till
he be whole. If he halt by reason of some sinew, hauing taken a blow by some other

some small quantitie of Hay to the hornes of such Oxen as would strike with the
horne, to the end that all that met him should take heed. And hence riseth the French

he shall haue need: for the marrow of the Oxe doth verie much good in resoluing and
softning hard tumors. The gall of the Oxe is yet better than that of the Bull: it doth
throughly heale the vlcers of the fundament, mixed with the iuice of Leekes: being
dropt into the eare, it doth take away the buzzing of the eare: being rubbed about

whiles yet it sucketh and is young, both for the Sowce and salted parts

things, as also the harme that they doe, may be answered and proued by their rooting
vp and vndermining of Walls by the foot and bottome, the trampling which

they keepe about Trees, Medowes, and vnsowne places. For this cause, in a Farme

giuing them, and renewed, doth fat them as much as their meat: And you must
take care, that their Troughes be alwaies cleane: And against variable weather, the
Hogheard must haue in store much Acornes,Swines meat. Beanes, Crabs, or wild Peares, or some

heat the cold meats which they shall haue fed vpon in the field all the day long: and
thirdly, they will rest better in the night: and lastly, not become so subiect to diseases.
And let there be speciall care had that their meat be not cold, not too thinne, least
is cause them the flux of the bellie.
                  There is also two other Foods, which are verie naturall and excellent for Hogges:
the first whereof is Ale or Beere Graines, that is to say, after your Malt hath beene
ground and masht, and that you haue drawne both your best and your smaller drinke
from it; then with the remaines, mixt either with Whay, Buttermilke, Washings of
Vessels, or such like, you shall feed your Swine twice a day, and be sure to fill their
bellies. This food will preserue and keepe them in good plight and liking: and
though it will not fatten, or make them readie for slaughter, yet it will hold them in
good flesh, and prepare them so well for feeding, that with lesse cost you may make
them seruiceable. The second is Chaundlers Graines, which is the dregs, skins, and
other substances, which at the melting of his Tallow will by no meanes be dissouled;
these you shall mixe with the Swines Wash, being a little warmed, and giue him a
good meale thereof three times a day, and it will fatten him exceedingly, and in
verie short space.
                  Also if you take raw Malt when it is almost readie to goe to the Kilne,To feed Swine speedily. and as the
Husbandman saith, is only well comed, and with it feed your Swine, there is nothing
in the world that will sooner fatten them: for besides that it is a great feeder, it feedeth
and maketh both the flesh and fat exceeding white, and pleasant both to the eye and
tast: Only this obseruation you must euer hold, that when you haue fed your Swine
to his full proofe, with what food soeuer it be that you feed them, that then you
harden that fatnesse, by giuing the Swine good store of drie Pease or Beanes foure
or fiue daies before he come to slaughter: for without it, the fat will consume in the
pot, and the flesh will much lessen. Now during the time that you feed your Swine,
it shall be good that once or twice you giue them good store of Veriuice and
Radle or red Oaker mixt together: for this will not onely stay the flux of the bellie,
but also cleanse and preuent the Meazle, which is verie incident, and generally
happeneth to all Swine in their feeding. Also you shall note, that the Husbandman
is of opinion, that you cannot outer-feed or make your Swine too fat: for (sayth he)
the fatter your Bacon is, the more is your profit, and three bits of such Lard shall sooner
cloy and fill the bellie of a hynde, than a whole Gommon of such Bacon as it
halfe fed, and hath the leane thereof equally mixed with the fat together. Whence
it commeth, that the thriftie Husbandman will seeke all meanes, both by Mast,
Corne, Hippes, Hawes, or anie other moat, to raise his Swine to as great proofe as
he can anie way compasse.

but then they grow not so much: If you geld them, growne somewhat bigge,
they grow a deale more, but then the flesh is not so good: And therefore it
will be good to doe it when they are betwixt foure and sixe moneths old, and

that he is found to be without appetite: For your better certaintie, when there
doe not appeare anie of these signes, pull from him, against the haire, a handfull

                  But he is subiect especially to be meazled,The meazle in Hogges. because of his much and filthie feeding:
and this is the cause why some doe search the roots of his tongue, and others
behind the eares, when he is carried to the Markets to be sold in Faires or in good
Townes. And I thinke that this was the cause why our fore-fathers made it not
an ordinarie thing to eat, and that the Iewes doe abhorre to eat it at all. This disease
is not cured but with great difficultie:The way to cure the meazle Hogge. notwithstanding it will in some sort be cured,
if his Stie be euerie day made cleane: if he be suffered to walke and goe into the

Sea water, or salt water: if he haue Bay-berries beaten and mingled amongst his
meat: if there be giuen him the drosse of the Wine-presse, mingled with Branne and
Leauen.Signes of the meazled Hogge. Now there are three infallible signes to know the Swine to be meazled:
as if there be found vnder his tongue blackish pustules: if he cannot carrie himselfe
vpright of his hinder legges: and thirdly, if his bristles, puld off his backe, shew
bloudie at the roots. Likewise, for that the Hogge, by reason of his filthinesse, for
the most part hath one fault or other betwixt his skinne and flesh, how sound soeuer
he be; it is good, after he be killed, to haue his haire swinged off with straw, rather
than to scald them off with hot water:It is better to burne than to scald hogges. for the fire doth draw out a great deale more
easily than warme water that, whatsoeuer it is, that may be betwixt the skinne and
the flesh. Yet the scalding of Hogges keepeth the flesh whitest, plumpest, and
fullest, neither is the Bacon so apt to reast as the other; besides, it will make it somewhat
apter to take salt: howsoeuer, if it be for Porke, then you must necessarily
scald them, because the fire will else harden the skinne too much, and make
the flesh vnkindly: besides, the swindging of Hogges leaueth the roots of the
haires in the skinne, and the scalding bringeth them forth, which makes the flesh
the better.

there must all diligence be vsed to keepe them from Cold, from the Purples, from the
Scab, from two much ranknesse of bloud, from the Rot, and other such inconueniences
as sometimes spread and proceed from one to another, and that he hath likewise
care, and doe his whole endeauour, in keeping them both in the Fields and at the
Cratch: but it is as true that there riseth as great profit and commoditie to the Farmer.
For besides the dung which they make, and which exceedeth all other kinds
of dung in goodnesse, for the great substance, strength, and heartening which it giueth
vnto the ground, they bring yet infinite other commodities: as by Wooll, whereof
are made Cloth, Hats, Caps, and manie other stuffes: by their Fells, which serue
for Furre or for Leather: by their Milke, whereof are made Cheeses verie excellent,
as may be seene by those which the Towne of Betune doth affoord: and finally, by
their flesh, which is so good and excellent of it selfe, that no continuall vse of it doth
euer make it the lesse pleasant in the eating: so that for certaine it may be said of it,
that if the flesh of this Beast were as scarce as that of the Fawne, Hind, and other
Venison, it would be the onely Venison of request before all other in the world.
And this further is to be seene and obserued for a rare and singular commoditie in
all the foresaid things proceeding from these Cattell that bring forth Wooll,The profit of Sheepe and Muttons. and
not lightly to be passed ouer of the Husbandman; namely, that there is not anie one
of them which is not alwaies readie, and of present imployment, and whereof there
are not moe buyers than sellers, so that the Husbandman need not doubt of anie long
staying for the sale thereof. For first of all, the Dung is in imployment the verie first
houre; the Wooll no sooner shorne, but it is greedily catcht vp; and so soone as the
Mutton is flead, you haue a chapman for the flesh, and another for the Fell: The
Cheese will either serue you at your Table, or else the Marchant. But and if you be
not disposed thus to retaile the seuerall commodities of this beast, you shall find
chapmen to buy them in grosse▪ Which is yet more, if you be not able to abide vntill
they be full growne, and in their ripest season, to be made mony of, yet then may you
find to content your selfe, and procure pence by selling away such of the Lambes as
may be culled out of the whole flocke. Let it not then seeme strange, if we teach the
good Husbandman, that he attend and haue a speciall care ouer his Sheepefold, and
that in a higher measure than ouer anie other of his Cattell.The seating of the Sheepe-house. Wherefore he shall set
his Sheepe-house in the highest part of his Court, right in the face of the South Sun,

to the end it may be the lesse annoyed with moisture, and more open to a wholesome
aire: which shall be of such length, as that his slocke may haue roome therein without
treading one vpon another, setting it round about with Mangers or Sheep-racks
of a low pitch for to fodder them in. There shall be a floore of sawed boords betwixt
the Sheepe roome and the Roofe, to the end that they may be the warmer in
the Winter, and that the Snow, which may beat in at the tile, doe not fall downe vpon
their fleeces, and so melting with their heat, pierce downe vnto the skin, and make
them cold. He shall haue a Shepheard for to guide them, which shall be gentle, louing
his flocke, nimble, of a loud voice, and able to whoop well, giuen to take pains,
able to reckon, and by nature enclined to good and honest things: for there are but
few of this profession now adaies (especially neere to Townes and Cities) but that
by their slouthfulnesse and great leysure doe giue themselues to some euill deuises,
practises, and malice, rather than to the good and profit of their masters: so that of
them ill disposed, we daily see to ensue and grow manie thefts, filching and pilfering

first Shepheards of Egypt and other places were the bringers to light of Astrologie,
Physick, Musick, and manie other liberall Sciences: and I know not whether I may
father the worthie art of Warfare vpon them, or no; as also Policie, Principalitie, and
the Gouernment and welding of Kingdomes: for sure I am, that they did intrench

Seasons, and by long vse and obseruation marking the goodnesse and prosperousnesse,
as also the inconueniences and hard successes, of Times: in such sort, as that of
the Shepheards of those times came and sprung the men of deepe knowledge and
vnderstanding: The Hieroglyphicks may witnesse the same. To conclude therefore,
there is great care to be had in the chusing of a good Shepheard.
                  But I vnderstand and set downe with my selfe,Signes of good Sheepe. that a good Farmer, to the end he
may haue a faire flocke of Sheepe, doth buy them vnshorne, not hauing a gray or
spotted Wooll partie-coloured, because of the vncertainetie of the colour. He shall
reiect as barren all such as haue teeth of moe than three yeares, and he shall make

Wooll of one colour, not diuersly coloured in anie part of his bodie, well horned, and
notwithstanding but small hornes, wrythen and turned backe rather than strait and
open, his tongue and palate white, to the end that the Lambes which he shall beget
may haue their

                     leeces all white: for if he should haue it all blacke, or else bespotted
with blacke vnder the tongue, howsoeuer he may be of a white Wooll, notwithstanding,
the Lambs which he shall ingender will haue mingled and spotted coats, either
with blacke or gray, and so by this meanes will become of lesse account and profit▪
Although the horned Ramme hath this discommoditie,A horned Ramme. that finding himselfe armed
by nature, he seeketh to doe nothing more than to fight, and is so much the more earnest
with the Sheepe, vrging them mightily thereunto: notwithstanding, he is much
better than one without hornes: for he knowing himselfe without hornes, is not so
readie to fight,The Ramme without hornes. and is also lesse hot by nature, according to the traditions of France:
but according to the experience of other Countries, the Ramme without hornes is
the best for breed,The best Ramme being best shaped, best woolled, and best mettalled, hauing
beene often seene to haue slaine with his bare head him that hath beene more than
extraordinarily armed, with great, spacious, and round twyned hornes. Besides,
the Ramme without hornes begetteth his young without anie danger to
the Ewe in her yeaning, whereas the Ramme which hath hornes, begetteth his
Lambes with such hornes, that the damme dieth oft before she be able to yeane it.

must haue made for them a long house, verie low, and sufficient wide. The situation

anie case fall, and that so the Rammes may not goe vnto the Ewes, nor the Lambes
vnto the diseased Sheepe. He shall be carefull to make his Ewes take Ramme after
the first two yeares, for the space of the next fiue after ensuing; for when the seuenth
yeare is once past, they begin to faile and wither away: and againe, the female taking
Ramme before she be two yeare old, bringeth forth a feeble and a weake brood,
without anie strength; but and if shee bring forth before that age, you must sell her
Lambes: The Ramme that is to blesome Ewes, must not be vnder three, nor aboue
eight: One Ramme will serue to blesome fiftie Ewes: The time most fit to couple
and put them together, is about the Winter Solstice, which is in the moneth of Nouember,
to the end that the Ewe which goeth with Lambe fiue moneths, may Lambe
in the Spring, in which time she shall find the grasse beginning to spring, and so shall

coupled together, you must giue them to drinke salt water; so the Ewe will hold better▪
and the Ramme will be the more lustie: but after that the Ewe is with Lambe,
you must not let her drinke anie such water, because it would cause her to Lambe before
her time. If the Farmer desire to haue manie Weather Lambes,To haue manie Lambes. it will be good,
according to the counsell of Aristotle. to obserue and spie out a drie time when the
Northerne wind bloweth, and then to cause the flock to feed, drawing directly vpon

otherwise might hurt the Lambe.The ordering of young Lambes. Afterward it shall be shut vp with the damme for
the two first daies after that it is lambed, to the end she may keepe it the warmer, and
it may the better learne to know her. In the meane time, care must be had to feed the
Ewe with the best Hay that may be found, and with a little

is mixed a little of the flower of Millet and of Salt: to draw from her her first

milke, because it is not good. And so soone as her Lambe shall begin to know her,
she may be let loose to goe feed in the fields; and to keepe the Lambe fast in a warme
and darke house, vntill such time as it begin to play the wanton: out of which house
it shall be let loose morning and euening to sucke the damme at her comming home
and going to the fields. And after that it shall be growne a little stronger, you shall
giue it, within house, some Bran, or verie small Hay, and that the best that is to be gotten,
to keepe it occupied with all the time that the damme is in field.
                  The wise Shepheard will not keepe,What Lambes are to be kept for the furnishing of the flock. for to store his flock, anie other Lambes than
such as are the grossest, most corpulent, &amp; strong, and which will well be able to hold
out Winter: and as for the rest, he will learne them the way to the Towne to seekes
new Master. He will be alwaies sure to keepe a good round number to vphold and
renew the losses that may fall by death or by sicknesse.
                  The wise Shepheard will not geld his Lambes till they be betwixt fiue and six
moneths old: and for to geld them,To geld Lambs. he shall vse the meanes set downe in the gelding
of Calues. In Winter hee shall fodder them with the best sheaues of Corne in the
Barne: and he shall rake together the scatterings which they make from time to time,
which after will serue for L

of Elmes, or else of the Ash tree, gathered in their season, or with Autumne Hay, or
the after-crop. The tree called Cytisus is good for them, if it may be found in this
cold Countrey, and being a thing so much desired and sought after of the Goats, as
they who by the vse thereof are made fruitfull in milke; so likewise is the Fetch:
notwithstanding, the straw of Pulse will be necessarie for them when they cannot
haue anie other thing, but that all other manner of Fodder is gone, and not to be come by.
                  As concerning the time when they are to be led forth to feeding,What time Sheepe should be carried to pasture. in Winter, Autumne,
and Spring time, you shall keepe them close in the morning, and you shal not
carrie them to the fields, vntil the day haue taken the frost away from off the ground:
for at these times the frozen grasse doth beget in them a rhewme and heauinesse of
the head, and looseneth their bellies. In Summer he shall carrie his flocke to the fresh
pasture by the point of day, when as the tender grasse is couered with the dew: and
toward noone he shall looke out either vaults and hollow places of the earth, or else
the couert and shadow of some thicket, to keepe his Cattell from the heat of the
Sunne: or else some old Oke, stretching forth his boughes: or the Forests and place

aboue the head, and is greatly offended by the Sunne, he shall be carefull in Summer,
during the great heat, to obserue when the Canicular daies begin, that so before
noone-tide he may draw his flocke to feed vpon the West, and after noone vpon the
East. For this is a thing of great moment, that the head of the Sheepe which are feeding,
be turned contrarie to the Sunne, which oftentimes hutteth that kind of Cattell,
at such time as the Canicular daies come in.

once a day, but in Summer twice, that is to say, foure houres after Sunne rise, and
at night, after the heat is rebated and well ouer-past.
                  The Shepheard shall order and gouerne them with great gentlenesse,A gentle Shepheard. as it is most
requisite for all Heards of whatsoeuer Cattell that it be, who must rather be and shew
themselues leaders and guides of their beasts, than lords. Guiding them to the field,
he must alwaies goe before them, to hinder and keepe them backe from running
into fields where they might feed vpon euill and hurtfull grasse: and especially

there are Thornes, Burres, and Thistles: for such doth nothing but make them itchie
and scuruie, and to lose their Wooll. Also it is not so good fodder, nor so good
feeding, which for long time hath been in continuall vse: for so the Cattell will grow
wearie of it, and offended therewith, except the prudent Shepheard vse some remedie
against it, by mingling some salt amongst it, or sprinkle it with brine or dregs of
oyle vpon some floure, and so with their meat he should giue them both sawce and

then forthwith the Farmer shall cause the same dung to be carried vnto the leanest
parts of his land, and shall leaue it there on hillocks to drie in the heat of the Summer
vntill October, and then to cause it to be spread vpon the ground▪ or else to mingle it
with Marle, to dung and manure the earth: howbeit, Marle must not be reiterated so
oft as dung, for which cause he must vse such discretion, as that he must not lay anie
Marle but from fiue yeares to fiue yeares in anie place. It will be good after that the
Sheepe-cote is made cleane, to perfume it with Womens haire, or Harts horne, or the
hornes of Goats clawes, thereby to driue away Adders and Snakes, and other beasts,

you can: hereupon, the beast will presently faint, but come vnto himself againe

Swine in respect of the filthinesse thereof, and stinking of the dung. But for the better
preuenting thereof, it hath beene deuised and thought good oftentimes to perfume

grounds, being either fertile or hard, and haue their preseruation either for breed
or the shambles, and the field sheepe are those which are kept on the tylth or sallow
fields, or else vpon open and wast commons, and are preserued either for breed or the

manuring of arable ground, and those sheepe which are to walke vpon the fallow
fields, you shall put to the Ramme rather before than after Michaelmas, that their
Lambes may haue strength before May day to follow their dammes ouer the clots
and rough grounds, and your pasture sheepe you shall put to the Rammes not before
S. Lukes day that the dammes may haue full bit and strength of grasse to feed vp
and fatten their Lambes quickly, for the choyce of your sheepe for any of these soiles,
you shall take such as agree with the leare and colour of your earth, rather bringing
them from a worse soyle to a better, than from a good soyle to a bad; knowing withall
that your fat earth though it beare a great sheepe, and much burthen of vvooll,
yet it is but course, and your barren earths, though it beare but a small sheepe, and
smaller burthen of wooll, yet if the leare be right, the vvooll will be finest and deerest,
except the soyle be verie much cold, or verie much moist, and then the staple
will be but hairie, as may be seene in the Northerne and lesse fruitfull Countries.
Now for the leares of sheepe, you shall vnderstand that the browne hazell leare is
of all other the best, the redd leare next to it, the yellow leare next to the redd, and
the dunne dyrtie leare of all other the worst, and least profitable, all manner of sand
grounds yeeld good leares, so doe most of your mixt earths, your clays, if not too wet,

profitable both to the sheares and the shambles, being commonly of good bone,

coat, yet it is so light that he cannot be held much commodious to either.

to be found, where they haue not the commoditie and benefit of any
greater cattell than the Goat, and of this they can make milke meats,
much Butter, and more wholesome than that of the sheepe, as other
things also accompanying thesame, the wooll and skin onely excepted, of which
notwithstanding they make Chamlet in Turkie,Chamlet made of Goats haire. and as for their young ones, they
are sold in their season, and make as good meat as any that can be found. And this

the most part of a more solide meat than the Weather, and climeth into higher places,

doe yeeld more milke, yet the reddish coloured and blacke are more pleasant, frolicke,

haue no hornes, doe not cast their young so soone, and they doe keepe more conueniently

                  The male goat is much to be esteemed if he be not aboue fiue yeare old (for in respect
of his heat,The male goat. which is exceeding great, he doth easily grow old:) which hath a
great bodie, grosse legges, a thicke and short necke, hanging and great eares, a small
head, blacke haire, thicke, neat, and long, without hornes; for such as haue hornes, by
reason of their pushing and eagernesse, are dangerous: which hath likewise vnder his
chaps two bearded knobs or kernels.

milke in any great quantitie, for the milke of goats hath no such store of fat or oilie
substance in it, seeing there is alwaies much adoe to get forth euen some small portion;
and yet, which is more, when it is out, it looketh whitish, hard, and tasteth like
tallow: and thirdly, because in Languedoe and Prouence, they gather not any Butter
at all, being giuen to make Cheese, namely those Cheeses which are called small
Cheeses.
                  As concerning the diseases of a Goat,The goat is neuer without an ague. she is neuer without an ague in this Countrie,
and that in such sort, as that if they be free from it but a little, they die: besides
the diseases of sheepe, whereunto Goats are subject, there are three other, whereunto
the Goat is subject, that is to say, the dropsie, swelling after she hath brought
forth her young,The diseases of goats. and the drie disease. The dropsie happeneth vnto her by
drinking too much vvater, and then you must make incision vnder the shoulder,
and draw forth all the gathered superfluous moisture, and after heale the wound

be not vvell purged of her after-birth, you must cause her to drinke a great glasse ful
of verie good wine.The drie disease The drie disease commeth vpon her in the time of hot seasons,
as wherein her teats are so dried vp, as that they are like vnto wood for drinesse, and
in such case you must rubbe her teats with creame: and as for other her diseases,
you must cure them with those remedies vvhich are set downe for the diseases of
ewes.
                  The good huswife that setteth by the health of her folke,The flesh of goats. shall not giue any goats
flesh vnto her people to eat, except it be in time of great dearth and scarcitie, because
the eating of this flesh doth breed the falling sicknesse. Likewise our predecessours
had the flesh in such a loathed detestation, as that they would not deine to
touch it, no not name it: notwithstanding if necessitie doe force vs to feed vpon it,
as many poore peasants dwelling in villages doe (hauing good store of goats, and
which onely are the store of their powdring tubs, as also being persuaded thereto
through couetousnesse) then they must boyle them in a pot not couered, and
in great quantitie of vvater, with good store of spices and cloues, and yet after all
this, not to eat it before it be cold, she may gather some profitable thing both of the
male and female goat for the health of her familie:Goats milke. For the milke of the female is verie
singular for the hardnesse of the spleene, if so be that she haue beene fed any space

are for the keeping of the house and cattell, and reserue the hunting dogge for to
intreat of in our seuenth Booke, vvhere I intend to speake a vvord or two of
hunting.
                  
                     
The dogge appointed for the keeping of the Farme,The qualities of a watch-dogge. must be of grosse and great
corpulencie, hauing his bodie well and square compact, and rather short than long.
Let his head be so great and thicke, as that it may shew to be the greatest part of his
bodie, his countenance somewhat resembling a mans, his throat great and wide, thick
and great lips hollowed after the manner of valleys, his necke thicke and short, his
eares great and hanging, his eyes blacke or Azure, fierie, and sparkling, his breast
broad, and full of haire, his taile short and thicke, which is a marke of strength, for
the long and small taile is onely a signe of swiftnesse, his foot and nailes great, his
barke base, loud, and fearefull, he must be reasonably fierce, for the gentle doggs doe
faune vpon theeues, and the ouer-fierce would not let to leape in the bosome of your
familiar friends, and seruants: especially let him be watchfull, &amp; keeping good guard,
not a rouer, running hither and thither, but soone satisfied and stayed, rather than
actiue and busily gadding,The best colours of Mastiues. he must also be blacke, to the end he may be more terrible
vnto the thiefe by day, and not so well perceiued of him by night; or if he be blew,
brended, or a darke fallow, not any of these colours are amisse, but shew much
strength, valor, and fiercenesse, and are commonly the best breeds of all others, as is
to be seene in England, from whence France hath beene onely inriched with all her
chiefest Mastiues.
                  The Shepheards dogge needs not,The qualitie of the Shepheards dogge. nor must not, be so great and heauie as that of
the Farme, and yet notwithstanding he must be strong and lustie, and somewhat readie
and light: for he is vsed both for fighting and running; intended, that he must
watch and hunt away the Wolues, and if they should carrie anie thing away, then to
pursue them, and take it from them: Wherefore in this respect it were better that
he should be long made rather than short and square, seeing euerie beast of a long
bodie is more fit for the race, than that which hath a short and square bodie. He
must be of a white colour, that so the Shepheard may more easily discerne him from
amongst the Wolues, and know him as well in the twylight, as also in the very darkest
time of the same. If he be in the rest of his limmes like vnto the house dogge, he
cannot chuse but be a good one.The meat fit for dogges. Both these sorts of dogges are fed with like meat, as
with Wheaten bread, the flower of Barley with Whay, warme broth, and sodden
Beanes.The time for dogs and bitches to engender. The Shepheard which hath this charge, shall not let either Dogge or Bitch
engender before they be a yeare old, and not after that they be ten yeares old. He shal
take from the Bitch her first litter, for being young and newly acquainted with such
matters, she should not feed and nourish them well; and againe, such her feeding of
them would hinder her in her grouth euerie manner of way: as also, the dogge of the
first litter is of a feeble and weake condition, and for the most part subject to runne
madd. Sixe moneths after the Bitch hath whelped, he shall not suffer the Whelpes
to goe forth, vntill such time as they become strong, except it be onely to play and
sport themselues with their damme, for feare that in attempting to leape hedge or
ditch,The ordering of Whelpes. they doe not burst and beat out their guts. He shall not let them sucke any other
milke but that of their owne Bitch, and if it happen that she want and haue not
ynough, they shall haue Goats milke giuen them vntill they be foure moneths old:
he shall not call them by verie long name,The names of dogges. that so assoone as they be called they may
know that they are called. And againe, it is not good that their name should be of
lesse than two syllables.A sinew in the tailes of dogges. When these Whelpes are fortie daies old, he shall breake
the tip of their taile, and shall draw out a sinew that runneth along the joynts of the
backe, euen vnto the end of the taile, this will keepe them from growing too much
in length,To make himselfe followed of dogges. and will also be a meanes to keepe them from running madd. He shall
make his dogges come after him, and the meanes to doe it (as some say) is to giue
them now and then some boyled froggs to eat; or to make it more sure to giue them
bruised Salt,The way to keepe dogs from running at you. or else to cast them a peece of bread, which he hath kept a good while
vnder his arme-pits, in such sort as that it be a little moystened with the sweat of
them, or else to let them smell the after-birth of another Bitch, which he shall haue
wrapped vp in a cloth. Likewise he shall learne some peece of cunning to make that
he may not be barked at, nor set vpon by other dogges how raging soeuer they be.
                  
                     
And to effect this, he shall hold in his hand the eye of a blacke dogge pulled from
him aliue, or for the more certaintie, the eye or the heart of a Wolfe, or the tongue
of a she Wolfe.To make dogs fight. He shall incense them to fight the one with the other, by clapping
his hands, and yet he shall beware that neither of them be ouercome▪ for making of
him timerous and dastardly.Dogs may not

very hardly and with much adoe vvill they be made to forsake this fault, if once they
haue begun to eat raw flesh. He shall frame them in their youth to bring, and the
better to teach them so to doe, he shall first cast a prettie way from him a peece of
bread. He shall be carefull to heale them when they be sicke. They are subject

                  CHAP. XXVIII.
                  Of the Carter, on Horse-keeper.
                  
                     WE haue heretofore spoken of such liuing creatures as are for the profit and
vse of men inhabiting Countrie villages: in that which followeth we
will speake of those which serue not onely for men inhabiting the said
villages, but also for them which inhabite and dwell in Cities and great
Townes, as are the Horse, the Mule, and the Asse. I set the Horse before the rest, as
being seruiceable for the Peasant and Countrie-drudge, and also affording great seruices
to Nobles, Princes, Prelates, and to be short, to all sorts of men, as being the
beast which is peerelesse, for his comelinesse, beautie, courage, furniture, profit, and
commoditie.
                  Therefore (I say) let the Carter or Horse-keeper, to whom appertayneth the
charge of Countrie horse, be a sober and patient man, louing his beasts well, and neuer
beating them: but well may he acquaint them with the lash, the whisking noise
of his rod, with his speech, and with his cal: let them not at any time labor more than
they well may, either in draught or trauell, let him currie them cherefully and merrily
euerie morning, and in Sommer sometimes after noone: he must not giue them
to drinke but at ordinarie houres, and after their rest, let him oftentimes vse to wash
their feet in Sommer with cold water, and sometime with wine, or the lees of wine
for to strengthen them withall, and with vrine if they be dulled or blunted, in the
night time putting of their owne dung in the hollow or sole of their hoofe: and if
they be chafed or heated, or put out of the loue and desire of their meat, he must wash
their throat with Vinegar and Salt: let him not giue them Hay, Prouender, Chaffe,
Oats,A farmer must know the worke and trade of a fadler and farrier. or Litter, before they be verie well dusted: he must not let them goe without
shooes or nailes: and let him be carefull that their traise, cart-saddles, collars, bridles,
or other parts of their geares, and harnesse, be not torne, or rent, or rotten. He must also
know to sow with small threed, packthreed, and shoothreed, to stuffe and make
fast his saddles: to be short, he must be acquainted with the Sadlers trade, as also with
the Farriers, and therefore he must neuer be vnprouided of his budget and pouch
furnisht with tooles and necessaries about harnesse and saddles, nor yet of his yron
stuffe for his beasts feet: as namely needle threed and silke,

                     eame to let bloud with,
knife to launce and cut with, corner, buttrys, pincers, hammer, paring-yron, and rape,
he must also haue barnacles, pasternes, trauerses, and colling-sheares, with whatsoeuer
else is needfull to be vsed in any time of occasion or necessitie. He must be verie
carefull to find out the cause vvhen he seeth any one of his Horses halt, of what
foot it is, and in vvhat place of the foot being handled or tried, he most complayneth
himselfe, and to put about his pasternes sometimes Spech-grase, and sometimes
dung.
                  He must also take great heed when his beast doe cast the old hoofe,The casting of hooues. and haue a
new growing, and cause some thing to be giuen him for the helpe of the growth of
the new hoofe, and vvhen he hath his throat heated to cause him to be couered, if
therewith he haue the cough: and if in trauaile he haue taken cold by raine or tedious
vveather, to giue him then to eat some Fenugreeke or Anise-seed amongst
his prouender: to change him vvhen he is past age: and also to take acknowledgement
of the loue that one Horse beareth towards another, and accordingly
to set them one by another in the Stable appointed for them,To make clean

morning may cleane in Sommer, carrying out the dung and filth, and letting none
remaine, and at night giue them fresh Litter. He must also cast an eye about, and see
whether his horses doe grow leane or no, and then to fat them with Fetches boyled in
water, and mixed amongst their Oats, as also with millet, pannicke, rice, sodden and
mingled with meale of Beanes, and a little Salt; or where these are missing, to take

good sweet Barley chaffe, or Pease pulse well mixt with some drie Beanes, and to
giue him thereof good store after euerie watering, or vvhen he newly commeth
from his labour; as for sodden Barley, or other boyled corne, they are onely good to
loosen the skinne, but the fat which they gather is neuer of any indurance. He must
be content to take vp his lodging in the stable, for feare of their falling sicke, intangling
themselues in their halters, and growing of his beasts, and let him be carefull and
wise in ordering and placing his light in such sort, as that it may be out of daunger,
and to locke vp and keepe his harnesse well, and made readie ouer night

                     ,
and reserue them for some other labour: and if any of his Horses fall sicke, if it be
not of wearinesse, dulnesse, or chafing, he must put him out from among the rest.
If he haue any Horse that hath ill propertie or fault,The faults of Horses. he shall be carefull how to amend
it, as if he be fearefull or timerous, or if he will not abide while one getteth vpon

vpon his backe, he rise and come aloft, he shall hit him with his rod vpon the forelegges:
if he lye downe, he must be raised vp againe with rough words and strokes:
if he goe backward, you shall tye a cord to his codds, vvhich shall be so long, as th

when as the Horse shall goe backward,A Horse going backward. he shall pull it hard with his hand to make
him goe forward, for so vvithout all doubt he will goe forthright, and amend his
fault: if the Horse be gelded, he must beat his thighs vvith a long staffe taken out of
the fire verie hot, and burnt at the end: or he shall giue him feele of his whisking
rodd betwixt his eares: if the Horse be hard to shooe, and troublesome to handle
and dresse in the stable, he shall put in one or both of his eares a little round pebble,
and there make it sure with one or both his hands, and keepe them in his eares, and
thus he shall make him as gentle and meeke as a Lambe.
                  It is also the Carters part to gouerne his heard of Mares and Colts carefully, th

no inconuenience may befall them: he shall put them to feed, and shall send the
                        •
                     
to grasse when it shall be due time, and that in large and marish grounds. Notwithstanding
marish ground doth soften their hoofe verie much, and maketh them tender
sighted, and begetteth water in their feet: and for this cause I could like the
high and hillie grounds better, being such as from time to time haue raine or 
                        〈◊〉

and free, than incombred with vvood or other bodies of trees or legges: and yet further,
hauing a soft and sweet grasse, rather than a high, great, and strong grasse. And
notwithstanding that Mares be not so frolicke nor couragious as Horses be, yet
they goe beyond them farre in the race, and stand it out a great deale longer; and
againe, they are not so chargeable to keepe as Horses are, for they are not fed with
the best hay, they content themselues to run in pastures all the yeare long: true it is,
that in Winter, and when the ground is all couered with snow, as also in the time of
continuall raine, they must be put in some one house or other, and giue them such
Hay as is good to eat, and in Sommer to keepe them in some good coole shadow

to the end, that at the same time that the Mares were couered and horsed, they may
easily feed their Colts, hauing tender and soft grasse after Haruest: for about the end
of the eleuenth or twelfth moneth they foale, and so their milke is the faster, better
conditioned, begetteth also and nourisheth fairer Colts, and such as thriue euen as
we our selues would wish. The Stalions also thus attended are the stronger, and doe
more abound with a well concocted and slimie nature, and not with a thinne and
waterie, and withall, they couer them with more courage, and beget greater Colts,
and such as are more hardie and strong.The signes of the Mares being readie to take Horse. He shall know that the Mares are readie to
take Horse, when they yeeld a whitish humor at the place of generation, and that
their priuie parts are more swolne than they were wont to be, as also more hot than
ordinarie, and eat not so much as they were wont. He shall let her take Horse twice
a day, euening and morning, before he let her drinke; and this shall be continued
but tenne daies: which past, if she refuse him, he shall put her aside as with foale, and
shall take away the Horse, least with his furious rage he make her that she doe not
conceiue.
                  The Horse that is lesse than three yeares old,A Horse to couer Mares. is not fit to couer Mares, but he may
continue good till he be twentie yeare old. The Mare is fit to take Horse when she
is two yeares old, that so being three by her foaling time, she may be able to feed
it well: but she is nothing worth for this purpose after she is once tenne yeares old:
for Horses begotten of an old Mare are loose and heauie. One good Horse is ynough
for twentie Mares: which, at such time as he is to couer them, must be well fed, and
when the time approcheth, must be fatted with Barly, Fetches, and Ciches, to the end
he may the better serue for the purpose: for the stronger and more disposed he shall
be to couer them, the stronger will the Colts be which he begetteth. If he haue no
courage, but be feeble and out of heart, you must rub the secret parts of the Mare
with a new and cleane spunge, and after rub the muzzle of the stalion with the same:
If the Mare will not admit the Horse, you must bruise a Sea-Onion, and rub her secret
part therewith, for this will warme her: And to haue a Horse of the colour that
you would desire, couer the Mare with a couering of the same colour, at such time as
the Horse shall couer her.
                  The Mare whereof we desire to haue a good race,A Mare for breed. must not be vnder two yeares
old, as hath beene said, nor aboue tenne or twelue; and vnderstand withall, that being
of a colder complexion than Horses, so she faileth before them in that worke:
she must be well made of bodie, broad spread toward one, hauing a comely and pleasant
looke, her flanke and rumpe large, well fed, but a little leane, to the end that she
may hold her horsing the better: that she haue not trauelled of a long time: that
she beare not but euerie two yeares, to the end she may the better feed her Colt.
When she is with Colt, you must feed her well, you must not trauell or runne her,
nor leaue her to the extremitie of the Cold, but keepe her in house when it raineth
and snoweth, and as long as anie great cold weather is, that so she may the better
bring forth a perfect Colt.The Marereadie to foale If the Mare be in foaling, or that she hath cast her Colt,
you must bruise Polipodie, and mingling it with warme water, cause her to drinke
it with a horne.The Mare that doth foale. If she haue foaled well, you may not touch her Colt with your hand,
for and if you touch it neuer so little, you hurt it. So soone as she hath foaled in the
house, you must succour her with drinks of warme water, mingling salt therewith and
meale also both euening and morning, for the space of three daies at the least: after
this, you must giue her good Hay and sufficient Corne, keepe her cleane with good
Litter, that so she may rest at ease; for this her good feeding doth cause her Colt to
prosper, and strengtheneth it.
                  After that the Colt is foaled,To order a

place, to the end that cold may not hurt it, neither yet the Mare, by reason of the
straitnesse of the place: and when it shall be stronger, it shall be accustomed to
eat Hay, to the end that the dams milke failing, it may haue learned to feed vpon a
firmer nourishment: but it shall be let run with the Mare in the pasture, that so she
may not mourne for lacke of the sight of her Colt: for commonly Mares are sicke for

the loue of their colts, if they cannot see them. When it shall be eighteene moneths
old, you shall begin to waine it, and put it in the house built for col

that so it may not feele any hard thing to annoy it: and if it will not abide to be tied,
you must make it fast with two thongs of leather or of hempe, or with a bridle

the manger, that so it may be acquainted with touching and handling, and that so
also it may learne not to be afraid of any noise that shall be made: it vvill be good
also to set it amongst others that are alreadie tamed, for seeing them so haltred, it
will at length accustome it selfe to subjection: as yet you must speake it faire, and
touch it with your hand, sometimes rubbing the backe, head, or bellie, and
sometimes the numpe, legges, and feet, sometimes raising it vp, making it cleane,
and rubbing it verie mildly and gently; to be short, making so much of it, as vntill
it become so tame that it know the boy or horseman that currieth it, and the rider
that must backe it, and vvithall vnderstand their vvords and voyces, and smelling
him, to know him before he get vpon him: sometimes you shall set a child vpon
the backe, to the end he may learne to endure to beare one; giue it good hay and
good grasse: lead it to water with one alreadie managed and fitted to the hand: after
it hath drunke, giue it Oats, at euening straw it with litter vp to the knees, and in
the morning rubbe the legges and the whole bodie with the same litter, and after lead
it to drinke. When it is three yeares old, you must breake and acquaint and fit it for
such worke as you shall thinke meet. As for example, if you would appoint it and
make it serue you sometimes to take a journey vpon, I could wish you to giue it a
burning with fire vpon the legges:To burne the colt with a hot yron. and this you shall commit to the doing of some
skilfull Farrier, especially in the Spring, Autumne, and decrease of the Moone, and
at such time as these young horse are full two yeares old: and this must be done as
wel in the legs before as behind: such course of burning doth harden and strengthen
their loose flesh, being soft and not close set together, it doth bring downe that which
is puffed vp: it drieth that which hath much moisture in it: it dissolueth that which
is gathered together, it burneth away and wasteth rottennesse if there be any, and
healeth old aches, curing and restoring the declined parts of the bodie, lessening that
which is growne too great, and not suffering it to grow any further. Add hereunto,
that the scabbe, farcie, and other malanders accustomed to seise vpon their leggs, cannot
haue the power to breed vpon them. After you haue thus burnt them with a
knobd hot yron, carrie them to pasture, and that at such an houre, as when the deaw
is vpon the grasse: for so it will doe them a great deale more good than any thing
that a man can giue vnto them in the stable, for so also you shall cause that 
                        〈◊〉
                     
of the burnings shall appeare lesse, and that if they shew at all, that yet it shall be with
good setting out of the legge.
                  As for that retained opinion amongst our Frenchmen, that the slitting of a horses
nosthrils when they are full growne, will make them fit for the course or race, as being
an occasion of more libertie to his wind, or that it will helpe a broken winded

how or which way the Rider pleaseth: then they shall ride gently home, and there
light neere vnto the Stable dore, and so set vp the Colt, cloth him, dresse, and feed
him. Then the third day the Rider shall take the Colts back at the Stable dore, and
the Groome his Geldings back, and so ride forth into some plaine High way▪ the
smoother the better, the Gelding leading the way to the Colt, and let them so ride
straight forth-right at least two myles or more, stopping sundrie times, and cherishing

Colt, dresse him, and feed him: And thus if you doe twice or thrice in this third
day, it shall be so much the better. The fourth day the Rider shall take out the
Colt, and the Groome the Gelding, but the Colt shall then lead the way, and the
Gelding shall follow, onely now and then, to giue the Colt encouragement, the
Gelding shall come and ride vp to the face of the Colt, and then eftsoones fall back
behind him againe. This day you shall, in a large spacious compasse, trot the Colt
round, first on the one hand, then on the other, making him bend and come about,
according to the bowing of your bodie, or the turning in of your hand, and in euerie
motion make your selfe master of whatsoeuer he doth, giuing him a true vnderstanding,
that what he doth, is your will, and not his pleasure: and withall, by no meanes
forgetting to cherish him when he doth well; not after, but euen in the instant and
presentnesse of time, when he performeth your pleasure, that he may thereby know
why he is rewarded with kindnesse: and in like manner, when he doth anie thing
contrarie to your will, you shall chastise him with the threatening of your voice, and
sometimes with the noise and shake of your rod, or when extremitie vrgeth, with a
good lash or two with your rod vnder his bellie, in the very selfe-same instant that he
offendeth. And when the Colt hath performed all things answerable to your liking,
you shall returne home, not the same way that you came forth, but, if conueniently
you can, some other way, thereby to breed in the Colt an ignorance of his owne ease:
which is the onely meanes to preserue and keepe him from restyuenesse, and other
wicked qualities. And being come to the Stable dore, you shall there alight, and cherish
him, and then set him vp, dresse him, and feed him. And this you shall doe at
least thrice in this fourth day. The fifth day hauing sadled, bridled, and girded him
as he had beene accustomed, he shall lead him to the place of getting vp▪ and there
shall get vpon him, lead him through all manner of Waies, sometimes trotting, sometimes
softly, vntill he begin to wax hot: And this order shall be obserued euerie day,
yet still encreasing his exercise, making him goe and trot so long as vntill he be wearie;
this being the best way to make him lift his legges, and to carrie himselfe handsomely
in the rest of his parts: not failing thereupon to bring him backe verie softly
vnto the Stable, where he shall walke him vntill such time as he leaue sweating, and
then he shall set him vp in his place. Yet of the later and more experiencest Horsmen
it is thought good not to walke him at all, but presently to set him vp,Walking Horses not good. cloth him well,
and giue him litter ynough, with found and drie rubbing: for it is an infallible experiment,
that the walking of Horses in the hand is the readiest way to giue Colds, and
breed Feuers, because then the humors coole too suddenly; and the vitall parts leauing
(as it were) their motions in an instant, the heart and other inward parts receiue the
cold aire so vnprouided and vnarmed, that wanting the assistance of their other seruants,
which is action and spirit, they are ouercome, and yeeld to the arrest of dulnesse
and numbnesse: Therefore it is held best not to walke at all, but rather to house the
Horse, and with rubbing, fretting, clawing, &amp; picking, to keepe the ouer-heated parts
warme, till they may coole by a moderate temper: and this questionlesse is the safest
course for a Horse that is extreamly heated, as the English hunting and running Horses

                     ure the same: for you shall vnderstand, that a Horse is, as a man, fearefull and
vigilant of his way, and when the sight thereof is taken from him, all his pores
and vitall spirits are awakened and stirred vp to preuent the dangers that may
happen vnto him: so that when all courses else shall faile, yet this is most assured.

bring him thereunto, there are but onely two wayes, that is to say, either the Tra

or the Hand; the betterhood of which▪ I leaue to your consideration, when
your experience hath made triall of them both, and done to neither injurie, but vsed
them carefully, artificially, and according to the truth of the rules prescribed. To
giue you then a little light what the Tramell is, you shall vnderstand, that it is
called a Tramell when a Horses neere fore-legge and his neere hinder-legge, two
handfull aboue the pasterne ioynts, are so fastened together with leathers and
cords, that he cannot put forward his fore-legge, but he must perforce hale his
hinder-legge after it, and so likewise his farre fore-legge to his farre hinderlegge,
and then another flat and soft leather going ouer the fillets of the Horses
backe, and fastened to both the lynes on both sides the Horse; which piece of leather
shall hold vp the lynes, that they fall not nor tangle vnder the Horses feet as he
goeth. This is called the tramelling of a Horse: and with these you shall first in
your hand make him goe softly or swiftly at your pleasure; and when you find
that he will take his way perfectly in them, without danger of falling, then you
shall take his backe, and ride him thus in the tramels the space of a weeke in some
faire, plaine, and smooth Way or Roade: then the next weeke following you shall
ride him in vneuen wayes, ouer layes, vp hill and downe hill, and in such like
vncertaine places: then the next weeke you shall take off the tramels of one side,
and fasten the backe band to the saddle, and to ride him for a day or two: then
put on that tramell againe, and take off the other which was on before▪ and so ride
him another day or two: then take both cleane away, and so ride him and keepe
him to his pace; which he will hardly or neuer forsake, if you haue anie care at
all. Now for the speciall respects which are to be obserued in the tramelling of
Horses, you shall first obserue, that the leathers which goe about the Horses legges
be soft, smooth, and well lyned, neither so strait, that they may offend the maine sinewes
of the legges, nor so slacke, that they may fall off: the buckles with which you
make them longer or shorter, must be verie strong also, that they may abide the twitches
and straines of the Horse, when at anie time he striketh a false stroake: the lynes
which passe betweene these leathers, must be a good round rope made of strong
Hemp
                        •
                      well twound, with a loope at either end whereto to fixe the leathers; and these
lynes must be both of a iust and euen length, not one exceeding another a strawes
breadth, they must be so fixed to the Horses legges, that they must by no meanes either
draw them inward, or giue them libertie to stradle outward, but so, as they may
keepe the Horse in his true, iust, and naturall proportion. Now if your Horse strike
too short, then you shall straiten your lynes halfe an inch at least, for that will make
him ouerstrike halfe a foot, and a whole inch a whole foot: and so of the contrary part
if he ouerstrike, you shall let forth your tramell in the same maner that you 
                        •
                     ooke it in.

There be some that will put on these tramels, and make the Horse runne an

and carrying his feet neere vnto the ground, swoopeth away swiftly, nimbly, and
easily: and this kind of gallop is meet for hunting Horses, running Horses, or
Horses preferred onely for labour and trauell. Now to bring a Horse to gallop
aloft, which is the first kind of galloping spoken of, you shall daily vse to gallop
him as his first riding on new-plowed lands, which are deepe, yet lye flat: and
withall, you shall euer obserue to keepe a strait hand vpon his head,

                     ,

but the flower the better; euer and anon with your hand, rod▪ and spurre raising vp
his bodie, and making him gather his feet vp roundly together: for it is the pride of
his reine, and the flownesse of the gallop, which brings him to the gallantrie and loftinesse
of the motion. Now, for the other kind of galloping you shall vse a cleane
contrarie course, that is to say, you shall traine your Horse vpon the plainest and
smoothest ground you can find, you shall giue him libertie of reine, that hee may
stretch forth his bodie and legges, and lay himselfe close to the ground like a Har
                        •
                     
or a Greyhound: and this exercise you shall giue your Horse morning and euening
after his water, for then it is most wholesome, and he the aptest to learne and doe as
you would haue him. Also it shall be good for you now and then to put him to the
height of his speed: for the more you straine him, the more he coucheth his bodie,
and the lesse distance euer hee taketh his feet from the ground: to follow the
Hounds all the day twice or thrice a weeke: or to giue him a course once a weeke of
foure or fiue myles end-wayes, are both verie good waies of training a Horse to this
swift gallop: because that length of exercise taketh the fire edge from a Horse, and
maketh him more temperate and sober in his doings; whereas the heat and excesse
of his courage maketh him praunce and doe things rashly and loftily. Manie other
obseruations there be, but these few before rehearsed are fully sufficient to bring a
Horse to anie pace the Rider pleaseth.

likewise, and his eares become cold: you must presently prouide to helpe him, in
taking away the Auiues after this manner: Bend downe the eare betwixt his necke
and his chyne, make incision with a knife for the purpose along vpon the hard
fleshinesse, which one would say to be nothing but a verie whitesinew: plucke away
the white carnositie or fleshie substance: lay to the place as well within as without,
a linnen cloth dipt in the white of an egge, couer the horse by and by vvith a
good couering, and vvalke him so long as vntill that his eares become warme, giuing
him a drinke made with water, salt, and meale, but first causing him to eat a
little good Hay: let him rest three daies in the stable, and eat and drinke there: or
else make him hot fomentations, and those of such things as are proper in that case, to
be applied vnto the part, for to remoue the humour, afterward applie a cataplasme
made of Barley meale, and three ounces of Rosin, all boyled in due sort in good
strong red wine; and when the matter shall be gathered and readie for suppuration,
giue it a gash with a knife, to let the suppurated and ripe matter out, afterward put in
the hollow place tents wet in water, oyle, and salt, with bolsters layd vpon them and
dipt in the same. This disease craueth a speedie remedie, for and if you stay till the
Auiues be gotten vp higher, it is past hope of curing.

let him bloud againe the second day on the other side of the necke: let him stand

                  Now for as much as to know medicines for diseases is to little or no purpose,To know diseases by their signes. except
a man know the disease, I vvill here in a briefe manner shew you the signes
of all the most generall and hidden infirmities that are in horses, therefore first to begin
vvith the outward parts: that you may know where the griefe is vvhen at any
time a horse halteth, you shall note these few obseruations following, first if he 
                        〈◊〉
                     
before, and 
                        〈◊〉
                      but his Toe to the ground, it is most certaine that the greiefe is in his
hoofe; but if vvhen he halteth, he bend not his pasterne, then be you vvell assured
the griefe lyeth in the joynt: If he halt more vvhen you turne him than when he goeth
right forward, or forbeareth his foot more in the turning than in going, then the
griefe questionlesse is in the shoulder or the thigh; or if vvhen he standeth still he
setteth one foot a good deale more forward than the other, the griefe is then in the
shoulder or vpper parts also, as, in the Knee or Knuckle of the Elbow: If he goe
bowing to the ground, and tread his steps verie thicke, the griefe is in the brest: 
                        〈◊〉
                     
he halt behind and in his gate set but his Toe to the ground, the griefe is in the foot,
or in the sti
                        •
                     le; but if he refuse of touch the ground at all, then the griefe is in the
Buttocke. Now to know whereof these griefes doe proceed, you shall vnderstand
that if the griefe proceed of a hot cause, then he most halteth when he trauelleth, or is
chafed, and the further he goes, the worse and worse he goes: but if it proceed of a
cold cause, then he halteth most when he rests or stands still, and at his first going out
out of a journey, but after a little chafing he goeth vpright againe. Now if the horses
halt be secret, and as it were halfe vnperce
                        ••
                     able, insomuch that you are incertaine
vvhether he halteth yea or no, you shall suffer him to runne at the vttermost
length of his halter, vvithout any stay or ease of your hand, and then without doubt
if he haue any hidden maladie or griefe whatsoeuer, he will easily discouer it: and
thus much for the signes of griefes in the outward parts.Signes of inward griefes. Now for the signes of griefes
in the inward parts, you shall obserue, that if your horse be slower in labour, or duller
of the spurre, or shorter breathed, or if his eares hang downe more than they were
wont, of his haire stare, if his flanke be more hollow, if he burne or glow betwixt the
eares, if he refuse his meat, or if his mouth be drie and clammie in his trauell, all these
are generall signes of inward sicknesse: If a horse hold his head downe in the Manger,
be heauie and dimme sighted, it is a signe of a Feauer, headach, hear

                  If a Horse turne his head backe, and looke to his bodie as to the place grieued, it is
signe of obstructions in the Liuer, especially when he looketh to the right side, but
if he looke further, as to his bellie, then it is a signe of Wormes or Colicke; when
thin vvater runneth from his mouth, it is a signe of Staggers, or a vvet Cough▪

                  Of the Mule-keeper.
                  
                     A Good House-holder must not be vnfurnished of things necessarie for his
House, whether they serue for food and sustenance, or for ease. Wherefore
although in respect of some manner of worke he may be content to want
Mules, hauing the benefit of Horse to carrie him to the Market and other

                        •

Horses, because of their easier pacing; or that, by reason of age, or want of health of

                     odie, he cannot endure the trauell of a Horse, but is constrained to prouide a
Horse-litter to carrie him in.The Mules of Auernia. I will further say, that in some places, as in Auernia,

                        •
                     hat for the scarcitie and small number of Horse and Oxen, the Mules are esteemed
of great value, and are vsed to toile the earth, to trauaile, and doe other necessarie

                        •
                     hings tending to the commoditie and maintenance of the House; to say nothing

                        •
                     hat Mules are proper Beasts, strong and able to carrie great and heauie burthens, as
Trunkes, sackes of Corne and Meale, and such other burthens which Horses could

                        •
                     ot beare.
                  The ordering and charge of Mules is like vnto that of Horses, as well in respect
of their meat, pasture, feeding, and furniture, as in the curing of their diseases, whereunto
they are subiect: and therefore wee will knit vp in 
                        •
                     ewer words what may be said
of them, both for the causes rehearsed, as also for that I willingly leaue the whole
knowledge of their feeding and handling to those of Auernia, amongst whom they
are in such high request. Notwithstanding, to speake summarily, the Mule-keeper
must not onely be carefull of the well-feeding of his Mules, but also of making of
the most profit of them. The profit that may be raised of them, consisteth in the verie
same commodities that may be raised of the Asse, and that is principally of goodly
Herds and Flocks. Hence he shall chuse a good and goodly beautifull male Mule,
Asse, or Horse, and likewise a female, Mare, or she Asse, for the saddle: for if both of
them happen not to fit the turne, and be well conditioned, yet that which doth, cannot
be but valiant and couragious:The diuers maners of the engendring of male and female Mules. And although that male and female Mules be
engendred either of the male Asse and the Mare, or of the Horse and female Asse,
yet those are the best which come of the Asse and the Mare: for those which come
of the Horse and the Asse, though their name be according to their fire, yet they resemble
in conditions their dammes altogether. Wherefore it is best, to the end you
may haue goodly and beautifull she Mules,The markes of a good Asse to c

faire and beautifull, of a good race, and that hath beene well tried. You must chuse
one that is three yeares old and vpward, great and corpulent, of a strong neck, strong
and large ribbes, of an open and musculous or fleshie breast, fleshie thighes, well-trus

                     lea-bitten with red, tending to a bright, or of a
gray siluer colour, or of a darke murrey colour, for commonly Asses are of a Mouse
colour: but they which are of this haire, are not so liuely and stirring as the other:
and if there come forth either male or female Mule wearing this liuerie, they are not
so good and sutable. The Mare must be lesse than tenne yeares old, great and faire,
and of good limbes, to the end she may take and keepe the nature of the Asse, disagreeing
with her bodie, and being of another kind than she her selfe; and that she
bestow vpon her fruit not onely the gifts of the bodie, but also of spirit and liuelinesse▪
The young stayeth in the dammes bodie twelue moneths: wherefore the
Mare would be couered from mid March vnto mid Iune, to the end she may foale
when grasse is in full force, thereby to be sure to get good store of Milke. She hauing
brought forth her young one, it must be vsed after the manner of young Colts, excepted
onely, that after it hath sucked sixe moneths, the damme can giue it sucke no

longer, by reason of the ach of her teats: but it must be made to sucke some Mare,

                  The Horse-mule well chosen,Signes of a good Horse-Mule. must be of a grosse and round bodie, hauing small

must haue her legges somewhat grosse and round,Of a good Mare-Mule. a straight and solide bodie, and a
crupper hanging towards the taile. The Mare-Mules are stronger, mightier, nimbler,
and longer liuers than the Horse-Mules: but the Horse-Mules are more tractable
and more easie to guide and learne than the Mare-Mules be. Both of them are
subiect to lunacie: but to take this fault away, you must make them drinke some wine
oftentimes. If they be froward, and vnwilling to be sadled, you may tie vp one of
their fore-legges euen vnto their thighes, to the end that in the meane time they may
not fall backward. If they be hard to shooe on the right foot behind, you must

notwithstanding there is something peculiar in them, for which the remedies doe
follow: When she hath an Ague,Ague. you must giue her raw Coleworts: when she bloweth

giue her to drinke three quarters of a pint of Wine,Difficultie of breath. with halfe an ounce of Oyle, and
as much Frankincense, and two pints of the iuice of Horehound. If shee haue the

Barly meale,Leanenes. and open the impostume, if anie thing be in it. Their leanenesse and
languishing is taken away, by giuing them oftentimes drinkes made with halfe an

                  The InclosuresThe Inclosure. of the Gardens must be such as the commoditie and necessitie
of the place doth require, that is to say, of Walls, if the reuenues of the House
will beare it, or of a strong and thicke Quick-set Hedge, if there want either Pit-
                        •
                     tone
or reuenues to build the wall withall. Notwithstanding, it is least cost (to
speake the truth) and more profit to inclose and compasse them in with a Quick-set
Hedge than with a Wall: for the Quick-set Hedge doth endure a longer time,
and asketh not so great charges neither to trimme it, nor to repaire it, as the Wall
doth. Such a one is that which is made of Brambles and Thornes, as white Thorne,
or with the plants of Elder tree, or other plants, with tufted flowers mingled and set
amongst the Brambles, the same being cut by the taile and made plaine and euen
when the time of the yeare serueth, as wee see here in manie places of France.
Some there be that compasse and inclose their Gardens with Ditches and Banks,
but small to their profit, seeing the moisture of their Gardens, which should
serue them, is thereby conueyed away and taken from them: and this holdeth in
all other cases, but where the ground is of the nature of Marishes. The common
inclosing vsed by Countrey men, is of Thornes, Osiers, and Reedes: but
such Hedges doe require almost euerie yeare new repaire, reliefe, and making, in
putting new stakes therein; whereas if it had an abiding and liuing root, it would
free the Gardeners of a great deale of trouble, cost, and trauell.
                  The groundGrounds. of the Gardens must bee good, of his owne nature free from
Stones, Durt, and hurtfull Hearbes, well broken and dunged a yeare before it be
digged to be sowne: and after it hath beene digged and dunged againe, or mar

                     ed,
you must let it rest, and drinke in his dung and marle. And as concerning
the nature and goodnesse of it, the Clayie, Stiffe, or Sandie ground is nothing
worth, but it must be fat in handling, blacke in colour, and which crumbleth easily
in the breaking, or stirring of it with your fingers, or which hath his greene
Turfes or Clods breaking easily vnder the Pick-axe, and becommeth small with
labouring, as the small Sand; and generally, all grounds that are good for Wheat,
are good for Gardens. It is requisite also, to the end it may bring forth greene
Hearbes in aboundance, that it be a reasonable moist ground: for neyther the
ground that is much drie, nor that which is much subiect to water, is good for
Gardens. Notwithstanding, if the Grounds belonging vnto the Farme happen
not to haue this commoditie of idle and vnimployed ground to make Gardens,
you must remedie that soare as well as possibly you may. The Clayie, Stiffe,
and Sandie places must bee amended by Dung and Marle, and would bee
cast three foot deepe. The Watrie place shall be made better, if there bee
mixt with it some Sandie or Grauellie Ground, and therewith cast it round

about with ditches, thereby to draine and draw out the water annoying the Gard

hot, and in September in cold Countries. Lettuce, Sorrell, Purcelane▪ Cucumbers,
Gourds, Sauorie, Harts-horne, Trick-madame, Beets, and other tender

not dustie: for dust falling from them when they be broken, sheweth, that they

                     NOtwithstanding that the nature of the Ground, the mildnesse of the
Aire, fauourable furtherance of the Heauens, and the age of the Seed,
doe cause Seeds to hasten the more, or to be the flower in springing out
of the bosome of their mother and nurse the earth, (for as much as that
which is sowne in faire weather, and an open aire, in a hot place, and open vpon the
Sunne, and of new Seed, doth shew it selfe sooner than that which is sowne in a
contrarie time and place) yet euerie Seed hath a certaine time to manifest in selfe
in: whereto we must haue due regard, to the end that there may be prefixed times
to sow, and looke for the growth of euerie Seed: Spinach, Basill, Nauets, and Rocket,
grow within three daies after they be sowne; Lettuce, the fourth day; Cucumbers
and Citruls, the fifth; Purcelane a little later; Annise, the fourth; Cresses and
Mustard-seed, the fifth; Beets in Summer, on the sixt; and in Winter, on the tenth;
Arach, the eight; Coleworts, the tenth; Leekes, the nineteenth, or ofter the twentieth;
Coriander about the fiue and twentieth, or else more late, if the Seed be new; Organie
and Sauorie, after the thirtieth; Parsely in the fortieth, for the most part, and oftentimes
in the fiftieth. It is true, that in this place the age of the Seed, and state of
the Aire, when the Gardiner doth sow them, is of great moment: for (as I haue said)
the Leeke, Cucumber, and Citrull, grow sooner if the Seed be new: And on the contrarie,
Parsely, Spinach, Organie, Sauorie, Coriander, and Cresses, when their Seed is
sold: likewise the Seed of Cucumbers, steept in milke, or in warme water, putteth the
sooner out of the earth: after the same sort you may make reckoning of Artichokes,
and manie other hearbes, as you shall know hereafter in their particular Treatises.

                     SO soone as the ground is full of Seeds in all places,Watring. you must be carefull
to water it, if by hap the place be drie of his owne nature, that so the
Seed may not be hindered of his sprouting by the too much drinesse, or
that the hearbe alreadie sprung may not die.What water is good for Seeds. The best water to water the
pot-hearbs withall, is raine water, if it fall in the night, or in such a time as that it may

not heat the hearbes, for it washeth and cleanseth them from the dust and

that eateth them, especially if the Raine come driuing with a Northerne wind: for
want of this, the Riuer or Brooke water is best next, being a little warme: in place
of this, Well water drawne in the morning, and put in a barrell, or in some other
thing of receit, that so it may take the heat of the Sunne beames, may serue: for
cold and salt water is enemie to all sorts of hearbes, although that Theophrastus say,
that salt water is more conuenient than anie other to water certaine plants. Beside
                        •
                     ,
you shall vnderstand, that for the speedie growing of hearbes, or for comforting
them after they are once sprouted and risen aboue the earth, there is nothing

                  After that the hearbes haue begun to put forth,Weeding and raking. you must weed the bad from the
good, whose nourishment they would consume and ouer-shadow them withall: this
must be done with a forked trowell whiles they be verie small, and with the hand
(which Gardiners call by the name of making cleane) when the pot-hearbes are
growne strong and great. Some doe also weed them thus, as well for the weight
of the earth, and heauie falling of the water vpon them, as also because of the 
                        〈◊〉
                     
of folkes feet, whereby the earth becommeth hard: Wherefore if the 
                        〈◊〉
                     
be soft, you need not to 
                        •
                     ake it but verie slightly. And you must know, that
weeding is necessarie for Gardens at all times, except in the height of Winter,
that is to say, from Nouember till March: in all which time it is not good to weed,
because those weeds which doe then grow doe not offend or choake the hearbe
                        •
                     ,
but rather keepe them warme and comfort them: whereas, should they be taken
away, you would leaue the stemme and roots of your hearbes so naked to all the
bitternesse of Winter, that euerie small Rinde or Frost would endanger the vtter
killing and destroying of them, as you may find by proofe, if you please not to giue
credit to our relation.
                  Cutting of hearbes is also profitable for them at what time as they be somewha

them somewhat a more pleasant smell than they had in their first stalke. By this
meanes Lettuces and Coleworts are made better, and of a more pleasant taste,

their first leaues bee pluckt from them. In like manner, Turneps and 
                        〈◊〉
                     
grow more beautifull, and tufted, if their leaues be cut. But all hearbes must not
be cut at all times: for such as haue a hollow stalke, as Onions, and others, if
they be cut when it rayneth, the blade or stalke of the Onion is filled full of
water, and rotteth. And this is the cause why hearbes of such nature are not 
                        〈◊〉
                     
be cut but in a faire and drie time: Or if not cut at all, it is better, except it
be to keepe them from seeding, or to make the head a little the fairer; which,
fresh moulding will better doe, and with lesse labour. As for your Scallions,
Chyues, or Leekes, to cut them it is not amisse, because they are hearbes continually
to be vsed for the Pot; and in that respect, the oftener cut, so much
the better.

                  As for Chibols and Chyues, they come more neere vnto the nature of Onions
(as by the smell one may well perceiue) than vnto the nature of Leekes, which
they nothing resemble, saue onely in the blade or stalke, and in that they haue
no head. They must be sowne in the Spring, as other hearbes, in the same ground
with the Onion: They are verie pleasant in Salads, to temper the coldnesse of other
cold hearbes.

                     GArlickeGarlicke. (as is well knowne vnto the inhabitants of Gascoine, Aquitaine,
Limosin, and those about Burdeaux) would be planted at the
same time that Onions are, and in the new of the Moone, that so they
may be great: and it must not be set in whole heads, but in those little

                        •
                     loues and parts which may be diuided and taken off from the head. They shall be
set all along vpon beds diuided by ridges, like vnto ridged grounds of the Countrey
of Beaux, to the end that the water may not destroy them in Winter: For this
hearbe desireth a drie ground, and but a little moist, verie white, and not much dunged,
or verie fat. When they shall haue put forth three leaues, you must weed them
as oft as you can, for so they will become fairer, and their seed will be the greater.
Who so is desirous to haue it great headed, must take away the tops of it, or else
tread it downe with his feet before it put forth his stalke: for by this meanes the
iuice will returne into the head. It groweth likewise of Seed, but more slowly,
for it hath no better a head for the first yeare than a Leeke, the second yeare it
beginneth to be better headed and more like it selfe, but is not perfect and absolute
vntill the third yeare. If you sow it in the wane of the Moone, and take
them vp in like manner when the Moone is vnder the earth,Sweet Garli

that will not smell so strong: but contrariwise, if you sow in the new or
growth of the Moone. Likewise it will haue a sweet sauour, if when you sow
it you set in the middest thereof the kernels of Oliues: as likewise, if in planting
it you set by the side thereof a Cloue, ioyned verie close thereunto, it will
retaine the smell and taste thereof. In like manner it will be of a better taste, if
you steepe it in good sweet Wine a day before that you sow it: And if you
steepe it in Milke two dayes before you sowe it, it will become both greater
and better.

Moone, and in drie and faire weather, when the stalke will no longer stand vpright.
It is kept well vpon straw lying bare, or hung vp in the smoake of the chimney,
or being steept a little in salt water. And to keepe it long, you must let it ripe
well, and when it is gathered, to lay it in the Sunne, that it may drie throughly, and
afterward to lay it vp in a place that is not moist, and whereas notwithstanding the
Sunne commeth not, for so it would continue but a while. It is true, that if you
meane to sow and set it afterward, that then you must not hang it vp in the smoak

                     ,
nor steepe it in salt water, for such kind of keeping doth make it barren and not fit
to grow anie more.

                     PArsleyParsley. craueth no great labour, but loueth a stonie and sandie ground,
for which cause it is called Parsley: againe, it craueth not anie store of
manure; wherefore it will be good to sow it vnder Arbors. It desireth
aboue all things to be well watred: and if it so fall out, as that it be sowne
or planted neere vnto anie Fountaine or Riuer, it groweth verie faire, and in great
quantitie. And if anie be desirous that it should haue large leaues, hee must put
into a faire Linnen Cloth so much seed as he can hold in his three fingers, and so cast
it amongst the stones in the ground: or else he must put in a Goats trottle a quantitie
of Parsley seed, and so set or sow it. And he that will haue it curled, must bruise
the seed with a pestle of Willow, to the end that the huske may breake and fall off,
and afterward wrap it in a Linnen Cloth, and so put it in the ground. Otherwise,
without thus much to doe, it may be made to curle howsoeuer it be sowne, if you
draw a Rowler vpon it so soone as it beginneth to grow. It is a good time to sow it
from mid May vntill the Sunne be risen to his highest point in the Heauens, for it
somewhat craueth the heat. The seed thereof that is but a yeare old, is nothing
worth: for looke how much elder the seed is, by so much it is the better, and endureth
a long time vnsowne: in such sort, as that it will not be needfull to sow or plant
it of fiue yeares; although, when it is sowne, it groweth not vnder the space of
threescore daies. Notwithstanding, to cause it to grow, and put more speedily out
of the earth, it behoueth that the seed be steeped in vineger some certaine time, and
after sowne in a well toyled ground, and filled or mixed with one halfe of the ashes
of Beane stalkes: and after it is sowne, it must be oft watered, and sleightly, with a
little Aqua vitae: and by and by after the watering, to lay aloft it a piece of Cloth,
that the heat thereof may not be spent, and breath away, and by this meanes it
will grow vp within a few houres: and then you must take off the Cloth couering
it, and water it oft, and by this meanes it will haue both a high stalke and
great leaues.

when they grow too thicke together:) For doing so two or three yeares one after
another, it will fall out, that all the intangled and folded one within another
will be taken away; and then you may prune and trimme those which you leaue
standing, which you must couer from foot to foot, or from root to root, with well
seasoned manure, being rotted and mixed with as much sifted mould, sifting moreouer
the same which was aboue before, and putting it into his old place from
whence it was taken, and in such manner as it was found there. Howsoeuer it be,
the yeare after they be planted there may well be taken from them some one of their
stalkes, and the other let stand to seed. The stalke so taken away, must be cut away,

                  Of Saffron.

soyle, not strong, not dunged, but yet well eared, lying vpon the Sunne,
and well digged: and it commeth verie well in the place where Onions
haue growne. It loueth not water, and standeth in awe of the Moule and
Mice: It groweth better, the head being set, than the seed being sowne: for indeed
it is not vsed to be sowne, but the heads of it onely to be set, as the heads of Lillies,
Leekes, or Sea Onions are. They are planted and set by ridges in Aprill and May.
The heads are let ripen on heapes in the shadow of the Sunne, some eight daies before
they be set: and this must be in such a place as is not moist. They are set in a
well-digged earth with their roots, and a good distance one from another, as namely,
about halfe a spanne, and three ynches deepe. It groweth the better, if it be a little
footed vpon. It flowreth euerie yeare in Autumne, for one whole moneth together,
and then letteth the flower fall: but it keepeth his leaues greene all Winter
long vnto the Spring, and then it beginneth to wither, and maketh no shew at all in
Summer. It may continue good, being set and plant
                        •
                     d, for nine yeares: and then if
it be remoued into some other place, it will be able to doe further good. It is true
that it springeth forth manie cloues and kernels, which must be taken away euerie
three yeare, or else the root would be choaked and smothered. Some doe set it (as
being the best time) from after mid August vnto mid September, and cast at the
roots of it the drosse of Grapes as it commeth from the Presse,Good Saffron. and leaue it in the
earth two or three yeares: and euerie yeare, in Aprill and May, the dried part of
the hearbe is tyed vp and troden into the earth some two ynches deepe, without hurting
of the root: and after you haue cleansed the grassie part and leaues thereof,
and that the flower shall be ripe, as in August, and toward Autumne, it shall be
gathered in the morning at Sunne-rise, and reserued in a close and drie place.
Furthermore, the Saffron is knowne to be good, if it be fat: if being holden in
your hand, it make a noyse: and if being put into anie liquor, it dissolue: if being
handled and held vp to the face, it procure a certaine kind of biting or pricking vnto
the eyes: if it be of a golden colour: if it dye the hand with his colour, and haue
somewhat a

                  Saffron taken in a verie small quantitie, is good for the weakenesse of the stomacke,
and fainting of the heart: it keepeth from being drunke, and healeth the bitings
of Serpents and Spiders: if it be taken inwardly, or applyed outwardly, in
great quantitie, it procureth swimming and paine in the head, and bringeth a

insomuch as if there be set a vessell full of water vnder a Cucumber, it will be
found the next day to be shrunke three fingers, and it must be prouided that the
water goe directly downe vnto the root of the Cucumber, without touching the

them in any such time, neither yet hope for any great increase thereof, in such yeares,
as wherein such stormes and tempests fall out: for thereupon they wither and fall
quite away to nothing. If a man desire to haue them faire ones, he must gather them
in the full of the Moone, for at this time they grow bigge, and at other times they fade
and grow lesse.

full of oyle, because the cucumber of all other things hateth oile, and cannot thriue if
he which doth till them, haue handled oyle.

It is verie true that their seed boyled with Barley-water doth prouoke vrine, asswage

doe, foreseene that they haue the Sunne at commaund: it is true, that
they must be sowne with greater distances, and in such sort as they may
climbe stakes, heapes of stone, and arbours, thereby to giue some pleasure
in the beholding of the fruit hanging, rather than the lying vpon beds: for they
delight not so much in creeping vpon the earth as the Cucumber doth, but rather to
climbe on high.
                  Before you set them, you must steepe their seeds one night in water,The goodnesse of the seed. that so you
may learne to make the better choice of them, and to know which are good. And in
that respect it will be good to take those which sinke downe to the bottome, and let
alone those which shall swim vpon the top of the water, as being vnprofitable and
worth nothing to sow. The seeds shall be put into the earth two together, the sharpe
end vpward, in holes wide and deepe, to the quantitie of two foot, and three or
foure foot euerie one from another, filled with old dung, that is verie small: or else
to make them spring out of the earth the sooner, with horse dung as it commeth all
hot from the stable: for other matters they craue no great attendance, prouided that
they be serued with water to their contentment: and yet those which are least wa

                     ered,
will haue the most pleasant sauour and tast: wherefore if they be sowne in a drie
ground, you must set hard by them, pots of water with lists of cloth or straw hanging
at them, which will be continually dropping of water vpon them, which thing
will be great aduantage to them during the great heat. It is certaine that the goodnesse
and fairenesse of Gourds doth consist altogether in the good choice and well
setting of the seed: for the seeds which are next to the necke of the gourd, doe bring
forth long ones, those which are in the middest, round ones: and those which are by
the sides, short and thicke ones: in which consideration if you would haue grosse
and thicke gourds, which may serue to make vessells and bottles of, when they shall
be drie, you must take the seed that is in the middest of the gourd, and set it with the
head downward: but when you desire to haue them to sell and to eat, you must take
of the seed next vnto the necke, and set them after the right and common manner:
for so the fruit will grow long, and more tender, and of a greater price. The gourds
intended to gather seed of for to sow, must not be gathered before Winter, and when
they are gathered, they must be put in the Sun to drie, or else hung vp in the smoake,
or else hung (as the manner is in France) vnder some chamber-floore, or else set
them in rows voon boards, for otherwise the seeds would rot: or else to put them in
heaps of corne, which will not onely keepe them from rotting, but will also ripen
them if they be gathered being yet vnripe: but those which are intended to be eaten,
must be gathered at their due time when as they be ripe.

are of opinion, that there is nothing better to asswage the heat of hot burning agues,
to take away the thirst, and to loosen the bellie, then to vse oftentimes the strayned
juice of Gourds stewed without liquor, in a new earthen pot, set in an ouen. There is

You must take the seed of the Melon, which hath a thicke and hard huske, and looking

is greatly hindered thereby: and thereupon pricke six or ten seeds of your pompions,
the sharpe end downeward (although some put not in aboue foure or fiue)
and couer them againe gently without much beating or treading of the earth downe
vpon them. Afterward, for to auoid daunger of frosts, couer them with straw or
mats borne vp with stickes prickt vp one way: or if you haue the benefit of great
boards, or tables of boards, borne vp with stones or rubbish by the way, that so they
may not presle vpon them, and that so you may take them vp when the Sunne shineth
hot, and lay them downe againe when the cold wind bloweth and when frosts
come. And as soone as the Melons shall haue put forth leaues bigge ynough, you
must water them with a shred of cloth hanging continually in a pot of water, without
wetting of the Melon any whit at all, and this watering must be continued in a verie
drie ground, though you haue remoued your Melons, till the fruit become of the
bignesse of Oranges: and if you vse beds, you shall remoue them after mid-May in
this countrie, out of the danger of frosts, about fiue or sixe foot one from another, vpon
a border well tilled and manured. And from that time forward, you shall weed
out diligenetly all the weeds from about them, and shall lighten their earth at the
trunk of the root, without doing any hurt to it: and when the flower shall peepe out,
you must cut off the ends of the armes of the hea

                      so be that your melon plot doe bring forth the fruit somewhat late, for otherwise
it will be good to take them that come forth last: as also that which groweth betwixt
the middle and head, or crowne of the melon, and out of it, not that which is on
that side whereupon the Melon lieth, the best seeded, and most rising from the earth,
being heauie and full; and you may make triall of it in water, because that such seed
will sinke downe to the bottome: and it must not be aboue one yeare old, for if it be,
it soone groweth sicke, and casteth his fruit in vntimely sort.
                  Pompions and MelonsThe gathering of Melons. must be gathered in the morning before Sunne rise, and
they must be gathered when as they begin to cast their taile, and yeeld a pleasant smel
at their ends, and then you must beware of and looke to Cats that goe a catterwauling:
and if you would carrie or send them farre, you must gather them a little before
they be ripe, and with the hand onely without any edge-toole, for they will come
so their just and perfect ripenesse by this course, which the cutting with an yron
would keepe them from: there must notwitstanding care be had that those which
are called Winter Pompions, be neuer suffered to ripen vpon their beds, but for to
ripen them they must be gathered and hung vp vnder the floore of some higher
roome, and when they are once turned yellow to eat them.
                  Furthermore, that I may say something of their goodnesse,The goodnesse of Melons. you must vnderstand
that there are diuers sorts of Pompions, for there are some female, and are called
pompionets and they are more long than the other, and haue not their wrinkles standing
vp so high: the other be more thick &amp; greater bellied, and haue their wrinkle
                        •
                     
more high and stretched out from the taile vnto the eye. Some of them are called

Melons, and haue a more fast and solide flesh than the pompions haue, which
likewise haue not so many wrinkles in their sides, nor so much moisture in their nollow
parts, neither yee are they so thicke, but haue a whitish flesh, and a great deale
more seed than the pompions. The other sort may be called citruls, as hauing the fashion
and colour of a citron, and their leaues diue

are not so thick or great as the common pompions: and yet furthermore the one hath
a white meat, and the other a yellow, whereupon the first doe craue more water than

the later, and the later are better in a strange Countrie. But the Melons are best of all,

                      haue no need of great toyle or tilling, so that they be planted
in some good ground not manured, notwithstanding, but well shaded
howsoeuer: because they delight greatly in the shadow of other
hearbes, so also they are found growing amongst great tall trees, without
any manner of husbanding or tillage. It is true that they grow well in the open Sun,
so that they be watered once or twice a weeke, especially when they begin to looke
red: they must be remoued euerie three yeares, to make them beare faire berries, and
their earth raised about them once euerie yeare, and that about Christ-tide, and to
weed them by hand when as weeds doe ouergrow them: in the ground whither you
remoue them, you must first put horse-dung well rotted, or cowes dung, a scuttle full
to euerie border that is three foot broad: dresse this ground in a drie time, and let it
lye afterward, and in a moist time, but not rainie, you shall set the Strawberries
halfe a foot euerie way, thrusting the earth close to the root with a dibble. In these
you may obserue a certaine kind of wonderfull harmelesnesse and innocencie:
which although they creepe vpon the earth, and be continually troden vpon by Adders,
Lizards, Snakes, and other venimous beasts, are notwithstanding neuer infected
with them, neither get they any venimous sauour, which sheweth that they haue no

through a Limbecke in Maries-bath, doth maruailously heale the Agues caused
of the obstructions of any noble part: and which is more, it killeth the wormes,
and wipeth away all the spots of the face, it they be often washed therewith. It is
exceeding good against the inflammation of the eyes. It is verie soueraigne against
any infection or mortall sicknesse, if it be drunke with Water and Honie it abateth
the swelling of the bodie, and easeth the colicke, whether it be in the stomach or in
the bowels, it also cureth the biting or stinging of venimous beasts, and it causeth a

Agues. The powder of this root drunke with wine, is excellent for the suffocations
of the Matrix, and the wringing throwes of the bellie. This powder also killeth

applyed to itchie places, and the places bare of haire, or mixed with oyles and ointments,
doe great good vnto the same, as also vnto plaguie carbuncles: for they being
rubbed with the iuice of Scabious, will be found to vanish away within three houres.
The iuice of Scabious drunke in the quantitie of foure ounces, with a dramme of
Treacle not yet one day old, is a singular remedie against the Plague, so that afterward

Amongst other vertues, it is singular good to comfort the lungs and parts aboue the
breast, whether you take it in a decoction, or in a syrrup, or in manner of a fume at
the mouth, or otherwise; especially if you mingle some slippes of Hysope, and some
figges, or syrrup, with the said decoction. The great Colts-foot, especially the root
thereof, dried, powdred, and taken in the weight of two drammes with wine, is singular
against the Plague, if so the partie sweat presently after. It is good also to giue
vnto Horses which haue the bots, or are short-winded.

and Sunne doth shine pleasantly.
                  The root of the great Carline made into powder, and taken the weight of a French

The root thereof taken either in powder, or in a decoction, with the broth of those
Frogges which are vsed to be eaten, or for lacke of Frogges, in the decoction of a

the quantitie of six ounces, with an ounce of Sugar, doth presently stay the bloud
running downe from the breast, stomacke, or liuer, and knitteth together the vessels
therein, if anie be broken: which I my selfe haue proued and tried. Two drammes
of the iuice drunke with honied water, doe loosen the bellie, and free the liuer from
obstructions, as also the spleene; in respect whereof, it is singular good for the
Dropsie and Iaundise, but you must mixe with it a little Mallicke, or Nutmeg,
or Rhubarbe, for to correct the vehemencie thereof. It is incredible what ease the
iuice thereof worketh in the Colicke, and other such like griping pangs, if it be put
into Clysters: how greatly also it profiteth in Oyntments, Liniments, and Cataplasmes,
appointed for the hardnesse and swellings of the spleene and liuer. If you
infuse the roots chopped small in the oyle of Roses, or Camomill, or sweet Almonds,
and afterward boyle them together, putting thereto a little wine, in the end you shall
presse them out: This oyle dropped by two or three droppes into the eares, doth
driue away the noyse and deafenesse of the eares, especially if vpon the eares you
apply the drosse of these rootes at night at the parties going to bed: or else chop
small the rootes, stampe them with Peaches and bitter Almonds, steepe them all in
Aqua vitae, afterward straine them, and drop certaine drops of that which shall be
pressed out, into the eares: this is verie soueraigne for deafenesse and the noyse of the eares.

                  Buckwheat is a verie common hearbe,Backwheat or binacorne. and yet but little knowne by his name: it is
verie ordinarie in corne and tilled grounds about haruest time. The Peasants of

they happen to cut themselues with their sickles. For to know it better therefore
(than onely by the name) it putteth forth from the root, fiue, sixe, seuen, or eight
small branches, for the most part layed along vpon the earth, of the length of a hand,
and sometime of a foot, bearing leaues somewhat like vnto the little bindweed, but

reason of his singular and almost diuine vertues, such as you shall heare
of hereafter: whereof (because none, either of the old or new Writers
that haue written of the nature of Plants, haue said anie thing) I am willing to lay
open the whole Historie, as I haue come by it through a deere friend of mine, the
first Author, Inuentor, and Bringer of 
                        〈◊〉

the Indians, from whence this hearbe came, to put the same in writing, to quite such
of griefe and trauell, as haue heard of this hearbe, but neither know it, nor the properties
thereof.
                  This hearbe is called Nicotiana, of the name of an Embassadour, which brought
the first knowledge of it into this Realme,Why it was called Nicotiana. in like manner as manie Plants doe as
yet retaine the names of certaine Greekes and Romans, who being strangers in diuers
Countreyes for their Common-wealths seruice, haue from thence indowed
their owne Countrey with manie sorts of Plants, whereof there was no knowledge
before.
                  Some call it the hearbe of Queene-mother, because the said Embassadour,The hearbe of Queene-mother. Lord
Nicot, did first send the same vnto the Queene Mother (as you shall vnderstand
by and by) and for being afterward by her giuen to diuers others to plant and make
to grow in this Countrey. Others call it by the name of the hearbe of the great
Prior,The hearbe of the Great Priour. because the said Lord a while after sayling into these Westerne Seas, and
happening to lodge neere vnto the said Lord Embassadour of Lisbone, gathered
diuers Plants thereof out of his Garden, and set them to encrease here in France,
and that in greater quantitie, and with more care, than anie other besides him, hee
did so highly esteeme thereof for the exceeding good qualities sake. The Spaniards
call it Tabacco.Tabacco. Some call it the Holy hearbe,The Holie hearbe. because (as I thinke) of his
holy and maruellous effects. Verie manie haue giuen it the name of Male Petum,
to know it from the Female Petum; which is (in truth) the proper name of the
hearbe, vsed by them of the Countrey from whence it was brought: Notwithstanding,
it were better to call it Nicotiana, after the name of the Lord which
first sent the same into France, to the end, that wee may giue him the honour
which hee hath deserued of vs, for hauing furnished our Land with so rare and
singular an hearbe. And thus much for the name: Now listen vnto the whole
Historie.
                  Master Iohn Nicot, one of the Kings Councell,Mans

in the Realme of Portugall, in the yeares of our Lord God, 1559, 1560,
and 1561, went on a day to see the Monuments and worthie Places of the said
King of Portugall: at which time, a Gentleman, keeper of the said Monuments,
presented him with this hearbe, as a strange Plant, brought from Florida. The Noble
man, Sir Nicot, hauing procured it to grow in his Garden, where it had put
forth and maltiplied verie greatly, was aduertised on a day by one of his Pages,
that a young boy, kinsman of the said Page, had layd (for tryall sake) the said

hearbe stampt, the substance and juice and altogether, vpon an vlcer which he had
vpon his cheeke, neere vnto his nose, next neighbour to a Noli me tangere, as hauing
alreadie seised vpon the cartilages, and that by the vse thereof it was become maru

                         of a Noli me tangere. and making
him to continue the applying of this hearbe for eight or tenne daies, the Noli
me tangere became throughly killed. Now they had sent oftentimes vnto one of
the Kings most famous Physitions the said boy, during the time of this worke
and operation, to marke and see the proceeding and working of the said Nicotiana:
and hauing in charge to continue the same vntill the end of tenne dayes,
the sayd Physitian then beholding him, assured him certainely, that the Noli me tangere was dead: as indeed the boy neuer felt anie thing of it at anie time
afterward.

the vertues thereof much spoken of, and the common people began to call it the
Embassadours hearbe.
                  Now, vpon this occasion, there came certaine daies after a Gentleman out of the
fields, being father vnto one of the Pages of the said Lord Embassadour, who

said Lord Embassadour some of his hearbe, and vsing it in manner afore mentioned,
he was healed by the end of tenne or twelue daies.
                  After this yet the hearbe grew still in greater reputation: insomuch, as that mani

bigger downeward toward the root than aboue: as you see the smooth Docke leafe

leaues are, the better the Tabacco is esteemed. Whiles it is young, it is leaued, and as
it were lying vpon the ground: but rising to a stalke, and growing further, it ceaseth
to haue such a number of leaues below, and putteth forth branchesBranches. from halfe foot

sowne in a hot and fat ground, and carefully tilled. The boughes and branches
thereof put out at ioints, and diuide the stalke by distances of halfe a foot: the highest
of which branches are bigger than an arme. At the tops and ends of his branches
and boughs, it putteth forth flowersFlower. almost like vnto those of Nigella, of a whitish

verie carefully, because they be subiect to swounings. Which is more,The fume of Nicotiana asswageth hunger and thirst. the inhabitance

of certaine small hornes, the picture whereof you may see by the figure of the hearbe.
And the truth hereof we gather from them which haue beene in the countries of Florida,
and by mariners comming daily from the Indies, which hanging about their
neckes little pipes or hornes made of the leaues of the Date-tree, or of reeds, or of rushes,
at the ends of which little hornes there are put and packt many drie leaues of
this plant, writhen together and broken. They put fire to this end of the pipe, receiuing
and drawing in with their breath at their mouth wide open, so much of this
fume as possibly they can, and affirme thereupon that they find their hunger and
chirst satisfied, their strength recouered, their spirits rejoyced, and their braine
drencht with a delightsome drunkennesse: as also to auoyd out of the mouth an infinite
quantitie of flegmaticke water. But in that the fume of this hearbe maketh
men somewhat drunke, some men haue thought it to be verie cold, and by that reason
a kind of yellow Henbane, which it resembleth much in his stalkes, leaues, cups,
and seed,That Nicotiana doth not make drunke. as we haue said before: but we must know that the fume of this hearbe
doth not make drunken so quickly, and withall, that this kind of drunkennesse
doth not proceed of excessiue cold, such as is found in Henbane, but rather in a certaine
atomaticall vapour which doth fill the ventricles of the braine. All which
vertues and properties, besides that we haue proued and tried them in many diseases
here in the countries of France, to the great comfort of the sicke: they also which
come from the Indies, and new world of Florida, haue confidently auouched vnto
vs to haue proued and tried the same in themselues, hauing beene wounded and

priests of these barbarous nations, whereof they make vse in their Magicall practises

to know are reuealed vnto them. And that it is so, the sauage and bruitish Indians
being accustomed to aske of their Priests the successe and euents of things to
come, is proued by the Priests: for then they to fulfill the desires and requests of
the Indians, take the leaues of this plant and put them in a pipe, or hollow end of a

the simplicitie of this poore people deluded, by the companie of the said Priests,
holding for a true and certaine oracle their vertue proceeding from this plant. Furthermore

is better for wounds onely, canerous vlcers, ringwormes, skurfes, and fire faces, because
it hath more force to clense and resolue, which is the principall and chiefe propertie
of Nicoriana, not being hindered or restrained by the mixture of other ingredients.

The other Ointment is better to incarnate and consolidate all sorts of wounds,
to resolue impostumes and swellings, to mitigate paines, and other effects.
                  Besides these two sorts of Ointments,An excellent Balme made of Nicotiana. there may be made a verie excellent Balme
of Nicotiana: Distill the leaues of Nicotiana with the iuice pressed out (the drosse
being cast away) put it into a Glasse-violl, with like quantitie of common Oyle: set
this Violl, well stopt with gummie Wax, in the Sunne a long time, and tye vpon the
top of it a strong parchment; or else set this Violl in a Cauldron full of boyling water,
or burie it in Horse dung, and let it stand there full fortie daies, changing the dung
sometimes: the fortie daies expired, you shall find a Balme in the Violl, which is of

all the properties that may be desired in this Plant.
                  Lastly, you shall vnderstand that the ashes of this Nicotiana is of no lesse soueraigntie
and medicinall vse than the leafe before rehearsed: for after you haue taken the
fume of the Tabacco, and that the powder is burnt into ashes, you shall saue those
ashes in a close boxe, for they will cure anie greene wound whatsoeuer. They are also
most excellent for the skinning of anie soare or vlcer: and if you steepe them in
white Wine or Vrine, and make a lee thereof, (but Vrine is the better, because it hath

with this ice if you bath anie old and inueterate vlcer, it will take away the itch,

white, smooth, and preserue them a long time from rotting.

of and esteemed, and that according vnto the verie truth, so farre as possibly I

the Portugals, Spaniards, and our owne Countreymen, which haue come hither
these last yeares past from out of Florida (which is the naturall soyle of the same) as
also such experiments as haue beene made here in France of the faculties and vertues
thereof, altogether like vnto those which that Plant which Florida (as the naturall
Countrey thereof) doth bring forth and nourish: Which if you haue not alwayes
found in euerie point correspondent and answering vnto such effects as we attribute
and giue vnto it, yet you must not therefore condemne the Plant, as though those
were but fained and counterfeited properties and vertues which wee haue deliuered
and reported of it; but rather accuse the small care which is had in the planting of it
here amongst vs: assuring your selues, that if you prouide for it such a soile, and other
comforts, as it hath where it naturally groweth, or somewhat neere thereunto (for

                  A briefe discourse of the root Mechoacan.
                  
                     WIthin certaine yeares past, the Indians, Portugals, and Spaniards haue sent
vs the root of an hearbe, which they call Mechoacan which hath vertue
to purge the humors in the same sort that our vsuall purging medicines.
Our Countrey men, giuen to admit of and easily receiue new things, doe
greatly esteeme of it, euen vntill this present: We will lay downe the historie thereof
in briefe, and as truly as possibly we could come by it, to the end it may the better be
discerned whether it deserue to be had in such estimation as we haue it in, or no.
                  The root is called Mechoacan,The reason why it is so called. of the name of the Region or Countrey where it
groweth, which is a Prouince of New Spaine (situate in the West Indies, or New
World) called by the inhabitants Chincicila, and by the commandement of the Ca
                     
                        •

King, Mechoacan: Which Prouince aboundeth with Gold, Siluer, Cattell,
Corne, Fruits, exquisite Plants, mynes of Mettall and Stones, and all sorts of good
things; where also the people are well coloured, full of vigour, strong of bodie, and
of a perfect health, and that by reason of the Ayre, which is more wholesome there
than in anie other place of the Indies. The occasion of the name rose thus: The Spaniards,
Lords of this Prouince, and being desirous to plant it with Christians, did
erect and set vp a Couent of Friers Cordeliers, liuing Monastically; whose Prouinciall
Father being extreame sicke, was quickly cured by an Indian Physitian, who
caused him to vse oftentimes the powder of this well-prospe
                        •
                     ing and happily-succeeding
medicine: when as therefore they fell sick
                        •
                     , they tooke, with good successe,
of this powder. And thus this root came in great request throughout the whole Prouince:
and from thence the prayses thereof were carried and published throughout
all Spaine and Portugall; and thereupon it hath kept the name of the Prouince of
Mechoacan. The fame thereof is likewise come into France by the meanes of Merchants,
desirous of gaine, who haue brought it vs hither from thence. Some call it
Rhamindick,Rhamindicke. because it seemeth that it hath the like propertie of attracting and purging
flegmaticke and serous humors, which the East Rhubarbe hath to attract and
purge cholericke humours.
                  This root is not brought vnto vs whole,The markes of Mechoacan. but in pieces and round slices, whereinto
it is diuided with kniues, or with hands, so soone as it is drawne out of the earth, that
so it may the better drie in the shadow (although in drying it grow but little lesse)
and that it may keepe better in these round slices, than either whole, or in powder:
But the powder which is brought from the Indies, is of lesse operation than that
which is made into powder amongst vs: it is thicke and of a weightie substance, and
the rinde thereof of an Ash-like colour: the inward substance white, and marked
with manie circles, without anie tast, except such as meale is wont to haue: for it is
neither sharpe, nor sweet, nor bitter; and smell it hath none, neither is it anie thing
pithie.
                  The best is that which is whitest,To chuse the best Mechoacan. most close in it selfe, well set and ioyned together,
somewhat heauie, not full of holes, or rotten: it becommeth, in time, of white,
somewhat grayish or blackish, and thus by his colour is discerned whether it be new
or old: for the new is white, but the old grayish, or blackish, and, as it were, wrought
with diuers colours.
                  This is the root of a Plant, which is a kind of great Bindweed, called in French
Lizeron, which windeth it selfe about Reedes or Stakes along vp to the top of them,
helping it selfe, in this compassing sort, to climbe without anie manner of aid: it
hath a stalke or trunke mixe of diuers colours, as deepe yellow, greenish, reddish,
somewhat of the colour of Ashes and Medlay, commonly called the Lyons colour:
the leaues are somewhat moist (there being within the flowers, as it were, clappers,

with round knots at the vpper end, the sharpe-pointed end being toward the 
                        〈◊〉

as bigge as a Coriander seed, and it is ripe in the moneth of September, and in the
Spring following. It putteth forth neere vnto the rootes small siences and 
                        〈◊〉

that is to say, proceeding of flegmaticke and cholericke causes mixt together,

cholericke Agues, nor yet in anie other such sicknesses,Mechoacan is not fit for cholericke diseases. as are ioyned with great
heat and inflammation, nor yet where adust humours doe offend: for although it
purge them, yet it leaueth behind it some notable heat: but it is verie true, that in

you giue it: and afterward beat it in a mortar, and make it into powder, neither too
grose nor too fine: then afterward put this powder in three ounces of white Wine,
(when there is no Ague) or water, or the decoction, or broth of Endiue, or Succorie,
or of a Chicken, or some other such liquor, which is meet and fit for the present disease:
as in the water of Betonie, for the head-ach; or in the water of Mother-wort,
for the diseases of the Matrix, and so forth of others: afterward, the next morning,
you must drinke it, the liquor and powder all together: there may further, at your
pleasure, anie syrrup that you will, be mixed therewith, if so be you know it meet
and conuenient for the disease in hand. It is true, that we haue often proued, namely,
that it endureth no mixture of syrrups, or such other things, no, nor of Cinnamon (if
the ill disposednesse of the stomacke doe not require it) for in such mixtures it maketh
no operation,The infusion of Mechoacan. and therefore it is better to take it altogether simple. It may be

to drinke: but in this case the quantitie of the powder must be encreased, vntill it
come to three or foure drammes, for otherwise it will worke no effect; in as much as
experience hath taught vs, that the purging qualitie of this root lyeth not so much in
the subtle parts thereof, as in the substance. Which thing Mesues may seeme to haue

vnto this root, and to that Rubarbe of the East, vpon their longer staying in the stomacke,
being taken in substance, than in infusion, and thereupon make a stronger
and a longer continuance of their purging. This powder may be also prepared in
another manner:Marchpanes of Mechoacan. as namely, by making Marchpanes of the said powder with stamped
Almonds and Sugar, which will be verie fit to purge young children after a

small as Coriander seedes, to the end they may be the sooner dissolued within the
stomacke, and not stay long there to heat it: or else they may be made greater, when
there is anie purpose that the said powder should draw from the ioints and outward

not anie wringings in the bellie; neither prouoketh it anie vomit: It purgeth so gently,
as that it worketh not anie weaknesse or relaxation, or anie other such passion vnto
the stomack: it resolueth not or looseneth the naturall power; neither doth it trouble
or put the bodie to paine: but contrariwise, it maketh it strong &amp; lustie, as though indeed
it were no purgatiue or medicine, but a familiar &amp; acceptable thing to our nature;

which thing falleth not out ordinarily in other medicines: so that young children,

                        rres, there is another speciall regard to be taken to these
medicinall hearbes; which is, to plant them in those coasts and corners of your Garden
which is most proper to their natures, giuing them that Sunne, that Shade, and
that Wind, which is most proper and behoofefull for them: for some take delig

the Easterly quarters, some in the West, some in the North, and some in the South:
as was most curiously obserued by Master Richard de Beleuall, Physitian to the last
King of France; who, at his Maiesties commandement, planting a Physick-Garden
in Montpelier, gaue vnto euerie hearbe his due place so rarely and artificially, that
neuer anie was seene to flourish or encrease in more rare and aboundant manner, neither
to haue greater strength or operation in their working, to the great admiration
of the learned, and his high renowme in the workmanship. To proceed then to the
naturall Clymats in which manie of these Physicke hearbes naturally delight,Hearbes of the East. you
shall vnderstand, that those hearbes which delight in the East, and loue to behold
the Sunne at his first arising, is first Angelica, of which there are two kinds, the one
called Garden Angelica, the other Wild Angelica: both may be sowne either before
or immediately after Winter. It is soueraigne against all Infection, and therefore
much sought after in the time of Pestilence and Mortalitie: it also healeth the
biting of Serpents, or mad Dogges, and dryeth vp those naughtie humours which
offend the stomacke. Then Valerian, of which wee haue written before: and also
Argentine. Then Dogges-tooth, which must be sowne on good earth almost in anie
moneth: the decoction whereof taken, with great reason helpeth Feauers, and kill
the Wormes in children. Then Sophya, otherwise called Talietrum, which may be
either sowne or planted in the Spring, or in Autumne: The seeds of it being beaten
to powder, and drunke in Wine, is excellent for all euacuations and clearings of the
bloud: also it helpeth women in Child-bearing. Then Oxe-eye, which would be
sowne at the Spring vnder the eauings of houses, for it loues shelter. The hearbe is
good to be drunke for the Iaundise: and being made into a Cataplasme, it dissolueth
all manner of hardnesse: and the decoction thereof will occasion Vrine. Then
Centaurie, which first tooke his name from Chiron the Centaure, when he was wounded
with a poysoned shaft. It requireth a well-laboured earth, and verie fruitfull,
according to some opinions: yet it is oftest found in Wood-land Countreyes and
barren places; whence it seemeth, that a reasonable earth will beare it: and it may
be sowne or planted either in the Spring, or in Autumne: it is a great purifier of the
Bloud, and verie soueraigne against Wormes: it healeth old Vlcers, especially the
powder thereof: and the decoction thereof is excellent against Rheumes and Fluxes.
Then Millefoile, which desireth rather a moist than a drie earth, and must be
planted thinne, for it spreadeth much: it is soueraigne against the Dissenterra, and
against all excessiue euacuation of bloud, in what part soeuer it be. Then Brassula
Maior, or Minor, which is an hearbe of quicke and easie growth, especially if it be
planted against a wall or house side, and may be sowne in the Spring, or planted in
Autumne: it is good for the stanching of Bloud, and it cureth most inward Vlcers.
Then Bedegaris, or white Thorne, which desireth a good earth, and may be sowne
in the Spring: the decoction of it is excellent for the Tooth-ach, or for a weake
Stomacke, for the Collicke, or Flux of the bellie. Then Crespinet, or Poligonon,
which euer groweth best in a moist ground. It is good for the Stone, the
Gout, Flux of the bellie, or paine in the Eares. Then Ebulus, which may be sowne
in the Spring, or in Autumne: it purgeth Choler and Flegme, being eaten in pottage:
and the decoction thereof taketh away the paine of the Gout, and helpeth the
French sicknesse. Mercurie is of two sorts, male, and female: it desireth a ground
that is well tilled: it may be sowne in the Spring time: the decoction thereof purgeth
Choler and all superfluous humours: it also looseneth the bellie, chiefely if it
be ministred in Glyster, and prouoketh the termes in Women. Then Card

root, or from the seed, in the Spring time, or in Autumne: The chiefest vertue of
this Plant consisteth in the seed, which being beaten to powder, and drunke with
Wine, prouoketh Vrine, and expelleth Grauell. Lastly, Venus haire, which groweth

these, a reasonable iudgement may find how to plant, nourish, and vse anie whatsoeuer.
There be also diuers purgatiue Simples, as Rhubarbe, Agaricke, and such
like, which for as much as our Soyles will not endure or beare them, I will here
omit to speake of them; onely a word or two of the hearbe Sene, which is
somewhat more frequent with vs, and is of that delicate, holesome, and harmelesse
nature in his working and operation, that it may be tearmed the Prince, or
Head of Simples. Then touching Sene, you shall vnderstand, that it beareth little
small thicke leaues vpon a high large stalke: it hath flowers of the colour of
gold, with diuers purple veines running vpon them. Some take the Hearbe
which Theophrastus writeth of, called Colutea, to be Sene: but they are deceiued
therein: for the one is a Tree, and no Hearbe, and the other is an Hearbe, and no
Tree: besides diuers other differences, needlesse here to repeat; all which are at
large see downe by Anthonie Mirauld, Doctor of Physicke, and a Bourbonois, in
his booke intituled Maison Champestre. It may be planted either from the stalke or root, like Rosemarie, in anie good, fertile, and drie soyle, where it may haue the
full reflection of the Sunne: and the season best and fittest for the same plantation,
is at the later end of Autumne. As touching the choice of the best Sene, that
hath euer the best reputation, which is brought from Alexandria in Syria, as the
best of our moderne Physitians doe report: but Iaques Siluius saith, That the Sene
which commeth out of India is not at all inferiour to it; neither that which groweth
in Tuscanie. True it is, that there is not anie of them but is passing good. As
for the vertnes of Sene, according to the opinion of Aetuarius, one of the best reputed
Physitians amongst all the Grecians, hee writeth, That Sene is verie excellent
for the purging and auoiding of choler and flegme, without anie danger of disturbance
vnto the bodie and spirits: it also purgeth most sweetly all melancholie
and adust humours, being taken in the broth of a Capon: it also taketh away all
inueterate and old paines in the head, and easeth all inward obstructions. According
to the opinion of Master Iohn of Damascus, and excellent Arabian Physitian,
Sene being abstersiue and binding, purgeth excellently the braine, the sensitiue,
parts, and organs of the heart, from all adust and melancholie humours: it also
helpeth all long and tedious Feauers: it also reioyceth the spirits, and taketh away
all sadnesse from the heart. A decoction made of the leaues thereof, together
with Camomill, strengtheneth the braine wonderfully, and comforteth the sinewes,
being bathed therein: also being taken anie way, it confirmeth both the sight and
hearing. And if you find that the purgation be weake, you may then strengthen
it, with mingling therewith Simples of stronger nature, as Sal Gemma, Sal India,
and such like: but if you vse it for anie griefe in the stomacke, then you shall mix
strong cordials therewith, and administer it either in the broth of Veale, Chickens,
or Capons, or anie other flesh. And Serapion, another Arabian Physitian, writeth,
That Sene is excellent for those which are dull of vnderstanding, for those which
are subiect to frenzie or madnesse, or anie decrepitnesse of bodie, proceeding from
inward weakenesse. And to all these former opinions, Iohn Fernell, Iaques Siluius,
Manard Ferrarois, and Andrew Mathiol, the most excellent reputed
Physitians of their times, are fully and truely consenting, as may be found in each of their
Writings.

differ from the flowres of marigolds in this, in that the flowres of the marigold doe
open at the Sunne-shine, but the flowres of Corneflag doe shut and close vp themselues
then, not opening againe but when it is cold and moist weather. The roots
must be pulled out of the earth in the beginning of the Spring, that thereby they
may haue a pleasant smell, and a delectable kind of sauour, and afterward they must
be died in the shadow of the Sunne. Some people, to take away the superfluous
moisture thereof, which putteth them in danger to be consumed with Wormes, doe
vvet them with Lee of ashes, as well whiles they are in the earth, as when they are
out, and so drie them and keepe them for to procure the linnens and woollen garments

                  CHAP. L.
                  Of the forme of setting Hearbes in order, by proportion
of diuers fashions.
                  
                     WEe haue alreadie deliuered the forme of setting Hearbes in order, as well
such as are of a sweet smell, as those which are for nosegaies, and that
either vpon particular beds or quarters: now we will speake of the
manner of bestowing of them in proportions of diuers fashions, and in
labyrinthes or mazes. But in this course I cannot set thee downe an vniuersall, and as
it were inuiolable prescript and ordinance, seeing the fashions of proportions doe
depend partly vpon the spirit and inuention of the Gardener, and partly vpon the
pleasure of the maister and Lord vnto whom the ground and garden appertaineth:
the one whereof is lead by the hops and skips, turnings and windings of his braine;
the other by the pleasing of his eye according to his best fantasie. Notwithstanding
that there may not any thing be here omitted, which might worke your better contentment

and greater pleasure, by looking vpon the beautie and comelinesse of this
your garden-plot: I intend to set before you diuers figures of proportions, and the
manner of drawing of them cunningly, to the end you may haue the meanes to chuse
those which shall most delight you, and best agree with your good liking. In which
I desire you to giue great thankes, and acknowledge your selfe greatly beholden and
bound vnto Monsieur Porcher, Prior of Crecie in Brie, the most excellent man in
this art, not onely in France, but also in all Europe: and not vnto me, who shall be
but his mouth in deliuering what he hath said, written, and communicated vnto me
in precepts, yet extant, and to be seene with the eye. And touching these proportions,
you shall vnderstand that they are of two kinds, inward and outward, the inward
are those beauties and proportions which are bestowed vpon the inward parts
or quarters of your garden, as are knots, mazes, armes, braunches, or any other curious
figures whatsoeuer, and these are diuided by slender rowes, or lines of hearbes,
flowers, turfes, or such like; the outward beauties or proportions are those which are
bestowed in the outward and generall parts of the whole or entire modell of the garden,
drawne into what figure, knot, or deuise your fancie can create, or the ground
retaine, and are diuided by alleyes, hedges, deepe borders, and such like, as shall be
at large shewed vnto you hereafter.
                  To come therefore vnto the matter, all the sweet smelling hearbes and others for

lauander and rosemarie of a yeare old to make borders about the proportions or
knots; and as for boxe in as much as it is of a naughtie smell, it is to be left off, and
not dealt withall. All the rest of the hearbes, as penniroyall, hyssope, wild thyme,

proportions of quarters without borders, as wel whole as broken, are made. Germander
also is an excellent hearbe for the setting forth of any inward proportion, for it
growes euen and comely, thicke and vpright, so is also mother of thyme, winter-

and pinkes, prouided that with your sheares you keepe them from too much
spreading.
                  The hearbes whereof borders shall bee made, must bee more high and thicke
                        •
                     
set of leaues, than those whereof proportions of quarters either whole or broken
are made, or yet the other which are in the middest of the borders, that so the
beautie and good proportion of the knot or quarter may bee seene and discerned
more easily.
                  I call in these places that the border which compasseth the proportion or quarter
about, as also the alleys of the garden: I call broken quarters, those many small parcels
which are sundred and seperate one from another. The proportions either without
borders or borders, are either equally square in widenesse and length, or else vnequally
squared, that is to say, longer than they are wide, or wider than they are long:
Or else of the forme and shape of an egge: or of a forme and fashion that is mixt of
a round and a square, or of some such other forme, as shall please the gardener: as for
example, the fashion of a flower-deluce, of a true loues knot, of a lion rampant, and
other such like portraitures.
                  That which shall be in the midst of the proportions with borders, or without borders,
shall be of a square forme, or of the fashion of an egge, or round, or mixt of a
square and a round, or some other such like forme.
                  If you be disposed to plant any hearbe in the midst of broken quarters, it must not
bee ouer high, but lesse and shorter than those wherewith the proportions are set,
that so it may not hide or hinder the sight of any part of the quarter. It is true indeed
that in this middlemost part, you may set an hearbe of a meane and middle height,

yea, or some such as for his bignesse may resemble a shrub or little tree, but it may not
be thicke set with leaues, not spreading far abroad, but rather putting forth his stalke
vpright, as doth the Bay and Cypres tree.
                  But in respect of the beautie and comelinesse of the quarter, you must not plant
any thing in it, or if you do plant any herbe, you must see, that it be of a shorter stalke
than that which compasseth it about: the knot that is made of borders, must consist
but of two sorts of herbes: as for example, of Lauander or Rosemarie, or Boxe for
the border, and of Penny-royall of Hissope within. It is true, that in the middest,
and foure corners thereof, there may be set some Cypres, or Rose-marie, or some such
other herbe, or little tree, which is not thicke set with leaues, not spreading far abroad,
but rising in height vpright.
                  But the knot made of broken quarters, may bee made of diuers, and differing
herbes, which notwithstanding may not grow great and tall, because they would
hinder the view of the garden, but they must be short, and thinne set with leaues, as
Sage, Penny-royall, Margerom, Cammomill, Da
                        •
                     sies, Violets, Basill, Rue, and such
others, which herbes shall be planted in diuers quarters, to the setting forth of greater
varietie in the knot, and to giue grace vnto the little quarters. It is true, that within
some round quarters, or squares of broken quarters, you may worke some small birds,
men, or other such pourtraites made of Rose-marie, according to your pleasure, and
inuention of your Gardener.
                  The herbes wherewith proportions are set out and deckt, must bee planted
of rootes or slippes: the time to plant them is Ianuarie, Frebruarie, March and
Aprill.
                  It is true, that if you plant herbes, especially Penny-royall and Lauander vpon

the moneth of Februarie, and not later, because this kind of slip will not bee frozen
by any frost that may happen, and withall, in the meane time, it doth not stand
in neede of watring, because it hath taken roote before the hot times of the yeare
come in.
                  Againe, if you set herbes of the roote, you must stay till March and Aprill,
and looke well vnto it, that your herbes haue 
                        •
                     ound, liuing, and euery way sufficient
rootes, for otherwise, they will not bee able to prosper, spread, and grow in
the earth, but will die for the most part. It is meete also, that when they are planted,
you should water them verie often, because of the heat then growing more and
more euery day, for otherwise they will wither, or grow small and dwarfish, or die
right out.
                  Wherefore for the greater assurednesse, I could wish you to plant your herbes
rather of slippes than of rootes: for besides that, it will bee more easie, and of lesse

                        •
                     harge and cost to purchaseslips, than to purchase the whole herbes with the roots.
I
                        •
                      will be also lesse labour and trauell for to preserue and make to grow the one than
the other: for the slips will assuredly grow without watering, and notwithstanding
any frost, and they will shew faire and thicke leaued, by such time as Sommer shall
begin. To plant within the earth, whether it be root, or slip, you must cast trenches,
rather with some short handled hand-forke, or hand-spade, than with a dibble, which
you shall find a great deale more easie.
                  Behold here the greatest part of the things which you are diligently to looke vnto
before you put your hand to the worke of casting your proportions or knots: and
whereas their whole beautie and commendation doth consist in a well framed and
proportioned forme, and in a well carried and appointed order of disposing them, such as may delight the eie: to the end you may attaine this commendable and well
pleasing kind of proportion in the contriuing of your quarters, you must first cast
what is the space and whole contents of your quarter, wherein you meane to draw
your proportions, that so according to the said contents, you may fit them with
such forme as the place will affoord. After that, you shall haue in your hand many
measures of small cord, and yet sufficient strong: many cord-reeles and dibbles,

and such other things to finish the proportions which you desire to haue drawne in
your quarter.
                  And thus much concerning the meanes which you shall vse in the finishing vp of
a knot with borders. Before you stretch your line to draw and cast the shape of it, you
must first take the bredth and length of the border, and that such as the quantitie of
the ground may conueniently beare, and so make it more long and broad, or else long
and broad accordingly.
                  It is true, that if you haue good ground enough, as about some sixtie foot square, after
the measure of a common foot, euery one containing twelue inches, you may make
your border large enough: but and if you haue lesse quantitie of ground, then you
must make your border lesse, and the proportions at large: you shall so finish vp
your borders, as that in the middest of them, you may haue some prettie little knot.
When you haue cast your ground, you shall begin to stretch your line with good
and firme line-reeles, to take the bredth and length of your borders round about.
Then you shall draw your line a crosse, from the which crosse, and from about the
which said borders, you shall not draw vp your line and line-reeles, vntill you haue
marked out all your border, or at the least one side, or halfe of it, because this is the
directorie, for the whole quarter and border to: this is it, whereby you must be guided
and directed for the making of compasses and largenesse of your squares and
rounds. Furthermore, you may stretch your line in the middest of the border, thereby
to take the iust middest, and that for to direct and guid you. Furthermore, you
shall haue two lines of the length of the border or quarter, and two foot ouer, and
these are called the flying or running lines, for that they serue to carrie or remoue
from place to place, for the planting of herbes in the said borders. Againe, you shall
stretch out a line from corner to corner, because that without such line you cannot
make vp your corners: and this is the manner of making your borders. As concerning
the knot contained within the borders: to take the measure of the proportion
or squares, you must haue two small rods, of the thickenesse of a thombe, of willow,
of some other straight wood, the one eight foot long, and the other betwixt three and
foure, the long one to serue for the largest works, and the short for the smaller: vpon
which rods, you must marke out your proportions, wherof you meane to make your
squares, or any other 
                        •
                     orme that it shall please you to make. For round workes, you
must haue an instrument, commonly called the Gardners Bilboquet, the patterne
whereof you shall see hereafter; but giue it what name it pleaseth you, but this is the
manner of making of it: You shall take a prop or standard, somewhat thicker than
your thombe, you shall put thereto a line of the same thicknesse that your gardening
lines are, of three or foure foot long, or according to the length and greatnesse that
you would haue your rounds of. Vpon this line, shall you make knots, according to
the bignes or outside of the worke, and then another knot for the second or inward
circle of the round, which shall be eight or nine inches, or lesse if you will: but I tell
you before hand, that if you make them any lesse, the border will be ouershadowed,
and will not last and continue so long; and yet I still refer it to your owne discretion.
To euery knot of the said line for to make your rounds withall, you shall make fast,
right ouer against the knot, on the backside thereof, a little sticke some foure fingers
long, more or lesse as you shall most fancie, and of thicknesse of your little finger. By
the meanes of these knots shorter or longer, you shall make your rounds so many, and
so big, or so little, as shall seeme good vnto you. If it may not rather stand with your
liking to make two Bilboquets, one for your smal rounds, and another for your greater.
This figure following, doth shew the forme and fashion that must be followed in
vsing your lines for the making of your quarters with borders. These draughts will
serue also to make a border to broken quarters, with some small whole and vnbroken
proportions in the midst, euen as you see a square in the midst, and shall further hereafter
see it in other portraitures, which shall be set out for your vse. To work the more
surely, you shall let all your lines be stretched out in length, and our standards, props,
or dibbles fast in the ground, vntill such time as you haue throughly finished the border,

that is to say, your crosse lines in the middest, as also those which passe from corner
to corner, and thirdly, those which make the sides of the borders. All which said
lines are noted with the letter B. The others which are marked with the letter A. are
the running or flying lines, which are carried from one place to another to make
middle partitions, to the treading of the rounds, and to the squaring of the said border,
&amp; when as one side is downe, they are then to be taken vp, &amp; to be pitched down
else where. And although that here be foure, yet two is sufficient, at the discretion of
the gardener, who according as his number of workefolkes is, more or lesse, shall
stretch and draw more or fewer lines.

plant any thing in the middest of the quarter, helpe your selfe with the

without putting downe any other standards, or stretching
any other lines than are alreadie: and those you

be had not to cut them, the time of August being once past, by reason of the great

                     e that ensueth in hearbes, which thereby will fall to wither and pine away, and
become as things burned with the Sunne. To cut them which stand in a right and
straight line, you shall stretch a line verie stiffe, being of the length of the proportion,
by the direction whereof you shall cut verie neere first the two sides, and then the
vpper face thereof. As concerning Rounds, you must cut them, for the

Countrey, as round as euer you can. To cut the Border, whether it be of Lauander,
Rosemarie, or Boxe, you must vse the ordinarie sheeres, which haue handles of
wood. To cut other smaller and lesse hearbes, you must haue sheeres like those
which Taylors vse.

                     ,
Prouence Roses, Muske Roses, or anie other fruit or flower that growes shrub-wise,
or not aboue two or three foot aboue the earth: So that whereas your Border containeth
not anie thing but one entire hearbe, as Prympe, Boxe, Hysope, Lauander,
and such like; by this manner of bordering, which is to say, with a Quickset Hedge,
you shall haue not onely all them, but also all kind of fruits, flowers, and sweet smelling
hearbs whatsoeuer: besides, they will keepe your Quarters and Knots in a great
deale more safetie, because they are not so easie to be runne ouer, or broken downe,
either by man, or beast, as your other Borders of hearbes are. Now, for the making
of these Quickset Hedges, it is in this manner: First, you shall with fine small stakes,
cut to the length and proportions of your worke, stake your Quarters about: then
with small poles, bound to those stakes either with strong Wyar, or Oziers (but Wyar
is the better) make a Lattice-worke, about two foot aboue the earth: then with
shorter poles and wands, made plyant for your purpose, fashion your battlements of
what shape soeuer you please to haue them; whether made plaine, or pyllaster-wise, or
in semicircles, or other proportions, in such manner as you intend your Hedge shall
grow: and this done either in Autumne, or the beginning of the Spring. Alongst
the bottome of this Hedge you shall set Prympe, white Thorne, Eglantine, and
sweet Bryer, mixt together, and as they shoot and grow vp, so you shall wind and
plash them within the Lattice-worke, making them grow and couer the same; euer
and anon, as need shall require, either with your Sheeres, or Hooke, cutting them to
that shape and proportion to which you first framed your Lattice-worke, and this
will in two or three yeares bring your Hedge vnto such perfection, that besides the
beautie thereof, the defence will be so good, that you shall not feare the harme that
Dogges, Swine, or other Cattell may doe, if at anie time they shall chance to breake
into your Garden. These Hedges are also verie excellent to set alongst your Alleyes,
or other Walkes, and adde a great beautie thereunto. There be some that make these
Hedges onely of Oziers, or small Sallowes, planted crosse-wise, or otherwise, as your
inuention pleaseth, and these Hedges are good, and beautifull, and verie speedie in
their growing, but they are not of any very long continuances: therefore, except your
ground be very moist, the former Hedge is much the better. Which that you may the
better know how to make, I will here set you downe the models of a couple of them;

by the example whereof, you may at your pleasure make anie other proportion
whatsoeuer: and you shall also vnderstand, that these two Models containe but
the dead worke onely, which is to be made of Poles or Wands, and the Quickset
to be planted close vnto it, and so placed within the dead Lattice-worke, as you
may here perceiue.

                  Of the manner to keepe and preserue Hearbes, either for the vse
of the Pot, or of Physicke, or such as are of a sweet
smell and sauour.
                  
                     THe root of Elecampane is preserued after this sort:The preseruing of the root of Elecampane. When you haue taken
vp the root in the moneth of October, at such time as it is verie
ripe, you must first take away all the sand and earth which is about it
with a rough Linnen Cloth, or with a Strainer: after that, you must
scrape it all ouer with a verie sharpe knife, and according as the rootes are of bignesse,
to cleaue them in two, three, moe or lesse pieces, of a fingers length, and boyle
them in a Brasse Cauldron with vineger, and that in such sort, as that the slices may
not burne within the Cauldron. Three daies after they must be dried in the Sunne,
and put into a new pot well pitched, and cuted wine put vnto them, and that so
much, as that they may be couered therewith, and a good deale of Sauorie pressed
downe vpon them, and then the vessell close shut vp and couered well with leather.
Otherwise: You must carefully looke that the rootes thereof be made verie
cleane, and then cut in two or three pieces, of a fingers length: then afterward,
for the space of a whole day together, you must infuse them in water vpon
hot embers, and afterward boyle them with twice or thrice as much Honey,
or Sugar.

flowers of the hearbes, put them in an earthen pot or glasse, and after poure into them

in conserues; for in conserues they are powned with Sugar, which doth rebate verie
much the naturall smell of the leaues or flowers.

Beere or Ale, or with Butter-milke; onely the Beere will make it eat a little bitter

if there be withall presented vnto the sight the view of strange and Countrey-borne
trees, both great and small; which doe not onely yeeld a more pleasant smell, without
comparison, than the hearbes, but doe also (the greatest part of them) bring

dyrtie, and moist places, and on the tops and sides of Hills where the Sunne shineth,

goodly and so tall a tree. When you sow it, you must sow it in furrowes, from after
the twentieth of October vntill Winter: and neere vnto it, some Barly; for there
is such great familiaritie betwixt these two seeds, that they grow (as it were) in spight
one of another: whereupon it will come to passe, that when it is a great Barly yeare,
it will be also a great Cypresse yeare. If you remoue it, doe the like: but be carefull
in the meane time not to water it, nor to pr

close and straight together, and bringeth forth Fruit, or Nuts, but so doth not the
female.

haue said of Melons: the laying of the earth light about it spoken of before, is to be
vnderstood of the time of his young yeares, and whiles it is growing: for after it hath
once perfected his sciences and bowes, it hath no more need either of that or any other
labour and helpe. It is wont to be remoued being betwixt fiue and sixe yeares
old, and that in March or in Aprill, and because it scattereth and spreadeth abroad
his roots, and pearceth not farre downeward with them, the pit whereinto it is to
be remoued must be made wide, and that somewhat more than it selfe is broad in the
roots, and in a moist countrie it must be but a little depth, vvhereas in a drie countrie
it may be two foot deepe. The Gardener must be carefull to keepe it from ants,
because this little vvorme loueth Cypres aboue all other things, and causeth it oftentimes
to die.

long time without corrupting, moulding, or rotting any thing at all, and it is such
an enemie to all vvormes and vermine, as that the leaues and nuts thereof being laied
amongst clothes, doe free them of vvormes. The leaues and seed are verie much
commended for the killing of vvormes in children. The decoction of the nuts in
vinegar doe assuage the tooth-ach, if the mouth be often washed therewith: the decoction
of the leaues vvorketh the like effect: the ashes of Cypres nuts, and the horn

euerie day the quantitie of three ounces, but in the meane time they must rub their
testiicles vvith the leaues of Cypres brayed and beaten: and this is a certaine remedie,
such as hath oft beene experimented and tried: the like vertue hath the young
sciences of the Cypres-tree, if they be so chawed, as that thereupon their juice may
descend into the bodie.

the Rose vvill craue no manure, but yeeld a more perfect smell, but and if it be spent

                  As for Roses there be manie sorts of them, that is to say, the vvild ones, vvhich we
call Eglantine, and the red also growing in hedges: Damaske of the colour of Scarlet,
vvhich vve call Prouence Roses: and amongst the braunches, besides the vvild

they loosen the bellie. Looke further in the third Booke in the Chapter of the speciall

                  Of Hearbes for the Arbours of the Garden.
                  
                     FOr want of trees of low growth (such as haue beene spoken of here before)
you may helpe your selfe in the making of your Arbours for your
Garden of Pleasure,
                        
                           〈…〉
                        . with certaine hearbes which are plyant, and with
their leaues apt to make shadow, still prouided, that they be borne vp
by poles of Willow, or Iuniper, dressed and ordered in forme, and after the manner
of Arbours: They are such as follow; the wild Vine, Hoppes, Gourds, Cucumbers,
the maruellous Pease, Winter Cherries, the maruellous Apples, and other
such like.
                  And as concerning the wild Vine, it groweth more plentifully than a man would
wish amongst the Brambles and Bushes: and therefore from hence it may be transplanted
and remoued into your Garden for the benefit of your Arbours. The root,
especially the iuice, doth mightily loosen the bellie, prouoke vrine, purge the braine,
open the spleene, and take away the hardnesse thereof: applyed in forme of a Pessarie,
it bringeth downe the termes, the after-birth, and dead child: stamped with salt,
and applyed, it healeth vlcers, it cleanseth the skinne, and taketh away the red pimples
of the face: for which purpose also serueth the water thereof, which you may
gather in the moneth of May out of a pit which you shall make in the head of the
root, as it standeth in the ground, according as we haue alreadie said in the Chapter
of Violets going before. In a Cataplasme it is singular against the Sciatica, as also
to take away the haire from some place: being mixed and stamped with Bulls
bloud, it is of maruellous effects in hard and schirrous swellings, and cankerou

needfull to make any new repetition.
                  The ordering of hopsHops. is like vnto that of the wild vine, for one and the same
ground and dressing vvill serue both. The flowers, crops, and juice pressed out, doe

                  Maruailous applesMaruailous apples. are verie fit to ouerspread arbours, as well in respect of their
beautie, as for that they are pliant, and winding easily about the poles. They would
be sowne in the Spring time, in a fat and well battilled ground: they cannot endure
the cold: so soone as their fruit is ripe, which is in Autumne, they drie away
by and by: wherefore you must sow them where the Sunne hath full power vpon

them, and water them oft in the time of great heat, gathering their fruit in September.

from cold, which although the boughes and braunches should be dead
by the cold of Winter, it would yet continue to bring forth new boughes in the

vnto it, that so the roots of the Caper-tree and thereby all shoots that might
grow vp from them, may be kept from breaking forth, and spreading further than
this ditch: for if they should be stayed and kept backe from spreading by some such
meanes, it would come to passe that within a small time they would ouer-runne the
whole Garden, and plant themselues in euerie corner of the same. Notwithstanding
the Caper-tree is not so noysome in that respect (because it may be pulled vp)
as it is by inueniming (I know not by what venimous humour or juice) the whole
ground, and making of it barren. It hath no need (except a ver

prouoke appetite, cleanse the flegmaticke stomach, and to take away the obstructions
of the liuer, but principally of the spleene: the rind of the root and leaues haue
the like vertue, but more effectually. Capers both the great and the small, whiles
they are yet greene and not salted, doe nourish a great deale more, both of them are
in request, not so much for that they are fruit, as for their manner of preseruing,
which is performed either with vinegar, or else with salt brine: for Capers not pickled
are of a verie sharpe and vnpleasant tast, but the vinegar wherein they are preserued
doth make them verie acceptable vnto the stomach: but the great ones because
they haue both more juice and more pulpe, are a great deale better than the
little ones: though the little ones are more delightsome to the tast than the great ones,
because they are fuller of vinegar than the great ones.

as in Languedoc and Prouence, where it may be seene growing (as it were) in little
Forests: and it is so long liued, and of such durablenesse, as that though the labour
due to be bestowed about it, be left off for a long time, yet it ceaseth not to beare fruit
more or lesse: and comming to it selfe againe, being old, it becommeth young againe,

plant the Oliue tree in your Garden, chuse out a place standing vpon the South or
East quarter, raysed sufficient high, and open to the Westerne wind, and which hath
also rested a good while, consisting of Potters clay vnderneath, and aboue mingled

halfe long, verie round, hauing a sleeke and glistering barke, without boughes, and
cut downe in the new of the Moone, raysing the thicke barke about the length of a
fathome, and letting the greene barke alone, which is more fine and thinne▪ And
you shall set them in the ground in such manner as they did grow vpon the tree; as
the lower end downward, and the vpper end vpward towards Heauen, as when they
grew vpon the tree: for if you set them the vpper end downeward▪ they will hardly
grow; but and if they grow, yet they will abide barren for euer. You must lay the
root, as also the head, all ouer with dung mixt with ashes, and set them on such a
depth in the earth, as that there may be aboue them some foure fingers thicknesse of
fine small mould, and afterward tread all close downe together, round about the
new-set Plant, and so cast still more earth vnto it, as it sinketh with treading, or else
you may beat it downe with a rammer of wood. It must not be transplanted till after
fiue yeares: but in the meane time you must digge it euerie moneth, and dung it
with Goats dung euerie yeare in Autumne. You must water it with raine water, rather
than with Fountaine, Riuer, or Well water. And sometimes you must prune

the branches putting forth vpon it, if so be that the plant be not become old, feeble,
and broken, in such sort, as that it standeth in need to be renewed and planted againe,
for then it will be requisite to leaue growing one or two of the fairest, and not to cut
them downe before they haue growne eight yeares, and then at such time as the
Moone is decreasing, and the season drie and faire. And sometimes, euerie eight
yeare, you must moisten the root of the Oliue trees, that are lustie and well liking,
with the lees or grounds of Oliues, to keepe them from wormes and other vermine,
which are oftentimes noysome vnto this Plant. You must also defend them from

Cattell, especially from the browsing of Goats, which would make them altogether
barren. You must not plant anie other Plants neere vnto the Oliue tree, except the
Figge-tree, or the Vine, whose companie and neighbourhood it reioyceth greatly
in, and hateth especially the Oake, yea, euen to be planted in the place where the
Oake was standing, and is pulled vp, for there it dieth presently. The Oliue tree
may be grafted in the bud with that kind of grafting called the Scutcheon, and that
of the thickest and strongest grafts that may be pickt out of the Oliue tree, as we will

for feare of beating downe some of the branches, together with the fruit: but such
manner of gathering Oliues is not good, because the Oliues beaten downe, or strucken,
doe wither incontinently, and doe not yeeld so much oyle: put also vnto this discommoditie,
that other; which is, that the tree is bruised, and manie of his branches
broken, which is a great hinderance in the yeares following.
                  Furthermore, Oliues are gathered for two ends, either to make Oyles,Oliues serue to make Oyle of, and to serue as Table. or to sent
as dishes at Banquets, to the end that they may prouoke appetite: notwithstanding,
wee must not thinke that all sorts of Oliues indifferently doe serue for these

As concerning Oliues to make Oyle of,The gathering of Oliues to make Oyle of. they must be gathered when they are
somewhat more ripe than those which are to be preserued, and when as there are manie

they must be gathered in such manner as wee haue said that the others should
be gathered, that is to say, with the hand, and when it is faire weather, except it be

must no moe be gathered at one time, than may be made into Oyle that night and the
day following: for all the fruit that is gathered in a day, must presently be put vpon
the Milles, and so into the Presses. But before that they be put into the Presse, they
must first be spread vpon hurdles, and picked and culled: as likewise, that their

vnto the Oyle: insomuch, as that if it remaine, abide, and stand with the Oyle, it
spoyleth the tast and sauour of it. And therefore in this respect, when sometimes
the quantitie of Oliues is so great, as that there want Presses and workmen to dispatch
them, you must haue a high and well-raysed floore, where you must prouide
partitions to keepe asunder euerie daies gatherings: and these partitions, in the bot

and starue through that of the North) and a little vpon the West, in such sort, as that
they may be guarded on the back part, and both sides, but specially the Citron-tree,
which is the most tender of all the other. For which considerations, it will not be amisse
to set them neere vnto some wall; of a conuenient height, to the end they may
haue a rampart against the Northerne parts: and for the more certainetie, to make
them a hood and flankers of Bay trees, for the encrease both of the beautifulnesse, as
also of the profit of the same: for some hold, that the companie of the Bay tree doth
keepe the Orange tree from frost. These Bay trees shall be planted in double chesse,
that so the thinnest places of the first may be amended by the thickest places of the
second: but and if you haue not Bay trees to doe it withall, then you may take Cypresse
trees. And here you must learne, that Orange-trees loue not the companie
of anie other tree but of the fore-named, and of the Myrtle-tree. The best of all,
and most assured for profit, were to plant the said Orange-trees, Citron-trees, and
other such like Trees, in halfe Barrels or Vessels, of earth made for the purpose (they
being the chiefe pleasures of Princes and great Lords) or else in Cases, that are wide
below, and narrow aboue, builded of clouen boords, verie well ioyned and fitted
together, in such sort, as that no shoots may grow through them: for the earth, by
reason of the oft watering of it, doth not cease continually to cause them to put forth
and breake out one way or other. But that such watering may be conueyed in best
sort for their growth, it must be prouided and brought by some low conduit and
passage, and the surplusage carried away by some such cocke as is vsed in Lee tubs:
and such, or the like Vessels, must be made to carrie into anie place whatsoeuer a man
will: for seeing that these Plants doe die, if they be touched neuer so little with
frost, as being most tender and daintie of their naturall inclination, it must be looked
vnto in Winter, after that they are well couered and compassed about with
straw, or the stalkes of Gourds (for by a naturall contrarietie they are giuen to let
and hinder the frost from hurting them) that they be conueyed vpon small Wheele-barrowes
into vaulted Caues, and when Summer is come, to returne and bring them
backe againe into the full and open Sunne, to be nourished and refreshed by the
heat thereof. Then hauing found out such a place in the Garden (as wee haue
spoken of) there shall PitsHoles, or Pits. be cast with distances betwixt: and whereas the Orange-tree
doth shoot out his roots deepe into the earth, you must cast the said Pits a good
fadome deepe, and a fadome and a halfe in compasse, which shall be well broken
and made soft, that so the root may rest and spread it selfe at pleasure: which Pits
shall grow narrower by little and little towards their top, and where they are to
embrace and close in the foot of the tree. These Pits, to doe well, should be kept
open a yeare, or thereabout, if it were possible, for the well seasoning of them, which
by manie Sunne-shines, and manie Raines, would be effected: but there may more
speed be made with them, either by couering the places of the said Pits with well

if the time and season be not rainie, or by filling vp the said Pits with Wheat
straw, or with small Vine branches, burning it all, and afterward watering the ashes
which shall remaine, if the season be drie, and without raine: for within eight or
tenne daies after this preparing of it, the said Pits will be well seasoned. About the
end of the same time, you must againe breake and soften the earth of the seat of the
said Trees, and the sides thereof, and lay into them a finger thicknesse of dung, and
againe, vpon this dung, the like thicknesse of good mould, and then vpon it to set
the Tree, in the verie same aspect of the Sunne, if it be possible, that it stood in before
the taking vp; that is to say, that euerie part of the tree stand vpon the same quarters
of the Heauens that it did before: for otherwise it would not serue, if the

moisture rising of the continued shadow: and then againe, when the Sunne goeth
downe, and falleth off, you must stop them vp againe, that so the cold may not take
hold vpon them. It will not likewise be amisse to make a fire there, during the extreame
cold times, of good drie Wood, or Coale, because the heat thereof would be
great, and continue well, without working anie annoyance vnto the plants, either by
his flame or smoake: and this to be most chiefely performed in the behalfe of the Citron-trees,
which are most subiect vnto the cold of all other, the cause being, for that
they haue in them greatest store of iuice and substance; as on the contrarie, they are
least subject to cold which haue least iuice and substance in them. Againe, you may
not be too hastie in vncouering of them, vpon some shew and promise of gentle,
meeke, and faire weather, because the cold oftentimes faining it selfe to be gone, returneth
againe in more vehement manner than before, threatning the killing of them,
onely it will be the best and safest to open some boord or window of their lodging,
that so the tree
                        •
                      may enioy the present heat of the Sunne for certaine houres. In the
time of the couering of these new translated trees, you must not forget to renew them
at the foot a cubit height with good earth, enriched with good rotten dung, and that
to lye round about the said foot the breadth of a good fadome: and this will serue
and stand in stead, in case that by extremitie of cold the bodie of the tree should be
frozen, to refresh and repaire it againe from below, where the frost shall not haue
pierced it; notwithstanding, if in such extraordinarie cold seasons you couer and lay
ouer their former couering with other dung well rotted, you shall preserue the said
Orange trees. Their grafts (whereof wee are to speake hereafter) are a great deale
more tender and more easie to be broken by the cold and frost, and therefore they
must be couered at the foot, and layd high with earth, and as it were cloaked or hooded,
and double couered and cloathed, as hath beene said, and that a great deale
higher, that so it may not be pinched in the place of the setting in of the graft. But
and if the cleft, or other receit made for the setting in of the graft, be so high, that
the said prouision and defence cannot conueniently be applyed vnto it, you must
then couer such chase with thicke new cloth, being well woolled, or else with straw,
and to tye the one or the other fast to, by wreathing it about with one of the breadths
of a Mat, and stay it vp with a prop, if need be. In hot Countries, as Spaine and
Portugall, it is held as an approoued opinion, That by how much the more Orange
trees are watered in Winter, so much the lesse subiect are they to frost; because their
water is either out of the Well, or fresh drawne from some Fountaine, or of water
broken out of the earth, and made warme with the Sunne, or with the fire, and for
that it is drunke vp all into the earth: but I feare me, that it would not fall out for
well done, if so be that in this cold Countrey one should take that course: notwithstanding,
if you will vse the same order, you shall doe it either by the helpe of the
foresaid Sunne beames, or by a pipe of Lead, laid good and deepe in the earth, a farre
off from the root of the tree, powring of the said water into it, that so it may descend
and reach vnto the roots: but so soone as you haue thus powred in your water, you
must stop verie well and couer the said pipe with earth and dung, that so the cold
ayre may not runne along it vnto the roots, for so they would be frozen. They must
be vnder-digged and cast at the foot from moneth to moneth, if the season will suffer
it, and the earth made light and soft, mingling it with dung, and watering it as hath
beene said. And for the better preseruing of the branches of these plants, and keeping
of them in their strength and force, they must be cut euerie yeare, more or lesse, according
as the good and expert Gardiner shall iudge it necessarie, in as much as these
trees, being both daintie and precious, doe require a verie carefull regard to be vsed
in this cutting. It must not furthermore be forgotten to take from them continually
all manner of superfluitie, filth, and grasse, growing at their foot, or elsewhere; and
likewise thornes or pricks, and that with the hands, or some other cutting yron: And
if anie branch, through

the dead part at the Spring in the decrease of the Moone, in faire weather, and
calme and temperate, and vpon the putting of it forth againe, and this must be

done with a Garden Sickle or Knife well sharpened, and the cut must be well

would be planted neere vnto some wall, and haue their boughes bowed downward,

clefts and chaps in their bodies, without anie danger: and therein they are like

it yeeldeth scarce at any time any great store of increase: but if you will sow it, then
bestow the like quantitie of the seed thereof vpon an acre, as you are wont to doe of
Hempe, and that in the moneth of March, vpon the tops of hills well battilled and

with harrows of rakes, there is no need of any other labour but keeping of it cleane
from hurtfull weeds, vntill such time as the said Madder be readie to be gathered in
September for to take the seed of it.
                  The choyce of the roots which you intend to set and plant, must be out of the countrie
of high Prouence, being more Easterly and coole, and as for the sight and tast of
them, they must be more yellow, thicke, and stringed, comming neere vnto the colour
of the true Prouence Orange-tree, verie bitter in tast, and in seething (for the
triall of it) more red and full of juice, that is to say, not so drie and withered. The
time to plant, is from March be ended vnto mid-May, and as for the best and most
profit to be expected from it, it is not to be attained or come by, till after the two first
yeares after the first planting of it: and withall, you must make a sure defence about
your ground against the comming in of cattell; for there can no greater hurt happen
vnto it. In Italie they vse not to take vp the roots of Madder, till after they haue
continued ten yeares in the ground, either set or sowne: but they cut the boughes of

to fall thereupon, yet it may by no meanes sinke into the Hiue, but

                      must be
some building, or else at the least a wall, which may be vnto them in stead of a

the cold by this building, yet they must be turned vpon the East in Winter, rather
than vpon the South (because if they were turned toward the South, they would be
layd fore vpon by excessiue heat in Summer.) to the end, that in the morning the
Bees, for their earlier comming forth, may haue the Sunne hot vpon them, for their
better wakening; whereas otherwise, the cold would make them heauie and slouthfull:
and therefore the holes by which they pa
                        ••

                     -little,
that so they may not giue place for the entrance of much cold, and they will be sufficient
great, if to be there may but one Bee passe. Againe, by this meanes it will be
prouided for, that neither the venimous Stellion, nor the villanous Beetill, neither
yet the Butterflies, shall possibly enter to rob the Hiues and Honey-combes. And
moreouer, according to the quantitie of Bees in the Hiue, you must make in the same
hatch two or three holes, one somewhat distant from another, that they may passe in
thereby, as also for the deceiuing of the Lizards, which would, by reason of their
watch, kill them as they came forth, if they had but one hole in all. It is further
meet, that the shelter vnder which the Hiues shall stand, be well appointed for little
open windowes, which you shall, stop in Winter with Paper windowes, or Tyles,
and that in such order, as that they may be easily opened when the Sunne shineth,
and shut after that the Bees are returned home into their Hiues: and yet there must
be holes in the said Paper lights, that so they may passe forth along at their pleasure
whither they are disposed. Yet this is a curiositie seldome or neuer vsed amongst 
                        〈◊〉
                     
masters: and therfore, in mine opinion, if you keepe them close, without any more than
their ordinarie dores to passe in &amp; out at, it wil be best: and these do
                        •••

of a fine thin board, or a piece of an old worne trencher, cut in this maner 
                        
                           
                        
                     
and so fixed into the bottome of the Hiue, on that side on which the
Sunne most commonly riseth: and all these dores you shall keepe open from the later
end of Aprill till September: but after, which is the dead time of Winter, you
shall close them vp, and keepe but one open at the most, and that no bigger, then a
Bee may well passe through the same.

                        〈…〉
                     
them, you must conuey them, betwixt place and place, some other way that by
highwayes, and that the rather in the Spring than in Winter, as also verie

for feare of shaking them. It will be good to take them before day, and to carrie
them away at night vpon his necke, or rather it is better that two men should beare
them: for in the day time they must be let rest, and haue giuen vnto them some sweet
liquor, that so they may haue to feed vpon, though they be kept within. And when
they are brought to the place of their abode, you must not open them vntill the next
day at night, to the end, that after they haue rested all night, they may be the fitter
to come forth peaceably in the morning: although yet it were better not to alter or
change anie thing about them for the space of three daies, but to stop vp the mouth
with some thinne cloth, vntill the Sunne haue shone, and in the euening after to
open them.
                  There is no such carefull heed taken in the chusing of those which are giuen,Choice of Bees which are gathered in the Forests. nor
yet of those which haue beene taken or gathered in the Fields or Forests, although I
could aduise men to the contrarie, seeing the charges and paines are as great about
the bad as the good. Notwithstanding, when one gathereth them, it is not possible to
make such choice as he would: and therefore he must be content with that which
commeth next to hand; and yet not to be negligent to purchase and get the best that
may be come by, and to take good heed not to mingle the good and the bad together,
for so the bad would dishonour the good, and there would be a great deale lesse
honey, because of the bad and slouthfull ones which are mingled amongst them. The
gathering of them shall be after this fashion: When you haue found anie place, by
which great numbers of Bees doe passe (which is commonly in Woods and Forests
where Hearbes doe abound, and Trees of sweet smell, neere vnto some small Riuer
or Fountaine) you shall vse all diligence to find out the place of their rest and abode,
which you may easily learne after their hauing beene at water, whether it be neere or

                        〈…〉
                     , by the place whither they torne: then afterward, in the beginning of the
Spring, you must take Balme and Thyme bruised, with other such like hearbs which
Bees loue, and therewith annoint your Hiue so throughly, as that the smell and iuice
thereof may stay behind: after that, you shall make the Hiue cleane, and sprinkle it
with a little honey: and hauing thus handled it, you shall set it downe in the Woods
or Forests, neere vnto the Springs, and when it is full of Bees, you shall carrie it home.
And thus much of gathering swarmes of Bees.

other kind of liuing creature: yea, seeing she hath a kind of wisdome comming neere

soone as they can flye, desire nothing more than to flye away, and not to abide with
the old ones, and much lesse to become subiect vnto them) it will be meet to keepe
watch verie diligently, and that from after the morning tide is past, till two houres
after noone, that so they may not flye vnto some other place. Wherefore if you can
discerne and spie out their Kings,Kings of Bees. it will be good to take their wings from them, if

                  Of the manner of gathering Honey.
                  
                     FOr the gathering of Honey, about which there is so much labour taken
continually,The gathering of Honey. it is chiefely effected at three seuerall times of the yeare,
as shortly after the Spring, all the Summer, and in the beginning of Autumne.
But there cannot anie prefixed day or certaine time be appointed
for the same, seeing it dependeth of the finishing of the Combes: for and if you
draw-them out before they be throughly wrought, the Bees grow malecontented, and
cease to worke anie more, by reason of the thirst which they endure. The time of
gathering Honey is knowne, by the Bees their no more making of a great noyse, but

                     rning the same into a soft and low buzzing: as also, if the holes which are aboue in
the vessels be stopped with Wax: if the Bees driue out the Drones, which are like
vnto Bees, but a greater beast, and altogether vnprofitable, and without taking of any
paine; for they gather no food, but eat vp that which others bring in. The houre of
taking the Combes, is commonly in the morning, for it is not good to disquiet and
trouble them in the heat of the day: and this must be done with two yron instruments
or kniues; the one whereof must be long and narrow, for the cutting away of the
Combes; and the other, for the scraping away and pulling out of the filth that shall
be fallen into them. It will doe well to moisten these two tooles oftentimes in water,
that so the Wax may not sticke vnto them, and that the Bees which shall be abiding
within, may not be hurt. The vessels may not altogether be emptied, and so all the
fruit taken out, but there must be left remaining (as it were) the tenth part, or (as others
say) the fifth part, as well in the Spring, as in Summer; but in Autumne two parts
must be left, and the third onely taken, for by this meanes you shall not much discontent
them: and withall, you shall leaue aboundantly behind for them to eat and
feed vpon. The gathering of Honey most commonly vsed, and most reasonable, is
but to take the most ripe Combes, and those which are best perfected, and withall, of
them but two thirds. If the Hiue be halfe full of Honey, then there is but the halfe of
that to be taken away: and if it be vnder halfe full, then there must be taken from it
with discretion proportionably. Furthermore, you must make them come forth
with the smoake of Neats dung, or of a Wolfes bladder, or Galbanum or wild Mallowes;
and with the iuice of this hearbe must he be annointed which shall gather
the Honey, to keepe him that he be not stung: or to make him bold, let him take

of a most fine and close-wrought Kall, like vnto Net-worke, for by this meanes a
man shall see at his pleasure that which he goeth about to doe, and yet be free from

hereof, the Combes must be set one against another in a Willow or
Ozier basket, wrought verie cleare, and fashioned like an Hypocras
bagge, after that you haue once cleansed away from the Combes the feed
of young brood, and all manner of other filth: and when the Honey shall be runne
through the basket into a bason that shall be set vnder it, you must put it into an earthen
vessell, which must for some small time be left open, till it haue done boyling
and casting sorth of his froth by staying in the same: this done, the pieces and lumps
of Combes shall be taken out of the basket, and pres

out of them, but not so good as the former, which must be put by it selfe, that so the
pure, and that which is indeed verie excellent, may not be corrupted thereby.
After that the remainder of the Combes is throughly pressed out, and washed in
sweet water, they shall be cast into a Copper vessell with some water, and so set vpon
a soft fire to melt. This Wax thus melted, shall be strained, letting it runne out
into water, and then being melted againe, with water you shall make it vp into what forme you will.

                  Of planting of shoots of a yeares growth.
                  
                     PRopagating or planting of Trees is fittest for such as haue beene planted
of siences, and such as doe put forth siences and small shoots from their
roots: for this causeth them to beare a more beautifull fruit, and more aboundantly,
and more durable, because they attract and draw a greater
quantitie of iuice out of the earth. For this cause, Plum-trees, Cherrie-trees, Pomegranate-trees,
and all other Garden-trees, that are wont to be grafted vpon wild ones,
would be propagated or planted: for in as much as the wild one doth not draw such
and so much iuice as the grafted tree doth require, it is necessarie that it should be
planted. As and if a sweet Cherrie-tree should be grafted vpon a wild Cherrie-tree,
or one that beareth verie sowre Cherries, such a Cherrie-tree would not continue
and last long, neither indeed will it beare anie sweet Cherries, if it be not
planted a yeare or two after that it is grafted: and the reason hereof is, because
the wild Cherrie-tree draweth not iuice ynough to cause the tree to grow, and
withall, the iuice which it doth draw, is not so familiar or fit to bring forth and nourish
sweet Cherries.
                  There are foure sorts of planting or propagating:To plant

hereafter: or vpon a little ladder: or in a basket of earth tied to the bottome of the

hole, as shall be fully declared in the Chapter of Grafting.

                     ers seasons for to propagate in:The time of propagating. but the best, is in the Spring
and March, when the trees are in flowers, and begin to grow lustie. The young planted
siences, or little grafts, must be propagated in the beginning of Winter a foot
deepe in the earth, and good manure mingled amongst the earth, which you shall cast
forth of the pit wherein you meane to propagate it, to tumble in vpon it againe. In
like manner the superfluous siences must be cut close by the earth, when as they grow
about some speciall impe which wee meane to propagate, for they would doe nothing
but rot.
                  For to propagate, you must digge the earth round about the tree, that so the roots
may be in a manner halfe layd bare; afterward draw into length the pit on that side
where you meane to propagate, and according as you perceiue that the roots will be
best able to yeeld and be gouerned in the same pit, so vse them, and that with all gentlenesse,
and stop close your sience in such sort, as that the wreath, which is in the
place where it was grafted, may be a little lower than the sience of the new wood
growing out of the earth, euen so high as it possibly may be. If the tree that you
would propagate, should be somewhat thicke, and thereby the harder to plie, and
somewhat stiffe to lay in the pit, then you may cut the stocke almost to the middest
betwixt the root and the wrythen place, and so with gentle handling of i

compasse as you can, keeping you from breaking of it; afterward, lay ouer the cut
with gummed wax, or with grauell and sand.
                  If there be manie siences and impes in the plant which you would encrease, multiplie,
and propagate, and that all of them by hap or casualtie doe breake in propagating
of them, the remedie will be, to set the tree straight vp, and to couer the roots

the Winter following you may propagate: but and if of all those siences there remaine
some one not broken, goe forward and propagate it, cutting close by the

ground some of the wrythen place, and of those shoots which are not broken. In
propagating of them, see that you lay good quantitie of the siences of your branches
into the pit, couch them there verie round, couering them with the earth which you
cast vp in making the pit, after that you haue first mixt it with good fat

tread it downe by little and little aboue, and looke that none of the said siences doe
rise againe after you haue so troden them downe. This being done,

that is to say, betwix

and of a good age, hauing a hard and firme barke: There is a second way to graftin
                        •
                     
a cleft, that is to say, vpon a stock that is clouen; and this must be vsed in young

                     ,
for old ones doe not easily admit anie cleft in their stocke: The third way is to graft
in a whistle, or pipe; and this is by taking the barke of one tree, cut in manner of a

                     pe, to be fastened to the bough of another tree: The fourth is to graft the

in his proper and fit place. Before we goe about to graft anie thing, we must consider
whether the ground or countrey be fit for Pippins, or stones, and what trees are
best laden there.

                     t the same kinds together, although grafts and buds may take as
well in trees of diuers kinds, but then such grafts come not to so good an end, seeing
it is impossible, that two differing sappes should agree, sute, and carrie themselues so
well in all points the one toward the other, as and if it were in 
                        〈◊〉
                      that are 
                        〈◊〉
                     ,
of like sort: Adde hereunto, that the fruit doth retaine and follow the nature of the
tree whereupon it shall be grafted, rather than the graft, and so, after a sort, becommeth
degenerate and estranged from his owne nature: which maketh me, that 
                        〈◊〉
                      regard
not the grafts which are wont to be made vpon Elmes, for the fruit that groweth
thereon, doth keepe the tast and fauour of the Elme, which is not verse toothsome:
and yet I set lesse by the grafts chat are grafted vpon the Colewort stalke, or
the white Thorne, or Gooseberrie tree, Vine branches, Rose trees, or such like: for
besides that such grafts are nothing durable (as being made vpon a subiect of a more
feeble and vnfirme nature than the graft it selfe which is set to them, wherefore the
contrarie course is that which is to be followed at all times in grafting) the fruits that
come thereof, will be either of no 
                        •
                     ast, or else verie vnfauorie in the eating. Notwithstanding,
although the hardest and most solide young plants be to be preferred in
the matter of grafting: yet so it is, that if you graft in young stockes of a soft and
moist nature, as vpon the Poplar and Beech tree, and such like, the graft will grow
the sooner, but there is not anie profit arising: and such grafts are not dealt in by anie
but by Gardiners, which either affect curiositie or deceit, as desiring to haue grafts
often, rather than for anie thing else. It were better therefore to graft in trees of the
same kind, or else if you should graft in trees of diuers kind, yet to chuse those which

                        〈…〉
                      vnto the nature of the graft, which is the commanding partie, and whereunto
the plant should verie neerely assist and be commaunded by, notwithstanding
that it is the feeder of the other. And in anie case you must graft the trees that
beare timely fruits vpon others that beare timely fruit, and the late fruits vpon the
late fruits.
                  And although that by the assistance and helpe of grafting, men bring in infinite

shall thinke good, alwaies foreseene, that the grafts be gathered in the old of the
Moone, euen all the grafts that may be. It is true, that the graft and the bud doe take
better in the new than in the old of the Moone, for the Moone is the

sappes, as of all other iuices, marrowes, and humours, or moist things; which sappes
runne betwixt the plant and the graft, and bind the one to the other, being of more
force and power in the new of the Moone than in the old: by the like reason there is
a precept to be obserued and kept in the matter of grafting, forbidding to graft, the
wind blowing at South, because such winds are sharpe and drying. On the

grafts may be done at any time of the Moone, as we will declare hereafter.

the sap binding, and ioyning together of the grafts with the plants, and from the dominion
and rule of the Moone ouer the said saps, doth shut out the first part of that
opinion: it being certaine and true, that the weaker the Moone is, so much the

the fruit of the graft will be which is grafted vpon a tree which blossometh and

after some small showers of rane. And if the Summer be so exceedingly drie, as that
some trees doe detaine and keepe backe their sappe, then you must wait till that it be
returned, and then to graft thereupon so soone as the grafts are gathered, without hauing
anie regard either vnto the new Moone, or to the old, whether it be in grafting in

much fruit by grafting in the new of the Moone, but in the old, beginning the first

considered whether the tree vse to beare timely fruit, or not, and so to fit it with a graft

whether it be forward, or backward; for the seasons are not in all yeares gouerned and
carried by an vnchangeable and vnvariable line and measure, for either they are more
forward or backward, and participate oftentimes one of anothers qualitie. And in all
the sorts of grafting, it is a singular thing, and of great preseruation for the graft, to
keepe the plants with Cowes dung mingled with straw.

stocke of the plant: and likewise, let it be so flatted, as that by measure it may be all
one in length with the elest of the plant, when it is put downe into it; and yet it is not
required, that it should ioyne close with the same in all places.

better than and if it should be so ordered also on the other side, and cut byas, as wedges
are which are made for to cleaue wood withall; and so at the end you should take
downe both sides, after the manner of the head of a Speare.
                  In cutting your graft, you must looke well, that you raise not the vttermost barke
from the wood, and that withall, you leaue it thicker than that which is on the
other edge within.

                  Of the preparing of the young Plant whereon you
meane to graft.
                  
                     NOw when you haue chosen your Graft, you must likewise make choice of
your Plant: which, that it may be a faire one, must be right and streight,
round, not wreathen, of a beautifull colour, a sound, near, and smooth
barke, without knots, verie flourishing and moist, and of a tree that hath
borne fruit. It must also enjoy the like good soyle and situation it did before in the
place where you gathered the graft, if it be possible: it must bud and blossome at
one and the same time, to the end that the new sience may take the more easier
footing and kinder nourishment there. And if in case the Plant were wreathen,
ioyne the graft cunningly vnto it, and be sure, that in fitting of it you make them
both ioyne well together, and euer matching the grossest Plants with the grossest
Grafts.
                  And in as much as the Plants are verie little, therefore you must cut them low and
neere vnto the earth, and that rather with a Knife than with a Hooke or Saw. Some
say, that a Saw doth so shake and loosen the barke, as that afterward it doth not
take so easily with the graft: but that makes no matter, because neither the barke
nor wood doe euer take with the graft; but the skinne or barke, which groweth and
swelleth vp from the foot of the tree, is that which coupleth it selfe vnto the graft, worketh
all, and by it selfe encreaseth, making a bodie of the said foot; not that the sawed

wood doth ioyne it selfe with the said graft, but abideth dead. If it be of the thicknesse
of a 
                        •
                     inger, or thereabout, you must cut it to the length of a foot, or halfe a foot,
from the earth, byas-wise, like the fashion of a Goats foot, for to cleaue it and for
therein onely one graft.
                  If it be as thicke as a cudgell, cut the stocke round with a Saw vp on high, a foot or
two from the ground, to put two good grafts into the cleft thereof: of which afterward
you shall cut away the least and weakest when they begin to bud.
                  If the plant be as thicke as an arme, cut it likewise round some two or three foot
high from the ground, for to cleave it and set therein three grafts, two in a cleft,
and one betwixt the barke and the wood, and that vpon the side that b
                        •
                     h the
most roome.
                  If it be as thicke as a legge, or more, cut it foure of fiue foot high from the ground,
and cleaue it crosse, and set therein foure grafts: or cleaue it with one onely cleft, and
graft two in the cleft, and two betwixt the wood and the barke
                        •
                      or, which is better,
graft them all betwixt the stocke and the barke, when the sappe shall be vp, for the
wood of such great plants doth pinch and wrinch the graft mightily, if you put not a
wedge of greene wood into the cleft.
                  After that the plant is cut either with a Saw or with a Knife, cleanse the wound either
with a little Saw-knife, or with some other thing: then make it plaine with a
knife that is cleane, and not infected with anie euill smell; and again make it cleane
againe the second time, that so it may not be infected anie manner of way with theyron,
because the sappe of the tree may be corrupted by it: then chuse out the best
place in all the stocke to fasten your graft vnto, without anie care of making the cleft,
on what side soeuer it be. I speake this, because it pleaseth some to affirme, That the
tree ought not to be clouen on that side that the wind standeth, at such time as they
goe about to graft it. It is true, that and if the wind should proue great, and with all as
North-east, that then you must turne your backe vpon it, and stand betwixt the wind
and the cleft, at such time as you are sitting and putting in your graft; because it is
sharpe and scorching, verie dangerous vnto all sorts of plants, as also fruits, of what
condition soeuer they be, but chiefely when they are blossomed.
                  Before you make wide the cleft with your wedge, bind and tie with two or three
turnes about with a wickar, drawne verie strair, your tree foot vpon the place where
you intend to make your cleft, that so your tree foot may not cleaue too farre: which
is oftentimes the cause that grafts take not, the cleft being so open, that it cannot 
                        〈◊〉
                     
shut againe and grow together, and so by that meanes breatheth out whatsoeuer
it hath of life in that place, and both the graft and the foot doe thereupon also per
                        •••
                     
but this happeneth oftest in Plum-tree stocks and branches of trees, because they are
more subiect to cleaue thus than anie of the other sorts. Great trees, and such as yet
goe beyond the fore-named measures, cannot be grafted by a cleft in the stocke, b
                        •
                     t
verie well in the branches, as wee see accomplished in great Apple-trees, and wild
Peare-trees, for they would be rotten before that the grafts could shut and close vp
the wound in the stocke.
                  If the small branches be drie and without anie sappe, you must cut their stockes or
armes: and after two or three yeares, when they haue put forth new siences, graft the
best, and cut away the feeble and starued ones. And afterward, when the grafts 
                        〈◊〉
                     
put forth verie well, you must strengthen and vnderprop them, or else wrap them one
within another, and tie them with wood amongst, for feare that the wind should
breake them: or else if it be a good and well reclaimed tree, let new siences grow 
                        〈◊〉
                     
of it. And this thing wee see much practised in Normandie, Bretaigne, and other
Countries, where they esteeme of Apples and Peares to make Cyder of.

                  To graft in the cleft.
                  
                     THe manner of grafting in the cleft,To graft in the cleft. that is to say, in the stocke, being clouen,
is proper not onely vnto trees which are as great as a mans legge or
arme, but also vnto others which exceed these in greatnesse. It is true,
that in as much as these trees cannot easily be clouen in their stocke, that
therefore it is expedient to make incision in some one of their branches, and not in
the maine bodie, as we see to be practised in great Apple-trees and wild Peare-trees,
and as we haue alreadie declared here before.
                  To graft in the cleft, you must make choice of a graft that is full of sappe and iuice,
but it must not be till from after Ianuarie vnto March: and you must not thus graft in
anie tree that is alreadie budded, because a great part of the iuice and sappe would be
alreadie mounted vp on high, and risen to the top, and there dispersed and scattered
hither and thither into euerie twigge; a newes nothing welcome to the graft. You
must likewise set downe and resolue not to gather your graft the day that you graft
it, but tenne or twelue daies before: for otherwise, if you graft it new gathered, it
will not be able easily to incorporate it selfe with the bodie and stocke where it shall
be grafted; because it will come to passe, that some part of it will drie, and by this
meanes will be a hinderance in the stock to the rising vp of the sappe, which it should
communicate vnto the graft for the making of it to put forth: and whereas this dried

                        〈◊〉
                      will fall a crumbling and breaking, through his rottennesse, it will cause to remaine
a cauitie and hollow or void place in the stocke, which will be an occasion of
the like inconuenience to befall the graft: and on the other side, the graft being as yet
new and tender, might easily be hurt of the bands, which are of necessitie to be tyed
round about the stocke, for the keeping of the graft firme and fast. You must furthermore
take heed, and see, that the tree whereupon you intend to graft haue been transplanted
and remoued from out of your stocke-Nurcerie for a long time before, that
so you may assure your selfe, that his rootes are long since well insea
                        •
                     oned, and
haue fully taken with the earth, and thereby also hath sufficient store of sappe
and iuice,
                  When you are minded to graft manie grafts in one cleft, see that the incision
made vpon their ends be alike great: which if you looke not to, it may happily
come to passe, that the cleft of the stocke shall be forced wider on the one side
than on the other. You must likewise foresee, that the grafts be of one length, or
not much squaring; and it is ynough if they haue three or foure eyelets without
the wrench.
                  When the plant is once sawed and lopped of all his small siences and shoots
round about, as also emptied of all his branches, if it haue manie, then you must
leaue but two at the most before you come to the cleauing of it: then put to your little
Saw and your knife or other edge-toole that is very sharpe, cleaue it quite through
the middest in gentle and soft sort, first tying the stocke verie sure, that so it may not
cleaue further than is need, and then put your wedges into the cleft vntill such time
as you haue see in your grafts; and in cleauing of it, hold your knife with the one
hand, and the tree in the other, to helpe to keepe it from cleauing too farre; Afterward,
with the same hand wherewith you held your tree, put in your wedge of Box,
or Brasill, or Bone, at the small end, that so you may the better take it out againe when
you haue set in your grafts. If the stocke be clouen, or the barke loosed too much
from the wood,The sappes of the graft and stock must be 
                           〈…〉
                         the other. then cleaue it downe lower, and set your grafts in, and looke that
their incision be fit and 
                        •
                     erie iustly answering the cleft, and that the two sappes (that
of the graft, and the other of the plant) be right and euen set, the one against the
other, and so handsomely sitted, as that there may not be the least apparance of

anie cut or cleft: for if they doe not thus iumpe one with another, they will neuer take
one with another, because they cannot worke their seaming matter, and as it were cartilaginous
glue, in conuenient sort and manner, to the glu

                     ng of their ioints together▪
You must likewise beware not to make your cleft ouerthwart the pith, but somewhat
aside.
                  The barke of the Plant being thicker than that of the graft, you must set the graft
so much the more outwardly in the cleft, that so the two sappes may in anie 
                        〈◊〉

what more out than that of the grafts on the clouen side.
                  To the end that you may not faile of this worke of imping, you must principally
take heed, not to ouer-cleaue the stocks of your trees: but before you widen the cleft
with your wedges, bind and goe about the stocke with two or three turnes, and tha

haue your cleft to end, that so your stocke cleaue not too farre, which is a verie vsuall
cause of the miscarrying of grafts, in as much as hereby the cleft standeth so wide and
open, as that it cannot be shut, and so not grow together againe, but in the meane▪ 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     
spendeth it selfe, and breatheth out all his life in that place, which is the cause that the
stocke and the graft are likewise spilt: and this falleth out most oft in Plum-trees and
branches of trees. You shall also be verie carefull to ioyne together the rindes of
your grafts and the plants, that so nothing may continue open, to the end that the
wind, moisture of the clay, or raine, running vpon the grafted place, may not

in. When the plane cleaueth verie streight, there is not anie danger or hardnesse

                  When your grafts are once well ioyned vnto your plants, draw out your wedges
verie softly, least you displace them againe. You may leaue there within the cleft
some small end of a wedge of greene wood, cutting it verie close with the head of the
stocke: or else so soone as your wedge is drawne out, put some small chip of green

They are greatly to be blamed for their fault committed, who hauing faire wild
uses or others (the fruit thereof displeasing them) doe cut them verte low, hauing
faire branches aboue, and a bodie of the thicknesse of a mans legge, and there
graft them, when as fiue or sixe years will scarce couer the wound that they haue
made by such their kind of grafting: whereas they might with as much eale haue
grafted vpon the branches of the same, and then they had not beene aboue a finger
thicke, and would haue growne better, and brought more profit; because that and
if you haue foure branches, you may make as manie grafts thereof, and these will
beare fruit the second yeare.

                  Of grafting in the ends of branches.
                  
                     FOr to graft at the end of such branches as haue goodly new wood, and
great siences on high, although the tree haue beene grafted before, and
that it be as yet not throughly growne, take grafts of what sort of tree
you will, and cut some of the siences off from the high parts of the tree
where you mind to graft: and if the grafts should be thicker than the siences, then
graft them after the manner of the Goats foot, as hath beene said alreadie of small
Plants. And if the siences be of the same bignesse with your grafts, then cut them
between the old and new wood, or a little higher or lower, and cleaue them a little,
and cut the graft of the like thicknesse to the sience which you haue cut off, making
but a short incision, and reseruing the barke vpon both sides, and looking that both
the sides be of equall thicknesse: then set your graft, thus fitted, into the cleft, and
that so, as that the barkes of both sides the graft may stand euen with the barkes of
the branch. And for these grafts, it is ynough if euerie one of them haue one good
eyelet or two about the wreathing; for to leaue them anie longer, would not be good:
and you must wreath and wrap them in earth and mosse, and couer it ouer
againe with Woollen clothes, and tye them vnto the same verie strongly, as hath
beene said.
                  Also by this meanes you may procure, that one tree shall bring forth diuers fruits,
so that they be not such as the situation of the Countrey and qualitie of the Ayre doe
refuse and reiect: as I haue seene sometimes at Padua, in the Garden of Messire Gabriel,
where one stalke of a tree hath borne fruits of diuers sorts. And there is nothing
that should hinder or let vs in this Countrey from doing the like, if it be not
(perhaps) that in some places the fauourable furtherance and mildnesse of the ayre is
not so correspondent and answerable.
                  Moreouer, if you will graft little Plants in this manner, see that they be of the same
thicknesse of the grafts, and graft them neere vnto the earth, as some three fingers off,
or thereabouts.
                  This manner of grafting at the ends of branches, must be done in trees whose
branches haue beene formetly cut off, by reason either of some great want, or else
too great aboundance of sappe: and that there be put forth of their stocke some
new shoots, which three or foure yeares after may be grafted after the manner wee
haue spoken of: Thus Columella teacheth vs to graft the Oliue-tree vpon the
Figge-tree.

of grafting is vsed in thicke plants, which cannot easily be eleuen in
the middest, either crosse, or otherwise, and in the stockes and branches of trees that
haue a thicke and fat barke, as Figge-trees, Plumme-trees, Peare-trees, and Chef

trees. The grafts that are thus to be grafted, must be gathered and kept long before,
as wee haue alreadie said, least peraduenture wee should not meet with trees of late
bears about this time, which haue not as then budded, and of which there may be
grafts gathered without buds; such as is the short-legged or short-stalked Apple-tree,
and such other like.
                  In this kind of grafting, the plant must be sawed vp on high, and the grafts our afterward,

on the one side as on the other: afterward the stocke must be verie well cleansed, to
take away the roughnesse and vneuennesse of the Saw, with a verie shap

that so the grafts may grow close thereunto: then thrust in a sharpe-pointed knife, or
some Scizars of Bone, or Iuorie, deept ynough betwixt the barke and the wood of
the plant, and so much, as that when it shall be drawne out, the cut and fitted end of
the graft may inter therein, and that the graft may ioyne vnto the stocke when it shall
be fet therein: this being done, it must be couered and wrapt well with

fashioned like a Flute, at the least three fingers and a halfe, long, hauing one eyelet

                        •
                     ound and entire. Then doe as much vpon some braunch of that Tree vvhereupon
you meane to graft the same, in such sort, as that the barke vvhich you take away
from the place to be grafted, may be of the same bredth, length, and situation or aspect
of the heauen, that that is vvhich was cut downe from the place where the graft
grew, and it must likewise haue one sound and intire eyelet as well as the other.
When you shall fasten it vnto the place, beware that the barke which you shall fasten,
be not wer or moist, and that it doe aunswer and fit the window, whereout the
barke was taken, and that in such sort, as that the eyelet in the barke to be grafted,

vvood, and that this knob goe into the eyelet, of the pipe-like barke, which you are
about to graft. By this meanes all will agree verie well together, neither will there
be seene any chinker, gaping, or rise, betwixt the commissures and joynes of the two
barkes. This done, bind and wreath aboue and below the said grafted barke with a
band of verie drie hempe, being vvithout any manner of moisture, that so the barke
may cleaue to the better, and take the sap of the tree the sooner: but still you must
looke to it, that your band doe not touch the eyelet, or pinch the barke too hard, for
this vvould keepe it that it should not take, and neither the barke, nor the band must
be wee.
                  The Chesnut-tree may be grafted after this manner, and profit more by it than any
other Trees, because the barke thereof is more ap
                        •
                      to fashion after the forme of a
pipe, than the barke of any other Tree. This way is long in working and taking, and
withall nothing sure or certaine: and therefore I would counsell the Gardener to
trouble himselfe but little at all with it.

                  Of grafting in the bud after the manner and forme
of a Scutcheon.
                  
                     FOr to graft after the manner of a Scurcheon, you shall not varie and differ
much from the manner of grafting which is after the fashion of a flute
or pipe, saue onely that the Scutcheon-like graft hauing one eyelet as
the other hath, yet the wood of the Tree whereupon the Scurcheonlike
graft is grafted, hath not any knob or bud, as the wood whereupon the barke is
grafted in manner of a pipe: wherefore in both the sorts of grafting, we may follow
the forme and order which followeth.
                  In Sommer when the trees are well replenished with sap, and that their new siences
begin to grow somewhat hard, you shall take a shoot at the end of the braunches
of some noble and reclaimed Tree, whereof you would 
                        •
                     aine haue some fruit, and
not mai
                        •
                     ne it of his old store or wood, and from thence raise a good eyelet the tayle
and all, thereof to make your graft: but when you chuse, take the thickest and grossest:
diuide the taile in the middest before you doe any thing else, casting away the
leafe (if it be not a Peare-plum-tree,) for the Scutcheon graft of a Peare-plum-tree,
would haue two or three leaues) without remouing any more of the said taile: afterward
with the point of a knife that is verie sharpe and will cut well, cut out of the
barke of the said shoot, the patterne and resemblance of a Scutcheon or Shield, of
the length of a naile, in vvhich there is onely one eyelet higher than the middest,
together with the residue of the eaile which you haue left behind: and for the lifting
vp of the said graft in Scutcheon, after that you haue cut the barke of the shoot round
about without cutting of the wood within, you must take it gently with your thumb;
and in pulling it away, you must presse vpon the wood, from which you pull it, that
to you may bring the bud and all away together with the Scutcheon, for and if you

should leaue it behind with the wood, then the rest of the Scutcheon were nothing
worth. You shall find out if the Scutcheon be nothing worth, if looking within it,
when it shall be pulled away from the wood of the shoot, you find it to haue a hole
within, but more manifestly, if the bud be stayed behind with the wood in the shoot,
when it ought to haue beene in the Scutcheon. Thus your Scutcheon being well raised
and taken off, hold it a little by the taile betwixt your lips, without wetting of it,
euen vntil you haue cut the barke of the tree where you would graft it, and looke that
it be cut without anie wounding of the wood within, after the fashion of a 
                        〈◊〉
                     ,
but somewhat longer than the Scutcheon that you haue to set in it, and in no place
cutting the wood within.
                  After you haue made incision, you must open it and make it gape wide on both
sides, but in all manner of gentle handling and entreatie, and that with little 
                        〈◊〉
                     
of bone; and separating the wood and the barke a little within, euen so much at the
Scutcheon is in length and breadth, you must take heed that in doing hereof you doe
not hure the brake. This done, take your Scutcheon by the end, and the 
                        〈◊〉
                      which
you haue left remaining, and put it into the incision made in the tree, listing vp 
                        〈◊〉
                     
the two sides of the incision with the said little Scizars of bone, and cause the said
Scutcheon to ioyne and lye as close as may be vnto the wood of the tree (being 
                        〈◊〉
                     
hath beene said) in weighing a little vpon the end of the rind so cut, and let the vpper
part of the Scutcheon lye close vnto the vpper end of the incision or barke of the said
tree: afterward, bind your Scutcheon about with a band of hempe, as thicke as the
pen of a quill, more or lesse, according as the tree is small or great, taking the same
hempe in the middest, to the end that eyther part of it may performe a little seruice
in wreathing and binding of the said Scutcheon, into the incision of the Tree, and it
must not be tied too strait, for that would keepe it from taking, the joyning of the
one sappe to the other being hindered thereby, and neither the Scutcheon no
                        •
                      yet
the hempe must be moist or wet. And the more justly to bind them together, begin
at the backside of the tree, right ouer against the middest of the incision, and from
thence come forward to joyne them before, aboue the eyelet and taile of the Scutcheon
(crossing your band of hempe so oft as the two ends meet) and from hence
recurning backe againe, come about and tie it likewise vnderneath the eyelet, and
thus cast your band about still forward and backward, vntill the whole cleft of the
incision be couered aboue and below with the said hempe, the eyelet onely excepted
and his taile, which must not be couered at all; this taile will fall away one 
                        〈◊〉
                     
after another, and that shortly after the ingrafting, if so be that the Scutcheon will
take, Leaue your trees and Scutcheons thus bound for the space of one month, and
the thicker, a great deale longer time; afterward looke them ouer, and if you 
                        〈◊〉
                     
them growne together, vntie them, or at the least cut the hempe behind, and le

them vncouered, cut also your branch two or three fingers aboue, that so the impe
may prosper the better, and thus let them remaine till after Winter, about the moneth
of March and Aprill. If you perceiue that the bud of your Scutcheon swell
and come forward, then cut off the tree three fingers or thereabout about the Scutcheon:
for and if it should be cut off too neere the Scutcheon, a
                        •
                      such time as it purtech
forth his first blossome, it would be a meanes greatly to hinder the flowing of
it, and cause also that it should not thriue and prosper so well: after that one yeare 
                        〈◊〉
                     
past, and that the shoot beginneth to be strong, beginning to put forth the 
                        〈◊〉
                     
bud and blossome, you must goe forward to cut off in biace wife the three fingers

                        〈◊〉
                     
hath beene said. When your shoot shall haue put forth a good deale of length, you
must sticke downe there euen hard joyning thereunto little stakes, tying the
                        •
                      together
verie gently and easily, and these shall stay your shoots, and prop the
                        •
                      vp, le

                  In this sort you may easily graft white Rose-trees in red Rose-trees, and red Rose-trees
in white Rose-trees, to haue Roses of diuers sorts vpon one and the same Rose-tree.
You may graft after the same manner two or three Scutcheons, prouided that

they be all of one side: for they would not be equally set together in height, because
that so they might all become staruelings: neither would they be one directly ouer
another: for the lower would stay the rising vp of the sap of the Tree, and so those
which were aboue should consume in penurie, and vndergoe the foresaid inconuenience.
                  You must note, that the Scutcheon which is gathered from the Sience of a Tree
whose fruit is sowre, must be cut in a square forme, and not in the plaine

                  It is ordinarie to graft the sweet Quince-tree, bastard Peach-tree, Abricot-tree,
Iujube-tree, sowre Cherrie-tree, sweet Cherrie-tree, and Chesnut-tree after this fashion:
how beit they might be grafted in the cleft more easily and more profitably,
although that diuers be of a contrarie opinion. As thus for example:
                  Take of the grafted of the sweet Quince-tree, and bastard Peach-tree, of the fairest
wood and best fed that you can find growing vpon the wood of two yeares old, because
the wood is not so firme and solide as the others, and you shall graft them vpon
small plum-tree stockes, being of the thicknesse of ones thumbe: these you shall
cut after the fashion of a goats foot, you shall not goe about to make the cleft of any
moe sides than one, being about a root high from the ground, you must open it with
your small wedge; which being thus grafted, it will seems to you that it is open but
of one side, afterward you shall wrap it vp with a little mosse, putting thereto some
gummed Waxe or Clay, as hath beene said before, and bind it vp with Oziar, to

                        •
                     eepe it the surer, because the stocks is not strong ynongh of it selfe for to hold it,
and you shall furnish it euerie manner of vvay, as others are deale withall. And this
kind of grafting is more profitable, and sooner growne vp than that which is done in
the forme of a Scutcheon.

of Trees.
                  
                     YOu may graft in the bud, by taking vp the bud of a young shoot or plant,
and putting it with a little barke in the place of another, which you
shall haue pulled from the Tree, vvhereupon you meane to graft, binding
it there aboue and below in manner as hath beene said of the Scutcheon-like
graft, and this may be done at the same time, and vpon the
same trees.
                  You may graft all manner of grafts, vpon all manner of trees after this manner:
Make two pits, foure foot euerie way, and the one hard by the other, in the one of
these plant an Oliue-tree, and in the other a Figge-tree, or any other such like sort of
Trees as shall best please you: when the Oliue-tree hath taken root, you shall bow
downe such plants of the same as seemeth vpto you the fairest of the rest, and bind
them to the foot of the said Figge-tree: this being done, cut away all the other plants
of the said Oliue-tree, except they be such as you meane in like manner to graft: then
cut downe the Figge-tree, and make smooth and euen the cut: after this, clause it in
the middest with a wedge, after which scape both the sides of the ends of the siences
of the Oliue-tree, such as the Tree beareth, and put them in the cleft of the Fig-tree,
in such manner as that they may reach through, afterward 
                        •
                     ome the said cleft
of the Figge-tree on the one side and on the other with tough

                     ome, and tie fast within
the stocke of the said Figge-tree, the said plants, in such sort as that a man cannot
pull them away. Thus three yeares after, the Figge-tree and Oliue-tree will grow
together, and the fourth yeare when they are well growne, you shall cut and vnco

the plants of the said Oliue-tree from it, as is done in propagating, so they

shall seeme not to appertaine any longer vnto the Oliue-tree. This manner of grafting
is verie vsuall in the Countrie of Mans, where I remember I haue rasted of a
grape which had the cast of a nut: because the vine that bare this grape, had beene
grafted into a nut-tree, and after that manner that I haue now spoken of.

                  Speciall obseruations of grafting, planting, and sowing of Trees,
for to haue exquisite fruits thereof.
                  
                     IF you graft a graft that bringeth forth a late fruit,Forward or late fruits. vpon a tree that bringeth
forth an early fruit, the graft will bring forth an early fruit in his
kind: as and if you graft a Peach vpon a reclaimed Mulberrie-tree, it
will come two moneths sooner: The same will come to passe, if you graft
vpon a Vine stocke, or a blacke Vine vpon a Cherrie-tree, or a Medlar-tree vpon
                        •
                     
Goose-berrie-tree, or reclaimed Mulberrie-tree. The cause of this hastened 
                        〈◊〉
                     
is the nature of the tree whereupon you haue grafted, which being the onely

and bring forward the fruit. On the contrarie, if the tree be of a late fruit, and the
graft of a timely, the graft will afterward bring forth late fruit in his kind: and staying
after his due and wonted time, as if it be an Apple-tree vpon a Quince-tree, 
                        〈◊〉
                     
Apples will proue to hang on the tree till Nouember, and will take so much after the
nature of the Quince-tree, as that they will keepe two yeares. By how much the

you graft vpon a tree of the same kind and condition that the graft or bud is Apple-tree vpon an

                        〈…〉
                      an Apple-tree, a reclaimed one vpon a reclaimed one, or a wild

hath beene said.
                  Graft one Apple-tree vpon another,The graft of the Apple-tree. and likewise in Goose-berrie-trees and reclaimed
Mulberrie-trees, and you shall haue fruit all Summer time, till the beginning of
Nouember.
                  To cause fruit to grow that shall be halfe Peach and halfe Nut,Halfe Peach and halfe Nuts. take an eyelet of the
one and of the other, and cut them as neere the eyelet as you can, both the one and the
other, and scrape their buttons a little; then ioyning them, bind them also verie and
together, and after cut away their toppes: the fruit growing from these, will be halfe
Peaches and halfe Nuts.
                  You may make one fruit to haue the tast of foure fruits of his kind after this 
                        〈◊〉
                     
Take foure shoots or grafts of foure differing sorts,One fruit hauing the rast of manie fruits. but of one kind of tree, as of foure
sorts of Peare-trees, or Apple-trees: As for example; of the Apple-tree take the short
stalked Apple, the Globe Apple, sharpe tasted Apples, and Apples of Paradise (because
that the shoots or grafts must be of one sort of trees) tie them verie well together,
in such sort, as that their barke may touch one another: afterward couer them with
glue, or with sand, or some

put them thus in some well digged ground that is full of manure, that so they may take
root: the fruit that will grow vpon these, will haue the taste of foure sorts of apples.
It proceedeth of the same cau
                        •
                     e if you take two grafts, the one of a sow
                        •
                     e apple-tree,
and the other of a sweet, and coupling them together so close and nee
                        •
                     e, as that they
may seeme to be one onely; vse them as before, and looke as the grafts were, so vvill
the apples be. In like manner if you couple, joyne and close together in such close
and fast manner two small figge-tree boughes, the one of a blacke figge-tree, and
the other of a white, and so set them, and after that they haue put forth and blossomed,
tie them againe, to the end they may incorporate and grow together, making
but one stocke, the figges that come there of vvill haue a red flesh on the one side, and
a white on the other. Some to worke the like effect, doe put into some linnen cloth
the seeds of two sorts of figge-trees, and hauing tied them verie strait, digge them in
the earth, and when they are growne vp, they remoue the figge-tree which is growne
vp vpon them.
                  Some doe likewise make grafts to beare halfe Peares, and halfe Apples, cleaning
one Apple-tree-graft, and one Peare-tree-graft, and after joyning the one
halfe of the one to the other halfe of the other, and tying them close together, and

                        •
                     oming the joynts and seames verie well with Gum and Wax mixt together, in such
manner as that the water cannot find any entrance at their joynts, and when this is
done, they graft this double graft vpon the stocke of such a Tree as shall fall
for their purpose: But you must thinke that this manner of planting is verie hard
to bring forth fruit. Wherefore they which take pleasure therein, must be contented
with two sorts of grafts, and not to plant them, but rather to graft them vpon another
Tree of the kind of the said grafts, binding them close together, and sharpening
them verie 
                        •
                     itly for the purpose at the lower end, in manner as if they were but
one onely graft.
                  If you hollow the branch of a Cherrie-tree taking away the pith,Cherries without a stone. and after set it
againe, it will bring forth fruit without any stone: or else thus better: cut off a
young Cherrie-tree within a foot of the earth, cleauing it also euen to the root, take
out the pith both of the one side and of the other, afterward joyne them together
againe, and tye them close with a strait band, and a yeare after that this Cherrie-tree
hath taken, graft therein a graft of a Cherrie-tree which neuer bare fruit, and
the fruit which commeth of such a graft, vvill be without any stone. Otherwise,
cut off from such stone-fruit-tree as you desire, a graft which may be easily bended:
sharpen it on the two ends, and graft it likewise on the two ends vpon two parts of
the Tree, make close the two grafted places with the mosse of fat ground, and tye
them carefully with a band: the yeare following, if you see that the two ends of
the graft haue taken some force and strength from the stocke, putting forth some
buds, then cut the graft asunder in the middest, and take cleane from it the thickest
sprig that it hath, and let the other grow, and it will beare in his due time fruit that
hath no stone. The same will come to passe, if you propagate the ends of the smallest
boughs of the young Cherrie-tree, plum-tree, or other stone-fruit-tree, and after
that you see that they haue taken root, if you cut off the thickest and fairest twig, and
let alone the leanest and slenderest. The reason and cause of this is, for that the stone
cannot grow, if the tree lacke his pith, but in the tops and ends of little boughs there
is no pith: therfore the fruit that commeth of them, whether they be planted or grafted
after the manner that hath beene said, will haue no stone, euen no more than that
which groweth of trees whose pith is taken out.

good to sow or set the first day of the first quarter of the Moone: but the 8, 9, 10, 11,
12, 13, 17, and 18, it is not good. If you plant in the decrease of the Moone, the tree
will yeeld the more profit, and fruit will grow the sooner thereupon; and by how
much your planting falleth to be neerer vnto the end and going out of the Moone,
by so much the tree will be of a more beautifull growth, and becomming more fer

and fruitfull: but and if you plant in the encreasing and new Moone, indeed your
trees will take better, and become more durable and lasting: they will spread in root,
and wood, and leaues, but they will giue ouer so much the more to beare fruit. If constrained
by some necessitie, you plant in the new of the Moone, then it will be best
for you to breake off the shoots that they shall thereupon put forth about the later
end of the Moone, and then they will beare their fruits as others doe. Notwithstanding,
this limiting and bounding of the time of the Moone is not of such warranti

then, or else in the encrease and new of the Moone.

but in a warme place, men are wont to plant in the moneths of October, Nouember,
and December.
                  Trees that haue a grosse thicke root, are planted in October, Nouember, and
December: but the shoots or little branches are planted in March, when they are
in sappe.
                  Trees that haue a great pith, as Figge-trees, naturalized Mulberrie-trees, Hazell,
and such like, are planted without anie root, from after mid September vnto the beginning
of Nouember: but other trees which you would plant with roots, must be
planted about the beginning of December, or verie shortly after.
                  Grosse trees are transplanted from one place into another in the moneth of Nouember,Gross or thicke trees.
and they must be freed from Snailes, and lopt and cropt before they be
transplanted, for so they take the better, and put forth their siences verie powerfully:
and if in taking of them vp, or transporting of them, it happen that the barke of their
roots be broken, you must draw the pilled and vncouered place ouer with good dung
or earth, before that you put it into the ground againe, and stirre vp the earth verie
well round about where you intend to let them downe againe, to the end that their
roots may spread and seat themselues to their good contentment, without being pinched
or strait

                  Some doe remoue from after the beginning of Nouember vntill March, when
the trees begin to enter into their sappe; for the sappe once drawing vp aloft, doth
forbid all remouing of the tree: and therefore, in such case, the sooner the better,
that is so say, if presently after the leaues be fallen, which is in the beginning of
Winter, you goe about it; but in waterie places it is good to stay till Ianuarie and
Februarie: but nothing must be done this way when it raineth, or when the earth is
wet; for it would so harden vpon the drying, as that the roots would be oppressed
and choaked.
                  The young grafts which you haue grafted in the stocke-Nurcerie,
                        
                           〈◊〉
                         grafts, or elsewhere,
must be remoued as soone as the grafts shall haue closed vp the cleft of the plant, as
some are of opinion: but yet this is hazarded ware, the graft hauing not as yet taken
almost anie disposition or good liking of the sappe of the plant, which being thus
againe remoued, it halfe a

nourishment, and so beginneth to wither when it commeth to take a cast of his
new dishes and prouision: but and if you stay till the graft haue put forth a faire
branch, before you remoue the graft, you shall shunne the danger that might otherwise
ensue.
                  You must plant your trees againe as soone as you haue taken them vp,To

                  Sowre Cherrie-trees cannot abide to be remoued: for being transplanted, they
will hardly put forth anie siences, especially if they haue their chiefe and principall
root maimed.
                  Before you remoue great trees, you must loppe off their boughes verie diligeraly,
at hath beene said: but as for little ones, you need not crop them, to take off

the head and toppes vpon trees when they are growne somewhat great and thicke,
they will still be lending of their sappe vpward, not looking to the feeding of the
roots, for that the ayre attracteth the nourishment of plants: as may easily be proued
by example, when there groweth anie small tree vnder one that is verie great, for
there the small tree will not thriue so well as if it were abroad in the ayre, and 
                        〈◊〉
                     
vnder the shadow; and so that which hath his head cut off, will take root sooner
than and if it were whole and vntouched. But if the tree which you remoue, exceed
not the thicknesse of a great ynch, you shall let it remaine whole because young
plants take root more easily than those which are old, and the reason is openly
knowne.
                  If the rootes of the trees which you would remoue, be much longer than is
needfull, you may take off the ends thereof in setting them down
                        •
                      againe, and that
so much as may fit best for the hole wherein you meane to set them, for so by this
meane they will not be stopped vp of the sides of the hole, but will amast and
draw moisture out of the earth for the nourishment of the tree a great deale more
aboundantly.
                  When you remoue anie tree, you must lay his rootes round about with 
                        〈◊〉
                      earth,
and take heed, that the weedie earth which you haue digged or cut away

put them in danger to be ouer-heated: or else, that they growing vp againe, might
diminish the nourishment of the tree. If it happen, that the earth which you

as Theophrastus testifieth. In like manner, one desireth a diuers kind of placing and
situation from the other. Wherefore the trees which craue the refreshment of hauing
their stockes taken vp, doe commonly thriue better in valleyes than in high places, as
well for that their seat must not be altogether so drained of moisture as the higher
places be, as also for that the moisture which is in higher grounds conueyeth it selfe
and distilleth into the lower and hollow, whether it be raine or anie spring rising
from thence.
                  In watrie places you must not make your pit verie deepe, wherein you mean to
plant your tree; but in drie grounds you must set them somewhat more deepe: nei

yet must you heape too much earth in vpon those pits when you fill them vp againe,

may yeeld his fruit in due time, be not wanting▪ for these failing, the fruit will likewise
greatly faile of his goodnesse, tast, and durablenesse, and so will falsifie the generall
rule aboue named.
                  Set downe with your selfe, to remoue your trees into so good a ground, or rather
better, than that from whence you tooke them vp, hauing respect to other especiall
obseruations besides to be obserued, according as will be required of the particular
natures of euerie one. And if it is be possible, remoue them into the like situation for the

                     THe Almond-treeThe Almond-tree. delighteth in hot places, looking towards the South or
East, or where the ayre at the least is moderate; as vpon the tops of

stonie or marlie: in which places it doth not onely flourish well, being
planted, and blossome aboundantly, but beareth therewithall great quantitie of drie
Almonds, as also hard and well-rellisht ones. But contrariwise, if it be planted in a
moist and watrie ground, and cold place, it neither groweth well, not beareth fruit
well, neither yet continueth long. The fit time for the setting of it, is about the Winter
Sols
                        •
                     ice, which is the eleuenth day of December, euen vnto the end of the same
moneth, or somewhat after: for the plant of this tree being forward and early in putting
forth buds, if it were planted in the Spring time, it might let slip and loosen the
time of the yeare, which might be the fittest for the maintaining and comforting of
his blossome. If you would haue it to grow of the stone vnbroken, and if I may so
say, of his seed, you must let it be in Ianuarie and all Februarie, in such places as are
temperate, or in October and all the moneth of Nouember in places that are hat.
And thus to cause it to grow of his fruit, you must take new Almonds, thicke ones,
hauing white shells, verie porous and spongie, and lay them in steepe for the space
of twelue houres in honied water, and after this digge them in the earth foure finger
deepe, the sharpe end downeward, and after to water them three of foure times a
moneth. It groweth also of shoots and siences, but the sience must be taken from the
top of the tree, full of pith, sound of barke, and cut vnder the knot. And as concerning
the grafting of it, you must take the time of Autumne, for (as hath beene said)
this tree is a quick-spur and fore-rider: but and if you stay till the Spring time, you
shall breake it off when the sience is fully put forth. And for the chusing of graf

that will take well, you must take them vp on high, and on the top of the tree, and
not from the middest, much lesse from below; and these grafts you may graft either
in the bud, or in the cleft, and vpon a tree of his owne kind, or vpon the peach or
Plum-tree: indeed the Almond-tree that is grafted, is not of such growth, or so

                  The good Farmer must plant and make grow great store of Almond-trees,The profitable Almond-tree. seeing
they are not chargeable to maintaine, neither yet their fruit to keepe, but rather of
greater profit and lesser losse than anie other, seeing that euen vnder them Come
will grow iolly and faire, the Almond-tree hauing but a few leaues, and those
little ones.

roots in Winter: or else if you pierce some part of the stocke close by the earth, and
put through the hole a wedge of Oake, watering it about with mans vrine.

Swines dung, and Vrine, casting much earth vpon it afterward, and this
yearely: or if you bore a hole in the stocke of the tree, and put therein a wedge dipe
in honey: or if (as Plinie and Theophrastus say) you bore the stocke through and
through below, and let the sappe runne out.
                  Of sweet Almonds you may make sowre ones,Bitter Almonds. if you let the beasts browse and
crop off the first and tender branches.

It must be watered at euenings in hot weather, with coole water, and sometimes
with water mingled with the lees of wine, especially when it withereth and beginneth
to fall away: as also to remedie it when it is in danger of fainting and drying,
you must lop it and cut away all the boughes, as is wont to be done with Willowes
when they are headed; for by that means they become lustie and frolike, and to haue
as manie boughes as they had before. It must also be s

                     ayed vpon some Pole or Willow,
because his roots be verie tender, small, and not creeping farre into the earth: likewise
we see that the Peach-tree doth grow old and fall away incontinently.
                  It beareth a diuers fruit, as well in colour and tast, as in substance, and this diuersitie
commeth, for the most part, of the ground, but principally of the husbanding of
them. And that it is thus, the Peach-trees that are planted or grafted vpon Vines,
bring forth Peaches of a better tast and more solide substance: the Peach-tree grafted
vpon a Mulberrie-tree, bringeth forth Peaches that haue red flesh: the Peach-tree
grafted vpon a Nut-tree, doth beare Peaches with huskes like Nuts, whose tree is but
small, and hath leaues like vnto the Almond-tree, and a reddish flower. It is true,
that such a tree may become such a one of it selfe, as we see infinitely in France. The
Peach-tree grafted vpon an Almond-tree, beareth Peaches which haue a kernell like
vnto the Almond, but the rind and the flesh like vnto the Peach.
                  There may as much be said of Abricots,The Abricot-tree. called of the Latines Praeocia, or Armeniaca;
of Spanish Peaches, Medlar-tree, bastard Peach-tree, and small Peaches, which
are kinds of trees agreeing much with the Peach, all which are verie tender in frost,
especially the grafted Abricot-tree, and it continueth not past halfe the time of the
Peach-tree: all of them are subiect to be spoyled of the cold, snowes, frosts, and
fogges, which happen after that they are blossomed: but to keepe them from these
dangers, it will be good to graft them vpon the Quince-tree or Almond-tree: all of
them will beare great fruit, if when they blossome they be watered with Goats milke.

                  Of the small Nut-tree or Hasel-tree.
                  
                     THe Hasel-tree (which is called the small Nut-tree of the small fruit which
it beareth, or the Filberd-tree, of the great fruit that it beareth) groweth
in anie aire or ground: but it best delighteth in a leane ground, that
is sandie and moist, neere vnto waters, or in places that men vse to water,
because this helpeth them as well in the bringing forth of their fruit in great
store, as for to make them endure long: adde hereto, that they put forth and spring
in such sort at the root, as that thereof one may set as manie as he will in other places.
When they are sowne, they must be put two fingers vnder ground: but indeed they
grow better of a plant that hath root, or of a shoot cut by as, and hauing old and new
wood, as we haue alreadie declared in the sixt chapter. They are planted in October
and Nouember, in a warme and temperate place, or in Februarie and March: and it
is better to leaue vpon them some boughes when they are set, than to set them of one
single rod, for so they beare the more fruit. They must yearely be digged anew at the
Spring, neere vnto the foot, and round about, and their shoots all cut away, without
leaking anie standing, saue three or foure for to plant and make thick bushie shadow,
and the same verie neat and cleane for height, not leauing anie branch or bough after
three or foure fadome from the top. Wherefore, if they be oft lopped, picked, and
pruned, they will grow the more streight, compact, and high, and will beare better
and fairer fruit: but otherwise, if a man neglect them, they runne out all their nourishment
into wood and leaues, without fruit: Their fruit is called the small Nut or Filberd.
The Filberd of hot Countries (where such trees are called Filberd-trees) is
more round and fleshie than the French small Nut, and it is a fruit verie easily dried
and made yellow. But and if you would keepe it fresh and white almost all the yeare
long, shut it vp close in an earthen pot, and set them in the earth; and when it is thus
kept, it bringeth not so much annoyance with it as otherwise it would, for it naturally
procureth drowsie headach and inflammation of the stomacke. I know not by what
obseruation of our ancestors this speech hath growne common amongst the people,
That the yeare which yeeldeth plentie of Nuts, doth also yeeld manie mariages. Both
the little Nut-tree, as also his fruit, haue a certaine contrarie vertue against venimous
beasts; for if you hang a cluster of small Nuts in anie part of the house, no Scorpion
or venimous beast will enter thereinto, but slie away presently. The Countrey people
haue likewise marked in all ages, that the Serpent, Lizard, or other venimous beast,
dieth presently, hauing beene stricken with a branch, staffe, or rod of the Hasel-tree.
And it is no maruell, seeing Nut kernels eaten with Figges and Rue doe resist venime
and the biting of venimous beasts. The best small Nuts and Filberds and those which
haue red shells, and which are hardly broken. The raw shell finely powdred, and
drunke with water of Carduus Benedictus, doth heale the pleurisie in the beginning
thereof: being drunke to the quantitie of two drammes with red wine, it stayeth the
flux of the belly, and the whites. It is true, that for the flux of the belly, and whites,

and more forcible. The Filberd nourisheth a great deale better than the Nut, as being

                     IT is apparant, that common Cherrie-trees, sweet Cherrie-trees, bitter
Cherrie-trees, and hart Cherrie-trees, are sorts of trees agreeing in manie
things, for they all delight to grow in a cold and moist ground, or
else altogether indifferent, betwixt hot and cold; for a hot ayre they

hardly endure: and so likewise they refuse to haue anie dung, because it ouer-heatech
them, and is contrarie vnto them: and for this cause they must neuer be planted in a
manured ground. Notwithstanding, if you so temper the dung, as that it may not be
ouer-hot for them, it cannot

and the broken parts of their owne siences, or small lumpes and gobbets cut from
their owne small branches, for in these they greatly reioyce and profit mightily,

be in a high or low place, in October, Nouember, December, and Ianuarie. You may
graft them in Nouember, or (according to Palladius) from the twelfth day of December
vnto the first of Februarie. The best is to graft them in Februarie and in March:
albeit that it be the best cutting of all trees that yeeld gumme, when the gumme is not
yet rising, or after it is quite gone downe and returned from whence it rise. Lastly,
Cherrie-trees neuer thriue so well, being nothing done vnto but planted, as when they

of them, or else water their roots often with warme water; but then such fruit is

                  They may be grafted vpon the Plum-tree and Corneile-tree, but best vpon one of
their owne kind: in such sort, as that sweet Cherrie-trees being grafted vpon 
                        〈◊〉
                     
Cherrie-trees, doe beare a more soft Cherrie than those are which grow vpon sweet
Cherrie-trees, grafted into sweet Cherrie-trees. Cherries grow fairest vpon small
Cherrie-trees, and more plentifully also than they doe vpon high and tall ones▪
Wherefore, who so shall graft the small Cherrie-tree vpon the great, shall procure
greater store of fruit, and more thicke ones, such as are the wild Cherries, and also 
                        〈◊〉

                  The Coeurs and Agriots may be grafted vpon the common sweet Cherrie-tree,
but better vpon wild ones than vpon garden ones. We must therefore acknowledge

so well, as that the second yeare it beareth fruit: but it beareth not so soone,
when it is planted of branches. It would be planted during the encrease of the
Moone, in the moneths of Februarie or Nouember. This tree is verie commonly
vsed to graft other trees vpon, because they being grafted thereupon, doe continue
and endure longer, and beare a more delicate fruit, than if they were grafted
vpon trees of their owne kind. The best time for the gathering of this fruit, is in
the moneth of October, when that blasting comes, and it groweth to be of a golden
colour, for this is a signe that it is ripe; and this must bee in cleare and faire
weather, and in the decrease of the Moone: and then you must cleanse it from

                      planted in October and Nouember, in a warme and temperate ayre, but in Februarie,
March, or Aprill, where it is a cold ayre: and yet the Genowayes doe
plant branches all the moneth of August, as they are laden with leaues and fruit.
As for the grafting of it,To graft the Figge-tree. that may be done in Aprill, as well in the bodie, or stocke,
as in the barke or rind. Some say, that the Figge-tree planted amongst Vines,

doth it no annoyance, which is in some part true, because there is some

                      and
agreement betwixt the Figge and the Grape, and both their woods are full of thick
pith; and Raisins or dried Grapes being wrapped in Figge leaues, doe not onely
keepe well and sound, according to their nature, but amend and become better 
                        〈◊〉
                     
in tast and smell: and in part false, because the Figge-tree casteth one such large
branches and broad leaues, as that the shadow thereof doth hurt the Vine. There
are some low dwarfish Figge-trees, like vnto the Peach-tree, the fruit of which
Peach-trees is somewhat agreeing with the Grape: so as that the Peach being

                  Of the Apple-tree.
                  
                     THe Apple-tree which is most in request,The Apple tree and the most precious of all others,
and therefore called of Homer, the Tree with the goodly fruit,
groweth any where, and in as much as it loueth to haue the inward
part of his wood moist and sweatie, you must giue him his lodging in
a fat, blacke, and moist ground; and therefore if it be planted in a grauelly and sandie
ground, it must be helped with watering, and batling with dung and smal mould
in the time of Autumne. It liueth and continueth in all desireable good estate in the
hills and mountaines where it may haue fresh moisture, being the thing that it searcheth
after, but euen there it must stand in the open face of the South. Some make
nurceries of the pippins sowne, but and if they be not afterward remoued and grafted,
they hold not their former excellencie: it thriueth somewhat more when it is set
of braunches or shoots: but then also the fruit proueth late and of small value: the
best is to graft them vpon wild Apple-trees, Plum-trees, Peach-trees, Peare-trees,
Peare-plum-trees, Quince-trees, and especially vpon Peare-trees, whereupon grow
the Apples, called Peare
                        •
                      maines, which is a mixture of two sorts of fruits: as also,
when it is grafted vpon Quince-trees, it bringeth forth the Apples, called Apples of
Paradise, as it were sent from heauen in respect of the delicatenesse of their cote, and
great sweetnesse, and they are a kind of dwarffe Apples, because of their stocke the
Quince-tree, which is but of a smal stature.
                  The Apple loueth to be digged twice, especially the first yeare, but it needeth no
dung, and yet notwithstanding dung and ashes cause it prosper better, especially the
dung of Sheepe, or for lesse charges sake, the dust which in Sommer is gathered vp
in the high waies. You must many times set at libertie the boughes which intangle
themselues one vvithin another; for it is nothing else but aboundance of Wood,
wherewith it being so replenished and bepestred, it becommeth mossie, and bearing
lesse fruit. It is verie subiect to be eaten and spoyled of Pis
                        •
                     nires and little wormes,
but the remedie is to set neere vnto it the Sea-onion: or else if you lay swines dung at
the roots, mingled with mans vrine, in as much as the Apple-tree doth rejoyce much
to be watered with vrine. And to the end it may beare fruit aboundantly, before it
begin to blossome, compasse his stocke about, and tie vnto it some peece of lead taken
from some spout, but when it beginneth to blossome, take it away. If it seeme
to be sicke, water it diligently with vrine, and to put to his root Asses dung tempered
with water. Likewise, if you will haue sweet Apples, lay to the roots Goats dung

                        •
                     ingled with mans water. If you desire to haue red Apples, graft an Apple-tree
vpon a blacke Mulberrie-tree. If the Apple-tree will not hold and beare his fruit

                        〈◊〉
                      it be ripe, compasse the stocke of the Apple-tree a good foot from the roots vp

about with a ring of a lead, before it begin to blossome, and when the apples
shall begin to grow great, then take it away.
                  Apples must be gathered when the moone is at the full,Gathering of Apples. in faire weather, and about
the fifteenth of September, and that by hand without any pole or pealing
downe: because otherwise the fruit would be much martred, and the young siences
broken or bruised, and so the Apple-tree by that meanes should be spoyled of his
young vvood which would cause the losse of the Tree. See more of the manner of
gathering of them in the Chapter next following of the Peare-tree: and as for the

                        〈◊〉
                      of keeping of them, it must be in such sort as is deliuered hereafter.
                  You shall 
                        〈◊〉
                      frozen Apples if you dip them in cold water, and so restore them
to their naturall goodnesse. There is a kind of wild Apple, called a Choake-apple,
because they are verie harsh in eating, and these will serue well for hogges to eat.

Of these apples likewise you may make verjuice if you presse them in a Cyder-presse,
or if you squeese them vnder a verjuice milstone.
                  Vinegar is also made after this manner:Vinegar. You must cut these Apples into gobb
                        •••
                     ,
and leaue them in their peeces for the space of three dayes, then afterward cast them
into a barrell with sufficient quantitie of raine water, or fountaine water, and after
that stop the vessell, and so let it stand thirtie daies without touching of it. And
then at the terme of those daies you shall draw out vinegar, and put into them againe
as much water as you haue drawne out vinegar. There is likewise made with this
sort of Apples a kind of drinke, called of the Picardines, Piquette, and this they
vse in steed of Wine. Of others sorts of Apples, there is likewise drinke made, which
is called Cyder, as we shall declare hereafter.
                  An Apple cast into a hogshead full of Wine,Neat Wine. Mingled Wine. if it swim, it sheweth that the Wine
is neat: but and if it sinke to the bottome, it shewes that there is Water mixt with the
Wine.
                  Infinit are the sorts and so the names of Apples comming as well of natures owne

former: in euerie one of which there is found some speciall qualitie, which others
haue not: but the best of all the rest, is the short shanked apple, which is marked
with spottings, as tasting and smelling more excellently than any of all the other
sorts. And the smell of it is so excellent, as that in the time of the plague there is nothing
better to cast vpon the coales, and to make sweet perfumes of, than the rinde,
thereof. The short stalked Apple hath yet further more one notable qualitie: for the
kernells being taken out of it, and the place filled vp with Frankincense, and the hole

                  Of the Peare-tree.
                  
                     BVt the Peare-tree (being the most in request and precious (next vnto
the Apple-tree) amongst all the fruit-trees that are) is ordered for the
most part after the manner of the Apple-tree,The Peare-tree. although the vvood and
fruit of the one be more firme than that of the other, and that the Peare-tree
bring forth his fruit late, as not before the end of Autumne, vvhen as all the great
heat is alreadie past: notwithstanding you shall set it in the same ground with the
Apple-tree: and in the first foure or fiue yeares of his grouth, you shall lay it open at
the foot, a litte before the end of December, vncouering it euen vnto the root
                        ••
                     ,
which you shall shaue and trim with a knife bowed againe: and in the end of Ia
                        ••
                     
                     arie
you shall couer it againe with his owne earth mingled with good made mould,
keeping from thence forward his place well weeded, the foot verie neat and cleane,
and the stocke verie well freed from intanglements of boughes so farre as the hand
can doe it, and throughout verie carefully cleansed from mosse, snailes, and caterpillers,
husbanding and ordering the earth at the foot of it euerie two yeares at the beginning
of Winter: for the fruit which the Peare-tree thus husbanded shall beare,
will be both more faire and better relished, and keepe longer. The Peare-tree that
is planted in a leane, drie, chalkie or grauelly ground, is but of a starued growth, bearing

a sharpe, small, and ordinarily a stonie fruit. The kernels are sowne in the Nurcerie,
as those of the Appletree, but the hoped fruit is long in comming, and scarce attained
throughout the whole life of a man, for it is farre longer time in comming to
perfection than the Apple-tree. It groweth also of a branch well chosen: and he that
will haue it so grow, must plant it in September and October in hot Countries, but
in cold Countries in Februarie and March, and in temperate Countries it may be
done in either of the two times, as it shall best please him. But the Peare-tree that is
most sure and likeliest to bring contentment of it selfe, is that which is grafted vpon
the young plant in the Nurcerie, and in such curious sort maintained and ordered, as
hath beene said, as also if it be remoued some three yeares after, affoording it a large
and deepe roome in a good mouldring earth. It may also be grafted in a Peach-tree,
Quince-tree, and Almond-tree, but yet better vpon it selfe than vpon anie of these,
for so it becommeth of a better nature. It is knowne by proofe, that the Peare-tree,
grafted vpon a Mulberrie-tree bringeth forth red Peares: and if it happen that your
Peare-tree bring forth a stonie Peare, you must remoue the earth from the foot, and
powre in vpon the rootes euerie day, for the space of fifteene daies, the lees of good
old wine.
                  Peares must not be gathered before the later end of Autumne,To gather Peares. when the great heat
of the yeare is past, because their moisture being weake, and in small quantitie, the
Sunne suffereth not that it should come vnto anie good consistence, before such time
as the ayre begin to turne and change into coldnesse: and therefore (saith Theophra
                        
                           ••
                        us)
this is the onely fruit-tree that ripeneth his fruit best and soonest in the shadow.
Such gathering of Peares also must not be taken in hand but after that the Autumnall
blasting and dew be fallen at the least three or foure times vpon them, because it
strengtheneth them greatly, to their better enduring and lasting, and encreaseth their
goodnesse. But in anie case they may not be gathered in raine, but rather in drie weather,
being themselues well dried by the Sunne; and that in gathering they be not hurt
by anie manner of meanes whatsoeuer, but to chuse them one after another, by cutting
them downe with a good knife made fast to the end of a pole: or else to make them
fall into a cloth spread vnderneath for the receiuing of them, and in it separating the
rotten, spoyled, or hurt, from amongst the faire, sound, whole, and vnhurt ones,
that so they may be layed vp to keepe in such sort as wee will declare hereafter
in his place.
                  Although generally, and without saying anie thing of anie particular by way of
comparison, the Apple be farre fuller of iuice, and for the most part more sound than
the Peare, notwithstanding, if one should stand vpon the tast, the Peare is commonly
more pleasant and better relished, and more contenting and agreeing with ones tast,
eaten in his season, raw, rosted, or preserued, than the Apple: wherefore I am ashamed,
that men giue not themselues to plant moe Peare-trees than Apple-trees, seeing
that besides the reasons alledged, the Peare-tree, of all other fruit-trees, is the fairest,
streightest, and couering no whit so much ground with his shadow as the Apple-tree
doth, bearing also his fruit almost euerie yeare, where the Apple-tree is but a
iourney-man, bearing one yeare, and not another.
                  There is a drinke made of Peares,Looke in the Treatise of Perrie. called Perrie, whereof we will speake: as also
vineger of wild Peares, as hath alreadie beene said of Apples.
                  The Peare hath this speciall vertue aboue the rest, that the often vse of the kernels
should be maruellous profitable vnto such as are troubled with the inflammation of
the lungs; as also for them that haue eaten manie Mushromes, that they may rid their
stomacke of so great a load, there is nothing better than to eat Peares: for the Peare
by his weightinesse and astringent iuice, maketh the Mushromes, eaten and lying in
the bottome of his stomacke, to descend and fall downe from thence.

                  Of the Medlar-tree.
                  
                     CErtaine it is, that the Medlar-treeThe Medlar-tree. groweth into a thicke stock: it endureth
the cold ayre easily, and yet delighteth best in a hot or temperate
ayre, and in a sandie and fat ground. It is planted either of roots or of
branches, and that in Nouember: and some sow it of stones in a ground
mixt with dung: it will beare fruit in great quantitie, if there be layed to the foot of
it earth mixt with ashes. It may be grafted vpon it selfe, or vpon the Peare-tree,
Apple-tree, or Quince-tree: and that it may be well grafted, and with good grafts,
you must prouide your selfe of those, which grow out of the middest of the Medlar-tree,
and not of the top: and it must be grafted in the cleft or highest
                        •
                      part of the
stocke, not in the barke, because the leanenesse of the barke would not be able sufficiently
to nourish it.
                  If you graft it vpon a Quince-tree, the fruit will be verie faire, and the reason is
verie manifest, because the stocke which receiueth the graft, and nourisheth it, is giuen
naturally to bring forth a thicke gros
                        •
                     e fruit: and yet it will yeeld a fairer without
all comparison, if you graft it vpon the hawthorne, vvith which it is joyned in
exceeding familiar and friendly league, also the fruit that commeth thereof is more
beautifull and plentifull: it may also be verie fitly grafted vpon any other thorne, it
selfe being pricklie: if you graft the Medlar-tree vpon any other Tree that is not of
his owne kind, the Medlar will haue either no stones, or verie few, or else verie little
ones. If the vvormes assaile the Medlar-tree, you must water the stocke with vinegar,
or throw ashes vpon it.
                  Some hold it for certaine, that the flesh, and especially the small stones of the
medlar dried either seuerally and alone, or else together, made into powder, and
drunke with white wine, wherein hath beene boyled the roots of Parsly, doe breake
and consume the stone as well of the reines as of the bladder. Looke into the second
booke in the Chapter of Turneps, as concerning this remedie. You may make a cataplasme
of drie medlars, cloues, white and red corall, and nutmeg, all incorporated
with the juice of Roses, to lay vpon the bellie in the great fluxes of the same, and vpon
the breast for the spitting of bloud.

                  Of the Mulberrie-tree.
                  
                     MVlberries grow vpon a certaine kind of Tree which hath a firme wood, but
a brittle fruit and leaues, it buddeth the last of all other Trees, after that
the cold is ouerpassed, vvhereupon it is called by the name of sage or
wise, wittie, and prouident; it putteth not forth his leaues till all other
Trees be laden with leaues, if at the least you hasten not forward his budding▪ by giuing
vnto it fresh and new dung in the new of the Moone of Februarie. This Tree
is of two sorts, the one vvhite, because of the white Mulberries; the other blacke,
because of the blacke or red Mulberries which it beareth and bringeth forth: which
though they resemble one another in this, that both of them doe put forth their leaues
later than any other Tree, yet notwithstanding they are vnlike in flowers, leaues, and
other considerations. For the blacke doth not onely bring forth a farre fairer and
better relished fruit, and that of greater aboundance of liquor than the white: but it
hath besides a thicker stocke, and a greater and harder leafe, it groweth verie hardly

and with much adoe being planted, and it is a great while in growing before it become
great, and therefore is no shame that there are so f

selfe to grow being planted of plants and siences, as also propagated and multiplied
vnder the earth, with the stocke that bare it, euen as is vsed to be done with the
white ones, which yet doe grow infinitely euerie where, as well planted of shootes,
and propagated, as sowne: both the one and the other doe loue a hot ayre, or at the
least a temperate, a ground that is fat, and well battled with dung, and labour at
the foot, and to be kept cleane from mos
                        •
                     e and caterpillers, and without any dead,
wood. They are planted, especially the white, either of shoots or of roots, or buds,
and that in October and Nouember, even in like manner as the figge-tree. In planting
of them, you must make them deepe and large pits, and couer them with earth
mixt with ashes: they may be grafted vpon the chesnut-tree, apple-tree, wild peare-tree,
cornaile-tree, elme, or white popler (and then they will beare white mulberries)
and this must be in the cleft; and vpon the figge-tree in the scutcheon-like graft:
they may also be grafted vpon themselues, and the one vpon the other, as the vvhite
Mulberrie-tree vpon the white, and the blacke vpon the blacke, and that chiefely
and principally after the pipe or flute-like fashion: in what manner soeuer you graft
them, the grafts must be chosen of a good thicknesse, and from such Mulberrie-trees
as beare fruits full of good seed and kernells. It would be but labour lost to sow
them vpon kernells in the nurcerie in this cold Countrie, for besides that but a few
Mulberries haue seed, yet those which haue, doe bring forth neither tree nor fruit almost
that is any thing worth. But whatsoeuer it is, or in what place soeuer you plant,
graft of sow them, let it be farre from houses, to the end that the infinite number of
flies which flocke thicker when the fruit is ripe, may not become tedious to the inhabitants,
but yet let it be in such a place as that the hennes may eat them when they
fill downe, because this victuall doth fat and feed them verie mightily. It buddeth
the last of all Trees, as we haue said, but for a recompence it becommeth ripe by
and by.
                  The mulberrie-tree hath alwaies beene of great request and great profit in countries
where cloth of silke is made, as at Luckes, Geynes, Almerie, Granado, Auignion,
and afterward at Tours and other places, because the small wormes making silke,
are brought vp and nourished of the leaues of this tree: which for the same purpose
are carefully sought of them which doe make account to draw silke into a fleece:
whereupon it is come to passe, that there are to be seene in many places about the
said townes of great Mulberrie-trees, as it were little wings of forests, the said Mulberrie-trees
being planted after a just and due proportion and leuell of line, and most
exquisitely maintained and looked vnto by them which owe them: for from hence
they reape large summes of money, selling the leaues yearely for the purpose before
spoken of; for as for the fruit, they make no great purchase of it, because the Mulberrie-tree
will not be robbed of his leaues, for so it would come to passe that it should
not bring forth fruit, of the value of three halfe pence.
                  The wood of the Mulberrie-tree is good to make chests, forkes, and compasses of;
and such other workes as must yeeld and be pliant: it is also good about ships and
boats.
                  Mulberries must be eaten before all other meats, and that without bread, or else
but with a verie little, because if they be mixt with other victualls they doe but cause
them to corrupt: it is true that they coole and moisten verie much, and doe also loosen
the bellie.
                  Mulberries put into a glasse vessell well stopt and couered with their juice may be
kept a long time.
                  The juice of Mulberries halfe ripe mingled with honie of roses, is a singular remedie
for the inflammations of the mouth and throat, as also for the pu

                     BVt now to speake of the timely Peach-tree,The timely Peach-tree. it beareth a verie small fruit,
but earlier than other Peach-trees doe, and hauing his name thereupon▪
it is of a verie good relish, and no way harmefull, in euerie thing else it is
like vnto the other Peach-tree, both the one and the other delighting
in cold grounds, and open vpon the wind: they likewise craue no other manuring,
than that of their owne leaues, and content themselues to be planted three or foure
fingers deepe in the ground: but and if they lye verie much open to the force of the
wind, they require either to haue some wall, or else some other trees to stand in the
forefront betwixt them and the wind to breake it off. The timely peach craueth
such a ground as the Plum-tree, and groweth either of the stone or of a plant. It is
to be planted in October or N

and in drie times it must be oftentimes watered and digged: it craueth
the like husbanding and ordering that the other peach-tree doth. See more aboue in

                  Of the Walnut-tree.
                  
                     AS for the Walnut-tree,The Walnut-tree. it is a tree verie common, and sufficiently knowne in
all parts, so called by reason of the annoyance that it worketh others
which are neere vnto it, as also the places where it is planted, men, yea and
the verie beasts: in so much as that it is proued by experience, that if a
man doe sleepe vnder it, at his awaking he shall find a great heauinesse in his head,
and withall become so light and giddie, as that he will not be able to stirre: yea the
shadow thereof is so malignant, as that no good thing can grow vnder it, and the
roots (as well as the shadow) stretching and spreading themselues farre, doe hinder
and trouble all the ground where the same tree is seated and planted: so that it must
not be planted in arable ground, but especially not in fat and fertile ground, but rather
vpon the North quarter by the high way sides, or elsewhere, so that there be no
other fruit-trees by to take harme by it. This tree is for many causes to be gotten of
the husbandman: in as much as it needeth no great dressing or prouision for the
maintenance of it, it suffereth and beareth injuries of those which oppresse it, and yet
neuerthelesse extendeth and yeeldeth his fruit in liberall sort euen with it owne losse,
it prospereth both aboue and vnder the earth, and there is neither leafe, fruit, shell,
or gristle betwixt the kernell, but there may profit and commoditie be raised of it,
both night and day, as shall be declared in euerie of his particular properties. It especially
delighteth in a fat, mouldrie, light, and (in a word) in a good corne ground,
the husbandman likewise delighteth in such a ground: but the Walnut-tree refuseth

no kind of ayre or ground, for it can verie well endure to beare and suffer much. For
the planting of it, you must make choyce of such walnuts and trees as beare aboundance
of fruit, hauing thin shells, and a vvhite, full, and thicke kernell. And to make
it grow, you may digge the nut into the earth, the pointed end downeward, or else
plant it of the shoots that are faire growne,To plant the Walnut tree. and that in Nouember, and throughout all
December in hot countries; but in Februarie and March in cold countries; and in
temperate countries, in which of the two seasons you vvill. But such as would haue it
to grow of the nut in Nouember and all December, must obserue and see that the nut
which they would burie in the earth for this purpose, be but a yeare old, of a fair
                        •
                     
shell, sound, and drie: and, if it be in the moneth of Februarie, or any part of March,
the nut must be steeped, as some are of opinion, for foure or fiue daies aforehand, in
some childs vrine, or else (as I gesse) in cows milke: for the tree that shall grow therof,
will beare his nuts as little displeasing either in eating or in the oyle thereof, as if it
were the fruit or oyle of sweet almonds.
                  If you would haue this tree to grow faire,To remoue the Walnut tree. and full of nuts of a good tast, you
must remoue it, but let it be possessed of the earth where it grew either of a graft or
otherwise: and in remouing of it, some find it not good that the small rootes should
be cut away as it is vsed in other Trees: both because the Maister-rootes doe gather
footing and strength thereby, as also for that being as it vvere relieued by such
shootes, vvould become more strong and more able to pierce the earth, and to
sucke and suppe vp greater quantitie of the moisture of the same. I could be of
mind, that when it is remoued (which must not be but when it is two or three yeares
old) there should be taken from it at that time whatsoeuer surplusage and surcharge
of roots, euen so manie as may be tearmed bastard or by-roots, and not of the master
or maine ones: for as for the cutting off of the ends of the great roots,Pits to set the Walnut tree in, or to remoue them into. that is done
but for the opening of their mouth, that so they may the better sucke in the moisture
and iuice of the earth (if one may so speake of the new nurse which you haue appointed
and assigned it.) In respect of his pits and holes whereinto you remoue it,
they must be digged of a great depth and widenesse, and be well stirred round about,
and set distant thirtie or fortie foot one from another, that so it may the better
spread forth his branches, which are wont to couer and occupie a great deale of
roome round about it: and if they should be anie neerer one vnto another, their
boughes would grow one into another, whereas they craue to haue their sides free
and open. And this is the reason why they should be planted vpon the borders of
grounds lying vpon high wayes: for by this meanes the great compasse which their
branches take, doe not hurt seed grounds, or not aboue halfe, and by this meanes the
looking-glasse wherein the husbandman may behold such hinderance and disaduantage
as might come by scarcitie that yeare, shall not be farre off from him or his
hinds,A signe of plentie or otherwise by the Walnut tree. vvho hold it for certaine, that great store of Walnuts doth prefage great
spoyle of corne. To set a Tree of some other kind amongst them, is no more profitable
than to lay the inheritance of some base and meane fellow, betwixt the demaines
of two great noble men: for the Walnut-trees which are naturally great spreaders
in the earth vvith their great roots,Walnut-trees must stand alone vvill robbe it and eat it out of food and sustenance
euen home to his owne doores, and couering it aboue vvill take from it both
the Sunne, and the libertie of the ayre. But in as much as the things of this vvorld
are so framed,The Oake an enemie to the Walnut tree. as that there is nothing vvhich hath not his enemie, you must beware
of placing the Walnut-tree either vpon seed or plant neere to the oake, as also not
to set it in the place where any oake hath stood at any time before: because that these
two Trees haue a naturall hatred one vnto another, and cannot couple or sure together.
                  The Walnut-tree is grafted in Februarie vpon it selfe,The grafting of the Walnut tree and vpon the Plum-tree in
a clouen hole: howbeit, the Walnut-tree doth not profit much, or thriue, when it is
grafted vpon anie other tree than vpon it selfe, because it abhorreth the companie of
all other trees. It must be digged about, that so it may not grow hollow by reason of
the grasse. It must be remoued in hot and drie places in October, when the leaues

are fallen, and yet better in Nouember: but in cold places in February and in March▪
and at either time in temperate places.
                  This is a maruellous thing of this tree,The beaten Walnut-tree becommeth fruitfull. that the more it is beaten yearely, the more
fruit it beareth the yeare after following, although the boughes be brused and broken:
for which cause good farmers are carefull to geld and weed out some of the
boughes of such a Tree, and withall doe make great and di

                  Of the Oliue-tree.
                  
                     NOw we come to speak of the Oliue-tree, which is for the most part small,
thicke of leaues, and round, for there are some sorts also that haue great
branches dispersed here and there out of order: both the one and the other
sort are contented with a shallow ground, for in many places they
grow vpon the thin green swarth or turfe that couereth the rocks, &amp; vpon the ground
hanging vpon the sides of some great steeres; thus you may see how the oliue-tree
disposeth of it selfe euerie where, how vnfitting and vnlikely soeuer that the ground
be, prouided that it haue a warme ayre, and Easterly or Southerly wind at command.
He that would carefully appoint it out such a plot, as the vine would require, might
erre in many places: for the oliue-tree is not so much to be regarded in respect of his
soyle and seat at the vine, for it contenteth it selfe with a great deale lesse than the
vine vvill. If you giue it ground that is good and fat earth, and the Sunne and
Winds, which it delighteth in, in other places, doubt not but it will doe as the Spaniard,
who pleaseth himselfe with as good as nothing, when he knoweth not how to
amend himselfe, or do better, and performeth his seruice therewithall: but if he come

where he may but haue the smell of it, he is stuffed as full as the greatest

                      in all
Lymosin: so the Oliue-tree being once seised in his tallance of a good piece of
ground, contenteth it selfe, and beareth fruit handsomely. As concerning the planting
of it vpon the North in hot Countries, and there searing it vpon the toppes of
mountaines, or lesser hills or vpon the South in cold Countries, these are but troubles
and paines without anie great foundation: for as concerning cold Countries, there is
no talke to be had of growing of Oliue-trees in them; and as concerning hot Co

                     tries,
there is neither taking nor leauing of quarters or coasts in respect of this tree.
                  The Oliue-tree doth encrease it selfe by shoots which it putteth forth at the soot

for being pulled vp vnhurt,To plant the Oliue-tree. and planted elsewhere, they grow vp verie speedily. And
to prepare them a faire place to grow in, you must digge them pits where you mind
to set them, a yeare before hand, of foure foot depth: and if you cannot haue holes
made readie for them so long before, but must be constrained to set them downe in
new digged ones, then you must season and purifie the said holes, by burning of the
leaues and some small branches of the Oliue-tree therein, or else some straw at the
least; for the fire drieth vp the euill iuice of the earth of the said hole in the same manner
as the Sunne should haue done by little and little all the yeare long. Some would,
that it being prickt downe of a branch, it should not be set in so fat a ground, because
the oyle would not be so excellent, as and if it were planted in a ground betwixt fat
and leane, and that not without apparance of truth. But whether it be planted in the
one or the other, it wil be husbanded euerie yeare for the space of a great circle round
about the foot: for indeed, he that tilleth and dresseth his Oliue ground yearely, doth
a great deale better than he that doth not. In anie case it would not haue the rootes
scanted of libertie, but to spread and lie at large. And if you bestow any manure vpon
it, being the thing it loueth well, then bestow vpon it Goats or Horse dung well
rotted, and that after you haue digged it about the foot, to the end that the dung may
mingle well with the earth so digged. After you haue once set it, remoue it not thence
for the space of foure or fiue yeares: neither then must you dare to be so bold, if that
it haue not gotten a stocke as thicke as a mans arme: and taking it vp, take vp therewithall
the greene turfe of the ground where it stood, and whereunto his roots sticke
fast, and when you set it downe, giue it the like situation for coast and quarter that it
had before.
                  You may graft it vpon it selfe,To graft the Oliue-tree. and it will beare more thicke and kinder fruit: or

                        •
                     e vpon the wild Oliue, but then the profit is not like, as when it is grafted vpon
the garden and 
                        •
                     ame one. The Italians graft it vpon the Vine, boring the Vinestocke
neere vnto the earth, and putting into this bored hole a small Oliue branch,
that so it may take neere at hand, and at the first offer, both the nourishment and
vinie qualitie of the stocke of the said Vine: along the which must be set a stake or
thicke prop to helpe it to beare vp the weight and burden of the graft when it is
great, and these Oliues will tast both of the one and of the other, and become as it
vvere vined Oliues. Such a proofe is not to be misliked, in as much as the variablenesse
of nature is shewed thereby, which is content to suffer her selfe to be drawne to
bring forth a mungrell fruit or second hermaphrodite, by the coupling together of
two natures in one: but the end of such experiments turne not to profit, neither
for the preseruing of the Oliue, nor for the drawing of oyle Omphacine, nor yet
any other, for vvhich ends God ordayned and gaue vs the Oliue-trees. And to
speake the truth, the mingling of kinds and differing rootes of Trees, (if it be not
according to, and jumping with the naturall vertues of them both, and according
to an agreement in some good measure of perfection, and yet furthermore well and
throughly allowed and approued by reason:) becommeth rather a monstrous birth,
and an inforcement of nature, than any profitable impe either for the health of man,
or for the sauing and sparing of it selfe. Hereof are sufficient vvitnesses, I know not
how many sorts of Apples, Peares, and Cherries, this iumbled together by offering
force vnto nature without judgement or reason: and but that they become somewhat
admirable vnto the eye, they yeeld no profit vnto the bodie of any man, more

than to draine his purse drie: except there be aduised judgement in making choyce
of that thing and way which may be both for the aduauncement of the yearely
profits of his ground, and for the good preseruation of his health. But leauing off
these discourses, let vs returne againe to the Oliue-tree, which hath both more beautie
in it selfe, and more profit for the maister, if it be contayned in a reasonable sta
                     
                        •••
                     e
for height, and spread it selfe abroad, than and if it should shoot vp and become
verie long and tall. For if it exceed the height of ten foot and a little more, it is abated
and hindered in the putting forth of so many blossomes as it would, and hath his
boughes crushed in peeces which grow vp at that pitch, when the wind bloweth
strong, and thereupon also it casteth his fruit in vntimely sort, euen when it is verie
full. For this cause in many places there are some found which perforce doe turne
downeward such boughes as grow so high, not regarding their standing out like
bosses and bunches, prouided that they be low and lurkingly couched: because that
being so trussed vp, they are free from stormes and tempests, and abound the more in
fruit: and if yet the Oliue-tree would be climing higher, then you must cut off such
aspiring boughes or braunches▪ and this must be done after the gathering of the Oliues
is past. It is true that the Oliue-tree must be eight yeare old, before you reforme
it in the boughes growing ouer high, by cutting them off with a saw: but as
for the shootes putting forth at the foot and along the stocke, you must not refuse the
cutting of them off how young soeuer they be. The profit comming both of the
one and the other, is, that it aboundeth more in fruit: and this is the cause why some
commonly say, That hee that husbandeth and ordereth it with care and taking of
paines about it, helpeth it forward in the bringing forth of his fruit; as also he which
manureth it, as it earnestly craueth: but he that cutteth downe some boughs off from
it, compelleth it by all manner to meanes to become fruitfull; seeing the nature of the
Oliue-tree is such (as Quintilian saith) as that it being cut off and made bare of
boughs and high mounting tops, it spreadeth rounder and broader, and putting forth
moe boughs, doth also beare the more fruit, because the propertie of the Oliue-tree
is to be ranke either in boughs or in fruit. It happeneth sometime to the Oliue-tree,
that it bringeth forth but one onely bough exceeding all other in beautie and height:
when this falleth out, it must be cut off without delay, for this is a signe that the tree
in space and time will conuey all his whole workemanship that way, and will leaue
nothing for anie thing else; and vpon this, will barrennesse come in the end. And
whereas the Oliue-tree craueth to be left bare and thinne of boughes, and then beareth
more fruit, yet if the boughes be stricken downe with poles when the Oliues
are beaten downe, it groweth much worse, and goeth backward, forsaking and for
                     
                        •
                     lowing
his former fruitfulnesse. So that hereupon you see, that in gathering of Oliues,
you may not beat them downe with poles, but rather you must haue ladders
borne vp vpon a Goats foot, to lift you as high, as that you may gather the Oliues
with your hand. There are some Countries where the Oliue-trees doe rest and
giue ouer bearing for one yeare after that they haue borne, and then the yeare after
that they beare out of all measure, as in Portugale, and the oyle that is made of those
is good in the highest degree. You must in any case looke to the inconueniences and
harmes that the Oliue-tree is subiect vnto.Oliue-trees full of Mosse. Many times in drie or moist places Oliue-trees
are spoyled, and become all ouergrowne with mosse, which must be taken
away with one toole or other: for else the Oliue-tree will neither abound in leaues
nor fruit.
                  Sometimes the Oliue-tree, although it be faire,The barren Oliue-tree. yet beareth no fruit, and then you
must bore through the stocke with a wimble, and put in good and deepe the graft of
a greene bough of a wild oliue-tree, or of some other oliue-tree that is fruitful, and that
vpon either side of the hole: then afterward, to close vp both the said holes with mortar
mixt with straw, and the tree as a new made thing wit become fruitful by the grafting
in of this graft. Others in such case doe vncouer the root, and renew the seat that
it standeth in▪ Againe, it may be remedied, and the foot not vncouered, with the lees
of vnsalted oliues, with mans vrine that is old, or with the stale vrine of hogges.
                  
                     
It falleth out many times that the fruit is spoyled and lost by the naughtinesse of
the ground where it is planted:The fruit spoyled. and then it must be thus remedied. The Tree must
be vncouered verie low at the

                     oot round about, and quicke lime put into it, more or
lesse according to the greatnesse of the Tree, for a little tree craueth but a little. The Oliue-tree
sometimes beareth much fruit or flowres, and notwithstanding by a secret
disease that is in it, it cannot bring them to a good end to ripen them: vvhen th
                        ••
                     
happeneth, the stocke must be vncouered round about, and the lees of oyle mixt
with sweet water afterward applied thereto.

which thing may happen through wormes or other vermine which spoyle and

falleth out that the fru

whereof, take a beane that hath a weeule within it, close vp the hole with wax: afterward
take a greene turfe from neere vnto the root of the Oliue-tree, and put the beane
in it, and so couer it with earth, and the fruit of the oliue-tree will not fall.
                  Aboue all things, you must keepe oliue-trees from Turtle-doues, Stares, and other
such like birds which are exceedingly giuen to

them in the earth a foot deepe, the sharpe end vpward, foure or sixe of them together,
taken out of great and ripe Chesnuts, and euerie hole distant from another the
space of a fadome; and two or three yeares after to plant them in some other places,
fortie foot asunder euerie one from another, and that in respect of the great compasse
which they take with their branches on euerie side. If you would haue it to grow of
a branch, it must be such a one as hath root: for to make it grow of it selfe, by pricking
downe into the earth some sience, it will neuer be. Wherefore the most certaine
way is to make it grow of the fruit it selfe, pricking it downe into the earth, as hath
beene said: notwithstanding it may be propagated or multiplied, burying and sinking
some of his new shoots in the earth. It taketh likewise, if it be grafted in the cleft
or in the Canon or Gun-like graft, and that in March, Aprill, and May, vpon it selfe,
or vpon the Beech-tree, or vpon the Willow, but it then ripeneth verie quickly, and
beareth a fruit of a sharpe and vnpleasant tast.
                  Chesnuts must be gathered in Autumne,The gathering of Chesnuts. and kept till their rindes be become of a
verie bay colour, and cast out their fruit. Howbeit, if one would keepe them a long
time, it were better to beat them downe with poles whiles they be greene, and not to
tarrie till they fall to the ground, for those will not keepe aboue fifteene daies, if they
be not presently dried in the smoake.
                  The manner of keeping Chesnuts,To keepe Chesnuts. is to couer them with common Nuts; for the
common Nut hath power to drie and inuade the excrementous moisture of all things
whereunto it is applyed: or else to gather them reasonably ripe in the decrease of the
Moone, and to put them in a coole place in sand, or in some vessell; but let in stand
continually in the coole, and so well stopt, as that no ayre may get in, for otherwise
they will be spoyled and rotten in a short time.
                  The fairest, best fed, and most pleasant Chesnut of all others, is that which groweth
in the Countrey of Lyonnoise, and are called great Chesnuts of Lyons; or else I know
not as yet from whence they haue taken their name. But howsoeuer it is, besides the
profit of the nourishment and sustenance which the Chesnut yeeldeth, the Chesnut-tree
is of great vse to make Vessels of, as Caske to put wine and other drinkes into, to
build Bridges withall, as also Conduit-pipes, Pillars, and infinite other things about
Buildings, Engines, props for Vines, Pales and Railes for Parkes, Gardens, and other
such places.
                  The leaues of the Chesnut-tree,The leaues of the Chesnut-tree. after they be fallen, are gathered vp before anie

and call them mockingly by the nick-name of Parliament-beds, because the leaues
make a noise when you lye downe vpon them, when you rise vp from them, or when

sorts of grafts, that is the best which is vpon it selfe, or vpon the sweet Cherrie-tree;
for all the rest are but meanes to cause the Plum to degenerate from his nature, and to
become bastardly, as well in their shape as in their tast. The fittest time to graft them,
is in Februarie or in March, and then rather in the stocke than in the barke.

one place, sometimes in moe: and this is a disease which being neglected, doth spread
it selfe in the end all ouer the tree, from one end to another, and bringeth it wholly to
distruction: and therefore so soone as you shall see the sicke tree in this sort to crumple

whereof it would be murdered and killed, euen to the sound and whole branches,

The Plums of Pardigoine are likewise greatly esteemed, by reason of their plumpenesse

namely, those which come neere to the Dates of other strange Countries, which are

amongst the hedges by high waies sides. It is true, that it craueth a hot Countrey,
and where it may not be debarred of the Sunne: and if it happen to be set at any
time in a fat ground, it maketh his best aduantage of it, being in this respect like vnto

it would be digged and husbanded about the foot twice a yeare, that is to say, in Autumne

a stake by it, as is vsuall in setting Willow plants, but I cannot find that this way of
thrusting it downe thus into the earth, doth proue to anie good. The Pomegranate-tree

vpon it selfe, vpon the Thorne or Quince-tree, and vpon the Peare-maine-tree,
in the barke or stocke. It must be often digged and watered: and let him that can
conueniently, lay dung vnto the foot of it, mingled with ashes, and that in verie

                  Ceruises are gathered in Autumne before they be ripe: they are gathered by handfuls
tyed together: or else they are orderly laid vpon straw to ripen them: for otherwise
they are not fit to be eaten, because of the harshnesse.
                  The wood of the Ceruise-tree is verie solide, close, and hard, and therefore in great
request to make Tables of, and other house implements, as also to make goads and
whips for Neat-heards.

fluxes of the bellie: and for this cause they may be dried in the Sunne before
they be ripe, and afterward vsed.
                  He who hath sometimes beene subiect vnto the biting of a mad dogge, or otherwise,
must not sleepe or rest vnder the shadow of the Ceruise-tree: for if hee
doe, it will hazard him to cast him into his former madnesse againe: Such is

forth and begin to be dealing the same yeare: for the dung will haue kept the roots

It taketh also of a branch, foreseene that it be set in a fat and blacke earth, which is
moist. The time to set it of root, plant, or branch, is either in Autumne or in the
Spring. It is sowne in the same seasons a foot vnder ground, and foure berries together:
and when one yeare is past, you must plant it where you will haue it abide. In
anie case you may not sow it or plant it neere vnto anie of the Lattice-worke or climbing
and running frames made for the Vine, much lesse neere vnto the plant it selfe,
because that the Bay-tree is altogether enemie vnto the Vine, as well in respect of his
shadow, as of his heat, which draweth away all meanes of growth from the Vine.
Looke in the second Booke.

Fish that is fryed, especially that which is fryed in oyle, laying them by beds one

Damaske or Frayle Raisins, if you strew of them amongst the said Raisins in the
Frayle.
                  You must obserue, as well in the leaues of the Bay-tree, as in those of the Iuniper
and Elme-tree, that they being cast into the fire, doe presently crackle, and that the
cause of this is, for that they take fire before their superfluous and raw moisture be
consumed and spent.
                  The leaues of the Bay-tree dried and rubbed one against another, if there be put
betwixt them a little powder of Brimstone, doe cast out sparkles of fire, as doth the

                         to be considered. and their distances one
from another, in respect of the trees themselues, compared one with another:
you must first consider the height, fulnesse of the leaues and
boughes, and spreading of the same, according as euerie sort of tree
doth ordinarily grow and attaine vnto: and besides the ordinarie, how by place affoording
aboundance of nourishment, the tree may exceed and surpasse it selfe in
height and breadth, for that fruit-trees would not be encombred aboue head, or ouer
his top, but would haue the breathing and blowing of certaine winds at libertie, and
with sufficient space fauourably to light vpon them, and withall, the fruition and benefit
of the Sunne: in all which points, the vnequall proportion of one tree vnto another
in height or breadth doth offer let and hinderance. And yet further, if they
would haue their waggings and plyings to and fro to be free, that so they may play 
                        〈◊〉
                     
libertie when the wind tosseth them, how greatly should the exceeding greatnesse of
the neighbour trees disturbe and trouble one another, if care and aduise be not take

in the first planting of them? And therefore you must haue regard and cast an eye about
you for this cause, that so you may well and profitably appoint out your distances
and spaces betwixt one and another: for in good and fat grounds, where trees
may grow much, you must allow more space than elsewhere. And further you must
note, that one tree planted well at libertie, whatsoeuer the place be of it selfe, doth
fructifie and beare a great deale more.
                  If you mind to plant thicke and grosse trees all on a row,The space and distance betwixt trees. and vpon high waies,
and against the hedges of fields, then you must leaue them some fiue and thi

foot distant one from another: but and if you intend to plant manie rowes in one
and the same place, then you must be sure to leaue fiue and fortie foot space betwixt
euerie two, and as much betwixt one ranke and another, that so the boughes
of each tree may the more freely spread themselues every way vpon their emptie and
vacant sides.
                  As for Peare-trees, Apple-trees, and others of that bignesse, if you plant onely
one row by the sides of your field-hedges, or elsewhere, it will be ynough to allow
twentie feet betwixt one and another: but and if you set two rowes vpon the hedge
of your Garden allies, then you must allow them some fiue and twentie feet betwixt
one and another euerie way square, in such sort, as that as well the alley as the spac
                        •
                     
betwixt euerie two trees on either side may make a perfect square of fiue and twentie
feet in euerie line: and if the distance allowed them be of lesse quantitie, then it
must be somewhat answered and helped, by not planting of them euerie one right
ouer one against another, but as if you should wrap and lay them vp one within another,
to let the full and planted place of the one side stand ouer-against the
void and emptie of the other. Some would, that there should some small trees b
                        •
                     
planted amongst those great trees which you thus set about the alleyes for the times
whiles they are in growth: but this would not doe well, if either they should be
suffered to continue there alwaies (because it would breake the rule and precept
deliuered before couching such course) neither yet if they should be taken vp afterwards;
and the reason thereof is, because they draw away and eat vp the iuice
and nourishment of the earth, vvhich should wholly bee imployed in growing
and furthering of those which are intended for the inclosing and defending of the
alleyes.
                  If you should goe about to plant a whole Field, or quarter of your Garden, with
great fruit-trees, such as before named, you must then set them checkerwise, and allow

them betwixt twentie and thirtie foot of distance the one from the other euerie way,

                     SLouthfull and negligent Hinds say, That a tree must neuer be touched after
it is planted: but a good Husbandman saith, Be still doing one good
turne or another vnto the earth and the tree, and they will doe the like
to you againe. It were true indeed, that to say that we may not touch the
tree, would haue some colour of reason, if it were to be vnderstood of the not remouing
of it from his first seat, it being good, and according to the nature of the tree:
but to say that wee should not touch it at all after it is once planted, would be either
to proue negligent, or else to be willing not to receiue anie fruit of his trees: for by
how much you are the more diligent about it, and procure it the more good and
pleasure, by so much the more encrease will it repay you againe: and he shall neuer
haue good or much fruit, that shall not be diligent in cleansing of his trees in Winter,
and in the end of Autumne.To take branches from trees. For as concerning the taking away of superfluous
and bad branches, and picking of them, it is most certaine, that a tree that busieth
it selfe much to grow wood, must haue his branches tamed about the beginning of
December, by taking away of them so manie as are superfluous, with the vnnecessarie
wood, ouer tall and high boughes, and such as hinder it from making of manie
buds to blossome and beare flower: in doing whereof, you may not touch the principall
branches.To make way for the Sunne

for the heat of the earth and dung doth engender vermine at the foot of the tree,
which eat away the rootes: or else sometime dung cast about it, doth minister such
store of nourishment vnto it, as that thereupon it is forced to put forth so great store
of shoots and siences, as that these doe make it to miscarrie, without hurting or taking
anie nourishment from anie other of the trees: So that then hereby it appeareth, that
there is need to digge trees at the foot in Winter vnto the verie quicke of the earth,
and take away from thence whatsoeuer may threaten anie danger; and as for such
number of siences, to see them planted other where, whether they be of Plum-trees,
Peare-trees, Apple-trees, or such other, and at the end of three years to graft them.
And here it shall not be amisse to note, that the siences of Hasel-tree being remoued,

if the barke of the tree begin to drie away, shewing signes of small store of

small, the earth must be taken from their feet, that so it may be mingled with dung

when it is extreame hot, there must be kept and gathered a heape of coole earth about

you must cut them againe, and graft them more low or more high than they were.
And after you haue thus cut it, you may take the vnthriuing grafts, cut off and graft
them againe, or some part of them in this new head, but somewhat deeper than it was
before in the former; and let it also be well and close made vp, euen from the first
setting of it into the stocke: and when you haue thus grafted the stocke this second
time, you must still leaue remaining and not pull away the siences which put forth
of the plants so grafted, vntill you see whether the graftes doe put forth new wood or
no; for peraduenture you might kill the plant, which yet being reserued and kept
aliue, you may graft againe the third time, if the second should die or miscarrie.

rather by amending of them with fat and well manured earth, than with water: also
wee see, that the fruits which grow in places that are not watered, are ordinarily
more sauorie, and keepe longer, than those whose earth and soyle is drencht with
water, howsoeuer that sometime the drinesse thereof be such, as that it doth hinder
and keepe the fruit from comming vnto his perfect growth and accustomed

                  Of the curing of Fruit-trees.
                  
                     EVen as all things that draw their force and take their growth from the
earth, haue some perseuerance of that which is good for them, as those
things by meanes whereof they liue: so they haue certaine speciall and
particular diseases growing vpon them by reason of things that are contrarie
vnto them, as either old age, or vvant, or ouer great aboundance of that which
should nourish them. Wherefore it is no maruell if Trees and euerie one of them
doe now and then suffer inconueniences, and such as if they be not quickly helped
and relieued, they will not faile to die.
                  All trees vvhich through force of wind or otherwise shall be clouen,Sliuen or shiuered trees. shiuered, or
sliuen, must be cured with myre, sheepes dung, and swines dung.
                  Weeds growing about trees,Weeds about trees. doe sucke the nourishment of the earth, and they
must carefully be weeded out, and the rind of the tree must be smoothed with a hedging
bill, but not in ouerthwart maner.
                  When a tree groweth not in thicknesse,The small and dwarfish tree. and is long in putting forth of branches,
and in rising on high, after that you haue vncouered it at the foot, at such time as
hath beene said before, you must cleaue asunder many of his roots, but those not of
the chiefe and principall, and put vnto them swines dung mixt with other earths,
and sometime powre downe in the place the lees of strong wine, round about the
roots: likewise if it be growne exceeding mossie, then you must cleanse it of the
mosse, with a great woodden knife, taking heed that you hurt not the barke. And
in Sommer time when the earth is too wet, it will be good to digge the earth about
the foot and roots of those trees, which were not vncouered at the roots in Winter,
and to mix therewith some thing to better the earth withall, whether it be dung or
some good mould from some other place.
                  
                     
You shall make the barren tree fruitfull,The barren tree. if you hang amongst the boughes a bagge
full of the seed of Roses, Mustard-seed, and the foot of a Weasell.
                  The file is a diseases in trees that fretteth their barks: wherefore you must cut away
this infection verie neat and cleane at the end of Winter with a verie sharpe toole,The f

and after put vpon the wound or cut the dung of Oxen or Swine, and bind it to with
old clothes, and keepe them also verie close and fast with Oziers, that it being thus
fastned, may continue a long time, euen whiles the plasters can be kept on, and made
cleaue thereto.
                  There are but a few trees but they are subiect vnto the wormes,W

                        rme in trees. and some more
than others, as Apple-trees, Peare-trees, and all such as containe within them a sweet
juice: some others lesse, as the Bay-tree, and others which beare sowre and bitter
fruits. Sometimes these wormes grow of the oldnesse of the tree, sometimes of hauing
taken a blow. Therefore against such wormes as vse to breed in the barke of the tree,
in the place where you shall see the barke swelled or houen, you must race it with a
knife, and pierce it euen vnto the wood, that so the infecting humour may issue out,
and with some hooke or crooke you shall pull out the wormes and rottennesse that is
within, and that with as much speed as you can: after this, put into and vpon the cut
an emplaister of oxe-dung or swines-dung mingled and stamped with sage and some
quicke lime, wrap it well and tie all fast, and there let it remaine and abide so long as
it can endure.
                  The lees of Wine,The iaundise in trees. or grounds of Oyle, being cast vpon the rootes of the Trees
that haue the jaundise, or else are otherwise any way sicke, doth them verie great
good.
                  There breed in Trees certaine small beasts almost like to Weeuils,Weeuils. and they are
somewhat blewish or blacke, and certaine of them haue long and sharpe pointed
peakes or bills, these doe great harme to grafts and other young Trees: for they cut
off young siences which are yet but tender, and put forth not past the length of a finger:
you must at the height of the day, when you shall see them there, lay your hand
vpon them verie softly without stirring the Tree: for they let themselues fall downe
when one goeth about to take them, because they cannot quickly betake themselues
to flight, and if they let not themselues fall into your hand, then reach vp and take
them vpon the siences with your other hand.
                  For Snailes and Ants,Against snailes and ants. lay ashes or saw-dust of wood, or the meale of lupines at the
foot of the trees, and when the raine hath fallen vpon it, stir it vp againe, and put also
new vpon it: otherwise, set certaine small vessells full of water at the foot of your
trees: or else powre lees of wine round about them.
                  When a tree letteth fall his fruit,The tree that looseth his fruit you must compasse his stocke about with Iuorie,

                  The best is to looke to Caterpillers in the time of Winter before that the trees be
leaued,Against caterpillers. and if you find any remnant or remainder of them behind, or their pallaces
or round gathered bunches, take them away with your Caterpiller crookes made
for the purpose before they be hatched. Cut not the wood when you cannot come
by them with your hand, or, as little as can be, and cleanse you trees well and throughly
in euerie place, that so there remaine not any egges, then looke vnderneath at the
feet of your trees, and see that there be no young ones, which can spin, and haue betaken
themselues thither, and setled themselues betwixt the siences and the rootes. If
there remaine any clewes or round bottomes of them in the spring, or that some blasting

cloth rub all moisture from them, and where you find any one tainted, presently cast
it out, for else they will soone corrupt one another. Now as soone as Februarie is past,
you shall take away your straw or mats both from aboue and vnderneath them, and
lay your apples vpon the plaine boards, but yet in such sort that they may not touch

Nertarines, Abricots, Peaches, Figs, Mulberries, or any fruit of the like nature; as
for your grapes, there is no readier or better way to keepe them long, than to hang
them vpon strings ouer the mantell-tree of a chimney, or where they may receiue a
moderate warmth from the fire, for nothing so soone as cold doth make them rot or
putrifie, and therefore you must by no meanes, so farre as you can chuse, suffer your
grapes to take any frosts, nay hardly the cold dewes.
               
               
                  
                  CHAP. XLIX.
                  A briefe discourse of making of drinkes of the iuices
of Fruits.
                  
                     IN such Countries as the vine cannot beare fruit in, because of the cold
distemperature and churlish roughnesse of the aire, and whereas notwithstanding
there grow singular good fruits, and in great aboundance
in recompence of the same (as in Britaine, Normandie, the countrie of
Mans, Chartraine, and Touraine) although there be the meanes to make Wine of a
certaine kind of corne, called Bier: yet by reason of the lesse cost and charges, as also
by reason of the greater profit, they vse to make diuers sorts of drinkes of fruits: and
to giue them their seuerall and particular names from the seueral and particular fruits
whereof they are made. As for example, 
                        •
                     hat which is made of apples, cider or citer,
and so the Normans and other countries bordering thereupon doe call it, as hauing a
smell or other excellent qualitie resembling the citron. Perrie which is pressed out
of the Peares, and ceruise Wine, quince Wine, pomegranat Wine, mulberrie Wine,
gooseberrie Wine, and slo
                        •
                      Wine, vvhich are made of the juices of these fruits pressed
out. And hereof vve are to obserue that all fruits are not fit to make Wine of;
but onely those vvhich vvill not putrifie easily, and haue great quantitie of Wine
juice vvithin them, of vvhich kind these are vvhereof I haue now spoken. For of
cherries there is not any Wine to be pressed, because their juice doth easily corrupt
and putrifie verie quickly: neither yet of Almonds, Common nuts, Filberds, Pine,
nuts, or other such fruits, for they yeeld an oylie and not a Wine-like humour.
But for as much as we are not determined to speake in this place of all these sorts of
fruit drinkes, but onely of them vvhich are called cider, perrie, and carasie, vvhich
next vnto the juice of the vine, are the most profitable and necessarie liquor for the
life and health of man: vve vvill set downe before hand a certaine summarie, and as
it vvere a transition and plaine declaration of and vnto as well the making, as also
of and vnto the qualities and vertues of the said cider, perrie, and carasie, and will
referre the Reader vnto the Latine Booke now long agoe looked for from Mounsier
Paulmie Doctor of Physicke at Paris, therein to read and learne the intire and
perfect knowledge of this so pleasant and delightsome a drinke. And to begin with
our purposed matter, I intend not here to stand about the finding out of the first inuentour
and deuisour of this drinke; onely I will say, that as Noe carried away with
the pleasant taste of the juice, vvhich he pressed out of the grape of the wild vine
planted by him, was the first inuentor of making and drinking of vvine: so a certaine
Norman hauing his taste vvonderfully pleased vvith a delicate and daintie taste and
rellish of the iuice of Apples and Peares, inuented the making of Cider and Perrie▪
I say, a certaine Norman, for this is in base Normandie called the Countrey of Ne
                        •
                     z,
where this drinke had first his beginning.
                  The way then to make these kinds of drinkes generally,The way in generall to make such Wine. is to gather the fruit not
all out ripe, and after to let them ripen some certaine time in the open ayre or to drie
them in the Sunne, for the spending and wasting of their waterie humour; then to
breake and crush them with Mil-stones, or such other heauie instruments; and lastly,
to presse them out: but withall you must obserue this speciall qualitie in certaine Apples,
which the longer they are kept, and the riper they be, the better and greater store
of iuice they yeeld, though then indeed it be not so durable.
                  On the contrarie, wild Peares doe yeeld more liquor, and of a better tast, and withall
of longer continuance, than doe the tame and garden ones. When the iuice is pressed
out from the fruit, it must be put into caske, for to boile therein a certaine time, and
to be ordered after the manner of the ordering of the iuice of Grapes, as we intend to
declare more particularly.
                  
                     
                     How Cider is made.
                     THe drinkes made of fruits that are most commonly vsed, are Cider and Perrie,
vvhich as they are pressed out of diuers sorts of Apples and Peares, so are they
differing as well in taste as in goodnesse. For to make your Cider, you must see that
your Apples be not wild ones, but garden and tame ones, growne and bred in orchards
carefully and diligently dressed, kept, husbanded, and ordered all the
yeare long, according to that care and diligence vvhich vve haue said to be needfull
before in speaking of the Orchard, and yet vvithout hauing any great regard
vnto the place vvhere the Orchards are planted, and doe grow, as vvhether they be
gardens, greene-plots, arable ground, or other such like places; alwaies prouided
and foreseene, that the ground be good, and vvell seasoned. And aboue all things
such ApplesWhat apples are fittest to make wine of. must haue a firme, solide, and fast flesh, accompanied with great store
of juice, of a pleasant smell, and delightsome taste, and of a beautifull colour: such
are these that follow, the Heroet, Ruddocke, Maligar, Rambur, Fairewife, Gastlet▪
Clanget, great Eye, Greening, Curtaine, Grosegraft, Rucke, long, sower, and
sweet Kennet, Barbarian, Rangelet, and Ado
                           •
                        ill. The Shortstart, Honie-meale,
and Garden-globe, notwithstanding that they be rare and singular apples, and of a
more pleasant smell, and delightsome taste, then any other sorts of Apples, yet are
they not fit to make any Cider of, as well in respect of the tendernesse and delicacie
of their flesh, as for the little and insufficient store of juice which they yeeld, not worthie
the putting into the pres
                           •
                        e to make any quantitie of Cider of. And hereto you
may put another reason; namely, that these Apples are not so plentifull, neither grow
they in such store as others doe, and therefore it is better to keepe them to eate, or to
imploy them in broths or sirope of king Sabor, and de succis pomorum, than about the
making of any common drinke.
                     The most common time to gather Apples is about mid-September,The time to gather apples. after they
haue beene partakers of Sommers heat, and receiued some small raine and gentle
vvinds from September: some being verie ripe; others yet not altogether ripe;
principally those which haue a faster and lesse delicate flesh: the greatest part
vvhereof (being kept some time) yeeldeth greater store of juice, and better concocted
and digested by the vvorke and operation of their owne naturall heat. In the
gathering of them there is necessarily to be vsed cudgels and poles, except it be that
wee lay our hands to them, vvhich vvee haue a purpose to keepe: there must in
this businesse also be chosen such a day as is faire, drie, cleare, beautifull, and full of
Sunne-shine, for if they should be moist with any raine or dew▪ they would rot in
their garners.
                     Being gathered, they must not all of the sodaine be taken in hand to be made
into Cider, but they must be suffered to take a heat in heapes, (as the Normans call
it) and be kept some three vveekes or a moneth, more or lesse, according to their
consistence and kind, seeing vnto it in the meane time (at their owne perill) that
they rot not; as also, they may be layed on great heapes in Gardens, or vnder some
roofe open to the ayre vvhen it freezeth not, or vvhen it freezeth, to court them
with straw newly threshed, or else vvith some Mattresses or Featherbeds to keepe
them from the frost. Some during the time of the frost, couer them vvith linnen
Clothes steeped in water, and vvrung out, and these being frozen once themselues,
doe keepe that the ayre cannot passe vnto the Apples to freeze them: the best of all
it to prouide them warme garners, the 
                           •
                        loores being layed neither with plaster nor
tiles, but with straw, hauing the windowes verie close, the doores firme and fast shut,
and all the creuises or chinkes perfectly stop to resist the entrance of the cold ayre.
And notwithstanding all this, yet you must not tarrie and waite vntill they be
throughly ripe, and almost vpon the rotting especially: but you must take your time
somewhat before that they be come to this exact maturity and height of ripenesse, for
else your cider will not proue durable, but withall will gather great quantitie of lee
                           •
                        ,

and grow couered with much vvhite mother swimming aloft: if they be frozen, then
trouble not your selfe with going about to make Cider, for hauing lost their naturall
and accustomed smell and colour, they haue also lost all their force and vertue,
and so it is not possible to make any thing of them but a raw, weake, vnpleasant, vvaterish,
vndurable, and soone sowring licour. When as therefore the apples shallbe
vvell prepared, and come to a good scantling of ripenesse, not such a o
                           •
                        e as is exact,
but rather of the first or second degree of ripenesse, and that they shall yeeld and
breath out a verie pleasant and sweet smell: then it shall be high time for you to
goe in hand vvith making of your Cider. Which oportunitie if you foreslow and
still stay longer for their further and exact ripening▪ they vvill vvither and fall away,
and the Cider that you shal presse out of them, wil become waterish, weake, and
sowre out of hand.
                     There are diuers wayes vsed in pressing out this drinke made of Apples in the
countrie of Neuz:The manner of pressing out the drinke made of Apples. Some doe stampe them, putting them in fats, and afterward fill
them vp with great quantitie of water, letting them ferment, boyle, and purge, so
long as vntill the water haue got the force and strength of the Cider. Others stampe
them in a morter, and after powre them together with a great quantitie of water into
some fat, not giuing them any time of concoction and purging: but these two
wayes are not so much worth; this third is better than them both. First, you must
breake your Apples in peeces, and after presse them out: the way to breake them
in peeces, is to put them in a presser made 
                           •
                        ound, and containing in compasse some
seuen or eight 
                           •
                        adome, the said compasse and round being contriued after the manner
of a trough of two foot broad and deepe at the least, in these troughes shall be
put and contayned the said apples for the better staying and keeping of them in close
together. Within these troughes there shall turne about one or two great milstones
of stone, or of some hard, massie, and weightie wood, fashioned like a wheele, carried
about vvith one Oxe or Horse, or two, so as shall be sufficient for power and
strength, as we haue said in the making of Oyles. When the Apples shall be sufficiently
broken, you must gather into heapes the same, and cast them into 
                           •
                        ubs for the
purpose, and there let them worke for a time as Wine doth, and when it hath
wrought, then you must draw out the juice or liquor (call it as you vvill) which
shall haue runne out of the substance without being prest, and turne it vp into vessels,
whether they be pipes or hogsheads, old, or altogether new; prouided that they
haue not taken any ill taste of any vnsauourie liquor: the best vessells or caske of all
other, is that wherein there hath beene Wine, and especially white Wine, for the sauour
of the Wine doth make this juice more acceptable, and more affected. The Cider
that commeth voluntarily without being pressed, is the best and sweetest, though
not alwaies stronger than that which hath abode the presse: that likewise is better
and more excellent which is made without any mixture of vvater: It is true indeed,
that when apples haue a verie fast and solide pulpe, and haue not so much moisture,
but withall some sharpe relish, that then it will not be amisse to mingle some small
quantitie of vvater with them to make them breake the better, as also, after that they
be broken by force of the turning stone, euen whiles they are working in their fats,
or before they be put into their fats a working, euen at their going to the presse, there
may vvater be mixt with them, to preuent that the Cider may not be too ranke, neither
yet too sowre or greenish. The grounds of the vvorking fat shall be layed
vpon the presse interlaced with long straw, to keepe the said stamped Apples
steedie and stayed, that they slip not to and fro when they are pressed, (the Apples
by reason of their roundnesse, not being able to stay and abide vnder the doore

by wine, without mingling of it with that which did run out vnpressed, the pressed
being the stronger, though the vnpressed be the more pleasant and sweet. The
drosse or grosse substance remayning after the pressing, shall be put againe into the

fat, and stamped, and sufficient quantitie of water powred in amongst, and it shall be
let so rest, steepe, and boyle together for the space of foure and twentie houres: after
which, there shall be made thereof spending Cider, or small drinke for the household.
For the making of this household drinke, it shall be after the rate of gathering of one
vessell thereof from so much drosse as made foure vessels of the best.
                     When the Cider is tunned vp into caske, you must let it boyle within the caske by
the bung-hole of the caske lest open, and thereby to purge it selfe of all his froth,
scumme, and other impurities, after the manner of wine: and when it is thus well
purged, you must bung it vp very close, and so leaue it to boile againe within his vessell:
but you must see that at this time the vessell be not top full, least in the boiling it
breake the vessell. And indeed this kind of Cider is a great deale more strong than
that which boileth all his boiling with the bung of the vessell open, but somewhat
more fuming, and not so pleasant as the other: and it must lye in some cellar for the
Winter time, but in some caue in the Summer.

                           •
                        , as concerning the tast, doth resemble and become like vnto Wine: for at
the first it is sweet; afterward, being fined, it is somewhat sharpe; and when it is altogether
fined, it hath then a sharper rellish, but yet altered from his former verdure:
euen after the manner of Wine, as being more pleasant when it is in fining, than when
it is fined.
                     The Cider is better to keepe than Perrie: and there are Ciders found of two or
three years old, as good, in their place, as anie Wine that is made. It is true indeed,
that it is subiect vnto the same accidents that Wine is, and it must be as heedily regarded
in the piercing of it, as if it were Wine, not giuing it any ayre in the drawing of
it, if it be possible, or if you giue it any at all, to giue it when the fossest is halfe out,
causing the ayre to recoyle before the fountaine be stopt vp and shut. So soone as the
Cider vessell is emptie, you must looke that the less be not let stand in it any long
time, because that it would breed an infinite number of wormes, which would make
it to haue an ill smell and stinke, in such sort, as that it would neuer be good afterward
to keepe any Cider. And thus much for the making and keeping of Cider. Now we
will speake of the making of our choise of the Apples.
                     To haue excellent Cider, you must make it of sweet Apples, and that but of one or
two sorts, and both of them in his kind verie good, of a pleasant tast, and sweet smell:
and you must breake and stampe them euery sort by it selfe, but put them together vnder
the presser. That which is made of sweet Apples mixt amongst some sowre ones,
is not altogether so excellent good, and yet in the heat of Summer to be preferred before
the most excellent Ciders, in that it is more cleare, heateth lesse, and quencheth
thirst better. And of a certainetie experience hath taught it, that the Cider made of
sweet Apples, hauing a soft and tender flesh, is more apt to sowre, if that there be not
some sowre ones mingled amongst them, because that such sweet Apples haue but a
weake heat, and easily ouercome and wasted. But such sweet Apples as haue a fast
flesh and thick iuice, stand not in need of hauing any sowre Apples mixt with them,
to the helping of them to make good Cider. It is true, that sweet Apples yeeld lesse
Cider than sowre ones: but yet, in as much as the sweet haue the lesse iuice and the
thicker, therefore their Cider is the better, lasteth longer, nourisheth the body more,
and is a longer time in fining: But on the contrarie, those sweet Apples which haue
much iuice, doe make much Cider: but this Cider is not so good, nor making so good
nourishment, notwithstanding it be sooner fined and readie for drinking. Sowrish
Apples doe yeeld much iuice, that is waterie, thinne, and soone fined, but nourishing
verie little.
                     The Cider that is all neat, and of it selfe, without any mixture of water, doth fine
and become cleare more slowly than that which is made with water: In like sort it
retaineth his smell and tast a longer time, and all other the vertues and qualities of the
Apples whereof it was made: for water added but in small quantitie, after sixe
moneths once past, or if somewhat longer, yet after one yeare it causeth the Cider to
sowre, and then so much the sooner, as there shall be the greater quantitie in the

mixture, as in the houshold or ordinarie drinke. Wherefore such Ciders as you
would haue to last long, must be made without water, and vse rather to mixe your
vvater vvith them vvhen they are drawne out of the vessell to drinke, if then you
find them too strong for you: and this also is the same course taken with Wine, especially
when such a sicknesse hath seised vpon the partie, as craueth a thin, weake, and
vvaterish drinke.
                     Ciders differ one from another, especially in colour, and 
                           •
                        auour, or relish: for as
for their colour, some represent the scarlet as it were like vnto Claret-wine, and such
is that vvhich is made of Apples that are red vvithin and without: such also will last
long, and fine, not vnder the colour of high Clarets, and haue a taste resembling the
same somewhat a farre off, but afterward comming neere to the resembling of Hyppocras.
Others are of the colour of Muscadells, and resembling the same also in relish.
The greatest part of the rest draw neere to a yellow colour, and some of them
cleare as the rocke vvater.
                     As concerning their relish and tast, all Ciders, if they be good, should be sweet, or
a little bitter or sowre, whether they be new or old: and it is as true, that some of them
haue no more relish than vvater. Some are of an euill taste, and that either of themselues,
or of the ground, or of the vessell, or of the straw, or of some other such strange
cause. The sweet, as well the new as the old, and fined, are the best of all, and nourish
most. But it is true withall, that the new doe swell vp a man, and cause obstructions:
The fined Ciders, are good for such as haue weake lungs, or those which are
subject to the stone, or haue vlcers in the reines or bladder. Such as are bitter, and
hold out bitter, are naught: But such bitter Cider as after becommeth sweet, is the
best of all, and lasteth long. Such as are greenish, if they continue the same colour alwaies,
are not of any value: but if in time they change this greenenesse into a maner
of sweetnesse, then they proue good, and last long.
                     You may also make Cider of vvild Apples, but such Cider although that it last
longer than that vvhich is made of tame and garden apples: yet it is not so pleasant
nor profitable for the stomacke.
                     Good housholders doe not loose the drosse of their pressings, but (as we haue said)
cast them into vessells, and vvith a sufficient quantitie of fountaine vvater, make Cider
for the houshold: many make no account of it, but cast it out to the dunghill, assuring
themselues that it drieth and maketh barren the place where it commeth. In

for to make Cider, they stampe apples, but not of all sorts, but onely wild ones
with a stamper, and afterward put them thus stamped into vessells with a sufficient
quantitie of water, and this is called Cider-pinet.Pinet.

they must be measured and
judged according to their taste, age, continuance, and abilitie to last, and the manner
of making of them. The taste is not to be tried onely by the sauour and relish of the
apples vvhereof they vvere made, vvhich vvere either sweet or sowre, or harsh, or of
moe tastes than one, or vvithout any taste at all: but likewise of the age thereof, in

in fining, or that it had vvhen it began to fine, after the manner of new vvine, which
when it commeth to be old, purchaseth and getteth diuers qualities together with
the time. Such Cider therefore as is sweet, because of the sweetnesse which commeth
of temperate heat, heateth in a meane and indifferent manner, but cooleth least
of all; and againe, it is the most nourishing of all Ciders, and the most profitable to
be vsed, especially of such as haue cold and drie stomackes, and on the contrarie, but

thus, be not subiect to the paines of the bellie, or collicke; because that sweet Cider,
pressed new from sweet Apples, is windie by nature, as are also the sweet Apples
themselues. This is the cause why Physitians counsell and aduise, that sweet Apples
should be rosted in the ashes for them which shall eat them, that so their great moistnesse
and waterishnesse, which are the original fountaine of their windinesse, may
be concocted by the meanes of the heat of the fire. Vpon the same occasion it falleth
out, that neither sweet Apples nor sweet Cider can be good for them that are subiect
to distillations and rhewmes, because of their windinesse, and for that likewise, that
as the Arabian Physitians doe iudge, they breed great store of windinesse in the
muscles and sinewes, which cannot be discussed but with great paine and continuance
of time. Amongst the sweet Ciders, the best and most wholesome are those

being to cut them in the middest, and to take away their core, and in place thereof to

harsh sweet, because they are not onely more pleasant, but also more speedily passing,
piercing, and cutting, than the other; which by reason of their harshnesse, ioyned
with some sweetnesse, and causing a thicknesse and heauinesse in them, abide and
stay long about the principall parts, where they may cause crudities and manie obstructions.

turne tart and eager, they are not lesse hurtfull than the former, and therefore they
must not be vsed but when they are well fined, and in their middleage, as wee see it
obserued in wine.
                     As concerning the compounding of them; those are the best, most wholesome,
and easiest to be digested, which are made of verie ripe Apples, gathered in due
time, and not ouer-long kept, which are likewise made of one onely kind of Apples,
or else of manie kinds, but either agreeing in tast; or else being of a a diuers tast,
yet are such as may be tempered together, and make a more pleasant tast, than if they
were alone and seuerall: as for example, if one should mingle amongst sweet Apples
such as were eager and sharpe, such a medley would make a farre more pleasant Cider,
and more profitable, than if either of the said sorts were alone. The Cider likewise
that is made of Apples onely, is better than that which is made of Apples and
Peares stamped and pressed together: better in like manner, and more wholesome,
are those which are made without water, than that which is made with water, seeing
water maketh it to lose his naturall tast, maketh it sowre and corrupt, and that it will
not last or endure long: wherefore it is better not to mix any water at all with it when
you make any, but rather at the time of drinking of it to dilay it, and powre in

that all Winter long you must keepe the windows of the cellar or caue vnder ground
where it lyeth, close shut, and well stopped with straw, or some such other thing, to
driue away the cold: besides that, Perrie is not so good for keeping as Cider is, except
it be the Carisie, or that which is made of the Peare Grosmeuill, or such other
Peares as haue a hard flesh and skinne, the Perrie whereof may be kept two yeares
vndrawne, and after they be pierced or drawne of, six weekes, foreseene they be will

                            Perrie. must be considered of and weighed in such
manner as we haue said of Cider, that is, by his tast, age, and making. The tast of the
Perrie dependeth for the most part of the rellish of the Peares out of which it is pressed,
and those are either sweet, or sowre, or harsh, or of mixt tasts, or else altogether

without tast, according to which rellishes you are to find out the vertues and qualities
of Perrie, following such forme and manner as we haue largely laid downe in the
handling of Cider. It is true, that to speake particularly of the good qualities of Perries,
the most wholesome, profitable, and of best iuice, are tho
                           •
                        e which are made of
the Peares called the waxen Peares, the same being pressed out in the Summer time,
and foreseene also that it be drunken so soone as it is fined, because it is not to be kept,
being a verie delicate and tender iuice, and therefore apt to corrupt easily and verie
soone. Next vnto this in goodnesse is the Perrie made of Peare Robart, and Muscadel
Peares, prouided that they be drunken also so soone as they be well fined, and
their lees setled, but then also they must be drunke with water, and but in a reasonable
and meane quantitie, for otherwise by the piercing smell and subtilnesse thereof
it causeth great paine of the head oftentimes. The Perrie called Carisie, or made of
the Kersey Peare, though it be one of the best and most excellent, and of those which
are last pressed, is yet to be drunke after it is well fined in a mediocritie, and allayed
with water, to represse the fuming smell of the same, which easily would take hold of
the braine. There is no cause why you should greatly esteeme, in respect of your
health, of the Perries which are pressed out of wild Peares, and all such as are vnhusbanded,
vntamed, of a sharpe tast, fat, reddish, or of those which are pressed 
                           〈◊〉
                        
of diuers sorts of Peares, not agreeing together either in tast, or otherwise, neither yet
of such as are made of Apples and Peares mingled and pressed together; as neither
of that Perrie which is newly put vp into the vessels, and not fined▪ or that which had
water mixt with it when it was made; or that which is made of the Peare called the
Wood-Peare, being stampt and put into vessels with a sufficient quantitie of water.
To be short, whatsoeuer we haue 
                           •
                        aid of Cider, it may be applyed vnto Perrie for the
most part: and yet notwithstanding all this, we are not to confesse the Perrie to be anie
whit inferior vnto Cider: for although in some Countries, as in Britaine and Normandie,
they make speciall account of Cider, and doe more esteeme of it both for the
tast, lasting, aboundance, and profit thereof, than they doe of Perrie; notwithstanding,
if necessitie should driue a man to conferre the one iuice with the other, comparing
the sweet Ciders with the sweet Perries, the sowre with the sowre, the sharpe
with the sharpe, and the mixt tasts with the mixt tasts, it would be 
                           •
                        asie to iudge, that
the Perrie is more wholesome and profitable for the stomacke and whole bodie, than
the Cider: for besides the astringent, binding, strengthening, and corroboratiue vertue
that it hath to benefit the stomacke withall, and that comming from his terrestrious
and earthie temperature, which all sorts of Peares doe most consist of, whether
they be sweet or sowre, rough, or otherwise rellished; there is yet further in the Perrie
a certaine secret and vnspeakeable vertue for the ouer-comming of poyson, and
principally the venime engendred in the stomacke by eating of Mushrome
                           •
                        , which
indeed is the Perries naturall qualitie, as left it of the Peares from which it is pressed,
Againe, wee see by experience, that the vse of the Peares is euerie where more commended
than the vse of the Apples, and that for this cause there is more carefull
heed and charge enioyned for the keeping of the Peares than of the Apples, as those
which for that cause are wont to be preserued in sugar or honey. They are also dried
in the Sunne, dried in the Ouen, and made vp in composition to serue in time and
place. It is true that Cider moisteneth more than Perrie: but in recompence of tha

Cider doth, especially the sowre or harsh Perrie, in such as are subiect vnto the collicke;
and the cause is, for that it passeth not away so speedily by vrine through
the bellie, but stayeth longer time in the stomacke, and about the principall parts,
than Cider doth, as wee haue declared in the Treatise of the Peare: For which
cause, it is better to drinke of it at the end of meat, than at the beginning, so
that the partie haue not anie vomiting, or flux of the bellie; following the coussaile
of Dioscorides, who sayth, That Peares eaten fasting bring harme and iconuenience.
                     
                        
Loe here, in my opinion, what wee are to iudge of the qualities of Cider and Perrie,
as well in particular, as in comparing of the one with the other.
                     It remaineth, that we examine what kind of drinke the Perrie and Cider are, and
whether there be anie such excellent qualitie in them as may match them and make
them equall with Wine, that so famous and highly esteemed drink

Physitian of our time could not content himselfe with matching of them together,
but went further, and preferred them before Wine in euerie thing: but this might
happen (possibly) by his being more affected towards his Country, or by being carried

anie of them to fall from the tree: Suffer them not to mellow and ripen, except
it be a verie little, for when they be throughly ripe, they are not worth a farthing
to presse out to make drinke of. You must breake them lightly in the trough
of the Presser, let the iuice worke together in the fat, after it is prest, and when it
hath wrought, tunne it vp, and lay it in some cellar, or caue, and keepe it long; for
the Ceruise drinke the longer it is kept, the better it is. You shall know his goodnesse,
by his hauing lost his sharpenesse and vnpleasantnesse, and turned the same
into the tast of Wine which is of a white colour: Or if you will not stay the full
ripenesse thereof, then dilay it with sufficient quantitie of Fountaine water, when
you will drinke it.

Walnuts about the moneth of May, or of Iune, before that their pilling become
hard, pill them, and let them steepe nine dayes (more or lesse according as you shall

boyling in clarified sugar, so long till the sugar be boyled vp to the consistence of a
sirope, afterward put them in tinne or earthen vessells made for the purpose, together

the Walnut whiles it is greene, they pricke it vpon a spindle or some such like
instrument of wood, not of yron (for yron vvould make it more blacke) and let it
steepe in water often changed, and then boyle it till it be tender: being tender, they
cast it by and by into verie cleane cold water: being cooled, they cleanse it from a
little skin which sheweth it selfe aboue the shell, and drie it with a linnen cloth, and
finally, pricke it about with cloues and cinnamome: they put it thus in vessells, and
couer it with sirope to keepe it in: if it happen that after some small time the sirope
become too thin, then they boyle it againe, and put it againe into the vessell: this is

take them out of the Iulep, and put them in a glasse vessell, and putting vpon
them the Iulep of Rose-vvater thicke ynough of consistence, that so it may affoord
them as it vvere a crust, you may if you vvill aromatize them with a little Amber

                         Peaches. you must pill them and cleanse them as carefully as
may be, and after boyle them whole or cut in quarters, in a sufficient thin Iulep, not to

boile them to the full, but onely to boile out their waterishnesse, wherewith they abound:
and then after this, in a better boiled Iulep to boile them vp to the full, till
they be become through tender and soft: and finally, to put them vp into some ea

                  To preserue Cherries,To preserue Cherries, Ceruiser, Gooseberries, &amp;c. you must chuse the fairest sowre Cherries that you can,
full ripe (for if they be not full ripe, in boiling them toward the end, you shall find
nothing but skinne and bone) cutting off their starts at the halfe, and afterward boile
them in their owne iuice with sugar, in such proportion, as that for euerie pound of

in boiling of them: when they shall be sufficiently boiled, you must put them in
glasse vessels, and powre vpon them the sirrup wherein they haue boiled: notwithstanding,
if the sirrup should still seeme waterish, boile it more perfectly. Otherwise,
and better: put apart some quantitie of your said sowre Cherries which you
shall presse to haue a sufficient quantitie of iuice: in this iuice so soone as you haue
pressed it out, melt your sugar, and (not in anie other liquor) boile them together
presently, and in boiling, scumme them: when the iuice is well scummed, clarified,
and become red, without taking it from the fire, or making it loose his boiling, put
the Cherries thereinto to boile, as long as needeth, without anie stirring of them, but
looking well to the scumming of them with a spatule: stirre them not from off the
fire vntill they be perfectly boiled, and that you shall discerne, if you see the sirrup
dropt vpon a trencher to fall into drops that doe not spread abroad, for then it is exactly
boiled: and you must put vp your Cherries into their glasse vessels good and
hot for to be kept. In this manner you shall preserue Plums, Ceruises, Gooseberries,
and such other small fruits.
                  For the preseruing of Barberries,To preserue Barberries. you shall take the fairest and goodliest bunches
of Barberries that you can find, being gotten verie drie from the tops of the trees,
and as neere as you can from the Sunne side thereof, being fully ripe, and of one entire
colour: then with a pinne or needle you shall open the side, and pick out all the
stones or kernels from the same: then to euerie bare pound of these Barberries thus
stoned, you shall take a pound downe weight of fine sugar well beaten and searced,
and so boile them on a gentle charcoale fire, till the sirrup be thicke: then let them
coole, and afterward pot them vp, being sure to couer them all ouer with the sirrup.
But if you intend to make Conserue of them,Of Conserue. then you shall not need to stone them,
but onely picke them cleane from their branches, taking all the sound berries, and
casting away all that are vnsound or spotted, and so boile them in their sugar ouer a
hot fire vntill they burst, stirring them continually with a spatule of wood or steele
made for the purpose: and then straine them through a strainer, not exceeding fine,
and squeese them so soone as is possible: then being cooled, pot it vp, and vse it as
you shall haue necessarie occasion. This Conserue is most excellent against burning
feauers, or other pestilent diseases, growing from inflammation or corruption of the
bloud: it comforteth the stomack, and begets an appetite: it cheareth all the spirits:
and being drunke in Iuleps, bringeth the bloud to his true qualitie, and taketh away
all thirst, inflammation, or roughnesse in the throat or mouth: it is also good for anie
heat in the liuer.
                  For to haue paste of Plums: first boile the Plums with a little water,Past of Plums and other fruits stirring them

sugar: set all vpon the fire to boile againe, and stirre them well, not giuing ouer vntill
all the scumme be consumed and spent: which done, make them readie as they
are where you will: afterward lay them in the Sunne to drie three daies, and then shut
them vp: and in case that they grow moist, or that there spring forth anie water out of

them, you must lay them in the Sunne againe. This patterne of making this paste,
may serue generally for the making of paste of anie other fruits, as Peares, Apples,
Cherries, and Peaches, saue that you must haue respect vnto the quantitie of Sugar,
which shall be more or lesse, according to the more or lesse moistnesse of the fruits
which you are determined to make vp in paste.
                  To keepe Peaches, or other fruits: take Peaches,To keepe Peaches and other fruits. or other fruits which you would
keepe, when it is faire weather and drie, and opening them in the middest, take out
the stone: then lay them all one day to drie in the Sunne, or in an Ouen after that the
bread is drawne out: afterward take sugar well boiled and purified, and annoint them
ouer, and lay them againe the day following in the Sunne, and so annoint them ouer
againe, and so oft as they shall drie, and vntill they haue gotten a sufficient crust, and
after keepe them at your pleasure.
                  To make Oliues readie against a day: Take greene Oliues,To keepe Oliues. and cut off a little from
the one side, after lay them in water with lime and good sifted ashes (but take withall,
that you must haue twice so manie ashes as lime, and let them steepe in that sort the
space of 24. houres:) after you shall take them out, and wash them foure or fiue times
in warme water: afterward you shal put them in a stone or glasse vessell with salt water,
and this you shall change euerie three moneths, and mingle amongst them common
Thyme, wild Thyme, Anniseed, or the ribbes and boughes of Fennell: and thus
you may keepe them a long time.
                  To preserue Oliues: lay white Oliues to steepe six daies in a vessell of Sea-water,The preserue of Oliue.
and vpon them powre the iuice of Grapes as it commeth from the presse, but fill not
the vessell too full, to the end that the sweet wine, when it shall boile, doe not shed ouer,
and when it hath boiled, you must stop the vessell: Some doe put a handfull of
salt in first, and after it the Must of new wine, and last the Oliues, and when the new

                        •
                     ine hath boiled, they stop vp the vessell: Otherwise, drie them in the shadow, in a
place that is open for the wind to enter, then put them vp in an earthen vessell filled
with honey, mixing therewithall some Spices.

in the shell, or without, by the kernell onely. To preserue them in the shell, and to
haue them verie full, large, and pleasant in tast, you shall take a large earthen pot, as
wide in the bottome as at the mouth, and then first lay therein a pretie thicke layre of
Nuts, and then strew vpon them a handfull of Bay salt, then lay another layre of Nuts
and an handfull of Bay salt, and thus doe layre vpon layre, till you haue filled the pot
vp to the top: then couer it with leather &amp; parchment exceeding close: which done,
lay a smooth stone on the top of it, and then dig a hole in the earth in some drie vault
or cellar, and set the pot therein, and couer it all ouer with the earth, and this wil keepe
them all the yeare, or diuers yeares, in as good strength, fulnesse, and sweetnesse, as if
they were but newly gotten from the trees. Some vse only to burie these pots thus filled
in red or yellow sand: and some vse not to burie them at all, but to keepe them in
a low, coole, and moist vault: and surely anie will doe will, but the first is the best, and
maketh them most full, and to haue the pleasantest rellish. But if you would preserue
them without the shels in the kernels only, then you shall open them, and pick off the
vpper red hull or skin, and in all points doe to them as was taught you before for the
Walnut.
                  To make Quince-cakes thin, and as it were almost transparent,Quince-cakes▪
                      you shall take your
Quinces and pare them, and cut them in slices from the chore, then take weight for
weight of refined sugar beaten and well searced, and onely moistened with Damaske
Rosewater, and in it boile your Quinces till it be thick, and then take it forth, and drie
it vpon a flat place-dish ouerasoft fire, not leauing to stirre it with a spoone or slice till
it be hard: then put it into a stone-mortar, and beat it very well, and if you find that it
wanteth sugar, then as you beat it, strew in more sugar, till it haue the tast you desire:
then being come to a paste, take it out of the mortar, and rowle it forth into verie thin

weight for weight of refined sugar, and to euerie pound of sugar a quart of faire running
water, and boyle them in the same ouer a verie soft fire, and turne them ouer
many times, and couer them verie close with a pewter-dish obseruing euer, that the
longer they are in boyling, the better and more ruddie will the colour be▪ then when
they be soft, take your knife and cut them crosse ouer the tops, that the sirrop may
pas

                     e through them, and make the colour entire, then take vp some of the sirrop and
coole it vpon a sawcer, and when you see it begin to be thick, then breake your Quinces
with a slice, or a spoone, as small as is possible, then straine it, and boxe it after
you haue strewed sugar in the boxes: or if you will haue it in paste or cakes, then vse
it as is before said of the Quince cakes, and so mould it, and roll it forth: Now if you
will haue it of a pure white colour, you must in all points vse your Quinces, Apples,
Peares, Oranges, or other fruit, as is beforesaid, onely you must take but to
euerie pound of Sugar a pint of water, and you must boile them as fast as is possible,
and not couer them at all, but suffer the ayre to passe away as freely as may be.
Now if you will haue it of a carnation, or more pale colour, then you shall take a
pint and a halfe of water to a pound of Sugar, and a pound of Fruit, and you shall
so couer it with a Pewter dish, that at one corner of the same a little of the ayre or
smoake may pas

                     e away, and no more: and thus obserue, that the more ayre you
suffer to goe away, the paler the colour will be: and in this case you shall neyther
suffer it to boile exceeding fast, nor verie slow, but of a temperate and indifferent
manner.
                  If you will make artificiall Cinnamon stickes.Cinnamon sticks. so like vnto the true Cinnamon it
selfe, that the one can hardly be iudged from the other, and yet the counterfeit to be
a most delicate and pleasant sweet meat, and wholesome and soueraigne to be eaten:
you shall take an ounce of the best Cinnamon, from which no water hath by anie
meanes beene extracted, and beat it into verie fine powder, well fearced: then take
halfe a pound of refined Sugar also well beaten and searced, and mixe them verie
well together: then take gumme Dragon the quantitie of a Hasel Nut, and s

Cinnamon and Rose-water, till you bring it to a fine paste: then worke it out with
your hand, after that rowle it forth with your Rowling-Pinne, then print it, and
lastly, fold it vp in the same manner that you see a Cinnamon sticke is folded vp.
Now, if where you dissolue your gumme Dragon, you also dissolue with the
same a graine or two of fat Muske, and also twice as much Ambergreece, it will be
a great deale the better, and adde more pleasantnesse and delicacie of smell vnto
the stickes.
                  To make Conserue generally of anie fruit whatsoeuer you please,Conserue of fruits. either sweet
or sowre, you shall take the fruit you intend to make Conserue of, and if it be stone
fruit, you shall take out the stones; if other fruit, take away the chore, parings▪ and
seedes, and then boile them in faire running water, to an indifferent good height:
which done, you shall draine them away from the same, and put them into another
cleane Vessell, either with white Wine, or claret Wine, according vnto the colour
of the fruit which you conserue: and then boile them to a thicke pappe, breaking
them with a Slice, or Spatule, as they boile, vntill all be brought into one substance:
then vnto euerie bare pound of pulpe, if the fruit thereof be sweet, you
shall take a bare pound of refined Sugar, beaten to fine powder: but if it be sowr

fruit, as Cherries, Gooseberries, Barberries, Bulleys, Sloes, and such like, then vnto
euerie bare pound of pulpe, you shall take a pound downe weight of refined
Sugar in powder, and so stirre the Sugar and the pulpe verie well together vpon
the fire: then taking it from the same, you must immediately, hot as it is, straine

it through a middle strainer cleane washed, and so letting it coole, then you may
pot it vp.
                  But if you will make Conserue of Flowers,Conserue of flowers. Hearbes, Leaues, or such like; as are
Roset, Violets, Gilloflowers, Mints, Basill, and such like: then you shall take the
flowers or leaues from their stalkes, and with a paire of sheeres cut away the tippes of
the vpper ends of them, and the white ends at the roots thereof, leauing nothing but
the heart and middle part thereof: which done, you shall put them into a stone
Mortar, or into a rowling Mill, or woodden Brake, and there crush, grind, or bruise
them, till they come to a 
                        •
                     oft substance, and be so like vnto a soft pulpe, that no part
of the leaues or flowers may be discerned: then to euerie pound of that pulpe, as was
before said, take a pound of refined sugar, beaten and searced into fine powder, giuing
the sweeter the lesse, and the sowre the more, and so beat them exceedingly well
together, till the sugar be generally dispersed, and then pot it vp, and keepe it for
your occasions.

of them, take forth their stone, and the innermost white rind, and beat them in
a stone Mortar with Sugar, Cinnamon, and Ginger, till they be well incorporated
together: then take it forth of the Mortar, and worke it like a piece of paste, and then

                  CHAP. LI.
                  The manner of making of Oyles: that there are three sorts of
preparing of Oyles, and how you must
make Oyle Oliue.
                  
                     INtreating in the second Booke of the Oliue-tree, wee promised a briefe
discourse of the making of Oyles, a thing certainely verie profitable
for our Countrey House, in as much as Oyle is no lesse profitable for
mans life, nor of lesse fruit and encrease vnto a good husband, than
Wine: then it shall not be from the matter, if (after wee haue spoken largely of
Gardens and Orchards, and especially of the ordering of Oliue-trees, and other
hearbes and trees whereof Oyles are prepared) we briefely doe specifie the waies of
making of Oyles.
                  And to say something of Oyle in generall, Oyle may be made three waies: The
first, by expression, which is most common, and the chiefest amongst the rest:
The second, by impression: and the third, by distillation or resolution, after the
manner of distilled waters: Wee will onely speake of the two first in this place,
reseruing the third for the Discourse which wee intend to make concerning Distillations
in this Booke; although, in verie deed, wee haue not purposely resolued
to speake exactly of the making of Oyles, because it is a thing that properly
belongeth not to the Husbandman, or his Hinde, but onely vnto a good Apothecarie.
                  To speake then first of Oyle which is most vsefull and seruiceable for the Husbandman,
because it not onely benefiteth himselfe and his familie,Oyle of Oats. but also cureth his
cattell of all manner of dangerous and corrupt diseases: you shall vnderstand, that
it is the Oyle of Oats, which may be made either by expression, impression, or distillation:
yet for your greater ease and readinesse, to haue it vpon anie suddaine occasion,
you shall make it in this manner: First, you shall take halfe a pecke, or a
quarter of a pecke, of the goodliest, best, and fullest Oates you can procure, of
which, the whitest are the best, and these you shall hull and breake from their huskes

as cleane as is possible: then take a pottle or three quarts of new milke, and setting
it vpon the fire, as soone as it is readie to seeth, you shall put into it halfe a pound
of Allome beaten to powder, and stirre it about, and so let it stand an houre or two,
in which time it will gather vnto a curd: then with your hands you shall presse
downe the curd into the bottome of the Vessell, and then straine the Whay from it
into another cleane Vessell, and presse the curd verie much, not leauing anie Whay
in it that you can wring forth: then take that Whay, and put your Oates therein,
and set it ouer a verie quicke fire, and boile it vntill you see the Oates breake, or be
as soft as pappe: then take it from the fire, and powre it gently into a small Cullender,
so as the Whay may softly draine from the same, without anie force or pressing
at all: then when it hath almost left dropping, take a cleane Frying-panne,
and put the Oates therein, and hold it ouer a gentle fire so long, as you shall see the
smoake of the Oates ascend vpward: but so soone as you perceiue the smoake to
stymmer or runne about the edges of the panne, you shall forthwith put the Oates
into a fine cleane bagge of soft old Linnen, or Boulter, and so lay it into the Oyle-presse,
and presse it with all the strength you can, and that which runneth from the
same, is the Oyle thereof, which you shall receiue into a Glasse-vessell, and
keepe it close and well stopped vp. In this manner, and with this Whay, you
may also extract Oyle from anie hard substance either of Trees, Seedes, Leaues,
Flowers, Graines, or what else soeuer, which hath anie concealed moisture remayning
within it.
                  This Oyle of Oates is most excellent for the smoothing of the skinne, and taking
away of itch, scabbe, or little pustules about the bodies of men or children: It
also purgeth most gently and sweetly, and expelleth out of the bodie all manner of
venimous and infectiue humours: it is also verie soueraigne against the stone or difficultie
of vrine, being drunke with white Wine and a corroded Nu
                        •
                     meg: Also it
feedeth much, and maketh a man strong and Iustie. It is most soueraigne for anie inward
disease in Cattell, or anie surfet taken by too violent labour: but especially it
cureth all inward diseases in Horses, being giuen either with Beere, Ale, or Wine:
but aboue the rest, it cureth the Glaunders, mourning of the Chyne, consumption
of the Liuer, or rottennesse in the Lungs: and as it cureth these inward diseases, so
also being inwardly taken (as aforesaid) it cureth all outward grieuances which
come of inward corruption, as the Farcie, Maungie, Scabbe, Leprosie, Hidebound,
the euill habit of the bodie, and such like. And as for this manner of 
                        •
                     aking
of Oyles, although it be precisely none of the three wayes before rehearsed,
but somewhat more grosse, yet seeing at 
                        •
                     auoureth of the two first, which is expression
and impression, and being so readie, perfect, and easie a thing for anie man
practise, it is no lesse to be embraced than anie of the other: for there is no place
nor no necessitie void of those helpes and furtherances which are needfull in this
Worke.
                  The manner of making of Oyles by expression,Oy
                           •
                        e by expression belongeth not onely to Oliues,
but also to manie other fruits and seedes, as common Nuts, Almonds, Nutmegs, Line-seed
Hempe-seed, and such other, whereof we will speake hereafter. Notwithstanding,
in as much as the Oliue doth yeeld more Oyle than anie other fruit or seed, it
hath deserued the name of excellencie aboue all the rest▪ for the fat and vnctuous liquors
of other fruits and seedes are not like to haue anie other name bestowed vpon
them,Oyle the proper name of the liquor of Ol
                           ••
                        es. than that which of right appertaineth vnto the liquor which is pressed out of
the Oliue: for which reason, when we speake of the Oyle of the Oliue, we onely say,
Oyle▪ but when we make mention of other Oyles, we adde the name of the fruit or
seed whereout it was pressed▪ as Oyle of Nutmegs, Oyle of sweet Almonds, and so
of the rest: Wherefore we will begin to describe the manner and fashion of making
the Oyle of Oliues.
                  When therefore you haue first gathered your Oliues,What is necessarie before the making of the Oyle. and disposed of them in such
manner as we haue spoken of in our second Booke, entreating of the Oliue-tree, consider
diligently, if the place where the Oyle is to be pressed and made, be furnished

of all necessarie things, that is to say, of fats or vessells to put your diuers sorts of
oyles in: of scoopes of yron, to draw and emptie out the oyles: couers to couer the
vessells; great and small spunges: pots to carrie out the oyle in bands and cordes of
hempe and broome barkes, and of many other things which must be prepared and
made readie befo
                        •
                     e you come to the making of the oyle, in like manner as is vsed before
the gathering of grapes. The milstones,Milstones. Oyle mills. Pressers. oyle mills, and pressers must be cleane,
as all the rest of the instruments seruing to make oyle: you must likewise haue made
sufficient prouision of vvood to make good fires, therby to cha
                        •
                     e and heat the roome
a good vvhile before hand, vvhere the oyle shall be pressed, if so be it be not warmes

that vvhich is pressed out: but seeing the treading of them is harder to doe than to
presse them, the common making of oyle is in the presse: vvherefore before you put
your oliues vnder the presse, it will not be amisse to breake their skinne and flesh with
turning milstones, and that but gently, to the end that the kernell which spoyleth
and corrupteth the taste of the oyle be not stirred: and afterward to soften and grind
them most strongly in the presse, putting in thereto of salt foure pound to euerie bushell
of oliues, and after to presse the bones or stones of the oliues by themselues. He

it out of them into others: for the more that oyle is ayred and stirred, so much the

knead and vvorke with your hands at the vapour of vvarme vvater a long time, if
you like it not better to warme them vpon hot ashes, or hot sand for the space of an

vvhich shall be vvarmed at the vapour of boyling vvater in a caldron: after put them
in a haire cloth or hempen bagge, for to presse in a presse that hath his planke hollow
and bending downeward: or betwixt presses whose plankes you haue heated:
but here in this you must note, that the Almonds are not alwaies blanched before
their oyle be drawne, because many times a mans leasure will not serue him to doe it:
though indeed it be the best way to pill or blanch them, that so the oyle may come
the more neat and pure: and to pill them rather vvith a knife than by the meanes of
water, either warme or cold, for feare that through the mixture of vvater, there be
caused to come forth great store of vvaterish and vnpleasant oyle.The drosse of sweet almonds After that the Almonds
haue beene thus pressed, you may bake the drosse vnder ashes, and vse them

of such oyles. Whatsoeuer it is,Three things to be considerd in making oyles by impression. there are three things to be considered in the making
of oyles by impression: the heat, vvhich is the efficient cause of the making of
the oyle: the qualitie of the ingredients; and the quantitie of them. As concerning
the heat, vvhether it be of the fire, or of the Sunne, or of other things which yeeld
heat, it must be measured according to the qualities of tendernesse or hardnesse
which shall be in the substances and matter: for flowers doe not craue so great a heat

                        •
                     e, that for the composition of such
oyles, men are oftentimes contented with the heat of the Sunne, or with the heat of
boyling water: otherwise called Maries-bath,To make oyles by impression in Maries-bath. or the double vessell. And I for mine
owne part jam of this mind, that for the making of these oyles there ought not
any coale fire to be vsed, nor yet any other kind of fire, but rather the helpe of Ma
                        
                           ••••
                        
                     -bath:
For as by the gentle and milde heat of Maries-bath, all the parts of the
ingredients are kept, and the oyle well prepared and digested: so by the heat of a violent
and forcible fire, there followeth rather the exhalation or combustion of oylie
things, than any digestion. The preparing therefore of such oyles as haue need of a
greater heat than that of the Sun, will be a greater deale the better, if you put the matter,
out of which you draw the oyle, in a glasse or tin vessell for to be infused in oyle
mingled with Wine or vvater, or other conuenient liquor, or without liquor, according
as the nature of the ingredients, and the present thing requireth. After that this
vessell borne vp with the small slips of broome or straw, hath infused three whole
daies in Maries-bath, that is to say, in caldron full of water somewhat boyling; or
(which is better) the vessell not infused or standing in the water, but rather receiuing
onely the vapour of the boyling vvate

                      that is in the caldron, those three daies
being spent, you may presse out the things, which you shall haue infused, strayning
and forcing them through some strong strainer and thicke linnen: and afterward to
put in other new ingredients if it be needfull (that is to say) vntill the liquors which
you haue mingled with the oyle, or the humiditie and moisture which may rise of
the ingred

                     ents be consumed, and that the oyle may seeme to haue gotten out all the
strength and vertue of the ingredients, and then to straine and force them as before.
This is the way that is to be taken for to prepare oyles well by impression. It is true
that with lesse cost and a great deale sooner they may be prepared, in putting the

                        •
                     atter into some great brasse pan vpon a coale fire, causing it to boyle with a small
fire vntill the liquor put vnto the oyle or the moisture of the ingredients be consumed:
and after strayning of them after the manner that hath beene sayde before.
                  Furthermore it vvill be discerned that the oyle hath exactly drawne out the vertues
of the ingredients,To know if the oyle be made▪
                      and that the liquor mingled with the oyle or moisture of the
ingredients is consumed, if with a spatule or sticke of vvood you cast some few drops
of the said oyle into the fire: for if they be all on a flame by and by, it is a signe that
it is pure and near, but and if it spatter, there is yet some waterish moisture remaining
in it: furthermore as it is boyling in the caldron, it will be spatering and casting vp
bubbles, so long as there remayneth any of the liquor or moisture: but after that it is
spent and boyled away, it will be quiet and peaceable: likewise a drop of oyle dropped

vpon your hand, if there be any moisture in it of waterishnesse, it will shew it sufficiently,
for it will swim and ride aloft vpon the same.
                  As concerning the qualitie of the ingredients,The qualitie of the ing

                        edients. Cold oyles. Hot. Tender. Hard. it consisteth principally in this, that
the ingredients are either hot or cold, or tender, or tough, and hard. I

                      they be cold,
there is need that they should be often shifted and changed in the oyle, for the better
imprinting of their cold qualitie in the oyle, for although that oyle oliue be temperate,
notwithstanding it inclineth more vnto heat and a firie nature, than otherwise:
so that it is requisite to change the ingredients often, and to put new in their
places for that cause; yea, and in regard thereof to wash the oyle in some common
water, as we will further declare in speaking of oyle of roses: if the ingredients be
hot,Hot oyles. it is sufficient once onely to change them for the composition of hot oyles,
and that by reason of the affinitie and agreement betwixt the Oyle and the hot
things.
                  If the ingredients be hard,Of the tendernesse or hardnesse of the ingredients. and not easily digested, and imparting their properties
vnto the oyle, they must be infused before they be boyled, and also there must be
put unto their decoction some liquor, as Wine, or some conuenient iuice or other
liquor, as well to helpe their digestion, as to keepe them from burning, or getting
some loathsome smell: but and if they be tender, they craue sometimes a simple infusion
in the heat of the Sunne, or vpon a slow fire without any boyling: and this
way fitteth flowers: sometime a light boyling without any infusion, as many aromaticall
things.
                  And as concerning the qualitie of the ingredients,Oyles made of liuing things or their parts. you must obserue that oyles by
impression are made, not onely of the parts of plants, but of liuing things, their parts
and excrement, vvherein there must not be any shifting, changing, or renewing:
and besides these, there is no other thing to be obserued; except that if the beasts be
small, that then they be killed in the oyle, as it vsed in oyle of scorpions, serpents,
frogs, and pismires: but and if they be great, they must be first killed, them bowelled,
and lastly, boyled in the oyle, as is done in the oyle of Foxes.
                  Touching the quantitie of the ingredients,The quantitie of the ingredients. by which the oyles made by impression
are called simple or compound, you must haue regard to see that when the oyle
is compound, that this order be followed, that is, to take the ingredients of greatest
and hardest substance, and to infuse them three daies: afterward those of lesse
substance two daies: and those which are the most tender, subtile, and aromaticall
one day, and one night: and then afterward to boyle them in order, strayning
them but once, and reseruing your Gums to mixe and dissolue with the said strayned
oyle, according as it shall be requisit, if so be that any gums doe goe into any
such oyles.

                     AS for Oyle of Roses,Oyle of Roses. it is thus prepared: Take of oyle of new oliues so
much as you shall thinke needfull, that is to say, sufficiently to infuse your
roses in: vvash it diligently, as well to coole it, and make it more temperate,
as also for to make it the more pure, if in case it should be any vvhit
salt or feculent, and thicke of the Lees. Such vvashing it made with an equall portion
of water and oyle, stirring them together in a vessell, vntill such time as they be
mingled and incorporated, and then so leauing them till they seperate themselues
one from another againe: vvhich being come to passe, there shall be a hole made in
the bottome of the vessell vvhere they are to let the vvater runne out: after, there
must other vvater be put in to beate with the oyle as before, and this shall thus be
gone ouer three or foure times: but and if there be any hast to be made in this vvashing

of the oyle, then the vessell shall be kept in some warme place, to the end that
the oyle and water may be the sooner seuered: and you must note that the oyle is not
to be washed on this fashion, except it be for cooling oyles, as oyle of Roses, Violets,
and such like: it is verie true, that there will be no need to wash any oyle at all, if you
haue the oyle of greene oliues called Omphac

                     e. This washing of oyle being finished,
haue in readinesse a sufficient quantitie of blowne Roses, put them to infuse in
this washed oyle, in a vessel hauing a narrow mouth, like a pitcher or a glasse bottle,
or some one of Tin, and filled vp within a quarter of the top, and afterward well closed
and stopt: set them in this sort in the Sunne, or some warme place, for the space of
seuen daies, boyle them afterward in a double vessell in boyling water, as we haue
said, or else boyle them in a brasse kettle vpon a small fire without any flame for the
space of two or three houres: vvhen the oyle hath boyled and wasted one part of the
moisture that was in it, it will be conuenient to straine it through a strong strayner,
and thicke linnen cloth, and after to put into it new Roses againe, doing as you did
before, and that for three seuerall times: in the end, after it hath beene strayned, some
put into it as much water of the infusion or other Roses, infused in water, as there is
Oyle; then you shall set it in the Sunne for the space of fortie dayes, which infusion
may be seuered from the oyle afterward as the water wherewith the oyle was vvashed.
Notwithstanding it may be sufficient to take the infusion of the Roses in oyle onely,
vvithout the putting of other vvater in the infusion. Some mingle now and
then in the decoction of Roses a little vvine, or juice of fresh Roses to keepe the oyle
from burning,Two sort

further note, that some prepare and make two sorts of oyle of Roses: one oyle of ripe
oliues, and roses all opened and spred, vvhich are the better if they be red: the other

vnto the seames or hollow places that are within the Wine vessell, not that which

aloft on the vpper part of the vessell, for that is too frothie and scummie, but that
vvhich cleaueth round about vnto the staues of the vessell wherein there hath

beene verie good white vvine, rather than red: make it into fine powder, and make
it fast in a linnen cloth, infuse it in verie good vvhite Vinegar: or not infusing it, calcine
it, and put it in a Hypocras bagge, or in an oxes or swines bladder: afterward,
roast it vnder hot embers, vntill it become vvhite: you shall know if it be sufficiently
burned, by the growing of it cleare, and a little burning of your tongue, if you
touch it therewith. Notwithstanding you may blanch or whiten it, if (as some hold
it for a great secret) you boyle it a long time in vvater, scumming it often: powder it
yet once againe, or (which is better) calcine it: then put it in the bottome of an hypocras
bagge, that is to say, of a bagge vvhich hath a sharpe and narrow bottome, and
this you shall hang vp on high at some staffe in a caue or other cold place for the

of itchings, Ring-wormes, Scurfes, Scalles, and other such diseases of the skinne:
It maketh the face vvhite, cleane, and seeming young: it taketh away vvrinkles and

balme is no vvhere to be found, and that in place thereof the industrie
and skill of man hath inuented Oyles which approach and draw
neere in vertues and faculties vnto the true balme: now therefore be it
in like manner knowne that these Oyles are made either by distillation or impression:
and that vve will speake onely of some certaine ones which are made by impression,
ceasing to speake of those which are distilled for them which meddle in drawing
out the quintessences of things, as you shall further perceiue by our Booke of secret

new, or of the oyle of sweet Almonds or Linseed, and infuse them a long time in the
Sunne, or in Maries-bath, or in horse-dung that is verie hot, or in the earth in a vessell
that is well couered ouer with sand, and let it remaine there one whole yeare, or
else two, vvhich is the better; you may likewise make this oyle of the leaues and
little cods without the fruit: some with the apples put together with the oile of sweet
almonds or linseed oyle, doe joyne of liquid varnish one ounce for euerie pound of

or Alchymist (otherwise called an extracter of quintessences) than of a
farmer or maister of a Countrie Farme: notwithstanding the profit
thereof is so great, and the vse so laudible and necessarie, as that we take
not the chiefe Lord of our countrie house to be furnished vvith all such singular commodities
as vve desire, if he lacke the knowledge and practise of distillation; not
that I vvould have him to make it a matter to trouble himselfe much withall, and to
be at much cost and charges therewith, as many (not well aduised) men be now adaies:In leasure to take the opp

but onely that he would take his time thereto at his best leasure, and without any
great expence; or else to leaue the same to his wife or his farmers wife; for indeed
such occupation is farre better beseeming either of them than him; for as much as the

                  Distillation,Distillation. or the manner of distilling, is an art and meanes whereby is extracted
the liquor or moisture of certaine things by the vertue and force of fire or such like
heat (as the things themselues doe require:) no otherwise than, as we see here below,
that by the force and power of the Sunne manie vapours are lifted into the middle
region of the ayre, and there being turned into water, fall downe in raine. True it
is, that the word, Distill, sometimes reacheth further, and is taken not onely for
things that are distilled by the meanes of heat, but without heat also: as wee see it

things are not only distilled without heat, but with cold: as nemely, when the things

craue the heat of Horse dung, or boiling water, or the vapour of boiling water, or of
Wine boiling in the fat, or of vnquencht Lime, or of some Barke, or other putrified
thing. And for this cause she shall marke and obserue foure degrees of heat: the first
whereof shall be called warme, like water when it is halfe hot, or the vapour of boiling
water, and in this there is no feare of anie hurt it can doe: the second is a little
hoter, but yet so, as that it may be well endured without anie annoyance or hurt, such
as the heat of ashes or embers: the third is yet hoter than the second, and so, as that it
may annoy and hurt one grieuously, if hee should hold anie part or member therein
anie long time, such is the heat of small sand. The fourth is so vehement, as that it
cannot without great paine very hardly be endured, and such is the heat of the scales
of filings of yron. The first degree is fit to distill fine, subtle, and moist things, as
flowers and cold simples, as Endiue, Lettuce, and such other: The second, for distilling
of fine, subtle, and drie things: of that sort are all fragrant or smelling things, as
Pepper, Cinnamome, Ginger, Cloues, and manie simples, as Wormewood, Sage, &amp;c.
The third, for to distill matter that is of thicke substance, and full of iuice, of which
sort are manie roots. The fourth is proper for the distilling of mettals and minerall

things, as Allome, Arsenicke, &amp;c. By this meanes it will come to passe, that the
Mistresse of our Countrey House shall not haue anie thing brought vnto her, out of
which shee will not be able to draw the waterie humour, and to distill cleere and
bright waters.

                  What manner of vessels and instruments they must be wherein
waters are to be distilled.
                  
                     TWo vessels are needfull in distilling, which may be called by the common
and generall word, a Limbeck: the one of them is properly called
the containing vessell, because it receiueth and containeth the matter
that you would distill▪ some call it the bodie, or corpulent vessell▪ or the
gourd: The other is ordinarily called the cappe, head, or bell, being that whereinto
the vapours are gathered and turned into water. This vessell hath sometimes a pipe,
in shape like the bill of a bird, through which the water passeth drop by drop into a
violl, or other like vessell: and sometimes it hath no beake or spour, and those are v

in circulation. But these instruments doe differ much, as well in forme and shape, as
in matter. It is true,What distilling vessels were

                        irst inuented. that the first that were inuented were of Lead, like vnto a Bell,
and did couer another vessell of Brasse that was full of matter to be distilled: this fashioned
one is well ynough knowne and vsed eueriewhere, because it draweth out
more store of water than anie other. Afterward there was another fashion inuen

a great quantitie of water; the figure and forme whereof you may here see
and behold.
                  
                  But in as much as waters distilled in Lead doe not retaine their smell or tast at all,
neither yet anie of the rest of their qualities of the things whereof they are distilled;
but doe rather smell of the smoake, or of a stinke of burning: as also, for that waters
distilled of sharpe, biting, and bitter plants, doe no whit resemble the same in the

                        •
                     ast of their bitternesse and sharpenesse, but rather become vnsauourie sweet, Further,
in as much (as Galen witnesseth) as the water which runneth through pipes of

Lead doth stirre vp oftentimes the bloudie flux in those that drinke it, because of
his nature, which is of the substance of Mercurie: adde vnto these, that in as much
as wee ordinarliy see the waters distilled through Lead to become oftentimes (with
the sharpe and vehement vapour which it maketh by the reason of a certaine sale
dissoluing it selfe from the head) spoyled and made white and thicke as milke:
I say, for and in respect of all these reasons, there is inuented another instrument,
called the Bladder, whose vnder vessell and cap couering the same, are both of
Brasse, and both of them standing ouer one 
                        •

                     e, but
also of all other sorts of Plants powred in thereto, with a good quantitie of common
water. Moreouer, it is requisite that the head should haue a great beake or
spout, which must passe through the inner side of a great caske full of water, to the
end that the vapours breath not out, but grow thicke, and turne into water: The
fashion of it is as you may see here.
                  
                  The later and better aduised Physicians haue deuised a fashion much better than
the former, which is, to distill waters in Maries bath,Waters distilled in M
                           •
                        ries bath. that is to say, in the bath of
some boyling water, or ouer the vapour of the same: for it is verie certaine, that such
waters are without all comparison better, in as much as they doe exactly retaine, not
onely the smell, but also the 
                        •
                     ast, and other qualities of their plants: which happeneth,
because the bath of the boyling water, by his moisture, retaineth, keepeth in,
and preserueth the more subtle parts of the plants, and by this meanes hinder and
stay them from resoluing and breathing out: as it commeth to passe in those which
are distilled by a violent fire of wood or coale: which is the onely cause that there
is so great difference betwixt the waters distilled in a Limbecke of Lead, and those
that are distilled in Maries bath, as is betwixt Gold and Lead: because they doe
not onely retaine the proper qualities of their plants, that is to say, their smell and
tast; but likewise they become cleare, pure, and bright, without smelling anie thing
of smoake, or burning: on the contrarie, the other alwaies h

is easie to be gathered and knowne by the white residence that setleth in such waters,

which hath serued a long time, hauing gotten by long space, and being much distilled
in, as it were a plasterie crust or hardnesse ouer all the parts of it, is not so easily
altered by the vapours, nor turned into Ceruse. And indeed it is no maruell, if the
vpper face of the Lead be changed into Ceruse by the sharpe vapour of the plants,The making of Ceruse.
seeing that Ceruse it selfe (as Dioscorides testifieth) is made of plates of Lead hanged
ouer the vapours of vineger, and spread vpon hurdles made of reedes: but there befalleth
no such accident to waters distilled in Maries bath:The cause that maketh waters dist

harshnesse, eagernesse, sweetnesse, and tastlesnesse, if they be distilled of bitter or
biting plants, or yet of anie other tasts and qualities: and this falleth out so, because
the head of the Maries bath is of Glasse, which cannot infect them with any strange
or vnnaturall qualitie. Moreouer, the waters that are distilled in the vessell called a
Bladder,Waters distilled in the ins

but yet ouer-laid within with Tinne, are much better, and of greater vertue, than
those which are distilled in a Limbecke of Lead, because the fire of the furnace
cannot burne nor infect with anie smoake the matter that is within, seeing they are
couered ouer and boile in water: but notwithstanding they doe not throughly retaine
the vertues thereof, because of the mixture of the water, which smothereth and
dulleth their force and vertues.The waters distilled ouer the vapour of boyling water, Wherefore wee must needes commend as best the
waters which are distilled in the double vessell, or ouer the vapour of boyling water,
especially when as therewithall they are of a hot facultie. It is true, that amongst
them, that sort is better which is distilled ouer the vapour of boyling water,
than that which is distilled by putting the bodie containing the matter, into the
boyling water, because it extracteth and draweth out the subtle parts therein a
great deale better: albeit that both the sorts thereof are excellent good, neyther
is there anie hurt at all in them,The

                      saue onely that they are not of so long lasting and
continuance as others: but to helpe this in such things as need shall require, it
will be good to distill one and the same thing often, that so you may alwaies haue
them good.
                  But to come to our third kind of Instrument, which wee haue called the double
vessell, or Maries bath, it consisteth of two parts: the one is a great vessell of
Brasse, made in manner of a Beefe-pot, verie great, and raysed high, furnished with
a couering, and it is set in a furnace, and containeth in it boyling water: The other
is the Limbecke, whose bodie is likewise of Brasse, so set within the couer of the
Cauldron, as that the one resteth vpon the other, and that the one cannot be put in
or taken away without the other: The head thereof is of Glasse or Tinne, or of
baked earth: in the couering of which, there must be a hole made in that sort, as
that it may be alwaies close: it would be at one of the corners thereof; and the vse
of it is, to powre boyling water into the Cauldron, when the water within the same
is diminished after long time of boyling: The fashion of it is as you may see here
ouer the leafe.
                  
                     
                     
                  
                  There is another sort of double vessell, which containeth foure Limbeckes, whose
bodies set within the bath, may be either of glasse or tinne, and their heads of glas
                        •

besides these foure, there is another standing higher than the rest, and is heated onely
of the vapour of boyling water, which 
                        •
                     iseth vp on high vnto it through a pipe, and
this Limbeck maketh a better water than the other foure. All these vessel

                      being well
coupled and incorporated together, doe rest vpon the Caldron, or great Bras

as that there may not anie vapour breath out: in like manner, all these instrument

and vessels be so well ordered and contriued, as that they may seeme to be but
one bodie, saue onely that the heads of euerie one must be so, as that it may be separated
from the bodie, and put to againe, when you haue anie need to distill water: the
fashion of it is such as is here to be se

There are some that haue yet seene another sort of double vessell, and that a verie
excellent one, whose bodie is Tinne, like vnto a great Vrinall, of the length of three
good 
                        •
                     eet, verie wide and large below, and somewhat narrower aboue: The bottome
or bellie thereof is set two good foot in boiling water, and the top standeth out of the
water a foot good, and that in a round hole made in the middest of the couer of the
Cauldron. Vpon the top of this bodie is placed a head of Tinne, couered and compassed
also with another vessell of Tinne likewise, and much more large: this is to
containe cold water, running into it through a Brasse pipe or cocke: it is to stand vpon
the top of a shanke, and that for to coole the Limbeck continually, that so 
                        •
                     he vapours
rising vp thither, may thicken the better, and be the sooner turned into water.
And because it is not possible, but that the water which is contained in the vessell that
compasseth the Limbecke, should become hot in succession of time through the heat
of the Limbecke: this vessell hath a small pipe or spout, at which the water so heated
is vsed to be lee runne out, turning the little pinne of the cocke; and it is filled againe
presently with cold water, which is made to runne down into it from a vessel on high.
But to the end the labour of emptying it so oft of his hot water, and putting in again
                        •
                     
of cold, may be remedied, things may be so carried, as that from the vessell which
standeth vpon the top of the pillar there may be cold water continually running into
the vessell compassing the Limbecke: and then it being once become hot, may be let
out, as is said before. And to the end that the cauldron which containeth the bath may
alwaies keepe full at one measure and quantitie of water, which otherwise is sure to
diminish by the continuall and vehement heat of the fire of the furnace; there is at the

                        •
                     oot of the pillar another vessell full of verie hot water, which is to be conueyed into

                        •
                     he bath by a cock, or pipe: and this water is heated in his vessell by the same fire that
the bath is heated, in as much as the wall of the pillar is hollow and emptie euen as low
as the bottome of this vessell. This sort of double vessell is fit to distill waters withall
in great store and aboundance, by reason of the cold water which thickeneth and tur

                     th
by and by the vapours into water. The shape and fashion is as you see.
                  
                  The Venetians distill their water in such an Instrument: The furnace is round,
and containeth on euerie side, round about it, manie earthen vessels, glased within,

and fashioned like Vrinals, well luted with mortar of Potters clay, and euerie one couered
with a head of Glasse, or baked earth: to their snouts there is fastened a violl
with a good thicke thread, to receiue the water that distilleth. This furnace is heated,
as we see, after the manner that the Germanes doe heat their Hot-houses, and we ou
                        •
                     
Stoues. And if it happen, that the fire should be too hot, you must not put any thing
into the vessels, vntill such time as the heat be somewhat abated, for feare that the
plants, flowers, and such other things should be burnt. The mouth of the 
                        〈◊〉
                     
must be alwaies stopped and fast shut, to the end that the heat may beat inward for
the heating of so manie vessels. For the attending and ordering of this furnace, there
are required manie seruants: some of them to looke vnto the 
                        •
                     ire; others to cast the
hearbes into the bodies; and others, to put the heads vpon the bodies. By this likewise
there may great store of waters be distilled, as some hundred pints in a night and
a day: and these waters are a great deale better than those which are distilled in leaden
Limbeckes or Stillitories, or yet of other mettals, because they are not infected
with anie fault or infection, which is a common companion of those which are made
of mettall. This is the shape and forme of it.
                  
                  There are other Instruments, the bodies whereof are of Brasse, Iron, or other mettall,
hauing a long, thicke, and strait necke, on the top whereof resteth also a head of
Brasse, made after the fashion of a broch steeple, and is compassed round about as

sooner, and in greater quantitie, into water, and that the water may not tast or sm

mettall, verie long, and wrythen or wound about in forme of a Serpent (and for this
reason is called a Serpentine) or made of manie parts, consisting of direct angle
                        •
                     , and
these passing through a bucket, or some such vessell full of water.
                  There are manie other sorts and fashions of Instruments to distill withall, whereof
I meane not to speake at this time, contenting my selfe with those which I haue mentioned,
as being of more common vse, and fit onely to distill waters: of which, it is our
purpose onely to speake at this present.
                  
                     
Furthermore, seeing the water doth take his essence and consistence, and other
like qualities, from the head of the Stillitorie, it is good to make choice of the best
heads that one can:Chusing of the

and not taken inwardly. Such as are not afraid of the cost, doe vse vessels of Gold or
of Siluer: but seeing all are not of one and equall efficacie, it is best to rest contented
with Glasse-vessels, or earthen ones well leaded, either with Glasse, or the fat, which
is called earth of Beauuais, rather than with Lead, or anie other mettall: notwithstanding,
those of earth are the best: the second, those that are leaded or glazed, or
of thicke fat earth:How to order Glasse-stills. next, those of Tinne. Those of Glasse must not be of brake mettall,
but of Crystall earth well armed: which, seeing they cease not to be brittle, how

is ended, to let them coole by little and little. And for as much as the head is loose
from the bodie, it will be good to set them together with a hempen cloth which hath
beene dipped in the mortar of Wisedome, which for the most part is made of the
whites of Egges, Beane flower, and a little Masticke. The vessell whereinto the water
is receiued, and thereupon called the Receiuer, shall be a Glasse-violl, hauing a
long necke, and the beake or spout of the head must goe into it; and these two, in
like manner, may thus be fastened and closed together with the said mortar of Wisedome,
least the water which shall distill, should euaporate verie much: notwithstanding,
that we see sometimes some Receiuers of the fashion of Vrinals, which are not
made fast vnto the beake of the head at all.

                      as well in
respect of the matter to be distilled, as in respect of the vessels which are
vsed in the distilling thereof. As concerning their matter, some are
made of vnburnt bricks, onely dried well in the Sunne, because they
are better to be handled than those that are throughly burnt, and besides, they may
be cut with a toole, and brought into what fashion one will; and fitted with fa

earth; othersome are made of plaster onely; some of fat earth onely; but the best are
made vvith cement, vvhites of egges, fat earth, and flockes of vvooll; others of beaten
bricks, hards, horse-dung, sinewes of oxen, and fat earth. But as for their fashion,
it must be answerable vnto the vessells that are set therein; and so some be
wholly round, and those are the best and most profitable; others are foure square;
others are raised high like steeples; others after the fashion of vaults; some after the
manner of stones: all which you may find out by the sight of the eye in the patternes
set downe before, and from which you may gather more instruction and
more certaine direction, than by all the descriptions that wee can possibly make.
Such furnaces as you may see with your eyes, must haue two bottomes; the one
lower, to receiue the ashes of the coales, or whatsoeuer other matter that the fire is
made of; the other higher, which must containe the burning coales, and must be
made after the fashion of a Gridyron, hauing barres or roddes of yron passing

throughout from the one side to the other, quite ouerthwart the furnace; or else diuided
into manie small holes, that so the ashes and small coales of fire may fall through
to the bottome below the more easily, and not stay behind to choake vp the fire that
should heat the Still. The vnderfloore may haue one or manie mouthes, for the
more conuenient taking away of the ashes which shall be gathered there on a heape:
but as for that aboue, it must haue but one onely of a reasonable bignesse to put the
coales or wood in at; but in the roofe of it, it must haue two or three small holes, to
giue aire and breath vnto the fire at such time as you mind to amend it. Euerie one of
the mouthes shall haue his stopple. For want of a furnace or matter for to make one,
you may fit and set your Ves

                  How the matter must be prepared before the
waters be distilled.
                  
                     IT is not ynough, that the furnace and instruments for distillation be
made readie in such sort as wee haue said; for the matter to be distilled
must in like manner be prepared before that it be put into the Still.
This preparation is of three sorts: that is to say, Infusion, Putri

to be distilled, but also to cause and procure greater store of iuice to be in it:

to helpe them to keepe their smell: or else to bestow vpon them some new qualitie:
or to encrease their force and vertues; or else for some other ends, as we will handle
them in particular, and onely one. It is true, that this preparation is not necessarie
for euerie matter: for some there are that need not anie infusion or steeping, but
rather to be dried before they be distilled, by reason of their too great and excessiue
moisture: othersome content themselues with being watered or sprinkled ouer lightly
with some liquor, as is done in the distilling of drie Roses and Ca

are wont to be sprinkled onely with common water. Some spread them all a Summers

moist, to distill them. Such as are steeped and infused, lye in the Sunne, or are held

consequently of such other matter or things. The liquors wherein infusions are to
be prepared, must not onely answere the qualities of such matter as is to be distilled,
in such sort, as that hot matter and things be infused in hot liquors, and the cold in
cold; but likewise the scope and dri
                        •
                     t intended in the thing distilled, which is the
onely cause of the vsing of varietie of liquors in the making of infusions; and these

are for the most part Raine water, Fountaine, or Rose-water, and they either raw or
distilled, crude or distilled iuices, distilled waters, Aqua vitae, raw or distilled Vineger,
Wine,What kind of things are infused in wine. raw or distilled Vrine, Whey raw or distilled, mans bloud, Swines bloud,
and Goats bloud distilled or vndistilled. For this respect, things that haue small
store of iuice, as Sage, Betonie, Balme, and Wormewood, or which are verie fragrant,
as all sorts of Spices, all sorts of odoriferous Hearbes, all aromaticall Rindes
or Woods, as Cinnamome, would be infused in Wine, to the begetting of some reasonable
store of iuice in them which haue but a little, and to keepe the aromaticall
fragrantnesse in those which smell sweet, which might otherwise euaporate and
spend, through the heat of the fire, their best and most precious parts, they being of
so thinne and subtle a substance. It is true, that the best and surest course is not to infuse
Spices, or aromaticall things, neither in Wine, nor in Aqua vitae, but rather in
common water: because in distilling of them, as proofe will make triall, the vapours
will rise too soone, and leaue behind them the vertues of the aromaticall things,
whereas water will not goe vp before it haue them with it.What mat

as are hard and mettallous, as Pearles, Corall, shells of egges, Crystall, Emeralds, 
                        〈◊〉
                     ,
and other such, are infused commonly in raw or distilled vineger, or else in
vrine distilled or vndistilled: but such waters are not to be taken inwardly, but onely
to be applyed outwardly. In like manner, when it is intended that a water shall
haue an opening qualitie, and pierce deepe or swiftly, the matter thereof may be infused
in raw and crude, or in distilled vineger: as for example, the waters distilled
against the stone, or grauell, or to take away the great obstructions of the liuer,
spleene, and matrix. When you desire that the water should retaine and keepe in
good sort the vertues of the matter whereof it is distilled, it may, for the better infusing
of it, be distilled in his owne iuice, or in some iuice obtaining the like vertue.
Things are likewise sometimes infused in bloud, either of Men, Swine, or Goats,Infusions in the bloud of Man, a Swine, or mal

be thought of the Whey of Goats milke, wherein things are wont to be infused

more: and by how much this fermenting and preparing of the thing is the more substantially

                     AFter that the matter is in this manner and fashion prepared (as we haue said)
there remaineth nothing more to be done, but the putting of it into the
Stillitorie: and herein you must carrie your selfe very wisely and discreetly,
in obseruing certaine generall precepts for the ordering and directing
of the whole worke vnto a good and perfect end.
                  First prouide,Furnaces must be set in a place where they may not do
                           •
                         or take hurt. that your furnaces be set in such a place, as where they may not endanger
the setting of your whole house on fire; as that they also may not be subiect
to haue any thing to fall vpon them.
                  If you distill Quicksiluer, or any other such thing which hath a venimous malignitie,When we are to stand farre off from the 
                           〈◊〉
                        , and not to come neere them.
come not neere vnto your Stills all the time of the distilling of such matter:
for the smoake or fume which at that time they breath out, doth draw vpon a man
the Palsie, exulceration of the Lungs, Lethargie, or oftentimes sudden death: as
you may see by experience in such as are Plummers, and employed in melting of
Mettals.
                  If you distill in Glasse vessels,The chusing of Glasse-stilles. you must make choice of such as are well baked and
seasoned, hauing no bubbles or knots, but equall on euerie side, and smooth, thicke,
and proued before hand.
                  The coales must be throughly kindled and halfe burned before you put any thing
into the Still, that so the fume, or yet any other noysome qualitie of the coales, may
not remaine to breath vpon it: or, at the least, put some few ashes or small quantitie
of sand betwixt the Still and the furnace, that so the coales may not infect the water
with the smoake. Likewise the fire is not to be made with wood halfe rotten, or that
stinketh, or with charcoale burned and made in a pit, or of coale drawne and digged
out of the earth, whether they be of stone, or earth, for feare the stilling vessels
and water should be infected and marred with the filthie and stinking vapour
thereof.
                  The fire must not be hastie or headlong at the beginning,A gentle fire at the first. as well for the safetie of
the vessels, which might thereby be broken, taking too sudden a heat, as also to the
end, that the matter distilled may become acquainted with the fire by little and
little, and that so farre, as vntill the fire be come to the third degree, if need doe so
require.
                  You must not put into your Stills or Limbecke too great a quantitie of matter,What quantitie of matter is best to be put in the still. for
so it might runne ouer, and be cast forth againe; and furthermore, that vnderneath
would be parched and dried away, and that aboue would remaine as it was put in:
but it is rather the safer course to shift them oft, and so by this meanes you shall haue
greater store and plentie of water.
                  The water of Maries bath may not be hoter than the finger may endure to slay in
it: howbeit, oftentimes there come things to be distilled in the double vessell, for the
distilling whereof, if it should come to passe that the heat of Maries bath should not
be vehement ynough, then mixe therewith some small sand, to encrease the heat of
the water.
                  If the glasse still happen to cracke being set vpon the fire, you shall let the spirits
from euaporating, if you dip diuers linnen cloathes in the whites of egges vvell
beaten, and applie them vpon the cracke of the glasse hot one after another: in such
sort that so soone as one shall be dried like a crust, another be readie by and by to put
vpon it, and so to continue.
                  If you distill your waters in the heat of sand (as many doe and that verie often) or of
ashes,To distill in the heat of sand. or the filings or scales of yron made in powder, the bodie of the still must
be armed (whether it be of glasse or brasse, or any other matter) with verie fine ashes

that haue beene sifted, or with sand, or with the filings of yron finely powdred, in such
sort as that the ashes may be higher about the glasse than the matter is within by a
hal
                        •
                     e foot good. The ashes shall be placed in the vpper part of the furnace, or in a
place of hold made vpon the furnace, and heated with a coale fire which shall be below
in the bottome of the glasse. The waters so distilled indure much longer than
those which are distilled in Maries bath: but in all other points they resemble and
are like one vnto another.
                  If you haue not the leasure to make your distillation in a still,To make a spe

would gladly distill some certaine juice or liquor: then cause your juice to boyle in
some vessell, and ouer this vessell set a glasse: in this glasse the vapour will turne into
water:Vinegar distilled in that sort. by this meanes vinegar is turned easily into a vvater vvhich is verie profitable
for the spots and stayne of the eye, especially if before the distilling of it you
cause some few slips of Rhue to be boyled in white vinegar.
                  Hot things,To distill one water many times. that they may proue effectuall, would be distilled three or foure times,
putting &amp; adding vnto euerie time new matter, or else to rectifie them by themselues:
but as for cold things, such as the rose is, once distilling is sufficient: for by this means
it holdeth still his cooling qualitie in better sort, seeing the force of the fire begetteth
heat and sharpenesse in things.
                  When you would distill one vvater three or foure times,The heat required to the distilling of one thing o

                        . you must at euerie distillation
diminish the heat of your fire halfe a degree, and afterward a whole degree,
and so consequently vntill in the end you come backe vnto the first degree spoken
of before, and called such a heat as is but vvarme, the reason is, because that the matter
becomming more and more subtile at euerie distillation, craueth not so great a
heat at the end as it did at the beginning when it is in his gros
                        •

But it is contrarily practised in the extracting of quintessences out of any thing:The extracting of quintessences

                  In all manner of distillations of vvaters,To seperate the flegme in distilled liquors. you must carefully see to the seperating
of the flegme,The time of the flegme his comming forth. that is to say, the gros
                        •
                     est, thickest, and most waterie part of the humour
distilled: and for the doing hereof you must carefully consider of the matter
which you distill: because the 
                        •
                     legme commeth forth sometime first, sometimes the
last in the distillation, as in the distilling of Aqua-vitae is stayeth the last, notwithstanding
that it be distilled diuers times: in the distilling of the most part of other
things it commeth forth first, as in vinegar, honie, and such things: and the thing is
discerned by tasting of the first and last distilled waters. And if it happen that the
flegme be not seuered in this sort, as indeed it is not in some such, as with which it is
mixt: then the next course is to set such vvaters in the Sunne certaine daies in vessells
couered with linnen clothes, or parchment prickt full of small holes, that so the excrementous
part by such meanes may be consumed and wasted: or if the Sunne faile,
as in Winter time, then you must set your vessell contayning your distilled waters
in other vessells full of vvater, and cause them to boyle to the consumption of the
third part.
                  The distillation is to be judged to be in good state and case,When the still is in good temper, and stilleth not too fast nor too slow. if betwixt the fall of
euerie drop, you can account to the number of twelue: and hence also is the judging
of the force and quantitie of the fire to be learned and fetcht.
                  If any man desire that waters should haue some smell,To giue a good smell or taste to distilled waters. taste, or other qualitie of
something, as of honie, cinnamome, camphire, muske, or other like sweet smelling
thing, (whether it be to giue such smell to the thing that hath none at all, or vnto
something that hath a bad and vnpleasant smell, as we will speake of by and by in the
water distilled of mans dung) it vvill be good to annoynt and besmeare the head
of the still vvith these things, or else to tie vp the same in some little knot of linnen
cloth, and hang them at the verie poynt of the spout or pipe, to the end that
the vvater distilling through this matter, may retayne that smell or other qualitie intended.
                  And vvhereas distilled vvaters by force of the fire are euermore seene to retaine
some impressions and printes of the heat, it will be good presently after they be distilled,

to let them stand some time vncouered in the vessells wherein you meane to
keepe them, hauing yet therewithall regard, that neither their small nor any part of
their force doe vvaste or spend: and therefore to take the fittest course, it will be
best to set your vessell close and fast stopt in some cold place in moist sand to diminish
and take away the great heat of the same. Notwithstanding you must marke and
know that cold waters, vvhich shall be distilled in Maries-bath, will haue no great
need to be so vncouered, but that they rather must be set in the Sunne in a glasse vessell
not altogether full: or else that they with their vessell be set ouer head and eares
in hot sand for the space of fortie daies, to the end that their flegme and thickest humour

                  Of the particular manner of distilling of Hearbes, Rindes,
Flowers, and Rootes.
                  
                     DIstilled vvaters are of diuers sorts and vertues: some are physicall or medicinable,
as the water of roses, sage, marierom, and such like. Others
are nourishing, as restoratiues, and many both medicinable and nourishing,
as nourishing restoratiues: vvhereinto are put medicinable
things. Others are purgatiue, as the water or liquor of rhubarbe if it were new and
greene. Others serue to grace the face and hands, and to make beautifull. Others for
to gratifie the nose by yeelding a sweet smell, as those which are drawne out of spices
and sweet smelling simples, vsed also to vvash the hands, face, and whole bodie, and
againe all these waters are either simple or compound: but we will first speake of the
simple medicinable ones.

                  Rose-waterRosewater. is distilled either of new roses or of drie roses, and they are either
white or carnation. The fashion and manner of distilling of it is diuers: for sometimes
it is distilled by defluction tending downeward, vvhich is called in Latine
Distillatio per descensum, according to the matter which we shall declare in the seuentie
first Chapter hereafter following. Sometimes it is distilled by insolation, as
we will likewise shew in the same place: sometimes, and that oftest, as also best, in
Maries-bath, and before the distilling of it, if the roses be drie, it is good to moisten
them vvith the vapour of some boyling water, or some Roses. The water which is
distilled of red Roses, is more cordiall and corroboratiue, as that which is made of
white roses is more cooling. Then to distill good rose-water, you must infuse roses
in distilled Rose-water, or else in the juice drawne from them, and that by the space
of two or three dayes, your vessell being well lured and stopt, and afterward put
them in a glasse-still, couered with his head, and they both well luted and fitted
one to another, and finally, set them thus conjoyned in your vessell of Maries-bath.

and you cannot but thinke that the juice of hearbes or fruits being distilled doth afford
a farre better water, than that which is distilled of hearbes, yea or of fruits either.
We will begin therefore with distilled vvine.
                  Aqua-vitae is thus distilled: (notwithstanding that all manner of Wine is fit to

this must be well closed with the mortar of wisdome (being the same which we haue
before described) to the end that no vapour may passe out there by: and thus cause it
to distill with the heat of hot, but not boyling water: or else at a reasonable heate in
ashes, or in small sand, increasing the fire continually by little and little, and yet taking
heed that the wine doe not boyle: and to the end that you may haue excellent
good Aqua-vitae, you may distill it ouer foure or fiue times: for by how much the

first distillation, it shall be ynough to draw the tenth part, that is to say, of ten pintes
of vvine one pint of Aqua-vitae, more or lesse: for the second halfe of that which you
shall haue put in, that is to say, halfe a pinte: for the third likewise, the halfe or a little

beginning you must either take a great quantitie of Wine, or else haue many vessels.
It is true, that if the distillation be well made, the fourth will yeeld the like
quantitie of water to that it receiued, and there will be no losse in it: and herewith
likewise it is to be wished, that euerie man would be contented without going ouer
it any more: because so many repetitions and redistillations is a matter of great labour
and cost. In the meanetime this must be remembred, namely, to lessen the fire
at euerie distillation halfe a degree, and afterward a whole degree, that so in fine you
may come to the first degree called bl

repeating and going ouer with it by distillation after distillation shall be to take
from it his flegme, that is to say, his grossest and most waterie humour, which resteth
in the bottome, and is accustomed to come forth last, after that it is well digested by

with a couer, and hauing a straight nose comming out of it, and rising vp on
high, and turned downeward againe with a direct angle, and so passing through a

bucket full of cold water. After that the Aqua-vitae is distilled, you must set it out

are infinite: It keepeth off the fits of the Apoplexie and Falling sicknesse, in such
sort, as that they which are subiect vnto that disease in the time of Winter, must euery
morning take a spoonefull of Aqua-vitae sugred, and eat a little bit of white bread: it
driueth away venime: keepeth Wines from spending themselues, from putrifying,

betwixt the distilling of Aqua vitae and Vineger: for seeing that Wine is of a vaporous
and fierie substance,The difference betwixt Aqua-vitae and Vineger in their maner of distilling. the chiefest and principallest parts in it doe runne at the
first distillation, that is to say, with the water that first commeth forth: insomuch, as
that that which remaineth and stayeth behind in the vessell, tasteth no better than
common water, hauing in it no force or vertue. On the contrarie, the first that distilleth
of Vineger tasteth nothing at all, saue onely that it sheweth it selfe somewhat
more in his earthie parts by the alteration of his qualitie (for Vineger is no other
thing but a corrupted Wine, made eager by putrifaction:) for indeed his true, na

and proper qualitie of eagernesse and sowrenesse, as also the force and strength
thereof, stayeth behind with that in the vessell, till after the first water be past. And
by this it appeareth, that that which remaineth in the Wine after the first distillation
of it, should be called flegme, as that should also which commeth out first in the distillation
of Vinegar, be called flegme of Vineger. Wherefore, to haue good distilled
Vineger, after you haue put it in like quantitie (as we haue said of Wine for to make
Aqua-vitae) into the Stillitorie, you must let the flegme (that is to say, the watrie humour)
distill, and set it aside in some vessell by it selfe: afterward, when the Vineger
shall be consumed vnto the third or fourth part, and that it shall rellish in tasting of
the distilling drops, that the eager parts of the Vineger begin to come, it will be good
to set that aside to serue for infusions: and then afterward to encrease the heat of your
fire a little, and so continue your distillation, vntill such time as the water begin to
looke red, and to haue the consistence of Honey or of Pitch, and then you may be
bold to set it aside for your speciall vse, not in medicine, but otherwise in all things
concerning mettals and corrosiues: for this water making the third alteration in distillation,What vessels Vineger would be distilled in.

would be distilled in the same vessell that Rose-water is distilled in, especially in
ashes or hot sand, rather than in Maries bath. In like manner, and after the same
sort, you shall distill Vineger of Roses, of Elders, of Cloues, and other things. Distilled
Vineger is good to dissolue hard and mettallous things,The vertues of distilled Vineger. as Pearles, Corall,
Egge-shells, Crystall, and Emeralds: notwithstanding, Gold and Siluer cannot be
dissolued by it. This is the cause, that when Alchymists would distill any mettall or
stones, to draw out their oyle, they vse first to dissolue their matter in Vineger or
Vrine distilled.
                  Salted water or sea water is made sweet by this meanes. Fill a pot of salt water,Salted water, or Sea water. let

put it in small quantitie into a stillitorie (for in a great quantitie it vvould swell ouer,
after that it should once feele the heat) distill it in Maries-bath with a gentle and

it selfe for to colour and make long the beard and haire. Afterward increasing the
heat a little,To colour the haire. there will come forth a water of a yellow, and as it were a golden colour,

which you may keepe in another vessell, seeing it is good to cleanse vvounds both
shallow and deepe ones: your distillation continuing, there will come another vvater
high coloured and more red than the former, and then if you doe vvell, you shall
change the heat of the vvater into the heat of the ashes or sand, that is to say, that you
should remoue your Still, and set in ashes or sand euen almost vp to the verie mouth,
and that there be not aboue three inches in bredth betwixt the fire and your Still,
continuing to increase your fire, and to make it bigger than it was before, and by this
meanes there will come forth a water more clam

the oyle of honie. After this manner you may distill turpentine,Turpentine distilled. and such other
thicke and clammie liquors. Indeed to distill such thicke liquors, vvere better to be

some time, and then cast out the vvater that shall swim aboue: after vvith a tenth or

are in a consumption: it is good likewise against rheumes and distillations falling
vpon the joynts, if the diseased places be fomented therewithall. Howbeit I do not
greatly approue the distilling of mans bloud for any such end, seeing it is an vnworthie
and heynous thing, and not beseeming Christians, and a thing likewise which
in the middest of so many other helpes may easily be spared. See more amongst our
secret medicines.

                  Of the manner of distilling of restoratiues.
                  
                     REstoratiuesRestoratiues. are prepared after diuers sorts, notwithstanding the most vsuall
and best is thus: Take the flesh of a Veale, Kid, or Weather, cut
and chopped as small as possibly may be: or else take musculous flesh,
which is called the vvhites of capons, pullets, fat and well fleshed hens,
after they haue beene well hunted and tired, cut likewise and chopped small: put vnto
this flesh, calues feet, peeces of gold, or rather the thin beaten leaues of gold: put
all in a glasse Still well luted with mortar made of flower, whites of egges, and a little
masticke: into this Still, you shall cast (for the giuing of some grace vnto the distillation,
and somewhat to mitigate the heat which it might get by the fire) halfe a
handfull of cleane barley, a handfull of drie or new red Roses, which haue beene infused
in the juice of pomegranates or rose-water, and a little cinnamome: place them
all in the Still, as it were after the manner of little beds, and strew thereupon the powder
of the electuarie of cold Diamargariton, or of precious stones, and a little coriander
prepared and finely powdred to discusse and waste all windie matter. If you
would make your restoratiues medicinable, you may adde thereunto things concerning
the disease that presseth, as rootes and hearbes respecting the head, in the diseases
of the head, as betonie, penniryall, staechados, organie, sage, and others such
like: for the diseases of the reines, the rootes and plants that are good to breake the
stone: for the Falling-sicknesse, the seed of pionie, and misletoe of the oake: for the
quartaine ague, polopody, scolopendrum, and the rootes of Tamariske: for the
French disease, the rootes of gentian, enula campana, and the wood guajacum, and so
of other things: yet it seemeth vnto me that it were better that the cordial powders

                        〈◊〉
                      not be mingled among the rest, for feare that their force, which is thin, subtile,
and verie fragrant, should euaporate through the heat of the fire, and that it
would be farre better to straine the distillation through a linnen cloth that is verie
cleane, and which should haue the cordiall powders in the bottome of it: there
may likewise be added a quantitie of Treacle, with some conserues, as occasion shall
be ministred: the matter thus disposed of, it shall be distilled in a stillitorie of glasse
well luted (as we haue said) and in Maries-bath; or else in ashes, grauel, or hot sand:
for by this meanes the distillation vvill taste least of the fire. It will be good before
the flesh be put into the still to be distilled, that they should haue boyled a boyle or
two in a new earthen pot, to take from it the grosse excrements hanging about the
same. Againe, it must be remembred, that if there be any gold put into the distillation,
that it will be better to put in such as is wrought into leaues than grosse peeces:
because that grosse peeces in respect of their solidenesse consume but a verie little, and
with much adoe. This is called a diuine restoratiue,The diuine restoratiue. and must be giuen vnto the sicke

hearbes, as shall be necessarie in respect of the disease: and when it hath boiled till it

afterward put thereinto also the flesh of partridge, hen, or other such flying fowle cut
and chopt small, and adde vnto these such other matter, as you shall know to be necessarie
for the present disease, as conserues of roses and buglosse, damaske raisins, the
powders of the electuaries of precious stones, aromaticum rosatum, and such like
things: and finally, distill them after the manner aboue specified.

they can get, such they strangle and plucke by feather and feather, not vsing the

barley whole, coriander-seed, pearles, powder of the electuarie diarrhodon, or some

and such things as are for the decking and painting of the bodie, because
her care must wholly be imployed in the keeping and encrease of
her household-stuffe; notwithstanding, I would not haue her ignorant
of the manner of distilling of waters for Fukes: not that shee should make vse of

                  The manner of distilling per ascensum and per descensum.
                  
                     ALl manner of distillation which is made by vertue and force of fire,To distill (as it is called) per ascensum.
                      and
such like heat, is of two sorts: the one is made by raising vp of vapours vp
on high, which the Alchymists call per ascensum: and there is another
which is after the manner of falling of sweat, or defluxion of humors descending
downeward, and this is commonly called per descensum. Waters are for the
most part distilled by the way called per ascensum; as Oyles are for the most part distilled
per descensum: I say for the most part, because that certaine Waters are sometimes
distilled per descensum, as also some Oyles per ascensum, such as are the Oyles
drawne of leaues, flowers, fruits, seeds, and other such like matter.

                      are chiefely sweet waters, such as are
made of flowers and leaues of a good smell, which being so distilled, doe not euaporate
or spend their best vapour so quickly by distillation, and thereupon they retaine
in better sort, and for a longer time, their naturall smell.
                  
                     
The way is this: Take new Roses, or other such flowers, and put them in a Linnen
cloth,Rose-water distilled per descensum.
                      spread and stretcht ouer a bason of Brasse, or earth, well glased: aboue this bason
set another vessell of Brasse, or of earth, in manner of a round Frying-panne, hauing
the bottome couered with hot coales; but therewithall you must looke, that you
let not the fire remaine anie long time vpon the vessell, for feare it should grow too
hot, and that the water should smell of burning. Thus way is better than anie other, to
make a great deale of water in a short time, and without great charges, of flower
                        •
                      and
all sweet smelling, cooling, and astringent matter.
                  After such sort is the Sea-Onion distilled:The Sea-Onion distilled per descensum.
                      Cut in slices the Sea-Onion, put it into
an earthen vessell which shall haue manie small holes in the bottome, let the bottome
of this vessell goe into the mouth of another vessell made of earth, and lute them
both together verie well, and let the earthen vessell be set in the earth vp vnto the
throat, and then lay it round about with coales of fire, thus giue fire vnto the vpper
vessell for the space of tenne or twelue houres: it will distill his water downeward,
which if you mixe with flower or bread, you shall make Pastils, which will be good
to kill Rats or Mice,To kill Rats and Mice. and that quickly, if you mixe therewith a small quantitie of
Litarge.
                  You may make your distillation of flowers per descensum otherwise,Another manner of distilling waters per descensum, and that without heat. without the
heat of anie fire: Take two vessels of Glasse one like vnto another, both of them being
made large in the bottome, and narrow at the top (after the manner of an Vrinall)
and see that the mouth of the one will fit and goe into the mouth of the other, and
then lute them well and close together, hauing put betwixt them a fine thinne Linnen
cloth: the vppermost must be full of Roses, or other flowers, somewhat bruised▪ the
other must be emptie: set them in the South Sunne where it is very hot, and so it will
distill a water that is very pleasant and sweet.
                  Thus is Rose-water (sweetened with Muske) distilled,Water of the yellow parts of Violets. whereof wee haue spoke

                  Of the manner of distilling by the Filtre.
                  
                     THe causes of distilling by the Filtre we haue before declared,To distill by the Filtre. as namely,
that they are either the separation of liquors in generall, or else the separation
of liquors, of such or such qualities, as the separating of muddie
and earthie from the finer and subtle parts; which is the proper and
ordinarie way to distill iuices which haue a thicke consistence presently vpon their
cooling after their first pressing out; as namely, the iuices of Citrons, Limons, and
Oranges: againe, the prudent and expert Apothe carie, when he maketh sy

                     ups of
the iuices of Citrons, or Limons, doth first distill and straine the iuices by a Fittre,
before the goe about to dispense the syrrups.
                  But the manner to distill by a Filtre, is to haue three dishes, bowles, or basons, or
other vessels, of such fashion as the matter or liquor that you would distill doth require,
and so placed and seated, as that they may either stand higher and higher, or
lower and lower, euerie one aboue or vnder another, and the highest to containe that
which is to be distilled, and the lower that which is distilled. In the vppermost shall
be one or moe pieces of Cloth, or of a Felt of sufficient length, and dipt into the i
                        •
                     ices,
and these must be broad at the one end, and sharpe at the other: the broad end
shall lye in the iuice, and the narrow-pointed end shall hang without, by the which

the thinner part of the liquor shall rise and ascend, running downe drop after drop
into the vessell below, in such sort, as that the muddiest and impurest part shall stay
behind in the other vessell: and sometimes you must wring out this piece of cloth;
when it beginneth to become blacke, or that the drops distill but slowly, because of
the thicke matter that is carried into it along with the thinne: and hauing washed
them, to put them afterward againe into the vessell. If a man be disposed to distill
one liquor manie times, he may place manie vessels after the manner of stayres▪ and
in euerie one of them, except the lowest, put a Filtre, in the same sort as we haue said:
for the last and lowest must serue onely to receiue from all the rest.
                  In stead of a piece of Felt, the Apothecaries vse oftentimes sleeues of Woollen
cloth, otherwise called sharpe-pointed Hose; through which, they purifie and
make cleare their Sirrups, Ap

may supply the place of that long, tedious, and painefull circular distillation; which
fitteth the Alchymists better, than either Countrey people, Physitians, or Apothecaries.

                  What manner of Furnaces must be made for the extracting
of Chymicall Oyles.
                  
                     THe Furnaces which serue to distill Chymicall Oyles, are of diuers
fashions, according vnto the diuersitie as well of the matter which
is to be distilled, as of the vessels which are to serue to distill them
withall: and yet the most common and commodious or profitable
fashion of all is this.
                  Build vp a Furnace of Bricke, or of Tyle, and fat Earth, or Mortar, or of Playster
alone, and make the same of a round shape (or at the least let it be so within)
to the end, that the fire being carried vp on high, may disperse it selfe all ouer in
a more equall measure: and withall, make it of a reasonable length and thickenesse,
and not more than three foot high; and bearing a foot round of compass
                        •
                     
and euerie way within at the least. There shall bee also three seuerall spaces or
roomes in the whole height: the first, of one foot; the second, of a foot and a
halfe; and in the third, all the rest of the Furnace. In the first roome there shall
be a grate of yron to lay the coales vpon for the making of the fire: in the second
roome, or loft, there shall be two roddes of yron, which shall be distant
the one from the other about foure fingers, whereupon shall rest an earthen vessell
of the fashion of an earthen pot or panne, and after such forme and manner as wee
will declare by and by. Vnderneath the first distance, and also aboue the grate
is the second distance, you must make two opening places, square, and hauing
their couers to shut them, after the manner of the mouth of an Ouen: by the
lower of those two mouthes you shall emptie and take out the ashes which are
made therein, and at the higher of them you shall put in coales, and kindle the
fire also. Furthermore, in the highest part of the Furnace, and likewise in such
place there as may be most commodious, there must be left certaine other holes
for the smoake to passe out by. See the picture and draught of such a Furnace
before in the distillation of Waters. Sometimes, for a need, the Furnace is omitted
and let passe, and a brandrith made to serue, setting vpon it the vessell for
to distill in, and that in a pot, bowle, or panne of earth or yron, and making a
fire vnderneath the same.

of Oyles: but leauing the examination of this varietie for such
as propound vnto themselues to entreat exactly of Chymicall matters,
as intending my selfe onely to giue some instructions vnto the
good Huswife, being Commaundresse of this our Countrey House; I will here set

                         distilling of Oyles. The one being fit and
verie conuenient to distill Hearbes, Flowers, Seedes, Fruits, Rootes, and Beasts, or
parts and excrements of Beasts: And the other, for Woods, Gummes, gummie
droppes, and other thicke and vnctuous Liquors. And now for to speake of
the first.
                  
                     
                     
Let there be made a vessell of verie choice earth, such as is verie cleane and verie
well kneaden, made vp with like paine and industrie as the Potters make vp theirs;
let it be of the thicknesse of a finger, or thereabout,
fashioned like an egge, and yet not like an egge when
it is whole, but when it is cut round away, almost to
the one halfe: it must be great, and conta
                        •
                     ning much,
after the greatnesse and widenesse of the Copper vessell:
and yet notwithstanding so great onely (especially
in respect of his height) as that it may agree with
the third and last loft of the furnace, and the widenesse
euen and iumpe with the mouth of the furnace
wherein it must stand: and in like manner the bottome must beare such breadth, as
that it may be a little flatter than the space which is betwixt the two rods of yron,
made fast and set ouerthwart at the end of the second distance of the fu
                        •
                     nace, to
the end that it may rest vpon them the more firmely. And therefore to doe well
herein, the furnace would be builded before that the vessell be made. When
there is need of a great fire to distill withall, then it is prouided, that the pot,
in this place, be not of earth, but of yron: as I my selfe haue seene at the Apothecaries.
                  This second vessell shall be of Copper, or of La
                        •
                     ten, and shaped also like vn

an egge, or a gourd, hauing a wide mouth, whereunto there must be fitted a long
or stretched-out necke, being at the least a foot in length, comming downe from
the head, by the which necke the vapours in the gourd shall rise vp into the said
head. This vessell shall hold twelue or fifteene pi

                     ts, or otherwise shall be made of
greatnesse answerable vnto the quantitie of the matter which you meane to distill,
which generally is (as wee will declare by and by) that for euerie pound of matter,
as of hearbes or seedes, &amp;c. there be put into this vessell nine or tenne pound of water.
Besides this, there must be such an agreement betwixt the greatnesse of this
Copper vessell and capacitie of the earthen vessell which standeth within the furnace,
as that they may be free one of another some two or three fingers, for the filling
in of sand, as we will hereafter declare: And as concerning the height thereof;
it, together with his head, must stand aboue that of earth a foot and a halfe
at the least.
                  The third vessell shall be the head,The head. which shall be round aboue, and not sharp
                        •
                     -pointed,
to the end that the vapour arising out of it may not fall downe againe:
and it must be set about (as it were) with a little Stand, or Tub, wherein must be
put coole water, for the easier thickening and fixing of the vapours: at the one side
of this little Tub there shall be a spout, or pipe, which shall come out of the head,
and by this the Oyle shall drop downe into the vessell receiuing; on the other side
of this little Stand must be a tappe with a spiggot, and it must come from the capacitie
of the same, that so it may emptie it of the water which it holdeth when
it is become too hot. This head shall be ioyned with the orifice and throat of
the last afore-named vessell, by the meanes of a large and wide pipe, which shall
come dow
                        •

Copper vessell verie closely, to the end that no vapours in rising may passe ou

two edges or brimmes, that so they may the better ioyne together. This sh

                  The two distilling vessels, that is to say, the Gourd and the Head,The Gourd and the Head. for as much as
they are of Copper or Latten, must be tinned within, to the end that the Oyle may
not get anie strange qualitie by these mettals, seeing especially that the Copper being

                     , and not tinned, may cause the Oyle to smell of the Brasse, or of some other

                        〈◊〉
                      qualitie. It is true, that besides the helpe comming by this tinning of the vessels,

with anie euill smell, or other accident that is not naturall, and therefore there needs
no feare to be taken for the vsing of Copper vessels in the distilling of Oyles for the
occasions aforesaid, although that earthen or glasse-vessels would be farre better and
more naturall (seeing in them there resteth no iot of mettall-like matter) than either
those that are of Copper, or molten, or of anie other mettall, saue onely there is some
danger of breaking or cracking of them, being the things whereunto earthen and
glasse-vessell are verie subiect when they are hot, yea, though they were armed with

                     tar, fat earth, cement, or anie other matter of defence; and then such breach or
cracke proueth a matter of no small dammage or consequence in the distillation of
Oyles, especially those which are precious. Notwithstanding, it is free for euery man

                     o vse vessels of earth or glasse, vpon paine that they be carefull to keepe them that
they neither cracke not breake: and the rather, seeing that in the extracting of some
Oyles there must needs be vsed glasse-vessels, or earthen ones, vernished and leaded,
and not Copper or Latten; as which will verie hardly let runne anie Oyles from
things that consist of an eager taste, whether it be that the Copper hath the like it
selfe, or of some secret vertue and facultie which is in it. And this thing wee see sufficiently
tried in the seedes of Grapes, whose Oyle conuerteth and turneth rather into
a greene rust in such vessels, than into anie airie or thinne exhalation, doe a man what
he can either about the fire, or anie other way whatsoeuer: but in the distillation of
fragrant and aromaticall things, as also those which are sweet in taste, or haue a diuers
qualitie from the Copper, it might seeme that a molten vessell might be more conuenient.

                  At what time Oyles would be distilled: and how the matter
and things whereof they are made must
be prepared.
                  
                     THe matter of euerie Oyle is to be distilled at such time, as when it is best
disposed: that is to say, seedes and aromaticall things, when they are
fresh and new gathered; for the fresher and newer that they a

                     e, so
much the more excellent Oyle will they yeeld, especially the thing
                        •
                     
that are of a sweet smell and aromaticall. And as for hearbes, they must be gathered
when they are come to their full force, that is to say, when they are in flower: for and
if they be deferred longer, the Oyle that commeth of them, for the most part, will be
more full of scumme and ranke, as also there will not so much be gathered of them.
Being gathered at such time, they must be dried in the shadow for the space of a
moneth or two, to the end, that some portion of their moistnesse and feeding humo
                        •
                     
may be diminished and taken away, and that the oylie and radicall humor may be
extracted more pure and sincere: and thirdly, that the hearbes themselues may be
the more easily crushed and bruised. But on the contrarie side, if the hearbes be 
                        〈◊〉
                     
and fresh gathered when they are distilled, they will yeeld sufficient store of Oyle, in
as much as their naturall moisture will abound: but the Oyle will not be of such

nor yet so odoriferous, as when the merrie and good meane betwixt both

waters, as we haue said before. For if one should bestow an infusion vpon them, either
in water, wine, or Aqua-vitae, it would but breed a confusion and mix

Horse-dung, earth, hot ashes, or boyling water, the better to distill and draw out your
Oyle afterward, and following the way that we will speake of by and by, yet thereby
you shall giue occasion of infecting your Oyle with some ill vice. For the matter
being putrified, it is not possible, but that the Oyles should haue a smatch of it, seeing
it is one part of the matter. That it so falleth out with Oyles that are so distilled of

                  Of the manner and order that must be kept in distilling
of Oyles.
                  
                     WHen you haue prepared the matter whereof you meane to make your
oyle, that is to say, bruised it, and brought it into small cornes, then passe
it grosly through a scarce, casting it into the vessell of copper with certaine
measures of fountaine water, that is to say, to match two pound
vveight of matter, with eighteene pound of vvater, and for that cause it is meet that
the vessell should containe betwixt twelue and fifteene pintes, and yet the third part
remaine void and emptie, vvhen the water and matter are both in. This vvater
standeth in steed of a coach or waggon vnto the matter to be distilled, for the carrying
vp of his vapors, and to seperate the humours by the decoction and boyling that
it there maketh. You may adde or diminish of the quantitie of vvater, according to
the matter his quantitie vvhich you are about to distill, vpon paine notwithstanding
that you put in nine or ten times as much water as you doe matter, and that your
vessell of copper, glasse, earth, or any such matter as shall seeme best, be of bignesse,
proportionable, and agreeing with the quantitie of matter which you would distill,
for being too great or too little, it would proue but cost cast away. It is true, that the
two pound of matter, and eighteene of water here mentioned, is the most certaine
rate that we can sticke to, for the most easie and plentifull maner of drawing of oyle:
for if you put in more, the longnesse of time will become teadious: and if you
                        •
                      put in
lesse, you shall hardly draw ten drops of oyle. And yet in this point Ladie experience
must be more than quarter ma
                        •
                     ster, in as much as there is some matter which
yeeldeth not any oyle, except it be put in a great quantitie, such as is Anise-seed and
others, as vve vvill declare hereafter more particularly. Againe, you must obserue
and marke this one poynt, that hearbes require a farre larger vessell and quantitie of
vvater than seeds and spices when their oyle is to be extracted: because that weight
for weight they take more roome than the seeds and spices doe: for hearbes lye not
so close and round together, and therefore they require also in proportion a greater
quantitie of vvater, for feare that they should become parched and dried away within
the copper vessell.
                  After that you haue put the vvater and matter together into the vessell of copper,
let them infuse fiue or sixe houres, more or lesse, according to the nature and substance
of the matter: or without infusing of them at this time (forasmuch as their boiling
within the bellie of the vessell, vvill serue in steed of an infusion vnto the matter)
couer the vessell, and fit the head vnto it, lute them verie well stogether with
whites of egges and meale kneaded together, and spread vpon a cloth in the place of
their joyning and articulation. This done, set your earthen vessell in the furnace vpon
the two yron barres, and make it fast to the furnace with potters-clay or cement
well beaten and wrought about the edges and brims: after set the vessell of copper
well stopt into the earthen one, and yet in such sort, as that the bottome of the one

with pure and cleare sand, euen so high as there is any space and distance betwixt vessell
and vessell, yea, and further if one be so disposed euen to the necke of the copper
vessell: prouided, that the nose of the head by which the oyle descendeth doe stand
either to the right hand or to the left of the furnace: and yet this one thing commeth
heere to be marked, that in distilling of aromaticall seeds onely there is vse and need
of the said sand betwixt the said two vessells, and not in distilling of hearbes: for
seeds and spices are of a more subtile and delicate substance (as their great heat do testifie)
and the matter they yeeld is more delicate also and firme: For which causes it
might fall out that the force of the fire might somewhat trouble their distillation,

that is to say, might cause their distillation to come forth a little troubled, and that
euen in the verie beginning, if the fire be not moderately kept, and brideled by the
sand put in the void place betwixt the said two vessels: but in the distilling of herbes

solidenesse and harder substance doe craue a greater force of fire:No oyle can be drawne in Maries-bath. vvhereof you may
gather, that no oyles can be extracted by distillation in Maries-bath, that is to say,
in setting of boyling vvater about the copper vessell in a caldron:

matter be not moist of it selfe: for thereupon and by that meanes can the oyle hardly
rise so high as that it may find the way into the vessell that should receiue it, and
because also that it wanteth force and might, in as much as the boyling water cannot
lift it vp so high of it selfe alone, as the cleare fire,

anise seeds, vvhich by reason of their thin substance, as also of their viscositie, do cast

if you please, you may fill the little tub at the top, which standeth round about the
head vvith cold vvater; for it cooling the head, will make thicke and fixe the vapours
and spirites of the oyle, vvhich are verie subtile and hot, and turne them into
oyle: vvhen this cold water thus powred in shall become hot, it must by and by be
let out at the top of the cooler, and fresh put into his place. It is true, that some doe
not allow of cooling the head with cold vvater, because the vapours by this cooling
of the head doe congeale too soone, as being before that they come into the pipe, and
thereupon fall backe againe into the vessell, from vvhence they breathing the second

is drawne, is somewhat tainted with burning. And therefore in steed of this cooling

this pipe is shut vp into the pipe comming downe from the head, and both these
being well luted together, then the foresaid pipe crossing through the vessell aforesaid,
is fastened to the vessell that is to receiue the distilled oyle: this foresaid vessell
hauing this pipe passing through the sides thereof, and close fastened therein, must

be filled vvith coole vvater, by the cooling whereof the vapours sent or carried from
the head in this pipe of tin are congealed, fixed, turned into oyle, and so drop downe
easily into the receiuing vessell with greater profit, and in greater quantitie, and better,
than and if they had beene turned into oyle in the head by the cooling thereof
with cold vvater. Who so is minded to vse this meanes of cooling the vapours, may
doe it, but notwithstanding that former of ours is no lesse beneficiall, commodious,
and profitable, neither doth it worke that discommoditie afore charged vpon it, as
experience teacheth; and put case that it did so, yet the inconuenience is taken away,

                  You must note in this place, that the oyle commeth forth now and then with the
water; and that the water which distilleth with the oyle, commeth not onely of the
simple, but also of the water which was put in for the vse of the distillation: which,
by the force of the boyling which it hath had with the said simple, during the time of
the distillation, is become mixt by the force of the fire vvith the brayed matter, and
so hath brought along with it the whole strength of the same, as may be judged by the
smell and taste thereof,A comparison betwixt th

which distilleth oyle therewith, is not lesse effectuall, yea rather more forcible,
powerfull, and of better effect, than that which is distilled of simples by a stillitorie,
because it tasteth more strongly of the simple, than the others which were drawn
by a stillitorie: betwixt which there is no other difference, but that the water distilled
by a limbecke or stillitorie is that which the Sunne (heating the earth) hath
brough

                      in for the growth, nourishment, and nature of the simple: and the other
which is mixed with the simple, from which the oyle is drawne, is so deepely ingaged,
incorporated and mingled in and with the brayed matter by the force of the
fire, as that it carrieth away, obtayneth and holdeth all his vertue, as the taste and
smell doe shew which is in it, for both the smell and taste doe draw verie neere vnto
that which the oyle hath in it selfe, howsoeuer it may seeme that the oyle should containe
and keepe all the sauour and smell vnto it selfe, seeing the oyle is as it were the
soule and forme which giueth being to the said simple: but in the vehement boyling
of the said simple and water, there is such a great dissolution and relaxation of the

                     s of the said simple, as that the smell and taste thereof is communicated

of Wine. For the doing of this, make cleane the copper vessell, powre in thereto

coldnesse be congealed as it were into cloudes and small tufts of vvooll, then it vvill
be mingled amongst the vvater. Againe, the oyle will goe to the bottome, if it be
made of a thicke substance and w

such like. The oyles which confusedly (for the time that they are congealing
through the cold) goe crosse the water, are the oyles of anise and fennell-seed, and
that by reason of a certaine proportion which they haue with the weight of the vvater.
Therefore for the seperating of the oyle vvhich the water hath carried along
vvith it, it were good, first that the receiuer should haue his bottome somewhat
sharpe pointed, and that in the said bottome therewithall there should be a small
hole, which hauing beene stopped during the time of the distillation with Waxe o

the operation of the ayre) be vnstopped, if so be that after attentiue beholding of the
receiuer, it appeare that the oyle is gathered into the bottome of it: for so, the ceme

or vvaxe taken away, the oyle vvill come out, and the vvater stay behind in the vessell,
if by stopping the hole in time it be your mind to keepe it there. If the oyle

run out below, and the oyle vvill stay behind in the receiuer, if by mishap it doe not
fall downe into the bottome of the receiuer first, before it come into the viole prepared
for it, but this you must take heed vnto: but and if the oyle be mingled amongst
the vvater in manner of a cloud, strayne the water through a fine linnen cloth, vvhich
afterward vvill be easily gathered together vvith a knife, in such sort at that you may
put it vp in a viole, wherein afterward if need be, you may turne it into a thin liquor
by a small heat set in the Sunne, or vpon hot ashes: if the oyle swim vpon the vpper
face of the vvater, you shall seperate it in a furnace of digestion vvith a siluer spoone:
you may also vse other meanes to seperate your oyle from
his fellow vvater, as for example, by a funnell of glasse,
putting your finger toward the poynt of it and vnderneath,

of I cannot tell of what adustion: but the best is to draw it per ascensum, that so you
may haue that which is excellent good, faire, and penetratiue; the manner is such:
Make your furnace of matter and forme as aboue, sauing that in the vppermost part
of it you must haue a cleft or open place, for the more easie placing and disposing of
the necke of your vessell. The vessell shall be fashioned like a Bladder, Corner, or
bagge of a Shepheards Pipe, called of the Chymists a re

or else of earth, and varnished and leaded within, and of such bignesse, as that it
may containe a dozen pound of water, hauing a necke of a foot and a halfe long, or
a foot long at the least, and bending downeward: It is to consist of two parts; the
one of them stretching from the bell

long, and for thicknesse so made, as that ones hand may goe into the orifice of it, to
make cleane the said vessell within: and the other growing euer lesse and lesse, euen

of some fastening matter, as glue or cement of Bole-armoniacke; and yet in such
sort, as that they may be set together, and taken asunder, when need shall require.
This is the figure and shape.
                  
                     A The Retort of glasse, or earth, vernished
within, and leaded.
                     B The orifice of the Retort, for the taking
in of matter into the bellie
and bodie, and for to giue way also
for the making cleane of the said
bellie, and which for that purpose
must be made larger than it is pictured
here, for else the hand cannot
enter into it.
                     C The other part of the Retort, into
which must be inserted the nether part of the Retort, which must haue a
ring about, in the place where the two parts shall be cemented and luted
together.
                     D The Pipe, which must be narrow and sharpe-pointed, to the end it may be inserted
and put into anie sort of glasse-violl, or bottle.
                  
                  If you haue not the benefit of a furnace, you shall place the Retort in fit and conuenient
sort within an earthen panne: or in stead thereof, in a vessell or pot of yron
good and wide, and filled with sand or ashes, or without anie thing in it, and that vpon
a brandrith, if there be need of vsing a verie great fire, as we see it daily practised
amongst the Apothecaries.

bring it into pieces, in such sort as Turners doe, with turning of wood, and not with
anie Saw, or anie other edge-toole: neither yet must you make it like powder, for in
boiling it would too lightly and easily rise and swell, as also those gobbe

which are cut by edge-tooles, or other instruments, doe hardly and with great difficultie
yeeld anie oyle: put into the Retort two pound of this wood, diuided into pieces
after the manner of the Turners, and as much Aqua-vitae, for the steeping and infusing
of it, let them infuse together certaine daies. This Aqua-vitae, by reason of his
subtlenesse, pierceth more easily than any other liquor, and likewise without any difficultie
separateth and forcibly draweth the oyle from his proper subiect, and yet in the
meane time in neither changeth nor corrupteth, any manner of way, the nature of the
said oyle, because it draweth neere vnto the temperature of oyles; which is the cause
why we mingle with the wood Aqua-vitae rather than common water: howsoeuer, I
do not any thing doubt of the maner before described about the distillation of oyles,
hearbs, &amp; seeds, in which is vsed the vessell of Copper with a head, powring thereinto

some cleare fountaine vvater, as though it could not be verie certaine and profitable
for the extracting of oyles of vvood: vvere it not that vve doe

thing else, the ouer great and vehement boyling thereof, proceeding of the disagreement
of the drinesse of the matter, and moisture of the vvater vvhich might hinder
the course of our distillation. Adde hereunto also that such kinds of oiles can hardly
rise to the inner top of the head, if we see this fashioned copper vessell.

vppermost part of the furnace vpon the barres of yron, set the retort within this earthen
pan with sand in the emptie spaces betwixt, as also couered ouer vvith sand,

and to turne downeward towards the receiuer, into the mouth vvhereof it must be
close joyned, and as carefully and firmely luted vvith cement as may be: afterward
by little and little put the kindled coles vpon the grate, and sometimes it will not be
amisse to lay them vpon the retort vvherein the matter to be distilled is inclosed: if
it like you not better to set an earthen pan ouer it in forme of an head, and that to reuerberate
and beat backe the heat againe vpon the said retort. These things accomplished,
you must see to the ordering and continuing of your fire, increasing it by
little and little as reason shall require, euermore carefully looking vnto the sequence
and successe of the vvorke, vntill such time as the Aqua-vitae before infused be all of
it distilled, for this is it vvhich commeth

                  Of the manner of drawing Oyles of Gums, and first of those that are liquid.
                  
                     FOr the distilling of Oyles of Gummes, you must vse the same furnace
and retort wherein you distilled your oylie vvoods: but to tell you the
truth, they are not distilled without much paine, by reason of their glutinous
clamminesse, giuen to hold fast their radicall humour and moisture.
And vvhich is more, there are as many wayes of drawing oyles of Gummes,
as there are differences of Gummes. For some are liquid, that is to say, in substance
like birdlime, vvhich vvill hardly be kept within his bounds, such is Turpentine, liquid
Storax, and such other like, vvhich participate more of an oylie qualitie than
of an earthie, and so are easily resolued with a small fire. The others are hard, as is
incense, benjouine, and masticke, vvhich require a reasonable heat to be mollified
vvith. Some againe are resolued with a vvaterie humour, as Myrrhe, and Gum arabicke.
                  Therefore to distill liquid gums,Two waies to extract oyles out of liquid Gums. and to draw out their oyles, there may two waies
be taken: the one is such as hath beene vsed of a long time, and the other is new; after
the first way, you may distill oyle of Turpentine thus: Take cleare Turpentine

vvhich you shall set within the earthen pan in the furnace, as you did in oylie woods:
in the beginning you shall haue but a gentle fire to draw out the vvater vvhich vvill
first come forth,Thus

                         waxe distilled. and after make it bigger for the distilling of the Oyle. It is likewise
distilled another and that a new vvay. Take two pound of Turpentine, and
eight pound of fountaine vvater that is verie cleare, put both into the retort together,
and distill them at a reasonable fire, following the order set downe for oylie vvoods.
The Oyle vvhich you shall gather, vvill be most pure and fine, of a verie cleare and
bright colour, of a sweet smell and pleasant tast, vvhich properties are not to be found
in the oyle which is drawne after the common and ordinarie fashion: and this commeth
to passe by reason of the vvater tempering the qualities conceiued and b
                        •
                     gotten
in the matter distilled by the force of the fire and heat of the vessell, vvhich otherwise
would haue begotten some fierie impressions, therein had not the resisting qualitie
of the vvater vvithstood the same by his moisture, and that so much the more,
for being likewise receiued into a receiuer halfe full of faire and fresh vvater, vvhich
affordeth another good helpe likewise vnto the same: of all which helpes, the common
manner of distilling this oyle vvith sand and ashes hath not one, as is too apparant
in the vnpleasant taste and blackish or sad yellowish colour, and that it is not fit
to be vsed about the bodie outwardly, so farre is it off from being worthie to be taken
inwardly, vvithout the endangering of the sicke partie; beside the vnpleasantnesse
of the tast: but this vvhich is distilled vvith vvater is singular good for all manner
of diseases, for which it is so highly commended of all men, as namely for the
shortnesse of breath, stone, colicke, and diseases of the lungs being taken inwardly in
the quantitie of two drams: as also, to take away scarres remaining, freckles, staines,
and other spots of the skin, being applied outwardly.
                  But and if you desire to know vvhen your Oyle is all distilled,When the distillation is ended▪
                      then you must
marke and see vvhen it ceaseth to runne out of the retort into the receiuer, for then
the distillation of the best and most excellent Oyle is finished. And in case you yet
desire to draw some more oyle out of the rest of the matter remaining within the retort,
you may doe it verie easilie, if you cast into the said retort some little lump
                        •
                      of
lead to the quantitie of an ounce, and that by the orifice of the first part of the retort,

which must be verie well fitted and luted againe with the other part as it was before;
for the lead being molten, doth resolue the gum remaining, in such sort, as that whatsoeuer

                  Of the manner of extracting Oyles out of hard gums.
                  
                     YOur hard gums, such as is frankincense, benjouin, masticke, and waxe,
seeing they are of a more earthie substance, haue a faster and 
                        〈◊〉
                      consistence,
and are resolued more hardly than the liquid ones, and so aske
not onely more labour to haue their oyles drawne from them, but stand
in need also to haue some sort of oyle, and a reasonable fire to

                     ollifie
and soften them, to the end that afterward they may the more freely yeeld their owne
Oyle. It is true, that euen of these there are some of them more tedious and s

resisting to be dissolued, as Frankincense, and Benjouin: and othersome more
easie to be molten, as Wax: and there are others that are indifferent betwixt both,
as masticke. So as that all these gums, according as they are more or lesse hard to be
resolued, must be more or lesse mollified and melted before hand, by the meanes aforenamed
in the distilling of liquid gums: the vvater only excepted, which must neuer
be put into the retort with any thing to be distilled. It is also to be considered
and vveighed, how that hard gums doe verie hardly indure and abide any vvater,
vvhiles (inclosed vvithin the retort) they sustaine the violence of the fire, but in steed
of fire, one may put thereto of oyle of Turpentine, to the quantitie of three ounces,
as well because this oyle is most pure and distilled with a reasonable heat (as we
haue said before) as because it hath a property drawing neere vnto the nature of these
gums, whereupon it seemeth the more fit to be vsed in the distilling of these gums,
as seruing notably to correct their hardnesse: againe, this vvay more oyle will be
drawne, than by vsing of vvashed sand and grauell cast vpon the matter: and according
as vve see commonly practised of Oyles of all sorts of gums. And in case you
haue not oyle of Turpentine in readinesse, you may vse some other sort of oyle; prouided,
as much as possibly may be, that it incline not notably either vnto any colour
of smell: notwithstanding by this meanes you shall not doe more good than by the
former. For there is some kind of gum so troublesome to be resolued, as frankincense,
as that you must be faine to draw the oyle thereof after the same manner that you vsed
in the extracting of oyles from the drosse and residence of Turpentine, that is to
say, by casting into the retort amongst it small morsells or lumps of lead, and vvith
raising of the necke of the retort a little higher than is vsuall in the distilling of Turpentine
and oylie vvoods. By this meanes vvithout all doubt you shall see some ounces
of oyle swimming on the top of the water within the receiuer, after that the matter
hath growne hot: vvhich (for as much as they would be tainted with some ill
smell and vnpleasant taste, because of such qualitie as they haue gotten through the
vehementnesse of the fire, then inclosed with the retort) must be corrected by the
changing of the water in the receiuer, that so you may keepe them for the vses which
shall hereafter be declared.
                  These things aforesaid well vnderstood, when you desire greater quantitie of oile,
and that more cleare and excellent; you shall take two pound of the said ma

                     ued oyles were made: you shall put them in a cleane retort,
vvhich you shall set ouer the fire, hauing the necke hanging downe somewhat
more low, and in a short time (and that vvithout any great force of fire) there vvill
be wrought a certaine kind of butter, vvhich will run out in great plenti
                        •
                     , being as it

were of a middle consistence betwixt the gum and the oyle before distilled. Againe,
you shall take this butter-like matter and put it into the retort, hauing first made it verie
cleane, and then set it vpon the furnace the second time, with certaine ounces of
purged oyle vvhich you shall haue drawne before from the same kind of gum. By
these meanes, and the helpe of a reasonable fire giuen vnto it, you shall draw as much
oyle (and that most exquisite) as Art and Nature could joyntly giue together. And
thus much for the sure and certaine way of extracting of oyles of hard gums, which
though it be costly, ought notwithstanding for the excellencie thereof be rather
practised than the other common way which is by grauell, ashes, or washed sand,
cast into the retort with the matter. By such meanes you shall make oyle of amber,
jet, brimstone, and other such kind of things, being first made into powder, and putting
thereunto common oyle, which hath beene first cleansed and purged in a leaden
vessel or warme water.
                  Oyle of Waxe is thus prepared after the common manner:Oyle of Waxe. Take a pound of new
Waxe, you shall wash it thus: melting it at the fire you shall cast it by and by into a
vessell full of vvhite Wine, worke it well with your hand after the manner of pas

sometimes drawing it out at length, sometimes breaking of it, and sometimes doubling
of it: melt it once againe, and cast it into the same Wine, then also worke it
with your hands as before, and thus you shall doe three or foure times, till you see the
wax to haue spent about the quantitie of a pint of vvine; this done, put it thus prepared
into a retort, and cast vpon it grauell, washed sand, or powder of brickes, notwithstanding
that it may be distilled without grauell, sand, or brickes, as is tried by
exper

                     ence: lute the retort all about, euen vnto the middest of the necke, and set in
an earthen pan full of small ashes vpon the fire, which must be but soft and gentle at
the beginning, but augmented and made greater afterward from degree to degree,
the oyle will distill and come forth verie cleare.
                  Others prepare it after this manner:Another manner of making oyle of Waxe. They set an earthen vessell full of white or
red wine vpon the fire, whereinto after that the Wine is become hote, they cast the
Wax diuided into many morsells: after they cause the vessell to boyle being close
couered, and when the wine is spent, they powre in other, vntill that euerie pound
of waxe haue wasted ten pound of Wine: and when they see that there is yet a little
wine with the Waxe, they take away the Wax from the fire, that so it may not burn,
and presently cast the Waxe into another vessell wherein there is a little white wine:
after that it is cold, and the moisture thereof taken away, they distill it in a retort. In
any case there must heed be taken that it boyle not in distilling, as in Turpentine and
honie, for such liquors being heated, doe easi

                     ie swell and rise vp. Wherefore there
must be made but a soft and gentle fire at the first, and then afterward increased, and
the stillitorie cooled: againe, to hinder the boyling vp of it, you may cast in some
small lumps of lead wrapt vp in paper, or the leaues of Iuie or small grauell, &amp;c.

                  Of Medowes: and their difference.
                  
                     IN our former Treatise wee haue runne through those things
which belong vnto the husbanding and ordering of Gardens
and Orchards, and now it requireth, that wee speake
of Medow Grounds, vvhereupon consisteth the greatest
meanes of feeding and bringing vp of Cattell, to the end
wee may perfect and accomplish our fore-appointed purpose.
The thing therefore, called in our French tongue Pr
                           •
                        ,
may seeme to be borrowed from the old word Prat, and both
of them to signifie and point out a thing that is readie and prest to doe the Master of
the Farme and Farmer seruice, without putting him to anie paines, in respect of the
labouring or husbanding of them: but this must be vnderstood of Medowes hauing
their prey and maintenance about them; namely, such as are those which are fed and
watered with the Marne on the one side, and the Riuer Aube on the other, which is
about some hundred and fiftie leagues of square Countrey: as also those about the
Riuer called Veselle, which of all others doth most abound in Medowes. It is in
like manner in the free and reclaimed grounds from Barle-du
                        •
                      to Vitrye in Partois,
and from Louemont to Vassie in Thierache, all along the little Blondelle, as also along
the great and small Morin, in our Country of Beauuoisis. Such medow grounds
doe not 
                        •
                     eare stormes and tempests, as Gardens and other arable grounds doe: but
with little cost and charges they yeeld their double reuenue and profit euerie yeare;
the one of Hay, the other of Pasture. Medowes are of two sorts: the one drie, the
other 
                        •
                     oist. The drie craueth not the helpe of anie water to be watered withall, except
the raine, because it is in a fat place, and where it hath full store of refreshing

                        •
                     uice: and in such places Hay doth grow of his owne accord, and that a great deale
better than where it is forced by casting of water vpon it. The moist medowes haue
also seldome anie need of watering, because, most commonly, they lye alongst the
bankes of some great or small Riuers, which feedeth and nourisheth them: as those
which lye here in France, by the Riuers of Marne, Aube, Blondile, and Morin: and
in England, by the Riuers of Thames, Trent, Seauerne, Auon, Teame, Ouze, Wye,
and such like: and these medowes are, for the most part, plaine and leuell grounds,

because the inundations of these Riuers washing them ouer at least once or twice
euerie Winter, the Moal
                        •
                     s, and other silthie vermine, which hurt the earth, are destroyed,
and these Medowes are euer more fruitfull and more aboundant in their encrease
than the higher Medowes are, but the grasse is nothing neere so sweet and so
pleasant, neither feedeth so soundly, nor so suddenly: Whence it commeth, that the
husbandman keepeth his high-land hay for his cattell which are to be sed, and his
low-ground hay for those which worke.
               
               
                  CHAP. II.
                  What grounds are good for Medowes: and how to
make new Medowes.
                  
                     THe ground that is fat and full of iuice, although it be nothing at all helped
either by small Riuer or Brooke, is good to bring forth hay, so that▪
such place be not exceeding farre from some small Brooke, standing
water, or little Riuer: or, at the least, that it be moist at the bottome,
and such, as wherein, if that one make a reasonable deepe ditch, he may find good
store of water: for moisture is one of the nurses of hay. Where such 
                        •
                     at and iuiceground
is not, there may Medow ground be made, of what manner of earth soeuer
it be, whether it be a strong, slight, or leane earth, so that you haue close by it but
this one commoditie of a little Brooke to water it, and that the field lye somewhat
sloping or descending, not verie low, nor verie flat, as wherein the raine water,
or other of anie small Riuer, taking sometimes ouer the same, doe not vse to dwell
and stand anie long time, but passeth and runneth away faire and softly, without
anie 
                        •
                     arrying. Wherefore I agree and must needs confesse, that some grounds are
not so sit and profitable as othersome for the receiuing of Hay-seed, as those which
through the neerenesse of some great Flouds, and Pooles, Lakes, and great large
Waters, are oftentimes ouerflowne and couered with aboundance of water, which
in Winter drowneth the grounds: Whereupon it commeth to passe, that the hay is
nothing fine or delightsome vnto beasts, but great, and full of stumpie stalk: a broad
grasse also, and nothing pleasing their taste. But howsoeuer it is, the hay of standing
waters, ill husbanded and corrupted, as also the hay which naturally grow
                        •
                     th
thereabout, and by the large borders of Lakes, is not such as the fine mouthed beast
can delight in, as neither that which is gathered in grounds bordering vpon the
Sea, as with the salt and nitrous rellish whereof the appetites of Cattell are ouerthrowne,
not being accustomed thereunto: besides that, the verie grasse it selfe is
more ranke and vnsauourie than the common sort of grasse is, and in taste verie
vnlike it.
                  Yet this holdeth not generally: for these low Medowes,Salt Marshes. and those which border
on the Sea, are oftentimes the best of all other, and feed with greater expedition than
any other hay whatsoeuer: as witnesseth manie of those salt marishes, which are the
most chiefe nurceries and bringers forth of fat cattell that are knowne, and especially
Sheepe, which neuer are knowne to rot vpon the same. And of all cattell which 
                        •
                     eed
vpon hay, none is so daintie and choice in its taste, as the Sheepe is: for hee must
haue it both sweet, short, and soft: So that by that beast onely it may be seene, that
those low Medowes are not euer vnprofitable. And indeed to conclude, there is not
any ground which will beare grasse, but by industrie, manure, and much rest, may
be brought to beare reasonable good hay, if not to feede, yet to keepe cattell in
good p
                        ••
                     ght, and make them goe through with their labours soundly: which is as
great a profit to the husbandman as the office of grazing, and more properly belonging
to his profession.
                  
                     
Wherefore if you would make new Medowes,To make new medow grounds. make choice of the best ground
you can: this ground you shall lay fallow, and let lye idle a whole Summer: then in
Autumne after you shall turne vp and plow the same ground, often sowing therein,
for the first yeare, Turneps or Nauets, Millet, Beanes, or Oats, and the yeare following
with Wheat: then the third yeare you shall labour it diligently, and sow it with Fetches
mixt with Hay-seeds: and after this, you shall mow and order it as other old Medowes,
as we will declare by and by.
                  Yet for the sowing of these manie Graines so manie yeares one after another, it is
not altogether so necessarie: for though it may be vsed in some barren Countries, because
Turneps, Nauers, and Fetches are enrichers, and (as it were) manurings of the
ground, and the Oates a great breeder of grasse; yet if you onely,Oates a great breeder of grasse. when you intend
to lay a ground of grasse, doe but the last yeare cast downe the furrowes, and lay the
lands as flat as you can, and then onely sow cleane Oates vpon the same, it will be as
fully sufficient as all the former labour, and altogether as fruitfull, if the husbandman
slacke not his labour herein, but giue it such needfull seconds as the soyle
shall require.

                     ie places (as Medowes would be) but being contented
with Shepheards, graze along by the wayes, and vpon the plowed grounds.
And as for your heards of young Horses and Asses, they feed naturally and commodiously
with your other cattell. Yea furthermore, I haue seene in Campaine, as it
should be about Pont vpon Seine, a Medow countrey, the Geese and Turkies daily
and ordinarily driuen to the pasture, for the sauing of charges at home: which thing
would not agree well about the places of Monfort l'Amaurye, where is kept some
part of the Kings breed of Horses and Mares; for the downe, and other feathers of
those fowles, as also their dung, would make these sorts of beasts sicke, euen Horse,
Mare, Mule, or Asse.
                  Besides, according to the opinion of all good husbandmen,Geese a greas enemie to good grounds. these fowles are of all
creatures the most preiudiciall that may be, not onely to Medow grounds, but also to

                     ure grounds whatsoeuer: for besides the annoyance which their
feathers and downe make, their dung is so poysonous vnto the earth, that it makes it
barren, and forceth it to bring forth nothing but Goose-grasse, which is such a
sowre and vnwholesome weed, that no beast will touch it, and which, in short
space, will ouer-runne a great deale of ground, and make it vtterly vselesse: therefore
euerie husband must be carefull to keepe these fowles both from his Medowes
and his feeding Pastures.
                  But whatsoeuer others say or doe,
                        
                           〈…〉
                        
                      sure I am, that a good Farmer must not neglect
his Medow ground, seeing the husbanding of them is a matter more of care than
of paine and labour: For the first care must be to keepe it that it grow not with

                        〈◊〉
                      and thornes, or great high stalkes of other hearbes, all which would be pulled
vp by the roots in Autumne, or before Winter, as bushes, brambles, and rushes:
some other of them in the Spring, as Succories, Hemlocke, and such other weeds,

which are vnprofitable for the feeding of the heards of Horses and Mares. Likewise
there must not be left in them anie stones,To gather out the stones. nor yet anie other thing, that may hinder
the digging of them, when the earth is to be stirred. The ground being freed of
stones, shall be made euen and smooth verie handsomely in the Winter time, and after

vpon it,The manuring of it. is fine crumbling earth mixt with dung, which will doe it more good than
the best and purest dung that you can find in your Neat-house. For the making hereof,
you must gather in Summer the dust that is by the high wayes most haunted, and
mingle the same with the dung of cattell, the

Hennes and Pigeons, Oxe-dung, Horse-dung, and all other such excrements, which
must be let incorporate and mingle together the whole Winter, vntill such time as
this matter, watered with water, and throughly pierced with the frost, be sufficiently
ripened. This mixture when it is spread, entreth better below into the earth

is no dung more excellent for Medow grounds, than the rotten staddell or bottomes
of Hay-mowes,Bottomes of Hay-mowes. or Hay-stackes, which, putrified with the moisture of the earth,
lookes mouldie blacke, and most filthie; and with this, if you mixe the sweepings of
the Hay-barne floore, and the scattered seedes which fall from the Hay when it is
shaked vp or bound into bottles, it will be a great deale the better, and the earth will
put forth his encrease in much more plentie. These Medow grounds must also be

made either by plough, spade, or other instrument, which may conuey it from one
sluce to another, till it fall into some ditch or riuer: for as the sudden washing of the
earth fatteneth and enricheth the same, by reason of the mud, slime, and other fat substances
which it leaueth behind it; so the long abiding of the water vpon it,

the continuance of flouds, and onely esteeme of a gentle washing, and no more. Againe,
in your Medow grounds you must be exceeding carefull to know the goodnesse
or badnesse of the same: as, which is fruitfull, which barren, which quicke of
growth, which slow, which will beare but one entire crop, and which two, and accordingly
you must lay them, that is giue them time of rest for growth; as thus: If your
ground be verie fruitfull and rich, yet through the coldnesse of the clyme will not
beare aboue one crop, it shall not be needfull for you to lay it before May day: but if
it be but of a reasonable fruitfulnesse, then you may lay it at the Annuntiation of our
Ladie: but if it be verie hard and barren, then it is best to lay it at Candle

                     ss, that it
may haue the vttermost of the Spring &amp; Summer to grow in: also, if it be exceeding
fertile, and so warme and close couched, that it will beare two croppes, then you shall
lay it at Candlemas, that you may cut it at the end of May and the midst of September;
for to cut it after that time, is both ill husbandrie, and profitlesse: for howsoeuer
men may be opinioned, either through custome, or the imitation of their neighbors,
yet they shall find it most certaine, that the hay, how good soeuer the growth be, yet
if it want the Sunne and kindly withering, it can neuer be good either to feed or sustaine
nature with: but hauing the iuice rotting and not dried within it, becommeth
black, vnpleasant, and unwholesome, insomuch, that the worst straw is better than the
best of such hay: therefore let euerie husbandman haue a great care to the good and
kindly withering of his hay, and esteeme euer the qualitie before the quantitie. After
Medowes are laid, then the husbandman shall haue a great care to his 
                        •
                     ences, least either
his owne, or other mens cattell, by day or night breake into the same, for they may

doe him more iniurie in an houre than they can doe him profit in a moneth: for the
young and tender grasse, if it be nipt or bitten at the first springing, hardly after prospereth,
till the sythe haue cut it: for it is with grasse as with stronger plants, which if
they be nipt or bitten, forthwith loose the beautie of their flourishing, and groweth
not straight or vpright, but low, crooked, and ill-fauoredly, neither to fast as before
it did, but verie slowly, and manie times without seed: therefore by all meanes preuent
the cropping of your Medowes, by cattell at their first springing. Also, if you
haue anie riuers, ditches, or small rundles, which butt vpon your Medowes, you shall
at such time as you lay your Medowes, be sure to cleanse and scoure them both of
weeds, madde, and other filth, that shall anie way cloy or fill them, that the water may
thereby haue a more free passage and a larger receit to receiue and conuey away anie
floud which shall happen: for after your Medowes begin to grow, if anie floud shall
come vpon them, the sand and other filth will fasten to the rootes, and lye vpon the
grasse in such manner, that not being able to be cleansed by anie husbandrie, it will
make the hay vtterly vnwholesome, so that lying in the stomacks of the beasts, it will
engender manie mortall and pestilent diseases. And herein is also to be noted, that the
mudde and other compasse which you shall take out of these riuers or ditches, would
be spread vpon the Medowes, and when it is drie, with small clotting maules be beaten
as small as dust; for this is also an excellent maner of manuring your Medowes.

Spring with good Hay-seed, which is the Medow Clauer, which is called
in some places Sops in wine, by reason of the flower,Sops in wine, or Snaile-clauer. which is an
hearb which men in times past made great account of, sowing it by it selfe as the Fetch

two-fold Satyrion is good in some place where it groweth naturally: so likewise is the
Hyacinth, the one of them being of a blew flower, the other of a purple, herein differing
from the Satyrion, which is more cut &amp; diuided into small buds, as likewise more
fragrant. It is not good that there should be any great store of Plantaine,Plantaine. except it be

differeth from Esula, in as much as it hath no milke, and groweth high as Line doth
(saue that it hath a yellow flower) is good: but Esula or Spurge is naught, as is also
Hypericum, for these two are both of them verie hot and shrewd fellowes. Melilot
the small and the great, Myrrhis, which hath leaues like Fennell, and diuers diuided
white flowers, is of great vertue, and sweet, after the smell of Myrrhe. To be short,
the Carret and Cheruile doe serue greatly for the nourishing and goodnesse of the
hay. But aboue all, there is no hearbe nor seed more excellent to be nourished or
sowne in the Medowes, than Saxifrage is:Saxifrage a great friend to Medowes. for amongst all huswiues it is held an infallible
rule, That where Saxifrage growes, there you shall neuer haue ill Cheese or
Butter, especially Cheese. Whence it commeth, that the Netherlands abound much
in that commoditie, and only (as is supposed) through the plentie of that hearb only.
And for the better affirmation or proofe thereof, you shall vnderstand, that all good
huswiues, which will carrie any reputation for good Cheese-making, doe euer dresse
their cheslep-bags and earning with Saxifrage, as the only hearbe that giueth a most
perfit season to the same.
                  Now albeit I haue here deliuered you a particular collection of the seeds of all those
hearbs which are most necessarie to be sowne in Medows, yet I would not aduise you
to be so curious as to bestow your labour in culling these seeds from the rest, or to sow
them in your Medows with that care and respect that you sow seeds in your Garden;
for lesse paines will serue: only I would with you, when you intend to sow your Medowes
(which would be either in the Spring, or in Autumne) to goe (if you be vnprouided)
to such a neighbor or Farmer neere vnto you, as is owner of some fine and delicate
piece of Medow, void of grosse &amp; filthie weeds, stump-grasse, knot-grasse, peny-grasse,Sweepings of Hay-barne floores.

of his Hay-barne floore, as also those sweepings which shall be vnder those windows
or holes, in at which the husbandman putteth hay when he vnloads it, and these sweepings
you shal sow vpon your Medows as thick as you can strew them, for the thicker
is euer the better: and you must foresee, that when you thus sow your Medowes, you
cause your ground to be as bare eaten before as is possible, especially with Sheepe,

because as they bite the neerest of all cattell to the ground, so they bestow vpon it
their manure, or dung, which is the fattest and most fruitfullest of all other, and maketh
the seeds instantly to sprout after the first shower. You shall also obserue when
you sow your Medowes (whether it be at the Spring, or at the fall) to see and if the
dung of the cattell which last grazed vpon the same, lye upon it still in heapes, as
when it fell from their bodies: and this dung you shall raise from the ground, and
with beetles made for the purpose, beat them into verie small pieces, and so spread
them generally ouer the whole Medow, and then sow your seeds amongst them, for
by this meanes your seeds will quickly take root.
                  There is also another way of enriching of Medowes, especially such as lye high,
and out of the dangers of flouds, which for the most part are euer the barrennest;
and that is by the foddering or feeding of cattellFoddering of great cattell. vpon the same in the Winter season,
as thus: The husbandman shall in the barrennest part of his Medow ground, which
is safest from waters or flouds, make vp his hay in a large and handsome Stacke, or
Reeke, either round or square, according to his pleasure, or the quantitie of the hay:
and this Stacke thus made, he shall fence about with thorne, or other hedge-ware, to
keepe cattell from tearing or spoyling the same, till such time as the Farmer himselfe
shall thinke it meet to cut downe the same: Then when the extremitie of Winter
shall come, as either when the grasse is cleane consumed, or that by reason of long
Frosts or Snowes your cattell cannot come by anie food, then is the time to cut
downe your Hay-reekes, and to fodder your cattell therewith morning and euening,
cutting no more downe at a time than shall conueniently serue to fodder your cattell;
for spoyle herein is the vildest husbandrie that can be. This hay thus cut downe,
you shall not lay in one place, but in diuers places of your ground, in little tufts or
hillockes, scattering an armefull thereof in manie places: because, if you should lay
it in one place, or in a verie small circuit neere together, your cattell would disagree
and offer to gore one another, at least, the stronger cattell would euer beat away the
weaker, and so rob them of their food: whereas being scattered into diuers remote
places, those which are beaten away from one place, will goe to another, and so take
their food without trouble: in which, you shall euer obserue to lay more tufts or
heapes of hay than you haue cattell. Neither yet doe I meane, that this manner of
foddering shall ouer-spread anie great piece of ground at one time, but according
to the number of your cattell, be close packed together, both for the ease of the fodderer,
and for the well husbanding of the hay, which to be carried vp and downe too

                        〈◊〉
                     , would make much wast by scattering; so that to lay one foddering within two
or three yards of another, is sufficient. And this I speake of great cattell, as Oxen,
Kyne, Steeres, Horses, or such like: for if you fodder Sheepe,Foddering of Sheepe. then you must lay your
hay in long rowes, one row three or foure yards from another, vpon the driest and
cleanest ground you can find, because the trampling and treading of the cattell will

                        〈◊〉
                      much spoyle of the hay. And herein is also to be noted, that you must not
by any meanes lay your fodder aboue twice in one place, but change and alter your
ground, finding out still a drie and vntrodden place to fodder in, as well for keeping
the ground from two much foyling and tearing vp with the feet of cattell, as also for

                     ing of the hay, which would be halfe lost, if it should be layd in wet and myrie
places. And thus you may in one Winter runne ouer a great piece of ground,
and not onely sow it plenteously with the Hay-seedes which will fall from the Hay
in the carrying, but also manure the ground excellently, by this drawing together
of your beasts into one place, making their l

Now some will say, that this manner of enriching of grounds carrieth with it a
discommoditie which equalleth the goodnesse which is reaped from it, and therefore
not so much to be esteemed; alledging, that the trampling of the cattell teareth
vp the greene-swarth, and (as it were) ploweth vp the ground in such sort, that it
will hardly beare any good croppe of grasse a yeare or two after. To which I
answere,Commoditie of foddering. that if it doe (as happily it will) teare vp or digge the ground so, that you
loose the next yeares croppe in some part: yet, after the first yeare is past, the

second will double, and the third will treble anie encrease formerly receiued from
the same ground; neither will the goodnesse euer after be abated from the same:
besides, if your ground be subiect to anie filthie soft mosse, or fuzzie grasse, which is
both vnsauourie and vnwholesome for beasts, and also choaketh and deuoureth vp
all better herbage; this treading of the cattels feet will vtterly kill it, and make the
ground fruitfull for euer after. Nay, if the ground haue beene much subiect to small
whynnes, or prick-grasse, which is a most venimous weed in anie ground, according
to the opinion of the best husbands, this course onely will destroy it. To conclude,

                     BEsides the seedes of good hearbes, which is verie requisite for the Medowes,
yet there are other workes needfull for the goodnesse of Hay:
for the Medowes must be harrowed and raked presently after they be
sowne, to breake the clods into small earth, or dust, that so the mowers
may not thereby hurt their Sythes. If the ground of the Medow be withered,
and drie, it will be a maruellous commoditie vnto it, to draw into it, all the winter
long, at the least, some small Brooke, for the watering and moistening of it, seeing
that moisture is the naturall nourishment of Hay; and this would be done especially
during the moneths of Nouember, December, Ianuarie, and Februarie: afterward,
when the earth hath drunke her fill, then stop the way whereby the water of
the Brooke runneth. It is true, that if the Medow-plot lye vpon the side of some
hill, or vpon some high ground, there shall be no need to water it: for the first raine
that falleth, will descend and water such Medowes verie sufficiently, being ioyned
with the iuice and goodnesse of the dung which you shall haue bestowed in the
higher places. Neither shall it be needfull to water the ground much, where there
is great quantitie of three-leaued grasse, because then it would die by and by. Againe,
you must not cause anie water to ouerflow anie old Medow grounds, in the
time of great and excessiue cold, except it should be that they should continue a
long time: because that the water fayling, the ground thus boyled againe, and
drenched, would be verie much annoyed by the vehemence of the frost and yce.
Likewise, if there be anie marish or dead water in anie part of your Medow, you
must cause the same to runne and drayne out by some Conduits or Trenches: for
without all peraduenture, the super-aboundance of water doth as much harme, as
the want, scarcitie, or lacke of the same. You must be sure also to keepe Swine out
of your Medowes, because they are alwaies turning it ouer with their snouts, and

                        •
                     aying great soddes of earth: Neither must you admit anie great Cattell into them,
saue when they be verie drie, because the hornie hoofe doth sinke into the earth, and
either breake off the grasse, or cut in sunder the rootes, whereupon they cannot
spring or multiplie anie more.

                     NOw for the mowing of your Meadowes,Mowing of meadowes. it must be according to their
growth or ripenesse, for some ripen soone, and some late, and sure there
cannot fall to the Husbandman greater losse than to cut his Meadow
before it be ripe, for then the sap or moisture not being come fully out
of the roote, the grasse in the vvithering shrinketh away, and falls to nothing but a
soft fuzzie and vnwholesome substance which no cattell will eat; and also to let it
stand till it be ripe, or that it haue shed it seed, is as ill husbandrie, for then vvill the
juice be too much dried out of the stalke, and that substance which should giue nourishment
to your cattell, will be lost. Therefore to know when your grasse is truely
fit to be cut, you shall looke carefully vpon it, and vvhen you see the tops thereof
looke browne, and the cocke heads, bells, or bottells which beare the seeds, not stand
vpright, or looke direct into the heauens, but bend their heads downeward as looking
backe into the earth, then you may be certainely assured it is a fit and good
time to cut it, for the earth hath giuen it all the due it ought to haue, and this will be
(if it be in a most fertile and verie rich soyle, such as may be cut twice in the yeare)
at the beginning of Iune, or about a vveeke before Midsommer: But if it be in a
reasonable ground, which hath the title of a good earth onely, then it will be about
the translation of S. Thomas, which is the third of Iulie:Best time to cut grasse. but if the ground be extreame
cold, moist, and barren, then it vvill be after Lammasse, and sometimes in the
middest of September. Now for the generall cutting or mowing of Haye, it would
euer be done in the new of the Moone, and at such time as the vveather by all conjecstures
is cleare, constant, and likely to continue faire. As soone as your Haye is
mowne, if there be plentie of grasse, and that you see it lye thicke in the swathes, so
as the Ayre or Sunne cannot passe freely through it, then you shall cause certaine
with forkes to follow the

                     ythes, and as they mow it, so to cast it abroad thin, whereby
the Sunne may vvither it, and this is called tedding of hay: The next day after
the dew is taken from the ground, you shall turne it, and let it vvither on the other
side; then handling it, and finding it to your feeling fully drie, the next day you shall

                        •
                     orkes and rakes draw it together in great quantitie into long rows, which rows
you must draw in that way which the wind blowes most, least drawing it in the contrarie
way, the vvind scatter it abroad, and loose both your labour and profit, for
these rowes are called Wind-rowes; and as soone as it is thus gathered together, you
shall forthwith thrust the haye close vp together, and make those Wind-rowesWind-rowes. into
good bigge handsome cockes sharpe at the top, and broad at the bottome, such as six
or seuen of them may make a Waine-load; for howsoeuer sloth or weakenesse may
say that little cockes, because they aske little labour, are best, yet it is certaine that
the great cockes are much better,Great hay-cockes. and keepe the haye safer from vvet, if any shal fall,
and also makes it sweat, and haye a great deale more kindly: in these cockes you shal
let your haye stand a day at least, if more it is not amisse, and then breake them open
againe, and let them ley in the Sunne till it haue dried vp all the sweat and moisture
that was in them; vvhich done, you shall load it according to the maner of the soyle
wherein you liue, and so carrie it to the barne, or elswhere according to your pleasure.
Now this manner of making of haye you must vnderstand is for such as is most
fine, cleane, and the purest grasse, without vveeds, stumpes, thicke leaues, or other
grosse substances, for if you find your grasse to be of that rough nature (as for the most
part all your vvood-land-grasse is) or that it is much intermixt with burnet, peny-grasse,

and other thicke leafed weeds, then you shall giue it double withering, and after
you haue mowed it, and tedded it, you shall turne it twice or thrice ere you cocke
it, then being put into drie cocke, you shall breake it open in the morning, and make
it vp into drie cocke againe at night, three or foure daies together before you load it,
and be sure that in the cocke it take a verie good sweat, and then carrie it home and
stacke it vp as shall please you best. But if your ground be extreame barren, cold,
moist, and full of verie sowre and stubborne grasse, and of that also but little plentie
being thin, short, and hard in the cutting, then you shall not need to ted that hay at
all, but in steed of that labour, you shall (as it is mowne) with your forke make it into
thicke little grasse-cockes, as bigge as prettie little moale-hills: the reason whereof
is this, That such sowre and harsh grasseSowre and harsh-grasse. being exceeding slow of growth, must necessarilie
be verie late in the yeare before it can be ripe, or readie to be cut, whereby
wanting the kindlie heat and strength of the Sunne, 
                        •
                     t cannot but with great difficultie
vvither vvell: vvherefore you must adde vnto it all the art which you may to
bring it to good haye, which this casting it into little heapes and cockes will doe,
for the grasse so layed together will heat of it selfe, and then being often turned and
tost that the ayre may goe through it and drie it, and then made into cockes againe
euerie day bigger and bigger, vvill in the end by it owne heat come to as kindly hay
as if it had the full benefit of the Sunne. And herein you shall obserue, that as at first
you make them into small cockes, so the second day you shall make them into bigger
by putting two or three of those cockes into one, and the next day you shall put two
or three of those bigger cockes into one, euerie day increasing the bignesse of the
cockes as you find them to vvither, till you bring them to so great cockes that three
or foure of them will make a Waine-load, and in that estate you shall let them stand
foure or fiue daies before you load them: but vvhilest they are in the little cockes,
you shall breake them open once or twice a day at least, according to the fairenesse of
the vveather; for you must vnderstand, that whilest they are in grasse or vnwithered
cockes, if you let them lie too long, the grasse will turne yellow, and begin to putrifie,
vvhich often stirring vvill preuent. Lastly, touching the making of hay, you
must vnderstand that the greatest enemie it hath, is wet, or raine, and therefore you
must be carefull to make it vp in the driest and fairest weather you can; and if any
raine shall happen to fall on it, not to turne it till the vpper side be drie; for to turne
the wet grasse to the wet earth, is the readie way to make it rot.
                  Now to speake a little touching the choyce and vse of your haye,Choyce and vse of haye. you shall vnderstand,
that the haye which is most long, loggie, and of greatest burthen, is best for
horses, being verie drie, sweet, and got in a good season: that vvhich is not verie long
of growth, but verie pleasant and cleane grasse, without weeds, hard stumpes, pricks,
or such like, is best for milch-kine, or stall-fed-oxen; onely that which you preserue
for your Kine, would be got verie drie, and haue all the sweetnesse and pleasantnesse
that may be: but that you keepe for your feeding-cattell would not be altogether
throughly vvithered, but got a little greenish, so as it may take such a heat in the
mowe, as may onely discolour it and turne it red, but no more; for that will bring a
thirst vnto the cattell, and make them drinke vvell: and the Grasier is of this opinion,
that cattell neuer feed well till they drinke well, and that haye which is the finest
and shortest, growing vpon high and drie grounds full of flowers and sweet 
                        〈◊〉
                     
is best for your sheepe, or young calues, and this must be got verie drie, and (as neere
as you can) vtterly without any raine; for when it is so drie that it will hardly
lye vpon the Waine, then is it the best of all: for when the husbandman saith that
moist haye is profitable for the increase of milke, he doth not meane that you shall

shot on, it can haue no other kindly withering, neither is it to be vsed for the feeding
of fat cattell, or for milch Kine, but onely for drie beasts, or such as onely labor, as the
oxe, horse, mule, or asse.

vvhether it happen by your negligence in not hauing beene carefull ynough in husbanding
of them: or by reason of age, seeing the earth will sometime rest it selfe as

soyles, and no other; for that which is truely fertile and good ground, will neuer be
wearie of bearing, especially if it lie low, and be gentlie washt with waters; but that
which lies high or violently against the heat of the Sun, will many times decay in his
aboundance, which when you shall at any time perceiue, it shall be good to forbeare

ground that it waxeth barren, then you shall vse the like meanes, that you vvould
in making of new meadows; set downe before in the second chapter of this booke:

downe with your selfe to reduce them into arable ground, especially those which are

the doing whereof, you must cut the vpper face and crust of the earth in Aprill, with
a shallow delfe, in turfes some fadome and a halfe long, and halfe as broad, and to the
thicknesse of two fingers: drie these turfes in the Sunne, and being concocted by the
heat of the Sunne, fit them one to another, and lay one vpon another, in manner of a
furnace: afterward, set fire to them with good store of straw: when they are burned,
let them coole sixe or seuen daies: after spead the ashes thereof equally all ouer the

it is accordingly performed, then plow it vp in Iune, and presently after sow it vvith

                     REmember this, that three things carefully kept and increased by the diligence
of the vvorkeman, doe make rich vvithout any great trauell, that
is to say, the meadow-grounds, the Ozier-plot, and the Willow-plot,
vvhich by the meanes of vvater lightly slyding through the veines of
the earth in the fat and vvell liking places that are vpon the sides of hills, and by the
vvatering of manifold streames round about, doe naturally grow eu

hoopes for vessell, and binding of them, as also for fewell, the benefit of poles, woodden
vessells, arbours, stakes for hedges, and supporters for vines. We will therefore
speake first of the ordering and husbanding of the Ozier-plot, and after it of the
Willow-plot, vvhich vve do not dreame to haue any other assigned place, than about
the meadows, and far remoued from the arable ground; in as much as their shadow
is so hurtfull to wheat, line, pulse, and other graine, as that they neuer grow vvell
where they are ouershadowed by these: but on the contrarie, meadow grounds receiue
great profit thereby: as well because that grasse doth grow the fairer and more
pleasantly in the shadow, than vvhere it is not shadowed, as also for that the leaues of
Ozier, Willow, Aller, and such other Trees, falling vpon the meadowes, and there
rotting, maketh them the more fat, abounding in grasse, and fertile. The Ozier
then (which old Writers call Sea-willow, or Wicker-tree, that is to say, apt to bend)
desireth not to come verie neere to the water, but loueth rather to stand vpon the descending
side of the valley, and the Ozier-plot would end at the sides of the Willow-plot:
the Ozier-plot must be prickt with a line, and prettie small ditches drawne out
in it betwixt two lines, and euerie slip must be set one from another about fiue foore
and a halfe, to giue them their spreading. It vvill not abide the shadow of any tree,
but loueth much to haue the fruition of the South-Sunne. The tame red Ozier requireth
great husbanding, and is afraid of frosts, and the showres of raine that fall in
March, and verie cold vvater: the vvhite and the greene Ozier, vvhich neither bend
nor yet defend themselues so well, are of a harder nature, and grow higher. It vvill be
good to pricke downe moe of the tame ones than of the other, and alwaies to set them
out of the shadow, and there must be but a little water at their foot, the most part of
the time: vvherefore you must make furrowes by the vvay, to keepe and reserue water.
It must be dressed twice in a yeare to make it grow vvell, that is to say, about
mid-May, and towards the end of Nouember, presently after that it is gathered, being
also the time of planting of it.
                  It is verie delightsome vnto it to haue the earth raised vvith the spade and stirred,
and to cast in again the clods vnto the foot some fifteen daies after S. Michael, which
is the time of gathering them, and making of them vp into bottles. You must keepe
your bottles made of the thicknesse of a fadome, fresh &amp; coole in some cellar or 
                        〈◊〉
                     ,
and if the season be drie, to vvater them throughout now and then: some slip off the
leaues in gathering of them, thereof to make good ashes: others let the leaues fall of
themselues, and after gather them for the houshold, and in Winter-nights by the fire
side make the slaues spend their time in cleauing them, for to make baskets of. some
doe not cut the oziers all from the head, but such slips as are about the edges of it, and
leaue the maister-twig to stand vvhole for fiue or sixe yeares, when it must be renewed
and pricked downe againe: for this is the terme of the plant: for in all the time
following the plant doth nothing but drie, and the twig harden.

                  Of the Willow-plot.
                  
                     SOme say, that the Willow-plot craueth the like husbandrie that the Oier-plot,
because the Willow differeth onely from the Ozier in vse, bignesse,
and barke: for the Willow-tree is for poles, the Ozier (as hath
beene said) for bindings about the vine and caske: the Willow is thicke
and growing taller, the Ozier is smaller and lower: the Willow-tree hath a barke of
a darke purple colour, the Ozier of a yellow straw colour. But vvhatsoeuer it is, the
Willow loueth vvaterie places, and is planted of the tops cut off, or else of poles:
the poles are taken from aboue, of a good thicknesse, but notwithstanding not thicker
than the arme, and they must be planted and pricked downe in the earth so deepe
as they should stand before they touch the firme ground: the cut of the top may be
of the length of a foot and a halfe, and be set in the earth, being couered a little. That
which you shall plant, must be cut from the tree verie drie, because it will not thriue
if it be vvet when it is cut: therefore you must shun rainie da
                        •
                     es in the cutting of your
Willowes. The best time of planting the Willow is in Februarie in the beginning,
or in the end of Ianuarie, vvhen as the heart of the great cold is broken, vvhich oftentimes
hurteth this plant when it is newlie planted: It is true that it may be planted
at any time after the beginning of Nouember, yea it may be then both planted
and gathered. The plants shall euerie one stand from another sixe foot square, and
they must be carefully husbanded for the first three yeres, as if they were yong vines.
You shall find a larger discourse of the Willow-tree in the sixth Booke. The distilled
vvater of Willowes is good to be drunke for the staying of all sorts of fluxes of
bloud: the decoction of the leaues or the lee made of the ashes of the vvood beeing
drunke, doth kill bloud-suckers vvhich hang in the throat.
               
               
                  CHAP. IX.
                  Of the Elme.
                  
                     MEn of old time did much esteeme the Elme for the vine sake, because they
married the vine vnto the Elme,The vine maried
vnto the Elme. as also, it is yet practised of some vnto
this day in Italie, but now the Elme is applied to another manner of vse
by the husbandman: and for that cause vve haue giuen in charge to euery
housholder to plant a plot of elmes, at the end of his orchard, as vvell to make fagots
of, as to make vvheeles and axle-trees of for his carts and ploughes, as also for fire-wood
and other easements, besides the pleasure that the Elme-tree affordeth all the
Sommer long. For the planting then of your Elme-plot, make choyce of a fat peece
of ground, and vvithall somewhat moist (although this Tree be easie to grow in any
kind of ground) vvhich you shall digge and cast, breaking the clods afterward verie
small, in so much as that you shall make all the earth as it were dust, and in the Spring
you shall harrow it and lay it euen: afterward, you shall sow it verie thicke vvith the
seed of elmes, vvhich shall by this time become little red, hauing beene a long time
in the Sunne, and yet notwithstanding retayning his naturall substance and moisture:
and you shall sow it so thicke as that all the earth shall be couered vvith it, then
cast of fine mould vpon it, good two fingers thicke, and vvater it a little, and couer
the earth vvith straw or broken boughes and braunches, to the end that vvhat shall
come out of the earth may not be deuoured of birds. And vvhen the siences shall
begin to shew, take away the straw and boughes, and pull vp the bad vveeds verie

carefully vvith your hands, in such sort as that the small rootes of the elmes vvhich as
yet are tender, be not pluckt vp therewithall. The waies and squares must be so discreetly
cast, as that he which is to weed them may easily reach to the middest of them
euerie vvay. F
                        •
                     r if they vvere too broad, then he should be constrained in pulling
vp the vveeds to tread the earth vvith his feet, by which meanes the shoots might be
hurt. After vvhen the branches are put vp some three foot high to take them vp from
their nurserie, and to plant them in another ground, and after that to transplant them
againe. The Elme-tree also may be planted of small branches taken from great etmes,
and that a great deale better in Autumne than in the Spring time: after three yeares
passed, they must be transplanted and that after Autumne, vvhen as the earth beginneth
to be moist vntill the beginning of the Spring, as being the time when the roote
may be drawne without leauing of the barke behind: you may plant an elme at euerie
fortie foots end, and not touch them at all for two yeares after: vvhich being passed,
you must dig the earth all about the bodie of the Tree, pruning and picking it
with a small handbill, euerie two yeares. We will not make any longer description
of the elme: but send you to the sixth booke, where you shall find particularly and
amply declared, how this tree is to be planted, and in what soyle it doth principally
delight to grow.
               
               
                  CHAP. X.
                  Of the Aller.
                  
                     WE see that the Aller or Alder-tree is no lesse profitable for the Husbandman,
than the Elme, in as much as the wood of Aller doth serue to make
many implements &amp; working tooles, as ladders, 
                        •
                     ailes for the cart, poles,
handles for tooles, rackes for horse-meat, and such other things, to lay
the foundations of buildings vpon, which are laid in the riuers, fens, or other standing
vvaters, because it neuer rotteth in the vvater, but lasteth as it vvere for euer, and beareth
vp maruailous strange and huge masses.
                  The Aller therefore shall be planted neere some little brooke, in some moist and
vvaterish meadowes: for the Aller-tree naturally delighteth in vvater more than any
other tree doth, and it looketh that the most part of his roots should be in and lower
than the vvater, for else it will not come to any growth. The aller is not sown because
it beareth no seed, fruit, or flowers: yet it may be planted two vvaies, either of braunches
taken from the great trees, or else of liue rootes drawne out of moist places their
earth vvith them, and so set in another moist place, and that in such sort, as that at the
least the one halfe of the roots may be lower than the vvater, and couered aboue with
earth a fingers thicknesse: and vvithall, before it be planted, you must cut the small
branches away till within a finger of the maine root, vvhich afterward will shoot vp
many small siences. This tree is easie to take and grow againe in moist places, because
it hath much pith in it, and putteth forth much wood in a short time. You may 
                        〈◊〉
                     
your aller to grow high in any place without any great labour, and to small profit because
it would need continuall watering. It is better then that your aller stand in waterie
ground (as we haue said) that so it may both please and profit you. See further
of the aller-tree in the sixth booke. The fresh leaues doe stay inflammations: being
put vnder the naked soles of the feet, they greatly take away their wearisomenesse,
which by far walking haue wearied themselues: full and all moist with the morning
dew, being spred in Sommer all ouer a chamber, they kill fleas. The barke serueth to
make inke, and to die leather blacke.

                  Of the manner of making Stewes and Pooles
for keeping of Fishes.
                  
                     THe chiefe and principall point of a good Countrey Farme, is to want
nothing, either needfull for the prouision of the chiefe Lord, or auaileable
for the profit that may come thereof. The good householder then
shall not esteeme a little of Fish, seeing that of them he may make both
prouision for his table, and great gaine vnto his purse: but rather shall prouide some
place neere vnto his house, for to cast Pooles or Stewes in, to the end, that when need
is, he may find victuals therein both for himselfe and his familie, and that as readie,
as if it were alreadie in the Kitchin: besides what he may yearely sell of that his store
to make money into his purse.
                  Therefore for the appointing out of ground for these his PoolesThe situation of the Pooles. or Stewes to
breed or feed his fish in, he shall chuse it ioyning vnto his Medowes, in some leane
place, and such as he could otherwise make no profit of, and yet it must be in a firme
ground, that is grauellie or sandie, for such places doe feed fishes excellent well: notwithstanding,

furnish his Pooles or Stewes with such manner of fish. The Poole shall be maruellously
well seated, if the commodiousnesse of the place will affoord it continuall refreshment
from some flowing Fountaine, or some Brooke, or little Riuer falling into
it, whereby continually the first water may be remoued, and new supplyed in place
thereof, not suffering the other to stand too long impounded: and therefore, if it be
possible, the Poole is to haue conuenient issue in one part or other, for so by this
meanes the water is renewed the more easily, and the fish therein made the more
chearefull and better thri

small holes in the conduits, that so by them the water may find one passage in, and
another out, and yet to stay the fish for getting forth. It will be good that the Poole
be large and great, to the end, that the

they sustaine. It will be good also to make in these Pooles some corners, or starting
holes, like little lodging roomes, in the wall thereof, to the end, that thereby the fish
may find place for to hide it selfe, and to auoid the great heat of the Summer: prouided
notwithstanding, that they be so made, as that the water which is in them
may easily get out againe.
                  These Fish-ponds also may be made in anie low Valley, which the hills enuironing
on euerie side, send downe their waters into the same, making it continually
wet: so that (in truth) without it be applyed to this purpose, it will serue for no other
good purpose. In this place, aboue all other, you shall make your Fish-pond,To make a Fish-pond.

noting how the water descendeth, you shall iust against that descent make the head
of your Pond, mounting it of such a height, that no land-water whatsoeuer may

ouerflow it, and this head you shall make in this wise: first, so soone as you haue
drained the ground, and made the earth firme where the head must be, you shall

and bundells of wood, you shall ram in hard betweene the pile, till you haue couered
them, then you shall driue in more piles, and ram them likewise as before, heaping
thus pile vpon pile, and earth vpon earth, till you haue made the head of that
conuenient height which you did desire, and if in the middest of this head you preserue
a conuenient place for a sluce or floud-gate, which you may draw vp and sh

shall make a small sluce or two vvith fiue grates in them, to stay the Fish from passing
through the same, vvhich sluces shall conuay the vvast vvater, vvhich shall at
any time rise aboue the height or leuell of the bankes: the bottome and sides of this
pond you shall paue all ouer with fine greene-grasse-turfe which vvill be a great nourishment
to the Fish, and aboue the water you shall plant Oziers, and on the top of
the head diuers rowes of Willow, because all fish take great delight in the shadows
and if you intend the pond for Carpe or Breame, you shall all along one side of the
pond, stake and bind downe diuers fagots made of brush-wood in which the fish
shall cast their young or spawne, and so haue them preserued, which otherwise would
be destroyed.

good meat, especially if he be kept in springing vvaters, and into vvhich there runneth
some riuer (as the poole of Nau, or Nouï, as also that of Gouuieux, the two most
naturall and greatest pooles that are in all France, and such as neuer drie vp) but
in keeping of him there is this daunger, namely, that he is a verie tyrant amongst all
fresh-water-fish, eating and deuouring the small thereof, in such sort as that in fishing
there is not a little one of that kind cast into the pooles againe, after they be once

but in running vvaters, or in great springs. The Salmon-trout is a verie daintie thing,

Salmon, after whom he had his name giuen. The Tench,Tench. Eele. Bourbet, and Cod, are of a

with many rods running one into another, and this is fastened vnto a leape made of
Oziers, and are onely to take Eeles or other fish in mill-dames, or other such lake

market (for my meaning is that the good farmer should make his profit of all things)
the leannesse thereof vvill manifest, that they vvere not taken in any full Sea at their
libertie, but in some place of gard and restraynt, and so they vvill not sell so deere
by much. And sometimes it vvill be good to cast vpon the pooles and ponds

are sicke.

cast into the pond morning and euening; the young brood of Waspes when you
find their neasts, being cast into the water, is a food that fish will delight in before

angle, which is the most generous and best kind of all other, and may truely be called
the Emperor of all exercises.Art of Angling To speake them first of this art of angling or taking
of fish with the angle, you shall vnderstand that it consisteth in three especiall things,
that is to say, in the instrument which is the angle, in the intisement vvhich is the
bait, and in the true vse of them both together, vvhich is the seasons and times of the
yeare fittest for the sport. To speake then first of the angle-rod, it must be generally of
two peeces, but particularly, as for the pike, or other greater fish, it may be made of
one entire peece; the substance of the stock would be a vvel grown ground Wi

vse to compound their rods of many peeces, as those which are made of cane,
wherein one joynt is applied into another, but they are more for pleasure than any
generall profit. To these rods doe belong lines made of the strongest and longest
horse-haire which can be got, nor are th

euer to gather them from stoned horses, and not from mares or geldings: of haire, the
blacke is the vvorst, the vvhite and gray best, and other colours indifferent: your
smallest lines vvould consist of three haires, and your bigger of seuen: if amongst your
haire you mixe a silke-threed or two, the line vvill be the better and stronger: you
shall twist your haires neither too hard nor too soft, but hold a mediocritie, so as they
may twine and couch close together, and the ends you shall fasten together vvith a
fishers-knot, vvhich is your ordinarie fast knot, foulded foure or fiue times abou

your lines, they must answer to the places in which you angle, some being foure fadome,
some sixe, and some more, according to the length of your rod, or the depth
of the vvater: your lines (though their naturall colours, as being vvhite or gray, is
not amisse) vvould yet sometimes be coloured of other colours, according to the seasons
of the yeare, for so the shadow of them (vvhich is most daungerous) will least
scarre the fish, and soonest in

from the Spring till the beginning of Winter. If you vvill haue your haires yellow,
you shall take Allome-water (as beforesaid) and Marigolds, and boyle them
therein, adding thereto a handfull of turmerick, or for want thereof, so much of green
Walnut-leaues, and mixing it with the vvater, steepe your haires therein a day and
a night, then take them from them, and drie them: these yellow coloured lines are
good also to angle with in cleare water, if they be full of weeds,

flowers, for it is not vnlike to the stalkes thereof, and the time best from Michaelmas
till Christmas. To make your lines russet, you shall take a quart of Allome water, and
as much strong lee, then put thereunto a handfull of soot, and as much Browne of
Spaine: then when it hath boyled well an houre or two, set it by to coole, and being
cooled, steepe the haires therein a full day and a night, and then lay the haires to dry.
This colour is good to angle within deepe waters, whether they be riuers or standing
pooles, and are best to be vsed from Christmas till after Easter. But if you will haue
them of a darke browne colour, then you shall take a pound of Vmber, and halfe so
much soot, and seeth it in a pottle of Ale a good space: then being coole, steepe your
haires therein the space of foure and twentie houres, and then hang them vp to drie,
and if the colour be not darke ynough, you may adde a little more of the Vmber, and
it will darken it. These lines are best to angle with in blacke and muddie waters, whether
they be standing pooles or running streames, and will endure all seasons of the
yeare. Lastly, to make your lines of a 
                        •
                     awnie colour, you shall take lime and water,
and mixe it together▪ and steepe your haires therein halfe a day: then take them forth
and steepe them double so long time in Tanners ouze, and then hang them vp to dry.
These lines are best to angle with in

if with this colour, or the greene, you mix a siluer thred, it wil not be amisse, and with
anie of the other colours a gold thred they will be much better to angle withall. Also
you must remember to make at each end of your lines good bigge loopes, the one, to

end, and small and sharpe at the other, euer obseruing, according to the bignesse of
your line, to make the bignesse of your corke: as, for a line of three haires, a corke of
an ynch, or little more, long, and to the bigger lines, bigger corks: through this corke
you shall thrust a quill, and through the quill the line. The corke serueth onely to let
you know when the fish biteth, therefore the lesse it is, the better it is, for it onely
giues the lesse shadow, prouided that it be euer in your eye: for though some Anglers
will fish without corkes, yet it is not so good, nor so certaine. In placing your
corke vpon your line, you must put the small end downeward, and the bigge end
to the topward. Now there be some Anglers which make their corkes of the fashion
of Nutmegs, small at both ends, and bigge in the middest: and it is not much to be

                        〈◊〉
                     , onely it is a little sooner apt to sinke, and you may thereby strike before
the fish haue fully bitten: others shape their corkes in the fashion of a Whirle, or of
a little Apple, round and flat on both sides: and this corke is not amisse to angle
with at great fish, because it being not so apt to sinke, will flote till the hooke be fastened,
and that the fish beginneth to shoot away with the bait: so that the Angler then
striking, can seldome or neuer loose his labour.
                  The next instrument to these which belongeth to the Angle, is your Hooks,Hookes. which
are of diuers shapes, some being bigge, and some little, and some of a meane betweene
both, according to the fish at which you angle. The best thing to make your hooks of,
is either old Spanish needles, or strong wyar drawne as neere as can be to that hardnesse
of temper, which being nayled and allayed in the fire, you may bend anie way.
Now the best way to soften your wyar before you worke it, is to hold it in the blaze
of a candle till it be red hot, and then let it coole softly and gently of it selfe: or if not
thus, then roule your wyar vp, &amp; put it into a charcoale fire till it be red hot, and then
let it coole at leisure. As touching the making of your hookes, you shall onely with a
paire of plyars bend them to what proportion you please, and then with a sharpe file

you must warpe your line. But because the trouble of making is a little noysome, it
shall be best to buy them from such as make a liuing or trade thereof, and to buy of all

sorts, euen from the least to the biggest, as well double hookes as single: the double,
which is for the Pike or bigger fish; and the single, which is for the Pearch, Trout, or
middle sort. Your double hooks are (as it were) two hooks of one piece of wyar, turned
contrarie waies one from the other. This double hooke must not be fastened like
the single to the line, but to a strong wyar ioyned vnto it, of a handfull long, or more,
being well wound about and warped with a smaller wyar: then to it another wyar of
the same length, warped as aforesaid, and by linkes ioyned together, and then the line
fastened to the last linke:To fasten the

hooke from shearing or biting in pieces with the teeth of the greater fish. Now for
your single hookes, you shall thus fixe them vnto their lines: Take a length of your
twisted haires, containing that number which is fit for your hooke, and hauing made
a loope at one end, lay the other end vpon the inside of your hooke: then with a silke
thred, of the colour of your line, whip and warpe the hooke round about, as thicke,
close, and strait as may be, and then running the last end through the whole warpe,
draw it as fast as you can, then cut it away close by the warpe. After your

hooke to the bottome, neither being so heauie to make the corke sinke, nor so light, as
not with the smallest touch to make the corke dip into the water. You shall vnderstand,
that your first plummet would be a foot from the hooke, the rest not aboue an
ynch one distant from another, &amp; not being aboue fiue or seuen at the most: yet some
Anglers vse nine; but it is not much materiall. There is in the plumbing of lines three

to these before rehearsed, are vild and naught to angle in.
                  After the knowledge of seasons,The best maner of fishing. you shall know the best manner how to stand and
place your bodie whilest you angle: for if you angle in anie pond or standing water,
then you shall chuse that place which is deepest, blackest, and least transparent, shadowing
your selfe vnder the banke, or so, as your shadow may be carried from the
water; for it euer breeds a fright vnto the fishes: but if you angle in anie riuer, you
shall chuse that place which is deepest and clearest; and here also you shall striue to
conceale your selfe as much as is possible, by standing behind trees or bushes, or anie
thing else that may couer you.
                  Next to this,The haunts of fishes. you shall know the haunts of fishes: as thus, the Carpe, Eele, and
Tench doe euer haunt muddie places; the Carpe lying in the bottome thereof, the
Tench amongst the weeds, and the Eeles vnder stones, or other couert: the Breame,
the Cheuine, and the Pike haunt euer the cleare and sandie bottome; the Pike, where
you see great store of small frie▪ the Cheuine, where the streame runneth swiftest, and
the shade is greatest; and the Breame, where the water is bro
                        •
                     dest, and the depth giueth
greatest libertie: also these three delight more in ponds than in riuers. The Salmon
hath his haunt in the swiftest and broadest riuers, whose channell falls into the
sea: The Trout loueth smaller brookes, the current being cleare and grauellie, and
lodgeth most in deepe holes: so doth the Pearch also, onely he abideth most in the
creekes or hollow places which are about the bankes. The Gudgin, the Loach, and
the Bulhead haunt shallow waters: The Barbel, Roche, Dace, and Ruffe, haunt the
deepe shadie places of those waters which are mixt with more 
                        •
                     and than grauell, or
where the clay is firme, and not

                     imie, and loue to lye vnder the shadowes of trees or
bushes that grow on the banke. The Luce or Lucerne haunteth the broad and large
meares, being deepe and still, and euer lodgeth in the bottome thereof. The Shad and
Tweat haunt those waters which are brackish, deepe, and accustomed to ebbe and
flow: and where they haunt, there commonly is found both the Muller and the Suant,
all which loue to lodge close and flat at the bottome, so it be rather clay than
grauell.
                  Next to the knowledge of the haunts of fishes,Baites. you shall learne to know the seuerall
baits, which, besides those formerly described (which are indeed French secrets)
there are manie other, and may be reduced to two kinds, Liue-baits, and Dead-baits:
your Liue-baits are wormes of all kinds, especially the Red-worme, the Maggot, the
Bob, the Dore, browne Flyes, Frogges, Grashoppers, Hornets, Wasps, Bees, Snailes,
small Roches, Bleakes, Gudgins, or else Loaches: your dead-baits are pastes of all
kinds, of which we haue exprest diuers before, and their vse; yong brood of Waspes,
dried or vndried, clottered Bloud, Chee

and all sorts of flies made of silke and feathers so liuely, that they will many times deceiue
a good iudgement, of which there are diuers, as the dunne flie, the stone flie,
the red flie, the yellow flie, the blacke flie, the darke yellow flie, the moorish flie, the
tawnie flie,The fit times for euerie bait. the Waspe flie, the shell-flie, and the cloudie darke flie. Now for the seasons
in which all these seuerall baites are to be vsed, you shall know, that the Red-worme
will serue for small fish all the yeare long; the Maggot is good in Iulie, the
Bob and Dore in May, the browne flies in Iune, Frogges in March, Grashoppers in
September, Hornets, Waspes, and Bees in Iuly, Snailes in August: all pastes are good
in May, Iune, and Iuly, dried Waspes in May, Sheepes bloud and Cheese in Aprill,

and for Bramble-berries, or Corne-seeds, they are good at the fall of the lease onely.
Lastly, for your dead flies; the dunne flie is good in March and Februarie▪ the stone
flie is for Aprill; the red flie and the yellow flie are for May; the black flie, the darke
yellow flie, and the moorish flie, are for Iune; the tawnie flie for part of May and
part of Iune; the Waspe flie and the shell flie are for Iuly; and the cloudie darke flie
for August.
                  Now for the preseruation of all baits,To preserue 
                           〈◊〉
                        . especially the liuing ones, for the dead doe
not so soone perish; you shall vnderstand, that they must not be kept all together, but
euerie kind seuerall by it selfe, and nourished with such things as they delight in: and
first, for the Red-worme, you shall put them into a bagge of red cloth, and chopping
a handfull of Fennell, mix it with halfe so much fine mould, and put it to the wormes,
and they will not onely liue long therein, but also scoure and seed. Some put mosse
amongst them; others put Pa

first is best, and will keepe them full two moneths in perfection: For the Maggot,
you shall mix with them Sheepes 
                        •
                     allow, or little bits of a beasts liuer. The best way
to scoure them, is to put them into a bagge of blanketting with sand, and hang them
where they may haue the ayre of the fire for an houre or two. For Frogges and Gr

                     shoppers,
you shall keepe them in wet mosse and long grasse, moistened euerie night
with water. As for the Bob, Cadys worme, the Canker, and such like, you shall
keepe them with the same things that you find them vpon: and for all sorts of liue
flies, you shall vse them as you take them; onely the Waspe, the Hornet, and the
Bumble-bee, you shall fi

drawne, and then dippe all their heads into Sheepes bloud, and then drie them againe,
and so keepe them in a close boxe, and they will keepe two or three moneths
in verie good perfection.
                  Now, for the seuerall fishes, and how they delight in euerie seuerall bait,To fit fish with the baits they delight in. you shall
know, that the Gudgin, Roch, and Dace, loue the Red-worme, Cod-worme, Maggot,
clottered bloud, or the young brood of Wasps; the Carpe loues paste, the Mosse-worme,
the Red-worme, the Menow, the Cadys worme, or Grashopper; the Chub,
Cheuine, or Trout, loue all sorts of dead flies, Cadys worme, Bob, Frogges, Do
                        •
                     es, or
Hornets; the Eele loues the Red-worme, or Sheepes guts; the Flounder or Suant
loues the Red-worme, or brood of Waspes; the Grayling, or the Barbel, loue all that
the Trout loues; the Breame loues Butterflies, greene flies, paste, or brood of Wasps;
the Tench loues paste, the Red-worme, Maggots, &amp; dried Wasps; the Bleake, Ruffe,
and Pearch, loue the Red-worme, the house-flie, fat Bacon, Bob, Maggot, or Canker;
the Pyke loues the small Roch, Dace, or Menow, Frogges, or Bulheads: Lastly, the
Salmon loues all those baits which the Trout loues; as paste or flies in Summer, and
all sorts of Wormes, or the Cankers or water-Dockes in the Winter. And thus much
for the generall satisfaction of all Readers, which desire knowledge in this art of Angling,
and which indeed is verie proper and fit for our Husbandman.
               
               
                  CHAP. XVII.
                  The fishing of all sorts of Fish.
                  
                     THe fishing or taking of fish is diuers, according to the Riuers and Waters
wherein they keep, as also in respect of the diuersitie of the fishes themselues: for the fishing in the sea, and that in fresh water, is not all one, but
seuerall, and diuers: the great fishes one way, the Eele another way, the
Pike another way, and the Carpe is taken another way. But whereas it might fall out,
that such variable manner of fishing might be verie difficult and long to describe, we
will leaue this knowledge to such as make account to sell and buy fish, and will onely
declare, for the benefit of the householder, that the chiefest and most principall waies
to take fish, are either in the Maund, or with the Casting-net, or with the Line, or with

Nets, or with the Hooke. The Nets do heape together greatest store of fish, but they
are chargeable to maintaine: the Casting-net is of the same condition: the Line and
hooke are the most ingenious and wittie, but least profitable, and of slendrest reward.
                  The fittest time to goe a fishing in Autumne,The time to take fish. is after Sunne-set, and then principally
when it is betwixt night and day, for then fishes are slumbring, and that so deepely,
as that they may be taken at their rest with light and flaming torches. In Winter, the
fittest time to fish in, is about noone: in the Spring time all the day long, but chiefely
before the Sunne rise: which Spring time is the most fit of all other times for fishing;
in as much as then the water being warme, and the fish stirred vp to engender, they
rise from the bottome of the depths to the vppermost part of the waters, yea, oftentimes
to the verie edges thereof. The worst and most vnfit time of all other is the
Summer, especially whiles the Dogge-daies last, the heat whereof causeth the fish to
die, and constraineth it to betake it selfe to the bottome of the depths: so that if you
would fish in Summer, it must be in the night season. In fishing you are to haue regard
vnto the wind: so that when the North wind bloweth, you must turne your
Nets toward the South wind, and the South wind blowing toward the North wind.
In like manner, when the Westerne wind bloweth, your Nets must be turned toward
the East, and contrarily: but before all things, fishing must be gone about in a calme
time, when there is not anie tempest abroad.
                  For to gather fish together into one place:To gather the fish together into one place. Take Penyryall, Sauorie, Organie, and
Marierome, of euerie one the weight of three French crownes, of the barke of the
Frankincense and Myrrhe-tree, of each one ounce, of sweet Cherries dried and infused
in good wine, halfe a pound, of a Hogges liuer rosted, of Goats grease and Garlike,
of each a pound: stampe euerie one by it selfe, and after put thereunto some sine
grauell; with this, mixt together, you shall feed the fish for some houre or two before
you cast in your Net, which when at such time you haue cast in, you shall therewith
compasse the place about.
                  To catch all sorts of fish:To catch all sorts of fishes. Take Sheepes sewet, of burnt Sesamum, Garlike, Organie,
Thyme, and dried Marierome, of euerie one a sufficient competent quantitie,
stampe them with the crummes of bread and wine, and giue of this composition to
the fish to eat: Or else take sweet Cherries dried, and braying them, make pills thereof
to giue vnto fishes: Or make a meat with vnquencht Lime, old Cheese, and Rams
sewet: cast this into the water, and presently you shall see the fish flote and lye still
vpon the water. Fishermen, to catch small fish with the Line, doe bait hookes with
small earth-wormes, whereof the fish are verie desirous and greedie. Otherwise: take
the Indian shell, Cummin, old Cheese, flower of Wheat, knead them all together with
Wine, make pills thereof as great as small Peason: cast them into the Riuer when the
water shall be quiet and calme, all the fish that shall tast of this confection, as though
they were drunke and besotted, will run to the brinke of the Riuer, and so, as that you
may take them vp with your hand: Or else make a confection with the round root of
Birthwort bruised, or Sowes bread, and vnquencht Lime: cast vpon the water some
portion of this consection, the fishes will hasten vnto it presently, and hauing tasted
thereof, will die suddenly.

                  Of the common Measures whereby things
are measured.
                  
                     NOtwithstanding, that the Art of measuring Grounds doth
more properly belong vnto the Geometrician, than vnto
the Husbandman; and euen as chiefe Masons and Masterbuilders,
who ought to haue the skill of Measuring, doe
not vouchsafe, at anie time, to measure the Workes and
Buildings which they haue set vp and finished, but leaue
the same for such as make profession of Measuring: So
likewise it may seeme, that this is no dutie of the Husbandmans,
to measure out his grounds, but rather appertaining, and therefore to be
expected of them which practise such art and skill. Notwithstanding, being desirous
that the Master of this our Countrey Farme should not be ignorant of anie
thing which may serue for the enriching of his house, and encrease of his wealth,
I haue thought it meete and reasonable, before I passe anie further vnto my purposed
discourse of the husbanding and tilling of Corne-ground, familiarly to vnfold
certaine rules of Measuring, which are verie common with vs here in Franc
                        •
                     ,
and wherewith the Farmer, in case of necessitie, and for his commoditie, may
helpe himselfe.
                  To begin therefore with the matter, all Grounds and Lands, whether they be
Medowes, Vineyards, Woods, Isles of Water, Courts, Gardens, Corne-ground,
places, fields, and others whatsoeuer, are measured in France by the foot, fadome,

and pole.The Measures in France called the Kings measures. The foot, according to the Kings measure, containeth throughout all
France twelue ynches: the ynch twelue-lines, and 
                        •
                     uerie-line must be of equall
length to the thicknesse of a barly corne that is full and well fedde. A

third part of a foot,The Kings 
                           〈◊〉
                        . is called a Dour: and the fourth part is called a Quarter. The
fadome and the pole are measured by the foot,The

                        . but how manie 
                        •
                     oot the one and
the other should containe,The dour. there is not anie so sure and certaine a rule which holdeth
through all France,The quarter. as there is for the foot, by reason of the vari
                        •
                     tie of Measures,
and those not in diuers Countries of France onely,The fadome. as in Britaine, Normandie,
Gascoine,The pole. Poictou, and others, but also euen in places situate within some one
Isle of France, and standing hard together; as may easily be seene neere vnto Paris:
in such sort, as that the fadome of some Countries containeth sixe foot and eight
ynches; and the pole, twentie foot: elsewhere, the fadome containeth seuen foot
and foure ynches, and the pole two and twentie foot: In manie places the fadome
containeth sixe foot, and the pole eighteene foot: In others againe the fadome containeth
sixe foot fiue ynches and halfe an ynch, or there about, and the pole nineteene
foot and one dour, which is foure ynches.
                  True it is, that as the rule is certaine through all France, that a foot containeth
twelue ynches, so it is as sure and inu
                        •
                     olable, that a pole containeth three fadome.
Wherefore, without standing much vpon the fadome (which in truth is a measure
more fit for Masons and Carpenters, than for measurers of ground) for the
well measuring of all sorts of grounds, you must content your selfe with two principall
measures, the foot and the pole, not forgetting or omitting your ynche
                        •
                     ,
quarters, and thirds, which are parts of a foot. Which more is, in as much as feet,
fadomes, and poles are but small measures, and such as whereof might rise (as it were)
an infinite number, or (at the least) a verie troublesome number, and such a one, as
the reckoning whereof could hardly be kept, especially when there is need of
measuring a Wood, Medowes, Places, Isles, arable ground, and other places of
great compasse; besides the foot, fadome, and pole, there is vsed another measure,
which the Frenchmen call an Arpent, but of the people of Burgundie and Cha
                        •
                     
                     paigne,
and manie others, it is called Iournax, deriued from the Latine word I
                           •
                        
                        gerum,
which containeth as much ground as two Oxen or Horse coupled or yoaked
together can tyll in one day. The Normans call it an Acre, taken from the
Romane word Actus. This measure ariseth of manie poles being put one vnto
another, or else multiplied together, as the poles doe rise of manie feet multiplied.
                  It is verie true, that euen as the pole doth not hold throughout all Fraunce
one measure of feet, so neither doth the Arpent consist infallibly of one number
of poles: but looke (almost) how manie Countries there are, euen so manie differences
of sorts of Arpents there are likewise: And that it is so, there are to be

                        〈◊〉
                     , amongst manie other, foure

                        •
                     re, called the Arpent, as being
most accustomed to be vsed. The first of them is called the Kings Arpent,
and it is vsed of men ordinarily about the measuring of Woods, and it 
                        〈◊〉
                     
of two and twentie foot to the pole, twelue ynches to the foot, and a hundred poles
to the Arpent. The second is more common, consisting of twentie foot for a
pole, twelue ynches for a foot, and a hundred poles for an Arpent. The third is the
least vsuall of all, it consisteth of nineteene foot and a third, which are foure ynches
in euerie pole, twelue ynches to a foot, and a hundred poles to an Arpent.
The fourth is most common of them all, consisting of eighteene foot for eueri
                        •
                     
pole, twelue ynches for euerie foot, and a hundred poles for euerie Arpen
                        •
                     . Because
therefore of such great diuersities of measures of the Arpent, the Measure
                        •
                     
shall not of necessitie bee put beside the right performing of his worke; before
he begin to measure, he shall diligently and wisely enquire of the measure that
is holden by the custome of the Countrey, in the place where he is called fo
                        •
                      to
measure.
                  
                     
Furthermore, you must know, that the arpent may be diuided into manie parts,
as the halfe arpent, a tierce, a fourth, a halfe fourth, a halfe tierce: all which containe,
euerie one according vnto his proportion, so much as the whole arpent
containeth.
                  
                     The instrument and persons required as necessarie to helpe
to make measure.
                     THe Measurer must be prouided of tenne or twelue arrowes, otherwise called
little broches, or prickes, because they are prickt downe in the earth, to guide
the chayne: they are made of wood, but harnessed at the nether end with a sharpe
pointed end of yron, of the length of two foot, or thereabout, being of such
thicknesse, all the tenne or twelue together, as that a boy of fifteene yeares old
may easily hold them in his fist. Wee haue said, that hee must haue some tenne
or twelue of these arrowes, that is to say, tenne of them, when the Measurer doth
vse his Geometricall staffe in stead of one sticke, or eleuen, when he doth not vse
his staffe.
                     The second instrument verie necessarily required for the Measurer to measure
assuredly withall (that is to say, not to faile in his feet and poles, and in the number
of them) is the Richards chayne, which is made of yron rather than of coard,
(because that coard being apt to stretch, it will not keepe his exact length constantly
at all times) and also sufficient strong and thicke, and distinguished and
diuided by round buckles or mayles at the end of euerie foot, to the end it may be
folded vp together the more easily into one: It must be of the length of a pole,
according vnto the custome of measuring in Fraunce; or of two or three poles,
more or lesse, according vnto the aduise of the Measurer, and custome of the coun
                        
                           •
                        rey:
and it must likewise haue in the end of euerie length thereof a ring, or round
hoope, so wide and great, as that the middle finger either of the Measurer or of his
assistant may freely goe through it, without anie manner of force or violence vsed.
Besides, the said chayne must also (if a man be so disposed) be marked by the way,
that is to say, into tierces and fourthes, with some mayles differing from the mayles
of the chayne, that by them the tierces and fourthes may be the better knowne.
And as for the Measurer, hee must haue three or foure foot length of chayne to
reserue vnto himselfe about his Spade, or in some little bagge of Leather, that so
vpon occasion (if need be) he may lengthen the chayne, or else helpe to make it
againe, if in case it should breake. In this figure or picture following you may

                           •
                        ee the shafts in a bundle by themselues, and the chayne gathered vp together
by it selfe.
                     
                        
                        
                     
                     The principall instrument for the Measurer well and assuredly to find out the
forme of the earth which he must measure (whether it be square, or somewhat long,
or of anie such other forme; for to iudge of and discerne the length and breadth
thereof; for to reduce all sorts of earth, and of whatsoeuer forme they be, into a
square; and to order and begin his measuring well) is the Squire, which is an instrument
made of yron, or molten mettall, or of common wood, or of Bra
                           •
                        ill, squared or
round, diuided iustly and equally into eight portions, hauing the forme of direct
lines, and those such fine and small ones, as possibly may be▪ for the thinner and finer
that they are, so much the surer they will be. This Squire must haue in the middest
a round, in manner of a ring, reasonably thicke, bored in the length thereof cle
                           •••
                        
through with eight holes, without which the said instrument would be altogether
vnprofitable. By those lights or holes the Measurer shall make his sight, by winking
on the one eye, to discerne the length and bredth, and all other forme of the grounds
which he must measure. There must also be on high, iust in the middest of the round
of this Squire, a hole, 
                           •
                        or to receiue the Measurers staffe, whereof wee will speake by
and by, that so it may beare vp the said Squire, and raise it on such a height as shall
be needfull for the Measurer to take the view and sight of the ground 
                           〈◊〉
                         and conueniently.
                     
                        
It will be good also, though not much necessarie, that there were a dyall set vpon
this round, to discerne the houres of the day, if need be, and to know in what part
the South standeth.
                     The staffe that beareth vp the Squire,The Geometricall staffe. is called the Geometricall staffe, which
must be of wood, verie straight, six foot long, or thereabout, and reasonably thicke,
so as it may well be carried and held in your hand, hauing the end downeward
sharpe and shod with a sharpe point of yron, made verie hard and thicke, or else of
Copper, and hauing a little hindge after the fashion of a vice aboue, and in the end
thereof a little hoope to receiue and hold fast the Squire set thereupon, that so it
may not moue, tremble, or shake with the wind, yea, though it be a great and violent
wind that bloweth, whiles the Geometrician is in performing his businesse.
The staffe must be marked out all along with lengths of feet, halfe feet, fourthes, and
tierces of poles.
                     In this present figure you may see the Squire and the Staffe, each of them by
themselues.
                     
                     The Geometrician must likewise haue in readinesse two sorts of writing-Tables:
The one of Slate, reasonably thicke, with a penne fastened to the same, at the end
of a little string; and it must be likewise of Slate, that so it may not cut the said Tables
too deepe in, when he writeth vp his accounts therein with it. The other little

paire of Tables shall be of Boxe, or other such like matter, like vnto those which are
brought out of Germanie, hauing a Copper penne, which the said Geomet
                           •
                        ician
shall vse for the setting downe in writing the lying, buttings, and contents of the said
peece of ground which he hath measured.
                     He must also haue two men: that is to say, one his assistant to goe before him, and
to carrie the end of the chayne, and to thrust downe into the earth the tenne or
twelue shafts: and the partie whose ground is measured, or some one for him, that
can lay and point out vnto the Geometrician the bounds and limits of the said
peece of ground, whether it be arable, wood, medow, or ani
                           •
                         other such like
place.
                  
                  
                     How and in what manner the Measurer of these grounds is to accomplish
and performe his worke.
                     THis Measurer of grounds (being thus suted with all the foresaid instruments seruing
for the measuring of ground, and hauing likewise the directions and assistance
of others, as hath beene said, to helpe him about his worke) must diligen
                           •
                        ly
enquire of the manner, fashion, and custome of measuring in that place, and of what
length his chayne must be, how manie poles are contained in an arpent in that countrey,
and how manie foot are to goe to euerie pole, seeing (as wee haue said before)
almost euerie countrey hath his seuerall measure: besides this, hee being well instructed
and taught in the boundings and limits of the peece of ground which hee
would measure, he must lay aside, or else (at the least) trusse vp his cloake verie close,
and place himselfe at one of the ends of the plot of ground, wood, or medow, hauing
his shafts, all of them, vnder his girdle on the left side, and his Squire hanging
by a little crooke at his girdle on the right 
                           •
                        ide: there pitch downe his Geometricall
staffe, making fit and fast his Squire vnto the end thereof, and to assigne, for his
more ease, the tenne shafts which hee had made fast vnto the left side at his girdle,
vnto that place whereas is fixed the little hindge: afterward stouping with his head,
to take his sight and view, by shutting the one eye, ouerthwart and within the holes
or lights of the said Squire, the forme; and first the length, by one side of the Squire;
afterward the breadth, by the other side of the said Squire (without stirring or mouing
of the Squire at all from out of his place from aboue the staffe) of the peece of
ground that hee would measure. It is true, that hee shall need neither staffe nor
Squire, if the peece of ground be square, or of a small compasse, because that without
any such Squire he shall be able to discerne the forme of the ground: and in such
cases hee shall onely vse the helpe of his shafts, which hee shall giue vnto his assistant,
and of the chayne, the one end whereof he shall hold himselfe, and giue the other
vnto his assistant, which shall goe before to sticke downe the shaf
                           •
                        s at each end of the
chayne, both of them herein applying themselues to the same purpose alike. The
assistant shall goe before, and first he shall hold in his left hand the tenne shafts altogether,
leauing the eleuenth with the Master-measurer, to fasten downe in the place
where he shall begin his measuring (if so be that the measurer doe not chuse rather,
in stead thereof, to vse his staffe:) the said assistant shall hold one of the ends of the
chayne by the ring with the great finger of his right hand, and that without ani
                           •
                        
want of roome for his finger to goe in, he shall fasten downe in the earth one of his
shafts (which his left hand shall haue reached him) with his right hand, at the end
of the chayne, as it is stretched forth at length: the said Master-measurer shall fullow
him, and shall take vp the shaft which his assistant hath set downe into the
earth: then the assistant shall proceed and goe on, alwaies carrying the chayne with
him, and fastening the end of the chayne which hee carrieth with one of his shafts
thrust downe into the earth, and this shaft the Master-measurer alwaies comming
after, shall take vp, and both of them shall continue and hold on this course, the one
to put downe the shafts, and the other to take them vp, vntill such time as the chiefe
measurer haue gathered to himselfe all the tenne or twelue shafts, which will be so

manie or so manie poles. This done, both of them shall goe vnto two other ends of
the said peece of ground, and shall doe in like manner as they did at the first: where
when as the measurer hath measured the length of one side, he shall measure the one
breadth, leauing the length of the other side, and the other breadth, hauing found
out by his Squire, that the peece of ground is square, if rather, for his owne assurance,
and contentment of the owner, he thinke it not meet to measure the two lengths by
themselues, and the two widenesses by themselues. Whereupon it will come to
passe, that if the peece of ground or wood (for an example) conta
                           •
                        ne from the one
end to the other, on all sides, tenne poles, multiplying the one side by the other, that
is to say, tenne by tenne, they shall haue the totall summe of the poles of the Square,
which will be a hundred poles, which is one a
                           •
                        pent: and so hereupon the measurer
shall conclude, that the place doth containe an arpent. Againe, if in case that the
place were of greater breadth and length than tenne poles square, they shall hold on
their measuring, and passe from one end to the other, accounting that which shall be
more, still reducing all that they measure into hundreds of poles, and so into arpents.
See here the easie way for the measuring of Land, Woods, and other places of small
compasse and square, wherein there is no great need of anie Squire: but and if the
pe
                           •
                        ce of Land, Wood, or other such place be of great compasse and contents, and
yet notwithstanding lying straight on euerie side, as of fiue or sixe hundred arpents,
or more, it will stand the measurer vpon to vse the helpe of his Squire: wherefore
hee shall pitch downe his Geometricall staffe at one of the ends of the said
peece, and shall set his Squire to the top of the end of his staffe, and shall view
the other end of the ground through the holes or lights of the said Squire, if his
sight and largenesse of the place will permit him: which if it will not, then onely
so farre at that time as his sight may bee con
                           ••
                        ied: vnto which place directly, whither
the direct line of the squire doth looke, hee shall send his assistant, or some other
man, to pitch downe a diameter, that is to say, a stake or pole, or some other certaine
marke, so farre off, as that the said measurer may see it at that end of the peece where
he is taking his sight: or else many diameters in many places, alwaies directly beholding
the first diameter, if in case the peece of ground should be of longer distance,
so as that one, two, or three diameters alone would not be sufficient, as those which
the said measurer should not be able easily to see and discerne. The diameters, one
or many, being thus pight, they will serue to helpe the measurer better and more easily
to measure the peece, being thereby as it were diuided into many equall portions.

measuring of it.
                     BVt as all grounds are not of one forme and fashion; so is it not possible that one
manner of measuring should serue to find out the quantitie of euerie peece: and
therefore to speake generally, all places and grounds are either square or longer than
they be broad, and then they are called somewhat longer than broad: but stretching
right out, or vnequall both in length and bredth, and then they be called somewhat
long, and ending like a horne, or in the forme of a vvedge, that is to say, alike long,
but of an vnequall bredth; or of an equall triangle, or of an vnequall triangle; or
round, or halfe round, or of the fashion of a bow, or consisting of many corners, or of
many fashions mixt together, or they are inclosed one within another: for the

of square is verie easie as vve haue said, that is to say, like number of poles on euerie
side, which consisteth of tenne poles to a French arpent, which number being
multiplied vvith it selfe, which is ten by ten, make the whole summe of poles, whereof
an arpent consisteth, vvhich are a hundred poles, and euerie pole consisting of
eighteene foot.

                        ay foure times fiue

a hundred poles, and so by consequent an arpent, at a hundred poles to an arpent,
and eighteene foot to a pole, and so in like manner as the length is more or lesse.
Likewise the bredth being lesse or greater, that the number of the length and bredth
be multiplied together, whether it be lesse or amount to more than an arpent, he shall
make his accounts and reckoning to fall proportionably, according to the greater or
lesse number of poles, as well of the length as of the bredth: as for example, if the
measurer haue found in the length of a ground seuen and thirtie poles and a halfe, and
in bredth one pole, he shall multiplie thirtie seuen poles and a halfe by one, and shall
say that this ground containeth thirtie seuen poles and a halfe, which is a quarter and
a halfe of an arpent, at a hundred poles to an arpent, and eighteene foot to euerie
pole: by the same meanes, if the ground be seuenteene pole long, and two pole and
sixe foot broad, in multiplying seuenteene pole by two pole and sixe foot, he shal find
a quarter and a halfe, two pole, three foot of an arpent: after a hundred pole to an arpent,
and eighteene foot to a pole.

must remember, or for your better remembrance set downe in writing tables, the vnequall
numbers of the two sides, as also those of the two ends, and afterward to reduce
the two vnequall lengths, as also the bredths, into an equalitie, in the end multiplying
the equall length by the bredth likewise made equall: as for example, if one of
the broad ends of the said ground doe containe foure poles, and the other two poles
onely, and the one of the sides of length containe sixteene poles, and the other tenne
poles, to bring and reduce the thing into a square, you must take of the two poles
by vvhich one of the broad ends is broader than the other, the halfe, that is to say,
one pole, and put it to the two poles of the other end, and thus each end will contain
his three poles a peece equally. And of the sixe poles wherein the one of the sides
doth exceed the other in length, to take also the halfe which is three pole, and to
put them to the tenne, so each of the sides vvill be thirteene pole a peec

said) vvhich is three pole, for to multiplie one length (made equall likewise
with the other as we haue said) which is thirteene pole, and to account that three
times thirteene are thirtie nine: so there will be thirtie nine pole, which make a quarter
and a halfe, one pole and a halfe, of an arpent, according to a hundred pole to an
arpent, and eighteene foot to euerie pole: so then you must follow this rule in euerie

both sides, but hauing one end broader than another; as for example, twentie pole
long, and seuen pole broad at the one end, and but three at the other: then you must
gather the two breadths together, which will make tenne pole: to take the halfe of
them, will be fiue, to multiplie the length withall, in the doing whereof you must
count fiue times twentie, and the summe will rise in all to a hundred pole, which

make one arpent, after the rate of a hundred pole to an arpent, and eighteene
foot to euerie pole. This is your direct course to measure ground fashioned like

and Aprill following: it would be plowed but once for Pease or Beanes, that is at
plow-day, then suffered to lye for bait till mid Februarie, then sowne without any
more plowing, and but onely harrowed: for Oats or Rye it is no great friend, yet
vvill beare both by carefull husbandrie, Rye in the same sort that it doth Wheat,
and Oats, as it doth Barley. Now for the blew clay, the clay like marle, or the marle
it selfe, they are not fully so rich as the blacke mould, and therefore will endure to
be manured at all times vvhen your leasure vvill serue, they must be plowed in the
same manner, at the same times, and for the same seeds as you plow the blacke clay,
and are also no friends to Rie or Oats: for the simple sands, they are by no meanes
verie fruitfull for corne, but onely bring forth their increase by great labour and trauell;
they seldome beare Wheat, especially the red or yellow sand, except they
lye neere to the Sea coast, or else haue some other mixture. The corne in which
they most joy is Rye, and they must be plowed foure times for it; that is fallowed
in Ianuarie, Summer-stirred in Aprill; foyled in Iune, and sowne at Michaelmas.
for Barley it must be plowed sixe times, as fallowed, Summer-stirred, and foyled as

aforesaid, then Winter-rigged at Michaelmas, cast downe in Februarie, and sowne
in May; and to speake more generally, these barren, hot, loose earths, vvould seldome
lye still, but plowed as oft as leasure vvill giue you leaue; as for beanes or pease they
neuer beare any; but for Tare, Fetches and Lupines they vvill beare them, vvith once
plowing, vvhich is onely vvhen they are sowne about Aprill. These soyles must
be vvonderfully vvell manured, for longer than they haue much heart thereof, they
vvill beare no corne at all. Lastly, the grauelly ground of vvhat mixture soeuer it be,
is somewhat better for Wheat than these sands, yet Rie is his chiefe seed, and it must
in all things be vsed like the sand ground, and vvill beare Wheat vvith the same
husbandrie that it beares Rie. Now for the compound or binding earths, they are
fertile and barren, according to their mixture, as vvhen the richest clay is mixt with
the richest sand, as namely, the blacke clay vvith the red sand, it is then held to be a
good ground; so likewise vvhen the vvorst clay is mixt vvith the vvorst sand, as the
blew or gray clay vvith the sand vvhich is like dust, then it is held for a verie barren
ground, and so consequently of all the rest: and as of these clayes and sands, so also
of clayes themselues, as vvhen a blacke clay is mixt with a blew clay, or a marle
vvith a gray clay: and so of sands, as vvhen the red is mixt vvith the vvhite, the yellow
vvith blacke, or any of all with the grauell: vvherein you shall note, that how
much the good soyle is more or lesse than the bad, so much it is more or lesse fertile.
Now for the tillage of them, all sands mixt vvith clayes, or clayes vvith clayes, vvill
beare any graine, as Wheat, Rie, Maslin, Barley, Oats, or Pease, being husbanded
vvell, and throughly manured, onely they must be plowed in such sort as you plow
your sands: but sands vvhich are mixt, vvill beare onely Rie, or small pulse, and
plowed like the rest beforesaid: to conclude, all clayes naturally are cold and moist,
and all sands hot and drie, and the mixed soyles more or lesse according to the mixture
thereof.

                     NOw if you desire that your Corne-grounds should be faire to sight, make
a goodly shew, be easie to be tilled, and beare plentifully, part them
into many peeces cast foure square, and let neuer a one of them exceed
in the length of fortie poles, nor yet be lesse than thirtie or fiue and
twentie: and, if the inconuenientnesse of the place vvill not suffer you to cast them
into squares, then make them somewhat more long, but yet not exceeding the foresaid
fortie poles in length: for besides infinite other commodities and pleasures accompanying
short fields, and such as are not of large reach, this is one verie speciall
profit, namely, that oxen and horses doe labour there vvith lesse trauell and vvearisomnesse,
in as much as they do not onely cheere vp themselues, and take their breath
being at the end of the furrow, but also for that the plow-man cleanseth and freeth
his plow of the earth vvherewith it is woont to be laden, as then also carrying them
about to enter vpon a new furrow: cause your ground if possibly it may be, to lie leuell
and euen; for besides the pleasure of seeing from the one end to the other, they
vvill also be the more easie to be plowed, dunged, and sowne: let them be ditched
round about, or at the least on the sides, as well to draine away raine-vvater, or other if
any should stand there, as for to cut off the trade-waies of passengers. Plant not within
not about your Corne-grounds any trees, for feare of the shadow, knowing assuredly
that the more that corne is shadowed, the further off it is from being comforted
and rejoyced by the Sunne, as also from hauing the dust (which is vvoont to lye
much vpon it) blowne off by the vvinds, and likewise from being deliuered from

snow, fogges, and tempests, o

seed that is sowne.
                  And no lesse than these the Ashe is most poysonous vnto Corne-grounds,Ashe is hurtful to Corne. for how
farre soeuer his shadow extendeth, so farre you shall see the ground euer forbeare to
prosper, and yet it is not vtterly vnnecessarie to haue trees grow about your Cornefields;
for if you plant Fruit trees about them, as the Apple, Peare, Ceruise, and
such like, you shall find the profit many times double the injuries that are reaped
from them: neither is it forcibly necessarie that your fields should be cast into these
small square grounds, seeing you may haue them as large as you please, according
to the quantitie of your Farme, or the nature thereof, vvhich may as well lye publique
and in common amongst your neighbours, as priuate and seuerall to your selfe,

or casualtie to any superfluitie of moisture, this ground you may lay leuell,
smooth, and plaine, and make it appeare as an entire garden, or one land, but if it
be within any daunger of vvater, or subject to a spewing and moist qualitie; then
you shall lay your lands high, raising vp ridges in the middest, and

by meanes of the too much moisture, be subject to much binding, then you shall
make the lands a great deale lesse, laying euerie foure or fiue furrowes round like a
land, and making a hollownesse betweene them, so that the earth may be light and
drie: and this you must doe either vpon leuells, or vpon descending and hanging
grounds; and to conclude, the larger your fields are, and the drier they are kept, the
better they will be, and the better your corne vvill prosper vpon them.

forgetting of cockle and darnell, and that which is called rest-harrow, or at the least
some fumitorie and henbane; yet it will be doing of some thing more: as namely,
those which grow out of it of themselues,Weeds shew what manner of ground it is wherein they grow. as stinking mathweed, kexes, rupture-wort
(these be reclaimed grounds) and the herbe called Chamepytis, as I haue sometimes
seene in those countries which properly and truely containe France. For the distinguishing
of these herbes, the thistles shew the heat of the ground, as their aromaticall
and odoriferous roots may testifie: the hemlocke, vvild smallage, and fumitorie grow
of putrefaction: the bind-weed, both great and small, do proceed partly of drinesse,
partly of the alteration of the humour: night-shade the great and small doe spring
vp of the cold part of the earth, vvhich they draw from the humour thereof: mercurie
of both sorts, eye-bright also of two or three differing flowers, the small sorrell
red vnderneath, and the three sorts of plantaine do hold of cold or temperate ground:

vvater-parsley haue differing natures, and are more hot, according to the humo

make shew to be more standing tenants, than veruaine, or male knot-grasse, for they
will not away, except the plow and culture (their tyrannous commaunders) doe
come. To conclude, these later hearbes being cut and rooted out by oft and deepe
plowing, must afterward (especially the thistles) be thwacked and beaten small before
the first raine, that so there may nothing of them (yea, no more than of an Adder)
remaine aliue to breed or increase any thing againe: for their nature is, so soone
as they receiue a little moisture, to fasten and claspe themselues so close to the slime of
the earth, as that they vvill thereby againe so enter new possession, that within a short
time after they vvill become strong ynough to strangle their mother.The first

the manner of the first earing, to

done without laying it in furrowes:The third. and the third earing, is to plow it for seed time,

And lastly, to mow and lay it bare and naked, to sheare or cut it downe, to sheaue it
and to gather it in. And albeit I here stand much vpon the cleansing of grounds
from stones, which is a verie good husbandrie, and for which by a generall consent
whole lordships and towneships will joyne together, and make (as they terme them
in diuers countries) common daies for common works, yet you must vnderstand that
all soyles are not to be cleansed from stones, but only the clayes and sands which haue
no generall mixture with stones, but as one would say, here a stone and there a stone
scattered seuerally,Stones of greats vs

of one equall mixture, not abounding more in the one than the other, there to take away
the stones were to impouerish the ground, and make it bare and vndesensible
both against the wind, heat, and cold, as thus, vvhere stones are mixed equally vvith
light sands there they keepe the sand firme about the rootes of the Corne, vvhich,
should they be taken away, the vvind vvould blow the sand away from the corne,
and leaue it drie and bare, by vvhich meanes it vvould neuer sprout; or in those
hillie countries where the reflection of the Sunne is verie hot, and the earth light, if
the stones being generally mixt should be taken away, that violent heat vvould so
scortch and burne the corne, that it vvould seldome or neuer sprout, or neuer prosper:
and againe where the countrie is most cold, and most subject to the bitternesse of

frosts, there this equall mixture of stones, taking a heat from the Sunne, giues such a
warmth to the corne that it prospereth a great deale better, and sooner than otherwise
it would: for vvhich cause, stones are many times held amongst Husbandmen
to be an excellent manure for arable land, so that I conclude, though in

                        erse sorts.
and varieth the oftest according to the variation of climats, I vvill here giue
you a little touch of the seuerall plows for euerie seuerall soyle; and first to speake of
the composition of plows, it consisteth vpon the beame, the skeath, the head, the hales
the spindles, the rest, the shelboard, the plow-foot, the culture, and the share; then the
slipe to keepe the plow from wearing, and the arker-staffe to cleanse the plow when
it shall be loaden vvith earth or other vild matter. The plow vvhich is most proper
for the stiffe blacke clay, would be long, large, and broad, vvith a deepe head, and a
square shelboard, so as it may turne vp a great furrow, the culture vvould be long and
little or nothing bending, and the share would haue a verie large wing; as for the foot
it vvould be long and broad, &amp; so set as it may giue vvay to a-great furrow. The plow
for the vvhite, blew, or gray clay, vvould not be so large as that for the blacke clay,
onely it vvould be somewhat broader in the britch; it hath most commonly but one
hale, and that belonging to the left hand, yet it may haue two at your pleasure, the culture
vvould be long, and bending, and the share narrow, vvith a vving comming vp
to arme and defend the shelboard from vvearing. The plow for the red sand,, would
be lesse than any before spoken of, more light and more nimble; the culture would
be made circular, or much bending like that for the white clay, yet much thinner, and
the share vvould be made as it were with a halfe vving, neither so large as that for the
black clay, nor so narrow as that for the white clay, but in a meane between both. The
plow for the white sand differs nothing from that of the red sand, only it oft hath one
addition more, that is, at the further end of the beame there is a paire of round wheeles

which bearing the beame, vpon a loose mouing axle-tree, being just the length of
two furrowes and no more, doth so certainely guide the plow to his true furrow
that it can neuer loose land by swa
                        ••
                     ing, nor take too much land by the greedinesse
of the yrons: the culture and share for this plow are like those for the red sand,
onely they are a little lesse, the culture being not fully so long, nor so much bent,
nor the share so broad, but a little sharper pointed, and this plow also serueth for the
grauell howsoeuer mixt, whether with peeble, flint or otherwise. The plow for
blacke clay mixt with red sand, and the white clay mixt with white sand, would be
made of a middle size betwixt that for the blacke clay, and that for the red sand, being
not so huge as the first, nor so slender as the later, but of a meane and competent
greatnesse; and so also the culture and share must be made answerable, neither so
bigge and streight as the greatest, nor so sharpe and long as the smallest. Lastly, the
blacke clay mixt with white sand, and the white clay mixt with red sand, would
haue a plow in all points like that for the red sand simple, onely the culture would be
more sharpe, long, and bending, and the share so narrow, sharpe, and small, that it
should be like a round pike, onely bigge at the setting on.
                  Thus you see the diuersitie of plowes, and how they serue for euerie seuerall soyle:
now it is meet to know the implements belonging to their draught, vvhich if it be
Oxen, then there is but the plow cl

it be Horse, then they are two-fold, as single or double; single, as vvhen they draw
in length one horse after another, and then there is needfull but the plow cleuise, and
swingle-tree, treates, collers, harnesse, and cart bridles; or double, when they draw
two and two together in the beare geares, and then there is needfull the plow, cleuise,
and teame, the toastred, the swingle-trees, the treates, the harnesse, the collars,
the round withs, or bearing geares, bellie-bands, backe-bands, and bridles. Also,
there be of harrowes two kinds, one vvith vvoodden teeth, the other vvith yron
teeth: the vvoodden are for all simple clayes, or such as easily breake, and the yron
for sands, mixt grounds, or any binding earth, and for new broken swarthes, or such
earths as are subject to weeds, or quicke growth: for sleighting tooles, the barke-harrowes
vvill serue loose grounds, and the roller those vvhich bind.

thing, for to spare cost and charges, may be done by little Iackboyes and girles,
which with their hands stouping downe, and filling Maunds and little Baskets,
may carrie them into the middest of the high wayes, and into the furrowes and
rupts of Carts, or else vnto the end of euerie land, there casting them in some vnprofitable
place. And if this worke be done in the height of the Spring, or in the
Summer season, it will not be amisse, because it will be much better, and easier
treading vpon the lands, and the ardors of the field being then new, the stones
will be a great deale the better perceiued: or if this labour be done at the fall of
the leafe, it will not be amisse, because it is both the time of the last ardor, and

when the field should be best cleansed, as also the fittest time to mend and repaire the
high waies against Winter. The vvorke is so needfull, as that if the field be not
cleansed from stones, though otherwise it should be duely and orderly plowed,
though otherwise it were fat and fruitfull of his owne nature, yet vvould it beare lesse
than any other peece of ground: and on the contrarie, how leane soeuer it be, if yet
it be cleane vvithall and freed from stones, it will not let to bring forth in good and
plentifull sort. Sometimes before the gathering of the stones off, some vse to vveed

the first breaking vp of the same. The stubble is to be taken away and rid from
off the ground where wheat, or other corne, or oats or other graine haue growne, so
soone as the corne it selfe is shorne and cut downe.
                  And these weeds and quickes which grow vpon the arable lands,To destroy weeds. would be torne
vp by the roots vvith a sharpe harrow, or as some husbandmen vse, pluckt vp by the
roots with a paire of vvoodden nippers made for the purpose, and this would be
done in the Sommer time after euerie great shower of raine, for so they are vtterly
destroyed, vvhereas the cutting them vp by the ground doth but abate them for a
vvhile, and makes them after spring a great deale the faster: now for to destroy
those smaller roots of vveeds, vvhich lye hidden in the ground, and are vnperceiuable
till they doe mischiefe, you shall strike into your plow-rest many sharpe
dragges, or crooked peeces of yron, most directly vnderneath and looking into the
earth; and then in plowing of your grounds, where you spie a vveed before your
plow, there clap downe your rest vpon it, and it will forthwith teare it vp by the
roots, and in one arder or two you shall make your ground as cleare of weedes as is
possible: for I must needs discommend that manne

                      of vveeding (how generally soeuer
it be receiued) vvhich is vsed after the corne is spindled, for though it taketh away
the weed from the eye, yet it so bruiseth and breaketh downe the corne, that the
discommoditie doubleth and trebleth the profit, neither can the weed slay more
corne than the feet of the vveeder: vvherefore I vvould wish, vvhen extremitie
vrges a man to vveed at these ill seasons, that he by no meanes step out of the furrow,
or striue to cut vp more weeds than he can reach without hurting the corne
thereby.

                  That the second or next dutie to be performed to the ground
is to enrich it by manuring it: that so of a leane
ground, it may become fruitfull.
                  
                     BVt all grounds vvhich are appointed for seed or corne ground, whether
they be such as are new broken vp, or such as haue oftentimes alreadie
borne corne, must be enriched and repaired by manure in the beginning
of Winter about the eighteeenth of Nouember, or the beginning
of December, vvith Sheepes dung that is three yeares old, or else vvith
Cow and Horse-dung mingled together,What manner of dung must be vsed. for the helping of it to a temperate heat▪
or vvith other manure such as the soyle affoords, or the Farmers yard can breed,
and yet although I speake thus of Nouember and December, being a time much
vsed vvith vs in France, where the vvaies are faire, the journey little, and the labour
easie, yet you shall know that you may leade your manure either in the Spring, or
in Sommer at all such vacant seasons vvhen you cannot follow more necessarie labour,
at when by vvet or other vveather you cannot lead your hay or corne, then
you may lead your manure: for albeit husbandmen hold, that the later you lead your
manure, the better, yet it is not good to driue so long, for feare of preuention, but to

take anie fit time or leisure that is offered you through the whole yeare. The dung is
to be laid on in hills, little lumpes, or heapes, and that along as you meane to cast vp
your furrowes in plowing, and after to spread it in his season, whether it be rotten
dung, or marle. And it shall chiefely be done in Winter, that so the raine and snow

receiued from the beasts houses, as being there scattered, it yeeldeth for his first fruits

they continue and hold it from father to sonne as a receiued veritie, That
nothing is more deare and precious than dung,Nothing more deare than dung. taken in his season, for the enriching
of ground.
                  Some take dung as it were hot and halfe rotten at the end of their field; but that
doth much harme: because such dung not being ouercome of the snow, raine, and
other helpes of the heauens, but remaining crude or raw, doth likewise ramaine vnprofitable,
especially the first yeare, doing nothing it selfe, and keeping the better
fruit from profiting and comming on as it would; though the second yeare it may
helpe well, and hinder nothing.
                  It is true, that if you would enrich a poore field,The diuersitie of manure. that it is better done by the dung
newly gathered out of the beasts houses, than with such as is old: and it would bee
spread in the new of the Moone, a little before the seed be sowne, prouided yet, that
it be then plowed and turned vnder the earth. They seeme vnto me not to doe worst,St

who hauing gathered their corne in August or September, and cut it somewhat
high, doe burne the stubble and other weedes which are in the fields, whereby they
make a manner of dunging of it by the helpe of raine falling thereupon. This standeth
in stead of the first sort of enriching of their ground, especially in barren and
sandie grounds, and such as stand vpon a cold moistish clay, or such as haue a strong
new broken vp ground. True it is, that they doe not this yearely, because of their
need to couer their houses, and of hauing litter for their beasts. And yet those may
seeme vnto me to be lesse deceiued, who hauing left their stubble long and high, in
the shearing and cutting of it downe, doe presently thereupon bestow an earing vpon
such ground, and so vnderturne the said stubble and weedes, there to let them rot
with the Winter raine.
                  There is nothing so good as the first manuring and dunging of the ground,The first

                     hes for kind and naturall ones. It is true, that the first is not sufficient of it
selfe for to dung and enrich the earth sufficiently, and to make fruitfull those that are
barren and leane: but there must be other meanes vsed for to effect such a worke:
and amongst them all, that seemeth vnto me the principall, which is the letting of
the field to lye a yeare or two vnoccupied, not ceasing the while to husband it both
Winter and Summer: as also the first time when you would haue it beare, to sow it
with Lupines, or rather with Pease, prouided that the ground be not ouer-cold, for
then it would profit those Pulse but a little. And if all these meanes should fall out to
be insufficient, it will be good to spread Quicklime vpon the plowed ground in the
end of Februarie: for besides that it enricheth a ground greatly, it cleanseth it also,
and killeth all bad and dangerous weedes: whereupon it commeth to passe, that the
haruest after it is more plentifull, than after anie other dung that a man can inuent to
vse. Furthermore, if the ground be light, it will be good to cause some water to

ouerflow the corne for the space of ten daies or thereabout, which will likewise stand
in stead of a manuring or dunging.
                  The dung or marle is to be spred in the increase of the Moone,To spread dung. about the eighteenth
of Nouember, after such time as the rested ground hath passed his time of recreation:
but if it bee in such grounds as wherein the chiefest kindes of corne are to bee sowne,
then they must be dunged presently after the end of Autumne, that so the ground may
haue leasure to receiue the raine therewithall▪ which will serue to help the seedes the
better to rot, thereby prouiding an aid for the weakenes of the earth. In like sort, if
this should be for Rie, or for Messing, the ground would be dunged in the heart of
Winter, or a little before, notwithstanding that some doe stay for the moneth of
March, that it may presently after receiue the showers of Aprill, which may do much
good towards the later end of September, at which time they sowe in fine dust, and
windie drowthes, looking for the first raine, and the pu
                        •
                     rifaction to be wrought by
the same. But howsoeuer the case standeth, seeing it is better to manure the ground,
than not to manure it;How it is naught to dung a ground too much. so it is better to dung it oft, than much at once: for as a field
starueth, if it be not dunged at all, so it burneth if it be ouer-dunged: in consideration
whereof, the ground must be well weighed; for a good ground hath no such need
to be dunged as a leane ground. The moist field would be much more dunged: for
seeing it is frosen continually by reason of his moisture, it commeth to passe that the
dung by his heat doth resolue and thaw thesame againe. The drie ground requireth
lesse, because it is hot ynough of it selfe by reason of his drinesse: and if you should
bestow great store of dung vpon it, it might be a cause to make it burnt. Againe,
your exceeding rich and stiffe clayes desire little or no manure at all, because it is
so rich and fat of it selfe, that hauing anie more addition, it presently mildeweth the
corne, and makes the kernell thereof as blacke as soot: and therefore the good Husbandman
sayth, That the manure which is best for these rich soyles, is good plowing
in due time, and ripening the mould.
                  There must likewise consideration be had of the goodnesse of the dung: for good
dung would lye fast and close together for a season,To put dung close together. and rest it selfe a yeare: if it be
elder,The diuersitie of dung. it is so much the worse. The Pigeons dung is the best of all: and next thereto
is mans dung, especially if it be mixt with the other filth and sweepings of the
house: for of it owne nature it is verie hot. Next vnto this is Asses dung, which is
the best of all beasts dung, because this beast doth chew and eat his meat with great
leysure, and digesteth it best, and thereupon also maketh a dung most prepared and
fitted to be put presently into the earth. Next vnto this is the dung of Sheepe: then
that of Goats: and alike of all others, as Horses, Mares, Oxen, and Kine. The worst
of all is Swines dung, by reason of his great heat, for therewith it presently burneth
the earth. For want of dung, the stalkes of Lupines cut downe, haue the force and
efficacie of very good dung: or else to sow Lupines on Corne-ground which is leane,
and after that they be come vp, to put them into the earth againe, turning it
ouer them.
                  There are manie Farmes of which one can keepe neither bird nor beast to make
dung of: and yet the painefull Farmer, in this scarcitie of manure, may make some
of the leaues of Trees and Thornes, and dyrt, or parings of the earth gathered out
of the streetes: hee may also take Ferne, and mingle them with the filth and myre of
the vtter court: or make a deepe pit, and gather into it ashes, stubble▪ and stumps of
hay or straw, the dyrt hanging about spouts, and all other manner of filth that may be
scraped and raked together in paring or sweeping the house, or else howsoeuer. And
in the midst of this ditch you must set a piece of wood of Oake to keepe away Adders
and Snakes, that they come not to breed or abide there. If you haue no other but
arable grounds, they will not need, that you should diuide your dung into diuers sorts:
but and if you haue Vineyards, Medowes, and Corne-ground, you must lay euerie
sort of dung by it selfe, as that which is of Goats and birds must be stirred euerie summer,
as if you would digge it with Pick-axes or Spades, to the end it may not the sooner,
and be better for the ground.
                  
                     
The cleansing of Ponds, Ditches, or standing Lakes, is a compasse or manure not
inferior to anie before spoken of: and Marle may haue preheminence before all, in as
much as the best before named doth not last aboue foure yeares at the most;Soyle of Ponds or Ditches. and
some but two; and some but one: yet Marle will keepe the ground rich twentie
yeares, and better. All sorts of ashes, either of Wood or Coale, is a good manure,
chiefely for ground that is apt to chap or riue: So is also Lyme, or Chalke, especially
for cold soyles; yet your Lyme would be scattered verie thinne vpon the same,
and your Chalke layd in greater aboundance. Also Sea-sand is a verie good kind
of manure, and both fasteneth a loose mould, and also maketh it a great deale
more fertile.

                  That the ground must be plowed ouer according to his three
earings before that it be sowne.
                  
                     IN tilling and husbanding the earth as it should be, there are three things
chiefely required: first, a Husbandman, furnished with a good vnderstanding
and ripe iudgement: secondly, Cattell fitted for the worke:
and thirdly, a Plough well appointed and made. But of all other things,
it is verie requisite, that the Husbandman doe know the nature and condition of
the earth which he vndertaketh to till, thereof to reape fruit and commoditie, that
so accordingly he may stirre it, and giue it as manie earings as the nature thereof
doth require. For in fields which are of a good ground vnderneath, he must set his
culter and plough so deepe therein, as that the better and fatter earth which is vnderneath,
may be turned aboue: whereas to take the same course in a ground that
is barren and leane vnderneath, were altogether vnprofitable. In like manner,
there are manie fields, which the more that they are eared and plowed, they become
so much the more leaner and barrenner: and such are those which haue a

                        •
                     light mould, which the oftener they are plowed in the time of heat, so much the
more they are pierced of the Sunne, and so become the weaker and lesse able to

                  It is true indeed, that there are not manie sorts of grounds, but by oft earing

                        •

                      make it soft for after-plowing, not turning vp much earth with the plough, nor
piercing deepe into the earth this first time, but cutting it in such sort, as that the

                        •
                     urrowes may be so neere together one vnto the other, as that a man shall hardly

                        •

                  But you must vnderstand, that according to the situation of the grounds that are
good for Corne or Pulse, as also according to the Countrey, mould, and heartinesse

                        •
                     hereof, it is vsed to varie and alter the plowing and tilling of the ground, for the

                        •
                     urther benefit of the inhabitants: for at Brie, where they haue a slipperie and moist

                        •
                     round, fit to make pots of for necessarie businesse, they plow vpon a causey, and as

it were vpon an Asses backe: and in euerie fiue furrowes they hold it meete to
cast one high ridge, that is verie large, and made also like vnto a ca
                        •
                     sey, that it
may both receiue the raine water, and that which springeth out of the earth,
which is alwayes moist, and that because of two Riuers lying vpon the one side
and on the other, and doe moisten and water the grounds there continually vnderneath.
                  And for the same purpose (which is also practised in small Beaux, as in Longboyau,
Val de Gallie, Val-boyau, Niuernois, and Bourbonnois) they make at the
end of their ground certaine rises of sufficient height: where, betwixt the said rise
and arable ground, there is a ditch or pit made within it, after the fashion of a
long fatt, to receiue the waters which runne along after great raine: for otherwise
they would rot and smother the corne. This troubleth such as trauell those countries,
exceedingly: and this is the cause of the name, whereby they are called the
Grashoppers of Brie: Insomuch, as that they cannot tell how to doe so well, as in
a rainie day to goe and pull vp Darnell, Dane-wort, and other ouer-spreading
weedes (which else they could hardly ouercome) being a kind of earing of the
ground, called of auncient Writers the freeing of Corne-ground from weedes: hauing
further, by such aboundance of raine, this scath done vnto their Come, as that
it is layd bare now and then, yea, and that though it be neuer so well harrowed, and
the earth of it selfe strong and mightie.
                  There is no need of anie such rises or ditches in the parts of France, truly and
properly so called, neither in the Isle thereof, nor in the flat and free Countrey of
Blairie, as Long-boyau and Labea
                        •
                     ce (the verie Barne and Store-house of France)
the Countries of Oye, Sangterre, or else of Berry and free Poictou. And all grauellie
Countries may be well excused and freed from all manner of such inconuenience, as
appeareth by manie places of Picardie and Solongne, euen vnto Percheron: so that
they make their furrowes close and neere one to another, as is wont to be done in low
grounds and valleyes.
                  The ground must also be plowed in a fit and conuenient time, to the end that it
may become fruitfull: Wherefore the carefull Husbandman shall neuer plow his
ground whiles it is wet; for running through it with the plough at that time, it
will doe nothing but runne vpon heapes, especially in tough and clammie grounds,
as also in those which be hard, or growing and putting forth their fruit, in as much
as this maketh them so sad and close, that it is impossible to make them fine and
small mould againe. Likewise, it is an absurd thing euer to goe about to put the
plough into a dyrtie and myrie ground, because it is nothing fit to stirre or deale anie
manner of way withall, before it become drie, and so vnfit, as that though you
could doe what you would vnto it with the plough, yet there is no casting of anie
seed into it.
                  And if it should fall out, that there were anie Tree or Vin

from the rootes, at all times when you perceiue your selfe to be vpon them: or 
                        〈◊〉
                     
you shall cut them off with a hatchet, rather than bruise and breake them with the

                        •
                     attell vsed to plow withall, doe differ according to the
manner and custome of the Countries.
                  
                     IN rough and tough grounds,Plowing with Horse. as also in free and kindly grounds (as hath
been said) where there are required as needfull three Horses to a plough
of fiftie foot (but not so coupled and spanged, as they be in Countries
where they vse to plow with Mares, Oxen, Asses, or Buffles) you must,
after the first caring, breake the clods with the rowler, and lay it flat, square, and
plaine, with a planke. In leane, grauellie, and weaker grounds, you shall not stand in
need to be at such cost either with horse or man; for it is not requisite that you should
draw so deepe a draught in the earth: and againe, the husbandmen of such Countries
haue sooner finished and made an end than others, and yet doe labour with more leisure,
because of the ayre and climate of their Countrey. Yet this is but a particular fashion
in France:Horses &amp; Oxen of France. therefore to speak more generally, both according to that and other
forraine soyles, you shall vnderstand, that there be two principall causes to make a
man plow with Horses, although he may haue Oxen at his pleasure: The one is, when
he liueth in a verie wet and dyrtie soyle, where the ground of it selfe yeeldeth forth
such a continuall moisture, that the finallest trampling or treading thereupon bringeth
it to a verie myre; in this case it is best to plow with Horse, because they draw euer directly
one after the other, and tread euer in the furrow, without annoying the land,
and goe also much more light and nimbly than other cattell; whereas Oxen going
double, and treading vpon the land, would foyle it, and make it so myrie, that it
would be good for no purpose: The other, when a man liueth farre from his necessarie
accommodations, as from his fuell, his fencing, his timber, and other such like
necessaries, which he must forcibly vse euerie yeare; in this case he must euer keepe
his teame of Horses, because they are fittest for trauell and long iournies, doing them
euer with the greatest speed and least losse: whereas the Oxe, being a heauie beast,
would soone surfet, and are indeed so vnapt for the same, that a man can hardly doe
them greater iniurie. Now for the number of Horses to be vsed in the plow, it must
be according to the greatnesse of the labour, and the strength of the cattell: for in the
heauie and stiffe clayes, sixe are euer few ynough, either to fallow with, or to plow the
Pease-earth with; and f

at all times, and three vpon anie necessitie. As for the mixt soyles, if they be binding,
they will craue as much strength as the clayes: but if they be loose, the same that
serues the light sands will serue them also. And herein is to be noted, that the stoned

with the young Mule, and in Romaine and Champaigne in Italie with the Buffle:
whereas, of a truth, the labour of Oxen is not readie, nor so quicke of dispatch in the
time of necessitie; and for to remedie and helpe this mischiefe, you must begin your
worke with the Oxen sooner, and haue a greater number of them than of Horse. The
prouision of Oxen is of lesse charges for diet, buying and selling againe: whereunto
you may adde, that you may eat the Oxe, or sell him againe, after you haue had his labour
a certaine time. True it is, that he that hath wrought all the morning, must rest
the afternoone; and the Oxen going earlier to plough, returne earlier from labor than
the Horse. The greatest commoditie comming by them, is, that they better endure the
vnseasonablenesse of times, and in sturdie and stiffe ground they draw a deeper
draught, and acquite themselues in the worke with more commendation: againe, they

Tabie, Calabrie, Sicile, and in the countrie of Iaffle, being all of them countries where
they grow great and faire: for they endure more labor, and are not subiect to so many
diseases, neither are they so costly to feed. True it is, that they do not so much, neither
yet altogether so well: wherefore they are better to be vsed in leane grounds; except
the yong Mule of Auuergne, which exceedeth all other beasts: but he is troublesome,
hard to be brought to draw, and so brainsick, as that there is not the yong Mule which
hath not his madding fit, and vexeth his master now and then: where

                        und. verie diligently
to breake and take away clods, and to make the ground plaine
and euen, for the better sowing and bestowing of the seed in good proportion
and sort vpon the ground: vvhich our common Husbandman
v
                        •
                     eth to doe in the time called of him the dusting time: Notwithstanding that the inhabitants
of Beauce doe not so strictly stand vpon the same: for by reason of the fatnesse
of their grounds, they take the time howsoeuer it shapeth, hauing no good assurance
of the time, whether it will continue faire, or turne rainie. It is the order and
common fashion to breake the clods with the Rowler (vvhich would doe well to be
of Marble in a tough and stiffe ground) or else you may breake them with a harrow,
well toothed with sharp-pointed teeth of yron, and of a good length. But howsoeuer,
you must so labour it, and so oft goe ouer it, as that it may be broken all into dust, if it
be possible, that so there may not remaine one clod vnbroken after that it is sowne.
                  Yet for the more certaine clodding of arable grounds, you shall know, that it must
be done according to the nature of the soyle, and euer after a good shower of raine,
the first which falleth, after the seed is sowne. If the ground be a loose soft mould, and
verie apt to breake, then the back-side of your harrowes being runne ouer the lands,
vvill be sufficient: but if the earth be more hard and binding, then you shall take the
rowler of Wood, for that of Marble is a great deale too heauie, and indeed onely fit
for Grasse-grounds, and not Corne-grounds, as also the teeth of the harrow are too
sharpe, and teare vp the earth too much: and vvhere the vvoodden rowler vvill not
serue, there you shall take clodding-beetles, made of purpose broad and flat, and
with them breake the clods so in peeces, that the raine may soften them; &amp; then with
your back-harrowes runne ouer them againe: and this is called sleighting, as well as
clodding.
                  Wherefore, after that the clods are well broken, and all made plaine, for the second
earing,The second earing. you shall cut vp your grounds againe about mid Iune, if they be fat and moist;
or about the moneth of September, if they be leane and drie: for otherwise your leane
ground would be quite dried vp and burnt with the Sunne, neither would there remaine
therein anie vertue or iuice. Aboue all things you must obserue and keepe such
order in plowing, as that the ground may not be too drie nor too moist: for great store
of moisture maketh them dirt and mire, and too much drinesse doth disaduantage the
husbandman amaine, either because the plough cannot enter the ground, or if it enter,
yet it cannot breake it small ynough, but turneth vp thicke and broad clods of
earth, in such sort, as that afterward it will be hard to plow vp the field againe: for
certainely, there cannot be that done which should and is requisite, when the earth is
too hard. Wherefore the ground that hath beene plowed in drought, must haue a rainie
season found out to be plowed in afterward againe, that so the same being watered
and moistened, may be the more easily tilled.
                  Yet of the most approuedst husbandmen (for France is not rich in that profession)
it is held, that the earth can neuer be plowed too drie, so long as the plow is able to
run through the same, and one ardor so gotten, is worth three in the moister weather:
besides, the greater that the clods are which arise by plowing thus in drie weather, 
                        〈◊〉
                     
greater store of mould you shall haue, which is a good aduantage to the graine, neither
will it be anie thing more difficult to plow, if you stay a good season, and haue
the earth throughly wet before the next plowing, for these great clods doe neuer arise
but in the clay grounds, which are apt to breake with anie moisture.
                  
                     
Shortly after the second earing, you shall giue it his third earing,The third earing. which must be
more light, and such as breaketh not in so deepe as the two former. This earing being
finished, you must make the ground euen and smooth with a harrow presently after,
which shall be about the middest of October: then you shall sow and bestow your
seed vpon the ground in good proportion, but not at anie other time than in the encrease
of the Moone, and neuer in the decrease: and then likewise it will be the better,
if you take the opportunitie of a little raine, following the Prouerbe, which sayth,
You must sowe Wheat in myre, and Barly in dust: and the reason is, because tha
                        •
                     
Wheat being hard, and comming neere to the nature of Wood, doth bud and 
                        〈◊〉
                     
better and sooner, when it is layd in steepe and mollified in dyrt: or else for feare of
Pismires, which if the Wheat should be sowne in a drie ground, would become lords
of it by and by, and carrie it away. Notwithstanding, if you see that the raine be
somewhat long in comming (seeing the times are not in mans power) you shall not
deferre to sow, especially in dry grounds: for the corne which is sowne in dry ground,
and well harrowed and couered, doth enioy and keepe the same without corrupting
as well as if it were in the Garner: and if there follow anie raine, the seed will be vp
in a day. I presuppose in the meane time, that the Husbandman hath let rest and lye
idle his grounds for some two yeares, wherein he is intending to sow his Wheat, to
the end they may bring him a better crop. Furthermore, seed
                        •
                     time is expired and past
about the eighteenth day of Nouember: for then the earth, by the coldnes of the aire,
becommeth close shut, and (as it were) rugged, staring, and agast, so that it will not be
able so well to receiue the seed, and to cause it to thriue. It is true that in cold places
seed must bee sowne earlier, but in hote places later: whereupon it commeth to passe,
that in Italie they sowe about the beginning of Nouember; but with vs in France,
where it is temperate, in October; in cold places, and Coast-countries, in the kallends
of September, or rather sooner, to the end that the roots of the come may be growne
strong before that the Winter-raine doe molest it, or the Yee and Frosts doe hurt it.
Notwithstanding at what time soeuer you sowe your seed, you must ma

Winter-cornes: for Pease, Beanes, and Pulse, would bee sowne in Februarie, and the
beginning of March; and Oats and Barley, at the end of March, and beginning of
Aprill. Now sometime the husbandman shall haue occasion to reioice in hope of
good successe, and sometime to feare in doubt of the euill successe, of his seed, by reason
of the variablenes of the time. Hee shall haue good hope of his Seed, if hee see
the time inclined to sweet, mild, and not violent showers; and vnto temperate, not e

easily, when it is sowne in a bad plot.
                  And for as much as I speake onely of Wheat in this place, being the graine of most
vse in Fraunce, you shall vnderstand, that there be diuers kinds thereof, as shall be
shewed hereafter; which sith their names are not familiar in other Countries, I will
here repeat those which are most in vse amongst our neighbours, especially in England:
of which, the first is called whole-straw Wheat,Sor
                           •
                        s of Wheat. because the straw is whole
and entire, not hauing anie hollownesse within it, and this is of all Wheat the largest
and goodliest, and yeeldeth the greatest store of flowre, yet not of the most pure
and most white colour: it prospereth onely on the rich stiffe clay-grounds, and must
necessarily haue three earings before it be sowne. Next vnto it, is the great Pollard
Wheat, which hath no aues vpon the eares: it is a large Wheat also, and prospereth
likewise vpon stiffe clay-grounds, yet will aske but one earing, because it loues to be
sowne vpon Pease-ground, from whence Pease was reaped the same yeare. The next
is small Pollard, which loues an indifferent earth, as that which is grauelly, or of barren
mixture, and it must haue euer full three earings. Then Ograue Wheat, which
loueth anie well-mixt soyle, and will grow either after three earings, or but one, so it
besowne where Pease is reaped. Then

except the stiffe clay, or burning sand, prouided that it haue fully three earings, and
be well manured. And lastly, Chylter Wheat, which is like vnto flaxen Wheat.

as for those which swimme aloft aboue the water, they shall be taken away, because
they are not worth any thing to sow: for the best vse for such, is either to seed Hennes,
or else to grind, that so you may get out euen that s

                     all quantitie of meale and
flowre that is within them. Some before the sowing of their corne, doe sprinkle it ouer
a little with water, wherein haue beene infused Houseleeke, or the stamped seedes
and roots of wild Cucumbers, to the end that the corne may not be eaten of Moules,
field-Mice, or other such like vermine. Yet howsoeuer this may be a practise in
France, it is not receiued generally amongst Husbandmen, to steepe the corne in
water, before they sowe it, because so much moisture cooleth and drowneth the
kernell of it too much: Nay, they are so farre from the practise thereof, that a
well-reputed Husbandman will not suffer his corne to be so much as washed before
it be sowne.
                  The quantitie of corne which must be sowne,How much corn will serue in sowing. shall be measured and rated according
to the peece of ground: for an arpent of fat ground will for the most part take
foure bushels of Wheat, a reasonable fat ground will take fiue, and a leane will take

more. It is true, that there must respect be had vnto the Countrey and place where
it is sowne: for in cold Countries and places that are waterie, being also alwaies subiect
to Snowes, it is needfull to sowe a great deale more than in hot Countries, or in
temperate and drie places, in as much as the cold and Snow doe corrupt the great
                        •
                     st
part of the seed. Besides, the time is well to be obserued, and the disposition of the
ayre: for in Autumne you must sowe lesse thicke: and in Winter, or the times approaching
and comming neere to Winter, a great deale more: againe, in rainie weather
you must sowe thicker than in drie weather. Yet in England and other Countries
which are much colder than France, two bushels of Wheat or Pease will fully
sowe an acre: and foure bushels of Barly, or Oates: and three bushels of Beanes:
which proportion no man need to alter vpon anie occasion whatsoeuer.

                  Of harrowing and weeding of Corne.
                  
                     PResently after that the seed is bestowed in the ground, you must, for your
last worke, harrow it along and crosse ouerthwart, and after that 
                        •
                     ake
it from furrow to furrow, but ouerthwart onely. This would be done
with Harrowes, hauing yron teeth rather than woodden ones, because
they make the corne settle deeper into the earth, which they doe breake and make
fmall a great deale better, and so by that meanes doe couer the corne with earth, as it
requireth, at the least the thicknesse of foure fingers, that so it may be the faster rooted,
and the safer from birds: and thus it must be let alone the whole Winter vpon
the Spring. True it is, that during Winter you must not neglect to make draynes
and draughts, thereby to carrie away the water that falleth in too great aboundance
by raine.
                  Now this manner of harrowing is but for such entire grounds as lye together leuell,
plaine, and vndistinguished by lands: for were they cast vp with ridges, as the
lands of many Countries are, then could they by no means be harrowed ouerthwart.
Therefore wheresoeuer your ground lyes, in lands or in common, mixt amongst your
neighbours, there you shall euer harrow your lands directly vp and downe the full
length of the lands, beginning at the furrowes first, and so ascending vp to the ridges.
As for the Harrowes, as before I said, the woodden Harrow is best for the loose

                  When the Spring time is come, and the Wheat hath taken good root, you must
weed your ground of such store of weedes, as Winter raine, and the ranknesse of the
earth it selfe, haue caused to abound and ouer-grow the corne, newly put vp, as Fe

it will be good to doe it the second time, as when the eare beginneth to shoot▪ for i

so doing, the corne will proue faire and cleane. But in the meane time, you must so
weed it at the first, as that the rootes be not hurt, but that they may remaine couered
and laden with the earth, that so they may stand faster in the earth, and grow the
more vpward. At the second time of weeding you must not bare it much: for and
if the Wheat should not shoot vp still more and more, it would rot vpon the earth,
and bring forth nothing. Againe, at the second weeding you shall stirre and make
euen the ground a little, that so the corne may not be too close and fast couered

This worke and dutie is not of small weight and moment, in as much as oftentimes
the corne is choaked by weedes, and bowed to the earth by their too much loftinesse,

taking their opportunitie of some beating wind or raine. Moreouer, you must not
be abashed, if the greater part of the eares proue emptie, without hauing anie thing
at all in them, and the other not to come to perfection and ripenesse. Againe, when
the good corne is accompanied with Fetches, Darnell, and other weedes, the bread is
not onely made more vnpleasant, lesse sauourie, wholesome, and discoloured, but also
it commeth not to the one halfe of good corne, which is not mingled with these filthie
weedes: insomuch, as that three load of such corne, after the winnowing of it,
doe not yeeld two of pure and cleane corne. And which is worse, the field where
such seedes are scattered, doe not bring forth halfe so much as those which are charged
with nothing but well cleansed and winnowed corne.

                  Of mowing, or shearing.
                  
                     THe last labour and toyle,The last labour. for the which all the other in the whole yeare
going before, was taken, is mowing and cutting downe of the corne:
which must be attended, after that it once becommeth ripe; which will
appeare, by the turning of the colour into a light yellow throughout,
in all parts alike: and before that the graine be altogether hardened and turned red,
that so it may grow thicker in the weathering and barne, rather than standing in the
fields. For it is most certaine, that if it be cut downe in good and due season, it will
grow bigger, and encrease afterward: whereas otherwise, if you stay the mowing or
shearing of it downe, till it be throughly drie, the greatest part of the corne will fall
to the ground in shearing of it, and will become a pray for the birds and other beasts.
If there happen anie violent storme, or whirlewind, it will lay it flat with the earth.
You must, of all other times, make choice of the wane of the Moone, or betwixt
Moone and Moone, to cut downe your corne therein,The time to cut downe Corne. if that you would haue your
corne to keepe well: and the best houre, is the breake of the day, when it is full of
deaw. The manner of shearing, is either to cut it in the middest of the straw, to the
end you may haue stubbleStubble. to couer your countrey houses, as also to heat the Ouen to
bake bread, in such countries as are vnprouided of wood, as in Beauce: or else to cut
it within a foot of the ground, for the greater prouision of straw,Straw. which will serue
afterward to make MatsMats. for Beds, or Litter for Horses and other Cattell, and (which
is yet the greatest profit of all) to imploy about the making of Mats, for the vse and
behoofe of the householder in his chambers. That which remaineth, shall either be
cut downe with Sickles, or Hedging-bills, made fast to the end of a great staffe, to
make a fire withall for the Winter time: or else it shall be burned in the fields themselues,
to make dung, by the means of raine falling thereupon, in grounds especially
that are sandie, or standing of a stiffe Potters clay, or which haue a strong mould.
                  And although this be the French manner of shearing of Wheat or Rie (for of these
graines there are no difference) yet in other countries they vse to sheare after the
Sunne is risen, and at such time as the corne is most drie, holding (as doubtlesse it is
most probable) that the binding of the corne together in sheaues, whilest the wet
deaw is vpon it, doth either rot or make it mildew quickly. As for the stubble, it is
much better to mowe it downe with Sythes, than cut it vp with Sickles,Sythes &amp; Sickles. both because
you may goe neerer to the ground, and also saue much labour, in doing your worke
sooner and better.
                  The corne being cut, shall be gathered together and made into sheaues, and after
led and carried into the barne by the Farmer: which must be seated in a sufficient
high place, that so it may receiue the wind somewhat readily: and yet not that I
would haue the wind, when it commeth, to be able to goe against the houses, or
gardens: for besides the annoyance which the small chaffe would worke in the
eyes of the people, and that before they should perceiue it, it would furthermore

hurt and much annoy the gardens, because that by the same sticking to the leaues of
the hearbes and trees, as also to their fruits in Autumne, it would drie them, and make
them apt and easie to be burnt by the heat of the Sunne.

                  Of threshing Corne.
                  
                     FOr the last labour of the Husbandman, there remaineth nothing more,
but to thresh out the Corne,To thresh corne. for to sow it againe, or for to store vp and
lay aside in the Garner, and this not sooner than till three months passed
after the Haruest: for although the Corne should be gathered of full
ripenesse, yet still it goeth forward to more perfection as it lyeth in the Barne. The
Gascoines notwithstanding fearing, that Corne left long in the sheaues should not
onely take a great heat, but grow full of Butterflies, Mothes, and small Wo
                        •
                     mes which
are wont to spoile it, cause the sheaues to be dried three whole daies in the Sunne, and
that in the field where they were mowen, and afterward thresh it in the same place,
carrying lastly the Corne so threshed into Garners: so that by that means they stand
not in need of Barnes to carrie their sheaues into, and there to keepe them.
                  This is also a custome vsed both in Ireland, Spaine, and the Islands neere vnto
Spaine; but I cannot commend the husbandrie: for it is most certaine, that except
Corne may take a kindly sweat in the Mowe, it is neuer wholesome, nor will yeeld
flower in that aboundance, which otherwise it would do. Besides, Corne is euer more
safely kept in the eare than in the Garner,Corne better kept in the eare than in the Garner, and take much lesse pu
                        •
                     rifaction. Whence
it comes, that your great Corn-masters and hoarders of Corn, when they want roome
to lay their Corne in, will thresh vp their oldest store, and then keepe it in the chaffe
till they haue occasion to vse it, being of this mind, that whilest it lyes therein, it will
euer keepe sweet; and it is a most certaine rule: for nothing is a greater preseruer of
Corne than the owne chaffe, except it be the care it selfe; in which, Nature hauing
at first placed it, of necessitie it must euer be safest therein. Wherefore, I would haue
all good husbands to bring their Corne home into the Barne first, and there to let it
rest three weekes or a moneth at least, in which time it will haue taken the full sweat,
and then to thresh it,Bad to thresh sweating corne as occasion shall serue. And herein is also to be noted, that if you
shall thresh it during the time of sweating, it will be so danke and soft, that it will by
no means grind or make good flower, except it be dried, which also is not held good
nor profitable, and especially where it is dried with anie other heat than that which
the Sunne yeeldeth, as Kylne, Ouen, Stoue, or such like.
                  Before the threshing of it,The floore to thresh cor

it ouer with Oxe bloud, mingled with oyle of Oliues not salted, and afterward to
make it plaine and smooth with a Pauing-beetle or Rowler, to the end it may not
haue anie clefts or creuises in it, wherein the corne threshed out may be lost, or wherein
the Pismires might breed and hide themselues. The best way to thresh it, is with
flailes, and after to cleanse it from the chaffe, husks, and other filth, with the fanne, and
last of all, to sift it. In anie case leaue not Wheat long in the sheafe, because it taketh
heat, and thereupon becommeth full of Butterflies, Mothes, and small Wor

                  In what manner the Garners are to be made to put Corne in.
                  
                     LEt the Garner wherein you shall keepe your Wheat,Wheat Garners take his light from
the East, and a little ayred from the North and West, but principally
from the North-east, which keepeth the Corne alwaies drie, and fresh,
and coole; but not from the South, nor from anie such like coast or quarters.
It shall haue manie open holes, by which the whole vapour of the Corne may
passe forth, and the coole gentle ayre come in: And it must not be floored or planked
aboue, to the end that the winds may easily enter in through the open places and tiles
of the roofe, that so it may be more fresh and coole at all times. It must be placed farre
from all moisture, and other euill smells and vnpleasant ayre, and also from all the
houses wherein cattell are kept, whether horse, oxen, or other such like: the boorded
floore thereof shall be ordered as the earth-floore, that is to say, sprinkled with Neats
bloud mingled with oile-Oliue vnsalted, and after smoothed and made plaine with a

                        •
                     owler or pauing-beetle, as in which there is not to be left hole or breach, be it neuer so
little, without stopping of it with lime and sand. The said floore where the corne is
to be laid, shall be watered with vineger: the walls must be made trimme and dressed
ouer with mortar tempered in water, wherein hath been steeped the roots and leaues
of wild Cucumber: or with Lime tempered with Sheepes vrine, which shall be of
much vse against all kind of shrewd beasts that vse to eat the corne. And thus much
for the French experience. But for the custome of other Countries, it shall not be amisse
to make your Garners of Oaken boards close ioyned together, or else lined in
the ioynts with Lime and haire, in such wise, that no corne may runne through the
same. Others vse to keepe their corne in great Hutches, or chests of wood, with close
couers. But better than anie of these it is to make your Garners of Plaster as large as
you shall thinke good, for it keepes it most coole and sound, and is the least troubled
with Weeuils, Mites, Mice, or such like vermine. Yet to speake truly, and according
to the opinion of the best Husbandmen, all these Garners are more proper for Barly,
Oates, Rye, or all sorts of Pulse, than for Wheat, because it is a tender graine, and of
it selfe naturally apt to heat and putrifie, when it is kept close together in great and
thicke heapes: and therefore the wiser Farmers doe vse to spread their Wheat thinne
(as not aboue a foot thicke at most) vpon the Garne-house floore: which floore, if it
be of plaster, it is best; boards is the next; and the mudde floore is the worst of all:
and being to spread, you shall not faile to turne it ouer once a weeke at the least, for
feare of heating, or growing mustie.
                  In the Garner thus fitted, shall your corne be layd, being first made verie cleane,
for the cleaner it is, the lesse subject vvill it be to Weeuils and other 
                        〈◊〉
                     : It is
true that being in the garner, for the defending of it from this vermine, it is good to
remoue it often, and to haue about the heapes some wild Organie, or the dried leaues
of Pomegranat-trees, or Wormewood, or drie Southernwood: or vvhich is better,
in the middest often load of drie Wheat to mingle one of Millet made very cleane:
for by the coolenesse of the Millet, the Wheat vvill be kept from the vermine and
taking of all other manner of heat, and when occasion requireth, this Millet vvill be
easily sifted from the Wheat, by the meanes of a sieue: and furthermore, that it may
somewhat encrease, you must cast vpon the heapes of corne Sal-nitrum, and the
scumme thereof, both of them finely powdred, and mixt with verie fine earth. And
if it should come to passe, that the corne should not proue to last and stand sound
for long time, and that therefore it is ground into meale; then for the keeping of the
said meale, you must make masses or drie lumpes of Cummin and salt powned, and
lay them in the middest of the meale. Or if it appeare that Palmer-wormes are bred

in the corne, or any other such like vermine, by the ouerheating of it, you must dust
it by and by with a sieue, and after spread it abroad, and leaue it in the Sunne all the
while of the great heat, euen vntill euening, and after that it is become hot thus by
the Sunne, and hath beene made verie cleane, carrie it vp againe into the highest garner
that you haue, and thus the vnnaturall heat thereof will cease, and all the 
                        〈◊〉
                     
be killed, and the Wheat so coole as that it will be out of the danger of the former ouerthrow.
Furthermore, as concerning the fanning of Corne, the husbandman must
beware least he be beguiled by the measurers, or yet by the measures; seeing it is a
tricke they haue either in powring on the corne to presse it downe with their hand,
or else to strike the measure with their knee to cause the corne to run the closer together,
that so they may haue the better measure: such craftie shifts as this, are the 
                        〈◊〉
                     
that the second measuring is not answerable vnto the first.
                  And although I speake here onely of fanning, of vvhich there are two kinds, the
one, a fan with loose clothes like sailes, which being turned swiftly about, gathereth
a vvind that will disperse the corne from the chaffe; the other made of Wickers, of
a great compasse, being the one halfe plaine without an edge, the other halfe hauing
an edge almost a foot deepe, vvhich being turned to the bodie of the man, and casting
the corne to and fro in the same, it disperseth and driueth the chaffe from the
corne; yet the wynowing of corne before the vvind,Wynowing of Corne. either betweene your corne-barne-doores,
or in any other narrow place where the wind being straitned is made
to blow with more violence, is as good, and dresseth your corn as cleane as any other
way whatsoeuer, and with a great deale lesse cost and labour, for that way you shall
dispatch more corne in an houre than any other way in three, neither will there remaine
in it so many seeds as by doing otherwise.

                  Of Rie.
                  
                     RIe (called in Latine Secale, and of the Auncient Writers Farrago) craueth
not such an industrious &amp; carefull ordering, nor yet so fat a ground,
and so well inriched, as doth the wheat, for it so increaseth in all grounds
in such aboundance, that of one bare corne there will corne an hundred,
be it neuer so badly plowed and dunged. Witnesses hereof are the people of Auuergne,
Lymosin, Perigord, and Forest, but chiefely those of Beauce, Solong
                        •
                     ois,
which is abounding in this kind of corne; notwithstanding that the ground thereof
for the most part be leane, grauelly, and verie slenderly husbanded and tilled by the
inhabitants, as those which imploy themselues a great deale more busily in keeping
of Sheepe, than in growing of Corne: and hereby we may learne and take out a new
lesson, namely, that negligence is good for something, and now and then bringeth
his commoditie home with it. It is but a verie small and starued graine in respect
of Wheat, and the bread vvhich is made thereof is vnpleasant, fattie, 
                        〈◊〉
                     , heauie,
like paste, blacke, and more profitable in the time of dearth to slay and kill the
sharpenesse of hunger, in the base and rusticall people, than to feed wholesomely, and
make good nourishment of: againe, such as be wealthie, and men liuing at ease, make
no reckoning of it. It is true that many doe mingle it with wheat, to the end that the

bread made thereof may continue a longer time moist and tender: yea, and which is
more, the physitians of the Court doe giue directions for the making of bread of
this kind of Corne for Kings and Princes to feed vpon in the beginning of their
meales (especially in Summer) to procure them a loose bellie: but they that are carefull
of their health, especially such as doe not exercise and toyle their bodies, and students
in generall, the Monkes and such like, must auoyd to eat the bread made of the
meale of this Corne alone, howsoeuer the plow-Swaine haue this opinion of it, namely,
that it maketh the bodie strong; and for certaine it is found by manifest and daily
experience that the vvomen of Lyons, Auuergne, and Forest, by the vse of this bread
doe become verie faire, and to haue more solide bodies, and more abounding in good
and laudable juice or humours, than others commonly haue. Some likewise are of
judgement, that the vvater of Rie-bread is more pleasant, and farre better than that
of Wheat-bread be it neuer so vvhite. Cookes, vsed to vvorke in pastrie, doe make
such crusts as they would haue to endure long, of Rie-flower. This bread is made to
feed dogges, and to fat swine: all other kinds of cattell, especially hens and horse, do
abhorre and loath it altogether: This Corne is verie subject to rust, because it 
                        〈◊〉
                     
vvater in the huske or bagge wherein it groweth, the remedie vvhereof consisteth
in such meanes vsed, as we haue alreadie set downe: The straw thereof serueth
for much vse in binding of Vines, because it is flexible and pliant, hauing beene first
sleept in vvater, as likewise the meale thereof, to make cataplasmes of, for the suppurating
and ripening of impostumes: the decoction of the Corne killeth vvormes, if
there be some Coriander-seed put thereto: in like manner horse-leache doe giue it
to horses which are pained in their bellies.
                  And thus much for the opinion and custome of the French, whose soyle is so frequent
vvith Wheat, that they little respect the vse of other graines. But to resort to
the better-knowing husbands, and to whose opinions Seres and diuers other later
Writers agree, you shall vnderstand that RieRie. is a most excellent graine, pleasant, and
sauourie in taste, and verie wholesome to be eaten, in as much as it keepeth the bodie
open, and breedeth not that costiuenes
                        •
                     e which other graines doe: and although the
bread which it maketh, being made of the meale as it commeth from the mill vnsifted
and vncleansed, be blacke, and vnlouely to looke on, yet it is verie wholesome,
and more sauourie, and better to eat than any bread made of any other graine, except
Wheat; nay if it be sifted and cleansed through a fine raunge, scarce, or boulter, it
makes bread as vvhite, as comely, and much more pleasant to eat than any course or
leuened Wheat whatsoeuer. This Rie naturally desireth a warme and drie ground, as
especially the red sand, or any clay that is much mingled therewith: it will grow in
any clay, and the richer the better, and the corne the larger, prouided, that the mould
be loose and gentle: it asketh as many earings as Wheat doth, and must euer be sowne
in one and the selfesame time; yet if the ground be any thing good of it selfe, it vvill
grow well ynough after one earing, prouided that it be sowne on such ground as
Pease were reaped from the same yeare: for Pease (by reason of their running on
the ground, and smothering of the weed) is as good as a sleight manuring of the land:
Rie is verie quicke of growth, and will sprout in three nights at the furthest; it hath
no enemie so much as wet, or extreame raine, so that you must sow it in as drie a time
as is possible: for it is a common saying amongst Husbandmen, That Rie vvill be
drownd in the hopper, that is, if a showre of raine should but fall in the hopper or
seed-basket whilest you were sowing it, that showre would drowne it, and the Rie
would hardly grow after: therefore your greatest care must be a faire season, and a
drie mould; for the contrarie kills it.
                  
                     Maslin.
                     MAslin (called of the Latines Metellum) is not one kind of Corne, but a mixture
of Wheat and Rie, or of White corne (vvhich the Latines call Far adoreum,
euen as we shall further declare by and by) and of Rie, in such sort as that thes
                           •
                        
                        
two kinds of corne mingled, are sowne, gathered in, and threshed together: the maslin
delighteth in a mixt kind of earth and tillage, but for the most consisting of that
which is fit for Wheat. The bread made of maslin, is one of the best sorts of bread,
and easie to digest. It seldome or neuer requireth any more than one earing, which
is at such time as it is sowne onely, neither is it euer sowne vpon the fallowes, but
vpon the Pease-earth, being euer vvell and carefully harrowed: if you find the sayle
whereon you sow it to be weake or out of heart, the best meanes to giue it strength is
to fold it with sheepe immediately before you sow it, so that as soone as you take your
fold from the land, you may put your plow into the land, by which meanes the seed
and the manure as it were meeting together, the manure keepeth the seed so warme,
and giues it such comfort, that forthwith it takes root, and brings sorth the increase
most aboundantly. Now for the cropping or gathering of this Maslin,To crop or gather Maslin. or blend;
corne, you shall euer doe it so soone as you see the Rie begins to open or turne his eare
downeward towards the earth, albeit the Wheat seeme a little greenish at the root,
and be nothing neere ripe, the corne being soft and milkie; for the Wheat will ripen,
and grow hard in the sheafe, which no other corne will doe: and the Rie being
suffered but to grow a day beyond his full time, will shed his graine vpon the earth,
and you shall loose more than one halfe of your profit: againe, you shall not lead
your blend-corne so soone as you doe your cleane Wheat, or your cleane, Rie, but making
it into good bigge safe stouckes vvhich will shed the raine from the eares, and
containing some sixteene or twentie sheaues in a stoucke, you shall suffer is so to stand
in the field to ripen, as well for the hardning of the Wheat, as for withering of the
greene weeds vvhich growing amongst the Corne will be shorne vp therewith, and
bound in the sheaues altogether.
                  
                  
                     Secourgion.
                     SEcourgion is a kind of Corne that is verie leane, vvrinckled, and starued, somewhat
like vnto Barley, and it is not vsed to be sowne in France, except in the time
of famine and dearth, and then also but in some countries as are barren and verie
leane, and that to stay the vrgent necessitie of hunger rather than to feed and nourish.
It hath his name from the Latine vvords Succursus gentium: The greatest part
of Perigord and Lymosin doe vse this sort of Corne: it may seeme to be a degenerate
kind of Corne, and may be called bad or wild corne. It must be sowne in the
thickest and fattest ground that may be chosen: howsoeuer some say otherwise, as
that it delighteth in a light ground, in as much as it sprouteth out of the earth, the
seuenth day after that it is sowne, the thicker end running into rootes, and the smaller
putting forth the greene grassie blade vvhich flourisheth and groweth out of the
earth. The fittest time for the sowing of it, is about the moneth of March in cold
places, or about the eight or tenth of Ianuarie, if it be a mild Winter, and not sharpe
and pinching. This is that kind of graine of three moneths growth, whereof Theophrastus
speaketh in his Booke of Plants, howsoeuer Columella doe not acknowledge
any kind of graine of that age. Theophrastus in like manner maketh mention of a
kind of graine of threescore dayes or two moneths growth, and of another of fortie
daies growth. I heare say that in the West-Indies about Florida there grow sorts of
corne, some of two, some of three moneths, and some of fortie daies: vve see it verie
ordinarie in France to haue corne in three moneths, namely, in the countries of
Beauce, Touraine, Lyonnoise, Sauoy, Auuergne, Forest, Prouence, Chartrain, and
others, in which the corne being sowne in March is ripe and readie to be cut downe
in the third moneth. The occasion of sowing it so late is either the vvaters or excessiue
cold, or snow, or some such other hard vveather, vvhich kept and hirdered it
from being sowne any sooner. Such graines and sorts of corne as are of three or two
moneths, or of fortie daies, and amongst them especially the Secourgeon, doe yeeld
a verie vvhite and light flowre, because it hath but verie little bran, and the graine
hauing drawne verie small store of substance for his nourishment, but such as is of the

lightest part of the earth (and therefore small store of Bran) by reason of the small
space of time that it stayed in the earth: The bread made of this Corne is verie
white, but withall verie light, and of small substance, more fit for Countrie-people
and seruants in Families than for Maisters and vvealthie persons: Againe, in countries
vvhere it is of account, they vse to mixe Wheat vvith it, to make houshold-bread.
                  
                  
                     Blanche.
                     BLanche is a kind of Wheat which the Latines call Far clusinum, and old Writers
Far adoreum, as a Corne or Graine worthie to be highly thought and made
of for his excellencie and goodnesse sake: it is verie hard and thicke, and requireth a
strong and tough ground, though it be not all of the best husbanded. It groweth
also verie wel in places and Countries that are verie cold, as not fearing any cold be it
neuer so outragious: Neither doth it mislike and refuse drie and parched grounds,
and such as lye open to the excessiue heat of Sommer; the Corne cannot be driuen
from his huske, except it be fried or parched: againe, for to grind and make bread
of it, they vse to frie or parch it, but vvhen they vse to sow it, they let it alone vvith
the huske, and in it they keepe it for seed. It is verie massie and vveightie, but not
altogether so much as Wheat, but yet more cleane and pure than Wheat, and
also yeeldeth more flowre and branne than any one sort of Wheat besides. This
kind of Wheat is verie rare in France, but verie common in Italie, vvhere it is
called Sacidate.
                     
                  
                  
                     Fine Wheat, or Winter-wheat.
                     THere is a kind of small Corne that is verie vvhite, vvhich the Latines call Silig
                              •
                           ,
vvhereof is made White-bread, called therefore of the Latines Siliginitis. The
French cannot as yet sit it with a name. It must be sowne in verie open places, and
such as are hot and throughly warmed by the Sunne; although it doe not vtterly refuse
an earth that is thicke, moist, slymie, and of the nature of Walkers-earth, seeing
that good husbandmen doe likewise report of it, that there needeth no such great care
to be taken about the making of this graine to grow, and vvithall, that if a man vse to
sow Wheat in a moist and muddie ground, that after the third sowing it will degenerate
into this kind of Wheat. It is that kind of Wheat which amongst the English
is called Flaxen-wheat, being as vvhite or vvhiter than the finest Flax: it is of all
sorts of Wheat the hardest, and vvill indure a more barren and hard ground than any
other Wheat vvill, as the grauellie, the flintie, stonie, and rough hils against which
by the reflection of the Sunne onely (vvhose beames it loueth exceedingly) it will
grow verie aboundantly, neither will it prosper vpon and rich soyle, but being as it
were ouercome vvith the strength thereof, it will vvither, or not grow at all, or else
mil-dew, turne blacke, and become altogether vselesse.
                  
                  
                     Amel-corne.
                     THere is yet another kind of Corne, vvhich the Grecians and Latines call Olyra,
of a middle size betwixt Wheat and Barlie, vnlike altogether vnto Winter-vvheat
vvhereof we last spake, but of a sort and facultie like vnto spelt, whereof vve
vvill speake next in order. Of this graine Dioscorides maketh mention, and Matthiolus
calleth it in French Seigle-blanche: the tilling and ordering of it is like vnto
that of spelt. There is verie vvhite bread made thereof: there is but small store thereof
in France.

did make great account, and gaue it to name Semen, by the way of excellencie,
as the Italians in such places as vvhere the said Spelt groweth in great aboundance,
doe call it Biada. The Graine is lesse, and blacker than Wheat. It is
found sometime single, sometime double in an eare set with a long beard. It must
be sowne in a verie strong and hard ground, for otherwise it will not thriue, neither
is there any sort of Wheat which so troubleth and weakeneth a ground as this, but
the bread that is made thereof is excellent: and of it likewise the Italians vse to make
a singular kind of Furmentie.
                  
                  
                     Course Wheat-flowre: or fine Wheat-meale.
                     COurse Wheat-flowre is that which of the Latines is called Similage, and is made
of Wheat that is excellent good, hauing the greatest Bran onely sifted from it,

injurious to such as haue need of a fine and attenuating nourishment. It is certaine
that it is of great nourishment, as is also the bread that is made thereof. In

flowre Semole is made, it craueth such ground and manner of husbanding as Maslin
doth.

                     FVrmentie is that vvhich the Latines call Alica or Chondrus, and it is a kind of
Wheat, whereof (after that it hath been steeped for some time in vvater, and afterward
brayed and husked, and then in the end dried againe in the Sunne and
ground somewhat grosly) is made a kind of grosse meale, re

                     Turkie-Wheat.
                     TVrkie-wheat (so called, or rather Indian wheat, because it came first from the
West-Indies into Turkie, and from thence into France, not that it is sowed
there any otherwise than for pleasure, or for to cause some admiration at the strange
things which Frenchmen themselues doe admire and make much account of)

receiue some prettie showres: vvhich happening, then presently to open the earth

within fortie daies, two moneths, three moneths, or at the furthest foure moneths, sooner
or later according to the goodnesse of the ground, and power of the Sunne, that
is to say, earlier in a hot place and good ground that lyeth open vpon the Sunne, but
more late in a cold ground, and a leane place. It hath the like temperature that our
vvheat hath, but somewhat more hot, as may easily be gathered by the sweetnesse of
the bread that is made thereof: the meale thereof is vvhiter than that which is made
of our wheat, but the bread made thereof is more grosse, thicke, or close, and of a more

famine doe force and compel you to sow of this Turkish-wheat, to make bread thereof,

should vse it by it selfe all alone. The meale of this vvheat in as much as it is thicke
and clammie, will be good to make cataplasmes of, to ripen impostumes withall: for
being apt to stop the pores of the skin by his clamminesse, it cannot chuse but worke
such effect.
                  
                  
                     Sarasins-wheat.
                     SArasins-wheat is a graine verie ordinarie and common throughout all France,
and more abounding vvithout comparison than the foresaid Turkie-wheat: it
must be sowne in all manner of grounds, because it refuseth not to grow in any, vvhether
it be grauelly, or of any other qualities vvhatsoeuer, and that especially in Aprill
in hot places, or somewhat later in those that are cold, and it is so forward and hastie,
at that it will ripen twice, and yeeld you two crops in a yeare, in one and the same
ground, being in a hot ground, as is to be seene in Italie. It may be mowne at the end
of three moneths after it is sown: in this countrie it is most vsed in the fatting of hogs,
pigeons, and other fowles, and in the time of dearth and famine to make bread, which
will be a great deale better, if with this corne be mingled the corne of our countrie
vvheat. It may be made into grosse meale, euen as the grain called furmentie, but better
without comparison than that of millet to be imployed in meat-broths, in panades
and pap-meats, as also to make 
                           〈◊〉
                         with cheese and butter. This is a meat that is
pleasant ynough, and not much loading or charging the stomacke, notwithstanding

Typh wheat is verie like to our Rie, and doth make a verie blacke bread, and verie
vnpleasant also when it is old, though it be otherwise verie pleasant when it is new
baked, after the manner of Rie. The Goats wheat is not verie much vnlike vnto th

graine called Furmentie, saue onely that his meale yeeldeth more bran without comparison,
and so maketh a fitter bread to loosen the bellie than to feed or nourish it.
These wheats are not so much as to be seene in France, and therefore I meane not to
make any longer discourse thereof.

                  Barley.
                  
                     AFter that vve haue thus largely spoken of Wheat and other Corne,
                        
                           〈◊〉
                        . it remaineth
that vve should consequently speake of all manner of pulse: the
ordering and husbanding vvhereof, to speake in generall, is like vnto that
of the other graine going before, as namely, in the gathering of stones
from off them, in manuring and giuing them their first, second, and third ea
                        •
                     ing, as
also in clodding, sowing, harrowing, and mowing: but differing notwithstanding in
some things, as namely, in their nature; and therefore it will be best to make a particular
description thereof; especially of Barley, which howsoeuer it is of sleight vse
in France, because of the great profit of the vine, and the plentie of Wheat in which
the kingdome aboundeth, yet in other Countries it is of best respect, especially in
England, vvhere the greatest sort doth grow, and where they make Beere thereof so
good and excellent, that not any French Wine is more pleasant, or more wholesome.
Therefore to speake first of Barley, 
                        ••
                     cording to the opinion of the French husbandman,
vvhich is not to be held most authenticall.
                  Barley must be sowne in a leane, drie, and small ground, or else in a ground that is
verie fat throughout, because it doth bring downe and diminish the fatnesse of a
ground mightily: and for that cause it is either cast into the ground that is verie far,
the force and goodnesse vvhereof it shall not be able to hurt: or into a lea
                        •
                     e ground,
vvherein a man should not sow any thing else so well. It must be sowne in a ground
that hath had two earings, in some countries in the moneth of October, but in this
countrie after the fifteenth day of Aprill, according to the common prouerbe (at S.
Georges day you must sow your Barley, and lay your Oats away) if the ground be
fat, but and if it be in a leane ground, it must be sowne sooner, not 
                        •
                     laying for any
raine, in as much as that according to the prouerbe, Wheat must be sowne in 
                        〈◊〉
                     ,
and Barley in dust: for Barley cannot endure any great store of moisture, being of it
selfe drie, open, and cold: againe, Barley being sowne in moist places, and much watered
vvith raine-water, doth easily canker, and turne into darnell and oats: the same
manner of ordering is giuen to the barley called mundified barley, and that because
the chaffe thereof falleth presently, and cleaueth not vnto the corne, as it doth in common
barley. When you perceiue it somewhat ripe, you must mow it sooner than any
other corne: for it hath a brittle stalke or straw which is verie apt to breake, when it
is verie drie, and the corne being but weakely inclosed vvithin his huske, doth easily
and of it selfe fall vnto the earth: and hence also it becommeth more easie to thresh
and shake out, than any other graine. After the corne is mowne, it will be good to let
the earth lye ydle a yeare, or else to manure it throughly, and so to take away all the
euill qualitie that is remayning and left behind.

                        -bread. In a deere yeare it is vsuall to make
bread of barley, as vve shall declare hereafter, and that better for the poore people
than for the rich, and yet in one point to be praised, in as much as it is good &amp; wholesome
for them that haue the gout: the assured truth vvhereof, is found out rather by
experience than reason. Notwithstanding in as much as Barley (as Galen 
                     
                        〈◊〉

imployed, doth coole, and yeeld a thinne kind of nourishment, and somewhat
cleanseth the bodie, in that respect it may be profitable for them that haue the

                     ,
as those that are full of humours, and subject to distillations falling downe vpon the
mints.
                  
                     
There is made of Barlie a certaine kind of drinke,Mundified Barley. vvhich is commonly called aptisane,
and a meat that is good for sicke persons, called mundified barley, which th
                        •
                     
good vvife of the Farme may make in this sort; Take barley well cleansed and husked,
boyle it till it burst, and till it become like vnto a pap-meat, after beat it in a morter,
and when you haue so done, straine it through a verie fine strayner, put vnto it
sugar, or the juice of sweet almonds, or of poppie-seed, melons, or lettuses, according
as occasion shall be offered. Or else, Take of the best and newest barley, put it in a
mortar, and cast vpon it warme vvater, as it vvere to wet it, but not to make it swim,
afterward beat it gently with a vvoodden pestell, in such sort as that the huske that
couereth it may be forced off, then chafe it betwixt your hands, that so you may free
it quite from huskes; then afterward drie it in the Sunne: vvhen you haue this done,
take a handfull of the said barly, and put it in a pot, vvhich it may fill to the halfe,
and filling vp the other halfe with vvater, let it boyle by little and little vntill such
time as it be burst, and become like pap-meat, let it run through a linnen cloth, and
so straine out the juice.
                  Thus much for the French opinion of Barley:How Barley ought to bee sowne. but to come to the true knowledge
thereof, from the opinions of those that are better experienced in the same, you shall
vnderstand that Barley ought to be sowne vpon the best, richest, and best husbanded
ground you haue, and although it will grow in any soyle whatsoeuer that is vvell
husbanded, not being too extreame cold and moist, yet the better the earth is into
which you sow it, the better and the larger the corne is vvhen it groweth, and much
more seruiceable for any vse you shall please to imploy it. That Barley which groweth
on the stiffe clayes is the best, being large, white, and full like a Buntings beake.
That which growes on the mixt soyle, is the second best: and that which groweth
on the sands, is the vvorst. Barley asketh the greatest tillage of all graines, because it
must euer lye in a loose and gentle earth, and therefore when it hath least it ought to
haue full foure earings before it be sowne, as in the fertile rich clayes, it must first be
fallowed at the later end of April (for to stay till May the ground may be too drie)
and this arder of fallowing must cast downe the ground, that is to say, the furrowes
must be all turned downe from the ridge, and the ridge left open, so as the earth must
receiue seasoning: At mid-May you shall manure it, and in Iune you shall giue it
the second earing, which is called Sommer-stirring, and in this ardor you shall set vp
the land, that is, you shall plow all the furrows vpward toward the ridge of the land,
closing vp that which was before opened, and lapping in the manure into the earth
in such wise that not any thereof be vncouered; then at August you shall giue it the
third ardor or earing, vvhich is called foyling, and that is to cast the land downe againe,
as you did vvhen you fallowed it, and this ardor is of all other one of the best,
especially for the destroying of weeds and thistles; then in October you shall giue
it the fourth ardor or earing, vvhich is called Winter-ridging, and in that ardor you
shall euer set vp the land againe, as you did at the Sommer-stirring; and then in
March and Aprill following, you shall sow it. Now touching the manner of sowing
of these stiffe clayes, you shall first make you seedes-man cast his seed ouer the
land, in such sufficient manner as you shall thinke meet: then taking the plow, and
beginning in the furrow, you shall cast the land downeward ouer the seed, till you
haue plowed all the land, and left onely the ridge open, then holding the plow
croswise ouerthwart the ridge, you shall close the ridge, and draw the mould into it,
then you shall make your seedes-man cast another cast or two of the seed vpon the
ridge onely, and then harrow it with woodden toothed harrowes, and this manner of
sowing is called sowing vnder furrow. Now whereas I haue shewed you in the plowing
of your land, that you must first cast downe your land, then ridge it vp, then foyle
it downe, and lastly, set it vp for the whole Winter following: you shall vnderstand
that it is the best and most orderliest husbanding of land, breedeth the greatest
plentie of mould, and couereth the manure closest, and maketh it soonest rot in the
earth; yet notwithstanding for as much as Barley is a tender graine, and may by
to meanes indure any cold or vvet, if you find that your lands doe lye too flat,

so that the Water cannot descend from them, but either choaketh them, or keepes
them too vvet, then you shall set vp your land, and not cast it downe in any ardor
till you haue brought it to that conuenient height that the vvater may haue free
passage from the same; and so on the contrarie part, vvhen your lands lye too high,
you shall cast the furrowes downeward, vntill you haue brought them to that lownesse
vvhich shall be conuenient; and vvhen you haue so done, then you shall cast
them downe, and set them vp againe in such order as hath beene before mentioned.
There is also another maner or sowing of barley vpon these fertile and rich grounds,
vvhich is called sowing vpon the Iunames,Iunames. that is, to sow barley on the same ground
from vvhence but the haruest before you reapt your Barley, and it must be done in
this sort; as soone as you haue reaped your barley, vvhich is commonly in August,
you shall forthwith (if the ground doe require it) manure as much as you intend to
sow Barley againe vpon, and as soone as you haue manured it, immediatly (if the
ground be not too hard) you shall plow it, either setting it vp, or casting it downe, as
the land shall require; or if it be too hard, then you shall stay for a showre of raine,
yet the drier it is plowed, the better it is both for the land and the come: the land being
thus plowed, you shall let it lye till Nouember, and then you shall plow it againe,
but in this earing you shall be all meanes set it vp, and not cast downe the land,
and so 
                        •
                     et it lye till seed-time, and then sow it vnder furrow as was before shewed.
This barley vvhich groweth thus vpon the Iunames is the fairest, vvhitest, and
goodliest Corne of all other, and is the onely principall Corne you can reserue for
seed of all other; and therefore you must haue a great regard to the election of the
barley you thus sow vpon the junames: for the sowing of Barley vpon any mixt
earths, or hasell-grounds, vvhich are clayes and sands, or clayes and grauells mixt
together, you shall husband the grounds in all poynts as you doe the clay-grounds,
onely you shall differ in the times, for these mixt earths must be fallowed in Ianuarie,
Sommer-stirred in May, foyled in August, and Winter-rigged in October:
as for the sowing of them, you shall not sow them vnder furrow, but aloft, because
they are of binding natures; so that after the sowing should any sodaine raine fall,
and then a drinesse follow it, it would so bake the earth together, that the Corne
vvould not possible be able to sprout through it; and therefore (as I before said) you
shall sow it aloft, that is to say, you shall first plow it, beginning at the ridge, and
setting the furrowes vpward, then cast on your seed, and lastly harrow it. Now for
sowing Barley vpon sand-grounds, you shall husband it like vnto the mixt earths,
onely you shall giue it an ea
                        •
                     ing more, that is to say, a double foyling, and you shall
forbeare to sow it till it be about Whitsontide, for the heat of the sand is so great, that
it vvill make the Corne verie swift in growth, and ripen verie sodainely. Barley, in
vvhat soyle soeuer it is sowne, must be exceeding vvell sleighted, clotted, stoned,
and vveeded, for it is so verie tender in the growth, that the smallest clot or stone will
keepe it backe, and the least vveed vvill choake it. BarleyBarley. is of most pretious estimation
vvith all those vvhich know the true vse thereof, especially for the making
of mault, of vvhich is made Ale or Beere, drinkes so vvholesome and excellent for
mans bodie, that no nation vvhich doth enjoy it, hath any blessing to preferre before
it: as touching the order of making of malt,Malt. it is in this sort, first after your barley
hath beene cleane vvinowed and drest, you shall put it into a cesterne or fat made for
the purpose, and there sleepe it in vvater the space of three nights, then draine the
vvater from it cleane, and so let it lye in the fat one night more, then take it forth of the
fat, and lay it vpon a floore made either of boards, plaster, or earth: the earth floore is
vvarmest, and best for Winter, the plaster floore is coldest and best for Sommer, and
the boarded floore is betweene both: as soone as you haue laied it on the floo
                        ••
                     , you
shall make it into a great big coutch or heape a yard thicke or better; vvhich coutch
you shall make either long, round, or square at your pleasure, and according to the
quantitie of your corne, it shall thus lye in the coutch till you see it begin to sprout
and put forth little white jags or strings vvhich is called the coming of the mal
                        •
                     , and
them you shall reane and turn it, bringing that vvhich was the out-side into the midst.

and that which vvas in the middest vnto the our-side, that so it may come all alike,
for that which is in the middest, and lieth warmest, vvill euer come the first. Now
so soone as you see it is all comed, you shall forthwith spread open your coutch vpon
the floore, laying it not aboue a handfull deepe at the most, that so the corne may
coole, and not sprout or come any further, not forgetting but euerie day the space
of three vveekes, or vvithin three dayes of three weekes at the least, to turne the malt
vpon the floore twice or thrice a day, least forbearing so to doe, the corne heat, and
by that meanes aker-spire, vvhich is, to sprout at both ends, and so loose the heart of
the graine, and make the malt good for nothing. When you haue thus giuen it full
(
                        •
                     at and floore) three weekes, then you shall lay it on a vvell-bedded k
                        •
                     lne vpon a
good haire cloth, and there with a gentle fire drie it: the best fewell to make this 
                        •
                     ire
on, is straw, either Wheat, Rie, or Barley. Braken or Ferne is good also, go
                        •
                     sse is too
sharpe, and vvood is the vvorst of all, for it leaueth (through the sharpenes
                        •
                     e of the
smoake) an ill taste or sauour vpon the malt, yet here in France there be kilnes made
of Bricke, vvith such furnaces that carrie away the smoake, that you may burne what
fewell you please vvithout annoyance, neither are they so dangerous for the casualtie
of fire, as the 
                        •
                     ther plaine kilnes in England and other places are. After your malt
is vvell dried, you shall with your hands rubbe it well vpon the kilne, to get off the
come or sproutings vvhich before the drying did sticke vnto it; for it is a generall
rule, that the cleaner your malt is from come, and the snugger and smoother it lookes
like Barley (prouided it be well malted) the better it is, and euermore the more
marketable: for the come is of this nature, to drinke vp the liquor in vvhich your
malt is mashed, vvhen you make Beare or Ale, and so by that meanes to scant you
much of your proportion. When your malt hath beene well rubbed, and is reasosonable
cleane, then you shall shouell both the malt and the corne together, and so
put them together into a close garner made for the purpose, vvhere you shall let it
lye at least a moneth or six weekes before you vse it to ripen in the come, for that
makes euer the best yeelding malt: then when you please to vse it, you shall either
winow it, or trie it through a skreene made of wiers for the purpose, and then grind
it, and brew it as occasion shall serue. Now touching the choyce of the best malt, you
shal euer take that which is made of best and cleanest corne without weed-seeds, 
                        •
                     are,
or like filthinesse; yet if it haue here and there an oat it is the better, and not the worse:
it shall to your eye appeare bright, white, full, and cleane without come, in smell it
shal be pleasant and sweet, and not sharpe of the smoake, in handling it shal be brittle
and apt to breake, and the kernell shall be white and meallie, and in taste it shall be
strong, and exceeding sweet, and the graines which you shall champe in your mouth,
if you take them forth, and presse them betweene your fingers, they shall yeeld you a
white juice like milke, but thicke and luscious: but if in the biting or breaking they
be hard and vnapt to bruise, then it is a signe that there is in it much barley vnmalted,
and so the malt of a great deale the lesse profit. Barley as it is thus most excellent for
the making of drinke, so it is good also for bread, but not of the French maner, which
maketh bread thereof simple of it selfe, for indeed that bread of all other is least nourishing,
and most vnsauourie: but to mix it with any other graine, as with wheat, rye,
pease, or beans, with any one or with all of them, it maketh verie good &amp; most wholesome
bread: it is vsed in England most for hind-seruants, adding to a bushel of it, and
a bushell of pease, one pecke of wheat, and another of rie, and then laying it in strong
l
                        •
                     uen, and scalding the meale well, to take away the strong smell of the pease, and sure
this is a verie strong and well-relished bread, and most wholesome for any man that
shall labour hard, as is found by experience in England and other places. This barley
being boyled in water till it breake, and so giuen to eat whilest it is sweet, is the best
food that can be for the feeding or fatting of swine of all sorts, whether they be
brawnes, or porkets, or bacon-hogges: it also farteth a horse verie sodainely, but such
fat will not indure labour: the light corne, or hinder ends of barley, are excellent
for the seeding of all sorts of poultrie, as capons, hennes, turkies, geeese, or what
else strayeth about the Farmers yard or house: a leuen made of cleane barley-meale,

and milke is the best food that can be for the cramming of all sorts of poultrie; many
other vertues are in Barley, but none of greater vse than these alreadie rehearsed.
                  OatsOats. notwithstanding that they grow amongst Wheat and Barley without being
sowne, as an euill and vnprofitable thing, notwithstanding for the profit comming
of them for the feeding of great cattell, as also of men in the time of necessitie, they
deserue a proper and conuement kind of husbanding. They loue to be sowne in
leane places, which are drie, well aired, and haue beene alreared twice eared, and
that in Februarie, or March, but not later: they craue vvatering, and then they
grow both fairer, and fuller set. They must be gathered presently after that Rie and
Barley are in.
                  Although Oats be not vsed to make bread of, except it be in the time of great
dearth, notwithstanding some doe beat them in a morter, and doe make a meale
thereof called Oat-meale,Oat-meale. vvhich is boyled either alone, or else with flesh, to vse in
manner of a panade. Physitians are of judgement that Oat-meale so made doth
feed verie vvell, and is good against the grauellGrauell. and difficultie of vrine: for the
truth vvhereof, I referre you to the Britaines and Ange
                        •
                     ines, which vse it for the
same effects. When it is boyled all alone, for the making of it the more pleasant,
there is woont to be put vnto it cowes-milke, goats-milke, or the juice of sweet almonds
with sugar. The Flemmings vse to make pap-meat thereof, which they loue
exceeding vvell.Water distilled of Oats. The Muscouites distill the water of oats, and vse it for want of wine,
and such water heateth and maketh drunke no lesse than Wine.
                  Thus much of the French opinion of Oats, vvho are indeed but halfe knowing,
or not so much, in the excellencie of the graine; but to come to their knowledge who
haue the full proofe and triall thereof, you shall vnderstand that it is a graine of no
lesse worth and estimation than any of the other, and questionlesse may much lesse
be banished a Common-wealth than of the other, in as much as where none of the other
will grow, there this will; you shall then know, that Oats will grow in any soyle
whatsoeuer, as either in fertile or barren, hot or cold, drie or moist, nor doth it aske
much labour: for in fertile soiles it wil grow with one earing, as namely at seed-time,
which is euer about the end of March, or beginning of Aprill: it will grow also after
any other graine, as after wheate, rye, barley, or pulse, but it is best sowing it after
barley or pulse, because to sow it after Wheat or Rie would pill the ground too much,
and make it barren too soone: In barren grounds it will grow with two arders, or
three at the most, as one at Midsommer, another at Michaelmas, and the third at
seed-time, or else at Michaelmas, and at seed-time onely: it must be sowne vnder
furrow, like barley in loose moulds, and after two or three arders: but aboue furrow,
in fast earths; and where it hath but one arder onely, it must be well harrowed,
according to the strength of the mould, that is to say, with wooden-teeth in loose
moulds, and vvith yron teeth in fast moulds: they must be cropt as soone as they
turne colour, and appeare a little yellow, for else they vvill shed their graine, as being
the loosest corne of all other.
                  These Oats are of diuers most excellent vses both for men and also for cattell,
as first for Oatmeale which is made in this sort; as soone as your Oats haue beene
thresht and vvynowed, you shall lay them on your kilne, and vvith a soft fire drie
them verie vvell, and then carrie them to the milne, either the Wind-mill, the Water-mill,
or the Horse-mill, and there let the Miller cut them, and hull them, but by
no meanes crush them to fine meale, but onely driue the cleane kernell from the courser hull; then vvith a fanne or a gentle vvind vvinnow the emptie hulls from
the Corne, and if so be that you find they be not all cleane hulled, then passe
them through the mill againe, and then vvynow them againe, and thus doe till the nulls
be cleane taken off; vvhich hulls are a verie good prouander for horses: as for the
Groats, vvhich is vsually called common or course Oat-meale, they are excellent to
make porridge of all kinds, and for puddings of all sorts, or for any other pap-meat
or panada whatsoeuer: it is also an excellent food at Sea, being boyled in
Water, or otherwise vsed after the manner of grauell. This oat-meale being ground

into 
                        •
                     ine meale like other corne, maketh diuers kinds of verie good bread, chiefely
where other corne is not to be had. If you mixe the fine meale of Oates with Wheat
meale, it maketh verie daintie Oat-cakes, either thicke or thinne, and is of great estimation
where they are knowne. These Oates being maulted, as you mault Barley,
make a verie good mault, and that mault both verie good Ale and Beere, only a little
more sharpe than that which is made of Barley. Lastly, those Oates are of all other
foods the best that may be for the feeding of horse, or fatting of cattell: they are also
good to seed all sorts of Pulleine, especially Geese, Swannes, and all manner of water-fowle,
which take much pleasure therein.
                  
                     Millet.
                     MIllet (as those know verie well which dwell in the Countrey Bearne, Bigorre,
and Armignac) after that it hath beene steeped some certaine time in water,
would be sowne, either morning or euening, in the coole thereof, in light and small
moulded ground: and it groweth not only in grauelly ground, but also in sand, when
the country it wet and moist: but in anie case it would not be sowne in drie grounds,
and such as consist of Fullers earth, or are marly, neither must it be sowne before the
Spring, for it requireth heat: wherefore it may conueniently be sowne in the end of
the moneth of March, or else somewhat later, that so it may enioy the benefit of the
dew a long time. It putteth not the husbandman to anie great charges, for a little seed
will sowe a great deale of ground. So soone as it is sowne, it must be pressed downe
with a hurdle of Wickers well laden, to keepe it from the heat of the Sunne, in the
springing vp thereof: for otherwise the seed would grow vp and drie away, through
the veh
                           •
                        mencie and heat of the Sunne-beames. Notwithstanding, it would be oft
and verie well weeded, for the 
                           •
                        ooting vp of all manner of ill weedes, especially the
blacke Millet. So soone as it may be spied peeping forth of the earth, and before that
by the operation of the Sunne the corne doe shew, it must be pluckt vp by the hand,
and be laid in the Sunne afterward to drie; and lastly, shut vp in some place where it
may be kept: and being thus ordered, it lasteth longer than anie other manner of
corne. Millet doth good vnto the fields wherein it is gathered, in this respect; namely,
that wormes will not hurt the corne that shall be sowne there presently after anie
whit at all, seeing they will leaue the graine that is sowne, and cleaue to the straw of
the Millet.
                     In the time of dearth they vse to make bread of Millet, but vnpleasant ynough,
especially when it is setled: and the inhabitants of Gasco
                           •
                        gne and Campaigne doe
vse a pappe-meat made of Millet with milke, and that not of the pleasantest taste: as
well the bread as the pappe-meat, made of Millet, is of small nourishment: besides
that, they make obstructions; and that, because Millet is cold in the first degree, and
drie in the third. Millet fried with salt, and flowers of Camomill, and put into a bag,
doth serue against the paines of the collick and wringings of the bellie. To keepe
Purgatiues, as Rubarb, Agarick, yea and flesh also, from rottennesse and corruption,
it is good to burie them in Millet.
                  
                  
                     Sesame.
                     SEsame would be sowne in a blacke ground that is somewhat rotten and moist. It
groweth also in sandie and fat grauellie grounds, or in mingled grounds, and it is
verie fruitfull, euen no les
                           •
                        e than Millet or Pannicke. It is true, that the good householder
needeth not trouble his braine much with the sowing of it, seeing it is apt to
make the ground altogether barren, and yet is good for nothing except the oyle that
is pressed out of it, and the cakes which liquorish women vse to make of the meale.Oyle and cakes of Sesame.
It must not be sowne but in the midst of Summer, whiles the times continue drie,
and that there is no raine looked for of a long time; for the raine doth hurt it after it is
sowne, cleane contrarie to other plants, which (all of them) reioice in raine after they

are sowne. The oyle which is pressed out of the seed of Sesame, doth neuer freeze,
and is the lightest of all other Oyles, and yet being mixt with Wine or Aqua-vitae,
sinketh to the bottome. There is no account to be made of this graine for nourishment,
because it is giuen to ouercome the stomacke, and is hardly digested, as is all
oylie matter.
                  
                  
                     Lentils.
                     LEntils must be sowne at two times, in Autumne, and most commonly, especially
in France and cold Countries, in the Spring time, whiles the Moone encreaseth,
vnto the twelfth thereof, and either in a small or little mould, or in a fat and fertile
ground: for when they be in flower, they destroy and spoyle themselues through too
much moisture, or by putting too farre out of the earth. And to the end they may
grow the more speedily and the greater, they must be mixt with drie dung before
they be sowne, and foure or fiue daies after that they haue beene so laid to rest in this
dung, to sowe them. They will keepe long, and continue, if they be mingled with
ashes: or if they be put in pots wherein oyle and preserues haue beene kept: or and
if they be sprinkled with vineger mixt with Beniouin.
                     Lentils (howsoeuer auncient Philosophers had them in estimation) are of hard
digestion, hurtfull to the stomacke, filling the guts full of wind, darkening the sight,
and causing fearefull dreames: and withall, are nothing good, if they be not boyled
with flesh, or fried with oyle.
                  
                  
                     Fasels.
                     FAsels grow in stubbly grounds, or rather a great deale better in fat grounds, which
are tilled and sowne euerie yeare: and they are to be sowne betwixt the tenth of
October, and the first of Nouember; or else in March, as other pul
                           •
                        e, after that the
ground hath beene eared about the eleuenth of Nouember. They must be sowne after
that they haue beene steept in water, for to make them grow the mose easily, and
that at large when they are sowne, and alwaies as they ripen to gather them. They
make far grounds where they be sowne: they are accustomed to beare much fruit:
they keepe a long time: they swell and grow greater in boyling, and are of a good
pleasant tast vnto all m
                           •
                        ns mouthes. It is true, that they are windie, and hard to digest:
but yet notwithstanding, they are apt to prouoke vnto venerie, if after they be
boyled, they be powdred ouer with Pepper, Galanga, and Sugar: and yet more specially,
if they be boyled in fat milke vntill they burst. If you mind to take away their
windinesse, eat them with Mustard or Caraway seed. If you haue beene bitten of a
Horse, take Fasels, chew them, and apply them so chewed vnto the greene wound.
Young gentlewomen, that striue to be beautifull, may distill a water of Fasels that is
singular good for the same end and purpose.
                  
                  
                     Lupines.
                     LVpines craue no great husbandrie, are good cheape, and doe more good to the
ground than anie other seed: for when as Vineyards and arable grounds are become
leane, they stand in stead of verie good manure vnto them. Likewise, for want
of dung they may be sowne in grounds that stand in need to be dunged, if after they
haue put forth their flowers the second time, they be plowed vnder the ground:
they grow well in a leane ground, and such as is tyred and worne out with sowing:
and they may be sowne in anie ground, especially in stubbly grounds, such as are
not tilled: for in what sort soeuer they be sowne, they will abide the roughnesse of
the ground, and negligence of the husbandman: neither doe they craue anie weeding,
as well in respect of their root, which is single, as also for that if it were
hurt, they would die presently, and because also that it should bee but labour

lost: for they are so farre off from being infected and wronged with weeds, that they
euen kill them, and cause them to die. And this is the cause why manie sowe them in

that which should make them sprout, and that which is remaining, can doe no good:
they must be gathered after raine, for if it should be drie weather, they would fall out
of their cods, and be lost.
                     Lupines are good to feed Oxen in Winter,Wherefore Lupines are good. but they must be steept in salted and
riuer water, and afterward boyled: they serue also for to feed men, to make bread
thereof, when it is a time of dearth of other corne. Some doe note this speciall propertie
in them, which is, that they turne about euerie day with the Sunne: insomuch,
as that by them workmen are taught the time of the day, though it be not cleare and

                     Beanes.
                     BEanes must be sowne in a fat soile, or else a ground that is well manured, and eared
with two earings: and although it be in stubbly grounds, and seated in low
bottomes, vvhither all the fat and substance of the higher parts doth descend; notwithstanding

be sowne: for albeit that amongst all the other sorts of pulse there be not any that
doe so little vvaste and the strength and juice of the earth; notwithstanding they
desire to be vvell and deepe couered vvithin the earth: they must be diligently
vveeded, at such time as they peepe out of the earth, for so the fruit vvill be much
more, and their coddes farre the tenderer. They may be sowne at two times of the
yeare, in Autumne vvhere it is a strong ground, and the beanes be great; and in the
Spring, especially in this Countrie, in a vveake and light ground, the beanes being
but small, and of the common size: those vvhich are sowne in Autumne are more
worth than the other, so that the hindes let not to say, That they had rather eat the
huskes or stalkes of beanes sowne in due time, than the beanes themselues of three moneths
old, because they yeeld more fruit, and haue a greater and better stored graine.
But at what time soeuer you sowe them, you must haue speciall regard to sowe them
all about the fifteenth day after the change of the Moone, because that in so doing,

                        ter loaden, and because they will not be so much assailed of little
vermine, as and if the Moone were new. The day before they be sowne, you must
steepe them in the lees of Oliues, or in water of Nitre, to the end that they may beare
the more fruit, be more easie to boyle, and not to be subiect to be eaten of Weeuils
or Larkes. They must likewise reape and pull them vp in the new of the Moone, before
day, and after leaue them in the ayre to drie, and thresh them out before the full
Moone, and afterward carrie them into the Garner, for being thus ordered, vermine
will not breed in them. Againe, they proue more profitable, being planted, than
sowne, in a good ground, that is well dressed, tilled, fatted, and manured: vvhich
said ground, if it be sowne the yeare following with Wheat, will yeeld a more copious
and plentifull haruest, in as much as Beanes doe fatten a ground more than anie

other kind of Pulse. If you would keep them long, you must sprinkle them with salt
water: but if you meane to boile them, you must bee sure to keep the salt from them,
because salt-water doth harden them: they must not be left in the cold aire, for the
cold also doth make them the harder to boile. To keepe them from being euen of
wormes, they must bee annointed or rubd ouer with oile-oliue, one after another, vntill such time as they be well liquored with this oile. The flowers of Beanes, notwithstanding
that they be of a pleasant and delightsome smell, doe hurt a weake
braine,The cause why there are manie fooles, when Beanes flower. and such a one as is easily carried away and ouercome. And hereupon it
commeth to passe, that there are a great number of fooles, when Beanes are in flower.
                     Thus much for the French experience of Beanes, which doth indeed more concerne
the Garden-Beane, than those which are continually in vse amongst Husbandmen.
Therefore to come to the profit and true knowledge of the husbanding of
Beanes, you shall vnderstand, that they are onely to be sowne in a rich stiffe ground
that is verie fertile, as namely the black or blew clay, for in other earths they 
                           •

a little: and they will grow with one ea
                           •
                        ing onely, which would be done at the beginning
of Ianuarie vpon such earth as hath borne Barly before, or else vpon greeneswarth,
which hath not been plowed long before: it must be plowed deep, and haue
a great furrow turned vp: then you shall let it lye, till it haue taken frost and raine:
then vpon the next faire season, being about or soone after S. Valentines day, you
shall sowe it and harrow it. As for the weeding of Beanes, it is to no purpose; for they
are of themselues so swift of growth, that they will out-grow all weedes. And if they
haue anie Pease mixt amongst them (which should euer be, for it is the surest seed) they will smother vp and destroy all sorts of weedes. They are, because of their vpright
growing, better to be mowne with sythes, than cut to reapt with hookes: they
aske little withering; for so soone as the cod turnes blacke, the stalke dryes. The vse
of them is principally for prouander for Horses, or to mixe with Barley, Wheat, or
Rie, to make bread for hind-seruants, or for hunting or running Horses: but then
commonly they are vsed simply of themselues, or else mixt with Wheat onely: for
the mixture of Barley or Rie is not good for Horses of that nature, except for some
cause physicall, as to keepe them soluble in their bodies, and so forth. The Garden-Beane
is good for men to eat, being boyled and mixt with butter, vineger, and pepper;
or for want of butter, with oyle-Oliue. The cods also are a verie good food, being
boyled whilest they are greene and tender. Lastly, the water which is distilled
from the flowers of Beanes, is good to take away the morphew or spots in men or
womens faces.
                  
                  
                     Small Peason.
                     SMall Pease are no lesse profitable for the fatting of ground that is leane, than Lupines.
It is true that if you looke to haue good store of them, and well-codded,
you must sowe them in fat and warme grounds, and in a temperate and moist time, as
in Februarie or March, and sometime in September, in the increase of the Moone:
and yet it is hard for them to endure and hold out the Winters cold, for they alwaies
desire the full fruition of the Sunne, and doe grow a great deale the fairer, when they
doe enioy it accordingly, and when also they are borne vp to that end on stickes, rather
than let fall flat to the ground, to creepe vpon it: they must be sowne thinne,
because their stalkes doe spread themselues further than anie one other kind of pulse.
They are verie subiect to be eaten within of Wormes: and yet those which are so
eaten of Wormes, are better to sowe than the other which are whole and sound:
For this cause, if you will preuent the Wormes that they may not hurt and hinder
your corne, sowe Peason first in the place. It is true, that for the better growth and
prospering of them, the thicke and grosse seed is most conuenient to be sowne, especially
if it be laid in water to steepe therein a night, because thereby they grow the
more easily, and lose some part of their saltnesse, in being steept, by which meanes

they recouer their naturall verdure againe. They must be gathered in the decrease
of the Moone, presently vpon their being ripe, for else they drie vp, and fall out
of their swads. The earth wherein they are sowne, standeth in need but of one
earing.
                  
                  
                     Cich Peason.
                     CIch Peason doe likewise grow in fat and moist places: they must be sowne in a
rainie time: they doe greatly load and burthen the earth, and for that cause are
neglected of the wiser sort of husbandmen. Notwithstanding, if you will sowe them,
you must steepe them in warme water a day before, that so they may grow and put
forth of the earth the sooner and greater. Some to haue them grow the fairer, doe
steepe them and their cods in nitrous water. To keepe them that passengers and other
folke may not gather them to eate when they are ripe, you must water them fiue
mornings together before the Sunne rise with water wherein haue beene steeped the
seedes of wild Cucumber and Wormewood, and the dew within fiue daies after will
haue taken away all the bitternesse thereof. Such practises are likewise good for to
be vsed about small Peason and Beanes. The vse of them is good for such as are
slow to performe the act of carnall copulation, and especially to carrie away grauell,
and to breake the stone, as also for such as haue weake lungs and low and weake voices.
They are also good against melancholie, and doe cut off troublesome thoughts
and cogitations, and put in place thereof iollie conceits and merrie moodes: and
then they being laid forth in the Moone-shine when it is in the encrease, and before
the Sunne rise, they must be sprinkled with oyle-Oliue, afterward steeped in
warme water, to soften them, and lastly, boyled for to be eaten. The way to vse
them, is rather to suppe vp their broth, made with the rootes of Parsley, than to
eare the Peason.
                  
                  
                     Small Cich Peason.
                     SMall Cich Pease, called of the Latines Cicercula, must be sowne in fat places,
and in a moist time, as in Ianuarie or Februarie: they doe lesse harme to a field
than anie other pulse: but for the most part they neuer come to profit: for when
they are in flower, they cannot abide drowth, nor anie strong Southerne windes, at
such time as they leaue flowring.
                  
                  
                     Great wild Tare, and bitter Fetch.
                     THe great wild Tare and bitter Fetch doe desire leane places, and such as ar
                           •
                        
not moist: for sometimes by putting forth too freely, and growing too much,
they ouerthrow themselues. They may be sowne in Autumne, or in the end of Ianuarie,
and all the moneth of Februarie, but not in March, because if it should be
sowne in this moneth, it would hurt the Cattell, especially Oxen, troubling them
in their braines.
                  
                  
                     Fetches.
                     THere are two seed-times for Fetches: the first, when they are sowne for to feed
cattell, and it is about the fifteenth day of September: the second, in Februarie,
or March, and this is for to make bread of for to eat, being mixt with other corne:
both of them may be sowne in vntilled grounds, but it is better when they are sowne
in grounds that haue had their three earings. This seed loueth not the dew, and
therefore it must be sowne two or three houres after Sunne-rise, when all the moisture
thereof is spent and consumed, either by the wind, or by the Sunne: and it
must not alone be sowne, but it must also be couered the verie same day, because that

if the night should come vpon it, and wet it but a little before it were couered, it
would quickly become corrupt and putrified. The ground wherein it is sowne, needeth
not anie more than one earing, and when it is sowne, it needeth no weeding.
In anie case it must not be sowne before the fifteenth day of the Moone, for otherwise
the Snailes will annoy it. In like manner it must not be sowne neere vnto anie
Vine or Orchard, or anie place where there are trees growing, because it draweth vnto
it the iuice of such plants as be neere it: and yet the Fetch doth not make the
ground leane, but rather fat: and that it is so, appeareth; because that so soone as
the Fetch is taken away out of the fields, there may Peason, Millet, or anie other sort
of Pulse be sowne.
                  
                  
                     Panick.
                     HE that would sow Panick, must make choice of a light, grauellie, sandie, or
stonie ground, and such a one as is situate amongst hills, and on the tops of
hills, and yet whereas there is no little resort of water, for that it being hot by nature,
groweth and putteth forth more easily than Millet. It must be sowne in Summer:
and it groweth so speedily, as that it may be mowen within fortie daies after
that it is sowne. The inhabitants of Gascoigne make bread thereof, but it is verie
vnpleasant, because it is verie short and apt to c

                     Fenugreeke, Cummin, and Mustard-seed.
                     FOr the sowing of Fenugreeke, you must make choice of such ground as you
would for the Fetch, which you must not cut the second time, seeing the first, if
it be done thicke and small, and not deepe, will serue: for if the graine should be couered
aboue foure fingers, it would not be able to sprout and spring vp, and therefore
the plough and harrow both must goe but lightly ouer it. The meale of Fenugreeke,
with Brimstone and Nitre, doth take away the freckles of the face. If you
mingle it with a fourth part of the seedes of Cresses in vineger, it will proue a singular
remedie for the falling of the haire called Tinea. If you boile it in honied water,
putting thereto some Swines grease, it will resolue the swelling of the testicles, hands,
feet, and vnder the eares, and is profitable against the wrenches of ioints. The decoction
thereof drunke oftentimes, doth infinite good to such as haue beene troubled
with an old cough, and likewise for the vlcers of the breast: for the distillations and
rhewmes falling vpon the eyes, you must wet clothes in the decoction of this seed,
and apply them vnto the browes. And as for Cummin and Mustard-seed, wee haue
spoken of them in the second Booke.
                  
                  
                     Medick fodder, or Snaile-clauer.
                     THere is not either anie Pulse or other feeding which is more agreeable or more
precious for the feeding of beasts, than Snaile-clauer, called in French Sainct foin,
for that it may seeme to spring out of the earth, and as it were of a more speciall
fauour from God, not onely for the nourishing and fatting of heards of cattell, but
also to serue for Physicke, for beasts that are sicke, and in that respect it is called of
the Latines Medica. Some call it Burgundie hay, because the Burgundians

of Picardie call it Foinasse, and manie haue giuen it the name of great Trefoile.

                        e is so great, as that euerie casefull
husbandman ought continually to reserue the better part of his grounds, to bee

which hath had three earings before it was sowne, as also which hath beene well
dunged, well harrowed, and digged and delued rather in the decrease of the Moone,
than plowed with the plough, beginning the worke in Iune, afterward in August,
October, December, and Februarie, to the end that the weedes that are in the
ground may bee sufficiently killed, as well by the heate of Summer, at the cold of
Winter. After that you haue made the ground well pleasing, and fit by such industrie,
beginne to sow it in the end of Aprill, during the new of the Moone, and toward
the latter end of the day; for being watered by the dew of the night, it will
spring more speedily and easily out of the earth, than and if it were sowne in the heat
of the day, because it would be burst continually, and would come but to small effect
and profit. You must not bee niggardly in sowing of it: for by how much the
more seed you sow, by so much the more thicke will the grasse grow; neither will
there grow any other grasse there; and so there will also the more profit grow and
rise thereupon to the good house-holder. So soone as it is sowne, you must harrow it
euerie manner of way, as long-waies, broad-waies, and ouer-thwart, with harrowe

to yron: afterward you must water it gently for the first time; for and if you should
water it forcibly, and with aboundant store of water, you should driue the seed all
to one side of the field, and yet you must not water it after September vnto the end
of Aprill. It will be good to cut it downe with a

                         fiue or sixe times the first
yeare, and so proportionably the yeares following; for it endureth ten yeares, yea
thirty as Pliny sayeth, without standing in neede of being sowne againe. The fit
time to cut it downe is May, Iune, Iuly, and August, and the new of the Moone: in
the meane time you shall not let it lye vpon heapes any longer than a day in the meadowes,
for if it should stay there any long time, it would raise such a hear, as that it
vvould smother and kill whatsoeuer were vnder it, to the keeping of it for euer growing
againe: wherefore it will be good to carrie it elsewhere, and to drie it assoone as
possibly may bee, stirring it euerie day, from day to day. Againe, you must not
let the cattell feede neere vnto this grasse, in as much as not their tooth onely, but
their verie breathing on it also is very noysome vnto it, and that so greatly, as that it
afterward becommeth either barren, or else dieth presently: it must not bee giuen
greene for cattell to eate, least it make them sicke by reason of the moisture and heat
that is therein: it must stay till it be drie before you giue it them to eate, and then also
but in small quantitie; for that this grasse begetteth in them such store of blo

husbandman must be carefull to gather and reserue seed of this snaile clauer, to sow
the same vvhen it shall bee requisite: it must not bee gathered the first yeare that it
beareth, by reason of his weakenesse; but in all the other following, and that in the
moneths of Iune and Iuly, so soone as the huskes wherein the seede is contained shall
appeare drie, and the seeds themselues be turned yellow.

beene twice eared: it will be verie good if it be sowne with pilde barley, sometimes
it consisteth of barley, oats, fetches, and fenugreeke, vvhich are let grow hand

                     Rice.
                     IF you will sow rice you may doe it: but it is like to proue rather a worke of curiositie
than of profit; for rice is a commoditie properly belonging and growing amongst
the Indians, from whence also it is brought hither vnto vs in France. Therefore
for the sowing of rice either white or red, chuse out some place that is verie

moist, and in case you haue no such amongst your arable ground, then chuse out
some field that is leane, foule, and nothing well clensed, or some other which is light
and weake, but yet euen, and through which you may conuey some little brooke,
or gutter of water. Eare the ground thrice, where you meane to sow your rice, and
when you haue thus plowed it ouer thrice, sow your rice therein, which you must
first steepe for one whole day in water: so soone as you haue sowne it, draw your littlebrooke
along through it, and there suffer it to continue fiue whole moneths the
depth of two singers: and when as you perceiue the blade to begin to shoot forth
his eare (knowing that it also flowreth and seedeth at the same instant) then double
the quantitie of water to keepe the fruit from blasting or spoyling otherwise. If you
order it thus, you shall not onely reape great quantitie of rice, but you may also
sow it three yeres together one after another, without giuing any rest at all to the
ground, and yet the last yeare will bee no lesse fruitfull than the former: yea, which
is more, you shall make the field more fat, frolicke, in better plight, and cleaner from
weedes, and cleaner from noysome beasts than it was before: yea, and furth

be said rather to puffe vp than to make fat.
                  
                  
                     Hempe.
                     HEmpe must be sowne in fat and well dunged grounds, and watered with some
little brooke, or else in fl

                        t and moist countries, where much labour and
ploughing hath beene bestowed: for the fatter the ground is, the thicker will the
barke or pilling be. It must be sowne in March, and gathered when the seed is ripe,
and afterward dried either in the Sunne, Wind, or Smoake, and then laid in water for
to bee watered, that so the pilling may the more easily depurt from the stalkes, afterward
to be vsed in making of ropes and cloth, a labour and trauaile well beseeming
and fit for women.
                     This is the opinion of the French, but not the generall opinion of the better experienced:
for, the rich ground which is spoken of here to sow hempe in, must
not bee taken for the rich stiffe blacke clay, or for any clay at all: for although they
will beare hempe; yet they put forth so much bunne, and so little pilling, that indeed
the hempe that groweth therein is good for nothing: therefore the best ground
to sow hempe on, is the richest of all mixt earths, whose mould is driest, loosest,
blackest, and quickliest ripe, with little earing, as namely with two ardors at the
most, which vvould be in October the first, and the last in March, which is the
best and most conuenient time for sowing. Hempe must bee exceedingly well
harrowed and clotted, and the mould must bee made as small as dust; for the seed
is verie tender at the first sprouting: but being once gotten aboue the earth, it ou

and destroy them: whence it comes, that hempe neuer needeth any weeding: it must bee diligently and carefully kept and tended (after the first

all small birds, that without great and diligent care they will not leaue you any in the
earth. Now for the best time of gathering your hempe, it is acording to the common
custome of house-wiues, about Saint Margarets day, being towards the latter
end of Iuly: But more particularly, you shall vnderstand that it is best pulling
your hempe for the pill as soone as it doth begin to turne yellowish, and the
leaues to hang downeward looking vnto the earth: but if for seed, then not before
the seed looke blacke, and bee readie to shed: hempe must euer bee pulled

                        rryed to the water to
ripen, of which water the running streame is the best, and the standing pond is the
worst: yet it must bee done with great heed; for hempe is very poysonous, and
it doth not onely infect the waters, but it doth also poyson much fish: Hempe must
lye three dayes and three nights couered in the water; then it must bee cleane washt
out of the water, and afterwards brought home and dried either in the Sunne or
vpon the kilne. There bee some house-wiues, which (either for sloath, or for want
of a conuenient place to water in) doe ripen their hempe vpon the ground, by suffering
it to lye at the least fifteene nights vpon the s

fall Morning and Euening, and other raine by which it ripeneth; prouided that it
bee turned euerie day once: but this manner of ripening is not good; for besides
that it is vnkindly, and doth oftentimes cause the hempe to bee rotten, it also maketh
the hempe to be very blacke and foule; so that it doth neuer make white cloth.
After the ripening and drying of your hempe, you shall brake it in brakes which
are made of wood for the same purpose, and this labour would euer as neere as you
can bee done in the Sunne-shine: after the braking of hempe, you shall swingle it,
then beate it, then heckle it: and if you intend to haue verie fine cloth of it, you
shall after the first heckling, beate it againe, and then heckle it through a finer heckle,
then spinne it, after warpe it, and lastly weaue it. Thus much for the hempe
which is vsed for to make cloth withall: but for such as shall bee preserued for
cordage, or the roper, you shall onely after the ripening pill it, and then either sell
or imploy it.

rootes of the male hempe, and of the same so burnt and made into powder, do make
gunne-powder. The iuice or decoction of the greene herbe being strongly strained,
and powred in some place where there are earthwormes, doth cause them to come
forth by and by: likewise being dropt into the eares, it causeth the worms or other
beastes which shall bee gotten in thither to come out presently, and this wee haue
learned of fishermen, which by this wile doe take wormes to serue them for their
hookes. Hempe seede must neither bee eaten nor drunke, because it sendeth vp many
fumes vnto the braine, which will cause the same to ake▪ and therefore women do
greatly transgresse the rules of Physicke, which giue this bruised seed in drinke, to

at in hempe, that seeing there are two sorts of it, the male and the female, yet the
female beareth not the seed, but the male.

this followeth and is caused by reason of the seede which impaireth all sorts
of grounds verie much, and for that cause it must bee sowne in a verie fat ground,
and such a one also as it reasonably moist. In any case the ground where line-seed is
sowne, must bee curiously handled and clensed, and with manifold earings plowed
and turned ouer so oft and so long, as that it become like dust: and furthermore the
good hus-wife must be carefull when the line is growne, to free it from being

and that not once but oft: to the end that in gathering the seed, in beating it with
beetles, heckling and spinning of it, such filth may not remaine among the tow. It
must be gathered when it is ripe, and when the colour of it groweth yellow, and after
layd vp in some drie place, that so it may bee defended from the raine and dew,
which are vtter enemies vnto it: when it is drie, it must be thresht as soone as may be
(to the end that the mice eat it not) with wooden mallets, to get the seed out of it,
and presently after that it shalbe caried to the water about the change of the Moone,
that it may lie therein three or foure daies in Iuly or August, till it become soft and
tender, to the end that the pilling or barke thereof may the more easily be seperated
from the stalkes for the making of cloth. When it is drawne out of the water, it must
bee laied on a heape, all round, but two or three fadomes broad, loading it aboue
with boords and stones, and after that spred in the Sunne, to the end it may drie the
better. The finest line, which is without seed (notwithstanding it bee the least and
lower of growth than the rest) is the best, being soft and fine after the manner as
it were of silke: whereas that which is long and thicke, is also more rough, and boysterous

it in the Sunne, that it may drie, neuer casting it into any heapes, for that which is
laid vpon heapes after the comming of it out of the water, that it may take a heat,
and being pressed downe to that end, doth become blacke, and turneth into a darke
and obscure colour.
                     This line after it hath receiued braking and the first hackling, you shall take

and put it into a smooth and round trough made for the purpose: in the same
manner as you beate hempe, so you shall beate this flaxe till it handle as soft as
any silke, then vnplat the strickes againe, and heckle it through the second heckle,
the which must bee much finer than the first: which done, plat vp the strickes againe,
and then beat it the second time, and then vnplat as before, and heckle it the

the heckle, you shall haue a great and diligent care to keepe them light and loose;
for by reason of the much beating, they will bee exceeding soft, and apt to clotter
together, and abide in lumpes, and in the drawing of the thred, it will handle
very woollie: yet bee well assured, that from the first hurds, you shall make a

drying of it, letting it stand each seuerall time at the least foure and twentie

beene oftentimes turned and cast, harrowed, and dunged; for by these meanes they
will not onely grow well, but the ground (after that they be gathered being thus prepared)
will bring forth fairer corne. Turneps are sowne twice in the yeare, in Februarie,
and in August, in a well manured ground, and you may not suffer them, after
that they haue gotten some little growth, to put vp any further out of the earth, for
and if they should still grow more and more aboue the earth, their root would become

                  Aduertisements concerning corne and pulse.
                  
                     WIse and prudent husbandmen must not plow their groundes, cut their
vines, or prune or haue any dealing about trees from the eighteenth
day of Nouember vnto the seuen and twentieth of December.
                  Sow your corne as soone as you can, and stay not to sow it in the Winter:
Neither doe you euer sow the corne which grew in a fat soile, whether it bee
wheat or rie, or any other such, in a leane and barren field; but rather sow that corne
in a fat and fertile soile, which grew in a leane and barren ground: and to be briefe,
sow in a well conditioned ground that which was growne in an ill conditioned
ground. In sowing your seed see that your hand auswere your foot, and standing vpon
your feet, see that your right foot especially be moued when your right hand doth
moue. In sowing of wheat you must cast it with a full hand, or by handfuls: but in
sowing barely, rie, oats, and many other kindes of graine, especially such as is shut
vp in huskes, as millet, pannicke and rape seed, must be sowne and cast into the earth
with onely three fingers.

as is sowne in cold grounds, as those which are most subiect vnto frosts, you must
cast and spread lime vpon the said grounds before they besowne: or else, which is
better, mingle a sixt or eight part of lime amongst the corn which you meane to sow,
and so sow them together.

lay them a day before they bee sowne, in water vvherein there hath beene nitre dissolued;
or else to mingle amongst them in fowing of them some dung and nitre: and
if notwithstanding after all these meanes vsed, they cannot yet be well boyled, then
put into the pot wherein they are boyling, a little mustard seed, and in a short time
they will relent and seeth in peeces.
                  Beanes being sowne neere trees, cause their roots to drie and wither: beanes will
keepe long if you water them with sea water▪ notwithstanding that they will not
boile any thing at all in salt or sea water.

                     IN vaine should the husbandman toyle himselfe in tilling his ground so
carefully according to the forme and manner which we haue before described,
and in like carefull sort to gather in, heape together and keepe

                     , as
whereby there redoundeth vnto him an incredible summe of money. Witnesses in
this point may be the infinite number of rich husbandmen in France, and namely
in Beauce, Brie, and Picardie, who liue in better estate and fuller of money, than
many great Seigneours and Gentlemen: and I referre my selfe likewise vnto the diuers
sorts of bread which they make of their corne, for the feeding and sustaining
of themselues and their families, as also their cakes, cheese-cakes, custards, flawnes,
tartes, fritters, and a thousand other prettie knackes and daintie conceits, which may
be made and wrought of the meale which their corne yeeldeth. And yet further I
report me to the beere, (which standeth in steed of wine in the countries where the
vine cannot beare fruit) made commonly with wheat and barley. And lastly to the
sale of bread which hee may practise and vse euery day, whithout any whit disaduantaging
himselfe; as wee see in the husbandmen of Gonesse neere to the Citie of

                     ANd to the intent that I may enter into my purposed matter of the Bake-house,
I doe not here intend to crie or search out, who was the first inuenter of Bread-making,
or what meates were in vse amongst them of auncient time, before the making
of Bread was found out, or whether it was the man or womans labour to play
the Baker: these I leaue to such as make their whole profession that way, to discourse
of; contenting my selfe to teach and instruct my Farmer what graine or corne hee
may imploy and vse for the making of bread. For certaine there may be bread made

corne of France, because that Brie is a countrie of sweet cherries▪ and yet notwithstanding
it is found, that the countrie properly and truely called Brie doth surpasse
and goe beyond the two other in massinesse of corne: and the cause making it so▪ to
be, is the shortnesse and thickenes of the skin thereof, which is euidently more apparant
in it than in the rest, which make it to weigh the more. The corne of Picardie
is of a lesse graine than any of the other three aforesaid, and so the bread of this
corne is not so good, great, white, or profitable: because that this corne is more hard,
stiffe, stubborne, and vneasie to grind than the others, and therefore such as out of
which the flower cannot be well drawne, which causeth men commonly to call the
corne of Picardie more vile and filthie than the rest, seeing when it is ground, the
bran thereof detaineth and keepeth backe of the flowre within it. Champaigne notwithstanding
that it flow and abound with corne, and make a verie faire and great
shew, yet it is inferiour vnto the other aforesaid countries; because the corne thereof
yeeldeth lesse bread than the others, because naturally it is giuen to be choking, and

grosse, hard, small or soft. Yet the lesse the corne is bruised the finer the meale will
be, and the grosser your branne is, the better and vvhiter will your paste be: vvhence
it comes that the skilful Baker wil euer chuse the great black Cullen stones to grinde
his fine Wheat vpon, which no more but bruising, and, as it were, crushing the corne
makes the meale as pure and as vvhite as Snow. As for the drinesse or danknesse of
corne, it is certaine that no graine, except Wheat, can be too drie, but that the skilfull
Miller sayes should euer sticke to the Hopper: vvhence it comes that he will, vvhen
he findes his Wheat too drie, dash or sprinkle some vvater vpon it, which makes it
grinde a great deale the better, and makes the meale much vvhiter.

thing but that vvhich commeth of the corne vvhen it is ground: and so the
meale falleth out to be such as the corne was, that is to say, very vvhite, if so bee that

so called) is, blacke and full of bran: if the corne were starued, small, wrinckled,

                           e. such is the meale of Rie. But the husbandman before
the grinding of his corne and turning of it into meale, must thinke with himselfe
vvhether he will keepe it long or no: such as he vvill not keep, there is no need vvhy
he should care of what corne he causeth it to be ground, as vvhether it be old or new
threshed, neither yet how and in what maner: but such as he doth entend to keep for
some time, as in a store-house for to answer the times of necessitie, hee must chuse the
driest corne that he can meet vvithall, because that if it be not verie drie, it might verie
quickly take heat in the meale; and so it is meete that it should bee old threshed
and not new, and comming from the sheafe (although the bread that is made of corne
old threshed be not so good as that which is made of new threshed corne, and that
vvhich commeth fresh from the sheafe) for the meale that commeth of corne olde
threshed &amp; reserued a long time in the garner, keepeth better than that vvhich commeth
of new threshed corne, because that the corne being driuen and laide naked
from his first and vtmost huske and coate, taketh the aire, as also his vndermost couering
vvherewith it is couered, and so groweth drier and harder, not only in his coate,
but also in the meale and marrow inclosed therein. Whereupon it commeth to passe
that this meale being left naked and voide of any coate by the grinding of the Mill,
becommeth more apt to keepe in being the more drie. On the contrarie, the meale of
new threshed corne, is not of so good continuance, but spoileth sooner, because that
the corne new threshed, retaining yet his natiue moisture, maketh the meale the more
moist and heauie, and that it can not be so drie: vvhereupon it falleth out to be more
inclinable and readie to corrupt. For euen as drinesse doth preuent and hinder putrifaction,
so moisture doth hasten and help forward the same. And that it is so, vve see
by experience, that the painfull husbandmen for the good keeping of their corne, do
leaue it in the sheafe mowed vp in the Barne, there to Winter and sweate, causing it
after such sweate to be threshed, that so they may shift it out of its place into another
that is more drie, and laying vp higher in a more open ayre: vvhere being laide and
gathered together in heapes, after a long and not high raised manner, he diligently
bestirreth himselfe to cause it to be remoued from place to place, that so it may take
the aire by little and little, but especially to ayre that vvhich lieth vnderneath, by
laying it about: vvherefore it is not to be doubted but that the meale vvhich is made
of corne that hath beene thus ordered in the Garner, is of much better continuance
than that vvhich is of corne comming newly out of the sheafe. Besides, the husbandm
                           •
                        n
must giue in charge (if so be hee vvould haue his meale to keepe long) to the
Miller, to grinde his corne somewhat grosse: for if it be ground fine, it is not possible
for him to keepe it so long in good state and condition. Notvvithstanding, for the

well keeping of all sorts of meale, whether it bee of corne new or old threshed, you
must make choice of the highest roome of all your dwelling place, whether it bee
towre, towne, or towne-house, and being placed there as in a store-house, it shall bee
let rest full fifteene daies, to relieue and ease it selfe of the trauell which it hath had in
the grinding: after which time of rest, for the better and longer keeping of it, it will
be needfull to change it oft from one place to another, and by this meanes it will be
kept a whole halfe yeare, and being often remoued and changed from one place to
another, it will bee increased a fift or sixt part at the least, o
                           •
                         which, notwithstanding,
there cannot be made so good bread, as of the meale that is newly ground. And
thus much for the farmers duetie about baking, which consisteth in chusing the
corne, causing it to bee ground, and laying vp of the meale in some garner, either to
bee kept, or to be presently vsed about the making of bread. The ordering of the
meale, and making of the bread belongeth vnto the house-wife, according to the custome
of the auncient Romans, amongst whom, the women of speciall note and account
did worke and knead the meale, and made bread with their owne, hands, as
Plutarch reporteth in his Problemes. The house-wife then being possessed of so
much meale in the garner, shall goe about to doe her indeauour to make bread: but
before she beginne to make it, she shall seperate the finer part thereof from the grosser,
with some temze, searce, or bolter, to the end that of these seuerall sorts of meale,
she may make seuerall sorts of bread: the finest part of the meale is called the flower
of meale, and of the Latins Pollen, whereof the pasterers or cookes for pastrie doe
make wafers, and such like daintie knackes: the grossest part is the brane, called of
the Latins Furfur, which commeth of the coat or huske cleauing next vnto the narrow
and kernell of the corne. Betwixt the flower of the meale and the bran, there are
yet other parts of the meale, more or lesse fine, or more or lesse grosse, according to
the widenesse or narrownesse of the temze or bolter through which they passe, and
according to the difference and diuersitie of these parts, there are made different and
diuers sorts of bread, that is to say, more or lesse white, according to the taking forth
of two, three, or foure parts of the bran, by the helpe and meanes of the bolter: besides
these parts and seuerall sorts, there is yet another sort of meale, which is called
mill-dust,Mill-dust. and this riseth vp from the corne, as it is vpon the mill, grinding vnder the
mill-stone, but hereof there is no vse for bread, the millers vse to sell it onely for the
vse of booke-binders and gold-smiths, to make their pastewithall: there is yet another
kind of meale, which the Italians call Semole, which is fine meale, or course
flower, called of the Latins Simila, or Similago, whereof wee haue spoken before:
Wee haue it not in this countrie, it is brought vnto vs from Italy and Naples, neither
doe men vse to make bread with this, but either thicken their meat-broths, or else
make pap-meat. It is as fine as the flower of meale, but not so white, notwithstanding,
hauing a colour halfe like the straw colour: It is of a very good iuice and no

There is yet further another sort of very white meale, that is very fine,
which is commonly called in French Amydon, and of the Greeks and Latins Amylon,
as though it were made without mill-stones. It hath heretofore beene made diuers
waies, but in this countrie they vse to make it in this sort: They chuse the faire

                     Leauen.
                     LEauen, called in Latine Fermentum, because it puffeth vp, and swelleth in continuance
of time, is a lump of paste left of the last masse of dough, couered and hidden
in the meale vvhich is kneaded, to take away the clamminesse and cleauing propertie
vvhich is in the meale that is purposed to bee made into bread. This Leauen
becommeth sowre by continuance of time, and thereby maketh the bread more
delightsome, and of a more pleasant taste. Againe, vve see that bread, by how much
the more Leauen it hath, by so much the more vvholsome and vvell relishing it is, ouer
and aboue that vvhich hath lesse store of Leauen in it. It is indifferently hote,
and a little cold: hot by reason of the putrifaction vvhich it is cast into, and cold by
the nature of the meale. This Leauen is made diuers sorts of vvayes, according to
the manners and fashions of countries: wee make it of Wheat paste to make Wheat
bread, and of Rie paste to make Rie bread: some put vnto it Salt, some Vineger, and
many Verjuice made of Crabbes. The workers in Pastrie do vse the rising of Beere
to make their Wigges vvithal, as vve shal haue further occasion to speak of it in laying
open the vvay to make Beere. People of old and auncient times did make it diuers
vvayes, as Plinie reporteth. The Flemings do mightily boile their Wheate, and
take off the scumme that riseth thereof in boiling, which they let grow thick, and vse
the same in stead of Leauen: and that is the cause vvhy their bread is a great deale
lighter than ours. Howsoeuer it is, the Leauen vvhich men-bakers and vvomen-bakers
doe vse to make their bread vvithall, may bee kept fifteene daies and not any
more because after such time it corrupteth and decayeth. But to be sure▪ it is not good
to keepe it so long: for to keepe it you must vvorke it vp into a round paste, couer and
hide it ouer in meale; and besides, in vvinter it must be couered ouer withgood store
of clothes in the kneading trough. When the good vvife of the house is purposed to
bake her paste, she must two or three dayes before, or, vvhich is better, ouer night,
kneade in her said Leauens vvith hote vvater, or else with cold, according to the time
and diuersitie of the corne, vvhereof she meaneth to make her bread, as we will speake
further of by and by. The vvorkers in paste-meates doe vse but verie little Leauen
in their crusts, or none at all, either because it vvould make so small a quantitie of paste
as they vse to make their crusts of, too sowre, or else because the Leauen vvould draw
vnto it all the Butter, or such other fat as they should mingle amongst their paste, for
as much as Leauen hath the power to draw moisture vnto it, as vvee may easily proue
by Apostumes, vvhich vvhen we vvould haue to ripen and swell vp higher, vvee vse
to applie a paister of Leauen to them. Furthermo
                           •
                        e, if it should happen that
the Baker, or good vvife of the house should finde her Leauen too sowre, and that she
cannot come by any other, the remedie must be to knead her Leauen with hotter water
than she would if it vvere in its proper nature and kinde, that so by the heate of
the vvater the Leauen may recouer some strength, and somewhat renew its naturall
force, hauing lost its naturall heat, vvhereas on the contrarie, vvhen the Leauen is in
its kind and as it should be, there is not any thing but cold water to be vsed about it.
                  
                  
                     
                     The making of bread according to the diuersitie of corne
whereof it is made.

                           •
                        e and condition of the meale whereof she maketh it: wherefore if shee
dwell in Beauce,Bread of corne growing in Beauce. or dwelling out of Beauce, do make her bread of the corne growing
in Beauce (the meale of which corne for certaintie, holdeth the chiefe and principall
place of account amongst all the sorts of meale of France) she shall be carefull in any
case, to make her leuens at certaine and well appointed houres: In Sommer she
shall refresh her leuen vvith cold vvater at noone day, and renew it againe at fiue a
clocke, and lastly at nine, without failing of keeping these houres in very precise
manner: This water thus vsed in Sommer must be drawne fresh out of the Well,
or from the fountaine and riuer, because that Well vvater as it is more heauy than the
other, so it maketh the bread more heauy: and on the contrarie, spring vvater, or
vvater from the riuer, as it is lighter, so it maketh lighter bread. In Winter she must
renew her leuen with fresh vvater vvarmed or made hot: and with this water both
Winter and Sommer, she shall vvet her armes, and knead her paste throughly, turning
it ouer and ouer, hither and thither, on euerie side, for a long space and many
times, that so all the parts thereof may shew that she hath been there, and that all the
clamminesse and cleauing qualitie of the same may be throughly broken and dried
vp, that so the bread may be the more short and finer in chawing, and not eating like
paste in the teeth, mouth, and stomach. After such handling of it, she shall take the
pains to turne her paste oftentimes, that so it become not leuen, for otherwise it would
not eate so well. It is true that when the leuen is faultie, the meale of the corne of Beauce
hath such a band and list as that she might easily couer and hide such fault, prouided
that the baker whether man or woman, at the kneading therof would but help
it a little with some fresh vvater.
                     If the farmers wife do dwell in France,Bread made of the corne of France. or make bread of the corne growing sometime
in France, she shall not vse so much leuen thereunto as she did vnto the meale
made of the corn growne in Beauce, both because the corne commeth short in yeelding
like quantitie of paste, for like quantitie of corne, as also because the meale hath
not so good a band, neither yet is it altogether so clammie: and therefore you must
vse a meane and reasonable measure in your leuen, and withall let your water be lesse
hot, than in the kneading of Beauce meale; for if you knead it vvith vvater that is
more hot than needeth, the paste will swell vp the more a great deale, and afterward
vvill drie out of all reason.
                     To make bread of the corne that was growne in Brie,Bread made of the corne of Brie. you must vse a quite other
manner of order, because that countrie corne is much more churlish than that of
France or Beauce: the first flower that commeth out of huske or skin of the said corn,
is better bound than the others, because the corne is shorter, and so hangeth in the
bolter as doth the oatmeale, contrarie to the nature of other corne, in as much as the
said oatemeale is sweeter than the other sorts of corne, which causeth that the bolter
letteth some small quantitie of meale somewhat roundly ground to crosse it ouerthwartly,
and that may bee the second

                        e that the
bread should the sooner bee baked in the ouen: but the hardnesse and heauinesse of
the meale is the cause that it is so hard to bake: as also there may be ioined thereto for
another reason, the crust that groweth vpon the same presently; for it is a meanes to
hinder the heate of the ouen, that it cannot enter into the inward parts of the bread

so easily as it should: and this is the cause that maketh the bread to bee alwaies as it
were 
                           •

                     The meale of the corne of Champaigne craueth a newer made leuen when it is
to be made into bread,Bread made of the corne which was growne in Campaigne. because it hath a smatch of the earth, which would make it to
be become worse in past, if it should not haue added vnto it such leuen as were excellent
good, as also for that the corne comming out of the sheafe, doth smell of the
ground whereon it grew, and this cannot be amended without great diligence vsed,
and care had in the making of the bread.
                     Besides these breads made of these seuerall cornes, you shall vnderstand that generally
the breads which are most in vse are first the manchet, which is the finest of all
other, and is made of the purest and best part of the meale finely bolted or searst,
and made light with barme onely, and not with leuen, neither must it be made too
light or spungie, but of a good solide temper, 
                           •
                        irme and fast wrought: the next to
it is fine cheate bread, which is made of the next meale to the finest, and brought
onely to differ through the coursnesse of the boulter, which being a little wider
than the first giues more libertie to the meale to passe away and goe neerer to the
branne: this must be made light both with leuen and barme, yet very well wrought
and made altogether as firm as the manchet: the next to this is course cheate bread,
the which is made of the coursest meale as being boulted as cleane from the branne
as it can possibly be got, and the boulter which is for this purpose must bee a course
searse or a fine temze: this bread must be made light with leuen onely, neither is it
much materiall how spungie or open it appeares; for this kind of bread is euer to be
puft vp and made to appeare in as great quantitie as possible it may bee: the last
sort of bread is that which is made for pessants or hinde seruants, and it is made
of meale vnboulted, the branne and the meale being all knodden together, and
in this case your meale would bee ground as fine as is possible. There be some
that after they haue ground their meale grosse, and boulted out the manchets,
they will then send that which is remaining to the mill againe, and haue it newly
ground ouer againe as fine as it possible may bee, and of it they make this course
hindes bread: and of a certaintie it is a well allowed husbandrie; for thereby you
shall reape a double commoditie. This bread some mixe with leuen, some doe not:
but certainly the leuen is best, for it giues vnto the bread a pleasant and delightsome
tast, whereas the other wanting the same hath a very rough, waterish and vnwholesome
tast, and it is onely profitable in this, that a man not taking any delight
to eat it, it will last a great deale the longer: this bread would be bakt in great loaues,
and that somewhat hard also.
                     Meslin thriueth not so well,Bread made of meslin. as not yeelding so much when it is made in bread: it
is by nature fat, as also the meale thereof being boulted: it is no easie thing to pull
out ones hands when they are in kneading of it: the good huswife that hath not bin
acquainted to worke in this kind of corne, doth find herselfe much incumbred therwith,
and that in part, because the better part of the meale vseth to stay behind with
the bran; and therefore for the profit of the house it were better to bolt the meale of
rie and mes
                           •
                        in, than to sift it, because the bolter with the working of the arms, doth
cause the bran to let go the meale that is within it, which is more than either the pocket
or searce will do, because they make no mouing or stirring of the meale, but from
one place to another.
                     The paste therefore being well kneaded, shifted, and prepared, as need requireth,
it must be parted into round peeces, of reasonable greatnes &amp; thicknes, to be set in
the ouen made reasonably hot, euen in such sort as that the bread may (according to
the greatnesse, thicknesse, &amp; qualitie of the paste) be sufficiently baked: for a weightie
and thicke loafe of paste made of the corne of Picardie, would haue a longer and
greater baking than a small loafe, and that made of the corne of Beauce or France. If
the ouen be too hot, the crust will bee scorched, and within it will remaine raw and
vnbaked, the heat not being able to enter and pierce to the inner parts, the crust that
is so hard dried vpon it being a let thereunto.

conueniently afford.

abide in a place that is neither stinking nor vnsauourie, nor yet infected with any euil
aire; for the hote bread doth easily draw and sucke in any vehemous or corrupt
qualitie of the aire. In moist places bread doth soone become hoarie and sustie: and
in too drie a place it becommeth mouldy and ranke. The good husband that is right
carefull of his profit to the end that his bread may last the longer, and that they may
eate the lesse of it, doth set it in some celler or place which is vnder the ground,
or in some other place which is moist: and his rie bread in some place neere vnto the

                  Of the Pantrie.
                  
                     IT is most certaine that bread is the chiefest thing whereby man is fed and
nourished: and that it is so, we see that other victuals, how pleasant soeuer
they be vnto the tast, how vvel soeuer prepared and set out with good
sauces, do (for the most part of them) cause very oft a distast and loathing
of themselues; but onely bread holdeth out without dislike growing therupon whether
it be in sicknes or in health, it is the thing which appetite doth last of all refuse,
and first like of and receiue againe in time of sickenes: in health it is the beginning
and ending of our meat, very pleasant and delightsome with all kind of meats. In like
manner of a certainty bread is by a maruellous benefit of nature endued with all sorts
of tastes and relishes, which particularly are the prouocations and allurements causing
vs to affect and eate this or that or any kind of meate whatsoeuer. Some whereof
do please vs by reason of their sweetnes, other some by reason of their sowernes,
some by reason of their saltnesse, and other some by reason of their sharpnesse, and
some by reason of their pleasant smell: and all these well pleasing relishes, making
sauourie vnto vs all other sorts of meate, doth bread containe and comprehend in
it selfe. Againe other victualls, haue they neuer so good a taste, can neither bee
pleasant nor profitable for the health in eating, if bread bee not eaten with them,
in as much as the bread by its owne good nature doth correct the faults that are in
other meates, and maketh them stronger and of more power in their properties and

qualities: and hereupon grew the common prouerbe, which is that all meat is good
and profitable, when it is accompanied with bread. Againe we find by daily obseruation,
that such as eate their meate, whether it bee flesh or any such sort
of victualls without bread, haue alwaies a stinking breath; so that I cannot but greatly maruell

reason of much solide and firme nourishment which it bringeth vnto the bodie, if it
happen to be eaten in excessiue quantitie) doth fill the veines with aboundant store of
bloud, but such as is not apt to flow and stirre, and such as is not apt and easie to bee
euaporated and discussed, being giuen to endure and continue like solide things in a
constant and stayed course: of the which bloud all the bodie being nourished, is
made more corpulent, full and massie; and so by reason of this fulnesse the lesse perspirable,
because the pores and passages of the skinne, by the which the whole bodie
should haue meanes for the breathing out of his superfluous vapours, are stopt;
and thereby the bodie made subiect vnto many diseases, and sodaine death: such was
the issue ordinarily befalling professed Wrastlers, and that as we may gather by
reading, procured and wrought especially in those men, by vsing of much bread and
swines flesh. And I will further confesse (as Galen teacheth vs) that of all the errors,
and inconueniencies hapning to the health, through the bad digestion and ill
concoction of the stomach, those are the most grieuous, which grow of the ill digesting
of bread, rather than where flesh or such meat are badly digested, because
that bread doth more trouble nature and is a longer time in digesting. But all this notwithstanding
there is no cause, why bread should not still bee preferred before all
other sorts of victualls, seeing these discommodities arise not of the meane &amp; reasonable
vse, but of the excessiue vse rather of the same, which is the high way to 
                        〈◊〉

by the superfluousnesse of humours, which may rather bee accounted for a vertue
and commendation vnto it, than any dispraise: but the further discourse of this matter
I leaue for another place. Seeing then the life of men consisteth more in the vse
of bread than of all other things, who so is carefull of his health and life, must make
choice of his bread, according as his substance, calling, and naturall disposition shall
direct and guide him.

manner such bread fitteth them best, which hath no leuen in it, is not much baked,

of great states: but such bread must not be made of the intire meale of rie, but such

as is well sifted: and it must beare the colour of waxe, and bee new baked; for that
which is old groweth sowre, and looseth his pleasant smel. The women of Lyonnois,
to the end they may be faire and haue a fresh colour, and solide and substantiall bodies,
do vse no other bread but such as is made of rie. Such as are much altered and
changed, in steed of ptisanes, cidre, beere, or any other such drinke, may drinke of
breaded water, that is to say, water wherein rie bread hath beene well beaten and laboured.
                  Bread made of barley meale only is verie dry, easie to crumble away, and of very
small nourishment, and therefore fitter to loosen the bellie than to feed or nourish, by
vertue and force of a detergent facultie, wherewith barley is greatly furnished: And
this is the cause why at Rome this kind of bread is made no account of, as for to be
vsed of men, leauing it as a food for cattell, or else in reproch, for faint-hearted and
dastardly souldiers; for it was vtterly forbidden for euer being set before such as were
valiant and couragious in fight, because of the small quantitie of nutritiue parts or
nourishment that is in it. It is true that many do imagine that the vse of barley bread
doth make them lesse subiect vnto the gout: contrarie to that which Aristotle saith
in his Problemes, That bakers and such as vse baking are weakned thereby; but yet
more than the rest, such as vse to handle and worke much in barley stuffe. The thing
I leaue to be tried by the sequell.
                  Oaten bread is not commended, both because the imploying of oats that way were
to rob cattell of their due food and prouander (a great argument of famine) as also
because such bread is of an vnpleasant taste. It is better to vse oatmeale made of oats
freed from their huske, as we haue said before in the treatise of pottage vsed either in
flesh time, or in the time of Lent.
                  Bread made of millet and panicke is very common in Bearne and Gascoigne, not
only amongst the vulgar sort, but also in the houses of great Lords; but these do vse
it rather for daintinesse sake, or for want of a good stomach, than otherwise: it is verie
drie, light, and easily crumbling, and so fit for to drie vp a stomach and bodie that
is very moist. It is pleasant in tast when it is new and well baked, especially when it
is eaten comming hot out of the ouen, for then it tasteth and eateth with a maruellous
pleasant sweetnesse: Likewise in countries where such bread is made account of, the
bakers carry it presently after it is drawne into the towne, and cry hot millet bread
hot; but after it is become hard, it looseth all his grace.
                  Bread made of pure and cleane meslin, is very good to be eaten according to the
mediocritie of the substance thereof, in such sort as that many compare it with the
bread made of Similago, which was in old times the best and most excellent wheat
that was.
                  There is no regard to be made of the bread made of the bran which commeth of
the meale,Bread of bran. that hath its flower taken from it, and is commonly called meale bran: it
is better to leaue it for the hounds or sheepherds dogs, or such as serue for the keeping
and watch of the house.
                  In England and other places they make a great and profitabe vse of this meale,
as namely, a certaine bread which they call horse-bread, and is so generall among
them, that you shall not find an Inne, Ale-house or common Harbour, which doth
want the

                     me: how excellent good and wholesome it is for horses, I will not boast,
because the bran is naturally hot and burning of it selfe, and breeds many inflammations
and hot diseases amongst horses: yet certaine it is, it will feed much, and for trauelling
horses it is a good food, and well allowable during their labour or time of
trauelling: but in their time of rest not so good nor wholesome, especially, that which
is of the common or worse sort; for you must vnderstand that there be two kinds of
this common horse-bread: the first kind of it, is that which is made of Branne or
Chyssell onely, and knoden with cold water, without any mixture of other meale
with it more than that which they mould it in, which seemeth onely to bind the chissell
together, which otherwise would fall in sunder: the other kind of bread is,
when they take two bushells of Branne or Chissell, and adde vnto it one bushell of

beane or pease meale, and

are moulded, to roule them in spelted beanes crusht and brused in a mill, and so bake
it well: This bread is not altogether so vnwholesome as the former, and may very
wel serue to feed horses with all the yere; for it is both hartie and strong, only a little
too heauie, which maketh it hard of disgestion, and so more hurtfull to horses of tender
stomaches, or such as want exercise, which is the onely meanes of speedy

that by ouer much and long baking the crust is not scorched, not the sweet iuyce

                     BRead is diuersly vsed: but the two most common waies are to eat it either alone,
or with other meates, whereunto it serueth not onely, as wee haue said before, in
steed of a sauce that is full pleasant and delightfull: but also to correct their vices
and faults if they haue any, and to helpe and strengthen their properties and vertues,
in so much that all meate is wholesome and healthfull, if it bee accompanied
with bread. Sometimes it is tosted being cut into diuers thin shiues, for to eate after
all other meate, for the drying of the stomach that is too moist, and to hinder especially
in fat folkes, that the meat which they haue taken, be not so sodainely dispersed
into all the seuerall parts of the bodie. Some say likewise, that tosted bread being
often eaten, doth make fat folkes leane, and consumeth such flegme as may be gathered
in the stomach: and being eaten all drie, in a morning fasting, it likewise drieth
vp and stayeth all manner of rhumes and humours falling or gathered into any
part or member whatsoeuer. This is the cause why Physitians appoint bisket bread
for such as are troubled with rheumes and distillations. Some v

                     Washed breadWashed bread▪
                         is a meate very profitable for the health, in as much as it giueth a
light kind of nourishment vnto the bodie, without making of any obstructions:
and this because the washing of it doth wholly take away the heauines and clammines
belonging vnto the earthie parts thereof, and so maketh it light and altogether
airie: That this is true, you shall find by experience, because that if you cast it
into the water it swimmeth a loft like a peece of corke; and againe, if you weigh it
after that it is washed, you will wonder at the lightnes of it; for indeed you shall find
it not to be so heauie by the halfe. Old men of auncient time did cut it in slices, and
washing it in water, made great account of it in sharpe agues and such other diseases,
because it is of smal and light nourishment, according as is required in such sicknesses:
and in these dayes we make no lesse account of it, saue that we vse not to wash
it in water, but in the broath of meate, as of veale or capon possibly, because of the
daintines of this age, or else for the parties feeblenes sake, which (it may bee) falleth
out to be greater than it was in the bodies of those which liued long a goe. In steed of
this washed bread, we vse a sort of bread which we call Panade, or a cooling bread,
which is thus prepared: They take and crumble small the crummie part of a white
loafe, not new, but old baked, or they grate it very small, after which they steepe it
certaine houres in warme water, or in cold water, changing the same three or foure
times, and in the end boyling it at a small-coale fire in an earthen pot, with buttered
water, or some other fat put thereto. They that will make it after a finer fashion,
steepe it, and boile it in some capon broth, or the broth of a pullet, or some other
such like meate, stirring it a long time and oft with a spoone: this Panade is good
for such as are troubled with long diseases, as also for such as are in health, but are
troubled with crudities vpon their stomach, of what cause soeuer they come, as also
for them that haue but bad digestion; but chiefly good for such as by exquisite diet
do go about to cure the pox. This Panade doth not heat as bread doth of it selfe, not
being washed, or prepared thus in Panade. The meale of Amydon made in bread
or pap-meat, doth nourish in like manner that Panade doth. Wee haue set downe
before how Amydon is to be made. Young children that sucke in like manner may

be fedde with Panade, and it is a great deale better meat for them than the

accustomed to be made them with Cowes milk and Wheat flower, because that such
pap-meate causeth infinite obstructions, feauers, headach and wormes.
                     Some vse the meale of certaine sorts of corne, and of many sorts of Pulse, after the
manner of pap-meate, as we haue alreadie said vvhen vve spake of mundified Barley,
which is a thing so highly commended of auncient Physitions. But besides such manner
of preparing of it, as vvee haue alreadie deliuered in the Chapter of mundified
Barley, these two following may seeme vnto me to be most excellent: boile your Barley
in a great deale of vvater, as it were almost to the consumption of the water; gather
the creame that is vppermost, and take it with a spoone, and make ther
                           •

and boile it in a great quantity of water, the space of fiue or

                         houres, afterward draw
the bagge out of the pot, and let it drop, and straine it in a presse: let it stand &amp; drie,
and being drie, grate it as you would doe drie paste, and make mundified Barley of it.
Some are of iudgement that Barley thus prepared is not so windie. Some do now and
then put vnto it bread crummes and bruised Almonds, to make it more nourishing.
It moistneth, nourisheth reasonably, but cooleth much: it procureth not any gripes
in the body, neither doth it puffe vp and swell the body or stomack; but to be briefe,
it performeth all the h

pap-meate of Wheat meale and Rice, which in truth doe nourish more than mundified
Barley: but they loade the stomacke heauily, and cause great windinesse, and that
because, for the most part, they are boiled in Cowes milke. The pap-meate made of
Millet, Pannicke, Oates, and especially of Lentils, besides that they are very vnpleasant,
are of very hard digestion, in so much, as that the day after they be eaten they are
to be found in the stomacke. The pap-meates made of Cich Pease,

of diuers sorts, according to the matter whereof they are made, the manner of their
baking, their shape and fashion, the time when they are to be in vse, and the countrie
wherein they are made. The matter is as it were the ground-worke of all sorts of baked
meates, and that is, the flower of Wheate meale forced through a Bolter or fine
Searce, whereunto many other things being added, doe cause a varietie of baked
meates. That it is so, some make Wafers of the flower of Wheate meale verie well
soked in water, and tempered a long time therwith, vntill it come to a certaine thicknesse,
mixing therewith a little salt finely powdred, and after causing the same to bee
baked betwixt two irons made hote, first with a reasonable gentle fire, and

Sugar. Singing breads are made after the manner of Oublies, sane only that the meale
whereof they are kneaden is not mingled vvith Honey, Sugar, or any manner of Leauen
whatsoeuer. Estriez and Bridaueaux, and such other daintie baked things, are
made of the same stuffe, and after the same manner that fine Wafers are, before described.
MarchpanesMarch-panes. are made of verie little flower, but with addition of greater quantitie
of Filberds, Pine Nuts, Pistaces, Almonds, and rosed Sugar; and they are the most
vvholsome, delicate, and pleasant tarts, of all the rest. The Poplins are made of the
same flower, kneaden with milke, yolkes of egges, fresh butter. The leaued cakes take
not so much flower, and they are made vvithout milke. TartsTarts. are made after diuers
fashions, and according to the time: some with fruits, that is to say, Apples, Peares,
Cherries and Plumbs, especially in Sommer: others with Gooseberries, kernels of
Crabs and Straw-berries in the beginning of Sommer. The Italians do make Tarts
of hearbes, as Scariole, Lettuse, Blites, Sorrell, B

Creame. Some make with Butter, Cheese, and yolkes of Egges, diuers sorts of Cakes,
Flammickes, Cheese-cakes, Talmouses and little Lenten loaues. Wigges are made
with paste of flower of meale and fresh butter. Fritters and other such sweet conceits
accustomed to be in request vpon great daies and before Lent, are made of the
flower of meale, kneaden with the yolkes of Egges and Milke, and fried in a Skillet
with fresh Butter. To conclude, looke how many countries, so many fashions of paste
workes: in all which notwithstanding this is for the most part common, namely, that
they vse not any Leauen in any of them all, but onely the rising of Beere, and that because
Leauen made of paste would make them too sowre, or in

intire incorporating of things mingled amongst the meale whereof it is made.
                  Yet all this formerly spoken of, doth not so truely belong to the Pastrie as to the
Confectionarie or Closet of sweet meats, tarts only excepted: yet in as much as they
are principall ornaments to the housewife, they are not meet here to be omitted. To
come then to the true Pastrie, which is the making of those pastes vvhich are meet for
the lapping in or containing of all manner of baked meates, whether it be flesh, fish,
rootes, hearbes, fruits, or other composition whatsoeuer; you shall vnderstand that
they are of foure kinds: the first for the preseruation or long keeping of meats, whose
proper and true-natures are to be eaten colde, as Venison of all kindes, Kiddes, Beefe,
Veale, Mutton, Lambe, Turkeyes, Gamons of Bakon, or any great or daintie fowle:
the second for the containing of loose bodies, at Dousets, Custards, Tarts, Cheese-cakes
and such like: the third for the receiuing of fine, daintie, and tender bodies, as
Chuets, Vmbles, Chickens, Calues feete, or any other good thing which is to be eaten
hote: and the last is that vvhich is called pu

best to be made of Rie flower, finely boulted and kneaden vvith hote vvater, and
barrelled butter, yet in such sort that the paste may be somewhat stiffe and

                     ough; and
thereby verie apt to rise vvithout cracking or breaking, vvhich is the greatest danger

belonging to this kind of past, and the coffins raised hereof must be very thicke
and substantiall, for thereby they preserue their inmeats a great deale the better, and
they must also aboue all things be exceedingly well bakt, because any doughinesse
or rawnesse in the crust soone putrifyeth that which is baked within it: these pa

meale finely boulted, and then it would haue much more butter than the rie paste, and
be knodden as stiffe as is possible, so it rise without cracks or breaking: as for the l
                        •

it asketh much lesse than the rie paste, in as much as it is a drier graine and not so moist in the working. The second paste which is for loose bodies, or any thing that
is liquid, would be made of the finest wheat meale that can be gotten, and of the finest
boulting: it must be knodden with hot water, a little butter, and many egges,
both to make it light and strong in the rising, as also to make it hold from cracking,
least thereby the moisture runne forth and so you loose both cost and labour: This
paste is commonly halfe bakt before you put the moisture into it; for thereby it is
made to hold much the stronger and better. The third past, which is for all maner of
daintie things which are to be eaten hot, must be the tenderest, shortest, and pleasantest
of all ordinarie past, and therefore must be made of the finest wheat flower you
can get, and also most finely boulted: and this flower if before you knead it, you put
it into a cleane earthen pot, and bake it in an ouen and houre or two, it will bee much
better: it must be knodden with two parts butter (either fresh or salt) or with sweet
seame, and but one part hot water, together with an egge or two to make it hold rysing,
and this paste must be made reasonable stiffe, because the weake paste euer
falleth
after the hand, and either riseth not at all, or else so little that it is not comely
to looke on, which euerie good cooke must shunne, because that pie which is as much
couer as crust is euer a signe of an vnskilfull workman. Lastly for the puffe past, you
shall make it of fi

two parts of the flower adde a third part of sugar finely beaten and 
                        •
                     earst: and this
you shall knead with cold butter and no water at all; and euer as you fould, turne,
and mould the paste about, so shall you put cold sweete butter betweene the foulds, and so
worke it to a very stiffe and well tempered paste, and so

reason of the much brittlenes and tendernesse of the past, it will not abide my higher
raising, but will fall one leafe of the paste from another, and so loose the

grauy which should be held in the same: which to preuent and to make the crust a
great deale the more delicate, whensoeuer you intend to bake any pastie of fallow
or red Deere, or any other flesh to be eaten hot, you shall first knead a sufficient quantitie
of the second sort of paste which is for liquid bodies, and hauing rouled it forth
as thin as conueniently you can, and of a sufficient largenesse to receiue that which
you are to bake, you shall then knead another quantitie of the puffe paste and

                      it
likewise forth, (yet much thicker) and then lay it vpon your first tough paste, and
then put in your meate, suet, spice, and other necessaries, and so in both those pastes
fould it vp close and so bake it, and you shall find when it comes to eating that the inmost
of those two crusts will giue that admirable content which any curious tast can
desire: and thus you may bake any other pie by making two coffins to passe one into
another, and closing them vp and baking them with a moderate heat, for this paste of
all other must by no meanes bee either burnt or ouer-dried, but by all artificiall
meanes be kept in the strength of his moisture; and beleeue in all the art of cookerie
there is not any knowledge (except seasoning) which is more excellent or more
worthie to be imbraced of euery good huswife: and yet all manner of baked

                  CHAP. XXIII.
                  Of the brew-house.
                  
                     THe vine cannot grow in many places of France to prosper: but to recompence
such a want▪ there groweth all sorts of corne very fruitfull and
in great aboundance, as in Normandie, Brittanie, Picardie, and other
coasts lying vpon the North side of the land, where the cold seaseth
most strongly, and where the rugged and sterne windes do ouerblow the earth with
their coldnesse; so that in those countries, necessitie, the mother of all skill and cunning
inuention, hath stirred vp the men to deuise some kind of drinke made of corne
to serue them in steed of wine. Of that sort is their drinke called beere, ale, small
beere, meade, gootale, beere and bread, and many other drinkes, which the Germans,
Flemmings, Polonians, English, Scots, and other nations towards the North, doe vse
in steed of wine.
                  This is the manner of making beere at Paris. The fairest, purest, and cleanest barley
and oates that may be gotten, being prouided, and thrice as much barley being
taken as oates, but of both such a quantitie as may bee proportionable to the intended
quantitie of beere, they put them to steepe together in a fat for the space of foure
and twenty houres more or lesse, according to the age of the corn in a sufficient quantitie
of riuer water, rather than either Spring or Wellwater, and after this steeping
time, they take and carrie them vp into a garner, to lay them on heapes to sprout:
being sprouted they spread them abroad round about the gar
                        •
                     er for to rot and putrifie:
being rotten they cast them into rowes: from out of the garner they carrie them
to the kill for to drie: being dried, they carrie them againe into the garner or some
chamber, or into some other place for to fan them and cleanse them from all their
dust and filth, and from thence to the mill, there to grind them and make them into
meale. Which done, they put this meale into a fat, powring vpon the same hot scalding
and boiling water, proportionably and according to the quantity of the meale,
that is to say, foure barrells of water, and a tun and a halfe of water to foure seame or
quartets of meale, leauing the same for the space of an houre to drinke in this water,
afterward they put the meale aside with their stirrers: being thus cleered the one
from the other, they poure in as much boyling water as they did before; then afterward
they take two maunds (made like vnto bee-hiues) of ozier, and these they sinke
and thrust downe amongst the corne, and cause to be so kept by two or three men, to
the end that in the meane time some other man may by the inside of these maunds
draw and draine out the water wherein the meale hath steept, and poure it into another
fat close by: Then they take all the wort or drained water and poure it into some
sufficient large copper, holding betwixt 
                        •
                     iue or sixe tunnes more or les
                        •
                     e, causing it to
boile in a furnace a good houre, and afterward emptying the copper of the boyling
water that is therein, they put it in with pans againe very softly, and all boyling into
the fat amongst the corne, or drosse of the flower from which it was drained before,
and there they let it remaine a certaine time, afterward they draw forth the thinnest
of the liqour, as cleere as may bee, by a stopple which they haue for the purpose in
the bottome of the fat, and that they poure againe into the copper suffring it to boile
there for the space of twelue houres: and into this thin cleere liqour being thus in
the copper, they put some fiue or sixe pounds of the flowers of hop
                        •
                      very drie and
sweete. When the hops and liquor shall haue thus boyled twelue houres▪ they emptie
the copper againe, and put the wort to coole at leasure into other ves

it is cold, they put it to turne into a small vessell containing a halfe a tunne, with two
kettles of beere and of the rising of beereBeere rising. already throughly made, for the better
cleansing and purifying of the same. This rising is made of the froth which riseth

out of the Fat, when the best and cleerest Wort is newly turned in and falleth to the
bottome in the Tubs, which froth turneth into Leauen, and becommeth hard, and
with the same doe the Bakers or Cookes making baked meates, now and then

making of beere amongst the Parisians: for vvith this beere thus made they

                     ,
that the beere brewed in March is the best, it may possibly be so, by reason that then
the hops are in their prime and chiefest force and vertue.
                  The Germans doe make their▪ Ale vvith Barley onely, not vsing any hops: sometimes
they put thereunto a fourth or sixth part of Wheate, to make it more substantiall
and nourishing. Very often in stead or for want of the flowers of hop

                  The Bohemians and Polonians doe make theirs vvith Barley and Wheate, vvhich
they steepe in the decoction of the seed or flowers of hops, so greatly standing vpon
the requisitenes of their hops thereunto, as that they vvere vvont to punish grieu
                        •
                     uly
such as did cut downe, or vnprofitably destroy any hops amongst them. Again they
husband and dres
                        •
                     e their hops as carefully as vvee doe our Vines: they gather the
flowers and fruit at a certaine time, not suffering any thing to perish and be lost: in as
much as the decoction of hops doth not onely ferment and leauen the corne &amp; graine
that is steept therein, but vvithall indueth the Ale or Beere vvith a resemblance of
some sort of Wine.
                  The English, Flemmings, as also the Picards, do make their beere with eq
                        •
                     al quantitie
of barley and vvheat verie vvell boiled, vvhich the Englishmen and Flemmings
doe call Ale and Gud Ale, or double Beere, and the Picards call it double Quoite.
They sometimes put thereto some darnell, to giue it a quicker and sharper taste. The
Flemmings doe put thereto the crums of bread, apples, butter, and a little 
                        〈◊〉
                     
                     ▪ to
make it the thicker. The English to make it the more pleasant, do put into the vessels
Sugar, Cinnamom, and Cloues, stirring and rowling the said vessels afterward verie
much. The Flemmings also doe mixe therewith sometimes honey and spices, 
                        〈◊〉
                     
make, as it were, a kinde of hippocras, vvhich they call Mede or Mete. But howsoeuer,
according to the mingling, steeping, fermenting &amp; boiling together of the grain,
in vse for the making of their Beere: so the beere becommeth sharpe, bitter, sweetish,
waterish, strong, mightie, weake, cleer, troubled, more or lesse durable, and of other
such like qualities.
                  Yet to speake a little more particularly of the English, which are indeede the 
                        •

                        〈◊〉
                     
and Ale: and of these they haue diuers kindes, as first strong Ale or good Ale, 
                        〈◊〉
                     
middle Ale, and lastly small Ale: so likewise of Beer; they haue March beer,

hold beere, and smal beere: the first is for strangers, the second for the Master, 
                        〈◊〉
                     
and better sort of the familie, and the last is for plow-men or hinde 
                        〈◊〉
                     .
As touching the making of these seuerall drinkes: all Ale, of what kind soeuer it be,
is made of the best, cleanest, and sweetest Barley mault that can be got, without any other
mixture, except it bee in those countries where Barley will not grow, and then
Oatmeale will serue, or Oatmeale and Barley mault mixt together, according to the
wealth of the Farmer. Now foure bushels of good Barley mault vvill make a 
                        〈◊〉
                     
of strong Ale, another barrell of middle Ale, and halfe a barrell of small Ale. The generall

vse is by no means to put any hops into ale, making that the difference betwixt
it and beere, that the one hath hops, the other none: but the wiser huswiues do find an
error in that opinion, and say the vtter want of hops is 
                        •
                     he reason why ale lasteth so
little a time, but either dyeth or foureth, &amp; therefore they will to euery barrell of the
best ale allow halfe a pound of good hops: ale asketh lesse boiling than beere, and so
a little lesse cooling except it be bottle ale, &amp; then it must not only be coold sufficiently,
but also blynckt a little to giue it a quick &amp; sharp tast: as soone as you haue drawn
of your best ale, you must put in your middle ale, and as soone as you draw of it, you
must put in your smal ale: your best ale must be barmed as soone as it is coold, and after
it hath risen and wrought and bin diuers times well beaten in, then it shall be tund
in open or close vessells, but the open is best if it be soone spent, and the close best, if
you must let it lie long: as for your middle or small ale, they would not be barmed all
at once, but kept and put to barme as you haue occasion to spend it, that is to say, some
at one time &amp; some at another. Now for your beere you shall vnderstand, that your
March-beere, which is so called, because it is commoly brewed in that moneth as being
the principal of all other, would be made of the best barley malt that can be got,
for no oate-malt of it selfe will make the same: and to euery quarter of good barley
male you shall adde a pecke of oats, a pecke of wheat, &amp; a pecke of pease, and grind
them all together, and they will make a hogshead of March-beere, an hogshead of
houshold beere, and a barrell of small beere: to this proportion of malt you must allow
also three pounds of the best hops; but if they be but indifferent, then you must
allow a better quantitie: you must boile it well, then mash it, then boile it very well
the second time with the hops, then drawing it from the hops put it into the coolers
and coole it, after put it to barme, &amp; beat it in as you did your strong ale many times
for a day and a night together, then tun it, and after it hath purged well in the hogshed
or other vessel, then close the bung hole, and giue it ven
                        •
                      as occasion shall serue, and
so let it lie till it be ripe, which will be in no lesse space than three quarters or halfe a
yere at the soonest: as for your beere of the second running, you shall vse it like the
first, and both put it to barme &amp; tun it in the same maner, only it will be ripe in foure
or fiue weekes at the furthest: but for your small beere, you shall vse it like your small
ale, and put to the barme as you haue occasion to drinke it. There is another kind of
brewing of houshold beere (for this before mentioned is but for one moneth in the
yere) and that is to allow to euery hogshead of beere halfe a quarter of barley-malt,
which is a good proportiō for the familie either of nobleman, knight or gentleman:
and to euery quarter of malt a pound and a halfe of the best hops: as for the second
running of this beere (for it will beare but one besides the best) it will either be good
for hind seruants, if such be in the familie, or else be an excellent reliefe for such as labour
hard for their liuing. The graines, washings of tubs, a
                        •
                     d all other excrements
which fall from the brew-house, are a very good food for swine, and keepe them in
good plight till they come to be fatted for the slaughter.
                  To preuent the decay of beere,The faults of beere. and to cause it that it may continue and stand good
a long time, cast into your beere vessels a great bag ful of many tender eares of wheat,
and there leaue them a long time: and if it begin to fade and weare out of heart, hang
two or three whole egs in the vessell. If it haue lost its good relish, you may recouer it
againe by casting into the vessell the roots of Ireos▪ ginger, cloues, nutmegs, bay berries,
and organie.
                  As concerning the temperature of beere there is no doubt but that it is hot,The temperatu
                           •
                        e of beere. and
that more or lesse according to the things going to the compounding and making
thereof: for notwithstanding that barley by nature is cold, neuerthelesse by meanes
of the steeping, fermenting, putrifying, killing and boiling, that it endureth whiles
the beere is making, it is impossible but that it should be made and become somewhat
hote, then furthermore the hops, whether 
                        •
                     loures or seeds, being mixt therewithall,
doth by its heate, temper and alter very much the naturall coldnesse of the barley. If
that wine (as Galen saith) be nothing else but a water, which in processe of time purchaseth
a hot substance to it selfe in the stocke and woodie parts of the vine, by the

meanes and force of the heat of the Sunne, in like case, barley in the making of beere
purchaseth a heate by his long lying in steepe, boiling and putrifying which it indureth.
Againe the tast and relish of beere doth argue the same to be hot, seeing if it bee
good it must be either sharp, or bitter, or sweet; for that which is sowre or sharpe, like
vineger, or eager, is not good nor well made: The effects of beere do likewise prou
                        •
                     
it to be hot, for it maketh drunken, yea and that a great deale more than wine doth, by
reason of its vaporous and thick substance: it seedeth also and nourisheth, especially
that which is made partly of wheat or the graine called furmentie. Yet further, if it
be distilled in an alembecke, it maketh Aqua vitae, no lesse than the wine. It is true
that beere though it be hot, yet it is in diuers and sundrie degrees of hea
                        •
                     e according
to the temperature of the ingredients: for that which is made of barley and spel
                        •
                     
corne without hops, or with a very small quantitie of hops, is the least hot of all the
rest; and that in such sort as that it becommeth a fit drinke to quench the thirst and to
coole the bodie during the scorching Sommer heat: that which is made of barley
and oats is a little hotter: as that which is made of barly and wheate is yet more hot
and very much giuen to feed and nourish. But howsoeuer, all beere of what corne
soeuer it be made, is of a more thicke substance and harder of digestion than wine,
and which (if either it be ill boyled, or newly made or troubled,) ingendreth obstructions
and inflations or puffing and swelling vp of the inward parts, headach, colicke,
stone, grauell, strangurie, and heat and scalding of the vrine, especially if it bee
sharp withall: if it be too old and drawing toward sowrenesse, it hurteth the stomach
and sinuie parts; as also it begetteth the leprosie, if we will beleeue Dioscorides: And
therefore you must learne to drinke only such as is well boiled, fined, and growne to
a meane and indifferent age.
                  Notwithstanding that beere (as Dioscorides will haue it) be enemie to the

and that those which are drunke by taking excessiuely of the same, haue their members
and parts more weake, than they which haue become drunken with wine: yet
the truth is, that it comforteth the wearied by running or much walking, if so be that
such persons do but foment and bathe their feet in beere reasonably warme.

               The Vine.
               
                  CHAP. I.
                  Of the profit rising of a well dressed Vine and Vineyard.
                  
                     HItherto wee haue intreated of the husbanding, tilling, ordering
and dressing of garden plots, orchards, and arable
ground: it now remaineth that we speake of the vine, wherupon
for certaintie dependeth the greatest part of the reuenues
and riches of a house-holder, howsoeuer many make
small account of the vine, and do more esteeme to haue possession
of meadowes, pasture, woods, and other grounds, than
to stand to the reuenues growing by vines, in as much as
for the most part they yeeld not the fruit which may recompence
the charges laid out about them: But for all this the vine is not to be discredited,
seeing this is not the fault of the ground, but of the people that till it, and
either for couetousnesse or ignorance, or negligence offend in the tilling thereof. It is
true that the husbanding and ordering of the vine is chargeable, painefull, and a
matter of great care, by reason of the tendernesse of the wood, which being well considered,
may seeme to haue come to passe by a speciall prouidence of God, directing
the same and making it so weake, tender, and feeble, to the end that this plant might
not serue for any other thing, than to bring forth the excellent and pretious liquor of
wine, which is so needfull for the sustentation and life of man: for if it were fit for
any thing else, as the wood of other trees is, it would be imployed, and wine thereby
would become a great deale more deere than it is.
                  The greatest part of vine dressers do not esteeme in what ground the vine be planted,
but do make choice of the worst quarter in all the country, as if the worst ground,
and that which is good for nothing else, were the best to plant vines in. Others haue
not the iudgement to know and chuse their plants, and for that cause doe oftentimes
plant their vineyards with such young vines as are nought. Againe many hauing no
respect of the time to come, do in such sort order and dresse the vine, as if they thought
to liue but an houre, burdening and loading it with so many branches and shootes for
propagation, and leauing vpon it so much wood, as that it cannot prosper any long
time. Others although they know the way to order and dresse it well, do yet continually
omit certain courses and seasons, as being more busily imployed about their own
profit, than their maisters wel-fare.
                  
                     
Likewise I would alwaies aduise the Lord of our countrie farme, that hee would
not altogether commit the care and charge of his vineyard vnto his farmer, but that
he himselfe would lay the chiefe burthen about it, vpon himselfe: for as the masters
eie maketh the horse fat, so the carefull industrie of the Lord or chiefe owner maketh
the field fruitfull and to beare great store of increase; and for that likewise the owner
and Lord of the vine will not onely spare it better, but also see that it bee not defrauded
of any such toile and labour as it requireth, contrarie (for the most part) to the
practise of such as are but secondarily interes
                        •
                     ed in such matters: the vine being
such a peece of inheritance as wherein euerie small fault committed, doth draw after
it great losse, and such as oftentimes cannot bee remedied or repaired, but by supplanting
what is done, and replanting it a new. And that it is no otherwise, but iust
so, marke and see, if euer you heare the Guespines of Orleance, or the Bea
                        •
                     uoies,
and those of the duchie of Burgundie (which haue large grounds imployed in vine
                        •
                     
                     yards)
to complaine themselues of their vines, and that because themselues take the
whole care and reserue the principall ouersight vnto themselues. On the contrary,
the Parisians haue no other complaints or agreeuances to talke of but of their vines,The Parisians negligent ouerseers and husbandes about their vines.
and that because they credit deceitfull and ignorant workemen to sway the worke;
whose couetousnesse, ignorance, and negligence is for the most part of the cause that
they reape not the fruit of their vines in such plentifull manner, as they should, or at
the least that the fruit which they doe reape, is not so durable as it would. And this
you must thinke that vines will yeeld a larger reuenue a great deale than gardens or
other areable grounds, if they bee well and diligently husbanded; for there are few
arpents of vines to be found which yeeld not euery yeare, one yeare helping another,
ten or twelue tuns of wine which is a great reuenue, and yet remaineth vnreckoned a
great benefit and auailes which may be made of small plants and impes, which may
be gathered to transport or transplant into any other place, which will easily amount
to more than will satisfie and aunswere all the costs and charges which are laid out
any maner of way about the vines: wherefore either the reuenue rising of such plants
by sale, or the hope of the vintage and gathering of wine, must be the spur to pricke
forward the master of this our countrie farme, to looke to the ordering and dressing
of the vines himselfe.
               
               
                  CHAP. II.
                  What soile and aire the vine doth most delight in.
                  
                     THe vine groweth not but in certaine places that are fit and naturall for it,Two things to be considered in the planting of vines.
which is a thing to be accounted of by vs, so much the more excellent,
because the speciall propertie of this plant is more commended by men
than any other, in respect of the good it ministreth, which i
                        •
                      that in such
places as it groweth in, the men are found to be more strong and mightie by the vse of
it, than other men are, which for want of it, are forced to vse other drinkes.
                  As concerning the soile to plant it in, there must two things be considered, the
qualitie of the ground where it is to be planted, and the disposition and inclination
of the aire which ruleth in that place. As concerning the qualitie of the ground, you
shall chuse such a one as is not very churlish and close, neither yet very ligh
                        •
                      and
open, but yet of the two, more inclining vnto a small mould and open ground, neither
leane nor very fat, &amp; yet somewhat the rather inclining to the fat, not champion,
nor a very plaine and flat, (and yet in such grounds there grow more wine) neither
very stiffe and straight, but rather somewhat raised than otherwise, that so it may bee
the better aided and succoured by the fauourable beames of the Sunne, neither dri
                        •
                     
nor moist and watrish (because that in such kind of ground the vine continueth
not long, neither doth it bring forth good wine, but such as is quickely perished)

and yet indifferently serued with vvater: not such a one as hath any fresh springs or
fountaines, either breaking out euen with the vppermost face of the earth, neither
yet carried along within, in the depth of the earth below, but only in such sort, as that
neere vnto them there may be water to moisten their rootes withall: and the same
moisture must not be either bitter or salt, to the end that the tast and 
                        •
                     auor of the wine
may not be spoiled. So that by this it appeareth that it is not meet to plant Vines in
deepe and low valleyes, albeit they might, and would bring forth grapes in great abundance,
and that because they would not ripen in due time, and so there would be
made of them no better than a green vvine of small value: adde hereunto, that Vines
seated in low valleyes, are very much endangered by the Frosts of the Winter and
Spring time, and are also subiect to haue their grapes to burst, and to runne out their
iuice and to rot, vvhich vvould cause a mus
                        •
                     ie and foughtie taste in the vvine: and
therewithall, vvhen the yeare is rainie, the kernels cleaue and burst out through the abundance of moisture; by reason vvhereof the grape being in this sort too much
moistened, and nothing at all dried, the vvine becommeth vnsauorie and apt to grow
sowre, and fall into many other faults. And if you happen to light on such a place,
then chuse to plant there such plants, and yong shootes as may beare clusters, not too
thicke set, but growing somewhat thin, that so the Sunne may pierce through them:
much lesse may you plant those Vines vvhich haue their pith taken out, and bring
forth a firme and solid grape, in cold and moist grounds: as neither yet in a hote and
drie ground, such Vines as haue substance enough in them, and beare a grape somevvhat
soft. But chiefly, if your place be so well appointed by nature, as that it consist
of and containe grounds that are fit and meet vpon the tops of great hills, together
vvith some low and small hills, then make choice of them to plant your Vines
thereupon. It is true that it vvill hardly grow there at the first, but hauing once taken
roote, it vvill yeeld a verie pleasant and noble vvine, such as the vvines of Ay, Hadre,
Argentueil, Meudon, and Seurre be.
                  In generall, if you vvould plant a Vine vvhich may profite you in bringing forth
abundant store of good fruit, you must see that the ground be gentle, easie, fine, and
indifferent light to be stirred: not as though such a ground onely vvere good for
Vines, but for that it is most kind, naturall, and best agreeing for Vines to be planted
in sandie, stonie, grauelly, and flintie ground, as also such as consisteth of a Potters
clay in the bottome, and couered ouer with earth is good, prouided, that they be
intermingled with some fat earth, and that they be often refreshed by being digged
euen to the veine of stones, or rocke. In a sandie, clayie, and churlish stubborne
ground, the first digging and casting of it must be good &amp; deepe: and such grounds
also would be thrise digged or cast at the least. Such grounds bring forth strong and
delicate vvines: but such grounds as haue of stones or flints great store vpon the vppermost
face of the earth, are not fit for Vines, because in Summer they stand at a
stay, by reason of the great heat of the Sunne, being beat back vpon them by the said
stones: and they doe no better in Winter, because of the excessiue cold which in like
manner then troubleth them. True it is, that if a Vine be planted in a grauelly, rockie
and stonie ground, that then it will not be needfull to cast so deepe, because the roote
is not so farre downe into the earth, as is the new planted Vineyard which is made
in a sandie 
                        •
                     oile, and it is contented with twise digging for the most part. A soile standing
vpon Walkers clay or marle, as loeg
                           •
                        y vpon Yonne, is verie good for Vines, but
the ground standing vpon a Potters clay is not good. In like sort the grauelly ground
is not altogether fit: for though it yeeld a daintie good wine, yet it yeeldeth but a ve
                     
                        •
                     ie
little: and there also the new planted Vineyard is very subiect vnto the hauing of
his grapes washed away. The drie and burning earth doth yeeld leane Vines if it be
not helped by the dunghill.
                  As concerning the power of the Sunne,
                        
                           •
                        hat aire is fit and requi
                           •
                        it for the Vine. and disposition of the ayre, the Vine delighteth
not to be planted vpon the tops of mountains, and much lesse in places lying
open vnto the Northeast winde: but it delighteth in an ayre that is rather hote than
colde, and faire rather than rainie: it cannot abide tempests and stormes: it reioiceeth

in a small, gentle, and friendly winde, and would bee turned toward the East or
South. It is true that generally in cold places vines must stand vpon the South, and in
hot places vpon the North or East: prouided that they be sheltred at such time from
the winds, as well of the South as of the East: if the place be subiect to Winds, it will
be better that it should be to the Northerne or Westerne Windes than otherwise: in
temperate places either vpon the East or West; but the best is towards the East.
                  Furthermore in as much as it is a very difficult thing to find all these commodities
and good properties of ground and aire in euery countrie; the good workeman
shall fit the plants of his vines vnto the nature of the places and countries: wherefore
in a fat and 
                        •
                     ertile ground he shall set the young plant of a small vine, and such a
one as beareth but little, as the Morillion, the Melier and the Aubeine: and in a
leane ground the plant that is very fruitfull, as that of Samoureau, Tresseau, Lombard,
Ouch, Muscadet, Beauuois, and Pulceau: in a thicke and close ground, the
plant that is strong and putteth forth great store of wood and leaues, as that of Morillion,
Morlou, Tresseau, and Pulceau: in a small mould and reasonable fat ground,
the plant which putteth forth but a little wood, as that of Samoureau, Lombard, and
Beaulnois: and by this meanes the defect and want, or the excesse and superfluitie
of any qualitie in the young plant of the vine, shall be supplied or corrected by the
nature of the ground, and that in such sort and manner as that of two excesses shall
spring one meane and well tempered thing, which is a point to be wished and requisite
in the growing of all sorts of plants. Furthermore he may not plant in moist places
the young plant which is giuen to beare tender and grosse grapes, as that of Samoureau,
Gouet, Mourlous, Pulceau, Cinquaine, and Tresseau. In places 
                        •
                     ossed
with winds and stormes, he must prouide to plant such a kind of vine as is woont to
bring forth hard grapes and sticking fast and close vnto the stalke: but on the contrarie,
that which shall haue accustomed to beare tender grapes in places that are hot
and giuen to be mild. In drie countries he must plant those vines, the fruit whereof
is woont lightly either through raine or the dew to rot, as those be of samoureau,
Gouet, Pinot, Blanke, and Beaunoies: and in a moist place, those which are woont
to spoile and perish through drinesse. In countries which are troubled with haile,
such as are of a hard and large leafe, for such are able the better to defend and couer
the fruit.

                  How that there is not planted any vine by the way of making a
seed nurcerie, except it be onely for
pleasure.
                  
                     I Am of that mind, that a man cannot but hinder and iniurie himselfe in
making nurcerices of vines, for besides that the tree doth not grow sooner
of kernels than it doth of the plant, there is also this inconuenience,
namely, that the vine growing of knernels doth not yeeld any thing of
profit or good for vse. This is indeed a worke for such as loue their pleasure, and
haue in their purses largely to defray the charges thereof, being able thereby to sow
seeds out of some strange countrie, afterward to raise a nurcerie of stocks of the same
when they are growne vp for to bee transplanted and remoued into a better ground,
and that they may graft thereon, and afterward againe remoue the stockes so grafted

thereof, which is woont to be both great and daintie enough: but yet this same new
vineyard thus planted is the least durable of all others.

man may easily see that they doe in Lombardie and other places: neither yet with
such as are raised vpon single and double shadowing arbours,Vines after the fashion of an arbour. neither yet with such as

first to see that he haue made trial what wine the ground will best beare,
where he mindeth to plant his vine; for it were but labour lost, and money
cast away to plant a vine for so small increase as can nothing like aunswere and
content your expectation. Thus then you may trie and proue your ground: make a
pit in the ground where you meane to plant it, of two foot depth, and of the earth
cast out of the pit, take a clod, and put it in a glasse full of raine water that is verie
deane, mingle and beate together this earth and water, then let it rest, vntill such time
as the earth haue made his perfect residence and setling in the bottome of the glasse,
which is easily perceiued by the cleerenesse of the glasse which will follow thereupon:
and after that the earth is throughly setled, tast the water, and looke what relish
or tast it hath, such would the wine be; and therefore a vine yeelding such a relished

such ground. Which if it be true, then to dung and manure vines is altogether to bee
condemned, because it is very hard that earth fed and nourished with dung, should
not taste and retaine the smatch of the dung, and so by consequence communicate
the same with the wine. Wherefore the Parisians are fowly and foolishly ouerseene
to load and lay vpon their vines yeare by yeare such great quantitie of dung, and
that is the cause for the most part, why their wines haue an vnpleasant tast, and doe
easily and very quickely corrupt: and yet further the dung doth cause the vines to
grow old by and by and become barren, because they put forth all their goodnesse
the first yeare.

                     THe choice of young plants whether they bee crossets,The choice of young vine plants. marquets, or the
tenais, must not be put to the discretion of the seller, who little careth
to take the fit season for the gathering of the said young plants, neither
yet for the goodnesse of them, but altogether to his diligent &amp; heedfull
care which is the workemaster: and for that cause it were best for men to take them of
their owne vines, or else at least to haue those which hee shall buy, warranted to bee
                        •
                     
good: he must also haue regard to the quality of the aire and situation of the ground

where he will set his plants, that so he may fit them for the same. For and if the ground
lie vpon the South, he shall chuse the young branches of vines which he will plant
from the same part and quarter: if he meane to plant them in a high place, hee shall
gather the plants vpon some high and tall vine: and if low, then out of some vineyard
that is very low: planting in a hot, cold, drie, or moist ground, hee shall chuse
his plants for the renewing of any failing or decaied, of the like situation: by this
meanes the plant will fasten the sooner in the ground, and it will bring forth fruit sooner
and a great deale better than if it should bee otherwise. Likewise hee must not
keepe the young plant any long time before hee plant it: for, no more than trees
which are to bee remooued, can the vine well and easily endure after it is cut to bee
long vnplanted: neither yet would it be carried far, or remoued out of its owne soile
into another, because it feareth the change of earth and aire: and thereupon it commeth
that the young plants brought out of strange countries, as of Beaune, Rochel,
and Burdeaux cannot prosper so well in our soile, as those which grew there first.
To make good choice therefore of crossets to plant new vines of, you must see that
the vine from which you gather such Cros

                     ets bee but sparingly furnished with
pith, because that such a one is not onely fruitfull and bearing aboundantly, but
because also it is not so subiect to the iniuriousnesse of time, as Snow, Fogges,
Frostes, and the burning of the Sunne in the time of Sommer, as those which haue
much pith in them: afterward when the vines beginne to bud, you must diligently
view, about the beginning of September, those that are most laden with grapes,
and which are most fruitfull, and haue most eies in their branches, which haue not
beene iniured or hurt by the hardnesse of weather, and which are neither young not
old, but in their chiefest strength, and middle age, or not much past. Of such vines
must your branches be gathered (in the increase of the new Moone, somewhat late
of the day in the afternoone) not of such as grow most low, not yet of such as grow
highest, but of the middle growth, and such as are round, smooth, and fi

be planted presently, that so it may take the sooner in the earth, whiles yet it is in life:
or else presently as soone as it is cut off to wrap it in its owne earth, not tying it hard,
as also, if you would keepe it a long time, to put it in a vessell full of earth, well closed
and stopped perfectly on euery side, that so the aire may not any way wrong it:
or else, if it bee to bee carried into any far countrie, to sticke it in an onion, or wilde
garlicke, and then before planting of it to steepe it in water, especially if the ground
from whence it is gathered be drie by nature. The vine-dressers of the duchie of Burgundie
before the planting of crossets do cause them to be steeped one whole day or
a night in running water, and find by experience that the said crossets do take more
easily. Others cause the branch to be set and planted by and by, that so it may take
the sooner.

Spring or Sommer, in which first digging or casting of it, the ground
must bee cleansed of all superfluities, as rootes, weeds, and stones: it
must be digged and renewed oftentimes, to the end that the earth which
is vppermost, may bee brought vnto the bottome, and that in the bottome may bee
turned vppermost, to moisten and refresh that which is drie, and to heat and drie that
which is moist &amp; thick, and afterward made euen and cast into many furrows &amp; pits

sides of which furrowes, there may bee put stones, so that they bee no bigger than a

also to the end that vpon great raine, the water may find passage, and not stand at the

place where you shall bee, and the nature of your ground: prepare, make readie,
sharpen, and cut off the root and hairie threeds of your young plants, and fit them
well for the South Sunne: plant them in the middest of the furrow, in the plaine flat,

of a Burgundian crosse, for to make them (after that they are couered with earth,
and old made dung, or with the earth which hath beene cast out of the furrowes, and
thrown on the ridges) leape to the two sides of the furrowes towards the ridge of either
part; for so they beare more fruit, and this is called the double plant, which must
bee vnderstood of the plants onely, which are so planted in doubt that if one doe
die, the other may escape, or that and if they both take, the one of them may bee taken
vp, to put in place where others haue failed: For howsoeuer the plant set of a
crosset may make the better foot and root, yet for certaine it is harder to take than the
marquot, although the marquot be not so lasting and of such continuance, in as much
as the crossets do put forth rootes of themselues. Furthermore, you must cut off the
greatest wood, and most knottie from the vine stocke, which you know to bee the
fairest and most fertile, and it must consist both of old and new wood: It continueth
foure yeares without fruit, and on the other side, without some misfortune it is seene
to continue thirtie yeares in his vigour and lustinesse. After it is cut off, it must be cut
fit not leauing aboue three or foure ioints at the most, two wherof (in planting it) may
stand aboue ground: and if it haue put forth any eielet, you may rub it off with your
finger, or nip it off with your naile.
                  If you make lesser furrowes, you must plant them after the fashion called

hindereth by his shadow either their growth, or the Sunne from hauing full power

fiue or sixe rowes of pulse or wheat, and yet so as that there groweth no intanglement

yet they let not to plant the oliue trees in corne fields, prouiding as hath beene
heretofore said, that the shadow, thereof doe not any thing hinder the growth of

whole furniture of twigs, and that alone in the middest of the furrow, because of his
small sprigs, seeing there is no doubt made of the taking of it: againe, it must haue a
bed and spreading place of great length: it groweth sooner (as hath beene said) than
the crosset; but in like manner as the grafted one, it indureth the least and shortest
time of all the rest.
                  After that you haue planted your crossets or marquots, you must bow them wel at
the foote to make them take roote, and afterward cast downe the earth of the ridges

both of the one side and the other, that so it may fall vpon the said plants. At Clublyes,
Touuerois, and Auxerrois, in planting of marquots (but not hauing any hairie
rootes) they writhe them about very gentlie, and vntill they crack and cleaue a little,
not suffering them to come together againe.
                  There is another manner of planting of Crossets, and not the Marquots (for his
hairie root cannot endure and abide it) which is called by the termes of planting, en barrhe, en fiche, or as it is called in Aniou, en godeau, and it is by pricking downe on a
row the said plants, or else so as that two may stand right ouer against one that is alone,
as the manner is to doe with Willowes, and afterward to couer them ouer, and to
pile and beate them, as hath been said.

somewhere in standing water for the space of one yeare or more, or fat earth, if in
case that the ground where you plant your Vine bee but a leane earth: but if it bee a
fat soile, it will be fit to put therin the drosse of the pressing of grapes, mixt with dung
made of the drosse of white grapes, if the plant bee of a blacke Vine, or of blacke
grapes, if the plant be of a white Vine. Some doe poure Vrin thereupon, to worke

that Vrin is altogether contrarie to the Vine plant, and that is causeth the same to
looke pale and white, and in succession of time to kil the stalke, whether it be Crosset,
or a Marquot.
                  You must not mingle, if it be possible, any other plants amongst the VinesThat nothing must be sowne amongst the Vines. (howsoeuer
some doe sow amongst them Beanes, Gourds, and Cucumber
                        •

                  Againe, Vines must not be planted of diuers plants,That vines must not be planted of diuers plants because all vines do not grow
at one time, neither are they all of one nature: for some beare early fruits, and some
late fruits. Likewise the fruits themselues doe differ one from another: for some are
redde, some blacke, some white, some sweete, some eager and sowre, some durable,
and other some not durable. Wine is better old than new: some is drunke presently
after it is made. One delighteth in one manner of dressing, and another in another:
wherefore you must not mingle diuers plants together, for there is nothing that
so much spoyleth Vines, as when the grapes that are early ripe are gathered with the
late ripe ones, and the white with the blacke, because they are of contrarie natures.
And if any man be desirous to haue manie sorts then hee must plant them apart one
from the other, that so he may order them, inrich, cut, and gather them in their nature
and season, that is to say, the more forward and fruitfull first, and the backward and
late ones last: or, which is better, if a man desire to haue diuers sorts of yong plants,
to the end that if one misse he may be in possibilitie to haue others that will speed,
in stead of mingling diuers plants together in the same ground, hee must haue so many
inclosures, or quarters for Vines (to the end they may by them bee euerie one separated
and distinguished from another) as hee will haue plan

                  In what ground, with what manner of inriching, and at what time
of the yeare, the young vine ought chiefely
to bee planted.
                  
                     TO plant a new vineyard of a French vine, it behoueth the Lord of the
farme (if he himselfe would see the fruit of his first labours) to haue care
and consideration of the ground and of the young vineyard, which he
meaneth to replenish with young plants, as wee haue said: for he may
be well assured, that in a sturdie, stiffe, iuicie, and fat ground, the vine will beare much
fruit, and requireth lesse to be inriched and helped, saue that it may after some two of
three yeares stand in need to haue some little supplie of fresh and new earth, wherein
pulse haue lately growne, or else some little reliefe at the foot, according to the
time and nature of the countrie. In a grauellie and flintie ground, as suppose it might
be in Vaugirard and Venues, where vines yeeld not so much increase, the earth must
be the ofter tilled, dressed, and dunged for the purpose, but such manuring must bee
with neats dung, and not with the dung of horse, swine, sheepe, or leistals, with all
which all manner of ground whatsoeuer, is made worse, rather than amended: besides
that such amends doth impaire the taste of wine, and maketh the vine sooner to
grow old and out of date, because that the ouermuch trust that the workeman putteth
in the heat of these, doth make him negligent, euen as it fareth with them which

to turne vp and dig their vineyards diuers times,The qualities of bad vine dressers. as the season shall fit and require, louing

                     hing: notwithstanding
that the thing which is the principal and chiefest cause of the bringing forth of wine
as well commendable for goodnesse, as abounding in store, is by bestowing as many
dressings vpon the vine, as can be deuised, or any way affoorded.
                  Wherefore you may vndertake the planting of the French vine in the increase of
the Moone, when it is foure or fiue daies old, and that from about the beginning of
December, or the middest of December, vntill the next frosts that follow, and then
also according to their fiercenesse and sharpnesse, which if it fall out to be great, you
shall

whole force and power in the Spring. Wherefore in cold places it will bee better to
plant your vine before the Spring, as on the contrarie, in hot, drie, and vnwatered places
in Autumne, to the end that the raine which shall fall all Winter, may supplie the
defect of other water, and that the roots may the sooner take in the earth, and then
and at that time principally when nature ministreth most nourishment vnto the
rootes.
                  My counsell is, that in planting vines there be not any holes made, but rather little
pits of a fadome and a halfe in widenesse, and as much in depth, and this is to be done
in October if you mind to plant your vines in Februarie, or else in August, if you
meane to plant your branches before Winter.

                     COncerning the naturall plant of the black Vine, it groweth euery where:
the wilde doth yeeld a sharp and rough wine, such as that which groweth
of ground newly broken vp: but the Vine that is intended to be for
Claret wine, is planted halfe of blacke and halfe of white Wine, and
thereupon standeth in neede of another manner of dressing and seat than the common
Vine doth: in like sort it is harder to order well, as requiring a verie great care
to be taken about it, because the wine which commeth thereof is most pleasant to the
eye, and of excellent taste, albeit that it doe not nourish so much.
                  The yong plants of the blacke Vine are the Morillion,Foure sorts of the blacke Vine the Samoyrea

adde the yong white wine plant. And for the mingling of them afterward to make
a Claret, it will in a manner suffice, if among three or foure plants or branches of the
blacke there be one of the white.
                  The best of the blacke plants is the Morillion, the wood whereof being cut, sendeth
forth a redder liquor than any of the other: and the best of this sort is the short
one, being iointed, within the bredth of euerie three fingers at the most, and growing
more or lesse thicke, according as the countrie is, bearing and nourishing it: it beareth
a well packt fruit, and hath a rounder leafe than any other of that sort.

is pithie, and so more loose: the barke, except that on the outside, is verie redde, and
the leafe three forked after the manner of a goose foote, and like vnto the leafe of the

few cleere grapes, and those also small, but the wine proueth strong, yea better than
that of the 
                        •
                     irst Morillion.
                  The third Morillion called Beccane hath a blackewood, and the fruit is like vnto
it: in the blossome it maketh a great shew of Wine, but when it commeth to ripenes,
halfe the fruit, and sometimes more, falleth away. The branch is longest iointed of all
the rest, and groweth more in length and height of wood than any of the other. This
third kind of Morillion is called Le frane Merillon lampereau:
it ripeneth before the other Vine plants, and yeeldeth good wine and as much as both the other.
                  The Samoyreau is likewise found to be of three sorts:There bee three sorts of the Samoy

                        . the best of which branches
is short iointed, and of a verie hard wood: the other draweth verie neere vnto it: The
third sort is called indented Samoyreau, otherwise white Prunelat, and that because
that his wood is whiter than the other: the wine it yeeldeth is of an vnpleasant taste,
and it beareth but some yeares. It hath furthermore this fault, that when the fruit
should come to be gathered, it is for the most part found fallen down and shed vpon
the earth.
                  The Negrier, called redde Prunelat, hath a redde bark: the wood is long iointed,
of a thicke and grosse pitch, a leafe verie much cut, and the grape great, cleere, verie
redde and last ripe. Wherefore there needeth to plant but a few of these red plants,
for the colouring of the other blacke, and fastning of them: it keepeth and defendeth
itselfe from the frost, because it hath a high stocke.
                  The Neraut, called the blacke Bourguignon,Neraut Bourg

hath the same nature with the white
Bourguignon, a hard and a verie blacke vvood, a fast and small pith, ioints one vpon
another, an indifferent leafe and altogether round, the foot thereof being verie redde,

the fruit very thicke and close standing one by another, as though it were a piled or
packed thing: it saueth it selfe better from the frost than any other: there needeth not
so much to be planted of it, for it maketh a deep colour, in such sort as that they which
haue great store of it planted, make wine for woollen-diers, and

because they are not any great bearers, neither yet good for any thing but making of
arbours: the wood is red, as shal be said afterward in in

draweth towards a yellow colour: next vnto it is the Muscadet, which
beareth a red wood: next vnto the MuscadetMauscadet. is the

as wax.
                  There is no young plant that is more apt to beare and indure the frost than the Gouest,Gouest.
which beareth a tawnie coloured wood, and is very thicke in his stocke, hauing a
round leafe, and yeelding much fruit. There is another kind of Gouest which is called
sage Gouest, so called because of the tast that it maketh in the mouth: it is smally
in request, notwithstanding that it yeeld great store of wine, and be no more subiect
to the frost than the other Gouest of the same

                  The fruitfullest of all the white vine plants, is that which is called the white BourguignonThe Burguignon.
or Mourlon, or else the Clozier, whose ioints are distant some two fingers
and a halfe, and the fruit hauing a short taile is thicker and closer grown than the Rochelle,
the leafe is very round, after the manner of Gouests: in continuance it defendeth
it selfe from frosts.

it bring forth very great fruit, and the wood thereof is drawing somewhat

notwithstanding it is the least of all in value and goodnesse of iuice.

them to be three: the one is called the common Mes

and yet some plant it because it is a great bearer of fruit: the wood thereof is red, and
grosser than any other young vine plant, and accordingly growing vp in greater
hight, craueth also a longer frame to run vpon: in like manner it yeeldeth a grosser
fruit, and for a good plant, there is small need of it, as there is also of the Rochelle,
which hath a whiter wood than any of the blacke vines haue, and notwithstanding
it is but little subiect to the frost: but howsoeuer, it ripeneth more slowly, and there
must not be set aboue a quarter of a hundred of branches in a quarter, for it maketh
a greene wine, notwithstanding that it giue it his sharpnesse, and make it drie, and
holding little of the liquour.

                  Of the manner of dressing of the Vine, as well that which is
newly planted, as that which is growne
vp and old.
                  
                     AFter that the plant hath beene dressed and ordered in such sort as hath alreadie
been said, and that you may perceiue that it beginneth to put forth
wood the first yeare, and to take earth (which is a thing that should bee
knowne by mid-May) when also you find that his shoot is able to endure
dressing, you must begin with it and cut it with a hedge-bill: this may bee done if it
haue any shoots put forth more than one principall branch, that so by this meanes it
may ioine all his force and strength together into one stocke or leg, but in cutting
it, you must take heed and see that it be done, as farre off from the bodie of the stocke
as possibly may bee, and not betwixt two earths, least the bodie and trunke thereof
might drie vp: so likewise you must see, not to let it enioie his wood, but to prune
and lop it, taking away such sprigs as may grow vpon it, that so it may swell vp into
a firmer stalke: as is woont to be practised in Anjou and Languedoc. It must likewise
bee obserued that the cutting of it in the old of the Moone, causeth the fleshie
parts of the grapes to be more gros
                        •
                     e and better fed, and that such cutting doth serue
and profit much in Vines growing in a grosse ground, or in vallies, as also in those
vines which are giuen to bee ouer ranke of wood: afterward you must trim them,
for the first dressing of a plant hath his first manner of worke and trauell. In trimming
of them the second time, there must paines bee taken about the ridges, least
that weeds should ouergrow and get the head of the plants, and yet alway with this
charge and care, that in digging and stirring of the earth you doe not wound the
rootes of the vine, being assured that it alwaies more feareth and is hurt by the encounter
of edge-tooles than a man could thinke: and it must not onely bee digged
with a mat
                        •
                     ocke somewhat deepe, or forked pickaxe, but also the weeds which could
not be wholly cast vp, must be turned in, beaten downe, and broken in their rootes:
and first before this be done, there must good regard bee taken euery where, what
plants of branches or vndergrowth are dead since the first seating of them, which
was in the end of December, or in the beginning of Ianuarie, and in their place to
plant others in this time of May, if so bee you bee disposed: in which moneth, they
are sometimes seene to grow and prosper, but and if you do not in this moneth make
such supplie of those which are dead, then you shal stay till the beginning of December
following, and you shall note very well the places where any are wanting, that so
you may the better beare them in mind.
                  The second yeare you shall begin to giue to the young plant all such helps of dressing
and trimming as are thought meet for the vine that is alreadie growne, and hath
beene planted a long time, the matter of propagating of it onely excepted; for the
more paine and labour that is bestowed vpon this new and young plant in the new
of the Moone, and in a time of mild and gentle raine, by so much alwaies it proueth
the better and the more precious.
                  If the third yeare when you dig and trim them, there be any perceiuerance and
shew that the bud will likewise blossome and flower, you must nip it off with your
naile.
                  In the same yeare,To dung the young vine. the plants first planted must be dunged, and the furrowes made
very cleane, and scowred of all manner of weedes, and by the same meanes there
must be dung laid vnto and spread about it, which that it may bee the best and most
agreeable, would bee Cowes-dung, but for want thereof, the best next is Horse-dung,
and last Swines-dung, and where it cannot bee come by, then any such as the

poore workeman can get, except it be marle, or fresh and blacke mould which is the
best help of all others for the vine: and yet the good vine-dresser saith that the good
vine of Pierrotte or Griotte craueth and loueth more paine, and lesse manuring, that
it may not be constrained to cast and let fall his fruit before the due time.
                  The fourth yere likewise it must be picked and freed with the hand in very nimble
and fine maner,To prune and

of the feeble and bad buds, the faire and beautifull being let alone, to see if they will
proue as good as the young planted braunch it selfe out of which they sprung: and this
must be done about May.
                  Therefore to speake in generall of the tilling,To digge and turne ouer the ground after the first manner and fashion. ordering and dressing of the vine
whether it be new planted or old growne, the first labour to be bestowed vpon it, is
called the digging of it after the first fashion, which others call the tanning of it; for
by it the earth is made the more supple and tractable. In this peece of worke is contained
the laying bare of the roots of the principall stocks, and if the plant be grown
high, then this may be done in the calme and quiet time of March, according to the
difference and alteration of places: for in this chill and cold place, which is subiect
vnto frosts and blastings, as also in places seated in the vpper parts and tops of mountaines,
this first order and fashion of dressing them, must be done in the after end of
Winter which is called mid-May.
                  The second fashion of dressing and tilling the vine,To dig it after the second manner and fashion. is to weed, rake, and cut the
same, as hath beene said before: but before this worke come in hand, the plants
must bee fitted by being cut, that so they may be able to continue in the place where
they are planted, and not to be tossed and carried to and fro with strong and blustering
windes.
                  The third sort of labour to be performeed in dressing of vines, is to propagate
them:Propag

                        tion the third manner and fashion of vines dressing. but this worke fitteth them not, for the second yeare, no nor yet for the third
yere, except in some certaine places, and in such vines as at that age are growne to very
stronge wood.
                  The third yere besides the foresaid dressings, if the plant be strong and seated in a
good ground, and that it hath put forth faire and goodly wood, it is woont to be propagated
betwixt mid-Aprill, (and for surenes sake) vnto mid-May, and then the propagated
branches are buried in the places where the ridges are broken &amp; cast down,
and that alike on both sides, by which meanes is made the checker whereof Columella
speaketh.
                  In this same third yeare of the new plant, according to the strength of the wood
which it hath put forth, notwithstanding for the cause aboue mentioned, you haue
with your naile nipped off such buds as were readie to blossome: yet according to
the store that it hath of strong wood, after you haue cut it and amended the stocke,
some begin to prop, vnderset, and bind it, for the bearing vp of the faire and iolly
branches therof, that they may not fall and lie flat vpon the ground: which done, you
must go ouer it with the second fashion of dressing of it: and yet before this be done,
it must be raised, thrust vp and bound with his first band.
                  Vines are propagatedThe propagate vines. in Aduent and Ianuarie after they haue beene cut, howbeit
in places that are more chill, they be let alone till Februarie and March, and for the
doing hereof, they make choice of the fairest branch, that they can find growne out
of the stocke, cutting off the rest of the branches some two ioints from the stalke.
Sometimes if they were of a faire stocke, some vse to take two of the fairest branches
of the chiefest plant, and then lay them verie gently one after another low
vnder foot, in a pit that shall haue beene made in the ridges, afterward they must
bee couered with earth: some do lay the chiefe branch that is to be propagated very
deepe, to the end that the yeare after that it shall haue beene dres

it ouer againe by reason of his former young sprigs which might haue beene
hurt by the first band and withered away, and now at this time it must haue two
bands bestowed vpon it, though they vse not so to do in Anjou and Tourraine, because
their dressing of their vines is diuers, and differing from that which wee vse.
Wee haue forgotten how that at mid-May, before the raifing of the plant, it must
be stripped of his buds, and in doing hereof to bee heedy and warie, that the principall
sprigs which shall be about the blossome, be not hurt or touched, except there
be too many of them vpon one stocke.
                  For the third dressing of the vine,The third dressing of the vine. which shall bee in August, it is woont to bee
trimmed and tied again, after which in a gentle &amp; calm weather, after some raine hath
fallen, the earth must be stird with the pick-axe very gently and softly, and the weeds
turned vnderneath: and sometimes it is weeded, if the yeare haue been rainie. Besides
which ordinarie dressings, you must be further aduertised that indeed it is requisit

them of their buds. To conclude and shut vp the whole matter of the dressing of
the vine set downe in his diuers sorts heere before, it is to be vnderstood in generall,
that in the moneths of December and Ianuarie, the new propagated plant must bee
cut, and the old one of the yeare past looked vnto, in laying bare the foot of the old,
and dressing a new the propagated one, and manuring of it, if there be any need. In

                  Of the manner of grafting the vine.
                  
                     THe vine in this countrie is seldome grafted,To graft vines. notwithstanding wee will
speak a word or two of it, hauing alreadie in the third booke handled
this point more largely, where we haue spoken of all the sorts and properties
of grafting. The vine then may bee grafted either: vpon it selfe
or on other trees. The vine grafted vpon a vine, is after two maner of waies, the on
                        •
                     
in the stocke, the other in the branch. To graft a vine in the stocke, you must make
choice of a grosse &amp; firm one, and such as is ful of moisture, not being too old, cutting
it close by the ground, or which is better a foot within ground. The grafts that you

meane to graft▪ must be round, firme, full of little eies and set one neere vnto another,
and cut in the decreease of the Moone, and taken from the stocke and foot of the
vine. The manner of grafting of them, is to insert and set the graft into the bodie of the
vine about two fingers deepe. And you shall do the like, if you would graft the vine
vpon the branches of the vine.
                  At Auxerrois and especially at Chablies, they haue another manner of grafting
besides the former and they vse it much, it is in this sort: They cut off all the greene
buds and sprigs from the stocke, except onely the shoot or branch which was put
forth the yeare before, which they leaue of the length of some two 
                        •
                     oot. This branch
they cleaue the breadth of two or three fingers, they hollow and also make fit the cleft
within on euery side, to the end that the graft of the branch being made cornered,
may fit the said cleft the better, and in this cleft they put the graft (consisting both
of old and new wood) made sharpe at the end, which shall go into the cleft with his
pith, shaped in manner of a wedge, ouer which they cause the said clouen branch so
to close and come together in such proportion as that the rindes of euery part of the
cleft may ioine, after which they binde it gently without straiting of it much, with a
clouen ozier hauing the woodie part taken away, in such sort as that there remaine almost
nothing but the very pilling, that so it may be the softer to tie them and the sooner
rotten. This done, they lay the said graft in the earth about halfe a foot, and couer
it with soft earth. Neither do they forget to pick off the buds or sprigs that may grow
on the same stock that yere, to the end there may be no attraction or rising of the sap,
for the putting forth and feeding of any thing else but the yong graft, which for the
first yere groweth for the most part about two or three foot. Then at the end of two
yeares they propagate the stocke and the graft, which by such meanes will put forth
many new shootes. The like may be practised in one of the twigs putting vp at the
foot of the stocke.
                  The vine is grafted after the same manner vpon trees, as cherry-trees, plum-trees,
and others such like, and thereof Columella in
                        •
                     reateth very largely in his Elme groue,
whereunto I will refer you, seeing in this our countrie of France there is account or
estimation made of the grafting of vines.

                     YOu shall haue your vines to beare aboundantly,Aboundance of grapes. and withall a very good
and durable wine, if your vine-dresser weare a garland of iuie at such
time as he croppeth and cutteth your vines, if we may beleeue Palladius:
but indeed the surest way is if there be cast into the pit with it when
it is planted, the acorns of okes brayed, and ground-fetches.
                  You shall perceiue before the vintage, that there will bee a great aboundance of
wines,Abundance of wine. if whiles you plucke very lightly with your fingers one grape off from the
bunch, there follow and issue forth some liqour after it. In like maner a plentifull haruest
of wheat, doth prognosticate a plentifull vintage of wine. Raines in the Spring
time do foreshew that the wines comming after will be strong and mightie.
                  Men of old and auncient times past haue highly esteemed of the treacle vine,The

                      hath against the bitings of serpents, and
other venimous beasts: and not only the wine but also his leaues stamped and applied
in forme of a cataplasme vnto the greeued part, as also the ashes of the branches.
The maner of preparing of it, is to cleaue three or foure fingers of the neather end of
the branch, which you meane to plant: and after that you haue taken out the pith,
you must put in steede of the pith some quantitie of triacle: afterward you must

couer it and wrap it in paper, and set the clouen end into the ground: som

                  A Vine may after the same manner be made laxatiue,The laxatiue Vine. as, if in the clouen branch
you put some soluble purge, or if the rootes thereof bee watered with some laxatiu
                        •
                     
things. Note notwithstanding that the branch, taken from the treacle or laxatiue
Vine to be planted, will not hold the properties of the said Vine whereof it was gathered,
because the treacle and laxatiue drugs doe loose their force and power in the
Vine in processe of time.
                  Your Vine will beare a Wine apt to procure sleepe,To plant a Vine whose wine shal procure sleepe. if after the manner vsed in
your treacle wine, you put Opium, of the juice of Mandrakes, in the cleft which you
shall haue made in the bodie of the Vine.
                  To make grapes to grow without kernels,Grapes without kernels. take the pith out of the branch that you
meane to plant, and yet not from the one end to the other, but onely so much as is to
stand within the ground: afterward wrap it in wet paper, or graft it in an Onion (for
the Onion helpeth the branch verie well to grow) and so plant it. There are some
that doe aduise to water it oft with water wherein hath laine to steepe some Beniouin,
and that so long as till it hath put forth some buds.
                  To haue grapes in the spring,Grapes in the Spring. you must graft the branch of a blacke Vine vpon a
Cherrie tree.
                  To cause a Vine to budde betimes,To make a Vine to bud early. you must rubbe the eies of the branch newly
cut, with water wherein hath beene steeped Sal nitrum, and within eight dayes after
it will budde.
                  To make your clusters to consist partly of white,Clust

                        rs bearing both redde and white grapes. and partly of black grapes, you
must take two diuers branches, differing the one from the other, and cleaue them in
the midst, hauing regard that the cleft run not through any of their eies, as also that
there be not any part of their pith lost: then afterward you must ioine them together,
and that in such sort as that their eies may be neere one vnto another, and that in such
sort as that they may touch, and of two, there may become but one onely: afterward
the branches must be well tied together with paper, and couer them with clammie
earth, or with the leaues of the heads of Onions, and to plant them in this order, and
to water them often, so long as vntill the buds doe put forth.
                  To keepe grapesTo keepe grapes. all winter long, you must cut them downe after the full Moone
in a faire and calme season, about eight a clocke in the morning when the deaw is vanished,
and afterward dip them in the Sea water ouer head and eares, or else in salt
brine mixt with a little boyling wine, laying them afterward vpon barley straw. Som
put them in a vessell full of new wine, or else in a vessell close couered and luted: Other
some doe keepe them in honie, others annoint them ouer with the juice of Purslaine,
others keepe them in Oate chaffe.

for this late cutting of it, will make it to be in blossome at such time as the Sunne is in
his greatest and most feruent heat.
                  To breake off such mists and fogsAgainst mist and fogs. as are alreadie gathered in the aire, for feare they
should fall vpon the vines, you must make a smoake round about the vineyard, with
the dung of goats well kindled and set on fire. Against such fogs as haue already hurt
the vines, you must stamp the roots or leaues of wild cucumbers, or of coloquintida,
and lay them to steepe in water, and with the same to water the vines, after the mists.
Some say that if there bee many bay trees planted in the vineyard, that then all the
malitiousnesse of the mists wil fall vpon their boughs.

                  The vine sometimes poureth forth great store of teares,Remedies for the weeping of the vine. whereupon it commeth to
passe that it looseth his force altogether. The remedie is to breake the barke of the
vine vpon the bodie therof, and to annoint the wound with oyle boiled to the halfe,
or else with the lees of oyle not salted, and afterward to water it with the strongest
vineger that may possibly be found.

such as are alreadie withered and water the rest with vineger and ashes of vine branches:
or for the more certaintie, water the foot of the vine with strong vrine which

be ripe,To know when grapes are ripe. which is manifestly perceiued by their growing blacke, as also
by hauing their kernels blacke and all bare, as being altogether seperated
from the flesh or pulpe of the grape, if so be that there be any pressing of the graps.
Or else, if after taking away a kernell or two out of a grape, you find that the roome
whereout they were taken, doth not lessen, but abideth as large as it was, not being
filled vp by the other kernells comming in place. You must gather them in faire and
calme weather,The time and houre of gathering grapes. not in rainie weather, nor when the grapes are full of dew, but when
it is wasted and gone, and the aire is become somewhat hot rather than cold, for so
the wine will be the better, and endure good a longer time, yea (if it be possible) in the
waine of the Moone, and when it is vnder the earth; at the least after that the Moone
is eighteene or twentie daies old, for so the wines will bee stronger, and last better,
than if the grapes should be gathered in the new of the Moone. It is true that before
the gathering of them, you must haue all the furniture necessarie thereto in readines,
as baskets and vessels to

                     gather them into, great hedge-bills, and small oncs verie

way well fitted, tubbes, great and small stands, well pitched and fitted for the
purpose, and presses aired, scoured, washt, and furnished with their necessarie
implements.

                      the finest of the grapes
from amongst the common and grosse ones, as also the white from the blacke, not
mingling the two best sorts together of any kind, as if there should bee a mingling
of the well tasted grape with those which are sweet, or of the white which is strong,
with another which is weake and of a sad colour. The gathered grapes must be left
in the ground at the least for a day or two, and that vncouered (prouided that it raine
not) for so they will become better, in as much as both the Sunne, the dew, and the
earth doe refine and purifie them, as taking from them whatsoeuer bad and vnprofitable
moisture that is in them: then after that to leaue them in the fat, but not aboue
two daies, after which time, the next morning they must be troden out equally, and
in such sort, as that there may not any of the grapes of the clusters remaine whole.
It is true that the treadersTreaders of grapes. must not goe into the fat before their feet be well washed,
and their whole bodies be made very cleane, and couered with a shirt, to the end that

their sweat may not hurt the Wine, &amp; they must likewise abstaine from eating therin.
                  The grapes being troden,What time Wines must worke together after they be troden. the wine or liquor must be let boile and worke together
for the space of foure and twentie houres, more or lesse, according as it is purposed
that the wine should be: for the longer it worketh together, the grosser, deeper coloured,
and mightier it will be; as the lesse it worketh together, the finer, more thinne,
subtile, and delicate it will be. Likewise, if you would haue a strong &amp; mightie wine,
you must in this time of the working couer your Fat with som couer, that so the vapor
thereof may not breathe out, or his force and strength spend.
                  The drosse and grosse parts of the grapes that are trodden, which shall haue some
iuice and liquor yet left and remaining in them, shall bee carried to the presse for to
bee pressed out, and there it shall abide three or foure strokes. It is true that this which
is thus pressed out will make the other les
                        •
                     e pleasant, and therefore it will bee best to
put that which floweth and runneth out of its own accord by treading, by it selfe; and
the other which is pressed out, by it selfe. But howsoeuer you bestow them, the caske
into vvhich you shall put them must not be quite filled vp: but haue some space left
emptie for the boiling vp of the new Wine,Vessels to put Wine in. and the casting forth of such scumme and
forth as shall rise out of it with ease: It is true that you must be filling vp of it euerie
day, so long as till it appeare that the Wine hath ridde it selfe from all its scumme and
f
                        •
                     oth. And yet as then it may not be bunged vp, but rather some stone or wispe of
Hay laied vpon the bung-hole: and after, vvhen it shall manifestly appeare that the
vvine is throughly setled and pacified, then you may bung the caske. The caske must
be all this while either in the open aire, or else in some barne that is vvell aired: for it
is not to be layed into any Cellar vnder ground, before such time as the new vvine
haue vtterly ceased and cast off his rage. And withall, you must beware not to fill vp
the wine alreadie cooled and turned vp with wine vvhich is yet hote and boiling, for
be it either white or claret, it will make it fat.
                  After that the vvine is throughly setled, and ceaseth to boile and work any more, it
may be carried downe into some Cellar,The couching of the Wine in the Cellar. which must stand vpon the North, paued
vvith grauell or drie earth, and free and farre off from all ill smels, horse-stables, sinks,
bathes,What maner of Cellar must be prouided. and marishie places, not hauing any thing shut vp and kept in it vvhich is of

                  Your vessels must be so ranked in order, as that they touch not one another, hauing
some distance left betwixt them, that so they may the more easily be looked vnto all
they yeare. The vessels to auoide the venting which commonly hapneth vnto vvine,
must haue the bunghole very well stopt with grauell, and not stirred or touched at anie
time, vntill the time to drinke the vvine become. If, vpon some hap, the good
housholder presently, or a little after the time of Vintage, be not minded to sell some
part of his Wine, according as opportunitie may serue for his profite: notwithstanding
I find that men in times past (to the end they might haue a purer, neater, and
more subtile wine, after that the vvine hath purged and cast forth his scumme, ceasing
to boile) did vse to put it into new vessels, that is to say, did change it out of one vessell
into another, hauing this opinion, that vvine separated from its lees, doth make a
more subtile kinde of mother in Winter, and becommeth more delicate and durable,
and refineth it selfe farre better in the spring time, than it would haue done vpon the
first lees; as also that when vvine standeth long vpon the first lees, which are thicke
and sowre, it easily looseth its naturall verdure, and getteth a sharpe and vnpleasant

                        •
                     aste, and a thicke substance. They did furthermore obserue the time and course of
the heauens: for they neuer drew vvine out of one vessell into another; but vvhen
the Northren vvinde did blow, vvhen the the Moone vvas either new or vnder the
earth, and vvhen as Roses had put forth their first flowers, and the Vine his
buddes. And Hesiodus following this custome, doth counsell men that in changing
vvine out of one vessell into another, they should separate the Wine vvhich
is the vppermost in the vessell, from that vvhich draweth somewhat neere vnto
the lees, and both of them from that vvhich is in the middest of the vessell, because

that the wine which is next vnto the bunghole,The wine in the midst of the vessell is the best. is euaporated much, as being next vnto
the aire: and that which is in the bottome corrupteth very easily, as being neere
vnto the leese: but contrarily that which is in the midst is most durable and conuenient
for nourishment. Such custome vsed by those of auncient time, is not obserued
now adaies, especially in the countries of France, and therefore we will not say any
thing of this changing of wine out of one vessell into another.

                  Of the time of pearsing the vessells and tasting the wine
and how to draw it without causing it
to take winde.
                  
                     MEn of auncient timeThe time to pearce wines according to those of auncient time. did attribute so much vnto the influence of the star
                        •
                     ,
as that they did pearse their vessells either for tasting or drinking of their
wine, at the rising of the Sunne or the Moone, hauing this opinion, that
at such times the wine doth moue, and therefore ought not in any case to
bee touched or dealt withall. Wee doe not so curiously prie into the matter, but
wee pearse our vessells at all times, and as oft, as either necessitie or commoditie will
persuade and doth require. Notwithstanding in pearcing of them,The way to pearce wines. you must haue
this wisdome, as to beware that they take as little winde as possibly may bee, and
when there is but a verie little drawne of it, you must presently fill vp the vessell
againe for feare of spending of it selfe. As concerning the tasting of wine,To tast wine. whether
it bee to sell or drinke, or if it be to finde out whether there bee any that is in daunger
to bee turned, some doe giue counsell, that it is good to make the assay at such
time as the North-East winde bloweth, because at such times it is more pure and
neate than at others: others thinke it best when the South-wind bloweth,At what time and how wine is to be tasted. because
this vvind stirreth and moueth the wine verie much, and sheweth it in deede
to bee the same that it is: but howsoeuer it is, it is not good to taste the wine fasting;
for before meate vvine hath but a dull and dead tast, neither yet after that
you haue drunke of other vvine, nor after you haue got a full bellie. Furthermore

thing which may alter his tast, but must only haue eaten something without hauing
digested it.

to draw it by a little and a little for his owne drinking, and leasurably without
giuing vnto it any vent at all: hee must pearce it in the vpper part of the vessell
with a pearcer which is for the same purpose, and put into the hole the quill of a
feather which must be open on both sides, and it must bee as long as three fingers
are broad: and that vpon the top of that end of the quill which shall be vpward,
hee put some cotten, couering the said cotten afterward with halfe a Walnut-shell,
and vpon it againe some ashes or vvet lime laid: and when he hath done all this, let
him set the tap in the vessell: and by this meanes he shall draw his vvine easily, and
vnto the lees without giuing of it any vent.
               
               
                  
                  CHAP. XVI.
                  Certaine small things to be obserued concerning Wine.
                  
                     WHen the case so standeth, as that the Vintage proueth small, and that the
Lord of the farme, in respect of sparing, desireth to make a small Wine,
wherewith he would passe ouer the requisite prouision of his house in
stead of a better and stronger wine, hee shall make it in this sort after the
manner of a rappe Vine. In the time of Vintage he shall cause to bee taken a good
quantitie of the knots of the grapes called Pinots and Sarminians, when they are verie
ripe and haue a hard skin, and of these knots alone and whole, wi
                        •
                     hout bursting
of them, he shall cause a vessell to be silled neere full; which hee shall cause to be set
downe vpon one of the ends, and afterward cause it to be taken downe againe, and
set vpon a cantling, and so shall cause to be turned into it two pints of good wine that
is olde and mightie. This being done, he shall cause there to be water boiled, wherof
when it is hote, he shall goe forward, and proceed to the filling vp of the vessell, and
so shall leaue it vntill his small wine haue done boiling, and be become throughly
cold (which is sometimes sooner, sometimes later, according as the yeare prooueth
hote or cold) whereunto he may then put a 
                        •
                     ap to draw out of the same, and to begin
to drinke thereof. And as oft as he draweth out thereof, he shall fill vp his vessell againe
with so much cold water as he drew forth of his wine, and so by that meanes
keep his vessell alwaies full. And by this meanes his said small wine will passe ouer
the greatest part of the yeare in one state of goodnes. And when this small wine shall
begin to grow too weake, he shall draw out thereof a quart, and put in place thereof
as much good old wine. And in drinking of it he shall holde on (if so it seeme good
vnto him) his putting in of water, as before, except that it be found too weake to put
in any more wine, and then he shall make his worke-folkes to drinke of it,
filling it vp still daily with vvater, as before. The colour of this small Wine is verie pleasant
and faire.
                  The way to keepe new wine that it shedde not in the time of the boiling in the
vessell,Of the boyling ouer of the new wine, while it is in working. is to put about the hole at which the new vvine commeth forth, a wreathe of
Pennie-royall, Calamint, or Organie: or else you shall annoint the edges of the said
hole within with Milke, or Cheese made of Cowes milke: or else you shall cast into
the vessell of Wine a morsell of Cheese, for it will keepe in the great heat of the new
Wine.
                  To cause new Wine to be quickly purged,How new Wine is p
                           •
                        rged. you must put into fifteene quarts of new
Wine, halfe a pint of Vineger, and within three daies it vvill be sined.
                  If you desire to haue new Wine all the yeare,To haue new Wine all the yeare long. you must take the new Wine which
distilleth by it selfe from the grapes before they be troden, and put it the same day in a
vessell pitched vvithin and vvithout, in such sort, as that the vessell may be halfe full,
and verie vvell stopt vvith plaister aboue: and thus the new Wine vvill continue a
long time in its sweetnes: and yet it vvill be kept thus a great vvhile longer, if you
put the vessell in a Well or Riuer, couered vvith some little skin, and so leaue it there
thirtie dayes: for in not hauing boiled, it vvill continue alwaies sweete, and vvill bee
preserued by the heate of the pitch: or else it vvill be good to bruise the grapes verie
gently, vvithout much straining of them, and the new Wine vvhich shall issue out
of them by that meanes, vvill keepe new a long time. Othersome do lay their vessell
filled vvith sweet Wine in moist grauell: some doe pitch their vessels vvithin and
vvithout, and so lay it only out of the vvater: other some do couer it vvith the drosse
of the vvine presse, and afterward to heape vpon it moist grauell.
                  To know if there be any vvater either in new Wine or other,To know if there be any Water in the Wine▪
                      take a vvithered rush,
and cast it into the Wine, and if there be any vvater in it, it vvill draw thereof vnto it:
or else take raw and vvilde Peares, and cutting them in the midst, make them cleane:
or, if you vvill, take Mulberries, and cast them into the Wine; for if they swimme

aloft it is a neate Wine, but and if they sinke there is water therein. Some do annoint
a reed or a peece of wood, or paper, haie, or some other little bundle of berbes, or
of straw, which they drie, and put into the Wine, and after drawing them out,
they take triall and knowledge thereof; for if the Wine haue water in it, drops thereof
will gather vnto the oile. Others cast vnquencht lime into the Wine, and if there
be water amongst the Wine, the lime will dissolue and melt, whereas if the Wine
be neat, it will bind and fasten the lime together. Some take of the Wine and poure
it in a frying pan, wherein there is boiling oile, and if there be any water it will make
a great noise, and will boile ragiously: againe, others cast an egge into the Wine, for
if the egge descend and sinke downe, then there is water in the Wine, but if it do not
descend, then there is no water in it.

the vine be much wet, or if it fall out that after the time of gathering them, there fall
some great store of raine, so as that the grapes are watered and wet more a great deale
than is needfull, they must of necessitie be trodden, and then if you perceiue the new
Wine comming of that vintage to haue small strength in it, (which knowledge
you may come by, in tasting it after that the Wine shall bee put vp in vessells, and
shall first begin to boile and worke in them) it must presently bee chaunged and
drawne out into another vessell, for so all the watrie parts that are in it, will stay behind
in the bottome: for as much as the Wine will yet stand charged, you shall put
to euery fifteene quarters of Wine one pint and a halfe of salt. Others do boile the
Wine vpon the fire, so long, as till the third part be consumed, and the rest they vse
foure yeares after.
                  If it should happen that the new Wine prepared in such sort as wee haue spoken
of,To recouer the new Wine which beginneth to sowre. after long time should begin to sowre and turne eager: to meete with this mischiefe,
you must cast to steepe therein a pint of grapes boiled, till they be full swolne,
afterward straining them out into an eight part of new Wine, or else cause the said
new Wine to run through 
                        •
                     iuer grauell.

in French Sayett
                           •
                        , which the inhabitants of Champagne do call Buchettes: vpon
these chips cast your new Wine, and within the foresaid foure and twentie houres,
you shall haue a settled Wine without hauing cast any scum. The inhabitants of
Champagne, especially the townes men of Troy, vse this receit not onely to cause
Wine to settle quickly, but also to make rap Wine withall.
                  If it come to passe that Wine haue water in it, and if we find it to be so, by the
meanes lately laid downe: to seperate then this water from this Wine,To separate water from wine. you must put

will come forth presently, and the Wine will abide pure and neate.
                  You shall make an odoriferous sweet smelling Wine in this manner:To make an od

myrtle berries, drie and bray the same, and put them in a little barrell of Wine, and
letting them so rest for ten daies, afterward open the barrell and vse the Wine. You
shall worke the like effect, if you take the blossomes of the grapes (those especially
which grow vpon the shrubbie vines) when the vine is in flower, and cast them into
the vessell of Wine, the brims of the Wine vessell being rubd ouer with the leaues of
the pine and cypres tree, and a

not touch the Wine, &amp; after shut vp the vessell close, or else infuse and steep in Aqua
vitae the simples or such matter as you haue your Wine to smell of, and afterward
straining the same Aqua vitae, to put it into the vessell amongst the Wine.
                  To make red Wine of white, and contrariwise of red Wine white: Take common

salt eight drams and put in in fiue pints of red wine:To make white wine red, and red wine white▪
                      or else poure into red wine some
whay, with the ashes of the branches of the white vine, and turne and roule it well
for the space of fortie daies, then let it rest, and it will become white wine. On the
contrarie, white vvine will become red, if you put into it the ashes of the branches of
the red vine: or if you cast into white wine the pouder of honie boiled to the hardnesse
of a stone, and then made into pouder, changing it from one vessell into another
to mingle them together: you may do this the more easily, if you cast into the
vvhite wine the dried or greene roots of all the sorts of

                     orrell.

and adde thereto some white salt, and as much vvine, beate them all together againe
vntill such time as that they become very white, afterward fill vp the platter with
vvine, and put all into the vessell of vvine and keepe it.

and dried, or the meale of fetches, changing the vvine into another vessell, when the
meale and the flowers are setled downe to the bottome.
                  You shall make the boiled wine called Cute,Boiled wine. if you boile new vvine that is good,
louely, and very sweet, vntill the third part thereof be consumed, and then when it is
growne cold, you must put it into vessells for your vse.
                  To make sweet vvine that will so continue all the yeare,To continu

                         wine sweet all the yere long. you must gather your
grapes whole, and let them lie spread three daies in the Sunne, and tread them the
fourth about noone. The sweet vvine, that is to say, the very liquor vvhich shall run
out into the fat, before the drossie substance come vnder the presse, must bee taken
away, be put by its selfe, and boiled, and after it is boiled, put to nineteene quarters of
it an ounce of Ireos or corne flag vvell braied, and straine this vvine vvithout the
lees, vvhich being done, it vvill continue sweet, firme and vvholesome for the body.
                  To make vvine like vnto Greekish vvine,Greekish wine▪
                      you must gather from the vines earely
grapes very ripe, and those you shall drie in the Sunne three daies, and tread them out
in the fourth, and the vvine thus made you shall put in a vessell, hauing care to cause
it to purge and cast out the filth vvithin it, as also its lees, at such time as it shall boile.
And the fift day after that it shall be purged, you shall put into it two pounds of reboiled
salt, or very small beaten salt, or at the least one pound in eighteene quartes
and a halfe of vvine.
                  To make a vveake and feebie vvine to become an excellent good wine: take a
handfull of the leaues of Tota bona, and a handfull of fennell and smallage seed, and
cast them into the vessell.
                  To make good houshold vvine,Good houshold wine. you must cast how much the tenth part of the
wine commeth to which you haue drawne or made in one day, and to cast as much
spring water vpon the drosse, out of which the said wine was gathered and pressed:
with this you must mingle the scum taken off from the wine in the boiling of seething
of it, as also the lees remaining in the bottome of the treading fat, which shall
bee lee lie and steepe in the same a whole night: the day following, you must tread
them all together with your feet, and afterward presse them out: then you must put
that which shall come forth into vessells, and stop it vp when it hath boiled and
purged.
                  To cause troubled wines and such as are full of lees to settle,To cause troubled wine to settle. poure into thirtie
quarters of wine, halfe a pint of the lees of oyle boiled till the third part be wasted,
and the wines will settle by and by and returne vnto their former estate: or else,
which is better and more easie, cast into the wine vessell the whites of sixe or seuen
egs, and stir them together very well with a sticke.

To drinke great store of Wine and not to be drunke,To drinke much wine and yet not to be drunke. you must eate of the rosted
lungs of a goate: or otherwise, eate sixe or seuen bitter almonds fasting: or otherwise,
eate raw coleworts before you drinke, and you shall not become drunke. Some
say that a great drinker shall neuer become drunke, if he weare a wreath of Iua moscata
about his head: or, if at his first draught he repeate this vearse of Homers, Iupiter his alta sonuit clementer ab Ida, which is to say, Iupiter was heard speaking in a soft
and gentle manner from the high mount of Ida.
                  To prouoke hatred of Wine,To hate wine. you must take the thin liquor which droppeth
from the braunches after they bee cut, and put it in the drunken mans glasse
against such time as he shall drinke, but so as that hee know not any thing of its; and
thereupon his appetite and lust to drinke Wine will depart quite away from him:
or else, cause him to drinke with white wine the blossomes of rie, gathered at such
time as the rie bloometh: or else, take three or foure e

wine till they die, and afterward cause this wine to be drunke off by such as are giuen
to be drunke: or else, take a green frog, which is ordinarily found in fre
                        •
                     h springs, and
let the same lie in wine till she die: otherwise, marke diligently where the owle haunteth,
that so you may get some of her egs, frie them, and giue them to the drunken gallant
to eate.
                  To make drunken men to become sober,To make them which are drunke sober. you must make them eate colewoorts
and some manner of confections made of honie: or else drinke great draughts of
vineger.
                  To be the meanes that wine shal not become strong,To cause wine that it shall not become strong. take a peece of salt lorde, and
tie it to the hole by which you turne vp your wine into the vessell, with so strong a
thread as may beare vp the lard, which lard must hang in such manner, as that it may
but touch the vppermost part of the wine: and this will keepe the wine from becomming
strong, through his fatnesse and saltnesse, which hinder the separating and refining
of the same, which is the thing that giueth strength vnto the wine.

hepaticke two ounces, bray them all and tie them together in a linnen cloth, and so
sinke them in the wine.
                  You shall finde out and know whether the wine will keepe long or not,Wine that will keepe long. after this
manner: when the wine shall be turned vp, you must, within a certaine time after,
change it into another vessell, leauing the lees behind in the first vessell, which must
be very well stopt on euery side, and then afterward you must diligently trie out
and see, whether the lees do change and begin to get any ill smell or no, or whether
they breed any gnats, or such other little wilde beasts, and if you perceiue that nothing
of all these falleth out, then you need not feare the turning of your wine: but
if it fall out otherwise, you may assure your selfe, that such wine is apt to corrupt and
become nought. Others do put downe to the bottome of the vessell and elder pipe,
or some other of such like wood, as may bee made hollow, through which they
take the sent of lees, and so are throughly certified how they smell, and according as
they find the lees to be conditioned, so they iudge of the state of the wine. Some take
vpon them to foretell by the couers of vessels, wherein if they find and perceiue the
sauour of wine, they by and by iudge the wine to bee good: but if in them they find the sauour of water, they make no great reckoning of any such wine. Others iudge them by the sauour and relish of the wine, which if they find to bee sharpe in the beginning▪ they hope well of the goodnesse thereof: but and if they tast flat
and soft, then they feare the contrarie: if when the wine is put into the vessells, it be
fat and glewie, it is a good signe: but if it bee void of all strength, it will easily bee
turned.
                  To keepe wine at all times,The keeping of wine. cast of the powder of roch allome powdred verie

salt finely powdred: or pebble stones, and little flints, taken out of some brooke: or
aqua vitae: or else hang in the vessel by the bung, a glasse violl ful of quick siluer, but

very well and close stopt euerie where, and let it lower and lower as the wine shall
sinke lower and lower, so that the violl may hang within the wine continually: or else
powre common oyle vpon it.
               
               
                  CHAP. XVII.
                  A discourse of certaine wines that serue for the vse of Physick.
                  
                     AS we haue said in the second Booke,To make medicinable wines. that the prouident huswife must sowe
and plant vpon some bed in her Kitchin garden certaine medicinable
hearbes: in like manner it will not be amisse, that the farmer or his wife
should yeerely, in Vintage time, make and compound wines for the necessities
that may grow by reason of diseases happening amongst their familie.
Wherefore, to the end we may not forget any thing which may fall out to be necessarie
for the better keeping of our Countrey Farme, wee would not omit the manner of
compounding such wines: which notwithstanding the good wife must not vse or
giue others counsell to vse hand ouer head, at hap hazard▪ and without good reason:
for it is not good to vse them where there is an ague, neither yet till fortie daies past
after that they be made. Their vessels must be alwaies kept close shut, for else they
will grow sowre, or else spend themselues very easily: and after that it is perceiued by
the tast, that they retaine the relish of the simples infused, it will be good to take the
said simples out of the vessels.
                  To make wine of Roses: take drie Roses of the mountaines,Rose-wine. Annise, and Honey,
of euerie one alike, and a little Saffron, bind them together, and put them in the wine:
this wine is very good for the weakenesse of the stomack, and for pleurisies.
                  For to make wine of Wormewood: take Sea Wormewood,Wormewood-wine. or for want thereof,
common Wormewood, especially that which hath the small stalkes and short leaues,
about eight drams; stampe them, and bind them in a cloth which is not ouer-thicke
wouen, and so cast it into the vessell, afterward poure new wine in vpon it, and that
after such a proportion, as that for euerie three pints of wine there may be an ounce of
Wormewood, and so to hold on till the vessels be full, leauing a vent open, that so it
may not fall a boyling againe. The vse of this wine is good for the paine of the stomacke
and liuer, and to kill such wormes as are in the guts.
                  To make wine of Horehound that is good for the cough in the Vintage time,Wine of Horehound. you
must gather of the crops and tender stalks of Horehound, growing especially in such
places as are leane and vntilled, and afterward cause them to be dried in the Sunne,
&amp; made vp into bundles, tying them together with a rush sinking them in the vessell:
in sixtie fiue quarts of new wine, you must put eight pound of Horehound to boyle
therewith, after that the Horehound shall be taken out, and the wine stopt vp verie
diligently.
                  The wine of Annise and Dill,Wine of Annise, Dill, Peares, Bayes, Asarum bacchar, and Sage. against the difficultie of vrine, the wine of Peares against
the flux of the bellie: the vvine of Bayes against the ach of the belly &amp; wringings
in the same: the vvine of Asarum bacchar, against the Iaundise, Dropsie, and

and drying it, stampe it and put thereof the quantitie of a twelfth part in a vessell of
thirtie quarts of white wine.

fast in a very fine cloth, and cast them into twentie quarts of new vvine: this vvine is

good against the diseases of the lungs, an old cough, and shortnes of breath.

                  Of such faults and accidents as happen to Wine.
                  
                     WIne is not exempt from losse and inconueniencies any more than all other
things which are contained vnder the cope of Heauen,How Wines must be ordered in cellers or roomes vnder ground. therefore to
meete with all the inconueniencies which may happen to Wine, you
must carefully and often looke vnto the Wine-vessell: notwithstanding,
from the time that the said vessels are couered and stopped vp, vnto the Spring
Equinoctiall, it will be sufficient to fill vp and handle the Wine once euerie six and
twentie daies, but after this time, twice in the said space: and if the Wine begin to
flower, then you must looke to it more oft, least the flower thereof should fall to the
bottome and spoile the Wine. Looke by how much the heat is the greater, by so much
you must visite and looke to your Wines the ofter, and euer keepe it with filling of it
vp, refreshing and giuing of it vent, for so long as it holdeth cold, it will remaine and
continue sound and intire.
                  If your Wine should begin to wax sowre,Against the eagernesse or sowrenesse of Wines. you must put in the bottome of the vessell
a pot full of water well stopt, and thereupon also, stopping the vessell, leaue therein
some small hole to vent at, the third day after, you must draw out the pot, and you
shall find the water therein stinking, but the wine sound and neate.
                  Wines are most subiect to turne,At what time Wine is most apt to turne and corrupt. especially about the eleuenth day of Iune, being
the Sommers solstice: and the time when the vine flowreth, somewhat before the
dog daies enter through the great change of heate and cold, and generally when
the Southerne wind bloweth, whether it be in Sommer or Winter: as also in time of
great raine, of great windes, earthquakes, or mightie thunders, and whenas vines or
roses begin to flower: to keepe them from turning, you must put into them when
they boile vp and worke, boyled salt, or else the seede of smallage, barley bran, and
the leaues of the bay-tree, or ashes of the braunches of the vine, with fennell seede
brayed.
                  Others do appoint these remedies: take the rootes of mugwort, and cinquefoile,
make them in powder, and when the Wine shall haue boiled, put them in, and it will
not turne nor change. Likewise if you lay your vessells in vaulted cellars, or if you
put in them a plate of yron or flint stones, or leuen made of rie paste, or a couering
vpon the vessell, you keepe your Wine from all inconueniencies that might happen
vnto it by thunder and lightning.
                  Sweet almonds cast into red Wine, keepe it from turning: the ashes of oake-wood
cast into the Wine doe the like: the meale of the white fetch doth saue the Wine
from turning, and keepeth it in his soundnesse: allom

                        ine that is turned. you must cast into the vessell a good quantitie
of beaten pepper; and which is better, change its vessell: take cetaine whites of
eggs, which after that you haue beaten them very well a long time, and taken off the
froth rising vpon them, cast them into the vessell and roule it: or else, take twelue kernels
of old wal-nuts, draw a thread through them, rost them vnder the ashes, and
whiles they are yet hot, hang them in the vessel within the Wine, &amp; leaue them there
so long as vntill you see the Wine to haue recouered his former colour.
                  
                     
If the Wine be become troubled,For troubled Wine. it will quickly grow cleare and become fined
againe, with the kernell of a pine apple, or of peaches, or with the whites of egs and
a little salt: otherwise, take halfe a pound of roch allome, and as much sugar, make a
very small powder thereof and cast it into the vessell.

                        . take this course with it: If it bee claret Wine, take the yelke of an egge, and
if it be white, take onely the white of an egge, putting thereto onely three ounces of
cleare bright stones taken out of some swift running riuer, make them into pouder
with two ounces of salt poudred very small, and mingled all together: after that, put
the Wine into another vessell that is neate and cleane, and not tainted with any maner
of smell before hand: which done, cast into the same all the foresaid composition,
and mingle it with the Wine fiue or sixe times a day, vntill three or foure daies be
past: remember and marke to doe this same before such time as the Wine bee all
together marred; for when it is once throughly corrupted and marred, this composition
will serue you to no end, and the labour and time is but lost that you bestow about it.
                  To restore againe into his former and sound estate, the Wine that is growne fat,
fustie, and hath taken winde: cast into the vessell cowes

                     milke somewhat salted:
some cast thereinto allome, lime, and brimstone, but not without their great hurt that
shall drinke the same: but indeed it would doe better, if they would put into it some Iuniper berries and Ireos roots.
                  If that your Wine do continue to hold and still retaine any ill qualitie by its hauing
taken wind, you must make it loose the same, by making two or three towres in the
vessels, and afterward setting it againe vpon his cantling, and then to fill it vp.
                  To take away the fustie smell of wine,To take away the fustie smel of Wine. you must take medlers ripened vpon the
straw, and opening them in foure quarters, tie them with a small threed, and thereby
make them fast vnto the bunghole of the vessell, in such sort as that they may hang
all couered ouer in the Wine: hauing left them thus for the space of a moneth, then
take them out, and by this meanes you shall likewise take away the ill smell of your
Wine; or else take bay-berries, and boiling them in Wine, cast the same afterward into
the said vessell: otherwise, make a bag and fill it with sage, putting it in the vessell,
but not laying it in the Wine:To helpe the sowrenesse of Wine. the same remedie serueth to recouer Wine that is become
soure; if you had not rather chuse for the helping of your Wine to cast into it
some leeke seed.
                  To keepe Wines from sowring,To keepe the Wine from sowring. you must place the vessell in a cold place, very ful
and well stopped, so as they may not haue any breathing place: or else if you want
the benefit of a cold place, and that you are forced to set it in a place that is hot: or
else if the Wine faile through hauing beene a long time pearced: to keepe it from
falling quit soure, you must hang at a small coard a great peece of larde well wrapped
in a linnen cloth, and let it downe by the bung-hole into the midst of the Wine:
and as the Wine shall grow lower and lower, so you must still let lower the lard, that
so it may alwaies continue in the midst. In the meane time, the vessell must be continually
well couered and stopt: and by how much the peece of lard shall bee the
greater, so much the better will it keepe the Wine from sowring. Some aduice and
giue counsell for the same purpose to put into the vessell oyle oliue,Oyle oliue a preuenter of the the sowrenesse of Wine. in such quantitie
as that it may only couer the vppermost face of the Wine: and when the Wine is all
drawn out, the oyle may easily be seperate from the lees, and ga

into the vessell the leaues of the pomegranete tree.

                  Of the manner of making Vineger.

that which is gone before: the riotousnesse and pleasure of men, hath
beene the cause that Vineger came euer in request, not onely for sauces,
but also for many other vses: It shall not therefore be thought vnreasonable
to vse a word or two about making of Vineger.
                  The most common way to make Vineger is on this sort: They vse to take good

place, as in some corne loft, or in some gutter betwixt the tiles.
                  If you desire to make Vinegar in hast, you must cast into your wine, salt, pepper,
and soure leuen mingled together: and yet to make it the more hastly, you must heat
red hot some stone, tile, or gad of steele, and put it all hot into the wine, or else the
mouth of the vessell must stand alwaies open, or else the vessell must be set in the
Sunne three or foure daies▪ and therewithall a little salt put in the vessell: or else fill a

either in a glasse vessell, or in one of blacke earth, fill vp the same vessell with pure
Vinegar or Wine, and so set it forth againe into the Sun or in the chimny end to the
heate of the fire, and in a short time it will become strong and very sharpe Vineger:
but if you would restore it againe to his former state of wine, then you must cast, of
colewort roots into it.The roots of cale-words make Vineger to

                  Of some obseruations and instructions concerning Vineger.
                  
                     TO make strong vineger,Strong Vineger. take the fruit of the cornell tree, when it beginneth
to grow red, and of bramble berries, such as grow in the fields,
when they are halfe ripe, drie them, make them into powder, and with
a little strong Vineger, you shall make little prettie balles, which you
shall drie in the Sunne, afterward you must take wine, and heate it, and when it is hot
put into it this composition, and it will bee turned very speedily into very strong
Vineger.
                  To make Vineger with corrupted wine: take a rotten and corrupt wine and boile
it,To make Vineger o

                        d wine. taking away all the scum that riseth in the boiling thereof, thus let it continue vpon
the fire till it be boyled away one third part, then put it into a vessell wherein hath
bin Vineger, putting thereto some cheruile, couer the vessell in such sort, that there
get no aire into it, and in a short time it will proue good and strong Vineger.
                  To make drie VinegerDri
                           •
                         Vineger. to carrie whither a man listeth, take of wild cherries when
they begin to be ripe (and yet the fruit of the cornell tree is better) of mulberies
when they be red, and vnripe grapes th
                        •
                     t are very thicke, and of wild a cornes before
they bee ripe, stampt all together, then take of the best Vineger you can finde,
and mingle them all together, make vp the masse into small loaues, setting them to
drie in the Sunne: and when you would make Vineger, temper some of these small

loaues in wine, and you shall haue very good Vineger. Otherwise, take the vnripe
iuice of corne that is very greene, and stampe the same putting Vineger thereto, and
thereof make a past, wherof you shall make little loaues to be dried in the Sunne, and
when you would haue Vineger, temper of these loaues in so much wine as you shall
see sufficient, and you shall haue very good Vineger.
                  To make rose-vineger,Rose Vineger. take good white Vineger, and put therein red roses, either
new or dried, keeping them many daies in the vessell, and afterward taking them
out, put them in another glasse, and so keepe them in a coole place: after the same
manner you may make Vineger of elder-tree flowers.
                  To make Vineger without wine, put into a vessell soft and daintie peaches,To make vineger without wine. and
vpon them pearched barley, letting them putrifie all a whole day, then straine them
and vse the liquor: or else take old figs and burnt barley, together with the inner
parts of orenges, put all these into a vessell, and stir them vp very well and oft, and
whenas they are become putrified and resolued, straine them out and vse the liquor.
                  To make sweet Vineger,Sweet vineger. take fiue pints of strong Vineger, and with as much new
wine reserued vpon the treading out of the grapes, adde some quantitie of pitch, and
and put altogether in a vessell which you must stop very carefully: and after that all
these haue continued together for the space of some thirtie daies, you may vse thereof
for Vineger: otherwise, take a vessell of new wine, and mingle it with two vessels
of Vineger, and boile them together till the third part be consumed. Some doe adde
three vessels of spring water vnto two of new wine and one of Vineger, boiling them
all together vntill the third part be consumed.
                  To make mightie strong Vineger,Mightie strong vineger. drie the grosse of grapes two whole daies, then
put it in new wine, put thereto some of the vnripe iuice of corne, and you shall make
a strong Vineger, whereof you may haue the vse within seuen daies after: or otherwise,
put pellitorie of Spaine into Vineger and it will make it strong. Furthermore,
if you boile the fourth or fifth part of Vineger vpon the fire, and put it vnto that
which is before prescribed, putting it after all this in the Sunne some eight daies, you
shall haue a pleasant and strong vineger. The rootes of couch-grasse when they are
old, boiled grapes, the leaues of the wild peare tree stamped, the roots of brambles
and whay, the quicke coales of burned acornes, and boiled ciche pease and hot tiles,
euen euery one of these by themselues being cast into Vineger doe make the same
strong.
                  Pepper vinegerPepper vineger is made by casting into vineger or hanging therein whole pepper
made vp in a linnen cloth, for the space of eight daies,

for then if it swell vp as though it would boile, you may boldly say that there
is water in it.
                  To make vineger good to helpe digestion, and for your health, take eight drams
of the sea onion, and two pints of vineger, put them together into a vessell, and vvith
them as much of pepper, mints, and iuniper berries, then vse it afterward.
                  To make vineger of sea onions,Vineger of sea onions. you must put ten such onions salted into fiftie
quartes of sweet new vvine, and foure pints and a halfe of strong vineger, and if it be
not sharp enough, then twice so much, in a pot holding fiftie four quarts, &amp; boile them
till the fourth part bee consumed: or if the wine bee sweete, it must be boiled to the
spending of the third part, but such wine may be of his owne distilling out of the
grapes before they be trodden and very cleere: otherwise, put into a vessell thirtie
pints of strong vineger, wherein let steepe for the space of twelue daies, the inward
part of a white sea onion which hath beene in the Sunne thirtie daies: after that, take
the vineger and let it settle and abide in some place where you wil to vse it afterward.
Dioscorides in his one and twentieth chapter of his fourth booke discribeth another
manner of it.
                  It is to obserued and noted that all sorts of vineger are best helped to keepe their
tartnesse, by putting into their vessels at the bung hole a sticke of red withie.

                  Of the manner of making of Veriuice.
                  
                     THe most common manner of making of Veriuice in this countrie, is to
gather the greene grapes from of the vine frames, or the grapes which
are not yet ripe, and are left vpon the vines after vintage, and hauing
gathered them, to tread and presse them afterward, after the manner
of ripe grapes, putting the liquor or iuice thereof into vessells, and salting the same
by and by, after that it hath purged out all its scum and filth, by boiling as new wine
doth. In the Northern countries they do also make Veriuice of crabs mingling a little
salt therewithall. Some make a drie Veriuice after this manner: they take the greenest
that they can get, pressing the iuice thereout, which afterward they boile in a
brasen vessell vntill it become thicke, and as it were congealed, then they drie it in
the Sunne, and keepe it for their vse: othersome boile it not at all, but drie it in the
Sunne, till it come to the thicknesse of honie.
                  To make your Veriuice looke more greene, and to be better, and to preuent that
it may not turne and become mouldie or hoarie, you must the day after it is turned vp
into its vessell, plucke a bunch or two of blacke grapes, and cast them into the vessell
at the bung-hole, euen in whole clusters, and then to salt it after that it hath beene
boiled.
               
               
                  CHAP. XXII.
                  Containing certaine discourses by the way of inuention, nature, faculties,
differences, and necessitie of Wine.
                  
                     AS we haue in the former booke at large intreated of bread, and of the differences
thereof, according to the vse wherein it is imployed, namely, the
nourishment of mans bodie; so now after the manner of ordering and
husbanding of the vine, and so of the fruit which commeth of such husbanding
thereof, which is Wine, it shall not seeme vnreasonable, if summarily, wee discourse and stand vpon the necessitie, nature, faculties, and differences of Wine,
whereof we make so great account ordinarily in our drinking thereof.
                  And to the end that we may now come to the matter:The necessitie of drinke. Seeing not only the substance
of mans bodie, but of all other liuing creatures is subiect, (through vitall heate continually
working in them) vnto a perpetuall wast, and expending of it selfe: nature
being prouident ouer her owne workes, hath giuen vnto and put in all sorts of
liuing creatures, an incredible desire of eating and drinking, to the end that this
waste and losse of substance might bee repaired and restored by the well bounded
increase comming of eating and drinking; for otherwise, naturall heate destitute of
such her food and nourishment, would quickly be choked and quenched. Now the
substance of euery liuing bodie is threefold: the first is, and consisteth of spirits:
the second of humours: the third of solide parts: all which three substances may possibly
be repaired by a solide substance, if so be that such solide nourishment could easily
bee digested and distributed, throughout the whole habite and vniuersall masse
of the bodie. But seeing that such is the solidnesse, hardnesse, and grosenesse therof,
as that it cannot, it was needfull that it should be accompanied with some floting and
fluide liquor, which might stand in steed of a wagon or chariot to conueigh and
carrie it vp and downe the bodie. Ioine also thereunto, that this fluent liquor hath
without comparison a greater power than the solide nourishment to let and hinder

the drying vp of the solide parts, and to temper all such heat, as otherwise, vpon euerie
light motion, might at euerie moment offend and hurt them. This losse and continuall
expence of this threefold substance (which in the end doth first bring old
age; and afterward death) doth grow through that iarre and disagreement which is
in the foure elements, vvhereupon the whole bodie is compounded and framed:
vvhich elements also, notwithstanding that they may seeme vnited and ioyned together
in a certaine kind of harmonie, consent, amitie, and inuiolable bond, yet by reason
of secret rancour and mutuall disagreement happening through their contrarie
qualities, they doe so warre one vpon another, as that by little and little they do procure
the ruine, dissolution, and vtter ouerthrow of that bodie which before they had
consented to frame and compose. Physitions ouer and besides this, do acknowledge
another cause of this expence of nature, and bringing in of old age, and lastly death,
vvhich is fore-slowed and kept off by eating and drinking; and that is naturall heat,
vvhich feedeth vpon the radicall moisture, seated in the substance of the solide parts:
vvhich moisture, the sooner that it is dried vp, wasted, and consumed by the foresaid
heat, so much the shorter is the course of life. But this radicall moisture, and the continuall
losse of spirits, it repaired by the addition of eating and drinking, and so
the life drawne forth to a longer terme. Wherefore, Nature being carefull of the
preseruation and long continuance of the bodies of liuing creatures, vvhich otherwise,
for the occasions aboue named, vvould grow old and perish in a few houres,
taketh not anie other course for the same but by eating and drinking, vvhich are
the two meanes to sustaine and preserue (so much as is possible) the liues of all liuing
things. And as for eating, let vs leaue off to haue anie thing to doe with it, as
hauing spoken thereof in the former booke, and let vs come to the second, vvhich
is drinking.
                  
                     The common drinke of all liuing creatures is water.
                     OLd and ancient Histories doe sufficiently testifie, that water was the first drinke
which men vsed generally throughout the world, and wherewith they contented
themselues a long time, to vse it onely for the quenching of their thirst: but
afterward, vvhen voluptuousnesse seized vpon mens appetite, they inuented and set
before them diuers sorts of drinkes. Wherefore hauing reiected water as a tastlesse
and vnsauourie thing, they haue in place thereof (in all such Coasts and Countries
as where the heat of the Sunne might bring forth and lead along the grape vnto his
full ripenesse) chosen Wine for the most excellent and delightsome drinke of all others:
as in other cold Countries, and such whereas the Vine could not grow, they haue either still continued their drinking of vvater, or fetched and procured vvine
from other places, or else haue prepared some other kind of drinke comming neere
in some measure vnto vvine, vvhich by the delicatenesse thereof might reioyce the
heart, and gratifie the tast. Whereupon, some in stead of vvater haue taken vp the
vse of Wine, and others of Beere and Ale: some of Cyder and Perrie, and others,
of all sorts: some of honied vvater, or vvater sweetened vvith sugar: and others, of
other drinkes pressed and strained out from fruits, or the decoctions of rootes. All
France, Italie, Sicilie, Spaine, and all other Countries which are farre off from the
North, doe content themselues with vvine, the Nation of the Turkes excepted:
vvho, being incensed either by the superstition of Mahumet, or stirred up thereunto
by the ancient custome of Turks, do vtterly abhorre vvine, and vse in stead thereof
honied water. England, Scotland, Dalmatia, Polonia, Sarmatia, and other Northren
Countries doe vse partly vvine, as procuring the same from other places, and
partly Beere, in such sort, as that by how much the Countries are the colder, by so
much the more they are giuen and addicted to vvine and drunkennes: vvitnesse hereof
is not onely Germanie, but also Frizeland, Dalmatia, and Flanders, the inhabitants
of which countries doe not onely striue who shall drinke most, and extoll drunkennesse
vnto the skies, but also doe scoffe at sobrietie, and so highly disdaine such

people as striue to liue soberly and temperately, as that they think them the most vnworthie
of their alliance and companie. And yet (notwithstanding that so many sorts
of drinks be growne in request in stead of water in many countries) wine seemeth to
me to beare the bell, as being the most pleasant, delightsome, and excellent drink that can be found or thought vpon.
                  
                  
                     What is meant by wines.
                     THe iuice then of the grape, which either runneth from the grape being full ripe,
or is pressed out with feet, or the presse, before it be boiled, is called new or sweet
wine, but after that it hath boiled, and thereby cast forth all his scumme and dregges,
it is properly called wine. Wherefore this boiling or working, by which in fine it is
fined and setled from all his excrements, is not any manner of putrifaction, but rather
an effect of naturall heat engendred and naturally rooted in the same: for whereas
the iuice newly drawne out of the grape, doth containe in it many excrements, and
those diuers in nature, which the naturall heat thereof cannot (without great strife,
enforcement, and contending) concoct and ouercome: it is necessarie, that in this
contention it should worke out a heat, boyling, and verie great perturbation, by reason
of the struglings of the two contrarie heats: that is to say, the naturall, which doth
concoct the crude and raw matter of the new wine, and by that meanes separateth the
excrementous parts from it: and on the other side, the strange and accidentall heat
which is kindled and raised in the crude and raw parts of the new wine, which encountring
the naturall heat no otherwise than is done in the crises of sharpe sicknesses,
at such time as naturall heat doth concoct the crude and raw matter of the disease,
and attempteth to make separation of the noysome and annoying matter, many disturbances,
shakings, heats, and other grieuous symptomes doe fiercely assaile the partie,
vntill such time as naturall heat (hauing ouercome) proceed to the separating of
the good and naturall humors from the excrementous ones, and expell those which
were the cause of the maladie. And euen so it falleth out in the boiling or working of
new wines, wherein the accidentall heat is ouercome by the heat of nature, without
any worke of putrifacation: the heterogene and vnnaturall matter being separated
from the homogene and naturall: the vnprofitable and excrementous humour consumed,
and the flatulent or windie parts thereof discussed: and to be briefe, all the
profitable iuice is in such sort concocted and digested, as that that which before was
crude, flatulent, and hard to be digested, is become gentle, tractable, fauourable, and
verie agreeable for mens vse, as though it were quite changed and altered from his
nature. Of new pressed wine is made the wine called Cute, in Latine Sapa:
                        Sapa. and it is
by boiling the new pressed wine so long, as till that there remaine but one of three
parts. Of new pressed wine is also made another Cute, called of the Latines Defrutum:
                        Defrutum.
and this is by boiling of the new wine onely so long, as till the halfe part be
consumed, and the rest become of the thicknesse of honey. Sometimes there is a
wine made called Passum,
                        Passum. and it is when the grapes haue endured the heat a long
time vpon the Vine.
                  
                  
                     The inuenters and first finders out of wine.
                     SVch as haue written in Hebrew, as also the Scripture it selfe, doth testifie, that Noe
                        Noe.
was the first author of wine. Nicander Colophonius saith in his verses, that wine was
called 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                         in Greeke,Why wine is called 
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                            in Greeke. of the name of a man which was called Oenus, and first pressed
out the new liquor out of the grape into his drinking cup. Others write, that Icarus
                        Icarus.
was the first inuenter thereof: and that verie shortly after his inuention he had condigne
punishment therefore, as being slaine of the dressers of his vineyards, they being
drunke. Whereupon Propertius saith,

                           O Icarus, th'Athenian clowne
                           Deseruedly thy life throwes downe.
                        
                        
                        Athenaeus saith, That the Vine was first found neere vnto the Mount Etna, and that a
dogge passing that way, plucked vp a little branch of a Vine tree out of the earth, and
that Oresteus, sonne of Deucalion, which raigned in that Countrey, caused the same
branch to be planted againe, vvhereout there sprang manie shoots of Vines, vvhich
he called Oenus, of the name of the dogge which had pluckt the same branch out of
the ground: vvhereupon also the auncient Greekes called Vines Oenas. The Latines
say, That the Vine is called Vitis, quasi vita, because that vvine doth quickly restore
the vitall spirits being wasted and spent, and doth comfort, repaire, encrease, and
strengthen the naturall heat that is weakened, vvhich is the principall instrument of
life, insomuch, as that by the vse of vvine it is made more freely disposed than it was
before to performe all manner of actions requisite for the life of man. Old Writers
are not of one mind concerning the first originall and inuention of the Vine, for euerie
one of them almost hath his seuerall opinion. But as concerning my selfe, I thinke
that the Vine was brought forth of the earth, as other grasse, hea
                           •
                        bes, and trees were
from the beginning of the world, and that it brought forth grapes of it selfe without
any tilling or dressing, and those like vnto them which the wild Vine (called of vs
Labrusca) doth now bring forth, but that the first fathers did not so quickly know
the vse and profit of the Vine. For in America, Florida, and the new-
                           •
                        ound Countries,
there are great store of Vines growing plentifully, and in great aboundance,
without any art or industrie of men, although the vse of wine be as yet vnknowne to
the inhabitants of those Countries. Plato in his C
                              •
                           atylus saith, That wine is called
in Greeke 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                         
                        quasi 
                        
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        , that is to say, iudgement, consideratenesse, and aduisednesse,
because it furnisheth the intellectuall part with iudgement and aduise, because
by his quicknesse it restoreth the spirits, whereby it strengtheneth the mind as well
as the bodie, as Mnestheus hath verie well reported of it. Some likewise say, That the
Greekes call 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                         
                        quasi 
                        
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        , that is to say, profit and vtilitie, because it is infinitely
profitable.Why it is called Vinum. The Latines call it Vinum 
                              •
                            vi, by reason of the violence it offereth to
the spirit of man, when it is taken out of measure. The cause likewise why the old
Writers called it Temetum, was because the immoderate vse thereof holdeth captiue
and corrupteth the mind,Why Temetum. that is to say, the vnderstanding. We will define wine to
be a iuice extracted and pressed out of ripe grapes, purified and fined, contained in
vessels sit for the receiuing of the same, conuenient and agreeable vnto mans life, and
therefore the liquors of the grape newly pressed out, is not to be called wine, because
it is not fined,The definition of wine. neither yet doth veriuice deserue the name of wine, because it is pressed
out of grapes as yet not ripe.
                  
                  
                     The temperature of Wine, and of the liquor newly pressed
out of the grapes.
                     THe new pressed iuice of the grape is of temperature hot in the first degree, but
wine is hot in the second degree, yea in the third, if it be old: it is likewise of
drinesse proportionable to his heat. It is true, that according to the regions, grounds,
inclination, and disposition of the yeare, and such other differences, which doe alter
and change his temperature very much, it falleth out to be sometimes more, sometimes
lesse, hot. The wines that Spaine, Italie, Langu
                           •
                        doc, the Countrey of Narbone
in France, Gascoigne, and other hot Countries doe bring forth, proue hot and
drie in the end of the second, yea in the beginning of the third degree, especially
when the constitution of the yeare falleth out to be hot and drie, and when they are
of a middle age. But such wines as grow in grounds about Paris, or other Countries
vvhich draw toward the Westerne or Northerne quarter, doe scarcely fall out to
proue hot in the beginning of the second degree, no not in a hot and drie yeare, and
though they be growne to a middle age, as not hauing passed the age of the first yeare.
For when the yeares fall out cold and moist, all these kinds of wines for the most
part growing in these Countries, become greene and raw, and for the same cause
called greene wines, and those so weake, that hardly may they be iudged to be hot

in the first degree, and the yeare expired and gone about, their heate being likewise
expired and spent, they either become altogether sower, or hauing lost their smell
and taste proue to be naught and corrupted.Olde wines are hotes than the new. Whereupon that which the old writers
haue deliuered concerning the temperatures and qualities of old Wines cannot bee
proued true of such Wines as grow in these countries, wherein the greatest part of
French Wines within three or sixe moneths, or at the furthest by the end of the yere,
grow to the 
                           •
                        ull top and perfection of their goodnesse: whereas on the contrarie,
such as grow in hot countries, and become themselues more hot, will not bee at the
best, before the fifth, sixth, yea before the tenth yeare; which if it bee so, you must
thinke that the sinewes and other senses of the bodie, doe receiue most harme by
old Wines which grow in hot and drie countries: and that they are the lesse offended
and hurt of the old Wines which grow in this our French soile which is more
cold. In this countrie new Wine being sufficiently boyled vp and fined, as it is more
pleasant to the tast,New wine 
                              〈…〉
                            in France. so it is more hot, cleane contrarie to that which groweth in hot
countries. Dioscorides writeth that old vvine, for as much as it is hotter, doth hurt
them very much which feele some weakenesse in some of their inward parts; but
wee cannot say the like of our vvine vvhen it is old, but rather of our vvine when
it is new, for the same reasons. Wherefore it followeth, that the opinion of Dioscorides
and diuers other Physitians, touching the heat and temperature of old wines,
is to bee vnderstood of vvines that grow in countries that are more hot, and not
of such vvines as (if they bee daintie and delicate vvines) vvill attaine the height
of their goodnesse, and
summe of their perfection in sixe or eight moneths, or at
the furthest by the end of the yeare, in such sort, as that the same being ended, they
waxe sower: yea, if they be right noble vvines, they bee well forward vpon and toward
their perfection in the beginning of the second yeare, or somewhat after. The
force and naturall heate of the dilicatest French vvines is gone after the first yeare
is once past: but in a noble vvine it fadeth and falleth away by little and little, not
before the second yeare be past. The vvines of Gascoigne and Aniou, growing in
a hot and drie season, draw very neere vnto the nature and temperature of the
vvines, whereof old vvriters haue spoken: because the greatest part of them may
be kept vnto the the third yeare. The vvines of Orleance are at the best the second
yeare, and it stayeth with them to the end, but when the second yeare endeth, they begin
to loose their goodnesse.
                     Now if the case stand thus in hot countries, it is better to abstaine from old vvines,
than from new which are altogether fined: for their old vvines do heate out of measure;
but the new vvines stir not vp any heate that may molest and trouble, and yet
they also be very hurtfull, because they digest very hardly, and beget many obstructions.
Wherefore in countries that are more hot, new vvines may be drunke without
any preiudice to the health, being of a thin substance and wel fined, because they
haue but a weake heat. But in these our countries which are cold and moist, old wines
may be vsed, as also the new which are of a thinne substance, well purged and fined.
Notwithstanding our countrie old vvines, in as much as after some long time they
loose their heat, and thereby heat the lesse, are not so hurtful▪ vnto the head as the new,
or those which are of a middle age.
                     The iuice thereof newly pressed from the grape (in as much as it is raw,The iuice of the grapes not

and of hard digestion, if therewithall it do not ouerturne the stomach, and prouoke
flux of the bellie) doth stay a long time in the stomach and places thereabout, swelling
and blowing vp the same, and therein begetting rebellious obstructions hardly
taken away and remoued, as also it causeth troublesome dreames, and cold and durable
diseases.
                     New wines which are not as yet throughly digested,New wines or the iuice of grapes which haue 
                              •
                           ately wrought vp. are in temperature and facultie
very like vnto the new pressed liquor of grapes, for euen they are so far off from
perfection, as that they also become of hard digestion, and which is more, doe not
easily passe through the bowels and veines, or prouoke vrine any thing at all, being
the great and soueraigne helpes which are to be looked for to come from wine. Yea

Yea furthermore, they oftentimes hang and lie long in the bodie, and become very
subiect to soure in the stomach, if there bee but some small quantitie thereof taken
more than is conuenient.
                     Wine which is well and sufficiently digested and wrought,The benefit of wine. and thereby purified
and fined from all such excrements and lees, as either the new pressed liquor is woont
to cast vp, or the same after further digestion is woont to settle downe to the bottome,
hath its vertues and properties all quite contrarie, vnto the vices and inconueniencies
which accompanie the raw liquor and newly concocted wines: for it is concocted
easily, and caried through the bowels and veines quickly, it bringeth downe
and asswageth the fulnesse and swellings rising about the principall parts of windie
or distending causes, as crudities and such like: it deliuereth the wombe or matrix
from such obstructions, as the naturall excrements thereof are woont to breed therein:
it increaseth the strength of all the instrumentall parts: it maketh way for the
euacuation of all manner of excrements, and so prouoketh sweat, but principally
vrine: it causeth sleepe, and cureth cold poisons: it strengthneth the stomach more
than all the rest of the parts of the bodie, as being first receiued and intertained into
the same, and hereupon in becommeth a great friend to digestion, prouoketh appetite
succoureth and relieueth the heart by speciall propertie, thereby speedily repairing
such naturall and vitall spirites, as haue beene wasted by sodaine euacuation,
wastings, or other occasions: it nourisheth also, preserueth, sustaineth and strengthneth
naturall heate, whereas it beginneth to faile. Heereby it worketh vpon the vnderstanding
awaking, and raising it vp, cheereth, and encourageth the faint and languishing,
and recreateth and reioiceth the spirites, in regard whereof, Homer saith,
that the Gods haue giuen wine to men, for the driuing away of their cares and troubles.
And Socrates a guest at Platoes feast, praiseth the moderate vse of wines in
feasts and banquets, because (as he saith) it quickneth a man to that which is good,
and maketh the minde more readie to execute his offices and dueties. Lastly, wine
maketh the colour more liuely and cherri-like and is found a most excellent, speedie,
and singular remedie against all sownings and faintings which happen through
excessiue euacuation, or crudities molesting and troubling the vpper mouth of the
stomach. And in as much as it attenuateth, concocteth, and discusseth crud and
cold humours, and flatuosities abounding in flegmaticke and melancholicke persons,
it becommeth a most excellent drinke, not onely for flegmaticke and melancholicke
ones, but also for all such as are of a cold and moist disposition of
bodie, but especially for old folkes, and principally in Sommer, in such countries as
are giuen to be cold.
                  
                  
                     The annoiances, hurts, and discommodities of wine.
                     ANd yet notwithstanding that wine surpasse in excellencie and goodnesse all
other sorts of drinkes, it worketh many annoiances by reason of its quantitie,
qualitie, or vaporousnesse.The hurts and inconueniencies that wine worketh. The most notorious and common annoiance that the vaporousnesse
of the wine doth cause, is drunkennesse,Drunkennesse. which as Athenaeus recordeth,
maketh men sots and senselesse, and yet so talkatiue and pratling, as that they cannot
hold their peace, neither yet conceale any thing they know: wherupon the prouerbe
groweth, that wine goeth barefoot,Wine goeth bare-foot. because the drunkard lieth open and naked on
euery side, and couereth or hideth things no more than the steele-glasse, for which
cause the Poet Aeschilus hath written, that the pictures of mens bodies are commonly
to be seene in brasse: but the shape and fashion of the mind in wine; And Plato
affirmeth, that the manners and disposition of euerie man is knowne by wine. The
Poet Theognis doth likewise aduertise vs, that as gold is proued in the fire, so the vnderstanding
part of man by wine, in these verses:

                           Quale sit admotis explorant ignibus aurum:
                           Mens hominis vinum, sana sit anne probat.
                        
                     
                     Notwithstanding, when the braine is full of flegme, the immoderate vse of wine

doth not so much make such men to be giuen to much talke, as to feele great heauinesse
in their heads, and to fall into deepe and sound sleepe. Auncient writers, as saieth
Plutarch, consecrated the disease called the Lethargie, vnto Dionysius, because that
such as spoile themselues with drinking of wine, for the most part fall into such kind
of blockishnesse, feeling such a drowsie heauinesse in the head, forgetting to remember
what they should do, and suffering themselues to fall right downe like dead men:
For wine (as Aristotle obserueth) fitteth the seuerall natures of diuers humours,

applieth it selfe thereunto, howsoeuer that when it maketh drunken, it driueth the

all the senses. Notwithstanding, it maketh not all drunkards in all points alike, for
some it maketh lumpish and drowsie, as such (as I haue said before) as haue their
braines replea

and those are such as are subiect to blacke choler: and againe, other some mute and
dreaming, as those which are subiect to a cold melancholicke humour. Furthermore,
such as become foolish and senselesse by hauing drunke too much wine,
their braine being silled with great quantitie of bloud and spirite, do
                           •
                         feele a heate
throughout their whole bodie, but chiefely in their head, except they be such as wax
cold and benummed through their folly, as in whom the naturall heat is not quickned
and kindled, but rather smoothered and choaked by reason of the excessiue
quantitie of wine which they haue taken: no otherwise than the fire is quenched
when there is too much wood heaped vpon it, and the flame of the lampe put out
when there is too much oyle in the lampe. For as a little deale of fire is choaked
through a great heape of wood: euen so naturall heate is oftentimes strangled vpon
the sudden, by the excessiue and immoderate drinking of wine. But and if it
be yet so drunke immoderately, as that it cannot extinguish and suddenly destroy
the naturall heate, at the least by snubbing and checking of naturall heate, hurting
and infeebling his actions, as also in diminishing the strength of the bodie
by surcharging of it with heauie loades of superfluities: accidently it cooleth in
such sort, as that it bringeth to nothing and quite vndoeth the prouocations and
acts of lust, which of it selfe and by its owne nature it might otherwise maruellously
prouoke.That drunkards their seed and nature is not apt for generation. And hereupon it is that Aristotle sayeth, That the seed of drunkards

drunken sit being passed ouer, the partie come againe to the enioying of his former
estate, and seeme to bee well) if it remaine long time in the braine, and being fast
setled therein, grow further and gather more vnto it, doth in the end stirre vp many
diseases of the head, as hardnesse of hearing, deafenesse, noyses in the eares, blindnesse,

On the other side, if this excrement gathered in the braine by the immoderate
vse of wine, happen to fall downe vpon the inferiour parts, it will breed many
distillations, and catarrhes, hoarsnes, rheumes, coughs, gouts, difficulty of breathing▪
and many other symptomes, very hard to be cured: yea and by its vaporoushes, how

excrement ingendred in the head, getteth there such a kind of enimitie and aduerse
qualitie, and that so at iarre and malitiously bent against the ioints, as that it rusheth
it selfe in its distillations, rather vpon the ioints than vpon any other parts, and so
causeth gouts and ioint aches. Finally, this excrement being of a subtile and sharp
substance, falleth and penetrat

                           •
                        nces which wine of
it selfe and by its very nature causeth. For in as much as it is of a hot and drie temperature,
if it be not drunke moderately and well delaied, by the long vse thereof in hot
and drie bodies, it is woot to ouer heat and drie their noble parts, to ingender great
of cholericke humours, which standing without remooue and motion, must needs
breed many maladies and diseases.
                     From hence spring out agues both continuall and intermittent, inflamations of
the inward parts, as the liuer, spleene, and lungs, the plurifie, passion of the reines, and
such other inflamations of many other parts, which haue not as yet any proper name
assigned them. Hence likewise grow all itches, tetters, wild fires, flying fires, cankers,
and all sorts of vlcers. Those therefore that are prone and apt to fall into
such inconueniencies of diseases, or which are alreadie through the ill ordering of
their life fallen into the same, must altogether abstaine the drinking of wine, or at
the least drinke but a very little, yea though it should be very weake and well delaied
with water. The old writers, and amongst others, Cicero in his third booke of the
nature of the gods, thought it good, that seeing wine doth seldome profit, and hurt
very often, that it were better not to permit it at all to be vsed of those which are sick,
rather than vnder a conceited hope of some doubtfull health, to expose and lay them
open to manifest daunger by the vse thereof. Notwithstanding we dayly find, that
the vse of wine is very commodious and profitable for cold and moist complexions
being such as are troubled with cold and moist diseases. Wherefore the wise and
well aduised Physitian may tollerate the vse thereof, when he knoweth that there is
need for the concoction of some cold diseases: yea and oftentimes also in cold
diseases, as in such whose conioyned and next cause, he findeth to be nourished and
maintained by some primitiue and antecedent cause that is hot.
                  
                  
                     That it is not good for such as are in health to vse pure and vnmixt wine.
                     THe learned of auncient time haue alwaies permitted the moderate vse of wine
being delayed with water,That vndelaied wine is not wholesome for such as be in health. when it should be vsed of them which were whole,
but haue alwaies reiected and disallowed pure and vndelayed wine, as also surfetting,
and that in their feasts and bankets. For Hesiodus commaundeth that there should
be three thirds of water mixed with one fourth part of wine, and this not to be vsed
commonly, but at some solemne feasts and bankets. Athenaeus writeth, that the Grecians
vsed to drinke two glasses of wine, delaied with fiue glasses of water, or one
glasse of wine delaied with three glasses of water.What qu

which are growne vp to greater yeares,For what ages wine is m

destroyeth and ouerthroweth their hot and moist constitution, vvhich Hippocrates
commandeth to be maintained by things that are moist. And that it is so, we see, that
such children as vse to drinke vvine, howsoeuer it be dilayed (their liuer being dried
and ouer-heated by the conti

                        all vse of the said vvine) doe fall, for the most part,
into a long and lasting flux of the belly, and in the end into an irrecouerable hectick
feuer, vvhich the common people call a withering and pining away, and out of
which there is not one of a hundred that escapeth. For this cause Galen was altogether
against the giuing of children any tast of vvine, as also any others, who like children
are of a hot and moist temperature and constitution, because that by his vaporousnesse
it filleth the braine, and doth infinite hurt and mischiefe. Plato in his precepts
of ordering a Commonwealth, commaundeth children to be kept from vvine
till they be fifteene yeares old, and his reason is, for that fire must not be added vnto
fire: from fifteene vnto fortie he permitteth the moderate vse thereof: and after this
age he aduiseth to drinke much, and that very good, for the mitigating and qualifying
of the discommodious, troublesome, and noysome occurrences which may happen
in the life of man. And this his opinion is not altogether to be reiected: for as
vvine is altogether enemie vnto children, so it maketh recompence in the good it
doth vnto old persons. Plinie saith, That vvine hindereth those which prepare themselues
to doe, speake, or enterprise any good thing: and this was the cause why Plato
forbad the vse of vvine to sage and learned men, except it were in their feasts or sacrifices.
The Romans for sundry reasons did likewise forbid the vse of vvine to women
and seruants. We reade in histories, That the vertues of many famous and great
personages, haue beene obscured and eclipsed by the vse of vvine. Of this, wee haue

and good disposer of all his matters and affaires, saue that of the vse of vvine; Antioch

Dionysius the younger, the tyrant, Zenocrates the Philosopher, Anacreon and
Alcaeus the Lyricke Poets, and Aristophanes the Comedian, Ennius, Marcus Antonius
Triumuir, Cato Vticensis, and such others. For this cause the Locri inhabiting the
Promontorie Zephirium in Greece (as Athenaeus recordeth) thought it to be an offence
worthie death for to drinke vvine. Of the same opinion at this day are the Sarazins,
moued thereto as well by Mahomets law, as also by the imitating of the ancient
custome of the Gentils and Arabians. Let vs then conclude, that vvine, not onely
in excessiue quantitie,That wine is hurtfull vnto hat and drie natures, and good vnto moist ones. and by reason of his vaporousnesse, doth cause all the annoyances
alreadie set downe, but that also in respect of his heat and drinesse it is most pernicious
vnto hot and drie natures, as also vnto hot and moist ones, if it be not well dilayed,
especially if it be continually vsed, though it be taken in neuer so moderate a
quantitie: And yet notwithstanding more or lesse, according to age, custome, and
manner of liuing, the season of the yeare, and constitution of the ayre: because that
in old folke, and all such as in vvhom crude flegme and melancholike iuice doth abound,
his heat and drinesse is in such sort rebated, that for the most part it is vsed
of them very safely and securely, both as a well nourishing, and likewise as a good
Physicall helpe, especially in Winter and cold Countries. You must therefore, in all
sorts of natures, so temper all his noysome qualities by the mingling of water, as that it
may be taken with the least hurt that possibly may be. When as therefore the vvine
is mixt with the water, the parts both of the one and the other are broken and parted
(as it were) into small inuisible portions, vvhereupon there ariseth betwixt them
both a mutuall doing and suffering, and their qualities so confounded and becomming
one (notwithstanding their former contrarietie) as that into how much the
lesse parts the diuision is made, by so much the more apt and easie they proue to be
mingled and made one. Whosoeuer therefore shall mingle vvine vvith vvater, or
vvater vvith vvine, must first stirre them a long time, and then before he drink them,
let them settle and rest a while: because for certainetie, the contrarie qualities of

the wine and water will be so much the more repressed, corrected, rebated and vnited,
by how much they are the longer time and the more exactly mingled together.

as we shall declare hereafter. But this is enough which hath beene said of wine in
generall: now let vs examine all the particular differences of the same.
                  
                  
                     The differences of Wine.
                     IN wine wee are to consider the colour,The differences of Wine. relish, smell, facultie, and consistence, for
from these are taken and gathered the principall differences of Wine. As concerning
the colour, some is white, some of a light, some of a sad yellow, some betwixt red
and white, like to the colour of honie, other some of a deep red, and others of a pleasanter
red, blacke, or darke shadowed.
                     White wine generally is of a thinner s
                           •
                        bstance than the red, it is easily concocted
and digested, it pierseth speedily through the whole bodie, worketh more vpon the
veines, but no
                           •
                        risheth lesse. That sort of white Wine which is thinne, hot and full of
Wine, is concocted and distributed more speedily than any of the rest, purging the
bloud by vrine: but it offendeth the head most of all, especially French white Wine.
Water by reason of its coldnesses, and red or darke shadowed Wine by reason of
its thicknesse doe slowly passe away by vrine. The contrarie is found in white Wine,
especially such as is of a thin substance, and which is hot. That which is of a deepe
yellow, or somewhat inclining to a yellow, hath his vertues, approching very neere
to those of the white Wine.
                     Red Wine is woont to be more slow of concoction than all the rest, as also to bee
distributed throughout the whole bodie,Red Wine or darke coloured. or carried away by vrine, because it is of a
grosser substance than any of the rest; but yet to recompence these discommodities
withall, it nourisheth more, and offendeth the head lesse. The lighter red Wine
holdeth the meane and middle catch of all the rest. White Wine which is of a thin
and waterie substance without any verdure or sharpnes of tast, such as we haue great
store of here in our countrie, is likewise of an easie digestion, and quickly passing and
distributed through the body, and yet notwithstanding hurteth not the head, neither
increaseth any great store of heate, in so much as that this kind of white Wine
is more wholesome and safe both for the sound and sicke, than the white Wine which
is thinne and full of Wine in taste, especially in persons that are fat and full bodied,
because it nourisheth lesse than all the rest. Galen is of iudgement, that red and thick
Wines are turned without any great paine into bloud, and so next vnto them the
blacke or deepe red and grosse wines, if so be they be accompainied with some small
smatch of sweetnesse: and next vnto these which are of a light red, those which are
of a deepe red, thicke substance, and astringent facultie, nor for that they can
be digested more easily, or distributed more speedily, than white or yellow Wines,
but because that being once concocted in the stomach, and sent vnto the liuer, they
are easily changed and turned into bloud, notwithstanding they seeme not the least
remoued and differing from the nature of the same: for white and yellow Wines of
all other are woont to be the speediliest concocted in the stomach, and to bee conueied
vnto the liuer: but they yeeld lesse store of bloud then those which are thick
and red, and so doe fat lesse. Wherefore yellow Wine, or the redlike Wine being of a
thinne and pearsing substance, by how much it approcheth the neerer vnto the faculties
of thinne white Wine, by so much it begetteth the thinner and more fluent
bloud, and therewithall hot if it be hot, or temperate if it bee waterish and weake,
such as the Grecians vse to call Oligophorum, which signifieth a Wine admitting
but small quantitie of water to be mixed therewith: yea a reasonable cold bloud, if
it be yet somewhat greene and vnripe. But the deepe red Wine which is harsh and
rough, whereas for its thickenesse it is profitable to comfort the loose and wearish

stomach, but nourisheth not much: so in like manner it increaseth and redoubleth
the obstructions of the liuer, spleene, and reines, as also it maketh a thicke, 
                           〈◊〉
                        ,
and melancholike blood, &amp; so withal begetteth many melancholike diseases. The red
wine that is somewhat cleere and thin, seemeth to hold of both, and so standeth as a
meane betwixt them both. Wherefore Dioscorides following the opinion of Hippocrates
hath rightly said, that deepe red wines were thicke, and of hard concoction
and digestion: for all thicke wines, whether they be of a deepe or light red, do nourish
(to speake the trueth) aboundantly, and fat the bodie, but they put the stomach
to more paine in concocting of them, than those which are somewhat cleere
and of a thinne substance. Furthermore, they being of hard digestion and distribution,
and not easily passing away by vrine, through the long and continuall vse
of them, they ingender flatuous swelling, and windieneffe in the bellie and bowels.
Wherefore yellow and white wines, that are of a subtile substance and very ripe,
are to bee better accounted of, and esteemed as more wholesome for all such as haue
need, or desire to bee heated, as old folkes, flegmaticke, and melancholike persons
that be cold of nature, as also for them that lead their liues in idlenesse, in cold co

astringent, are farre more meete and conuenient, because they bee not so fuming,
and therefore doe not charge the head so heauily. But as for deepe red wines,
they are most fit and conuenient for diggers and deluers, husbandmen, dressers of
vines, and others which liue a toilesome and painefull life. Wherefore white wines,
yellow, red, or claret, and of those onely such as are of a subtile substance, delicate

together with the claret, weake, waterie, rawe, and greenish, being of a cold and
moist temperature, (such as are very vsuall and common in the grounds about Paris)
do nourish the bodie very little, and are harder to be digested, than those which

as they nourish but a little, they are said on the other side to make the body leane.
They bring not any detriment or harme vnto the head, liuer, reines, or bladder,
but being long vsed, they hurt the stomach, bowels, matrix, and spleene very much:
and which is more, are professed enemies to all such as are cold and moist by nature,
and especially vnto old folkes. Contrariwise, they are somewhat profitable for
hot and drie natures, and if naturall heat be strong, they passe away, and are euacuated
easily by vrine, and this is a thing that is common to all greene wines which are
of a subtile substance. The like iudgement is to bee had of diseases, for as they are tolerated
with all securitie in hot natures, so in like manner they prolong and increase
cold diseases. And thus sufficiently as it seemeth vnto me, concerning the nature, qualitie,
and vse of wine, gathered from the colour thereof.
                     As concerning the relish: some wines are sweet: some sharp: some bitter: some
rough and harsh: some sower and tart, and both of them astringent: others of a mixt
nature, betwixt sweet and rough; others greene or greenish, and these are very common
and vsuall in the grounds about and belonging to Paris.
                     In generall, all sweete wines,Sweet wines. whether they be white or red, do nourish more than
other, heat indifferently, prouoke thirst, swell and stop through the much vse thereof
the prnicipall parts, but the liuer and the spleene more than all the rest, especially
if they be grosse and thicke, for looke how much the thicker they bee, so much

the more vnwholesome they are. Sweet wine (saieth Hippocrates) doth lesse burthen
and charge the head, then that which is strong and full of wine, it lesse offendeth the
vnderstanding also, yea it looseth the bellie, but it is not good for such as abound with
colericke humours, for that it prouoketh thirst and windinesse. True it is that it is
good for such as are much troubled with the cough, because it raiseth vp flegme the
more easily in all such, except they be subiect to thirst and drinesse.
                     Sweet white wineSweet white wine. is of a thinner substance, than sweet red wine. It helpeth spitting
more than any other, so that it bee not too grosse and thicke, for it concocteth
raw flegme in the brest, it smootheth and maketh plaine the roughnesse of the inward
parts, and in that respect is profitable for the l
                           •
                        ngs, reines, or bladder being
rugged or rough: but in the meane time it hurteth the liuer, because that as I haue
here while said, it swelleth and puffeth it vp, and causeth obstructions therein. It
causeth thirst likewise in hot and drie natures, because it maketh obstructions, and is
easily turned into choleticke matter, as all other things are which are sweete. Notwithstanding,
it procureth drunkennesse lesse than any other, in as much as it offendeth
the head but a little. Dioscorides hath spoken very rightly thereof, saying, that
such sweet wine is of thicke substance, that it passeth not so easily through the bodie,
and that therefore it nourishet
                           •
                         more than that which is of a thinne consistence
and substance. Hee saieth further, that it swelleth vp the stomach, and like the liquor
of grapes before it hath wrought, it looseth and troubleth the bellie and inward
parts. And this must bee vnderstood of sweet wine, which is not come yet
to his full ripenesse, and not of that which is thinne, cleare, ripe, and alreadie
throughly concocted. Which kind of sweete white wines are sent hither in great
aboundance from the countrie of Aniou, and they hold their sweetnesse two or three
yeares.
                     Such sweet white wines are not so hurtfull as those which are not ripe, or which
are thicke: they prouoke vrine sufficiently, loosen the bellie, and moisten. Wherefore
you must diligently and wisely discerne and distinguish the sweet wine which is crud
and vnconcted, from that which is already ripe, and fit for to be vsed.
                     All sweet white wines do nourish aboundantly, but yet more or lesse, according
to the proportion of their thicknesse and grosnesse, and for this cause such as haue
need of restoratiues must vse sweet wines, especially if their reines liuer, and spleene
stand sound and free from all infermitie: for when the principall parts be obstructed,
and the veines full of grosse bloud, then wine that is of subtile substance is most
needfull and profitable. When the veins are replete with cold and grosse bloud, then
sharpe, strong, and mightie wines are more conuenient. If the veines be full of hot
and thicke bloud, the wine that is sharpe and old is not good, but rather a claret or
white wine that is very watrie, yea, and somewhat greenish, if the stomach wil beare
it, and the soile of the countrie permit it.
                     
                        Galen affirmeth that no white wine heateth greatly,Galens iudgement of white wine. and that such as heateth much,
cannot bee sweete. And yet notwithstanding, there are brought vnto vs out of hot
countries many white wines that are very hot. And we haue likewise sweet vvines
partly growing in our owne countrie of France, as at Longiumeau, and Tonnerrois,
called vvhite beaten vvine: partly brought from the countrie of Anjou, excellent
good, and very hot, which in taste resemble the sauour and relish of a Hippocras
made of vvhite vvine, and will hold and continue sound and perfect good,
three, foure, yea sixe yeares. In Greece their vvhite vvines are not found to bee
very pleasant and sweet, as in this our countrie there are not to be found any red wines
very pleasant, except vpon their new pressing out. Notwithstanding the countrie
of Bordelois doth furnish vs with sufficient quantitie of red wines, that are very sweet,
but they are all of them of a thicke substance, and their iuice or liquor breedeth very
many obstructions.
                     Harsh and course vvines do procure vrine more than the sweet,Rough and harsh wines. but lesse than such
as are of a middle kind betwixt both, and yet againe, those which are tart and sower,
doe also prouoke vrine more weakely than those vvhich are of a middle temper.

The rough and course wine doth corroborate the stomacke and principall parts by
his astringent facultie, prouided that the stomack be furnished with sufficient strength
and force of heat, for otherwise in a cold and weake stomack it proueth, for the most
part, to be hardly concocted and digested. Of all other vvines, it least hurteth the
head, but therewithall it proueth to be the slowest in distributing it selfe abroad into
the veines and substance of the bodie: for which reasons, it falleth out to be vnfit to
be vsed in swownings, sodaine faintings, and all other feeblenesse, loosenesse, and languishing
of the strength, as also where there are any notorious obstructions in the
principall parts. But which more is, it bindeth the bellie, or else looseth it not
sufficiently.
                     We haue spoken of greenish white wines,Greene wines. whereunto the reddish greene wine hath
like qualities, especially if it be of a thinne substance and waterie, and yet more, if it
be thinne, waterie, and pale.
                     Generally, the greene or raspe wine, in as much as it containeth more water than
wine, nourisheth the bodie but a little, is of hard digestion, and so it moueth windinesse
and wringings in the belly, because it is of a cold temperature. Hence it commeth,
that old folkes, cold and moist natures, and such as haue weake stomackes, receiue
damage by it: and next vnto these, such women as haue not their termes aright,
and are subiect to pale and swarth colours. Notwithstanding it passeth away speedily
by vrine, because it is thinne, and annoyeth not the head: and for this reason it is
very profitable for all hot and moist natures, as for young folkes, vvhich haue a boyling
and burning bloud in them, if their stomacke be in good state, especially in
Summer time: for which respect, being dilayed with a sufficient quantitie of vvater,
it will serue very fitly (in like manner as the vvine called of the Greekes Oligophorum)
in all such agues as wherein wine may be permitted, saue onely that it is somewhat
hard of digestion, and causeth many obstructions. Such greene vvines, as together
with their greenenesse are astringent or sowre, are without comparison more
hurtfull than any other euery way, and in all respects, because they hardly ripen, and
concoct, ingender obstructions, and passe very slowly either by vrine or stoole. Notwithstanding,
they become ripe in time, if they be let alone in cellars till the raw and
crude parts thereof be ouercome by their owne proper and naturall heat. But it shall
not seeme to exceed the bounds of reason, if wee discourse somewhat more freely of
the verdure of our vvines, to the end wee may be able to discerne and find out that
which is in vvines by way of purchase, from that which is naturally in them. Galen
writeth, That the astringent qualitie in vvines is separated and remaining apart
from their verdure, as their goodnesse is from their badnesse: besides, it is very likely,
that in hot and drie Countries there are not any greene vvines growing naturally:
but in this our Countrie of France there are many greenish vvines pressed out from
grapes that are not yet ripe: but especially in cold and moist yeares, some which are
verie thinne and waterie: others more thicke and grosse, and by that meanes either
astringent, or else rough and harsh: strong and mightie vvines, if they be neuer so
little tainted with greenenesse, presently they become sowre, and altogether vnmeet
to be drunke. But such as being pressed out from grapes, scarce halfe ripe, differ
not much from the greenenesse or sharpenesse of common veriuice, if they be not
concocted by little and little through a strong and forcible heat contained in their
crude and raw matter, and so in the end become ripe, their greenenesse being by
little and little diminished: and such are not passing of a yeares continuance; seruing
rather for the rude and homely people, than for daintie and delicate personages.
For certaine, all greenenesse in vvine is a fault in those vvines vvherein it is:
but yet that is the worst of all the rest which happeneth vnto vvines sometimes
good and commendable, either by being kept too long, or else by hauing beene ill
kept, or otherwise by some other occasion: lesse dispraiseable and hurtfull, vvithout
comparison, is that which happeneth in our French wines, which by the weakenesse
of the heat of the Sunne, comming short of their sufficient concoction, become greene
from their first originall and growth, as they which are greene, by reason of the greene

and vnripe grapes, from whence they are pressed. For such greenenesse as happeneth
vnto vvines once good and commendable, is hurtfull vnto all men, and cannot
be redressed, thereby making such vvines vnfit to be employed about any other vse
than either for medicine or sawces: vvhereas that which is borne and ingrafted into
such greene vvines, if it be not suppressed and digested by naturall heat, becommeth
onely hurtfull to cold and moist constitutions and old folkes, but not vnto strong,
Iustie, and hot natures, neither vnto them which are accustomed to trauaile, and to auoid
idlenesse. You shall find many harsh, rough, and sowre vvines, vvhich are also
greene: and in like manner, you shall find some that are greene, and yet not rough
and course. Such as are rough and greene, through their vehement astringencie, doe
close, shut vp, drie, and dull the throat, tongue, and other parts of the mouth: whereas
such as are simply greene, doe not the like, but coole them onely. The rough
and harsh vvines, in as much as they are raw and crude, and cannot be concocted
and digested of their naturall heat that is but weake; yet they close and bind the stomack,
and by such occasion stay the 
                           •
                        lux of the bellie. Wines that are simply greene,
doe not the like, if they be not harsh, rough, and astringent withall: and they doe
rather annoy the stomacke and all the membranous and neruous parts by reason of
their cooling propertie and qualitie: vvhich being situate in a thinne and subtile matter,
and therefore apt to pierce deepely into the parts, and by their qualities prouoking
and disquieting the substance of the said parts, doth corrupt and dissolue the
laudable temperature, force, and constitution of the said stomacke, and of the said
membranous and sinewie parts. Whereupon it ensueth, that such greene vvines
doe for the most part cause crudities, wringings, and the flux of the belly, manifold
obstructions of the liuer and spleene, besides the disease called the Hypochondriake
melancholie. Galen denieth, that vvines which are hard and greene, doe heat at all,
and that the sowre, rough, and harsh rellish doth actually consist in a meane matter,
participating both of the waterie and earthie elements: but that the hard, greene,
and sowre relish doth consist in an earthie and drie substance, vvhich doth not manifestly
participate of the water, or any moisture. Whereby it may manifestly appeare,
that neither the one nor the other relish hath any heat ruling in it, but cold, and that
in the tart, harsh, and rough relish accompanied with moisture, but in the sowre with
drinesse. But for as much as vvines are seldome consisting of one onely simple and
pure relish, and that all vvines (of what tast or relish soeuer they be) are in temperature
hot and drie, you must vnderstand, that sowre and harsh vvines are accounted
cold, or else not hot, not simply, but by comparison, because indeed they heat lesse
than other vvines, and that not quickly, and so soone as they be drunk, but in the end,
and aftersome continuance of time: for otherwise the opinion of Galen were not to
be receiued, seeing that we obserue and see euerie day, that all sorts of vvines, of what
tast or relish soeuer they be, be they hard or harsh, doe heat manifestly, and make
men drunke sooner or later, if they be receiued into a hot and strong stomacke: for
their heat, as a thing buried in crude and raw matter, although it be a long time
first, and with great difficultie, breaketh forth at the last, manifesting it selfe in the
end, and bringing forth the fruits of his maturitie: and this wee may finde in our
French vvines, which nourish, maintaine, recreate, yea, and make drunke the Husbandmen,
Vine-dressers, and other persons of poore handicrafts vsing to drinke the
same. But let this suffice which hath beene said of the naturall tast and relish of
vvines: and now let vs search out the causes of the sowrenesse or tartnesse, incident
to good and commendable vvines.The cause of sowrenesse in wines. Some thinke, that vvines grow sowre through
heat, because that daintie, weake, and feeble vvines are changed and turne sowre in
the Spring time and Summer, and in Winter retaine their naturall qualities entire
and sound. This opinion is confirmed, because that weake vvines being stirred and
tumbled in forcible sort, or carried farre, or laid in cellars that are open vpon the
South or Easterne quarter, doe quickly become sowre. And contrarily, such as are not
tossed to and fro, or remoued, but kept in cellars lying vpon the North, doe not sowre
at all: as if it were by the cold, that their vertues and good qualities were preserued,

and by the heat, that they were changed and corrupted. So as the like in all points
doth befall vvines which are weake and waterish, to that which happeneth vnto a
burning candle, and to small and weake sparkes of fire, vvhich if you lay open in
the hot Sunne, or before any great and vehement flame, you shall see them languish,
yea waxe darke, and altogether to fade away and goe out. It is then through heat,
that all the weakest vvines turne sowre, and that by hauing their weake heat spent
and ouercome by an outward and accidentall heat, which is more strong, causing
the same to fade, and for the most part vanish quite away: For a weake nature cannot
endure either any strong heat, or vehement motion, but fainting vnder them, it
becommeth wasted and spent, and in fine perisheth. But contrariwise, wines which
haue their heat strong, and consist of such matter as is not easie or apt to be wasted
and spent, being remoued, rolled, transported, or else laid open to the South Sunne,
or kept in any hot place, doe not onely not sowre quickly, and in a short time, but
rather become a great deale the more ripe, and are made more readie and better to
be drunke. For that which befalleth through long continuance of time to strong,
mightie, and noble vvines, vvhich are shut vp and layd in cold ca
                           •
                        es vnder the
earth, by the meanes, power, vertue, and 
                           •
                        fficacie of their owne and naturall heat,
which concocteth, digesteth▪ and ripeneth by little and little their crude and raw
matter: the same is effected and wrought in a short time in vvines which are heated
by art, that is to say, by stirring and rowling, and by the heat of the Sunne, or
of some fine subtill fire, vvhich doth concoct and digest the most crude and raw
matter that they can be found to haue. For as the enduring of the heat of the Sunne,
and the vnder-going of vehement exercises, maketh stronger and more able the bodies
of men that are hot and lustie, but on the contrarie, doth ouerthrow, weaken,
dissolue, and coole weake bodies: euen so, hot vvines are sooner ripe, concocted,
and digested, by heat, or mouing either of the Sunne, or of some hot fire made
neere vnto them: but those which are more weake and waterie, if you heat them
ouer-much, doe take great dammage and harme, and are weakened more by the
working of such vehement heat, either of the Sunne, stirring, or fire, vvhich corrupteth
and spendeth at once, and in a moment, some part and portion of their weake
and feeble heat, vvhich afterward, in like manner, by little and little, will be ouercome
and wasted, and thereupon such vvines weakened and made vnsauourie. It is
the meane and middle heat therefore that all things receiue profit by: seeing the
immoderate and extreame is no lesse harmefull than cold. Wherefore, after that
the weake heat of vvine shall, for the most part, become wasted and spent, by the
outward heat of the ayre compassing it round about, it groweth sowre: and so likewise
it is wont to fall out by the maliciousnesse of strong and piercing cold, breaking
the heart of the weake heat in the vvine, and thereby killing the same. For
when the said heat is quite ouercome and banished, so as that the vvine looseth his
fragrant odour and pleasant sent of vvine, it is not said to sowre, and therefore not
called vineger, but indeed is called by the name, not of vvine, but of decayed and
spent vvine, which the Latines call Vappa. Furthermore, vvhereas amongst waterie,
weake, and feeble vvines, there are some raw and greenish ones, vvhich wee haue
declared alreadie to be enemies vnto cold and moist natures: and other, which are
neither raw, not greenish, but delicate ones, and throughly ripe, but therewithall of a
thinne and subtile substance, and which for their easinesse to be concocted, and speedinesse
in being distributed, become very good and profitable both for sound and
sicke, and are called of the Greekes Oligophora, because they will not admit the
mingling of any great quantitie of water with them: The first may, without any iniurie
offered vnto their strength, abide to be stirred and carried to and fro, especially
if with this naturall greenenesse there be ioined some harshnesse and roughnesse.
But the second cannot endure to be remoued or carried to and fro: the reason is, the
heat of the first is hid, and lyeth in a crude and raw matter, whereof it standeth it vpon,
as much as lyeth in it, to acquite and rid it selfe: a readie helpe whereunto, is the
moouing and stirring of the same, because hereby it is enabled the sooner to shew

forth it selfe, and to manifest his force in more powerfull and chearefull manner than
before, because the crude and raw matter wherein it lay, as it were couered and hid,
is become refi
                           •
                        ed and concocted in processe of time. Contrariwise, the weake heat
of the second sort, which consisteth in a thinne matter or substance, and that alreadie
concocted, is spent and ouerthrowne with the least motion and hea
                           •
                        , and therefore
doth very easily euaporate and breath out all his force and strength. It seemeth that
the opinion of Galen and other auncient Writers, affirming that no greene wine doth
heat, must be vnderstood of this second sort of vvine, called of the Grecians Oligophora,
for that it is possible, that the old Writers neuer knew, neither euer heard tell,
that any greenish vvines were naturally growing in places and countries that are hot
and scorching.That there is great difference betwixt sowrenesse and greennesse in wines. Certainely, there is great difference betwixt that tartnesse or sowrenesse,
which is an accidentall vice or fault in vvines, and that greenenesse or sharpenesse,
which is a naturall tast and relish in them, pressed out either from grapes naturally
greene, or else from grapes which haue not as yet growne to their full maturitie
and ripenesse. For the tartnesse of vvines, besides the great sharpenesse and acrimonie
therein, being such as is in vineger, whereby it disquie
                           •
                        eth and offendeth the stomacke,
membranes, and all the sinewes, is likewise of that nature, as that it cannot by
any skill or cunning be subdued and corrected in such manner, as that the vvine once
tainted therewith, can at any time be restored vnto his former goodnesse, and made
such as may be drunke without the preiudice and hazard of mans health. But on the
contrarie, the greenenesse which continueth in vvines, as bred in them, besides that
it is alwaies free from the foresaid sharpenesse and acrimonie, is found not to continue
any long time, in as much as the raw and cold matter, vvherein the heat of greene
vvine consisteth, is concocted by little and little, and thereupon this heat (thus as it
were buried in this crude matter) doth by little and little grow strong, and sheweth

                           •
                        orth his force more effectually: so that the said greenenesse is by degrees diminished
and wrought out, and the vvine made a conuenient and profitable drinke for
the vse of men: yea, and that also euen where this greenenesse, through the weakenesse
and imbecilitie of heat, cannot any whit be wrought out and taken away: for
so wee finde it, seeing that greene vvines are not refrained, but ordinarily drunke,
and vsed.
                     
                        Dioscorides was of iudgement, That sowre and rough vvines caused headach and
drunkennesse, vvhereas our harsh and rough vvines, the rougher they are, doe offend
and annoy the head so much the lesse. And for a certaintie, all manner of drinke, by
how much it is the more odoriferous, and of a thinne and subtle substance, so much
the more it disquieteth and disturbeth the braine with his vapours, and ministreth
larger matter for the nourishment of rhewmes and distillations. Notwithstanding,
if sowre and rough vvines doe happen once to cause drunkennesse, then such drunkennesse
fall
                           •
                        th out to be of the worst sort, and most rebellious and hard to be ouercome.
So then, all our sowrish, harsh, and rough vvines, such as are those of Burgundie,
as they are nothing so odoriferous, so neither doe they cause any whit like so many
exhalations and vapours, and therefore also doe they lesse offend the head, and
procure drunkennesse, than any others: And so as that Galen hath therefore restified
of them, that they ought to be well accounted of and esteemed profitable and fit to
be vsed of such as haue the gowt, as also of all others which are subiect to the distillations
of the braine.
                     Such vvines are called mungrell or bastard vvines,What wines are to be called bastards. vvhich (betwixt the sweet and
astringent ones) haue neither manifest sweetnesse, nor manifest astriction, but indeed
participate and containe in them both the qualities.
                  
                  
                     Of the consistence of Wine.
                     AS concerning the consistence of vvine, some is of a thinne, subtle, and cleere
substance,The consistence of wine. and othersome of a thicke and grosse, and some of a meane and middle
consistence betwixt both. Of those which are of a thinne and subtle substance,

some are weake and waterish, which the Grecians call 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        , that is to say, not admitting
the mixture of any quantitie of water, of which we will speake more amply
hereafter, being (as it were) like vnto water in thinnesse and colour, and hauing little
or no sent in them, neither yet any manifest heate. They nourish but very little, for
there is is but a very little of their substance turned into bloud: but they cause great
store of vrine, and agree better than any other wines, with all sorts of natures, if wee
may beleeue Gal
                              •
                           n. There are other weake, waterish, and greenish wines, very ordinarie
in this countrie, which are hurtfull vnto old men, and all other cold constitutions,
as hauing in them very small store of heate: and yet sometime profitable vnto
hot constitutions, as in Sommer, according to our former aduertisement. There are
others that are very good, but hot and strong, of an easie concoction, and speedily
distributed, but nothing lesse vapourous than white wines, whereupon they trouble
the braine, and make men drunken, and so proue hurtfull to such as are rheumatike
and subiect to distillations. Such wines are brought hither out of Gascoigne, very
well pleasing princes, and men of great estate, all of them being of a yellow colour,
either deeper or lighter. The wines of Ay, as they are inferiour to them of Gascoigne
in strength, so they are better, and without comparison more wholesome.
                     The grosse and thicke wines, some of them are simply such, and consist in mediocriti
                           •
                        ,
and othersome are very grosse and thicke. We haue heretofore declared that
grosse wines are of a more hard concoction, and slow digestion than other wines are;
but being once concocted and digested, they yeeld a more firme and solide nourishment
vnto the bodie. And of them more than the rest, such as are very grosse and
thicke, which for certaine are hardest to be concocted and digested of all others.
These sorts of wine, for that they ingender many rebellious and obstinate obstructions,
are not fit to be vsed but of dressers of vineyards, and such other as leade a toilesome
life, as wee haue declared before. Such wines as are indifferent thin, and indifferent
thicke, are profitable for many purposes, and the rather in that they charge not
the head as the strong wines do, and those which are of subtile substance: neither yet
ingender obstructions, as those which are thicke and grosse doe. The wine called of
the Grecians Oligophorum, is the holesomest of all others.
                     Wine smelleth well,The

                            or smell of wine. or else nothing at all. The odoriferous wines are very apt
and commodious for the begetting of good humours, and to recreat and fetch againe
the powers of the bodie, but they assaile and charge the head, especially, if it be of a
subtile substance, and of a reddish or yellowish colour, or of a deepe yellow: they
are also more hot than the other sorts of wines. For that which is such, doth help very
much for the making of concoction easie, and for the begetting of fine and subtile
bloud, but it filleth the head full of vapours and heate, and greatly offendeth the sinewes
and vnderstanding: whereupon it proueth very apt to cause headach and a
world of rheume. The wine that hath small or no smell, no not any more than water,
is called waterish. Such vtter depriuation or want of smell in wine, is a mightie note,
and most certaine marke that the same is but a weake and cold wine: as the strong
and mightie smell of the same, is a very notable signe of his force and strength. Such
wine as is neither of an ill smell, neither yet without smell, but hath a certaine s
                           •
                        inging
and vnpleasant sent, which it hath gotten either of the soile, or of the vessell, or
by some other occasion, is not good for any bodie. For as nothing (as Columella testifieth)
draweth to it strange and vnnaturall sents more speedily than wise. In like sort
nothing impaireth or communicateth his hurtfull qualities sooner to the heart and
noble parts, than wine when it is drunke.
                     Amongst wines,The vertues of wine. some are generous and noble wines, and therefore said to be full
of wine, contrarie to those which are waterish, and admitting the mixture of much
water. These heate much, hurt the sinewes, make a full braine, stir vp frensies, mightily
increaseth the heate of agues, and to be briefe, they are not delayed with a great
quantitie of water, and doe good but to a few. There are other which are weake, and
for this cause called Oligophora and waterie.W

                           ake wines. These wines are of two sorts, some greenish
which haue a sensible cooling facultie, fitting cholericke stomaches and hot

countries, if so be that a strong stomacke can beare them, and of these wee haue spoken
before: others which are waterie, and of a thinne substance, not retaining any
smell, but agreeing with all natures, be the stomacke neuer so weake, and especially
with those which are often tormented with the megrim or long continued head-ach:
they comfort concoction, prouoke vrine and sweat, and offend the head nothing at
all: more harmelesse than any other sort of vvine: they may be permitted to such as
are sicke of agues, for that they cannot be said to be of any manifest qualitie, as other
vvines may: for they are neither sowre, nor astringent, neither yet sweet or sharpe,
nor yeelding any kind of smell. Of these kinds of vvine, some (as Galen saith) grow
in euery countrey and coast, but much more in this of France than in any other, the
greatest part whereof doe participate a certaine greenenesse, especially vvhen the
yeares fall out cold and moist. Such vvines are called of the Grecians 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        .
They are not any way noysome or hurtfull to the head, but very profitable, because
(as Galen saith) they asswage and take away head-ach, rising of the cruditie of the
stomacke: that is to say, when the stomacke being weakened, and (as it were) relaxed
by the eating of some hurtfull victuals, or by the drinking of some such like water,
is made the receptacle of some offending humour, 
                           •
                        lowing thither from the
whole bodie. Which offensiue humour so contained in the stomacke, becommeth
corrupt, and from that corruption sendeth vp burne and adust fumes vnto the braine,
which cause like paine in the head to that which commeth of fasting: and from these
annoyances the head is deliuered by the vse of this vvine▪ vvhich by and by tempereth
these putrified

                        umes, especially if the vvine haue any astringencie in it, whereby
the stomacke may be fortified and strengthened. For such vvines doe by and by
driue downeward that which is hurtfull in the stomacke, carrying it along with it
selfe, and casting it forth: and therefore verie auaileable for such as liue a loitering
and sitting life, and apply themselues wholly vnto the reading and studying of good
Authors.

                     IT remaineth now, that we briefely discourse of the wines which we vse in Paris, and
those such as are either growne there, or brought thither out of other Countries and
Regions. The French wines offer themselues in the first ranke, which growing in the
grounds &amp; borders neere about Paris, and the whole Isle of Fraunce, and other places
adioyning thereunto, are amongst all others, and aboue all others, best agreeing with
students, Citizens of Townes: and to be briefe, with all such as liue a quiet, idle, and
restfull life, especially those which are made in well seasoned yeares, or such as shew
forth their seuerall qualities, euerie one in his proper and due season. For such wines
doe not heat, burne, and dry the inward parts of the bodie, as the wines doe which are
brought vs from Gascoignie, Spaine, and other countries more hot, vvhich by reason
of excessiue heat, and too great drinesse, do burne the liuer and spleene in such as drink
them: Such wines doe not make a replete, heauie, or offended head with multitude of
vapours, as other vvines of Orleance doe. In like manner, such wines doe not load the
bodie with superfluousnesse of serous excrements, as doe the crude &amp; greenish wines,
which grow in these grounds in cold and moist yeares, or which are brought vs hither
from other cold Regions and Countries. Such wines likewise ingender no obstructions,
neither doe they gather any quantitie of melancholike humour, as doe the thicke
and red vvines, vvhich are sent vs by sea from Burdeaux. These vvines, vvhen they be
through ripe, they are of a very p
                           •
                        easant tast, especially such as are yellow, clarert, and
white, which are of a hot &amp; dry temperature, as other wines, but not aboue the first degree,
or the beginning of the second: on the contrarie, the wines of Spaine, Gascoigne,
and others such like, are hot &amp; drie in the end of the third degree. Wherfore these our
French and natiue wines ought to be preferred before all strange &amp; forraine ones, seeing
they burne and heat the bowels &amp; inward parts ouer-much, and that as wel for the

vse of such as are in health, as of those that being sicke, are yet permitted their vvine.
Amongst these our French vvines, some are white, othersome are of a deepe yellow,
commonly called clarets, or reddish vvines, vvhich are the most wholesome of all, so
that they be not accompanied with any sowrenesse and harshnesse: for rough &amp; harsh
vvines, and others which are greene, if they become not ripe and mellow in time, by
the concocting of their cruditie &amp; greenenesse, they stand for things not fit to be vsed
of any but rude and rusticall fellowes, vvhich liue by toyling their bodies vvith great
labour and trauell. The rest are all red, more or lesse. But of all other French vvines,
there is very small store of sad and light red coloured ones.
                     White claret vvines being bright, cleare, and through ripe or mellow, in as much
as they are of a subtle substance, are easily concocted, digested, and distributed: they
prouoke vrine, nourish the bodie but a little, but they reioyce the spirit, and are for
the same cause taken, longed after, and desired of all. Some of them are readie to be
drunke the second or third moneth: othersome not before the seuenth or eight
moneth. All of them begin to fade and loose their goodnesse in the beginning of
the second yeare. The red, although they be bright and cleare, are not of so subtile a
substance as the former, and therefore they nourish more, and are more fit for such as
liue hardly, than for such as liue delicately and nicely: and what although they cannot
bee so easily concocted and digested, nor so speedily distributed, neither yet
cause such aboundance of vrine, as those which are yellow, claret or white: yet trauell,
often exercises and labour doth ouercome all these inconueniencies, yea, and
whatsoeuer greater that such red wines may ingender and breed. Amongst them,
those which participate and haue any sourenes or astriction, become not mellow before
the Sommer heat, whereupon it followeth, that the second yeare, their crud and
raw parts being concocted and digested, they grow to bee more excellent than they
were in the first.
                     The deepe red and vermillion coloured are for the most part harsh and rough,
and so the most vnpleasant and vnwholesome of all other: for that they are woont
to bee ill concocted and digested, and slowly distributed, as also to ingender many
obstructions, and beget a grosse and melancholicke bloud. And for these causes
are not conuenient but for such as labour and lead a very toilesome life, in whose bodies
they being once concocted and digested, do nourish very much, and make them
more strong and lustie to go about and finish their worke, and therewithall corroborate
their stomacke.
                     Of white French wines, those are most accounted of, which are cleere and bright
as rocke water, of a subtile substance, neither sweet nor greene: such do nourish the
bodie a great deale lesse than the yellow and claret wines; but in recompence thereof,
they are more easily concocted, digested, distributed, and carried more speedily
and readily through all the veines. True it is, that they are accompanied with this
inconuenience, namely, that they do more assault the head, (and therefore are to bee
accounted greater enemies vnto gourie persons, such as haue weake braines, and are
subiect to rheumes and diseases of the ionts, and such likewise as haue weake ioinus)
than the red which are not yet come to their liuelyhood and maturitie, which strengthen
and corroborate the mo
                           •
                        th of the stomacke, by reason of some easie astringencie
that is in them. Such as in the first moneths become somewhat sweet, if they bee
kept any time, in the end grow so concocted and rip
                           •
                        , that hauing le
                           •
                        t their sweetnes,
they proue strong, mightie, and most excellent wines.
                     Greene wines whether they be white or red, (such as we oftentimes see in these
countries, especially in cold and moist yeares) if they containe any strong heate, as
it were buried in their crud and raw parts, if they be kept any time, are woont to concoct
themselues, and attaine to such a degree of ripenesse, as that they are 
                           •
                        ound
good, well contenting the taste, and pleasant vpon the tongue: such as those are
which are not simply greene, but together with their greenenesse doe taste somewhat
rough and sower: the other become spent, faded, &amp; decayed in the beginning
of Sommer, by reason of the said euaporating and wast of their weak &amp; feeble hea
                           •
                        e.

Wherefore you must drinke such vvines as are greenish and waterie, not hauing any
sharpenesse or sowrenesse in them, in the beginning of Summer, that so you may be
sure, that the great Summer heat shall not cause them to fade vtterly, and quite fall away,
by the spending of their feeble heat, caused through the vehemencie of the
Summer heat: but those which are greene, rough, and harsh, hauing a strong heat
couched and lying in grosse and thicke matter, may be kept very securely vnto Autumne
or Haruest time. Such as are onely and simply greene, are good and fit for seruants
drinke, and other such folke as liue hardly and in great labour, as also for all
such as feele a fire and extreame heat in the liuer and other inward parts: for such
vvines in idle and delicate persons, as also all such as are of a cold temperature, or are
growne into old age, doe not onely not become well concocted and digested, but
withall engender a masse of many crudities, and much flatuousnesse, become slowly
distributed, procure many obstructions, offend the stomacke, entrailes, and matrix:
notwithstanding, they sometimes appease the paines of the reines, and become soueraigne
for the weake head. And thus much in generall, and summarily, of the nature,
temperature, qualities, and differences of French vvines. For the diuersitie
which is found in them, by reason of seuerall Soiles, Townes, Villages, and great or
small Boroughs, where they grow, doth in such sort alter and change yerely, through
the variablenesse of the constitutions of the yeares, as that it would be hard, yea impossible,
to lay them downe in a certaine and assured description. Notwithstanding,
the most excellent of and ouer all the rest, are the French vvines of Cous
                           •
                        ye, appointed
and ordinarily taken for the Kings vse. Then those of Seure, both of them being
red or claret, noble, strong, and mightie vvines, most proper and sit for such as are altogether
cast downe, and in whom nature is (as it were) wholly spent, falling thereby
into many faintings and swounes, whether they be fallen hereinto by excessiue and insatiable
vse of vvomen, or through any other notable and immoderate euacuation.
The vvines of Vanues, Argentoile, and Montmatre, and all other vvines which grow
in grauelly or sandie grounds about Paris, are the more healthfull. For all these wines,
in as much as they are of a thinne and subtill substance, without all greene or manifest
harsh tast (especially in hot and well tempered yeares) keeping their proper and naturall
temperature, are easily concocted and digested, and speedily and quickly
distributed through the veines: and vvhich yet notwithstanding doe not much pester
the head, and that because they are not very strong, and therefore doe not heat
much.
                     The vvines of Burgundie, which are sent vs from Sens, Auxerres, Tonnerre, Ioigny,
and Chablie, are generally all of them red: manie of them, yea the greatest part
of them, are in their first moneths astringent and somewhat rough, and thereby doe
make more solide, bind, comfort, and corroborate a lanke and loose stomacke, and
so they nothing annoy the braine by any great store of vapours or fumes carried
vp from them: by which reason they proue the most wholesome and conuenient of
all other for such as haue the gout, and are subiect to haue the distillations of the head
falling vpon the inferiour parts. Notwithstanding if you drinke them before they
be come to their full and perfect ripenesse, you shall well perceiue them somewhat
the harder to be digested, and to bee more slowly distributed than the French claret
wines are.
                     Wherefore I would aduise men, not to vse them in the beginning of the yeare,
but rather in the latter end, if so be they be subiect to the obstructions of the liuer,
spleene, and Mesenterium, or such as li
                           •
                        e idly, or yet such as are dilicately giuen, and
haue but little naturall heate within them, as forsooth being the time wherein they
abound with much harshnesse and astringencie: which yet may euen then bee verie
well vsed of them which are accustomed to trauell, and haue a strong and
good stomake. Likewise if you let them ripen and loose by little and little their
astringencie and harshnesse, you shall find them as good and pleasant as the French
wines. This is the cause why good housholders do lay them in cellars, &amp; reserue them
diligently to the end of the first yeare, or to the beginning of the second to send them

in
                           •
                        o forreine countries by sea: which being so transported proue better and more
excellent than they did in France, or whiles they lay couched vpon their cantling,
as men call it, because the carrying and transporting of them, increaseth
their naturall heate, as wee haue before declared, and causeth it by such motion
to growe more ripe and concocted. Notwithstanding, very many of these Burgundian
wines in hot and d

yeare.
                     Amongst the Burgundian wines, those of Beaune are most highly commended,
for they are so good as that I dare bee bold to prefer them before the wines of Orleance
and Ay, which are so much esteemed of in Paris, because they are of a subtile
substance, of the colour of a partridges eie, not giuen to

the wines of the Kings yard at Coussy, whose plants when they were young, were
otherwise brought from Greece, in such sort, as that the wines of Coussy and Beaune
come very neere vnto the goodnesse and perfection of the Greekish wines. Some
also do compare the wines of Beaune to the wines that grow in the yard of the King
of Nauarre,Wines of Prepaton. which is some

name was giuen it because the plants therein were chosen and taken out of the best in
all places. The wine is a claret, of the colour of a partridges eie, of a thin substance,
not fuming or being vaporous, of a pleasant tast, and delicat to drinke, if there be any
wine in the world so qualified. All these three sorts of wine, of Coussy, Beaune, and
Prepaton, are the most excellent that are to be

Kings, Princes, and great Lords, being yet therewithall such wines as the Greekes
call Oligophora, and will not admit the mixture of much water. The wines of Isancy
are of a middle consistence and red of colour: when they are come to their ripenes,
they proue strong and noble wines, in so much as that you may iustly compare them
in goodnesse with the wines of Nera
                           •
                        , notwithstanding they be so highly esteemed
of, and had in request for great personages.
                     The wines of Orleance are set in the first ranke and chiefe place for goodnesse and
per
                           •
                        ection, amongst all the wines of France: Such are red, for the most part, of a
middle consistence betwixt thicke and thinne, of a good tast, strong, and profitable
for the stomach and inward parts. They heate more without comparison, and more
nourish the bodie than any French wines, as few excepted, as the wines of Coussy,
and Seure. But in the meane time they fill the head and hurt the braine, more than
any other, if you continue the vse of them any long time, especially in such as haue
a weake braine, and are subiect to cause many distillations, as also in those which

are subiect to inflammations of the lungs, and disposed by their bodily constitution
to fall into pleurisies: yea, these vvines are worse than any other for gowtie folke, as
also for such as are troubled with agues, and others, which haue their principall and
inward parts of a hot and drie constitution, and to them that are troubled with the
diseases of the skinne, as the itch, leprosie, benummednesse, tettars, wild fire, scabs, and
others such like. But on the contrarie, they are most apt for, and best agreeing, with
natures and diseases that are cold, and mooued of cold causes, in swounes and faintnesse
comming of aboundant and excessiue euacuation, by too much vse of vvomen,
vvatching, or other such like causes, and in like manner, of them which languish vpon
cold and long diseases. And thus much of that which wee can iudge to be in the
vvines of Orleance.

the earth doth naturally engender diuers qualities and faculties in wine. For amongst
others, such as are yellowish, claret, and bright cleare, are accounted the excellentest
and best of all: such are they which grow and are gathered neere vnto Orleance, in
the boroughes of Sainctay,Wines of Sainctay, S. Hillaries Chappel, S. Mesmain, and S. de Bouc. S. Hillaries Chappell, S. Mesmain the long, of the Loyre,
or at Checy. Those which grow at the village of S. de Bouc, are (in good sooth) all
of them right noble and excellent vvines, but somewhat of a more gros

consistence, vvhich is the cause that they come not to their best till about Easter.
The weakest and feeblest are those of Liuet, S. Gy, and Nigray, vvhich yet are
more healthfull for such as liue idly, and follow their studie, than the vvines vvhich
are stronger. At Paris wee account for very precious those vvhich are brought vs
from Messay,Wines of Messay, of Orleance. vvhich although they be farre behind in goodnesse and perfection
vnto the best vvines of Orleance, because they are of a thicke consistence, and cost
not much: notwithstanding, seeing that by transportation and carriage they become
thinner and more ripe, they are the better accounted of, of the Marchants.
                     Such as grow neere the Abbey of Neighbours,Orleance wines of the grounds of the Abbey of Neighbours. are cousin germans and much alike
to the vvines of Messay.
                     The vvhite vvines of Orleance doe surrender and partly giue ouer the praise vnto
French vvhite vvines,White wines of Orleance. vvhich is the cause that they are transported but as little as may
be out of the Countrey.
                     The vvines of Lourye, which doe tast somewhat sweet, are accounted the chiefe
of all the rest in that place, as likewise those of Rebechi. The vvines of Aniou, such
of them as are good, are (in a manner) all of them white and sweet, and for the most
part temperate, or hot and drie (when the temperature of the yeare falleth out hot
and drie) strong, noble, and mightie; in such sort, as that amongst all French vvines
they keepe the first place for goodnesse. All the while they are sweet, thick, and vnconcocted,
they swell the stomacke and the 
                           •
                        lankes, stoppe the veines, swell the noble
parts, and prouoke thirst, especially in cholericke natures: and sometimes also
they loosen the belly. But when as, through their working and boyling vp, they
haue cast out all their drosse and dregges, and that they are become sufficiently ripe,
concocted, and digested, that is to say, in their middle age (vvhich they attaine vnto
the second yeare) as then they become faire, bright, and cleare, as also very pleasant:
so, hauing lost their ill qualities, mentioned before, they get such qualities, powers,
and vertues, as are altogether contrarie vnto those which they had, at such time as
they were sweet, and of a grosse consistence: for they become easily concocted,
quickly piercing, sufficiently prouoking vrine, and causing to spit aboundantly.
When the yeare falleth cold and rainie, the most part of the vvines of Aniou become
raw and greenish, as by experience wee plainely saw in the yeares 1576.
and 1577.
                     When the yeare is hot and drie, the wines growing in Aniou are strong and mightie,
and keepe their vertues and qualities entire and whole till they be sixe or seuen
yeares old. But when the yeare falleth out cold and moist, they proue to be of cleane
contrarie qualities.
                     The vvines of high NormandieWines of high Normandie. (I meane not those which are gathered and beaten

downe with poles) doe somewhat resemble the French vvines, vvhen the yeares fall
seasonable, and keepe their naturall temperature: such, for the most part, are of a yellow
colour: but not continuing so any long time, they by and by loose their force:
which is the cause, that they are easily digested, and quickly distributed and carried
along all the veines, vvithout annoying the braine any whit, in as much as they be
not strong, or mightie, but oligophorous. But when the yeares fall out cold and
moist, the greatest part of them will not keepe well, because they be greene, and that
in such sort, as that their greenenesse cannot be concocted and digested by reason of
the weakenesse of their heat, and therefore it behoueth to drinke them in the beginning
of the first yeare.Wines of Compeigne. The vvines which grow in Compiegne, and other parts of
Picardie, are of the same consistence, qualitie, and vertue that those of Normandie
are, and therefore deserue not to be much set by, or desired, but when others are
wasting.

vaporous, neither yet assaile the head so mightily, as I haue proued that the vvines of
Orleance doe.

honey, as we see vvine Hydromell to be prepared) and Corsick vvines, so much vsed
of the Romanes, are very pernicious vnto vs, if we vse them as our common drinke.

from farre Countries, may seeme pleasant vnto our taste, yet indeede the truth is,
that we are not to vse them, except it be with as great aduise and iudgement as may
be, because that besides their manifest outward qualities, they haue also close and
hidden ones, vvhich indeed may become familiar and well agreeing, through some▪
sympathie, vvith the inhabitants of those Countries vvhere the said vvines grow:

not, we cannot but for the most part offend against the rules of art, and commit

infinite faults in prescribing and laying downe such diet, and order of gouernment,

                     Some do make and compound spiced wines which somewhat resemble the foresaid
forraine wines, and that not so much for the necessitie of life or health, as for pleasure,
and the deligthing of the swallow: of which sort are the claret, the preparing
whereof we haue set downe before, and hipocras, so called, not that Hipocrates did
euer inuent it or vse it, but (of the mixture and temperature according whereunto the
said wine is compounded and made) it is so called of the Greeke verbe 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        ,
which signifieth to temper. Men ought seldome to temper these wines, because that
by their vnwoonted heate and great vaporousnesse, they procure many troublesome
diseases, as the squinancie, strangurie, apoplexie, pallie, and other such like: notwithstanding
such as feele a certaine coldenesse and weakenes in their stomake, may
vse them, not as their common drinke, but sometimes only as remedie or medicine.
                     And thus in briefe you haue what I thought good to deliuer concerning the qualities
and vertues aswell of such wines as grow in France, as also of them which are
brought vs from strange countries. By the reading of this slight discourse, the Reader
which is carefull of his health, may learne to make choice of such wine as is fittest
for his owne drinking, as he shall perceiue to be agreeable and profitable, not onely
for his nature and disposition, but also for his health. As for example, he that hath a
very hot and drie liuer, his lungs subiect to inflammation, and readie to receiue sharp
distillations from the braine, and his braine very moist, shall not vse hot and drie
wines, such as are those of Languedoc, Gascoignie, and Orleance: but he shall content
himselfe with some small French wine, somewhat greenish, and which beareth
but small store of water. He likewise which hath a cold stomake, and is
subiect to cold and windie diseases, shall vse the wine that is good,
and haue nothing to doe with the small and greene wines,
and for this purpose shall make his aduantage of this
our discourse, which will instruct and teach
him the diuersitie and qualities
of wines.

            THE SEVENTH BOOKE
OF THE COVNTRIE
FARME.
            
               The Warren.
               
                  CHAP. I.
                  Of the situation of the Warren.
                  
                     HItherto we haue as briefely as possibly we could run through
whatsoeuer thing belonging to the tilling and dressing of
the earth, as gardens, meadowes, arable grounds and vines:
now it is requisite, that following the order before propounded,
we speake of the Warren, of wood, timber trees,
parks for wild beasts, breeding of herons, and of hunting.
                  We will begin therefore to describe the Warren,The profit of the Warren. the
profit whereof is not inferiour to that of the pullaine, pigeons,
and other small cattell, which are bred and fed
about our countrie farme, but chiefely in respect of the selling of conies, which the
good housholder may doe yearely, and that some yeares betwixt foure score a hundred
dosen, beside all those which the Lord of the farme shall stand in neede dayly
to vse, either for eating in his house, or for to giue away and gratifie his friends withall.
Againe the indeauour, care, and paine about a Warren is nothing so great, as
that which is required in the ordering of other small cattell; for conies stand not in
to haue a speciall and set gouernour, to take care continually of house, handle, make
cleane, heale them when they are sicke, or to dresse them their meate, because that of
of themselues they build earthes and little holes to hide and repose themselues in:
and feeding, they looke not for any thing but that which the earth of its own accord,
without any tilling doth beare and bring forth for them.
                  Wherefore for the most profit of your countrie farme, you must prouide and prepare
a Warren in such a place, as hath before beene spoken of, that is to say, betwixt
your corne fields, vineyards, and grounds bearing timber trees, if peraduenture you
haue not the b
                        •
                     nefit of some vnder wood neere vnto your house, where the conies
may settle themselues and make their abode. Notwithstanding in as much as the hunting
and taking of conies, which haue their couer
                        •
                     s and boroughs in such vnder
woods, is some what more hard and difficult than that of the Warren: and because
also that conies liuing in smal woods multiplie nothing so much as those in the Warren,
and that especially by reason of foxes, woolues, and other field beastes, whereunto
they are oftentimes made a pray by being deuoured of them: it will bee better,
and for your further both ease and profit, to make a Warren apart by it selfe.
                  
                     
You must then for the making thereof, reserue some fiue or sixe acres of fine dusti

                     ,
or sandie ground, such as is not fat, strong or close, in a high place lying open
vpon the Sunne, and not in a

                     arish or waterie ground: for together with that, the

                     onie hateth aboue all things, moisture and cold; yet for the conueniencie of her making
of here earthes, it is requisite that she be in a place, where she may dig with ease
for the making of her bed and couert. This peece of ground shall be compassed and
be set about after the manner of a parke, with reasonable high walls to keepe out fox

woolues, and other wild beasts, that they may not iniurie or make war vpon this
little beast. Within this conigrie, you must plant great store of brambles, mulberri

trees, and 
                        •
                     loe trees, strawberrie plants, wild pine trees, hurtle berrie bushes, goose

                        •
                     rtle trees, and great store of iuniper, for the conie loueth the iuniper
berrie aboue all other things. And as concerning hearbes, you must sow (if so be
the earth bring not forth someof itselfe) great 
                        •
                     tore of sowthistle, groundswell, succorie,

                     ease, and other such
like for the feeding of these little beastes. As for the drawing of some small brooke,
or bestowing of any water conduit vpon them, you need not trouble your selfe, seeing
the coni
                        •
                      hath moisture more than any thing else. Neither yet doe you trouble
your selfe to prepare them any other lodging, than the holes which they shall dig
and worke out for themselues.
                  And those burroughs or clappers which shall be meet for them to worke in, which
borrough would (if the nature of the ground doe not allow it) bee cast vp somewhat
high and s

                     ape wise, so as the water may by all means dessend, and passe from the
same without soaking into it, or drawing it vpon any fluxe of raine whatsoeuer: vpon
the tops of these burroughs or clappers, for the better strengthning of them, and
holding the loose mould together, you shall plant good store of alders and other
rough bushes which are quicke of groweth, whose roots once entring into the earth
and twinding about the mould, will keepe any from falling, more than that which
the conie of her owne selfe diggeth: and although out of the precisenesse of choice
we desire a speciall place for the conie Warren; yet you shall vnderstand that the

namely the most dryest heath or downes, or those earths which are ouer runne with
linge, gorse, whynnes, braken, broome, ferne, and such like, for a conie feedeth as a

grasse that may be, and also delighteth to crop vpon weeds or any other tender bud
that groweth within the compasle of her feeding: the snow is her greatest enemie,

                        •
                     et not so much for the want of food, as for the ouer moistning of 
                        •
                     er food, and so
bringing rottennesse: therefore it is meere to haue euery Winter in your Warren a
little cob or stacke of hay, wherewith in those extreame times you may fodder your
conies, pricking vp little 
                        〈◊〉
                      thereof in clouen stickes close by the ground, which
they will eate with all greedinesse, for it is a meat at those times which they loue exceedingly:
for proofe whereof doe but fodder sheepe neere vnto a connie Warren,
and you shall see how euening and morning the conies will swarme vnto the same,
eating vp whatsoeuer the sheepe shall leaue, which is not too hard or rough for their
eating.
               
               
                  CHAP. II.
                  That there must a Clapper be made for the better storing and planting
of your Warren.
                  
                     ANd yet it is not inough to haue made and finished the things that are to bee
done round about the Warren, as to haue fenced it, with whatsoeuer is necessarie
for the preseruing and nourishing of conies; but you must also
store and plant it: for no more than arable ground beareth fruit, except
there be seed cast into in: nor the vine any grapes, except it bee diligently planted

and dressed: so neither thinke you that your Warren, be it neuer so nea
                        •
                     ly and necessarily
appointed and trimmed vp, can breed and feed conies, except you first put
them there. Wherefore for your storing of your Warren, it is requisite that you
cast vp a clapper, wherein you may put your males and females to kindle euery moneth:
for to buy so many as should be needfull would be too costly and chargeable
for the farmer or housholder. Seeing also that it commeth to passe oftentimes, that
after hee hath sold many vnto the vitailers, or for that the foxes haue eaten vp some
great number, the Warren remaineth quite spoiled, and destitute of conies, in so
much as that he must be compelled to store it againe. It is better therefore, in respect
of the greater commoditie and lesse charges, to make a clapper in some corner of
your court, kitching, or garden, which may be foure square, narrow, and fenced in
with bords, or plaistered walls: indeed it were better to be prouided in the Warren,
for so the young ones might more commodiously out of the clapper passe into the
Warren at some one side of the clapper, which should bee crosse wrought with lattise
worke, and should haue the holes thereof left so wide, as that the young ones
might passe out and in vnto their dams.
                  Whether therefore the clapper be prouided in the Warren, or elsewhere, you must
build certaine small lodgings paued with boords, and these must haue holes in them
like to those which the conies make themselues in the earth, and euery one seuerall
from another, for the conies to betake themselues into: and it will be enough for to
allow in such places one male to eight or ten females; and yet therewithall to keepe
the bucke close shut vp in his lodging, for feare he should hurt and wrong the young
ones, for the male conie (contrarie to the nature of all other manner of buckes) deuoureth
the young ones. It is very true, that so soone as it is espied, that the Doe hath
kindled, she must incontinently be put into some other hole with the male, that so
he may Bucke her: for this is a most certain thing, that so soone as the Doe is emptie
and deliuered of her young ones, euen so soone she is full againe of young, in such
sort, as that she bringeth forth young euery moneth in the yeare: yea, and being
great with young, she letteth not to take the Bucke, and to continue a second burden,
which she bringeth forth afterward in due time. So as that this fruitfulnesse in conies
hath become so admirable vnto many, as that some haue vpon too slender grounds
thought and beleeued that the Bucke shoold conceiue aud become great with young
aswell as the Doe, which is very false and altogether contrarie to all naturall course
in the action of generation, seeing that by natures course, it is ordained that the female
only amongst beasts should conceiue and ing
                        •
                     nder, and not the male.
                  After that the young ones are growne somewhat great, and become able to leaue
their dams, you shall carrie them into the Warren for to store it therewith, and so let
them grow wild: otherwise if you keepe them shut vp, and fast inclosed in the clapper
with their dams, they will become tame, and alwaies continue as it were slumbring
and heauie, like vnto those which are continually shut vp in clappers made for
the purpose; and so will haue a grosser and more vnpleasant flesh.
                  And yet notwithstanding, you must beware not to put abroad into your Warren,
the old clapper conies, either males or females: for seeing they haue not had their
free swing to run abroad as those of the Warren, and haue not learned to saue themselues
from dangers and violences offred them by foxes and other such wild beasts,
they would bee by and by deuoured; so that thereupon it seemes better to containe
and continue them still in their accustomed clapper.
                  Conies in the clapper are to be sed with col
                        •
                     worts, lettuses, groundsell, clarie, succorie,
sowthistle, 
                        •
                     arragon, thistles, cich pease, oats, barely and bran mingled together,
and other such like things, as we haue spoken of heretofore. In some countries they
feed them with mans bloud, such as is to be come by when sicke persons are let bloud:
but such manner of feeding of them is starke naught, and maketh their flesh vnsauorie
in eating, and very preiudiciall vnto health.
                  And surely to speake the truth there is no food that a man can bind a conie to 
                        〈◊〉
                     
which is wholesome for them, because they are beasts which aboue all other desire

freedome of feeding, and to make choice of their owne meat. Whence it comes, that
the tame conie is nothing so pleasant to eat as the wild, but is of a much ranker taste,
and most easie to be discerned.
               
               
                  CHAP. III.
                  How the Conies in a Warren ought to be handled
and ordered.
                  
                     ALthough the hauing of a clapper be very necessarie for the storing of a warren,
againe and againe (as we haue said before) notwithstanding, for need,
one may leaue off all vse of the clapper, and so, without any further charge
or expences, content himselfe with putting a certaine number of conies,
both males and females, into his warren, of them to haue sufficient store by encrease
of young ones. True it is, that they are not so fruitfull, nor of such plentifull encrease,
and therefore the warren will not be so soone stored by them: for they being accustomed
to the warren, become more sauage and strange, but lesse giuen to engender: and
thereupon it commeth, that the Does of the warren bring forth young ones onely
thrice or foure times a yeare, and those that are kept in house-clappers, once euerie
moneth: But howsoeuer it be, if you find it more for your profit to furnish your warren
with store after this later manner, it will be sufficient, for six dozen of Does, to put
in nine Bucks, hauing more regard and consideration still vnto the Does than to the
Bucks, to spare them, if at any time you would take any.
                  Their feeding shall be no otherwise than hath alreadie beene mentioned: and yet
notwithstanding, besides that manner of feeding, if you would haue great store of
conies in your vvarren, and that they should be to sufficiently fed, as that they should
become fat, it will be good to sowe an acre of ground, or two, with Barly or Oats, not
for to make any further haruest of them, than that which they shall leaue vneaten. You
must haue a speciall care, that they feed vpon good nourishment, because their flesh
(in like manner as the flesh of Partridges) doth retaine the smell and sauour of that
whereupon they feed: as for example, of Iuniper, if their vvaren be full of Iuniper,
and so semblably of other things.
                  If you see any conie-hole stopt with hay, or straw, or such other like thing, doe not
vnstop it, but content your selfe onely to obserue it, and to gesse that there are young
ones vvithin, vvhich the dam nourisheth: for this is the manner of the Doe, that from
the time that she hath kindled, vvhether it be in a house, clapper, or in a vvarren, shee
shutteth &amp; stoppeth vp her hole with hay, straw, or some other grasse, such as shee can
gather together, and to no other end, but that the Bucke may not find her yong ones,
or goe into her hole, vvhere if hee should once come, hee would eat vp all her young
ones: this thing being assuredly and vndoubtedly conceiued of the Doe, whether she
be in her hole, or else goe forth to feed, she stoppeth her earth: and if so be that at her
returne she find the mouth of her hole neuer so little vnstopt, she her selfe will by and
by kill her young ones, hauing taken opinion, that the Bucke is gone in thither. And
this is the cause why good hunters will neuer put their ferret into any earth, vvhose
mouth they see stopt, for feare of disquieting the dam, and causing of her to kill her
young ones. True it is, that shee doth not keepe her hole euermore shut: for at such
time as shee knoweth her young ones to be growne great, and become strong ynough
to seeke their meat, and to runne with others, shee beginneth to make a little hole for
them to issue and goe out at.
                  Furthermore, you must not thinke, that conies, either males or females, doe at any
time forget their earth, be it neuer so farre off: for howsoeuer some say, that comes
haue no memorie, notwithstanding they are alwaies mindfull of their hole, be they
strayed or wandered neuer so farre from the same. And this is the reason likewise

why some say that a good conie will neuer die out of her earth.A good conie dieth alwaies in her earth. You must likewise
coniecture, that the conie is taught by nature to be afraid of the fox, as the sheepe of
the woolfe, which is another case besides his wild and strange nature, why, when he
goeth out of his hole, his mind runneth vpon nothing but running, thereby forgetting
to thinke vpon other conies holes, and so of the Does, and of the eating of her
young ones: for although he bee mindfull of his owne earth, yet hee taketh no care,
neither casteth any whit about, how he may find out of fall vpon that which belongeth
to another: likewise the Doe to take from him all occasion of any whi
                        •
                      regarding
hers: is woont to stop the mouth thereof as hath beene said.
                  Furthermore, you must bee carefull round about the verdge of your conie
Warren in the most secret and obscure places, and where you shall find the
greatest suspition of the trackt of vermine, to place trappes and ginnes which
may take and deuoure them, nei
                        •
                     her shall your trappes bee made all of one fashion,
but of diuers fashions, as some of them must bee hollow and passable both
waies, the which are called coffer trappes or hutches: some frall-traps, which are
to crush and kill sodainely: some spring-trappes, to snickle or halter either bird or
beast, as also pit-falls, and other ginnes: all which the Warrenner shall diligently
and carefully looke vnto, and baite with the liuers of conies, or some other such
beastes: and in the highest part of the Warren, the Warrenner shall place a paire

                  What is to be considered before a man go about to plant wood.
                  
                     TO order and cause a new wood to be planted, you must know the ground
wherein you would plant any thing, as whether it be fat or leane, whether
it be of a reasonable depth of earth or no: and likewise if it bee
subiect to waters; because that some trees by nature lo

the allerThe aller. an dothers of the same nature: and according to the nature and propertie of
the ground, you must applie your selfe to fit it with such, as it may nourish most, both
for your profit and pleasure.
                  You must see and set downe first and before all other things, that the ground bee
of such goodnesse as is requisite: and you must likewise vnderstand that two of the
noblest trees and esteemed worth most siluer, are the oakeThe oake. and the chesnut tree,The chesnut tree. and
that for two principall reasons: the one because they beare such fruits as whereof
mixed with a little barley or oates, one may make bread in the time of famine:
the other, because it is not in the nature of any tree to afford so good timber as the
said two, the oake and chesnut tree do, being either of them considered in its proper
qualitie.
                  The third excellent sort of trees is the elme:The elme. and notwithstanding it be inferiour
to the other, because it beareth no fruit,E

worth the hauing, euen for that it may be headded after the manner of willowes, and
cut euerie foure yeares to make props and fagots: but the chesnut treeChesnut trees. is a great
deale better, more neate and fine, and bearing more fruit than other trees which
are of its nature: neither doth it stand in need of so good and fat a gr

fall vpon it, as they doe vpon the oake and elme. And further when the locusts
come, which is euerie three yeares,Locusts euery three yeares. as I my selfe haue seene, they eate not the leaues
of the chesnut trees, because they find leaues vpon the oakes: for the yeare of the locusts
doth hinder some wood more than of a yeares growth, whereas besides that
priuiledge, the chesnut tree doth ordinarily grow more in one yere than the oke doth
in two.
                  Yet is the oake accounted the King of the forrest, both in respect of his largenesse
and hudgenesse, as also for his hardnesse and long indurance; for of all timbers
not any is i

                      so long lasting, or fit for building either vpon the land or water,
as oake is: it is also the most principall timber that may bee either for boordes,
plankes, wainscot, or any other

                     eeling whatsoeuer, and of all manner of oakes,
those are preserued and kept as the best and principall which grow vpon the clay

                     oundest, and most durable timber: those
oakes which grow vpon the sandie grounds being much more brickle, falser hearted,
and much lesse able to endure the violence of the weather, or the continuall beati

of the wet, when it must necessarily fall vpon the same: whence it comes that
the Ship-wright or the Mill-wright euer make choice of the strong clay oake, and
the Ioyner of the sand oake, which though it bee lesse durable, yet it is fairest and
whitest to looke on. The elme besides the benefit of his head (which is commonly
for the fire) is a most excellent timber for the ground worke of any thing, or to be
lodged in the ground for any necessarie purpose, especially to make pipes for the
conueyance of water; for it is a wood of that infinit toughnesse, that if it lie close

and well hid in the earth, it seldome or neuer consumeth in the same: it is also rarely
good to make bow-staues withall, and excepting the yew is the principall best
for that purpose: it is no lesse good to make axel-trees either for Wagons, Carts, or
Waines, being neither so brickle, nor apt to heate and breake as the ash is: the young
plants are good to make beeles for yoakes, by which oxen draw either in waines or
ploughes: and lastly, is an excellent tree to plant in alleyes or walkes, or about houses
for shade, bearing a large head like the Cicamore, and fully as round, and as
much extended: and the leafe naturally of it selfe being broad, and growing so
thicke, that hardly neither the Sunne nor the raine can possibly passe through
the same, neither is it tender but very apt to grow, and may be remoued at any time
or age, as long as it is portable and meete to be wi

                     lded by the strength of any one
man.
                  It is very true, that the elme groweth easily and plentifully, after that it hath taken
with the ground. And who so would for varietie sake mingle diuers sorts of trees of
diuers natures, as maple, beech, aspe, and such other kinds of wood, may do it, but the
moe okes and chesnut trees a man groweth, the better he doth.
               
               
                  CHAP. VI.
                  Of the seating and disposing of a wood for growing of high
and great timber trees.
                  
                     WHo soeuer hath a faire plot of eight or ten acres of ground, and would
make it shew faire and beautifull the first yeare, and that by bringing
the wood into some shape and commendable forme, with hope of further
delight &amp; pleasure from the same in time to come, must for the first
yere wall it about or else ditch it so well, and plant it with hedges of quickset, as that
no cattell may possibly be able to enter thereinto. And if the said plot should come to
be ditched, then I am freely contented to vtter my opinion at some other time, concerning
the fashion that they are to bee made after, as also how, when they are made
they must be planted or set with quickset.
                  But presuppose that the said square plot is inclosed with a wall, and that the said
square hath foure sides, that is to say, two of length and two of bredth, mine aduise is
that all the sides of the said wal should be couered and clothed with greenenesse, and
with foure sorts of trees, and six foot thicke and large, seeing that nature reioiceth in
varietie, that so both the walls may be kept from being seene, and there may be a walk
betwixt two greenes.
                  The said couerts shall bee made according to the good liking of the Lord, as
for example, one of the sides if it should so seeme good vnto him, euen the South
side with hasell and white hawthorne, because these are the first leaues that doe first
put forth in the spring time, as those also wherin the nightingale doth make her neast:
another of the sides with barberrie trees, which are beautifull and serue for very many
vses, spreading themselues in comely sort, when they meet with a good ground:
The third side being that whereupon the Sunne beateth at his rising, with 
                        •
                     ame osiers,
which may serue in husbandrie, and therewithall also make a faire shew: and
the fourth side with yong peare-tree plants, with some white thorne plants amongst,
as at the end of euerie foure foote square, which are more greene than any other
sorts of trees, and they will bee of vse for to graft many faire grafts vpon, and good
store of great medlars.
                  The alleyesAlleyes. about the said wood must be twelue foot broad, and vpon the edges of
all the said alleyes, as well on those that are toward the wall, as on the other, there
must be planted elmes euery one foure fadome from another, hauing their heads cut
off, and their bodies remaining a seuen foote high or thereabout, to giue some

grace and comlinesse vnto the said alleyes: because that if a man should walke in the
fairest place in the world, if there be no sweetnesse to be found in it, it proueth tedious
and irkesome. For this cause, if it please the Lord of the farme to plant along the
said alleyes certaine fruit trees,Fruit-trees▪
                      as also wallnut-trees, and those such as may sute euery
season of the yeare, he may do it.
                  Further, it may seeme that all the said trees should be set from foure feet to foure
feet, and that by the leuell of a line euery way, aswell to please the sight of the eie, as
also for that sometimes men are desirous to make alleyes within the wood, and then if
the draughts be straight, it is more easie for to make them.
               
               
                  CHAP. VII.
                  Of the manner of planting trees in woods of high and tall growth.
                  
                     IF you purpose to plant these trees well, you must presently make dithes
in manner of furrowes, as you are woont to doe in the planting of vines,
wherein they must be planted, to the end the earth may feed it selfe in
aire, and that it may battle and grow fat, with the raine and snow which
shall fall during Winter vpon them vnto the end of December, or vnto the beginning
of Ianuarie.
                  These trenches are not to be made aboue two foot deepe; but they must be well
handled in the bottome, and that by laying the good earth vpon one side of the furrow,
and that which is lesse worth vpon the other, and not to cast it abroad, to the end
that if the bottome should proue bad ground, or otherwise to bee ouer deepe, then
there might be cast into the said furrow or trench some of that good earth which shal
be on the side, to the end that the roots of the tree may not busie themselues in searching
a bad bottome, in steed of stretching forth themselues, in largenesse, and you
must so leaue the trenches and furrowes all Winter long, for the receiuing of the rain
water when it commeth: and they must be so wide, as that one may turne a yard euery
way round within.
                  The said trees must be planted in December, if it be possible, and that the times be
fauorable,The time to plant trees. as when it freezeth not: for great frosts are great enemies to the good proceeding
of this worke.
                  You should rather cast to plant trees that are alreadie growne vp, than to deale
with the sowing of acornes or chesnuts, because it requireth great care and industrie
to make the said seed to grow: and as concerning the seed it selfe, that of the chesnut
groweth sooner than that of the acorne. And whenas you go about to sow them, it
must be done with leauing a foot distance betwixt one and another with the largest,
and in the end of great frosts: because that during the said frosts, the mowles do eate
the chesnuts in the ground.
                  As concerning the planting of trees alreadie growne, they must be taken vp with
as many roots as they can possibly, and after they be taken vp, if there by any of their
roots broken, to cut the same: and those which are not broken, to cut their ends for
to refresh them, the length of three or foure fingers, more or lesse, as the roots may
beare it. You must make choice of a young plant, that hath a liuely and cleane barke,
not rough and ouergrowne with mosse, a good and handsome root, a straight shanke,
and long without scares or frets: and before you plant it, it will bee good to cast into
the furrow some good earth, taken from the side of the same trench, to the thicknesse
of a finger or two, and vpon that, to set the tree which you are to plant, then couering
the rootes with earth, to sway vpon them gently with your hands, that so there may
not any aire stay about them, and in filling vp the said furrowes, you must prouide
that they haue some sloping of earth, both on the one side and on the other, in maner
of a gutter, to the end that if it raine, the raine and moisture may run away the more
easily.
                  
                     
And to the end that the planted trees may grow the better, you must lay their
longest roots all along the trench, on the one side, and on the other: and if by hap it
fall out that there be long ones on euerie side; so as that they cannot easily bee laied
along in the furrow, you must inlarge the furrow a little in the place where such roots
require it to be enlarged, to the end that the said roots may not touch the firme and
fast earth, but may bee buried and wrapt in soft earth that hath beene moued and
stirred.
                  You must likewise cut off by the top of the shanke all the trees which you
plant, that is to say, such as you plant to make high and tall tymber trees, or
which you mind to set along by the sides of the alleyes, till you haue not left aboue
the length of fiue or sixe foote to stand out of the earth, to the end that
they may the sooner beare a great quantitie of woode: but the trees which you
are purposed to plant for lowe and small wood, must bee cut, that there bee not
left aboue a foote and a halfe, for it will bee sufficient if they haue the length of
foure inches out of the ground: neither is there any danger in mingling chesnut trees
with oakes, except a man bee purposed to plant one wood with oakes onely,
and another with chesnut trees: and as concerning the thickenesse of the said
trees, it needeth no deepe aduice, for they may bee either of the thickenesse of a
chesnut, tennise-ball, or some other such like: but rather the care is, that they bee well
and newly taken vp, and planted the same day they bee taken vp, or at the farthest
the day following.
                  Neither is it doubtfull, but if they bee of much larger and bigger compasse, as
seuen or eight foot in length, (aboue the ground) and twentie inches in compasse:
yet they will grow as well and as fast as the younger, especially, the 
                        •
                     lme aboue all
other trees: nor would I wish you, if you can get them, to chuse plants of any lesse
bignesse. And howbeit that some Woodwards are of opinion, that the ash would
bee planted but of a meane length, because say they, looke how m
                        •
                     ch it is aboue
the earth, so much it will shoot out in roote vnder the earth, before it begin to prosper
aboue: yet it is but a false coniecture, and if you intend to haue a faire and a
large tree, you must chuse the fairest and largest plants that you can get, and then
planting them in a conuenient and due time, and in a fit earth, they will in one Winter
recouer that roote which shall preserue them from perishing euer after: againe
you must remember that as soone as you haue fixed your plants in the earth, and couered
them wel &amp; close, which is a principal care, you must then forthwith couer the
top of the head all ouer, and at least halfe a foote downeward with clay and mosse
st
                        •
                     sly well tempered together, and if the clay be apt to chap or riue, then you shall
mingle a few ashes therewith, and so keepe it closse couered till the new branches
spred forth and couer the head all ouer, then when those branches are put out, and
are tender, you shall plash and order them at your pleasure, whether it be to make a
tree for timber, or for shade, for speciall marke, or for any other deuice whatsoeue.
                  The wood thus planted, must bee twice laboured and tilled, once in the end of
Aprill, and the second time at the end of Iulie, after the fall of some great raine vpon
thunder: and if the caterpiller shall fall vpon it within the yeare, it must bee clensed
and freed from them.

                  Of the time when wood is to be tilled and husbanded.
                  
                     IT is here to be noted that the chiefe &amp; principall furtherance and comfort
that can be giuen to trees, either reclaimed or wild, is the labour bestowed
vpon them in due &amp; conuenient time, for the more they are husbanded
&amp; tilled, so much the more do they grow and prosper in greatnesse:

as well small as great, and especially the foure first yeares, they must be husbanded
throughly, and plied with two seuerall dressings euery yeare as vines are, that is to
say, towards the middest of Aprill, when they begin to put forth their buds, and towards
the end of Iune, &amp; this must be done in moist &amp; rainie weather, and not when
drying winds or heat doth raigne, because the ground then stirred would do nothing
but turn to dust,Such dressing of the earth in d

                        y weather in not good. which would destroie the young springs, and cause them die: againe
the said earth dressed at such time doth more easily conueigh the drienesse of the drie
earth turned downe, vnto the rootes of the trees, which is very contrarie vnto them;
seeing that moisture is the thing that is required for the nourishment of plants: and
againe if the ground be moist, it ioineth it selfe close vnto the roots, and lendeth vnto
them of his moisture. The other reason is, for that the earth being newly opened, by
its lying open, giueth pas
                        •
                     age for the water, raine, or dew, to enter more easily vnto
the said roots.
                  The principall labour to be made about all trees, is to root out all weeds,To pull vp weedes by the roote. seeing
they are giuen to grow euery where in all grounds, and which, if they be suffered to
grow vp, sucke, purloine, and carrie away the sap and substance of the earth in such
sort, as that there is not left sufficient vertue and power to nourish the rootes of the
late planted trees well and in good order, and this is perceiued by the labour made in
dressing of the vine and gardens, the which the more they are husbanded and tilled,
so much the more fruite, and young springs they put forth, and become so
much the more beautifull and faire. So it will bee the chiefe worke after you haue
planted trees, to cause them to be so dressed in seasons that are moist, and that twice at
the least: and that will cause them to grow greater of wood, greater of boughes, and
to yeeld double profit.
                  And if extraordinarily the Sommer proue rainie, so as that your plants become
ouergrowne with much weeds, it shall be left to the discretion of the husbandman,
if he see that his plants be not cleane, to bestow a third dressingThe third dressing of trees. vpon them, to the
end that the weeds may not smother the bud, and deuour the substance of the earth:
for all plants come of heate and moisture;The growth of plants commeth by heate and moisture. and if they be suffered to bee intangled
with weeds, they will be smothered and in danger to be lost.

                  That wood diligently dressed and husbanded, doth profit more than that which
is not so dressed and husbanded.
                  
                     I Know that there are many trees which are dayly seene to grow without
such great paines taking and industrie, freely receiuing their naturall
nourishment without aide or assistance, and that by reason of the fruitfulnesse
either of the ground, or of the countrie; and yet if some one do
so escape, a hundred die for it: and this I say for their sakes, who hauing once planted
would be loath to loose their paines, and do conceaue that all or the greatest part doe
thriue and prosper: which conceat is notwithstanding like to deceiue them, if they
proceed not to dresse and husband them in conuenient sort, after they haue beene
well planted, as is aboue declared.
                  Wherfore I haue applied my selfe to trie the issue of tilling of them according to
art and knowledge,The experience of dressing trees and of letting of them go vndresse. as also of leauing them vntilled: and I find that although the
tree which groweth in the desert do grow vp sometimes vpon a perfect growth, notwithstanding
it groweth not in so short time, and the greatest part of it dieth: and
that which is well tilled and planted, doth grow twice so much, and that not one of
ten of them is lost, but that all prosper, of what sort of wild trees soeuer they by.
                  But some may replie, that labour is chargeable and costeth much, but in as much
as it lasteth not alwaies, being to continue not past foure or fiue yeares at the most,

much like vnto the young plant of a vine, it will be found that the cost will not bee
great, seeing especially that after such cost, it is freed from any more for euer. For after
that wood is once grown vp to such height, as that weeds cannot ouer grow nor ouercrow
it, (which will be in foure or fiue yeares if it be husbanded) then it smothereth
the weeds that grow vnder it, and keepeth away from them both the Sunne and the
aire with its shawdow, in such sort as that they die, and are not able to ouershadow or
do any hurt vnto the wood.

trees from a high, drie, and bad soile, into another ground that is more
moist and fat, if it may be: by this meanes, in finding a better soile, the
tree will take more easily: and there is no doubt, but the better the
ground is, and the better that the plant is ordered, the sooner it will grow, become
bigger, beare greater boughs and leaues rather than lesse, as may be seene in old forrests
which are situated in fertile and fat countries, or in those which grow in sandie
and bad grounds, as in Solonge,Wood of Solonge. where woods continue very small and vntimely.
                  Woods planted and ordered (as is abouesaid) the first, second, and third yeare,
must not bee touched with any edge toole: and yet notwithstanding towards the
third and fourth yeares and those that follow, if you perceiue your wood so thicke
set and spred, as that it riseth not, neither groweth high as it ought, you may cull out
and cut away the small sprigs and little boughes as you shall find them, seeing they
are good for nothing, and leaue behind you some three or foure of the principall
braunches so stripped of their small twigs as your owne discretion will best direct
you. This pruning of them would bee towards the moneth of March, after that the
cold is passed and gone, that so the frost may not hurt the boughes that are cut and
newly lopped, and you may continue thus to prune them vnto the middeh of April,
at what time they begin to bud and put forth, but then it must be done gently, holding
the shanke of the tree fast and firme without mouing or shaking of the rootes▪
And this pruning may be done euery yeare, if you will, and by this meanes, you may
cause a new spring of small woods to grow, and to put forth eight or ten branches, fit
for to bee plants for high and tall trees, by cutting away the side ones, and leauing
three or foure of the fairest branches growing from the foot of the said small wood,
so cut downe, according as you shall think good, so that you make choice of such as
grow vp high and straight: and if they be not altogether strong enough to hold vp
themselues, you may helpe them with some prettie small props and stickes, the better
to hold them vp.

                     ALl sorts of wild trees growWhereof wild trees 
                           〈◊〉
                         grow. of remoued plants, hauing good rootes, or of
branches, or of the seeds and fruits which they beare, and whereby they renew
themselues. Of the remoued plant, there hath alreadie enough beene
said, as that it is more profitable, and of a more speedie and certaine
growth: and therefore the sooner able to bestow pastime vpon his master.
                  
                     
The second way to grow trees, is to grow them of branches writhen and buried
in the earth, gathered in such sort as that they may put forth roots, and take againe,
as Columella hath very well set downe at large: notwithstanding, this way is long in
taking root, and putting forth; and not to be practised, but where there are no plants
to be come by. Wherefore I will not meddle with it in this place, because it is not
done without difficultie and vncertaintie, and for that the pleasure thereof is long bebefore
it is reaped: as also for that in this our countrie of France, there are many vnderwoods
and strong hedges, where are to be gathered very easily, and that in great
quantity, plants of all sorts of wild trees.
                  The third way is to sowe them of seed, as of acornes, beech maste, and of the
seed that is in the leaues of elmes, for they bring forth such trees as those whereupon
they themselues did grow: and such seeds may bee sowne in little furrowes made
with a hacke or grubbing axe, and those not aboue foure or fiue fingers deepe, and
therein to couer them againe very lightly with broken mould: or else they may bee
sowne with the plough, as beanes and all other kinds of graine are: or with a debbell,
by which name they call a little sticke of halfe a foot long, and a finger or inch
thicke. And of the three waies, the best is to plant or sow the acorne or other seed
with the dibble, euerie one halfe a foot from another, or one foot euery one from
another, by a straight line, or after the manner vsed in grounds broken vp with
the hacke, making a small open place in the earth, and therein putting the acorne
in the like distance of halfe a foot all along the furrowe: notwithstanding, it is
not needfull to plant them so neere euerie manner of way; for the earth would
not bee able to beare so much fruit as would growe, and so it must either be transplanted,
or else it would proue out of course like a misborne thing. Wherefore
you may leaue betwixt euery two furrows and plants, foure, fiue, or sixe foot distance
sidewaies: and againe, if all prosper not, the worst and most ill fauouredly growne
may be pulled vp.
                  And euen as small and great wood is to be dressed and husbanded, so also must
their seed be ordered, but not after the like sort: for the mattocke would pull vp the
seed, and therefore they must be vnderdigd very deftly, and the weeds weeded out
all along the furrowes where the seedes are set, to the end that the weeds do not smother
them, and that they doe not blinde them, taking away their aire, Sunne,
and substance of the earth, whereof euerie young seede and plant standeth greatly
in neede, as to bee holpen thereby to gather root and life, which is as yet in
them very young and tender. By which meanes, you see that paines and labour
taken about acornes and other seedes of trees, causeth them to grow and prosper so,
as that they get the better of other plants, which in continuance might ouergrow
them: b
                        •
                     t if they remaine as forsaken things without husbanding, they vvill bee
choaked vp vvith vveedes, and the greatest part of them die: and those vvhich
shall escape, vvill bee but of low growth, and appeare like an vntimely birth, lacking
helpe and dressing, except through long continuance of time they preuaile, and
then they which planted or sowed, shall not reape any pleasure by them, but their
heires onely.
                  And in all such sorts of planting and sowing of vvild seeds, it is necessarie to fence
a place sowed or planted, so vvel and sufficiantly with ditches, hedges, or vvals, as that
no beast, horse, or other may enter or get in: as also that thereby the vvood may bee
kept from being handled or cut downe by passengers: for if the sprig bee brused or
broken, the tree remaineth all parched and readie to drie.
                  According to this manner of planting of acornes, or chesnuts, they may very
vvell and conueniently bee set and planted amongst the plants of trees, and rootes
that are planted farre enough off one from another, for so they may haue roome betwixt
two plants, being distant the quantitie of nine or ten foot, or thereabout, seeing
it is meet and conuenient to nourish trees, and to destroie vveedes. By this meanes
the acornes and chesnuts, or any other thing planted vvith the dibble, or sowne
in furrowes, is dressed amongst the rest, and made to enioy sufficient scope betwixt

two plants, there to take their full growth, vntill they become like high, or very neere
with the trees planted or cut, neither do they cost extraordinarily for their dressing,
because the whole ground is to be dressed, because of the other plants that are in it.
And in as much as it is oftentimes found in countries that there are neither vnderwoods,
woods, bushes, nor hedges whereout any may get a plant growing from
roots, I haue thought good to intreat a little of the meanes of making it grow of
seed. Like as is woont to bee done with fruit trees, and those which are taken from
their nurceries, to bee transplanted into gardens: so may you doe with wilde trees,
which after that they are growne to a sufficient thickenesse, and come to beare seede,
may be otherwhere either grafted or planted, as you shall wish or desire. For which
cause heere shall be put downe a treatise and chapter thereof, seeing the former intreateth
of the intermingling of seed with plants, for to helpe out the storing of
woods which are alwaies to continue.
               
               
                  CHAP. XII.
                  Of the way to make wild trees grow of seede, to be remoued afterward
into some other place.
                  
                     CErtaine it is (as hath beene said before) that euery tree groweth either of a
plant, or of some great fruit, or of a writhen branch: and for that there
are many places where one cannot come by plants easily, it is to be attempted
to make the said plant to grow of seed, as is practised in the
nurceries of tame a
                        •
                     d garden trees, by dressing and dunging some halfe acre of good
ground, and then to sow it with such good seed as that the trees beare, whereof you
would haue plants.
                  That is to say, with acornes, if you would store your selfe with oakes: or with
chesnuts, if you desue chesnut trees: or with the graine and seed which groweth in
elme trees, if you would haue elme plants. The said grains and seeds must be sowne
in a fat, fertile, well dunged, and somewhat moist ground, and that reasonably thick,
therein couering the said seeds two fingers thicke, and causing them to be well watered
afterwards, and couered with bright straw, to the end that this fruit of young
trees sprouting out of the seed, bee not eaten and broken by birds: but when they
begin to grow, the straw must be taken away, and the weeds growing amongst them
weeded out with the hand.
                  For which cause the quarters wherein the said seeds are to be sowne, must be made
long and narrow, that so the weeds may easily be puld vp out of euery place, without
treading vpon the quarters, and that the said weeds may be gathered gently, to
auoid the doing of hurt vnto the roots of the young trees: and oftentimes they must
be watered at night after Sunne set, and in the morning before Sunne rise.
                  And after they be growne three foot high, you must remoue them into some other
ground before they take any stronger root, and set them good two foot distant one
from another, till they haue got a competent thicknesse, such as is before described,
and dresse and clense them from all weeds, and water them in the time of drought.
Thus you shall reare plants of all sorts, and of all manner of wild trees, to remoue afterward
into such places as you will, and such trees will grow very well being transplanted,
as are of like age and sort: for so the one of them cannot hurt or iniurie
another.
                  This is to be practised in places where no plants of trees can be found in sufficient
store: for otherwise in countries furnished with vnderwoods, and woods, there ar
                        •
                     
inough to be found without taking this plant, and tedious protract of time: wherefore
this article will be of vse, where there is neither vnderwood, wood, nor plant to
become by in hedges or bushes, and not in this countrie, where there are many to be
gotten, and those very good.

                  Of the pleasure that commeth of the planting of wilde
woods, as also of the profit comming
of the same.
                  
                     AMongst the things required for the making of a place of perfect beautie,
Cato in his booke of Husbandrie saith, That it is needfull to haue nine
principall things:Nine things requ
                           •
                        site for the ma
                           •
                        ing of a beautifull place The first, is a Vine, yeelding great quantitie of vvine:
the second, a Garden, full of little riuers: the third, a Willow groue, and
Oziar plot: the fourth, a great Riuer: the fifth, a Medow: the sixth, a great champion
ground: the seuenth, Coppies of vnderwood: the eight, plentie of Bushes, and a
Warren: and the ninth, a forrest of great Trees or Oakes to beare Acornes. Now amongst
all these seuerall points of perfect beautie, we may see, that the principall is
vvater and vvood: because that hauing vvater, one may easily make Medowes, Garden
plots, Oziar yards, and Willow plots all along the vvaters and riuers: and hauing
vvoods, one may make Vnderwoods, Warrens, Bushes, and high great trees also,
if it be lopt and pruned vnderneath to make it shoot vp and grow on high. And
he must not leaue aboue three or foure branches at the most, and then they will become
tall and high by and by, because that the root is disburdened of all, the rest of
his boughes▪ by hauing them cut downe: in like sort, the ground sendeth all such
nourishment vnto these three or foure branches, as it had imployed in the nourishment
of many branches of small vvood, and affoordeth growth vnto the straightest
and fairest branches, which are left behind to come to perfection: thus in a small
time they become tall and great trees, and beare acornes. So, in like manner, there
is not that vvood of high and great growth cut downe in good and seasonable time,
vvhich putteth not forth small vvood and bushes, if cattell and beasts be carefully,
kept out.
                  Whereupon I will conclude that in planting of woods, there are three things principally
requisite to the making of a beautifull place,Woods haue in t
                           ••
                        m three commodities. that is to say, little wood, great
wood, bushes and a warren: for it is the like reason to plant the one and the other; for
of the one the other is made: wherefore in respect of the pleasure, profit, and beauty
of the place, it is meet and conuenient to plant woods.
                  But the chiefe pleasure and pastime which commeth by wild woods, is, that being
ioined to your house and champion habitation,The pleasures and past
                           •
                        mes that the wild woods a
                           ••
                        ord. (which is the place, where it must be
seated or planted) it is pleasant to the sight: for by its diuersity of greenenesse, it
maruellously delighteth, and with great contentment recreateth the sight.
                  The second pleasure or pastime is, that the woods (being neere vnto your lodging)
are alwaies full of all sorts of pretie birds, which sing Sommer and Winter all the day
long, and most part of the night, as nightingales, and such other like, whereby their
songs become ioyfull and delightsome to the eare, and so there is a pleasure and great
contentment to the eare euen to them in the house if it be neere vnto.
                  Another pleasure is, that in the said woods there are alwaies great store of wood
coists, popingaies, stares, cranes, and other sorts of birds, which make you pastime to
see them flie: and there may also pleasure be reaped in taking of them with little engines,
as, with a call, nets, the tonnell, or other such like.
                  The fourth is, that in the woods there are to bee had conies, hares, squirrels,
and other sorts of small beastes pleasant to behold, and of great seruice for prouision
of vitaile.
                  The fifth is, that in hot seasons you may purchase a coole aire within the said
woods, as those which will couer and defend you from the iniurie and vexation of the

Sunne, and contrariwise, cooling you, vvhether the heat will or no: and therein
you haue also to behold a comfortable greenenesse, both vpon the boughes and
ground, vvhich keepeth his grasse greene through the coolenesse and shadow of
the trees.
                  The sixth is, that in Winter being in the said vvoods, you are out of the iniurie
and force of the vvinds and great cold, because they breake them off: and further, in
these vvoods you are solitarie, and may vse your leasure, in reading, writing or meditating
vpon your affaires, vvithout being disquieted or distracted, or drawne to cast
your sight abroad ouer any farre distant place or countrey, in as much as the sight cannot
pierce through the boughes or bushes.
                  Besides the said pleasures,The profit of woods. there commeth much profit thereof, as well for the feeding
of cattell, and that in the shadow, and with store of grasse at commandement at
all times, as also in respect of the Oake mast, Beech mast, Chesnuts, and other fruits
vvhich the trees beare, vvhich serue for the fatting of hogges, and are very necessarie
for other beasts: and for that also you may, vpon certaine yeares, make fall of your
vvoods, to make faggots, fire vvood, stakes to hedge in garden plots, and other inclosures,
as also rods for Vines to runne vpon: and if there be cut downe any Chesnut-trees,
or Hasels, you may (besides the things alreadie named) make your profit
of hoopes and boords for vvine-vessels, in such sort, as that these your vvoods shall
not onely doe you pleasure, but profit also, if so be you be so disposed to make
your vse of it.
                  By this meanes you may coniecture, that the ground which is imploied in bearing
of vvood,The profit of ground imploied about the bearing of wood. is not any thing inferior in profit vnto others which are imployed in bearing
of Corne and Vines.
                  It is very true, that the commaundement, or vse and profit of it, are longer time in
purchasing, and more hardly come by, than that of Corne and Vines, but it recompenceth
it with the double in the end: for the first charges once defrayed, nature
bringeth forth both the greater and the smaller vvood vvithout the helpe of man,
and vvithout any labour: vvhich happeneth not in Corne-grounds and Vineyards,
seeing they beare not, except they be continually husbanded and tilled. Wherefore,
the ground imploied in Beech mast, and vvood, yeeldeth as much profit as any other,
and will stand the house in as great stead, seeing it cannot be any way held or inhabited
without vvood.
                  I haue heere beene the more vvilling to declare and lay downe in briefe the
pleasure and profit that commeth of vvoods, to the end, that they which take paines
in those courses, may not thinke that they haue lost their time and cost bestowed
thereupon, and that they may not be ashamed at the first blow of their trauaile
and long attendance, seeing that afterward both the pleasure and the profit doth
abide and continue vvithout any further cost, and that vnto them and their posteritie.
                  Wherefore, my counsell and aduise vnto the good husband and master of the familie,
is, that he apply himselfe to such planting of vvoods betimes, that so he may the
sooner enioy the pleasures thereof: and that in so doing, he cast them so, as that they
may grow as neere vnto his lodging and house where he meaneth to dwell, as possibly
may be, for his further both profit and pleasure: for if no good else should come
thereof, yet they would serue to breake the raging and blustering vvindes annoying
the house, if they be well placed, and so conueniently, as a man may be able to dispose
them.

                  A treatise of the nature, properties, and differences of wilde trees,
and what ground they delight most in.
                  
                     SEeing it hath beene deliuered and laid downe here aboue, what time and
manner is to be obserued in the planting of all wild trees, and in giuing
them such tillage, as may easily, and in short time, procure their growth;
it hath seemed good vnto me, to write some little thing of the nature and
sorts of trees which are planted and found ordinarily in the vvoods and forrests of
France, and to declare briefely what manner of ground they delight in, and in what
soile they proue greatest and most profitable: to the end, that the planters of them be
not frustrated of their paines and purpose, and that that which requireth a drie and
hot soyle, be not planted in a moist and low soyle: as also, that the trees vvhich delight
in a moist and low countrey, be not planted in mountaines and drie countries:
for this falleth out oftentimes to be the cause, that such as bestow their cost in planting,
doe misse of their intent, and that the plant being in a ground cleane contrarie
vnto it, doth not come to any profit. For which cause, I will here in a word expresse
my mind concerning that point, not with any purpose to describe or comprise all the
natures, vertues, and properties of trees, neither yet to speake of all kinds of trees, but
onely to describe and declare the places and grounds wherein they prosper and grow
most, as also to make knowne the diuersitie that is amongst trees of one and the same
sort, and of one and the same name: as which are most fit to be planted, and best for to
make shadowes to walke or sit in.
                  I know, that there are diuers sorts of trees that grow both in the Easterne, Northerne,
and Southerne parts of the vvorld, vvhereof we are almost altogether ignorant,
and which, in respect of the diuersitie of the regions, doe not grow at all in this
climate: and of these I mind not to speake at all, because my purpose is only in briefe
to lay downe that which is necessarie to be knowne about the planting of common
trees, such as are ordinarily to be found in our owne forrests, and not of strange and
forraine ones, the trouble about which would be more than the pleasure. And as for
such as are desirous to attaine the perfect knowledge of all manner of trees growing
in any part of the world, and their vertues, properties, natures, and seeds, they may see
the same at large in Theophrastus, in his fourth booke of the historie of Plants, and in
the third booke, vvhere hee particularly entreateth of the kinds of wild and sauage
trees: for he particularly runneth through the nature, force, vertue, seed, and manner
of planting of euery wild tree, as well those of the East, North, and South, as those of
the West: but it shall be sufficient for vs at this time to declare the nature of fiue or six
sorts of trees which commonly grow in the countries hereby, and of their kinds, and
what ground euery one delighteth in.
                  Now therefore to begin, there are two sorts of trees in generall: the one is called
vvater-trees, or trees delighting to grow in or neere vnto the brinkes of vvaters,Trees louing to liue neere the water. in
medowes, and in low and watrie places: the other land trees, or trees delighting to
grow vpon the firme and solid land, and vvhere the waters by inundations or ouerflowings
vse not to come. But first we will speake of the trees liuing in or about
vvater.
               
               
                  
                  CHAP. XV.
                  Of the Aller, Poplar, Birch, Willow, and other trees
haunting the water.
                  
                     YOu shall vnderstand, that there are foure or fiue sorts of trees, vvhich of
their owne nature grow neere vnto vvaters, and which, except they haue
great store of moisture doe hardly prosper or grow at all: of vvhich, amongst
the rest, the Aller is one that most coueteth the vvater: for the
Aller is of that nature, as that it would be halfe couered in vvater, and
at the least, the most part of the rootes must of necessitie be within, and stand lower
than the vvater, for otherwise they would not take, insomuch, as that trees of such
nature ought to be planted in moist medowes, and neere vnto the brookes running
along by the said medowes, or in marshes, for in such grounds they take and
grow exceeding vvell. This tree is apt to take in moist places, because it is a
vvhite vvood, containing much pith, and putting forth great store of boughes in
a short time, by reason of the moistnesse of the vvaters vvherewith it is nourished
and fed.
                  The said Aller trees may be planted two manner of wayes, as namely, either of
branches gathered from great Allers, or of liue roots digged vp in most places, together
with the earth, and set againe in the like ground, and that in such sort, as that the
halfe of the said roots be lower than the water, and the vpper part couered with earth
the depth of one finger: and in the meane time, before they be planted, they must haue
all their branches cut off too, within a fingers length of the root, and it will put forth
againe many young shoots, after the manner of Hasel trees. You may read more of the
Aller tree in the fourth booke.
                  There is another sort of vvater-wood, which hereabout is commonly called white
wood:White wood. of this kind, are the Poplar, Birch, and other sorts of wood, which grow close
by the water side, and vpon the banks of ditches, springs, and little brookes: and it is
a common practise in Italie, to lay their conueyances and pipes to carrie their vvater
from riuers throughout their grounds, of those woods. And these kinds of trees may
be easily planted of young roots along by the vvater and riuer side, both most conueniently
and profitably, especially the white Poplar, otherwise called the Aspe tree,
whose leaues are apt to shake with euerie small winde. Where rootes cannot be got,
there may, in their stead, be taken faire and strong plants, such as are vsed in the
planting of Willowes. The Birch doth somewhat resemble the white Poplar in
his barke, and the Beech tree in his leafe, but it craueth a colder and moister
soile than the Poplar. And this is the cause why it groweth so plentifully in cold
countries.
                  The other sort of vvater-wood is the Willow: vvhich, as wee finde by proofe,
groweth nothing well, except it be in a moist and warrie countrie, and neere ioyning
to vvaters. The manner of planting of Willowes, is commonly, by setting of Willow
plants, and those such as are of a good thicknesse and strength, as namely as great
as one may gripe: for looke how much the stronger and thicker they be, so much the
moe shoots will they put forth, and so much the stronger. This tree differeth much
from the Aller: for the Aller will haue his rootes all within water, but the Willow
would stand higher, and spread his roots along into the ground that is wet and moist,
and neere vnto water, vvithout hauing his roots altogether in the water: according
whereunto, it is continually seene, that Willowes planted vpon causeyes &amp; banks, hauing
some ditch of water ioyning thereunto, &amp; that in such sort, as that their roots may
reach but to the brinks and edges of the water, proue fairer, taller, and more plentifull
than those which grow in waterish medows, because that for the 
                        ••
                     st part their roots
stand moist in water. You may read of the Holme tree in the fourth booke.
                  
                     
I say not that Willowes, Allers, Poplars, &amp; such white wood will not grow in high
places, notwithstanding that it is their nature to grow neere to water, and doe prosper
best in such places: and if they be planted in high places, and farre from vvater, they
are hardly nourished, and put forth very little in growth: insomuch, as that a hundred
such trees as are planted in waterie countries, vvill yeeld more vvood than a thousand
planted in a drie countrey, notwithstanding all the indeuor and husbandrie that can
be vsed, yea, and they will perish and die a great deale sooner.
                  This I say, because it is easie to make them grow, and to husband them in a high
or hillie place, by watering and dressing of them in conuenient sort: vvhich labours,
as they are not performed without great cost, so if they happen to be neglected, it
proueth to be the losse and spoile of the trees: vvhereas if they be planted in some
place that is fit for them, and neere vnto vvater, according as their nature requireth,
they vvill prosper vvithout the toile or industrie of man vsed therein. Notwithstanding,
for as much as the first yeares after they be planted they haue much to doe to
shoot and nourish their roots and such branches as are alreadie put forth, it wil be best
to free them of all such twigs as they shall put forth the first yeare, to the end they may
more easily seed their roots, as also that thereby the force of winds, which would take
such hold of offall, may not shake and loosen those which are alreadie fast, for vpon
such causes trees doe many times die, be they neuer so well planted.
                  I know that it is not alwaies required, that such paines should be taken (especially
about those which are orderly and conueniently planted) in planting or p
                        •
                     uning of
them: notwithstanding, I say thus much for them vvhich goe about the making of
close alleyes for walkes and shades, that they may cause them to grow much in a short
time, for this they shall effect by planting of them in furrowes, and not one of them
perish: and as for their paine and labour, they shall haue the pleasure thereof in shorter
time and larger manner.
                  Herewithall it must be noted,Trees must be well and surely planted at the first. that whensoeuer you set or plant any such trees, you
must so doe it, as that it need not a second doing: for if any of them should die, it
would be the harder to set others in their places, so as that they would thriue, because
the shadow of the other which liue, would cause the same to die, seeing it is vsually
seene, that the elder and stronger ones doe oppresse the weaker, keeping them vnder,
and causing them to miscarrie. Wherefore the greater care is to be vsed in the first
planting of them, and the more paine to be taken with them, seeing the sequele is a
thin
                        •
                      that is so hard to be redressed.
                  The time to plant Willowes,The time to plant Willowes, Allers, &amp;c. Allers, Poplars, and other such vvoods, is alwaies
found best in the beginning of Februarie, or at the later end of Ianuarie, vvhen the
great cold is past, being otherwise apt to hurt such plants as are new set, as hath alreadie
beene said.
                  As concerning the properties of these trees thus delighting in watrie grounds: the
leaues and flowers of the white Poplar, although they be a little hot, doe notwithstanding
make a very cooling ointment called Populeum, good to take away the heat of
inflamations, as also the milke out of womens breasts that are newly deliuered.
                  Birch-tree yeeldeth twigs, which serue to make rods for the punishing of theeues
withall, as also to make baskets, little maunds, beesomes, and couerings for earthen
bottles. Of the stocke is made charcoale, seruing for the melting of mettall: And of
the rinde are made links to giue light in the night season: for to such end doe country
people vse them. The iuice of the leaues mixt amongst the runnet of a Calfe, doth
keepe cheese from wormes and rottennesse. If you pierce the stock of the Birch-tree,
there will come forth a water, which being drunke a long time, is of power to breake
the stone of the reines and bladder: being taken in a gargarisme, it drieth the vlcers
of the mouth: and being vsed in lotions, it cleanseth and taketh away the filthinesse
and infections of the skin.

                  Of Ashes, Elmes, and Maple-trees.
                  
                     THe Ash doth naturally craue a low and waterish countrey,Ash-
                           〈◊〉
                        . and therefore
doth grow more plentifully in such places than in high grounds: and
therefore, for the most part, they must be planted in such low and waterie
grounds, though not altogether so low and waterie as the Willow,
Poplar, and Aller doe craue: howbeit notwithstanding they may be planted in indifferent
grounds, and Elmes will grow well therein. Their proper nature is to delight
in moist valleyes, for therein they prosper well, and grow vp to a great height,
with straitnesse and beautifulnesse of Timber: Notwithstanding, this is a common
vvood, vvhich may be planted in all sorts of grounds, howsoeuer that it like better
in fat and moist grounds, than in those which are but indifferent: but they much dislike
the drie, rough, stiffe, and grauellie grounds, if they be not mingled with moisture.
The auncient Woodwards vsed to plant them most in hedge-rowes, and on
the tops of great bankes or ditches, where they might haue drie standing, yet be continually
fed at the root with a little moisture: vvhich sure was a very good and husbandly
manner of planting the Ash, neither shall you at any time see it prosper better,
than when it is planted in such places. It is naturally of it selfe 
                        •
                      little more tender
than other wild trees, and desireth a more gentle and loose mould, which maketh
them prosper the best in mixt hasell grounds, or in moist sandie ground: yet if they
doe take in clay grounds, as doubtlesse with a verie little care they will doe, one Ash
so growing, is better, tougher, and more seruiceable than any three which are taken
from the sandie or mixed earths. It is a timber of no lesse precious vse than any other
whatsoeuer: for of it are made all your best Pykes, Byll-shafts, Halberd-shafts, and
diuers other engines for the vvarres: of it also is made all manner of Plow and Carttimber
vvhatsoeuer, as Beames, Heads, Skeathes, Hales, Spyndles, Shelboords, Cart
or Wayne bodies, rings for Wheeles, Naues, Harrow-buls, Harrow-teeth, Axle-trees,
and any other instrument or engine vvhich desireth a firme, gentle yet a verie tough
vvood: a timber that must bend before it breake, and not by any meanes be too extreame
portable or heauie in the carriage, but both light for the hand of him that
shall vse it, and also strong ynough to endure the stresse or labour it shall be put
vnto; also it must be gentle and soft to cut: all which the Ash is, more than any other
tree whatsoeuer.
                  There are three sorts of Elmes:Elmes of three sorts. The one is, of those vvhich haue a small little
leafe, and a blacke stalke: The second hath a large leafe, and a reasonable
vvhite stalke: The third of them hath a verie large leafe, and the stalke as it
vvere all vvhite. Those vvhich are to be chosen for planting, are those two later,
for they are of greater growth, and are vvoont to prosper better: besides
that, they are fairer, and put foorth moe boughes, making thereby a greater
shadow.
                  Of these three sorts, there are both males and females:Male and female Elmes. vvee call those females,
vvhich beare most fruit, and the thicker seede; and the males vvee call
those vvhich are lesser, and beare their fruit of seede, in the middest of the leaues,
and that in such sort, as that they seeme to beare neyther fruit nor seede. And
for this cause there are manie that vvrite of Husbandrie, affirming the said tree
to beare no fruit or seede, and that it groweth either of a plant or shoot. And
of this opinion vvas Trem
                           •
                        lius. Notwithstanding, it is certaine, that euerie leafe
beareth his fruit contained within the middest thereof, and thereof vvill Elmes
grow, being sowne in due time. And of this opinion is Columella;
                     Columella. and experience
it selfe doth shew the same: hee making two differing sorts of Elmes, calling
the one sort, the fairest and tallest Elmes of Fraunce: and the other sort,

Italian Elmes. And as concerning those fairest Elmes, if they be to be found, they
must be planted, because they grow vp the sooner that way, and put forth much larger
boughes. Theophrastus
                     Theophr
                           •
                        stus. and some other vvriters doe make them lesse differing,
according to the countrey wherein they grow. I haue beene the more willing to describe
them according to their kind of leafe and vvood, that you may the more easily
know them. I would haue you to looke backe into the fourth booke, and there you
shall find their natures and vertues more at large described. The soiles in which they
most of all delight, is a verie stiffe clay: and the principall vse of them, ouer and
aboue the making of Bow-staues formerly mentioned, is the making of naues for
vvaggons or cart-vvheeles, for vvhich they are more excellent than any other vvood
vvhatsoeuer; and the more knottie and twound they are, a great deale the 
                        •
                     itter
they are for that purpose: so, that as the cleane growne, smooth, and euen Elme
serues for other purposes, so the knottie, vneuen, and most crooked Elme will
serue for this.
                  Amongst these sorts of trees wee may place the Maple-trees (called of the Latines
Ac
                           •
                        res) because in their nature they somewhat resemble the Elme: They craue the
like ground, namely, a fat and moist ground: they grow (as the Elmes doe) in all arable
grounds: they put forth in a short time great branches, and but little greenenes
                        •
                     e.
This tree hath a verie white bodie, beareth small leaues like the leaues of three-leaued
grasse, and doth not breed or gather any great store of vermine. It naturally
groweth short
                        •
                      crooked, rugged, and beareth seldome any great length of timber:
yet where it groweth otherwise, the timber is verie firme, white, close, and durable.
It serueth for diners excellent and good purposes: as namely, it is the best of all other,
by reason of the wonderfull whitenesse thereof, for all manner of inlaid works,
vvhich Ioyners vse: also it is excellent for all manner of Turners vvare: as for the
making of trenchers, dishes, bowles, sewing kniues, and other implements for the
Table, prouided, it be euermore of at least a yeare or more seasoning: for if it be
wrought greene, it will warpe, ryue, and be indeed for no purpose. Many vse to
season it in a drie house, but then it asketh a longer time, and the sappe will be much
longer in consuming: but the best way is to let it lye abroad all the first Winter, and
take all wet which falls, for that will driue the naturall wet of the sappe soonest out of
it, and then house it the Summer following, and then after you may safely worke it
at your pleasure.
                  The Ash is contrarily inclined:The Ash. for thereon breedeth oftentimes such aboundance
of vermine, as that thereby all their leaues are eaten and bored verie full
of little holes. Of this sort of Trees, as well Elmes, as Ashes and Maples, the
best are those vvhich grow the soonest, and spread out the largest boughes in a
short time.
                  As concerning the properties of these three kinds of Trees,The vertues of the Elme. wee haue spoken in
the third booke, in the Chapter of Balmes, how there is made a singular balme of
the little fruit that is found inclosed in the leaues of one of the sorts of Elmes.
Furthermore, the vvater vvhich is found inclosed in this little fruit, maketh the
face neat and shining, if it be vvashed therewith: againe, double linnen clothes
being vvet in this iuice or vvater, and applyed vnto children vvhich are bursten,
becommeth a singular remedie for them. The same iuice also put into a glasse-bottle,
and buried in the earth, or dung, for the space of fiue and twentie daies,
being well stopped, and hauing the bo
                        •
                     tome set vpon a heape of salt, proueth singular
good to cure greene vvounds, if they be dressed vvith tents steeped in the
said iuice.
                  The Maple-tree in this countrey amongst other things is had in request,Shooting 
                           •
                        owes. because
of the boughes thereof there are made Bowes, and that because they are stiffe and
hard to bend.
                  The Ash-tree hath a singular vertue against the venime of Serpents: for it is such
an enemie, and so contrarie vnto them, as that they dare not draw neere or approach
vnto the shadow thereof: and againe, as hath beene proued of many, if you

make (as it were) a circle of the leaues or boughes of the Ash-tree, and put within the
same a Serpent by the one side thereof, and a burning fire on the other side, the Adder
will rather aduenture to passe through the fire, than ouer the Ash-tree leaues. For this
cause Nature, as one carefull of the good of mankind, hath prouided, that the Ash
should flourish before that Adders and Vipers doe vse to come out of their holes in
the Spring time: as also, that it should not fall his leaues in Autumne, till they haue taken
vp their Winter resting place. Wherefore, if it happen, that any Horse, Cow, or
other beasts of the Farmers should be bitten by some serpent or other venimous
beasts, there cannot be found a more soueraigne remedie, than to stampe the tenderest
leaues that are to be found vpon the Ash, &amp; straining out the iuice, to giue it the beast
to drink, and afterward to lay vpon the grieued part the dr
                        •
                     sse of the stamped leaues:
this is likewise a good remedie for men that are bitten of any Adder or Viper. The
decoction of the rinde of the Ash-tree taken, is singular good to open the obstructions
of the Spleene, and to draw out great store of water from such as haue the Dropsie,
as also to make fat folks leane. Also the keyes of the Ash, or that which is the seed
thereof, is of most singular vse amongst Painters, and being ground, maketh him diuers
pretie and most vsefull colours. The Ash is onely an enemie vnto corne, and will
not suffer any to grow by any meanes within the compasse of the shadow thereof:
and therefore it should as seldome as might be, be planted in corne-fields, except you
leaue such large space of greeneswarth betwixt it and the corne-lands, that no part
of the shadow may extend to the same.

                  Of Chesnut-trees.
                  
                     THe Chesnut-tree is a strong and mightie tree, much like vnto the Oake.
It is a fast wood, and good to build withall, as also to vnderprop Vines,
and make other workes, which are made of Oake. It groweth of the
seed of the Chesnut, which is sowne after the manner of the Acorne, and
so it groweth and putteth forth his shoots both sooner and more effectually, and taketh
commonly in all grounds, yea euen in the sandie or grauellie grounds: but yet it
shunneth the grounds that lie open to the pearching heat of the Sun, affecting altogether
the little hils and mountaines that are cold and lie vpon the North. The seed
or fruit thereof (called the Chesnut) is sometimes spoyled, and that after the same
manner that the Acorne is, as by too much drinesse, vvhich maketh it that it cannot
bud or blossome: or by too great store of vvater, putrifying both the Chesnut and
Acorne, before it can spring out of the earth: or else by cattell, moules, field-mice, and
such sorts of vermine, which eat or wound the Chesnut &amp; Acorne within the ground.
The nature of the young plants of Chesnut-trees and Oakes are much alike, and the
manner of dressing them also: and if you would haue them to put forth store of
boughes, you must cut them after they haue beene planted three or foure yeares, and
not before, and that in the beginning of the Spring time, for so you shall make them
put forth twice as much: and yet it is not without danger to vse any edge-toole in cutting
them, for thereby they oftentimes die. So then, if there put forth any branches or
sprigs along the stem, in the first, second, or third yeare, you may at the beginning of
such their putting forth crop them off, and breake them away with your hand whiles
they are young and tender, and not to take any knife vnto them, and then you shall
doe best.
               
               
                  
                  CHAP. XVIII.
                  Of the Oake and the differences thereof, Hornebeame, Beech,
Linden tree, and others.
                  
                     YOu shall vnderstand that the oake is a tree bearing most fruit, and affoording
the most commoditie of any tree in France. And for this cause it
hath been accustomed to preserue and keepe store of these kinds of trees
in old woods and forests,The different names of the okes are Robur, Quercus, Ilex. as being most necessarie and profitable. Some
do make three sorts of this kind of tree, and of euery sort a male and a
female: for notwithstanding that the common people call them all by the common
name of oke, yet the Latins attribute to euery sort his seueral and proper name, calling
one sort thereof Robur, another Quercus, and the third Ilex.
                  
                  The first of these sorts is a kind of oake which is very thicke and strong, hauing a
bodie that is very thicke below, and full of knots, and very mightie, hauing great
roots, and spreading far and wide in the ground: and at the top of the bodie or bole
which is but short, it beareth many and great quantitie of boughes that are also
thick, spread abroad and long, taking great roome: and for that cause are planted the
one from the other a great distance, that so they may haue roome for their boughs to
spread. The wood growing vpon this sort of okes is fitter to make fire wood of, than
timber to build withal, because it hath but a short bole, and riseth not vp to any great
height and squarenesse, hauing his boughes therewithall crooked and writhen. There
are many forrests to be seene, wherein this kind of oakes doth grow, as namely those
whose oakes are thicke and short, standing far a sunder, and yet spreading on a great
breadth aboue.
                  The other sort of oakes hath both a reasonable thicke and long bodie, as namely
of the height of foure or fiue good fadomes, as also foure or fiue reasonable tail and
straight boughes growing thereupon, but nor spread forth into any great breadth, as
neither the bodie is so well couered and shadowed therewith as the former. And
this sort of oakes is good for beames of houses, and great peeces of timber, to be put
in buildings, as also for to saw and clea
                        •
                     e, because it is not knottie and hard as the former.
And of th
                        •
                     s sort there are to be seene many forrests planted in France, and they
are more thicke and closer growne with timber, than the others which I am about to
speake of, because the boughes of these doe rise more straight vp, and take not vp so
much roome.
                  The third sort of oakes hath a small bodie, but very straight, and growing to the
height of seuen or eight fadomes without any boughes, and at the top of their said
bodies, bearing, but s
                        •
                     al store of boughes and wood, in such sort, as that all the wood
is in the bole, seeming to bee onely a nosegay at the top. And this kind of wood
standeth very neere the foot one of another, rising vp equally and alike vnto a great
height and greatnesse, and the forrests furnished with this kind, are very profitable to
make all sorts of buildings, whe
                        •
                     her it be to make the ioyces thereof, or any of the
other sorts of long and middle timber, as those required for for walls or roofes. And
of this kind of wood there are many forrests in this countrie.
                  All these three sorts of wood do beare a great leafe, and that euery one like vnto
another, saue that they are some of them large and great, some but indifferent and the
third sort small and little. Againe, they beare some of them acornes that are more
long and thicke, othersome, acornes that are more thicke and short, and againe other
some of them, acornes that are smaller and longer.
                  Furthermore, there is not any of these three sorts which consisteth not of male and
female.The male and female of oakes. The female is commonly called that (as Theophrastus
                     Theophrastus. saith) which beareth
the most and strongest fruit: whereupon it followeth, that if those are to bee called
the females which do beare most store of fruit; wee must needs call those males,

which beare least fruit. When they beare fruit, or when they beare none, the barren
are called the males,The barren is called the male, and the fruitfull the female. and the fruitfull the females. Theophrastus putteth another difference
betwixt those which are fruitlesse: but I meane not to write any thing thereof
at this present, purposing to be briefe, &amp; to referre such as are desirous to see the same,
to Theophrastus his third booke of the historie of Plants, vnder the title of the Oake:
as also in like manner for all other sorts of trees, vvhich I spare to speake of, that so I
may not exceed my former purpose and intent.
                  All these sorts of Oakes are of great continuance and length of life, insomuch, as
that some allot vnto them to liue three hundred yeares:That the life of an Oake containeth 100 yeares of growth, 100. yeares of standing in a s
                           •
                        ay, and 100. to per
                           •
                        sh and die in. that is to say, one hundred to
grow, one hundred to stand at a stay, and one hundred to decline and fal away: which
may easily be seene in the old and auncient forrests.
                  And whereas the Oake is long in comming to his growth, and long in dying, it is
no maruell, if the Elme, the Ash, the Maple, and other vvoods, set in the like and no
better ground, doe put forth their boughes and branches more speedily and mightily
than the Oake: for the nature of those trees is to grow vp soone to their p
                        ••
                     fection,
and so to die and fade soone; and the nature of the Oake is to grow by leisure, to flourish
a long time, and to be long before it die. Now Nature will not be ouer-chased:
as may be seene in a horse,The horse at his full growth at fiue, and a man a
                           •
                         fiue and twentie. which commeth to his growth in fiue yeares, and man not
before he be fiue and twentie; and so the whole continuance of the one is more durable
than that of the other. This I speake in respect of such, as by and by looke to
haue vvood to become growne according as they can wish: giuing them to know,
that to answere their hastie desire, it will be best for them to plant Ashes, Elmes, and
Maple onely, seeing they are giuen to spring mightily, and in a short time, putting
forth more boughes in sixe yeares, than the Oake in tenne. Whereas they which desire
to haue a more pleasant, profitable, and durable vvood, though it be longer in
comming to perfection, must plant Oakes, Chesnut-trees, Horne-beames, and Beech-trees,
for they are reasonably long in growing, and of like durablenesse, and put forth
but small store of shoots, like as the Oake, in such sort, as that they become trees of one
and the same sort and growth, and to be planted after one manner, and at one time, as
hath been said before. It is very true, that the Oake delighteth in a fat, good, and drie
ground, euen as the Horne-beame and Beech-tree doe: notwithstanding, the Horne-beame
and Beech will grow more easily in a stonie ground or countrey, although that
euery sort of trees whatsoeuer be giuen to grow the better, by how much the ground is
better wherein they are planted. But some doe naturally delight in and craue a good
ground, as for example the Oake, if you would haue it to prosper well: for and if you
plant it in an indifferent ground, it will prosper but indifferently: and if it be set in
a hard and barren soile, it hardly prospereth, and doth nothing but burne away with
the heat of the Sunne: and yet Horne-beames and Beeches doe grow in grounds
that are but indifferent: yea, they may be seene to prosper well in hard and stonie
grounds.
                  The pits are in good season opened, and all the said trees more conueniently
planted, in the moneth of Februarie, when the strength of Winter it well broken, as
alwaies hath beene said.

in times past beene vsed to helue husbandmens tooles, and to make yokes for Oxen:

drinesse, and which maketh the b

defect of the Tree, but from the ill husbanding and planting of the same,
vvhen either it is not regarded at the first shooting vp, or is cropped by cattell
vvhen it is tender, or else planted in a stiffe-binding earth, in vvhich it ioyeth not
at all, any of vvhich makes it grow crooked, knottie, and vvithout forme, and so
consequently of small vse: but being planted on good ground, vvhose mould is
loose and yeelding, and husbanded and defended from other annoyances, it vvill
shoot forth straight and vpright, and beare a verie smooth and most delicate timber:

which timber is of great price and estimation amongst Fletchers, for it maketh the
strongest and best arrow of any wood whatsoeuer, and is preferred farre before either
birch or brasill, as being of an indifferent and true poise, neither so light as the one,
nor so heauie as the other.

neere, so it craueth the like soile and dressing for the making of it to thriue and grow
well: it is true, that therefore it is worthie to bee had in request, because it bringeth

thereupon. The men of auncient time did make their wine vessels, fats, and drinking
vessell of the rind of this tree.

small stones, whether mixt with sand or clay it mattereth not, prouided that the
mould bee not too much tough and binding, neither exceeding hard and rockie,
but apt to breake and yeeld to the roote, which by reason of the greatnesse of the
boale or bodie of the tree, which may euer compaire with the oake, ought to haue
both a strong and a deep hold. The timber of the beech is good for boards or planks,

timber, it is not so much allowed therefore: it is also very good for Turners ware,
and especially, for great washing bowles, traies, and such like, or any other houshold
necessarie, which desireth a plaine smooth wood, which is gentle to cut, and delicate
for the eie to looke on.

pilled off without doing of any iniurie vnto the same: and this is ordinarily imploied

                  CHAP. XIX.
                  Of the situation of the Parkes, and of the manner of ordering
the wild beasts therein.
                  
                     TO the end we may not leaue any thing out of this description of a countrie
farme, whereof the Farmer or Lord of the soile may make any profit,
or else take any pleasure, my aduice and counsell is, that according
as the places and grounds may conueniently affoord, there bee parkes
made neere vnto the farme, therein to breed and keepe hares, wild goates, or fallow
deere, wild swine, and such other like wild beastes, to the end that the Lord and Master
of the place may now and then recreate himselfe therewith, and take his sport in
seeing the said wild beastes hunted; as also that if he bee disposed to make any great
feast or banket,The profit of the parke. he may therein be sure to find as in his kitching of larder house for to
make readie meate of, besides the benefit which the good husband may make yerely
thereof by selling of them.
                  The parke would be seated (if it be possible) within a wood of high and tall timber
trees,The situation of the parke. in a place compassed about, and well fenced with wals made of rough stone
and lime, or else of brickes and earth-lome, or else with pales made of oake plankes.
You must foresee that there bee some little brooke of spring-water running along
by the place, or for want of spring-water and naturall streames, you must prepare
ditches and pooles walled and daubed in such sort as that they may receiue and keepe
the raine-water.
                  Nor ought the parke to consist of one kind of ground only, as all wood, all grasse,
or all coppise, but of diuers, as part high wood, part grasse or champion, and part
coppise, or vnder-wood, or thicke spring: nor must these seuerall grounds lie open,
or as it were in common one with another; but they must be separated one from
the other by a strong rale, through which deere or sheepe (but no greater cattell)
may passe, for they must haue the full libertie of euery place: neither must the
parke be situated vpon any one entire hill, plaine, or else valley, but it must consist
of diuers hills, diuers plaines, and diuers valleyes: the hills which are commonly
called the viewes or discoueries of parkes would bee all goodly high woods of tall
timber, as well for the beautie and gracefulnesse of the parke, as also for the ecchoe
and sound which will rebound from the same, when in the times of hunting, either
the cries of the hounds, the winding of hornes, or the gibbetting of the huntsmen
passeth through the same, doubling the musicke, and making it tenne times more delightfull:
the plaines, which are called in parkes the launds, would be very champion
and fruitfull, as well for the breeding of great store of grasse and hay for the
feeding and nourishi
                        •
                     g of his deere or other wild beastes, as also for the pleasure of

coursing with grey-hounds, when at any time the owner shall be disposed to hunt in
that manner; for when the hounds shall haue hunted the game from the thicks vnto
the launds, then the grey-hounds being placed thereupon, may in the view of the
beholders course vpon the same, and beget a delight past equall. The valleyes which
are called the couerts or places of leare for wild beasts, would be all verie thicke
sprung or vnderwood, as well for the concealing of them from potchers and purloyners,
as for giuing them rest and shadow in the day time, who cannot indure to
lie open to the view of passengers, or vndefended by darkenesse and obscuritie:
also these thicke couerts are defences for the wild beastes to saue them from the cunning
sents or noses of hounds when they pursue them, making th
                        •
                     ir doubles and
windings therein so intricate and cunningly, that they scape many times their most
mortallest mischiefe: also in these thicke couerts, the hunted deere finding an vnhunted
deere where he lodgeth, will forthwith beate him vp and lie downe himselfe in
his place, making the hounds vndertake the fresh deere, and so escape his owne danger,
which in the open places he cannot doe: and the parke is a place that must containe
all things for the good and safetie of the game it keepeth. Thus you see the parke
must consist of view, laund, and couert, and the situation of 
                        •
                     ill valley, and plaine.
Now for the water of which formerly we spoake you shall know it is very right necessarie
in parkes, as well for the reliefe and sustenance of wild beasts, as for the watering,
washing, and moistning of the grounds to make them fruitfull. Besides whensoeuer
your gaine is extreamely hunted, and brought to the pinch of extremitie, then
he will flie to the water, which is called the soile, and there find reliefe and rescue:
for according to the saying of the profit Dauid, As the Hart desireth the water brooks
&amp;c. so a deere in his greatest extremitie findeth reliefe and is refreshed by drinking
or bathing in the water. For a bet
                        •
                     er proofe whereof, I will repeate vnto you a notable
true and very memorable experiment approued by a gentleman of good worship
and place in his countrie, who being a very good hunts-man, and very well experienced
in the nature of wild deare, It was his chaunce to bring vp a tame Stagge,
which by the excellencie of his keeping and full feeding, grew a verie faire and
great deere, as soone as the deere was three yeares old, hee caused him to be broke to
the saddle, and being himselfe a good horse-man, and hauing a good horse-man then
attending vpon him, what through the ones instruction and the others paine, the
Stagge became so well reclaimed, that not any gelding in his stable was more obedient
to the man, better mouthed, or more tractable to carrie his rider than the Stag
was; in so much that when at any time the gentleman went forth a coursing, or to
other pleasure, he would cause the Stagge to be ridden forth with him, also when he
traueild any smal iournie the Stagge also carried a man with him: but the rider of the
Stagge found that after hee had gone three or foure miles, the Stagge did 
                        •
                     uer faint
and grew wearie, which as soone as he imparted to his master, he presently commanded
him to ride the Stagge when he so fainted to the next water, and there cause
him to drinke, onely calling to mind the saying of Dauid before rehearsed, and he
found that so soone as the Stagge had drunke, hee was as fresh as at his first setting
forth, and by that obseruation onely could make the deere trauell twentie and fiue
and twentie miles a day without any trouble, by which it is most credibly found,
that not any thing can be more necessarie in a park than store of sweet &amp; cold water,
of which the riuer is best, the fountaine next, and the standing pond the worst, notwithstanding
the standing pond how euer it is the worst water, yet it is very commodious,
because in it you may breed all sorts of da

                     tie fresh fish, as the carp, bream,
pike, tench, and perch: also in them you may both feede and breede all manner of
wild foule, by framing little Islands in the middest of those lakes or ponds where the
swans, bussards, elkes, and other sma
                        •
                     l foule may frame their nests and lay their eggs
out of the daunger of the water. In the most conuenientest laund of the parke, which
is most spatious and fruitfull, and which hath the greatest prospect into the parke,
and where the deere take greatest delight to feed, there you shall build the lodge or
house for the Keeper to dwell in, and it shall by all meanes stand cleane, and open

euerie way, so as there may bee no secret approch made vnto the same, but such as the
Keeper may easily behold from his windowes: and it shall stand so faire in the view
of the laund, that from thence a man may see euery way round about the same, and
some part vp into the high woods, and other most secret parts of the parke, so that
when the least disturbance or troble is offered vn
                        •
                     o the deere, a man may from that
lodge take notice of the same: this house must bee made like vnto a little forcellet
or fort strong and with diuers angles, the windowes whereof so flanking one another,
that when any approach by stealers or other malitious persons shall bee made
to the same, the Keeper may from thence either with his bowes or with some other
engines so annoy them, that they shall by no meanes besiege or coope him vp in
his house, (which is the practise of many subtile knaues) but that hee may dispight
their force, issue forth and defend himselfe and his charge against them: if there
bee any part of the house which the windowes cannot flanker as the doores, iaumes,
or such like, then ouer them shall bee made little loopeholes, through which the
Keeper may either shoot, cast stones or scalding water to make them auoid from
the same: close by this lodge shall bee built the kennell for the Keepers hounds,
and the cocke-house where hee shall keepe his fighting cockes and hennes: also
without it shall bee made a place for him to hang the hornes which his deere shall
cast at the latter end of the Spring time: also in your parke as well at both the ends
of your laund which are the next adioining to the couert, as in all other suspitious
places where any man may in the night, course your deere, you shall place long
stickes or slaues which are foure or fiue foot in length, and two or three inches in
compa
                        ••
                     e, with both the ends sharpned exceeding sharpe, and stuck sloapewise
into the ground, and standing not aboue a foot and a halfe or two foot aboue the
the ground at most, and these you shall set crossewise very thicke, that when a stealer
shall come to course in the night, his grey▪ hound may run and goar
                        •
                      himselfe
against the same: you shall also by no meanes alongst your pale walke plant fruit
trees, blacke-thorne, or bullies, for they are the occasion of much hurt and destruction
to your pale, vnder the colour of gathering the fruit, and breed a great decay to
your quickset, besides many other mischiefes which are excussed by the pretence
of getting that fruit onely: yet would I not haue the parke vnfurnished of all
manner of fruit, for besides the pleasure thereof, they are an excellent mast in which
deere infinitly delight, and are 
                        •
                     ed very much with the same. You shall not by
any meanes in one parke mixe the red deere and the fallow deere together, for the
red deere is a masterfull beast, and when the time of bellowing commeth, he growes
fierce and outragious, so that hee will be entire Lord of the field, and will kill the
fallow deere if they but crosse him in his walke: and therefore each must bee kept
seuerally in seuerall parkes.
                  Againe Cranes, Ra
                        •
                     ens, and wild-geese are excellent things to be nourished in
a parke, and will stand in steed of Keepers vnto the same: for in the night time, if any
thing stir about the ground to which they are not continually accustomed, they will
with their clamours and noise not only giue warning to the Keeper, but any that shall
dwell neare to the ground, not ceasing their noise till the ground be at peace and rest
againe.
                  It is meet also that there should bee great store of grasse ground in the place,Prouision of

trees bearing fruit: amongst all other trees there is speciall account made of acornes,
wild apples, wild peares, strawberrie trees, &amp; other such like, for the feeding of these
wild beasts. Notwithstanding the good farmer must not content himselfe with the
prouision which the ground bringeth forth of it selfe: but at such times as the earth
is barren, and when there is nothing to 
                        •
                     eed vpon in the forests, they must haue giuen
vnto them of the haruest fruits, and be fed with barley, pure wheat, beanes, the dros

                  And to the end that these wild cattell may the better know that there is such prouision
of meate for them, there must bee amongst them some tame ones, and such as
haue beene trained vp in the house, for they will follow any whither, and draw the

other after them, and so bring them to the place of prouision for their feeding. And
this order must not onely bee obserued in Winter, but also when they be great with
young, and when they haue calued, that so they may feed them the better. And to that
end there must regard be had to see when they haue fauned, that there may be corne
giuen them.
                  The wild bore would not be let grow elder than the age of foure yeares, for hee
groweth vnto this time, but afterward paireth and becommeth leane by reason of
old age: wherefore it is meete that hee should bee sold whiles he is in his beautie and
prime.
                  A Stag may be kept a long time, for he is young a great time, and liueth a great
while.
                  But as concerning small beasts, as hares, they must not be put in a parke fenced only
with postes and pales: for seeing they are small, they will easily passe through the
gaping and open spaces, and hauing got through, run away: Their parkes therefore
must be walled about, and their feeding of fourage or mas

peacockes, turkeies, phesants, and small hens, and haue said that it is a curious
and difficult thing to breed and bring them vp: and we may say
as much or more of the herne, which is called of the Latins Ardea, as
a man would say Ardua, because he is giuen to flie on high: for there is nothing but
charges in this bird, without any profit. True it is that princes and great states, which

come by without double costes. Let vs then put case and admit that the Lord and
Master of the farme bee a Prince or great Lord, and that hee beareth a verie good
will to all manner of game, and to fare daintily, then hee may so prouide, as that
he may now and then haue some sport and pastime with the Herne, either in taking
or eating of the same: wherefore it shall not bee a misse if we speake a word or two
of the Heronrie, to the end we may not let slip and ouerpasse any thing in generall of
all that which may be necessarie for the beautifying and perfecting of our farme and
countrie house.

                        ronrie. being if you
meane to haue it, not onely for pleasure but also for profit vnto the Lord thereof,
you must first consider that the herne is but a guest for a time, affecting solitarinesse,
and very fantasticall, as not giuen to stay in any place, but such as pleaseth him verie
well: and for that cause it is not to be taken as an indifferent thing to place or bestow
their prouision for their nesting and abode in any place but onely where it is coniectured,
that in passing along, they haue begun to rest &amp; settle themselues, as in a place
that is most pleasant and delightsome to them.Two things giuing occasion to make choise of some certaine place for a heronrie. For the Heronrie must in prouiding
be two manner of waies considered of: as first there must consideration be
had of their food and nourishment, that so when it shall please the Lord of the
farme to hauke the herne, or to make any great and costly banket, he may haue them

readie at his commaundement. And secondly to allure and draw herons as they flie
along: for the herne that is shut and made fast in a heronrie, calleth vnto him such as
flie by; for they hearing the voice of the hernshew so shut vp and made fast, do thervpon
stay and make their nests vpon the vppermost and higest part of the heronrie,
whereupon it commeth, that hauing laid their egges, by and by their young ones are
taken to be shut vp and made fast in the heronrie.
                  Let vs conclude then, that before there be any cost made in building a place for
the heronshewes to build in, there must diligent care bee had in discerning of the
commodiousnesse and fitnesse of the place, and that is gathered by hauing knowne
the herne now and then to haue contented and pleased himselfe therewith: for if a
man should go about to shut vp a herne in such place as he taketh no delight in, hee
would neuer haue young, but die out of hand. Furthermore, it is requisite that there
should passe some small streame of water through the middest of the heronrie, for
the heronshew is a water bird, &amp; taketh delight and pleasure in water, as liuing altogether
vpon eeles, and other such like liuing fishes. The building of the heronrie must
bee made altogether for light, wrought with verie close latises and clouen plan

herne out of the heronrie to make him sport by flying him with the hauke, that then

               Of Hunting.
               
                  CHAP. XXI.
                  How that there are three sorts of hunting.
                  
                     FOllowing our purposed determination, we will intreat a word or two of
hunting, not that wee would wish our farmer otherwise to affect the
game, than by making it sometimes his recreation, and that in the time
of vacation, and surcease from his other businesses, as when hee should
do nothing but sleepe, or keepe holiday at home.
                  Now there are three sorts of hunting, the one of fishes, the other of 
                        •
                     oules, and the
third of foure footed beastes, as are the Stagge, roe Bucke, fallow Deere, wild Bore
and Hare. In all these the Lord of the countrie farme may find occasion to exercise
himselfe, but especially in the hunting of the foure footed beastes▪ for fishing is
more fit for the farmers seruants, as those whom it best beseemeth to busie their

braines on vacant and festiuall daies, with catching fish with the angle or pots made
of osiers, that so they may haue any extraor dinarie fare for their afternoon drinking
or supper. The catching of birds is very prettie and pleasant, but yet if we will beleeue
Plato, a practise more fitting a seruile estate than a Gouernor or Commander.

times, and permitted by the lawes, especially that which was not vndertaken in the

obtaining of a greater readinesse, nimblenesse, cheerfulnesse, and strength of bodie:
but howsoeuer it is, the master of our countrie farme, especially if he be any great
lord, may exercise himselfe sometimes, and take some sport in hunting after hee hath
giuen order and direction for the doing of all his businesse, aswell in the citie, as at
his champion or countrie house.
               
            
            
               Of hunting or chasing of the Stag.
               
                  CHAP. XXII.
                  What dogs are best for the course or hunting.
                  
                     THe hunting of foure footed beastes, as the stag, wild bore, the roe bucke,
and the hare, is performed principally with dogs, horses, and strength
of bodie, sometimes with ropes and nets, and sometimes with toiles:
but these two sorts of taking of beasts are more fit for holiday men,
milke sops, and cowards, than for men of valour, which delight more in the taking of
such beastes, in respect of the exercise of their bodie and pleasure, than for the filling
of the bellie.
                  Those dogges which are sit for the chace or for hunting, are most generally
but of two kinds, yet particularly of diuers. The two generall sorts of dogges,
are those which are called Grey-hounds, or Hounds:Grey-hounds and Hounds. Grey-hounds are those which
belong to the leash, and are onely for the coursing of all sorts of wilde beastes by
maine swiftnesse of foot, or by running: they doe not any thing more than their eies
gouerne them vnto, being led by a naturall instinct or hatred which they beare to
all sorts of wild beasts, Hounds are those which by vertue of their scents, smells,
or noses do find out all manner of wild beastes, following their footsteps by a leasurely
and moderate speede, not suffering the beast to rest till they haue tired him,
and made themselues Lords of the the pray: all that they doe, is as it were blindfold,
their eies seldome or neuer seeing the game till they come to deuoure it:
and as the Grey-hound through his extreame swiftnesse and running, sheweth the
greedie delight which hee taketh in the sport, without once opening his mouth or
making the least signe of any noise, but being as it were dumbe and mute; so the
hound taking a greater leasure, sheweth the delight and pleasure which hee taketh
in the game, by his continual clamours or opening, spending his mouth in such liberall
sort, that he makes the woods, valleys, and hills resound the eccho or doublings
of his voice; and it is amongst hunts-men taken for a most excellent musicke: yet
this crie of hounds or opening of their mouthes, is in no sort allowed to the liam
hound, so long as he draweth in the string, all which time hee must be exceeding silent,
and mute like vnto the grey-hound, as well for the discouerie of the game, or
footsteps whatsoeuer hee draweth after, as to hinder all preuentions that the aduersarie
may seeke when hee hath a warning giuen him by such clamours, for this
drawing in the string, is the most sweetest discouerie of all other, and must bee
done with the greatest diligence and priuacie. Now to speake of grey-hounds▪ first
they are of all dogs whatsoeuer the most noble and princely, strong, nimble, swift,
and valient, and though of slender and verie fine proportions, yet so well knit and

coupled together, and so seconded with spirit and mettall, that they are master of all
other dogs whatsoeuer: nay, it is most certain, that the perfect and true Grey-hound
will euen face to face and tooth to tooth conquer the strongest and fiercest mastiue
whatsoeuer: they are of all dogs the sorest bitten and least amased with any crueltie
in their enemie, whence it comes that men esteeme them and prefer them before all
other dogs for the encountring of the woolfe, and other beastes of his equall cruelty.
Now of these Grey-hounds,Two sorts of Grey-hounds. their bee two kinds, the long shag-haired, and great
boned Grey-hound▪ and the smooth, slender and sine shapt Grey-hound. Now some
will adde a third sort which is indifferently mixt betweene both: but in as much as

which is the 
                        •
                     hag-haired dog, is held most proper for vermine or wild beasts which
are rauenous, as the Tyger, the Leopard, Woolfe, Foxe, and such like: the other
which is smooth and more delicately proportioned, are best for wild beastes of pleasure,
as the Stag, the Bucke, the Roe▪ the Hare, and such like. These Grey-hounds
are of diuers colours, as some white, some blacke, some fallow, some dun, some brended
and some p

                     ed, as hauing white mixt with any of the former colours: and these
colours haue (as touching any particular goodnesse) no preheminence one aboue
another, but are all equall, Many good a

                     ndure labour, and the dunne and brended best for
potchers and night-men, who deligh to haue all their pleasures performed in darkenesse.
Now for the choice of a good Grey-hound,
                        
                           〈…〉
                        
                      there are but two principall things
to be obserued, that is to s

ex ellent dog, or an exc
                        •
                     llent bitch, there can be little hope of his goodnesse. Now
in the breeding of Grey-hounds, there are diuersities of opinions, for some gentlement
of the leash d
                        •
                     sire a 
                        •
                     ost principall bitch, though the dog be but indifferent,
and suppose that so they shall haue the best whelps, supposing (according to an old
coniecture) that a bitch is swifter than a dogge; but it is an erronious fancie, for the
good dogge will euer beate the good bitch, and the good bitch will euer beate the
bad dogge: againe it is most certaine, that the dogge hauing aduantage both of
length, strength, and courage, hee must consequently haue the aduantage of speed
also. I doe not denie but that the bitch being much lesse than the dogge, (as naturally
all are) may haue some aduantage of nimblenesse, and so in turnes, slips, and
wries, may get much ground which the dogge commonly looseth: but yet notwithstanding,
when the full account is cast, the good dogge will equall all those
aduantages, and wheresoeuer the course shall stand forth long will beat out the good
bitch and make her giue ouer.
                  There be other gentlemen of the leash, which desire a good dog, and respect not
though the bitch be but indifferent, and this is the better choice, yet both defectiue;
for where there is any imperfection at all, there nature can neuer be fully compleate.
To breed then a good whelpe indeed,To breed a good w
                           ••
                        lpe. you must be sure to haue both a perfect good
dogge and a perfect good bitch, and as neere as you can make choice of that bitch
which is most large and deepest chested, for from thence springeth both strength
and wind. For the true shape of a good grey-hound, because it is the very face and
charracter of goodnesse, you shall esteeme that dog which hath a fine, long, leane
snakes head, with a cleere bright eie, and wide nostrells, a round bending necke like
a mollard, with a loose thropple, and a full falling at the setting on of the shoulders,
he must haue a long, broad, and a square beame backe, with high round 
                        •
                     illets, and a
broad space, hee must bee deepe swine sided, with hollow bended ribs, and a full
brest, he mast haue rush growne limbes before, and 
                        •
                     ickell houghes behind, a fine,
round, full cats foot, with strong cleyes and tough soles, and an euen growne long
rats taile, round turning at the lower end from the leash ward, and hee must bee
full set on betweene the buttockes, and lastly hee must haue a very long, slender

close hid pizell, and a round big paire of stones. The food which is best for grey-hounds,
as touching their diet, is chippings or houshold bread scalded in beefe broth
or other broth that is not too salt, and after made white with milke, or else the bones
of veale which are verie soft and tender, or the bones of lambe, rabits, or other
scraps comming from the Farmers table. In the time of coursing, or at other times,
if your grey-hound be leane or out of heart, the best mea
                        •
                     e to raise him is sheepes
heads boiled wooll and all in water together with oatemeale and synage, succorie,
langdebeefe, and violet leaues chopt verie small together, and so boiled to pottage,
vntill the flesh fall from the bones. The best food when a dog is in diet for a course,
is to make him bread of wheate-meale and oate-meale mixt together, and finely
bolted and knodden with a little water, whites of egges, barme, licoras, and anyseeds,
and so bakt in good houshold loaues, and giuen morning and night with
new milke or pottage which are warme. If the dogge at any time grow costiue,
you shall giue him tostes which are made of the same bread, or of manchets, and
steept in sallet oile. Grey-hounds when they are for the course, must bee walkt
forth and ayred both morning and euening exceeding earely, as before day in the
morning, and ver
                        •
                     e late, as about seuen or eight of the clocke at night: and when
you bring your grey-hound home at night, you shall bring him to a faire 
                        •
                     ire, and
there let him beake and stretch himselfe, and doe you ticke him at the least an houre
or more before you put him into his kennell. You must haue a very great and diligent
care that when you course him hee bee exceeding emptie, as at least of twelue
houres fasting more than for some small sop or bit or two onely to cherish or strengthen
Nature. A brace of grey-hounds are enough at one time to course either Hare
or Bucke withall, and two brace are sufficient to course the Stagge or Hind. Much
more might bee said of the natures of grey-hounds, and the manner of ordering
and dietting them for the course, but this small taste is sufficient both for the farmers
vnderstanding, and to auoid tediousnesse. Now for the hounds whose natures
I haue alreadie in patt discribed, and which hunt in great numbers, or as it were

hound.
                  The white are the best, for they are of quicke scent, swift, hot, and such as neuer

any other sorts of dogs, &amp; are more to be trusted: notwithstanding they loue to be attended
with horsemen, and they do feare the water somewhat, especially in Winter
when the weather is cold. Those which are altogether white are the best, and likewise
those which are red spotted. The other which are blacke and dirtie, gray spotted,
drawing neere vnto a changeable colour, are but of small value, and whereof there
are some subiect to haue fat and tender feet.

almost of the nature of the white ones, saue onely that they doe not indure the
heate so well, neither yet the treadings of the horsemen, and yet notwithstanding
they bee more swift and hot, and feare neither cold nor water: they runne surely,
and with great boldnesse, commonly louing the Stagge more than any other beast,
but they make no account of hares. It is true, that they be more head-strong and
hard to reclaime than the white, and put men to more paine and trauell about the
same. The best of the fallow sort of dogges, are those which are of a brighter haire,
drawing neere vnto the colour of red, and hauing therewithall a white spot in the
forehead, or in the necke, in like manner those which are all fallow: but such as incline
to a light yellow colour, being graie or blacke spotted, are nothing worth: such

hunt, but they are not so swift nor lustie as the others, especially such as haue their legs
of a bay or fallow colour, drawing somewhat vnto a white: and yet notwithstanding
they are hot and stout, not learing water of cold, running with great courage,
and neuer giuing ouer the game till they haue killed: but indeed they auoid
and shun heat, the footing of horses, and the noise of men, neither do they delight in
the hunting of any beastes that are giuen to wiles and crosse windings: but in recompence
hereof, it is possible that you may see them to ouer run the most swift and best
dogs, especially after beastes that vse to run out right.

But whereas it is commonly giuen out and reported, that their are good
dogs of euerie shape, it may bee so brought to passe, as that the hare may not make
much for the arguing of the goodnesse of the dogge, and that there are found of
all colours good and faire dogges: for this cause it is both meere and requisite that
a dogge (of what haire or colour soeuer hee be) to the end hee may be faire and
good,The mar

rather long than flat nosed, his nostrells very wide and great, his eares large,
and of a meane thickenesse, his backe crooked in compasse wise, his loynes great
and thicke, his lippes thicke and large, his thigh round and trussed, his houghs
straight and well set together, his taile thicke neere vnto his backe, and the rest of
it small and leane euen to the end, the haire vnder his bellie stiffe, his legs great, the
sole of his foot drie, and shaped like vnto the foot of a Fox, his nailes thicke, his hinder
parts as high as his sore parts. The male kind must be short and crooked: but the
bitch or female long.
                  The signification and meaning of these signes is such:The reason of these markes of a good hunting dog. his wide nostrels do argue
his quicke scent: his vaulted backe and straight hams do argue his swiftnes: his taile
thicke aboue, and slender downe to the end, both signifie that he hath a strong back,
and wind at will: the stiffenesse of his haire vnderneath his bellie doth shew that he
is willing &amp; painfull, fearing neither water nor cold: his thick leg, fox foot, and thick
nailes, doth signifie that he hath no sat or gouty foot, and that he hath strong limbs,
to run long without griefe or annoiance.
                  But for as much as it is hard to get such hunting dogs when one would, as are both
good hunters and faire withall, it will be requisite to prouide a faire bitch of a good
race, strong, and of wel proportioned limbs, hauing great and large sides and flanks:
and to procure her to be limed with a faire dog, hauing the markes that we haue spoken
of before, and that at such time onely (if it be possible) as when the Moone is
in the signes of Gemini and Aquariys, for the dogs that are gotten at such times are
not so subiect to run mad, and besides, there will be of them moe dogs than bitches.
When the bitch is with whelpe, and beginneth to haue a bagging bellie, she may not
be set to course, least her young ones should bee kept from euer thriuing: her walke
then must not be past the court or house, neuer shutting her vp in any kennell, because
she is wearisome, and giuen to loath all meat. When she hath whelped (the fittest
time for which is in March, Aprill, and May, rather than either in Winter, or
in the time of great heat) and that the whelpes begin to see, they must bee

they be taken from sucking the bitch, till they be two moneths old, and then feeding
them with milke meats, bread, and all sorts of pottage, till they be ten moneths old,
and all this while thus to keepe them in the kennell.

together, they become the better acquainted, and agree better in hunting than those
that are of diuers kennels and places.
                  Their meat shall be bread made of a third part of wheate,The feeding and keeping of hunting dogs. a third part of barley,
and a third part of rie, because that being so mixt it keepeth them faire and fat, and
cureth them of many maladies: for and if it should be made of rie onely, it would
make them scoure too much: if of pure wheat, it would bind too much in their bellies,
and therefore the one mixt with the other. There must bee giuen them some
flesh meate in Winter,Flesh-meate. but especially vnto those that are leane, and hunt the stag:
but to those that hunt the hare you must neuer giue any, least they sleshing themselues
vpon the greater game, they make light account of hares, which thrust themselues

                     ▪ to shift off the dogges by that
meanes, who vpon such occasion might leaue off the hare, and fall to course the
tame cattell: but the dogs which hunt the hart would neuer do it, because the stag is
of a more full and strong scent than the hare, as also because their flesh is more daintie
and delicate than any other. The best flesh meat that can bee giuen them, and
which doth strengthen them most, is horse-flesh, asse-flesh, and mules-flesh: but as
for oxen, kine, and other such like, their flesh is to them of too eager and sharpe a
substance. Their flesh meate must first haue their hide pluckt off, that so they may not
haue any knowledge of the beast, nor of his haire. Good huntsmen make great account
of pottage made of mutton, goates flesh, and oxe heads for their leane dogs,

eate it all at a meale, you shall preserue it in some cleare running streame by suffering
it to lie hid in the water till your next occasion to vse it. Oates ground hulls and all,
and so scalded in hot water, is a very good mange or meate for hounds, and so is also
your mill-dust scalded in the same manner. But if your hounds happen to fall
weake, or sicke, or bee ouer hunted, then you shall take the bagges and intrailes of

                  Yet because there is one other sort of hunting dogs, which although they are for
birds and not for wild beasts, yet in their kinds they are as noble and as generous as
any other dogs whatsoeuer, and as much in vse amongst great persons, and these dogs
are called field or land spannels, of which sith before no Auther hath fully intreated:
I will here giue you a little touch or tast of the nature, disposition, and manner of go

them. To speake then of the land spannell, you shall vnderstand, that he is
be nature very gentle, courteous, and louing to the man more than any other sort of
dogs whatsoeuer: they also naturally loue to hunt the wing of any bird whatsoeuer,
especially partridge, pheasant, quaile, raile, poots, and such like: when you make
choice of any spannell, you shall chuse him by his shape, beautie, mettall, and cunning
hunting, his shape is descerned in the good composition of his bodie, as when
he hath a round thicke head, a short nose, a long, well compast and hairie eare, broad
and sydelips, a cleere red eie, a thicke neck, broad breast, short and well knit ioints,
round feete, strong cleys, high dewcleyd, good round ribs, a gaunt bellie, a short
broad backe, a thicke bushie and long haired taile, and all his bodie generally long
and well haired: his beautie is discerned in his colour, of which the motleys or pide
are the best, whether they bee blacke and white, red and white, or liuer hued and
white; for to be all of one entire colour, as all white, or all bladke, or all red, or all
liuer hued without any other spot, is not so comely in the field, although the dogs notwithstanding
may be of excellent cunning: his mettall is discerned in his free and
vntired laboursome raunging, beating a field ouer and ouer, and not leauing a furrow
vntrodden or vnsearcht where any haunt is likely to bee hidden, and when hee
doth it most coragiously and swiftly, with a wanton playing taile, and a busie labouring
nose, neither desisting or shewing lesse delight in his labour at night than he did
in the morning; and his cunning hunting is discerned by his casting about heedfully,
and running into the wind of the pray he seeketh, by his stilnesse and quietnesse in
hunting without babling or barking, but when hee is vpon an assured and certaine
haunt, by the manner of his raunging, as when hee compasseth a whole field about
at the first, and after lesneth and lesneth that circumference till he haue trodden euery
path, and brought the whole circuit to one point; and by his more temperate and
leasurely hunting, when he comes to the first scent of the game, sticking vpon it, and
pricking it out by degrees, not opening or questing by any meanes, but whimpring
and whining to giue his master a warning of what he scenteth, and to prepare
himselfe and his hauke for the pleasure hee seeketh, and when he is assured of his
game, then to quest out loudly and freely. Now it is to be vnderstood, that it is hard
to haue one spannell to be absolute cunning in all the qualities of hunting, as to be an
excellent raunger, an excellent finder, and an excellent retainer, because one qualitie
is almost in nature cleere contrarie to another; for he that is a good and free raunger
can neuer be confined or bound into one particular small compasse, but will out of
his owne mettall breake forth into much larger compasse, and so both lose time in
hunting, and also giue the game more leasure to get breath, or fleit away priuatly
from the place where it was markt, and so deceiue the hauke of her expectation, and
in like sort a good retainer which will sticke vpon the place whereto he is oppointed

and will beat it ouer and ouer many times, euen as it were by inchmeale, neuer leauing
till he haue sprung the game he seeketh, can neuer bee esteemed for a good raunger,
because the leasure he taketh will not giue him leaue to rid much ground, and so likewise
of all other seuerall qualities: therefore euery man must esteeme his spannyel for
the one good qualitie he holdeth, and cannot for diuers, and so mixing his kennell of
good raungers, good noses, and retainers, he shall bee sure to attaine to the vttermost
height of his pleasure he wisheth. There bee some spannels which delight in
the plaine and open field, and those are the best for the partridge, quaile, or raile:
there be othe others which delight in woods, hedges, bushes, and couerts, and those
are best for the pheasant and moore poo
                        •
                     , and these are commonly the best retainers,
and the former the best raungers.
                  There is also another sort of land spannyels, which are called Setters, and they diffor
nothing from the former, but in instruction or obedience; for these must neither
hunt, raunge, nor retaine more or lesse than as the master appointeth, taking the
whole limits of whatsoeuer they doe from the eie or hand of their instructer: they
must neuer at any time quest what occasion soeuer shall happen, but as being dogs
without voices, so they must hunt close and mute, and when they come vpon the
haunt of that they hunt: they shall sodainly stop and fall downe vpon their bellies,
and so leasurely creepe by degrees to the game, till they come within two or three
yards thereof, or so neere that they cannot presse neerer without daunger of retriuing,
then shall your Setter 
                        ••
                     icke, and by no persuasion go further, till your selfe come
in and vse your pleasure. Now the dogs which are to be made for this pleasure, should
be the most principall best and lustiest spannyell you can get, both of good scent and
good courage, yet young, and as little as may bee made acquanted with much hunting:
the way to traine him to his knowledge, is by all louing meanes, or else awfull
where loue taketh not effect, as by fasting, threatnings, and some stripes to make him
both feare and loue you far aboue all other persons, and to that end you shall suffer
him to receiue no good thing from any man but your selfe onely: when you haue
made him thus enamoured of you, you shall (as men teach hounds to couch with
bits and blowes) teach him to couch downe close vpon his bellie when you please,
by saying Lie close, or such like word: for you are to vnderstand, that in this excercise,
the principall thing which is to be respected, is constancie of words, that is by
no meanes to vse many words, or change of words, for that breeds a confusion in the
dogs braines, and makes them that they cannot vnderstand you, and where vnderstanding
is taken away, there neuer looke to haue your will performed: therefore
you shall neuer vse but one word for incouragement or cherrishing, as hay good dog,
or such like, but one word for aduice or threatning, as Be wise, or such like, one word
for performance of duetie, as Lie close, and one word for the bettering of his duetie,
as Goe neere, and such like, and so forth for the performance of any other thing whatsoeuer.
Yet I do not bind you to these words only &amp; none other, but to inuent words,
so they intend to this sence, as you please, and hauing made choice of your words,
not by any meanes to alter or change them, but to vse your dog constantly to them
that he may truely vnderstand when he is cherisht, when chid, when taught, when
forewarned or aduised: for the whole art of making these setting dogs, consisteth in
these words onely, for if one word being vsed, that word knowne, any man may
hunt with the dog as well as his master, and so euery knaue greedie to steale him:
but hauing libertie to make choice of your owne words, except you teach them, a
man shall be neuer the better for hauing of the dog. To proceed then to our purpose,
assoone as you haue taught your dog to lie close vpon his bell
                        •
                     e, you shall then make
him creepe vnto you vpon his bellie, by leasurable and slow degrees, saying vnto
him go neere go neere or such like, and euer obseruing in that as in all things else, to
cherrish and reward him when he doth well, and to threaten or correct him when he
doth amisse: and in this matter of correction, you must also be certaine, as in your
words, and not vse diuers corrections, but one, as either to bite him or nip him by the
care root, or other sencible part, where you may paine him, but not hurt or lame him.

When your dogge will couch and creepe vpon his bellie, to make him the better
delight in doing it, you shall lay a piece of bread three or foure yards before him,How to teach a Spaniell to

and then make him couch downe and creepe close vpon his bellie vnto it, and being
come with his nose iust ouer it, not to take it till you giue him leaue: vvhich obedience
when he hath shewed, you may then giue him leaue to eat it, and cherish
him. When the dogge is verie perfect in this lesson, which is but only to bring him
to obedience, and to the true manner of carriage and concealement of his bodie,
you shall then take him abroad into the field, and giue him leaue to raunge, yet in
such manner, that he got not an ynch further than you giue him leaue, but with the
least hemme or threatening of your voice to be readie to come euen to your foot, although
he be neuer so earnest vpon his game: the contrarie vvhereof, vvhen at any
time hee sheweth, you shall not forget, but in the verie selfe-same instant beat and
correct him verie soundly. Now when you haue brought him vnto that obedience,
that he will raunge according to your pleasure either in large or little compasse,
you shall then take care, that not at any time, or vpon any occasion whatsoeuer,
that he dare to quest or open his mouth, but that he hunt so silent and mute as
is possible: and if at any time hee offer to quest, though neuer so little, presently you
must not forbeare, but correct him, till he come to an vnderstanding of your vvill
therein: and when he vnderstandeth your vvill, yet notwithstanding doth quest,
you shall not onely beat him, but lead him home, and tie him vp from meat till the
next day, not ceasing to hunger-starue him, till hee doe performe your pleasure:
vvhich done, then reward him liberally both with good meat and with plentie:
vvhich the dogge once finding, hee will both for feare, loue, and the reliefe of his
owne bellie, labour his vtmost to please you. Now as soone as you find your dogge
is brought both vnto obedience and mute hunting, you shall then, as soone as you
find him busie vpon any haunt, which you shall note by the businesse of his taile,
and sticking long in one place, with a kind of secret whining, to shew that he is neere
to that which he desireth: forthwith you shall draw neere vnto him, and giue him
words both of encouragement and aduice, saying, Hay good dog, goe neere, or such
like: and if you find him too busie or hastie, you shall threaten and bid him be wise,
and such like, till you see him lie close vpon his bellie, and that he dare not goe any
further: then you shall fetch a large compasse round about the place where the dog
lieth, and cast your eie diligently into the couert to see whether you can find out the
game, which as soone as you haue done, if you find that the dog hath set too far
off, that is twentie or thirtie yards short, as timerousnesse and fearefulnesse will make
a young dogge many times doe: then you shall incourage him and make him goe
somewhat neerer, but if hee set within the compasse of three or foure yards, then
you shall make him lie still, vntill such time as either your hauke bee at her pitch, or
your nets bee spread, and then your selfe shall goe or ride into the couert and spring
them, and the game being taken, you shall not forget to reward your dogge. Now
if during this maine action of setting, which is after the dog hath first stucke and
giuen you warning of the game, if hee shall vpon any occasion whatsoeuer, either
by haste, negligence, or the frenzie of his owne desire, or otherwise by a too open
carriage of his bodie doe spring the game before you bee readie for it, you shall instantly
correct him foundly, and also tie him vp that night without any meate,
keeping him so fearefully in awe of the game, that if at any time he shall, either
by too hastie raunging, or anie other vnexpected chaunce, happen vpon the
game vnawares, yet shall his feare so gouerne him, that hee shall vpon the verie
instant sight of his error not onely stoppe suddainely, but also cast himselfe
toppe ouer tayle backward, rather than by pressing forward an ynch endanger
the springing of the game. Which vvhen at any time you perce
                        •
                     ue him to doe,
you shall then immediately cherish him, notwithstanding the losse of your
game at that instant, in as much as therein hee shewed a vvillingnesse to haue
done the contrarie vpon any occasion, if mischance had not beene his hinderance.

Now for the food vvhich is best for spanyels, it is that vvhich is before prescribed
for greyhounds, as chippings, bones, and broken crusts of bread, scalded in vvater
and milke, or the heads, plucks, and entrailes of sheepe, boyled with oatmeale: yet
the setting spanyell vvould for the most part be fedde from the trencher vvith scraps
of meat, bones, bread, and such like: for by reason that he must be kept much fasting,
since he cannot hunt but vvhen he is exceeding emptie, it is verie fit that he be
kept vvith as good as nourishing meat as can be gotten. Now to conclude this
discourse of hunting dogges, you shall vnderstand, that there is one other sort of
spanyels, and they be called vvater-spanyels, because they delight onely naturally
in the vvater, and are imployed for the hunting of Duckes, Mallards, and all sorts
of vvater-fowle: they are much larger and bigger bodied than the land-spanyels
are, and a great deale more strong and Lyon-like made: their haire is also verie
long, rough, and thicke curled, vvhich sheweth their hard constitution and abilitie
to endure the vvater, albeit the vveather be neuer so fiercely and bitterly cold. They
receiue all their vertues from nature, and not from instruction: and therefore to
make any large discourse of them, vvere fri
                        •
                     olous: onely, for as much as they are
verie necessarie to attend the fowler, for the fetching of his fowle out of the vvater,
vvhen they are either lymed or strucken vvith the piece, it is meet that they be
brought to great obedience, that is to say, to fetch, carrie, runne, couch, and creepe,
vvhensoeuer a man pleaseth, least otherwise, out of the franticknesse of their owne
natures, they scarre away the game vvhilest the fowler is the most busily imployed.
These dogges are lesse tender than any of the other, and therefore any meat vvill
serue them: neither would they be vsed to any nicenesse, because their most imployment
is in the Winter season. And thus much touching hunting dogges and their
gouernments.

                  How young hounds are to be trained vp and made
fit for the game.

                     gh to haue a number of good and faire dogges, vvell marked
vvith markes, declaring both the said qualities, for they must ouer
and aboue be taught and trained vp for the game. Wherefore the huntsman
must first bring them to vnderstand the sound of the horne, to swim
and haunt the vvater, that so they may be the more readie and forward to pursue
the beast, if so be that he should seeke to saue himselfe by any running riuer or standing
lake. Hee must lead them also once a weeke into the fields, but not before the
age of sixteene or eighteene moneths, for before such age they are not throughly
growne and well knit in all their members. But especially hee must well aduise to
what kind of game he is purposed to vse them, as vvhether to course the Hart, or the
Hinde, the wild Bore, or the Hare: for looke vvhat beasts you first runne them at,
those will they best remember alwaies, especially if there be care had to looke any
thing well vnto them.
                  You must not course with them in the morning, if possibly you can auoid it: for
hauing beene accustomed to the coolenesse of the morning, and comming afterward
to the height of the day, and feeling therein the heat of the Sunne, they will not runne
any more.
                  You must not put on young dogges the first time within a toile, because the beast
running altogether round, and therefore alwaies in the sight of the dogges, so when
afterwards they should be brought to runne out of the toile, and by that meanes become

cast any great distance behind the beast, it would be the cause of their giuing
ouer and forsaking of the game.
                  It shall be for the better (to the end they may be the better trained and fitted) to
put all the young ones together with foure or fiue old ones, at such time as you purpose
to hunt with them. Neither shall you compell your young hounds to make
more hast than their owne natures leads them vnto, but encouraging them to trust
to their owne noses, let them take what leysure they please, and picke out the sent of
themselues, that comming truely to vnderstand what they hunt, they may be mo

perfect and readie in the same: vvhereas on the contrarie part, being compelled
to hunt vp close with the older and swifter hounds, they hunt (as it were) by rote,
catching the sent here and there, and goe away with it both vncertainely and ignorantly,
and so seldome or neuer prooue sta

                     che or good hounds. It is also verie
meete to enter all young hounds at the Hare first, because it is the sweetest and coolest
of all sents vvhatsoeuer, and the hound which will hunt it, must necessarily hunt
any other hoter sent vvith much more violence: for it is a rule, That vvhosoeuer
can doe the hardest things, must forcibly doe things easier with lesse difficultie.
Therefore first enter your hound (as before is said) at the Hare, least finding a
sweetnesse and easinesse of hunting in the hoter sents, hee neuer after lay his nose
to the cooler.

                  How that the Hart and the place where he haunteth and vseth
to lie, would be knowne before yee course
or hunt him.
                  
                     KIngs, Princes,Hunting is for great states. and great Lords (to whom, and no others, belongeth the
coursing of the Hart) haue not vsed to course the Hart, before they haue
learned of their hunts-man vvhat manner of Hart he is, young or old,
and whether he be a faire and great one, and such a one as deserueth to
be coursed, and then afterward where his haunt and lodging is.
                  The hunts-man shall know the age and fairenesse of the Hart in respect of others,The marks of distinction betwixt Hart and Hart, as also of their ago.
by iudgement of the forme of his foot, the largenesse of his tines, his dung, gate, beatings,
breakings, and rubbings.
                  The sole of the foot being great and large, the heele also being thicke and large,
the little cleft which is in the middest of the foot, being large and open, a large
legge, a thick bone, being also short, but nothing sharpe, and the tippes of his clawes
round and thicke, are signes of an old Hart. The elder Harts in their gate doe neuer
ouer-reach the former foot with the hinder, for they tread short of it at the least
foure 
                        •
                     ingers: but it is not so in young Harts, for they in their gate doe ouer-reach and
set the hinder foot more forward than the fore-foot, after the manner of the ambling
Mule.The Hinde. The Hinde hath commonly a long foot, narrow, and hollow, with small cutting
bones.
                  The excrement and dung of Harts is not alike at all times: for some is printed,
othersome vvrythen round, and othersome flat and broad: and if it be large, grosse,
and thicke, it is a signe that they are Harts of tenne tynes, that is to say, such 
                        〈◊〉
                      haue
shot tenne small hornes out of the stocke. In Iune and Iuly they make their dung
in thicke vvreaths that are verie soft: and yet there are some of them that make
it flat and broad, vntill mid Iune: And from mid Iuly vnto the end of August,
their dung is printed, grosse, long, and knottie, vvell hammered, annoynted,
or gilded: and these are the markes to know Harts of tenne tynes from the old
ones.
                  
                     
The cariages of a Hart are said to be,The cariages or largenesse of his tines. when a Hart passing through a thicke and
twiggie vvood, hitteth with his head against the boughes of trees: for so it commeth
to passe, that if the Hart be tall and large, the cariages will also be somewhat large.
Now the iudgement vvhich the hunts-man can gather of the carriages, cannot be but
from after Iuly vntill March: for the other foure moneths, that is to say, March, Aprill,
May,The time when Harts cast their 
                           〈◊〉
                        . and Iune, the Harts cast their heads, that is to say, their hornes. True it
is, that they begin to put forth new hornes by the moneth of Aprill, and as the Sunne
mounteth higher, and grasse groweth higher also, and harder, so their homes grow
and wax greater: so that by the middest of Iune their heads will be fully see and garnished
with all that which they are to beare all the yeare long, prouided that they be
in a good thriuing countrey, and come not by any hurt or annoyance. You may likewise
iudge of their age by the tynes of their hornes: for as for the first yeare, they haue
no hornes: the second yeare they haue their first hornes,To iudge of the age of the Hart by his hornes. which are called daggers:
the third yeare, foure, sixe, or eight tynes: the fourth yeare, eight or tenne tynes: the
fifth yeare, tenne or twelue: the sixth, twelue, foureteene, or sixteene: and in the seuenth,
their hornes put forth the greatest number of tynes that euer they will beare,
for after it they put forth no moe, but those grow greater which are put forth. Yet
notwithstanding,The hornes of an old Hart. the old Harts will alwaies be knowne, by hauing the whole root of
their hornes large and grosse, the bodie or stock very bright, and set with pearles, and
strait and large heads, rather open than turned compasse-wise.
                  By the going of the Hart,The gate or going of the Hart. the hunts-man shal be able to iudge whether the Hart be
great and long, and so likewise, if he will stand long in course before the dogges: for
the Harts which haue long paces, hold out longer in coursing, than those which haue
short paces, and they are also quicker, swifter, and longer breathed.
                  It is knowne if the Hart be tall and long-legged,The beatings and 
                           〈◊〉
                         of the Hart. and likewise of what bulke or
bignesse his bodie is, by marking where he entreth into the thicke amongst brakes
and small wood, which he shall haue let passe betwixt his legges: for looke at what
height he hath beaten them downe with his belly, so high must you iudge him to be
on his legges. The grossenesse of his bodie is perceiued by the two sides of the way
which he hath touched with his bodie: for he will haue broken off the drie boughes
and branches on both sides; so that thereby you may gather the grossenesse and greatnesse
of his bodie.
                  As concerning the rubbings of the Hart,The rubbing of the Hart. by how much the elder they are, by so
much the rather are they giuen to rub, and that vpon great trees: vvherefore, vvhen
the huntsman shall perceiue the branches of the tree to be broken downe, then hee
shall be able to gather the height and largenesse of the Harts head: howbeit, this is
but a darke and obscure marke.
                  Thus and by these meanes it may come to passe,The knowledge of the Hart his priuie haunt and place of retra
                           •••
                        . that the hunts-man may collect
and gather the age and largenesse of the Hart, and yet notwithstanding remaine as
ignorant as euer he was of the place where he lyeth, and from where he may find him
in his secret haunt and priuie by-walkes. And therefore to be assured throughly, it
behooueth him to haue some one or other verie good bloud-hound, hauing a verie
quicke and exquisite sent, that so he may the more easily find out and follow the foot
of the Hart: besides which meanes, it must be prouided, that the hunts-man be not
ignorant of the places in generall,The Hart hath a seueral haunt euerie moneth. which the Hart is accustomed to resort vnto, although
they be diuers, according to the moneths of the yeare; for Harts doe change
their vvalkes and feeding euerie moneth, according as the Sunne mounteth and ascendeth:
for which cause, in Nouember you must looke to find the Harts amongst
furze, briers, or heath, the crops and flowers whereof they loue to brouze and feede
vpon, thereby to restore nature after they haue beene at rut. In December they haunt
the 
                        •
                     nner parts and hart of the forrest, to purchase thereby the shield of the vvood against
cold vvinds, snow, and the noysomenesse of frosts following raine. In Ianuarie
they draw neere the corners of the forrests, and seeke reliefe amongst the greene
corne-fields, vpon Rye, and such like. In Februarie and March, because they then
cast their hornes, they hide themselues amongst the bushes, and so they continue likewise

for all Aprill and May. In Iune and Iuly, they applie the cut-woods and corne, at
which time they are in their prime, and fullest fatted: then also they seeke after water,
because of the great heat which doth alter and change them, and drinke vp the
dew and moistnesse of the wood, which then beginneth to wax hard. In September
and October, they forsake the bushes and go to rut, and then they keeps no certaine
place,The rut of the Hart. nor manner of feeding, because they range after the Hindes, and follow their
waies and steps, carrying their noses close by the ground to take the scent of them,
nothing regarding or carefull to find out by the wind, if there bee any secretly 
                        〈◊〉
                     
to do them harme: as thus also they passe and spend both day and night, being so
enraged and feruently caried away with the rut, as that they thinke that there is not
any thing that can hurt them: then also they liue with a very small, as namely of that
which is within themselues (alwaies following the steps and footings of the Hind)
and next principally the great red mushrums, which helpeth to bring them to the
pissing of their tallow, for which causes; they are very easily killed at such times, if the
venison were good.
                  Thus the hunts-man may haue a generall notion of the haunt of the Hart, and so
he shall not seeke in any other places, then where hee ordinarily maketh his abode.
And now when by the meanes aforesaid, he is sure of the place, it remaineth onely
that he learne his den or the place of his particular resort: and forthe diligent finding
out of the same, he must go earely to the place, which he knoweth to be the generall
haunt of Harts for the present time and houre, as is before declared: and he shall lead
with him his bloud-hound that is not giuen to open, to foot him withall, hauing first
wet his nostrels with good vineger,The meanes of finding out the particular place and lodging of the Hart. that so he may haue the better scent. He may also
gather some perceiuerance by the other markes before specified, that is to say, by the
prints of his feete vpon the grasse, by the carriages of his head, his dung, gate beatings,
and rubbings which hee may make vpon such things as hee meeteth withall
in his way: howbeit the hunts-man in this case must bee ruled according to the variablenesse
of the place where hee maketh search, for it is one craft and s
                        •
                     eight to
find the lodging of the Hart amongst the vnderwood, another amongst the corne
fields, and a third kind of skill to find him out amongst the high woods, and they
are better learned by practise in hunting and experience, than by instructions deliuered
in writing: and to the end I may not be too tedious, I will say no more of this
matter.

hunting of the Hart belongeth vnto Kings, Princes, and great states)
of his indeauour, representing vnto him the dung of the Hart which he shall haue
marked, making rehearsall withall of the markes and notes of the Hart which hee
hath seene: and then his Lord may make choice of and appoint the day and houre,
for the hunting of the hart in the place which hath bin foretold by the hunts-man.

those which are to be put on in a set and certaine place for the easing of those which

when they are come to the place, they shall make diligent search to find out where
the Hart is lodged, and that both by their bloud-hound that will not open, as also
by other meanes that they may deuise and inuent before they make choice of any

standing for their dogges, either coursers, or of easement. When they haue cast about
the couert, and found the layre of the Deere, they shall take vp the Lya

first place the Hewed round about that side of the vvood, out of which they would
by no meanes haue the Deere to breake through or passe. This Hewed is a certaine
companie of men coasting that side of the couert about, and making continuall
noyses and clamors, whereby they may affright the Deere from daring to attempt
to come neere that coast. Then on that side through which they would haue the
Deere to passe, and where the course shall be made, there they shall in senet stands,
made in the trees, twentie paces vvithin the vvood, place the Bowes, vvhich, as the
Deere shall passe by, may shoot according to their skils and fortunes. And this coast

the Bowes are placed, then on the next champion ground, and as neere the couert as
you can conueniently, you shall place your Teasers, that is, the first brace of greyhounds
for the course, vvhich should be the lightest, nimblest, and swiftest dogges
you haue, that putting the Stagge to the vtmost of his speed at first, he may be the
lesse able to endure his course foorth. Then a quarter of a myle before them, or more,
according to the quantitie of ground, you shall place your Reset, vvhich vvould be
a brace of greyhounds somewhat stronger than the former, vvhich comming in
more fresh, may pinch sorer, and make the Deere in more despaire of safetie. Lastly,
a quarter of a myle before them, you shall place your Backset, vvhich vvould be two
of the strongest and forest biting greyhounds you can get, vvho taking aduantage of
the Stagges wearinesse, and comming to pinch, may there hold him, vvithout suffering
him to tunne further. When you haue thus placed your course, you shall then
take your hunting hounds, and vncoupling them, cast them off into the couert, encouraging
them both with hornes and voices, till they haue the Deere on foot, and
so hunt him,Directions how to hunt the Deere with hounds onely. till you haue brought him to take his end at the Bowes, or in the
course. But if you make no vse either of Bowes or Greyhounds, but onely intend
to hunt the Stagge at force with hounds onely, then as soone as you haue cast off
your hounds, and got the Stagge on foot, you shall by all the diligent meanes you
can, get sight of him so soone as is possible, and vpon his view take such speciall
and true knowledge of him, that vvhensoeuer you shall crosse him, you may know
him from anie other Deere vvhatsoeuer: And then you shall giue good heede
vnto his manner of hunting, and vnto the sleights vvhich hee vseth in the chase;
of all vvhich vvee shall speake seuerally hereafter. And in case your hounds may
be ouer-haled and vvearied by the long standing of the Stagge, it shall not bee
amisse to haue hounds of easement in some conuenient place, vvhich you may cast
off in the middest of the day to relieue the former, and make the chase or royle much
shorter.
                  The Hart being once perceiued by the horsemen,Dogges of easement are such as are rested to runne when others are wearie. or winded by the bloud▪ hound,
they must place their dogges of easement at three or foure seuerall stands, and certaine
places, to the end that they may ease the other dogges which are wearie with
running, or haue lost the footing of the Hart, and so by them giue new chase vnto
the beast: and such dogges of easement shall bee so set in companies, that if the

dogges must be vncoupled for to runne; regard being had according to the place
where the Hart was seene.

not alreadie cast some therein, in his watch, at such time as he made search to find out

the lodging of the Hart, or else the horsemen themselues, before the vncoupling and
letting loose of the coursing dogges. In the meane time, if it fall out, that the Hart in
his course doe happen to passe neere vnto the dogges of easement, the horseman
which keepeth the same, must marke whether the Hart be pursued with anie of the
companie of the coursing dogges, and then presently to vncouple the companie of his
dogges of easement, hallowing and whupping the dogges continually, and casting of
boughs of trees in the way where the Hart should passe: but if he pe

                     ceiue that there
be not any of the companie of the coursing dogges, neither yet heare any noise of the
men that are hunting, hee must not vncouple any of his dogges, but onely marke the
way that the Hart runneth, to make report thereof to the companie, to the end hee
may know whether the same be the Hart in chase, or no: because that sometimes Harts
are driuen through feare out of the places where they vse to lye, hearing the noise of
the companie of the dogges and horsemen.
                  In the meane time, the horsemen appointed to wait vpon the companie, must alwaies
second and keepe by the sides of the dogges, to cause them the better to keepe
and agree together, and to helpe them at a default, if at any time they happen to be out
of the trace, and not to follow the right way.
                  They must also haue a care of the vviles and sleights of the Hart,The 
                           〈◊〉
                         of the Hart. vvho vvhen hee
seeth himselfe neere pursued by the dogges, indeuoureth and bestirreth himselfe how
to acquire and rid himselfe of them, making many windings and turnes, and that in
diners manners.
                  For sometimes hee busieth himselfe about the finding out of the dennes of other
beasts,The moliciousnes of the Hart. hiding himselfe therein, and letting the dogges by that means to ouerslip him,
as not being able to find the sent of him, hauing couched his foure feet vnder his belly,
and drawing his breath from the coolenesse and moisture of the earth. Againe,
he hath this subtletie and craft by nature, as to know, that the dogges doe gather more
sent from his breathing and feet, than from any of the rest of the parts of his bodie.
But to preuent this his craftie wilinesse, you must haue cast many boughes in the entrances
of such thickets as the Hart is to passe by, to the end they may the better find
the last feeting and breathes, which will yeeld some neere guesse of the place wherein
he shall be hid.
                  Othersome times, vvhen the Hart seeth the dogges chasing him, and that he cannot
auoid himselfe from them, hee goeth from one thicket to another, seeking the
haunts of Hindes, and other lesser Harts, and thrusteth himselfe into their companie:
and moreouer, sometimes draweth them away, and causeth them to runne with him
the space of a whole houre or more vpon his way, afterward casting them off, and making
way for himselfe out of and farre from any way. And if it happen that his wiles
be found out by the exquisite sent of the dogges, and wisedome of the hunters, then
he casteth about into his first way, to breake off by that meanes his 
                        •
                     ormer traces, and
thereby to mocke the dogges: then after that, hee entreth into some large and wide
way, which he followeth so long as his strength will endure. To auoid these sleights,
the horsemen must haue an eie when the Hart shall fall into companie of other beasts,
and runne away with them, to the end they may stirre vp the old dogges of the companie
to pursue the Hart with greater carefulnesse, keeping neere about them to helpe
and aid them: and if the Hart haue taken the broad way, to the end he may take away
all sent from the dogges (for this is a most 
                        〈◊〉
                      thing, that all sorts of beasts doe
passe through the broad waies, whose earth turneth into powder) in such sort, as that
the way of the Hart, and the places which the horne of his foot did tread vpon, become
quickly filled vp againe and couered by the falling together of the dust, the
horsemen must looke very carefully, and view the ground very well, to see if they can
perceiue any traces of the Hart, and then they shall cast the boughes out of their way
lustily, and encourage their dogges, calling vnto them in cheerefull and cherishing
manner.
                  Againe, it sometime falleth out, that Harts doe run ouerthwart the burned grounds
where the dogges can haue no sent, because the smell of the fire is greater than the sent

of the Hart: yea, and sometimes the dogges doe giue ouer coursing, hauing drawne
into their nosthrils this euill smell: vvhereupon the horsemen must goe aside a little
out of their way with the dogges, vntill such time as they be got past the same, and
then bringing their dogges into order againe, let them encourage and cheere them
forward to follow the game.
                  Sometime the Hart runneth a contrarie course to that by which he is winded, to
the end that his breath may be scattered and dispersed, and that it may not come to
the sent of the dogges, as also that he may heare the noise of the dogges vvhich chase
him, and then the charge lieth vpon the horsemen to marke his steps and traces.
                  Againe, there be some Harts, which in going from the rest doe make breaches, casting
themselues vpon their bellies before the horsemen, and shew themselues to be
put forth by the dogges, as if they were wearie, and had beene long chased: these
wiles doe shew them to be verie subtle and long winded, able to stand a long time before
the dogges, trusting in their strength: and this the horsemen must beware of, to
the end they may be able to iudge of the deceitfulnesse of the Harts: for sometimes
they faine themselues ouer-chased, when indeed they are not.
                  The signes and tokens shewing that the Hart hath beene long chased,The signe
                           •
                         and tokens of a Hart ouer-chased. are these: if
in running before the dogges he neither heare nor see any man: if he hang downe his
head, holding his nose vnto the ground: if he stumble and stagger, reeling with his
legges: afterward, if he see a man vpon the suddaine, he lifteth vp his head, and giueth
a great leape, as who would say he were yet strong and lustie: furthermore, if he haue
his mouth black and drie, without any froth, and his tongue drawne vp into the 
                        •
                     ame:
if in his gate he shut his hoofe, as though he went steadie, and yet afterward on the
suddaine straineth himselfe, and openeth it, making great sl
                        •
                     dings, suffering his bones
to kisse the ground verie often, following commonly the trodden path and broad
waies: likewise, if he meet with a hedge, he holdeth along by the side of it, to see if he
can find any out-gate, seeing his strength faileth him to leape ouer.
                  Now after his long running and manifold shifts,The Hart long chased, when he becommeth wearie and
spent, and that he cannot longer stand out, being past all hope of himselfe, he leaueth
the low vvoods and forrests, and flieth to the champion fields, or vnto the corn-fields
and villages bordering next thereto, or else he betaketh himselfe to some riuer or lake,
whereby it falleth out oftentimes, that he auoideth and freeth himselfe of the coursing
dogges: for in champion places and void fields the sent of the footing of the Hart is
verie small: and as for riuers and lakes, he hath the craft rather to take downeward
with the streame, than to swimme vpward against the streame, to bereaue the dogges
by that meanes of comming by the sent of him.
                  The horsemen shall see to such his escapes: and therefore if he haue taken his way
into any champion ground, they shall find out his traces by the sight of the eye, and
with the blast of the horne they shall cheere vp and encourage their dogges to a new
course. If the Hart haue taken the water, whether it be for the cooling of himselfe, or
as the vttermost refuge he hath for the sauing of his life, the hunter shall looke at what
place the Hart shall haue taken the same, and there cast in good store of boughes, attending
his passage: and if they see that he commeth not out of the water, they shall
cause their dogges to take the water: or else (if they be afraid of causing them to take
cold) they shall send to seeke a boat: or else if they can swimme, they shall put off all
their clothes, and with a dagger in 
                        〈◊〉
                      and swimme vnto him to kill him: and yet
they must looke, that they see not vpon him, but in some deepe place, because that if
the Hart find ground for his feet, he would be able to hurt one of them with his horns,
whereas in a deepe place he hath no strength.
                  Furthermore,To become to stand to the 
                           •
                        ay. there must great wisedome be vsed in the hunting of the Hart, when
he can no longer hold out, but being out of all hope of his life, standeth still, and suffereth
the dogges to barke at him, for then he groweth dangerous, as being giuen to
strike with his hornes the first of the hunters that he can mee

the cause why it is growne to a prouerbe,The Beere for the Hart, and the Barber for the Bore. A Beere for a Hart, and a Barber for a
vvilde Bore. Wherefore it standeth euerie man vpon to looke vvell to himselfe

in comming neere vnto the Hart when he endureth the bay, and not to aduenture too
farre, and hazard himselfe too boldly.
                  When the Hart is taken, he that shall haue giuen the blow, shall

sound the retrait, to the end hee may call together his fellow hunters and the
dogges: and after he hath presented the right foot of the Hart vnto the King, or vnto
his Lord, then to cut him vp as he shall know it meet to be done In the meane time he
must not forget to take care of the dogges, and to giue them some reliefe &amp; sustenance
of the prey they haue gotten in hunting: vnto the bloud-bound, that is, vnto the dog
which by his sent hath led the way to the Hart his lodging, he shall cast the head and
the heart, as his right and due: vnto the rest he shall giue the necke and braine of the
Hart, or which is better, he shall take bread and cut it into little lunches into to a panne
with cheese, and temper the same both together with the bloud of the Hart in his
greatest hea

forth vpon the grasse, and in the meane space euery man shall put his horne vnto his
mouth, and therewithall comfort and cheere vp the dogges.

with the entrailes of the Hart all whole, which the master hunts-man doth cast vnto
the dogges after they haue ended their feast, holding them vp on high: and whiles the
dogges are eating these entrails, they must be cheered vp with the noise of the hornes,
shoutings, and hallowings.

                     NOtwithstanding, that the hunting as vvell of the Hart, as of other vvilde
beasts, be vndertaken and performed by great States rather for the exercise
of the body and recreation of the spirits, than for any other desire
and hope; yet the killing of the Hart is not without great profit, and
that in two respects: the first being for the making of meat thereof: and the second,
for the medicinable helps which may be made of his parts and members.
                  As concerning the meat made of the Hart: his flesh is not very pleasant,The fl

not of that part of him which is commonly called the pizzle: for to speake generally
according to the truth, Harts flesh is verie hard, of an euill iuice, melancholicke,
hard to digest in the stomacke, and verie apt and easie to procure many great diseases.
It is true, that many great Ladies (hauing an opinion, that the flesh of Harts being
eaten often, doth free and deliuer men from all danger of Agues, because the beast
himselfe is not subiect at all thereunto) at their rising euerie morning haue accustomed
to taste of Harts flesh: notwithstanding, vvho so is carefull of his
health, should not touch anie such flesh, except it be of some tender Fawne, or
young Hiude, vvhich are made seruices for the most part at the Tables of Princes
and great Lords.

                  The best time to hunt the wild Bore, and the markes of a
good wild Bore.
                  
                     IT is certaine that the hunting of the wild Bore is a great deale more difficult
and daungerous than that of the Hart,

                        gerous. in asmuch as the wild Bore
doth not feare the dogs, but tarrieth and stayeth their comming, and
which is more, doth sometimes set vpon them so far as till he be amongst
them,
                        
                           •

                           〈◊〉
                         dangerous. and all to the end hee may teare and rent them with his teeth, whose wounds
(especially those that are giuen into the chest of the bodie) are (as it were) incurable.
Wherefore the good hunts-man that maketh any account of his dogs, for to hunt the
Hart, the Roe-bucke and Hare, must neuer giue chase to the wild Bore with his coursing
dogs, but rather with some companie of mastiues, whose proper pray the wild
Bore is: or else which is better to find the meanes to take him in toiles, or to kill him
with a wile and a speare, as we shall further declare.
                  But howsoeuer the matter go, yet this is to be knowne, that all Bores are not fit to
be hunted,
                        
                           〈…〉
                        . but such onely as are not past foure yeares old, howsoeuer they may bee
otherwise both faire, great and fat: for after foure yeares the wild Bore groweth l

are not fit to hunt them in,
                        
                           〈…〉
                        
                      but onely when they are in season and in the best plieght,
as namely from mid September to December, at which time they begin to go to rut:
and yet in Aprill and May they are more easie to be taken in toiles, than at any other
time, because they sleepe more in this season than at any other time: and the cause is,
for that they feed vpon strong herbes, which stirreth the bloud, and sendeth vapours
vp vnto their braine, whereby sleepe is brought vpon them: againe the Spring time
doth then restore and renew their bloud, whereby they are brought to take great ease
and rest.
                  The hunts-man therefore shall know the fairenesse of the Bore,

                        . and that hee is
worth the hunting, by these markes, that is to say, by his traces, rooting, foile, and
dung.
                  The prints of his traces great and large: the taking of the trace before, round and grose:

the cutting of the sides of the traces vsed, but not shewing themselues cutting, the
heele large, his gards grosse and open, wherewith he must tread vpon the ground in
the hard wheresoeuer hee goeth: all these things declare him to bee a faire and great
bore. In like manner the traces behind being larger than those before, doe shew the
thicknesse of his haunches: the wreathes and wrinkles which are betwixt his gards
and the heele, if they make their prints vpon the ground, do shew that his steps are
great and long. The markes of his traces deepe and wide, do shew also his heauienes
and corpulencie. The rootings of the bore being deepe and large, do note the thicknesse
and length of his head.
                  The soile of the wild bore being long, large, and great, doth note and argue the
bore to be great: or else in going from the soile, his greatnesse may be known by the
entrances of the thickets, by the leaues and herbes which the soile hath touched, because
that at such time as hee commeth out of it, he beare

and therewith the leaues are bemired, as he goeth amongst them; and hence is gathered
his height and breadth: or else it falleth out oftentimes, that the wild bore after
he hath bin at soile, goeth to rub himselfe against some one tree or other, and there hee
leaueth the marke of his height.
                  The dung of the wild bore being thicke and long, doth shew the greatnesse of the
wild bore, howbeit the hunts-man is not to present it vnto the companie, but onely
giue them the view of it in place as it lieth.

and of their haunt.

of the foot, than vpon the heele, resting notwithstanding his gardes
vpon the ground, spreading the same abroad thereupon vnto the vtter sides: the

Swine in their gate do open the cleft of their hoofe before, pitching rather vpon the
heele than vpon the forepart of their foot, and their hinder foot doth not ouer-reach
their fore-foot: the sole of their foot is full of flesh, so that the prints of their steps
cannot bee but vneuen, contrarie to that of the wild Bore. In like manner the wild
Bore maketh deeper rootings, because he hath a longer head, and when he commeth
in
                        •
                     ields that are sowne, he willingly followeth one furrow, nu

                     ame hog vseth not to doe, for hee neither
turneth vp the earth in so deepe manner, nor yet followeth on along with it as the
wild Bore is accustomed to do, but hee casteth vp one peece of ground in on place,
and another in another further off, crossing the ridges, the one of them not reaching
vnto the other. Furthermore, when the wild Bores goe vnto the corne, they bear
                        •
                     
down the same all in a round; but so do not

particular propertie, namely, that he is neuer meazelled as the

                     ame Swine wil be.
                  The difference betwixt the wild Bore and the Sow is this:The difference betwixt the wild Bore and the wild Sow. The Bore goeth wider
with his hinder legs than the Sow, and commonly setteth his hinder steps vpon
the edges of his foresteps on the out-side, because of the thicknesse of his hanches
and stones, which cause them to go wider dehind, which the Sowes do not; for they
are emptie betwixt the hanches, for which cause they tread narrower. The Sow maketh
not so good a heele as the bore, and hath her hoofe longer and sharper before,
and more open, her steps and soles of her feet behind, more narrow than the Bores.
The bore with much adoe, and hardly, will be brought to crie when he is killed, but
the Sow will not let to make you heare her aloud.
                  
                     
The wild Bore hath no certain abode,

                        . and as some say, he is but a traueller, because
he doth nothing but runne from one forest and wood to another: and yet hee taketh
great delight to remaine in the countrie and place where hee was bred: in so much
as that if he be hunted by dogs from any bush or forest, he is still readie to run without
any stay, vntill he come in the countrie from whence he first came, and where hee
was bred; for there hee setteth vp the rest of his safegard, and maketh it the onely
refuge of all his force and strength: he is also oftentimes found in the countries where
small nuts and beech mast may bee come by, for he more delighteth to feed of them
than of acornes.
               
               
                  CHAP. XXIX.
                  Of the taking of the wild Bore.
                  
                     AS concerning the hunting of the Bore, it craueth rather many men than
dogs; for there is no greater cut-throat to dogs than the wild Bore: and
yet there may dogs be vsed, but with such discretion, as that the horse-men
be alwaies mingled with them, and pressing vpon the Bore as valiantly
and forcibly as they can: for when hee seeth himselfe set vpon with hors-men
and dogs both at once, euen vpon the first push they besetting him hard, do astonish
him, and cause him to loose whatsoeuer his courage, and in steed of wrecking his furious
moode vpon the dogs, hee is constrained to run away and flie the countrie.
Then also you must let slip some of your fresh dogs, or dogs of easement, but let them
not be young nouices, but rather old ones, and such as haue beene well trained and
taught, that they may succour the first, and force the Bore to a more speedie flight.
And you need not feare that he should betake himselfe to any turnings,

other deceitfull trickes, because he is heauie, and that the dogs are able to follow him
close and hard by. But when after long chase the horsemen see that the wild Bore doth
endure the abbaie (which he will neuer do vntill he bee mightily vrged) they must
forthwith, but as priuily as they can compasse him about, and set forward all at once
directly towards him, hauing in their hands euery one his sword, and not failing to
kill him: and yet notwithstanding they must not hold their hand low, for so they
should light vpon his head, but they must rather beare their hands on high, and strike
at him with their swords, to giue him deepe blowes, but taking heed that they strike
not the Bore on that side next their horse, but rather on the fide further off; for looke
on what side he feeleth himselfe hurt, that way he turneth his head presently, and so
he might either kill or wound the horse. This is a most certaine trueth, that if there
be dog collers hung with bells put about the dogs necks which are called coursers,
when they hunt the Bore, that he will not kil him so soone, but run away before them,
neuer comming to the abbay.

                  The profit that commeth of the killing of
the wild Bore.
                  
                     THe profit comming of the killing of the wild Bore is twofold, as is that
of the Hart: the one concerning food, and the other concerning medicine,
for which it may be imployed and vsed.
                  As concerning nourishment, the flesh of the Bore is better without
all comparison than that of the Hart, for the proofe whereof I refer me to the stately

bankets of the auncient Romans, who so greatly esteemed Bores flesh, as that they
did serue them all whole vpon the table. The princes and great lords of this our age
do prize it highly, but especially, and aboue the rest, the head of the bore, as being
iudged a delicate and daintie fine morsell: young and tender wild Bores, are likewise
very well accounted of, in Winter feasts and bankets. And to say the truth, the flesh
of the wild bore doth nourish very much, and begetteth great quantitie of good
blood: which are the causes why Physitians make such reckoning thereof, especially
when the Bore is taken by hunting.
                  As for the Physicall helpes,The vrine of the wild bore. the vrine of the wild Bore hath many vertues: you
must take the bladder of the wild Bore, wherein there is yet some quantitie of vrine,
and with this vrine mingle a little quantitie of oyle, hanging vp the same bladder in
the smoake of the chimney, and let it abide there vntill the vrine therein become
somewhat thicke, and of the consistence of hony: which done, it must bee carefully
kept in the bladder, to vse to annoint the nauell, temples, and nostrels of young infants
withall which are tormented and pained with wormes,Worm

experimented with good successe. This vrine likewise thus prepared, doth break

                  CHAP. XXXI.
                  Of the pleasure of the hunting of the Hare, and of the dogs
that are fit for the same.
                  
                     CErtaine it is that the hunting of the Hare is more pleasant, more liuely, and
lesse costly (not onely for gentlemen, but also for all men of estate) than
of any other beast, because it is accompanied with a thousand prettie
pleasures and recreations euerie houre, and of small charges, besides the
securitie thereof, and the auoiding of the daungers and inconueniencies which are
many, and happen oft to such as hunt the Hart and the wild Bore: whereunto you
may adde the great contentment, and no small pleasure which may be taken in seeing
as it were the spirit of this little beast, as it were admirable in nature, and the sleights
which she vseth to shift and rid her selfe from the dogs that chase her. Such game we
will allow our Farmer, yea, and so as that I could wish him to vse it as oft as hee can,
for it cannot but affoord him both pleasure and profit.
                  And whereas this game consisteth principally vpon multitude of dogs, the gentleman

                         the Hare. and hath a young companie of dogs to teach, must
obserue two things principally, to traine and instruct them well. The first is, that
from the beginning he accustome them to goe vncoupled, and to run in all sorts of
grounds and countries, that is to say, vpon plaines, vnderwoods and thickets: for
otherwise if you accustome them from the beginning to run in one place onely, as in
woods or grounds that are fallen, and haue the wood cut downe, they will not make
any reckoning of the plaines and fields, but they will goe and raunge the grounds
where they haue beene accustomed to find sport and take their pleasure in finding
the Hare. The second is, that he neuer teach his dogs to hunt in the mornings, because
of the dew &amp; coolenes of the earth, but rather in the height of the day: for if you vse
them to the coole seasons, and then afterward bring them to hunt at the height of the
day, they feeling any heat or small wind will not afterward hunt any more.
                  Wherefore the fittest time to traine young dogs vp in, and to make them fit for
the hunting of the Hare, is after September vnto December, because that then the

time is temperate, as also because that the young hares are foolish, and but weake bodied,
neither skillfull, nor able to worke their wiles: and besides, because they
themselues doe start of themselues many times before the dogs which take pleasure
therein, and become better entred and enured thereby, than they would bee, if they
should be hares that would run away and be packing apace from them.

                     NOw although in hunting of the Hare, the hunter taketh what hee can
haue, and not what hee can find, because of the swiftnesse and wilinesse
of this little beast, which oftentimes disappointeth him of his
purpose: notwithstanding if at any time it bee graunted the hunter by
the good hap of hunting to chuse the best Hare amongst many, or else that some
Lord, not willing to loose his labour, hath sent his hunts-man to find the Hare before
hee hunt her; the markes of a good and faire Hare, and such a one as deserueth to be

                         are leprous. for such as keepe neere vnto water are commonly leprous. Further, the
male is far better than the female.
                  The markes to know the one and the other are these: The male hath commonly
his dung smaller, drier, and sharper at the point: the female hath them greater,
rounder, and not altogether so drie as the males: the female hath a grosser bodie,
but the male hath a more slender and fine bodie: the male in comming out of his
forme, hath his hinder parts whitish, as though hee had beene plumed: the male
hath also red shoulders, with some long haires mixt amongst, he hath also a shorter
and more bushie head than the female, the haire and beard of his iawes long, his
eares short, wide, and whitish: the female hath a long and narrow head, and also
great eares: the haire growing along the ridge of the backe of a darke gray. When
the dogs course the female, she doth nothing but coast round about her seat &amp; countrie,
passing seuen or eight times by one place before she euer squa

                     : the male doth
the contrarie; for being coursed with dogges, hee runneth sometimes seuen or eight
leagues distance from his forme.
                  To know the forme of a Hare, you must take the benefit of the night: for in the
night she withdraweth her selfe into her forme, and not in the morning, because of
the dew: neither yet vpon the height of the day, because of the heate. There is
more regard to bee taken vnto her traces: for the print of the hares foot is sharpe,
and fashioned like vnto the point of a knife, hauing her small nailes all pricked right
downe into the ground, and they doe leaue their print round about, drawing alwaies
narrower and narrower, hauing the sole of her foot alway close, after the manner of
the point of a knife.
               
               
                  
                  CHAP. XXXIII.
                  The killing of the Hare.
                  
                     FOr the hunting of the Hare, the very best time to kill her with coursing
dogs, beginneth at mid September, and endeth at mid Aprill, because
of the flowers and great heat which then begin to raigne, for both these
are apt to depriue the dogs of their necessary scent: besides that, at these
times the Hares are but young and feeble.
                  Notwithstanding,Places in which the dogs haue no scent. there be certain countries and seasons, where &amp; when the dogs
haue not any scent of Hares, as in Winter in the plaine countries where the ground
is fat and strong, because the Hare hath her foot vnderneath full of haire, so that when
she runneth, a fat ground will take hold vpon it, and so she carrieth it away with her
foot, and so all the scent that the dogs might otherwise take, is withheld: and vpon
plaines there are neither branch nor herbe for her to hit her body vpon, no more than
there is in broad and troden waies. In like manner it is an vnfit time to draw out dogs
to hunt in frostie weather: for they would both loose their nailes, and sp
                        •
                     ile their
feet: on the contrarie, the Hares run better at that time, than at any other, because they
haue their feet furred.
                  Also high waies are very daungerous and ill to hunt vpon: for by reason of the
much trauelling of men and other cattell, the scent which the Hare should leaue, is
cleane taken away, and the dogs noses are stopt with contrarietie of odour: nor is it
good to hunt where flocks of sheepe, heards of goats or cattell are kept; for the hotnesse
of their sent taketh away all scent of the Haire.
                  The first point making way for the killing of the Hare,That the finding of the forme of the Hare, is the first and chiefest step to kill her. consisteth in finding out
her forme, which the better to find, you must haue respect vnto the season wherein
you go about it, and the time how it shapeth: for if it be in the Spring or Summer,
the Hares lodge not amongst the thicke places of woodes, because of the ants, serpents,
and lizards which driue them thence, and so at such times they are constrained
to lodge amongst the corne, fallowes, and other weake places. In Winter they do the
contrary: for they take vp their lodging in some thicke bushes, or thicke places of
the wood, especially, when the Northren winds, and other high and low winds doe
blow, for of such they are much afraid. Wherefore according to the time and place,
where you shall see the Hares to take vp their lodging, you must prepare your dogs
to go and set vpon the Hare within her forme, and when she shall bee started, the
horse-men (which shall not be aboue three in number) must incourage the dogs to
follow the chace, without making of much crying or greatly whupping of them,
for feare of setting of them in too great a hea

                     e, which might cause them to ouerslip

                         best to find the Hare in. you shall repaire to the moores or heath which are ouergrowne
with ling, or with gosse, whins, Brakes, or such like, for they are speciall harbours in
which a Hare delights most: also in such places where there is great store of fog or
long dead grasse which lieth vngot. You shall be sure to find Hares haunt, especially
in the Spring time, because such ground being giuen to moisture, makes them
take a greater delight therein: for Hares at that time of the yeare loue to haue all
their hinder loynes couered with water: from whence it comes that the best Hare
finders, when they seeke Ha

                     es, looke all the Winter vp to the top or ridge of the
lands, and in the Spring, downe to the lowest bottome of the furrowes. Now as
soone as you haue found your Hare, and started her, the horse-men which follow
the chace, shall by all obseruations possible take good heed to the wile
                        •
                      and
sleights of the Hare, the which are verie many and diuers, as in the time of raine
the hare doth rather follow trodden pathes and broad then at any other time, and

if she light vpon any vnderwood, she will not go in but to refresh her selfe by the
sides thereof, and letteth the dogs passe by: after when they are gone past, she turneth
and 
                        •
                     unneth backe in the same steps by which she came thither, vnto the place
from whence she was dislodged, rather than she would run vp into the forestes, by
reason of the moistnesse which is amongst the wood. When such practises are in
hand, the horse-men must stay some hundred paces from the wood by which the
hare is come, for he shall not faile to see her returne by her former way right vpon
him, whereby he shall be able to call in the dogs. The horse-men likewise shall obserue
and marke whether it be a male or a female, and whether she bee one that keepeth
continually in the countrie, or but a guest for a night: for if she be a wanderer
and not of constant abode, she will haue her forme in couer
                        •
                     , and suffer the dogs to
put her vp three or foure times neere vnto her forme: for this is infallible that the
hare, bred and sed where she is put vp, and especially the female, if the horse-man
obserue and market the first place and compasse that she taketh the first time after she
is departed and gone from her lodging being before the dogs, all the rest of the co

that she shall make that day will be by the same places, waies, and muses, if it bee
not a male hare come from far, or else the dogs haue hunted her so hard, and wearied
her so much, as that she be driuen to forsake her woonted haunt: and this commonly
they do voluntarily betake themselues vnto, if they be at any time coursed two whole
houres, without default.
                  At the first when the dogs begin to course the hare, she doth nothing but wind and
turne, tracing ouer one place fiue or fixe times, and that all in the same trace. And this
you must learne, that if the coursing dogs misse of taking the hare one day, then it
will bee good for the horse-man to beare in mind the places and coasts that then she
passed through: for if he returne at any other time, and haue her in course with the
dogs, she will passe by the same places, and practise the same shifts shee did the day
before when she escaped, and thus being before acquainted with her cra

which she will run he may greatly help his dogs.
                  Some hares as soone as they heare the sound of the horne do start, and take some
riuer or lake, and then you must vse what good meanes you can to cause her to auoid
the water, drawing the dogs neere the place most likely for her landing, that so they
may take her.
                  The females are more often in practising their wiles, and in shorter space, which
the dogs loue not: for it is a wearisome i

                     kesomnesse to couragious and lustie dogs,
to be drawne a side so oft, it being their chiefe desire to course such a beast as will run
out before them, that so they may runne according as their strength will serue them.
And for such hares as are giuen to wind and turne so oft, it is requisite that you take
great compasse of ground, that so you may inclose all her wiles, leauing no passage
for her to find but only one way to go out, and by this meanes you shall abridge her
much of her helpes, and driue her to forsake her shifts and sleights.
                  There are also some hares giuen to run in trodden pathes, and high waies, to the
end the dogs might not come by any scent of them, there being neither braunch of
tree, nor herbes, nor moisture, which can touch their bodies, to gather any scent for
the dogs, in such manner as there would, if they were in other couert places, as woods,
corne, and other coole places, and especially when they feed in any greene corne, because
they rest their bodies in one place. When the horse-man shall find such hares,
and shall perceiue the default of the dogs, by reason of the high way, he must draw
them on forward all along the said high way, following them continually vntil such
time as the dogs find her out gate, or else till he haue found some little valley or coole
place in the middest of the way, where the dogs may seeme to haue found her scent.
And he himselfe also must light from off his horse to see if that he can espie any of the
traces of the hare, such as we haue described them before. And by these traces or footsteps,
he shall by little and little picke out which way she is gone, and this amongst
hunts-men is called the pricking forth of the hare, one obseruation no lesse needfull
than any other obseruation whatsoeuer: for it is not to be vsed onely in plaine high

waies and foot pathes, but also in any other ground which is plaine, as vpon fallowe
lands, or other worne ground where the greene swarth is taken away: and
this aboue all other is the most safest and surest way for the recouering of a losse,
because it goes not by coniecture or imagination, but by certaine knowledge, and
by knowledge of that member by which the hound hunteth only, and by which he
beareth the whole scent he seeketh.
                  The hare hath a thousand other shifts, all which in generall the warie and wilie
horse-man may meet withall, if when he hath seene her fetch her first compasse, and
withall got the knowledge of the coast, which she betaketh her selfe vnto in her
course, he get before her to behold her with his eies, and in the same place incourage
the dogs, making them to fetch great circuits, to the end they may be sure to include
and compasse all her wiles and shifting tricks.
                  Hares liue not aboue seuen yeares at the most, and especially the males: they haue
this tricke with them, that if the male and the female doe liue together in a countrie,
they will neuer suffer other strange hares to abide there, if they can remedie it, except
it be such as they haue bred: and thereupon some say,The more that a place is hunted, the moe hares there are That the more that any place
is hunted, the moe hares are found there, because that strangers, and those of other
countries do come thither.
                  The hare being killed, it will be good to giue the dogs their fees, the better to incourage
them, and to cause them with much more ioy to hunt in that place afterward.
This their repast or fees may be made of bread,The meat that is made of the har

all put into the bodie of the hare, that so it may bee moistned and ouerdrowned
with bloud, and after spread vpon the cleane grasse. For their second sort of meate,
as a more royall banquet, if there be store of hares taken, will bee good to vncase
one and first taking out her lights, then to cast the whole carkasse to the dogs, giuing
them leaue to teare and eat her: and after that they haue eaten her, to giue them bread
least they should proue sicke at their stomakes, and cast their gorge, seeing that hares
flesh is enemie vnto them. In like manner when the dog which is taught to hunt the
hare, shall bee brought to course the hart, hee will not make any more account of the
hare, because he hath found and tasted the flesh of the hart to be far better than that
of the hare.

                  What profit commeth by the killing of the Hare.
                  
                     LIke commoditie as is to be found in the killing of the hart and wild bore,
may be found also in the hare: and to speake first of the food rising therof,
we see not any food more common, nor more in request in our countrie
of France than the hare. It is true in deed, that Physitians do iudge
the flesh of the hare to be melancholike, hard to digest in the stomake, and begetting
a grosse iuice: but this is to bee vnderstood of old hares, as such as are aboue a yeare
old, and such as are kept tame in boroughes and other inclosed places: but the young
leuerets haue a very pleasant and daintie flesh to eate: yea in those which are growne
great, there are some parts which are in request, as the loines, the shoulders and hanches.
There may be marked in this little beast a marueilous fruitfulnesse in nature,The fruitfulnes of the hare.
for that monethly she bringeth forth a great number of yong ones. I know that some
thinke, that the male and female are of both sexes, and that both of them do conceiue
and ingender as if they were hermophrodites: but it is a false conceiued opinion,
and a thing altogether strange and vnaccustomed to be in the workes and generation
that is according to nature. And it is furthermore most true, that the female being
b
                        •
                     gd, ceaseth to ingender againe for the time, that is to say, to admit the companie of
the male, thereby to haue a second conception, but by and by after she hath kindled,

she taketh the buck againe, and that is the cause of their so great fruitfulnesse: as much
may be said of conies which are a kind of hare.

the hunters,The flesh of the Fox is vnsauory taking profit in this place for meate and nourishment:
for the Foxe his flesh, (and much lesse the Brockes) is nothing pleasant
to eat, in as much as it hath an vnsauourie, strong, and wild
kind of taste. Howbeit Galen in a certaine place letteth not to say, that the flesh
of the Foxe hath the like facultie and vertue with that of the Hare: and yet in another
place, as restracting his former assertion he saieth, that the Foxe is of the same
temperature with the dog. It is certaine that some countrie people hauing not the
benefit of any other victuall, liue not vpon any other than Foxe

                  Of the two sorts of Foxes and Brocks.
                  
                     BEfore we goe any further, there are two sorts of Foxes,Brocks some like hogs and some like dogs. and two sorts of
Brockes, that is say, great Foxes and little ones accustomed to lie and
lurke in their dens: and Brockes some like swine, and some like dogges.
The two sorts of Foxes are sufficiently knowne. The hog-like Brocks
are whitish, and haue the haire aboue their noses, and vnder their throats a great deale
more white than the dog-like haue, their bodie of a greater bulke, their head and
snowt also more grosse. The hog-like in going out of their dens do freely dung, but
euermore they make a little hole with the end of their snowt before, or else scrape one
with their feet, and then dung therein: the dog-like make their dung a farre off from
their earths. The hog-like commonly make their dens in sandie or other ground that
is easie to dig, and open places, to haue the heate of the Sunne, and being giuen to
sleepe continually, they are fatter than the dog-like. The dog-like make their aboad
in tougher earth, or else in rockes, making their holes and dens deeper and narrower
than the hog-like, because they cannot dig the stiffe and tough earth or rockes, as the
other do the sand and light ground. The dog-like haue their nose, throat, and eares
yellowish, after the manner of the throat of a ma
                        •
                     ten, and they are a great deale blacker
and longer legd than the others. The two sorts accompanie not together, but
they feed of all manner of flesh: they doe much harme in warren
                        •
                     , especially vnto
the young rabbets which are within their nests, and are very sweet and daintie, but
more to pigs and hogs, whereof they feed more than of any other flesh: they feed
also of all sorts of wild flesh, as geese, hens, and such like: they are very cold and chil,
and if they be left in any roome where fire is, they will goe lie in it and burne their
feet: they will liue hardly, as also they haue a hard skin: they feare their nose notwithstanding
very much, neither can one giue them euer so little a blow thereupon
with a sticke, but they die sodainly: they are deadly enemies vnto the foxes, and oftentimes
fight with them.

                  Of two sorts of earth-dogs vsuall course foxes and brockes
withall, and the manner of teaching and trayning
of them thereunto.
                  
                     COncerning the hunting of the Foxe and Broke, it is to bee performed
with earth-dogs,Two sorts of earth-dogs. which are of two sorts: the one hath crooked lege, 
                        •
                     nd
commonly short haire: the other hath straight legs, and a shagd haire
like water-spannyels: those which haue the crooked legs creepe more,
easily into the earth than the other, and they are best for the brocks, because they stay
long there, and keepe better without comming forth. Those which haue straight legs
serue for two vses, because they run as coursing dogs about the ground, and also take

the earth more boldly then the other, but they tarrie not so long, because they vexe
themselues in fighting with the foxes and brockes, whereby they are forced to come
forth to take the aire.
                  Now if it fall out that the hunts-man haue not earth dogs readie taught,
                        
                           〈…〉
                        
                      hee may
traine them in this manner. The time to begin to take them in hand, must bee when
they are betwixt the age of eight and ten moneths: for if he will not be brought to
take the earth at a yeare old, he will scarce euer be able to bee made to take it; againe,
they must not be roughly dealt withall in the time of their training, neither so handled,
as that they may take any hurt of the brockes in the earth, because that if they
should be beaten or hardly handled, they would neuer 
                        •
                     ak the earth more. And for
that cause it must bee carefully looked vnto, that such young trained dogs bee neuer
made take the earth, where there are any old foxe
                        •
                      or brocks, but to let them first stay
out their yere, and be throughly nurtured, and furthermore there must some old earth
dogs be put in alwaies before them, to indure and beare off the furie of the brocke.
                  The most conuenient and readiest way to traine them, is thus: as such times as foxes
and brocks haue young ones, you must take all your old earth dogs, and let them take
the earth, afterward when they shal begin to stand at an abbaie, then must the young
ones be brought vnto the mouth of the hole one by one (for feare they should beate
themselues) and there cause them to heare the abbaie▪ When the old brockes or foxes
shall be taken, and none remaining but their cubs, then you must take vp and couple
vp all the old earth dogs, and after let loose the young ones, incouraging them to take
the earth, and crying vnto them, Creepe into them basset, creep into them, Hou take them,
take them: and when they haue hold of any young, brocke or foxe, they must bee let
alone, till they haue strangled him in the burrow or hole, taking heed that the earth
fall not in vpon them, least it might hurt them: afterward you must carie all the yong
brocks and foxes vnto your lodgings, and cause their liuers and the bloud also to bee
fried with cheese and fat, making them meate thereof, and shewing them the head of
their wild flesh.
                  They may also be trained and taught after another manner: as namely, you must
cause the old brocks and foxes to be taken aliue by the old earth dogs, and with pincers
fit for the purpose, take and breake all the teeth of the neather iaw, wherein the
great gripers stand, not touching the vppermost at all, to the end that by it may continually
appeare and be seene the rage and furiousnesse of the beastes, although they
be not able to do any harme therewith at all: afterward you shall cast earthes in some
meadow plot of sufficient largenesse, for the dogs to turne themselues, and go in by
couples on a brest, couering the burrowes afterward with boords and greene turfes:
this done, the brocke must be put in, and all the dogs both young and old let slip and
incouraged as hath alreadie beene said. And when they haue baited him sufficiently,
you must strike seuen or eight great blowes vpon the side of the hole with a spade, to
harden and acquaint them therewith, against the time when you shall stand in neede
to vse deluing: then you must take vp the plankes ouer the place where the brocke
is, taking hold vpon him with pincers, killing him before them, or else causing him
to be stifled by some grey-hound, that so there may meat bee made of him for them.
And you must haue cheese which you must cause to be cast them presently after their
wild flesh, when it shall be dead: and if peraduenture you would not breake all the
teeth of the neather iaw of the brocke, yet you must cut off all the greater and master
teeth, that so he may be kept from biting and doing of mischiefe.

                  The manner of killing of the Foxe.
                  
                     AS for the killing of the Foxe it is m
                        •
                     ch more easie than that of the
Brocke: herein especially, seeing that after they once scent the dogges
which baite them, they gather themselues together, and rush out vpon
the sodaine, except it be at such time as the female hath young ones, for
then they will not forsake them.
                  Naturally they are giuen to dig their earths in places that are hard to be digged,The Foxe his borow. as
in rockes, or vnder the roots of trees: they haue but one hole, but it is both strait, and
reacheth far.
                  Some hunts-men are of opinion (and sure it is very likely and credible) that the
Foxe neuer maketh his owne earth or kennell: for though he bee the subtilest of all
beastes, both touching his owne saftie, and the gaining of his pray; yet he is nothing
laborious or giuen to take paines for any thing, but his bellie onely, neither hath nature
giuen him any especiall instruments for the same vse, more than to other mungrell
dogges of which he is a kind; so that he may scrach or digge vp the earth a little
for the hiding or maine couering of his pray: but to make such tedious, deepe,
long and winding vaults, and in such difficult and tough places is hard to bee coniectured:
whence it comes, that those of better obseruation affirme, that the Brocke
or Badger, or as some call him the Grey, by reason of his colour, who is a beast of
infinit great industrie, cleanlinesse, and fearefulnesse, doth first make the Foxes
earth, but not with any determinate purpose that the Foxe should inioy it, but as a
place of refuge and rest, for himselfe onely, which as soone as the Foxe findeth out,
he presently watcheth the going out of the Badger, and then entring in at the hole,By what means the Fox commeth to haue such great

he defileth the mouth and entrance thereof both with his dung and pisse (which
is the loathsomest of all excraments) in such filthie and hatefull manner, that the
Badger returning and finding his lodging so nastily beraied, presently he forsakes
the place and commeth there no more, but leaues it to the Foxe and digs himselfe a
new cell in another place. But to our former purpose, when the the dogges haue
once ouerthrowne the Foxe, he resisteth a little, but it is not with any such boldnesse
and courage as to daunt the dogs, neither hath he any daungerous bite: and yet some
say, that he hath his shift, as to clap his taile betwixt his legs, (when he seeth himselfe
once ouerthrowne by the dogs,)That the Foxe his vrine stinketh. and to pisse vpon it, and therewithall to besprinckle
the dogs, to the end that feeling the stench thereof, they may be driuen backe and let
him depart.

were cut away, and take Galbanum and put it in, mingling alltogether, and couering
it, that all may not breath out: you may keepe it a whole yeare, and make it serue at
any time when you would make a traine to allure the dog Foxe, by taking the skin
or a collop of lard, and putting it vpon a gridyron, and when it shall be broyled and
all hot, moisting it in the pot where the priuie part of the Fox and Galbanum is, therwith
making all your traines: then you shall perceiue the male Foxes following o

you euery where: but he that maketh the craine, must rub the soles of his shoes with
cowes dung, least they should take the scent of his feete: Thus you may see the means
how to draw on the dog foxes to any place where you may take them in a snare, or
gin, and so kill them in the euening with a cros-bow.
                  This is most true, that if you rub an earth dog with brimstone, or with oile of the

lees of oyle, and thereupon cause him to take the earth, where there are foxes or
brocks, they will get themselues thence, and come no more there for two or three
moneths. There is furthermore another thing to be noted, that after that the earth
dogs are come out of the earth of foxes or brocks, they must be washed with warme
water and sope, to rid them of the mould that shall bee gotten betwixt the haire
and the skin, for else they would grow scabbed of a scab that would very hardly heale.
                  Some subtile foxe hunters take the foxe without any helpe of dogs,

they rub the sole of their shooes with a great peece of lard lately rosted, at such time
as they are about to returne home from the wood, or from any plaine where they
know that there is any foxes: after the same manner they vse to scatter by the way
(as they goe) little morsells of hogs liuer dipped in hony, drawing after them a dead
cat: whereupon the foxe following the trace at hand, allured by the scent of the lard
and hogs liuers: they haue a man accompanying them with a harquebuze, or arrow
to kill him at a blow.

Foxe, (as hath beene said) because their holes are deepe and narrow, and
consisting of many conueyances and passages: for which cause it is me
                        ••
                     e
and conuenient for the vndertaking of such a worke, first to haue foure or
fiue men furnished with spades and tooles fit for the digging of the earth: secondly,
halfe a dozen of good earth dogs at the least, euery one armed with his collar about
his necke, of the breadth of three singers, and hung with little bels, to hunt the seuerall
earths, to the end that the Brocks may be driuen the sooner to their stand, and the
dogs defended the better by those collars from taking any hurt: and when it is perceiued
that the Brocks are at their stand, or that the dogs grow weary &amp; out of breath,
or the bels to be full of earth, you must take vp the dogs, and take away their collars
from them: wheras at the first they are of good 
                        •
                     eruice, and cause the Brocke the sooner
to take them to their stand.
                  But before you let slip the dogs, there must regard be had to view the earths, what
manner of ones they be, and the place wherein they lie, and where the furthest parts
of them are; for otherwise a man should but loose his labour: in so much as if the
earths should be on the side of a hill, it were requisite that the dogs were put in vnderneath
toward the valley, to the end that the brocke may be compelled and forced
to the vttermost end of the vppermost holes, where the said earths are not so deep
as the other, and therefore may the more easily be digged.
                  But otherwise if the earth should be in some raised peece of ground, and therwithall
round about the same, the rising ground being seated in the middest of a flat peece
of ground, then the dogs must be put in at the holes which are highest, and neerest
vnto the top of the rising ground: but before they be let slip and put into such earths,
there must twentie or thirtie blowes bee giuen with the head of the spade vpon the
highest parts of the earths, thereby to cause Brockes to remooue from out of the
middest of them, and to cause them to descend to the furthest ends of their earthes
which are in the bottome of the rising ground. There must alwaies two or three
dogs be let slip at the mouths of the holes, that so by their vehemencie and eagrenesse
they may part and put a sunder the Brocks which shal be together, and force them to
flie to their rests,
                  They haue a tricke to stand the abbaie at the places where their holes doe meete,
and stoutly to resist the dogs in such places: which, when it is perceiued, it is requisite
to smite three or foure blowes with the spade, and if yet for all that they will not

remoue, you must forthwith discouer them with an a
                        •
                     gar. Then when it is perceiued
that they are fled vnto the furthest part of their holes, you must not pierce through
right vpon them, for then they would bolt forward againe into the wide spaces and
meetings of their holes, and offer violence vnto the dogges: for which cause it behoueth,
that the hole be bored right ouer where the voice of the dogge soundeth with a
round augar, for the nature thereof is to cast vp the earth, and not to let it fall downe
within: and after that is done, presently to put a slat augar into the hole of the round
augar, that so it may crosse the hole right in the middest, least the Brock should recoile
vpon the dogge: and if it be possible to shut the dogge forth on the hinder part of the
augar, it will be very good, for and if he should be shut within toward the sore-part
of it, the Brocks might beat and handle him roughly, seeing that sometimes there are
found mustered together in the vttermost end of one hole six or seuen, vvhich might
beat and driue backe the dogge. When the hole is thus crosse-barred with the flat augar,
you must presently make a trench with spades and shouels, to the end that it
may serue to set a man in, and at conuenient time to let in some dogges by the said
trench, and to cause them to hold a bay in that place, vvhere a man may see warring
and fighting on all sides. These things thus furthered, care must be had, that the
Brockes doe not couer themselues with earth, vvhich they are verie readie to doe,
being driuen vnto their vttermost places of flight, insomuch, as that the dogges are
sometime vpon or our them, and yet not know where they are. Afterward, their
fort being throwne downe, you must pull them forth, not by the whole bodie, but
by the nether iawes: for if you should take them by the vvhole bodie, they might
hurt the dogges: and if by the vpper iaw, then you might hurt their nose, which is
in them very tender, insomuch, as that being hurt therein, be it neuer so little, they
die incontinently. When they are thus drawne out, they would be put in some
sacke, and after carried into some court or garden, closed in with walls, to make
them coursing-game for young earth-dogges. But in the meane time it will be good
to draw your bootes vpon your legges: for when they are once throughly heated,
they spare not to runne vpon men after the manner of the vvild Bore, in such sort,
as that oftentimes they carrie away with them pieces of their stockings, yea, the flesh
also, which is vnder them.

                  The hunting of the Conie.
                  
                     WE haue entreated of Conies largely ynough vvhere vvee spake of the
Warren,That Conies are harmefull. the hunting vvhereof is profitable, not onely in respect of
the prouision of foode vvhich it ministreth, and that verie good,
but likewise in respect of the dammage vvhich this little beast bringeth
vnto Corne, Trees, and Hearbes: and that so dangerously (as Strabo vvriteth)
as that certaine Nations vvere constrained, in the dayes of the raignes of
Tiberius and Augustus,
                     Strabo. to send embassadours vnto the Romanes, that they might
haue their aid and succour against the vrgent and

                     ore pressing iniuries and dammages
vvhich their Countries sustained through the excessiue number of these little
beasts.
                  Wee haue make in our Treatise of the Warren two sorts of Conies, the one of
the Clapper, and the other, of the Warren: Those of the Clapper are easie to
hunt, because they are came, but those of the Warren are somewhat more hard to
take, because their nature is more enclining vnto wildnesse: The manner of hunting
them is chiefely of two sorts, and both of them verie well knowne, that is to
say, either with Pursnets, or with the Ferrets: As concerning the Ferrets,The hunting of the Conies of the Warren. they are
put into the holes of the Conies to fight with them, vvhereby they being astonished

and frighted, bolt forth by and by out of their holes, and fall into the pursnets which
lie spred vpon the tops of their holes: sometimes the Ferret doth kill them within,
which falleth out to bee the occasion of no small attendance oftentimes vnto the
hunters.

                     THe taking of Birds hath not beene much approued nor liked of, by men
of old time, by reason of the little exercise which it affoordeth: seeing
they made no account of any manner of hunting, whereby the bodie
receiued no kind of exercise, whereby it might be made more nimble
and readie to mannage matters of greater importance: againe, we find not any mention
made of the hunting of Birds, in the bookes of the auncient writers, as Aristotle
or Plin

                        e, who seemeth not to haue beene ignorant in any thing that might make for
the truth of his writings: neither yet of hauking, which is the noblest kind of hunting
of birds of all the rest. All which notwithstanding, the men of our time haue not
ceased to put in practise many sorts of taking of birdes, as, with birdes of the praie,
which excelleth all the rest, with great nets, small nets, tonnelling, fire, snares, bundles
of straw, with the cros-bow, long-bow, nooses, pit falls, chirping, pipes, horse, crow,
bell, hand, and many moe waies, which are well enough knowne to birde

                  What Hawking is.
                  
                     IT is most certaine, that the skill and knowledge of hawking hath beene
brought into an art of late times, as hath beene said: auncient writers, as
Aristotle and Plinie, the admirers of high and excellent things, and the
diligent and industrious searchers out of all things, would not haue cast
behind them so great and famous a worke of the skill of man, as to lure and reclaime
the birds of pray, but would haue written of it, if it had beene then in vse. For this is
a wonder to see a bird which hath been wild to become tame, to drop out of the skies
and to light vpon a mans fist: to soare aloft as high as the cloudes to seeke other birds
to kill them, and also to make warre vpon the foules, and such as liue below vpon the
earth, and withall to take certaine foure footed beasts, as the Hare, Rabbets, and Conies.
This skill is now a daies so highly honoured, as that the great nobles of the
world, will that it should bee consecrated wholly to themselues, as reseruing it for a
pastime onely beseeming them, and in this our countrie of France it is had in such
price, as that the gentleman which is ignorant in this skill, and that other of hunting,
is lightly prized, as though he lackt the two things which of all other (chilualrie and
martiall skill excepted) are the most rare and excellent.
                  Now as hawking is the art and skill of luring and reclaiming of birds of the pray,

to cause them to flye at other birds, liuing either in the ayre, vpon the earth, or about
the vvaters: so hee is called a Faulconer, vvhose place and office it is to reclayme
such birds: vvherein, if vvee please to looke a little more neerely into the name,
it should seeme, that the later Frenchmen haue followed the elder and auncient
Frenchmen and Greekes in their giuing of names: For euen as the auncient Frenchmen
were of iudgement, that the name of Sacre, which the Greekes named 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , and
the Latines Accipiter, was the generall name, vnder vvhich should be comprehended
all birds of prey (howsoeuer that Sacre in French, and 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      in Greeke, be the speciall
name of a bird of prey:) euen so the Frenchmen of our time haue agreed together,
that the Faulcon should be the chiefe in his kinde, and affoord the generall name
(as by the way of surpassing excellencie) vnto all other birds of prey: because that
the Faulcon (compared with all the birds of prey) is the best of vving, and exceeding
all the rest in goodnesse, stoutnesse, and tractablenesse: as if a man were disposed
to lay, the Faulcon gentle, the Pilgrim Faulcon, the Tartarie Faulcon, the
Barbarie Faulcon, the Gerfaulcon, the Faulcon Sacre, the Faulcon Lanier, the Punician
Faulcon, and so of the rest.

                  What birds are good to make Hawkes of.
                  
                     NOw wee must not thinke, that all birds of prey are good and fit to
make Hawkes of, but onely such as are stout, and of a resolute courage,
and are able to flye at anie bird vvhatsoeuer, either vvater-fowle,
or land-fowle: of vvhich nature, there are tenne speciall and
seuerall kinds, being sufficiently knowne of euerie one, and for the most part verie
common to be had in Fraunce, that is to say, the Eagle, the Gripe, the Goshawke,
the Sparrow-hawke, the Gerfaulcon, the Merlin, the Faulcon, the Lanier, the Sacre,
and the Hobbie.
                  Foure of them flye from the fist, and kill at randome, as the Goshawke, the
Sparrow-hawke, the Gerfaulcon, and the Merlin: and foure of them lye aloft in
the ayre, as the Faulcon, the Sacre, the Lanier, and the Hobbie. As for the Eagle
and the Gripe, they are not anie thing knowne in France. A great part of these
birds (the Gripe onely excepted) haue the feathers of their traynes and vvings
verie much glistering for the most part. All of them haue their beakes and tallons
crooked, and they are almost like one vnto another, for they shew no difference,
except it be in greatnesse, seeing likewise that their colour doth diuersly change
according to their mues, vvhich cause them to be called Hagards, or Sores, all
one with that which is vsually done by dried Her
                        •
                     ings, vvhich are called Sores, or
red Herrings.
                  There are verie manie birds of the prey vvhich are rouers continually abroad,
neither can it be learned well from what place or countrey they come, nor vvhither
they goe: so that wee might alwaies remaine ignorant of what countrey our
Hawkes are, vvere vvee not giuen it to vnderstand by them vvhich vse to bring
Hawkes out of Italie, Germanie, and other strange countries. Such as bring vs
Hawkes, doe take them for the most part with lime-twigges, vvhich is the cause of
the crushing of their feathers, vvhich yet may at pleasure be taken away vvith
vvarme vvater.
                  But whether they be brought from farre, or bred neere about vs, for to reclaime and
bring them vnto the lure, first, they must not be taken out of the neast before they be
strong, and growne pretie great ones, and able to stand vpon their feet: for and if

they should be taken away sooner, yet they must not be handled, but kept in a neast
as like vnto their owne as may be. Afterward, as the time shall affoord, they are to be
set vpon blocks, or vpon some pearch, for the better preseruing of their feathers from
grating vpon the ground.
                  They must be fedde with liue meat as oft as may be, because it will make their
feathers to put forth the better. Notwithstanding, the meat and flesh that is more
than ordinarie good for them, is to feede them with the legges or necks of Hennes:
cold flesh is naught for them: Beefe, Porke, and such other, are of too strong digestion
for them, and especially the flesh of night-beasts, that is to say, such as flie
about in the night, and are 
                        ••
                     arce euer seene in the day time: such are the great Duke,
the little Duke, the Owle, the Shrich-owle, and the Bat: for if they should eate
thereof, they would die. The flesh of Pigeons, young Swallowes, and Mutton, is
farre better for them. Hennes flesh, being swee
                        •
                     e and pleasant, doth trouble the
belly of the bird, if she eate it cold: vvherefore, the bird that is greatly delighted
with such flesh, might possibly forsake the game, and seize vpon Hennes, if she see
any in her way as she is flying. Wherefore to meete with this inconuenience, you
must feede the bird with young Pigeons, or young Swallowes: the flesh of Pies
and old Pigeons is bitter, and bad for these kinds of birds: Cowes flesh is bad for
them, as making them too laxatiue, vvhich commeth by the heauinesse thereof,
vvhich causeth hard digestion. And if necessitie compell you to fe
                        •

                     e flesh, for want of better, let it be tempered and washed with warme water:
if it be in Winter, you must presse it: and in Summer it must be washed in cold
water. The flesh that you feede your birds withall, must be picked, that there bee
not fat sinewes or veines left vpon it. You must not suffer them to eate whiles they
will at once, but with some small distance of time betwixt, letting them rest in eating:
and now and then you must hide away their meate, before they bee full
gorged, and then afterward giue it to them againe: but when it is taken from
them, and also when it is giuen them, they must not see it, for feare of making
them bate.
                  Likewise it is good to make them plume vpon small birds, as they did in the
vvoods. Yearely in the beginning of Autumne they must be brought downe by
laxatiue medicines, if they be too high: as namely, by giuing them Aloes vvith
their meate:

                        d. vvhich must be of some good, liue, and warme meate, for otherwise
they would be taken downe too much. After that they haue beene purged, you must
prepare them for the game: and againe, when you are purposed to flye them, it will
not be amisse to giue them casting of Towe, couered with flesh, and made in forme
of a pill, and that at night, to the end they may cast it vp againe in the morning,
with much more flegmaticke matter: for by this meanes they will become more
healthfull, of a better appetite, more emptie, swift, and readie for the prey.

readily: but you must obserue and see that she be put in a warme place after she
hath beene purged, and withall, to feede her on your fist with some liue bird, for
at such times her entrailes are much dried. They are discerned to be sicke, vvhen
their fundament swelleth and becommeth red,

Egypt: knowne in this countrey rather by his skinne and feathers, than
otherwise, because the Skinners are wont to make stomachers to lay ouer
the stomacke, and the Fletchers feathers thereof, to set vpon arrowes. They may be

of them, that ordinarily they follow Campes, because of the dead bodies. They cannot
rise from the earth to flie, except they first take their aduantage by running, or else
take their leaue vpon some great butt.
                  The Eagle is called the King of birds: very vnhandsome to carrie vpon the fist, by
reason of his corpulencie: hard to reclaime, being once wild, because of his boldnes,
might, readines, and easie inclination to hurt the Faulconer in the fate, or elsewhere.
Wherfore, who so desireth to haue him good, must take him in the neast, and reclaime
him with coursing-dogges, to the end, that when he is to flie, he may follow them, that
so they hauing put vp the Hare, Foxe, Roe-buck, or any other such beast, he may seize
vpon it to stay it. He may be fed with any manner of flesh, especially of such beasts as
he taketh and seizeth vpon. The Faulconer must be diligent to attend him well, because
he is very apt to flie away: but that mischiefe may be preuented, by sewing the
feathers of his traine in such sort, as that he cannot spread them to flye with them: or
else by plucking bare the hole of his fundament in such sort, as that it may appeare:
for thereupon he being driuen into a feare of the cold, he will not be hastie to

high. The Eagle is knowne to be good and faire, when he is of a red colour, hauing
deepe eyes, and a whitenesse vpon his head or back.
                  The Sparrow-hawke &amp; the GoshawkeThe Sparrow-hawke and the Goshawke. differ not in any other point than in greatnesse
and strength: because the Goshawke is of a stronger nature, and therefore not so
soone sick as the Sparrow-hawke: they are both of one kind, as are also the Rauen and
the Iay, the great dogge and the little one, and both of them are of two sorts, either
such as are taken abroad in the woods, or else such as are taken young out of the neast.
Of this sort there is good choise to be made, in respect of their aptnesse to learne; as
also of those which are fliers, but haue neuer mued their feathers, neither made any aire,
or fed any young ones.
                  The goodnesse and fairenesse of a Sparrow-hawke is knowne by their being great
and short, and yet hauing a little head and somewhat round aboue, a thicke beake, the
eyes somewhat hollow, and the circle about the apple of the eye of a colour betwixt
greene and white, a long and somewhat thick neck, open in the place where the reines
lie, sharpe towards the traine, not very long, set with good and large feathers, hauing
flat and short legges, sharpe

                  And though here,The Goshawke more worthie than the Sparrow-hawke. for the familiaritie and common vse we haue of them, I put the
Sparrow-hawke before the Goshawke; yet it is to be vnderstood, that the Goshawke
is a great deale the more worthier Hawke, both in respect of her beautie and comelinesse,
as also in respect of the worth &amp; estimation of the prey she killeth: for amongst
Faulconers, that Hawke is held worthiest which killeth the greatest prey: The Mallard-killer
be valued before the Partridge-killer, and the Hearne-killer before the
Mallard: so the Sparrow-hawke, which is most vsuall for the Bush and Blackbird, at
the most can aspire no further than the killing of a Poo

                     e, or a Partridge, cannot compare
with a Goshawke, which killeth not only the Partridge, but the Phesant, Hare, &amp;

As for the sparrow-hawkes, they are bred both in France, England, Ireland, and many
other countries, and very good and hard hawkes in all those places: yet are some
ayryes better than other some, according to the scituation of the place, and temperature
of the ayre, for such as are bred in warme climats, and where they pray but vpon
small birds, as sparrows, robbins, wrens, linne

of the wood so good as the ayre of the rocke, because their pray being so neere vnto
them, they do not labour or take that

which buildeth highest and vpon the tallest timber trees is the best, because it sheweth
courage in the mount, and those which build low and neere to the springs are
worst, for it shewes a faintnesse of spirit and a sloathfulnesse in nature. Now though
the best taking of either of these hawkes (as before I said) is when they are branchers,
and are able to follow their dams from bough to bough, and to foot the pray which
she killeth for them: yet some Faulconers loue to take them from their nests, as soone
as they be disclosed, and to bring them vp in such maner, as they may know no other
damme but their keeper, being persuaded that such familiaritie and long acquaintance
with the man, makes them more louing, and lesse apt to take toy and flie away
than the other by many degrees,Differences and

that you shall be a much longer time in entring them or making them foot the praie
than the other, because they will expect euery thing from the keeper, and rather flie
and sit vpon his shoulder than labour or striue for the pray which flies before them:
therefore howsoeuer the care of holding or keeping your hawke fast vnto you, may
intice you to esteeme the Iiaes hawke, yet you shall euer find the ramage or brancher
much lesse troublesome, and fitter for your purpose.
                  The way to take them is thus: the birder must bee hid behind a bush, and before
the bush a plaine or smooth aire, but foure square, and six sticks prickt downe about
it of the thickenesse of ones thombe, and of the height of a man, three on euery side:
to these stickes you shall tie nets of greene threed that is very small, and to them a
small line or cord, which shall be at the commaund of the man that is hid behind the
bush: within the aire there shall feede diuers small birds, especially spinks, or chaffinches,
whereupon the sparrow hawke will not faile by and by very fiercely to flie
into the nest, thinking to take the birds, but indeed becomming fast, and ouercast in
the nets: then the birder shall take her, and bind her wings below, together with her
legs and traine, that so she may not struggle or beat herselfe.
                  They are purposely woont to hide themselues in Winter vpon long poles, amongst
high and tall trees, vnder some small and slender tree in some hedge row: they are reclaimed
by keeping them long, and oft vpon the fist, but especially at the breake of
day: they must be fed twice a day, or once, as when it is determined to flie them the
day following; for then she must be kept sharpe, that so she may bee the more eager
vpon the pray: which likewise they will performe if they haue put off their gorge
of the same day, which is perceiued by the emptinesse of their gorge. They mue
yearely in March or Aprill, and at such times they must be kept in warme places, or
in such places as where the South Sunne shineth against some wall. Their meat must
be of good flesh, as birds or mutton, that so they may become very far: the sparrow

hawke is apt to flie away: but to preuent the same, her keeper must be carefull to do

When he goeth forth to flie her, he must not let her range any farre way off, because
that if she mis

                     e of the bird she flieth at, she goeth for anger, and flieth to some tree,
refusing to returne againe to her keeper: he must not flie her too oft, but content
himselfe with what she can reasonably take, giuing her of her prey to feede vpon,
that so she may perceiue and find, that her prey is something worth vnto her, and
thereby become the more freely stirred vp to flie. The birds which she taketh, are
the Partridge, Quaile, Stare, black-Bird, and other such like. For to flie her at smaller
birds, as the hedge-Sparrow, Linne
                        •
                     , and such like, is not good, because being
naturally coy, and apt to find fault, it will entice her to carrie and flie away with
the prey in her foot, to which they are more apt than any other Hawke whatsoeuer:
and hauing once found a tast or spice thereof, they are euer after verie hardly reclaymed.
It is good to enter your Sparrow-hawkeHow to enter your Sparrow-hawke. first at the Partridge, vvhen the
game is verie young, and not able to flie either farre, or aboue one flight at most,
that thereby she may get bloud quickly, and so be encouraged to flie the game
home: vvhereas entring her at strong game, such as are able to flie farre, and oft,
missing the first or second time, she will take such a distrust to her wing, that not being
able to trusse or foot them at the first springing, she will presently turne tayle,
and refuse to flie further. There be some that vse to enter their young Sparrow-hawkes
at the hand Partridge seeled, in this manner: They take the Partridge,
being seeled, and a long creance fastened to her feet, and then comming into the
field, in a place likely for haunt, digge vp a round 
                        •
                     odd, and lay the Partridge into
the hole: then couer the Partridge with the sodd, so as it cannot rise, and to the
sodd also fasten another creance: and then encouraging the Spanyels to hunt, and
making such a cheerefull noyse vnto them as Faulconers are wont to doe in such
like cases, on the suddaine plucke the sodd from the Partridge, and let her spring in
the full view of the Hawke: then let off the Hawke after her, and hauing footed
her, feed her very well vpon the same: and thus doe twice or thrice, but no oftener
in any case, least the Hawke finding your deceit, and her owne

                     ase, looke so much
for it, that she will refuse to flie at any other game. And these flights are called traines,
because they only traine or teach a young Hawke how to bestow her wing, and make
her selfe victor ouer the prey she seeketh: yet these must be vsed but onely at the beginning,
and not often, for feare of the inconuenience before rehearsed. Some other
old Faulconers enter their Hawkes at the Quarrie, which is, when an old Hawke hath
flowne the Partridge to the marke, and is vpon her wing readie to attend the retriue,
then to let in the yong Hawke to the old, that they may both come to the death of the
Partridge together. This is also a good manner of entring of Hawkes▪ but is fitter and
more oftener vsed for entring of Hawkes at the riuer, than at the field, because those
often stoopings at the riuer makes a Hawke more expert and cunning, and she standeth
in much more need of instruction and example in that▪ than in the other.

                  The Faulcon (as we haue said) in the art of hawking, is sometimes a generall word
taken for all kinds of hawks, sometimes it is taken for a speciall word, and according
to that sence, there are diuers sorts of that name, which I omit to intreat seuerally of,
because of such as haue written of the nature of birds: but howsoeuer, the Faulcon
is the prince of the birds of pray (I meane in respect of flight) for her stoutnesse and
great courage, and is to be accounted of great value, when she hath a round head, and
the top of her head is full, her beake short and thicke, her nostrels great and open,
her eie browes high and thicke, her eies great and cloaked, a long necke, a high brest,
large shoulders, the feathers of her wings thinne, long thighes, short and chicke legs,
greene, great, and well spred feet, blacke, sharpe, and pearching

The Faulcon, as all other birds of prey, hath her Tiercelet, and they are called of
the Latines Pomiliones, that is to say, small birds, resembling them, and nothing differing
from them, saue onely in greatnesse: and they are all of them (as it were) the
males of the birds of prey, the females being, for the most part, of greater bulke and
bodies than the males. That of the Faulcon is called nothing but a Tiercelet, or the
male Faulcon. The Tiercelets of the other Hawkes haue their proper names: as, the
male Sparrow-hawke is called a Musket: the male Lanier, a Laneret: and the male
Sacre, a Sacret. The Tiercelet of the Faulcon hath his feathers ver
                        •
                     e glittering, his
head and eyes black, ash-coloured vpon his back and traine, and yet glittering. He is
a Hawke for the lure, as also the Faulcon, and not for the fist. His legges and feet are
yellow, hauing for the most part a pale breast: he carrieth two very black spots vpon
his feathers, on the sides of his eies. To reclaime the Faulcon, you must haue him commonly
vpon your fist, feed him with the wings and legges of Hennes soked in water,
and set him in a darke place: sometimes presenting them with a bason full of water,
wherein they may bathe themselues, and after their bathing, drie them at the fire: they
must be vsed first to take small birds: then, indifferent great ones: and afterward, greater
ones: but you must not feed them with any part of the birds which they shall haue
taken. They flie maruellous swift, and mount very high, there houering and soaring,
but withall, still looking downeward: and when they see the Duck, the greene Goose,
Crane, or Heron, they come downe like an arrow, their wings shut and drawne together,
right vpon the Fowle, to breake in vpon her with her tallons behind: at vvhich
time if they happen to mis

and if they cannot seize vpon her, as enraged and angrie, they take so long a

                     on is more fit than any other Hawke to flie the Heron, and all other fowle
of the riuer. Her diseases, and the curing of them, are like vnto those of the Sparrow-hawke:
howbeit, the Faulcon is of a stronger nature than the Sparrow-hawke.
                  The Hobbie is the least of all Hawkes in respect of bodie, except the Merlin, and
is likewise for the lure, and not for the fist, being of the number of those that soare aloft,
as the Faulcon, the Lanier, &amp; the Sacre. This bird is sufficiently knowne euery where:
for there is not any country where the Hobbies doe not follow the hunters, in as much
as it is the proper worke of the Hobbie to make her prey of the little birds as they flie,
as by name, the La
                        •
                     ke. This is his speciall propertie, that hauing found the hunters in
the field, going to hunt the Hare or the Partridge, he keepeth them companie, still flying
ouer their heads, hoping to meet with some one little bird or other which the dog
                        •
                     
shall put vp: but for the most part these little birds doe rather chuse to become a prey
vnto the dogges, or else to find out some means to saue themselues amongst the horses,
or to be taken aliue, than to commit themselues to the mercie of the Hobbie, their mortall
aduersarie. But howsoeuer, the Hobbie will not follow the hunter longer than a
certaine time, as though he had his houres limited him: for leauing them, he goeth to
looke out the place of his rest amongst the vvoods of high timber-trees, vvhere they
keepe and pearch ordinarily. He hath a blew 
                        •
                     eake, yellow legs and feet, the feathers
vnder his eyes very black, the top of his head betwixt black and a darke yellow, two
white spots aboue his necke, but vnderneath his throat, and on either side of his temples,
russet ones: his wings very blew: his back, traine, and wings, black on the vpper
side: his traine very much consisting of variable colours vnderneath, by reason of
red spots traced ouerthwart amongst the blacke. If you can see him flying in the
ayre, he may be perceiued to be somewhat red vnder his traine, and betwixt his
legges.
                  The Hobbie is so quicke and swift, as that he dare aduenture vpon the Rauen, and
giue him many a drie bob in the ayre.
                  He is chiefely esteemed for the sport of darying of Larkes,The vse of th

inclined, because it is the prey in which he most naturally delighteth: and the manner
of daring of Larkes is in this sort. When you see a Larke play and flie neere vnto the
ground, quiuering her wings, and making a gentle noise in the ayre, you shall then

presently thereupon will spread them abroad, and waue them in the vvind, at vvhich
sight the Larke will leisurely stoope downe to the ground, and there lye close, as if
she were vnperceiued, vvhilest you in the meane space shall with your Horse and
Hawke ride about her, and about her, till you come so neere her, that you may lay
your daring-net ouer her: vvhich net is a little round net like a Pursnet, not aboue a
foot or two ouerthwart, and fastened bought-wise vnto the end of a long pole, like a
Hawkes pole: as soone as you haue couered the Larke, you shal light and take her vp,
and giue your Hawke the head onely. This is a sport very delicate, and of long continuance,
and therefore much respected amongst ladies and gentlewomen.
                  The Merlin is the least of all other Hawkes which Faulconers make any vse of: he

and conditions: vvherefore he must be reputed as royall as the Faulcon, or at least of
the same linage and nature with the Faulcon. He is very stout of courage: for although
he be not much bigger than a Black-bird or Pigeon, yet he dareth to aduenture vpon
the Quaile and Partridge, and such other birds greater than himselfe: and his courage

male is called the Iack Merlin, and is as the male of other Hawkes, a great deale lesse
than the female, and indeed are so very little, that they are of very small or no vse: the
female is called the formale, and being much larger, valiant, and full of courage, they
will sley the Partridge all Summer long. These Merlins are of all Hawkes the tenderest,
and can the least endure cold of any bird vvhatsoeuer, especially of their feet:
vvhich being once nipt vvith frost, and benummed, they presently vvill eate them
of themselues, and so become lame and vselesse. Therefore vvhen you mue them in
the Winter time, you shall mue them in a very warme and close house, and vpon a
pearch very well lined and couered with thicke lists, or other vvoollen cloth. Some
vse to line their pearches with Cony-skinnes, or other furred skinnes, turning the furred
sides outward, but that is somewhat too hot, and makes them more tender and apt
to feele the cold than otherwise they would be: vse then a moderate temper of warmth,
and no further. Of all sorts of Merlins, the Irish MerlinThe Irish Mer

any time troubled with this infirmitie: and you shall know her by her pale greene legs,
and the contrarie Merlin by her bright yellow legs When they haue flowne all Summer
at the Partridge, you may make them for the bush in the Winter, and so haue
them flying all the yeare; vvhich is the best course that can be taken with them:

as sit to flie at the riuer, as any other hawke vvhatsoeuer, hauing a naturall loue to all
manner of water foule, and continually when he is vvild, making his prey vpon the
same.
                  The Sacre being a principall bird amongst those of the prey, is like vnto the Faulcon
in greatnesse, a hawke that is good for the Kite, but hee may bee made fit for any

is of a colour as it were betwixt red and smokie, short sooted, hauing blew legs and
talons. It is a vvandring bird, and seldome found in this countrie: her Teirselet is the
Sacret; so that the Sacret is the male, and the Sacre is the female. Noble men desirous
to haue some sport betwixt him and the Kite, do first make the Kite to stoope (for the

other Faulconer to carrie a ducke vpon his fist, hauing a certaine quantitie of a Fox
taile hanging thereat, thus letting her fle in some plaine ground, they giue the Kite
occasion to stoope: for vvhen the Kite is aduised of the Ducke, he stoopeth by and
by vnto the ground, and drawing neere vnto her, doth there keepe himselfe without

doing any other thing, but beholding of her, as maruelling at her forme: Then the
Sacre is to be cast off at him, who thinking himselfe swift, hopeth by flight to ouertake
him: wherupon the Kite mounteth vpward, turning round therewithall as much
as he can: and so the combate becommeth pleasant to behold, especially if it be in a
plaine without trees, and that the aire be cleare, and without wind: for one shall see
both the Sacre and the Kite to mount so high, as that they will be both out of sight:

than any other Hawke, men are wont to content themselues with him, causing him to
serue their purpose euerie way. Faulconers chuse those Laniers that haue great heads,
short bills, blew and yellow feet, their fore-feathers of a mixture of black and white,
not hauing ouerthwart strakes, as the Faulcon, but straight spots going along the feathers,
a short and somewhat thicke necke, as also a bill of the same fashion. The Lanier
is the female, and the Lancret is the male, and hath not so bigge a bodie as the female,
neither yet so well esteemed of, but as for the rest, he is almost like the female in
plumage. There is no kind of bird that keepeth his pearch more constantly. He abideth
with vs in Winter, and is to be seene of vs at all times, contrarie to the fashion of
ethers, which keepe not in our countries but in the Summer time. Fa
                        •
                     lconers, when
they would make the Lanier a forrester, they put him in a lower roome, so dark, as that
he can see nothing, except at such times as he is fed: and likewise they neuer carrie
him vpon their fist, but in the night.
                  And when that he is readie to flie, they make a fire in the chamber for to heat him,
that so he may afterward be bathed in pure vvine: and hauing dried him againe,
they giue him to feede on, the braines of a Henne: then getting forward before day
toward the place vvhere the game is, they cast him off a good way from the place
vvhere the Crane is, at such time as it beginneth to be day: and though he take him
nor the first day, it is all one, for it will be as good in the daies following, and
especially from after mid Iuly, vntill towards the end of October. And yet after
the mue, hee vvill bee better than before: but it is not good in the time of
Winter.
                  Yet to speake truth of the Lanier, he taketh more delight to prey vpon the Partridge,
than vpon any other fowle whatsoeuer, because the flight doth not mount
much, to vvhich he hath no affection. He is of so strong and good a constitution,
that his grease seldome or neuer melteth to his hurt or preiudice: neither is he so
foolishly ouer-free of courage, that he will hurt himselfe with too much violence,
or paines-taking. Whence it comes, that his owner can seldome ouer-flye him, no,
though he flye him sixe or seuen

called the Schollers Hawke, as being an excellent encourager of young Faulconers,
and a bird on vvhich, vvithout danger, they may trie all needefull experiments.
                  Thus much of the manner of luring and reclaiming of Hawkes, as well in generall
as in particular: and yet it remaineth that wee speake a word or two concerning
the same matter.
                  You must vnderstand, that all birds of the prey doe serue to flie either vpon riuers,

this sort is the Goshawke, the Sparrow-hawke, the Gerfaulcon, and the Merlin: The
others flie on high, as namely, the Faulcon, the Lanier, the Sacre, and the Hobbie: the
one of them is called from the flight, by holding out the fist vnto them, and the other
by casting out vnto them the lure, that is to say, an instrument made after the fashion
of two fowles wings coupled together, hung at a leash, and at the end thereof a tennise-ball,
or crooke of horne: for by these lures the Hawkes are allured, thinking them
to be liue Hennes.

hawke, as touching his shape, but looking into the cowardlinesse of his nature, he is
far vnworthie to ranke in their societie. The short-winged hawkes do properlie belong

They neuer take their wing till they see their pray on wing before them, and
then they make a maine after it, and flie it to the marke, where presently they take a
tree, hillocke, or some other stand, as neere the place as possibly they can, and there sit
till the spannyells come into the retriue: but the long-winged hawke neuer taketh
stand at all, but flying about and about grathereth vp againe to her first pitch, and

we haue said of the Eagle. To be briefe, hawks seeme not to differ, saue that all of them

hawking, and now wee will enter into some speech of taking of birds,
which sing melodiously with sweet and pleasant songs, wherewith the

them sing in his closes, parke, low-woods, and high-woods, or in his chamber window,
or else shut vp in some cages or roomes made for the purpose to containe the
sub
                        •

thing, before we set downe any manner or way of the particular taking of such birds,
we will take a briefe view of the nature, feeding, and diseases of the same, For it were
but lost labour to take the birds, if to the end that we may haue their sweet and melodious
songs a long time, wee knowe not what meat is good for them, what diseases
they are subiect vnto, and what meanes and remedies are necessarie for their distemperatures.
In the meane time I mind not here to bring in the fabulous histories touching
the originall and breeding of the most part of them, which fantasticall Poets
haue inuented. I meane to rest my selfe in this only persuasion, namely that all birdes
were miraculously created of God by his almightie power, that is to say, of his own
meere will and word, whereby likewise he did create all other creatures in the beginning
of the creation of the world.

the waste grounds: and other some of them make it in a place somewhat raised, as
vpon some greene and thicke grasse growne, clod of earth or butte. The number
of their egges is vncertaine, for some of them lay foure, and some fiue, and those
which nestle in Summer, lay (according to Aristotle his assertion) sometimes sixe or
seuen. Now the Nightingale which you would keepe, must bee bred in the Spring;
for how much the earlier bird she is, by so much will she become the more perfect,
and you may haue better hope and assurance of her longer liuing, and of her being

they be growne vp, you shall put them in cages, made fit with little stickes and
pearches, to the end they may begin of themselues to stand vpon their legs: and
within the said cages, you must put mosse, hay, or chaffe, whereupon they may rest
themselues, if so be they will not sit vpon the pearches, alwaies taking heed to keepe
them cleane as much as may be. It will be requisite also, that their cage haue not any
light but on one side onely, and for this cause, such as are most carefull, do hang their
cage for the space of three whole parts of it with greene cloth. When you know

neuer want any of the foresaid meate, and withall that it stinke not, as it falleth out
oftentimes in Summer. Besides the heart of the Weather, you may giue her diuers
other sorts of meat, as the paste whereof we will speake hereafter for one: or in steed
of that paste, take a new egge (for else it might cause some disease to breed in her, and
bring her easily to her death) boile it hard, giue her the yelke to eate. It is true, that
you must not giue it her oft, or not at all, except it be for want of their meat, because
it is giuen to bind them in their bodies, and make them continue. You may likewise

feed them with certaine wormes which are found in a doues nest, or else in old flower
of meale: but this must be done as seldome as may be, because that such meate should
rather be vnto her as physicke, than ordinarie food, as we shall say hereafter. If shee
will not picke vp these meates, she may haue them mingled amongst her meate of a
sheepes heart, that so she may learne to feed of whatsoeuer shall be set before her.

which by their crauling will stir vp the bird to picke them, wherefore for the first
time you shall giue her them aliue, whereas afterward you may cut and mince them:
the third time you shall begin to feed her with a sheepes heart shred small, mingling
amongst the same of the wormes afore mentioned likewise minced and knodden together,
for to accustome her to the said heart. And if you perceiue that the bird doth

leaue off to giue her them mingled and tempered with the sheepes heart by a little

of the said heart without any mixture all alone: you may do the like with the paste,
if you perceiue that she doth eate it willingly, which thing is easily discerned by any
man of iudgement.

                  To bring vp Nightingales that are taken in March.
                  
                     IT is true, that the Nightingales which are taken after the first of March
vnto the middest of Aprill are very fit to keepe and bring vp.To bring vp Nightingales taken in March When
therefore you haue a Nightingale of this season, you shall put her in a
cage well wrapt about with paper, for feare that vpon the

                     ight of any
man, she should beate her selfe and crie, as also to the end that she may learne to eate
alone. For to do this, you shall haue a vessell of glasse like a cuppe without a foote,
wherein you shall put seuen or eight small wormes, and set them neere the bird, who
seeing them craule within the glasse, will by and by for enuie at them fall of p

them, wherefore you shall giue her them quicke for the first time. The second time
mince and cut them small: and when you see that she eateth well of such meate, you
shall take of a sheepes heart well beat and cut, and mingle it with the said wormes,
and making thereof as it were a paste, giue it her to ea
                        •
                     e. But if you perceiue, that in
feeding, she chuse to eat of nothing but the wormes, leauing the heart, you shall indeuour
your selfe to mixe it with all possible care and cunning, that so in eating she may
not chuse but eate of both together, that is, both of the wormes and of the heart.

And when she is accustomed to eate of this mixture, you shall by little and little
take away the wormes, and feed her only with the heart. Let it not be found strange
vnto you to see your Nightingale continue some daies without eating. For the cause
why it so falleth out, is, because they are grieued for hauing lost their libertie, and
thereupon continue some time without eating or feeding of any thing; some, three
daies; others, fi
                        •
                     e or sixe daies; yea, eight or ten daies: whereat you must not maruel,
neither yet leaue off to feed them. For there are some old ones, which though they
bee hard to feede, become notwithstanding better singing birds than any of the
young ones.
                  If peraduenture the bird will not take any other thing than wormes, giue her a
birds bill full foure times a day, and three or foure morsells at a time, and not any
more, because of digestion, and when she shall haue accustomed to take the mixture
of the heart with the wormes, giue her twice a day onely, that is to say, morning
and euening, for to preserue and maintaine her. And this is the order and course that
yee shall take.

                     AS soone as the Nightingale beginneth to sing, it is a most certaine token that
she eateth likewise alone. There are some which make not any kind of
noise or sound for the space of eight daies; others of fifteene: and othersome
continue a whole moneth without singing. If they exceed this time
without singing, it is to bee thought, that either they are females, or else that they will

                  How to order a Nightingale which eateth alone, and singeth.
                  
                     WHen the Nightingale shall eate well by her selfe, and shall sing, you shall
take away by little and little the paper wherwith the cage was compassed
about, euery day a little, in such sort, as that the bird may not perceiue
it, couering the place againe from whence you shall take the paper,
with some greene, insomuch, as that all the paper being taken away, and the cage
couered againe with greene leaues, you shall by little and little accussome her to see
the light. For if that you doe otherwise, you will bee the cause of making her to
loose her singing, either for disdaine, or for feare, which will not come to passe, if you
order her as hath beene said. Notwithstanding that Elian in the thirteenth booke of

that bird to singing, which is not taken in her owne nest. Which opinion is found
to be most false by ordinarie experience: for very often it is seene, that old Nightingales

                  How the male Nightingales are knowne from the females.
                  
                     MEns opinions and iudgements concerning Nightingales (as namely to
know of whether sexe they be) are very diuers:Nightingales male and female. for some distinguish the
coke from the hen by their grosenesse, saying, that the cocke is the grosser
bird: others are of mind that the cocke hath a greater eie: some say,
that he hath a reddish taile: all which opinions I haue found to be far wide; for I
haue had perfect good Nightingales, and that a great number of them that haue
beene very small and little 
                        •
                      as also hens with all those markes which are assigned vnto
the cockes. Wherefore for a more sure and certaine signe, you shall rest vpon, and
trust to that which followeth: That is to say, when you haue a Nightingale taken
out of the nest, which shall begin to eate alone, without hauing of it cramd into her,
and shall record diuers melodious notes from day to day, contenting herselfe therein
some time with pleasing and beseeming noises, you may thereby assure your
selfe that the same is a male. But vnto this, you shall adde certaine other notes: as
namely, her quiet and peaceable abiding in her cage: her standing vpon one leg only,
and to hold on the warbling of her brest, which continuance is not to be found in
the hen: more than that, she goeth hopping and whistling vp and downe the cage
with a noise and song that is very much interupted and short. I will not denie notwithstanding,
but that sometimes the cocke may bee knowne from the hen by the
markes which some haue set downe before: but this is that which I affirme, namely,
that some are mightily deceiued by those markes, and that by their singing, the
Nightingales taken in August are most certainely and clearely knowne and discerned.
And as for those which are taken in March, the knowledge of them resteth,
not onely in singing, but also in the lower parts of the sexe which the cockes doe
put forth, but the hens doe not, for then is the time that birds do
                        •
                      couple together.
These therefore are the most certaine euident and infallible arguments, whereunto
you may trust and betake you selfe.

small, of a daintie tractable complexion, he singeth most sweetly, and is
not much inferior in this respect vnto the Nightingale. He is oftentimes
seene in Winter vpon the tops or roofes of houses, or vpon old ruines on
that side that the Sunne shineth, and whereas the wind may least annoy
him. He is to be fed in this sort: You must keepe him warme in his nest, giuing him
for his meate of a sheepes heart, or of a calues heart minced, in all points as wee haue
alreadie said, speaking of the Nightingale. He must be fed with a little atonce, and oft,
by reason of his digestion, being carefull that hee take no cold, and especially in the
night. For which cause, you shall put him in a cage, which hath some prettie prouision
made like a little chamber, trimmed with red cloth, and made as it were a little ho

Now when he shall be vsed to be fed, you shall feed him with some heart well beaten,
and small minced, &amp; sometimes you shal giue him of the paste that is vsed to be giuen
to Nightingales, which will do him no small good. And you shal giue him sometimes

flies to pecke for her greater ioy and speedier taming, and herein you shall vse
great diligence.

meate new euery day, least it should grow foure, and spoile the bird. When you haue
fed the bird, you shall make a little sticke like a tooth-picke, at the point whereof,
you shal tie a little cotton, you shall wet this tooth-picke in water, and with the same,
you shall wash the birds bill, that so there cleaue not vnto, or hange thereabout any

yeares in the cage, becommeth gowtie: now when you shall perceiue it, annoint

called the straitnesse or strangling of the breast, vvhich commeth of hauing

eaten some ranke or fat thing, and it is perceiued by the beating and paine before not

throat: wherefore you shall very handsomely open her bill, and take it from her with

she is subiect vnto.
                  
                     YOu shall vnderstand that the Canarie-bird is brought from the Islands
called the Canaries, and is of much account amongst vs, because shee
both commeth out of a strange countrie, as also because she is a good
singing bird. She is knowne from others by this, because she continueth
and heaueth the passages of her throate, in singing, more than any
other birds doe: besides, she is of a lesse bodie, and hath a longer taile; in so much
as the lesser they bee, the perfecter they be. On the contrarie, the great ones which
sometimes turne their heads behind them, after the manner of fooles, and for that
cause are called fooles, are the worst, and come from the Isles of Palm

flesh well. She is verie subiect vnto Impostumes, which happen vpon her head,
and those of a yellow colour, and they must bee annointed with butter or hennes
grease about three times: then leauing off to doe any more vnto them, for the space
of three daies, you shall then take them in hand againe, and open them gently,
whereupon you shall see comming out of them thicke matter, like vnto an egs yelk.
Which done, you shall annoint the said Impostumes very well with the foresaid
grease, and thus you shall doe as often as they shall returne. This bird is likewise troubled
with melancholie sometimes, and then the end of her rumpe would be cut and
wrung out very well, giuing her of these herbes, lettuses, beets, and such like. But and
if for all these things, you see that the Canarie-bird doth not amend the better; you
shall coole her with a little of the seed of melons, giuing it her to eate, and you shall
put into her water-pot a little Sugar-candie, twice, or thereabout, and that so much as

that the bird may vse it for a pearch, and rub her eies against it, for the curing of them:
which remedie will then be expedient, when you perceiue their eies to begin to shed
teares, and their feathers begin to stare and stand vp. When they shall bee troubled
with impostumes,

it good to teach you the way to heale them

pearches, that so they may not thereby take occasion to be hopping to looke for their
meate, and so thereby to labour and stirre their legge, because by stirring thereof,
they perish and are spoiled. And this course will likewise serue when any bird hath
her thigh broken. And I would aduertise you not to bind or swaddle it after the
manner of the world, for so you should cause some impostume to grow in the place
where you did bind and tie it. You shall doe that which hath beene said very easily▪
if you lay her meate in the bottome and lowest part of the cage; all manner of
pearching being cut off by the taking away of the rods and stickes which were in it
for that purpose, and keeping them in some by-place for feare, that by the hearing
of noise, they should beate and shake themselues, letting their legge or thigh which
they shall haue broken remaine vntied and vnbound; for nature will heale it, and
make it to grow together againe speedily.

                  The manner how to serue ones turne of birdes, when he would take
and catch them, and how to make them sing.
                  
                     NOtwithstanding that all birds, except the Spinke, do sing in Winter,
as by name the Finch, the Linnet, the Miskin, and other such like:
there are some found notwithstanding, which being come out of the
mue, do giue ouer their singing, because of the said mue. Wherefore
from the beginning of May you shall purge them, which you would vse for your
purpose, to catch other birds withall, in such maner as followeth. You shall giue them
in the first place of the iuice of beetes mingled with a little pure water, and the day
following, you shall giue them a leafe of the said herbe. The third day following, you
shall keepe them close in the house, setting them vpon the ground, that so they may
eate their meate vpon it, for the space of ten daies, withdrawing them by little and
little, day after day, from the light, into some obscure and darke place. And when
they haue thus pas
                        •
                     ed ouer ten daies, you shall giue them some beets againe, and shut
them vp in some square chest in a darke and by-place. At the euening, you shal dresse
them with a lamp, so dealing, as that the said birds may see the same light for the
space of two houres, during which time, you may make cleane her water-pot, changing
their mustard-seed euery eight day, and giuing them of the leaues of beets euery
fourth day, and euery twentieth day of the iuice therof, especially, vnto the spink,
being the most subiect of all others to become blind. And that you may keepe them
without lice, you must change their cage euery twentie daies, as also for another reason,
which is because of the filth and stench thereof, which might easily kill them.
Thus you must still be practising of these courses, vnto the tenth of August, which
terme being expired, you shall purge them anew in like manner as before, suffering
them by little and little more freely to see the light, vntill the twentieth of the same
moneth, taking heed that they come not in the Sunne. Thus they will serue you very
well to take and catch birds withall in September and October, and finally in all
the rest.

thirdly, in Iune.
                  If you will bring vp, and take any pleasure by the solitarie Sparrow, which haue
taken young in their nests, you must chuse the greatest and biggest, namely such as
are well couered with feathers, for else you shal neuer bring them to any proofe.

you shall open them, giuing them as much as a bird will hold in her bill three or
foure times. But and if you perceiue that they will eate of themselues, you may put
in their trough or meate-boxe, some of the foresaid heart, not giuing ouer notwithstanding,
to put it into their mouthes, vntill such time as they can eate alone. But
for such as open their bils, you shall feed them with the said heart, after that you haue

taken off the skinne round about, and the fat also, and that once euerie houre or
more, if you heare them crie and see them gape. Put in their cage a little straw or hay,
keeping them as neate and cleane as possibly you can; for if you do not, they will become
lame, or else die in a small time. Wherefore you shall do as hath beene said, vntill
they haue mouted, and afterward if you will keepe them in sand, it will be very
good: howbeit, I thinke it better to keepe them in hay all the Winter following.
And whenas they shall eate of themselues, their meate shall bee sheepes heart
small minced, and sometimes of the paste which is woont to be giuen to Nightingales.
And sometimes for an extraordinarie dish, you may giue them hard egges, as

                        . and she is as good to be eaten,
as to sing: she maketh her nest in hils full of snow and ice, vpon
high trees: it is made of the mosse of the wood mingled with earth,
and fashioned of a round forme with singular cunning, in the middest
thereof they leaue a hole, to the end that it may not fill with water through long and
continuall raine, which might proue to the drowning of her young ones. They breed
thrice a yeare, as other birds do, that is, in Aprill, May, and Iune.
                  The Throstle taken in the nest must be kept and fed in like manner as the solitarie
Sparrow,
                        
                           〈…〉

great ones. Furthermore, you must know that the Throstle is a great deale more delicate
and fine than the solitarie sparrow, and hath tenderer bones. So that to preserue
and keepe her aliue, she must bee kept very neate and cleane. See that the Throstle
which you would bring vp and keepe, be a great one, and well feathered: for if you
chuse her great, and that she begin to eate alone, and to mout, you shall bee the more

the bellie than the eare.

is hard to tame, if she be not taken in the nest: she wil be so vexed sometimes
as is maruellous, and a thing almost incredible, for being carried
from one place to another; and in this vexation, she will continue a
whole moneth without singing: yea there haue some bin seene which did neuer sing
againe after, except they were brought backe to their accustomed place.
                  The Larke, notwithstanding that she is disdainefull, doth not forsake her singing
in such cases, aboue two or three daies, as doth in like maner the Coirdale. These birds
make their nests vpon the ground, and in meadowes, and sometimes amongst the
corne. Their nests are made of the drie roots of herbs, and they breed thrice a yeare:

first in the beginning of May, then in the beginnig of Iune, and lastly about mid Iuly.
Notwithstanding they differ herein sometimes, according to the season and time,
as do all others.
                  These three sorts of birds, as they are of one and the same nature, so they are fed
and eate after one manner. For their ordinarie meate and feeding shall be no other
than that we haue said to be good for the other birds: namely, the heart of a sheepe
beaten and minced very small. If they eate not alone, you shall feed them very diligently
in their nests, according as you shall see it needfull. Looke to it, that they continue
not too long in their nests, for feare they should become lame. But after certaine
daies put them in their cage strawed with sand, and there leaue them day and night.
Being accustomed to eate alone, you shall giue them heart mingled with the graine,
called of the Latines Far, or else with paste which is made for Nightingales, and
therewith you shall feed them, till they become great ones, and stand vpon their feet.
Afterward you shall scatter some of the aforesaid corne called Far, amongst the sand
of the cage, to the end that the birdes may learne to know of themselues, the said
corne amongst the sand, and to pecke it now and then, continuing notwithstanding
to feed them, and to put into their mouthes of sheepes heart, according to your former
custome. But when these birds begin to mout, you may giue them hemp-

and serueth for to purge them.

                     PAste for the said birds (whereof we haue made mention before) must be
made after this manner: take the meale of white Cich-pease, and boult
it diligently with a boulter, as is vsed to be done with wheat meale, and
in such quantitie, as you shall see to be needfull. For example: Let the
quantitie of meale bee two poundes, with one pound of sweet almonds chosen and
husked, which afterward you shall

when paste for march-paines is to be made. Herewithall, you must haue three ounces
of fresh butter, which butter you shal put into a copper vessel tinned, and mixe therwithall
the said flower and almonds together. After that you haue done this, you shal
set the said vessell vpon charcole fire, that so it may not smell of smoake, s

little and little, putting thereto the yelkes of two egs, and a little saffron: when you
perceiue the butter to begin to melt, you shall furthermore drop into it of liquid honie,
so much as shall serue for the incorporating of the paste, and bringing of it into
cornes, still continuing to stir it with a spoone,

                     or feare the fire should make it burne
too. When you haue thus done, you shall take a Colander made with such holes,
as will let passe so much at once, as the birds (for which you make it) will eate.
And when the paste is thus strained through the Colander, and the cornes made in
such quantitie, and qualitie, as is requisite for the necessitie of the birdes, you shall
take the past which could not passe through the said Colander, so far forth as that the
whole may come to be of a iust consistence. And for the keeping of it, you must poure
honie aboue, handling and stirring of it cunningly, and so you shall be stored of prouision
for sixe moneths.

neuer be cured: and this disease is perceiued by the trickling of teares from their
eyes, and by certaine feathers about their eyes, vvhich doe curle and crooke by turning
in againe.
                  The falling sicknesse is likewise incident vnto birds:

cured: for there is no other remedie for it, but to keepe the bird vvhich you bring vp,
from the Sunne in Summer: if she escape the first time, you must cut the nailes of her
feet, and besprinkle her well with good wine: purge her oft.
                  Some say,

                      That birds are subiect to the disease called the Pip: vvhich is false: for
the disease which they call the Pip, is not the Pip in effect, but another disease, which

groweth in the bills of birds, for which it is good to vse this remedie: Take the seed
of Melons, and steeping them in pure water, make them to drinke thereof three or
foure daies, and perceiuing the bird to grow better, you shall giue her a little fine Sugar,
tempered likewise with sugred water.
                  It is hard to know when the bird hath the disease of the rumpe:The disease of the rumpe. and for my part I
cannot tell how to giue you a better signe thereof, than her growing melancholike, as
by surceasing and abstaining to sing. The remedie is, to cut away halfe of the sharpe
point which she hath there, for you shall not deuise to do her so great good any other
waies. This is a griefe which all birds are troubled withall, euen those that are kept in
the cage.
                  Besides the diseases before named, birds haue sometimes the flux of the b

is known, by their making of their dung more thinne and liquid than ordinarily they
were wont, by the beating of their taile, and in that they keepe it close and neere together.
The remedie is, to cut the feathers of their taile, and those also which are about
the fundament, annointing it with a little oyle: And in stead of Hempe-seed,
you shall giue her the seedes of Melons for the space of two daies. But and if these
be birds which vse not to eate any Hempe-seed, but heart, or paste, deferre not to
take it from her, and in place thereof to giue her hard rosted egges, in such sort as we
haue said before.

is also subiect, besides the falling sicknesse, or giddinesse of the
head.

other bird,Linne

                  The Siskin,Siskin. on the contrarie, is not to subiect vnto diseases, both because she is of a
better complexion, as also of more strength. And this is the cause likewise why she
seldome times falleth blind.

                  Two only diseases doe voluntarily molest the Goldfinch,Goldfinch. that is, the subtile disease,
caused through old age, and impostumes, proceeding of the eating of Hemp-seed.

is more subiect vnto the gowt than any bird that is. The solitarie Sparrow is haunted
with impostumes and melancholie, which causeth her often to die. The CorydaleCorydale. falleth
blind sometimes, and sometimes she is troubled with the subtile disease. A

likewise is subiect vnto the subtile disease, apostemes, gowts: and that which is
worse, namely, to become quickly blind. The bird, called in Latine Thraupis, is likewise
very subiect vnto impostumes, and oftentimes dieth of fat. The strongest and
stoutest bird that can be, is the Blacke-bird,Black-bird. wherein I cannot find any disease to kill
her, except old age, which is the common maladie deuouring all mortall things. Fat

and impostumes doe sometimes hurt the Throstle, as also the disease of the rumpe,
which is likewise common to all birds that are kept in the cage.

to the water, and this will cleere her voice very exceedingly. The foresaid purgation
is very needfull when they are about to moute. The cage must neuer be without earth

that hath beene taken before, or is then taken. Some take a Sparrow,
being kept somewhat neere, and held in a snare, and make her crie, pinching together
her wings or legges, and then the birds will flocke about her to aid her, thinking,
that the Owle hath caught her: and hauing set lime-twigges or lime-bushes vpon
the branches of the trees, the birds that shall come to succour her, and lighting, will
be limed.
