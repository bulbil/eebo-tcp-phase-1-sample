            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

Theſe be Arithmeticke, Geemetrie, and Aſtronomie, from which this Art of Dialling taketh his beginning: a knowledge alſo ancient and neceſſarie, and therefore practiſed by Princes and famous men of former ages.

               Herodotus ſaith, that the Grecians learned this art, and the diuiſionLib. 2. of the day into twelue houres, of the Chaldeans. Diodorus writeth that one Hyperion firſt obſerued the houres. But if we may beleeue Macrobius, it ſeemeth that this Science came from the Egyptians: for they called the Sunne Horus, which by his motion limitteth to each houre his appoynted time.
            
               Vitruuius rehearſeth ſundrie inuentors of this Art of Dialling,Lib. 9. as Beroſus the Chaldean, Aristarchus Samius, Eudoxus, Theodoſius with others, who were renowmed, and liued many yeares before the birth of Chriſt. I need not here remember Architas Tarentinus, who by art made a Doue of wood to flie in the ayre: neither Archimedes, who defended Syracuſa againſt Marcellus,

                  . in Marcel. and affirmed that if he had a place to ſtand on, he would moue the earth with his engins: both of them no doubt skilfull in this Science.
            It was long after the inuention that this Art was knowne in Rome: for in the twelue tables was onely mentioned the riſing and ſetting of the Sunne, and after certaine yeares the midday was added. Then in the firſt Punike warre the Romanes obtayning victorie, there was a Diall brought amongſt other ſpoyles out of Sicilie. But in proceſſe of time they began to bee more common in Rome: for 100. yeares before Cicero his time, the paraſite in a Comedie, being hungrie, ſpake againſt the multitude of Clockes and Dials which were then in the citie, Optans vt ſuus cuique venter ſit horologium.
            
            
               Plinie alſo telleth of a Diall placed in the field of Flora atLib. 36. c. 10 
               Rome, which by the ſpace of thirtie yeares had not agreed with the Sunne: and the reaſon was as he thought, becauſe that either the Sunne had taken a new courſe, or els the earth was ſlipped from his Centre, wherein at the firſt it ſtood: or the ſtile was put awry by the ſhaking of the citie. Since which times learning ſpreading it ſelfe into diuers parts of the world, this Art hath been amongſt the reſt in great account.
            Concerning the profite of this Art, daily experience teacheth how needful it is in a well ordered Common-wealth, ſeeing nothing can be done in due and conuenient ſeaſon, where this

Science is neglected: for the diuiſion of the day into certaine parts or houres, (which this Art teacheth) doth limit and allot to each action his due time. This Art being then ſo ancient, and the vſe ſo neceſſarie, I truſt none will thinke this labour ſuperfluous, vnleſſe they be rude without ciuilitie, or ſuch as haue alwaies at hand a Diall of natures framing, of whom this verſe ſeemeth to be made:
            *Si tuus ad ſolem ſtatuatur naſus, hiantiMorus. Ore, bene ostendas dentibus hora quota eſt.
            Many haue promiſed (but none as yet performed) to write of this Science in our Engliſh tongue, which hath bin publiſhed in other languages, as D. Recorde long ſince, M. Digges, M. Blagraue with other, who if they would take the paines, I knowe could doe it with great commendation.
            Diuers haue written hereof in the Latin tongue, as Munſter, Schonerus, Orontius, Witekindus, Clauius and others: yet euery one differing from other in precept. Some teach the making of Dials by the helpe of the Globe, as Gemma Friſius: ſome by the Aſtrolabe, as the ſame Gemma Friſius and M. Blagr. which Inſtruments euery man haue not. Some vſe the table of Sines and Arithmetike, as Witekindus, which way as moſt plaine and eaſie, is obſerued in this booke; though in ſome kinds for want of triall Witekindus deceiued himſelfe. Munster vſeth a Rectificatorie with a circle, which is vnfit for ſmall plats, and faileth in greater, without great heed. Schoner wandreth in a wildernes of lines, that a man know not where to begin, or when to end. Vlmer hath not the Delineation of all kinds.
            Otherſome obſerue the rules of Geometricall proportion: which order alſo we thought to haue obſerued in all kinds, as we haue done in the South and North erect declining: but that ſundrie precepts of the ſame thing would haue bred tediouſnes and trouble to the learner, and the cutting of the Figures would haue been very chargeable. By meanes whereof we contented our ſelues with this one way here ſet downe, not doubting, but that euery one with ſmall paines may attaine to the making of all kinds of Dials in this booke expreſſed. As for a great part of them, euery Artificer may eaſily vnderſtand.
            
               Onely thus much I aduertiſe the vnlearned, that they muſt acquaint themſelues with ſome fewe Mathematicall principles, as to knowe what the Eleuation of the Pole meaneth, how a ſquire line is to be drawne, and ſuch like, which (if they want a teacher) they may ſufficiently learne by themſelues out of Records Castle, his pathway and ground of Arts, publiſhed in the Engliſh tongue: for theſe tearmes could not be auoyded, neither plainly deſcribed without much tediouſnes.
            We haue here added alſo examples and figures to euery kind, that ſo the precepts might appeare more plaine and eaſie: ſo that there is no plaine plat or wall howſoeuer it ſtandeth, or be placed either Declining, Reclining, or Inclining, but by the helpe of this booke you may drawe a Diall vpon it.
            If any man complaine of obſcuritie, he muſt knowe, that Difficilia quae pulchra, and yet ſmall paines ouercommeth all.
            The making of the Horologicall Cylindre, and the Ring, with ſome other Inſtruments, we haue preſently omitted, partly for their curioſitie in cutting and delineation, and partly becauſe (if occaſion ſerue) we will entreate of theſe kindes of Horologicall Inſtruments by themſelues, together with the making of all kindes of plaine Dials in this booke, preſcribed by the way of Geometricall proportion. In the meane while (gentle Reader) committing this booke to thy fauourable acceptation, and thy ſelfe to the protection of the Almightie, I end.

               THis booke, which ſeuen yeares ſince, was in a manner perfected (as you knowe) doth now vpon iuſt occaſion preſent it ſelfe to the view of the world: wherein you haue taken ſuch paines for the triall of each example, that I thinke none can finde any great fault, but ſuch as can ſee farre into other mens faults, and forget their owne. For after we found ſome precepts in Witekindus to be falſe, we were enforced to trie and examine with great care each figure and example in the Sunne. And therefore if any receiue benefite by this our trauell, I would you ſhould haue your due praiſe you deſerue.
            I haue altered ſome fewe things, and added the making of the South and North Erect Declining Dials, by the way of Geometricall proportion: becauſe thoſe kinds be moſt in vſe, and I would the learner ſhould haue his choiſe of the eaſieſt way.
            The grauer of the Figures was one M. Iod. Hondius, who hath ſhewed himſelfe an excellent workman in the great Globes ſet forth by M. Mullineux, and the Mappes of England for M. Camdens booke: and whether he hath performed like diligence in theſe, I referre it to your ſelfe to iudge. If any be deſirous to haue the Inſtrument mentioned in the beginning of this booke for the triall of plats, I hope you will helpe them to it: for being of your owne inuention, I know none ſo fit as your ſelfe to make it: on which Instrument alſo, it were conuenient to draw the Quadrant Horologicall, that ſo it might ſerue for diuers vſes.
            I truſt you will not be offended in that I leaue vnder our names this ſmall monument vnto the world, as a ſpeaking witneſſe of our thankefull hearts to this our Countrey, and a teſtimonie of our affection towards the Arts Mathematicall. Thus beſeeching the Lord (who hath endued you with extraordinarie knowledge in all Manuel Sciences) to finiſh that good worke of his heauenly grace alreadie begun in you, to his glorie and your owne comfort, I take my leaue. Commend me many times to your ſelfe &amp; all our good friends.
            
               From London,
                   Ianuary. 3. 1593.
               
               Yours, aſſuredly, T. F.
            
         
         
            
            Aduertiſements to the Reader.
            
            NOte alwaies, that in euery Diall the one end of the Stile muſt be placed directly towards the North Pole, and the other end towards the South Pole: for about theſe two ſtarres the whole heauens are moued, they remayning immoueable. The North Pole is a ſtarre in the North part of the heauen, being raiſed aboue the earth or our Horizon 52. degrees. And this changeth his height, if you goe Northward or Southward one degree in 60 miles: but Eſtward or weſtward it altereth not. The Eleuation of the Pole is the height of this ſtarre aboue the earth.
            Obſerue alſo, that the Subſtile is the line or place ouer which the Stile or Gnomon in your Diall directly hangeth. The ſpace betweene the Stile and Subſtile is the iuſt height thereof.
            One line cutteth another ſquire-wiſe, when they make right and equall angles.
            The Contingent or touch line, is that which is drawne by any poynt of another line or circle, ſo that it toucheth the ſame: and this line commonly in all Dials is drawne ſquire-wiſe to the Subſtile.
            A quadrant is the fourth part of a circle.
            The Meridian and twelue a clocke line are all one.
            I call theſe lines parallele which are euery where of like diſtance one from another: example whereof you may ſee in the Eſt and Weſt Diall, where all the houre lines be parallele.
            You may make all kinds of plaine Dials vpon one ſtone, if you prepare it firſt to be ſquare like a Dye, and then take off the eight corners, and all the ſharpe ſides, ſo ſhall you haue 25. plaine plats beſides the baſe, or foote whereon your Diall muſt ſtand.
            If any be deſirous to haue this Inſtrument readie made, let him enquire at the Printers, and he ſhall heare of them.
         
      
      
         
            
            
               The making of an Inſtrument to finde out the ſituation of any plat or Diall, and to place them already prepared. CAP. I.
               
                  FOr aſmuch as it is neceſſary before you can drawe my Dial, to know how your plat is already or ought afterward to be placed, it ſhalbe expedient to ſhew the making and vſe of an Inſtrument, whereby you may examine and try all plain plats and place all dials being ready made and prepared.
               Prouide therefore an halfe circle of Peare-trée, Walnuttrée, Bor, or any other cloſe grained and ſolide wood, being well ſeaſoned, ſo that the alteration of the weather at any time may not make it change from the firſt proportion ther of. Let it be perfectly tryed on both ſides of an euen thickeneſſe, halfe or thrée quarters of an inch thick or more if you will, and ſir or eight inches broad as you thinke good. The edge or ſide A. B. muſt be very right. Thē draw the Line C. D. thrée quarters of an inch equally diſtant from the ſide A. B. place one foot of your compaſſes in the centre E. which is the midſt of the line C. D. and with the other draw halfe a circle from C. to A. deuide it into two equall partes or quadrants, and laying your ruler vpon the centre E. and vpon this diuiſion drawe the line E. F. this done, deuide eche of

               The vſe of this inſtrument is in examining and placing the plat or dial. In immoueble plats, to know how they

ſtand, as if you would make a Diall vpon a wall, firſt you muſt vnderſtand whether the wall be erect or els recline or incline: then whether it be direct Eaſt, Weſt, North, or South, or els decline, which you cannot know without the helpe of this Inſtrument. Againe, in moueable plats for the placing of them, as if you haue made a South diall or any other kinde, by this Inſtrument you ſhall eaſily and perfectly place them.
               
                  The triall of a plat for a Horizontall Diall.
                  IF your plat ſéeme to lye plaine, making no angle with the horizon, ſet the ſide or diameter A. B. of your Inſtrument vpon it, and erect the plombrule right vp betwéene the two quadrants preciſely ouer the lyne E. F. then if the thread with the plommet hanging at liberty fall directly vpon his line G. H. which way ſoeuer you turne your Inſtrument, ſuch a plat is ſaide to make no angle with the horizon: and therefore the diall which is made vpon it, is called a Horizontall diall. In like maner may you place this kinde of dial being ready made parallele to the horizon, and by the help of the néedle direct the ſtile towards the North pole.
               
               
                  The trying of plats for Erect, Direct, South, North, Eaſt and Weſt Dials.
                  WHen the plat ſtandeth vpright, it maketh a right angle with the Horizon, and is called Erect, whereof ſome beholde one priucipall part of the world directly as the South, North, Eaſt, or Weſt: other decline as the South and North, toward the Eaſt or Weſt, of which kindes hereafter.
                  To examine an Erect plat, apply the ſide or diameter A. B. of your Inſtrument vnto it, the thread with the plommet on the foreſide hanging at liberty. If the thread fal vppon the line E. C. or E. D. the plat is Erect.
                  
                     This done, apply the ſaid line or diameter A. B. to y• plat, your Inſtrument being placed equally diſtant to the Horizon, and the plombrule vpon the line E. I. then if the néedle ſtand directly ouer his caracter, the end touched with the Loadſtone being next to the plat, that plat is called a South Erect Direct.
                  In the North all the foreſaid things are to be conſidered, except onely that the end of the néedle touched with y• loadſtone is fartheſt from the plat.
                  Theſe things knowen, you may eaſily finde out the Eaſt and Weſt Erect Direct, if either you haue a line drawen ſquire wiſe to the caracter of the néedle, or els if you place the plombrule ouer the line E. C. or E. D.
                  
                  And here note, that the Eaſt and Weſt, are not ſaide to decline, becauſe the declination is accounted from the ſouth and North, to the direct Eaſt, and Weſt pointes.
               
               
                  The examining of plats for Declining Dials.
                  ALl ſuch plats as beholde not ſome principall part of the world directly, are called Declining. The quantity of their declination is found out thus.
                  Apply the diameter A. B. of your Inſtrument to the plat, remembring to hold it equally diſtant from the Horizon. Then moue the plombrule vntill the néedle ſtandeth right ouer the caracter, and the point of the ruler, which toucheth the degrées in the limb, ſhall ſhew how many degrées and minutes it doth decline: either toward the Eaſt if y• plumbrule lye in the quadrant C. E. F. or toward the weſt, if in the quadrant D. E. F.
                  
               
               
                  The trying of ſuch plats as recline.
                  IF the plat ſtandeth not vpright, but maketh an obtuſe or blunt angle with the Horizon, it is ſaide to recline. The

degrées of reclination are found out thus.
                  Apply the diameter A. B. of your Inſtrument to the plat, the one end placed vpward, the other downward: thē moue the plomrule (the thread with the plōmet hauing frée courſe) vntill the thread hang preciſely ouer the line G. H. then the point of the ruler ſhall ſhew the degrées of reclination.
               
               
                  How Inclining plats are tried.
                  BUt if the angle which the plat maketh with the Horizon be acute or ſharpe, then it doth incline. The quantity of inclination is thus knowen.
                  Apply the diameter A. B. of your inſtrument to the plat, the thread with the plōmet of the former ſide hanging at liberty, and mark what degrée and minute the thrad ſhal cut, for ſo much is the inclination.
               
               
                  The manner of trying thoſe plats which recline and decline, or incline and decline.
                  IF your plat ſhall both recline and decline, or incline and decline: Firſt ſéeke out the reclination as hath béen ſhewed, and then the declination as in Erect declining.

D. cutting themſelues ſquirewiſe, that is, making right angles in the point E. vpon which make the quadrant of any circle from the line E. C. to the line E. A. or E B and write at C. the North, at D. the South, at A. the Eaſt, at B. the Weſt. And the line C. A. which here is the quadrant being deuided into 90. degrées or parts, the eleuation

of the Pole ſhalbe accounted in it (which in our example is 52. d. from C. to A. and at the ende of this number drawe a line from the centre E. which ſhalbe E F repreſenting the ſtile and artrée of the world. Then draw an other line K. L. by C. or by ſome other point of the line D. C. ſquire wiſe, ſo long as you can which ſhalbe called the touch line, or line of Contingence. Then meaſuring with your compaſſes the leaſt diſtance of the point O. and the line E. F. or the Stile, the one foot placed in O. which is the point of interſection, and the other extended toward E. where it ſhal chaunce to diuide or be placed in the line E.

                  paſſes a halfe circle vpon this centre for the equinoctial circle, from H. by C. to I. whoſe diameter muſt be equally diſtant to the line L. K. Then diuide this halfe circle into 12. equall parts: this done, lay a ruler vpon the centre G. and vpon euery marke or diuiſion made in the halfe Equator, and where the ruler ſhal touch y• line of contingence, there make marks or pricks, by which pricks draw lines from E. for the houres. E. C. is the 12. houre, E. B. the 6. in the morning, E. A. the 6. at euening, the reſt you may ſée in y• figure.
               And whereas in Sommer the 4. and 5. in the morning, and alſo the 7. and 8. at euening, ſhalbe neceſſary in this kinde of Diall: prolong or draw the lines of 4. and 5. at euening, beyond the centre E. which ſhall ſhew the houres of 4. and 5. in the morning. And likewiſe the 7. and 8. in the morning, for the 7. and 8. at euening.
               You may obſerue an order both in theſe and in all other erect direct dials, by diuiding the one halfe of the Equator, drawing houre lines for the forenone, and obſeruing the ſame diſtance from the meridian line, on the other ſide for the afternoone: for the line of the 11. houre in the forenoone is of like diſtance from the Meridian, that the 1. is in the afternoone, and the 10. as 2. and ſo of the reſt.
               When you would draw or make the halfe houres, you muſt diuide euery parte of the Equator into 2. equall parts,

                   the ruler and the line of contingence as you find in the

drawing of the houre lines.
               And this remember for the drawing of the halfe hourelines, not onely in this kinde, but alſo in all other kindes of dials, which afterward ſhall follow.
               The Stile muſt be fixed in the centre E. hanging directly ouer the Meridian line E. C. with ſo great an angle, as the lines C. E. F. make, declining from that on neither ſides.
               The Equinoctiall circle, the Quadrant, the line of the Stile and of Contingence, muſt be lightly drawen, becauſe they ought to be put out againe, in that they ſerue to no vſe but for the drawing of the Diall. And this likewiſe remē
                  ber in all other kindes of Dials, that the preparatiue or pricked lines muſt after the making of the Dial be omitted and extinguiſhed, as altogither vnprofitable.
               This and all other kindes of Dials may moſt fitly be drawen vpon a clean paper, and then with the help of your compaſſes placed on the plat.

               You muſt therefore on your plat make the quadrant of a circle A. B. C. which may afterward eaſilie bée put out, as all the other lines muſt bée, except the

houre lines: let the ſide A. B. be Perpendiculare: B. C. Parallele to the horizon, and let the arke beholde the South, which being diuided into 90. degrées, nomber therin the elenation of the Pole dounward from A. toward C. by the end of this number, and by the Centre B, draw a line ſo long as your plat will giue you leaue, whoſe South ende ſhall behold preciſely the Equinoctiall circle. At which end draw a circle whoſe diameter ſhall bee almoſt the third part of the line. Then draw another diameter or line in the centre, ſquire wiſe to the other, which ſhall ſhew the axtrée of the world, and be the line for the 6. hour. After ward at the cutward ſides of the circle, draw two contingent lines, one beneath, the other aboue, ſo that they may be Parallele to the middle line. Deuide each quarter of the circle into ſixe equal partes. Then place the ruler vpon the centre, and eache of thoſe markes or partes, and where it toucheth the lines of contingence there make markes in them. Afterward draw a line by thoſe two markes which be next to the 6. houre, in the lines of contingence, which may be equallie diſtant from the line of the 6. houre.
               In like maner doe with the reſt; ſo that you may haue in the Eaſt Diall, two aboue the 6. houre, the 4. and 5. in the morning, and vnder it 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. In the Weſt Diall like wiſe 7. and 8. in the euening aboue the 6. houre, and vnder it 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

               Fixe the Stile in the centre of the circle right vp from the Plat, ſo long as the Semidiameter of the circle is: only ſhewing the houre with the very top or end thereof. Yet it were more conuenient to haue it placed along ouer the line of the 6. houre, being a plate of yron or ſome other metall, being ſo broad as the Semidiamer of the circle is.

               Againe account in the quadrant from C. toward B. the declination of the plat being 50. degrées, and draw the line of Declination E. I. from E. to the end of this number.
               Then take your compaſſes, ſet one foote in the point C. extend the other vnto H. (which is the interſection point of the line E. H. with the line C. G.) and that ſame widneſſe remayning, place one foote in the centre E. and with the other marke the point 1. in the line E I. and from the point I. draw the line I. K. ſquire-wiſe to the Meridian E. C. placing K. at the interſection it maketh with E. C.
               
               Moreouer take with your compaſſes the iuſt length of the line I. K. and placing one foote in C. turne the other toward F. and make the point L. in the line C. F. drawe the Subſtile from E. by L. Let the line of Contingence bée drawne ſquire-wiſe to the Subſtile in the point L.
               
               This done, take the diſtance betwéene the centre E. and the point K. and place it in this line of Contingence from the point L. vnto M. and make the point M. that the line E. M. may be made from E. vnto M. for the ſtile.
               Meaſure with your compaſſes the leaſt diſtance betwéene the point L. and the Stile, and with the ſame widenes, one foote remaining in L. turne the other toward E. and make the centre O. in the Subſtile: vpon which deſcribe

the Equinoctiall circle. Then placing your ruler vpon O. being the centre of the Equinoctiall circle, and N. (which is the point of interſection of the Meridian and Contingent) marking where it cutteth the circumference, for there you muſt begin to diuide it into 24. equall partes, not withſtanding thoſe 12. are onely in vſe which are next the contingent.
               Finally, place your ruler vpon the centre O. and vpon the ſeuerall diuiſion points of the Equator, and where it toucheth the line of Contingence make markes, by which from the center E. draw the houre lines.
               Place the Meridian perpendicularly vpon the wall, the centre E. vpward, the Stile pointing downeward. Let the Stile hang directly ouer the Subſtile making an angle equall to E. M. L.
               
               
            
            
               
               The making of a North Erect Declining Diall. CAP. 8.
               
                  THe North Erect declining Dial differeth from the South onely herein, that the centre is to be placed downeward, the Stile pointing vpward to the North Pole, and that the Meridian repreſenteth the 12. houre at midnight and not at noone. Therefore if the declination bée toward the Eaſt, you muſt account the houre lines from that which is as it were the Meridian forthward 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 &amp;c.
               But if it decline toward the Weſt, number them backeward, 11, 10, 9, 8, &amp;c. omitting the firſt 3. which are before Sunne riſing and after Sunne ſetting in our eleuation.
               Let the line E. D. bée placed perpendicularly vpon the plat, and the Stile point vpward to the North Pole. Compare this figure with the former.
               
            
            
               
               Another way to make the South Erect Declining Diall. CAP. 9.
               
                  ALbeit we haue plainely and perfectly ſhewed the making of the South and North erect Declining Dials, in the two former Chapters; yet to ſatiſfie them that delight in variety; here is alſo declared another way, whereby you may make them, namely, by the helpe of Arithmetick, and the Table of Sines which isRead the 
                        •
                     ſe of the Table of Sines. placed in the end of this booke for this intent.
               Therefore the Eleuation of the Pole being knowen, and the Declination of your plat, by your Inſtrument found out:
               Multiply the Sine of the complement of the Eleuation, by the Sine of the complement of the Declination, diuide the product by the whole Sine (which is 100000) and you ſhall haue a quotient Sine, whoſe arke is the diſtance of the Stile from the Subſtile, which diſtance kéep.
               Then take the complement of this diſtance, and the Elenation of the Pole, and multiply the Sine of the leſſer by the whole Sine, parting the product by the Sine of the greater: the quotient Sine which ſhall come of this diuiſion, ſhall giue you an Arke, whoſe complement is the diſtance of the line of the Subſtile from the Meridian, which diſtance you ſhall likewiſe kéepe. For better inſtruction herein, conſider the example.
               
                  Example of a South Diall declining 45. d. Eleuation of the Pole. 52. d.
                  FIrſt I enter the Table of Sines, for the Sine of the complement of the Eleuation, which is 38. d. and I finde

it to be 61566. Then I looke for the Sine of the complement of the Declination, which is 45. d. and I finde that to be 70710. This done, I multiply the one by the other, and the product is 435333 1860. which I diuide by the whole Sine being 100000 wherof commeth a quotient 43533. With this quotient Sine I enter the Table, and becauſe I finde not the iuſt number, I take that which is next either greater or leſſe vnto it: (which you muſt alwaies remember to doe) for ſo ſmall a difference maketh no alteration, and therfore I take in ſtead thereof 43523. whoſe Arke is 25 d. 48. m. which is the diſtance of the Stile from the ſubſtile.
                  Then I take the complement of this diſtance, which is 64. d. 12. m. whoſe Sine is 90031. and the Eleuation of the Pole 52. d. whoſe Sine is 78801. and multiplying ye Sine of the leſſer, (which is the Eleuation of the Pole) by the whole, 100000. the product is 7880100000. which I diuide by the Sine of the greater, to wit, the Sine of the complement of the diſtance of the Stile from ye Subſtile, whoſe Sine is 90031, whereof commeth this quotient 87526 whoſe Arke is 61. d. 5. m. The complement of which arke is 28. d. 55. m. being the diſtance of the ſubſtile from the Meridian. Theſe diſtances being thus found out, the drawing of the diall foloweth.
                  Firſt draw a line Parallele to the Horizon A. B. out of whoſe middle point C. draw the Meridian line ſquire wiſe C. D. vpon the centre C. make the quadrant of a circle betwéene A. and D. Here vnderſtand that generally in all kindes of declining Dials, if the declination be towards the Eaſt, you muſt draw the quadrant towards the Weſt, (except in the South reclining declining, and the North inclining Declining, where the contrary is preſcribed) But if the declination be Weſtward, the quadrant muſt be drawen Eaſtward. Hereby you ſhall eaſily know on which ſide you ought alwaies to draw the quadrant, and which way the figures following doe decline. Your quadrant being made, diuide it into 90. degrées: number therein from D.
                     
the diſtance of the Subſtile from the Meridian, (which is 28. d. 55. m. Draw at the end of this number the line C. E. for the Subſtile. Then from E. towards A. account the diſtance of the Stile from the Subſtile, which is 25. d 48. m. and at the end hereof, draw the line C. F. for the Stile. Afterward by the point E. or in any place of the Subſtile draw the Contingent line G. H. ſo long as you can ſquirewiſe to the Subſtile. Then take with your compaſſes the leaſt diſtance betwéene E. and the Stile, the one foote remaining in E. and the other extended in the Subſtile toward C. place at the pricke there made with the compaſſes, I. vpon which pricke as a centre, the ſame widenes of your compaſſes remaining, draw a circle by E. which ſhall repreſent the equinoctiall or Equator. Then lay the ruler vpon the point I. and the interſection (whoſe marke is K.) of the line of Contingence and the line C. D. which is alwaies drawen ſo that it may cut the other) and where the ruler ſo placed ſhall touch the circle, there make a marke, and there begin to diuide it into 24. equall partes: notwithſtanding thoſe 12. onely are to be vſed, which doe beholde the contingent line. Then lay the ruler vpon the centre I. and the Contingent line by euery diuiſion of the Equator, and where it ſhall touch the line of Contingence, there make markes, by the which from the centre C. draw lines for the houres, ſo many as ſhalbe neceſſary.
                  The line C. D. ſhall alwaies ſhew the 12. houre, which muſt hang perpendicularly. Number the reſidue of the lines in their place, as they follow in order.
                  The line A. B. in ſuch as doe decline is vnprofitable, except it ſo chance that ſome houre line falleth in it.
                  Let the Stile be fixed in C. hanging directly ouer the Subſtile, with ſo great an angle, as E. C. F. is, declining on neither ſide.
                  Note diligently the making of this declining Diall, becauſe in thoſe which follow, we meane not to repeate thoſe things which héere haue béen taught. And this one kinde

well knowen, all the other will ſéeme moſt eaſie. For better vnderſtanding hereof beholde the figure.

               The making of a South reclining declining Diall. CAP. 14.
               
                  FIrſt, in this kinde, as in other which follow, you muſt finde out and place the Meridian, the Subſtile, and the Stile, which being done, that which remaineth is finiſhed as in thoſe before.
               Therefore the Declination and the Reclination of the plat being known by your inſtrument, multiplie the Sine of the Declination by

the Sine of the complement of the Reclination, diuiding the product by the whole Sine. The quotient Sine ſhall yéeld an Arke, whoſe complement ſhall be named the Complement to be repeated.
               
               Afterward augment the Sine of the Complement of the Declination, by the whole Sine, diuide the Product by the Sine of the Complement to be repeated: where of ſhall come a Sine, whoſe arke ſhalbe the diſtance of the Meridian from the Horizon.
               Againe, multiply the Sine of this diſtance, by the Sine of the Complement of the Reclination, parte the Product by the whole Sine, the arke of whoſe quotient ſhalbe called the Eleuation of the Meridian.
               
               Then compare this Eleuation of the Meridian, with the Eleuation of the Pole, and which you ſhall finde leaſt, ſubtract that from the greater, and that which remaineth kéep, (for it ſhall be called the difference kept) being mindefull which of them was the greateſt.
               This done, multiply the Sine of the Complement to be repeated, by the Sine of the difference kept: diuiding the Product by the whole Sine, whereof ſhall come a Sine, whoſe arke ſhalbe the diſtance of the Stile from y• ſubſtile.
               To conclude, compare the Complement of this diſtance, with the complement of the difference kept, and which you ſhall finde leaſt, multiply the Sine thereof by the whole Sine: part the Product by the Sine of y• greater, and thereof ſhall come a Sine, the Complement of whoſe arke ſhalbe the diſtance of the Subſtile from the Meridian.

                     m. is the complement to be repeated.
               This done, multiply 95105 the Sine of the Complement of the Declination 72. 
                     d. by the whole Sine 100000. the product ſhalbe 9510500000. which being diuided by 95996 the Sine of the complement to be repeated, the quotient ſhalbe 99071, whoſe arke is 82. 
                     d. 11. 
                     m. which is the diſtance of the Meridian from the Horizon.
               Afterward augment the Sine of this diſtance 99071. by the Sine of the complement of the Reclination, which is 90630. and the product 8978804730 part by the whole Sine: and the quotient 89788 ſhall yéeld an arke 63.

               Then compare the Eleuation of the Meridian, with the Eleuation of the Pole, which in this example is 52. 
                     d. and finding the Eleuation of the Pole to be leaſt, ſubſtract this namely 52. degrées) from 63.

               Now multiply 95996 being the Sine of the Complement to be repeated, which is 20591. the product is 1976653636. which diuided by the whole Sine, the quotient ſhalbe 19766, whoſe arke 11.

                  Marke therefore, if the Eleuation of the Meridian be greater then the Eleuation of the Pole, drawe a line parallele to the Horizon A. B. out of the middeſt whereof extend an other C. D. ſquire wiſe to the line A.

(which you may take where you wil in y• Subſtile) draw the line of Contingence ſquirewiſe to the Subſtile. Then take the leaſt diſtance of the point F. from the Stile. Afterward extend your compaſſes, the one foote being placed in F. in the line of the Subſtile toward C. vnto H. Deſcribe vpon the centre H. the Equinoctiall circle by F. Diuide it into 24. equall partes, beginning where the ruler ſhall touch the Equator, being placed vpon the centre H and vpon euery marke of the Equator, and where the ruler ſhall touch the line of Contingence, there make markes, by which, from the centre C. draw the houre lines ſomany as ſhall be neceſſary, C▪ E. alwaies ſhe wing the 12. hower.

                  But if the Eleuation of the Pole, and the Eleuation of the Meridian be found equall, the making of your Diall differeth from the former: yet y• finding out of the Meridian and the Subſtile, &amp;c. is wrought as in the other before,

whither you may reſorte. It ſhal be ſufficient here to ſhew an example of this kinde.

                  Firſt I multiply 52991 the Sine of the declination, by 83388 the Sine of the Complement of the Reclination, and the product 4418813508 ariſing thereof, I diuide by the whole Sine: the quotient Sine 44188 yéeldeth an ark 26.

                        m. is ye complement to be repeated.
                  Then I increaſe the Sine of the Complement of the declination, which is 84804, by the whole Sine, and the product is, 8480400000: which I parte by 89700 being the Sine of the complement to be repeated. The arke of whoſe quotient Sine 94541 being 70.

                        m. is the diſtance of the Meridian from the Horizon.
                  This done, I multiply this Sine 94541, by the Sine of the complement of the reclination, which is 83388, and the product ariſing hereof, being 7883584908 I diuide by the whole Sine: the quotient therof is 78835, whoſe ark 52.

                  Wherefore if the Eleuation of the Pole, and of the Meridian be found equall, (as in this example it is) make a line parallel to the Horizon A. B. Draw another C. D. making right angles with the line A. B. Draw the quadrant from A. to D. number therein the diſtance of the Meridian from the Horizon from A. toward D. which is 70.

                        m. being here in place of the Subſtile. Then draw the line of Contingence ſquire wiſe to the Meridian C. E. (which is alſo the 

Subſtile C E. in any point thereof, as before. Place one foot of your Compaſſes in the interſection E. then ſet the other foote in y• Meridian (or Subſtile) being of any widenes: make there the point or centre F. vpon which centre drawe the halfe Equator from G. by E. to H.

                        d. place the ruler vpon the centre F. and the end of this number, and where it ſhall touch the Contingent line, there make a marke, by this marke you muſt draw a line ſquire wiſe to the Contingent line, which ſhall be for the 12 hower. And where the ruler ſhall touch the Equator, there begin to diuide it into 12. equall partes, by which lay the ruler from the centre F. making in the line of Contingence markes for the other hower lines, all which ſhall cut the Contingent line ſquire-wiſe. Note that ſometime in diuiding of the Equator, the two parts at both ends next to the Semidiameter G.

                  In the Delineation of this diall, drawe firſt as before a

line Parallele to the Horizon A B. extend another C. D. making right angles with the line A. B. Draw the Quadrant from A. to D. diuide it into 90. degrées. In which account the diſtance of the Meridian from the Horizon, from A. towards D. which is 54.

Let the line of Contingence cut the Subſtile ſquire-wiſe, in what poynt you will. Finiſh all other things, as in the firſt of theſe thrée kindes of South reclining declining Dials.
                  In this kinde of reclining Dials, whoſe Stile muſt bée placed from the centre C. vpward toward the Pole Artick: if at any time you cannot draw to both ends of the Contingent line ſo many howre lines as ſhall be neceſſarie: then prolong beyond the centre C. the lines oppoſite on the other ſide. As if you would make the 8. houre line for the morning, draw the 8. for the euening beyond the centre C. and you ſhall haue your deſire.
                  Note that moreouer, in this kinde contrarie to the other before, if the plat decline toward the Weſt, (as in this example it doth) thē draw the quadrant towards the Weſt, &amp;c. But if the Declination be towards the Eaſt, make the quadrant towards the Eaſt.

               The making of a North reclining declining Diall. CAP. 15.
               
                  The firſt kinde.
                  
                     IN this kinde as in the South before: firſt multiply the Sine of the Declination, by the Sine of the Complement of the Reclination: parting the product by the whole Sine. The quotient Sine thereof ſhall yéelde an arke, whoſe Complement ſhall be called the Complement repeated.
                  
                     Then increaſe the Sine of the Complement of the Declination by the whole Sine, diuide the product by the Sine of the Complement repeated: the quotient Sine thereof will giue an arke, which ſhall be the diſtance of the Meridian from the Horizon.
                  The ſame quotient Sine multiply by the Sine of the Complement of the reclination: and the number ariſing part by the whole Sine: the arke of this quotient is the Eleuation of the Meridian.
                  Now adde the Eleuation of the Pole to the Eleuation of the Meridian, and the totall number or arke hereof, wée will call the compounded arke. And if the compounded arke be leſſe then 90. degrées: then multiply the Sine therof, by the Sine of the Complement repeated, diuiding the product by the whole Sine: and hereof ſhall ariſe a quotient Sine, whoſe arke ſhalbe the diſtance of the Stile frō the Subſtile.
                  Now compare the Complement of this diſtance, with the Complement of the compounded arke: and increaſe the Sine of the leſſer by the whole Sine, part the product by the Sine of the greater: and thereof ſhall come a Sine, the Complement of whoſe arke ſhal be the diſtance of the Subſtile from the Meridian.
                  But marke here the diuerſitie which doth ariſe by reaſon of the compounded arke: for hereby you ſhall haue thrée ſundry waies, both in finding out the diſtances betwéene the Meridian and the Horizon, the Stile and Subſtile, &amp;c. And likewiſe in the delineation of the figure. Whereof ariſeth thrée ſundry kinds of Dialls: the firſt of them being already taught.
               
               
                  The ſecond kinde.
                  If the compounded arke be iuſt 90. degrées: then the diſtance of the Stile from the Subſtile ſhall be the Complement repeated: and the diſtance of the Subſtile from the Meridian ſhall be alſo 90. degrées.
                  
                     Note that in the working hereof, there is no difference from the firſt kinde. For here as in the other before, you ſhall firſt 
                        •
                     inde out the complement repeated: then the diſtance of the Meridian from the Horizon: Afterward the Eleuation of the Meridian, which being added to the Eleuation of the Pole, if the totall number bée iuſt 90. 
                        d. you ſhall not néede to procéede forward, for this (as before I made mention) ſhall bée the diſtance of the Meridian from the Subſtile.
                  In this kinde you ſhall haue no interſection of the Meridian and the Contingent line: therefore you ſhall begin the diuiſion of the Equator at the line of the Subſtile, which ſhall ſhew the 6. houre, either in the morning, or euening, according as the plat doth decline.
               
               
                  The third kinde.
                  But if the compounded arke be greater then 90 degrées, ſubſtract it from 180, and that which remayneth ſhalbe called the difference kept. Then multiplie the Sine of the Complement repeated, by the Sine of the difference kept, diuiding the product by the whole Sine, hereof ſhall come a Sine, whoſe arke ſhall be the diſtance of the Stile from the Subſtile.
                  Then compare the Complement of this diſtance, with the Complemēt of the difference kept, increaſing the Sine of the leſſer by the whole Sine, and parting the product by the Sine of the greater: whereof ſhall come a Sine, the Complemēt of whoſe arke, being taken from 180 degrées, the remaynder ſhal ſhew how much the line of the Subſtile muſt be diſtant (vpward by the Horizon) from the Meridian. For the better vnderſtanding of theſe thrée kinds, mark theſe thrée examples following, with the delineatiō of their figures.
                  
                     
                     Example of a North Diall, whoſe
                     Declination is, 45. d.
                     Reclination 45. d.
                     Eleuatiō of the Pole 52. d.
                  
                  Firſt I worke this altogether like to the South reclining 45. 
                        d. declining 45. 
                        d. vntill I haue found out the Eleuation of the Meridian.
                  Then I adde the Eleuation of the Meridian which is, 35. 
                        d. 16. 
                        m. to the Eleuation of the Pole 52. 
                        d. the totall number is 87. 
                        d. 16. 
                        m. which is the compounded arke: and being leſſe then 90. 
                        d. I procéede with this arke, &amp;c.
                  Now therefore I multiplie the Sine of this compounded arke, which is 99884, by the Sine of the complement to be repeated being 86602, and the product 8650154168 I part by the whole Sine. The quotient thereof is 86501, whoſe arke 59. 
                        d. 54. 
                        m. is the diſtance betwéene the Stile and the Subſtile.
                  Then I compare 30. 
                        d. 6. 
                        m. being the Complement of this diſtance, with▪ the Complement of the compounded arke, which is 2. 
                        d. 44. 
                        m. and finding this leaſt, I increaſe 4768 the Sine thereof, by the whole Sine, diuiding the product, which is 476800000, by 50151 the Sine of the greater: the quotient Sine yéeldeth an arke 5. 
                        d. 27. 
                        m. the Complement hereof 84.

                        m. is the diſtance of the Subſtile from the Meridian.
                  In drawing of this Diall, firſt as before, make a line Parallele to the Horizon A B. Then extend the line C. D. cutting the other ſquire-wiſe. Marke the interſection or centre with E. draw thereupon a circle A. B. C. D. whoſe two quadrants at the leaſt, toward A. (if the plat decline Weſtward, or elſe toward B. if it decline Eaſtward) being diuided into 90. 
                        d. each of them, number therein from A. towards D. the diſtance of the Meridian from the Horizon, which is 54. 
                        d. 44. 
                        m. and at the end hereof from the centre 
                        
                           •
                        . draw the line F. for the Meridian, or 12. houre. Account

from this vpward toward C. the diſtance of the Subſtile from the Meridian, bring 84. 
                        d. 33. 
                        m. make likewiſe at the end of this number from E. the line for the Subſtile. Againe number from hence vpward (if there be ſo much ſpace, or elſe downward) 59. 
                        d. 54. 
                        m. which is the diſtance betwéen the Stile and the Subſtile, and at the ende hereof drawe the line H. for the Stile. Let the Contingent line cut the Subſtile ſquire-wiſe in the point G. which you may take in any place of the Subſtile. Then with your compaſſes the leaſt diſtance of this point G. and the Stile being taken, with that wideneſſe extend them forth in the line of the Subſtile toward E. making there the point I. vpon which draw the Equator or Equinoctiall circle. This done place the ruler vpon the centre I. and the interſection of the Meridian and the Contingent line, and where it ſhall touch the Equator there begin to diuide it into 24. equall partes. Finiſh all other things, as in thoſe which went before.

                  The ſecond kinde of North Diall, reclining 45. degrees 14. minuts, declining 38. degrees.
                  IT ſhall not bée neceſſarie to ſhewe an example of this ſecond kinde, becauſe the Complement repeated, the diſtance of the Meridian from the Subſtile, and betwéene

the Stile and Subſtile, &amp;c. is found out altogether like to the other before, and that which foloweth. Therefore it ſufficeth to ſet downe the number of theſe diſtances.
                  Firſt the Complement repeated is, 64. 
                        d. 18.

                  The diſtance of the Meridian from the Horizon is, 60.

                  The Eleuation of the Meridian is 38. 
                        d. which I adde to the Eleuation of the Pole being 52. 
                        d. and the totall 90. 
                        d. is the compounded arke.
                  Draw therefore in this kinde as before, a line Parallel to the Horizon A B. make another ſquire-wiſe, C. D. Draw the two quadrants from C. by A. to D. diuiding each of them into 90. 
                        d. Then number herein the diſtance of the Meridian from the Horizon, which is 60. 
                        d. 59. 
                        m. drawing from E. at the end here of, the line F. for the Meridian. From this account 90. 
                        d. being here the diſtance of the Subſtile from the Meridian: and like wiſe at the end of this number from E. drawe the line for the Subſtile. Againe from this line downward, (becauſe there is no ſpace vpward,) account the Complement repeated 64. 
                        d. 18. 
                        m. which here we take for the diſtance of the Stile from the Subſtile: make likewiſe by this number the line E. H. for the Stile. Let the Contingent line cut the Subſtile ſquire-wiſe in any place. Then taking the leaſt diſtance with the compaſſes of the point G and of the Stile, with that widenſſe in the Subſtile, make the poynt I. vpon which draw the Equinoctiall circle by G And becauſe here, (as in all other Dials, where the compounded arke is iuſt 90. 
                        d.) there is no interſection of the Meridian, and the Contingent line: therefore begin the diuiſion of the Equator into 24 equal parts at the Subſtile, which in this kinde ſhall ſhew the ſixt houre, either in the euening or morning, according to the declination of the plat. Place the ruler vpon the centre I. and ſo many of theſe parts as you can, making markes in the line of Contingence as before, draw the houre lines by them, &amp;c. finiſh the reſt as in the other.

                  Héere firſt, as before I multiply the Sine of the Declination being 50000, by 93041 which is y• Sine of the complement

of the Reclination and the product 4652070000 I part by the whole Sine: the quotient 46520 yéeldeth an arke 27. 
                        d. 43. 
                        m. The complement whereof is 62.

                        m. being the Complement to be repeated.
                  Then I encreaſe 86602 the Sine of the complement of the Declination by the whole Sine, diuiding the product, by 88525 the Sine of the Complement repeated: The arke of the quotient Sine 97827, is 78. 
                        d. 2. 
                        m, which is the diſtance of the Meridian from the Horizon.
                  This done, I augment this quotient Sine 97827, by the Sine of the Complement of the reclination, which is 93041: the product 9101921907 I diſtribute by the whole Sine: and the quotient 91019 giueth an arke 65.

                  Now I adde 65. 
                        d. 32. 
                        m. being the Eleuation of the Meridian, to 52.

                        d. 32.

                        m. which is the Difference kept.
                  Afterward I multiply 88525 the Sine of the Complement repeated, by 88674 the Sine of the difference kept, parting the product 7849865850 by the whole Sine. The quotient is 78498 whoſe arke is 51.

               The making of a South Inclining direct Diall. CAP. 16.
               IF the inclination of the plat be leſſe then the Eleuation of the pole, take that from this, accoūting the remainder for the Eleuation of the Pole. And with this number as if it

were the Eleuafion of the Pole make a Diall like to the South erect direct, and it ſhall be fit for your plat.
               But if the Inclination of the plat be equal with the Eleuation of the Pole, make your Diall altogether like to the North reclining direct, whoſe reclination likewiſe is equall to the Eleuation of the Pole. They differ onely herein, that this is placed downward to the earth, and that vpward.
               But if the Inclination of the plat be greater then the Eleuation of the Pole, ſubſtract this from that, and with the number remaining, as if it were the Eleuation of the Pole, make your Dial like to the North erect direct.

Note that this North diall ſheweth but onely 4. howers, the two firſt in the morning, and the two laſt in the euening, and that only in the middeſt of Sommer.

               Afterward, this Sine being multiplied by the Sine of the Complement of the inclination, and the product parted by the whole Sine: the arke of the quotient Sine ſhall bée the Eleuation of the Meridian.

               This done, augment the Sine of the Complement repeated, by the Sine of the Doutfull arke: &amp; the product ariſing thereof being diuided by the whole Sine, the quotient arke ſhall be the diſtance of the Stile from the Subſtile.
               Now compare the Complement of this diſtance, with the Complement of the Doutful arke, multiplying the Sine of the leſſer, by the whole Sine, diuiding the product by the Sine of the greater: the arke of the quotient Sine comming thereof ſhall bée the diſtance of the Subſtile from the Meridian.

               Marke this likewiſe, if the doubtfull arke be equall 90 degrées, let the Complement repeated be the diſtance of the Stile from the Subſtile: then ſhall there bée iuſt 90

               Afterward increaſe the Sine of the difference kept, by the Sine of the Complement repeated, and diuide the product by the whole Sine. The quotient ariſing of this diuiſion ſhall giue an arke, which ſhall be the diſtance betwéene the Stile and the Subſtile.
               To conclude, the Complement of this diſtance being compared with the Complement of the difference kept, multiplie the Sine of the leſſer by the whole Sine, and part the product by the Sine of the greater. The Complement of the arke of the quotient Sine, ſhall be the diſtance of the Subſtile from the Meridian.
               But note, if the Eleuation of the Meridian, &amp; the Eleuation of the Pole be found equal, make an Equinoctial dial as before you were taught in the Meridionall reclining declining:

for there is no difference, but only that this is placed downward, and the South vpward.
               There be of this north, as of the South reclining declining, thrée ſundrie kinds of Dials, as by the examples and figures following you may perceiue.

                  Remember that in this kinde of North inclining declining Diall, the Meridian line rather repreſenteth the 12. houre at midnight, then in the day: wherefore in accounting

the houre lines, let the meridian be alwaies for the 12. hower in the night. And then if your plat decline Weſtward, account backward as it were 11. 10. 9. which howers with the 12. you may omit in the delineation of your diall, becauſe they haue no vſe in our Eleuation. But account forward 8, 7, 6, 5, 4. &amp;c. ſo many as you think ſhall be neceſſary, for ſome declination will receiue more, then other will: the greater the more, the leſſer the ſewer howers. But if the declination of your plat be Eaſtward then account from the Meridian line forward 1, 2, 3, 4. &amp;c. ſo many as ſhall be néedfull, omitting likewiſe y• firſt thrée, &amp;c.

               WHen as the declination and reclination, or declination and inclination, ſhall cauſe the plat of your Diall to lye nigh to the Eleuation of the Pole, then the hower lines muſt be drawen very long, to make the diſtances ſomwhat large, ſo that they may be diſcerned one from another. And

commonly theſe folowing be ſuch as here we meane.

               In all theſe kindes oftentimes the diſtance betwéen the Stile and the Subſtile is ſo ſmall that it is not poſſible to draw your Diall, except the plat be very large: which at al times you ſhall not haue.
               Therefore the beſt way is this. Firſt drawe your Diall very true (as before hath béen taught) vpon a large paper, making your quadrant ſo great as may be. Draw likewiſe the howre lines very long, which will cauſe the greater diſtance betwéen the Stile and the Subſtile, and in like maner betwéen the howre lines. It will alſo procure y• greater Equator, which wil be a great help in the drawing of your Dial, as by the figure following you may perceiue.
               When you haue thus drawen your Diall, then at y• end of the paper wher the lines be of greateſt diſtance, draw the line I. K. parallel to the Horizontall line, make likewiſe the other line L M. (according to the greatnes of your plat) of equall diſtance from y• other. This done, finde out (or rather draw a line vpon your plat which may repreſent) the true Horizon of the plat: cutting the paper in ſunder by the line I. K. and the line L. M. placing it vpon your plat very plain, ſo that one of the edges may be parallel to y• Horizon. Then make markes vpon the plat at both ends of all the howre lines drawing by thoſe marks, y• lines for y• howers. Draw likewiſe light lines vpon the plat for the Stile &amp; the Subſtile, eaſily to be extinguiſhed, as you did vpon the paper.
               Let the Stile N. be faſtened ouer y• Subſtile as you haue

béen taught in the Eaſt, &amp; Weſt, or Equinoctiall Dialls.
               But here note, that the Stile muſt not be of equal height at both ends. But let it be ſo high, as the diſtance betwéene the Stile &amp; the Subſtile is in the place where it ſtandeth: as in the examples folowing you may plainely perceiue.

                  FOr ſomuch as ſometime the 12 ſignes of the Zodiake are placed in Sunne Dialls, know in what ſigne y• Sunne is at any time (which albeit any kinde will receiue, yet moſt commonly the verticall directly oppoſite to y• South are garniſhed therewith.) Therefore in drawing the 12. Signes, in theſe South, and all other kindes of Dialls before mentioned, doe thus.
               Prepare a little Table of Iron, Braſſe, or cloſe grained wood, in breadth 3. or 4. in length 5. or 6. inches. Choſe for the Diameter one of the ſhorteſt ſides, wherein draw vpon the centre A. halfe a circle to be deuided into two quadrants diſtinguiſhed with a line drawen from the centre A. to the arke B. parte ech quadrant into 90. degrées. The line A. B. is héere in place of the Equator, ſhewing in the arke the beginning of Aries and Libra. Moreouer how to finde the other Signes on both ſides, ſéeke in the Table of the declination of the Sunne from the Equinoctial circle, which is afterward expreſſed. Firſt finde out the degrées of the diſtance (in this Table) of the beginning of Taurus from the Equator being 11. degrées 30. minutes. Account this diſtance in the quadrant from the letter B. towards the left hand, and at the end of this number draw a line from the centre A. which ſhall ſhew the beginning of Taurus and Virgo. Account like wiſe the ſame diſtance on the other ſide from the line A. B. and make a line for the beginning of Piſces and Scorpius. Againe in the 20. 
                     d. 12. 
                     m. from the line A. B. you ſhal haue the beginning of Gemeni &amp; Leo: and ſo

many degrées and minutes on the other ſide, the beginning of Aquarius and Sagittarius. To conclude on both ſides in the 23 degrées 30 minutes there muſt bée on the one part Cancer, and on the other Capricorne.
               
               Afterward draw lines from the centre A by euery marke ſo long as your Table will receiue▪ and at the end of theſe lines let the caracters of the 12 ſignes of the Zodiake bée fixed: as in the figure following you may ſée.

                  YOur Diall being made and the Stile placed therein: take your Trigonall inſtrument, and ſet it vpon the Stile, ſo that the whole Diameter thereof may ſtand plaine vpon the edge or vpper part, the centre A. of your inſtrument alwaies remaining in one place of the Stile. Let the line of ♋ bend vpward to the centre of your diall, and the line of ♑ downe ward. Then faſten a thred at the vppermoſt end of your trigonal in euery line of the ſignes, ſo that you may direct it downward by the centre A. to the plat of your Diall: and where the ende of the thred ſhall touch the Diall, make a marke. Then mouing the Trigonal on the right hand, ſo that the thred may bée ſtretched on the left hand, make there likewiſe a prick vpon the plat. When you haue thus done 4 or 5 times vpon the one ſide of the diall: (that is on the left hand) doe ſo likewiſe on the other ſide on the right hand. Theſe markes being thus made, draw (with your compaſſes or rather with a crooked ruler made according to thoſe markes) a line by them. Doe thus with each one of the 7 lines of your Trigonal. When you haue drawne al theſe lines, (being crooked, except the middle line, which is right, and repreſenteth the Equator) then at the ends of them write the caracters of the 12 ſignes on this wiſe.
                  Firſt on the right hand toward the Eaſt, at the ende of the vpper line, write or place ♑. At the ſecond line downward ♒. At the third ♓. At the fourth ♈. At the fift ♉ at the ſixt ♊, at the ſeuenth ♋. Then on the other ſide on the left hand toward the Weſt, at the ende of the nethermoſt line place ♋. At the ſecond ♌, at the third ♍, at the fourth ♎, at the fift ♏, at the ſixt ♐. And finally againe at the vppermoſt ſet ♑.
                  This done, remember that in what place of the Stile the

centre A. of your Trigonall was placed, there faſten a ſmall péece of yron or any ſuch like thing, which may ſhewe with the ſhadowe thereof, the Signe which the Sunne ſhall be in at any time: vnleſſe the houre lines bée ſo ſhort, that where the ſmall péece of yron ſhould be placed, you may cut the Stile that the ende thereof ſhall ſhew it.

ends of the lines: the true doing where of, you may eaſily perceiue by the courſe of the Sunne. For in the South Erect, when the Sunne occupieth Cancer, then is the line of ♋ furtheſt diſtant from the centre of the Diall. But in the Horizontall Diall, the line of ♋ is next to the centre. Few words ſhall ſuffice for this matter: experience ſhall eaſilie teach you herein.
               
            
            
               How to place the vnequall houres in a Horizontall Diall. CAP. 23.
               
                  FIrſt you ſhall vnderſtand, that by an vnequall hower is ment the 12 part of the day whether it be ſhort or long. For when the Sunne is in the Equinoctiall circle, the day hath 12 equall, and like wiſe 12 vnequall houres. But in winter ſolſtice, when the dayes be at the ſhorteſt, and containeth with vs (where the Pole is eleuated aboue the Horizon 52 degrées) onely 7 houres, 36 minutes: then the vnequall houres be leſſe. For if you diuide theſe 7 houres 36 minutes by fractions into 12: you ſhall finde onely 38 minutes of an equall houre, to make one vnequall houre. But in the ſommer ſolſtice, when the dayes bée at the longeſt, and hath 16 houres, 24 minutes: then one houre with 24 minutes maketh one houre vnequall. Theſe bée like wiſe called the houres of the Planets, and are placed in Dialls on this maner.
               Your Diall being made and prepared, draw vpon it the 12 ſignes of the Zodiake (as you were taught before) ſo large as your plat will giue leaue, &amp;c.
               Note that alwaies the Meridian line, or 12 equall houre,

is the 6 vnequall houre. Marke likewiſe, that when the Sunne entreth into the beginning of ♈ and ♎, both the equall and the vnequall houres be of like quantitie. For the 7 equall houre in the morning is the firſt vnequall, and the 8 equall the 2 planetare houre, &amp;c.
               But in the Tropike of ♋ it is otherwiſe: for then the vnequall houres be greater then the equal. Therefore account how many houres and minutes is in the longeſt day for your Eleuation, changing all the minutes of thoſe houres into one totall ſumme. Then diuide this number by 12: and the quotient ſhall ſhew how many minutes of an equall maketh one vnequall houre. Example hereof: with vs the longeſt day is 16 houres 24 minutes. Wherefore I multiplie 60 which is the minutes of an equal houre, by 16, which is the ſumme of houres of the longeſt day, and the product ariſeth to 960, whereunto I adde 24 the minutes remayning, then the number ſhall be 984, which being diuided by 12, the quotient is 82. Wherefore I conclude that 82 minutes of an equall, maketh one vnequall or planetare houre. Then to draw them in Dialls worke thus.
               Firſt in the Tropike of ♋ diuide the ſpace betwéene each houre into 60 equall partes, but becauſe thoſe diſtances bée ſo ſmall, for the moſt part, that this cannot be done: therefore it ſhall ſuffice to diuide euery one of them into thrée equall partes. Then ſhall euery parte conteine 20 
                     m. and thrée of them 60 
                     m. which is one equall houre.
               When as therefore you will place the 7 vnequall houre, account from the Meridian line, or 12 houre, 4 parts and 2 minutes (which is 82 minutes) and make there a marke. Then place your ruler by this point or marke, and the interſection of the line of ♈ and ♎, and the firſt houre after noone: drawe a line from one Tropike to another, that is from ♋ to ♑.
               Then for the placing of the 8 vnequall houre, account from the 7 laſt made, 4 of the foreſaid parts and two minutes make there a marke, by which and the interſection of

the line of ♈ and ♎ and the line of the ſecond houre after noone, the ruler being placed, draw a line, as before.
               For the 9, account from the 8 laſt made, likewiſe 4 parts and two minutes, drawing a line as before. Doe in like maner for the drawing of all the other remaining: that is, for the 10, and 11. The 12 being the Sunne ſitting ſhall néede no line.
               As you haue finiſhed the vnequall houres on this ſide for the afternoone, doe in like maner for thoſe in the forenoone: accounting from the Meridian 4 parts and 2 
                     m. of an equall houre, to each vnequall, drawing, as before, lines from one Tropike to another.
               You may place the figures for the vnequall or planetare houres, at the ende of the lines vnder the Tropike of Capricorne, or aboue the line of Cancer as you will.
               Note that the ſame part of the Stile which ſheweth the 12 ſignes, ſhall like wiſe ſhew the vnequall houres. For better vnderſtanding hereof:

               How to place the houres vnequall in a South erect direct Diall. CAP. 24.
               
                  THere is almoſt the ſame maner of placing the vnequall houres in this kind, as in the Horizontall, differing onely herein, that whereas you diuided the ſpaces betwéene the houre lines, in the Tropike of ♋, (which is next to the centre of your Diall) and accounted 4 partes 2 minutes of an equall, to one vnequall houre: in this you muſt diuide the Tropike of ♑, (which is likewiſe next to the centre of the Diall) taking onely 2 partes wanting 2 minutes, (that is 38m.) of an equall houre to ech vnequall.
               Therefore your Diall being prepared, and the 12 ſignes of the Zodiake placed therein, &amp;c. account how many houres and minutes be in the ſhorteſt day in your country, changing all the houres into minutes (giuing to each houre 60 minutes.) Diuide the product by 12, and the quotient ſhall ſhew how many minutes of an equall, will be anſwerable to each vnequall houre. Example, the ſhorteſt day with vs is 7 houres, 36 minutes, which being multiplied into one groſſe number of minutes, the product is 456, which I diuide by 12, and the quotient is 38. Therefore I affirme that 38 minutes of a vulgar or equall, maketh one planetare or vnequall houre.
               Then diuide the Tropike of ♑ here, as in the Horizontall you did the Tropike of ♋. Afterward account from the Meridian line 38m. (or 2 parts wanting, 2m.) of an equall houre to each vnequall, &amp;c.

                  FIrſt draw your Diall true, then place the 12 Signes of the Zodiake in it: which you may doe on this wiſe. The Stile of your Dial being fixed therin, as before hath béen taught, take your Trigonall (before preſcribed) and place it vpon the edge of the Stile: then according to the direction of the thread (as in y• South Diall before) make marks vpon the plat, as in the Figure following you may ſée. Afterward by theſe markes draw lines as before you did, placing at the ends of them the Caracters of the 12 Signes.
               Moreouer note that where the centre A. of your Trigonall doth touch the edge of the Stile, there faſten a ſmall péece of Iron or ſuch like thing, which may ſhew ſhe place of the Sunne in euery Signe, and likewiſe the planetare or vnequall howres.

                        m. the halfe thereof is 8 howres 12.

Then diuide the arke A. X. into 6. equall partes. Afterward placing the ruler vpon the centre E. and eche one of theſe partes, where it ſhall touch the Contingent line D. F. make marks. Likewiſe in the other line of Contingence G. B. make theſe markes, being of equall diſtance in this line from the point B. as the other be from the point D. Then place the ruler vpon two of theſe marks (being equidiſtant from the points B. D.) in both the Contingent lines, and where it ſhal touch the Tropike of ♋ make markes. This done, lay the ruler vpon the firſt marke in the Tropick of ♋ next vnto X, and the interſection of the line of the 6 hower, with the line of the beginning of ♈ and ♎, drawing a manifeſt line from one Tropike to another, which (if you haue wrought all things true) will be parallele to the Horizon, and it ſhall be the 12. vnequall hower line in the Weſt Diall, and the Horizon or Sunne riſing in the Eaſt Diall. Againe, place your ruler vpon the ſecond marke in the Tropike of Cancer, and the interſection of the line of the 5. hower with the Equator, or line of Aries and Libra, drawing like wiſe a line, which ſhall ſhew the firſt howre in the Eaſt, and the 11. howre in the Weſt Diall, make on this wiſe all the other vnequall howres, namely the 10, 9, 8, and 7, in the Weſt Diall.

                  FIrſt prepare your Sphere or plat perfectly hollow, of what quantity you wil. Then with your compaſſes diuide the vpper brimme thereof, into 4 equall partes, marking it with the letters A. B. C. D. Afterward open your Compaſſes to the widenes of one Quadrant, either A. C. or A. D. and with that wideneſſe, one foote being placed in the point D. draw an obſcure or light line from A. to B. This done, ſet one foote of your Compaſſes in the point C and with the other you ſhall try whether the plat be perfectly Sphericall or not: for if it be, your Compaſſes will fall in the ſame line which you made before, but if it be not perfect you may amend it. And then draw this line manifeſt, ſo that it may continue. For it ſhall be the Meridian line, ſhewing the 12 howre. Againe, place one foote in the point A. drawing with the other a light line from C. to D. then one foote being ſet in B. you may try with the other, as before, the truth of the line laſt made. Now where theſe two lines cut eche other in the bottome of the plat, place the letter E. Then diuiding the quadrant A. E. into 90. 
                     d. and accounting therein the Eleuation of the Pole from E. toward A. make y• point F. by which the arke line of ♈ and ♎, repreſenting the equinoctiall circle, ſhall be drawen. Afterward ſéeke out the greateſt declination of the Sun from the Equator, (which you ſhall finde in the table of the declination of the Sunne) which is 23.

               When you haue thus made marks for al y• arkes of the 12 Signes, open your compaſſes to the Quadrant of the Spheare, that is, from A. to C. which widenes of the compaſſes remaining, place one foote in the point F. in the arke of ♈ and ♎ in the Meridian: and where the other foot ſhall touch the ſame Meridian towards B make the point G. which ſhall repreſent the Pole antartic

                  , by which as it were from a centre, draw a line from the point D. by F. to C. which ſhall be the line of Aries and Libra. Then one foote of your compaſſes remaining in the point G. with the other draw lines from one ſide of the plat to the other, by euery marke before made for the 12. Signes of the Zodiake.
               The 12. Signes being thus finiſhed, procéede to the diuiſion of the equall howres on this manner. Diuide y• arke of the Equator into 12. equall partes, beginning at D. by F. ending in C. Then open your Compaſſes to the quadrāt of the plat, and the ſame wideneſſe of them remaining, place one foote on the firſt point of the diuiſion next C. in the Equator, and if you haue diuided the Equator equally, the other foote will touch the firſt part beyond F. towards D. by which from the centre G to the edge of the plat, draw a line, which ſhall ſhew the firſt howre afternoone. This done, remoue your compaſſes (that wideneſſe remaining) placing one foote in the ſecond part from C. towards F. and the other foote touching the ſecond part from F towards D. make a line as before, from the centre G. to the brimme of the plat, to ſhew the 2. howre afternoone. In like manner, finiſh all the other howre lines, namely the 3, 4, 5, 6 7, 8, for the afternoone. Then doe likewiſe on the other ſide for the howres in the forenoone, namely the 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, and 4 drawing lines from the centre G. by euery diuiſion, to the brimme of the plat, &amp;c.

Then with the compaſſes ioyne eche thrée points, of theſe thrée arkes, anſwerable into one line or arke, vntill you haue made 12. lines to ſhewe the 12. vnequall howres, as in the figure following you may ſée. Whereof the Meridian, or 12. vnequall howre ſhall alwaies be the 6. vnequall howre.

               Firſt your Sphear or plat being prepared, and parted into foure Quadrants, as before in the Horizontall you were taught, diuide the quadrant E. A. into 90 degrees. Then number in it the Eleuation of the Pole from A. toward E. marking the ende of the number with F. Afterward open your compaſſes to the quadrant of the plat, and the one foote placed in F. extend the other in the Meridian line towards B. making the point G. where it ſhall touch the Meridian line: from which point as a centre you ſhall draw the lines for the 12 ſignes, as you were taught in the Horizontall. Diuide likewiſe, and draw the lines for the equall houres, as before in the Horizontall.
               The placing of the houres vnequall in this kinde is done, as in the South Erect Direct vpon a plaine ſuperficies, except onely that whereas there you did draw them with a ruler, here you ſhall doe it with compaſſes on this manner. Open your compaſſes to the Quadrant of the plat, that is, from A. to C. accounſing from the Meridian in the Tropike of Capricorne, two parts wanting two minutes of an equall houre, making there a marke: And that wideneſſe of your compaſſes remaining, draw a line from that marke made in the Tropike ♑, by the interſection of the line of Aries and Libra, &amp; the line of the firſt houre in the afternoone, vnto the Tropike of Cancer. Draw all the other lines for the vnequall houres in like maner, as in the figure you may plainely ſée,

               The making of a Diall vpon a Quadrant, or the Table deſcribed in the beginning of the Booke. CAP. 28.
               
                  IF you will make this Diall vppon a Quadrant alone, prepare and diuide it altogether like one of the Quadrants of the table, whoſe making is preſcribed in the firſt Chapter: or if you will make it vpon that inſtrument alreadie prepared, worke thus.
               Diuide the diameter E. D. into foure equall partes; then leauing out the fourth part next E. deſcribe vpon the middle point betwéene C. and S. an obſcure halfe circle: which diuide into ſixe equall parts. From each point of which diuiſion draw light lines vnto the Semidiameter D. E. touching it ſquire wiſe. Then draw nigh to the line D. E. two other lines parallele thereto: which with the croſſe lines drawne from the halfe circle may make 12 vnequall quadrangles, wherein the 12 ſignes of the Zodiake may be figured: the North towards D. the South toward S. And to the intent you may proportionally part theſe Quadrangles into fiue or ten degrées: diuide thoſe ſixe parts of the halfe circle equally into ſo many degrées. Then drawe againe from thoſe diuiſions right liues to the Dimetient D. E. ſquirewiſe, as before.
               This done vpon the point E. from S. that is to ſay, from the end of ♐ and beginning of ♑, drawe an arke to the Semidiamer D. E. which ſhall be for the winter Tropike. Againe vpon the ſame centre, draw another from the beginning of ♈ and ♎ for the Equator. To conclude, make another from the angle D. that is, from the end of ♊ and beginning of ♋, which ſhall bée for the Summer Tropike. By the helpe of theſe arkes, you ſhall draw the houre lines, ſo

that you firſt know the height of the Sunne aboue the Horizon, at euery houre, when it occupieth the beginning of ♑, ♈ and ♋. Whoſe altitude is thus found out.
               Take the Eleuation of the Pole, and the Complement thereof: alſo the declination of the Sunne from the Equinoctiall, and the diſtance of the Sunne from the Meridian, accounting 15 degrées for euery houre, with the Complement of this diſtance. Then if you deſire to knowe the altitude of the Sunne at ſixe of the clock either in the morning or at euening (at which houre onely in Sommer it is aboue the Horizon) multiply the Sine of the Eleuation of the Pole, by the Sine of the declaration of the Sunne, diuiding the product by the whole Sine, and you ſhall haue your deſire.
               But if the Sunne ſhall bée diſtant from the Meridian fewer howers then ſixe, multiply the Sine of this diſtance (giuing to euery houre 15 degrées) by the Sine of the Complement of the altitude of the Pole, and the product hereof diuide by the whole Sine. Then take the arke of the quotient from 90 degrées, and the firſt number found out ſhall remaine, which muſt be kept. Then compare the Sine of this number found out, with the Sine of the Eleuation of the Pole, augment the leſſer by the whole Sine, diuiding the product by the greater: Whereof ſhall come a quotient Sine, to the complement of whoſe arke adde the declination of the Sunne, if it ſhall be in the North ſignes, or ſubtract it from that, if it occupieth the South ſignes. And if the number which commeth hereof ſhall bée greater then 90, take it from 180, and you ſhall haue the ſecond number found out. The Sine of this number found out being multiplied, by the Sine of the firſt number found out, ſhall yéelde a product, which part by the whole Sine, and the arke of the quotient Sine ſhall ſhew the deſired altitude of the Sunne for the houre propounded.
               But if the diſtance of the Sunne from the Meridian ſhall excéede ſixe houres (that is 90 degrées) take the degrées

of that diſtance from 180, multiplying the Sine of the remainder by the Sine of the Complemēt of the altitude of the Pole, diuiding the product by the whole Sine, and ſubtract the arke of the quotient from 90, the remainder ſhal be called the Firſt number found out. The Sine of which number found out compared with the Sine of the Eleuation of the Pole, increaſe the leſſer by the whole Sine, and diſtribute the product by the greater. Then take the Complement of the Declination of the Sunne, from the arke of the quotient, and you ſhall haue the ſecond number found out.
               Finally the Sine of the firſt number found out, and the Sine of the ſecond being multiplied by themſelues, and the product parted by the whole Sine; the quotient Sine ſhall yéeld an arke, which ſhall bée the altitude of the Sunne.
               But when the Sunne occupieth the beginning of ♈ or ♎ you ſhall finde the altitude thereof euery houre, onely by multiplying the Sine of the Complement of the diſtance of the Sunne from the Meridian, by the Sine of the Complement of the Eleuation of the Pole, diuiding the product by the whole Sine, the quotient which commeth hereof ſhall yéeld the arke of your deſire. At both the ſixe houres, becauſe the one ſixe is the riſing, and the other the ſitting, there is then no altitude of the Sunne aboue the Horizon.
               Moreouer, to know how much the Meridian altitude is, of the Sunne entring into ♋, adde the greateſt Declination thereof, to the Complement of the Eleuation of the Pole: and by ſubtracting the greateſt Declination of the Sunne, from the complement of the Eleuation of the Pole, you ſhall likewiſe haue the Meridian altitude of the Sunne entring into ♑.
               You ſhall likewiſe ſéeke the height of the Sunne, being in the 10 degrée of ♉ aboue the Horizon, at 8 of the clock before noone, and at 4 after noone: at 7 in the morning, and 5

in the euening: at both 6. and the 5. houre in the morning, and 7. at night. Alſo at 5. in the morning and 7. in the euening, the Sunne being in the beginning of ♊.
               But becauſe the working of this, to finde out theſe altitudes, requireth much time and labour, we will ſet downe theſe diſtances ready found out, calculated for the Eleuation of the Pole 50.

               If therefore you will make your Quadrant Horologicall for the Eleuation of the Pole 50. 
                     d. extend a thread, or lay a ruler, from the centre E. by the 63. 
                     d. 30. 
                     m. of the limbe of the quadrant, beginning at F and where the thread ſo placed ſhall touch the Tropike of ♋, there make a point or marke. Againe, let the thread be placed vpon the 40. 
                     d. of the limbe, and where it ſhall touch the Equator, there alſo make a marke. Thirdly let y• thread be drawen by the 16. 
                     d. 30. 
                     m. of the quadrant: and where it ſhall touch the Tropike of ♑, there make likewiſe a marke. This done, ſearch out the centre (by the 5. Propoſſtion 4. Euclid) and ioyne theſe thrée markes into one arke, which ſhall be the line for the 12 hower. Afterward place the thread vpon the 61. 
                     d. 2. 
                     m. of the limbe, and where it ſhall cut the Tropike of ♋ note it. Draw likewiſe the thread vpon the 38. 
                     d. 23. 
                     m. of the

limbe, marke where it cutteth the Equator. Then by the 15▪ 
                  
                     d. 19. 
                     m. of the limbe extend the thread, making a marke in the ſection therof and the Tropike of ♑. Drawe into one arke theſe thrée markes (as you did before) finding out the common centre: ſo ſhall you haue the line of the 11. hower before noone, and 1. after noone. In like maner are the reſt of the hower lines drawen by 3. points accounted and found out by the altitude of the ſunne. But becauſe before 9. and after 3. in this Eleuation of the Pole it will not ſerue for this delineation, there muſt another be made by the table of the 12. Signes or Quadrangles. Therfore draw that from the 10. 
                     d. of ♉, ſo ſhall you haue a line or place wherein the third points may be marked. Then to prepare the points of the arke for the howers of 8. and 4. of 7. and 5. and both the 6. beſides the two markes made in the Tropike of ♋ and the Equator, let the third be noted in the arke drawen from the 10. degrée of ♉. 
                     〈◊〉
                   draw the line of the 5. and 7. howers, vſe beſides the Tropike of Cancer and this drawen from the 10. degrée of ♉, the third which ſhall come from the beginning of ♊. The line of 4. in the morning, and 8. in the euening is very ſhort, included in y• angle next vnto I. Thus you haue finiſhed 9 arkes or lines for the houres, of which each one of them doth ſhew two houres: except one which is onely for the 
                     •
                  2 houre.
               And to the intent that there ſhould be no ſpace left voyd and vnprofitable betwéene the Tropike of ♑ and the centre E. you may drawe in that place the vnequall houres, which you ſhall very eaſily doe on this maner. Deſcribe vpon the centre E. an arke very little diſtant from the Tropike of ♑, to be diuided into 6 equall parts, and take the middle point betwéene the beginning of that arke at S. and betwéene E. Then vpon this point▪ as it were a centre, make a halfe circle from S. to E. which ſhall be the line of the 6. vnequall hower, that is of midday. Afterward one foote of the compaſſes being placed in the ſame Semidiameter E. D. and remoued eche way as occaſion ſhall require:

and the other extended in the meane time ſo far that it may touch the ſecond point of the arke diuided into 6. partes, and the centre E. draw an arke or line from the centre to that point, which ſhal ſhew the 5. and 7. howers. Inlike maner are the other 4. drawen, one foote of the compaſſes being remoued, as neceſſity ſhal require, in the Semidiameter E. D (which may be prolonged if it ſhall be too ſhort) &amp; the compaſſes ſo opened, that the other foot may touch the point of the diuided arke and the centre E. and ioyne them all into one arke line: then fixe a thread in the centre E. well waxed, hauing two ſmall beades vpon it to moue with a plummet of iron or lead. Laſt of all prepare two ſights of braſſe or other metall with ioynts, which you muſt place in one right line vpon the ſide or edge A. B. ſo that you may direct them, and againe turne them downe vpon that ſide A. B. at your pleaſure: that (if you make this Dial vpon the Table or inſtrument preſcribed in the beginning of this book) they be no hinderance to you in trying or examining of your plats. Thus is your diall prepared: but for further inſtruction beholde the Figure.

                     TO know the hower of the day when the Sun ſhineth, worke thus. Firſt ſéeke out in ſome Calender in what Signe and degrée the Sun is at that day: then extend the thread with the beades vpon the Semidiameter E. D. and place the neathermoſt beade vpon that degrée, in the Table of the 12. Signes, which the Sunne then occupieth. Afterward lifting vp your quadrant, the thread with the plummet hanging at liberty, let the Sun beams paſſe thorow

both the ſights, and then the neathermoſt bead ſhall ſhew the hower of the day either before, or after noone: for eche line as you ſee, hath two howers, but you may eaſily diſcern what hower of the day it is.
                  The vnequall hower of the day is thus found out. The neather bead being placed vpon his iuſt degrée in the Zodiake, lay it vpon the arke of the 12. hower, the thread being extended: thus holding this immoueable, place the vppermoſt bead vpon y• line of the 6. hower vnequal. This done the Sun beames entring both y• ſights, the higheſt bead ſhal ſhew the vnequall, and the neathermoſt the equall hower.
                  The riſing and ſitting of the Sunne, whereby the length of the day and night is knowen, you ſhall finde out on this maner. Place the neather bead vpon the iuſt degrée of the Sunne in the Zodiake, then extend the thread vpon the ſemidiameter E. F. of the quadrant, and the bead ſhall ſhew at or betwéen what howers the Sunne riſeth and falleth.
                  The height of the Sunne. aboue the Horizon at any time of the day is thus taken. Receiue the Sunne beames by the holes in your ſights, and the thread with the plunmet hauing liberty to moue, ſhall cut in the limbe of the Quadrant the iuſt degrée of the altitude of the Sunne aboue the Horizon. In like maner is the Eleuation of the Starres aboue the Horizon ſearched out.
                  You ſhall finde out the eleuation of the Pole by the help of your Quadrant, thus. Take the height of the Sunne at 12 of the clock, when the dayes and nights bée of equall length, which being ſubtracted from 90 
                        d. the eleuation remaineth. But if you aſſay that vpon any other day then the Equinoct. you muſt conſider whether the Sunne occupieth the North, or the South ſignes, and then vſe the table of the Declination of the Sunne on this wiſe. When the Sunne is in the North ſignes, ſubſtract his declination from the Meridian height thereof. But if it be in the South ſignes adde the declination to his Meridian altitude. The remainder or totall ſumme being taken from 90.
                        d. the Eleuation of the Pole ſhall remaine.

                  FIrſt prepare a plat or Table of braſſe or firme and ſolide wood, which will not change or bend, ſomwhat thinne, let the forme of it be round, thrée inches broad, or more or leſſe as you will. Draw a circle nigh vnto the edg, and diuide it into 12. equal parts: wherein ſhal be placed the 12. Signes of the Zodiake, then diuide ech of theſe parts into 30. equal partes, which ſhall ſhew the number of the daies that the Sunne moueth in euery Sign. Make a ſecond circle, wherin you may number the daies, and a third circle wherein write the Caracters of the 12. Signes, as you ſée in the Figure following.
               Draw likewiſe another circle, wherein you may write the daies of euery moneth in the yéere, which you may doe by any Calender, but for more eaſines beholde the Table following, whereby you may likewiſe doe it.

               Hauing prepared this plat with the circles vpon it, for the 12. Signes and months, you muſt prepare an other whéele full of téeth, which you ſhall make on this maner.
               Take a thime Table or platte of the ſame matter your

other was, draw a circle vpon it ſo great as the inward circle of the firſt plat, and diuide it into 24. equall parts. Then draw lines from the centre to euery one of thoſe parts, vntill you haue ſo many as there be howers in the longeſt night in your Country. Then cut téeth by theſe lines for the howres, and write the number of them vpon the téeth as you ſée in this figure. Let the tooth for the 12. howre be ſo long from the centre to the end, as is betwéen the centre A. of the other plat and the circle of the 12. Signes. You muſt likewiſe make a hole in the centre of this whéele, of the ſame bignes of that, in the other plat.

The Polare Starre is a bright Starre in the North, placed in the tayle of the leſſer beare, and mooueth but a ſmall courſe, as in the figure the letter A. ſheweth. There is alſo another Starre of the leſſer beare greater and brighter then the other, and is noted with the letter B. and ſerueth to this purpoſe alſo. There is likewiſe in the greater beare called alſo Charles waine, and of countrie men the plough, two great bright ſtarres, and are placed almoſt in a right line with the Polare Starre; &amp; are noted with the letters C. D. And theſe two Starres haue 5 other bright Starres

by them, but not ſo great as the other be. Theſe Starres which you ſée in the figure, as al other, mooue equally aboue the Pole, and finiſh their courſe in 24 houres.
                  Therefore when you would know the houre of the night by this inſtrument, do thus. Place the right line of the long tooth of the 12 houre directly ouer the day of the moneth, and turne the handle on the backſide to the hole of the greater beare, and your inſtrument ſhall be prepared.

But if you cannot ſée the two Starres of the greater beare becauſe of clouds: and yet you may ſée the Polare Starre, and the Starre of the leſſer beare, noted with the letter B. remoue the handle on the backſide to the hole of the leſſer beare. Then lift vp your inſtrument as before, and beholde the Polare Starre at the hole, and turne the ruler to the foreſaid Starre of the leſſer beare, and you ſhall finde the true houre of the night, as before is taught.

                  The vſe of the Table of Sines.
                  
                     WHereas the making of ſome Dials, and this Table of Sines may ſéeme obſcure and hard to them who are not acquainted with Sinicall computation, it ſhalbe expedient to declare the vſe hereof, ſo much as perteineth to the vnderſtanding of this booke, omitting all other vſes as impertinent to our preſent purpoſe. Wherfore know that the Grades or Degrées are found in the vpper head of this Table, and the Minutes pertaining to the Degrées on the left ſide, &amp; in the Area or common méeting of them both, a number which is called the Sine, anſwerable to ech Degrée and Minute, offereth it ſelfe. Againe the Sine being found out, you may eaſily know the arke, that is, the Degrée and Minutes thereof, theſe being on the left hand, the other on the head or vpper part. Vnderſtand by the Complement that which remaineth of any number being taken or ſubſtracted from 90. Degrées. If at any time you enter the Table with iuſt Degrées without any Minutes, reſolue one Degrée into 60. Minutes, and then ſéeke out his Sine. And whereas you ſhall finde ſome numbers imperfect, you muſt remember to ſupply their want with thoſe which be perfect immediatly going before.
                  
                     Example.
                     The Eleuation of the Pole at Cambr. is 52. Degrées, whoſe Sine I deſire to know, therefore reſoluing one of the Degrées into Minutes, I enter the Table with 51. degrées,

60. Minutes, and in the common Area I finde the Sine to be 78801. If then you deſire to know the complement of this Eleuation, ſubſtract 52. out of 90. and the remainder ſhalbe 38. the complement thereof, and entring the Table with 37. 
                           d. 60. 
                           m. you ſhall finde in the Area 66. which number becauſe it is imperfect, you muſt ſupply the want thereof by adding the 3. former figures in that which is next before perfect, to wit, 615. and thē the whole number ſhalbe 61566. the Sine of 38. 
                           d. which is the Complement of 52. 
                           d. the Eleuation of the Pole.
                     Theſe thinges well conſidered, there is nothing in the booke ſo obſcure, but it ſhall ſéeme plaine and eaſie.
