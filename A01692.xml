            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).

            THE Famous Historie of Fryer BACON. Containing the wonderfull things that he did in his Life: Also the manner of his Death; With the Liues and Deaths of the two Coniurers, Bungye and Vandermast. Very pleasant and delightfull to be read.
            
               Of the Parents and Birth of Fryer Bacon, and how he addicted himselfe to Learning.
               
                  HE was borne by most mens opinions on the West part of England, &amp; was sonne to a wealthy Farmer, who put him to Schoole to the Parson of the Towne where hee was borne: not with intent that he should turne Fryer (as he did) but to get so much vnderstanding, that he might manage the better that wealth hee was to leaue him. But young

Bacon tooke his Learning so fast, that the Priest could not teach him any more, which made him desire his Master that he would speake to his Father to put him to Oxford, that he might not lose that little learning that hee had gained: his Master was very willing so to doe: and one day méeting his Father, told him, that hee had receiued a great blessing from God, in that he had giuen him so wise and hopefull a child, as his sonne Roger Bacon was (for so was he named) and wished him withall to doe his duty, and to bring vp so his Child, that hee might shew his thankfulnesse to God, which could not better be done then in making of him a Scholler; for he found by his sodaine taking of his learning, that hee was a childe likely to proue a very great Clerke: hereat old Bacon was not well pleased (for he desired to bring him vp to Plough and to the Cart, as hee himselfe was brought) yet he for reuerence sake to the Priest, showed not his anger, but kindly thanked him for his paines and counsell yet desired him not to speake any more concerning that matter; for hee knew best what best pleased himselfe, and that he would doe: so broke they off their talke, and parted.
               So soone as the old man came home, he called to his Sonne for his bookes, which when he had, he lock'd them vp, and gaue the Boy a Cart whip in the place of them, saying to him: Boy, I will haue you no Priest, you shall not be better learned then I, you can tell now by the Almanack when it is best sowing Wheat, when Barley, Pease, and Beanes: and when the best libbing is, when to sell Graine and Cattell I will teach thée; for I haue all Faires and Markets as perfit in my memory, as Sir Iohn our Priest has Masse without Booke: take mee this whip, I will teach thée the vse of it, it will be more profitable to thée then this harsh Latin: make no reply, but follow my counsell, or else by the Masse thou shalt féele the smart hand of my anger. Young Bacon thought this but hard dealing, yet would he not reply, but within

the whole world had bin there prepared in the best manner that Art could set them out: whilst hée feasted thus their smelling, hée waued his wand againe, and there came diuers Nations in sundry habits (as Russians, Polanders, Indians, Armenians) all bringing sundry kinds of Furres, such as their Countries yéelded: all which they presented to the King and Quéene: these Furres were so soft in the touch, that they highly pleased all those that handled them, then after some odde fantasticke dances (after their Countrey manner) they vanished away: then asked Fryer Bacon the Kings Maiesty, if that hée desired any more of his skill? the King answered that hée was fully satistied for that time, and that hée onely now thought of something that hée might bestow on him, that might partly satisfie the kindnesse that hée had receiued. Fryer Bacon said, that hée desired nothing so much as his Maiestice loue, and if that he might be assured of that, hée would thinke himselfe happy in it: for that (said the King) be thou euer sure of it, in token of which receiue this Iewell, and withall gaue him a costly Iewell from his necke. The Fryer did with great reuerence thanke his Maiestie, and said: as your Maiesties vassall you shall euer finde me ready to doe you seruice, your time of néede shall finde it both beneficiall and delightfull. But amongst all these Gentlemen, I sée not the man that your Grace did send for me by, sure he hath lost his way, or else met with some sport that detaines him so long, I promised to be here before him, and all this noble Assembly can witnesse I am as good as my word; I heare him comming: with that entered the Gentleman all be durted (for he had rid through ditches, quagmires▪ plashes, and waters, that hée was in a most pittifull case) hée séeing the Fryer there looked full angerly, and bid a pore on all his Deuils, for they had led him out of his way, and almost drowned him. Be not angry Sir (said Fryer Bacon) here is an old friend of yours that hath more cause; for shée hath tarried these

thrée houres for you (with that hee pulled vp the Hangings, and behinde them stood a Kitchin-maide with a hasting ladle in her hand) now am I as good as my word with you: for I promised to helpe you to your swéetheart, how do you like this? So ill, answered the Gentleman, that I will be reuenged of you. Threaten not (said Fryer Bacon) least I do you more shame, and doe you take héede how you giue schollers the lye againe: but because I know not how well you are stored with money at this time, I will beare your wenches charges home; with that she vanished away: the King, Quéene, and all the company laughed to sée with what shame this Gentleman indured the sight of his greasie swéet-heart: but the Gentleman went away discontented. This bone, Fryer Bacon tooke his leaue of the King and Quéne, and receiued from them diuers gifts (as well as thankes) for his Art he shewed them.
            
            
               How Fryer Bacon deceiued his Man, that would fast for his conscience sake.
               FRyer Bacon had one onely man to attend on him, and hée too was none of the wisest, for hee kept him in charity, more then for any seruice he had of him. This man of his (named Miles) neuer could indure to fast as other religious persons did, for alwayes hee had in one corner, or another, flesh, which hee would eate when his Maister eat bread only, or else did fast and abstaine from all things. Fryer Bacon séeing this, thought at one time or other to be euen with him, which he did one Fryday in this manner. Miles on the Thursday night had prouided a great blacke-pudding for his Frydayes fast; this pudding put he in his pocket (thinking belike to heate it so, for his Maister had no fire on those dayes) on the next day, who was so demure as Miles, hee looked as though hee would not haue eat any thing: when his

Maister offered him some bread, hée refused it, saying, his sinnes deserued a greater penance then one dayes fast in a whole wéeke: his Maister commended him for it, and bid him take héed that he did not dissemble: for if he did, it would at last be knowne; then were I worse then a Turke said Miles: so went he forth as if he would haue gone to pray priuately, but it was for nothing but to prey vpon his blacke pudding; that pulled he out, (for it was halfe roasted with the heate of his bum) and sell to it lustily; but he was deceiued, for hauing put one end in his mouth, he could neither get it out againe nor bite it off, so that hee stamped out for helpe: his Maister hearing him, came, and finding him in that manner, tooke hold of the other end of the pudding, and led him to the hall, and shewed him to all the Schollers, saying: Sée here my good friends and fellow Students what a deuout man my seruant Miles is, he loueth not to breake a fast day, witnesse this pudding that his conscience will not let him swallow: I will haue him to be an example for you all, then tyed hee him to a window by the end of the pudding, where poore Miles stood like a Beare tyed by the nose to a stake, and indured many floutes and mockes: at night his Maister released him from his penance; Miles was glad of it, and did vow neuer to breake more fast dayes whilst that he liued.
            
            
               How Fryer Bacon saued a Gentleman that had giuen himselfe to the Deuill.
               IN Oxfordshire there liued a Gentleman, that had through his riotous expences wasted a faire Inheritance that was left him by his father: After which hee grew so poore, that hee had not wherewith to buy himselfe so much bread as would maintaine his miserable life: the memory of his former state that hee had liued

in, and the present want that he now sustained, made him to grow desperate and regardlesse both of his soule and bodies estate; which gaue the Deuill occasion to worke vpon his weaknesse in this manner following.
               On a time, hee being alone full of griefe and care, (griefe for his follies past, and care how to get a poore liuing for the remainder of his dayes) the Deuill came to him and asked him what hée wanted (hée came not in a shape terrible, but like an old penny-father.) This Gentleman was amazed at his sodaine presence, but hearing him demand of his wants, hée tooke to him courage and said: I want all things, I want money to buy my apparell, money to buy mée meat, money to redéeme my Land, and money to pay my debts: Can, or will you helpe mée in this misery? I will, answered the Deuill, on some conditions helpe you to money for to supply all these wants, and that sodainly. On any condition, said the Gentleman, helpe mée, and I sweare for to performe them: I take no oathes (answered the Deuill) I must haue bonds, if you will doe so, méet mée by the Woods side to morrow morning, and there I will haue the moneys ready: I will, said the Gentleman (for hée poore man was glad of it on any conditions, as hee said (before.) The next day hee went to the Wood where the Deuill had promis
                     •
                  d to méet him: long had hée not béene there, but hée beheld the Deuill comming, and after him two other like Seruingmen with Bagges of money: this reioyced the poore Gentlemans heart to thinke that hée should once againe liue like a man. The Deuill comming to him said: sonne I will performe my promise vnto you, if that you will seale to the conditions that I haue here already drawne: willingly said-the Gentleman, I will, I pray read them The Deuill read them to this effect; that he lent him so much money as he should haue néed of, to be imployed to these vses following: First, to redéeme his morgag'd Land; next to pay his debts: lastly, to buy him such necessaries as hée wanted:

this to be lent on this condition, that so soone as he had paid all his debts, that he should be at the lenders disposing, and without any delay, fréely to yéeld himselfe to him vpon the first demand of the aforesaid lender. To this the Gentleman sealed, and had the money carried to his Chamber, with which money hée in short time redéemed his Land, and bought such things as he néeded, and likewise payed all his debts, so that there was not any man that could aske of him one penny.
               Thus liued this Gentleman once againe in great credit, and grew so great a husband that hée increased his estate, and was richer then euer his father before him was: but long did this ioy of his not continue, for one day hée being in his Studie the Deuill appeared vnto him, and did tell him that now his Land was redéemed, and his debts paid, and therefore the time was come that hee must yéeld himselfe to his mercy, as hée was bound by bond. This troubled the Gentleman to heare, but more to thinke how that he must become a slaue to a stranger that hée did not know (for hée knew not as yet that he was the Deuill) but being vrged to answer for himselfe (by the Deuill) hée said that hée had not as yet paid all his debts, and therefore as yet hée was not liable to the bonds strait conditions. At this the Deuill séemed angry and with a fearefull noyse transformed himselfe to an vgly shape, saying: Alas poore wretch, these are poore excuses that thou framest, I kn
                     •
                  w them all to be false, and so will proue them to thy face to morrow morning, till when I leaue thée to despaire: So with great noyse he went his way, leauing the Gentleman halfe dead with feare.
               When hée was gone, the Gentleman reuiuing bethought himselfe in what a miserable state he was now in, then wished he that he had liued and died poorely, then cursed he all his ambitious thoughts, that led him first to desire againe that wealth which he had so vainly by his riot lost: then would hee curse his prodigall expences

that were the originall of all his misery: thus was he tormented along time in his minde, at last he fully resolued to end his wretched life by some violent death, and to that end he went forth thinking to kill himselfe, which he had done, had it not béene for the Fryer: for as he was falling vpon his sword, Fryer Bacon came by and called to him to hold, which he did. Fryer Bacon demanded of him the cause why he was so desparate that he would run headlong to hell? O sir, said he, the cause is great, and the relation is so terrible to me, that I would intreat you not to trouble me any more, but to leaue me to my owne wil: his answer filled the Fryer with amazement &amp; pitty both at once, which made him to vrge him in this manner. Sir, should I leaue you to his wilfull damnation, I were vnfit euer hereafter to weare or touch any robe that belongeth vnto the holy Order, whereof I am a Brother; you know (I doubt not) that there is giuen power to the Church to absolue penitent sinners, let not your wilfulnesse take away from you that benefit which you may receiue by it: fréely confesse your selfe (I pray) you vnto me, and doubt not but I will giue your troubled conscience ease: Father (said this Gentleman) I know all that you haue spoken is truth, and I haue many times receiued comfort from the mother Church, (I dare not say our, for I feare that shee will neuer receiue me for a childe) I haue no part in her benediction, yet since you request so earnestly the cause, I will tell you, heare it and tremble. Know then that I haue giuen my selfe to the deuill for a little wealth, and he to morrow in this Wood must haue mée: now haue you my griefe, but I know not how to get comfort. This is strange (quoth Fryer Bacon) yet be of good comfort, penitentiall teares may doe much, which sée you doe not spare: soone I will visit you at your house, and giue you that comfort (I hope) that will beget you againe to goodnesse: the Gentleman with these words was somewhat comforted and returned home. At night Fryer

                  Bacon came to him and found him full of teares for his haynous offence, for those teares he gaue him hope of pardon, demanded further what conditions hee had made with the Deuil: the gentleman told him, how that he had promised himselfe to him so soone as he had paid all his debts: which he now had done, for he owed not one peny to any man liuing. Well, said Fryer Bacon, continue thy sorrow for thy sinnes, and to morrow meete him without feare, and be thou content to stand to the next mans iudgement that shall come that way, whether thou doest belong to the deuill or no: feare not, but do so, and be thou assured that I will be he that shall come by, and will giue such iudgement on thy side, that thou shalt bee free from him: with that Fryer Bacon went home, and the Gentleman went to his prayers.
               In the morning the Gentleman (after that he had blessed himselfe) went to the Wood where he found the deuill ready for him, so soone as he came néere, the deuill said: now deceiuer are you come, now shalt thou sée that I can and will proue that thou hast paid all thy debts, and therefore thy soule belongeth to me. Thou art a deceiuer (said the gentleman) and gauest me money to cheat me of my soule, for else why wilt thou be thy own Iudge: let me haue some other to iudge betwéene vs. Content said the Deui
                     •
                  l, take whom thou wilt: then I will haue (said the gentleman) the next man that cōmeth this way: hereto the Deuill agréed. No sooner were these words ended, but Fryer Bacon came by, to whom this Gentleman spake, and requested, that he would be iudge in a waighty matter betwéene them two: the Fryer said, he was content, so both parties were agréed: the Deuill said they were, and told Fryer Bacon how the case stood betwéene them in this manner.
               Know Fryer, that I séeing this prodigal like to starue for want of food, lent him money, not onely to buy him victuals, but also to redéeme his lands and pay his debts, conditionarily that so soone as his debts were paid, that

hée should giue himselfe fréely to mée, to this here is his hand (shewing him the Bond) now my time, is expired, for all his debts are paid which hée cannot denie. This case is plaine, if it be so that his debts are paid: his silence confirmes it said the Diuell, therefore giue him a iust sentence. I will said Frier Bacon: But first tell me (speaking to the Gentleman) didst thou neuer yet giue the Deuill any of his mony backe, nor requite him any wayes: neuer had hée any thing of me as yet (answered the Gentleman) then neuer let him haue any thing of thée and thou art frée: deceiuer of mankind, said he (speaking to the Deuill) it was thy bargaine, neuer to meddle with him so long as hée was indebted to any, now how canst thou demand of him any thing, when he is indebted for all that hée hath to thée, when hée payeth thée thy money, then take him as thy due; till then thou hast nothing to doe with him: and so I charge thée to be gone. At this, the Deuill vanished with great horror, but Fryer Bacon comforted the Gentleman, and sent him home with a quiet conscience, bidding him neuer to pay the Deuils money backe as he tendred his owne safety: which he promised for to obserue.
            
            
               How Fryer Bacon made a Brasen head to speake, by the which hee would haue walled England about with Brasse.
               FRyer Bacon reading one day of the many conquests of England, bethought himselfe how hée might kéepe it hereafter from the like conquests, and so make himselfe famous hereafter to all posterities: This (after great study) hée found could be no way so well done as one; which was to make a head of Brasse, and if he could make this head to speake (and heare it when it speakes) then might hée be able to wall all England about with Brasse. To this purpose hée got one Fryer Bungey to assist him, who was a great Scholler and a Magician,

(but not to bée compared to Fryer Bacon) these two with great study and paines so framed a head of Brasse, that in the inward parts thereof there was all things (like as is in a naturall mans head: this being done, they were as farre from perfection of the worke as they were before, for they knew not how to giue those parts that they had made motion, without which it was impossible that it should speake: many bookes they read, but yet could not finde out any hope of what they sought, so that at the last they concluded to raise a spirit, and to know of him that which they could not attaine to by their owne studies. To do this they prepared all things ready and went one Euening to a Wood thereby, and after many ceremonies vsed, they spake the words of coniuration, which the Deuill straight obeyed and appeared vnto them, asking what they would? know, said Fryer Bacon, that wée haue made an artificiall head of Brasse, which wée would haue to speake, to the furtherance of which wée haue raised thée, and being raised, wée will here kéepe thée, vnlesse thou tell to vs the way and manner how to make this Head to speake. The Deuill told him that he had not that power of himselfe: beginner of lyes (said Fryer Bacon) I know that thou dost dissemble, and therefore tell it vs quickly, or else wée will here bind thée to remaine during our pleasures. At these threatnings the Deuill consented to doe it, and told them, that with a continuall sume of the sir hotest Simples it should haue motion, and in one month space speake, the Time of the moneth or day hée knew not: also hée told them, that if they heard it not before it had done speaking, all their labour should be lost: they being satisfied, licensed the Spirit for to depart.
               Then went these two learned Fryers home againe, and prepared the Simples ready, and made the fume, and with continuall watching attended when this Brasen head would speake: thus watched they for thrée wéekes without any rest, so that they were so weary

and sléepy, that they could not any longer retaine from rest: then called Fryer Bacon his man Miles, and told him, that it was not vnknowne to him what paines Fryer Bungy and himselfe had taken for thrée wéekes space, onely to make, and to heare the Brasen-head speake, which if they did not, then had they lost all their labour, and all England had a great losse thereby: therefore hée intreated Miles that he would watch whilest that they sléep, and call them if the Head speake. Feare not, good Master (said Mailes) I will not sléepe, but harken and attend vpon the head, and if it doe chance to speake, I will call you: therefore I pray take you both your rests and let mée alone for watching this head. After Fyer Bacon had giuen him a great charge: The second time, Fryer Bungy and he went to sléepe, and left Miles alone to watch the Brasen head: Miles, to kéepe him from sleeping, got a Tabor and Pipe, and being mercy disposed, sung this Song to a Northren tune,
               
                  
                     
                        
                           Of cam'st thou not from New-Castle.
                           
                              To couple is a custome,
                              all things thereto agree:
                              Why should not I then loue?
                              since loue to all is free.
                           
                           
                              But Ile haue one that's pretty,
                              her cheekes of scarlet die?
                              For to breed my delight,
                              when that I ligge her by.
                           
                           
                              Though vertue be a Dowry,
                              yet Ile chuse money store:
                              If my Loue proue vntrue,
                              with that I can get more.
                           
                           
                              The faire is oft vnconstant,
                              the blacke is often proud.
                              
                                 Ile chuse a louely browne,
                              come fidler scrape thy crowd.
                           
                           
                              Come fidler scrape thy crowd,
                              for Peggie the browne is she,
                              Must be my Bride, God guide
                              that Peggie and I agree.
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               With his owne Musicke, and such Songs as these spent he his time, and kept from sleeping, at last, after some noyse the Head spake these two words, Time is. Miles hearing it to speake no more: thought his Master would be angry if hee waked him for that, and there
                     •
                  ore hee let them both sleepe, and began to mocke the Head in this manner: Thou Brazen-faced Head, hath my Master tooke all this paines about thee, and now dost thou requi
                     •
                  e him with two words, Time is: had hée watched with a Lawyer so long as he hath watched with thee, he would haue giuen him more, and better words then thou hast yet, if thou can speake no wiser, they shall sléepe till doomes day for me: Time is: I know Time is, and that you shall heare good-man Brazen-face.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           To the tune of Daintie come thou to me.
                           
                              Time is for some to plant,
                              Time is for some to sowe;
                              Time is for some to graft
                              The horne as some doe know.
                           
                           
                              Time is for some to eate,
                              Time is for some to sleepe,
                              Time is for some to laugh,
                              Time is for some to weepe.
                           
                           
                              Time is for some to sing,
                              Time is for some to pray,
                              
                                 Time is for some to creepe,
                              That haue drunke all the day.
                           
                           
                              Time is to cart a Bawd,
                              Time is to whip a Whore,
                              Time is to hang a Theefe,
                              And time is for much more.
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               Doe you tell vs Copper-nose, when Time is, I hope we Schollers know our Times, when to drinke drunke, when to kisse our Hostis, when to goe on her score, and when to pay it, that time comes seldome. After halfe an houre had passed, the Head did speake againe, two words, which were these: Time was. Miles respected these words as little as he did the former, and would not wake them, but still scoffed at the Brasen head, that it had learne no better words, and had such a Tutor as his Master: and in scorne of it sung this Song.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           To the tune of a rich Merchant man.
                           
                              Time was when thou a Kettle
                               wert fill'd with better matter:
                              But Fryer Bacon did thee spoyle,
                               when he thy sides did batter.
                           
                           
                              Time was when conscience dwelled
                               with men of occupation:
                              Time was when Lawyers did not thriue,
                               so well by mens vexation.
                           
                           
                              Time was when Kings and Beggars
                               of one poore stuffe had being:
                              Time was when office kept no Knaues:
                               that time it was worth seeing.
                           
                           
                              Time was a bowle of water,
                               did giue the face reflection,
                              
                                 Time was when women knew no paint:
                               which now they call Complexion.
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  Time was: I know that Brazen-face, without your telling. I know Time was, and I know what things there was when Time was, and if you speake no wiser, no Master shall be waked for mée. Thus Miles talked and sung till another halfe houre was gone, then the Brazen-head spake againe these words; Time is past: and therewith fell downe, and presently followed a terrible noyse, with strange flashes of fire, so that Miles was halfe dead with feare: At this noyse the two Fryers awaked, and wondred to sée the whole roome so full of smoake, but that béeing vanished they might perceiue the Brazen-head broken and lying on the ground: at this sight they grieued, and called Miles to know how this came. Miles halfe dead with feare, said that it fell downe of it selfe, and that with the noyse and fire that followed hée was almost frighted out of his wits: Fryer Bacon asked him if hée did not speake? yes (quoth Miles) it spake, but to no purpose. Ile haue a Parret speake better in that time that you haue béene teaching this Brazen head. Out on thée villaine (said Fryer Bacon) thou hast vndone vs both, hadst thou but called vs when it did speake, all England had bin walled round about with Brasse, to its glory and our eternall fames: what were the words it spake? very few (said Miles) and those were none of the wisest that I haue heard neither: first he said Time is. Hadst thou call'd vs then (said Fryer Bacon) wée had béene made for euer: then (said Miles) halfe an houre after it spake againe and said, Time was. And woulst thou not call vs then (said Bungry?) Alas (said Miles) I thought he would haue told me some long Tale, and then I purposed to haue called you: then halfe an houre after he cried Time is past and made such a noyse, that hée hath waked you himselfe mée thinkes. At this Fryer Bacon was in such a rage, that hée would

haue beaten his man, but he was restrained by Bungey: but neuertheles for his punishment he with his Art struck him dumbe for one whole months space. Thus that great worke of these learned Fryers was ouerthrown (to their great griefes) by this simple fellow.
            
            
               How Fryer Bacon by his Art tooke a Towne, when the King had lyen before it three months, without doing to it any hurt.
               IN those times when Fryer Bacon did all his strange trickes, the Kings of England had a great part of France, which they held a long t
                     •
                  me, till ciuill warres at home in this Land made them to lose it: it did chance that the King of England (for some cause best knowne to himselfe) went into France with a great Armie, where af
                     •
                  er many victories, hee did besiege a strong Towne, and lay before it full thrée moneths, without doing to the Towne any great damage, but rather receiued the hurt himselfe. This did so vexe the King, the hée sought to take it in any way, either by policy or strength: To this intent hee made Proclamation▪ that whosoeuer could deliuer this Towne into his hand, hée should haue for his paines ten thousand C
                     •
                  ownes truely paid. This was proclaimed, but there was none found that would vndertake it: At length she newes did come into England of this great reward that was promised. Fryer Bacon hearing of it, went into France, and being admitted to the Kings presence, hee thus 
                     •
                  pake vnto him: Your Maiestie I am sure, hath not quite forgot your poore subiect Bacon, the loue that you shewed to mee being last in your presence, hath drawne mée for to leaue my Countrey, and my Studies, to doe your Maiestie seruice: I beséech your Grace, to command mée so farre as my poore Art or life may doe you pleasure. The King thanked him for his loue, but told him, that

hée had now more néed of Armes then Art, and wanted braue Souldiers more then learned Schollers. Fryer Bacon answered, Your Grace saith well; but let mée (vnder correction) tell you, that Art oftentimes doth those things that are impossible to Armes, which I will make good in some few examples. I will speake onely of things performed by Art and Nature, wherein shall be nothing Magicall: and first by the figuration of Art, there may be made Instruments of Nauigation without men to rowe in them, as great Ships to brooke the Sea, onely with one man to steere them, and they shall sayle farre more swiftly then it they were full of men. Also Chariots that shall moue with an vnspeakable force, without any liuing creature to stirre them. Likewise, an Instrument may be made to flye withall, if one fit in the midst of the Instrument, &amp; doe turne an Engine, by which the wings being Artificially composed, may beat ayre after the manner of a flying Bird. By an Instrument of thrée fingers high, and thrée fingers broad, a man may rid himselfe and others form all Imprisonment: yea, such an Instrument may easily be made, whereby a man may violently draw vnto him a thousand men, will they, nill they, or any other thing. By Art also an Instrument may bée made, wherewith men may walke in the bottome of the Sea or Riuers without bodily danger: this Alexander the Great vsed (as the Ethnick Phylosopher reporteth) to the end he might behold the secrets of the Seas. But Physicall Figurations are farre more strange: for by that may be framed Perspects and Looking-glasses, that one thing shall appeare to be many, as one man shall appeare to be a whole Army, and one Sunne or Moone shall seeme diuers. Also perspects may be so framed, that things farre off shall séeme most nigh vnto vs: With one of these did Iulius Caesar from the Sea coasts in France marke and obserue the situation of the Castles in England. Bodies may also be so framed, that the greatest things shall appeare to be the least, the

highest lowest, the most secret to bée the most manifest, and in such like sort the contrary. Thus did Socrates perceiue, that the Dragon which did destroy the Citie and Countrey adioyning with his noysome breath, and contagious influence, did lurke in the dennes betwéene the Mountaines: and thus may all things that are done in Cities or Armies be discouered by the enemies. Againe, in such wise may bodies bée framed, that venemous and infectious influences may be brought whether a man will: In this did Aristotle instruct Alexander; through which instruction the poyson of a Basiliske, being lift vp vpon the wall of a Citie, the poyson was conuayd into the Citie, to the destruction thereof: Also Perspects may be made to deceiue the sight, as to make a man beléeue that hée séeth great store of riches, when that there is not any. But it appertaineth to a higher power of Figuration, that beames should be brought and assembled by diuers flexions and reflexions in any distance that we will, to burne any thing that is apposite vnto it, as it is witnessed by those Perspects or Glasses that burne before and behinde: But the greatest and chiefest of all figurations and things figured, is to describe the heauenly bodies, according to their length and breadth in a corporall Figure, wherein they may corporally moue with a daily motion. These things are worth a Kingdome to a wise man. These may suffise, my royall Lord, to shew what Art can doe: and these, with many things more as strange, I am able by Art to performe. Then take no thought for winning this Towne; for by my Art you shall (ere many dayes be past) haue your desire.
               The King all this while heard him with admiration: but hearing him now say, that hée would vndertake to win the Towne, hée burst out in these spéeches: Most learned Bacon, doe but what thou hast said, and I will giue thée what thou most desirest, either wealth, or honour, choose which thou wilt, and I will be as ready to

performe, as I haue béene to promise.
               Your Maiesties loue is all that I séeke (said the Fryer) let mee haue that, and I haue honour enough, for wealth, I haue content, the wise, should séeke no more: but to the purpose. Let your Pioners raise vp a mount so high (or rather higher) then the wall, and then shall you see some probability of that which I haue promised.
               This Mount in two dayes was raised: then Fryer Bacon went with the King to the Top of it, and did with a perspect shew to him the Towne, as plainely as if hée had beene in it: at this the King did wonder, but Fryer Bacon told him, that hée should wonder more, ere next day noone: against which Time, he desired him to haue his whole Army in readinesse, for to scale the wall vpon a signall giuen by him, from the Mount. This the King promised to doe, and so returned to his Tent full of Ioy, that hée should gaine this strong Towne. In the morning Fryer Bacon went vp to the Mount and set his Glasses, and other Instruments vp: in the meane time the King ordered his Army, and stood in a readinesse for to giue assault; when the signall was giuen, which was the wauing of a Flagge: Ere nine of the clocke Fryer Bacon had burnt the State-house of the Towne, with other houses onely by his Mathematicall Glasses, which made the whole Towne in an vprore, for none did know how it came: whilest that they were quenching of the same, Fryer Bacon did waue his Flagge: vpon which signall giuen, the King set vpon the Towne, and tooke it with little or no resistance. Thus through the Art of this learned man the King got this strong Towne, which hée could not doe with all his men without Fryer Bacons helpe.
            
            
               
               How Fryer Bacon ouer-came the German Coniurer Vandermast, and make a Spirit of his owne carry him into Germany.
               THE King of England after hée had taken in the Towne, shewed great mercy to the Inhabitants, giuing some of them their liues fréely, and others hée set at libertie for their Gold: the Towne hée kept as his owne, and swore the chiefe Citizens to be his true Subiects. Presently after the King of France sent an Ambassadour to the King of England, for to intreat a peace betwéene them. This Ambassadour being come to the King, he feasted him (as it is the manner of Princes to doe) and with the best sports as he had then, welcomed him. The Ambassadour seeing the King of England so free in his Loue, desired likewise to giue him some taste of his good liking, and to that intent sent for one of his fellowes (being a Germane, and named Vandermast) a famous Coniurer, who being come, hée told the King, that since his Grace had béene so bountifull in his loue to him, he would shew him (by a seruant of his) such wonderfull things, that his Grace had neuer séene the like before. The King demaunded of him, of what nature those things, were that hée would doe? The Embassadour answered, that they were things done by the Art of Magicke. The King hearing of this, sent straight for Fryer Bacon, who presently came, and brought Fryer Bungey with him.
               When the Banquet was done, Vandermast did aske the King, if hée desired to sée any Spirit of any man deceased; and if that he did, hée would raise him in such manner and fashion as he was in when that hée liued. The King told him, that aboue all men hée desired to sée Pompey the Great, who could abide no equall. Vandermast by his Art raised him, armed in such manner as hée

was when hée was slaine at the Eattell of Pharsalia: at this they were all highly contented. Fryer Bacon presently raised the ghost of Iulius Caesar, who could abide no Superiour, and had slaine this Pompey at the Battell of Pharsalia: At the sight of him they were all amazed, but the King who sent for Bacon: and Vandermast said that there was some man of Art in that presence, whom hée desired to sée. Fryer Bacon then shewed himselfe, saying; It was I Vandermast, that raised Caesar, partly to giue content to this royall presence, but chiefely for to conquer thy Pompey, as he did once before, at that great Battell of Pharsalia, which he now againe shall doe. Then presently began a fight being Caesar and Pompey, which continued a good space, to the content of all, except Vandermast. At last Pompey was ouercome and slaine by Caesar; then vanished they both away.
               My Lord Embassadour (said the King) me thinks that my Englishman hath put downe your German: hath he no better running then this? Yes, answered Vandermast, your Grace shall sée me put downe your Englishman, ere that you goe from hence: and therefore Fryer prepare thy selfe with thy best of Art to withstand me. Alas, said Fryer Bacon, it is a little thing will serue to resist thée i

                   this kind. I haue here one that is my inferior (shewing him Fryer Bungey) try thy Art with him; and if thou doe put him to the worst, then will I deale with thée, and not till then.
               Fryer Bungey then began to shew his Art; and after some turning and looking on his Booke, he brought vp among them the Hysperian Tree, which did beare golden Apples; these Apples were kept by a waking Dragon, that lay vnder the Trée: Hée hauing done this, bid Vandermast finde one that durst gather the fruit. Then Vandermast did raise the ghost of Hercules in his habit that he wore when that he was liuing, and with his Club on his shoulder: Here is one, said Vandermast, that

shall gather fruit from this Trée: this is Hercules, that in his life time gathered of this Fruit, and made the Dragon couch: and now againe shall hée gather it in spight of all opposition: As Hercules was going to plucke the fruit, Fryer Bacon held vp his wand, at which Hercules stayed and séemed fearefull. Vandermast bid him for to gather of the fruit, or else hée would torment him. Hercules was more fearefull, and said, I cannot, nor I dare not; for here great Bacon stands, whose charmes are farre more powerfull then thine, I must obey him Vandermast. Hereat Vandermast curst Hercules, and threatned him: But Fryer Bacon laughed, and bid him not to chafe himselfe ere that his iourney was ended; for séeing (said he) that Hercules will doe nothing at your command, I will haue him doe you some seruice at mine: with that hée bid Hercules carry him home into Germany. The Deuill obeyed him, and tooke Vandermast on his backe, and went away with him in all their sights. Hold Fryer, cried the Embassadour, I will not loose Vandermast for halfe my Land. Content your selfe my Lord, answered Fryer Bacon, I haue but sent him home to sée his wife, and ere long he may returne. The King of England thanked Fryer Bacon, and forced some gifts on him for his seruice that hee had done for him; for Fryer Bacon did so little respect money, that he neuer would take any of the King.
            
            
               How Fryer Bacon through his wisdome saued the endangered liues of three Brethren.
               THE Peace being concluded betwéene the King of England and the King of France; the King of England came againe into his Countrey of England, where he was receiued very ioyfully of all his Subiects: But in his absence had happened a discord betweene thrée Brethren, the like hath not béene often heard. This it was:

A rich Gentleman of England dyed, and left behinde him three Sonnes. Now for some reason (which was best knowne to himselfe) he appointed none of them by name to be his heyre, but spake to them all after this manner: You are all my Sonnes, and I loue you all as a Father should doe, all alike, not one better then the other: and cause I would alwayes doe rightly so néere as I can, I leaue all my Lands and goods to him that loues me best: These were his last words that he spake, concerning any worldly affaires.
               After he was dead and buried, there arose a great controuersie betwixt them, who should inherit their Fathers Goods and Lands, euery one pleading for himselfe, how that hée loued his Father best. All the cunning Lawyers of the Kingdome could say nothing to the purpose, concerning this case, so that they were inforced to begge of the King a grant for a combat: for they would not share the Lands and Goods amongst them, but eu
                     •
                  ry one desired all or else nothing. The King séeing no other way to end this controuersie, granted a combat; the two eldest being to fight first, and the conquerour to fight with the yongest, and the suruiuer of them was to haue the Land.
               The day being come that was set for these combatants, they all came in armed for the fight, Fryer Bacon being there present, and seeing such thrée lustie young men like to perish, and that by their owne flesh and bloud, grieued very much, and went to the King, desiring his Maiestie that he would stay the fight, and he would finde a meanes without any bloodshed to end the matter: the King was very glad hereof, and caused the Combatants to be brought before him, to whom he said: Gentlemen, to saue the bloud of you all, I haue found a way, and yet the controuersie shall be ended that is now amongst you: Are you contented to stand to his Iudgement that I shall appoint? They all answered,

that they were. Then were they bid to returne thrée dayes after. In that time Fryer Bacon had caused the Body of their deceased Father to be taken out of the ground, and brought to the Court: the body hée did cause to be bound to a Stake, naked from the middle vpwards, and likewise prepared thrée Bowes and Shafts for the thrée Brethren: all these kept hée secretly.
               The third day being come, came these thrée Brethren, to whom Fryer Bacon in the presence of the King, gaue the thrée Bowes and Shafts, saying, Be not offended at what I haue done, there is no other way but this to iudge your cause: Sée here is the body of your dead Father, shoot at him; for he that commeth néerest to his heart, shall haue all the Lands and Goods.
               The two eldest prepared themselues, and shot at him, and stucke their Arrowes in his Breast. 
                     ••
                  en bid they the yongest to shoot: but hée refused it, saying, I will rather loose all, then wound that body that I so loued liuing: Had you euer had but halfe that loue (in you) to him that I haue, you would rather haue had your owne bodies mangled, then to suffer his liuelesse Cops thus to be vsed; nay, you doe not onely suffer it, but you are the actors of this act of shame: and speaking this, hée wept.
               Fryer Bacon séeing this, did giue the Iudgement on his side, for he loued his Father best, and therefore had all his Lands and Goods: the other two Brothers went away with shame for what they had done. This déed of Fryer Bacons was highly commended of all men; for hée did not onely giue true Iudgement, but also saued much blood that would haue béene shed, had they béene suffered to haue fought.
            
            
               
               How Fryer Bacon serued the Theeues that robbed him, and of the sport that his man Miles had with them.
               IT was reported about the Countrey, how that the King had giuen Fryer Bacon great store of Treasure. The report of this wealth made thrée Théeues plot to rob Fryer Bacons house, which they put in practise one Euening in this fashion. They knockt at the doore, and were let in by Miles: No sooner were they in, but they tooke hold of him, and led him into the house, and finding Fryer Bacon there, they told him that they came for some money, which they must and would haue ere they departed from thence. Hée told them, that hée was but ill stored with money at that time, and therefore desired them to forbeare him till some other time. They answered him againe, that they knew that hée had enough, and therefore it was but folly to delay them, but straight let them haue it by faire meanes, or else they would vse that extreamitie to him that hée would bée loath to suffer. Hée séeing them so resolute, told them that they should haue all that hée had, and gaue to them one hundred pounds a man. Herewith they séemed content, and would haue gone their wayes. Nay said Fryer Bacon, I pray Gentlemen at my request tarry a little, and heare some of my mans Musicke; you are hyred reasonable well already, I hope in courtesie you will not deny mée so small a request. That will wée not, (said they all.)
               
                  Miles thought now to haue some sport with them, which hée had, and therefore plain lustily on his Tabor and Pipe: so soone as they heard him play (against their wils) they fell a dauncing▪ and that after such a laborious manner, that they quickly wearied themselues (for they had all that while the bagges of money in their hands.) Yet

had Fryer Bacon not reuenge enough on them, but bid his man Miles leade them some larger measure as hee thought fitting, which Miles did. Miles straight ledde them out of the house into the fields, they followed him, dauncing after a wilde Anticke manner: Then led hée them ouer a broad dike full of water, and they followed him still, but not so good a way as hée went (for he went ouer the Bridge, but they by reason of their dauncing, could not kéepe the Bridge, but fell off, and dauncing through the water) then led hee them through a way where a horse might very well haue béene vp to the belly; they followed him, and were so durtie, as though they had wallowed in the myre like Swine. Sometime gaue hée them rest onely to laugh at them: then were they so sleepie when hée did not play, that they fell to the ground. Then on the sudden would hée play againe, and make them start vp and follow him. Thus kept hée them the better part of the night. At last hée in pitie left playing, and let them rest. They being asleepe on the bare ground, hée tooke their money from them, and gaue them this Song for their farewell, To the tune of, Oh doe me no harme good man.
               
               
                  You roaring Boyes, and sturdy Theeues,
                   you Pimpes, and Apple-squires:
                  Lament the case of these poore knaues,
                   and warme them by your fires.
               
               
                  They snorting lye like Hogs in stie,
                   but hardly are so warme:
                  If all that cheat, such hap should meet,
                   to true men 'twere no harme.
               
               
                  They money had, which made them glad,
                   their ioy did not indure:
                  Were all Theeues seru'd as these haue beene,
                  I thinke there would be fewer.
               
               
                  
                  When that they awake, their hearts will ake,
                   to thinke vpon their losse;
                  And though the gallows they escape,
                   they goe by weeping crosse.
               
               
                  Your Trulls expect your comming home
                   with full and heauy purse:
                  When that they see tis nothing so,
                   oh how they'le rayle and curse.
               
               
                  For he that loues to keepe a whore,
                   must haue a giuing hand:
                  Which makes a many knaues be choakt,
                   for bidding true men stand.
               
               They were scarce any thing the better for this Song, for they slept all that while: so Miles left them at their rest; but they had small cause to sléepe so soundly as they did, for they were more wetter then ere was Scold with cucking. Miles gaue his Master his money againe, &amp; told the story of their merry pilgramage: he laughed at it, and wisht all men had the like power to serue all such knaues in the like kind. The théeues waking in the morning &amp; missing their money, and séeing themselues in that plight, thought that they had béene serued so by some diuine power, for robbing a Church-man, and therefore they swore one to the other, neuer to meddle with any Church man againe.
            
            
               How Vandermast, for the disgrace that he had receiued by Fryer Bacon sent a Souldier to kill him; and how Fryer Bacon escaped killing, and turned the Souldier from an Atheist to be a good Christian.
               FRyer Bacon sitting one day in his Study, looked ouer all the dangers that were to happen to him that

moneth, there found he, that in the second wéeke of the moneth, betwéene Sunne rising and setting, there was a great danger to fall on him, which would without great care of preuention take away his life. This danger which he did foresée, was caused by the Germane Coniurer Vandermast, for he vowed a reuenge for the disgrace that he had receiued. To execute the same, hee hyred a Walloon Souldier, and gaue him one thousand crownes to do the same, fifty before hand, and fifty when hee had killed him.
               Fryer Bacon, to saue himselfe from this danger that was like to happen to him, would alwayes when that he read, hold a ball of Brasse in his hand, and vnder that ball would he set a bason of Brasse, that if hee did chance to sléepe in his reading, the fall of the Ball out of his hand into the Bason, might wake him. Being one day in his Study in this manner, and asléepe the Walloon Souldier was got in to him, and had drawne his sword to kill him: but as hee was ready for to strike, downe fell the Ball out of Fryer Bacons hand, and waked him. Hee séeing the Souldier stand there with a sword drawen, asked him what hee was? and wherefore hee came there in that manner? The Souldier boldly answered him thus: I am a Walloon, and a Souldier, and more then this, a villaine: I am come hither, because I was sent; I was sent, because I was hyred; I was hyred, because I durst do it; the thing I should doe, is not done; the thing to be done, is to kill thée: thus haue you heard what I am and why I come. Fryer Bacon wondered at this mans resolution; then asked hee of him, who set him on worke to b
                     •
                  e a murderer? Hée boldly told him, Vandermast the Germane Coniurer. Fryer Bacon then asked him what Religion he was of? He answered, Of that which many doe professe, the chiefe principles of which were these: to goe to an Ale-house, and to a Church with one deuation, to abstaine from euill for want of action, and to doe good

against their wills. It is a good profession for a deuill (said Fryer Bacon) Doest thou beleeue hell? I beléeue no such thing, answered the Souldier. Then will I shew thée the contrary, said the Fryer: and presently raysed the ghost of Iulian the Apostata, who came vp with his body burning, and so full of wounds, that it almost did affright the Souldiour out of his wits. Then Bacon did command this spirit to speake, and to shew what hee was, and wherefore hee was thus tormented? Then spake hee to it in this manner: I sometimes was a Romane Emperour; some count greatnesse and happinesse: I had a happinesse beyond my Empire, had I kéept that, I had béene a happy man: would I had lost my Empire when I lost that, I was a Christian, that was my happinesse; but my selfe loue and pride made me to fall from it; for which I now am punished with neuer ceasing torments, which I must still endure: the like which I enioy is now prepared for vnbeléeuing wretches like my selfe, so vanished he away.
               All this while the Souldier stood quaking, and sweat as he had felt the torments himselfe; and falling downe on his knées desired Fryer Bacon to instruct him in a better course of life, then he had yet gone in. Fryer Bacon told him, that he should not want his helpe in any thing, which he performed, instructing him better: then gaue he him money, and sent him to the warres of the holy land, where he was slaine.
            
            
               How Fryer Bacon deceiued an old Vsurer.
               NOt farre from Fryer Bacon, dwelt an olde man that had great store of money which hee let out to vse, and would neuer doe any good with it to the poore, though Fryer Bacon had often put him in minde of it, and wished him to do some good whilest he liued. Fryer Bacon séeing this, by his Art made an Iron pot, which séemed full of gold, this being done, hée went to this rich

Vsurer, and told him, that he had some gold which he had gathered in his time that he had liued; but it being much in quantity, hée feared that if it were knowne, it would be taken from him, because it was vnfitting a man of his coat should haue so much: Now he desired him that hée would let him haue some hundred pounds, which was not the sixe part of his gold, and he should kéepe it for him. The Vsurer was glad to heare of this, and told him that he should haue it, and that he would kéepe his gold as safe as he himselfe would: Fryer Bacon was glad to heare of this, and presently fetcht the pot: at the sight of which the Vsurer laughed, and thought to himselfe, how all that gold was his owne, for hee had a determination is gull the Fryer, but he gulled himselfe. Sée héere is the gold (said Fryer Bacon) now let me haue of you one hundred pounds, and kéep you this gold till I pay it backe againe: Very willingly (said the Vsurer) and told him one hundred pounds out, which Fryer Bacon tooke, and deliuered him the pot, and so went his way. This mony did Fryer Bacon giue to diuers poore schollers, and other people, and bid them pray for old Good-gatherers soules health (so was this Vsurer call'd) which these poore people did, and would giue him thankes &amp; prayers when they met him, which he did wonder at; for he neuer deserued the praiers of any man. At last this old Good-gatherer went to looke on this pot of gold, but instead of gold he found nothing but earth at which sight he would haue died, had not his other gold hindred him, which hee was to leaue behind him: so gathering vp his spirits, hee went to Fryer Bacon, and told him he was abused &amp; cheated; for which he would haue the law of him, vnlesse he made him restitution. Fryer Bacon told him, that he had not cheated him, but bin his faithfull steward to the poore, which he could not chuse but know, either by their prayers, or their thanke: &amp; as for the law he feared it not, but bid him doe his worst. The old man séeing Fryer Bacons resolution, went his way, and said, that hereafter he would be his owne steward.
            
            
               
               How Miles, Fryer Bacons man, did coniure for meat, and got meat for himselfe and his Hoast.
               
                  MIles chanced one day vpon some businesse, to goe some sixe miles from home, and being loth to part with some company that he had, he was belated, &amp; could get but halfe way home that night: to saue his purse hee went to ones house that was his Masters acquaintance: but when he came, the good man of the house was not at home, and the woman would not let him haue lodging. Miles séeing such cold entertainment, wished that he had not troubled her, but being now there, he was loth to goe any further, and therefore with good words he perswaded her for to giue him lodging that night. She told him that she would willingly do it, if her husband were at home, but he being now out of towne, it would bee to her discredit to lodge any man. You néede not to mistrust me, (said Miles) for I haue no thought to attempt your chastitie: locke me in any place where there is a bed, and I will not trouble you till to morrow that I rise. She thinking her husband would be angry if she should deny any of his friends so small a request, consented that he should lye there, if that he would be locked vp: Miles was contented, and presently went to bed, and she locked him into the chamber where he lay.
               Long had not he béene a bed, but he heard the doore open; with that he rose and péeped through a thinke of the partition, and saw an old man come in: this man set downe his Basket that he had on his arme, and gaue the woman of the house thrée or foure swéet kisses, which made Miles his mouth runne with water to sée it: Then did hee vndoe his Basket, and pulled out of it a fat Capon ready roasted, and Bread, with a bottle of good olde Sacke: this gaue hée vnto her, saying: Swéetheart, hearing thy Husband was out of towne, I thought good to visite thée, I am not come emptie

handed, but haue brought some thing to bee merrie withall: lay the cloth swéete Hony, and let vs first to Banquet, and then to bed. She kindly thanked him, and presently did as he had her: They were not scarce set at the Tadle, but her husband returning backe, knockt at the doore. The woman hearing this, was amazed, and knew not what to doe with her old Louer: but looking on her apron-strings, she straite found (as women vse to doe) a tricke to put her selfe frée from this feare; for shée put her Louer vnder the bed, the Capon &amp; Bread she put vnder a Tub, the buttle of Wine shee put behinde the Chest, &amp; then she did open the doore, &amp; with a dissembling kisse welcomed her husband home, asking him the reason why that he returned so quickly. He told her, that hee had forgot the money that hee should haue carried with him, but on the morrow betimes he would he gone. Miles saw and heard all this; and hauing a desire to taste of the Capon &amp; the Wine, called to the Goodman. He asked his wife who that was? She told him, an acquaintance of his, that intreated lodging there that night. He bid hee open the doore, which she did, and let Miles out. Hée seeing Miles there, bid him welcome, and bade his wife to set them some meate on the table: she told him, that there was not any ready, but prayed him to kéepe his stomacke till to morrow, and then she would prouide them a good breakefast. Since it is so Miles (said the goodman) wee must rest contented and sléepe out our hunger. Nay stay, said Miles, if that you can eate, I can find you good meate; I am a Scholler and haue some Art. I would faine sée it (said the goodman) You shall, quoth Miles, and that presently. With that Miles pulled forth a booke out of his bosome, and began his Coniuration in this fashion:
               
                  From the fearefull Lake below,
                  From whence Spirits come and goe;
                  Straightway come one and attend
                  Fryer Bacons man, and friend.
               
               
                  Comes there none yet, quoth Miles? then I must vse some other Charme.
               
                  Now the Owle is flowne abroad,
                  For I heare the croaking Toade,
                  And the Bat that shuns the day,
                  Through the darke doth make her way.
                  Now the ghosts of men doe rise,
                  And with fearefull hedious cryes,
                  Seekes reuengement (from the good)
                  On their heads that spilt their blood,
                  Come some Spirit, quicke I say,
                  Night's the Deuils Holy-day:
                  Where ere you be, in dennes, or lake,
                  In the Iuy, Ewe, or Brake;
                  Quickly come and me attend,
                  That am Bacons man and friend.
                  But I will haue you take no shape
                  Of a Beare, a Horse, or Ape:
                  Nor will I haue you terrible,
                  And therefore come inuisible.
               
               Now he is come, (quoth Miles, and therefore tell mée what meat you will haue mine Hoast? Any thing Miles, (said the Goodman) what thou wilt. Why then (sayd Miles) what say you to a Capon? I loue it aboue all meat (said the Goodman.) Why then a Capon you shall haue, and that a good one too. Bemo my spirit that I haue raised to doe mée seruice, I charge thée, séeke and search about the earth, and bring me hither straight the best of Capons ready rosted. Then stood hee still a little, as though hee had attended the comming of his spirit, and on the sudden said: It is well done my Bemo, hée hath brought me (mine Hoast) a fat Capon from the King of Tripolis owne Table, and bread with it. I but where is it Miles (said the Hoast) I sée neither Spirit nor Capon. Looke vnder the Tub (quoth Miles) and

there you shall finde it. He presently did, and brought (to his wiues griefe) the Capon and Bread out. Stay (quoth Miles) we doe yet want some drinke that is comfortable and good; I thinke (mine Hoast) a bottle of Malligo Sacke were not amisse, I will haue it: Bemo, haste the to Malligo, and fetch me from the Gouernours, a Bottle of his best Sacke. The poore woman thought that hee would haue betrayed her and her louer, and therefore wished that hée had béene hanged, when that hee came first into her house.) Hée hauing stood a little while, as before, saide: Well done, Bemo, looke behinde the great Chest (mine Hoast:) Hée did so, and brought out the Bottle of Sacke. Now (quoth hee) Miles sit downe, and welcome to thine owne Chéere: You may sée Wife (quoth hee) what a man of Art can doe, get a fatte Capon, and a Bottle of good Wine in a quarter of an houre, and for nothing, which is best of all: Come (good wife) sit downe, and bee merry: for all this is payd for, I thanke Miles.
               
               Shée sate, but could not eate a bit for anger, but wished that euery bit they did eate might choake them: Her old Louer too that lay vnder the bed all this while, was ready to bepisse himselfe for feare, for hée still looked when that Miles would discouer him. When they had eaten and dranke well, the goodman desired Miles that hee would let him sée the Spirit that fetched them this good chéere: Miles séemed vnwilling, telling him that it was against the Lawes of Art, to let an illiterate man see a Spirit: but yet for once hee would let him sée it, and told him withall, that hee must open the doore, and soundly beat the Spirit, or else hee should bée troubled hereafter with it: and because hee should not feare it, hée would put it into the shape of some one of his neighbours. The Goodman told him, that hee néede not to doubt his valour, hée would beat him soundly, and to that purpose

in all hast went to Fryer Bacon, and desired of him some help to recouer his Loue againe, whom he feared was vtterly lost.
               Fryer Bacon (knowing him for a vertuous Gentleman) pittyed him; and to giue his griefes some release, shewed him a Glasse, wherein any one might sée any thing done (within fifty miles space) that they desired: So soone as he looked in the Glasse, hee saw his Loue Millisant with her Father, and the Knight, ready to be marryed by Fryer Bungye: At the sight of this hee cryed out that he was vndone, for now should hee lose his life in losing of his Loue. Fryer Bacon bids him take comfort, for he would preuent the marriage; so taking this Gentleman in his armes, hee set himselfe downe in an inchanted Chaire, and suddenly they were carryed through the ayre to the Chappell. Iust as they came in, Fryer Bungye was ioyning their hands to marry them: but Fryer Bacon spoyled his spéech, for he strucke him dumbe, so that he could not speake a word. Then raised he a myst in the Chappell, so that neither the Father could sée his Daughter, nor the Daughter her Father, nor the Knight either of them. Then tooke he Millisant by the hand, and led her to the man she most desire: they both wept for ioy, that they so happily once more had met, and kindly thanked Fryer Bacon.
               
               It greatly pleased Fryer Bacon to sée the passion of these two Louers, and séeing them both contented, hee marryed them at the Chappell doore, whilest her Father, the Knight, and Fryer Bungye went groping within, and could not find the way out. Now when he had married them, he bid them get lodging at the next Village, and he would send his man with money: (for the Gentleman was not stored, and hee had a great way to his house) they did as he had them. That night hee sent his man Miles with money to them; but hee

kept her Father, the Knight, and Fryer Bungye till the next day at noone in the Chappell, ere be released them.
               The Gentleman and his new married wife made that night a great Supper for ioy of their marriage, and bid to it most of the Village: They wanted nothing but Musicke, for which they made great moane. This want, Fryer Bacon (though he was absent) supplied: For after Supper there came such a Maske, that the like was neuer séene in that Village: For first, there was heard most swéet still Musicke, then wind Musicke: Then came thrée Apes, and three Monkeys, each of them carrying a Torch: after them followed sixe Apes and Monkeyes more, all dressed in Anticke coats: these last sixe fell a dancing in such an odde manner, that they mooued all the beholders to much laughter: so after diuers Antick changes, they did reuerence to the Bridegroome and Bride, and so departed in order as they came in. They all did maruell from whence these should come: but the Bridegroome knew that it was Fryer Bacons Art that gaue them this grace to their Wedding. When all was done, to bed they went, and enioyed their wishes. The next day he went home to his owne house with his Bride; and for the cost hee had bestowed on them, most part of the Townes-folke brought them on their way.
               
                  Miles made one amongst them too; he for his Masters sake was so plyed with Cups, that he in three dayes was scarce sober: for his welcome, at his departure he gaue them this Song: To the tune of, I haue beene a Fidler, &amp;c.
               
               
                  And did not you heare of a mirth that be fell,
                   the morrow after a Wedding day:
                  At carrying a Bride at home to dwell,
                   and away to Twiuer, away, away?
               
               
                  
                  The Quintin was set, and the garlands were made,
                   'tis pitty old custome should euer decay:
                  And woe be to him that was horst on a Iade,
                   for he carried no credit away, away.
               
               
                  We met a Consort of Fiddle-dedees,
                   we set them a cock-horse, and made them to play,
                  The winning of Bullen, and Vpsie-frees,
                   and away to Twiuer, away, away.
               
               
                  There was ne'r a Lad in all the Parish,
                   that would goe to the Plow that day:
                  But on his Fore-horse his Wench he carries,
                   and away to Twiuer, away, away.
               
               
                  The Butler was quicke, and the Ale he did tap,
                   the Maidens did make the Chamber full gay:
                  The Seruing-men gaue me a Fudling Cap,
                   and I did carryed it away, away.
               
               
                  The Smith of the Towne his Liquor so tooke,
                   that he was perswaded the ground look'd blue,
                  And I dare boldly to sweare on a booke,
                   such Smiths as he, there are but a few.
               
               
                  A Posset was made, and the women did sip,
                   and simpering said they could eat no more:
                  Full many a Maid was laid on the lip:
                  Ile say no more, but so giue ore.
               
               They kindly thanked Miles for his Song, and so sent him home with a Foxe at his Tayle. His Master asked him, Where he had béene so long? He told him, at the Wedding. I know it (said Fryer Bacon) that thou hast béene there, and I know also (thou beast) that thou hast béen euery day drunke. That is the worst that

you can say by mée, Master, for still poore men must be drunke, if that they take a cup more then ordinary; b
                     •
                  t it is not so with the rich. Why how is it with the rich then? I will tell you (said Miles) in few words:
               
                  Lawyers they are sicke,
                  And Fryers are ill at ease;
                  But poore men they are drunke,
                  And all is one disease.
               
               Well sirrah (said Fryer Bacon) let mee not heare that you are infected any more with this disease, lest I giue you sowre sawce to your swéet meat. Thus did Fryer Bacon helpe these poore Louers, who in short time got the loue of the old man, and liued in great ioy: Fryer Bungye his tongue was againe let loose, and all were friends.
            
            
               How Vandermast and Fryer Bungye met, and how they striued who should excell one another in their Coniurations; and of their deaths.
               
                  VAndermast thinking that Fryer Bacon had beene dead, came into England, and in Kent met with Fryer Bungye: he owing him no good will for Fryer Bacons sake, tooke his horse out of the Stable, and in stead of it, left a Spirit like vnto it. Fryer Bungye in the morning rose, and mounting this Spirit (which he though had béen his Horse) rode on his iourney: but he riding thorow a water, was left in the middst of it by this Spirit; and being thus wet, hee returned to his Inne, At the Inne doore, Vandermast met him, and asked
